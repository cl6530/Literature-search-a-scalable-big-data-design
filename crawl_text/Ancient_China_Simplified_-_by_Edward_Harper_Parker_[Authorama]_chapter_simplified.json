        "Boswell once remarked to Dr. Johnson that “the history of England\nis so strange that, if it were not well vouched as it is, it would\nbe hardly credible.” To which Johnson replied in his usual style:\n\"Sir, if it were told as shortly, and with as little preparation\nfor introducing the different events, as the history of the Jewish\nkings, it would be equally liable to objections of improbability.\"\nDr. Johnson went on to illustrate what he meant, by specific\nallusion to the concessions to Parliament made by Charles I. “If,\"\nhe said, “these had been related nakedly, without any detail of\nthe circumstances which generally led to them, they would not have\nbeen believed.”",
        "This is exactly the position of ancient Chinese history, which may\nbe roughly said to coincide in time with the history of the Jewish\nkings. The Chinese Annals are mere diaries of events, isolated\nfacts being tumbled together in order of date, without any regard\nfor proportion. Epoch-making invasions, defeats, and cessions of\nterritory are laconically noted down on a level with the prince’s\nindiscretion in weeping for a concubine as he would weep for a\nwife; or the Emperor’s bounty in sending a dish of sacrificial\nmeat to a vassal power by express messenger. In one way there is a\ndistinct advantage in this method, for, the historian being seldom\ntempted to obtrude his own opinion or comments, we are left a\nclear course for the formation of our own judgments upon the facts\ngiven. On the other hand, it is unfortunate that what may be\ncalled the philosophy of history has never been seized by the\nChinese mind: the annalists do not trouble themselves with the\nrights and aspirations of the masses; the results to general\npolicy that naturally follow upon increase of population,\nperfecting of arms and munitions of war, admixture of foreign\nblood with the body politic, and such like matters. The heads of\nevents being noted, it seems to be left to the reader to fill in\nthe details from his imagination, and from his knowledge of\ncontemporary affairs. For instance, suppose the reign of Queen\nVictoria were to begin after this fashion:–\"1837, 5th moon,\nKalends, Victoria succeeded: 9th moon, Ides, Napoleon paid a\nvisit: 28th day, London flooded; 10th moon, 29th day, eclipse of\nthe sun\"; and so on. At the time, and for many years–possibly\ncenturies–afterwards, there would be accurate general traditional,\nor even written, information as to who Victoria was; why Napoleon\npaid a visit; in what particular way the flood affected England generally;\nfrom what parts the eclipse was best visible, etc. These details would\nfade in distinctness with each successive generation; commentators\nwould come to the rescue; then commentators upon commentators;\nand discussions as to which man was the most trustworthy of them all.",
        "Under these circumstances it is difficult enough for the Chinese\nthemselves to construct a series of historical lessons, adequate\nto guide them in the conduct of modern affairs, out of so\nheterogeneous a mass of material. This difficulty is, in the case\nof Westerners, more than doubled by the strange, and to us\ninharmonious, sounds of Chinese proper names: moreover, as they\nare monosyllabical, and many of them exactly similar when\nexpressed in our letters, it is almost impossible to remember\nthem, and to distinguish one from the other. Thus most persons who\nmake an honest endeavour by means of translations to master the\nleading events in ancient Chinese history soon throw down the book\nin despair; while even specialists, who may wish to shorten their\nlabours by availing themselves of others’ work, can only get a\nfirm grip of translations by comparing them with the originals: it\nis thus really impossible to acquire anything at all approaching\nan accurate understanding of Chinese antiquity without possessing\nin some degree the controlling power of a knowledge of the\npictographs.",
        "It is in view of all these difficulties that an attempt has been\nmade in this book to extract principles from isolated facts; to\navoid, so far as is possible, the use of Chinese proper names; to\nintroduce these as sparingly and gradually as is practicable when\nthey must be used at all; to describe the general trend of events\nand life of the people rather than the personal acts of rulers and\ngreat officers; and, generally, to put it into the power of any\none who can only read English, to gain an intelligible notion of\nwhat Chinese antiquity really was; and what principles and\nmotives, declared or tacit, underlay it. It is with this object\nbefore me that I have ventured to call my humble work “Ancient\nChina Simplified,” and I can only express a hope that it will\nreally be found intelligible.",

        "There is much repetition in the book, the same facts being\npresented, for instance, under the heads of Army, Religion,\nConfucius, and Marriages. This is intentional, and the object is\nto keep in the mind impressions which in a strange, ancient, and\nobscure subject are apt to disappear after perusal of only one or\ntwo casual statements.",
        "The Index has been carefully prepared so that any allusion or\nstatement vaguely retained in the mind may at once be confirmed.\nThe Chapter headings, or contents list, which itself contains\nnearly five per cent of the whole letterpress, is so arranged that\nit omits no feature treated of in the main text.",
        "In the earlier Chapters uncouth proper names are reduced to a\nminimum, but the Index refers by name to specific places and\npersons only generally mentioned in the earlier pages. For\ninstance, the states of Lu and CHENG on pages 22 and 29: it is\nhard enough to differentiate Ts’i, Tsin, Ts’in, and Ts’u at the\noutstart, without crowding the memory with fresh names until the\nnecessity for it absolutely arises.",
        "The nine maps are inserted where they are most likely to be\nuseful: it is a good plan to refer to a map each time a place is\nmentioned, unless the memory suffices to suggest exactly where\nthat place is. After two or three patient references, situations\nof places will take better root in the mind.",
        "The Chapters are split up into short discussions and descriptions,\nbecause longer divisions are apt to be tedious where ancient\nhistory is concerned. And the narrative of political movement is\nfrequently interrupted by the introduction of new matter, in order\nto provide novelty and stimulate the imagination. Moreover, all\nChapters and all subjects converge on one general focus.",
        "On page 15 of “China, her Diplomacy, etc.” (John Murray, 1901), I\nhave confessed how tedious I myself had found ancient Chinese\nhistory, and how its human interest only begins with foreign\nrelations. I have, however, gone systematically through the mill\nonce more, and my present object is to present general results\nonly obtainable at the cost of laboriously picking out and\nresetting isolated and often apparently unconnected records of\nfact.",

        "2. This map is intended to give a general idea of the extremely\nlimited area of the empire in the sixth century B.C.",
        "3. Like the modern Sultan, the Chow Emperor was gradually driven\ninto a corner, surrounded by Bulgarias, Servias, Egypts, and other\ncountries once under his effective rule; and, like the Sultan, the\nChou Emperor remained spiritual head for many centuries after the\npractical dismemberment of his empire.",
        "4. Until quite recent times, the true source of the Yang-tsz had\nbeen unknown to the Chinese, and the River Min has been, and even\nstill is, considered to be the chief head-water. It flows through\nthe rich country of ancient Shuh, now the administrative centre of\nSz Ch’wan province.",
        "5. Even now the Yang-tsz River is practically the only great route\nfrom China into Sz Ch’wan, and in ancient times the rapids were\nprobably not negotiable by large craft.",
        "6. The land routes into Sz Ch’wan from the head-waters of the Wei\nand Ilan Rivers are all extremely precipitous. It was not until\n200 B.C. that any military road was attempted.",
        "7. Ancient China meant the Yellow River. Then the Han and the\nHwai. Next the Yang-tsz. Last the Sz Ch’wan tributaries of the\nYang-tsz. It was through the lakes and rivers south of the Yang-\ntsz that China at last colonized the south.",
        "The year 842 B.C. may be considered the first accurate date in\nChinese history, and in this year the Emperor had to flee from his\ncapital on account of popular dissatisfaction with his tyrannical\nways: he betook himself northward to an outlying settlement on the\nTartar frontier, and the charge of imperial affairs was taken over\nby a regency or duumvirate.",
        "At this time the confederation of cultured princes called China–\nor, to use their own term, the Central Kingdom–was a very\ndifferent region from the huge mass of territory familiar to us\nunder those names at the present day. It is hardly an exaggeration\nto say that civilized China, even at that comparatively advanced\nperiod, consisted of little more than the modern province of Ho\nNan. All outside this flat and comparatively riverless region\ninhabited by the “orthodox” was more or less barbaric, and such\ncivilization as it possessed was entirely the work of Chinese\ncolonists, adventurers, or grantees of fiefs in partibus\ninfidelium (so to speak). Into matters of still earlier\nancient history we may enter more deeply in another Chapter, but\nfor the present we simply take China as it was when definite\nchronology begins.",
        "The third of the great dynasties which had ruled over this limited\nChina had, in 842 B.C., already been on the imperial throne for\npractically three hundred years, and, following the custom of its\npredecessors, it had parcelled out all the land under its sway to\nvassal princes who were, subject to the general imperial law and\ncustom, or ritual, together with the homage and tribute duty\nprescribed thereunder, all practically absolute in their own\ndomains. Roughly speaking, those smaller fiefs may be said to have\ncorresponded in size with the walled-city and surrounding district\nof our own times, so well known under the name of hien.\nAbout a dozen of the larger fiefs had been originally granted to\nthe blood relations of the dynastic founder in or after 1122 B.C.;\nbut not exclusively so, for it seems to have been a point of\nhonour, or of religious scruple, not to “cut off the sacrifices\"\nfrom ruined or disgraced reigning families, unless the attendant\ncircumstances were very gross; and so it came to pass that\nsuccessive dynasties would strain a point in order to keep up the\nspiritual memory of decayed or rival houses.",
        "Thus, at the time of which we speak (842 B.C.), about ten of the\ndozen or so of larger vassal princes were either of the same clan\nas the Emperor himself, or were descended from remoter branches of\nthat clan before it secured the imperial throne; or, again, were\ndescended from ministers and statesmen who had assisted the\nfounder to obtain empire; whilst the two or three remaining great\nvassals were lineal representatives of previous dynasties, or of\ntheir great ministers, keeping up the honour and the sacrifices of\nbygone historical personages. As for the minor fiefs, numbering\nsomewhere between a thousand and fifteen hundred, these play no\npart in political history, except as this or that one of them may\nhave been thrust prominently forward for a moment as a pawn in the\ngame of ambition played by the greater vassals. Nominally the\nEmperor was direct suzerain lord of all vassals, great or small;\nbut in practice the greater vassal princes seem to have been what\nin the Norman feudal system were called “mesne lords\"; that is,\neach one was surrounded by his own group of minor ruling lords,\nwho, in turn, naturally clung for protection to that powerful\nmagnate who was most immediately accessible in case of need; thus\nvassal rulers might be indefinitely multiplied, and there is some\nvagueness as to their numbers.",
        "Just as the oldest civilizations of the West concentrated\nthemselves along the banks of the Euphrates and the Nile, so the\nmost ancient Chinese civilization is found concentrated along the\nsouth bank of the Yellow River. The configuration of the land as\nshown on a modern map assists us to understand how the industrious\ncultivators and weavers, finding the flat and so-called\nloess territory too confined for their ever-increasing\nnumbers, threw out colonies wherever attraction offered, and\nwherever the riverine systems gave them easy access; whether by\nboat and raft; or whether–as seems more probable, owing to the\nscanty mention of boat-travel–by simply following the low levels\nsought by the streams, and tilling on their way such pasturages as\nthey found by the river-sides. When it is said that the earliest\nChinese we know of clung to the Yellow River bed, it must be\nremembered that “the River” (as they call it simply) turned sharp\nto the north at a point in Ho Nan province very far to the west of\nits present northerly course, near a city marked in the modern\nmaps as Jung-t&h, in lat. 35 degrees N., long, 114 degrees E., or\nthereabouts; moreover, its course further north lay considerably to the\nwestward of the present Grand Canal, taking possession now of the\nbed of the Wei River, now of that of the Chang River, according to\nwhether we regard it before or after the year 602 B.C.; but always\nentering the Gulf near modern Tientsin. Hence we need not be\nsurprised to find that the Conqueror or Assertor of the dynasty\nhad conferred upon a staunch adviser, of alien origin, and upon\ntwo of his most trusty relatives, the three distant fiefs which\ncommanded both sides of the Yellow River mouth, at that time near\nthe modern Tientsin. There was no Canal in those days, and the\nriver which runs past Confucius’ birth-place, and now goes towards\nfeeding the Grand Canal, had then a free course south-east towards\nthe lakes in Kiang Su province to the north of Nanking. It will be\nnoticed that quite a network of tributary rivers take their rise\nin Ho Nan province, and trend in an easterly direction towards the\nintricate Hwai River system. The River Hwai, which has a great\nhistory in the course of Chinese development, was in quite recent\ntimes taken possession of by the Yellow River for some years, and\nsince then the Grand Canal and the lakes between them have so\nimpeded its natural course that it may be said to have no natural\ndelta at all; to be dissipated in a dedalus of salt flats,\nirrigation channels, and marshes: hence it is not so obvious to us\nnow why the whole coast-line was at the period we are now\ndescribing, when there was no Grand Canal, quite beyond the reach\nof Chinese colonization from the Yellow River valley: this was\nonly possible in two directions–firstly to the south, by way of\nthe numerous ramifications of the Han River, which now, as then,\njoins the Yang-tsz Kiang at Hankow; and secondly to the south-\neast, by way of the equally numerous ramifications of the Hwai\nRiver, which entered the sea in lat. 34o N. No easy emigration to\nthe westward or south-westward was possible in those comparatively\nroadless days, for not a single river pointed out the obvious way to\nwould-be colonists.",
        "Accustomed as we now are to regard China as one vast homogeneous\nwhole, approachable to us easily from the sea, it is not easy for\nus to understand the historical lines of expansion without these\npreliminary explanations. Corea and Japan were totally unknown\neven by name, and even Liao Tung, or “East of the River Liao,\"\nwhich was then inhabited by Corean tribes, was, if known by\ntradition at all, certainly only in communication with the remote\nChinese colony, or vassal state, in possession of the Peking\nplain: on the other hand, this vassal state itself (if it had\nrecords of its own at all), for the three centuries previous to\n842 B.C., had no political relations with the federated Chinese\nprinces, and nothing is known of its internal doings, or of its\nimmediate relations (if any) with Manchus and Coreans. The whole\ncoast-line of Shan Tung was in the hands of various tribes of\n\"Eastern Barbarians.” True, a number of Chinese vassal rulers held\npetty fiefs to the south and the east of the two highly civilized\nprincipalities already described as being in possession of the\nLower Yellow River; but the originally orthodox rulers of these\npetty colonies are distinctly stated to have partly followed\nbarbarian usage, even despite their own imperial clan origin, and\nto have paid court to these two greater vassals as mesne lords,\ninstead of direct to the Emperor. South of these, again, came the\nHwai group of Eastern barbarians in possession of the Lower Hwai\nvalley, and the various quite unknown tribes of Eastern barbarians\noccupying the marshy salt flats and shore accretions on the Kiang\nSu coast right down to the River Yang-tsz mouth.",
        "As we shall see, a century or two later than 842 B.C. powerful\nsemi-Chinese states began to assert themselves against the\nfederated orthodox Chinese princes lying to their north; but, when\ndated history first opens, Central China knew nothing whatever of\nany part of the vast region lying to the south of the Yang-tsz;\nnothing whatever of what we now call Yiin Nan and Sz Ch’wan, not\nto say of the Indian and Tibetan dominions lying beyond them; \nfortiori nothing of Formosa, Hainan, Cochin-China, Tonquin,\nBurma, Siam, or the various Hindoo trading colonies advancing from\nthe South Sea Islands northwards along the Indo-Chinese coasts;\nnothing whatever of Tsaidam, the Tarim Valley, the Desert, the\nPersian civilization, Turkestan, Kashgaria, Tartary, or Siberia.",
        "It is, and will here be made, quite clear that the whole of the\nleft bank of the Yellow River was in possession of various Turkish\nand Tartar-Tibetan tribes. The only exception is that the south-\nwest corner of Shan Si province, notably the territory enclosed\nbetween the Yellow River and the River F&n (which, running from\nthe north, bisects Shan Si province and enters the Yellow River\nabout lat. 35” 30’ N., long. 110 degrees 30’ E.) was colonized by a branch\nof the imperial family quite capable of holding its own against\nthe Tartars; in fact, the valley of this river as far north as\nP’ing-yang Fu had been in semi-mythical times (2300 B.C.) the\nimperial residence. It will be noticed that the River Wei joins\nthe Yellow River on its right bank, just opposite the point where\nthis latter, flowing from the north, bends eastwards, the Wei\nitself flowing from the west. This Wei Valley (including the sub-\nvalleys of its north-bank tributaries) was also in 842 B.C.\ncolonized by an ancient Chinese family–not of imperial extraction\nso far as the reigning house was concerned–which, by adopting\nTartar, or perhaps Tartar–Tibetan, manners, had for many\ngenerations succeeded in acquiring a predominant influence in that\nregion. Assuming that–which is not at all improbable–the nomad\nhorsemen in unchallenged possession of the whole desert and Tartar\nexpanse had at any time, as a consequence of their raids in\ndirections away from China westward, brought to China any new\nideas, new commercial objects, or new religious notions, these\nnovelties must almost necessarily have filtered through this semi-\nChinese half-barbarous state in possession of the Wei Valley, or\nthrough other of their Tartar kinsmen periodically engaged in\nraiding the settled Chinese cultivators farther east, along the\nline of what is now the Great Wall, and the northern parts of Shan\nSi and Chih Li provinces.",
        "We shall allude in a more convenient place and Chapter to specific\ntraditions touching the supposed journeys about 990 B.C. of a\nChinese Emperor to Turkestan; the alleged missions from Tonquin to\na still earlier Chinese Emperor or Regent; and the pretended\ncolonization of Corea by an aggrieved Chinese noble-all three\nevents some centuries earlier than the opening period of dated\nhistory of which we now specially speak. For the present we ignore\nthem, as, even if true, these events have had, and have now, no\nspecific or definite influence whatever on the question of Chinese\npolitical development as expounded here. It seems certain that for\nmany centuries previous to 842 B.C. the ruling and the literary\nChinese had known of the existence of at least the Lower Yang-tsz\nand its three mouths (the Shanghai mouth and the Hangchow mouth\nhave ceased long ago to exist at all): they also seem to have\nheard in a vague way of “moving sands” beyond the great northerly\nbend of the Yellow River in Tartarland. It is not even impossible\nthat the persistent traditions of two of their very ancient\nEmperors having been buried south of the Yang-tsz–one near the\nmodern coast treaty-port of Ningpo, the other near the modern\nriverine treaty-port of Ch’ang-sha–may be true; for nothing is\nmore likely than that they both met their death whilst exploring\nthe tributaries of the mysterious Yang-tsz Kiang lying to their\nsouth; because the father of the adventurous Emperor who is\nsupposed to have explored Tartary in ggo B.C. certainly lost his\nlife in attempting to explore the region of Hankow, as will be\nexplained in due course.",
        "All this, however, is matter of side issue. The main point we wish\nto insist upon, by way of introduction, in endeavouring to give\nour readers an intelligible notion of early Chinese development,\nis that Chinese beginnings were like any other great nation’s\nbeginnings–like, for instance, the Greek beginnings; these were\ncentred at first round an extremely petty area, which, gradually\nexpanding, threw out its tentacles and branches, and led to the\nfinal inclusion of the mysterious Danube, the gloomy Russian\nplain, the Tin Islands, Ultima Thule, and the Atlantic coasts into\none fairly harmonious Graeco-Roman civilization. Or it may be\ncompared to the development of the petty Anglo-Saxon settlements\nand kingdoms and sub-kingdoms, and their gradual political\nabsorption of the surrounding Celts. In any case it may be said\nthat there is nothing startlingly new about it; it followed a\nnormal course.",
        "Having now seen how the Chinese people, taking advantage of the\nmaterial and moral growth naturally following upon a settled\nindustrial existence, and above all upon the exclusive possession\nof a written character, gradually imposed themselves as rulers\nupon the ignorant tribes around them, let us see to what families\nthese Chinese emigrant adventurers or colonial satraps belonged.\nTo begin with the semi-Tartar power in the River Wei Valley–\ndestined six hundred years later to conquer the whole of China as\nwe know it to-day–the ruling caste claimed descent from the most\nancient (and of course partly mythological) Emperors of China; but\nfor over a thousand years previous to 842 B.C. this remote branch\nof the Chinese race had become scattered and almost lost amongst\nthe Tartars. However, a generation or two before our opening\nperiod, one of these princes had served the then ruling imperial\ndynasty as a sort of guardian to the western frontier, as a rearer\nof horses for the metropolitan stud, and perhaps even as a guide\non the occasion of imperial expeditions into Tartarland. The\nsuccessor of the Emperor who was driven from his capital in 842\nB.C. about twenty years later employed this western satrap to\nchastise the Tartar nomads whose revolt had in part led to the\nimperial flight. After suffering some disasters, the conductors of\nthis series of expeditions were at last successful, and in 815\nB.C. the title of “Warden of the Western Marches” was officially\nconferred on the ruler for the time being of this western state,\nwho in 777 B.C. had the further honour of seeing one of his\ndaughters married to the Emperor himself. This political move on\nthe part of the Emperor was unwise, for it led indirectly to the\nTartars, who were frequently engaged in war with the Warden,\ninterfering in the quarrels about the imperial succession, in\nwhich question the Tartars naturally thought they had a right to\ninterfere in the interests of their own people. The upshot of it\nwas that in 771 B.C. the Emperor was killed by the Tartars in\nbattle, and it was only by securing the military assistance of the\nsemi-Tartar Warden of the Marches that the imperial dynasty was\nsaved. As it was, the Emperor’s capital was permanently moved east\nfrom the immediate neighbourhood of what we call Si-ngan Fu in\nShen Si province to the immediate neighbourhood of Ho-nan Fu in\nthe modern Ho Nan province; and as a reward for his services the\nWarden was granted nearly the whole of the original imperial\npatrimony west of the Yellow River bend and on both sides of the\nWei Valley. This was also in the year 771 B.C., and this is really\none of the great pivot-points in Chinese history, of equal weight\nwith the almost contemporaneous founding of Rome, and the gradual\nsubstitution of a Roman centre for a Greek centre in the\ndevelopment and civilization of the Far West. The new capital was\nnot, however, a new city. Shortly after the imperial dynasty\ngained the possession of China in 1122 B.C., it had been surveyed,\nand some of the regalia had been taken thither; this, with a view\nof making it one of the capitals at least, if not the sole\ncapital.",
        "As Chinese names sound uncouth to our Western ears, and will,\ntherefore, in these introductory Chapters only be used sparingly\nand gradually, it becomes correspondingly difficult to explain\nhistorical phenomena adequately whilst endeavouring to avoid as\nfar as possible the use of such unintelligible names: it will be\nwell, then, to sum up the situation, and even repeat a little, so\nthat the reader may assimilate the main points without fatigue or\nrepulsion. The reigning dynasty of Chou had secured the adhesion\nof the thousand or more of Chinese vassal princes in 1122 B.C.,\nand had in other words “conquered” China by invitation, much in\nthe same way, and for very much the same general reasons, that\nWilliam III. had’ accepted the conquest of the British Isles; that\nis to say, because the people were dissatisfied with their\nlegitimate ruler and his house. But, before this conquest, the\nvassal princes of Chou had occupied practically the same\nterritory, and had stood in the same relation to the imperial\ndynasty subsequently ousted by them in 1122, that the Wardens of\nthe Marches occupied and stood in when the imperial house of Chou\nin turn fled east in 771 B.C. The Shang dynasty thus ousted by the\nChou princes in 1122, had for like misgovernment driven out the\nHia dynasty in 1766 B.C. Thus, at the time when the Wardens of the\nMarches (whose real territorial title was Princes of Ts’in)\npractically put the imperial power into commission in 771 B.C.,\nthe two old-fashioned dynasties of Shang and Chou had already\nruled patriarchally for almost exactly one thousand years, and\nnothing of either a very startling, or a very definite, character\nhad taken place at all within the comparatively narrow area\ndescribed in our first Chapter.",
        "From this date of 771 B.C., and for five hundred years more down\nto 250 B.C., when the Chou dynasty was extinguished, the rule of\nthe feudal Emperors of China was almost purely nominal, and except\nin so far as this or that powerful vassal made use of the moral,\nand even occasionally of the military power of the metropolitan\ndistrict when it suited his purpose, the imperial ruler was\nchiefly exercised in matters of form and ritual; for under all\nthree patriarchal dynasties it was on form and ritual that the\nidea of government had always been based. Of course the other\npowerful satraps–especially the more distant ones, those not\nbearing the imperial clan-name, and those more or less tinged with\nbarbarian usages–learning by degrees what a helpless and\npowerless personage the Emperor had now become, lost no time in\nturning the novel situation to their own advantage: it is\nconsequently now that begins the “tyrant period,” or the period of\nthe “Five Dictators,” as the Chinese historians loosely term it:\nthat is to say, the period during which each satrap who had the\npower to do so took the lead of the satrap body in general, and\ngave out that he was restoring the imperial prestige, representing\nthe Emperor’s majesty, carrying out the behests of reason,\ncompelling the other vassals to do their duty, keeping up the\nlegitimist sacrifices, and so on. In other words, the population\nof China had grown so enormously, both by peaceful in-breeding and\nby imperceptible absorption of kindred races, that more elbow-room\nwas needed; more freedom from the shackles of ritual, rank, and\nfeudal caste; more independence, and more liberty to take\nadvantage of local or changed traditions. Besides all this, the\nart of writing, though still clumsy, expensive, and confined in\nits higher and literary aspects to the governing classes, had\nrecently become simplified and improved; the salt trade, iron\ntrade, fish industry, silk industry, grain trade, and art of usury\nhad spread from one state to the other, and had developed: though\nthe land roads were bad or non-existent, there were great numbers\nof itinerant dealers in cattle and army provisions. In a word,\nmaterial civilization had made great strides during the thousand\nyears of patriarchal rule immediately preceding the critical\nperiod comprised between the year 842 B.C. and the year 771 B.C.\nThe voices of the advocates and the preachers of ancient\npatriarchal virtues were as of men crying in a wilderness of\nsubstantial prosperity and manly ambition. Thus political and\nnatural forces combined with each other to prepare the way for a\nradical change, and this period of incipient revolution is\nprecisely the period (722-480) treated of in Confucius’ history,\nthe first history of China–meagre though it be–which deals with\ndefinite human facts, instead of “beating the air” (as the Chinese\nsay) with sermons and ritualistic exhortations.",
        "We have already alluded to a princely family, of the same clan-\nname as the Chou Emperor, which had settled in the southern part\nof modern Shan Si province, and had thus acted as a sort of buffer\nstate to the imperial domain by keeping off from it the Tartar-\nTurk tribes in the north. This family was enfeoffed by the new\nChou dynasty in 1106 B.C. to replace the extremely ancient\nprincely house which had reigned there ever since the earliest\nEmperors ruled from that region (2300 B.C.), but which had\nresisted the Chou conquest, and had been exterminated. Nothing\ndefinite is known of what transpired in this principality\nsubsequently to the infeoffment of 1106 B.C., and prior to the\nevents of 771 B.C., at which latter date the ruling prince,\nhearing of the disaster to his kinsman the Emperor, went to meet\nthat monarch’s fugitive successor, and escorted him eastwards to\nhis new capital. This metropolis had, as we have explained\nalready, been marked out some 340 years before this, and had\ncontinued to be one of the chief spiritual and political centres\nin the imperial domain; but for some reason it had never before\n771 B.C. been officially declared a capital, or at all events\nthe capital. Confucius, in his history, does not mention at\nall the petty semi-Tartar state of which we are now speaking\nbefore 671 B.C., and all that we know of its doings during this\ncentury of time is that rival factions, family intrigues, and\npetty annexations at the cost of various Tartar tribes, and of\nsmall, but ancient, Chinese principalities, occupied most of its\ntime. It must be repeated here, however, that, notwithstanding\nTartar neighbours, the valley of the River Fen had been the seat\nof several of China’s oldest semi-mythical emperors-possibly even\nof dynasties,-and at no time do the Tartars seem to have ever\nsucceeded in ousting the Chinese from South Shan Si. The official\nname of the region after the Chou infeoffment of 1106 B.C. was the\nState of Tsin, and it was roughly divided off to the west from its\nless civilized colleague Ts’in by the Yellow River, on the right\nbank of which Tsin still possessed a number of towns. It is\nparticularly difficult for Europeans to realize the sharp\ndistinction in sound between these two names, the more especially\nbecause we have in the West no conception whatever of the effect\nof tone upon a syllable It may be explained, however, that the\nsonant initial and even-voiced tone in the one case, contrasted\nwith the surd initial and the scaled tone in the other, involves\nto the Chinese mind a distinction quite as clear in all dialects\nas the European distinction in all languages between the two\nstates of Prussia and Russia, or between the two peoples Swedes\nand Swiss: it is entirely the imperfection of our Western\nalphabet, not at all that of the spoken sounds or the ideographs,\nthat is at fault.",
        "The Yellow River, running from north to south, not only roughly\nseparated from each other these two Tartar-Chinese buffer states\nin the north-west, but the same Yellow River, flowing east, and\nits tributary, the River Wei, also formed a rough boundary between\nthe two states of Tsin and Ts’in (together) to the north, and the\ninnumerable petty but ancient Chinese principalities surrounding\nthe imperial domain to the south. These principalities or\nsettlements were scattered about among the head-waters of the Han\nRiver and the Hwai River systems, and their manifest destiny, if\nthey needed expansion, clearly drove them further southwards,\nfollowing the courses of all these head-waters, towards the Yang-\ntsz Kiang. But, more than that, the Yellow River, after thus\nflowing east for several hundred miles, turned sharp north in\nlong. 114o E., as already explained, and thence to the north-east\nformed a second rough boundary between Tsin and nearly all the\nremaining orthodox Chinese states. Tsin’s chief task was thus to\nabsorb into its administrative system all the Tartar raiders that\nventured south to the Yellow River.",
        "But there was a third northern state engaged in the task of\nkeeping back the Tartar tribes, and in developing a civilization\nof its own-based largely, of course, upon Chinese principles, but\nmodified so as to meet local exigencies. This was the state of\nTs’i, enclosed between the Yellow River to the west and the sea to\nthe east, but extending much farther north than the boundaries of\nmodern Shan Tung province, if, indeed, the embouchure of the\nYellow River, near modern Tientsin, did not form its northern\nboundary; but the promontory or peninsula, as well as all the\ncoast, was still in the hands of “barbarian” tribes (now long\nsince civilized and assimilated), of which for many centuries past\nno separate trace has remained. We have no means of judging now\nwhether these “barbarians” were uncultured, close kinsmen of the\northodox Chinese; or remote kinsmen; or quite foreign. When the\nChou principality received an invitation by acclamation to conquer\nand administer China in 1122, an obscure political worthy from\nthese eastern parts placed his services as adviser and organizer\nat the command of the new Chou Emperor, in return for which\nimportant help he received the fief of Ts’i. Although obscure,\nthis man traced his descent back to the times when (2300 B.C.) his\nancestors received fiefs from the most ancient Emperors. From that\ntime down to the year 1122 B.C., and onwards to the events of 771\nB.C., nothing much beyond the fact of the Chou infeoffment is\nrecorded; but after the Emperor had been killed by the Tartar-\nTibetans, this state of Ts’i also began to grow restive; and the\nseventh century before Christ opens with the significant statement\nthat “Ts’in, Tsin, and Ts’i, now begin to be powerful states.” Of\nthe three, Tsin alone bore the imperial Chou clan-name of\nKi.",
        "[Illustration: Map.",
        "1. In 2200 B.C. the Yellow River was divided at the point where\nour map begins, and the main waters were conducted to the River\nChang, which thus formed one river with it. But a secondary branch\nwas conducted eastwards to the Rivers T’ah and Tsi (now, 1908, the\nYellow River).",
        "2. In 602 B.C. this secondary branch suddenly turned north,\nfollowed the line of the present (1908) Grand Canal, and joined\nthe main branch, i.e. the River Chang.",
        "3. The capitals of Ts’i and Lu are shown. The Yellow River divided\nTsin from Ts’i, but Tartars harried the whole dividing line.]",
        " North of the Yellow River, where it then entered the sea near the\nmodern treaty-port of Tientsin, there was yet another great\nvassal state, called Yen, which had been given by the founders of\nthe Chou dynasty to a very distinguished blood relative and\nfaithful supporter: this noble prince has been immortalized in\nbeautiful language on account of the rigid justice of his\ndecisions given under the shade of an apple-tree: it was the\npractice in those days to render into popular song the chief\nevents of the times, and it is not improbable, indeed, that this\nSaga literature was the only popular record of the past, until, as\nalready hinted, after 827 B.C., writing became simplified and thus\nmore diffused, instead of being confined to solemn manifestoes and\ncommandments cast or carved on bronze or stone.",
        "“Oh! woodman, spare that tree,\nTouch not a single bough,\nHis wisdom lingers now.”",
        "The words, singularly like those of our own well-known song, are\nknown to every Chinese school-boy, and with hundreds, even\nthousands, of other similar songs, which used to be daily quoted\nas precedents by the statesmen of that primitive period in their\npolitical intercourse with each other, were later pruned,\npurified, and collated by Confucius, until at last they received\nclassical rank in the “Book of Odes” or the “Classic of Poetry,\"\ncontaining a mere tenth part of the old “Odes” as they used to be\npassed from mouth to ear.",
        "Even less is known of the early days of Yen than is known of\nTs’in, Tsin, and Ts’i; there is not even a vague tradition to\nsuggest who ruled it, or what sort of a place it was, before the\nChou prince was sent there; all that is anywhere recorded is that\nit was a very small, poor, and feeble region, dovetailed in\nbetween Tsin and Ts’i, and exposed north to the harassing attacks\nof savages and Coreans (i.e. tribes afterwards enumerated\nas forming part of Corea when the name of Corea became known). The\nmysterious region is only mentioned here at all on account of its\ndistinguished origin, in order to show that the Chinese\ncultivators had from the very earliest times apparently succeeded\nin keeping the bulk of the Tartars to the left bank of the Yellow\nRiver all the way from the Desert to the sea; because later on\n(350 B.C.) Yen actually did become a powerful state; and finally,\nbecause if any very early notions concerning Corea and Japanese\nislands had ever crept vaguely into China at all, it must have\nbeen through this state of Yen, which was coterminous with Liao\nTung and Manchuria. The great point to remember is, the extensive\nterritory between the Great Wall and the Yellow River then lay\nalmost entirely beyond the pale of ancient China, and it was only\nwhen Ts’in, Tsin, Ts’i, and Yen had to look elsewhere than to the\nEmperor for protection from Tartar inroads that the centre of\npolitical gravity was changed once and for ever from the centre of\nChina to the north.",
        "We know nothing of the precise causes which conduced to unusual\nTartar activity at the dawn of Chinese true history: in the\nabsence of any Tartar knowledge of writing, it seems impossible\nnow that we ever can know it. Still less are we in a position to\nspeculate profitably how far the movements on the Chinese\nfrontier, in 800-600 B.C., may be connected with similar\nrestlessness on the Persian and Greek frontiers, of which, again,\nwe know nothing very illuminating or specific. It is certain that\nthe Chinese had no conception of a Tartar empire, or of a coherent\nmonarchy, under the vigorous dominion of a great military genius,\nuntil at least five centuries after the Tartars, killed a Chinese\nEmperor in battle as related (771 B.C.). It is even uncertain what\nwere the main race distinctions of the nomad aggregations, loosely\nstyled by us “Tartars,” for the simple reason that the ambiguous\nChinese terminology does not enable us to select a more specific\nword. Nevertheless, the Chinese do make certain distinctions; and,\nas what remains of aboriginal populations in the north, south,\neast, and west of China points strongly to the probability of\npopulations in the main occupying the same sites that they did\n3000 years ago (unless where specific facts point to a contrary\nconclusion), we may fairly assume that the distribution was then\nvery much as now-beginning from the east, (1) Japanese, (2)\nCorean, (3) Tungusic, (4) Mongol-Turkish, (5) Turkish, (6)\nTurkish-Tibetan, and Mongol-Tibetan (or Mongol-Turkoid Tibetan),\n(7) Tibetan. The Chinese use four terms to express these relative\nquantities, which may be called X, Y, Z, and A. The term “X,” pure\nand simple, never under any circumstances refers to any but\nTibetans (of whom at this time the Chinese had no recorded\nknowledge whatever except by name); but “X + Y” also refers to\ntribes in Tibetan regions. The term “West Y” seems to mean\nTibetan-Tartars, and the term “North Y” seems to mean Mongoloid-\nTunguses. There is a third Y term, “Dog Y,” evidently meaning\nTartars of some kind, and not Tibetans of any sort. The term “Z\"\nnever refers to Tibetans, pure or mixed, but “Y + Z” loosely\nrefers to Turks, Mongols, and Tunguses. The terms “Red Z”, “White\nZ,” and “North Z” seem to indicate Turks; and what is more, these\ncolour distinctions–probably of clothing or head-gear-continue to\nquite modern times, and always in connection with Turks or Mongol-\nTurks. The fourth term “A” never occurs before the third century\nbefore Christ, and refers to all Tartars, Coreans, etc.; but not\nto Tibetans: it need not, therefore, be discussed at present. The\nmodern province of Sz Ch’wan was absolutely unknown even by name;\nbut several centuries later, as we shall shortly see, it turned\nout to be a state of considerable magnitude, with quite a little\nimperial history of its own: probably it was with this unknown\nstate that the bulk of the Tibetans tried conclusions, if they\ntried them with China at all.",
        "Be that as it may, the present wish is to make clear that at the\nfirst great turning-point in genuine Chinese history the whole of\nnorth and west China was in the hands of totally unknown powers,\nwho completely shut in the Middle Kingdom; who only manifested\nthemselves at all in the shape of occasional bodies of raiders;\nand who, if they had any knowledge, direct or indirect, of India,\nTibet, Turkestan, Siberia, Persia, etc., kept it strictly to\nthemselves, and in any case were incapable of communicating it in\nwriting to the frontier Chinese populations of the four buffer\nstates above enumerated.",
        "But the collapse of the imperial power in 771 B.C. led to\nrestlessness in the south as well as in the north, north-western,\nand north-eastern regions: except for a few Chinese adventurers\nand colonists, these were exclusively inhabited by nomad Tartars,\nand perhaps some Tibetans, destitute of fixed residences, cities,\nand towns; ignorant of cultivation, agriculture, and letters; and\nroving about from pasture to pasture with their flocks and herds,\nfinding excitement and diversion chiefly in periodical raids upon\ntheir more settled southern and western neighbours.",
        "The only country south of the federated Chinese princes in Ho Nan\nprovince (as we now call it) was the “Jungle” or “Thicket,” a term\nwhich vaguely designated the lower waters of the Han River system,\nmuch as, with ourselves, the “Lowlands” or the “Netherlands” did,\nand still does, designate the outlying marches of the English and\nGerman communities. “Jungle” is still the elegant literary name\nfor Hu Peh, just as Ts’in, Tsin, and Ts’i are for Shen Si, Shan\nSi, and Shan Tung. The King of the Jungle, like the Warden of the\nWestern Marches, traced his descent far back to the same ancient\nmonarchs whose blood ran also in the veins of the imperial house\nof Chou; and moreover this Jungle King’s ancestors had served the\nfounders of the Chou dynasty in 1150 B.C., whilst they were still\nhesitating whether to accept the call to empire: hence in later\ntimes (530 B.C.) the King made it a grievance that his family had\nnot received from the founder of the Chou dynasty presents\nsymbolical of equality of birth, as had the Tsin and Lu (South\nShan Tung) houses. If any tribes, south, south-east, or south-west\nof this vague Jungle, whose administrative centre at first lay\nwithin a hundred miles’ radius of the modern treaty-port of\nIch’ang, were in any way known to Central China, or were affected\nby orthodox Chinese civilization, it was and must have been\nentirely through this kingdom of the Jungle, and in a second-hand\nor indirect way. The Jungle was as much a buffer to the south as\nTs’in was to the north-west, Tsin to the north, and Ts’i to the\nnorth-east. The bulk of the population was in one sense non-\nChinese; that is, it was probably a mixture of the many\nuncivilized mountain tribes (all speaking monosyllabic and tonic\ndialects like the Chinese) who still survive in every one of the\nprovinces south of the Yang-tsz Kiang; but the ruling caste, whose\nadministrative centre lay to the north of these tribes, though\naffected by the grossness of their barbarous surroundings, were\nmanifestly more or less orthodox Chinese in origin and sympathy,\nand, even at this early period (771 B.C.), possessed a considerable\nculture, a knowledge of Chinese script, and a general capacity\nto live a settled economical existence. As far back as 880 B.C.\nthe King of the Jungle is recorded to have governed or conciliated\nthe populations between the Han and the Yang-tsz Rivers; but,\nthough he arrogated to himself for a time the title of “Emperor” or\n\"King” in his own dominions, he confessed himself to be a barbarian,\nand disclaimed any share in the honorific system of titles, living or\nposthumous, having vogue in China, reserving it for his successors\nto assert higher rights when they should feel strong enough. Like\nan eastern Charlemagne, he divided his empire between his three\nsons; and this empire, which gradually extended all along the\nYang-tsz down to its mouths, may have included in one of its\nthree subdivisions a part at least of the Annamese race, as will be\nsuggested more in detail anon.",
        "The first really historical king, who once more arrogated the\nsupreme title in 704 B.C., took advantage of imperial weakness to\nextend his conquests not only to the south but to the north of the\nRiver Han, attacking petty Chinese principalities, and boldly\nclaiming recognition by the Emperor of equality in title. “I am a\nbarbarian,” said he, “and I will avail myself of the dissensions\namong the federal princes to inspect Chinese ways for myself.” The\nEmperor displayed some irritation at this claim of equal rank, but\nthe King retorted by referring to the services rendered by his\n(the King’s) ancestor, some five hundred years earlier, to the\nEmperor’s ancestor, virtual founder of the Chou dynasty. In 689\nB.C. the next king moved his capital from its old site above the\nIch’ang gorges to the commanding central situation now known as\nKing-thou Fu, just above the treaty-port of Sha-shi’: this place\nhistorically continues the use of the old word Jungle (King),\nand has been all through the present Manchu dynasty (1644-1908)\nthe military residence of a Tartar-General with a Banner garrison;\nthat is, a garrison of privileged Tartar soldiers living in cantonments,\nand exempt from the ordinary laws, or, at least, the application of\nthem. It is only in 684 B.C. that the Jungle state is first honoured\nwith mention in Confucius’ history: it was, indeed, impossible then\nto ignore its existence, because, for the first time in the annals\nof China, Chinese federal princes between the Han River and the\nwesternmost head-waters of the Hwai River had been deliberately\nannexed by these Jungle “barbarians.” History for the next 450 years\nfrom this date consists mainly of the intricate narration how Ts’in, Tsin,\nTs’i, and the Jungle struggled, first for hegemony, and finally for the\npossession of all China, The Jungle was now called Ts’u.",
        "Having now shown, as shortly and as intelligibly as we can, how\nthe germs of Chinese development were sown at the dawn of true\nhistory, let us proceed to examine how far that history, as it has\ncome down to us, contains within it testimony to its own truth. We\nshall revert to the description of wars and ambitions in due\ncourse; but, as so obscure a subject as early Chinese civilization\nis only palatable to most Western readers in small, varied, and\nsugared doses, we shall for the moment vary the nourishment\noffered, and say a few words upon eclipses.",
        "Confucius, whose bald “Spring and Autumn” annals, as expanded by\nthree separate commentators (one a junior contemporary of\nhimself), is really the chief authority for the period 722-468\nB.C., was born on the 20th day after the eclipse of the sun which\ntook place in the 10th month of 552 B.C., or the 27th of the 8th\nmoon as worked out to-day (for 1908 this means the 22nd\nSeptember). Confucius himself records thirty-seven eclipses of the\nsun between 720 and 481, those of 709, 601, and 549 being total.\nOf course, as Confucius primarily recorded the eclipses as seen\nfrom his own petty vassal state of Lu in Shan Tung province (lat.\n35” 40’ N., long, 117” E.), any one endeavouring to identify these\neclipses, and to compare them with Julian or Gregorian dates,\nmust, in making the necessary calculations, bear this important\nfact in mind. It so happens that nearly one-third of Confucius’\nthirty-seven eclipses are recorded as having taken place between\nthe two total eclipses of 601 and 549. This being so, I referred\nthe list to an obliging officer attached to the Royal Observatory,\nwho has kindly furnished me with the following comparative list:-",
        "It will be observed that there is no Oppolzer’s date to compare\nwith the first of the two eclipses of 552; this is because I\nomitted to notice that there had been recorded in the “Springs and\nAutumns” two so close together, and therefore I did not include it\nin the list sent to the Observatory; but with the exception of the\ntotal eclipse of 601, all the other eclipses, so far as days of\nthe moon and month go, are as consistent with each other as are\nmodern Chinese dates with European (Julian) dates. As regards the\nyear, Oppolzer’s dates are the “astronomical” dates, that is, the\nastronomical year–x is the same as the year (x + 1) B.C.; or, in\nother words, the year of Christ’s birth is, for certain\nastronomical exactitude purposes, interpolated between the years 1\nB.C. and A.D. 1, as we vulgarly compute them: that is to say, the\neclipses of the sun recorded 2,400 years ago by Confucius, from\nnotes and annals preserved in his native state’s archives as far\nback as 700 B.C., are found to be almost without exception fairly\ncorrect, with a uniform “error” of about one month, despite the\nfact that attempts were made by the First August Emperor to\ndestroy all historical literature in 213 B.C. This being so in the\nmatter of a dozen eclipses, there still remain two dozen for\nspecialists to experiment upon, not to mention comets and other\ncelestial phenomena. From this collateral evidence, imperfect\nthough it be, we are reasonably entitled to assume that the three\nexpanded versions of Confucius’ history are trustworthy, or at the\nvery least written in the best of faith.",
        "Just as our mathematicians find no difficulty either in\nforetelling or retrospecting eclipses to a minute, so does the\nancient “sixty” cycle, which the Chinese have from time immemorial\nused for computing or noting days and years, enable them, or for\nthe matter of that ourselves, to calculate back unerringly any\ndesired day. Thus, suppose the 1st January, 1908, is the 37th day\nof the perpetual cycle of sixty days; then, if the Chinese\nhistorians say that an eclipse took place on the first day of the\nnew moon, which began the 9th Chinese month of the year\ncorresponding in the main to our 800 B.C., and that the 1st day of\nthe moon was also the 37th day of the sixty-day perpetual cycle,\nall we have to do is to take roughly six cycles for each year, six\nthousand cycles for each thousand years, allowing at the same time\ntwo extra cycles every third year for intercalary moons, and then\ndealing with the fractions or balance of days. If our calculation\ndoes not bring the two 37th cyclic days together accurately, we\nmust of course go into the question of how and when the Chinese\ncalendars were altered, a subject that will be treated of in a\nsubsequent Chapter. It must be remembered that there can never be\nany question of so much as a whole year being involved in the\nbalance of error; for, with the Chinese as with us, one year,\nwhenever modified, always means that space of time, however\nirregularly computed at each end of it, within which two solstices\nand two equinoxes have taken place, Voltaire, in the article on\n\"China” of his Universal Dictionary, remarks that “of 32 ancient\nChinese eclipses, 28 have been identified by Western mathematicians\";\nand M. Edouard Chavannes, who has given a great deal of time\nand labour to working out the mysteries of the Chinese calendar,\ndoes not hesitate to claim accuracy to the very day (29th August)\nfor the eclipse of the sun recorded in the Book of Odes (as re-edited\nby Confucius) as having taken place on the 28th cyclic day of the\nbeginning of the both moon in 776 B.C. (i.e. of–775). This eclipse\nis of course not recorded in the “Springs and Autumns,” which\nbegins with the year 722 B.C.",
        "The Chou dynasty, which came into power in 1122, for the second\ntime put back the year a month because the calendar was getting\nconfused. That is, they made what we should call January begin the\nlegal year instead of February; or the still more ancient March;\nbut some of the vassals either used computations of their own, or\nkept up those handed down by the two dynasties previous to that of\nChou: hence in the Confucian histories, as expanded, there are\nfrequent discrepancies in consequence of events apparently copied\nfrom the records of one vassal state having been reported to the\nhistorian of a second vassal state without steps having been taken\nto adjust the different new years.",
        "As the struggle for pre-eminency which we are about to describe\ninvolved bloodthirsty combats extending almost uninterruptedly\nover five centuries, it may be of interest to inquire of what\nconsisted the paraphernalia of warfare in those days. It appears\nthat among the Chinese federal princes, who, as we have seen, only\noccupied in the main the flat country on the right bank of the\nYellow River, war-chariots were invariably used, which is the more\nremarkable in that after the Conquest in 220 B.C. of China by the\nFirst August Emperor of Ts’in, and down to this day, war-chariots\nhave scarcely ever once been even named, at least as having been\nmarshalled in serious battle array. The Emperor alone was supposed\nin true feudal times to possess a force of 10,000 chariots, and\neven now a “10,000-chariot” state is the diplomatic expression\nfor “a great power,” “a power of the first rank,” or “an empire.\"\nNo vassal was entitled to more than 1000 war-chariots. In the\nyear 632 B.C., when Tsin inflicted a great defeat upon its chief\nrival Ts’u, the former power had 700 chariots in the field. In 589\nB.C. the same country, with 800 chariots included in its forces,\nmarched across the Yellow River and defeated the state of Ts’i,\nits rival to the east. Again in 632 Tsin offered to the Emperor\n100 chariots just captured from Ts’u, and in 613 sent 800 chariots\nto the assistance of a dethroned Emperor. The best were made of\nleather, and we may assume from this that the wooden ones found it\nvery difficult to get safely over rough ground, for in a\ncelebrated treaty of peace of 589 B.C. between the two rival\nstates Tsin and Ts’i, the victor, lying to the west, imposed a\ncondition that “your ploughed furrows shall in future run east and\nwest instead of north and south,” meaning that “no systematic\nobstacles shall in future be placed in the way of our invading\nchariots.”",
        "One of the features in many of the vassal states was the growth of\ngreat families, whose private power was very apt to constrain the\nwishes of the reigning duke, count, or baron. Thus in the year\n537, when the King of Ts’u was meditating a treacherous attack\nupon Tsin, he was warned that “there were many magnates at the\nbehest of the ruler of Tsin, each of whom was equal to placing 100\nwar-chariots in the field.” So much a matter of course was it to\nuse chariots in war, that in the year 572, when the rival great\npowers of Ts’u and Tsin were contesting for suzerainty over one of\nthe purely Chinese principalities in the modern Ho Nan province,\nit was considered quite a remarkable fact that this principality\nin taking the side of Ts’u brought no chariots with the forces led\nagainst Tsin. In 541 a refugee prince of Ts’u, seeking asylum in\nTsin, only brought five chariots with him, on which the ruler,\nashamed as host of such a poor display, at once assigned him\nrevenue sufficient for the maintenance of 100 individuals. It so\nhappened that at the same time there arrived in Tsin a refugee\nprince from Ts’in, bringing with him 1000 carts, all heavily\nladen. On another occasion the prince (not a ruler) of a\nneighbouring state, on visiting the ruler of another, brings with\nhim as presents an eight-horsed chariot for the reigning prince, a\nsix-horsed conveyance for the premier, a four-horsed carriage for\na very distinguished minister in the suite, and a two-horsed cart\nfor a minor member of the mission.",
        "Besides the heavy war-chariots, there were also rather more\ncomfortable and lighter conveyances: in one case two generals are\nspoken of ironically because they went to the front playing the\nbanjo in a light cart, whilst their colleague from another state–\nthe very state they were assisting–was roughing it in a war-\nchariot. These latter seem to have connoted, for military\norganization purposes, a strength of 75 men each, and four horses;\nto wit, three heavily armed men or cuirassiers in the chariot\nitself, and 72 foot-soldiers. At least in the case of Tsin, a\nforce of 37,500 men, which in the year 613 boldly marched off\nthree hundred or more English miles upon an eastern expedition, is\nso described. On the other hand, thirty years later, a small Ts’u\nforce is said to have had 125 men attached to each chariot, while\nthe Emperor’s chariots are stated to have had 100 men assigned to\neach. In the year 627 a celebrated battle was fought between the\nrival powers of Ts’in and Tsin, in which the former was utterly\nrouted; “not a man nor a wheel of the whole army ever got back.\"\nWar-chariots are mentioned as having been in use at least as far\nback as 1797 B.C. by the Tartar-affected ancestors of the Chou\ndynasty, nearly 700 years before they themselves came to the\nimperial power. The territory north of the River Wei, inhabited by\nthem, is all yellow loess, deeply furrowed by the stream in\nquestion, and by its tributaries: there is no apparent reason to\nsuppose that the gigantic cart-houses used by the Tartars, even to\nthis day, had any historical connection with the swift war-\nchariots of the Chinese.",
        "Little, if anything, is said of conveying troops by boat in any of\nthe above-mentioned countries north of the Yang-tsz River. None\nof the rivers in Shen Si are navigable, even now, for any\nconsiderable stretches, and the Yellow River itself has its strict\nlimitations. Later on, when the King of Ts’u’s possessions along\nthe sea coast, embracing the delta of the Yang-tsz, revolted from\nhis suzerainty and began (as we shall relate in due course) to\ntake an active part in orthodox Chinese affairs, boats and\ngigantic canal works were introduced by the hitherto totally\nunknown or totally forgotten coast powers; and it is probably\nowing to this innovation that war-chariots suddenly disappeared\nfrom use, and that even in the north of China boat expeditions\nbecame the rule, as indeed was certainly the case after the third\ncentury B.C.",
        "Some idea of the limited population of very ancient China may be\ngained from a consideration of the oldest army computations. The\nEmperor was supposed to have six brigades, the larger vassals\nthree, the lesser two, and the small ones one; but owing to the\nloose way in which a Shi, or regiment of 2,500 men, and a\nKun, or brigade of 12,500 men, are alternately spoken of,\nthe Chinese commentators themselves are rather at a loss to\nestimate how matters really stood after the collapse of the\nEmperor in 771: but though at much later dates enormous armies,\ncounting up to half a million men on each side, stubbornly\ncontended for mastery, at the period of which we speak there is no\nreason to believe that any state, least of all the imperial\nreserve, ever put more than 1000 chariots, or say, 75,000 men,\ninto the field on any one expedition.",
        "Flags seem to have been in use very much as in the West. The\nfounder of the Chou dynasty marched to the conquest of China\ncarrying, or having carried for him, a yellow axe in the left, and\na white flag in the right hand. In 660 one of the minor federal\nprinces was crushed because he did not lower his standard in time;\nnearly a century later, this precedent was quoted to another\nfederal prince when hard-pressed, in consequence of which a sub-\nofficer “rolled up his master’s standard and put it in its\nsheath.” In 645 “the cavaliers under the ruler’s flag “–defined\nto mean his body-guard–were surrounded by the enemy.",
        "During the fifth century B.C., when the coast provinces, having\nseparated from the Ts’u suzerainty, were asserting their equality\nwith the orthodox Chinese princes, and two rival “barbarian\"\narmies were contending for the Shanghai region, one royal scion\nwas indignant when he saw the enemy advance “with the flag\ncaptured in the last battle from his own father the general.\"\nFlags were used, not only to signal movements of troops during the\ncourse of battle, but also in the great hunts or battues which\nwere arranged in peace times, not merely for sport, but also in\norder to prepare soldiers for a military life.",
        "For victories over the Tartars in 623, the Emperor presented the\nruler of Ts’in with a metal drum; and it seems that sacrificing to\nthe regimental drum before a fight was a very ancient custom,\nwhich has been carried down to the present day. In 1900, during\nthe “Boxer” troubles, General (now Viceroy) Yiian Shi-k’ai is\nreported to have sacrificed several condemned criminals to his\ndrum before setting out upon his march.",

        "Before we enter into a categorical description of the hegemony or\nProtector system, under which the most powerful state for the time\nbeing held durbars “in camp,” and in theory maintained the shadowy\nrights of the Emperor, we must first introduce the two coast\nstates of the Yang-tsz delta, just mentioned as having asserted\ntheir independence of Ts’u, each state being in possession of one\nof the Great River branches, In ancient times the Yang-tsz was\nsimply called the Kiang (\"river”), just as the Yellow River\nwas simply styled the Ho (also “river”). In those days the\nGreat River had three mouths-the northernmost very much as at\npresent, except that the flat accretions did not then extend so\nfar out to sea, and in any case were for all practical purposes\nunknown to orthodox China, and entirely in the hands of “Eastern\nbarbarians\"; the southerly course, which branched off near the\nmodern treaty-port of Wuhu in An Hwei province, emerging into the\nsea at, or very near, Hangchow; and the middle course, which was\npractically the combined beds of the Soochow Creek and the Wusung\nRiver of Shanghai. Before the Chou dynasty came to power in 1122\nB.C., the grandfather of the future founder, as a youth, displayed\nsuch extraordinary talents, that, by family arrangement, his two\neldest brothers voluntarily resigned their rights, and exiled\nthemselves in the Jungle territory, subsequently working their way\neast to the coast, and adopting entirely, or in part, the rude\nways of the barbarous tribes they hoped to govern. We can\nunderstand this better if we picture how the Phoenician and Greek\nmerchants in turn acted when successively colonizing Marseilles,\nCadiz, and even parts of Britain. Excepting doubtful genealogies\nand lists of rulers, nothing whatever is heard of this colony\nuntil 585 B.C.–say, 800 years subsequent to the original\nsettlement. A malcontent of Ts’u had, as was the practice among\nthe rival states of those, times, offered his services to the\nhated Tsin, then engaged in desperate warfare with Ts’u: he\nproposed to his new master that he should be sent on a mission to\nthe King of Wu (for that was, and still is, for literary purposes,\nthe name of the kingdom comprising Shanghai, Soochow, and Nanking)\nin order to induce him to join in attacking Ts’u. “He taught them\nthe use of arrows and chariots,” from which we may assume that\nspears and boats were, up to that date, the usual warlike\napparatus of the coast power. Its capital was at a spot about\nhalf-way between Soochow and Nanking, on the new (British)\nrailway line; and it is described by Chinese visitors during the\nsixth century B.C. as being “a mean place, with low-built houses,\nnarrow streets, a vulgar palace, and crowds of boats and\nwheelbarrows.” The native word for the country was something like\nKeugu, which the Chinese (as they still do with foreign words, as,\nfor instance, Ying for “England”) promptly turned into a\nconvenient monosyllable Ngu, or Wu. The semi-barbarous King was\ndelighted at the opening thus given him to associate with orthodox\nChinese princes on an equal footing, and to throw off his former\ntyrannical suzerain. He annexed a number of neighbouring barbarian\nstates hitherto, like himself, belonging to Ts’u; paid visits to\nthe Emperor’s court, to the Ts’u court, and to the petty but\nhighly cultivated court of Lu (in South Shan Tung), in order to\n\"study the rites\"; and threw himself with zest into the whirl of\ninterstate political intrigue. Confucius in his history hardly\nalludes to him as a civilized being until the year 561, when the\nKing died; and as his services to China (i.e. to orthodox Tsin\nagainst unorthodox Ts’u) could not be ignored, the philosopher-\nhistorian condescends to say “the Viscount of Wu died this year.\"\nIt must be explained that the Lu capital had been celebrated for\nits learning ever since the founder of the Chou dynasty sent the\nDuke of Chou, his own brother, there as a satrap (1122 B.C.).\nConfucius, of course, wrote retrospectively, for he himself was\nonly born in 551 and did not compose his “Springs and Autumns\"\nhistory for at least half a century after that date. The old Lu\ncapital of K’uh-fu on she River Sz (both still so called) is the\nofficial headquarters of the Dukes Confucius, the seventy-sixth in\ndescent from the Sage having at this moment direct semi-official\nrelations with Great Britain’s representative at Wei-hai-wei. It\nmust also be explained that the vassal princes were all dukes,\nmarquises, earls, viscounts, or barons, according to the size of\ntheir states, the distinction of their clan or gens, and the\nlength of their pedigrees; but the Emperor somewhat contemptuously\naccorded only the courtesy title of “viscount” to barbarian\n\"kings,” such as those of Ts’u and Wu, very much as we vaguely\nspeak of “His Highness the Khedive,” or (until last year) “His\nHighness the Amir,” so as to mark unequality with genuine crowned\nor sovereign heads.",
        "The history of the wars between Wu and Ts’u is extremely\ninteresting, the more so in that there are some grounds for\nbelieving that at least some part of the Japanese civilization was\nsubsequently introduced from the east coast of China, when the\nruling caste of Wu, in its declining days, had to “take flight\neastwards in boats to the islands to the east of the coast.” But\nwe shall come to that episode later on. In the year 506 the\ncapital of Ts’u was occupied by a victorious Wu army, under\ncircumstances full of dramatic detail. But now, in the flush of\nsuccess, it was Wu’s turn to suffer from the ambition of a vassal.\nSouth of Wu, with a capital at the modern Shao-hing, near Ningpo,\nreigned the barbarian King of Yiieh (this is a corrupted\nmonosyllable supposed to represent a dissyllabic native word\nsomething like Uviet); and this king had once been a ’vassal of\nTs’u, but had, since Wu’s conquests, transferred, either willingly\nor under local compulsion, his allegiance to Wu. Advances were\nmade to him by Ts’u, and he was ultimately induced to declare war\nas an ally of Ts’u. There is nothing more interesting in our\nEuropean history than the detailed account, full of personal\nincident, of the fierce contests between Wu and Yiieh. The\nextinction of Wu took place in 483, after that state had played a\nvery commanding part in federal affairs, as we shall have occasion\nto specify in the proper places. Yiieh, in turn, peopled by a race\nsupposed to have ethnological connection with the Annamese of\nVietnam or “Southern Yiieh,” became a great power in China, and in\n468 even transferred its capital to a spot on or near the coast,\nvery near the German colony of Kiao Chou in Shan Tung. But its\npredominance was only successfully asserted on the coasts; to use\nthe historians’ words: “Yiieh could never effectively administer\nthe territory comprised in the Yang-tsz Kiang and Hwai River\nregions.”",
        "It was precisely during this barbarian struggle, when federated\nChina, having escaped the Tartars, seemed to be running the risk\nof falling into the clutches of southern pirates, that Confucius\nflourished, and it is in reference to the historical events\nsketched above-(1) the providential escape of China from\nTartardom, (2) the collapse of the imperial Chou house, (3) the\nhegemony or Protector system, (4) the triumph of might over rite\n(right and rite being one with Confucius), and (5) the desirability of\na prompt return to the good old feudal ways–that he abandoned\nhis own corrupt and ungrateful principality, began his peripatetic\nteaching in the other orthodox states, composed a warning history\nfull of lessons for future guidance, and established what we\nsomewhat inaccurately call a “religion” for the political guidance of\nmankind.",
        "The first of the so-called five hegemons or lords-protector of the\nfederated Chinese Empire (after the collapse of the imperial\npower, and its consequent incapacity to protect the vassal states\nfrom the raids of the Tartars and other barbarians) was the Lord\nof Ts’i, whose capital was at the powerful and wealthy city of\nLin-tsz (lat. 37o, long. 118o 30’; still so called on the modern\nmaps), in Shan Tung province. Neither the Yellow River nor the\nGrand Canal touched Shan Tung in those days, and Lin-tsz was\nevidently situated with reference to the local rivers which flow\nnorth into the Gulf of “Pechelee,” so as to take full political\nadvantage of the salt, mining, and fishing industries. A word is\nhere necessary as to this Protector’s pedigree: we have seen that\nhis ancestor, thirteen generations back, had inspired with his\ncounsels and courage the founder of the imperial Chou dynasty in\n1122 B.C.; he had further given to the new Emperor a daughter of\nhis own in marriage, had served him as premier, and had finally\nbeen enfeoffed in reward for his services as Marquess of Ts’i, the\neconomic condition of which far-eastern principality he had in a\nvery few years by his energy as ruler mightily improved, notably\nwith reference to the salt and fish industries, and to general\ncommerce. The Yellow River, then flowing along the bed of what is\nnow called the Chang River, and the sea, respectively, were the\nwestern and eastern limits of this state, which embraced to the\nnorth the salt flats now under the administration of a special\nTientsin Commissioner, and extended south to the present Manchu\nTartar-General’s military garrison at Ts’ing-thou Fu. Of course,\nlater on, during the five-hundred-year period of unrest,\nextensions and cessions of territory frequently took place, both\nwithin and beyond these vague limits, usually at the expense of Lu\nand other small orthodox states. Across the Yellow River, whose\ncourse northwards, as already stated, lay considerably to the west\nof the present channel, was the extensive state of Tsin; and south\nwas the highly ritual and literary Weimar of China, the unwarlike\nprincipality of Lu, destined in future times to be glorified by\nConfucius.",
        "Scarcely anything is recorded of a nature to throw specific light\nupon the international development of these far-eastern parts. But\nin the year 894 B.C. the reigning prince of Ts’i was boiled alive\nat the Emperor’s order for some political offence, and his\nsuccessor thereupon moved his capital, only to be transferred back\nto the old place by his son thirty-five years later. The imperial\nflight of 842 naturally caused some consternation even in distant\nTs’i, and in 827 the next Emperor on his accession commanded the\nreigning Marquess of Ts’i to assist in chastising the Western\nTartars. When this last Emperor’s grandson was driven from his old\nhereditary domain in 771, and the semi-Tartar ruler of Ts’in took\npossession of the same, as already narrated, Ts’i was still so\ninconsiderable a military power that even two generations after\nthat event, in the year 706, it was fain to apply for assistance\nagainst Northern Tartar raids to one of the small Chinese\nprincipalities in the Ho Nan province. (Roughly speaking,\n\"Northern Tartars” were Manchu-Mongols, and “Western Tartars” were\nMongol-Turks.) In 690 the prince, whose sister had married the\nneighbouring ruler of Lu, made an armed attack by way of vengeance\nupon the descendant of the adviser who had counselled the Emperor\nto boil his ancestor alive in 894: his power was now so\nconsiderable that the Emperor commissioned him to act with\nauthority in the matter of a disputed succession to a minor\nChinese principality. This was in the year 688 B.C., and it was\nthe first instance of a vassal acting as dictator or protector on\nbehalf of the Emperor; only, however, in a special or isolated\ncase. Two years later this prince of Ts’i was himself assassinated,\nand the disputes between his sons regarding the succession\nterminated with the advent to the throne of one of the great\ncharacters in Chinese history, who was magnanimous and politic\nenough to take as his adviser and premier a still greater character,\nand one that almost rivals Confucius himself in fame as an author,\na statesman, a benefactor of China; and a moralist.",
        "This personage, who, like most Chinese of the period, carried many\nnames, is most generally known as the philosopher Kwan-tsz, and\nhis chief writings have survived, in part at least, until our own\nday. He was, in fact, a distant scion of the reigning imperial\nfamily of Chou, and bore its clan name of Ki. Here it may\nbe useful to state parenthetically that most prominent men in all\nthe federated states seem to have belonged to a narrow aristocratic\ncircle, among whose members the craft of government, the\nknowledge of letters, and the hereditary right to expect office,\nwas inherent; at the same time, there was never at any date\nanything in the shape of a priestly or military caste, and power\nappears to have been always within the reach of the humblest,\nso long as the aspirant was competent to assert himself.",
        "The new ruler of Ts’i officially proclaimed himself Protector in\nthe year 679 B.C., which is one of the fixed dates in Chinese\nhistory about which there is no cavil or doubt, He soon found\nhimself embroiled in war with the Tartars, who were raiding both\nthe state to his north in the Peking plain, and also the minor\nstate, south of the Yellow River, that his predecessor has\nprotected specially in 688. This was the state of Wei (imperial\nclan), through or near the capital town of which, near the modern\nWei-hwei Fu, the Yellow River then ran northwards.",
        "The way these successive Protectors of China afterwards exercised\ntheir preponderant influence in a general sense was this: When it\nappeared to them, or when any orthodox vassal state complained to\nthem, that injustice was being done; whether in matters of duty to\nthe Emperor, right of succession, legitimacy of birth, great\ncrime, or inordinate ambition; the recognized Protector summoned a\ndurbar, usually somewhere within the territory of the central\narea, or China proper as previously defined, and consulted with\nthe princes, his colleagues, as to what course should be pursued.\nA distinction was drawn between “full-dress durbars” and “military\ndurbars\"; the etiquette in either case was very minute, and\nexternal behaviour at least was exquisitely courteous, though\ntreachery was far from rare, and treaties never lasted long\nunbroken. But to return to the First Protector. Towards the end of\nhis glorious reign of forty-three years the Marquess of Ts’i grew\narrogant, vainglorious, and licentious, so much so that his\nwestern neighbour, the powerful state of Tsin, declined to attend\nthe durbars. Of the other great powers Ts’in (to the west of Tsin)\nwas much too far off to take active part in these parliaments;\nTs’u was too busy in spreading civilization among the barbarous\nstates or tribes south of the Yang-tsz. The Emperor was\npractically a roi faineant by this time, and, curiously\nenough, less is known of what went on within his dominions or\nappanage after the western half of it fell to Ts’in in 771, than\nof what transpired in the territories of his three menacing\nvassals to the north, north-west, and north-east, and of his half-\ncivilized satrap to the south. The fact is, all four rising powers\nwere now carefully engaged in watching each other, and in playing\na profound political game around their prey. This prey was the\neastern half of the Emperor’s original domain (the western half\nnow, since 771 B.C., belonging to Ts’in) and the dozen or so of\npurely Chinese, highly cultured, vassal states making up the rest\nof modern Ho Nan province, together with small parts or wedges of\nmodern Chih Li, Shan Tung, An Hwei, and Kiang Su. From first to\nlast none of these ritual and literary states showed any real\nfight; there is hardly a single record of a really crushing\nvictory gained by any one of them. The fighting instincts all lay\nwith the new Chinese, that is, with the Chinese adventurers who\nhad got their hand well in with generations of fighting against\nbarbarians–Tartars, Tunguses, Annamese, Shans, and what not–and\nhad invigorated themselves with good fresh barbarian blood. The\nfact is, the population of China had enormously increased; the\nstruggle for life and food was keener; the old patriarchal\nappetite for ritual was disappearing; the people were beginning to\nassert themselves against the land-owners; the land-owners were\nencroaching upon the power of the ruling princes; and China was in\na parlous state.",
        "It was a fixed rule in ancient China that envoys should be treated\nwith courtesy, and that their persons should be held sacred,\nwhether at residential courts, in durbar, or on the road through a\nthird state. During the wars of the sixth century B.C. between\nTsin in the north and Ts’u in the south, when these two powers\nwere rival aspirants to the Protectorate of the original and\northodox group of principalities lying between them, and were\nalternately imposing their will on the important and diplomatic\nminor Chinese state of CHENG (still the name of a territory in Ho\nNan), there were furnished many illustrations of this recognized\nrule. The chief reason for thus making a fighting-ground of the\nold Chinese principalities was that it was almost impossible for\nTs’u to get conveniently at any of the three great northern\npowers, and equally difficult for Ts’in, Tsin, and Ts’i to reach\nTs’u, without passing through one or more Chinese states, mostly\nbearing the imperial clan name, and permission had to be asked for\nan army to pass through, unless the said Chinese state was under\nthe predominancy of (for instance) Tsin or Ts’u. It was like\nGermany and Italy with Switzerland between them, or Germany and\nSpain with France between them. Another important old Chinese\nstate was Sung, lying to the east of CHENG. Both these states were\nof the highest caste, the Earl of CHENG being a close relative of\nthe Chou Emperor, and the Duke of Sung being the representative or\nreligious heir of the remains of the Shang dynasty ousted by the\nChou family in I 122 B.C., magnanimously reinfeoffed “in order\nthat the family sacrifices might not be entirely cut off” together\nwith the loss of imperial sway. In the year 595 B.C. Sung went so\nfar as to put a Ts’u envoy to death, naturally much to the wrath\nof the rising southern power. Ts’u in turn arrested the Tsin envoy\non his way to Sung, and tried in vain to force him to betray his\ntrust. In 582 Tsin, in a fit of anger, detained the CHENG envoy,\nand finally put him to death for his impudence in coming\nofficially to visit Tsin after coquetting with Tsin’s rival Ts’u.\nAll these irregular cases are severely blamed by the historians.\nIn 562 Ts’u turned the tables upon Tsin by putting the CHENG envoy\nto death after the latter had concluded a treaty with Tsin.\nConfucius joins, retrospectively of course, in the chorus of\nuniversal reprobation. In 560 Ts’u tried to play upon the Ts’i\nenvoy a trick which in its futility reminds us strongly of the\nanalogous petty humiliations until recently imposed by China,\nwhenever convenient occasion offered, upon foreign officials\naccredited to her. The Ts’i envoy, who was somewhat deformed in\nperson, was no less an individual than the celebrated philosopher\nYen-tsz, a respected acquaintance of Confucius (though, of course,\nmuch his senior), and second only to Kwan-tsz amongst the great\nadministrative statesmen of Ts’i. The half-barbarous King of Ts’u\nconcocted with his obsequious courtiers a nice little scheme for\nhumiliating the northern envoy by indicating to him the small door\nprovided for his entry into the presence, such as the Grand\nSeigneurs in their hey-day used to provide for the Christian\nambassadors to Turkey. Yen-tsz, of course, at once saw through\nthis contemptible insult and said: “My master had his own reasons\nfor selecting so unworthy an individual as myself for this\nmission; yet if he had sent me on a mission to a dog-court, I\nshould have obeyed orders and entered by a dog-gate: however, it\nso happens that I am here on a mission to the King of Ts’u, and of\ncourse I expect to enter by a gate befitting the status of that\nruler.” Still another prank was tried by the foolish king: a\n\"variety entertainment” was got up, in which one scene represented\na famished wretch who was being belaboured for some reason.\nNaturally every one asked: “What is that?” The answer was: “A Ts’i\nman who has been detected in thieving.”  Yen-tsz said: “I\nunderstand that the best fruits come from Ts’u, and they say we\nnorthern men cannot come near the quality of their peaches. We are\nhonest simpletons, too, and do not look natural on the variety\nstage as thieves. The true rogue, like the true peach, is a\nsouthern speciality. I did see rogues on the stage, it is true,\nbut none of them looked like a Ts’i man; hence I asked, ’What is\nit?’” The king laughed sheepishly, and, for a time at least, gave\nup taking liberties with Yen-tsz.",
        "In 545, when Ts’u for the moment had the predominant say over\nCHENG’s political action, it was insisted that the ruler of CHENG\nshould come in person to pay his respects: this was after a great\nPeace Conference, held at Sung, on which occasion Tsin and Ts’u\narranged a modus operandi for their respective subordinate\nor allied vassals. There was no help for it, and the Earl\naccordingly went. The minister in attendance was Tsz-ch’an-a very\ngreat name indeed in Chinese history; he was a lawyer, statesman,\n\"democratic conservative,” sceptic, and philosopher, deeply\nlamented on his death alike by the people of CHENG, and by his\nfriend or correspondent Confucius of Lu state. The Chinese\ndiplomats then, as now, had the most roundabout ways of pointing a\nmoral or delicately insinuating an innuendo. On arrival at the\noutskirts of the capital, instead of building the usual dais for\nformalities and sacrifices, Tsz-ch’an threw up a mean hut for the\naccommodation of his mission, saying: “Altars are built by great\nstates when they visit small ones as a symbol of benefits\naccorded, and by way of exhortation to continue in virtuous ways.\"\nFour years later Ts’u sent a mission of menacing size to CHENG,\nostensibly to complete the carrying out of a marriage agreed upon\nby treaty between Ts’u and CHENG. Tsz-ch’an insisted that the bows\nand arrows carried by the escort should be left outside the city\nwalls, adding: “Our poor state is too small to bear the full\nhonour of such an escort; erect your altar dais outside the wall\nfor the service of the ancestral sacrifices, and we will there\nawait your commands about the marriage.”",
        "In 538, when Ts’u was, for the first time, holding a durbar as\nrecognized Protector, being at the time, however, on hostile terms\nwith her former vassal, Wu, the King of Ts’u committed the gross\noutrage of seizing the ruler of a petty state, who was then\npresent at the durbar, because that ruler had married (being\nhimself of eastern barbarian descent) a princess of Wu. The\nfollowing year, when two very distinguished statesmen from the\nterritory of his secular enemy Tsin came on a political mission,\nthe King of Ts’u consulted his premier about the advisability of\ncastrating the one for a harem eunuch, and cutting off the feet of\nthe other for a door-porter. “Your Majesty can do it, certainly,\"\nwas the reply, “but how about the consequences?” This was the\noccasion, mentioned in Chapter VI., on which the king was reminded\nhow many great private families there were in Tsin quite capable\nof raising a hundred chariots apiece.",
        "It appears that envoys, at least in Lu, were hereditary in some\nfamilies, just as other families provided successive generations\nof ministers. A Lu envoy to Tsin, who carried a very valuable gem-\nstudded girdle with him, had very great pressure put upon him by a\ncovetous Tsin minister who wanted the girdle. The envoy offered to\ngive some silk instead, but he said that not even to save his life\nwould he give up the girdle. The Tsin magnate thought better of\nit; but it is remarkable how many cases of sordid greed of this\nkind are recorded, all pointing to the comparative absence of\ncommercial exchanges, or standards of value between the feudal\nstates.",
        "Ts’u seems to have thoroughly deserved Yen-tsz’s imputations of\ntreachery and roguery. At the great Peace Conference held outside\nthe Sung capital in 546, the Ts’u escort was detected wearing\ncuirasses underneath their clothing. One of the greatest of the\nTsin statesmen, Shuh Hiang (a personal friend of Yen-tsz,\nConfucius, and Tsz-ch’an) managed diplomatically to keep down the\nrising indignation of the other powers and representatives present\nby pooh-poohing the clumsy artifice on the ground that by such\ntreachery Ts’u simply injured her own reputation in the federation\nto the manifest advantage of Tsin: it did not suit Tsin to\ncontinue the struggle with Ts’u just then. Then there was a\nsquabble as to precedence at the same Peace Conference; that is,\nwhether Tsin or Ts’u had the first right to smear lips with the\nblood of sacrifice: here again Shuh Hiang tactfully gave way, and\nby his conciliatory conduct succeeded in inducing the federal\nprinces to sign a sort of disarmament agreement. This is one of\nthe numerous instances in which Confucius as an annalist tries to\nmenager the true facts in the interests of orthodoxy.",
        "Even the more fully civilized state of Ts’i attempted an act of\ngross treachery, when in 500 B.C. the ruler of Lu, accompanied by\nConfucius as his minister in attendance, went to pay his respects.\nBut Confucius was just as sharp as Yen-tsz and Tsz-ch’an, his\nfriends, neighbours, and colleagues: he at once saw through the\nmenacing appearance of the barbarian “dances” (introduced here,\nagain, as a “variety entertainment”), and by his firm behaviour\nnot only saved the person of his prince, but shamed the ruler of\nTs’i into disclaiming and disavowing his obsequious fellow-\npractical jokers. Yen-tsz was actually present at the time, in\nattendance upon his own marquis; but it is nowhere alleged that he\nwas responsible for the disgraceful manoeuvre. As a result T’si\nwas obliged to restore to Lu several cities and districts\nwrongfully annexed some years before, and Lu promised to assist\nTs’i in her wars.",

        "1. The River Sz still starts at Sz-shui (cross in circle; means\n\"River Sz”), and runs past Confucius’ town, K’iih-fu, into the\nCanal in two branches. But in Confucius’ time what is now the\nCanal continued to be the River Sz, down to its junction with the\nHwai. The River I starts still from I-shui (also a cross in\ncircle; means “River I”), passes I-thou, and used to join the Sz\n(now the Canal) at the lower cross in a circle. The neck (dotted)\nof the Hwai embouchure no longer exists, and the Lake Hung-tseh\nnow dissipates itself into lakelets and canals. The Wu fleets, by\nsailing up the Hwai, Sz, and I, could get up to Lu, and threaten\nTs’i.",
        "2. In Confucius’ time the Yellow River turned north near the\njunction of the Emperor’s territory with Cheng: it passed through\nWei, and there divided. Its main branch, after coursing through\npart of the River Wei bed, left it and took possession of the\nRiver Chang bed. Up to 602 B.C. the secondary branch took the more\neasterly dotted line (the present Yellow River, once the River\nTsi); but after 602 B.C. it cut through Hing, followed the Wei,\nand took the line of the present Canal. Hing was a Tartar-harried\nstate contested by Ts’i and Tsin: it fell at last to Tsin.",
        "3. The capitals of Ts’i, Wei, Ts’ao, Cheng, Sung, Ch’en, Ts’ai\n(three) are marked with encircled crosses. K’iih-fu, the capital\nof Lu, is marked with a small circle. In 278 B.C. the Ts’u capital\nwas moved east to Ch’en. In 241 B.C., under pressure of Ts’in, the\nTs’u capital had to be moved to the double black cross on the\nsouth bank of the Hwai.]",
        "We must now go back a little. The first of the so-called Five\nTyrants, or the Five successive Protectors of orthodox China, had\ndied in 643, his philosopher and friend, Kwan-tsz, having departed\nthis life a little before him. Their joint title to fame lies in\nthe fact that “they saved China from becoming a Tartar province,\"\nand even Confucius admits the truth of this–a most important\nfactor in enabling us to understand the motive springs of Chinese\npolicy. Under these circumstances the Duke of Sung, who, as we\nhave seen, had special moral pretensions to leadership on account\nof his being the direct lineal representative of the Shang dynasty\nwhich perished in 1122 B.C., immediately put forward a claim to\nthe hegemony. He rather prejudiced his reputation, however, by\ncommitting the serious ritual offence of “warring upon Ts’i’s\nmourning,” that is, of engaging the allies in hostilities with the\nlate Protector’s own country whilst his body lay unburied, and his\nsons were still wrangling over the question of succession. The\nTartars, however, came to the rescue of, and made a treaty with,\nTs’i–this is only one of innumerable instances which show how the\nnorthern Chinese princes of those early days were in permanent\npolitical touch with the horse-riding nomads. The orthodox Duke of\nSung, dressed in his little brief authority as Protector, had the\ntemerity to “send for” the ruler of Ts’u to attend his first\ndurbar. (It must be remembered that the “king” in his own\ndominions was only “viscount” in the orthodox peerage of ruling\nprinces.) The result was that the King unceremoniously took his\nwould-be protector into custody at the durbar, and put in a claim\nto be Protector himself. During the military operations connected\nwith this political manoeuvre, the Duke of Sung was guilty of the\nmost ridiculous piece of ritual chivalry; highly approved, it is\ntrue, by the literary pedants of all subsequent ages, but ruinous\nto his own worldly cause. The Ts’u army was crossing a difficult\nford, and the Duke’s advisers recommended a prompt attack. “It is\nnot honourable,” said the Duke, “to take advantage even of an\nenemy in distress.” “But,” said his first adviser, “war is war,\nand its only object is to punish the foe as severely and promptly\nas possible, so as to gain the upper hand, and establish what you\nare fighting for.”",
        "Meanwhile important events had been going on in the marquisate of\nTsin, which, during the thirty-five years’ hegemony of Ts’i, had\nbeen engaged in extending its territory in all directions, in\nfighting Ts’in, and in annexing bordering Tartar tribes. At its\ngreatest development Tsin practically comprised all between the\nYellow River in its turns south, east, and north; but, though\nprobably half its population was Tartar, it never ceased to be\n\"orthodox” in administrative principle. The energetic but\nlicentious ruler of Tsin had married a Tartar wife in addition to\nhis more legitimate spouse (daughter of the late Protector,\nMarquess of Ts’i); or, rather, he took two wives, the one being\nsister of the other, but the younger sister brought him no\nchildren. Before this he had already married two sisters of quite\na different Tartar tribe, and each of his earlier wives had\nbrought him a son. His last pair of Tartar lady-loves gained such\na strong hold upon his affections that he was induced by the\nmother, being the elder sister of the two, to nominate her own son\nas his heir to the exclusion of the three elder brethren, who were\nsent on various flimsy pretexts to defend the northern frontiers\nagainst the more hostile Tartars. To complicate matters, the\nMarquess’s legitimate or first spouse, the Ts’i princess, besides\nbearing a son, had also given him a daughter, who had married the\npowerful ruler of Ts’in to the west. Thus not only were Ts’in and\nTsin both half-Tartar in origin and sympathy, but at this period\nthree out of four of the Tsin possible heirs were actually sons of\nTartar women. The legitimate heir, whose mother was of Ts’i\norigin, and, who himself was a man of very high character, ended\nthe question so far as he was concerned, by committing dutiful\nsuicide; the three sons by Tartar mothers succeeded to the throne\none after the other, but in the inverse order of their respective\nages. The story of the wanderings of the eldest brother, who did\nnot come to the throne until he was sixty-two years of age, is one\nof the most interesting and romantic episodes in the whole history\nof China; and, even with the unfamiliar proper names, would make a\ncapital romantic novel, so graphically and naturally are some of\nthe scenes depicted. First he threw himself heart and soul into\nTartar life, joined the rugged horsemen in their internecine wars,\nmarried a Tartar wife, and gave her sister to his most faithful\nhenchman; then, hearing of the death of the Ts’i premier, Kwan-\ntsz, he vowed he would go to Ts’i and try to act as political\nadviser in his place. Hospitably received by the Marquess of Ts’i,\nhe was presented with a charming and sensible Ts’i princess, who\nfor five years exercised so enervating an influence upon his\nvirility, ambition, and warlike ardour, that he had to be\nsurreptitiously smuggled away from the gay Ts’i capital whilst\ndrunk, by his Tartar father-in-law and by his chief Chinese\nhenchman and brother-in-law. Then he commenced a series of visits\nto the petty orthodox courts which separated Ts’i from Ts’u.\nSeveral of them were rude and neglectful to this unfortunate\nprince in distress; but Sung was an exception, for Sung ambition,\nas above narrated, had been roughly checked by Ts’u, and Sung now\nwished to make overtures to Tsin instead, and to conciliate a\nprince who was as likely as not to come to the throne of Tsin. In\n637 the prince reached the court of Ts’u, whose ruler had quite\nrecently begun to take formal and official rank as a “civilized\"\nfederal prince. Meanwhile, news came that his brother (by his own\nmother’s younger sister) was dead; this younger brother had taken\nrefuge in Ts’in during the reign of his youngest brother (the one\nborn of the last Tartar favourite), and had, after that brother’s\ndeath, been most generously assisted to the throne in turn by the\nruler of Ts’in, on the understanding, however, that Tsin should\ncede to Ts’in all territory on the right bank of the Yellow River,\ni.e. in the modern province of Shen Si: but the new Tsin ruler had\nbeen persuaded by his courtiers to go back on this humiliating\nbargain, in consequence of which war had been declared by Ts’in\nupon Tsin, and the faithless ruler of Tsin had been for some time\na prisoner of war in Ts’in; but, regaining his throne through the\ninfluence of his half-sister, the wife of the Ts’in ruler, had\ndied in harness in 637 B.C. This deceased ruler’s young son was\nnot popular, and Ts’in was now instrumental in welcoming the\nrefugee back from Ts’u, and in leading him in triumph, after\nnineteen years of adventurous wandering, to his own ancestral\nthrone; his rival and nephew was killed.",
        "All orthodox China seemed to feel now that the interesting\nwanderer, after all his experiences of war, travel, Tartars,\nChinese, barbarians, and politics, was the right man to be\nProtector. But it was first necessary for Tsin to defeat Ts’u in a\ndecisive battle; a war had arisen between Tsin and Ts’u out of an\nattempt on the part of CHENG (one of the orthodox Chinese states\nthat had been uncivil to the wanderer), to drag in the preponderant\npower of Ts’u by way of shielding itself from punishment at Tsin’s\nhands for past rude behaviour. The Emperor sent his own son to\nconfer the status of “my uncle” upon him,–which is practically\nanother way of saying “Protector” to a kinsman,–and in the year\n632 accordingly a grand durbar was held, in which the Emperor\nhimself took part. The Tsin ruler, who had summoned the durbar,\nand had even “commanded the presence” of the Emperor, was the\nguiding spirit of the meeting in every respect, except in the nominal\nand ritualistic aspect of it; nevertheless, he was prudent and careful\nenough scrupulously to observe all external marks of deference,\nand to make it appear that he was merely acting as mouthpiece to\n the puppet Emperor; he even went the length of dutifully offering\nto the Emperor some Ts’u prisoners, and the Emperor in turn “graciously\nceded” to Tsin the imperial possessions north of the Yellow River.\nThus Ts’in and Tsin each in turn clipped the wings of the Autocrat\nof All the Chinas, so styled.",
        "During these few unsettled years between the death of the first\nreal Protector in 643 and the formal nomination by the Emperor of\nthe second in 632, Ts’u and Sung had, as we have seen, both\nattempted to assert their rival claims. A triangular war had also\nbeen going on for some time between Ts’i and Ts’u, the bone of\ncontention being some territory of which Ts’i had stripped Lu; and\nthere was war also between Tsin and Ts’i, Tsin and Ts’in, and Tsin\nand Ts’u, which latter state always tried to secure the assistance\nof Ts’in when possible. From first to last, there never was,\nduring the period covered by Confucius’ history, any serious war\nbetween Tartar Ts’in and barbarian Ts’u; rather were they natural\nallies against orthodox China, upon which intermediate territory\nthey both learned to fix covetous eyes.",
        "The situation is too involved, in view of the uncouthness of\nstrange names and the absence of definite frontiers–changing as\nthey did with the result of each few years’ campaigning–to make\nit possible to give a full, or even approximately intelligible,\nexplanation of each move. But the following main features are\nincontestable:–Ts’in, Tsin, Ts’i, and Ts’u were growing,\nprogressive, and aggressive states, all of them strongly tinged\nwith foreign blood, which foreign blood was naturally assimilated\nthe more readily in proportion to the power, wealth, and culture\nof the assimilating orthodox nucleus. The imperial domain was an\nextinct political volcano, belching occasional fumes of\nthreatening, sometimes noxious, but not ever fatally suffocating\nsmoke, always without fire. “The Hia,” that is, the federation of\nprinces belonging to pure Hia, or (as we now say) “Chinese” stock,\nwere evidently unwarlike in proportion to the absence of foreign\nblood in their veins; but they were all of them equally\nruses, and all of them past-masters in casuistic diplomacy.\nTrade, agriculture, literature, and even law, were now quite\nactive, and (as we shall gradually see in these short Chapters)\nChina was undoubtedly beginning to move, as, after 2500 years of a\nsecond “ritual” sleep, she is again now moving, at the beginning\nof the twentieth century A.D.",
        "All through these five centuries of struggle, between the flight\nof the Emperor with the transfer of the metropolis in 771 B.C.,\nand the total destruction of the feudal system by the First August\nEmperor of Ts’in in 221 B.C., it is of supreme interest to note\nthat religion in our Western sense was not only non-existent\nthroughout China, but had not yet even been conceived of as an\nabstract notion; apart, that is to say, from government, public\nlaw, family law, and class ritual. No word for “religion” was\nknown to the language; the notion of Church or Temple served by a\npriestly caste had not entered men’s minds. Offences against “the\ngods” or “the spirits,” in a vague sense, were often spoken of;\nbut, on the other hand, too much belief in their power was\nregarded as superstition. “Sin” was only conceivable in the sense\nof infraction of nature’s general laws, as symbolized and\nspecialized by imperial commands; direct, or delegated to vassal\nprinces; in both cases as representatives, supreme or local, of\nHeaven, or of the Emperor Above, whose Son the dynastic central\nruler for the time being was figuratively supposed to be. No\nvassal prince ever presumed to style himself “Son of Heaven,\"\nthough nearly all the barbarous vassals called themselves “King\"\n(the only other title the Chou monarchs took) in their own\ndominions. “In the Heaven there can only be one Sun; on Earth\nthere can only be one Emperor\"; this was the maxim, and, ever\nsince the Chou conquest in 1122 B.C., the word “King” had done\nduty for the more ancient “Emperor,” which, in remote times had\napparently not been sharply distinguished in men’s minds from God,\nor the “Emperor on High.”",
        "Prayer was common enough, as we shall frequently see, and\nsacrifice was universal; in fact, the blood of a victim was almost\ninseparable from solemn function or record of any kind. But such\nideas as conscience, fear of God, mortal sin, repentance,\nabsolution, alms-giving, self-mortification, charity, sackcloth\nand ashes, devout piety, praise and glorification,–in a word,\nwhat the Jews, Christians, Mussulmans, and even Buddhists have\neach in turn conceived to be religious duty, had no well-defined\nexistence at all. There are some traces of local or barbarous gods\nin the semi-Turkish nation of Ts’in, before it was raised to the\nstatus of full feudal vassal; and also in the semi-Annamese nation\nof Ts’u (with its dependencies Wu and Yiieh); but the orthodox\nChinese proper of those times never had any religion such as we\nnow conceive it, whatever notions their remote ancestors may have\nconceived.",
        "Notwithstanding this, the minds of the governing classes at least\nwere powerfully restrained by family and ancestral feeling, and,\nif there were no temples or priests for public worship, there were\ninvariably shrines dedicated to the ancestors, with appropriate\nrites duly carried out by professional clerks or reciters.\nWhenever a ruler of any kind undertook any important expedition or\npossible duty, he was careful first to consult the oracles in\norder to ascertain the will of Heaven, and then to report the fact\nto the manes of his forefathers, who were likewise notified\nof any great victory, political change, or piece of good fortune.\nThere is a distinction (not easy to master) between the loss of a\nstate and the loss of a dynasty; in the latter case the population\nremain comparatively unaffected, and it is only the reigning\nfamily whose sacrifices to the gods of the place and of the\nharvest are interrupted. Thus in 567, when one of the very small\nvassals (of whom the ruler of Lu was mesne lord) crushed the\nother, it is explained that the spirits will not spiritually eat\nthe sacrifices (i.e. accept the worship) of one who does not\nbelong to the same family name, and that in this case the\nannihilating state was only a cousin through sisters: “when the\ncountry is ’lost,’ it means that the strange surname succeeds to\npower; but, when a strange surname becomes spiritual heir, we say\n’annihilated.’” We have seen in the ninth Chapter how the Shang\ndynasty lost the empire, but was sacrificially maintained in Sung.\nFrom the remotest times there seems to have been a tender\nunwillingness to “cut off all sacrifices” entirely, probably out\nof a feeling that retribution in like form might at some future\ndate occur to the ruthless condemner of others. There is another\nreason, which is, nearly all ruling families hailed from the same\nremote semi-mythical emperors, or from their ministers, or from\ntheir wives of inferior birth. Thus, although the body of the last\ntyrannical monarch of the Shang dynasty just cited was pierced\nthrough and through by the triumphant Chou monarch, that monarch’s\nbrother (acting as regent on behalf of the son and successor)\nconferred the principality of Sung upon the tyrant’s elder half-\nbrother by an inferior wife, “in order that the dynastic\nsacrifices might not be cut off\"; and to the very last the Duke of\nSung was the only ruling satrap under the Chou dynasty who\npermanently enjoyed the full title of “duke.” His neighbour, the\nMarquess of Wei (imperial clan), was, it is true, made “duke” in\n770 B.C. for services in connection with the Emperor’s flight; but\nthe title seems to have been tacitly abandoned, and at durbars he\nis always styled “marquess.” Of the Shang tyrant himself it is\nrecorded: “thus in 1122 B.C. he lost all in a single day, without\neven leaving posterity.” Of course his elder brother could not\npossibly be his spiritual heir. In 597 B.C., when Ts’u, in its\nstruggle with Tsin for the possession of CHENG, got the ruling\nEarl of CHENG in its power, the latter referred appealingly to his\nimperial ancestors (the first earl, in 806, was son of the Emperor\nwho fled from his capital north in 842), and said: “Let me\ncontinue their sacrifices.” There are, at least, a score of\nsimilar instances: the ancestral sacrifices seem to refer rather\nto posterity, whilst those to gods of the land and grain appear\nmore connected with rights as feoffee.",
        "Prayer is mentioned from the earliest times. For instance Shun,\nthe active ploughman monarch (not hereditary) who preceded the\nthree dynasties of Hia (2205-1767), Shang (1766-1123), and Chou\n(1122-249), prayed at a certain mountain in the centre of modern\nHu Nan province, where his grave still is, (a fact which points to\nthe possibility of the orthodox Chinese having worked their way\nnorthwards from the south-west). When the Chou conqueror,\nposthumously called the Martial King, fell ill, his brother, the\nDuke of Chou (later regent for the Martial King’s son), prayed to\nHeaven for his brother’s recovery, and offered himself as a\nsubstitute; the clerk was instructed to commit the offer to\nwriting, and this solemn document was securely locked up. The same\nman, when regent, again offered himself to Heaven for his sick\nnephew, cutting his nails off and throwing them into the river, as\na symbol of his willingness to give up his own body. The Emperor\nK’ang-hi of the present Manchu dynasty, perhaps in imitation of\nthe Duke of Chou, offered himself to Heaven in place of his sick\nMongol grandmother. A very curious instance of prayer occurs in\nconnection with the succession to the Tsin throne; it will be\nremembered that the legitimate heir committed dutiful suicide, and\ntwo other half-brothers (and, for a few months, one of these\nbrother’s sons) reigned before the second Protector secured his\nancestral rights. The suicide’s ghost appears to his usurping\nbrother, and says: “I have prayed to the Emperor (God), who will\nsoon deliver over Tsin into Ts’in’s hands, so that Ts’in will\nperform the sacrifices due to me.” The reply to the ghost was:\n\"But the spirits will only eat the offerings if they come from the\nsame family stock.” The ghost said: “Very good; then I will pray\nagain. . . . God now says my half-brother will be overthrown at\nthe battle of Han” (the pass where the philosopher Lao-tsz is\nsupposed to have written his book 150 years later). In 645 the\nruler of Tsin was in fact captured in battle by his brother-in-law\nof Ts’in, who was indeed about to sacrifice to the Emperor on High\nas successor of Tsin; but he was dissuaded by his orthodox wife\n(the Tsin princess, daughter of a Ts’i princess as explained on\npage 51).",
        "In 575 Tsin is recorded as “invoking the spirits and requesting a\nvictory.” A little later one of the Tsin generals, after a defeat,\nissued a general order by way of concealing his weakness: to\ndeceive the enemy he suggested that the army should amongst other\nthings make a great show of praying for victory. There are many\nother similar analogous instances of undoubted prayer. Much later,\nin the year 210 B.C., when the King (as he had been) of Ts’in had\nconquered all China and given himself the name, for the first time\nin history, of August Emperor (the present title), he consulted\nhis soothsayers about an unpleasant dream he had had. He was\nadvised to pray, and to worship (or to sacrifice, for the two are\npractically one) with special ardour if he wished to bring things\nround to a favourable conclusion: and this is a monarch, too, who\nwas steeped in Lao-tsz’s philosophy.",
        "We have just seen that, when a military expedition started out,\nthe event was notified, with sacrifice, to the ancestors of the\nperson most concerned: it was also the practice to carry to\nbattle, on a special chariot, the tablet of the last ancestor\nremoved from the ancestral hall, in order that, under his aegis so\nto speak, the tactics of the battle might be successful. Ancestral\nhalls varied according to rank, the Emperor alone having seven\nshrines; vassal rulers five; and first-class ministers three;\ncourtiers or second-class ministers had only two; that is to say,\nno one beyond the living subject’s grandfather was in these last\ncases worshipped at all. From this we may assume that the ordinary\nfolk could not pretend to any shrine, unless perhaps the house-\naltar, which one may see still any day in the streets of Canton.\nIn 645 B.C. a first-class minister’s temple was struck by\nlightning, and the commentator observes: “Thus we see that all,\nfrom the Emperor down to the courtiers, had ancestral shrines”,–a\nstatement which proves that already at the beginning of our\nChristian era such matters had to be explained to the general\npublic. The shrines were disposed in the following fashion:–To\nthe left (on entrance) was the shrine of the living subject’s\nfather; to the right his grandfather; above these two, to the left\nand right again, the great-grandfather and great-great-\ngrandfather; opposite, in the centre, was that of the founder,\nwhose tablet or effigy was never moved; but as each living\nindividual died, his successor of course regarded him in the light\nof father, and, five being the maximum allowed, one tablet had to\nbe removed at each decease, and it was placed in the more general\nancestral hall belonging to the clan or gens rather than to the\nspecific family: it was therefore the, tablet or effigy of the\ngreat-great-grandfather that was usually carried about in war. The\nEmperor alone had two special chapels beyond the five shrines,\neach chapel containing the odds (left) and evens (right) of those\nhigher up in ascent than the great and great-great-grandfathers\nrespectively. The King of Ts’u who died in 560 B.C. said on his\ndeath-bed: “I now take my place in the ancestral temple to receive\nsacrifices in the spring and autumn of each year.” In the year\n597, after a great victory over Tsin, the King of Ts’u had been\nadvised to build a trophy over the collected corpses of the enemy;\nbut, being apparently rather a high-minded man, after a little\nreflection, he said: “No! I will simply erect there a temple to my\nancestors, thanking them for the success.” After the death in 210\nB.C. of the First August Emperor, a discussion arose as to what\nhonours should be paid to his temple shrine: it was explained that\n\"for a thousand years without any change the rule has been seven\nshrines for the Son of Heaven, five for vassal princes, and three\nfor ministers.” In the year 253, after the conquest of the\nmiserable Chou Emperor’s limited territory, the same Ts’in\nconqueror “personally laid the matter before the Emperor Above in\nthe suburb sacrifice\";–which means that he took over charge of\nthe world as Vicar of God. The Temple of Heaven (outside the\nPeking South Gate), occupied in 1900 by the British troops, is\npractically the “suburb sacrifice” place of ancient times. It was\nnot until the year 221 B.C. that the King of Ts’in, after that\ndate First August Emperor, formally annexed the whole empire:\n\"thanks to the shrines in the ancestral temple,” or “thanks to the\nspiritual help of my ancestors’ shrines the Under-Heaven (i.e.\nEmpire) is now first settled.” These expressions have been\nperpetuated dynasty by dynasty, and were indeed again used but\nyesterday in the various announcements of victory made to Heaven\nand his ancestors by the Japanese Tenshi, or Mikado; that\nis by the “Son of Heaven,” or T’ien-tsz of the ancient Chinese,\nfrom whom the Japanese Shinto ritual was borrowed in whole or in\npart.",
        "In the year 572 B.C., on the accession of a Tsin ruler after\nvarious irregular interruptions in the lineal succession, he says:\n\"Thanks to the supernatural assistance of my ancestors–and to\nyour assistance, my lords–I can now carry out the Tsin\nsacrifices.” In the year 548 the wretched ruler of Ts’i, victim of\na palace intrigue, begged the eunuch who was charged with the task\nof assassinating him at least “to grant me permission to commit\nsuicide in my ancestral hall.” The wooden tablet representing the\nancestor is defined as being “that on which the spirit reclines\";\nand the temple “that place where the ancestral spiritual\nconsciousness doth dwell.” Each tablet was placed on its own\naltar: the tablet was square, with a hole in the centre, “in order\nto leave free access on all four sides.” The Emperor’s was twelve\ninches, those of vassal princes one foot (i.e. ten inches) in\nlength, and no doubt the inscription was daubed on in varnish\n(before writing on silk became general, and before the hair-brush\nand ink came into use about 200 B.C.). The rulers of Lu, being\nlineal descendants of the Duke of Chou, brother of the first\nEmperor of the Chou dynasty (1122 B.C.) had special privileges in\nsacrificial matters, such as the right to use the imperial music\nof all past dynasties; the right to sacrifice to the father of the\nDuke of Chou and the founder; the right to imperial rites, to\nsuburban sacrifice, and so on; besides the custody of certain\nancient symbolic objects presented by the first Chou Emperors, and\nmentioned on page 22.",
        "Of course no punishment could be spiritually greater than the\ndestruction of ancestral temples: thus on two occasions, notably\nin 575 B.C. when a first-class minister traitorously fled his\ncountry, his prince, the Marquess of Lu, as a special act of\ngrace, simply “swept his ancestral temple, but did not cut off the\nsacrifices.” The second instance was also in Lu, in 550: the Wei\nfriend with whom Confucius lived seventy years later, when\nwandering in Wei, retrospectively gave his ritual opinion on the\ncase–a proof of the solidarity in sympathy that existed between\nthe statesmen of the orthodox principalities. In the bloodthirsty\nwars between the semi-barbarous southern states of Wu and Ts’u,\nthe capital of the latter was taken by storm in the year 506, the\nancestral temple of Ts’u was totally destroyed, and the renegade\nTs’u ministers who accompanied the Wu armies even flogged the\ncorpse of the previous Ts’u king, their former master, against\nwhom they had a grievance. This mutilation of the dead (in cases\nwhere the guilty rulers have contravened the laws of nature and\nheaven) was practised even in imperial China; for (see page 57)\nthe founder of the dynasty, on taking possession of the last Shang\nEmperor’s palace, deliberately fired several arrows into the body\nof the suicide Emperor. Decapitating corpses and desecrating tombs\nof great criminals have frequently been practised by the existing\nManchu government, in criticizing whom we must not forget the\ntreatment of Cromwell’s body at the Restoration. In the year 285\nB.C., when the Ts’i capital was taken possession of by the allied\nroyal powers then united against Ts’i, the ancestral temple was\nburnt. In 249 B.C. Ts’u extinguished the state of Lu, “which thus\nwitnessed the interruption of its ancestral sacrifices.”",
        "Frequent instances occur, throughout this troublous period, of the\nEmperor’s sending presents of meat used in ancestral sacrifices to\nthe vassal princes; this was intended as a special mark of honour,\nsomething akin to the “orders” or decorations distributed in\nEurope. Thus in 671 the new King of Ts’u who had just murdered his\npredecessor, which predecessor had for the first time set the bad\nexample of annexing petty orthodox Chinese principalities,\nreceived this compliment of sacrificial meat from the Emperor,\ntogether with a mild hint to “attack the barbarians such as Yiieh,\nbut always to let the Chinese princes alone.” Ts’i, Lu, Ts’in, and\nYiieh on different occasions between that date and the fourth\ncentury B.C. received similar donations, usually, evidently, more\npropitiatory than patronizing. In 472 the barbarous King of Yiieh\nwas even nominated Protector along with his present of meat; this\nwas after his total destruction of Wu, when he was marching north\nto threaten North China. Presents of private family sacrificial\nmeat are still in vogue between friends in China.",
        "Fasting and purification were necessary before undertaking solemn\nsacrifice of any kind. Thus the King of Ts’u in 690 B.C. did this\nbefore announcing a proposed war to his ancestors; and an envoy\nstarting from Ts’u to Lu in 618 reported the circumstance to his\nown particular ancestors, who may or may not have been (as many\nhigh officers were) of the reigning caste. On another occasion the\nruler of Lu was assassinated whilst purifying himself in the\nenclosure dedicated to the god of the soil, previous to\nsacrificing to the manes of an individual who had once\nsaved his life. Practically all this is maintained in modern\nChinese usage.",
        "A curious distinction is mentioned in connection with official\nmourning tidings in the highly ritual state of Lu. If the deceased\nwere of a totally different family name, the Marquess of Lu wept\noutside his capital, turning towards deceased’s native place, or\nplace of death; if of the same name, then in the ancestral temple:\nif the deceased was a descendant of the same founder, then in the\nfounder’s temple; if of the same family branch, then in the\npaternal temple. All these refinements are naturally tedious and\nobscure to us Westerners; but it is only by collating specific\nfacts that we can arrive at any general principle or rule.",
        "[Illustration: MAP",
        "1. Ts’u’s five capitals, in order of date, are marked. In 504 B.C.\nthe king had to leave the Yang-tsz for good in order to escape Wu\nattacks. In 278 B.C. Ts’in captured No. 4, and then the ancient\nCh’ta capital (No. 5, already annexed by Ts’u) became the Ts’u\ncapital (see maps showing Ch’en’s position). Ts’u was now a Hwai\nRiver power instead of being a Han River and Yang-tsz power. Shuh\nand Pa are modern Sz Ch’wan, both inaccessible from the Han\nsystem. The Han system to its north was separated from the Wei\nsystem and the country of Ts’in by a common watershed.",
        "2. Wu seems to have been the only power besides Ts’u possessing\nany knowledge of the Yang-tsz River, and Wu was originally part\nof, or vassal to Ts’u. 3. Pa had relations with Ts’u so early as\n600 B.C. Later Pa princesses married Ts’u kings.]",
        "The reign of the Tsin marquess (628-635), second of the Five\nProtectors, only lasted eight years, and nothing is recorded to\nhave happened during this period at all commensurate with his\npicturesque figure in history while yet a mere wanderer. But it is\nvery interesting to note that the Bamboo Annals or Books, i.e. the\nHistory of Tsin from 784 B.C., and incidentally also of China from\n1500 years before that date, are one of the corroborative\nauthorities we now possess upon the accuracy of Confucius’ history\nfrom 722 B.C., as expanded by his three commentators; and it is\nsatisfactory to know that the oldest of the three commentaries,\nthat usually called the Tso Chwan, or “Commentary of Tso\nK’iu-ming,” a junior contemporary of Confucius, and official\nhistoriographer at the Lu Court, is the most accurate as well as\nthe most interesting of the three. These Bamboo Books were only\ndiscovered in the year 281 A.D., after having been buried in a\ntomb ever since the year 299 B.C. The character in which they were\nwritten, upon slips of bamboo, had already become so obsolete that\nthe sustained work of antiquarians was absolutely necessary in\norder to reduce it to the current script of the day; or, in other\nwords, of to-day. Another interesting fact is, that whilst the\nChou dynasty, and consequently Confucius of Lu (which state was\nintimately connected by blood with the Chou family), had\nintroduced a new calendar, making the year begin one (Shang) or\ntwo (Hia) months sooner than before, Tsin had continued to compute\n(see page 27) the year according to the system of the Hia dynasty:\nin other words, the intercalary moons, or massed fractions of time\nperiodically introduced in order to bring the solar and lunar\nyears into line, had during the millennium so accumulated (at the\nrate apparently of, roughly, sixty days in 360,000, or, say, three\nhalf-seconds a day) that the Chou dynasty found it necessary to\ncall the Hia eleventh moon the first and the Hia first moon the\nthird of the year. A parallel distinction is observable in modern\ntimes when the Russian year (until a few years ago twelve days\nlater than ours), was declared thirteen days later; and when we\nourselves in 1900 (and in three-fourths of all future years making\nup a net hundred), omit the intercalary day of the 29th February,\nwhich otherwise occurs every fourth year of even numbers divisible\nby four. Thus the very discrepancies in the dates of the Bamboo\nBooks (where the later editors, in attempting to accommodate all\ndates to later calendars, have accidentally left a Tsin date\nunchanged) and in the dates of Confucius’ expanded history,\npointed out and explained as they are by the Chinese commentators\nthemselves, are at once a guarantee of fact, and of good faith in\nrecording that fact.",
        "But the neighbour and brother-in-law of the Tsin marquess (himself\nthree parts Turkish), the Earl of Ts’in, who reigned from 659 to\n621 B.C., and during that reign quietly laid the foundations of a\npowerful state which was destined to achieve the future conquest\nof all China, was himself a remarkable man; and there is some\nreason to believe that he, even at this period, also possessed a\nspecial calendar of his own, as his successors certainly did 400\nyears later, when they imposed their own calendar reckoning upon\nChina. We have already seen (page 52) what powerful influence he\nexercised in bringing the semi-Tartar Tsin brethren to the Tsin\nthrone in turn. He had invited several distinguished men from the\nneighbouring petty, but very ancient, Chinese principalities to\nsettle in his capital as advisers; he was too far off to attend\nthe durbars held by the, First Protector, but he sent one of these\nChinese advisers as his representative, He is usually himself\ncounted as one of the Five Protectors; but, although he was\ncertainly very influential, and for that reason was certainly one\nof the Five Tyrants, or Five Predominating Powers, it is certain\nthat he never succeeded in obtaining the Emperor’s formal sanction\nto act as such over the orthodox principalities, nor did he ever\npreside at a durbar of Chinese federal princes. Long and bloody\nwars with his neighbour of Tsin were the chief feature of his\nreign so far as orthodox China was concerned; but his chief glory\nlies in his great Tartar conquests, and in his enormous extensions\nto the west. These extensions, however, must not be exaggerated,\nand there is no reason to suppose that they ever reached farther\nthan Kwa Chou and Tun-hwang (long. 95o, lat. 40o), two very\nancient places which still appear under those names on the most\nmodern maps of China, and from which roads (recently examined by\nMajor Bruce) branch off to Turkestan and Lob Nor respectively.",
        "Most Emperors and vassal princes are spoken of in history by their\nposthumous names, that is by the names voted to them after death,\nwith the view of tersely expressing by that name the essential\nfeatures (good or bad) of the deceased’s personal character; just\nas we say in Europe, officially or unofficially, Louis le\nBienaime, Albert the Good, or Charles the Fat. The posthumous name\nof this Ts’in earl was “the Duke Muh” (no matter whether duke,\nmarquess, earl, viscount, or baron when living, it was customary\nto say “duke” when the ruler was dead), and the posthumous name of\nthe Emperor who died in 947 B.C. was “the King Muh\"; for, as\nalready stated, the Chou dynasty of Sons of Heaven were called\n\"King,” and not “Emperor” though their supreme position was as\nfully imperial as that of previous dynastic monarchs, and they\nwere, in fact, “Emperors” as we now understand that word in\nEurope. At the same time that the Bamboo Annals were unearthed,\nthere were also found copies of some of the old “classics” or\n\"Scripture,” and a hitherto unknown book called “the Story of the\nSon of Heaven Muh,” all, of course, written in the same ancient\nscript. This Son of Heaven (a term applied to all the Emperors of\nChina, no matter whether they styled themselves Emperor, King, or\nAugust Emperor) was supposed to have travelled far west, and to\nhave had interviews with a foreign prince, who, as his land too,\nwas transcribed as Siwangmu. The subject will be touched\nupon more in detail in another Chapter; but, for the present, it\nwill be useful to say that, in the opinion of one very learned\nsinologist, all evidence points clearly to this expedition having\nbeen undertaken by Duke Muh of Ts’in, installed as he was in the\nold appanage of the emperors lost to the Tartars (as we have\nexplained) in 771, and made over at the same time by the Emperor\ninvolved to the ancestors of Duke Muh. This view of the case is\nsupported by the fact that in 664 B.C. Ts’in and Tsin, for some\nunknown reason, forced the Tartars of Kwa Chou to migrate into\nChina, which migration was subsequently alluded to by a Tartar\nchief (when attending a Chinese durbar in 559 B.C.) as a well-\nknown historical fact. It was undoubtedly the practice of semi-\nChinese states, such as Ts’u, Wu, Yueh, and Shuh (the last is the\nmodern Sz Ch’wan province, and its history was only discovered\nlong after Confucius’ time), to call themselves “Kings,\"\n\"Emperors,” and “Sons of Heaven,” in their own country (just as\nthe tributary King of Annam always did until the French assumed a\nprotectorate over him; and just as the tributary Japanese did\nbefore they officially announced the fact to China in the seventh\ncentury A.D.); and there are many indications that Ts’in did, or\nat least might have done and would like to have done, the same\nthing. Hence, when the story of Muh was discovered, the literary\nmanipulators–even if they did not really believe that it\npositively must refer to the Emperor Muh-might well have honestly\ndoubted whether the story referred to Ts’in or to the Emperor; or\nmight well have decided to incorporate it with orthodox history,\nas a strengthening factor in support of the theory of one single\nand indivisible imperial dignity; just as, again, in the seventh\ncentury and eighth century A.D., the Japanese manipulators of\ntheir traditional history incorporated hundreds, not to say\nthousands of Chinese historical facts and speeches, and worked\nthem into their own historical episodes and into their own\nemperors’ mouths, for the honour and glory of Dai Nippon (Great\nJapan).",
        "After the death of the Second Protector in 628 B.C., there was a\ncontinuous struggle between Tsin and Ts’in on the one hand, and\nbetween Tsin and Ts’u on the other. Meanwhile Ts’i had all its own\nwork cut out in order to keep the Tartars off the right bank of\nthe Yellow River in its lower course, and in order to protect the\northodox Chinese states, Lu, Sung, Wei, etc., from their attacks;\nbut Ts’i never again after this date put in a formal claim to be\nProtector, although in 610 she led a coalition of princes against\nan offending member, and thus practically acted as Protector.",
        "In addition to the Chinese adviser at the disposal of Ts’in, in\nthe year 626 the King (or a king) of the Tartars supplied Duke Muh\nwith a very able Tartar adviser of Tsin descent; i.e. his\nancestors had in past times migrated to Tartarland, though he\nhimself still “spoke the Tsin dialect,” and must have had\nconsiderable literary capacity, as he was an author. Ts’in was\nnow, in addition to being, if only informally, a federal Chinese\nstate, also supreme suzerain over all the Tartar principalities\nwithin reach; well supplied, moreover, with expert advisers for\nboth classes of work. All this is important in view of the pre-\neminency of Ts’in when the time came, 400 years later, to abolish\nthe meticulous feudal system altogether.",
        "The Five Tyrants, or Protectors, are usually considered to be the\nfive personages we have mentioned; to wit, in order of succession,\nthe Marquess of Ts’i (679-643), under whose reign the great\neconomist, statesman, and philosopher Kwan-tsz raised this far\neastern part of China to a hitherto unheard-of pitch of material\nprosperity; the Marquess of Tsin (632-628), a romantic prince,\nmore Turkish than Chinese, who was the first vassal prince openly\nto treat the Emperor as a puppet; the Duke of Sung (died 637),\nrepresenting the imperial Shang dynasty ejected by the Chou family\nin 1122, whose ridiculous chivalry failed, however, to secure him\nthe effective support of the other Chinese princes; the Earl of\nTs’in (died 621) who was, as we see, quietly creating a great\nTartar dominion, and assimilating it to Chinese ways in the west;\nand the King of Ts’u (died 591), who, besides taking his place\namongst the recognized federal princes, and annexing innumerable\npetty Chinese principalities in the Han River and Hwai River\nbasins, had been for several generations quietly extending his\ndominions at the expense of what we now call the provinces of Sz\nCh’wan, Kiang Si, Hu Kwang-perhaps even Yun Nan and Kwei Chou;\nCertainly Kiang Su and Cheh Kiang, and possibly in a loose way the\ncoast regions of modern Fuh Kien and the Two Kwang; but it cannot\nbe too often repeated that if any thing intimate was known of the\nYang-tsz basin, it was only Ts’u (in its double character of\nindependent local empire as well as Chinese federal prince) that\nknew, or could have known, any thing about it; just as, if any\nthing specific was known of the Far West, Turkestan, the Tarim\nvalley, and the Desert, it was only Ts’in (in its double character\nof independent Tartar empire as well as Chinese federal prince)\nthat knew, or could know, any thing about them. Ts’i and Tsin were\nalso Tartar powers, at least in the sense that they knew how to\nkeep off the particular Tartars known to them, and how to make\nfriendly alliances with them, thus availing themselves, on the one\nhand, of Tartar virility, and faithful on the other to orthodox\nChinese culture. So that, with the exception of the pedantic Duke\nof Sung, who was summarily snuffed out after a year or two of\nbrief light by the lusty King of Ts’u, all the nominal Five\nProtectors of China were either half-barbarian rulers or had\npassed through the crucible of barbarian ordeals. Finally, so\nvague were the claims and services of Sung, Ts’u, and Ts’in, from\na protector point of view, that for the purposes of this work, we\nonly really recognize two, the First Protector (of Ts’i) and,\nafter a struggle, the Second Protector (of Tsin): at most a\nthird,–Ts’u.",
        "But although the Chinese historians thus loosely confine the Five-\nProtector period to less than a century of time, it is a fact that\nTs’u and Tsin went on obstinately struggling for the hegemony, or\nfor practical predominance, for at least another 200 years;\nbesides, Ts’in, Ts’u, and Sung were never formally nominated by\nthe Emperor as Protectors, nor were they ever accepted as such by\nthe Chinese federal princes in the permanent and definite way that\nTs’i and Tsin had been and were accepted. Moreover, the barbarian\nstates of Wu and Yueeh each in turn acted very effectively as\nProtector, and are never included in the Five-Great-Power series.\nThe fact is, the Chinese have never grasped the idea of principles\nin history: their annals are mere diaries of events; and when once\nan apparently definite “period” is named by an annalist, they go\non using it, quite regardless of its inconsistency when confronted\nwith facts adverse to a logical acceptance of it.",
        "The situation was this: Tsin and Ts’u were at perpetual\nloggerheads about the small Chinese states that lay between them,\nmore especially about the state of Cheng, which, though small, was\nof quite recent imperial stock, and was, moreover, well supplied\nwith brains. Tsin and Ts’in were at perpetual loggerheads about\nthe old Tsin possessions on the west bank of the Yellow River,\nwhich, running from the north to the south, lay between them; and\nabout their rival claims to influence the various nomadic Tartar\ntribes living along both the banks, Tsin and Ts’i were often\nengaged in disputes about Lu, Wei, and other orthodox states\nsituated in the Lower Yellow River valley running from the west to\nthe east and north-east; also in questions concerning eastern\nbarbarian states inhabiting the whole coast region, and concerning\nthe petty Chinese states which had degenerated, and whose manners\nsavoured of barbarian ways. Thus Ts’in and Ts’u, and also to some\nextent Ts’i and Ts’u, had a regular tendency to ally themselves\nagainst Tsin’s flanks, and it was therefore always Tsin’s policy\nas the “middle man” to obstruct communications between Ts’in and\nTs’u, and between Ts’i and Ts’u. In 580 Tsin devised a means of\nplaying off a similar flanking game upon Ts’u: negotiations were\nopened with Wu, which completely barbarous state only begins to\nappear in history at all at about this period, all the kings\nhaving manifestly phonetic barbarian names, which mean absolutely\nnothing (beyond conveying the sound) as expressed in Chinese, Wu\nwas taught the art of war, as we have seen, by (page 34) a Ts’u\ntraitor who had fled to Tsin and taken service there; and the King\nof Wu soon made things so uncomfortable for Ts’u that the latter\nin turn tried by every means to block the way between Tsin and Wu.\nWithin a single generation Wu was so civilized that one of the\nroyal princes was sent the rounds of the Chinese states as special\nambassador, charged, under the convenient cloak of seeking for\ncivilization, ritual, and music, with the duty of acquiring\npolitical and strategical knowledge. This prince so favourably\nimpressed the orthodox statesmen of Ts’i, Lu, Tsin, and Wei (the\nruling family of this state, like that of Sung, was, until it\nrevolted in 1106 B.C. against the new Chou dynasty, of Shang\ndynasty origin, and the Yellow River ran through it northwards),\nthat he was everywhere deferentially received as an equal:\nhis tomb is still in existence, about ten miles from the treaty-\nport of Chinkiang, and the inscription upon it, in ancient\ncharacters, was written by Confucius himself, who, though a boy of\neight when the Wu prince visited Lu in 544, may well have seen the\nprince in the flesh elsewhere, for the latter lived to prevent a\nwar with Ts’u in 485; i.e. he lived to within six years of\nConfucius’ death: he is known, too, to have visited Tsin on a\nspying mission in 515 B.C. The original descent of the first\nvoluntarily barbarous Wu princes from the same grandfather as the\nChou emperors would afford ample basis for the full recognition of\na Wu prince by the orthodox as their equal, especially when his\nmanners were softened by rites and music. It was like an oriental\nprince being feted and invested in Europe, so long as he should\nconform to the conventional dress and mannerisms of “society.”",
        "Just as Wu had been quietly submissive to Ts’u until the\nopportunity came to revolt, so did the still more barbarous state\nof Yueh, lying to the south-east of and tributary to Wu as her\nmesne lord, eagerly seize the opportunity of attacking Wu when the\ncommon suzerain, Ts’u, required it. The wars of Wu and Yueh are\nalmost entirely naval, and, so far as the last-named state is\nconcerned, it is never reported as having used war-chariots at\nall. Wu adopted the Chinese chariot as rapidly as it had re-\nadopted the Chinese civilization, abandoned by the first colonist\nprinces in 1200 B.C.; but of course these chariots were only for\nwar in China, on the flat Chinese plains; they were totally\nimpracticable in mountainous countries, except along the main\nroutes, and useless (as Major Bruce shows) in regions cut up by\ngulleys; even now no one ever sees a two-wheeled vehicle in the\nShanghai-Ningpo region. It must, therefore, always be remembered\nthat Wu, though barbarous in its population, was, in its origin as\nan organized system of rule, a colony created by certain ancestors\nof the founder of the Chou dynasty, who had voluntarily gone off\nto carve out an appanage in the Jungle; i.e. in the vague unknown\ndominion later called Ts’u, of which dominion all coast regions\nwere a part, so far as they could be reduced to submission. This\ngave the Kings of Wu, though barbarian, a pretext for claiming\nequality with, and even seniority over Tsin, the first Chou-born\nprince of which was junior in descent to most of the other\nenfeoffed vassals of the imperial clan-name. In 502 Wu armies even\nthreatened the northern state of Ts’i, and asserted in China\ngenerally a brief authority akin to that of Protector. Ts’i was\nobliged to buy itself off by marrying a princess of the blood to\nthe heir-apparent of Wu, an act which two centuries later excited\nthe disgust of the philosopher Mencius. The great Ts’i statesman\nand writer Yen-tsz, whom we have already mentioned more than once,\ndied in 500, and earlier in that year Confucius had become chief\ncounsellor of Lu, which state, on account of Confucius’ skill as a\ndiplomat, nearly obtained the Protectorate. It was owing to the\nfear of this that the assassination of the Lu prince was attempted\nthat year, as narrated in Chapter IX. In order to understand how\nWu succeeded in reaching Lu and Ts’i, it must be recollected that\nthe river Sz, which still runs from east to west past Confucius’s\nbirthplace, and now simply feeds the Grand Canal, then flowed\nsouth-east along the line of the present canal and entered the\nHwai River near Sue-chou. Moreover, there was at times boat-\ncommunication between the Sz and the Yellow River, though the\nprecise channel is not now known. Consequently, the Wu fleets had\nno difficulty in sailing northwards first by sea and then up the\nHwai and Sz Rivers. Besides, in 485, the King of Wu began what we\nnow call the Grand Canal by joining as a beginning the Yang-tsz\nRiver with the Hwai River, and then carrying the canal beyond the\nHwai to the state of Sung, which state was then disputing with Lu\nthe possession of territory on the east bank of the Sz, whilst\nTs’u was pushing her annexations up to the west bank of the same\nriver. There were in all twelve minor orthodox states between the\nSz and the Hwai. In 482 the all-powerful King of Wu held a genuine\ndurbar as Protector, at a place in modern Ho Nan province, north\nof the Yellow River as it now runs, but at that time a good\ndistance to the south-east of it. This is one of the most\ncelebrated meetings in Chinese history, partly because Wu\nsuccessfully asserted political pre-eminence over Tsin; partly\nbecause Confucius falsifies the true facts out of shame (as we\nhave seen he did when Ts’u similarly seized the first place over\nTsin); and partly owing to the shrewd diplomacy of the King of Wu,\nwho had learnt by express messenger that the King of Ytieh was\nmarching on his capital, and who had the difficult double task to\naccomplish of carrying out a “bluff,” and operating a retreat\nwithout showing his weak hand to either side, or losing his army\nexposed between two foes.",
        "In 473, after long and desperate fighting, Wu was, however, at\nlast annihilated by Yiieh, which state was now unanimously voted\nProtector, Vae victis! The Yueh capital was promptly removed\nfrom near the modern Shao-hing (west of Ningpo) far away north\nto what is now practically the German colony of Kiao Chou; but,\nthough a maritime power of very great-strength, Yiieh never succeeded\nin establishing any real land influence in the Hwai Valley. During her\nshort protectorate she rectified the River Sz question by forcing\nSung to make over to Lu the land on the east bank of the River Sz.",
        "Whatever may be the reason why details of interstate movement are\nlacking up to 842 B.C., it is certain that, from the date of the\nEmperor’s flight eastwards in 771, the utmost activity prevailed\nbetween state and state within the narrow area to which, as we\nhave seen, the federated Chinese empire was confined. Confucius’\nhistory, covering the 250-year period subsequent to 722, consists\nlargely of statements that this duke visited that country, or\nreturned from it, or drew up a treaty with it, or negotiated a\nmarriage with it. “Society,” in a political sense, consisted of\nthe four great powers, Ts’in, Tsin, Ts’i, and Ts’u, surrounding\nthe purely Chinese enclave; and of the innumerable petty Chinese\nstates, mostly of noble and ancient lineage, only half a dozen of\nthem of any size, which formed the enclave in question, and were\nsurrounded by Ts’in, Tsin, Ts’i, and Ts’u, to the west, north,\neast, and south. Secondary states in extent and in military power,\nlike Lu, CHENG, and Wei, whilst having orthodox and in some cases\nbarbarian sub-vassals of their own, were themselves, if not\nvassals to, at all events under the predominant influence of, one\nor the other of the four great powers. Thus Lu was at first nearly\nalways a handmaid of Ts’i, but later fell under the influence of\nTsin, Ts’u, and Wu; Cheng always coquetted between Tsin and Ts’u,\nnot out of love for either, but in order to protect her own\nindependence; and so on with the rest. If we inquire what a really\nsmall state meant in those days, the answer is that the modern\nwalled city, with its district of several hundred square miles\nlying around it, was (and usually still is) the equivalent of the\nancient principality; and proof of that lies in the fact that one\nof the literary designations of what we now term a “district\nmagistrate” is still “city marquess.” Another proof is that in\nancient times “your state” was a recognized way of saying “your\ncapital town\"; and “my poor town” was the polite way of saying\n\"our country\"; both expressions still used in elegant diplomatic\ncomposition.",
        "This being so, and it having besides been the practice for a\nvisiting duke always to take along with him a “minister in\nattendance,” small wonder that prominent Chinese statesmen from\nthe orthodox states were all personal friends, or at least\ncorrespondents and acquaintances, who had thus frequent\nopportunity of comparing political notes. To this day there are no\nserious dialect differences whatever in the ancient central area\ndescribed in the first Chapter, nor is there any reason to suppose\nthat the statesmen and scholars who thus often met in conclave had\nany difficulty in making themselves mutually understood. The\n\"dialects\"’ of which we hear so much in modern times (which, none\nthe less, are all of them pure Chinese, except that the syllables\ndiffer, just as coeur, cuore, and corazon, coracao, differ from\ncor), all belong to the southern coasts, which were practically\nunknown to imperial China in Confucius’ time. The Chinese word which\nwe translate “mandarin” also means “public” or “common,” and\n\"mandarin dialect” really means “current” or “common speech,\"\nsuch as is, and was, spoken with no very serious modifications all\nover the enclave; and also in those parts of Ts’in, Tsin, Ts’i, and\nTs’u, which immediately impinged upon the enclave, in the ratio\nof their proximity. Finally, Shen Si, Shan Si, Shan Tung, and Hu\nKwang are still called Ts’in, Tsin, Ts’i, and Ts’u in high-class official\ncorrespondence; and so with all other place-names. China has never\nlost touch with antiquity.",
        "There is record for nearly every thing: the only difficulty is to\nseparate what is relevant from what is irrelevant in the mass of\nconfused data.",
        "Another matter must be considered. Although the Chinese never had\na caste system in the Hindoo sense, there is, as we have stated\nonce before, every reason to believe that the ruling classes and\nthe educated classes were nearly all nobles, in the sense that\nthey were all lineal or branch descendants, whether by first-\nclass wife or by concubine, of either the ruling dynastic family\nor of some previous imperial dynastic family. Some families were\nby custom destined for hereditary ministers, others for hereditary\nenvoys, others again for hereditary soldiers; not, it is true, by\nstrict rule, but because the ancient social idea favoured the\ndescent of office, or land, or trade, or craft from father to son.\nThis, indeed, was part of the celebrated Kwan-tsz’s economic\nphilosophy. Thus generation after generation of statesmen and\nscholars kept in steady touch with one another, exactly as our\nmodern scientists of the first rank, each as a link, form an\nunbroken intimate chain from Newton down to Lord Kelvin, outside\nwhich pale the ordinary layman stands a comparative stranger to\nthe arcana within.",
        "Kwan-tsz, the statesman-philosopher of Ts’i, and in a sense the\nfounder of Chinese economic science, was himself a scion of the\nimperial Chou clan; every writer on political economy subsequent\nto 643 B.C. quotes his writings, precisely as every European\nphilosophical writer cites Bacon. Quite a galaxy of brilliant\nstatesmen and writers, a century after Kwan-tsz, shed lustre upon\nthe Confucian age (550-480), and nearly all of them were personal\nfriends either of Confucius or of each other, or of both. Thus\nTsz-ch’an of CHENG, senior to Confucius, but beloved and admired\nby him, was son of a reigning duke, and a prince of the ducal\nCHENG family, which again was descended from a son of the Emperor\nwho fled in 842 B.C.",
        "If Tsz-ch’an had written works on philosophy and politics, it is\npossible that he might have been China’s greatest man in the place\nof Confucius; for he based his ideas of government, as did\nConfucius, who probably copied much from him, entirely upon\n\"fitting conduct,” or “natural propriety\"; in addition to which he\nwas a great lawyer, entirely free from superstition and hypocrisy;\na kind, just, and considerate ruler; a consummate diplomat; and a\nbold, original statesman, economist, and administrator. The\nanecdotes and sayings of Tsz-ch’an are as numerous and as\npractical as those about Julius Caesar or Marcus Aurelius.",
        "Another great pillar of the state praised by Confucius was Shuh\nHiang of Tsin, whose reputation as a sort of Chinese Cicero is not\nfar below that of Tsz-ch’an. He belonged to one of the great\nprivate families of Tsin, of whom it was said in Ts’u that “any of\nthem could bring 100 war-chariots into the field.” Nothing could\nbe more interesting than the interviews and letters (see Appendix\nNo. 1) between these two friends and their colleagues of Ts’i,\nTs’u, Lu, and Sung.",
        "Yen-tsz of Ts’i almost ranks with Kwan-tsz as an administrator,\nphilosopher, economist, author, and statesman. Confucius has a\ngood word for him too, though Yen-tsz’s own opinion of Confucius’\nmerits was by no means so high. The two men had to “spar” with\neach other behind their respective rulers like Bismarck and\nGortschakoff did. Yen-tsz’s interview with Shuh Hiang, when the\npair discussed the vices of their respective dukes, is almost as\namusing as a “patter” scene in the pantomime, a sort of by-play\nwhich takes place whilst the curtain is down in preparation for\nthe next formal act (see Appendix No. 2).",
        "[Illustration: K’ung Ling-i, the hereditary Yen-sheng Kung,\nor “Propagating Holiness Duke\"; 76th in descent from K’ung K’iu,\nalias K’ung Chung-ni, the original philosopher, 551–479\nB.C.",
        "This portrait was presented to “the priest P’eng” (Father Tschepe,\nS.J.), on the occasion of his visit last autumn (7th moon, 33rd\nyear).]",
        "Confucius himself had descended in the direct line from the ducal\nfamily of Sung; but Sung, like the other states, was cursed with\nthe “great family” nuisance, and one of his ancestors, having\nincurred a grandee’s hostility, had met with his death in a palace\nintrigue, in consequence of which the Confucian family, despairing\nof justice, had migrated to Lu. When we read of Confucius’\nextensive wanderings (which are treated of more at length in a\nsubsequent Chapter), the matter takes a very different complexion\nfrom what is usually supposed, especially if it be recollected\nwhat a limited area was really covered. He never got even so far\nas Tsin, though part of Tsin touched the Lu frontier, and it is\ndoubtful if he was ever 300 miles, as the crow flies, from his own\nhouse in Lu; true, he visited the fringe of Ts’u, but it must be\nremembered that the place he visited was only in modern Ho Nan\nprovince, and was one of the recent conquests of Ts’u, belonging\nto the Hwai River system. As we explained in the last Chapter,\nTs’u’s policy then was to work up eastwards to the river Sz; that\nis, to the Grand Canal of to-day. Confucius, it is plain, was no\nmere pedant; for we have seen how, in the year 500, when he first\nenjoyed high political power, he displayed conspicuously great\nstrategical and diplomatic ability in defeating the treacherous\nschemes of the ruler of Ts’i, who had been endeavouring to filch\nLu territory, and who was dreadfully afraid lest Lu should,\nthrough Wu’s favour, acquire the hegemony or protectorship. He\ncould even be humorous, for when the barbarian King of Wu put in a\ndemand for a “handsome hat,” Confucius contemptuously observed\nthat the gorgeousness of a hat’s trimmings appealed to this\nignorant monarch more than the emblem of rank distinguishing one\nhat from another.",
        "Sung provided one distinguished statesman in Hiang Suh, whose fame\nis bound up with a kind of Hague Disarmament or Peace Conference,\nwhich he successfully engineered in 546 B.C. (see Appendix No. 3).\nIn the year 558 he had been sent on a marriage mission to Lu. Ki-\nchah of Wu, who died at the ripe age of 90, was quite entitled to\nbe king of that country, but he repeatedly waived his claims in\nfavour of his brothers. K’ue-peh-yueh of Wei, is mentioned in the\nBook of Rites, and in many other works. With him Confucius lodged\non the two occasions of long sojourn in Wei: he is the man\nmentioned in Chapter XII who gave his authoritative “ritual\"\nopinion about traitors. Ts’in never seems to have produced a\nnative literary statesman on its own soil. During this 500-year\nperiod of isolated development, and also during the later period\nof conquest in the third century B.C., all its statesmen were\nborrowed from Tsin, or from some orthodox state of China proper;\nin military genius, however, Ts’in was unrivalled, and a special\nChapter will be devoted to her huge battues. The literary\nreputation of Ts’u was high at a comparatively early date, and\neven now the “Elegies of Ts’u” include some of the very finest of\nthe Chinese poems and belles lettres; but in Confucius’\ntime no Ts’u man, except possibly Lao-tsz, had any reputation at\nall; and Lao-tsz, being a mere archive keeper, not entrusted with\nany influential office, naturally lacked opportunity to emerge\nfrom the chrysalis stage. Moreover, the imperial dynasty, which\nLao-tsz served, had no political influence at all: it was an\nironical saying of the times; “the best civilians are Ts’u’s, but\nthey all serve other states,” (meaning that the Ts’u rule was too\ncapricious to attract talent). Hence, apart from the fact that\nConfucius doubted the wisdom of Lao-tsz’s novel philosophy,\nConfucius had no occasion whatever to mention the secluded, self-\ncontained old man in his political history, or, rather, in his\nbald annals of royal-movements.",
        "What sort of folk were the masses of China, upon whom the ruling\nclasses depended, then as now, for their support? In the year 594\nB.C. the model state of Lu for the first time imposed a tax of ten\nper cent, upon each Chinese “acre” of land, being about one-sixth\nof an English acre: as the tax was one-tenth, it matters not what\nsize the acre was. Each cultivator under the old system had an\nallotment of 100 such acres for himself, his parents, his wife,\nand his children; and in the centre of this allotment were 10\nacres of “public land,” the produce of which, being the result of\nhis labour, went to the State; there was no further taxation. A\n\"mile,” being about one-third of an English mile, and, therefore,\nin square measure one-ninth of an English square mile, consisted\nof 300 fathoms (taking the fathom roughly), and its superficies\ncontained 900 “acres” of which 80 were public under the above\narrangement, 820 remaining for the eight families owning this\n\"well-field\"–so called because the ideograph for a “well\"\nrepresents nine squares: a four-sided square in the centre, four\nthree-sided squares impinging on it; and four two-sided squares at\nthe corners; i.e. 100 “acres” each, plus 2-1/2 “acres” each for\n\"homestead and onions\"; or 20 of these last in all. Nine\ncultivators in one “well,” multiplied by four, formed a township,\nand four townships formed a “cuirass” of 144 armed warriors; but\nthis was under a modified system introduced four years later\n(590). It will be observed that the arithmetic seems confused, if\nnot faulty; but that does not seriously affect the genuineness of\nthe picture, and may be ignored as mere detail.",
        "The ancient classification of people was into four groups. The\nscholar people employed themselves in studying tao and the\nsciences, from which we plainly see that the doctrine of\ntao, or “the way,” existed long before Lao-tsz, in Confucius’\ntime, superadded a mystic cosmogony upon it, and made of it a socialist\nor radical instead of an imperialist or conservative doctrine. The second\nclass were the trading people, who dealt in “produce from the four\nquarters\"; there is evidence that this meant chiefly cattle, grain, silk,\nhorses, leather, and gems. The third class were the cultivators, and\nin those days tea and cotton, amongst other important products of\nto-day, were totally unknown. The fourth class consisted of handicraftsmen,\nwho naturally made all things they could sell, or knew how to make.",
        "Another classification of men is the following, which was given to\nthe King of Ts’u by a sage adviser, presumably an importation from\northodox China. He divided people into ten classes, each inferior\nclass owing obedience to its superior, and the highest of all\nowing obedience only to the gods or spirits. First, the Emperor;\nsecondly, the “inner” dukes, or grandees of estates within the\nimperial domain: these grandees were dukes proper, not dukes by\nposthumous courtesy like the vassal princes after decease, and the\nEmperor used to send them on service, when required, to the vassal\nstates; they were, in fact, like the “princes of the Church” or\ncardinals, who surround the Pope. Thirdly, “the marquesses,” that\nis the semi-independent vassal states, no matter whether duke,\nmarquess, earl, viscount, or baron; this term seems also to\ninclude the reigning lords of very small states which did not\npossess even the rank of baron, and which were usually attached to\na larger state as clients, under protectorate; in fact, the\nrecognized stereotyped way of saying “the vassal rulers” was “the\nmarquesses.” Then came what we should call the “middle classes,\"\nor bourgeoisie, followed by the artisans and cultivators: it will\nbe noticed that the artisans are here given rank over the\ncultivators, which is not in accord with either very ancient or\nvery modern practice; this, indeed, places cultivators before both\ntraders and artisans. Lastly came the police, the carriers of\nburdens, the eunuchs, and the slaves. By “police” are meant the\nrunners attached to public offices, whose work too often involves\n\"squeezing” and terrorizing, torturing, flogging, etc. To the\npresent day police, barbers, and slaves require three generations\nof purifying, or living down, before their descendants can enter\nfor the public examinations; or, to use the official expression,\ntheir “three generations” must be “clear\"; at least so it was\nuntil the old Confucian examination system was abolished as a test\nfor official capacity a few years ago. Of eunuchs we shall have\nmore to say shortly; but very little indeed is heard of private\nslaves, who probably then, as now, were indistinguishable from the\nordinary people, and were treated kindly. The callous Greek and\nstill more brutal Roman system, not to mention the infinitely more\ncowardly and shocking African slavery abuses of eighteenth-\ncentury Europe and nineteenth-century America, have never been\nknown in China: no such thing as a slave revolt has ever been\nheard of there.",
        "In the year 548 the kingdom of Ts’u ordered a cadastral survey,\nand also a general stock-taking of arms, chariots, and horses.\nRecords were made of the extent and value of the land in each\nparish, the extent of the mountains and forests, and the resources\nthey might furnish. Observation was also made of lakes and marshes\nsuitable for sport, and it was forbidden to fill these in. Note\nwas taken of such hills and mounds as might be available for\ntombs–a detail which shows that modern graves in China differ\nlittle if at all from the ancient ones; in fact in Canton “my\nhill,” or “mountain,” is synonymous with “my cemetery.” In order\nto fix the taxes at a just figure, stock was taken of the salt-\nflats, the unproductive lands, and the tracts liable to periodical\ninundation. Areas rescued from the waters were protected by dykes,\nand subdivided for allotment by sloping banks, but without\nintroducing the rigid nine-square system. Good lands, however,\nwere divided according to the method introduced by the Chou\ndynasty; that is to say, six feet formed a “fathom,” 100 fathoms\nan “acre,” 100 “acres” the allotment of one family; these English\nterms are, of course, only approximately correct. Nine families\nstill formed a hamlet or “well,” and they cultivated together 1000\n\"acres,” the central hundred going to pay the imposts. Taxes,\ndirect and indirect, were fixed with exactitude, and also the\nnumber of war-chariots that each parish had to furnish; the number\nof horses; their value, age, and colour; the number of armoured\ntroopers and foot soldiers, with a return of their cuirasses and\nshields. Regarding this colour classification, of the horses, it\nmay be mentioned that the Tartars, in the second century B.C.,\nwere in the habit of equipping whole regiments of cavalry on\nmounts of the same colour, and it is, therefore, possible that\nthis practice may have been imitated in South China; but Ts’u\nnever once herself engaged in warfare with the Tartars; at all\nevents with Tartars other than Tartars brought into Chinese\nsettlements.",
        "Long before this, the philosopher-statesman Kwan-tsz of Ts’i had\nso developed the agriculture, fisheries, trade, and salt gabelle,\nand had governed the country in such a way that his State,\nhitherto of minor importance, soon took the lead amongst the\nChinese powers for wealth and for military influence. His\nclassification of the people was into scholars, artisans, traders,\nand agriculturalists. He is generally credited with having\nintroduced the “Babylonian woman” into the Ts’i metropolis, in\norder that traders, having sold their goods there, might leave as\nmuch as possible of their money behind in the houses of pleasure.\nThere are many accounts of the luxury of this populous city, where\n\"every woman possessed one long and one short needle,” and where a\npremium levied upon currency, fish, and salt was applied to the\nrelief of the poor and (!) to the rewarding of virtue. Kwan-tsz\nalso maintained a standing army, or perhaps a militia force, of\n30,000 men; but he was careful so to husband his strength that\nTs’i should not have the external appearance of dominating; his\naim was that she should rather hold her power in reserve, and only\nuse it indirectly: as we have seen, his master was, in consequence\nof Kwan-tsz’s able administration, raised to the high position of\nthe first of the Five Protectors.",
        "From this it will be plain that there was considerable commercial\nactivity in China even before the time of Confucius: there was\nquite a string of fairs or market towns extending from the\nimperial reserve eastwards along the Yellow River to Choh-thou\n(still so called, south of Peking), which was then the most\nnorthernly of them: apparently each considerable state possessed\none of these fairs. The headwaters of the River Hwai system were\nserved by the great mart (now called Yii Chou) belonging to the\nstate of Cheng. As with our own histories, Chinese annals consist\nchiefly of the record of what kings and grandees did, and mention\nof the people is only occasional; and, even then, only in\nconnection with the policy of their leaders.",
        "As soon as the second of the Protectors, the Marquess of Tsin, was\nseated on his ancestral throne (637), his first act was to reduce\nthe tolls and make the roads safer; to facilitate trade, and to\nencourage agriculture. Also to “make friends of the eleven great\nfamilies” (already mentioned twice in preceding pages), whose\ndevelopment, however, in time led to the collapse of this princely\npower, and to its division between three of the “great families.\"\nA century after this, a minister of the Ts’u state praised very\nhighly the efficiency of the Tsin administration. “The common\npeople are devoted to agriculture; the merchants, artisans, and\nmenials are all dutiful.” For the conveyance of grain between the\nTs’in and the Tsin capitals, both carts and boats were requisitioned,\nfrom which we must assume that there were practicable roads of some\nsort for two-wheeled vehicles. In the year 546, when some important\nreserves were made by Tsin at the Peace Conference, an express\nmessenger was sent from Sung to the Ts’u capital to take the king’s\npleasure: this means an overland journey from the sources of the Hwai\nto the modern treaty port of Sha-shr above Hankow.",
        "It may be added that, five centuries before Kwan-tsz existed, the\nfounder of the Ts’i state, as a vassal to the new Chou dynasty,\nhad already distinguished himself by encouraging trade,\nmanufactures, fisheries, and the salt production; so that Kwan-tsz\nwas an improver rather than an inventor.",
        "Thus we see that, from very early times, China was by no means a\nsleepy country of ignorant husbandmen, but was a place full of\nmultifarious activities; and that her local rulers, at least from\nthe time when the patriarchal power of the Emperors decayed in\n771, were often men of considerable sagacity, quite alive to the\nnecessity of developing their resources and encouraging their\npeople: this helps us to understand their restlessness under the\nyoke of “ritual.”",
        "There is singularly little mention of writing or education in\nancient times, and it seems likely that written records were at\nfirst confined to castings or engravings upon metal, and carvings\nupon stone. In the days when the written character was cumbrous,\nthere would be no great encouragement to use it for daily\nhousehold purposes. It is a striking fact, not only that writings\nupon soft clay, afterwards baked, were not only non-existent in\nChina, but have never once been mentioned or conceived of as being\na possibility. This fact effectually disposes of the allegation\nthat Persian and Babylonian literary civilization made its way to\nChina, for it is unreasonable to suppose that an invention so well\nsuited to the clayey soil (of loess mud with cementing properties)\nin which the Chinese princes dwelt could have been ignored by them,\nif ever the slightest inkling of it had been obtained.",
        "In 770 B.C., when the Emperor, having moved his capital to the\neast, ceded his ancestral lands in the west to Ts’in on condition\nthat Ts’in should recover them permanently from the Tartars, the\ndocument of cession was engraved upon a metal vase. Fifteen\nhundred years before this, the Nine Tripods of the founder of the\nHia dynasty, representing tributes of metal brought to the Emperor\nby outlying tribes, were inscribed with records of the various\nproductions of China: these tripods were ever afterwards regarded\nas an attribute of imperial authority; and even Ts’u, when it\nbegan to presume upon the Chou Emperor’s weakness, put in a claim\n(probably based upon his ancestors’ own ancient Chinese descent,\nas explained in Chapter IV.) to possess them.",
        "In distributing the fiefs amongst relatives and friends, the first\nChou emperors “composed orders” conferring rights upon their new\nvassals; but it is not stated what written form these orders took.\nWritten prayers for the recovery of the first Emperor’s health are\nmentioned, but here again we are ignorant of the material on which\nthe prayers were written by the precentor. Four hundred years\nlater, in 65, when Ts’in had assisted to the throne his neighbour\nthe Marquess of Tsin, the latter gave a promise in writing to\nTs’in that he would cede to her all the territory lying to the\nwest of the Yellow River. The next ruler of Tsin, the celebrated\nwanderer who afterwards became the second Protector, is distinctly\nstated to have had an adviser who taught him to read; it is added\nthat the same marquess also consulted this adviser about a\nsuitable teacher for his son and heir. About the same time one of\nthe Marquess’s friends, objecting to take office, took to flight:\nhis friends, as a protest, hung up “a writing” at the palace gate.\nIn 584 a Ts’u refugee in Tsin sends a writing to the leading\ngeneral of Ts’u, threatening to be a thorn in his side. It is\npresumed that in all these cases the writing was on wood. The text\nof a declaration of war against Ts’u by Ts’in in 313 B.C., at a\ntime when these two powers had ceased to be allies, and were\ncompeting for empire, refers to an agreement made three centuries\nearlier between the King of Ts’u and the Earl of Ts’in; this\ndeclaration was carved upon several stone tablets; but it does not\nappear upon what material the older agreement was carved. In 538,\nat a durbar held by Ts’u, Hiang Suh, the learned man of Sung, who\nhas already been mentioned in Chapter XV. as the inventor of Peace\nConferences in 546, and as one of the Confucian group of friends,\nremarked: “What I know of the diplomatic forms to be observed is\nonly obtained from books.” A few years later, when the population\nof one of the small orthodox Chinese states was moved for\npolitical convenience by Ts’u away to another district, they were\nallowed to take with them “their maps, cadastral survey, and\ncensus records.”",
        "There is an interesting statement in the Kwoh Yue, an\nancillary history of these times, but touching more upon personal\nmatters, usually considered to have been written by the same man\nthat first expanded Confucius’ annals, to the effect that in 489\nB.C. (when Confucius was wandering about on his travels, a\ndisappointed and disgusted man) the King of Wu inflicted a\ncrushing defeat upon Ts’i at a spot not far from the Lu frontier,\nand that he captured “the national books, 800 leather chariots,\nand 3000 cuirasses and shields.” If this translation be perfectly\naccurate, it is interesting as showing that Ts’i did possess\nKwoh-shu, or “a State library,” or archives. But unfortunately\ntwo other histories mention the capture of a Ts’i general named Kwoh\nHia, alias Kwoh Hwei-tsz, so that there seems to be a doubt\nwhether, in transcribing ancient texts, one character (shu) may\nnot have been substituted for the other (hia). Two years later\nthe barbarian king in question entered Lu, and made a treaty with that\nstate upon equal terms.",
        "Shortly after this date, the Chinese adviser who brought about the\nconquest of Wu by the equally barbarous Yiieh, had occasion to\nsend a “closed letter” to a man living in Ts’u. When we come to\nlater times, subsequent to the death of Confucius, we find written\ncommunications more commonly spoken of. Thus, in 313, Ts’i,\nenraged at the supposed faithlessness of Ts’u, “broke in two the\nTs’u tally” and attached herself to Ts’in instead. This can only\nrefer to a wooden “indenture” of which each party preserved a\ncopy, each fitting ’in, “dog’s teeth like,” as the Chinese still\nsay, closely to the other. A few years later we find letters from\nTs’i to Ts’u, holding forth the tempting project of a joint attack\nupon Ts’in; and also a letter from Ts’in to Ts’u, alluding to the\nescape of a hostage and the cause of a war. In the year 227, when\nTs’in was rapidly conquering the whole empire, the northernmost\nstate of Yen (Peking plain), dreading annexation, conceived the\nplan of assassinating the King of Ts’in; and, in order to give the\nassassin a plausible ground for gaining admittance to the tyrant’s\npresence, sent a map of Yen, so that the roads available for\ntroops might be explained to the ambitious conqueror, who would\nfall into the trap. He barely escaped.",
        "All these matters put together point to the clear conclusion that\nsuch states as Ts’in, Tsin, Ts’i, Yen, and Ts’u (none of which\nbelonged, so far as the bulk of their population was concerned, to\nthe purely Chinese group concentrated in the limited area\ndescribed in the first Chapter) were able to communicate by letter\nfreely with each other: a fortiori, therefore, must the\northodox states, whose civilization they had all borrowed or\nshared, have been able to communicate with them, and with each\nother. Besides, there is the question of the innumerable treaties\nmade at the durbars, and evidently equally legible by all the\ndozen or so of representatives present; and the written prayers,\nalready instanced, which were probably offered to the gods at most\nsacrifices. A special Chapter will be devoted to treaties.",
        "In the year 523 the following passage occurs, or rather it occurs\nin one of the expanded Confucian histories having retrospective\nreference to matters of 523 B.C:–\"It is the father’s fault if, at\nthe binding up of the hair (eight years of age), boys do not go to\nthe teacher, though it may be the mother’s fault if, before that\nage, they do not escape the dangers of fire and water: it is their\nown fault if, having gone to the teacher, they make no progress:\nit is their friends’ fault if they make progress but get no repute\nfor it: it is the executive’s fault if they obtain repute but no\nrecommendation to office: it is the prince’s fault if they are\nrecommended for office but not appointed.” Here we have in effect\nthe nucleus at least of the examination system as it was until a\nyear or two ago, together with an inferential statement that\neducation was only meant for the governing classes.",
        "It is rather remarkable that the invention of the “greater seal\"\ncharacter in 827 B.C. practically coincides with the first signs\nof imperial decadence; this is only another piece of evidence in\nfavour of the proposition that enlightenment and patriarchal rule\ncould not exist comfortably together. When Ts’in conquered the\nwhole of modern China 600 years later, unified weights and\nmeasures, the breadth of axles, and written script, and remedied\nother irregularities that had hitherto prevailed in the rival\nstates, it is evident that the need of a more intelligible script\nwas then found quite as urgent as the need of roads suitable for\nall carts, and of measures by which those carts could bring\ndefinite quantities of metal and grain tribute to the capital.\nAccordingly the First August Emperor’s prime minister did at once\nset to work to invent the “lesser seal” character, in which (so\nlate as A.D. 200) the first Chinese dictionary was written; this\n\"lesser seal” is still fairly readable after a little practice,\nbut for daily use it has long been and is impracticable and\nobsolete. If we reflect how difficult it is for us to decipher the\nold engrossed charters and written letters of the English kings,\nwe may all the more easily imagine how even a slight change in the\nform of “letters,” or strokes, will make easy reading of Chinese\nimpossible. It is a mistake to suppose that the Chinese have to\n\"spell their way” laboriously through the written character so\nfamiliar to them: it is just as easy to “skim over” a Chinese\nnewspaper in a few minutes as it is to “take in” the leading\nfeatures of the Times in the same limited time; and volumes\nof Chinese history or literature in general can be “gutted” quite\neasily, owing to the facility with which the so-called pictographs,\nonce familiar, lend themselves to “skipping.”",
        "The Bamboo Books, dug up in A.D. 281, the copies of the classics\nconcealed in the walls of Confucius’ house, the copy of Lao-tsz’s\nphilosophical work recorded to have been in the possession of a\nChinese empress in 150 B.C.–all these were written in the\n\"greater seal,” and the painstaking industry of Chinese\nspecialists was already necessary when the Christian era began, in\norder to reduce the ancient characters to more modern forms. Since\nthen the written character has been much clarified and simplified,\nand it is just as easy to express sentiments in written Chinese as\nin any other language; but, of course, when totally new ideas are\nintroduced, totally new characters must be invented; and\ninventions, both of individual characters and of expressions, are\ngoing on now.",
        "Treaties were always very solemn functions, invariably accompanied\nby the sacrifice of a victim. A part of the victim, or of its\nblood, was thrown into a ditch, in order that the Spirit of the\nEarth might bear witness to the deed; the rest of the blood was\nrubbed upon the lips of the parties concerned, and also scattered\nupon the documents, by way of imprecation; sometimes, however, the\nimprecations, instead of being uttered, were specially written at\nthe end of the treaty. Just as we now say “the ink was scarcely\ndry before, etc., etc.,” the Chinese used to say “the blood of the\nvictim was scarcely dry on their lips, before, etc., etc.” When\nthe barbarian King of Wu succeeded for a short period in\n\"durbaring” the federal Chinese princes, a dispute took place (as\nnarrated in Chapter XIV.) between Tsin and Wu as to who should rub\nthe lips with blood first–in other words, have precedence. In\nthe year 541 B.C., sixty years before the above event, Tsin and\nTs’u had agreed to waive the ceremony of smearing the lips with\nblood, to choose a victim in common, and to lay the text of the\ntreaty upon the victim after a solemn reading of its contents.\nThis modification was evidently made in consequence of the\ndisagreement between Tsin and Ts’u at the Peace Conference of 546,\nwhen a dispute had arisen (page 47), as to which should smear the\nlips first. This was the occasion on which the famous Tsin\nstatesman, Shuh Hiang, in the face of seventeen states’\nrepresentatives, all present, had the courage to ignore Ts’u’s\ntreachery in concealing cuirasses under the soldiers’ clothes. He\nsaid: “Tsin holds her pre-eminent position as Protector by her\ninnate good qualities, which will always command the adhesion of\nother states; why need we care if Ts’u smears first, or if she\ninjures herself by being detected in treachery?” It has already\nbeen mentioned that Confucius glosses over or falsifies both the\nabove cases, and gives the victory in each instance to Tsin.\nThough these little historical peccadilloes on the part of the\nsaint homme are considered even by orthodox critics to be\nobjectionable, it must be remembered that it was very risky work\nwriting history at all in those despotic times: even in\ncomparatively democratic days (100 B.C.), the “father of Chinese\nhistory” was castrated for criticizing the reigning Emperor in the\ncourse of issuing his great work; and so late as the fifth century\nA.D. an almost equally great historian was put to death “with his\nthree generations” for composing a “true history” of the Tartars\nthen ruling as Emperors of North China; i.e. for disclosing their\nobscure and barbarous origin, Moreover, foreigners who fix upon\nthese trifling specific and admitted discrepancies, in order to\ndiscredit the general truth of all Chinese history, must remember\nthat the Chinese critics, from the very beginning, have always,\neven when manifestly biased, been careful to expose errors; the\nvery discrepancies themselves, indeed, tend to prove the\nsubstantial truth of the events recorded; and the fact that\nadmittedly erroneous texts still stand unaltered proves the\nreverent care of the Chinese as a nation to preserve their\ndefective annals, with all faults, in their original condition.",
        "At this treaty conference of 546 B.C., held at the Sung capital,\nthe host alone had no vote, being held superior (as host) to all;\nand, further, out of respect for his independence, the treaty had\nto be signed outside his gates: the existence of the Emperor was\ntotally ignored.",
        "A generation before this (579) another important treaty between\nthe two great rivals, Tsin and Ts’u, had been signed by the high\ncontracting parties outside the walls of Sung. The articles\nprovided for community of interest in success or failure; mutual\naid in every thing, more especially in war; free use of roads so\nlong as relations remained peaceful; joint action in face of\nmenace from other powers; punishment of those neglecting to come\nto court. The imprecation ran: “Of him who breaks this, let the\narmies be dispersed and the kingdom be lost; moreover, let the\nspirits chastise him.” Although both orthodox powers professed\ntheir anxiety to “protect” the imperial throne, yet, seeing that\nthe Emperor was quietly shelved in all these conventions, the\nreference to “court duty” probably refers to the duty of Cheng and\nthe other small orthodox states to render homage to Tsin or Ts’u\n(as the case might be) as settled by this and previous treaties.\nIn fact, at the Peace Conference of 546, it was agreed between the\ntwo mesne lords that the vassals of Ts’u should pay their respects\nto Tsin, and vice versa. But, during the negotiations, a\nzealous Tsin representative went on to propose that the informal\nallies of the chief contracting powers should also be dragged in:\n\"If Ts’in will pay us a visit, I will try and induce Ts’i to visit\nT’su.” These two powers had ententes, Ts’i with Tsin, and\nTs’u with Ts’in, but recognized no one’s hegemony over them. It\nwas this surprise sprung upon the Ts’u delegates that necessitated\nan express messenger to the king, as recounted at the end of\nChapter XVI. The King of Ts’u sent word: “Let Ts’in and Ts’i\nalone; let the others visit our respective capitals.” Accordingly\nit was understood that Tsin and Ts’u should both be Protectors,\nbut that neither Ts’in nor Ts’i should recognize their status to\nthe point of subordinating themselves to the joint hegemons. This\nwas Ts’u’s first appearance as effective hegemon, but her official\ndebut alone did not take place till 538. Ts’i and Ts’in had\nboth approved, in principle, the terms of peace, but Ts’in sent no\nrepresentative, whilst Ts’i sent two. It is very remarkable that\nSz-ma Ts’ien (the great historian of 100 B.C., who was castrated)\ndoes not mention this important meeting in his great work, either\nunder the heading of Ts’i, or of Tsin, or under the headings of\nSung and Ts’u. It seems, however, really to have had good effect\nfor several generations; but there was some thing behind it which\nshows that love for humanity was not the leading motive of the\nchief parties. Two years later it was that the philosophical\nbrother of the King of Wu went his rounds among the Chinese\nprinces, and it is evident that Ts’u only desired peace with North\nChina whilst she tackled this formidable new enemy on the coast.\nTsin, on the other hand, was in trouble with the “six great\nfamilies” (the survivors of the “eleven great families\"\nconciliated by the Second Protector), who were gradually\nundermining the princely authority in Tsin to their own private\naggrandisement. In 572 B.C., when the legitimate ruler of Tsin,\nwho had been superseded by irregular successors, was fetched back\nfrom the Emperor’s court, to which he had gone for a quiet asylum,\nhe drew up a treaty of conditions with his own ministers, and\nimmolated a chicken as sanction; this idea is still occasionally\nperpetuated in British courts of justice, where Chinese, probably\nwithout knowing it, draw upon ancient history when asked by the\ncourt how they are accustomed to sanction an oath; cocks are often\nalso carried about by modern Chinese boatmen for purposes of\nsacrifice. In the year 504, after Wu had captured the Ts’u\ncapital, one of the petty orthodox Chinese states taken by Ts’u–\nthe first to be so taken by barbarians–in 684, but left by Ts’u\ninternally independent, declined to render any assistance to Wu,\nunless she could prove her competence to hold permanently the Ts’u\nterritory thus conquered. The King of Ts’u was so grateful for\nthis that he drew some blood from the breast of his own half-\nbrother, and on the spot made a treaty with the vassal prince. It\n662, even in a love vow, the ruler of Lu cut his own arm and\nexchanged drops of blood with his lady-love. In 481 the people of\nWei (the small orthodox state on the middle Yellow River between\nTsin and Lu) forced one of their politicians to swear allegiance\nto the desired successor under the sanction of a sacrificial pig.",
        "The great Kwan-tsz insisted on his prince carrying out a treaty\nwhich had been extorted in times of stress; but, as a rule, the\nmost opportunistic principles were laid down, even by Confucius\nhimself when he was placed under personal stress: “Treaties\nobtained by force are of no value, as the spirits could not then\nhave really been present.” In 589 Ts’u invaded the state of Wei,\njust mentioned, and menaced the adjoining state of Lu, compelling\nthe execution of a treaty. Confucius, who once broke a treaty\nhimself, naturally retrospectively considered this ducal treaty of\nno effect, and he even goes so far as to avoid mentioning in his\nannals some of the important persons who were present; he\nespecially “burkes” two Chinese ruling princes, who were shameless\nenough to ride in the same chariot with the King of Ts’u, under\nwhose predominancy they were, and who were therefore themselves\nunder a kind of stress. In 482 one of Confucius’ pupils made the\nfollowing casuistical reply to the government of Wu on their\napplication for renewal of a treaty with her: “It is only fidelity\nthat gives solidity to treaties; they are determined by mutual\nconsent, and it is with sacrifices that they are laid before our\nancestors; the written words give expression to them, and the\nspirits guarantee them. A treaty once concluded cannot be changed:\notherwise it were vain to make a new one. Remember the proverb:\n\"What needs warming up more may just as well be eaten cold.” The\nordinary rough-and-ready form of oath or vow between individuals\nwas: “If I break this, may I be as this river\"; or, “may the river\ngod be witness.” There were many other similar forms, and it was\noften customary to throw something valuable into the river as a\nsymbol.",
        "Let us return for a moment to the history of China’s development.\nConfucius was born in the autumn of 551, B.C., and he died in 479.\nIf we survey the condition of the empire during these seventy\nyears, we may begin to understand better the secret of his\nteachings, and of his influence in later times. When he was a boy\nof seven or eight years, the presence in Lu of Ki-chah, the\nlearned and virtuous brother of the barbarian King of Wu, must\nhave opened his eyes widely to the ominous rise, of a democratic\nand mixed China. Lu, like Tsin, was now beginning to suffer from\nthe “powerful family” plague; in other words, the story of King\nJohn and his barons was being rehearsed in China. Tsin and Ts’u\nhad patched up ancient enmities at the Peace Conference; Tsin\nduring the next twenty years administered snub after snub to the\nobsequious ruler of Lu, who was always turned back at the Yellow\nRiver whenever he started west to pay his respects. Lu, on the\nother hand, declined to attend the Ts’u durbar of 538, held by\nTs’u alone only after the approval of Tsin had been obtained. In\n522 the philosopher Yen-tsz, of Ts’i, accompanied his own marquess\nto Lu in order to study the rites there: this fact alone proves\nthat Ts’i, though orthodox and advanced, had not the same lofty\nspiritual status that was the pride of Lu. In 517 the Marquess of\nLu was driven from his throne, and Ts’i took the opportunity to\ninvade Lu under pretext of assisting him; however, the fugitive\npreferred Tsin as a refuge, and for many years was quartered at a\ntown near the common frontier. But the powerful families (all\nbranches of the same family as the duke himself) proved too strong\nfor him; they bribed the Tsin statesmen, and the Lu ruler died in\nexile in the year 510. In the year 500 Confucius became chief\ncounsellor to the new marquess, and by his energetic action drove\ninto exile in Tsin a very formidable agitator belonging to one of\nthe powerful family cliques. In 488 the King of Wu, after marching\non Ts’i, summoned Lu to furnish “one hundred sets of victims” as a\nmark of compliancy; the king and the marquess had an interview;\nthe next year the king came in person, and a treaty was made with\nhim under the very walls of K’ueh-fu, the Lu capital (this shameful\nfact is concealed by Confucius, who simply says: “Wu made war on\nus”). In 486 Lu somewhat basely joined Wu in an attack upon\northodox Ts’i. In 484-483 Confucius, who had meanwhile been\ntravelling abroad for some years in disgust, was urgently sent\nfor; four years later he died, a broken and disappointed man.",
        "Now, it is one thing to be told in general terms that Confucius\nrepresented conservative forces, disapproved of the quarrelsome\nwars of his day, and wished in theory to restore the good old\n\"rules of propriety\"; but quite another thing to understand in a\nhuman, matter-of-fact sort of way what he really did in definite\nsets of circumstances, and what practical objects he had in view.\nThe average European reader, not having specific facts and places\nunder his eye, can only conceive from this rough generalization,\nand from the usual anecdotal tit-bits told about him, that\nConfucius was an exceedingly timid, prudent, benevolent, and\nobsequious old gentleman who, as indeed his rival Lao-tsz hinted\nto him, was something like a superior dancing-master or court\nusher, But when the disjointed apothegms of his “Analects” (put\ntogether, not by himself, but by his disciples) are placed\nalongside the real human actions baldly touched upon in his own\n\"Springs and Autumns,” and as expanded by his three commentators,\none of them, at least, being a contemporary of his own, things\nassume quite a different complexion, Moreover, this last-mentioned\nor earliest in date of the expanders (see p. 91) also composed a\nchatty, anecdotal, and intimately descriptive account of Lu, Ts’i,\nTsin, CHENG, Ts’u, Wu, and Yiieh (of no other states except quite\nincidentally); and we have also the Bamboo Books dug up in 281\nA.D., being the Annals of Tsin and a sketch of general history\ndown to 299 B.C. Finally, the “father of history,” in about go\nB.C., published, or issued ready for publication, a resume\nof all the above (except what was in the Bamboo Books, which were\nthen, of course, unknown to him); so that we are able to compare\ndates, errors, misprints, concealments, and so on; not to mention\nthe advantage of reading all that the successive generations of\ncommentators have had to say.",
        "The matter may be compendiously stated as follows. Without\nattempting to go backward beyond the conquest by the Chou\nprincipality and the founding of a Chou dynasty in 122 B.C.\n(though there is really no reason to doubt the substantial\naccuracy of the vague “history” of patriarchal times, at least so\nfar back beyond that as to cover the 1000 years or more of the two\nprevious dynasties’ reigns), we may state that, whilst in general\nthe principles and ritual of the two previous dynasties were\nmaintained, a good many new ideas were introduced at this Chou\nconquest, and amongst other things, a compendious and all-\npervading practical ritual government, which not only marked off\nthe distinctions between classes, and laid down ceremonious rules\nfor ancestral sacrifice, social deportment, family duties,\ncultivation, finance, punishment, and so on, but endeavoured to\nbring all human actions whatsoever into practical harmony with\nsupposed natural laws; that is to say, to make them as regular, as\ncomprehensible, as beneficent, and as workable, as the perfectly\nmanifest but totally unexplained celestial movements were; as were\nthe rotation of seasons, the balancing of forces, the growth and\nwaning of matter, male and female reproduction, light and\ndarkness; and, in short, to make human actions as harmonious as\nwere all the forces of nature, which never fail or go wrong except\nunder (presumed) provocation, human or other. The Emperor, as\nVicar of God, was the ultimate judge of what was tao, or\nthe “right way.”",
        "Now this simple faith, when the whole of the Chinese Empire\nconsisted of about 50,000 square miles of level plain, inhabited\nprobably by not more than 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 homogeneous\npeople, was admirably suited for the patriarchal rule of a central\nchief (the King or Emperor), receiving simple tribute of metals,\nhemp, cattle, sacrificial supplies, etc.; entertaining his\nrelatives and princely friends when they came to do annual homage\nand to share in periodical sacrifice; declaring the penal laws\n(there were no other laws) for all his vassals; compassionating\nand conciliating the border tribes living beyond those vassals.\nBut this peaceful bucolic life, in the course of time and nature,\nnaturally produced a gradual increase in the population; the\nChinese cultivators spread themselves over the expanse of\nloess formed by the Yellow River and Desert deposits and by\naeons of decayed vegetation in the low-lying lands; no other\nnation or tribe within their ken having the faintest notion of\nwritten character, there was consequently no political cohesion of\nany sort amongst the non-Chinese tribes; the position was akin to\nthat of the European powers grafting themselves for centuries upon\nthe still primitive African tribes, comparatively few of which\nhave seen fit to turn the art of writing to the practical purpose\nof keeping records and cementing their own power. Wherever a\nChinese adventurer went, there he became founder of a state; to\nthis day we see enterprising Chinamen founding petty “dynasties\"\nin the Siamese Malay Peninsula; or, for instance, an Englishman\nlike Rajah Brooke founding a private dynasty in Borneo.",
        "Some of these frontier tribes, notably the Tartars, were of\naltogether too tough a material to be assimilated. They even\nendeavoured to check the Chinese advance beyond the Yellow River,\nand carried fire and sword themselves into the federal conclave.\nWhere resistance was nil or slight, as, for instance, among\nsome of the barbarians to the east, there the Chinese adventurers,\neither adopting native ways, or persuading the autochthones to\nadopt their ways, by levelling up or levelling down, developed\nstrong cohesive power; besides (owing to the difficulties of\ninter-communication) creating a feeling of independence and a\ndisinclination to obey the central power. The emperors who used in\nthe good old days to summon the vassals–a matter of a week or two\nin that small area–to chastise the wicked tribes on their\nfrontiers, gradually found themselves unable to cope with the more\ndistant Tartar hordes, the eastern barbarians of the coast, the\nAnnamese, Shans, and other unidentified tribes south of the Yang-\ntsz, as they had so easily done with nearer tribes when the\nChinese had not pushed out so far. Moreover, new-Chinese, Chinese-\nveneered, and half-Chinese states, recognizing their own\nresponsibilities, now interposed themselves as “buffers” or\nbarriers between the Emperor and the unadulterated barbarians;\nthese hybrid states themselves were quite as formidable to the\nimperial power as the displaced barbarians had formerly been.\nHence, as we have seen, the pitiful flight from his metropolis of\none Emperor after the other; the rise of great and wealthy persons\noutside the former limited sacred circle; the pretence of\nprotecting the Emperor, advanced by these rising powers, partly in\norder to gain prestige by using his imperial name in support of\ntheir local ambitions, and partly because–as during the Middle\nAges in the case of the Papacy–no one cared to brave the moral\nodium of annihilating a venerable spiritual power, even though\ngradually shorn of its temporal rights and influence.",
        "Lu was almost on a par with the imperial capital in all that\nconcerns learning, ritual, music, sacrifice, deportment, and\nspiritual prestige. Confucius, in his zeal for the recovery of\nimperial rights, was really no more of a stickler for mere form\nthan were Tsz-ch’an of Cheng, Ki-chah of Wu, Hiang Suh of Sung,\nShuh Hiang of Tsin, and others already enumerated; the only\ndistinguishing feature in his case was that he was not a high or\ninfluential official in his earlier days; besides, he was a Sung\nman by descent, and all the great families were of the Lu princely\ncaste. Thus, for want of better means to assert his own views, he\ntook to teaching and reading, to collecting historical facts, to\npointing morals and adorning tales. As a youth he was so clever,\nthat one of the Lu grandees, on his death-bed, foretold his\ngreatness. It was a great bitterness for him to see his successive\nprincely masters first the humble servants of Ts’i, then buffeted\nbetween Tsin and Ts’u, finally invaded and humiliated by barbarian\nWu, only to receive the final touches of charity at the hands of\nsavage Yiieh. His first act, when he at last obtained high office,\nwas to checkmate Ts’i, the man behind the ruler of which jealous\nstate feared that Lu might, under Confucius’ able rule, succeed in\nobtaining the Protectorate, and thus defeat his own insidious\ndesign to dethrone the legitimate Ts’i house. The wily Marquess of\nTs’i thereupon–of course at the instigation of the intriguing\n\"great families\"–tried another tack, and succeeded at last in\ncorrupting the vacillating Lu prince with presents of horses,\nracing chariots, and dancing women. Then it was (497) that\nConfucius set out disheartened on his travels. Recalled thirteen\nyears later, he soon afterwards began to devote his remaining\npowers to the Annals so frequently referred to above, and it was\nwhilst engaged in finishing this task that he had presentiments of\nhis coming end; he does not appear to have been able to exercise\nmuch political or advisory power after his return to Lu.",
        "During his thirteen years of travel (a more detailed account of\nwhich will be given in a subsequent Chapter), he found time to\nrevise and edit the books which appear to have formed the common\nstock-in-trade for all China; one of his ideas was to eliminate\nfrom these all sentiments of an anti-imperial nature. They were\nnot then called “classics,” but simply “The Book” (of History),\n\"The Poems” (still known by heart all over China), “The Rites” (as\nimproved by the Chou family), “The Changes” (a sort of cosmogony\ncombined with soothsaying), and “Music.”",
        "Let us now consider the notions of law as they existed in the\nprimitive Chinese mind. As all government was supposed to be based\non the natural laws of the universe, of which universal law or\norder of things, the Emperor, as “Son of Heaven,” was (subject to\nhis own obedience to it) the supreme mouthpiece or expression,\nthere lay upon him no duty to define that manifest law; when it\nwas broken, it was for him to say that it was broken, and to\npunish the breach. Nature’s bounty is the spring, and therefore\nrewards are conferred in spring; nature’s fall is in the autumn,\nwhich is the time for decreeing punishments; these are carried out\nin winter, when death steals over nature. A generous table\naccompanies the dispensing of rewards, a frugal table and no music\naccompanies the allotment of punishments; hence the imperial\nfeasts and fasts. Thus punishment rather than command is what was\nfirst understood by Law, and it is interesting to observe that\n\"making war” and “putting to death” head the list of imperial\nchastisements, war being thus regarded as the Emperor’s rod in the\nshape of a posse of punitory police, rather than as an expression\nof statecraft, ambitious greed, or vainglorious self-assertion.\nThen followed, in order of severity, castration, cutting off the\nfeet or the knee-cap, branding, and flogging. The Emperor, or his\nvassals, or the executive officers of each in the ruler’s name,\ndeclared the law, i.e. they declared the punishment in each\ncase of breach as it occurred. Thus from the very beginning the\nlegislative, judicial, and executive functions have never been\nclearly separated in the Chinese system of thought; new words have\nhad to be coined within the last two years in order to express\nthis distinction for purposes of law reform. Mercantile Law,\nFamily Law, Fishery Laws–in a word, all the mass of what we call\nCommercial and Civil Jurisprudence,–no more concerned the\nGovernment, so far as individual rights were concerned, than\nAgricultural Custom, Bankers’ Custom, Butchers’ Weights, and such\nlike petty matters; whenever these, or analogous matters, were\ntouched by the State, it was for commonwealth purposes, and not\nfor the maintenance of private rights. Each paterfamilias was\nabsolutely master of his own family; merchants managed their own\nbusiness freely; and so on with the rest. It was only when public\nsafety, Government interests, or the general weal was involved\nthat punishment-law stepped in and said,–always with tao,\n\"propriety,” or nature’s law in ultimate view: “you merchants may\nnot wear silk clothes\"; “you usurers must not ruin the agriculturalists\";\n\"you butchers must not irritate the gods of grain by killing cattle”:–\nthese are mere examples taken at random from much later times.",
        "The Emperor Muh, whose energies we have already seen displayed in\nTartar conquests and exploring excursions nearly a millennium\nbefore our era, was the first of the Chou dynasty to decide that\nlaw reform was necessary in order to maintain order among the\n\"hundred families” (still one of the expressions meaning “the\nChinese people”). A full translation of this code is given in Dr.\nLegge’s Chinese classics, where a special Chapter of The Book is\ndevoted to it: in charging his officer to prepare it, the Emperor\nonly uses the words “revise the punishments,” and the code itself\nis only known as the “Punishments” (of the marquess who drew it\nup); although it also prescribes many judicial forms, and lays\ndown precepts which are by no means all castigatory. The mere fact\nof its doing so is illustrative of reformed ideas in the embryo.\nThere is good ground to suppose that the Chinese Emperor’s “laws,\"\nsuch as they were at any given time, were solemnly and periodically\nproclaimed, in each vassal kingdom; but, subject to these general imperial\ndirections, the themis, dike or inspired decision of the\nmagistrate, was the sole deciding factor; and, of course, the ruler’s\narbitrary pleasure, whether that ruler were supreme or vassal, often\nran riot when he found himself strong enough to be unjust. For instance,\nin 894 B.C., the Emperor boiled alive one of the Ts’i rulers, an act that\nwas revenged by Ts’i 200 years later, as has been mentioned in previous\nChapters.",
        "In 796 B.C. a ruler of Lu was selected, or rather recommended to\nthe Emperor for selection, in preference to his elder brother,\nbecause “when he inflicted chastisement he never failed to\nascertain the exact instructions left by the ancient emperors.\"\nThis same Emperor had already, in 817, nominated one younger\nbrother to the throne of Lu, because he was considered the most\nattractive in appearance on an occasion when the brethren did\nhomage at the imperial court. For this caprice the Emperor’s\ncounsellor had censured him, saying: “If orders be not executed,\nthere is no government; if they be executed, but contrary to\nestablished rule, the people begin to despise their superiors.”",
        "In 746 B.C. the state of Ts’in, which had just then recently\nemerged from Tartar barbarism, and had settled down permanently in\nthe old imperial domain, first introduced the “three stock” law,\nunder which the three generations, or the three family connections\nof a criminal were executed for his crime as well as himself. In\n596 and 550 Tsin (which thus seems to have taken the hint from\nTs’in) exterminated the families of two political refugees who had\nfled to the Tartars and to Ts’i respectively. Even in Ts’u the\nrelatives of the man who first taught war to Wu were massacred in\n585, and any one succouring the fugitive King of Ts’u was\nthreatened with “three clan penalties\"; this last case was in the\nyear 529. The laws of Ts’u seem to have been particularly harsh;\nin 55 the premier was cut into four for corruption, and one\nquarter was sent in each direction, as a warning to the local\ndistricts. About 650 B.C. a distinguished Lu statesman, named\nTsang Wen-chung, seems to have drawn up a special code, for one of\nConfucius’ pupils (two centuries later) denounced it as being too\nsevere when compared with Tsz-ch’an’s mild laws–to be soon\nmentioned. Confucius himself also described the man as being “too\nshowy.” This Lu statesman, about twenty years later, made some\nsignificant and informing observations to the ruler of Lu when\nreport came that Tsin (the Second Protector) was endeavouring to\nget the Emperor to poison a federal refugee from Wei, about whose\nsuccession the powers were at the moment quarrelling. He said:\n\"There are only five recognized punishments: warlike arms, the\naxe, the knife or the saw, the branding instruments, the whip or\nthe bastinado; there are no surreptitious ones like this now\nproposed.” The result was that Lu, being of the same clan as the\nEmperor, easily succeeded in bribing the imperial officials to let\nthe refugee prince go. The grateful prince eagerly offered Tsang\nW&n-chung a reward; but the statesman declined to receive it, on\nthe ground that “a subject’s sayings are not supposed to be known\nbeyond his own master’s frontier.” About, a century later a\ndistinguished Tsin statesman, asking what “immortality” meant, was\ntold: “When a man dies, but when his words live; like the words of\nthis distinguished man, Tsang W&n-chung, of Lu state.” This same\nTsin statesman is said to have engraved some laws on iron (513),\nan act highly disapproved by Confucius. It is only by thus piecing\ntogether fragmentary allusions that we can arrive at the\nconclusion that “there were judges in those days.” Mention has\nbeen several times made in previous Chapters of Tsz-ch’an, whose\nconsummate diplomacy maintained the independence and even the\nfederal influence of the otherwise obscure state of Cheng during a\nwhole generation. In the year 536 B.C. he decided to cast the laws\nin metal for the information of the people: this course was\nbitterly distasteful to his colleague, Shuh Hiang of Tsin (see\nAppendix I.), and possibly the Tsin “laws on iron” just mentioned\nwere suggested by this experiment, for it must be remembered that\nTsin, Lu, Wei, and Cheng were all of the same imperial clan.\nConfucius, who had otherwise a genuine admiration for Tsz-ch’an,\ndisapproved of this particular feature in his career. In a minor\ndegree the same question of definition and publication has also\ncaused differences of opinion between English lawyers, so far as\nthe so-called “judge-made law” is concerned; it is still\nconsidered to be better practice to have it declared as\ncircumstances arise, than to have it set forth beforehand in a\ncode. The arguments are the same; in both cases the judges profess\nto “interpret” the law as it already exists; that is, the Chinese\njudge interprets the law of nature, and the English judge the\ncommon and statute laws; but neither wishes to hamper himself by\ntrying to publish in advance a scheme contrived to fit all future\nhypothetical cases.",
        "About 680 B.C. the King of Ts’u is recorded to have passed a law\nagainst harbouring criminals, under which the harbourer was liable\nto the same penalty as the thief; and at the same time reference\nis made by his advisers to an ancient law or command of the\nimperial dynasty, made before it came to power in 1122 B.C.-\"If\nany of your men takes to flight, let every effort be made to find\nhim.” Thus it would seem that other ruling classes, besides those\nof the Chou clan, accepted the general imperial laws, Chou-\nordained or otherwise. Although it is thus manifest that the\nvassal states, at least after imperial decadence set in, in 771\nB.C., drew up and published laws of their own, yet, at the great\ndurbar of princes held by the First Protector in 651 B.C., it is\nrecorded that the “Son of Heaven’s Prohibitions” were read over\nthe sacrificial victim. They are quite patriarchal in their\nlaconic style, and for that reason recall that of the Roman Twelve\nTables. They run: “Do not block springs!” “Do not hoard grain!\"\n\"Do not displace legitimate heirs!” “Do not make wives of your\nconcubines!” “Do not let women meddle with State affairs!” From\nthe Chinese point of view, all these are merely assertions of what\nis Nature’s law. In the year 640, the state of Lu applied the term\n\"Law Gate” to the South Gate, “because both Emperor and vassal\nprinces face south when they rule, and because that is,\naccordingly, the gate through which all commands and laws do\npass.” It is always possible, however, that this “facing south” of\nthe ancient ruler points to the direction whence some of his\npeople came, and towards which, as their guide and leader, he had\nto look in order to govern them.",
        "In the year 594 there is an instance cited where two dignitaries\nwere killed by direct specific order of the Emperor. In explaining\nthis exceptional case, the commentator says: “The lord of all\nbelow Heaven is Heaven, and Heaven’s continuer or successor is the\nPrince; whilst that which the Prince holds fast is the Sanction,\nwhich no subject can resist.”",
        "Not very long after Confucius’ death in 479 B.C., the powerful and\northodox state of Tsin, which had so long held its own against\nTs’in, Ts’i, and Ts’u, tottered visibly under the disintegrating\neffects of the “great family” intrigues: of the six great families\nwhich had, as representatives of the earlier eleven, latterly\nmonopolized power, three only survived internecine conflicts, and\nat last the surviving three split up into the independent states\nof Han, Wei, and Chao, those names being eponymous, as being their\nsub-fiefs, and, therefore, their “surnames,” or family names. In\nthe year 403 the Emperor formally recognized them as separate,\nindependent vassaldoms. Wei is otherwise known as Liang, owing to\nthe capital city having borne that name, and the kings of Liang\nare celebrated for their conversations with the peripatetic\nphilosopher, Mencius, in the fourth century B.C. In order to\ndistinguish this state from that of Wei (imperial clan) adjoining\nLu and Sung, we shall henceforth call it Ngwei, as, in fact, it\noriginally was pronounced, and as it still is in some modern\ndialects. The first of the Ngwei sovereigns had in his employ a\nstatesman named Li K’wei, who introduced, for taxation purposes, a\nnew system of land laws, and also new penal laws. These last were\nin six books, or main heads, and, it is said, represented all that\nwas best in the laws of the different feudal states, mostly in\nreference to robbery: the minor offences were roguery, getting\nover city walls, gambling, borrowing, dishonesty, lewdness,\nextravagance, and transgressing the ruler’s commands–their exact\nterms are now unknown. This code was afterwards styled the “Law\nClassic,” and its influence can be plainly traced, dynasty by\ndynasty, down to modern times; in fact, until a year or two ago,\nthe principles of Chinese law have never radically changed; each\nsuccessive ruling family has simply taken what it found; modifying\nwhat existed, in its own supposed interest, according to time,\nplace, and circumstance. Li K’wei’s land laws singularly resembled\nthose recommended to the Manchu Government by Sir Robert Hart four\nyears ago.",
        "It is difficult to guess how much truth there is in the ancient\ntraditions that the water-courses of the empire were improved\nthrough gigantic engineering works undertaken by the ancient\nEmperors of China. There is one gorge, well known to travellers,\nabove Ich’ang, on the River Yang-tsz, on the way to Ch’ung-k’ing,\nwhere the precipitous rocks on each side have the appearance and\nhardness of iron, and for a mile or more–perhaps several miles–\nstand perpendicularly like walls on both sides of the rapid Yang-\ntsz River: the most curious feature about them is that from below\nthe water-level, right up to the top, or as far as the eye can\nreach, the stone looks as though it had been chipped away with\npowerful cheese-scoops: it seems almost impossible that any\noperation of nature can have fashioned rocks in this way; on the\nother hand, what tools of sufficient hardness, driven by what\ngreat force, could hollow out a passage of such length, at such a\ndepth, and such a height? It is certain that after Ts’in conquered\nthe hitherto almost unknown kingdoms of Pa and Shuh (Eastern and\nWestern Sz Ch’wan) a Chinese engineer named Li Ping worked wonders\nin the canalization of the so-called CH’ENg-tu plain, or the rich\nlevel region lying around the capital city of Sz Ch’wan province,\nwhich was so long as Shuh endured also the metropolis of Shuh. The\nconsular officers of his Britannic Majesty have made a special\nstudy of these sluices, which are still in full working order, and\nthey seem almost unchanged in principle from the period (280 B.C.)\nwhen Li Ping lived. The Chinese still regard this branch of the\nGreat River as the source; or at least they did so until the\nJesuit surveys of two centuries ago proved otherwise; it was quite\nnatural that they should do so in ancient times, for the true\nupper course, and also Yiin Nan and Tibet through which that\ncourse runs, were totally unknown to them, and unheard of by name;\neven now the so-called Lolo country of Sz Ch’wan and Yiin Nan is\nmostly unexplored, and the mountain Lolos are quite independent of\nChina. The fact that they have whitish skins and a written script\nof their own (manifestly inspired by the form of Chinese\ncharacters) makes them a specially interesting people. Li Ping’s\nengineering feats also included the region around Ya-thou and Kia-\nting, as marked on the modern maps.",
        "The founder of the Hia dynasty (2205 B.C.) is supposed to have\nliberated the stagnant waters of the Yellow River and sent them to\nthe sea; as this is precisely what all succeeding dynasties have\ntried to do, and have been obliged to try, and what in our own\ntimes the late Li Hung-chang was ordered to do just before his\ndeath, there seems no good reason for suspecting the accuracy of\nthe tradition; the more especially as we see that the founder of\nthe Chou dynasty sent his chief political adviser and his two most\ndistinguished relatives to settle along this troublesome river’s\nlower course, as rulers of Ts’i, Yen, and Lu; the other\nconsiderable vassals were all ranged along the middle course.",
        "The original Chinese founder of the barbarian colony of Wu\nbelonged, as already explained, to the same clan or family as the\nfounder of the Chou dynasty, and in one respect even took\nancestral or spiritual precedence of him, because the emigrant had\nvoluntarily retired into obscurity with his brother in order to\nmake way for a third and more brilliant younger brother, whose\ngrandson it was that afterwards, in 1122 B.C., conquered China,\nand turned the Chou principality, hitherto vassal to the Shang\ndynasty, into the Chou dynasty, to which the surviving Shang\nprinces then became vassals in the Sung state and elsewhere. Even\nthough the founder of Wu may have adopted barbarian ways, such as\ntattooing, hair-cutting, and the like, he must have possessed\nconsiderable administrative power, for he made a canal (running\npast his capital) for a distance of thirty English miles along the\nnew “British” railway from Wu-sih to Ch’ang-shuh, as marked on\npresent maps; his idea was to facilitate boat-travelling, and to\nassist cultivators with water supplies for irrigation.",
        "In the year 485 B.C. the King of Wu, who was then in the hey-day\nof his success, and by way of becoming Protector of China, erected\na wall and fortifications round the well-known modern city of\nYangchow (where Marco Polo 1700 years later acted as governor); he\nnext proceeded for the first time in history to establish water\ncommunication between the Yang-tsz River and the River Hwai; this\ncanal was then (483-481) continued farther north, so as to give\ncommunication with the southern and central parts of modern Shan\nTung province.",
        "His object was to facilitate the conveyance of stores for his\narmies, then engaged in bringing pressure upon Ts’i (North Shan\nTung) and Lu (South Shan Tung). He succeeded in getting his boats\nto the River Tsi, running past Tsi-nan Fu, and to the River I,\nrunning past I-thou Fu, thus dominating the whole Shan Tung\nregion; for these two were then the only navigable rivers in Shan\nTung besides the Sz. The River Tsi is now taken possession of by\nthe Yellow River, which, as we have shown, then ran a parallel\ncourse much to the westward of it; and the River I then ran south\ninto the River Sz, which, as already explained, has in its lower\ncourse, in comparatively modern times, been taken possession of\npermanently by the Grand Canal; but the upper course of the Sz,\nnow, as then, ran past Confucius’ town, the Lu metropolis, of\nK’ueh-fu. In 483 B.C. the same king cast his faithful adviser (of\nTs’u origin) into the canal by which the waters of lake T’ai Hu\nnow run to modern Soochow, and thence to Hangchow. Ever since that\ndate the unfortunate man in question has been a popular “god of\nthe waters” in those parts. It follows, therefore, that the Wu\nfounder’s modest canal must have been from time to time extended,\nat least in an easterly direction. It was only after the conquest\nof China by Ts’in, 250 years later, that the First August Emperor\nextended this system of canals northwards and westwards, from\nCh’ang-thou Fu to Tan-yang and Chinkiang, as marked on the modern\nmaps. Thus the barbarian kings of Wu have found the true alignment\nof our “British”, railway for us; and, so far as the northern\ncanal is concerned, have really achieved the task for which credit\nis usually given to Kublai Khan, the Mongol patron of Marco Polo.\nKublai merely improved the old work. The ancient Wu capital was 10\nEnglish miles south-east of Wu-sih, and 17 miles north of Soochow,\nto which place the capital was transferred in the year 513 B.C.,\nas it was more suitable than the old capital for the arsenals and\nship-building yards then, for the first time, being built on an\nextensive scale by the King of Wu.",
        "The first bridge over the Yellow River was constructed by the\nkingdom of Ts’in in 257 B.C., on what is still the high-road\nbetween T’ung-thou Fu and P’u-chou Fu. Previous to that date\narmies had to cross the Yellow River at the fords; and, as an\ninstance of this, it may be stated that the founder of the Chou\ndynasty in 1122 B.C. summoned his vassals to meet him at the Ford\nof Meng, a place still so marked on the maps, and lying on the\nhigh-road between the two modern cities of Ho-nan Fu and Hwai-\nk’ing Fu; thus there was no excuse for the feudal princes failing\nto arrive at the rendezvous. It was not far from the same place,\nbut on the north bank of the river, that Tsin in 632 B.C. held the\ngreat durbar as Second Protector, on the notorious occasion when\nthe puppet Emperor was “sent for” by the Tsin dictator. To conceal\nthis outrage on “the rites,” Confucius says: “The Son of Heaven\nwent in camp north of the river.” To go on hunt, or in camp, is\nstill a vague historical expression for “go on fief inspection,\"\nand it was so used in 1858, when the Manchu Emperor Hien-feng took\nrefuge from the allied troops at Jehol in Tartary.",
        "The first thing Ts’in did when it united the empire in 221 B.C.\nwas to occupy all the fords and narrow passes, and to put them in\nworking order for the passage of armies. As even now the lower\nYellow River is only navigable for large craft for 20 miles from\nits mouth (now in Shan Tung), it is easy to imagine how many fords\nthere must have been in its shallow waters, and also how it came\nto pass that boats were so little used to convey large bodies of\ntroops with their stores.",
        "The great wall of China of 217 B.C. was by no means the first of\nits kind. A century before that date Ts’in built a long wall to\nkeep off the Tartars; and, half a century before that again, Ngwei\n(one of the three powerful families of Tsin, all made independent\nprinces in 403) had built a wall to keep off its western neighbour\nTs’in; both these walls seem to have been in the north part of the\nmodern Shen Si region, and they were possibly portions of the\nlater continuous great wall of the August Emperor, which occupied\nthe forced energies of 700,000 men. There is a statement that the\nsame Emperor set 700,000 eunuchs to work on the palaces and the\ntomb he was constructing for himself at his new metropolis (moved\nsince 350 B.C. to the city of Hien-yang, north of the river Wei,\nopposite the present Si-ngan Fu). This probably means, not that\neunuchs were common in those times as palace employes, but\nthat castration still was the usual punishment inflicted\nthroughout China for grave offences not calling for the penalty of\ndeath, or for the more serious forms of maiming, such as foot-\nchopping or knee-slicing; and that all the prisoners of that\ndegree were told off to do productive work: although humiliatingly\ndeformed, they were still available for the common purposes of\nnative life, and their defenceless and forlorn plight would\nprobably make it an easier matter to handle them in gangs than to\nhandle sound males; and if they died off under the rough treatment\nof task-masters, they would have no families to mourn or avenge\nthem in accordance with family duty; for a eunuch has no name and\nno family. The palaces in question were joined by a magnificent\nbridge on the high-road between Hien-yang and Si-ngan. This very\nyear a German firm has contracted to build an iron bridge over the\nYellow River at Lan-thou Fu, where crossed by Major Bruce.",
        "There are singularly few descriptions of cities in ancient Chinese\nhistory, but here again we may safely assume that most of them\nwere in principle, if only on a small scale, very much what they\nare now, mere inartistic, badly built collections of hovels. Soul,\nthe quaint capital of Corea, as it appeared in its virgin\ncondition to its European discoverers twenty-five years ago,\nprobably then closely resembled an ancient vassal Chinese prince’s\ncapital of the very best kind. Modern trade is responsible for the\nwealthy commercial streets now to be found in all large Chinese\ncities; but a small hien city in the interior–and it must\nbe remembered that a hien circuit or district corresponds\nto an old marquisate or feudal principality of the vassal unit\ntype–is often a poor, dusty, dirty, depressing, ramshackle\nagglomeration of villages or hamlets, surrounded by a disproportionately\npretentious wall, the cubic contents of which wall alone would more\nthan suffice to build in superior style the whole mud city within; for half\nthe area of the interior is apt to be waste land or stagnant puddles: it\nwas so even in Peking forty years ago, and possibly is so still except\nin the “Legation quarter.”",
        "In 745 B.C., when the Tsin marquess foolishly divided his\npatrimony with a collateral branch, the capital town of this\nsubdivided state is stated to have been a greater place than the\nold capital. They are both of them still in existence as\ninsignificant towns, situated quite close together on the same\nbranch of the River Fen (the only navigable river) in South Shan\nSi; marked with their old names, too; that is to say, K’iih-wuh\nand Yih-CH’ENg. It was only after the younger branch annexed the\nelder in 679 that Tsin became powerful and began to expand; and it\nwas only when a policy of “home rule” and disintegration set in,\ninvolving the splitting up of Tsin’s orthodox power into three\nroyal states of doubtful orthodoxy, that China fell a prey to\nTs’in ambition. Absit omen to us.",
        "In 560, when the deformed philosopher Yen-tsz visited Ts’u, and\nentertained that semi-barbarous court with his witticisms, he took\nthe opportunity boastfully to enlarge upon the magnificence of\nLin-tsz (still so marked), the capital of Ts’i. “It is,” said he,\n\"surrounded by a hundred villages; the parasols of the walkers\nobscure the sky, whose perspiration runs in such streams as to\ncause rain; their shoulders and heels touch together, so closely\nare they packed.” The assembled Ts’u court, with mouths open, but\ninclined for sport at the cost of their visitor, said: “If it is\nsuch a grand place, why do they select you?” Yen-tsz played a\ntrump card when he replied: “Because I am such a mean-looking\nfellow,\"–meaning, as explained in Chapter IX., that “any pitiful\nrascal is good enough to send to Ts’u.” Exaggerations apart,\nhowever, there is every reason to believe that the statesman-\nphilosopher Kwan-tsz, a century before that date, had really\norganized a magnificent city. A full description of how he\nreconstructed the economic life of both city and people is given\nin the Kwoh-yue (see Chapter XVII.), the authenticity of\nwhich work, though not free from question, is, after all, only\nsubject to the same class of criticism as Renan lavishes upon one\nor two of the Gospels, the general tenor of which, be says, must\nnone the less be accepted, with all faults, as the bonafide\nattempt of some one, more or less contemporary, to represent what\nwas then generally supposed to be the truth.",
        "Ts’u itself must have had something considerable to show in the\nway of public buildings, for in the year 542 B.C. after paying a\nvisit to that country in accordance with the provisions of the\nPeace Conference of 546, the ruler of Lu built himself a palace in\nimitation of one he saw there. The original capital of Wu (see\nChapter VII.) was a poor place, and is described as having\nconsisted of low houses in narrow streets, with a vulgar palace;\nthis was in 523. In 513 a new king moved to the site now occupied\nby Soochow, and he seems to have made of it the magnificent city\nit has remained ever since–the place, of course it will be\nremembered, where General Gordon and Li Hung-chang had their\ncelebrated quarrel about decapitating surrendered rebels. There\nwere eight gates, besides eight water-gates for boats; it was\neight English miles in circuit, and contained the palace, several\ntowers (pagodas, being Buddhist, were then naturally unknown),\nkiosks, ponds, and duck preserves. The extensive arsenal and ship-\nyard was quite separate from the main town. No city in the\northodox part of China is so closely described as this one, nor is\nit likely that there were many of them so vast in extent.",
        "Judging by the frequency with which Ts’in moved its capitals (but\nalways within a limited area in the Wei valley, between that river\nand its tributary the K’ien), they cannot have been very important\nor substantial places; in fact, there are no descriptions of early\nTs’in economic life at all; and, for all we know to the contrary,\nthe headquarters of Duke Muh, when he entered upon his reforms in\nthe seventh century B.C., may have resembled a Tartar encampment.\nThe Kwoh-yue has no Chapter devoted to Ts’in, which (as indeed\nstated) for 500 years lived a quite isolated life of its own. In later\ntimes, especially after the reforms introduced by the celebrated\nChinese princely adventurer, Wei Yang, during the period 360–340,\nthe land administration was reconstituted, the capital was finally moved\nto Hien-yang, and every effort was made to develop all the resources\nof the country. Ts’in then possessed 41 hien, those with a\npopulation of under 10,000 having a governor with a lower title than\nthe governors of the larger towns, Probably the total population of\nTs’in by this time reached 3,000,000. A century later, when the First\nAugust Emperor was conquering China, armies of half a million men\non each side were not at all uncommon. When his conquests were\ncomplete, he set about building palaces on both banks of the Wei in\nmost lavish style, as narrated in the last Chapter. It is said of him that,\n\"as he conquered each vassal prince, he had a sketch made of his\npalace buildings,” and, with these before him as models, he lined\nthe river with rows of beautiful edifices,–evidently, from the\ndescription given, much resembling those lying along the Golden\nHorn at Constantinople; if not in quality, at least in general\nspectacular arrangement.",
        "As to the minor orthodox states grouped along the Yellow River,\nthey seem to have shifted their capitals on very slight\nprovocation; scarcely one of them remained from first to last in\nthe same place. To take one as an instance, the state of Hu, an\northodox state belonging to the same clan name as Ts’i. The\nhistory of this petty principality or barony is only exactly known\nfrom the time when Confucius’ history begins, and it was\ncontinually being oppressed by Cheng and Ts’u, its more powerful\nneighbours; in 576, 533, 524 and onwards from that, there were\nincessant removals, so that even the native commentators say: “it\nwas just like shifting a village, so superficial an affair was\nit.” The accepted belles lettres style (see p. 78) of saying\n\"my country” is still the ancient pi-yih or “unworthy village”:\nthe Empress of China once (about 190 B.C.) used this expression,\neven after the whole of China had been united, in order to reject\npolitely the offer of marriage conveyed to her by a powerful Tartar\nking. The expression is particularly interesting, inasmuch as it recalls,\nas we have already pointed out, a time when the “country” of each\nfeudal chief was simply his mud village and the few square miles of\nfields around it, which were naturally divided off from the next chief’s\nterritory by hills and streams. On the Burmo-Chinese frontier there are\nat this moment many Kakhyen “kings” of this kind, each of them ruling\nover his mountain or valley, and supreme in his own domain.",
        "That there were walled cities in China (apart from the Emperor’s,\nwhich, of course, would be “the city” par excellence) is\nplain from the language used at durbars, which were always held\n\"outside the walls.” In the loess plains there could not\nhave been any stone whatever for building purposes, and there is\nlittle, if any, specific mention of brick. Probably the walls were\nof adobe, i.e. of mud, beaten down between two rigid planks,\nremoved higher as the wall dries below. This is the way most of\nthe houses are still built in modern Peking, and perhaps also in\nmost parts of China, at least where stone (or brick) is not\ncheaper; the “barbarian” parts of China are still the best built;\nfor instance, CH’ENg-tu in Sz Ch’wan, Canton in the south. Hankow\n(Ts’u) is a comparatively poor place; Peking the dingiest of all.\nChinkiang is a purely loess country.",
        "At the time of the unification of China, during the middle of the\nthird century B.C., the Ts’in armies found it necessary to flood\nTa-liang or “Great Liang,” the capital of Ngwei (otherwise called\nLiang), corresponding to the modern K’ai-feng Fu, the Jewish\ncentre in Ho Nan province: the waters of the Yellow River were\nallowed to flood the country (this was again done by the Tai-p’ing\nrebels fifty years ago, when the Jews suffered like other people,\nand lost their synagogue), the walls of which collapsed. It is\nevident that the ancient city walls could not have been such\nsolid, brick-faced walls as we now see round Peking and Nanking,\nbut simply mud ramparts.",
        "We must turn to unorthodox China once more, and see how it fared\nafter Confucius’ death. After only a short century of international\nexistence, the vigorous state of Wu perished once for all in the\nyear 473 B.C., and the remains of the ruling caste escaped\neastwards in boats. When for the first time embassies between\nthe Japanese and the Chinese became fairly regular, in the\nsecond and third centuries of our era, there began to be\npersistent statements made in standard Chinese history that the\nthen ruling powers in Japan considered themselves in some way\nlineally connected with a Chinese Emperor of 2100 B.C., and with\nhis descendants, their ancestors, who, it was said, escaped from\nWu to China. This is the reason why, in Chapter VII., we have\nsuggested, not that the population of Japan came from China, but\nthat some of the semi-barbarous descendants of those ancient\nChinese princes who first colonized the then purely barbarous Wu,\nfinding their power destroyed in 473 B.C. by the neighbouring\nbarbarous power of Yueeh, settled in Japan, and continued their\ncivilizing mission in quite a new sphere. Many years ago I\nendeavoured, in various papers published in China and Japan, to\nshow that, apart from Chinese words adopted into Japanese ever\nsince A.D. 1 from the two separate sources of North China by land\nand Central China by sea, there is clear reason to detect, in the\nsupposed pure Japanese language, as it was anterior to those\nimportations, an admixture of Chinese words adopted much earlier\nthan A.D. 1, and incorporated into the current tongue at a time\nwhen there was no means or thought of “nailing the sounds down” by\nany phonetic system of writing. There is much other very sound\nChinese historical evidence in favour of the migration view, and\nit has been best summarized in an excellent little work in German,\nby Rev. A. Tschepe, S.J., published in the interior of Shan Tung\nprovince only last year.",
        "The ancient native names for Wu and Yiieh, according to the clumsy\nConfucian way of writing them, were something like Keu-ngu\nand O-viet (see Chapter VII.); but it is quite hopeless to\nattempt reconstruction of the exact sounds intended then to be\nexpressed by syllables which, in Chinese itself, have quite\nchanged in power. The power of Yueeh was supreme after 473; its\nking was voted Protector by the federal princes, and in 472 he\nheld a grand durbar at the “Lang-ya Terrace,” which place is no\nlonger exactly identifiable, but is probably nothing more than the\nGerman settlement at Kiao Chou; in 468 he transferred his capital\nthither, and it remained there for over a century, till 379: but\nhis power, it seems, was almost purely maritime, and he never\nsucceeded in obtaining a sure footing north of or even in the Hwai\nvalley, the greater part of which he subsequently returned to\nTs’u. It must be remembered that the Hwai then had a free course\nto the sea, and of a part of it, the now extinct Sui valley, the\nYellow River took possession for several centuries up to 1851 A.D.\nHe also returned to Sung the territory Wu had taken from her, and\nmade over to Lu 100 li square (30 miles) to the east of the\nRiver Sz; to understand this it must be remembered, at the cost of\na little iteration, that Sung and Lu were the two chief powers of\nthe middle and lower Sz valley, which is now entirely monopolized\nby the Grand Canal.",

        "The imperial dynasty went from bad to worse; in 440 there were\nfamily intrigues, assassinations, and divisions. The imperial\nmetropolis, which was towards the end about all the Emperors had\nleft to them, was divided into two, each half ruled by an Eastern\nand a Western Emperor respectively; unfortunately, no literature\nhas survived which might depict for us the life of the inhabitants\nduring those wretched days. Meanwhile, the ambitious great\nfamilies of Tsin very nearly fell under the dictatorship of one of\ntheir number; in 452 he was himself annihilated by a combination\nof the others, and the upshot of it was that next year the three\nfamilies that had crushed the dictator and, emerged victorious,\ndivided up the realm of Tsin into three separate and practically\nindependent states, called respectively Wei or Ngwei (the Shan Si\nparts), Han (the Ho Nan parts), and Chao (the Chih Li parts). The\nother ancient and more orthodox state of Wei, occupying the Yellow\nRiver valley to the west of Sung and Lu, was now a mere vassal to\nthese three Tsin powers, which had not quite yet declared\nthemselves independent, and which had for the present left the old\nTsin capital to the direct administration of the legitimate\nprince. It was only in the year 403 that the Emperor’s administration\nformally declared them to be feudal princes. This year is really the\nnext great turning-point in Chinese history, in order of date, after the\nflight of the Emperors from their old capital in 771 B.C.; and it is, in\nfact, with this year that the great modern historical work of Sz-ma\nKwang begins; it was published A.D. 1084, and brings Chinese\nevents down to a century previous to that date.",
        "As to the state of Ts’i, it also had fallen into evil ways. So\nearly as 539 B.C., when the two philosophers Yen-tsz and Shuh\nHiang had confided to each other their mutual sorrows (see\nAppendix No. 2), the former had predicted that the powerful local\nfamily of T’ien or Ch’en was slowly but surely undermining the\nlegitimate princely house, and would certainly end by seizing the\nthrone; one of the methods adopted by the supplanting family was\nto lend money to the people on very favourable terms, and so to\nmanipulate the grain measures that the taxes due to the prince\nwere made lighter to bear; in this ingenious and indirect way, all\nthe odium of taxation was thrown upon the extravagant princes who\nhabitually squandered their resources, whilst the credit for\ngenerosity was turned towards this powerful tax-farming family,\nwhich thus took care of its own financial interests, and at the\nsame time secured the affections of the people. In 481 the\nambitious T’ien Heng, alias CH’EN Ch’ang, then acting as\nhereditary maire du palais to the legitimate house, assassinated\nthe ruling prince, an act so shocking from the orthodox point of view that\nConfucius was quite heartbroken on learning of it, notwithstanding that his\nown prince had narrowly escaped assassination at the hands of the\nmurdered man’s grandfather. It was not until the year 391, however, that\nthe T’ien, or CH’EN, family, after setting up and deposing princes at\ntheir pleasure for nearly a century, at last openly threw off the\nmask and usurped the Ts’i throne: their title was officially\nrecognized by the Son of Heaven in the year 378.",
        "As to Ts’in ambitions, for a couple of centuries past there had\nbeen no further advance of conquest, at least in China. The\nhitherto almost unheard of state of Shuh (Sz Ch’wan) now begins to\ncome prominently forward, and to contest with Ts’in mastery of the\nupper course of the Yang-tsz River. After being for 260 years in\nunchallenged possession of all territory west of the Yellow River,\nTs’in once more lost this to Tsin (i.e. to Ngwei) in 385.\nIt was not until the other state of Wei, lower down the Yellow\nRiver, lost its individuality as an independent country that the\ncelebrated Prince Wei Yang (see Chapter XXII.), having no career\nat home, offered his services to Ts’in, and that this latter\nstate, availing itself to the full of his knowledge, suddenly shot\nforth in the light of real progress. We have seen in Chapter XX.\nthat an eminent lawyer and statesman of Ngwei, Ts’in’s immediate\nrival on the east, had inaugurated a new legal code and an\neconomic land system. This man’s work had fallen under the\ncognizance of Wei Yang, who carried it with him to Ts’in, where it\nwas immediately utilized to such advantage that Ts’in a century\nlater was enabled to organize her resources thoroughly, and thus\nconquered the whole empire,",
        "We have now arrived at what is usually called the Six Kingdom\nPeriod, or, if we include Ts’in, against whose menacing power the\nsix states were often in alliance, the period of the Seven\nKingdoms. These were the three equally powerful states of Ngwei,\nHan, and Chao (this last very Tartar in spirit, owing to its\nhaving absorbed nearly all the Turko-Tartar tribes west of the\nYellow River mouth); the northernmost state of Yen, which seems in\nthe same way to have absorbed or to have exercised a strong\ncontrolling influence over the Manchu-Corean group of tribes\nextending from the Liao River to the Chao frontier; Ts’u, which\nnow had the whole south of China entirely to itself, and managed\neven to amalgamate the coast states of Yiich in 334; and finally Ts’i.\nIn other words, the orthodox Chinese princes, whose comparatively\npetty principalities in modern Ho Nan province had for several centuries\nformed a sort of cock-pit in which Ts’in, Tsin, Ts’i, and Ts’u fought out\ntheir rivalries, had totally disappeared as independent and even as\ninfluential powers, and had been either absorbed by those four great\npowers (of which Tsin and Ts’i were in reconstituted form), or had\nbecome mere obedient vassals to one or the other of them. In former\ntimes Tsin had been kinsman and defender; but now Tsin, broken up\ninto three of strange clans, herself afforded an easy prey to Ts’in\nambition; the orthodox states were in the defenceless position of the\nGreek states after Alexander had exhausted Macedon in his Persian\nwars, and when their last hope, Pyrrhus, had taught the Romans the art\nof war: they had only escaped Persia to fall into the jaws of\nRome.",
        "In the middle of the fourth century B.C. all six powers began to\nstyle themselves wang, or “king,” which, as explained before,\nwas the title borne by the Emperors of the Chou dynasty. Military,\npolitical, and literary activities were very great after this at the\ndifferent emulous royal courts, and, however much the literary\npedants of the day may have bewailed the decay of the good\nold times, there can be no doubt that life was now much more\nvaried, more occupied, and more interesting than in the sleepy,\nrespectable, patriarchal days of old. The “Fighting State” Period,\nas expounded in the Chan-Kwoh Ts’eh, or “Fighting State\nRecords,” is the true period of Chinese chivalry, or knight-\nerrantry.",
        "The emperors of the dynasty of Chou, which came formally into\npower in 1122 B.C., we have seen took no other title than that of\nwang, which is usually considered by Europeans to mean “king\"; in\nmodern times it is applied to the rulers of (what until recently\nwere) tributary states, such as Loochoo, Annam, and Corea; to\nforeign rulers (unless they insist on a higher title); and to\nManchu and Mongol princes of the blood, and mediatized princes.\nConfucius in his history at first always alludes to the Emperor\nwhilst living as t’ien-wang, or “the heavenly king\"; it is\nnot until in speaking of the year 583 that he uses the old term\nt’ien-tsz, or “Son of Heaven,” in alluding to the reigning\nEmperor. After an emperor’s death he is spoken of by his\nposthumous name; as, for instance, Wu Wang, the “Warrior King,\"\nand so on: these posthumous names were only introduced (as a\nregular system) by the Chou dynasty.",
        "The monarchs of the two dynasties Hia (2205-1767) and Shang (1766-\n1123) which preceded that of Chou, and also the somewhat mythical\nrulers who preceded those two dynasties, were called Ti, a\nword commonly translated by Western nations as “Emperor.” For many\ngenerations past the Japanese, in order better to assert vis-a-\nvis of China their international rank, have accordingly made\nuse of the hybrid expression “Ti-state,” by which they seek\nto convey the European idea of an “empire,” or a state ruled over\nby a monarch in some way superior to a mere king, which is the\nhighest title China has ever willingly accorded to a foreign\nprince; this royal functionary in her eyes is, or was, almost\nsynonymous with “tributary prince.” Curiously enough, this “dog-\nChinese” (Japanese) expression is now being reimported into\nChinese political literature, together with many other excruciating\ncombinations, a few of European, but mostly of Japanese manufacture,\nintended to represent such Western ideas as “executive and legislative,\"\n\"constitutional,” “ministerial responsibility,” “party,” “political view,\"\nand so on. But we ourselves must not forget, in dealing with the particular\nword “imperial,” that the Romans first extended the military title of\nimperator to the permanent holder of the “command,” simply because\nthe ancient and haughty word of “king” was, after the expulsion of\nthe kings, viewed with such jealousy by the people of Rome that\neven of Caesar it is said that he did thrice refuse the title, So\nthe ancient Chinese Ti, standing alone, was at first applied both\nto Shang Ti or “God” and to his Vicar on Earth, the Ti or Supreme\nRuler of the Chinese world. Even Lao-tsz (sixth century B.C.), in\nhis revolutionary philosophy, considers the “king” or “emperor” as\none of the moral forces of nature, on a par with “heaven,\"\n\"earth,” and “Tao (or Providence).” When we reflect what petty\n\"worlds” the Assyrian, Egyptian, and Greek worlds were, we can\nhardly blame the Chinese, who had probably been settled in Ho Nan\njust as long as the Western ruling races had been in Assyria and\nEgypt respectively, for imagining that they, the sole recorders of\nevents amongst surrounding inferiors, were the world; and that the\nincoherent tribes rushing aimlessly from all sides to attack them,\nwere the unreclaimed fringe of the world.",
        "It does not appear clearly why the Chou dynasty took the new title\nof wang, which does not seem to occur in any titular sense\nprevious to their accession: the Chinese attempts to furnish\netymological explanation are too crude to be worth discussing. No\nfeudal Chinese prince presumed to use it during the Chou\nregime and if the semi-barbarous rulers of Ts’u, Wu, and\nYiieh did so in their own dominions (as the Hwang Ti, or “august\nemperor,” of Annam was in recent times tacitly allowed to do),\ntheir federal title in orthodox China never went beyond that of\nviscount. When in the fourth century B.C. all the powers styled\nthemselves wang, and were recognized as such by the insignificant\nemperors, the situation was very much the same as that produced in\nEurope when first local Caesars, who, to begin with, had been\n\"associates” of the Augustus (or two rival Augusti), asserted their\nindependence of the feeble central Augustus, and then set themselves\nup as Augusti pure and simple, until at last the only “Roman Emperor\"\nleft in Rome was the Emperor of Germany.",
        "It is not explained precisely on what grounds, when the first Chou\nemperors distributed their fiefs, some of the feudal rulers, as\nexplained in Chapter VII., were made dukes; others marquesses,\nearls, viscounts, and barons. Of course these translated terms are\nmere makeshifts, simply because the Chinese had five ranks, and so\nhave we. In creating their new nobility, the Japanese have again\nmade use of the five old Chinese titles, except that for some\nreason they call Duke Ito and Duke Yamagata “Prince” in English.\nThe size of the fiefs had something to do with it in China; the\npedigree of the feoffees probably more; imperial clandom perhaps\nmost of all. The sole state ruled by a duke in his own intrinsic\nright from the first was Sung, a small principality on the\nnorthernmost head-waters of the River Hwai, corresponding to the\nmodern Kwei-t&h Fu: probably it was because this duke fulfilled\nthe sacrificial and continuity duties of the destroyed dynasty of\nShang that he received extraordinary rank; just as, in very much\nlater days, the Confucius family was the only non-Manchu to\npossess “ducal” rank, or, as the Japanese seem to hold in German\nstyle, “princely” rank. But it must be remembered that the Chou\nemperors had imperial dukes within their own appanage, precisely\nas cardinals, or “princes of the Church,” are as common around\nRome as they are scarce among the spiritually “feudal” princes of\nEurope; for feudal they once practically were.",
        "Confucius’ petty state of Lu was founded by the Duke of Chou,\nbrother of the founder posthumously called the Wu Wang, or the\n\"Warrior King”: for many generations those Dukes of Lu seem to\nhave resided at or near the metropolis, and to have assisted the\nEmperors with their advice as counsellors on the spot, as well as\nto have visited at intervals and ruled their own distant state,\nwhich was separated from Sung by the River Sz and by the marsh or\nlakes through which that river ran. Yet Lu as a state had only the\nrank of a marquisate ruled by a marquess.",
        "Another close and influential relative of the founder or “Warrior\nKing” was the Duke of Shao, who was infeoffed in Yen (the Peking\nplain), and whose descendants, like those of the Duke of Chou,\nseem to have done double duty at the metropolis and in their own\nfeudal appanage. Confucius’ history scarcely records anything of\nan international kind about Yen, which was a petty, feeble region,\ndovetailed in between Tsin and Ts’i, quite isolated, and occupied\nin civilizing some of the various Tartar and Corean barbarians;\nbut it must have gradually increased in wealth and resources like\nall the other Chinese states; for, as we have seen in the last\nChapter, the Earls of Yen blossomed out into Kings at the\nbeginning of the fourth century B.C., and the philosopher Mencius,\nwhen advising the King of Ts’i, even strongly recommended him to\nmake war on the rising Yen power. The founder of Ts’i was the\nchief adviser of the Chou founder, but was not of his family name;\nhis ancestors–also the ancestors later on claimed by certain\nTartar rulers of China–go back to one of the ultra-mythical\nEmperors of China; his descendants bore, under the Chou dynasty,\nthe dignity of marquess, and reigned without a break until, as\nalready related, the T’ien or Ch’en family, emanating from the\northodox state of Ch’en, usurped the throne. Ts’i was always a\npowerful and highly civilized state; on one occasion, in 589 B.C.,\nas mentioned in Chapter VI., its capital was desecrated by Tsin;\nand on another, a century later, the overbearing King of Wu\ninvaded the country. After the title of king was taken in 378\nB.C., the court of Ts’i became quite a fashionable centre, and the\ngay resort of literary men, scientists, and philosophers of all\nkinds, Taoists included.",
        "Tsin, like Ts’i, was of marquess rank, and though its ruling\nfamily was occasionally largely impregnated with Tartar blood by\nmarriage, it was not much more so than the imperial family itself\nhad sometimes been, The Chinese have never objected to Tartars\nqua Tartars, except as persons who “let their hair fly,\"\n\"button their coats on the wrong side,” and do not practise the\northodox rites; so soon as these defects are remedied, they are\neligible for citizenship on equal terms. There has never been any\nrace question or colour question in China, perhaps because the\nskin is yellow in whichever direction you turn; but it is\ndifficult to conceive of the African races being clothed with\nChinese citizenship.",
        "Wei was a small state lying between the Yellow River as it now is\nand the same river as it then was: it was given to a brother of\nthe founder of the Chou dynasty, and his subjects, like those of\nthe Sung duke, consisted largely of the remains of the Shang\ndynasty; from which circumstance we may conclude that the so-\ncalled “dynasties,” including that of Chou, were simply different\nruling clans of one and the same people, very much like the\ndifferent Jewish tribes, of which the tribe of Levi was the most\n\"spiritual”: that peculiarity may account for the universal\nunreadiness to cut off sacrifices and destroy tombs, an outrage we\nonly hear of between barbarians, as, for instance, when Wu sacked\nthe capital of Ts’u. We have seen in Chapter XII. that a reigning\nduke even respected at least some of the sacrificial rights of a\ntraitor subject.",
        "The important state of CHENG, lying to the eastward of the\nimperial reserve, was only founded in the ninth century B.C. by\none of the then Emperor’s sons; to get across to each other, the\ngreat states north and south of the orthodox nucleus had usually\nto “beg road” of CHENG, which territory, therefore, became a\nfavourite fighting-ground; the rulers were earls. Ts’ao (earls)\nand Ts’ai (marquesses) were small states to the north and south of\nCHENG, both of the imperial family name. The state of CH’EN was\nruled by the descendants of the Emperor Shun, the monarch who\npreceded the Hia dynasty, and who, as stated before, is supposed\nto have been buried in the (modern) province of Hu Nan, south of\nthe Yang-tsz River: they were marquesses. These three last-named\nstates were always bones of contention between Tsin and Ts’u, on\nthe one hand, and between Ts’i and Ts’u on the other. The\nremaining feudal states are scarcely worth special mention as\nactive participators in the story of how China fought her way from\nfeudalism to centralization; most of their rulers were viscounts\nor barons in status, and seem to have owed, or at least been\nobliged to pay, more duty to the nearest great feudatory than\ndirect to the Emperor.",
        "No matter what the rank of the ruler, so soon as he had been\nsupplied with a posthumous name (expressing, in guarded style, his\npersonal character) he was known to history as “the Duke So-and-\nSo.” Even one of the Rings of Ts’u, is courteously called “the\nDuke Chwang” after his death, because as a federal prince he had\ndone honour to the courtesy title of viscount. Princes or rulers\nnot enjoying any of the five ranks were, if orthodox sovereign\nprinces over never so small a tract, still called posthumously,\n\"the Duke X.”",
        "Hence Western writers, in describing Confucius’ master and the\nrulers of other feudal states, often speak of “the Duke of Lu,” or\n\"of Tsin\"; but this is only an accurate form of speech when taken\nsubject to the above reserves.",
        "The relations which existed between Emperor and feudal princes are\nbest seen and understood from specific cases involving mutual\nrelations. The Chou dynasty had about 1800 nominal vassals in all,\nof whom 400 were already waiting at the ford of the Yellow River\nfor the rendezvous appointed by the conquering “Warrior King\";\nthus the great majority must already have existed as such before\nthe Chou family took power; in other words, they were the vassals\nof the Shang dynasty, and perhaps, of the distant Hia dynasty too.\nThe new Emperor enfeoffed fifteen “brother” states, and forty more\nhaving the same clan-name as himself: these fifty-five were\npresumably all new states, enjoying mesne-lord or semi-suzerain\nprivileges over the host of insignificant principalities; and it\nmight as well be mentioned here that this imperial clan name of\nKi was that of all the ultra-ancient emperors, from 2700\nB.C. down to the beginning of the Hia dynasty in 2205 B.C. Fiefs\nwere conferred by the Chou conqueror upon all deserving ministers\nand advisers as well as upon kinsmen. The more distant princes\nthey enfeoffed possessed, in addition to their distant satrapies,\na village in the neighbourhood of the imperial court, where they\nresided, as at an hotel or town house, during court functions;\nmore especially in the spring, when, if the world was at peace,\nthey were supposed to pay their formal respects to the Emperor.\nThe tribute brought by the different feudal states was, perhaps\neuphemistically, associated with offerings due to the gods,\napparently on the same ground that the Emperor was vaguely\nassociated with God. The Protectors, when the Emperors degenerated,\nmade a great show always of chastising or threatening the other\nvassals on account of their neglect to honour the Emperor.\nThus in 656 the First Protector (Ts’i) made war upon Ts’u for not\nsending the usual tribute of sedge to the Emperor, for use in\nclarifying the sacrificial wine. Previously, in 663, after assisting the\nstate of Yen against the Tartars, Ts’i had requested Yen “to go\non paying tribute, as was done during the reigns of the two first\nChou Emperors, and to continue the wise government of the\nDuke of Shao.” In 581, when Wu’s pretensions were rising in a\nmenacing degree, the King of Wu said: “The Emperor complains to me\nthat not a single Ki (i.e. not a single closely-related\nstate) will come to his assistance or send him tribute, and thus\nhis Majesty has nothing to offer to the Emperor Above, or to the\nGhosts and Spirits.”",
        "Land thus received in vassalage from the Emperor could not, or\nought not to, be alienated without imperial sanction. Thus in 711\nB.C. two states (both of the Ki surname, and thus both such\nas ought to have known better) effected an exchange of territory;\none giving away his accommodation village, or hotel, at the\ncapital; and the other giving in exchange a place where the\nEmperor used to stop on his way to Ts’i when he visited Mount\nT’ai-shan, then, as now, the sacred resort of pilgrims in Shan\nTung. Even the Emperor could not give away a fief in joke. This,\nindeed, was how the second Chou Emperor conferred the (extinct or\nforfeited) fief of Tsin upon a relative. But just as",
        "Une reine d’Espagne ne regarde pas par la fenetre,",
        "so an Emperor of China cannot jest in vain. An attentive scribe\nstanding by said: “When the Son of Heaven speaks, the clerk takes\ndown his words in writing; they are sung to music, and the rites\nare fulfilled.” When, in 665 B.C., Ts’i had driven back the\nTartars on behalf of Yen, the Prince of Yen accompanied the Prince\nof Ts’i back into Ts’i territory. The Prince of Ts’i at once ceded\nto Yen the territory trodden by the Prince of Yen, on the ground\nthat “only the Emperor can, when accompanying a ruling prince,\nadvance beyond the limits of his own domain.” This rule probably\nrefers only to war, for feudal princes frequently visited each\nother. The rule was that “the Emperor can never go out,” i.e. he\ncan never leave or quit any part of China, for all China belongs\nto him. It is like our “the King can do no wrong.”",
        "The Emperor could thus neither leave nor enter his own particular\nterritory, as all his vassals’ territory is equally his. Hence his\n\"mere motion” or pleasure makes an Empress, who needs no formal\nreception into his separate appanage by him. If the Emperor gives\na daughter or a sister in marriage, he deputes a ruling prince of\nthe Ki surname to “manage” the affair; hence to this day the only\nname for an imperial princess is “a publicly managed one.” A\nfeudal prince must go and welcome his wife, but the Emperor simply\ndeputes one of his appanage dukes to do it for him. In the same\nway, these dukes are sent on mission to convey the Emperor’s\npleasure to vassals. Thus, in 651 B.C., a duke was sent by the\nEmperor to assist Ts’in and Ts’i in setting one of the four\nTartar-begotten brethren on the Tsin throne (see Chapter X.). In\n649 two dukes (one being the hereditary Duke of Shao, supposed to\nbe descended from the same ancestor as the Earl reigning in the\ndistant state of Yen) were sent to confer the formal patent and\nsceptre of investiture on Tsin. The rule was that imperial envoys\npassing through the vassal territory should be welcomed on the\nfrontier, fed, and housed; but in 716 the fact that Wei attacked\nan imperial envoy on his way to Lu proves how low the imperial\npower had already sunk.",
        "The greater powers undoubtedly had, nearly all of them, clusters\nof vassals and clients, and it is presumed that the total of 1800,\nbelonging, at least nominally, to the Emperor, covered all these\nindirect vassals. Possibly, before the dawn of truly historical\ntimes, they all went in person to the imperial court; but after\nthe debacle of 771 B.C., the Emperor seems to have been\nleft severely alone by all the vassals who dared do so. So early\nas 704 B.C. a reunion of princelets vassal to Ts’u is mentioned;\nand in the year 622 Ts’u annexed a region styled “the six states,\"\nadmittedly descended from the most ancient ministerial stock,\nbecause they had presumed to ally themselves with the eastern\nbarbarians; this was when Ts’u was working her way eastwards, down\nfrom the southernmost headwaters of the Hwai River, in the extreme\nsouth of Ho Nan. It was in 684 that Ts’u first began to annex the\npetty orthodox states in (modern) Hu Peh province, and very soon\nnearly all those lying between the River Han and the River Yang-\ntsz were swallowed up by the semi-barbarian power. Ts’u’s relation\nto China was very much like that of Macedon to Greece. Both of the\nlatter were more or less equally descended from the ancient and\nsomewhat nebulous Pelasgi; but Macedon, though imbued with a\nportion of Greek civilization, was more rude and warlike, with a\nstrong barbarian strain in addition. Ts’u was never in any way\n\"subject” to the Chou dynasty, except in so far as it may have\nsuited her to be so for some interested purpose of her own. In the\nyear 595 Ts’u even treated Sung and Cheng (two federal states of\nthe highest possible orthodox imperial rank) as her own vassals,\nby marching armies through without asking their permission. As an\nillustration of what was the correct course to follow may be taken\nthe case of Tsin in 632, when a Tsin army was marching on a\npunitory expedition against the imperial clan state of Ts’ao; the\nmost direct way ran through Wei, but this latter state declined to\nallow the Tsin army to pass; it was therefore obliged to cross the\nYellow River at a point south of Wei-hwei Fu (as marked on modern\nmaps), near the capital of Wei, past which the Yellow River then\nran.",
        "Lu, though itself a small state, had, in 697, and again in 615,\nquite a large number of vassals of its own; several are plainly\nstyled “subordinate countries,” with viscounts and even earls to\nrule them. Some of these sub-vassals to the feudal states seem\nfrom the first never to have had the right of direct communication\nwith the Emperor at all; in such cases they were called fu-yung,\nor “adjunct-functions,” like the client colonies attached to the\ncolonial municipia of the Romans. A fu-yung was only about\nfifteen English miles in extent (according to Mencius); and from\n850 B.C. to 771 BC. even the great future state of Ts’in had only\nbeen a fu-yung,–it is not said to what mesne lord. Sung is\ndistinctly stated to have had a number of these fu-yung.\nCH’EN is also credited with suzerainty over at least two sub-\nvassal states. In 661 Tsin annexed a number of orthodox petty\nstates, evidently with the view of ultimately seizing that part of\nthe Emperor’s appanage which lay north of the Yellow River (west\nHo Nan); it was afterwards obtained by “voluntary cession.” The\nword “viscount,” besides being applied complimentarily to\nbarbarian “kings” when they showed themselves in China, had\nanother special use. When an orthodox successor was in mourning,\nhe was not entitled forthwith to use the hereditary rank allotted\nto his state; thus, until the funeral obsequies of their\npredecessors were over, the new rulers of Ch’en and Ts’ai were\ncalled “the viscount,” or “son” (same word).",
        "The Emperor used to call himself “I, the one Man,” like the\nSpanish “Yo, el Rey.” Feudal princes styled themselves to each\nother, or to the ministers of each other, “The Scanty Man.\"\nMinisters, speaking (to foreign ministers or princes) of their own\nprince said, “The Scanty Prince\"; of the prince’s wife, “The\nScanty Lesser Prince\"; of their own ministers, “The Scanty\nMinister.” It was polite to avoid the second person in addressing\na foreign prince, who was consequently often styled “your\ngovernment” by foreign envoys particularly anxious not to offend.\nThe diplomatic forms were all obsequiously polite; but the stock\nphrases, such as, “our vile village” (our country), “your\ncondescending to instruct” (your words), “I dare not obey your\ncommands” (we will not do what you ask), probably involved nothing\nmore in the way of humility than the terms of our own gingerly\nworded diplomatic notes, each term of which may, nevertheless,\noffend if it be coarsely or carelessly expressed.",
        "In some cases a petty vassal was neither a sub-kingdom nor an\nadjunct-function to another greater vassal, but was simply a\npolitical hanger-on; like, for instance, Hawaii was to the United\nStates, or Cuba now is; or like Monaco is to France, Nepaul to\nIndia. Thus Lu, through assiduously cultivating the good graces of\nTs’i, became in 591 a sort of henchman to Ts’i; and, as we have\nseen, at the Peace Conference of 546, the henchmen of the two\nrival Protectors agreed to pay “cross respects” to each other’s\nProtector. It seems to have been the rule that the offerings of\nfeudal states to the Emperor should be voluntary, at least in\nform: for instance, in the year 697, the Emperor or his agents\nbegged a gift of chariots from Lu, and in 618 again applied for\nsome supplies of gold; both these cases are censured by the\nhistorians as being undignified. On the other hand, the Emperor’s\ncomplimentary presents to the vassals were highly valued. Thus in\nthe year 530, when Ts’u began to realize its own capacity for\nempire, a claim was put in for the Nine Tripods, and for a share\nof the same honorific gifts that were bestowed by the founders\nupon Ts’i, Tsin, Lu, and Wei at the beginning of the Chou dynasty.\nIn the year 606 Ts’u had already “inquired” at the imperial court\nabout these same Tripods, and 300 years later (281 B.C.), when\nstruggling with Ts’in for the mastery of China, Ts’u endeavoured\nto get the state of Han to support her demand for the Tripods,\nwhich eventually fell to Ts’in; it will be remembered that the\nDuke of Chou had taken them to the branch capital laid out by him,\nbut which was not really occupied by the Emperor until 771 B.C.",
        "In 632, after the great Tsin victory over Ts’u, the Emperor\n\"accepted some Ts’u prisoners,” conferred upon Tsin the\nProtectorate, ceded to Tsin that part of the imperial territory\nreferred to on page 53, and presented to the Tsin ruler a chariot,\na red bow with 1000 arrows, a black bow with 1000 arrows, a jar of\nscented wine, a jade cup with handle, and 300 “tiger” body-guards.\nIn 679, when Old Tsin had been amalgamated by New Tsin (both of\nthem then tiny principalities), the Emperor had already accepted\nvaluable loot from the capture of Old Tsin. In a word, the Emperor\nnearly always sided with the strongest, accepted faits accomplis,\nand took what he could get. This has also been China’s usual policy\nin later times.",
        "The period of political development covered by Confucius’ history–\nthe object of which history, it must be remembered, was to read\nto the restless age a series of solemn warnings–was immediately\nsucceeded by the most active and bloodthirsty period in the\nChinese annals, that of the Fighting States, or the Six Countries;\nsometimes they (including Ts’in) were called the “Seven Males,\"\ni.e. the Seven Great Masculine Powers. Tsin had been already\npractically divided up between the three surviving great families\nof the original eleven in 424 B.C.; but these three families of\nNgwei, Han, and Chao were not recognized by the Emperor until 403;\nnor did they extinguish the legitimate ruler until 376, about\nthree years after the sacrifices of the legitimate Ts’i kings were\nstopped. Accordingly we hear the original name Tsin, or “the three\nTsin,” still used concurrently with the names Han, Ngwei, and\nChao, as that of Ts’u’s chief enemy in the north for some time\nafter the division into three had taken place.",
        "Tsin’s great rival to the west, Ts’in, now found occupation in\nextending her territory to the south-west at the expense of Shuh,\na vast dominion corresponding to the modern Sz Ch’wan, up to then\nalmost unheard of by orthodox China, but which, it then first\ntranspired, had had three kings and ten “emperors” of its own,\nnine of these latter bearing the same appellation. Even now, the\nrapids and gorges of the Yang-tsz River form the only great\ncommercial avenue from China into Sz Ch’wan, and it is therefore\nnot hard to understand how in ancient times, the tribes of “cave\nbarbarians” (whose dwellings are still observable all over that\nhuge province) effectively blocked traffic along such subsidiary\nmountain-roads as may have existed then, as they exist now, for\nthe use of enterprising hawkers.",
        "The Chinese historians have no statistics, indulge in fen (few?)\nremarks about economic or popular development, describe no popular\nlife, and make no general reflections upon history; they confine\nthemselves to narrating the bald and usually unconnected facts\nwhich took place on fixed dates, occasionally describing some\nparticularly heroic or daring individual act, or even sketching\nthe personal appearance and striking conduct of an exceptionally\nremarkable king, general, or other leading personality: hence\nthere is little to guide us to an intelligent survey of causes and\neffects, of motives and consequences; it is only by carefully\npiecing together and collating a jumble of isolated events that it\nis possible to obtain any general coup d’oeil at all: the wood is\noften invisible on account of the trees.",
        "But there can be no doubt that populations had been rapidly\nincreasing; that improved means had been found to convey\naccumulated stores and equipments; that generals had learnt how to\nhurl bodies of troops rapidly from one point to the other; and\nthat rulers knew the way either to interest large populations in\nwar, or to force them to take an active part in it. The marches,\ndurbars, and gigantic canal works, undertaken by the barbarous\nKing of Wu, as described in Chapter XXI., prove this in the case\nof one country. Chinese states always became great in the same\nway: first Kwan-tsz developed, on behalf of his master the First\nProtector, the commerce, the army, and the agriculture of Ts’i. He\nwas imitated at the same time by Duke Muh of Ts’in and King Chwang\nof Ts’u, both of which rulers (seventh century B.C.) set to work\nvigorously in developing their resources. Then Tsz-ch’an raised\nCheng to a great pitch of diplomatic influence, if not also of\nmilitary power. His friend Shuh Hiang did the same thing for Tsin;\nand both of them were models for Confucius in Lu, who had,\nmoreover, to defend his own master’s interests against the policy\nof the philosopher Yen-tsz of Ts’i. After his first defeat by the\nKing of Wu, the barbarian King of Yueh devoted himself for some\nyears to the most strenuous life, with the ultimate object of\namassing resources for the annihilation of Wu; the interesting\nsteps he took to increase the population will be described at\nlength in a later Chapter. In 361, as we have explained in Chapter\nXXII., a scion of Wei went as adviser to Ts’in, and within a\ngeneration of his arrival the whole face of affairs was changed in\nthat western state hitherto so isolated; the new position, from a\nmilitary point of view, was almost exactly that of Prussia during\nthe period between the tyranny of the first Napoleon, together\nwith the humiliation experienced at his hands, and the patient\ngathering of force for the final explosion of 1870, involving the\ncrushing of the second (reigning) Napoleon.",
        "Very often the term “perpendicular and horizontal” period is\napplied to the fourth century B.C. That is, Ts’u’s object was to\nweld together a chain of north and south alliances, so as to bring\nthe power of Ts’i and Tsin to bear together with her own upon\nTs’in; and Ts’in’s great object was, on the other hand, to make a\nsimilar string of east and west alliances, so as to bring the same\ntwo powers to bear upon Ts’u. The object of both Ts’in and Ts’u\nwas to dictate terms to each unit of; and ultimately to possess,\nthe whole Empire, merely utilizing the other powers as catspaws to\nhook the chestnuts out of the furnace. No other state had any\nrival pretensions, for, by this time, Ts’in and Ts’u each really\ndid possess one-third part of China as we now understand it,\nwhilst the other third was divided between Ts’i and the three\nTsin. In 343 B.C. the Chou Emperor declared Ts’in Protector, and\nfrom 292 to 288 B.C., Tsin and Ts’i took for a few years the\nancient title of Ti or “Emperor” of the West and East respectively:\nin the year 240 the Chou Emperor even proceeded to Ts’in to do\nhomage there. Tsin might have been in the running for universal\nempire had she held together instead of dividing herself into\nthree. Yen was altogether too far away north,–though, curiously\nenough, Yen (Peking) has been the political centre of North\nChina for 900 years past,–and Ts’i was too far away east.\nMoreover, Ts’i was discredited for having cut off the sacrifices\nof the legitimate house. Ts’u was now master of not only her old\nvassals, Wu and Yiieh, but also of most of the totally unknown\nterritory down to the south sea, of which no one except the Ts’u\npeople at that time knew so much as the bare local names; it bore\nthe same relation to Ts’u that the Scandinavian tribes did to the\nRomanized Germans. Ts’in had become not only owner of Sz Ch’wan–\nat first as suzerain protector, not as direct administrator–but\nhad extended her power down to the south-west towards Yiin Nan and\nTibet, and also far away to the north-west in Tartarland, but not\nfarther than to where the Great Wall now extends. It is in the\nyear 318 B.C. that we first hear the name Hiung-nu (ancestors of\nthe Huns and Turks), a body of whom allied themselves in that year\nwith the five other Chinese powers then in arms against the\nmenacing attitude of Ts’in; something remarkable must have taken\nplace in Tartarland to account for this sudden change of name, The\nonly remains of old federal China consisted of about ten petty\nstates such as Sung, Lu, etc., all situated between the Rivers Sz\nand Hwai, and all waiting, hands folded, to be swallowed up at\nleisure by this or that universal conqueror.",
        "Ts’in s’en va t’en guerre seriously in the year 364, and\nbegan her slashing career by cutting off 60,000 “Tsin” heads; (the\nlegitimate Tsin sacrifices had been cut off in 376, so this “Tsin\"\nmust mean “Ngwei,” or that part of old Tsin which was coterminous\nwith Ts’in); in 331, in a battle with Ngwei, 80,000 more heads\nwere taken off. ’In 318 the Hiung-nu combination just mentioned\nlost 82,000 heads between them; in 314 Han lost 10,000; in 312\nTs’u lost 80,000; in 307 Han lost 60,000; and in 304 Ts’u lost\n80,000. In the year 293 the celebrated Ts’in general, Peh K’i, who\nhas left behind him a reputation as one of the greatest\nmanipulators of vast armies in Eastern history, cut off 240,000\nHan heads in one single battle; in 275, 40,000 Ngwei heads; and in\n264, 50,000 Han heads. “Enfin je vais me mesurer avec ce\nVilainton” said the King of Chao, when his two western friends\nof Han and Ngwei had been hammered out of existence. In the year\n260 the Chao forces came to terrible grief; General Peh K’i\nmanaged completely to surround their army of 400,000 men he\naccepted their surrender, guaranteed their safety, and then\nproceeded methodically to massacre the whole of them to a man. In\n257 “Tsin” (presumably Han or Ngwei) lost 6,000 killed and 20,000\ndrowned; in 256 Han lost 40,000 heads, and in 247 her last 30,000,\nwhilst also in 256 Chao her last 90,000. These terrible details\nhave been put together from the isolated statements; but there can\nbe no mistake about them, for the historian Sz-ma Ts’ien, writing\nin 100 B.C., says: “The allies with territory ten times the extent\nof the Ts’in dominions dashed a million men against her in vain;\nshe always had her reserves in hand ready, and from first to last\na million corpses bit the dust.”",
        "No such battles as these are even hinted at in more ancient times;\nnor, strange to say, are the ancient chariots now mentioned any\nmore. Ts’in had evidently been practising herself in fighting with\nthe Turks and Tartars for some generations, and had begun to\nperceive what was still only half understood in China, the\nadvantage of manoeuvring large bodies of horsemen; but, curiously\nenough, nothing is said of horses either; yet all these battles\nseem to have been fought on the flat lands of old federal China,\nsuitable for either chariots or horses. The first specific mention\nof cavalry manoeuvres on a large scale was in the year 198 B.C.\nwhen the new Han Emperor of China in person, with a straggling\narmy of 320,000 men, mostly infantry, was surrounded by four\nbodies of horsemen led by the Supreme Khan, in white, grey, black,\nand chestnut divisions, numbering 300,000 cavalry in all: his name\nwas Megh-dun (? the Turkish Baghatur).",
        "Whilst all this was going on, Mencius, the Confucian philosopher,\nand the two celebrated diplomatists (of Taoist principles), Su\nTs’in and Chang I, were flying to and fro all over orthodox China\nwith a view of offering sage political advice; this was the time\npar excellence when the rival Taoist and Confucian prophets\nwere howling in the wilderness of war and greed: but Ts’in cared\nnot much for talkers: generals did her practical business better:\nin 308 she began to cast covetous eyes on the Emperor’s poor\nremaining appanage. In 301 she was called upon to quell a revolt\nin Shuh; then she materially reduced the pretensions of her great\nrival Ts’u; and finally rested a while, whilst gathering more\nstrength for the supreme effort-the conquest of China.",
        "The history of China may be for our present purposes accordingly\nsummed up as follows. The pure Chinese race from time immemorial\nhad been confined to the flat lands of the Yellow River, and its\none tributary on the south, the River Loh, the Tartars possessing\nmost of the left bank from the Desert to the sea. However, from\nthe beginning of really historical times the Chinese had been in\nunmistakable part-possession of the valleys of the Yellow River’s\ntwo great tributaries towards the west and north, the Wei (in Shen\nSi) and the Fen (in Shan Si). Little, if any, Chinese colonizing\nwas done much before the Ts’in conquests in any other parts of\nTartarland; none in Sz Ch’wan that we know of; little, if any,\nalong the coasts, except perhaps from Ts’i and Lu (in Shan Tung),\nboth of which states seem to have always been open to the sea,\nthough many barbarian coast tribes still required gathering into\nthe Chinese fold. The advance of Chinese civilization had been\nfirst down the Yellow River; then down the River Han towards the\nMiddle Yang-tsz; and lastly, down the canals and the Hwai network\nof streams to the Shanghai coast. Old colonies of Chinese had,\nmany centuries before the conquest of China by the Chou dynasty,\nevidently set out to subdue or to conciliate the southern tribes:\nthese adventurous leaders had naturally taken Chinese ideas with\nthem, but had usually found it easier for their own safety\nand success to adopt barbarian customs in whole or in part. These\nmixed or semi-Chinese states of the navigable Yang-tsz Valley,\nfrom the Ich’ang gorges to the sea, had generally developed in\nisolation and obscurity, and only appeared in force as formidable\ncompetitors with orthodox Chinese when the imperial power began to\ncollapse after 771 B.C. The isolation of half-Roman Britain for\nseveral centuries after the first Roman conquest, and the\ndeparture of the last Roman legions, may be fitly compared with\nthe position of the half-Chinese states. Ts’u, Wu, and Yueeh all\nhad pedigrees, more or less genuine, vying in antiquity with the\npedigree of the imperial Chou family; and therefore they did not\nsee why they also should not aspire to the overlordship when it\nappeared to be going a-begging. Even orthodox Tsin and Ts’i in\nthe north and north-east were in a sense colonial extensions,\ninasmuch as they were governed by new families appointed thereto\nby the Chou dynasty in 1122 B.C., in place of the old races of\nrulers, presumably more or less barbarian, who had previously to\n1122 B.C. been vassal–in name at least–to the earlier imperial\nHia and Shang dynasties: but these two great states were never\nconsidered barbarian under Chou sway; and, indeed, some of the\nmost ancient mythological Chinese emperors anterior to the Hia\ndynasty had their capitals in Tsin and Lu, on the River Fen and\nthe River Sz.",
        "It is not easy to define the exact amount of “foreignness” in\nTs’u. One unmistakable non-Chinese expression is given; that is\nkou-u-du, or “suckled by a tigress.” Then, again, the syllable\nngao occurs phonetically in many titles and in native personal\nnames, such as jo-ngao, tu-ngao, kia-ngao, mo-ngao.\nThere are no Ts’u songs in the Odes as edited by Confucius,  and\nthe Ts’u music is historically spoken of as being “in the southern\nsound\"; which may refer, it is true, to the accent, but also possibly\nto a strange language. The Ts’u name for “Annals,” or history, was\nquite different from the terms used in Tsin and Lu, respectively;\nand the Ts’u word for a peculiar form of lameness, or locomotor\nataxy, is said to differ from the expressions used in either Wei and\nTs’i. So far aspossible, all Ts’u dignities were kept in the royal family,\nand the king’s uncle was usually premier. The premier of Ts’u was\ncalled Zing-yin, a term unknown to federal China; and Ts’u\nconsidered the left-hand side more honourable than the right,\nwhich at that time was not the case in China proper, though it is\nnow. The “Borough-English” rule of succession in Ts’u was to give\nit to one of the younger sons; this statement is repeated in\npositive terms by Shuh Hiang, the luminous statesman of Tsin, and\nwill be further illustrated when we come to treat of that subject\nspecially. The Lu rule was “son after father; or, if none, then\nyounger after eldest brother; if the legitimate heir dies, then\nnext son by the same mother; failing which, the eldest son by any\nmother; if equal claims, then the wisest; if equally wise, cast\nlots”: Lu rules would probably hold good for all federal China,\nbecause the Duke of Chou, founder of Lu, was the chief moral force\nin the original Chou administration. In the year 587 Lu, when\ncoquetting between Tsin and Ts’u, was at last persuaded not to\nabandon Tsin for Ts’u, “who is not of our family, and can never\nhave any real affection.” Once in Tsin it was asked, about a\nprisoner: “Who is that southernhatted fellow?” It was explained\nthat he was a Ts’u man. They then handed him a guitar, and made\nhim sing some “national songs.” In 597 a Ts’u envoy to the Tsin\nmilitary durbar said: “My prince is not formed for the fine and\ndelicate manners of the Chinese”: here is distinct evidence of\nsocial if not ethnological cleaving. The Ts’u men had beards,\nwhilst those of Wu were not hirsute: this statement proves that\nthe two barbarian populations differed between themselves. In 635\nthe King of Ts’u spoke of himself as “the unvirtuous” and the\n\"royal old man\"–designations both appropriate only to barbarians\nunder Chinese ritual. In 880 B.C., when the imperial power was\nalready waning, and the first really historical King of Ts’u was\nbeginning to bring under his authority the people between the Han\nand the Yang-tsz, he said: “I am a barbarian savage, and do not\nconcern myself with Chinese titles, living or posthumous.” In 706,\nwhen the reigning king made his first conquest of a petty Chinese\nprincipality (North Hu Peh), he said again: “I am a barbarian\nsavage; all the vassals are in rebellion and attacking each other;\nI want with my poor armaments to see for myself how Chou governs,\nand to get a higher title.” On being refused, he said: “Do you\nforget my ancestor’s services to the father of the Chou founder?\"\nLater on, as has already been mentioned, he put in a claim for the\nNine Tripods because of the services his ancestor, “living in rags\nin the Jungle, exposed to the weather,” had rendered to the\nfounder himself. In 637, when the future Second Protector and\nruler of Tsin visited Ts’u as a wanderer, the King of Ts’u\nreceived him with all the hospitalities “under the Chou rites,\"\nwhich fact shows at least an effort to adopt Chinese civilization.\nIn 634 Lu asked Ts’u’s aid against Ts’i, a proceeding condemned by\nthe historical critics on the ground that Ts’u was a “barbarian\nsavage” state. On the other hand, by the year 560 the dying King\nof Ts’u was eulogized as a man who had successfully subdued the\nbarbarian savages. But against this, again, in 544 the ruler of Lu\nexpressed his content at having got safely back from his visit to\nTs’u, i.e. his visit to such an uncouth and distant court. Thus\nTs’u’s emancipation from “savagery” was gradual and of uncertain\ndate. In 489 the King of Ts’u declined to sacrifice to the Yellow\nRiver, on the ground that his ancestors had never presumed to\nconcern themselves with anything beyond the Han and Yang-tsz\nvalleys. Even Confucius, (then on his wanderings in the petty\nstate of CH’EN) declared his admiration at this, and said: “The\nKing of Ts’u is a sage, and understands the Great Way (tao).\"\nOn the other hand, only fifty years before this, when in 538 Ts’u,\nwith Tsin’s approval, first tried her hand at durbar work, the king\nwas horrified to hear from a fussy chamberlain (evidently orthodox)\nthat there were six different ways of receiving visitors according to\ntheir rank; so that Ts’u’s ritual decorum could not have been of\nvery long standing. The following year (537) a Tsin princess is\ngiven in marriage to Ts’u– a decidedly orthodox feather in Ts’u’s\ncap. Confucius affects a particular style in his history when he speaks\nof barbarians; thus an orthodox prince “beats” a barbarian, but “battles\"\nwith an orthodox equal. However, in 525, Ts’u and Wu “battle” together,\nthe commentator explaining that Ts’u is now “promoted” to battle\nrank, though the strict rule is that two barbarians, or China and\none barbarian, “beat” rather than “battle.” In 591 Confucius had\nalready announced the “end” of the King of Ts’u, not as such, but\nas federal viscount. Under ordinary circumstances “death” would\nhave been good enough: it is only in speaking of his own ruler’s\ndeath that the honorific word “collapse” is used. All these fine\ndistinctions, and many others like them, hold good for modern\nChinese. These (apparently to us) childish gradations in mere\nwording run throughout Confucius’ book; but we must remember that\nhis necessarily timid object was to “talk at” the wicked, and to\n\"hint” at retribution. Even a German recorder of events would\nshrink from applying the word haben to the royal act of a\nHottentot King, for whom hat is more than good enough, without\nthe allergnaedigst. And we all remember Bismarck’s story of the\nway mouth-washes and finger-bowls were treated at Frankfurt by those\nabove and below the grade of serene highness. Toutes les vices et\ntoutes les moeurs sont respectables.",
        "In 531 the barbarian King of Ts’u is honoured by being “named” for\nenticing and murdering a “ruler of the central kingdoms.” The\npedants are much exercised over this, but as the federal prince in\nquestion was a parricide, he had a lupinum caput, and so\neven a savage could without outraging orthodox feelings wreak the\nlaw on him. On the other hand, in 526, when Ts’u enticed and\nkilled a mere barbarian prince, the honour of “naming” was\nwithheld. This delicate question will be further elucidated in the\nChapter on “Names.”",
        "It will be observed that none of the testimony brought forward\nhere to show that Ts’u was, in some undefined way, a non-Chinese\nstate is either clear or conclusive: its cumulative effect,\nhowever, certainly leaves a very distinct impression that ’there\nwas a profound difference of some sort both in race and in\nmanners, though we are as yet quite unable to say whether the bulk\nof the Ts’u population was Annamese, Shan, or Siamese; Lolo or\nNosu; Miao-tsz, Tibetan, or what. There is really no use in\nattempting to advance one step beyond the point to which we are\ncarried by specific evidence, either in this or in other matters.\nIt has been said that no great discovery was ever made without\nimagination, which may be true; but evidence and imagination must\nbe kept rigidly separate. What we may reasonably hope is that, by\ngradually ascertaining and sifting definite facts and data\ntouching ancient Chinese history, we shall at least avoid coming\nto wrong positive conclusions, even if the right negative ones are\npretty clearly indicated. It is better to leave unexplained\nmatters in suspense than to base conclusions upon speculative\nsubstructures which will not carry the weight set upon them.",
        "The country of Wu is in many respects even more interesting\nethnologically than that of Ts’u. When, a generation or two before\nthe then vassal Chou family conquered China, two of the sons of\nthe ruler of that vassal principality decided to forego their\nrights of succession, they settled amongst the Jungle savages, cut\ntheir hair, adopted the local raiment, and tattooed their bodies;\nor, rather, it is said the elder of the two covered his head and\nhis body decently, while the younger cut his hair, went naked, and\ntattooed his body. The words “Jungle savages” apply to the country\nlater called Ts’u; but as Wu, when we first hear of her, was a\nsubordinate country belonging to Ts’u; and as in any case the word\n\"Wu” was unknown to orthodox China, not to say to extreme western\nChina, in 1200 B.C. when the adventurous brothers migrated; this\nparticular point need not trouble us so much as it seems to have\npuzzled the Chinese critics. About 575 the first really historical\nKing of Wu paid visits to the Emperor’s court, to the court of his\nsuzerain the King of Ts’u, and to the court of Lu: probably the\nHwai system of rivers would carry him within measurable distance\nof all three, for the headwaters almost touch the tributaries of\nthe Han, and the then Ts’u capital (modern King-thou Fu) was in\ntouch with the River Han. He observed when in Lu: “We only know\nhow to knot our hair in Wu; what could we do with such fine\nclothes as you wear?” It was the policy of Tsin and of the other\nminor federal princes to make use of Wu as a diversion against the\nadvance of Ts’u: it is evident that by this time Ts’u had begun to\ncount seriously as a Chinese federal state, for one of the\npowerful private families behind the throne and against the throne\nin Lu expressed horror that “southern savages (i.e. Wu) should\ninvade China (i.e. Ts’u),” by taking from it part of modern An\nHwei province: as, however, barbarian Ts’u had taken it first from\northodox China, perhaps the mesne element of Ts’u was not in the\nstatesman’s mind at all, but only the original element,–China. An\nimportant remark is made by one of the old historians to the\neffect that the language and manners of Wu were the same as those\nof Yiieh. In 483, when Wu’s pretensions as Protector were at their\ngreatest, the people of Ts’i made use of ropes eight feet long in\norder to bind certain Wu prisoners they had taken, “because their\nheads were cropped so close”: this statement hardly agrees with\nthat concerning “knotted hair,” unless the toupet or chignon\nwas very short indeed. ’There are not many native Wu words quoted,\nbeyond the bare name of the country itself, which is something like\nKeu-gu, or Kou-gu: an executioner’s knife is mentioned under\nthe foreign name chuh-lu, presented to persons expected to commit\nsuicide, after the Japanese harakiri fashion. In 584 B.C., when the first\nsteps were taken by orthodox China to utilize Wu politically, it was\nfound necessary, as we have seen, to teach the Wu folk the use\nof war-chariots and bows and arrows: this important statement\npoints distinctly to the previous utter isolation of Wu from the\npale of Chinese civilization. In the year 502 Ts’i sent a princess\nas hostage to Wu, and ended by giving her in marriage to the Wu\nheir: (we have seen how Tsin anticipated Ts’i by twenty-five years\nin conferring a similar honour upon Ts’u). A century or more\nlater, when Mencius was advising the bellicose court of Ts’i, he\nalluded with indignation to this “barbarous” act. In 544 the Wu\nprince Ki-chah had visited Lu and other orthodox states.",
        "[Illustration: Map of the Hwai system and Valley",
        "1. The two lines indicated by...............to the north are (1)\nthe River Sz (now Grand Canal), from Confucius’ birthplace, and\n(2) the River I (from modern I-shui city south of the German\ncolony). After receiving the I, the Sz entered the Hwai as it\nemerged from Lake Hung-t&h; but this Hwai mouth no longer exists;\nthe waters are dissipated in canals.",

The modern canal from Hangchow to Shan Tung is\nclearly indicated. Orthodox China knew absolutely nothing of Cheh\nKiang, Fuh Kien, or Kiang Si provinces south of lat. 300.]",
        "In recognition of this civilized move on the part of an ancient\nfamily, Confucius in his history grants the rank of “viscount” to\nthe King of Wu, but he does not style Ki-chah by the complimentary\ntitle Ki Kung-tsz, or “Ki, the son of a reigning prince\";\nthat is, the king’s title thus accorded retrospectively is only a\n\"courtesy one,” and does not carry with it a posthumous name, and\nwith that name the posthumous title of Kung, or “duke\"’\napplied to all civilized rulers. Yet it is evident that the ruling\ncaste of Wu considered itself superior to the surrounding tribes,\nfor in the year 493 it was remarked: “We here in Wu are entirely\nsurrounded by savages\"; and in 481 the Emperor himself sent a\nmessage through Tsin to Wu, saying: “I know that you are busy with\nthe savages you have on hand at present.” In the year 482, when\nthe orthodox princes of Sung, Wei, and Lu were holding off from an\nalliance with Wu, the prince of Wei was detained by a Wu general,\nbut escaped, and set to work to learn the language of Wu. The\nmotive is of no importance; but the clear statement about a\ndifferent language, or at least a dialect so different that it\nrequired special study, is interesting. When Ki-chah was on his\ntravels, he explained to his friends that the law of succession\nis: “By the rites to the eldest, as established by our ancestors\nand by the customs of the country.” In 502 the King of Wu was\nembarrassed about his successor, whose character did not commend\nitself to him, His counsellor (a refugee from Ts’u) said: “Order\nin the state ceases if the succession be interrupted; by ancient\nlaw son should succeed father deceased.” Thus it seems that the\nancient Chou rules had been conveyed to Wu by the first colonists\nin 1200 B.C., and that the succession laws differed from those of\nTs’u. Ki-chah’s son died whilst he was on his travels, and\nConfucius is reported to have said: “He is a man who understands\nthe rites; let us see what he does.” Ki-chah bared his left arm\nand shoulder, marched thrice round the grave, and said: “Flesh and\nbone back to the earth, as is proper; as to the soul, let it go\nanywhere it chooses!” This language was approved by Confucius, who\nhimself always declined to dogmatize on death and spirits,\nmaintaining that men knew too little of themselves, when living,\nto be justified in groping for facts about the dead. At first\nsight it would appear strange that a barbarous country like Wu\nshould suddenly produce a learned prince who at once captivated by\nhis culture Yen-tsz of Ts’i, Confucius of Lu, Tsz-ch’an of Cheng,\nK’u-peh-yu of Wei, Shuh Hiang of Tsin, and, in short, all the\ndistinguished statesmen of China; but if we reflect that, within\nhalf a century, the greatest naval, military, and scientific\ngeniuses have been produced on Western lines in Japan (as we shall\nsoon see, in some way connected with Wu), at least we find good\nmodern parallels for the phenomenon.",
        "When Wu, after a series of bloody wars with Ts’u and Yiieh, was in\n473 finally extinguished by the latter power, a portion of the\nKing of Wu’s family escaped in boats in an easterly direction. At\nthis time not only was Japan unknown to China under that name, but\nalso quite unheard of under any name whatever. It was not until\n150 years later that the powerful states of Yen and Ts’i, which,\nroughly speaking, divided with them the eastern part of the modern\nprovince of Chih Li, the northern part of Shan Tung, and the whole\ncoasts of the Gulf of “Pechelee,” began to talk vaguely of some\nmysterious and beautiful islands lying in the sea to the east.\nWhen the First August Emperor had conquered China, he made several\ntours to the Shan Tung promontory, to the site of the former Yueh\ncapital (modern Kiao Chou), to the treaty-port of Chefoo (where he\nleft an inscription), to the Shan-hai Kwan Pass, and to the\nneighbourhood of Ningpo. He also had heard rumours of these\nmysterious islands, and he therefore sent a physician of his staff\nwith a number of young people to make inquiry, and colonize the\nplace if possible. They brought back absurd stories of some\nmonstrous fish that had interfered with their landing, and they\nreported that these fish could only be frightened away by\ntattooing the body as the natives did, The people of Wu, who were\ngreat fisherfolk and mariners, were also stated to have indulged\nin universal tattooing because they wished to frighten dangerous\nfish away. The first mission from Japan, then a congeries of petty\nstates, totally unacquainted with writing or records, came to\nChina in the first century of our era; it was not sent by the\ncentral King, but only by one of the island princes. Later\nembassies from and to Japan disclose the fact that the Japanese\nthemselves had traditions of their descent both from ancient\nChinese Emperors and from the founder of Wu, i.e. from the Chou\nprince who went there in 1200 B.C.; of the medical mission sent by\nthe First August Emperor; of the flight from Wu in 473 B.C. of\npart of the royal Wu family to Japan; and of other similar\nmatters–all apparently tending to show that the refugees from Wu\nreally did reach Japan; that a very early shipping intercourse had\nprobably existed between Japan, Ts’i, and Wu; and that, in\naddition to the statements made by later Chinese historians to the\neffect that the Japanese considered themselves in some way\nhereditarily connected with Wu, the early Japanese traditions and\nhistories (genuine or concocted) themselves separately repeated\nthe story. One of the later Chinese histories says of Wu: “Part of\nthe king’s family escaped and founded the kingdom of Wo” (the\nancient name for the Japanese race): the temptation to connect\nthis word with Wu is obvious; but etymology will not tolerate\nsuch an identification, either from a Chinese or a Japanese point of\nview; the etymological “values” are Ua and Gu respectively.",
        "As in the case of Ts’u, there is no really trustworthy evidence to\nshow of what race or races, and in what proportions, the bulk of\nthe Wu population consisted; still less is there any specific\nevidence to show to what race the barbarian king who committed\nsuicide in 473 belonged; or if those of his family who escaped\nwere wholly or partly Chinese; or if any pure descent existed at\nall in royal circles, dating, that is to say, from the ancient\ncolonists of the imperial Chou family in 1200 B.C.",
        "So far as purely Chinese traditions and history go, the cumulative\nevidence, such as it is, needs careful sifting, and is, perhaps,\nworth a more thorough examination; but as to the Japanese\ntraditions and early “history,” these, as the Japanese themselves\nadmit, were only put together in written form retrospectively in\nthe eighth century A.D., and throughout they show signs of having\nbeen deliberately concocted on the Chinese lines; that is, Chinese\nhistorical incidents and phraseology are worked into the narrative\nof supposed Japanese events, and Japanese emperors or empresses\nare (admittedly) fitted with posthumous names mostly copied from\nimperial Chinese posthumous names. By themselves they are almost\nvalueless, so far as the fixing of specific dates and the\nidentification of political events are concerned; and even when\ntaken as ancillary to contemporary Chinese evidence, except in so\nfar as a few Chinese misprints or errors may be more clearly\nindicated by comparison with them, they seem equally valueless\neither to confirm, to check, to modify, or to contradict the\nChinese accounts, which, indeed, are absolutely the sole\ntrustworthy written evidence either we or the Japanese themselves\npossess about the actual condition of the Japanese 2000 years ago.",
        "Meanwhile, as to Wu, all we can say with certainty is, that there\nis a persistent rumour or tradition that some of its royal\nrefugees (themselves of unknown race) who escaped in boats\neastward, may have escaped to Japan; may have succeeded in\n\"imposing themselves” on the people, or a portion of the people\n(themselves a mixed race of uncertain provenance); and may\nhave quietly and informally introduced Chinese words, ideas, and\nmethods, several centuries before known and formal intercourse\nbetween Japan and China took place.",
        "In laying stress upon the barbarous, or semi-barbarous, quality of\nthe states (all in our days considered pure Chinese), which\nsurrounded the federal area at even so late a period as 771 B.C.,\nwe wish to emphasize a point which has never yet been made quite\nclear, perhaps not even made patent by their own critics to the\nChinese themselves; that is to say, the very small and modest\nbeginnings of the civilized patriarchal federation called the\nCentral Kingdom, or Chu Hia–\"All the Hia\"–just as we say,\n\"All the Russias.”",
        "In allotting precedence to the various states, the historical\neditors, of course, always put the Emperor first in order of\nmention; then comes CHENG, the first ruler of which state was son\nof an Emperor of the then ruling imperial house; next, the three\nProtectors Ts’i, Tsin, and Sung; then follow the petty states of\nWei, Ts’ai, Ts’ao, and T’eng, all of the imperial family name, or,\nas we say in English, “surname,” and all lying between the Hwai\nand the Sz systems (T’eng was a “belonging state” of Lu). Then\ncome half a dozen petty orthodox states of less honourable family\nnames; next, three Eastern barbarian states, which had become\n\"Central Kingdom,” or which, once genuine Chinese, had become half\nbarbarian; and finally, Ts’u, Ts’in, Wu, and Yiieh, which were\nfrankly, if vaguely, “outer barbarian-Tartar.”",
        "It has already been demonstrated that there is evidence, however\nimperfect, to show that the mass of the population of Ts’u and Wu\nwere of decidedly foreign origin. Even as to Ts’i, which was\nalways treated as an orthodox principality, it is stated that the\nfounder sent there in or about 1100 B.C. “conformed to the manners\nof the place, and encouraged manufactures, commerce, salt and fish\nindustries.” On the other hand, the son of the Duke of Chou (the\nfirst vassal prince appointed by his brother the Emperor) changed\nthe customs of Lu, modified the local rites, and induced the\npeople to keep on their mourning attire for three full years. It\nwas considered that the Ts’i policy was the wiser of the two, and\nit was foretold that Lu would always “look up to” Ts’i in\nconsequence of this superior judgment on the part of Ts’i. On\nfrequent occasions the petty adjoining “Chinesified” states, of\nwhich Lu was practically the mesne lord, are stated to have been\n\"tainted with Eastern barbarian rites.” From and including modern\nSue-chou (North Kiang Su) and eastward, all were “Eastern\nbarbarians\"; in fact, the city just named (mentioned by the name\nof Sue in 1100 B.C., and again about 950 B.C., as revolting\nagainst the Emperor) perpetuates the “Sue barbarians” country,\nwhich was for long a bone of contention between Ts’i and Ts’u, and\nafterwards Wu; and the name “Hwai savages” proves that the Lower\nHwai Valley was also independent. The Hwai savages, who appear in\nthe Tribute of Yue, founder of the Hia dynasty, 2205 B.C., revolted\n1000 years later against the founders of the Chou dynasty. They\nwere present at Ts’u’s first durbar in 538 B.C., and are mentioned\nas barbarians still resisting Chinese methods so late as A.D. 970.\nIn Confucius’ time the Lai barbarians (modern Lai-thou Fu in the\nGerman sphere) were employed by Ts’i, who had conquered them in\n567 B.C., to try and effect the assassination of Confucius’\nmaster. Six hundred years before that, these same barbarians were\namong the first to give in their submission to the founder of\nTs’i; and in 602 B.C. both Ts’i and Lu had endeavoured to crush\nthem.",
        "As to the state of Ts’in, there is not a single instance given of\nany literary conversation or correspondence held by an orthodox\nhigh functionary with a Ts’in statesman. While it is not yet quite\nclear that orthodox China can shake herself entirely free of the\nreproach of human sacrifices in all senses, it is quite certain\nthat Ts’in had a barbarous and exclusive notoriety in this\nregard’; and, as the Hiung-nu Tartars also practised it, and Ts’in\nwas at least half Tartar in blood, it is probable that she derived\nher sanguinary notions from this blood connection with the Turko-\nScythian tribes. On the death of the Ts’in ruler in 678 B.C., the\nfirst recorded human sacrifices were made, “sixty-six individuals\nfollowing the dead.” In 621, on the death of the celebrated Duke\nMuh, 177 persons lost their lives, and the people of Ts’in, in\npity, “composed the Yellow Bird Ode” (of these popular Chinese\nodes more anon). This holocaust was given as one reason why Ts’in\ncould never “rule in the East,” i.e. assume the Protectorate over\nthe orthodox powers all lying to its east, on account of this cruel defect\nin its laws. In 387 B.C., the new Earl of Ts’in (who succeeded a nephew,\nand therefore could, having no paternal duty to fulfil, introduce the\ninnovation more cheaply) abolished the principle of human sacrifices\nat the death of a ruler. Ten years later, the Emperor’s astrologer paid\na visit to Ts’in;–evidence that the imperial civilizing influence was\nstill, at least morally, active, This astrologer and historiographer,\nwhose name was Tan, is interesting, inasmuch as he has been\nconfused with Li Tan (the personal name of the philosopher Lao-\ntsz, who was also an imperial official employed in the historiographical\ndepartment). It is added that, previous to this visit, for five hundred\nyears Ts’in and Chou had kept apart from each other. Notwithstanding\nthis prohibition of human sacrifices, when the First August Emperor of\nUniversal China died in 210 B.C., the old Ts’in custom was reintroduced,\nand all his women who had not given birth to children were buried with\nhim. Besides this, all the workmen who had made the secret door and\npassage to his grave were cemented in alive, so that they might never\ndisclose the secret of its approaches.",
        "It was only after gradually adopting Chinese civilization that\nTs’in began to be a considerable power; thus, when Ki-chah of Wu\nwas entertained at Lu with specimens of the various styles of\nmusic, he observed, on being regaled with Ts’in music: “Ah!\ncivilized sounds; it has succeeded in refining itself; it is in\noccupation of the old Chou appanage.” So late as 361 B.C., when\nNgwei (one of the three royal subdivisions of old Tsin) built a\nwall to keep off Ts’in, both Ngwei and Ts’u (which by this time\nwas quite as good orthodox Chinese as any other state) treated\nTs’in as though the latter were still barbarian, In 326 Ts’in\nfirst introduced into her realm the well-known year-end sacrifices\nof the orthodox Chinese, which fact alone points to a long\nisolation of Ts’in before this date.",
        "The rule of succession in Ts’in seems to have been of the Tartar\nkind at one time. Duke Muh, in 660 B.C., succeeded his brother,\nthough that brother had seven sons of his own living: that brother\nagain, had also succeeded a brother.",
        "As to Yueeh, there is no question as to its barbarism, though the\none single king around whose name centres the whole glory of Yiieh\n(Kou-tsien, 496-475) seems to have been a man of great ability and\nsome fine feeling. The native name for Yiieh was Yue-yueeh,\nas stated in Chapter VII.; and it seems likely that all the coast\nof China down to Tonquin, or Northern Annam, was then inhabited by\ncognate tribes, all having the syllable Yueeh, or Viet, in\ntheir names. The great empire or kingdom of Yiieh, founded upon\nthe ruins of Wu, soon split up into the “Hundred Yiieh,” i.e. (probably)\nit relapsed into its native barbarism, and ceased to cohere as a\npolitical factor. “Southern Yueeh” (the Canton region) has undoubted\nhistorical connections with the Tonquin part of Annam, and several\nother of the subdivisions of Yiieh, corresponding to Foochow, Wenchow,\netc., show distinct traces of having belonged to the same race. But it is\nunsafe to say how the Chinese-transcribed name Yii-yiieh was\npronounced; still more unsafe is it to argue that it must have been U\nor O-viet simply because the Annamese so pronounce the word\nnow. We have seen that, according to one historical statement, the\nWu and Yiieh people spoke the same language; in which case the\nmembers of the ruling Wu caste who fled to Japan in 473 B.C. were\nprobably not of the same race as the “savages around them.” As an\nact of bravado, in 481, the King of Wu made five condemned\ncenturions cut their own throats before the Tsin envoy, in order\nto show what effectively stern discipline he kept, In 484 the King\nof Yiieh had already committed a similar act of bravado; but\nneither of these barbarian states is distinctly recorded to have\nindulged in human sacrifices at the death of a sovereign. Previous\nto the crushing of Wu by Yiieh, in 473 B.C., Yiieh was nearly\nannihilated by Wu, and on this occasion Kou-tsien’s envoy\nadvanced crawling on his knees to beg for mercy; this is hardly an\northodox Chinese custom. However barbarous Yiieh may have been,\nits ruling house possessed traditions of descent, through a\nconcubine, from an emperor of the Hia dynasty; for which reason\nthe founder was enfeoffed, near modern Shao-hing, west of Ningpo,\nin order to fulfil the sacrifices to the founder of the Hia\ndynasty, who was, and is, supposed to be buried there: like the\nfirst colonists who migrated to Wu, he cut his hair, tattooed\nhimself, opened up the jungle, and built a town. In 330 B.C. Kou-\ntsien’s descendant spoke of “taking the road left to Chu-\nhia,” through modern Ho Nan province; that means taking the\nhigh-road to China proper. The term originated in times when Ts’u\nhad not yet become a recognized “Hia.” The fact that Yueeh, with\nits new capital then in Shan Tung, could never govern the Yang-tsz\nand Hwai inland regions, seems to prove that her power was always\npurely a water power, and that she was comparatively ignorant of\nland campaigns.",
        "It is instructive to inquire what were the literary relations\nbetween the distinguished statesmen and active princes who moved\nabout quite freely within the limited area so frequently alluded\nto in foregoing pages as being sacrosanct to civilization and the\nrites. There seems good reason to suppose that the literary\nactivity which so disgusted the destroyer of the books in 213 B.C.\ndid not really begin until after Confucius’ death in 479;\nmoreover, that the avalanche of philosophical works which drenched\nthe royal courts of the Six Kingdoms was in part the consequence\nof Confucius’ own efforts in the literary line. In the pre-\nConfucian days there is little evidence of the existence of any\nliterature at all beyond the Odes, the Changes, the Book, and the\nRites, which, after a lapse of 2500 years or more, are still the\n\"Bible” of China. The Odes, of which 3000 were popularly known\nprevious to Confucius’ recension, seem to have been originally\ncomposed here and there, and passed from mouth to mouth, by the\npeople of each orthodox state under impulse of strong passion,\nfeeling, or suffering; or some of them may even have been\ncommitted to writing by learned folk in touch with the people.\nNaturally, those songs which specially treated of local matters\nwould be locally popular; but it would seem that a large number of\nthem must have been generally known by heart by the whole educated\nbody all over orthodox China, It will be remembered that in the\nyear 1900, an enterprising American newspaper correspondent took\nadvantage of President Kruger’s penchant for quoting Scripture,\nand telegraphed to him daily texts, selected as applicable to the\nevent, for which the replies to be sent were always prepaid. For\ninstance, on news of a British victory, the American would\ntelegraph: “Victory stayeth not always with the righteous\"; on\nwhich President Kruger would promptly rejoin: “Yet shall I smite\nhim, even unto the end.” This was the plan followed by Chinese\nenvoys, statesmen, and princes in their intercourse with each\nother: no matter what event transpired, Ki-chah, or Tsz-ch’an, or\nShuh Hiang would illustrate it with an ode, or with a reference to\nthe “Book” (of history), or by an appeal to the Rites of Chou, or\nto some obscure astrological or cosmogonical development extracted\nfrom the mystic diagrams of “The Changes.” As often as not, the\nquotations given from the Odes and Book no longer exist in the\neditions of those two classics which have come down to us. This\nfact is interesting as proving that the Tso Chwan–or Commentary of\nConfucius’ pupil Tso K’iu-ming on Confucius’ own bare notes of history–\nmust have been written before Confucius’ expurgated Book of Odes\nreduced and fixed the number of selected songs; or, at all events,\nthe records from which Tso K’iu-ming took his quotations must have\nexisted before either he or Confucius composed their respective annals\nand comments. In the times when a book the size of a three-volume\nnovel of to-day would mean a mule-load of bamboo splinters or wooden\ntablets, it is absurd to suppose that generals in the field, or envoys on\nthe march, could carry their Odes bodily about with them: it is even\nprobable that the four “scriptural” books in question were\nexclusively committed to memory by the general public, and that\nnot more than half a dozen varnish-written copies existed in any\nstate; possibly not more than one copy. In fact, the only\navailable literary exhilaration then open to cultured friends was\nto check the memory on visiting strange lands by comparing the\ntexts of Odes, Changes, or Book. A knowledge of the Rites would\nperhaps be confined to the ruling classes almost entirely, for\nwith them it lay to pronounce the religious, the ritual, the\nsocial, or the administrative sanction applicable to each\ncontested set of circumstances. It is very much as though,–as was\nindeed the case in Johnsonian times,–the French, English, and\nGerman wits of the day, and occasionally distinguished literary\nspecimens of even more “barbarous” countries, should at a literary\nconference indulge in quotations from Horace or Juvenal by way of\npassing the time: they would not select the Twelve Tables or the\nLaws of the Pr’tors as matter for the testing of learning.",
        "To take a few instances. In 559 the ruler of Wei had severely\nbeaten his court music-master for failing to teach a concubine how\nto play the lute. One day the prince invited to dinner some\nstatesmen, the father of one of whom had taken offence at the\nprince’s rudeness; and he ordered the same musician to strike up\nthe last stanza of a certain ode hinting at treason, which the\nmalicious performer did in such a way as to give further offence\nto the father through his son, and to bring about the dethronement\nof the indiscreet prince. It gives us confidence in the truth of\nthese anecdotes when we find that K’ue-peh-yueh was consulted by the\noffended father as to what course he ought to pursue. This Wei\nstatesman, who has already been twice mentioned in connection with\nother matters, met Ki-chah of Wu when the latter visited that\nstate in 544, and he was also an admired senior acquaintance of\nConfucius himself, whom he twice lodged at his house for many\nmonths. Three Chapters of the “Book” still remain, after\nConfucius’ manipulations of it, to prove how Wei was first\nenfeoffed by the Duke of Chou, and one of the Odes actually sings\nthe praises of a Ts’i princess who married the prince of Wei in\n753 B.C. Thus we see that the ancient classics are intertwined and\nmutually corroborative.",
        "When the Second Protector (the last of the four Tartar-born\nbrothers to succeed to the Tsin throne) was on his wanderings in\n644 B.C., the Marquess of Ts’i gave him a daughter, of whom he\nbecame so enamoured that he seemed to be neglecting his political\nchances amid the pleasures of a foreign country, instead of\nendeavouring to regain his rightful throne at home. This princess\nfirst of all quoted an ode from the group treating of CHENG\naffairs, and secondly cited an apt saying from what she “had\nheard” the great Ts’i philosopher Kwan-tsz had said, her object\nbeing to promote her lively husband’s political interests. This\nall took place a few years after Kwan-tsz’s death, and 200 years\nafter the founding of CHENG state, and is therefore indirect\nconfirmation of the fact that Kwan-tsz was already a well-known\nauthority, and that contemporary affairs were usually “sung of” in\nall the orthodox states.",
        "When the Duke of Sung, after the death in 628 B.C. of the\npicturesque personality just referred to, was ambitious to become\nthe Third Protector of orthodox China and of the Emperor;\nConfucius’ ancestor, then a Sung statesman, approved of this\nambition, and proceeded to compose some complimentary sacrificial\nodes on the Shang dynasty (from which the Sung ducal family was\ndescended): some learned critics make out that it was the music-\nmaster of the Emperor who really composed these odes for the\nancestor of Confucius. In any case, there the odes are still, in\nthe Book of Odes as revised by Confucius himself about 150 years\nlater; and here accordingly–we have specific indirect evidence of\nConfucius’ own origin; of the “spiritual” power still possessed by\nthe Emperor’s court; and of the “Poet Laureate\"-like political\nuses to which odes were put in the international life of the\ntimes. This foolish Duke of Sung, who was so anxious to pose as\nProtector, was the one already mentioned in Chapters X. and XIV.,\nwho would not attack an enemy whilst crossing a stream.",
        "Again, in the year 651, when one of the least popular of the four\nTartar-born brethren was, with the assistance of the Ts’in ruler\n(who had been over-persuaded against his own better judgment),\nreigning in Tsin, the children of this latter state sang a ballad\nin the streets, prophesying the ultimate success of the self-\nsacrificing elder brother, then still away on his wanderings in\nTartarland. This song was apparently never included among the 3000\nodes generally known in China; but it illustrates how such popular\nsongs and popular heroes were created and perpetuated.–It is,\nperhaps, time now that we should give the personal name of this\npopular prince, of whom we have spoken so often, and who is as\nwell known to Chinese tradition as the severe Brutus ’is, or as\nthe ravishing Tarquin was, to old Roman history. His name was\nCh’ung-erh, or “the double-eared,” in allusion to some peculiarity\nin the lobes of his ears; besides which, two of his ribs were\nbelieved to be joined in one piece: his great success is perhaps\nlargely owing to his robust and manly appearance, which certainly\nsecured for him the eager attentions of the ladies, whether Turks\nor Chinese. His Turkish wife had been as disinterestedly\nsolicitous for his success, before he went to Ts’i, as his Ts’i\nwife was when she induced him to leave that country. On arrival in\nTs’in, he was presented with five princesses, including one who\nhad already been given to his nephew and immediate predecessor in\nTsin. The “rites” were of course decidedly wrong here, but his\nally Ts’in was at this time hesitating between Chinese and Tartar\nculture, and in any case he was probably persuaded in his mind to\nlet the rites go by the board for urgent political purposes. On\nthis occasion his brother-in-law and faithful henchman during\nnineteen years of wanderings, sang “the song of the fertilized\nmillet” (still existing), meaning that Ch’ung-erh was the gay\nyoung stalk fertilized by the presents and assistance of the ruler\nof Ts’in: he was, by the way, not so young, then well over sixty.\nHe had married the younger of two Tartar sisters, and had given\nher elder sister as wife to the henchman in question. (One account\nreverses the order.)",
        " [Illustration: Original inscription on the Sacrificial Tripod,\ntogether with (1) transcription in modern Chinese character (to\nthe right), and (2) an account of its history (to the left). Taken\nfrom Dr. Bushell’s “Chinese Art.\"]",
        "Ts’u seems to have possessed a knowledge of ancient history and of\nliterature at a very early date. In 597 B.C., after his victory\nover Tsin, the King of Ts’u had, as previously narrated, declined\nto rear a barrow over the corpses slain, and had said: “No! the\nwritten or pictograph character for ’soldierly’ is made up of two\nparts, one signifying ’stop,’ and the other ’weapons.’” By this he\nmeant to say what the great philosopher Lao-tsz, himself a Ts’u\nman, over and over again inculcated; namely, that the true soldier\ndoes not glory in war, but mournfully aims at victory with the\nsole view of attaining rightful ends. Not only was this half-\nbarbarian king thus capable of making a pun which from the\npictograph point of view still holds good to-day, but he goes on\nin the same speech to cite the “peace-loving war” of Wu Wang, or\nthe Martial King, founder of the Chou dynasty, and to cite several\nstandard odes in allusion to it.",
        "These examples might be multiplied a hundredfold, For instance, in\nthe year 589 a Ts’u minister cites the Odes; in 575 a Tsin officer\nquotes the Book; in 569 another makes allusion to the ancient\nattempt made by the ruler of the then vassal Chou state, the\nfather of the imperial Chou founder, and who was at the same time\nadviser at the imperial court, to reconcile the vassal princes to\nthe legitimate Shang dynasty Emperor (who had already imprisoned\nhim once out of pique at his remonstrances), before finally\ndeciding to dethrone him. In 546 a Sung envoy cites the Odes to\nthe Ts’u government, and also quotes from that section of the\n\"Book” called the Book of the Hia Dynasty, In connection with the\nyear 582 an ode is cited for the benefit of the King of Ts’u,\nwhich is not in Confucius’ collection. In 541 a Ts’u envoy, who\nwas being entertained in Tsin at a convivial wine party, indulges\nin apt quotations from the Odes.",
        "There does not seem to be one single instance where any one in\nTs’in either sings an ode, quotes orthodox history, or in any way\ndisplays literary knowledge. Even the barbarian Kou-tsien, King of\nYueeh, has wise saws and modern instances quoted to him in his\ndistress. For instance, whilst hesitating about utterly\nannihilating the Wu reigning family, he was advised: “If one will\nnot take gifts from Heaven, Heaven may send one misfortune.” This\nis a very hackneyed saying in ancient Chinese history, and is as\nmuch used to-day as it was 2500 years ago: it comes from the Book\nof Chou (now partly lost). It will be remembered that the\ndistinguished Japanese statesman, Count Okuma, in his now\nnotorious speech before the Kobe Chamber of Commerce on the 20th\nOctober, 1907, used these identical words to point the moral of\nIndian commerce. It is doubtful if any other really pregnant\nJapanese philosophical saying exists which cannot be similarly\ntraced to China. In any case, Count Okuma was only literally\ncarrying out in Kobe the policy of Tsin, Ts’u, Ts’i, and Wei\nstatesmen of China 2500 years ago.",
        "If, as we have assumed, standard books were usually committed to\nmemory (and it must be remembered that the Odes, and much of the\nBook, the Changes, and the Rites are still so committed to memory\nin our own times), and were practically confined to the\nheadquarters or the wealthy families of each state, the cognate\nquestion inevitably arises: What about the historical records? It\nhas already been observed that Ts’in, the half-Tartar power in the\nextreme west, was the only state belonging to the recognized\nfederal system (and that only since 771 B.C.) of which nothing\nliterary is recorded, and which, though powerful enough to assist\nin making Emperors of Chou and rulers of Tsin, was never in\nConfucian times thought morally fit to act as Protector of the\nImperial Federal Union, i.e. of Chu Hia, or “All the Chinas.\"\nBy a singular irony of fate, however, it so happens that a few Ts’in\ninscriptions are the only political ones remaining to us of ancient\nChinese documents.",
        "When the outlying semi-Chinese states surrounding the inner\nconclave of orthodox Chinese states, after four centuries of\nfighting and intrigue for the Protectorate, or at least for\npreponderance, at last, during the period 400-375 B.C. became the\nSix Powers, all equally royal, none of them owing any real,\nscarcely even any nominal, allegiance to the once solitary King or\nEmperor, then it was that the idea began to enter the heads of the\nTs’in statesmen and the rulers of at least three of the Six Royal\nPowers opposed to Ts’in that it would be a good thing to get rid\nof the old feudal vassal system root and branch. So unquestionably\nis this period 400-375 B.C. taken as one of the great pivot points\nin Chinese history, that the great historian Sz-ma Kwang begins\nhis renowned history, the Tsz-chi Tung-kien, published in\n1084 A.D., with the words: “In 403 B.C. the states of Han, Ngwei,\nand Chao were recognized as vassal ruling princes by the Emperor.\"\nTs’in took to educating herself seriously for her great destiny,\nand at last, in 221 B.C., after the wars already described in\nChapter XXVI., succeeded in uniting all known China under one\ncentralized sway; rounding off the Tartars so as to make the Great\nWall (rather than the Yellow River, as of old) their southern\nlimit; conquering the remains of the “Hundred Yueeh” (the vague\nunknown South China which had hitherto been the special preserve\nof Ts’u;) and assimilating the ancient empire of Shuh (i.e. Sz\nCh’wan, hitherto only vaguely known to orthodox China at all, and\npolitically connected only with Ts’in).",
        "During this process of universal assimilation and annexation, the\nalmost supernaturally active First August Emperor made tour after\ntour throughout his new dominions, showing a special predilection\nfor the coasts, for Tartarland, and for the Lower Yang-tsz River;\nbut not venturing far up or far south of that Great River; and\neven when he did so venture a short distance, never leaving the\nold and well-known water routes: nor did he risk a land journey to\nSz Ch’wan, to which country there were at the time no roads of any\nkind at all possible for armies. It is well known that both he and\nthe legal, international, political, and diplomatical adventurers\nwho had been for a century or more from time to time at his court\nhad been strongly imbued with the somewhat revolutionary and then\nfashionable democratic principles of the new Taoism, as defined by\nthe philosopher Lao-tsz; but he showed no particular hostility to\northodox literature until, whilst on his travels, deputations of\nlearned men, especially in the ritual centres of Lu and Ts’i,\nbegan to suggest to him the re-establishment of the old feudal\nsystem, and to “quote the ancient scriptures” to him by way of\nprotesting mildly against his too drastic political changes. It\nhas been explained in Chapter XIII. that in 626 B.C., when his\ngreat ancestor Duke Muh had availed himself of the advisory\nservices of an educated Tartar (of Tsin descent), this Tartar had\nmade use of the expression: “The King of the Tartars governs in a\nsimple, ready way, without the aid of the Odes and the Book as in\nthe case of China.” Thus it was that, possibly with this ancient\nwarning in his mind, he conceived a sudden, violent, and\npassionate hatred for didactic works generally, and two books in\nparticular-the very two, passages from which pedants, philosophers,\nambassadors, and ministers had for centuries hurled at each other’s\nheads alike in convivial, argumentative, and solemn moments. In\nother words, the Odes and the Book, together with Confucius’\n\"Springs and Autumns,” with its censorious hints for rulers, and all\nthe other local Annals and Histories, were under anathema, But\nmore detestable even than these were the new philosophical\ntreatises of a polemical kind, which girded at monarchs through\ntheir subtle choice of words and anecdotes, or which recalled the\ngood old times of the feudal emperors and their not very obsequious\nvassals. His self-laudatory inscriptions upon stone, scattered about\nas he travelled from place to place, tell us plainly, in his own royal\nwords, that this hatred of presumptuous vassal claims was his prime\nmotive in destroying all the pedants and books he could secure. He\ndenounces the vassals of bygone times who ignored the Supreme\nEmperor, fought with each other, and had the insolence to “carve stone\nand metal in order to record their own deeds.” The Changes are quoted\nin history often enough by statesmen, as well as the Odes and the Book;\nbut, even if the First August Emperor did not entertain the suspicion that\nthe first were (as, indeed, they are according to our Western\nlights) all “hocus-pocus,” he was himself very credulous and\nsuperstitious, and the learned word-juggling of the Changes was in\nany case harmless to him; so that really his rage was confined to\nthe four or five books, known by heart throughout China, setting\nforth the ancient ritual system of previous dynasties, as\nperfected by the Chou government; the subordination of all other\nkings (Ts’in included) to the Chou family; the wrath of Heaven,\nthe divinity of the people, and so on. Things had been made worse\nduring the Fighting State Period (480-230) by the extraordinary\nliterary activity prevailing at the different royal courts, when\nthe old royal tao had been interpreted in one way by Lao-\ntsz and his followers, in another by Confucius and his school; in\ncountless others by the schools of Legists, Purists, Scholastics,\nCosmogonists, Pessimists, Optimists, and so on. A clean sweep was\naccordingly made, so far as it was possible and practicable, of\nall literature, with the exception (amongst old books) of the\nChanges, and of practical modern or ancient books on astronomy,\nmedicine, and agriculture. At the same time copies of the\nproscribed Odes and Book were kept on record at court for the use\nof the learned in the service of the Emperor. All “histories,\"\nexcept that of Ts’in, were utterly destroyed, and a fortiori all\nargumentative works on history or on administrative policy of any kind.\nThe old Tartar blood and Tartar sympathies of the First August Emperor\nmust surely re-appear in a policy so incompatible with all orthodox\nteaching? In one sense the blight upon Chinese civilization was akin\nto the blight cast upon that of Eastern Europe 500 years ago by the\n\"unspeakable Turk.” The new ruler boldly said: “The world begins\nafresh, with me. No posthumous condemnatory titles for me! My\nsuccessor will be ’August Emperor Number Two,’ and so on for ever.\"\nIt was like the Vendemiaire in 1793.",
        "Thus, except in so far as Confucius may have borrowed from local\nhistories besides that of Lu in making up his “Springs and\nAutumns,” the Annals of Ts’in are the only annals of the feudal\nstates (except the Bamboo Books, or Annals of Tsin, dug up in A.D.\n281) now left to us. That there were such annals in each state is\ncertain, for in 627 B.C. the “great historian” of Tsin is spoken\nof; and in 607 and 510 the names of the Tsin historians are given,\nin the first case apparently a Tartar. That there should be a Tsin\nTartar versed in Chinese literature is not remarkable, for it was\nshown at the close of Chapter XIII. how a learned Tsin Tartar had\nacted as adviser to Duke Muh of Ts’in, and had left behind him a\nwork in two Chapters, which was still in existence in 50 B.C.\nUnder the year 628 B.C., one of the expanded versions of\nConfucius’ history explains how the anarchy which had then been\nfor some time prevailing in Tsin led to certain Tsin events of the\nyear 630 being omitted by Confucius; this is a very important\nstatement, for it infers that Confucius made use of the Tsin\nannals. It is recorded of Confucius that when reading the Shi-\nki (\"Historical Annals”), he expressed very strong views when\nhe came to the events of 632 and 598 B.C., that is, to the place\nwhere the “ordering up” of the Emperor by Tsin is described, and\nto the noble action of the “sage” King of Ts’u; it is interesting\nto know that this old name, Shi-ki, was chosen by the author of\nthe first real history of China published under that title about 90 B.C.,\nand that he was not the inventor of the name, which had already for\ncenturies been applied in a general sense to the historical annals either\nof Lu or of China generally.",
        "In 547 B.C. it is stated that the “great historian” of Ts’i made\ncertain remarks: we have already seen in the present Chapter how\nthe Ts’i wife of the Second Protector was in 640 B.C. perfectly\nwell acquainted with the historical and philosophical works of\nKwan-tsz, the great administrative innovator of Ts’i under the\nFirst Protector. In the second century B.C. Kwan-tsz’s work of\neighty-six Chapters was placed at the head of the Taoist works (of\ncourse before Taoism became Lao-tsz’s speciality). It is\nmentioned, quite casually, in the year 538, in a political\nconversation which took place with the King of Ts’u, that the\nFirst Protector of Ts’i in the year 647 B.C. had had to contend\nwith the serious rebellion of a subject (who is named). All\ncircumstances point to the truth of this isolated, but otherwise\nmost specific statement; yet it is not mentioned elsewhere,–\nevidence, if it were wanted, that many historical works, from\nwhich facts were borrowed as though the details were well known to\nall, must have disappeared entirely.",
        "As to Ts’u, its Annals were known by the curious name of “Stinking\nWood,” by which it is supposed that the evil recorded of men upon\nwooden tablets was meant. That Ts’u subsequently developed a high\nliterary capacity is evident, for the anniversary of the suicide\nof the celebrated Ts’u poet K’ueh Yiian (envoy to Ts’i during the\nfierce diplomatic intrigues of 31 B.C.) has been kept up as the\nannual “dragon festival” down to our own times, in memory of his\nsuicide by drowning in the Tung-t’ing Lake district; and his poems\nare amongst the most beautiful in the Chinese language. In 656\nB.C. the dictatorial First Protector tried to play the role\nof the wolf, with Ts’u in the character of the lamb: he said: “How\nis it you have not for so many generations past sent your tribute\nof sedge to the Emperor? How about the other Emperor who visited\n(modern) Hankow in 1003 B.C. and was never heard of again?” The\nKing replied: “As to our failure to send tribute, we admit it; as\nto the supposed murder of the Emperor 350 years ago, you had\nbetter ask the people of Hankow themselves what they know of it.\"\n(Ts’u had hardly yet permanently advanced so far east.)",
        "In 496 B.C. it is recorded of a scholar at the Emperor’s court\nthat, being anxious to see his own name in the “Springs and\nAutumns,” he suggested to the Emperor that for a long time no\ncomplimentary mission had been sent to Lu. The result was that he\nwas sent himself, and is thus immortalized: it does not follow\nfrom this that the knowledge of Confucius’ coming book had\npenetrated to the Chou court, because “Springs and Autumns” was\nalready the accepted term in Lu for “Annals,” long before\nConfucius adopted the already existing general name for his own\nparticular work. In 496 Confucius had left Lu in disgust, and had\ngone to Wei–the capital of Wei was then on, or near, the then\nYellow River (now the River Wei), between the two towns marked\n\"Hwa” and “K’ai” on modern maps–where he collected materials for\nhis History; but he did not begin it until the year 481; so\nprobably the ambitious scholar simply hoped to appear in the\n\"Springs and Autumns” of Lu, as they had already been called\nbefore Confucius borrowed the name, just as Sz-ma Ts’ien borrowed\nthe name Shi-ki.",
        "As to Ts’in, Ts’in’s own Annals tell us that “in 753 B.C.\nhistorians were first established to keep record of events.” Hence\neven the Ts’in records, the sole annals preserved from the flames,\nmust be retrospective from that date. In any case they contain\nnothing of historical importance farther back than 753 B.C.,\nexcept the wars with Tartars; the accompanying of the Emperor Muh,\nas charioteer, by a Ts’in prince on the occasion of his “going to\nexamine his fiefs in the west\"; and the cession of the old Chou\nappanage to Ts’in in 771. By their baldness, and by the baldness\nof the Bamboo Books, and of Confucius’ own “Springs and Autumns,\"\nwe may fairly judge of the probable insufficiency and dryness of\nthe Annals of Ts’u, Ts’i, Wei, CHENG, Sung, and other states\ninterested in the welter of the Fighting State Period. Early\nChinese annals contain little more satisfying than the “generations of\nAdam” in the fifth Chapter of Genesis.",
        "Having now derived some definite notions of how the Chinese\nadvanced from the patriarchal to the feudal, from the submissive\nand monarchical to the emulous and democratic, finally to collapse\nunder the overpowering grasp of a single Dictator or Despot, whose\ncentralized system in the main, still survives; having also seen\nhow the nucleus of China proper was encompassed on three sides by\nTibetans, Tartars, Tunguses, Coreans, and by various ill-defined\ntribes to the south; let us see if there is any evidence whatever\nto show, or even to suggest to us, whence the orthodox Chinese\noriginally came, and who they were.",
        "First and foremost, it seems primarily unnecessary to suggest at\nall that they came from anywhere; for, if the position be once\nassumed as an axiom that all people must have immigrated from some\nplace to the place in which we first find them, or hear of them,\nthen the double question arises: “Why should the persons we find\nin A., and who, we think, may have come from B., not have migrated\nfrom A. to B. before they migrated back from B. to A.?” Or: “If\nthe people we find at A. must have come from B., whence did the\npeople at B. come, before they went to A.?” To put it in another\nway: given the existence 4000 or 5000 years ago of Chinese in\nChina, Egyptians in Egypt, and Babylonians in Babylonia–why\nshould one group be assumed to be older than the other? The only\nground for suggesting that these groups had not each a separate\nevolution, is the assumption that man was “created” once for all,\nand created summarily; in which case it follows with mathematical\nprecision that the ultimate ancestry of every man living extends\nback to exactly the same date. That is to say, the highest and the\nlowest, the blackest and the whitest, only differ in this, that\nsome men began to keep records earlier than others; for the man\nwho keeps no records loses track of his ancestors, and that is\nall. Not to mention other races, some of our own noblest English\nfamilies trace back their ancestry to a favoured or successful\nperson, who was of no hereditary distinction before he distinguished\nhimself; whilst on the other hand the tramp and the street-walker\nmay have as “royal” blood in their veins as any lineal princely personage.\nIt is records, therefore, that differentiate “civilized” from uncivilized\npeople, blue blood from plebeian; and as we see millions of people\nliving without records to-day in various parts of the world,\nnotwithstanding that for centuries, or even for millenniums, they\nhave been surrounded by or in immediate contact with neighbours\npossessing records, it seems to follow that a nation’s greatness may\nbegin at any time, independently of the blueness of its blood, the\nrobustness of its warriors, the beauty of its women; that is, whenever\nit chooses to keep records, and thus to cultivate itself: for records are\nnothing more than the means of keeping experiences in stock,\ninstead of having to repeat them every day; they are thus\naccumulations of national wealth. It by no means follows that\nbecause records can be traced back farther in the case of one\nnation than in the case of another, that the first nation is older\nthan the other; for instance, although in the West our various\nalphabets appear to refer themselves back to one same source, or\nto a few sources which probably all hark back ultimately to one\nand the same, there seems no reason to believe that the Chinese\ndid not independently invent, develop, and perfect their own\nscheme of written records: the mere fact that we learnt how to\nwrite is some evidence in support of the proposition that they\nalso, being men like ourselves, learnt how to write.",
        "There is no documentary evidence for the barest existence of\nancient China, or of any part of it, which is not to be found in\nthe Chinese records, and in them alone; no nation anywhere near\nChina has any record or tradition of either its own or of China’s\nexistence at a period earlier than the Chinese records indicate.\nThose records do not contain the faintest allusion to Egypt,\nBabylonia, India, or any other foreign country or place whatever\noutside the extremely limited area of the Central Nucleus, and the\nlarger area occupied by the semi-Chinese colonial powers\nsurrounding it. Nor is there the faintest evidence that the\nBiblical “land of Sinim” had any reference to China, which seems\nto have been as absolutely unknown to the West previous to, say,\n250 B.C., as America was unknown to Europe, or Europe to America\nprevious to 1400 A.D. If any ideas were derived from China by the\nWest, or from the West by China, the records of both China and the\nWest alike point, however, to one obvious connecting link, and\nthat is, the horse-riding nomads of the north, who are now, it is\ntrue, in some parts a little more settled than they used to be,\nand who have been tamed in various degrees by dogmatic religions\nunknown to them in ancient times, but who remain in many respects\nnow very much what they were 3000 years ago. Of course pedlars,\nhawkers, and even long-course caravans travelled, whenever the\nroutes were free, from place to place in ancient times as they do\nnow; but it is exceedingly improbable that there would be any\nthrough-travellers from Europe to China, except one or two\noccasional waifs or adventurers buffeted through by chance. If 600\nyears ago, Marco Polo’s through-route adventures were regarded in\nEurope as almost incredible, notwithstanding the then recent and\nwell-trodden war-path of the Mongol armies, what chances are there\nof through-travel 2000 years before that? And, even if a rare case\noccasionally occurred, what chances are there of any one recording\nit?",
        "The probability is, so far as sane experience takes us, that the\nChinese had been exactly where we first find them for many\nthousand years, or even for myriads of years, before their own\ntraditions begin. With the exception of the discovery of America,\nwhich brought a flood of strangers into a strange land, and\nspeedily exterminated the aborigines, there do not appear to be\nany authenticated instances in history of extensive and robust\npopulations being entirely displaced like flocks of sheep by\nothers. Any one who travels widely in China can see for himself\nthat, wherever unassimilated tribes live in complete or partial\nindependence, and, a fortiori, where the assimilation has\nbeen carried out, all those tribes possess at least this point in\ncommon with the original Chinese or the assimilated speakers of\nChinese–that their language is monosyllabic, uninflected, not\nagglutinative, and tonic; i.e. that each word is “sung” in a\nparticular way, besides being pronounced in a particular way.\nProbably those tribes before they were absorbed, or, despite their\nnot having yet been absorbed by the Chinese, had been there as\nlong as the Chinese had been in the contiguous Chinese parts. It\nseems reasonable to suppose that the Chinese would absorb their\nown race-classes more readily than they would absorb Tartars,\nJapanese, and Coreans, all of whom belong to the same dissyllabic,\nlong-worded, agglutinative family. And so it is: the Chinese\nfollowed the lines of least resistance (after themselves becoming\ncultured) and worked their way down the rivers and other\nwatercourses towards what we call South China. From the very\nfirst, their passage northwards across the Yellow River was\ncontested by the Tartars, whom they have since partly driven back,\nand partly (with great effort) absorbed. They have never been able\nto assimilate the Coreans, not to say the Japanese, though both\npeoples took very kindly to Chinese civilization after our\nChristian era, when first friendly missions began to be\ninterchanged. Indo-China contains many more of the monosyllabic\nand tonic tribes than of others; if, indeed, there are any at all\nof the dissyllabic and non-tonal classes; and the Chinese have no\ndifficulty in merging themselves with Annamese, Tonquinese,\nCambodgians, Siamese, Shans, Thos, Laos, Mons, and such like\npeoples: but their own administrative base is too far north; the\nconditions of food and climate in Indo-China are not quite\nfavourable for the marching of armies, especially when it is\nremembered that the best troops used have always been Tartars,\nused to warm clothes and heating food. There have, besides, always\nbeen rival Indian religion, rival Indian colonization, rival\nIndian language, and rival Indian trade influence to contend with.\nNo absorption of Indian races has ever been anywhere effected by\nChina. Tibetans never came into question in ancient times; if they\nwere known, it could only have been to Shuh (Sz Ch’wan) and Ts’in\nor early Chou (Shen Si).",
        "If it had not been the Chinese of Ho Nan who first used records,\nit is just as probable that the tonic and monosyllabic absorption\nwhich, as things were and are, moved from north to south, might\nhave moved from south to north. During the Chou dynasty (1122\nB.C.-222 B.C.), when the extension of the Chinese race took place\n(which had probably already for long gone on) in the clear light\nof history, it will be noticed that the rulers of all the great\ncolony nations of the south–Ts’u, Wu, and Yueeh–had, in turn, to\nremind the Emperor of China of their perfect equality with him in\nspiritual claim and ancient descent; of their connection with\ndynasties precedent to his; of times when his ancestor was a mere\nvassal like themselves. No Tartars of those times ever put forth\nclaims like these, though, it is true, in much later times some of\nthe (non-Turkish) Tartar rulers of North China traced their\nancestors back to the mythical Chinese emperors who reigned in\nShan Tung. Again, the founder of the Hia dynasty (2205 B.C.) is\nrepeatedly said to have been buried at modern Shao-hing (between\nHangchow and Ningpo), and the King of Yueeh even sacrificed to him\nthere. So the Emperor Shun, the predecessor and patron of the same\nfounder, was traditionally buried near Ch’ang-sha in modern Hu Nan\nprovince. The First August Emperor included both these “lions” in\nhis pleasure tours among the great sights of China. No sound\nhistorical deduction, of course, can be drawn from these\ntraditions, however persistent: if false, they were, at any rate,\nopen to the criticism of a revolutionary and all-powerful Emperor\nover 2000 years ago, and to a second, almost equally powerful, who\nvisited both places a century later; the suggestion inevitably\nfollows from the existence of these traditions in the south that\neither the cultured Chinese whom we first find in Ho Nan had moved\nnorthwards from Hu Nan, Kiang Si, and the lake districts\ngenerally, before they spread themselves backwards; or that the\nuncultured Chinese had moved north before the cultured Chinese\nmoved south; or that both north and south Chinese were at first\nequally cultured, until within historical times the north Chinese\n(i.e. in Ho Nan, along the Yellow River) so perfected their system\nof records that they carried all before them. After all there is\nno strain on the imagination in suggesting this, for early Western\ncivilization grew up in the same way.",
        "There is not the smallest hint of any immigration of Chinese from\nthe Tarim Valley, from any part of Tartary, from India, Tibet,\nBurma, the Sea, or the South Sea Islands: in fact, there is no\nhint of immigration from anywhere even in China itself, except as\nabove hypothetically described. There the Chinese are, and there\nthey were; and there is an end to the question, so far as\ndocumentary evidence goes. Of course, the persistent Tarim Valley\nscheme proposed is only a means to get in the thin end of the\nwedge, in order to drive home the thick end in the shape of a\ndefinite start from the Tower of Babel, and an ultimate reference\nto the Garden of Eden. If there are still people who believe it\ntheir duty on Scriptural principle to accept this naive Western\norigin of the Chinese, there is no reason why religious belief or\nimagination should not be perfectly respected, and even find a\nworking compromise with the principle of strict adherence to human\nevidence. If supernatural agencies be once admitted (as the\nlimited human intellect understands Nature), there seems to be no\nmore reason for accepting the creation of a complete whale\n(already a hundred years old, according to the growth period of\nlater whales), than for accepting the creation of complete men\nwith 1000 years’ history behind them instead of 100; or that of\nthe earth with 20,000, or even 20,000,000 years’ history behind\nit, and even before it; for as the first whale, or pair of whales,\nmust set the standard of natural history for all future whales, so\nthe man created with history behind him may equally well have\nhistory created in front of him. “Nature,” according to the\nimperfect human understanding, is no more outraged in one case\nthan in the other, nor can mere time or size count as anything\ntowards increasing our wonder when we tell ourselves what\nsupernatural things unseen powers superior to ourselves may have\ndone. This amounts to the same thing as saying that dogmatic\nbelief, personal religious conviction, agnosticism, superstition,\nand imagination are all on equal terms, and are equally\nrespectable factors when confronted with human historical\nevidence, so long as they are kept rigidly apart from the latter,\nAs an eminent Catholic has recently said: “The Church has no more\nreason to be afraid of modern science than it was of ancient\nscience.” In other words, however pious and religious a man may be\n(as we understand the words in Europe), there is no reason why, as\na recreation apart from his faith, he should not rigidly adhere to\nthe human evidence of history so far as it goes. On the other\nhand, however sceptical and discriminating a man may be, from the\npoint of view of imperfect human knowledge, in the admittance of\nhumanly proved fact, there is no reason why, from the emotional\nand imaginative side of his existence, he should not rigidly\nsubscribe to dogma or personal conviction, whether the abstract\nidea of virtue, the concrete idea of love for some cherished human\nbeing, or the yearning for some supernatural state of sinlessness\nbe concerned. A distinguished financier, for instance, may regale\nhis imagination with socialistic dreams of a perfect Utopia; but,\nwhen the weekly household bills are presented to him, he deals\nwith overcharges in pence like any other practical individual.",
        "From one point of view, the Chinese, already provided with their\ntonic language at the Confusion of Tongues, marched to the Yellow\nRiver, where we find them. From the other, there is no evidence\nwhatever to connect the Chinese with any people other than those\nwe find near them now, and which have from the earliest times been\nnear them; no evidence that their language, their civilization,\ntheir manners, ever received anything from, or gave anything to,\nIndia, Babylonia, Persia, Egypt, or Greece, except so far as has\nbeen suggested above, or will be suggested below.",
        "Allusion has already been made to the eclipses mentioned in\nConfucius’ history as a means by which the probability of his\ngeneral truth as a historian may in a certain measure be gauged. A\nfew words upon the Chinese calendar, as it is and was, may\ntherefore not be amiss. The Chinese month has from first to last\nbeen uncompromisingly lunar; that is to say, the first day of each\nmonth, or “moon” as it may strictly and properly be called, always\nfalls within the day (beginning at midnight) during which the new\nmoon occurs. Of course, Peking is the administrative centre now,\nand therefore the observations are taken there with reference to\nthe Peking meridian. As Confucius took his facts and records\nmainly from the Lu archives, and (we must suppose) noted celestial\nmovements from what was seen by the Lu astronomers, it has always\nbeen presumed that the eclipses mentioned by him were observed\nfrom Lu too; that is, from a station over four degrees of\nlongitude and one of latitude removed from the imperial capital as\nit then was (modern Ho-nan Fu). It was the duty of all sovereign\nprinces to proclaim the first day of the moon at their ancestral\ntemple; and even if the Chinese of those days had discovered the\ndifference in “time” between east and west, these princes must\neach of them have proclaimed the day during which the new moon\noccurred as it occurred to themselves, in their own State, and not\nas it occurred to the Emperor’s astronomers. On the other hand,\nwhen eclipses were observed from the comparatively small territory\nof Lu, it must have occurred, at least occasionally, that visitors\nfrom other states had either the same eclipse or other eclipses to\nreport. If the Emperor’s astronomer reported eclipses in Ho-nan-\nFu on a given day, it is difficult to see how Lu, which was a\ncentre almost of equal standing with the imperial capital for\northodoxy in rites and records, could have entirely ignored such\nreports.",
        "But the Chinese year has always been luni-solar. From the earliest\ntimes they had observed the twelve ecliptical “mansions” and\nzodiacal signs, and also that the time occupied by the sun in\ntravelling through a mansion was rather longer than one lunation,\nor the time intervening between two new moons. Their object has\naccordingly always been to bring the lunar and solar years into\nmanageable combination, so that the equinoxes, solstices, and\n\"seasons” might occur with as much regularity as possible in the\nsame months, and so that the husbandman might know when to sow his\ngrain. Formerly they regulated this discrepancy according to the\nmean movements of the sun and moon; but, ever since the Jesuits\nfirst instructed them more accurately, they have regulated the two\nyears, that is, the solar year and the twelve lunations, according\nto the true movements, and with reference to the meridian of\nPeking. If the moons were each exactly 29 1/2 days in length,\ninstead of being 44 minutes 2.87 seconds longer, it would have\nbeen a simple matter to halve the ordinary lunar year, and make\nsix months “large” (30 days) and six “small” (29 days); but the\nextra 44 minutes and a fraction accumulate, and the result is that\nthere must always be a larger number of “great” months than\n\"small” in the year. The way the Chinese arranged this was to call\na month “great” (30 days) if the interval between mid-night\n(beginning of the new-moon day) and the hour of the next\nnew moon was full 30 days or over in duration; if less than 30\ndays, then the month was a “small” one (29 days). Not more than\ntwo long months ever followed in succession, and two short months\nnever did so.",
        "But, in any case, even twelve regular moons of 291/2 days only\nmake 354 days, whereas a solar year is about 3651/4 days, whilst\nthe sun’s time in passing through a “mansion” (one-twelfth of the\nsolar year) is about 301/2 days. Thus there was a “superfluity\"\nof about ten days in every lunar year, or about one lunation in\nevery third year; not to mention that a “mansion” was about a day\nlonger than a lunation, and that therefore the husbandman was\nliable to be thrown out of his reckoning. In order to remedy this,\nthe Chinese intercalated a month once in about thirty-three moons,\nand called the intercalary month by the same name as the one\npreceding it, both with regard to the common numbers 1-12, and\nwith regard to the two endless cycles of twelve signs and sixty\nsigns, by which moons are calculated for ever, in the past and in\nthe future. Regarding the difficulty of seasons, the solar year\nwas divided into twenty-four “joints,” and each “joint” was about\nhalf a “mansion” (the difference rarely exceeding one hour).\nHowever, the spring equinox is always the sixth “joint,” and is\nthe middle of spring season: this and the other “joints” being all\nabout 151/4 days in length, the Chinese seasons can be symmetrically\ndivided with relation to both equinoxes and both solstices; for the\nintercalary moon (judiciously made unobtrusive, and kept out of vulgar\nsight as far as possible) settles the lunar year difficulty; and the\nseasons conform, as of course they should do, to the heat of the\nsun, which is  a much more natural and practical arrangement than\nour own arbitrarily assorted and unequal months.",
        "The endless sixty-year cycle of years is usually referred back to\nfor a beginning to either 2697 or 2637 B.C.; but, apart from the\nfact that there is little or no accurate knowledge anterior to 842\nB.C., it is of no importance when it began, so long as sixty pairs\nof equinoxes and solstices are calculated backwards indefinitely.\nIt goes back, in any case, to a date beyond which the memory of\nChinese man runneth not to the contrary; it is unbroken and\ncontinuous; we are free to take up any date we like at sixty-year\nintervals, and say “here I agree to begin”: we cannot deny that\n1908 is the cycle year it purports to be; and even if we did,\nbatches of sixty years backwards from any other cyclic year called\n1908, would always have a fixed relation to the other 4604 years\nrecorded; nor, having accepted 1908, can we deny 1808, 1708, and\nso on, as far back as we like, in order to test how any given\nevent, eclipse or other, coincides relatively with our own date:\nit is not a question of beginning, but of counting back, and\nstopping. We find Confucius of Lu (Chou clan state) using the\ncalendar of the Chou dynasty (1122 B.C.-249 B.C.); whose founder\nhad said: “In future we make the eleventh month the beginning of\nthe year instead of the twelfth month.” The previous dynasty of\nShang (1766-1123) had similarly said: “In future we make the\ntwelfth month begin the year instead of the first.” The previous\ndynasty of Hia (2205-1767) and the individual emperors before had\nall said (or taken for granted): “The year begins in the first\nmonth,” from which we may naturally conclude that there could not\nhave been an earlier calendar, as no “sage” could reasonably begin\nanywhere but at the beginning. At the same time, it must be\nexplained that the astronomical order of the months, counting the\nfirst as being that when the sun enters Capricorn, is different\nfrom the civil order. Thus the Hia, Shang, and Chou first civil\nmonths were the third, second, and first astronomical months,\nrepresenting the sun’s entry into Pisces, Aquarius, and\nCapricorn, respectively. When the First August Emperor\nconquered the whole of China, and proceeded to unify cart-axles,\nweights and measures, written characters, and many other\ndiscrepant popular arrangements, he said: “Let the tenth month be\nin future the first in the year instead of the eleventh.” That is\nto say, he took as civil first month the twelfth astronomical\nmonth, or that in which the sun enters Sagittarius. Thus we\nsee that in 2000 years the calendar had got about 90 days out of\ngear; or, roughly, about an hour a year.",
        "All the above may, perhaps, be understood more clearly by\nconsidering the following unmistakably genuine statement made by\nthe Emperor in 104 B.C., a hundred years after the Ts’in dynasty\nhad been destroyed; after he had contemplated the tombs of the\nancient monarchs as explained in the last Chapter; after the West\nof Asia had been discovered; and when it is possible (though\nthere is no record of it) that Persians, Indians, Greeks, etc., may have\nintervened in discussion upon the calendar. He says: “After the\nEmperors Yu and Li (the two who fled from their metropolis in 771 B.C.\nand 842 B.C. respectively, as related), the Chou dynasty went wrong,\nand those who were doubly subjects began to wield power; astrologers\nceased to keep reckoning of seasons; the princes no longer proclaimed\nthe first day of each moon. Hereditary astronomers got scattered; some\nremained in All the Hia (orthodox China); others betook themselves to\nthe various barbarians. In the twenty-sixth year of the Emperor Siang (626\nB.C.) there was an intercalary third month, which arrangement the\n’Springs and Autumns’ condemns (it should have been at the end of\nthe year)... The First August Emperor took the tenth month as the\nbeginning of the year... The present Emperor (of the Han dynasty)\nappointed two astronomers, the second of whom (a native of East Sz\nCh’wan) advanced the calculations and improved the calendar. Then\nit was found that the measures of the Sun and the Mansions agreed\nwith the principles adopted by the Hia dynasty... The first cyclic\nday and also the first lunar day of the eleventh moon has now been\nproved to be the winter solstice. I change the seventh year (of my\npresent reign-period), and I make of it the first year of the new\nreign-period, to be called ’Great Beginning.’\"–Accordingly what\nhad up to that date been the seventh year (of a reign-period\nbearing another name) now became a year of 442 days; that is to\nsay, the three months postponed in turn by the Hia, Shang, and\nChou dynasties were taken up again, and accordingly that one\ncorrecting year consisted of fifteen months. With slight changes,\nalways adopted only to be again rejected after a few years of\ntrial, this has been the basis of all later calendars; and for\nthis reason Confucius’ birthday is kept on the twenty-seventh day\nof the eighth moon instead of during the tenth moon, as it would\nhave been according to Chou dates.",
        "The above examination into the calendar question tends to show\nstill more clearly the good faith of the historians and the\nadministration; it also illustrates the continuity and painstaking\naccuracy of the Chinese records, whatever other defects they may\notherwise disclose.",
        "One of the difficulties of Chinese ancient history is the\nunravelling of proper names; but, as with other difficulties, this\none is owing rather to the novelty and strangeness of the subject,\nto the unfamiliarity of scene and of atmosphere, than to any\ninherent want of clearness in the matter itself. In reading\nScottish history, no one is much disconcerted to find a man called\nupon the same page (as an imaginary instance), Old John, John\nMcQuhirt, the Master of Weel, the McQuhirt, the Laird o’ Airton,\nthe Laird of the Isle, and the Earl of Airton and Weel; there are\nmany such instances to be found in Boswell’s account of the\nJohnsonian trip to the Hebrides; but the puzzled Englishman has at\nleast his own language and a fairly familiar ground to deal with.\nWhen, however, we come to unpronounceable Chinese names of strange\nindividuals, moving about amid hitherto unheard-of surroundings\n2500 years ago, with a suspicion of uncertainty added about the\ngenuineness and good faith of the whole story, things are apt to\nseem hopelessly involved, even where the best of good-will to\nunderstand is present. Thus Confucius may be called K’ung-tsz,\nK’ung Fu-tsz, or Chung-ni, besides other personal applications\nunder the influence of tabu rules, Tsz-ch’an may be spoken\nof as Kung-sun K’iao, or (if he himself speaks) simply as K’iao.\nAnd so on with nearly all prominent individuals. In those times\nthe family names, or “surnames” as we say in English, were not\nused with the regularity that prevails in China now, when every\none of standing has a fixed family name, such as Li or Yiian,\nfollowed by an official personal name, like Hung-chang or Shi-\nk’ai. In old times the clan or tribe counted first; for instance\nthe imperial clan of Ki included princes of several vassal\nstates. But, after five generations, it was expected that any\ngiven family unit should detach itself. Thus, in 710 B.C.,\nConfucius’ ancestor, son of the composer of odes mentioned on page\n175, took, or was given by the ruler of his native state, Sung,\nthe detached family name of K’ung-fu (Father K’ung), “Father\"\nbeing the social application, and K’ung the surname, which thence\nbecame the family name of a new branch. The old original clan-\nnames were little used by any one in a current sense, just as the\nEnglish family name of Guelph is kept in the dim background so far\nas current use goes. Nor were the personal names, even of Chinese\nemperors and kings, so grave and decorous in style as they have\nalways been in later times. For instance, “Black Buttocks,” “Black\nArm,” “Double Ears\";–such names (decidedly Turkish in style) are\nnot only used of Tsin princes with an admixture of Tartar blood\nnearly always coursing more or less in their veins, but also in\nsuch states as the orthodox Lu. The name “Black Arm,” for\ninstance, is used both by Lu and by Ts’u princes; also by a Ts’u\nprivate individual; whilst an orthodox Duke of Sung bears the\npurely Turkish name of T’ouman, which (and exactly the same\npictograph characters, too) was also the name of the first\nhistorical Hiung-nu (later Turkish) Khan several centuries later.\nThe name Luh-fu or “Emoluments Father,” belonging to the\nson of the last Emperor of the Shang dynasty in 1123 B.C., was\nalso the personal name of one of the rulers of Ts’i many centuries\nlater. In the same way we find identical personal names in CH’EN\nand Lu, and also in Ts’u and Lu princes. Eunuchs were not\nconsidered to possess family names, or even official personal\nnames. If there had been then, as now, a celibate priestly caste,\nno doubt then, as now, priests would also have been relieved of\ntheir family name rights.",
        "It seems quite clear that many if not most family names began in\nChina with the name of places, somewhat after the Scotch style:\neven in Lancashire the title of the old lord of the manor is often\nthe family surname of many of the village folk around. Take the\nChinese imperial domain for instance; in the year 558 one Liu Hia\ngoes to meet his master the new Emperor. His name (Hia) and\nsurname (Liu) would serve just as well for current use to-day, as\nfor example with the late viceroy Liu K’un-yih; but we are told\nLiu Hia was so “named” by the historian in full because his rank\nwas not that of first-class statesman, and it is explained that\nLiu was the name of his tenancy in the imperial appanage. At a Lu\nfuneral in 626 B.C. the Emperor’s representative to the vassal\nstate is spoken of complimentarily by his social appellation in\nview of his possessing first-class ministerial rank: he cannot be\nspoken of by his detached clan-name, or family name, “because he\nhas not yet received a town in fee.” A few years later, another\nimperial messenger is spoken of as King-shuh (Glory Uncle),\n\"Glory” being the name of his manor or fee, and “Uncle” his social\nappellation. In 436 B.C. the Emperor sent a present of sacrificial\nmeat to Lu by X. As X is thus “named,” he must be of “scholar\"\nrank, as an imperial “minister” (it is explained) could not be\nthus named. The ruler alone has the right to “affront a man” at\nall times with his personal name, but even a son in speaking of\nhis own father to the Emperor may “affront” his father, because\nboth his father and himself are on equal subject footing before\nthe Emperor. To “name” a man in history is not always like\n\"naming” a member in the House of Commons. For instance, the King\nof Ts’u, as mentioned in Chapter XXVII., was named for killing a\nChinese in 531, but not for killing a barbarian prince in 526 B.C.\nIt was partly by these delicate shades of naming or not naming,\ntitling or not titling, that Confucius hinted at his opinions in\nhis history: in the Ts’u case, it seems to have been an honour to\n\"name” a barbarian. Wei Yang, Kung-sun Yang, or Shang Kiin, or\nShang Yang, the important personage who carried a new civilization\nto Ts’in, and practically “created” that power about 350 B.C.,\nwas, personally, simply named Yang, or “Bellyband.” As he came\noriginally from the orthodox state or principality of Wei, he\nmight be called Wei Yang, just as we might say Alexander of Fife.\nAs he received from Ts’in, as a reward for his services, the petty\nprincipality of Shang (taken in war by Ts’in from Ts’u), he might\nbe called the prince or laird (kuen) of Shang (of. Lochiel),\nor Shang Kuen. As he was the grandson (sun) of a deceased earl\n(called kung, or “duke,” as a posthumous compliment), he\nwas entitled to take the family name of Kung-sun, just as we say\n\"Fitzgeorge” or “Fitzwilliam.” Finally, he was Yang (= John) of\nShang (= Lochiel). In speaking of this man to an educated Chinese,\nit does not in the least matter which of the four names be used.\nIn the same way, Tsz-ch’an (being a duke’s grandson) was Kung-sun\nK’iao. The word tsz, or “son,” after a family name, as for\ninstance in K’ung-tsz (Confucius), is defined as having the effect of\n\"gracefully alluding to a male.” It seems really to be the same in effect\nas the Latin us, as in Celsius, Brutus, Thompsonius, etc. When\nit precedes, not the family name or the tabu’d personal\nname, but the current or acquaintance name, then it seems to have\nthe effect of Don or Dom, used with the most attenuated\nhonorificity; or the effect of “Mr.” Fu-tsz means “The Master.”",
        "As to tabus, the following are curious specific instances.\nKing, or “Jungle,” was the earliest name for Ts’u, or “Brushwood,\"\nthe uncleared region south of the River Han, along the banks of\nthe Yang-tsz; and it afterwards became a powerful state. But one\nof the most powerful kings of Ts’in (249-244) was called Tsz-ts’u,\nor “Don Brushwood,” so his successor the First August Emperor (who\nwas really a bastard, and not of genuine Ts’in blood at all)\ntabu’d the word Ts’u, and ordered historians to use the old\nname King instead. In the same way the philosopher Chwang Chou, or\nChwang-tsz, was spoken of by the Han historians as Yen Chou,\nbecause chwang was an imperial personal name. Both words\nmean “severe”: it is as though private Romans and public scribes\nhad been commanded to call themselves and to write Austerus,\ninstead of Severus, out of respect for the Emperor Septimius\nSeverus. The business-like First August Emperor, himself, evidently\nhad no hand in the pedantic King and Ts’u tabu business,\nfor one of his first general orders when he became Supreme Emperor\nin 221 B.C., was to proclaim that “in ancient times there were no\nposthumous names, and they are hereby suppressed. I am Emperor\nthe First. My successor will simply be Emperor the Second, and so\non for ever.” There is no clear record of posthumous names and titles\nanterior to the Chou dynasty; the first certain instance is the father of\nthe founder, whose personal name was Ch’ang, and who had been\ngenerally known as the “Earl of the West.” His son, the founder, made\nhim W&n Wang, or the “Civilian King,” posthumously. In the same way the\nDuke of Chou, a son of the Civilian King, made his brother the\nfounder, personally called Fah, Wu Wang, or the “Warrior\nKing.” The same Duke of Chou (the first ruler of Lu, and\nConfucius’ model in all things) was the virtual founder of the\nChou administrative system in general, and also of the posthumous\nname rules which were “intended to punish the bad and encourage\nthe good\"; but counsellors have naturally always been very\ngingerly and roundabout in wounding royal family feeling by\nselecting too harsh a “punishing” name.",
        "Not only royal and princely personages had posthumous names. In\n817 and 796 B.C., each, we find a counsellor of the Emperor spoken\nof both by the real and the posthumous name. In 542 B.C. a\nconcubine of one of the Lu rulers is spoken of by her clan-name\nand her posthumous name. In 560 B.C. the dying King of Ts’u\nmodestly alludes to the choice of an inferior posthumous name\nbefitting him and his poor talents, for use at the times of\nbiennial sacrifice to his manes, and adds: “I am now going to take\nmy place a la suite, in company with my ancestors in the\ntemple.”",
        "Persons of the same clan-name could not properly intermarry. Thus\nthe Emperor Muh, who is supposed to have travelled to Turkestan in\nthe tenth century B.C., had a mysterious liaison during his\nexpedition with a beauteous Miss Ki (i.e. a girl of his own\nclan), who died on the way. The only way tolerant posterity can make\na shift to defend this “incest,” is by supposing that in those times the\nnames of relatives were “arranged differently.” However, the mere\nfact that the funeral ceremonies were carried out with full imperial\nChou ritual, and that incest is mentioned at all, seems to militate against\nthe view (noticed in Chapter XIII.) that it was Duke Muh of Ts’in who\n(400 years later) undertook this journey, for he did not belong to\nthe Ki family at all. Curiously enough, it fell to the lot\nof the son and successor of the Emperor Muh to have to punish and\ndestroy a petty vassal state whose ruler had committed the\nincestuous act of marrying three sisters of his own clan-name. In\n483 B.C. the ruler of Lu also committed an indiscretion by\nmarrying a Ki girl. As her clan-name must, according to\nrule, be mentioned at her burial, she was not formally buried at\nall, but the whole affair was hushed up, and she was called by the\nfancy name of Meng-tsz (exactly the same characters as “Mencius”),",
        "Another instance serves to illustrate the above-mentioned imperial\njourney west, and the fief questions jointly. When the Emperor Muh\nwent west, he was served as charioteer by one of the ancestors of\nthe future Ts’in principality, who for his services was enfeoffed\nat Chao (north of Shan Si province). Chao was one of the three\nstates into which Tsin broke up in 403 B.C., and was very Tartar\nin its sympathies. Thus, as both Ts’in and Chao bore the same\noriginal clan-name of Ying, granted to the Ts’in family as\npossessions of the Ts’in fief (Eastern Kan Suh province) by the\nearly Chou emperors in 870 B.C., Ts’in is often spoken of as\nhaving the sub-clan-name of Chao. These facts, again, all militate\nagainst the theory that it was Duke Muh of Ts’in who made the\nvoyage of discovery usually attributed to the Chou Emperor Muh;\nfor Duke Muh’s lineal ancestor, ancestor also of the original\nTs’in Ying, himself acted as guide in Tartary to the Emperor Muh.\nThe First August Emperor, who was, as already stated, really a\nbastard, was borne by the concubine of a Chao merchant, who made\nover the concubine whilst enceinte to his (the Emperor’s)\nfather, when that father was a royal Ts’in hostage dwelling in the\nstate of Chao; hence the Emperor is often called Chao CHENG\n(CHENG being his personal name). He had thus a double claim\nto the family name of Chao, first because–granting his\nlegitimacy–his Ts’in ancestor (also the ancestor of all the Chao\nfamily) was, during the ninth century B.C., enfeoffed in Chao; and\nsecondly because, when Chao became an independent kingdom, he was,\nduring the third century B.C., himself born in Chao to a Chao man\nof a Chao woman.",
        "A great deal more might of course be said upon the subject of\nnames, and of their effect in sometimes obscuring, sometimes\nelucidating, historical facts; but these few remarks will perhaps\nsuffice, at least, to suggest the importance of scrutinizing\nclosely the possible bearing of each name upon the political\nevents connected with it.",
        "Mention has been made of eunuchs, a class which seems to have\noriginated with the law’s severity rather than from a callous\ndesire of the rich to secure a craven and helpless medium and\nmeans for pandering to and enjoying the pleasures of the harem\nwithout fear of sexual intrigue. Criminals whose feet were cut off\nwere usually employed as park-keepers simply because there could\nbe no inclination on their part to gad about and chase the game.\nThose who lost their noses were employed as isolated frontier\npickets, where no boys could jeer at them, and where they could\nbetter survive their misfortune in quiet resignation. Those\nbranded in the face were made gate-keepers, so that their\nlivelihood was perpetually marked out for them. It is sufficiently\nobvious why the castrated were specially charged with the duty of\nserving females in a menial capacity. One name for eunuch is\n\"cleanse man,” and it is explained by a very old commentator that\nthe duty of these functionaries was to sweep and cleanse the\ncourt; but it is perhaps as likely that the original idea was\nreally “purified man,” or man deprived of incentive to certain\nevils. It is often said disparagingly of the Chou dynasty that\nthey introduced the effeminate Persian custom of keeping eunuchs;\nbut the Chou family, which was in full career before Zoroaster\nexisted, is perhaps entitled to a much greater antiquity in\ncivilization than Persia–Cyrus himself was a contemporary of Lao-\ntsz and Confucius–and probably the castrated were only utilized\nas menials because they already were eunuchs by law, and were not\nmade eunuchs against the spirit of natural law simply in order\nthat their services as menials should be conveniently rendered.",
        "In 655 B.C. the Tsin ruler despatched a eunuch to try and\nassassinate his half-brother (the future Second Protector of\nChina) when in Tartar exile. When the Second Protector in 636 at\nlast came to his rights as ruler of Tsin, the same eunuch offered\nto commit an assassination in his interest; arguing, by way of\njustifying his previous attempt, that a servant’s duty was to\nserve his de facto master for the time being, and not to\nquestion de jure claims, which were a matter beyond the\ncompetence of a menial. In 548 the ruler of Ts’i was assassinated\nby a eunuch who would not even grant his master permission to\ncommit suicide decently in the ancestral hall; (see p. 62). A year\nlater, the succeeding ruler under urgent circumstances secured the\nservices of a eunuch as coachman. In contrast to these traitors,\nin 481 a faithful eunuch tries to save the ruler of Ts’i from\nassassination by one of the supplanting great families: this was\nthe case that so horrified Confucius that he died soon after, in\ndespair of ever seeing “divine right” regain the upper hand in\nChina. In 544 B.C. the ruler of Wei was assassinated by a eunuch\ndoor-keeper. In 537 the King of Ts’u conceived the idea of\ncastrating and cutting the feet off the two Tsin envoys for use as\na palace gate-keeper and for service in his harem; but he was\nprudently dissuaded by his chief counsellor from incurring the\nrisks consequent upon such an international outrage; (see p. 46).\nThree centuries later, in the year 239, the First August Emperor’s\n(real) father, for his own spying purposes, got a sham eunuch\nappointed to a post in the service of the ex-concubine made over,\nas explained in the last Chapter, to the First Emperor’s father;\nby the dowager-queen, as she then was, the supposed eunuch had\ntwo sons. When subsequently this dangerous person revolted, the\nFirst August Emperor’s own real eunuchs took part in opposing his\nmurderous designs.–It must be mentioned that this objectionable\nfather of the Emperor was himself a very distinguished man\nnotwithstanding, and has left a valuable historical and\nphilosophical work of twenty-six Chapters behind him, put together\nunder his direction by a number of clever writers. It is usually\nconsidered a Taoist work, because it savours in parts of Lao-tsz’s\ndoctrine; but, like the works of Hwai-nan-tsz (an imperial prince\nof the Han dynasty 150 years later) it was classified in 50 B. C.\nas a “miscellany.\"–Finally, a eunuch played an important part as\nwitness when the Second August Emperor was assassinated. Thus all\nthe states–those around the original nucleus of Old China at\nleast–employed eunuchs in the royal harems, even if the vassal\nprinces of orthodox China as a general rule did not.",
        "It is much the same thing with another disagreeable feature in the\nmanners of those times–human sacrifices. Many instances have\nalready been given of such practices in the state of Ts’in. The\ntomb of the King of Ts’u who died in 591–of that king whose death\nConfucius condescended to record, decently and in ritual terms,\nbecause of his many good qualities–which tomb appears to be still\nin existence near King-chou Fu, is surrounded by ten other smaller\ntombs, supposed so be those of the persons who “followed him to\nthe grave.” At all events, when in the year 529 a later king of\nTs’u hanged himself, a faithful follower buried two of his own\ndaughters with the royal body. In A. D. 312 the tomb of the first\nProtector, who died in 643 B.C., was opened under circumstances so\ngraphically described that there can scarcely be a doubt of the\nsubstantial truth: the stench was so great that dogs had to be\nsent in first to test the effects of the poisoned atmosphere; so\nmany bones were found lying about that there can be little doubt\nmany women and concubines were buried with him. It is often said\nby modern writers that it was a general custom to do so all over\nancient China, and possibly the fact that in the second century\nB.C. a humane Chinese emperor (of Taoist principles) ordered the\ndiscontinuance of the practice may be thought to give colour to\nthis supposition. But it must be remembered that the great house\nof Han had only then recently overthrown the dynasty of Ts’in, and\nhad incorporated nearly the whole of China as we now view it: the\nEmperor would naturally therefore be referring to Ts’i, Ts’in,\nTs’u, and possibly also to Wu and Yueeh, three of which states had,\nas we see, once practised this cruel custom.",
        "Wine, or rather spirit, was known everywhere; in Confucian times\nthe Far West had not yet been discovered, and there were neither\ngrapes nor any names for grapes; no grape wine, nor any other\nfruit wine. Even now, though the Peking grapes are as good as\nEnglish grapes, no one nearer than Shan Shi makes wine from them.\nSpirits seem to have been served from remote times at the imperial\nand princely feasts. Here, once more, as with the two vicious\npractices described, the drunkards appear to be found more among\nthose peoples surrounding orthodox China than in the ancient\nnucleus. In 694 B.C., when the ruler of Lu was on a visit to his\nbrother-in-law, the ruler of Ts’i, whose sister he had married,\nbrother and sister had incestuous intercourse; which being\ndetected, the ruler of Ts’i made his Lu brother-in-law drunk, and\nsuborned a powerful ruffian to squeeze his ribs as he was assisted\ninto his chariot. Thus the Duke Hwan of Lu perished. In 640 B.C.,\nas we have seen, when the future Second Protector was dallying\nwith his Ts’i wife, it was found by his henchman necessary to make\nhim drunk in order to get him away. In 574 a Ts’u general was\nfound drunk when sent for by his king to explain a defeat by Tsin\ntroops. In 560 the Ts’i envoy–the philosopher Yen-tsz–was\nentertained by the Ts’u court at a wine. In 531 the ruler of Ts’u\nfirst made drunk, and then killed, one of the petty rulers of\northodox China. In 537 it had already been explained to the King\nof Ts’u that on the occasions of the triennial visits of vassals\nto the Emperor (probably only theoretical visits at that date)\nwine was served at long tables in full cups, but was only drunk at\nthe proper ritualistic moment. Two years after that the King of\nTs’u was described as being at his wine, and therefore in the\nproper frame of mind to listen to representations.",
        "In 541 the Ts’u envoy was entertained at a punch d’honneur\nby the Tsin statesmen, one of whom seized the occasion to chant\none of the Odes warning people against drunkenness. It is well\nknown that Confucius enjoyed his dram; indeed, it is said of him:\n\"As to wine, he had no measure, but he did not fuddle himself.” In\nthe year 506 the ruler of Ts’in is described as being a heavy\ndrinker. In 489 a Ts’i councillor is described as being drunk. A\nfew years later the ruler of Ts’i and his wife are seen drinking\ntogether on the verandah, and some prisoners escape owing to the\ngaoler having been judiciously plied with drink.",
        "Meat seems to have been much more generally consumed in old China\n(by those who could afford it) than in modern times; and, as we\nmight expect, among the Tartar infected people, horse-flesh in\nparticular. In the second century B.C. the question of eating\nhorse-liver is compared by a witty Emperor with the danger of\nrevolutionary talk. He said: “We may like it, but it is\ndangerous.” (Last year, when in Neu Brandenburg, I came across a\nman whose brother was a horse-butcher in Pomerania, and,\nremembering this imperial remark, I asked about horse-liver. The\nman said he always had a feast of horse-liver when he visited his\nbrother, and that he much preferred it to cows’ liver, or to any\nother part of the horse; but, he added, “you must be careful about\neating it in summer.”) In 645 Duke Muh of Ts’in was rescued from\nthe Tsin troops by what was described to him as a body-guard of\nhorse-flesh eaters. It appeared, when he sought for explanation,\nthat the same Ts’in ruler had, some time before, been robbed of a\nhorse by some “wild men,” who proceeded to cut it up and eat it.\nThey were arrested; but the magnanimous duke said: “I am told\nhorse-flesh needs spirits to make it digest well,” and, instead of\npunishing them, he gave them a keg of liquor, adding: “no sage\nwould ever injure men on account of a mere beast.”, He had\nforgotten the circumstance, but it now transpired that these men\nhad, out of gratitude, since then enlisted as soldiers. This story\nis the more interesting as it proves how incompletely civilized\nthe neighbourhood of Ts’in then was.–Bears’ paws are often spoken\nof as a favourite dish. In 626 the King of Ts’u, about to be\nmurdered by his son and successor, said: “At least, let me have a\nbear’s paw supper before I die.” But it takes many hours to cook\nthis dish to a turn, and the son easily saw through the paternal\nmanoeuvre, pleaded only to gain time. It may be here mentioned,\ntoo, that Ts’u made regular use of elephants in battle, which\ncircumstance is another piece of testimony in favour of the\nAnnamese connection of Ts’u. In the Rites of Chou, supposed\nto be the work of the Duke of Chou, mention is made of ivory as\none of the products of the “Jungle province,” as then called. In\nmodern times Annam has regularly supplied the Peking Government\nwith elephants, the skin of which is eaten as a tonic. After the\nannihilation of Wu by Yiieh, the cunning Chinese adviser of Yiieh\ndecided to retire with his fortune to Ts’i, on the ground that the\n\"good sleuth-hound, when there is no more work for him, is apt to\nfind his way to the cooking-pot.” Dogs (fed up for the purpose)\nare still eaten in some parts of China, and (as we shall soon see)\nthey were eaten in ancient Yiieh.",
        "The question of the expedition of the Emperor Muh to the West in\nthe year 984 B.C., or during that year and the two following, is\nworthy of further consideration for many reasons; and after all\nthat has been said about the rise of the Chou dynasty, the decay\nof the patriarchal system, the emulous ambitions of the vassals,\nthe destruction of the feudal Empire, and the substitution of a\ncentralized administration under a new dynasty of numbered August\nEmperors, it will now be comparatively easier to understand.",
        "We have seen that, if any local annals besides those of Lu have\nbeen in part preserved, those of Ts’in at least were deliberately\nintended by the First August Emperor to be wholly preserved, and\nmust therefore hold first rank among all the restored vassal\nannals published by Sz-ma Ts’ien in or about 90 B.C.; and it must\nbe remembered that the original Lu annals have perished equally\nwith those of Ts’i, Sung, and other important states; it is only\nConfucius’ “Springs and Autumns,\"–evidently composed from the Lu\narchives,–that have survived. Well, the Ts’in Annals, as given by\nSz-ma Ts’ien, record that one of the early Ts’in ancestors “was in\nfavour with the Emperor Muh on account of his admirable skill in\nmanipulating horses” [names of four particularly fine horses\ngiven]. The Emperor “went west to examine his fiefs\"; he was so\n\"charmed with his experiences that he forgot the administrative\nduties which should have called him back.” Meanwhile, a revolt\nbroke out in East (uncivilized) China, and the manipulator of\nhorses was sent by the Emperor back to China at express speed, in\norder to stave off trouble till the Emperor could get back\nhimself. It is also stated of him that, in spite of remonstrances,\nhe made extensive war upon the Tartars, and that, in consequence,\nhis uncivilized vassals ceased to present themselves at court. No\nother mention is made of this expedition by Sz-ma Ts’ien in the\nimperial annals, and, so (apart from the fictitious importance\nafterwards given to the expedition, and especially by European\ninvestigators in quite recent times), there is really no reason to\nattach any more political weight to it than to the other\ninnumerable exploring expeditions of emperors into the almost\nunknown regions surrounding the nucleus of orthodox China so often\ndefined in these Chapters. We have already (page 184) cited the\ncase in which the father and predecessor of King Muh had ventured\non a tour of inspection as far as modern Hankow on the Yang-tsz\nRiver, or, as some say, as far as some place on the River Han,\nwhere he was murdered; in 656 the First Protector raked up this\naffair against Ts’u, whose capital was very near King-thou Fu,\nabove Hankow. Finally, scant though Sz-ma Ts’ien’s two references\nto this affair may be, they at least agree with each other, i.e.\nthe Emperor did actually go to Tartar regions, and a revolt of\nnon-Chinese tribes did actually break out in the immediate sequel.",
        "But in A.D. 281 a certain tomb at a place once belonging to Wei,\nbut later attached to the kingdom of Ngwei formerly part of Tsin,\nwas desecrated by thieves, and, amongst other books written in\nancient characters found therein (unfortunately all more or less\ninjured by the rummaging thieves), were two of paramount interest.\nOne was an account of, and was entirely devoted to, the Emperor\nMuh’s voyage to the West; the other was the Annals of Ngwei (i.e.\nof that third part of old Tsin which in 403 B.C. was formally\nrecognized by the Emperor as the separate state of Ngwei),\nincluding those of old Tsin, and also what may be termed the\ngeneral history of China, narrated incidentally. These Annals of\nTsin or Ngwei are usually styled the Bamboo Books, because they\nwere written in ink on bamboo tablets strung together at one end\nlike a fan or a narrow Venetian blind. They also speak shortly of\nthe Emperor Muh’s expedition, and thus they also are useful for\ncomparing hiatuses, names, faults, and dates; both in general\nhistory, and in the account of King Muh’s expedition. Since the\ndiscovery of these old documents (which had been buried for well-\nnigh 600 years, and of which no other record whatever had been\npreserved either in writing or by tradition), Chinese literary\nwonder-mongers have exercised their wits upon the task of\nidentifying the unheard-of places mentioned; the more so in that\none place, and one king bearing the same foreign name as the\nplace–Siwangmu–was so written phonetically that it might\nmean “Western-King-Mother.” They endeavoured to show how this and\nother places might have lain in relation to the genuine\nplaces discovered by Chinese generals after these ancient\ndocuments were buried, seven centuries after the events recorded\ntherein. Then came the foreigner with his Jewish Creation,\nConfusion of Tongues, Accadian and Babylonian origin of all\nscience, etc., etc. Of course Marco Polo’s adventures at once\nsuggested to the European, thus biased, that 3000 years ago the\nEmperor Muh might have found his way to Persia, and might\nhave been this or that Babylonian, Egyptian, or Persian hero; in fact,\nProfessor Forke of Berlin even takes his Chinese majesty as far as Africa,\nand introduces him to the Queen of Sheba (= Western-King-Mother).",
        "The distinguished Professor Edouard Chavannes of Paris has\nrecently attempted to show, not only that the Emperor Muh never\ngot beyond the Tarim (which, indeed, is absolutely certain from\nthe text itself), but that it was not the Emperor Muh at all who\nwent, but the semi-Turkish Duke Muh of Ts’in, in the seventh\ncentury B.C., who made the expedition.",
        "To begin with, let us see what the expedition purports to be. In\nthe first place, the thieves used as torches, or otherwise\ndestroyed, the first few pages of the bamboo sheaf book, and we do\nnot know, consequently, whence the Emperor started: there is much\nindirect evidence, however, to show that he started from some\nplace on the headwaters of the Han River, in what must then have\nbeen his own territory (South Shen Si); especially as his three\nexpeditions all ended there. It is certain, however, that he had\nnot travelled many days on his first journey before he reached a\ntribe of Tartars very frequently mentioned in all histories, and\nbearing the same name as the Tartars whom Sz-ma Ts’ien says the\nEmperor Muh did conquer. He crossed the Yellow River on the\n169th day, came to two rivers, the Redwater (222nd day), and the\nBlackwater (248th day), which rivers in after ages have been\nfrequently mentioned in connection with Tibetan, Turkish, and\nOuigour wars, and are apparently in the Si-ning and Kan-chou Fu,\nor possibly Kwa Chou regions (cf. p. 68); but first he passed,\nafter the 170th day, a place called “Piled Stones,” a name which\nhas never been lost to history, and which corresponds to Nien-po,\nbetween Lan-thou Fu and Si-ning, as marked on modern maps.\nIn other words, he went by the only high-road there was in existence,\nand ever since then has continued in existence (just traversed by Bruce),\nleading to the Lob Nor region; whence again he branched off,\npresumably to Turfan, or to Harashar; thence to Urumtsi, and possibly\nKuche, as they are respectively now called; but on the whole it is not\nlikely that he got beyond Harashar and Urumtsi. Even 800 years later,\nwhen the Chinese had thoroughly explored all the west up to the Hindu\nKush, their expeditions had all to proceed from Lob Nor to Khoten, or\nfrom Lob Nor (or near it) via Harashar and Kuche along the\nTarim Valley: it was not for long after the discovery of these routes that\nthe later Chinese discovered the northerly Hami route, and the possibility\nof avoiding Lob Nor altogether. His charioteer is said in this\naccount to have been a man (named) whose name is exactly the name,\nwritten in exactly the same way, as the name of the ancestor of\nTs’in, who, Sz-ma Ts’ien tells us, actually was the charioteer of\nthe Emperor when he marched forth against the Tartars, and who\nhurried back to China when the revolts broke out owing to the\nEmperor’s absence. As the Emperor received, from various princes,\npresents of wine, silk, and rice, it is almost certain that he\nmust have avoided bleak, out-of-the-way places, and have made for\nthe productive regions of Harashar, Turfan, and possibly Kuche,\nany or all three of these. With a little more care and patience we\nmay yet succeed in identifying, and by the same names, several\nmore of the places mentioned by the old chronicler. In about ten\nmonths (286 days from the first day already mentioned, and 17 days\nout from “Piled Stones”) he reached Siwangmu. This is not\nat all unlikely to be Urumtsi, or a place near it, possibly Ku-\nCH’ENg or Gutchen, because Siwangmu (also the name of the\nking of that place), gave him a feast on a certain lake, which\nlake, written in exactly the same way, became the name of a quite\nnew district in 653 A.D., when it was abolished; and that district\nwas at or near Urumtsi; the presumption being that, in the seventh\ncentury A.D., it was so named on account of old traditions, then\nwell known. Roughly speaking, it took the Emperor 300 days to go,\nand a second 300 to get back; stoppages, feasts, functions, all\nincluded. The total distance travelled, as specified from chief\nstation to chief station, is 13,300 li (say 4000 miles) to\nSiwangmu and to the hunting grounds near but beyond it.\nWhen 200 days out he came to the place where his feet were washed\nwith kumiss; this place is frequently mentioned in history; even\nConfucius names it, as one of the northernmost conquests of the\nChou dynasty. The only doubt is whether it is near Lan-thou Fu in\nKan Suh province, or near the northern bend of the Yellow River.\nThe journey back was hurried and shorter (as we might well suppose\nfrom Sz-ma Ts’ien’s accounts above given), that is to say, only\n10,000 li. But the total for the whole double journey of\n660 days in all, including all by-trips, excursions, and hunts,\nwas 38,000 li, or about 12,000 miles–say 20 miles a day. I\nhave myself travelled several thousand miles in China and Tartary,\nalways at the maximum rate of 30 miles a day; more usually 20,\nallowing for delays, bad roads, and accidents. In Dr. Legge’s\ntranslation of the “Book of Odes,” p. 281, there is a song about a\ngreat expedition against the Tartars in 827 B.C., one line of\nwhich is precisely, as translated by Dr. Legge: “and we marched\nthirty li every day,\"-which means only ten miles.",
        "This is the chief journey; and whether the Chou Emperor in 984\nB.C., or the Ts’in Duke in 650 B.C., made it, there are really no\ndifficulties, no contradictions. Four important places at least\nare named which are known by exactly the same names, and are\nfrequently mentioned, in very much later history. The Emperor had\nhundreds of carts or chariots with him, and we have seen that\nthese were a special feature of orthodox China. He came across a\nhuge moulting-ground of birds in the desert regions, and the later\nChinese very frequently speak of it in Tartar-land. Being caught\nin the waterless desert, he had to cut the throats of some of his\nbest horses and drink their warm blood: two friends of my own,\ntravelling through Siberia and Mongolia, were only too glad, when\nnearly starving from cold, to cut a sheep’s throat and drink its\nwarm blood from the newly-gashed throat itself. Fattening up\nhorses for food is mentioned, and washing the feet with kumiss–\nboth incidents purely Tartar. “Cattle,” distinct from horses and\noxen, are alluded to–probably camels, for which no Chinese word\nexisted until about the time of our era.",
        "The second and third journeys, which occupied another 600 days\nbetween them, both ended at, and therefore it is assumed began at,\nthe same place as the first journey’s terminus; that is, at a\nplace marked on modern maps as Pao-CH’ENg, on the Upper Han River.\nIn later times it belonged to the semi-Chinese kingdoms of Shuh\nand Ts’u in turn. One of these narratives is taken up with a\ndescription of the Emperor’s infatuation for a clever wizard from\na far country, and of his liaison with a girl bearing his own\nclan-name, who died about two months before he reached home, and\nwas buried on the road with great pomp. These two later journeys\nhave no geographical value at all; but as the Emperor in each case\nagain crossed the Yellow River, it is plain that he was amusing\nhimself somewhere along the main Tartar roads, as in the first\ncase.",
        "It may be added that the Taoist author Lieh-tsz, in his third\nChapter, repeats the story of the magician, who, he says, came\nfrom the “Extreme West Country.” He also explains that it was\nthrough listening to this man’s wonderful tales that the Emperor\n\"neglected state affairs, and abandoned himself to the delights of\ntravel,\"–thus anticipating by three centuries the language of Sz-\nma Ts’ien in 90 B.C. The story of the particular tribe of Tartars\n(named with the same sounds, but not with the same characters) who\nwashed the Emperor’s feet with kumiss is also told by Lieh-tsz.\nThe position of the Redwater River is defined, to which textual\nremarks the commentators add more about the River Blackwater.\nCuriously enough, in himself commenting upon the Emperor Muh’s\nconversations with the chieftain of Siwangmu, Lieh-tsz mentions\nthe traditional departure, west, of the philosopher Lao-tsz, his own\nmaster.",
        "Now, although there is considerable doubt as to the authorship,\ndate, and genuineness of Lieh-tsz’s book, which at any rate was\nwell known to Chinese bibliophiles long before our era, the fact\nthat it mentions and repeats even part of the Emperor Muh’s\ntravels 600 years before the ancient book describing those travels\nwas found, proves that the manipulators of the ancient book thus\nfound did not invent the whole story after our era. It also seems\nto prove that in Lieh-tsz’s time (i.e. immediately after\nConfucius) the story was already known (and probably the book of\ntravels too), Confucius himself having mentioned one of the tribes\nvisited by the Emperor. The Bamboo Books bring history down to 299\nB.C., and were found, together with the travels of the Emperor\nMuh, in A.D. 281. The Bamboo Books not only support part of the\nstory of the Emperor Muh’s travels, but their accuracy in dates\nhas been shown by Professor Chavannes to strengthen the\ncredibility of Confucius’ own history: a reference to Chapter\nXXXII. on the Calendar will explain what is meant by “accuracy in\ndates.” Finally, we have Sz-ma Ts’ien’s history of go B.C.,\nciting the Chou Annals and the Ts’in Annals, or what survived of\nthem after incessant wars between 400 and 200 B.C., and after the\ndestruction of literature in 213 B.C.",
        "This point settled, the next thing is to consider Professor\nChavannes’ reasons for supposing that Duke Muh of Ts’in (650 B.C.)\nand not the Emperor Muh of Chou (984 B.C.) was the real\ntraveller:–",
        "1. He shows that the ruling princes of Ts’in and Chao hailed from\nthe same ancestors, were contiguous states, and, besides being\nlargely Tartar themselves, ruled all the Tartars along the\n(present) Great Wall line: also that the naming of individual\nhorses and other features of the Emperor’s travels recalls\nfeatures equally prominent in later Turkish history. This is all\nundoubtedly true: compare page 206.",
        "2. He shows that the Duke Muh’s chief claim to glory was his\nsuccesses against the Tartars of the West. This is also quite\ncertain. 3. He thinks that in 984 B.C. the literary capacity of\nChina was not equal to the composition of such a sustained work as\nthe Travels.",
        "4. He also thinks that the real Chinese found in Ts’in the\ntraditions relating to Duke Muh, and then, for the glory of China,\nappropriated them to the Emperor Muh, and foisted them upon\northodox history.",
        "There is a great deal to be said for this view, which has,\nbesides, many other minor points of detail in its favour. But it\nmay be answered:–",
        "1. Chou itself was in the eyes of China proper, once a “barbarian\"\ntribe of the west, as the founder of the Chou dynasty in 1122 B.C.\nhimself showed when he addressed his neighbours and allies, the\neight other states of the west, and exhorted them, as equals, to\nassist him in the conquest of China. It was only in 771 B.C. that\nthe original Chou appanage (since 1122 the western half of the\nimperial appanage) had been ceded to Ts’in, which in 984 was a\npetty state, still of the “adjunct-function” (cf. page 144)\ntype, and not “sovereign.” In 984 there was no intermediate\nsovereign “power” between the Emperor and the Tartars, with whom,\nin fact, he had been directly engaged in war independently of\nTs’in. He was as much under Tartar social influences as was Ts’in:\nin fact, the Chou principality, under the Shang dynasty, was a\nsort of first edition of Ts’in principality under the Chou\ndynasty. Just as in 1122 B.C. Chou ousted Shang as the imperial\nhouse, so in 221 B.C. Ts’in definitely replaced Chou.",
        "2. If Duke Muh distinguished himself by Tartar conquests, so did\nthe Emperor Muh before him, and the authorities are all agreed on\nthis point.",
        "3. If in 984 B.C. the long-standing orthodox Chinese literary\ncapacity was unequal to this effort, how is it that semi-barbarous\nTs’in, the least literary of all the states (not only Chinese, but\nalso half-Chinese), into which state records had only been\nintroduced at all in 753 B.C., was able to compose such a book;\nor, if not to write the book, then to dictate so sustained and\nconnected a story? Besides, the Emperor Muh left several\ninscriptions carved on stone during the progress of his travels.",
        "4. The instances M. Chavannes cites of the tombs of Yue and Shun in\nSouth China, as being parallel instances of appropriation by\northodox Chinese of semi-Chinese traditions have already been put\nto quite another use above, as tending to show, on the contrary,\nthat those two Emperors either came from the south, or had\nancestral traditions in the south; (see pp. 138,191).",
        "5. Finally, about a third of the Travels is taken up with a\ndescription of the incestuous intrigue with Lady Ki, and of\nher sumptuous ritual funeral. Why should Duke Muh trouble himself\nabout the rites due to members of the Ki family, to which the\nEmperor belonged, but he himself did not? Why should the warlike\nDuke Muh (who had just then been recommended by an adviser (an ex-\nChinese, since become a Tartar) to adopt simple Tartar ways\ninstead of worrying himself with the Odes and the Book “as the\nChinese did”) waste his time in pomp and ritual? ( see p.\n180). Again, when, as the Travels tell us, various vassal rulers\nfrom orthodox China (even so far as Shan Tung in the extreme east)\narrived to pay their respects to the Emperor as their liege-lord,\nhow is it possible to suppose that these orthodox counts and\nbarons would come to pay court to a semi-barbarian count (for that\nwas all he was) like Duke Muh (as he is posthumously called), one\nof their equals, a man who took no part in the durbar affairs, and\nwho, on account of his human sacrifices, was not even thought fit\nto become an emergency Protector of China? What could the semi-\nTartar ruler of Ts’in have known of all these wearisome\nrefinements in pomp, mourning, and music? Once more, the place the\nEmperor started from and came back to, though part of his\nappanage in 984 B.C. and possessing an ancestral Chou temple, was\nnot part of the Ts’in dominions in 650 B.C., and never possessed a\nTs’in temple: if not independent, it was at that time a bone of\ncontention between Ts’in and Ts’u, and by no means a safe place\nfor equipping pleasure expeditions. Finally, if it is marvellous\nthat the Chou Annals of Sz-ma Ts’ien do not give full details of\nthe voyage, is it not at least equally marvellous that the Ts’in\nAnnals should not mention it in 650 B.C., when M. Chavannes\nsupposes it took place, whilst they do so mention it under 984\nB.C., when he thinks it did not take place? All accounts agree\nthat the ancestor of Ts’in (named) was there with the Emperor as\ncharioteer; he was, as we have seen, equally ancestor of Chao, and\nthe Chao Annals of Sz-ma Ts’ien say exactly what the Ts’in Annals\nsay.",
        "Hence we may gratefully accept Professor Chavannes’ most\nilluminating proofs, so far as they tend to show that the Travels\nof the Emperor Muh are genuine history for a tour no farther than\nthe middle Tarim Valley; but, so far as Duke Muh of Ts’in is\nconcerned, he must be eliminated from all consideration of the\nmatter, and we must ascribe the tour, as the Chinese do, to the\nEmperor Muh. Lastly, are there any proved instances of such\nradical tamperings with history by the Chinese annalists as M.\nChavannes suggests? I do not know of any; and such superficial\ntamperings as there are the Chinese critics always expose, coute\nque coute, even though Confucius himself be the tamperer.",
        "The development of China is not only elucidated by documents and\nevents probably antecedent to the strictly historical period, such\nas the supposed voyage of an Emperor to the Far West, but it is\nalso made easier to understand when we consider its possible\nindirect effects upon Japan. The barbarian kingdom of Wu does not\nreally appear in Chinese history at all, even by name, until the\nyear 585 B.C. It was found then that it had traditions of its own,\nand a line of kings extending back to the beginning of the Chou\ndynasty (1122 B.C.), and even farther beyond. In 585 B.C. the new\nKing, Shou-meng, hitherto an unknown and obscure vassal of Ts’u,\naltogether beyond the ken of orthodox China, felt quite strong\nenough, as we have seen in Chapter VII., to strike out an\nindependent line of his own. It is a singular thing that, when the\nJapanese set about constructing a nomenclature (on Chinese\nposthumous lines) for their newly discovered back history in the\neighth century A.D., they should have fixed upon exactly this year\n585 B.C. for the death of their supposed first Mikado Jimmu (i.e.\nShen-wu, the “divinely martial”). The next three Kings of\nWu, all of whom, like himself, bore dissyllabic and meaningless\nbarbarian names, were sons of Shou-meng, and a fourth son was the\ncultured Ki-chah, who visited orthodox China several times, both\nas a spy and in order to improve himself. Then follow two sons of\nthe last and first, respectively, of the said three brothers. The\nsecond of these royal cousins was killed in battle, and his son\nFu-ch’ai vowed a terrible, vengeance against Ts’u, whose capital\nhe subsequently took and sacked in 506 B.C. Now appears upon the\nscene his own vassal, Yiieh, and at first Wu gets the best of it\nin battle. Bloodthirsty wars follow between the two, full of\npicturesque and convincing detail, until at last the King of\nYiieh, in turn, has the King of Wu at his mercy; but he was,\nthough a barbarian, magnanimously disposed, and accordingly he\noffered Fu-ch’ai the island of Chusan (so well known to us on\naccount of our troops having occupied it in 1840) and three\nhundred married families to keep him company. But Fu-ch’ai was too\nproud to accept this Elba, the more especially so because he had\nit on his conscience that he had been acting throughout against\nthe earnest advice of his faithful minister (a Ts’u renegade),\nwhom he had put to death for his frankness. This adviser as he\nperished had cried out: “Don’t forget to pluck my eyes out and\nstick them on the east gate, so that I may witness the entry of\nthe Yiieh troops!” He therefore committed suicide, first veiling\nhis face because, as he said: “I have no face to offer my adviser\nwhen I meet him in the next world; if, on the other hand, the dead\nhave no knowledge, then it does not matter what I do.” After the\nbeginning of our Christian era, when the direct communication\nbetween Japan (overland via Corea) and China (also by sea\nto Wu) was first officially noticed by the historians, it was\nrecorded by the Chinese annalists that part of Fu-ch’ai’s personal\nfollowing had escaped in ships towards the east, and had founded a\nstate in Japan. But it must not be forgotten that then (473 B.C.)\northodox China had never yet heard of Japan in any form, though of\ncourse it is possible that the maritime states of Wu and Yiieh may\nhave had junk intercourse with many islands in the Pacific.",
        "We have already ventured upon a few remarks upon this subject in\nChapter XXIII., but so much is apt to be made out of slight\nhistorical materials-such, for instance, as the pleasure\nexpedition of a Chinese emperor in 984 B.C. to the Tarim Valley–\nthat it may be useful to suggest the true proportions, and the\nmodest possible bearing of this “Japanese” migration–assuming the\nslender record of it to be true; and the basis of truth is by no\nmeans a broad one; still less is it capable of sustaining a heavy\nsuperstructure.",
        "Any one visiting Japan will notice that there are several distinct\ntypes of men in that country, the squat and vulgar, the oval-faced\nand refined, and many variations of these two; just as, in\nEngland, we have the Norman, Saxon, Irish, and Scotch types of\nface, with many other nuances. It is also clear from the\nkitchen-midden and other prehistoric remains; from the presence,\neven now, in Japan of the bearded Ainus (a word meaning in their\nown language “men”); and from the numerous accounts of Ainu-\nJapanese wars in both Chinese and Japanese history, that there\nwere (as there still are) manners, and possibly yet other men, in\nancient Japan, both very different from the manners and appearance\nof the cultured and gifted race, viewed as a homogeneous whole, we\nare now so proud to have as our political allies. But that brings\nus no nearer a historical solution, It is a persistent way with\nall ethnologists to search out whence this or that race came. Of\ncourse all races move and mingle, and must always have moved and\nmingled, when by so doing they could better their circumstances of\nlife; but even if movement has taken place in Japan as it has\nelsewhere, there is no reason why, if comparatively uncivilized\nJapanese displaced Ainus, Ainus should not have, before that,\ndisplaced quite uncivilized Japanese; or, if other races came over\nthe seas to displace the people already there, the natives already\nthere should not have, later on, ejected these new-comers by sea\nroutes.",
        "In other words, it is quite futile (unless we can lay hands on\ndefinite objects, or definite facts recorded–even definite\ntraditions) to try and account for hypothetical movements in\nprehistoric times. We are totally ignorant of early Teutonic,\nHungarian, and Celtic movements-though, thanks solely to Chinese\nrecords, we are pretty certain, within defined limits, about early\nTurkish movements. How much more, then, must we be ignorant about\nthe Japanese movements? If “people” must have come from somewhere,\nwhence did these arrivals start, and why should they not go back;\nor why not meet other movers going to the place whence they\nthemselves started? If we are to accept the only historical\nrecords or quasi-records we possess at all, that is, the Chinese\nrecords, then we must accept them for what they are worth on the\nface of them, and neither add to nor mutilate them; imperfect\nthings that do exist are necessarily better than imaginary things\nthat might have existed in their place. A few hundred families at\nmost, we are told, escaped; and if it be true that they went\nintentionally to Japan, it is probable that the expert Wu sailors\n(none existed elsewhere in China) had already for long known the\nway thither, or to Quelpaert and Tsushima, which practically means\nto both Corea and Japan; in fact, if they sailed east from Ningpo,\nthere is no other place to knock up against, even if the special\nintention were not there. Everything tends to show that Fu-ch’ai,\nthough perhaps a barbarian in 473 B.C., was of orthodox if remote\npedigree dating from 1200 B.C., and that the ruling class of Wu\nwas very different from the “barbarians” by whom (as we are\nspecifically told) Wu was surrounded; the situation was like that\nof the Egyptians and Phoenicians, like Cecrops and Cadmus, amongst\nthe earliest barbarous Greeks. It amounts, then, to this, that,\njust as Chinese colonies and adventurers emerged under the stress\nof increased population, or under the impulses of curiosity,\ntyranny, and ambition, to found states in Ts’u, Ts’in, Tsin, Ts’i,\nLu, Wu, Yueeh, and other places round the central nucleus, so (they\nbeing the sole possessors of that magic POWER, “records”)\nother parties would from time to time sally forth either from the\nsame orthodox centre, or from the semi-orthodox places surrounding\nthat centre, to still remoter spots, such as, for instance, Corea,\nJapan, Formosa, Annam, Burma, Tibet, and Yiin Nan. Fu-ch’ai’s\nsurviving friends had indeed a very lively stimulus indeed-the\nfear of instant death-to drive them tumultuously over the seas;\nand doubtless, as they must have been perfectly harmless after\ntossing about hungry in open boats for weeks together, they would\nbe as welcome to the Japanese king, or to the petty chief or\nchiefs who received the waifs, as in our own times was the honest\nsailor Will Adams when he drifted friendless to Japan, and whose\nstatue now adorns a great Japanese city as that of a man who was,\nin a humble way, also a “civilizer” of Japan (600 A.D.).\nDoubtless, many Wu words, or Chinese words as then pronounced in\nWu, had already been brought over by fishermen; but here at last\nwas a great haul of (possibly) books and the way to interpret\nthem; at least there was a great haul of the best class of the Wu\nruling folk. It is true that the first Japanese envoys who came to\nChina made as much of their Wu “origin” as they could; firstly,\nbecause it probably paid them as traders to do so; secondly,\nbecause it necessarily gave them a respectable status in China;\nand, thirdly, because they were, in the first century of our era,\ngradually beginning to understand the mystic power of the Chinese\nwritten character, and they would therefore naturally take an\nintense interest in all records, rumours, traditions, and fables\nabout themselves, which they would embellish and “confirm\"\nwhenever it suited their interests to do so. Which of us does not\nbegin to furbish up his pedigree when he is made a peer of the\nrealm?",
        "As to the bulk of the Japanese race, be it mixed or unmixed, it is\nsurely in the main to be found now where it always was, or close\nby? It is no more depreciating to early Japan to give her a\ndynasty of Chinese adventurers, or perhaps to give her only\nhereditary Chinese advisers and scribes, than it is derogatory to\nthe states of Europe to possess dynasties which belong by their\norigin, as a general rule, to almost any place but the countries\nthey now govern as sovereigns. As to the ancient chiefs or kings\nof Japan, some of their genuine native names may have been\npreserved in the memories of men; whether they were or not, they\nwere, even without records, as “ancient” chiefs as the best\nrecorded chiefs of Egypt, Babylonia, or China; and it must be\nremembered that Egyptian and Babylonian records were non-existent\nto us for all practical purposes during many thousands of years,\nuntil we recently discovered how to read them: that is to say,\nwhat was once no history at all–the present condition of the\nprehistoric races of High Asia–suddenly becomes history when we\nfind the records and know how to read them.",
        "When, a few centuries later on, the Japanese had begun thoroughly\nto understand Chinese books, they decided to have an historical\noutfit of their own; they took what vague traditions they had,\nand, in the absence of any long-forgotten genuine records, or\nvisible remains having part of the effect of records, simply\nfitted on to their heroes, real or imaginary, the Chinese\nposthumous system, and a selection of the historical facts\nrecorded about the Chinese. Even the Emperor Muh in China was not\nso named until he died. If a man can be given a complimentary\ntitle three years after death (that was the Chinese rule at\nfirst), why not give it him 300 years after his death? The king or\nchief hitherto known, whether accurately or not, whether honestly\nor not, as X, had most certainly existed; that is, the tenth\ngreat-grandfather of the reigning prince; the ninth, eighth, and\nso on; must positively have been there at some remote period of\nthe past. By calling him Jimmu (a Chinese emperor had already been\nposthumously so called) he is none the less there than he was\nbefore he was called Jimmu, and his new title therefore does not\nmake him less of an entity than he was before. And so on with all\nthe other Japanese emperors who, in the eighth century A.D., were\nsimilarly provided with imaginary names. Possibly this is how the\nJapanese argued with themselves when they set about the task. The\nsituation is a curious one, and perhaps unique in the world; but\nit does not matter much (as suggested in Chapter XXXI.) so long as\nwe keep imagination separate from real evidence.",
        "We propose to say a few words now about peculiar customs which had\nvogue all over or in certain parts of China; of course some of\nthem may be traced back to the “Rites of Chou,” and to what is\nprescribed therein; but general administrative schemes representing\nin general terms things as they ought to be, or as the Chou federal\nand feudal oligarchy would have liked them to be, do not give us\nsuch a life-like picture of ancient China as specific accounts of\ndefinite events which really did happen. Take, for instance, the\npeculiar formalities connected with abject surrender.",
        "After a great defeat in 699 B.C., just when Ts’u was beginning to\nemerge from its narrow confines between the Han and Yang-tsz\nRivers, the defeated Ts’u generals had themselves bound in\nfetters, or with ropes, in order to await their king’s pleasure.\nIn 654, when Ts’u had one of the small orthodox states (in the Ho\nNan nucleus) at its mercy, the baron presented himself with his\nhands tied behind, a piece of jade in his mouth, followed by his\nsuite in mourning, carrying his coffin. It is evident that at this\ndate Ts’u was still “barbarous,” for the king had to ask what it\nall meant. It was explained to him that, when the Chou founder\nconquered China, and mutilated the last Shang dynasty emperor,\nthat emperor’s elder brother by an inferior mother had presented\nhimself before the founder half naked, with his hands tied behind\nhis back, his left hand leading a ram (or goat), and his right\ncarrying sedge for wrapping round the sacrificial victim; he was\nenfeoffed as Duke of Sung. In 537 the same thing happened to a\nlater King of Ts’u in connection with another petty principality,\nand the king had to be reminded of the 654 precedent. Thus there\nmust have been records of some kind in Ts’u at an early date. In\n645 B.C., when the ruler of Ts’in took prisoner his brother-in-\nlaw, the ruler of Tsin, and was seriously contemplating the\nannexation of Tsin, together with the duty of discharging Tsin\nsacrifices, his own sister, with bare feet, wearing mourning, and\nbound with a mourning belt, intercedes successfully for her\nhusband. In 597 B.C. the ruler of the important orthodox state of\nCheng went through the form of dragging along, with the upper part\nof his own body uncovered, a ram or goat into the presence of the\nKing of Ts’u. In 511, when the ruler of Lu had to fly the country\nand throw himself upon the generosity of Tsin, in order to escape\nfrom the dangerous machinations of the intriguing great families\nof Lu, the six Tsin statesmen (who were themselves at that moment,\nas heads of great private clans, gradually undermining their own\nprince’s rights) sent for the arch-intriguer, and called upon him\nto explain his conduct. At that time Lu was coquetting between its\ntwo powerful neighbours, Tsin and Ts’i. The conspirator duly\npresented himself before the Areopagus of Tsin grandees, barefoot\nand attired in common cloth (i.e. not of silk, but of hemp), in order\nto explain to them the circumstances of the duke’s exile: it is\ncharacteristic of the times, and also of the frankness of history, to\nfind it added that he succeeded in bribing the grandees to give an\nunjust decision. When the Kings of Yueeh and Wu were in turn at\neach other’s mercy, in 494 and 473 respectively, their envoys, in\noffering submission, in each case advanced to the conqueror “walking\non the knees,” with bust bared: this knee-walking suggests Annamese,\nSiamese, and possibly Japanese forms rather than Chinese. The Wu\nservants at dinner are said to have “waited” on their knees. The third\nand last August Emperor in 207 submitted to the conquering Han\ndynasty seated in an unadorned chariot, drawn by a white horse\n(with signs of mourning), carrying his seal-sash round his neck\n(figurative of hanging or strangling himself), and offered the seals of\nthe Son of Heaven to the Prince of Han.",
        "Something has already been said about the rules of succession in\nTs’u and Ts’in. When the Duke of Sung just mentioned died, in 1078\nB.C., he was succeeded by his younger brother because his own son\nwas dead; this was in accordance with the Shang dynasty’s ritual\nlaws. Even the Warrior King himself, founder of the Chou dynasty,\nwas not the eldest son of his father, the (posthumously) Civilian\nKing; the latter had set aside the elder of the two sons; and it\nwill be remembered that, several generations before that, two of\nthe royal Chou brothers had voluntarily retired to colonize the Wu\nJungle country, in order that their younger brother, father of the\nfuture Civilian King, might succeed to the then extremely limited\nvassal state of Chou. Later on, in 729, a Duke of Sung on his\ndeath-bed bequeathed the succession to his younger brother instead\nof to his own son, on the ground that the rule is, “son to father,\nyounger to elder brother\"–a “universal rule” approved by Mencius\nin later times. The younger brother in this case thrice refused\nthe kingly crown, but at last accepted, and Confucius in his\nhistory censures the act, which, it is considered, contributed to\nSung’s ultimate downfall. (It must be remembered that Confucius’\nancestors were themselves of royal Sung extraction.) In 652 the\nyounger brother by the superior spouse wished, at his father’s\ndeath-bed, to cede his right to the succession of Sung to his\nelder brother by an inferior wife; the dying father commended the\nspirit, but forbade the proposed sacrifice of prior right, and the\nelder therefore served the younger as counsellor. In 493 a Duke of\nSung, irritated on account of his eldest son having left the\ncountry, nominated a younger son as successor, and after his death\nhis wife confirmed by decree her late husband’s nomination; but\nthe younger brother firmly declined, on the ground that the rule\nof succession was a fixed one, and that he was unworthy to perform\nthe sacrifices to the gods of the land and grain. It is a curious\ncoincidence that the question of status in wives affects the\npresent rulers of both China and Japan. Though the dowager was\nEmpress-Mother, she always ceded the pas to the senior dowager,\nwho had no children. And as to the Mikado’s mother, who died last\nOctober, she was, it seems, never officially considered as an\nEmpress.",
        "In 817 B.C. the Emperor himself is censured by history for having,\n\"contrary to rule,” wished to set up as ruler of Lu a second son\nin preference to the elder son; he repeated the act in 796, as has\nalready been explained in Chapter XX., when a few other instances\nwere cited to illustrate the general rule in China. At this time\nthe waning power of the emperors still evidently flickered. In\n608, through the meddlesome political interference of Ts’i, a\nconcubine’s son succeeded to the Lu throne in preference to the\nlegitimate wife’s son; curiously enough, the legitimate wife was a\nTs’i princess. The result of this irregularity was that the “three\npowerful families” of Lu (themselves descendants of the ruling\nfamily) grew restless, and the state began to decline. On the\ndeath of a King of Ts’u in 516, it was proposed to put on the\nthrone, instead of the king’s young son, the king’s younger\nbrother by an inferior mother, on the ground that the mother of\nthe young son in question was the wife obtained from Ts’in by the\nking for marriage to his eldest son (who had since joined the\nking’s enemies), which young lady the king had subsequently\ndecided to marry himself. Even under this irregular and\ncomplicated family tangle, the proposed succession was disapproved\nby the counsellors, on the ground that irregular successions\ninvariably produced trouble in the state. In the year 450 B.C. the\nruler of Ts’i insisted, against advice, on the succession of a\nyounger son by a favourite concubine in preference to his elder\nsons by superior mothers, including the first and most dignified\nspouse. But here, again, the powerful families intervened; one of\nthe elder sons, who had fled to Lu, was brought back secretly in a\nsack; the wrongful successor was murdered, and the “powerful\nfamily” which took the lead in state affairs soon afterwards, to\nthe horror of Confucius, by intrigue and by further assassination,\nsecured the Ts’i throne for itself. It will thus be noticed that\nall the great states except Ts’in had their full share of\nsuccession troubles.",
        "There were several customs practised in warfare which are worthy\nof short notice. In 633 B.C. a Ts’u general, in the interests of\ndiscipline, flogged several military men, and “had the ears of\nothers pierced by arrows, according to military regulation.” In\n639 this same king had sent as a present to some princesses of\nother states, who had congratulated him on his victory over Sung,\n\"a pile of the enemy’s left ears.” As the historians express their\ndisgust at this indelicate act, it was presumably not an orthodox\npractice, at all events in this particular form. In 607 there were\ncaptured from Sung 450 war-chariots and 250 soldiers; the latter\nhad their left ears cut off; in this case the victors were CHENG\ntroops, acting under Ts’u’s orders, and it is presumed that CHENG\nofficers cut off the ears under Ts’u’s commands. A few years later\ntwo or three Ts’u generals were discussing what the ancients did\nwhen they challenged for a battle; it was decided that the best\n\"form” was to rush up to the entrenchments, cut off an enemy’s\nleft ear, carry him away in your chariot, and rush back to your\nown camp. As there is a special Chinese character or pictograph\nfor “ears cut off in battle,” it thus appears that to a certain\nextent even the orthodox Chinese practised the “scalping” art,\nwhich was doubtless intended to furnish easy proof of claims for\nreward based upon prowess; in fact, even in modern official\nChinese, a decapitated head is called a “head-step,” an expression\nevidently dating from the time when a step in rank was given for\neach head or group of heads taken.",
        "Rulers, whether the Emperor or vassals, faced south in the\nexercise of their sovereign powers. Thus, when the Duke of Chou,\nafter the death of his brother the Martial King, acted as Regent\npending the minority of the Martial King’s son, his own nephew, he\nfaced south; but he faced north once more when he resumed his\nstatus of subject. It has already been mentioned, in Chapter XX.,\nthat in 640 B.C. the state of Lu made the south gate of the Lu\ncapital the Law Gate, because it was by the south gates that all\nrulers’ commands emanated. In 546 a counsellor of Ts’u explained\nto the king how, since Tsin influence had predominated in the\northodox state of CHENG, this last had ceased to “face south\ntowards its former protector.” Thus, though the Emperor faces\nsouth towards the sun, and his subjects in turn face north in his\nhonour, those subjects face their other protector in whatever\ndirection he may lie, supposing the Emperor’s protection to be\ninadequate. It is evidently the same principle as “bowing towards\nthe east,” and “turning towards Mecca,” both of which formalities\nmust be modified according to place. In 315 B.C., when Yen (the\nPeking plain) had become one of the six independent kingdoms, a\nusurper (to whom the King of Yen had foolishly committed full\npowers) “turned south” to perform acts of sovereignty in the\nking’s name. In 700 B.C., in the orthodox state of Wei, we hear of\n\"princes of the left and right,” which is explained to mean “sons\nof mothers whose official place is left or right of the principal\nspouse.” Right used to be more honourable than left in China, but\nleft now takes precedence of right. Thus the provinces of Shan\nTung and Shan Si are also called “Left of the Mountains” and\n\"Right of the Mountains,” because the Emperor faces south.\nNotwithstanding, the ancient phraseology sometimes survives; for\ninstance, “stands right of him” means “is better than he is,” and\n\"to left him” means “to prove him wrong or worse.” All yamens\nin China face south; there are rare exceptions, usually owing to\nbuilding difficulties. Once, in the province of Kwei Chou, I was\nofficially invited by the mandarin to take my seat on his right instead of\non his left, because, as he explained, his yamen door did not\nface south, but west; and, he added, it was more honourable\nfor me, as an official guest,  to sit north, facing west, than to sit\nsouth, facing west. In Canton,  the Viceroy used out of courtesy to sit\nsouth, facing north, and  make his own interpreter sit north, facing south;\nthe consul sat east,  facing west, and the consul’s interpreter sat west,\nfacing east. But the consul could not have presumed to occupy the\nnorth seat thus given to an inferior on the principle of de minimis\nnon curat lex; nor was the Viceroy willing to assert his “command\"\nto a guest. In 436 the armies  of Yiieh marching north through Ho Nan\ncalled the Chinese places  lying to their west the “left” towns; but that\nwas perhaps because  Yiieh came marching from the south. In 221 B.C.,\nwhen for the first time South China to the sea became part of the imperial\ndominions, the Emperor’s territory was described as extending\nsouthward to the “north-facing houses.” Hong Kong and Canton are\njust on the tropical line; but the island of Hainan, and also\nTonquin, are actually in the tropics. Whether the houses there do\nreally face north–which I have never noticed–or whether the\nexpression is merely symbolical, I cannot say; but the idea is “to\nthe regions where, when the sun is on the tropic, you have to turn\nnorth to see him.”",
        "A point of honour in China was not to make war on an enemy who was\nin mourning, but this rule seems to have been honoured in the\nbreach as much as in the observance thereof. Two centuries before\nthe Chou dynasty came into power, an emperor of the Shang dynasty\ndistinguished himself by not speaking at all during the three\nyears he occupied the mourning hut near the grave. As we have\nseen, the first rulers of Lu (as a Chou fief) modified existing\ncustoms, and introduced the three years’ mourning rule there. In\nconnection with a Sung funeral in 651 B.C., it is explained that\nthe bier lay between the two front pillars, and not, as with the\nChou dynasty, on the top of the west side steps; it will be\nremembered that Sung represented the sacrifices of the extinct\nShang dynasty. That same year the future Second Protector (then a\nrefugee among the Tartars) declined to put in a claim to the Tsin\nsuccession against his brothers “because he had not been in\nmourning whilst a fugitive.” In 642 Sung and her allies made war\non Ts’i, which was then mourning for the First Protector; by a\njust Nemesis the Tartars came to the rescue and saved Ts’i. In\n627, after the Second Protector’s death, Ts’in declared war,\nwhilst Tsin was mourning, upon a petty orthodox principality\nbelonging to the same clan as Tsin and the Emperor, and belonging\nalso to the Tsin vassal system. This so enraged the new ruler of\nTsin that he dyed his white mourning clothes black, so as to\navenge the insult, and yet not to outrage the rites: moreover,\nwhite was unlucky in warfare: victorious over Ts’in, he then\nproceeded to mourn for his father, and ever after that black was\nadopted, by way of memento, as the national colour of Tsin. In 626\nand 622 the Emperor sent high officers to represent him at Lu\nfunerals, and to carry gems to place in deceased’s mouth, “to show\nthat he (the Emperor) had not the heart to leave the deceased\nunsupplied with food.” In 581 the ruler of Lu, being on a visit to\nTsin, was forcibly detained by Tsin, in order to swell the\nimportance of a Tsin ruler’s funeral. Lu (like the petty orthodox\nstates of Wei, Sung, CHENG, etc., further south) was nearly always\nunder the rival political constraint of either Ts’i, Tsin, or\nTs’u; and this factor must accordingly also be taken into account\nin explaining Confucius’ longing for the good old days of imperial\npredominance. In 572 Tsin attacked Cheng, though of the same clan\nas itself, whilst in mourning; but in 567 semi-barbarian Ts’u set\na good example to orthodox Tsin by withdrawing its troops out of\ndeference to a later official mourning then in force in Cheng: in\n564 the King of Ts’u withdrew his armies home altogether on\naccount of the mourning due to his own deceased mother. In 560\nbarbarian Wu attacked Ts’u whilst in mourning for the above king\n(the one who first conquered the Canton region for Ts’u); but,\nhere again, by a just Nemesis, Wu’s army was cut to pieces, and\nWu’s own ally, Tsin, censured her for having done such an improper\nthing. In 544 the prime minister of Tsin mourned for his Ts’u co-\nsignatory of the celebrated Peace Conference Treaty of 546; and\nthis graceful act is explained to be in accordance with the rites.\nIn 544 Ts’u herself was in mourning, and in accordance with the\nterms of the Peace Conference Treaty, under which the Tsin vassals\nand the Ts’u vassals were to pay their respects to Ts’u and Tsin\nrespectively–Ts’in and Ts’i, as great powers, being excused, or,\nrather, discreetly left alone–Ts’u put great pressure on Lu to\nsecure the personal presence of the Lu ruler at the Ts’u funeral.\nThe orthodox duke did not at all like this “truckling to a\nbarbarian\"; but one of his counsellors suggested behaving before\nthe corpse as he would behave to a vassal of his own: this was\ndone, and the unsophisticated Ts’u was none the wiser at the time,\nthough, later on, the king discovered the pious fraud. In 514 B.C.\nWu wished to attack Ts’u while, mourning, and the virtuous Ki-\nchah was promptly sent by Wu to sound Tsin about the facheuse\nsituation. At a Lu funeral in 509, it was explained that the\nnew duke could only mount the throne after the burial was over; it\nwas added “even the Son of Heaven’s commands do not run in Lu\nduring this critical period; a fortiori is the duke not\ncapable of transacting his own subjects’ business.” But long\nbefore this, when the First Protector died, in 643, his body lay\nfor sixty-seven days in the coffin unattended, whilst his five\nsons were wrangling about the succession; in fact, the worms were\nobserved crawling out of the coffin. These painful details have a\npowerful historical interest, for when (as mentioned on p. 209)\nhis tomb was opened nearly 1000 years later, dogs had to be sent\nin ahead to test the air, as the stench was so great. In 492 an\nunpopular prince of Wei was in Tsin, which state had an interest\nin placing him on the throne. There happened to be in Tsin at that\nmoment a scoundrel who had fled to Tsin from Lu, because he had\nfound Confucius too strong for him in Lu; and this man suggested\nto Tsin that it would be a good plan to send seventy Wei men back\nto Wei in mourning clothes and sash, so as to make the Wei people\nthink that the prince was dead, and thus gain an opportunity to\n\"run him in” by surprise, and set him up as ruler. In 489, when\nthe King of Ts’u died in the field of battle, his three brothers,\nall of whom had declined his offer of the throne, but one of whom\nhad at last accepted in order to give the dying man peace, decided\nto conceal the king’s death from the army whilst they sent for his\nson by a Yiieh mother, pleading that the king had been non\ncompos mentis when he proposed an irregular succession, and\nthat the promise made to him was, therefore, of no avail. In 485\nLu and Wu joined in an attack upon Ts’i during the latter’s\nmourning–a particularly disgraceful political combination: no\nwonder Confucius was hastily sent for from the state of CH’EN,\nwhither he had previously retired in disgust at the corruption of\nhis native land. In 481 a conspiracy which was going on in Ts’i\nwas delayed because one of the chief actors, being in mourning,\ncould not attend to public business of any kind. In 332 B.C. Ts’i\ntook ten towns from Yen by successfully attacking her whilst in\nmourning; one of the travelling diplomats and intriguers so common\nin China at that period insisted upon the towns being restored.\nThis was at the exact moment when the philosopher Mencius, who\nseems to have also been a great political dilettante, was\ncirculating to and fro between such monarchs as the Kings of Ts’i\nand Ngwei, alias Liang, as is fully explained in the still\nextant book of Mencius.",
        "All the above quaint instances, novel though they may be in\ndetail, strongly recall to us in principle our own “rules” of\ninternational law, which are always liable to unexpected\n\"construction” according to the exigencies of war and the power\nwielded by the “constructor.” Inter arma leges silent. As\nusual in these ritual matters, Ts’in is distinguished by total\nabsence of mention.",
        "So far as it is possible to judge from the concrete instances in\nwhich women are mentioned, it appears that in ancient Chinese\ntimes their confinement and seclusion was neither nominally nor\nactively so strict as it has been in later days, and they seem to\nhave been much more companionable to men than they have been ever\nsince the ridiculous foot-squeezing fashion came into vogue over a\nthousand years ago. When the Martial King addressed his semi-\nbarbarous western allies, as he prepared his march upon the last\nShang Emperor in 1122 B.C., he observed: “The ancient proverb says\nthe hen crows not in the morn; when she does, the house will\nfall\"–in allusion to the interference of the debauched Emperor’s\nfavourite concubine in public affairs; and we have seen, under the\nheading of Law in Chapter XX., how one of the imperial statutes,\nproclaimed or read regularly in the vassal kingdoms, prohibited\nthe meddling of women in public business. But, in spite of this,\nso far as promoting the succession rights and political interests\nof their own children goes, wives and concubines certainly exerted\nconsiderable influence, whether legitimate or not, in all the\nstates. The murder of an Emperor and flight of his successor in\n771 B.C. was in its inception owing to the intrigues of women\nabout Court. A few years only after that event, we find the\northodox ruler of Wei marrying a beautiful Ts’i princess (her\nbeauty is a matter of history, and is celebrated in the Odes,\nwhich are themselves a popular form of history); and then, because\nshe had no children, further marrying a princess of Ch’en. This\nprincess unfortunately lost her offspring; but her sister also\nenjoyed the prince’s favour, and her son was, after her death,\ngiven in adoption to the first childless Ts’i wife. This son\nsucceeded to the Wei throne, but was ultimately murdered by a\nyounger brother born of a concubine, who was next succeeded by\nstill another younger brother, whose queen had also been one of\nhis father’s concubines. Thus in the most orthodox states (Wei was\nof the imperial clan), the rites often seem not to have counted\nfor much in practice.–This book, it must here be repeated, deals\nwith specific recorded facts, and not with civilization as it\nought to have been under the Rites of Chou.–So, even in\ncomparatively modern China, 1500 years later, the third emperor of the\nT’ang dynasty married his father’s concubine, and she ultimately\nreigned as empress in her own right, which is in itself an outrage\nupon the “rites.”",
        "In 694 B.C. the ruler of Lu (also of the imperial clan) married a\nTs’i princess, who, as has been stated in Chapter XXXIV., not only\nhad incestuous relations with her brother of Ts’i, but led that\nbrother to procure the murder of her husband. In connection with\nthis woman’s further visit to Ts’i two years later, the rule is\ncited: “Women, when once married, should not recross the\nfrontier.” The same rule is quoted in 655 when a Lu princess, who\nhad married a petty mesne-vassal of Lu in 670, recrossed the Lu\nfrontier in order to visit her son in Lu.",
        "The Second Protector, during his wanderings, we know, married\nfirst a Tartar wife and then a Ts’i wife, both of whom showed\ndisinterested affection for him, and genuine regard for his rights\nto the Tsin succession, Yet the ruler of Ts’in supplied him with\nfive more royal girls, of whom one had already been married to the\nSecond Protector’s predecessor and nephew, the Marquess of Tsin.\nIt is but fair to the memory of this uxorious Tsin ruler to say\nthat he only took her over under protest, and under the immediate\nstress of political urgencies; he ultimately made her his\nprincipal spouse at the expressed desire of his ally the Ts’in\nruler. He must have later married a daughter of the Emperor too,\nfor, after the succession of a son and grandson, another of his\nsons named “Black Buttocks,” being the youngest, and also “son of\na Chou mother,” came to the throne. Thus in those troublous times\nthe honour of imperial princesses evidently did not count for very\nmuch at the great vassal courts. The readiness of Ts’in to induce\nthe Tsin ruler to take over his nephew’s wife (being a Ts’in\nprincess) accentuates the semi-Tartar civilization of Ts’in at\nleast, if not of Tsin too; for both Hiung-nu (200 B.C.) and Turks\n(A.D. 500) had a fixed rule that a Khan successor should take over\nall his predecessor’s women, with the single exception of his own\nnatural mother. In the year 630 the King of Ts’u married or\ncarried off two CHENG sisters (of the imperial clan). The ruler of\nCHENG had been insolent to the future Second Protector during his\nwanderings in the year 637, and, in order to avoid that\nProtector’s vengeance, had been subsequently obliged to throw\nhimself under Ts’u protection. “This ignoring of the rites by the\nKing of Ts’u will result in his failing to secure the Protectorship,” it\nwas said. However, these princesses, though of the imperial Ki\nclan by marriage into it, were really daughters  of a CHENG ruler by\ntwo separate Ts’i and Ts’u wives: moreover,  previous to the accession\nof the Hia dynasty (in 2205 B.C.), a Chinese elective Emperor had\nmarried the two daughters of his predecessor,  whose own son was\nunworthy to succeed: and, generally, apart from this precedent, the\nrule against marrying two sisters, even if it  existed, seems to have been\nloosely applied (cf. Chapter XXXIII.).",
        "In connection with the Cheng succession in 629, it is mentioned\nthat “the wife’s sons being all dead, X, being wisest of the\nsecondary wives’ or concubines’ sons, is most eligible\"\n(cf. Chapter XXXVII.).",
        "Great political complications arose in connection with a clever\nand beautiful princess of Cheng who had had various liaisons\nwith high personages in the state of Ch’en and elsewhere; in the end\nshe was carried off in 589 by a treacherous Ts’u statesman to Tsin;\nand indirectly this adventure led to his being charged by Tsin with a\nmission to Wu; to the subsequent entry of Wu into the conclave of\nfederal princes; and to the ultimate sacking of the Ts’u capital by\nthe King of Wu in 506: it is easy to read between the lines that\nthe Kings of Ts’u were considered unusually arbitrary and tyrannical\nrulers; over and over again we find that their most capable statesmen\ntook service with powers inimical to Ts’u. In 581 the ruler of Cheng,\nbeing forcibly detained in Tsin whilst on a political visit there, was\ntemporarily replaced in Cheng by his elder brother, born of an\ninferior wife.",
        "A marriage between the two states of Sung and Lu having been\narranged, the imperial clan states of Lu and Wei had certain\nduties to perform at the wedding, which took place in 583; and it\nis recorded that the latter sent “handmaids” The explanation given\nis a little involved, but it seems to throw some light on the\nmarriage of sisters question. It seems that the legitimate spouse\nand her “left and right handmaids” were each entitled to three\n\"cousins or younger sisters” of the same clan-name as themselves,\n\"thus making a total of nine girls, the idea being to broaden the\nbase of succession.” Not content with this, Lu sent a special\nenvoy to Sung the next year to “lecture” the princess. It is\nexplained that “women at home are under the power of their father;\nmarried, under that of their husbands.” Tsin also sent handmaids\nthis year. It is further explained that “handmaids are a trifling\nmatter, and they are only mentioned in this Lu princess case\nbecause her marriage turned out so badly.” The following year Ts’i\ndespatched handmaids, but, “being of a different clan-name, Ts’i\nwas not ritual in doing so.”",
        "The precise functions of these paranymphs, or under-studies of\nwives, together with the rules governing their selection, are\ndoubtless clearly enough described in the Rites of Chou;\nbut we are only dealing here with concrete facts as recorded.",
        "In 526 B.C., when Ts’in gave a princess in marriage to the Ts’u\nheir, the Ts’u king decided to keep her for himself (see p. 234).\nOnly a few years before that, Ts’u had given a princess of her own\nin marriage to the heir-apparent of one of the petty orthodox\nstates (imperial clan), and the reigning father had had improper\nrelations with her, which in the end led to his murder by his son;\nthus Ts’u, however delinquent, had already been given a bad\nexample by the imperial clan.",
        "After his humiliating defeat by the King of Wu in 494 B.C., the\nKing of Yiieh introduced a veritable Lex Julia into his\ndominions, in order to increase the population more quickly, and\nto prepare for his great revenge. Robust men were forbidden to\nmarry old women, and old men to marry robust women. Parents were\npunished if girls were not married by the time they were\nseventeen, and if boys were not married by twenty. Enceinte\nwomen had to be placed under the care of public midwives. For\nevery boy born, a royal bounty of two pots of wine and a dog were\ngiven: for every girl born, two pots of wine and a sucking-pig;–\nthe dog, it is explained, being figurative of outdoor, the pig of\ninternal economy. Triplets were to be suckled at the public\nexpense; twins to be fed, when big enough, at the public expense.\nThe chief wife’s son must be mourned, with absence from official\nduty, for three years; other sons for two; and both kinds of son\nwere to be equally buried with weeping and wailing. Orphans, and\nthe sons of sick or poor widows, were to receive official\nemployment. Distinguished sons were to have their apartments\ncleansed for them, and had to be well fed and handsomely clothed.\nLearned men from other states were to be officially welcomed in\nthe ancestral temple. With reference to this curious law, which is\ntotally un-Chinese in its startling originality, it may be\nmentioned that it seems to have gradually led to that laxity of\nmorals in ancient Yiieh which is still proverbial in those parts;\nfor, when the First August Emperor was touring over his new empire\nin 212 B.C., he left an inscription (still on record) at the old\nYiieh capital, denouncing the “pig-like adultery” of the region,\nand, more especially, the remarrying of widows already in\npossession of children. Only a few years ago, proclamations\nappeared in this region denouncing the pernicious custom of\nforcing widows to remarry. Although Kwan-tsz is supposed to have\n\"invented” the Babylonian woman for Ts’i, nothing is said in any\nancient Chinese history about common prostitution; nor is female\ninfanticide ever mentioned. In 502 B.C. the Lu revolutionary,\nalready mentioned in Chapter XXXVII., who was driven to Tsin by\nConfucius’ astute measures, had, before leaving Lu, formed a plot\nto murder all the sons, by wives, of the three “powerful families\"\nwho were intriguing against the ducal rights, and to put concubine\nsons-being creatures of his own-in their place; thus the\nsuccession principles applied not only to ruling families, but\nalso to private houses; though, as a matter of fact, these three\nwere all, in their origin, descended from previous ruling dukes.\nAs explained in Chapters XII. and XXXIII., after five generations\na fresh “family” is supposed to spring out of the common clan.",
        "In spite of Wu’s barbarism, the fact of its belonging, by remote\norigin, to the imperial clan (through its first: ruler having\nmagnanimously migrated from Chou before Chou conquered China in\n1122), made it technically incest for Lu to intermarry with Wu;\nthus, when in 482 B.C., a Wu princess (evidently forced for\npolitical purposes upon Lu) died, her husband, the ruler of Lu,\nwas obliged to refrain from a public burial, as has been explained\nin Chapter XXXIII. on Names.",
        "It will have been noticed that, even in strictly historical times\nsubsequent to 842 B.C., orthodox China was, mutatis mutandis,\nlike orthodox Greece, a petty territory surrounded by a fringe of\nlittle-known regions, such as Macedonia, Asia Minor, Phoenicia,\nEgypt, and Italy; not to say distant Marseilles, and the Pillars of\nHercules-all places at best very little visited except by navigators,\nand even then only by a few specially enterprising navigators or\ndesperate adventurers; though later on Greek influence and Greek\ncolonies soon began to replace the Phoenician, and to exhibit surrounding\ncountries in a more correct and definite light.",
        "As touches the surrounding regions of ancient China, and the\nknowledge of it possessed by the orthodox nucleus, such traditions\nas there are all point to acquaintance with the south and east\nrather than with the north and west. Persons who are persistently\nbent on bringing the earliest Chinese from the Tower of Babel by\nway of the Tarim Valley, are eager to seize upon the faintest\ntradition, or what seems to them an apparent tradition, in support\nof these preconceived views; ignoring the obviously just argument\nthat, if we are to pay any attention to mere traditions at all, we\nmust in common fairness give priority in value to such traditions\nas there are, rather than such traditions as are not, but only as\nmight be. For instance, there was a Chinese tradition that the\nfounder of the Hia dynasty (2205 B.C.) was, in a sense, somehow\nconnected with the barbarous kingdom of Yiieh, inasmuch as the\ngreat-great-grandson of the founder of the Hia empire a century\nlater enfeoffed a son by a concubine in that remote region. The\nearliest Chinese mention of Japan is that it lay to the east of\nYiieh, and that the Japanese used to come and trade with Yiieh. If\nthe Japanese traditions, on the other hand, as first put into\nindependent writing in the eighth century A.D., are worth\nanything, then the Japanese pretend that their ancestors were\npresent at a durbar held by the above-mentioned great-great-\ngrandson of the Hia founder; and they also firmly derive their\nruling houses (both king and princes) from the kingdom of Wu. We\nhave seen in former Chapters that both Wu and Yiieh, the most\nancient capitals of which were within 200 miles of each other,\nspoke one language, and that both were derived (i.e., the\nadministrative caste was derived) from two separate Chinese\nimperial dynasties. Now, the founder of the Hia dynasty is\ncelebrated above all things for his travels in, and his geography\nof China, usually called the “Tribute of Yii” (his name),–a still\nexisting work, the real origin of which may be obscure, but which\nhas come down to us in the Book (of History). This geography is\nnot only accurate, but it even now throws great light upon the\noriginal direction of river-courses which have since changed; in\nthis work there is not the faintest tradition or indirect mention\nof any Chinese having ever migrated into China from the west.",
        "There is no foundation, however, for the supposition, favoured by\nsome European writers, that the Nine Tripods (frequently mentioned\nabove) contained upon their surface “maps” of the empire; they\nmerely contained a summary, or a collection of pictures,\nsymbolizing the various tribute nations. On the other hand, there\nis no trace in the “Tribute of Yii” of any knowledge of China\nsouth of the Yarig-tsz River, south of its mouths, and south of\nits connection with the lakes of Hu Nan. The “province” of Yang\nChou is vaguely said to extend from the Hwai River “south to the\nsea.” The “Blackwater” is the only river mentioned which exhibits\nany knowledge of the west (i.e. of the west half of modern Kan Suh\nprovince), and this “Blackwater” was crossed in 984 B.C. by the\nEmperor Muh.",
        "Then there is the tradition of Vii’s predecessor, the Emperor\nShun, who, as mentioned in the last Chapter, married the two\ndaughters of the Emperor Yao, and is buried at a point just south\nof the Lake Tung-t’ing, in the modern province of Hu Nan: it is\ncertain that in 219 B.C., when the First August Emperor was on\ntour, the mountain where the grave lay was pointed out to him at a\ndistance, if he did not actually go up to it. Again, the\ngrandfather of the Warrior King who founded the Chou dynasty in\n1122 B.C. was, as already repeatedly pointed out, only a younger\nbrother, his two elder brothers having migrated to the Jungle,\nand, proceeding thence eastward, founded a colony in Wu (half-way\nbetween Nanking and Shanghai). Both Wu and Yiieh, for very many\ncenturies after that, were extremely petty states of only 50 or 60\nmiles in extent, and for all practical purposes of history may be\nconsidered to have been one and the same region, to wit, the flat,\ncanal-cut territory through which the much-disputed Shanghai-\nHangchow railway is to run. After the death of the Martial King,\nwhen his brother the Duke of Chou was Regent for his son, the duke\nincurred the suspicion of other brethren and relatives as to his\nmotives, and had to retire for some time to Ts’u, or, as it was\nthen called, the Jungle country, for two years. There is a\ntradition that a mission from one of the southern Yiieh states\nfound its way to the Duke of Chou, who is supposed to have fitted\nup for the envoys a cart with a compass attached to it, in order\nto keep the cart’s head steadily south. This tradition, which only\nappears as a tradition in one of the dynastic histories of\nthe fifth century A. D., is not given at all in the earlier\nstandard history, and it is by no means proved that the\nundoubtedly early Chinese knowledge of the loadstone extended to\nthe making of compasses. Yet, as Renan has justly pointed out in\neffect, in his masterly evidences of Gospel truth, a weak\ntradition is better worth considering than no tradition at all.\nBesides, there is some slight indirect confirmation of this, for\nin 880 B.C. or thereabout, a King of Ts’u gave one of his younger\nsons a Yiieh kingdom bearing almost the same double name as that\nYueeh kingdom from which the envoys in 1080 B.C. came to the Duke\nof Chou; in each case the first part of the double name was Yiieh,\nand the second part only differed slightly. Again, in or about\n820, some of the sons of the king exiled themselves to a place\nvaguely defined as “somewhere south of the Han River,” which can\nscarcely mean anything other than “the country of the Shan or\nSiamese races,” who lived then in and around Yiin Nan, and some of\nwhom are still known by the vague name used as here in 820 B.C.\nThe vagueness of habitat simply means that all south of the Han\nand Yang-tsz was terra incognita to China proper. There is\nanother tradition, unsupported by standard history, to the effect\nthat the Martial King enfeoffed a faithful minister of the emperor\nand dynasty he had just supplanted as a vassal in Corea. Here,\nagain, if the emperor’s own grandfather, or grand-uncles and\ntrusted friends, could find their way to Wu, and, later, to Japan,\nnot to mention Shan Tung and the Peking plain, it is reasonable to\npermit a respected adherent of the dethroned monarch to find his\nway to Corea, the more in that the centre of administrative\ngravity of Corea was then Liao Tung and South Manchuria–at the\nutmost the north part of modern Corea–rather than the Corean\npeninsula.",
        "In the year 649 the First Protector began to boast of having done\nas much as any of the’ three dynasties, Hia, Shang, and Chou,\nduring the 1500 years before him; he then defines the area of his\nglory, which is circumscribed by (at the very utmost) the west\npart of Shan Si, the south part of Ho Nan, the north part of the\nPeking plain, and the Gulf of “Pechelee.” The Second Protector,\nwhen he safely reached his ancestral throne after nineteen years\nof wanderings as Pretender, said to his faithful Tartar henchman\nand father-in-law: “I have made the tour of the whole world (or\nwhole empire) with you.” As a matter of fact, he had been with the\nTartars, certainly in central, and possibly also in northern Shan\nSi; in Ts’i, which means the northern part of Shan Tung and\nsouthern part of Chih Li; thence across the four small orthodox\nstates of Sung, Wei, Ts’ao, and CHENG (which simply means up the\nYellow River valley into Ho Nan), to Ts’u; and thence Ts’in\nfetched him to put him on the Tsin throne. The Emperor was already\nan obscure figure-head beneath all political notice, and no other\nparts of what we now call China were known to the Protector, even\nby name. As we shall see in a later Chapter, Confucius covered the\nsame ground, except that he never went to Tsin or to Tartarland.\nThe first bare mention of Yiieh is in 670 B.C., when the new King\nof Ts’u, who had assassinated his elder brother, and who therefore\nwished to make amends for this crime and for his father’s rude\nconquests, and to consolidate his position by putting himself on\ngood behaviour to federal China, made dutiful advances to Lu and\nto the Emperor (these two minor powers then best representing the\nold ritual civilization). The Emperor replied: “Go on conquering\nthe barbarians and Yiieh, but let the Hia (i.e. orthodox Chinese)\nstates alone.” In 601 Ts’u and Wu came to a friendly understanding\nabout their mutual frontiers, and Yiieh was also admitted to the\nconclave or entente; but this was a local act, and had nothing\nwhatever to do with China proper, which first hears of Yiieh as an\nindependent or semi-independent power in 536, when the King\nof Ts’u, with a string of conquered orthodox Chinese princes\nin train as his allies, and also a Yiieh contingent, makes war on\nWu. In later days there is evidence showing that there was not\nmuch general knowledge of China as a whole, and that interstate\nintercourse was chiefly confined to next-door neighbours. For\ninstance, when Tsin boldly marched an army upon Ts’i in 589 B.C.,\nit was considered a remarkable thing that Tsin chariots should\nactually gaze upon the sea. In 560, when the Ts’i minister and\nphilosopher, Yen-tsz, was in Ts’u as envoy, and the Ts’u courtiers\nwere playing tricks upon him (as previously narrated in Chapter\nIX.) he said: “I have heard it stated that when once you get south\nof the Hwai River the oranges are good. In the same way, we\nnortherners produce but sorry rogues; the genuine article reaches\nits perfection in Ts’u.” Thus, even at this date, the Yang-tsz was\nregarded much as the Romans of the Empire regarded the Danube–as\na sort of vague barrier between civis and barbarus. In\nno sense was the Ts’u capital–at no time were the bulk of the\nTs’u dominions–south of that Great River; nor, in fact, were the\ncapitals of Wu and Yiieh south of it either, for one of the three\nmouths (the northernmost was as now), corresponded to the Soochow\nCreek and the Wusung River, as they pass through the Shanghai\nsettlement of to-day; whilst the other ancient mouth entered the\nsea at modern Hangchow. We have given various other evidence above\nto show that, even earlier than this, the Yang-tsz was an\nunexplored region, known, and that only imperfectly and locally,\nto the Ts’u government alone. In the year 656 B.C. the First\nProtector called Ts’u to book because, in 1003 B.C., the Emperor\nhad made a tour to the Great River and had never returned (see\nChapter XX-XV.). Again, when the imperial power collapsed in 771\nB.C., the first Earl of CHENG (a relative of the Emperor)\nconsulted the imperial astrologer as to where he had better\nestablish his new fief: his own idea was to settle southwards on\nthe borders of the Yang-tsz; but he was dissuaded from this step\non the ground that the Ts’u power would grow accordingly as the\nChou power declined, and thus CHENG would all the easier fall a\nprey to Ts’u in the future if she migrated now so far south. The\nastrologer makes another observation which supports the view that\nTs’u and orthodox China were originally of the same prehistoric\nstock. He says: “When the remote ancestor of Ts’u did good service\nto the Emperor (2400 B.C.), his renown was great, yet his\ndescendants never became so flourishing as those of the Chou\nfamily.” In 597 B.C., when the Earl of CHENG really was at the\nmercy of Ts’u, he said: “If you choose to send me south of the\nYang-tsz towards the South Sea, I shall not have the right to\nobject\"; meaning, “no exile, however remote, is too severe for my\ndeserts.” In 549, when the Tsin generals were marching against\nTs’u, they were particularly anxious to find good CHENG guides who\nknew the routes well. Finally, in 541, a Tsin statesman made the\nfollowing observations to a prince (afterwards king) of Ts’u, who\nwas then on a mission to Tsin, by way of illustrating for his\nvisitor the conquests and distant expeditions of ancient times:–",
        "“The Emperor Shun (who married Yao’s two daughters, and employed\nthe founder of the Hia dynasty as his minister) was obliged to\nimprison the prince of the Three Miao (in Hu Nan; the savages of\nHu Nan and Kwei Chou provinces are still called Miao); the\nHia dynasty had to deal with quarrels in (modern) Shan Tung and\nShen Si; the Shang dynasty had to do the same in (modern) Kiang\nSu; the early Chou monarchs the same in (modern) North Kiang Su\nand South Shan Tung: but, now that there are no able emperors, all\nthe vassals are at loggerheads. Wu and P’uh (the supposed Shan or\nSiamese region above referred to) are giving you trouble; but it\nis no one’s concern but yours.”",
        "From all this it is quite plain, though the Chinese historians and\nphilosophers never seem to have discerned it clearly themselves,\nthat the cultivated or orthodox Chinese, that is, the group of\nclosely related monosyllabic and tonic tribes which alone\npossessed the art of writing, and thus inevitably took the lead\nand gradually civilized the rest, covered but a very small area of\nground even at the time of Confucius’ death in 479 B.C., and were\ncompletely ignorant of everything but the bare names of all the\nregions surrounding this orthodox nucleus, which nucleus was\ntherefore rightly called the “Central State,” as China is, by\nextension, now still called.",

        "The Chinese, with the single exception of their Great Wall, have\nalways been flimsy builders, and there is accordingly very little\nleft in the way of monuments to prove the antiquity of their\ncivilization. Mention has already been made of the tombs of the\nEmperors Shun and Yii (2200 B.C.). The tomb of another Hia dynasty\nemperor (1837 B.C.) lay twenty miles north of Yung-ning in Ho\nNan,’ where Ts’in, in 627 B.C., was annihilated by Tsin (see p.\n30). The tomb (long. 115o, lat. 33o) of the King of Ts’u who died\nin 689 B.C. was pillaged about 500 years later, but landslips\ndefeated the thieves’ objects. The First Protector’s tomb, seven\nmiles south of his capital in Shan Tung–the town still marked on\nthe maps as Lin-tsz–was desecrated in A.D. 312. A small pond of\nmercury was found inside, besides arms, valuables, and the bones\nof those buried with him. The palace of the Ts’u king of 617\nB.C.,–son of the one whose death that year was respectfully\nchronicled by Confucius–is still the yam&. or protorium of\nthe district magistrate at King-thou Fu, and can perhaps even yet\nbe seen from any passing steamers that circulate above the treaty-\nport of Sha-shf. There is a doubt about the date of this king’s\ntomb (d. 593); some place it near the palace, others over 100\nmiles north, near the modern city of Siang-yang. It is possible\nthat, after the sacking of the capital by Wu, in 506, the bodies\nof former kings were at once removed to the new temporary capital\n(far to the north) to which the old name was given. For instance,\nit is certain that the king who died in 545 was buried quite close\nto the capital (King-thou Fu). Ki-chah’s tomb, with Confucius’\ninscription upon it in ancient character, is still shown at a\nplace ten miles west of Kiang-yin (where the modern forts are,\nbelow Nanking) and twenty miles east of Ch’ang-chou; probably the\nnew “British” railway passes quite close to the place, as do the\nsteamers: for the past 400 years sacrifices have been annually\noffered to Ki-chah’s memory: as Confucius never visited Wu, the\ninscription, if genuine, must have been sent thither. The tomb of\nKi-chah’s nephew, King of Wu, is still to be seen outside one of\nthe gates of Soochow; or, rather, the temple built on the site is\nthere, for the tomb itself was desecrated and pillaged by the\narmies of Yueh, when they sacked the capital in 482. There was,\noriginally, a triple copper coffin, a small pond, and some water\nbirds made of gold (probably symbolic of sport), arms, valuables,\netc.; but nothing is said of human beings having been sacrificed.\nIt was said (2000 years ago) that elephants had been employed in\ncarrying the earth and building materials for this tomb. In 506\nthe vengeful Ts’u officer who had fled to Wu, and had incited the\nKing of Wu to do all he could to ruin Ts’u, actually opened the\nroyal grave, in or near the capital, and flogged the corpse of the\ndead king who had so grievously offended him and his family.",
        "In the year 501 the original bow and sceptre given by the warrior\nking to his brother, the Duke of Chou, founder of the State of Lu,\nwas stolen from its resting-place, but was luckily recovered the\nfollowing year. Incidentally this statement is of value; for when\nthe King of Ts’u, as narrated above, was making his demands upon\nthe Emperor, one of his grievances was that he possessed no relics\nof the founder such as the presents which had been made by him to\nTs’i, Lu, Yen, Tsin, and other favoured states of no greater\nstatus than his own. The above are only a few instances out of\nmany which show how, from age to age, the Chinese have seen with\ntheir own eyes things which in the vista of the distance now seem\nto us uncertain and incredible. As usual, Ts’in gives us nothing\nin the way of antiquity; another proof that, until she conceived\nthe idea of conquering China, she was totally unknown (internally)\nto orthodox China. Confucius’ own house, temple, grave, and park\nform an absolutely unbroken link with the past. There are remains\nand the relics of the Duke of Chou in the immediate neighbourhood,\nand it must not be forgotten that the Duke of Chou and his ritual\nsystem were Confucius’ models: as Confucius insisted, “I am only a\ntransmitter of antiquity.” Moderns, and especially foreigners,\nhave forgotten or reck nothing about the Duke of Chou; yet his\nremains and temples were just as much a matter of visible history\nto Confucius as Confucius’ grounds are to us. Each successive\ngeneration in China alludes to existing antiquities, or to\ncontemporaneous objects which have since become antiquities, with\nthe quiet confidence of those who actually possess, and who doubt\nnot of their possessions. The very lacunae are pointed out\nby themselves–no scepticism of ours is required; for whenever any\nhistorian, or any less formal writer, has outstepped the bounds of\ntruth or probability, the critics are immediately there, and they\nalways frankly say what they believe. In a word, the Chinese\ndocuments, be they iron, stone, wood, silk, paper, buildings, or\ngraves; and their traditions, are the sole evidence we possess:\nChinese critics were the sole critics of that evidence; and they\nare the sole light by which we foreigners can become critics. The\ngreat Chinese defect in criticism is the failure to work out\ngeneral principles, and to criticize constructively as well as\nanalytically. Their history is a rule of thumb, hand to mouth,\ndiary sort of arrangement, like a vast museum of genuine but\nunclassified and unticketed objects. But there is no good reason\nwhatever for our doubting the genuineness of either traditions or\ndocuments beyond the point of scepticism to which native Chinese\ndoubts go, for it must be remembered that no foreigner possesses\none tenth of the mass of Chinese learning that the professional\nliteratus easily assimilates. All we can do is to re-group, and\nextract principles.",
        "It is important to insist on the very close relations that existed\nbetween the Chinese and the Tartars from the very earliest times.\nAll that we are told for certain is that they were north and west\nof the older dynasties, and especially in occupation of the Upper\nWei River, on the lower part of which the old metropolis of Si-\nngan Fu lies; which means that they were exactly where we find\nthem in Confucian times, and where we find them now, except that\nthey have been pushed a little further back, and that Chinese\ncolonists have appropriated most of the oases. The Chou ancestor\nwho died in 1231, i.e. the father of the founders of Wu,\nand the great-grandfather of the founder of the Chou dynasty\n(1122), had to abandon to the encroaching Tartars his appanage on\nthe Upper King River (a northern tributary of the Wei, which runs\nalmost parallel with it, and joins it at Si-ngan Fu), and was\nobliged to move southwards to the Upper Wei River. For nearly 1000\nyears previous to this, his ancestors, who had originally been\nforced to fly to the Tartars in order to avoid the misgovernment\nof the third Hia emperor, had lived among and had, whilst\ncontinuing the Chinese art of cultivating, partly become Tartars;\nfor in 1231 B.C. the migrating host is said to have renounced\nTartar manners, and to have devoted themselves seriously to\nbuilding and cultivating; from which it necessarily follows that\nTartar manners must for some time have been definitely adopted by\nthe Chou family. The grandson of the migrator, the father of the\nChou founder, had various little wars with a tribe called the Dog\nTartars. Over 1000 years after that first flight to Tartardom, we\nhave seen that the Emperor Muh, great-grandson of the Chou\nfounder, not only had brushes with the Tartars, but extended his\ntours amongst them to the Lower Tarim Valley, Turfan, Harashar,\nand possibly even as far as Urumtsi and Kuche; but certainly no\nfarther. Two hundred years later, again, the then ruling Emperor\nwas defeated by the Tartars in (modern) Central Shan Si province,\nand the descendant in the sixth generation of the Ts’in Jehu who\nhad conducted the Emperor Muh’s chariot into Tartarland, only just\nsucceeded in saving the Emperor’s life; but this family of Chao,\nwhich was thus (cf. p. 206) of one and the same descent\nwith the Ts’in family, subsequently found its account in\nabandoning the imperial interest altogether, and in serving the\nrising principality of Tsin (Shan Si), where it became one of the\n\"six families,” three of which six in 403 B.C. were ultimately\nrecognized by the Emperor as independent rulers. As we have said\nover and over again, in 772 B.C. the Chou Emperor, through female\nintrigues, got into trouble with the Tartars, and was killed: his\nsuccessor had to move the metropolis east to (modern) Ho-nan Fu,\nthus abandoning the western part of his patrimony–the semi-Tartar\nhalf–to Ts’in. Thus Ts’in in 771 B.C. was to the Chou Emperors\nwhat Chou, previous to 1200 B.C., had been to the Shang Emperors.",
        "We now come to strictly historical times, and we shall have no\ndifficulty in showing that even then–h fortiori in times\nnot strictly historical–the various Tartar tribes were still in\npractical possession of the whole north bank of the Yellow River,\nall the way from the Desert to the sea. In fact, in 494 B.C., when\nthe King of Wu sent a giant’s bone to Lu for further explanation,\nConfucius said that the “Long Tartars” (who had frequent fights\nwith Lu in the seventh century B.C.) used to extend south-east\ninto (modern) Kiang Su, almost as far as the mouth of the Yang-tsz\nRiver: he also says that, had it not been for the energy of the\nFirst Protector and his statesman adviser, the philosopher Kwan-\ntsz of Ts’i, orthodox China would certainly have become\nTartarized. It was Confucius also whose learning enabled him to\nrecognize a (Manchu) arrow found in the body of a migrating goose.\nIn the eighth and seventh centuries B.C. the Tartars made repeated\nand obstinate attacks upon Yen (Peking plain), Ts’i (coast Chih Li\nand north Shan Tung), Wei (south Chih Li and north Ho Nan), Sung\n(extreme east Ho Nan), Ts’ao (central Ho Nan), and the Emperor’s\nterritory (west Ho Nan). This situation explains to us why the\nProtector system arose in China, in competition with the waning\nimperial power. Ts’in and Tsin, being already half Tartar\nthemselves, were always well able to cope with and even to annex\nthe Tartar tribes in their immediate vicinity; but orthodox China\nwas ever a prey to the more easterly Tartar attacks; and thus the\nEmperors, threatened by Ts’u to their south, and in a measure also\nby Ts’in and Tsin to their north and west, not only could not any\nlonger protect their orthodox vassals lying towards the east from\nTartar attacks, but could not even protect themselves.",
        "It was Ts’i that drove back the Mongol-Manchu tribes and rescued\nYen in 662; it was the Ts’i ruler who led a coalition of princes\nagainst other groups of Tartars and placed back on his ancestral\nthrone the ruler of Wei, who had been driven from his country by\nTartars in 658; it was the First Protector, ruler of Ts’i, who\nmanaged to pacify the more westerly Tartars we find persistently\nmenacing the Emperor in 648; to whose rescue the Tartars came in\n642, when a coalition of orthodox Chinese princes shamelessly took\nadvantage of the First Protector’s death to attack Ts’i during the\nmourning period. Now it was that the Second Protector, still a\nrefugee among his Tartar relatives, started for Ts’i, his original\nidea being to replace the philosopher Kwan-tsz as adviser to the\nFirst Protector; but, shortly after he reached Ts’i, the First\nProtector died, and it was only by stratagem that his friends\nsucceeded in rescuing the future Second Protector from the arms of\nhis Ts’i Delilah and his d’elices de Capue. His chief adviser,\nand at the same time his brother-in-law from a Tartar point of view,\nwas the lineal descendant of the Chao man who had saved the\nEmperor in 800 B.C. He set out, via the orthodox states,\nfor his own country. These petty orthodox states, such as Wei,\nCheng, and Ts’ao, which did not then see their way to profit\npolitically by the Pretender’s visit, paid the penalty of their\nmeanness and their rudeness to him later on. Sung was polite, as\nat that time Sung and Ts’u were both aiming at the Protectorship.\nTs’u’s hospitality was bluff and good-natured, the King being too\nstrong to fear, and too unsophisticated to intrigue after Chinese\nfashion. Just then news coming from Ts’in that the Pretender’s\nbrothers had all resigned or died, and that his chance had now\ncome, the Pretender hurried to Tsin, regained his throne, and was\nacclaimed Protector of China exactly at the critical moment when a\nstrong hand was urgently required to check the particular\nambitions of Ts’in, Ts’i, and Ts’u. Ts’u was too barbarous; Sung\nwas too pedantic; Tsin alone had unrivalled experience both of\nTartars and Eastern barbarians, and also of Southern barbarians\n(Ts’u). Probably it was only the fact of the Tsin ruling family\nbearing the same clan-name as the Emperor that had decided Tsin\nthroughout to be orthodox Chinese instead of Tartar. The Tartar\nfamily into which the Second Protector had married as a\ncomparatively young man was, however, also of the imperial clan-\nname, i.e. it was of orthodox Chinese origin, but (even like the\nChou imperial family at one time) it had adopted Tartar customs. A\nlarge number of the one thousand or more petty Chinese principalities,\nattached not directly to the Emperor, but to the greater vassals\nas mesne lords, were in the same predicament; that is to say,\nthey were of Chinese origin, but they had found that it paid them\nbest to adopt barbarian ways. It was exactly as though Scipio\nshould settle in Carthage, and become a Carthaginian: C’sar\nin Gaul, and adopt Gallic customs; and so on with other Roman\nadventurers who should find a comfortable gite in Persia,\nAsia Minor, Syria, Egypt, or even in Britain and Germany.",
        "The main point upon which to fix the attention is this. The\nChinese nucleus was very small, and only by rudely thrusting aside\nincompetent emperors and fussy ritual did it succeed in\nemancipating itself from Tartar bondage. That this is not an\nexaggerated view is additionally plain from the fact that Tartars\nhave, even since Confucian times, ruled more and longer than have\nChinese over North China; the Mongols (1260-1368) were the first\nTartars to rule over all China, and nominally over all West Asia;\nthe Manchus (1643-1908) are the first Tartars to rule all China,\nall Manchuria, and all Mongolia, at all effectively; and they have\neven added parts of Turkestan, with Tibet, Nepaul, and other\ncountries over which the Peking imperial Mongol influence was\nalways very shadowy.",
        "In these pictures of ancient Chinese life which we are\nendeavouring to present, the idea is to repeat from every point of\nview the main characteristics of that life, so that a strange and\nunfamiliar subject, very loosely depicted in the straggling annals\nof antiquity, may receive fresh rays of light from every possible\nquarter, and thus stand out clearer as a connected whole.",
        "Take, for instance, the subject of music, which always played in\nChinese ceremonial a prominent part not easy for us now to\nunderstand. One of the chief sights of the modern Confucian\nresidence is the music-room, containing specimens of all the\nancient musical instruments, which, on occasion, are still played\nupon in chorus; a picture of them has been published by Father\nTschepe. (See page 128.) According to the description given by\nthis European visitor, the music is of a most discordant and ear-\nsplitting description: but that does not necessarily dispose of\nthe question; for even parts of Wagner’s Ring are a meaningless\nclang to those who hear the music for the first time, and who are\nunable to read the score or to follow out the “classical\" style.\nAs we have said before, the ancient emperors, at their banquets\ngiven to vassals and others, always had musical accompaniment.",
        "In 626 B.C., when the ruler of Ts’in received a mission from “the\nTartar king” (probably a local king or chief), he was much struck\nwith the sagacity of the envoy sent to him. This envoy still spoke\nthe Tsin language or dialect; but his parents, who were of Tsin\norigin, had adopted Tartar manners. The envoy was also an author,\nand his work, in two sections, had survived at least up to the\nsecond century B.C.: he is classed amongst the “Miscellaneous\nWriters.” The subject of the conversation was the superiority of\nsimple Tartar administration as compared with the intricate ritual\nof the Odes, the Book, the Rites, and the “Music” of orthodox\nChina. The beginnings of Lao-tsz’s Taoism seem to peep out from\nthis Tartar’s words, just as they do with other “Miscellaneous\"\nauthors. The wily Ts’in ruler, in order to secure this clever\nenvoy for his own service, sent two bands of female musicians as a\npresent to the Tartar king, so as to make him less virile; 140\nyears later the cunning ruler of Ts’i did much the same thing in\norder to prevent the Duke of Lu from growing too strong; and the\nimmediate consequence was that Confucius left his fickle master in\ndisgust. Ki-chah, Prince of Wu, was entertained whilst at Lu with\nspecimens of music from the different states. When he came to the\nTs’in music, he said: “Ha! ha! the words are Chinese! When Ts’in\nbecomes quite Chinese, it will have a great future.” This remark\nsuggests a Ts’in language or dialect different from that of Tsin,\nand also from that of more orthodox China. In 546 B.C., when a\nmission from Ts ’u to Tsin was accompanied by a high officer from\nthe disputed orthodox state of Ts’ai lying between those two great\npowers, the theory of music as an adjunct to government was\ndiscussed. Confucius’ view a century later was that music best\nreflected a nation’s manners, and that in good old times authority\nwas manifested quite as much in rites and ceremonies as in laws\nand pronouncements. Previous to that, in 582, it had been\ndiscovered that Ts’u had a musical style of her own; and in 579,\nwhen the Tsin envoy was received there in state, among other\ninstruments of music observed there were suspended bells.",
        "Thus both Ts’in and Ts’u at this date were still in the learning\nstage. Before ridiculing the idea that music could in any way\nserve as a substitute for preaching or commanding, we must reflect\nupon the awe-inspiring contribution of music to our own religious\nservices, not to mention the “speaking” effect of our Western\nnocturnes, symphonies, and operatic music generally.",
        "In 562 B.C., when a statesman of Tsin (whose fame in this\nconnection endures to our own days) succeeded in establishing a\npermanent understanding with the Tartars, based upon joint trading\nrights and reasonable mutual concessions, the principle of\ninteresting the Tartars in cultivation, industry, and so on; as a\nreward for his distinguished services, he was presented with\ncertain music, which meant that he had the political right to have\ncertain musical airs performed in his presence. This concession\nceases to seem ridiculous or even strange to us if we reflect what\nan honour it would have been to, say, the Duke of Wellington, or\nto Nelson, had the right to play “God Save the King” at dinner\nbeen granted to his family band of musicians. Four centuries\nbefore this, when the Emperor Muh made his tour amongst the\nTartars, he always commanded that one particular musical air\n(named) should be struck up by his musicians on certain occasions\n(always stated in the narrative). In Tsin, and probably elsewhere,\nmusic-masters seem to have combined soothsaying and philosophy\nwith their functions; thus, in 558 the music-master of that state\nwas questioned on the arts of good government, to which he\nreplied: “Goodness and justice\"–two special antipathies, by the\nway, of Lao-tsz the Taoist, who lived about this time as an\narchive-keeper at the metropolis. In the year 555, either this\nsame man or another musical prophet in Tsin reassured his fellow-\ncountrymen who were dreading a Ts’u invasion with the following\nwords: “I have just been conducting a song consisting of north and\nsouth airs, and the latter sound as though the south would be\ndefeated.” But music also had its lighter uses, for we have seen\nin Chapter VI. how in 549 two Tsin generals took their ease in a\ncomfortable cart, playing the banjo, whilst passing through Cheng\nto attack Ts’u. Music was used at worship as well as at court; in\n527 the ruler of Lu, as a mark of respect for one of his deceased\nministers, abandoned the playing of music, which otherwise would\nhave been a constituent part of the sacrifice or worship he had in\nhand at the moment. Even in modern China, music is prohibited\nduring solemn periods of mourning, and officials are often\ndegraded for attending theatrical performances on solemn fasts. In\n212 B.C., when the First August Emperor was, like Saul or\nBelshazzar, beginning to grow sad at the contemplation of his\nlonely and unloved greatness, he was suddenly startled at the fall\nof a meteoric stone, bearing upon it what looked like a warning\ninscription. He at once ordered his learned men to compose some\nmusic treating of “true men” and immortals, in order to exorcise\nthe evil omen; it may be mentioned that this emperor’s Taoist\nproclivities have apparently had the indirect result that the word\n\"true man” has come century by century down to us, with the\nmeaning of “Taoist priest,” or “Taoist inspired person.”",
        "A traveller in modern China may still wonder at the utter absence\nof any sign of wealth or luxury except in the very largest towns.\nFine clothes, jewels, concubines, rich food, aphrodisiacs, opium,\nland, cattle–these represent “wealth” as conceived by the Chinese\nrich man’s mind. In 655 Ts’in is said to have paid five ram-skins\nto Ts’u in order to secure the services of a coveted adviser. Not\nmany years after that, when the future Second Protector was making\nhis terms with the King of Ts’u, he remarked: “What can I do for\nyou in return? You already possess all the slaves, musicians,\ntreasures, silks, feathers, ivory, and leather you can want.” In\n606 a magnificent turtle was sent as a new year’s dinner present\nfrom Ts’u to Cheng; in modern China this form of politeness would\nnever do at all, as the turtle has acquired an evil reputation as\na term of abuse, akin to the Spanish use or abuse of the word\n\"garlic”: however, I myself once experienced, when inland, far\naway from the sea, a curious compliment in the shape of a live\ncrab two inches long (sent to me as a great honour) in a small\njar. Of course chairs were unknown, and even the highest sat or\nsquatted on mats; not necessarily on the ground, but spread on\ncouches. Hence the word survives the object, just as with us\n(\"covers” at dinner are “provided” but never seen; thus in China a\nhost is “east mat” and a guest “west mat.”) In 626, when the ruler\nof Ts’in was talking politics with the Tartar envoy just mentioned\nabove, he allowed him, as a special favour, to sit alongside of\nhis own mat (on the couch). These couches probably resembled the\nmodern settee, sofa, k’ang, or divan, such as all visitors\nto China have seen and sat on. Tea was quite unknown in those\ndays, and is not mentioned before the seventh century A.D.; but\npossibly wine may have been served, as tea is now, on a low table\nbetween the two seats. “Tartar couches” (possibly Turkish divans)\nare frequently mentioned, even in the field of battle, and in\ncomparatively modern times. In 300 B.C. Ts’u made a present to a\ndistinguished renegade prince of the Ts’i house of an “elephant\ncouch,” by which is probably meant a couch inlaid with ivory, in\nthe present well-known Annamese style.",
        "In 589 B.C., when Tsin troops reached the Ts’i capital and the sea\n(as already related in Chapters VI. and XXXIX. under the heads of\nArmies and Geographical Knowledge), T’si endeavoured to purchase\npeace by offering to the victor the state treasure in the shape of\nprecious utensils. In 551 a rich man of Ts’u was considered\ninsolently showy because he possessed forty horses. In 545 the\nenvoy from Cheng, acting under the Peace Conference agreement so\noften previously described and alluded to, brings presents of furs\nand silks to Ts’u; and in 537 Tsin speaks of such articles as\noften being presented to Ts’u. In 494, when the King of Yiieh\nreceived his great defeat at the hands of the King of Wu, his\nfirst desperate idea was to kill his wives and children, burn his\nvaluables, and seek death at the head of his troops; but the\ninevitable wily Chinese adviser was at hand, and the King ended by\ntaking his mentor’s advice and successfully bribing the Wu general\n(a Ts’u renegade) with presents of women and valuables. When this\nshrewd Chinese adviser of the Yueh king had, by his sagacious\ncounsels, at last secured the final defeat of Wu, he packed up his\nportable valuables, pearls, and jades, collected his family and\nclients, and went away by sea, never to come back. As a matter of\nfact, he settled in Ts’i, where he made an enormous fortune in the\nfish trade, and ultimately became the traditional Croesus of\nChina, his name being quite as well known to modern Chinese\nthrough the Confucian historians, as the name of Croesus is to\nmodern Europeans through Herodotus. He had, between the two\ndefeats of Yiieh by Wu and Wu by Yiieh, served for several years\nas a spy in Wu, and the fact of his reaching Shan Tung by sea\nconfirms in principle the story of the family of his contemporary,\nthe King of Wu, having similarly escaped to Japan. The place where\nhe landed was probably the same as where the celebrated pilgrim\nFah Hien landed, after his Indian pilgrimage, in 415 A.D., i.e.,\nat the German port of Ts’ing-tao.",
        "We do not hear much of gold in the earlier times, but in 237 B.C.,\nwhen Ts’in was straining every nerve to conquer China, the\n(future) First August Emperor was advised that “it would not cost\nmore than 300,000 pounds weight in gold to bribe the ministers of\nall the states in league against Ts’in.” Yet in 643 B.C., on the\ndeath of the First Protector, the orthodox state of Cheng (lying\nbetween Ts’i and Tsin to the north and Ts’u to the south), was\nbribed with “metal” of some sort–probably gold or silver–to\nabandon Ts’i. In 538 the celebrated Cheng statesman Tsz-ch’an\ninforms his Ts’u colleagues that the Tsin officers “think of\nnothing but money.” What kind of money this was is doubtful, but\nit will be remembered that about this time the “powerful family\"\nof Lu had succeeded in bribing the Tsin ministers, or the “six\ngreat families” then managing Tsin, to deny justice to the\nfugitive Lu duke. In 513 B.C. the powerful Wu king who made\n(modern) Soochow his capital is said to have possessed both iron\nand gold mines, and it is stated that not even China proper could\nturn out better weapons. Large “cash” are said to have been coined\nby the Emperor who reigned from 540 to 520 B.C.; and in 450 B.C.\nthe King of Ts’u is reported to have “closed his depot of\nthe three moneys.” As only copper was coined, it is not easy to\nsay now what the other two “moneys” were. In 318 B.C. a bribe of\n\"one hundred golds” was given by Yen to one of the well-known\npolitical diplomats or intriguers then forming leagues with or\nagainst Ts’in; it is not known for certain how much this was at\nthat particular time and place; but a century or two later it\nmeant, under the Ts’in dynasty, twenty-four ounces; during the Han\ndynasty, conquerors of the Ts’in dynasty, it was only about half\nthat. Cooks seem to have held official positions of considerable\ndignity. “Meat-eaters” in Confucian times was a term for\n\"officials” or “the rich.” Thus when the haughty King of Wu was\nsuddenly recalled home, from his high-handed durbar with Tsin, Lu,\nand other orthodox states, to go and deal with his formidable\nenemy of Yueh, he turned quite pale. By dint of bold “bluff” he\nmanaged after all to gain most of his political points, and to\nretire from an awkward corner with honour; but Chinese spies had\ntheir eyes on him none the less, and reported to the watchful\nenemy that “meat-eaters are not usually blackfaced\"–meaning that\nthe King of Wu evidently had some very recent bad news on his\nmind, for “the well-fed do not usually look care-worn.”",
        "Silk was universally known. When the Second Protector (to be) was\ndallying with his lady-love in Ts’i, the maid of his mistress\nhappened to overhear important conversations from her post in a\nmulberry tree; the presumption is that she was collecting leaves\nfor the silkworms. Again in 519, a century later, there was a\ndispute on the Ts’u-Wu frontier (North An Hwei province), about\nthe possession of certain mulberry trees. Cotton (Gossypium)\nwas unknown in China, and the poorer classes wore garments of\nhempen materials; the cotton tree (Bombyx) was known in\nthe south, but then (as now) the catkins could not be woven\ninto cloth. It was never the custom of officers in China to wear\nswords, until in 409 B.C. Ts’in introduced the practice; but it\nprobably never extended to orthodox China, so far, at least, as\ncivilians’ were concerned. The three dynasties of Hia, Shang, and\nChou had all made use of jade or malachite rings, tablets,\nsceptres, and so on, as marks of official rank.",
        "As to sports, hunting, and especially fowling, seem to have been\nthe most popular pastimes. In 660 a prince of Wei (orthodox) is\nsaid to have had a passion for egret fights. In 539 four-horsed\nchariots are mentioned as being used in a great Ts’u hunt south of\nthe modern Teh-an in northern Hu Peh province, then mostly jungle:\nthese hunts were used as a sort of training for war as well as for\nsport. The celebrated “stone drums” discovered in the seventh\ncentury A.D. near the old Chou capital describe the war-hunts of\nthe active emperor mentioned in Chapter XLI. As might be expected,\nYen (Peking plain) would be well off for horses-to this day\nbrought by the Mongols in droves to Peking: in 539 it is said of\nYen: “She was never a strong power, in spite of her numerous\nhorses.” In 534 a great hunt in Lu is described with much detail;\nhere also chariots were used, and their shafts were reared in\nopposite rows with their tips meeting above, so as to form a\n\"shaft gate,” on which, besides, a flag was kept flying. The\nentrance to Chinese official yamens is still called “the\nshaft gate\";-in fact, the ya was orginally a flag, and “yamen“\nsimply means “flag gate.” In the Middle Ages the Turkish Khans’\nencampments were always spoken of as their ya–thus: “from\nhence 1500 miles north-west to the Khan’s ya.” Cockfighting\nwas a common sport in Ts’i and Lu. In 517 B.C. two prominent\nLu functionaries had a quarrel because one had put metal\nspurs on his bird, whilst the other had scattered mustard in the\nfeathers of his fighting cock: owing to the ambiguity or double\nmeaning of one of the pictographs employed, it is not quite\ncertain that “mustard in the wings” may not mean “a metal helmet\non the head.” Lifting weights was (as now) a favourite exercise;\nin 307 a Ts’in prince died from the effects of a strain produced\nin trying to lift a heavy metal tripod. In Ts’i games at ball,\nincluding a kind of football, were played. As a rule, however, it\nis to be feared that the wealthy Chinese classes in ancient (as in\nmodern) times found their chief recreation in feasting, literary\nbouts, and female society. Curiously enough, nothing is said of\ngambling. Women are depicted at their looms, or engaged upon the\nsilk industry; but it is singular how very little is said of home\nlife, of how the houses were constructed, of how the hours of\nleisure were passed. In modern China the bulk of the male rural\npopulation rises with or before the dawn, and is engaged upon\nfield or garden work until the shades of evening fall in; there is\nno artificial light adequate for purposes of needlework or private\nstudy; even the consolations of tobacco and tea–not to say opium,\nand now newspapers–were unknown in Confucian days. It is\npresumed, therefore, that life was even more humdrum than it is\nnow, except that women at least had feet to walk upon. We gain\nsome glimpses of excessive taxation and popular misery, forced\nlabour and the press-gang; of callous luxury on the part of the\nrich, from the pages of Lao-tsz and Mencius; the Book of Odes also\ntells us much about the pathetic sadness of the people under their\ntaskmasters’ hands. In all countries popular habits change slowly;\nin none more so than in China. We are driven, therefore, by\ncomparison with the life of to-day to conclude that life in those\ntimes was sufficiently wretched, and it is therefore not to be\nwondered at that the miserable people readily sold their services\nto the first ambitious adventurer who could protect them, and feed\nthem from day to day.",
        "Confucius has hitherto appeared to many of us Westerners as a\nstiff, incomprehensible individual, resting his claim to\nimmortality upon sententious nothingnesses directed to no obvious\npractical purpose; but, from the slight sketches of the manners of\nthe times in which he lived given above, it will be apparent that\nhe was a practical man with a definite object in view, and that\nboth his barebones history and his jerky moral teachings were the\nbest he could do with sorry material, and in the face of\ninveterate corruption and tyranny. It has been explained how the\nWarrior King who conquered China for the Chou family in 1122,\nabout a dozen years later enfeoffed the elder brother of the last\nShang dynasty emperor in the country of Sung, where he ruled the\ngreater part of what was left of the late dynasty’s immediate\nentourage, and kept up the sacrifices. This is what Confucius\nmeant when he said: “There remain not in K’i sufficient indications\nof what the institutions of the Hia dynasty were; but I have studied\nin Sung what survives of the Shang dynasty institutions. In practice\nI follow the Chou dynasty institutions, as I have studied them at\nhome in Lu.” K’i was a very petty state of marquess rank situated\nnear Lu, to which, indeed, it was subordinate; but just as Sung had,\nas representatives of the Shang dynasty, the privilege of carrying out\ncertain imperial sacrifices, so had K’i, as representatives of the Hia\ndynasty (enfeoffed by Chou in 1122), an equal right to distinction.\nConfucius’ ancestors were natives of Sung and scions of the ducal\nfamily reigning there; in fact, in 893 his ancestor ought to have\nsucceeded to the Sung throne: in 710 B.C. the last of these\nancestors to hold high official rank in Sung was killed, together\nwith his princely master; and several generations after that the\ngreat-grandfather of Confucius, in order to avoid the secular\nspite of the powerful family who had so killed his ancestor,\ndecided to migrate to Lu. In other words, he just crossed the\nmodern Grand Canal (then the river Sz, which rose in Lu), and\nmoved a few days’ journey north-east to the nearest civilized\nstate of any standing. Confucius’ father is no mythical personage,\nbut a stout, common soldier, whose doughty deeds under three\nsuccessive dukes are mentioned in the Lu history quite in a casual\nand regular way. When still quite a child, Confucius disclosed a\ncurious fancy for playing with sacrificial objects and practising\nceremonies, just as English children in the nursery sometimes play\nat “being parson and sexton,” and at “having feasts.” When he grew\nup to manhood, a high officer of Lu foretold his future greatness,\nnot only on account of his precociously grave demeanour, but also\nbecause he was in direct descent from the Shang dynasty, and\nbecause the intrigues that had taken place in Sung had deprived\nhim of his succession rights there also. This high officer’s two\nsons, both frequently mentioned by various contemporary authors,\nand one of whom subsequently went with Confucius to visit Lao-tsz\nat the imperial court, thereupon studied the rites under the man\nof whom their father had spoken so well. The only official\nappointment in Lu that Confucius was able to obtain at this period\nwas that of steward to one of the “powerful families” then engaged\nin the task, so congenial in those times all over China, of\nundermining the ducal authority; this appointment was a kind of\nstewardship, in which his duties consisted in tallying the\nmeasures of grain and checking the heads of cattle. One of the two\nsons of the above-mentioned statesman who had foreseen Confucius’\ndistinction, some time after this submitted a request to the ruler\nof Lu that he might proceed in company with Confucius to visit the\nimperial capital; and it is supposed by Sz-ma Ts’ien, the\nhistorian of 100 B.C., that this was the occasion on which took\nplace the philosopher’s famous interview with Lao-tsz. In this\nconnection there are two or three remarks to make. In the first\nplace, it is recorded of nearly all the vassal states that they\neither did pay visits to, or wished to visit, the metropolis; and\nthat royal dukes and royal historians, either at vassal request or\nunder imperial instruction, took part in advising vassal states.\nIn the second place, as Confucius then held no high office, his\nvisit, being a private affair, would not be considered worth\nmentioning in the Lu annals, and it would therefore almost follow\nas a matter of course that the young man who accompanied him,\nbeing of official status by birth, would count as the chief\npersonage. In the third place, there is no instance in the\nConfucian histories of a mere archive-keeper or a mere philosopher\nbeing mentioned on account of his importance in that capacity.\nSuch men as Tsz-ch’an, Shuh Hiang, Ki-chah, and the other\ndistinguished “ritualists” of the time, are not mentioned so much\non account of their abstract teachings as they are on account of\ntheir being able statesmen, competent to stave off the rising tide\nof revolutionary opinions. Even Confucius himself only appears in\ncontemporary annals as an able administrator and diplomat; there\nis no particular mention of his “school,” and, a fortiori,\nhe himself does not mention Lao-tsz’s “school,” even if Lao-tsz\nhad one; for he disapproved of Lao-tsz’s republican and democratic\nway of construing the ancient tao. Finally, neither Confucius\nnor Lao-tsz, however great their local reputations, were\nyet universally “great\"; they were consequently as little the\nobjects of hero-worship as was Shakespeare when he was at the\nheight of his activity; and of the living Shakespeare we know next\nto nothing. At this time Lu was in a quandary, surrounded by the\nrival great powers of Tsin, Ts’i, and Ts’u, all three of which\nabsolutely ignored the Emperor, except so far as they might\nsucceed in using him and his ritualistic prestige as a cat’s-paw\nin their own selfish interests. When Confucius was thirty years of\nage (522 B.C.) the ruler of Ts’i, accompanied by his minister the\nphilosopher Yen-tsz, paid a visit to Lu, and had a discussion with\nConfucius upon the question: “How did Ts’in, from beginnings so\nsmall and obscure, reach her present commanding position?” Besides\nthis, the Ts’i ruler and his henchman Yen-tsz both took the\nopportunity to study the rites at Lu. This fact seems to support\nthe (later) statement that Confucius had himself been to study the\nrites at the metropolis, and also to explain Confucius’ own\nconfession that he did not understand much about the Hia dynasty\ninstitutions that used to exist in K’i,–a state lying eastward of\nTs’i. In 520 the last envoy ever sent from Lu to the Chou\nmetropolis reported on his return that the imperial family was in\na state of feud and anarchy: if, as it is stated, this was really\nthe last envoy from Lu, then Confucius and his friend must have\nvisited Lao-tsz before the former reached the age of thirty. Tsin\nand Lu were both now in a revolutionary condition, and a struggle\nwith the “powerful families” was going on in each case; it was\nalso beginning in Ts’i, and in principle seems to have been\nexactly akin to our English struggle between King John and his\nbarons (as champions of popular rights) against the greed of the\ntax-collector. To avoid home troubles, Confucius at the age of\nthirty-five went to Ts’i, in order, if possible, to serve his\nfriend the Marquess, who had a few years before consulted him\nabout the rise of Ts’in. There perhaps it was that he found an\nopportunity to study the music of the Hia dynasty at the petty\nstate of K’i, only one day’s journey east of the Ts’i capital, on\nthe north-east frontier of Lu; and then it must have been that he\nformed his opinion about the surviving Hia rites. His advice to\nthe reigning prince of Ts’i was so highly appreciated that it was\nproposed to confer an estate upon him. It is interesting to note\nthat the jealous Yen-tsz (who was much admired as a companionable\nman by Confucius) protested against this grant, on the ground that\n\"men of his views are sophistical rhetoricians, intoxicated with\nthe exuberance of their own verbosity; incompetent to administer\nthe people; wasting time and money upon expensive funerals. Life\nis too short to waste in trying to get to the bottom of these\ninane studies.” From this it will be seen that Lao-tsz was by no\nmeans alone in despising Confucius’ conservative and ritualistic\nviews, though it is quite possible that Yen-tsz may still have\nrespected him as a man and a politician. Finally, Confucius,\nfinding that the Ts’i ministers were all arrayed against him, and\nthat the Marquess fain confessed himself too old to fight his\nbattles for him, quitted the country and returned home. His own\nduke died in exile in 510 B.C., power remaining in the intriguing\nhands of an influential private family; and for at least ten years\nConfucius held no office in his native land, but spent his time in\nediting the Odes, the Book, the Chou Rites, and the Music; by some\nit is even thought that he not only edited but composed the Book\n(of History), or put together afresh such parts of the old Book as\nsuited his didactic purposes. Meanwhile the private family\nintrigues went on more actively than ever; until at last, in 501,\nwhen Confucius was fifty years of age, the most formidable\nagitator of them all, finding his position untenable, escaped to\nTs’i; it even seems that Confucius placed, or thought of placing,\nhis services at the disposal of one of these rebel subjects.\nPossibly it was in view of such contingencies that the reigning\nduke at last gave Confucius a post as governor of a town, where\nhis administration was so admirable that he soon passed through\nhigher posts to that of Chief Justice, or Minister of Justice.\nConfucius’ views on law are well known. He totally disapproved of\nTsz-ch’an’s publication of the law in the orthodox state of Cheng,\nas explained in Chapter XX., holding that the judge should always\n\"declare” the law, and make the punishment fit the crime, instead\nof giving the people opportunities to test how far they could\nstrain the literal terms of the law. He also said: “I am like\nothers in administering the law; I apply it to each case; it is\nnecessary to slay one in order not to have to slay more. The\nancients understood prevention better than we do now; at present\nall we can hope to do is to avoid punishing unjustly. The ancients\nstrove to save a prisoner’s life; now we can only do our best to\nprove his guilt. However, better let a guilty man go free than\nslay an innocent one.”",
        "Confucius’ old friend the ruler of Ts’i was still alive (he\nreigned fifty-eight years, one of the longest reigns on record in\nChinese history), and he had just suffered serious humiliation at\nthe hands of the barbarous King of Wu, to whose heir-apparent he\nhad been obliged to send one of his daughters in marriage. The\nProtectorate of China was going a-begging for want of a worthy\nsovereign, and it looked at one time as though Confucius’ stern\nand efficient administration would secure the coveted prize for\nLu. The Marquess of Ts’i therefore formed a treacherous plot to\nassassinate both master and man, and with this end in view sent an\nenvoy to propose a friendly conference. It was on this occasion\nthat Confucius uttered his famous saying (quoted, however, from\nwhat “he had heard”) that “they who discuss by diplomacy should\nalways have the support of a military backing.” A couple of\ngenerals accordingly accompanied the party to the trysting-place;\nand it is presumed that the generals had a force of soldiers with\nthem, even though the indispensable common people be not worth\nmention in Chinese history. In conformity with practice, an altar\nor dai’s was constructed; wine was offered, and the usual rites\nwere being fulfilled to the utmost, when suddenly a Ts’i officer\nadvanced rapidly and said: “I now propose to introduce some\nforeign musicians,” a band of whom at once entered the arena, with\nbrandished weapons, waving feathers, and noisy yells. Confucius\nsaw through this sinister manoeuvre at once, and, hastily mounting\nthe dais (except, out of respect, the last step), expostulated in\nthe plainest terms. The ruler of Ts’i was so ashamed of his\nposition that he at once sent the dancers away. But a second group\nof mountebanks were promptly introduced in spite of this check.\nConfucius was so angry, that he demanded their instant execution\nunder the law (presumably a general imperial law) “providing the\npunishment of death for those who should excite animosity between\nprinces.” Heads and legs soon covered the ground; and Confucius\nplayed his other cards so well that he secured, in the sequel, a\nformal treaty, actually surrendering to Lu certain territories\nthat had unlawfully been held for some years by Ts’i. On the other\nhand, Lu had to promise to aid Ts’i with 22,500 men in case Ts’i\nshould engage in any “foreign” war–probably alluding to Wu. Two\nor three years after that stirring event there was civil war in\nLu, owing to Confucius having insisted on the “barons” dismantling\ntheir private fortresses.",
        "At the age of fifty-six Confucius left his post as Minister of\nJustice to take up that of First Counsellor: his first act was to\nput to death a grandee who was sowing disorder in the state. It\nwas during these years of supreme administration that complete\norder was restored throughout the country; thieves disappeared;\n\"sucking-pigs and lambs were sold for honest prices\"; and there\nwas general content and rejoicing throughout the land. All this\nmade the neighbouring people of Ts’i more and more uneasy, even to\nthe point of fearing annexation by Lu. The wily old Marquess\ntherefore, again at the instigation of the man who had planned the\nattempted assassination of 500 B.C., made a selection of eighty of\nthe most beautiful women Ts’i could produce, besides thirty four-\nhorsed chariots of the most magnificent description. The reigning\nMarquess of Lu, as well as his “powerful family” friend against\nwhom Confucius had once thought of taking arms (who, indeed, acted\nas intermediary) both fell into the trap: public duty and\nsacrifices were neglected; and the result was that Confucius at\nonce threw up his offices and left the country in disgust. His\nfirst visit was to Wei (imperial clan), the capital city of which\nstate then stood on the Yellow River, in the extreme north-east\npart of modern Ho Nan province; and through this capital the river\nthen ran: the metropolis of one of the very ancient emperors\nprevious to the Hia dynasty had nearly 2000 years before been in\nthe immediate neighbourhood, as also had been the last capital of\nthe Shang dynasty, of which, as we have seen, Confucius was a\ndistant scion. After a few months’ stay there, he was suspected\nand calumniated; so he decided to move on, although the ruler of\nWei had generously appropriated to him a salary (in grain)\nsuitable to his high rank. He accordingly proceeded eastwards to a\ntown belonging to Sung (in the extreme south of modern Chih Li\nprovince): here he had the misfortune to be mistaken for the\ndangerous individual who had fled from Lu to Ts’i in 501, in\nconsequence of which he returned to stay in Wei with his friend\nK’u-peh-yuh, who, as mentioned in Chapter XXVIII., had been\nvisited by Ki-chah of Wu in 544 B.C. Here, as a distinguished\ntraveller, he was asked (practically commanded) by one of the\nruler’s wives to pay her a visit; and, though the reluctant visit\nwas paid with all propriety and reserve, the fact that this woman\nwas at the time suspected of having committed incest with her own\nbrother is considered by uncompromising native critics to leave a\nslight stain on Confucius’ character. Worse still, the reigning\nprince took his wife out for a drive with a eunuch sitting in the\nsame carriage, ordering the sage to follow the party in an\ninferior carriage. This was too much for Confucius, who then\nresumed his original journey through Sung, from which he had\nturned back, and proceeded to the small state of Ts’ao (imperial\nclan; still called Ts’ao-thou, extreme south-west of modern Shan\nTung province). To-day he would have had to cross the Yellow\nRiver, but of course none is here mentioned, as Confucius had\nalready left it behind at the Wei capital: in fact, he had been on\nthe right bank ever since he left his own country. This was 495\nB.C. After a short stay in Ts’ao, the philosopher proceeded south\ntowards the capital of Sung (modern Kwei-teh Fu in the extreme\neast of Ho Nan). For some reason the Minister of War there wished\nto assassinate him–probably because the arch-intriguer whom\nConfucius had driven out of Lu in 501, and who had taken refuge\nfirst in Ts’i and then in Sung, had calumniated him there.\nConfucius thereupon made his way westwards, over the various\nheadwaters of the River Hwai, to Cheng (imperial clan), the state\nwhich had been for a generation so admirably administered by Tsz-\nch’an: in fact, a man outside the city gate observed “how like\nTsz-ch’an” the stranger looked. Some accounts make out that Tsz-\nch’an was then only just dead, but the better opinion is that he\nhad already then been dead for twenty-seven years: in any case it\nis curious that Confucius, who was a very tall man, should twice\nbe mistaken for other persons. Thence Confucius turned back south-\neast to the orthodox state of Ch’en (modern Ch’en-chou Fu in\nEastern Ho Nan). This was one of the very oldest principalities in\nChina, dating from even before the Hia dynasty (2205 B.C.); and\nthe Warrior King of Chou, after conquering the empire in 1122\nB.C., had industriously sought out the most suitable lineal\ndescendant to take over the ancient fee of his remote ancestor,\nand continue the sacrifices.",
        "Confucius remained in Ch’en over three years, and during that time\nthe barbarian King of Wu annexed several neighbouring towns,\nwhilst Tsin and Ts’u ravaged the surrounding country in turn, in\ntheir rival efforts to secure a predominant influence there. Here\nit was, too, that a bird of prey, pierced with a strange arrow,\nfell near the prince’s palace: from the wood used in making the\narrow and the peculiar stone barb employed to tip it, Confucius\nwas able to explain that the bird must have flown from (modern)\nManchuria. (This annual flight of bustards and geese, to and from\nthe Steppes, may be observed any winter to-day.) He next turned\nnorth, and arrived once more at the spot in Sung he had visited in\n496: here he was arrested, but set free on his solemn promise that\nhe would not go to Wei, which state at the moment was considering\nthe advisability of attacking that very Sung town. Confucius\ndeliberately broke his plighted word, on the ground that “promises\nextorted by violence are void, and are not recognized by the\ngods.” (These words, which, after all, are good English law, were\nquoted by the irate Chang Chf-tung when Russia “extorted” the\nLivadia Treaty from Ch’unghou.) On his arrival in Wei, he advised\nhis old friend, the Wei duke, to attack the Sung town he had just\nleft. But the duke thought it best to have the Yellow River\nbetween himself and the rival states of Ts’u and Tsin (this\nspecific mention of the Yellow River as being west of a city in\nlong. 114o 30’ E. is interesting). The latter state, Tsin, then\nheld most of the left bank. Confucius even thought of accepting\nthe invitation of a Tsin rebel to go and assist him: this was just\nat the moment when the “six families” were gradually breaking up\nthe once powerful northern orthodox state. He also hesitated\nwhether he would not do better, as the prince of Wei would not\nemploy him, to proceed west to Tsin in order there to serve one of\nthe contending six families: in fact he actually got as far as the\nYellow River (another proof that it must then have run on the west\nside of Wei-hwei Fu in Ho Nan); but turned back to Wei on hearing\nunfavourable news from the Tsin capital (in south Shan Si). As the\nWei prince treated him somewhat cavalierly during an interview, he\ndecided to go back once more due south to the ancient state of\nCh’en. Here (492) he heard news of the destruction by fire of some\nof the Lu ancestral temples, and of the death of the “powerful\nfamily” minister whose disgraceful conduct with the singing girls\nhad led to his departure from Lu in disgust. This minister was a\nsort of hereditary maire du palais, an arrangement which\nseems to have been customary in many states, and his last words to\nhis son were: “When you succeed me, send for Confucius: my\nadministration has failed: I did wrong in dismissing him.” The son\nhad not the courage to ask Confucius himself, but he sent instead\nfor one of the philosopher’s disciples, and it was arranged with\nConfucius’ friends that this disciple on taking office should send\nfor Confucius himself, who really wished to be employed in Lu\nagain. Meanwhile Confucius decided to visit the orthodox state of\nTs’ai (imperial clan), lying to the south of Che’n: the capital of\nthis state had been originally a town on the upper waters of the\nHwai River, right in the heart of modern Ho Nan province; but,\nunder stress of the Tsin and T’su wars, it had twice moved its\nchief city eastwards, and owing to a Ts’u invasion, it was now\n(491) on the main Hwai River in modern An Hwei province, and was\nat the moment under the political influence of Wu; it is not\nclear, however, whether Confucius visited the old or the new\ncapital. After a year’s stay here, Confucius went further\nwestwards to a certain Ts’u town (near Nan-yang Fu in Ho Nan),\npassing, on his way, near the place in which Lao-tsz was born. He\nsoon returned to Ts’ai, where he stayed three years. It will be\nobserved that ever since 700 B.C. it had been the deliberate\npolicy of Ts’u to annex or overshadow as many of the orthodox\nstates as possible, so that Ts’u’s undoubtedly high literary\noutput, in later years, is easily accounted for: in other words,\nTs’u’s northern population was now already orthodox Chinese.\nMoreover, it must not be forgotten that, even before the Chou\nconquest, one of the early Ts’u rulers was an author himself, and\nhad been tutor to the father of the Chou founder: that means to\nsay Ts’u was possibly always as literary as China.",
        "Meanwhile Ts’u and semi-barbarian Wu were contesting possession of\nCh’en, and the King of Ts’u tried to secure by presents the\nservices of Confucius, who had prudently transferred himself to a\nsafe place in the open country lying between Ch’en and Ts’ai The\nministers of these two orthodox states, fearing the results to\ntheir own people should Confucius (as he seems in fact to have\ncontemplated) decide to accept the Ts’u offer, with a police force\nsurrounded the Confucian party; they were only able to escape from\nstarvation by sending word to the King, who at once sent a\ndetachment to free the sage. He would have conferred a fief upon\nConfucius, but his ministers advised him of the danger of such a\nproceeding, seeing that the Chou dynasty conquered the empire\nafter beginning with a petty fief, and that the great kingdom of\nTs’u itself had arrived at its present greatness after beginning\nwith a still smaller fief. Accordingly the sage decided to return\nto Wei (489), where several of his disciples received official\nposts, and where Confucius himself seems to have acted as\nunofficial adviser, especially in the matter of a contested\nsuccession. All this competition for, or at least jealousy of,\nConfucius’ services proves that his repute as an administrator\n(not necessarily as a philosopher) was already widely spread. The\nfollowing year the King of Wu appeared before the Lu capital, and\none of Confucius’ former disciples holding office there (the one\nwho went in advance in 492) just succeeded in moderating the\nbarbarians’ demands, which, however, only took the comparatively\nharmless “spiritual” form of orthodox sacrificial victims.",

        "1. The dotted line shows the present Grand Canal; the part between\nthe Yang-tsz and Hwai Rivers was made by the King of Wu. The part\nnorth of the Hwai is chiefly the channel of the River Sz, flowing\nfrom the Lu capital into the Hwai.",

        "4. The crosses mark capitals. Ts’ai (two marked) and Hii (one\nmarked) frequently shifted capitals.]",
        "In 484 Confucius was still in Wei, for in that year he is stated\nto have declined to discuss there a question connected with making\nwar. In the year 484 or 483 the disciple sent by Confucius to Lu,\nas stated, in 492 conducted an expedition against Ts’i: this was\nthe shameful period when orthodox Lu, in compulsory league with\nbarbarous Wu, was playing a double and treacherous game under\nstress, and the question of recalling Confucius to save his native\ncountry was on the tapis. Hearing of this, and despite the\nheavy bribes offered him to stay by the ruler of Wei, Confucius\nstarted with alacrity for Lu, where he arrived safely after\nfourteen years of wandering. He is often stated to have visited\nover forty states in all; but it must be remembered that each of\nthe important countries he visited had in turn a number of\nsatellites of its own; as, for instance, the extremely ancient\n\"marquess state” of Ki, or K’i, subordinate to Lu, which, though\npossessing great spiritual authority, had no weight in lay policy.\nAn interesting point to notice is that Confucius’ travels almost\nexactly coincide with those of the Second Protector 150 years\nearlier (see Chapter XXXIX); both of them ignored the Emperor, and\nboth of them visited Ts’i, Ts’ao, Sung, and Cheng on their way to\nthe Ts’u frontiers; but Confucius was not able to get much farther\nwest so as to reach the Ts’u capital; nor was he able to get to\nTsin; not to say the still more distant Ts’in. In other words, the\nlimited centre of orthodox China remained for many centuries the\nsame, and the vast regions surrounding it were still semi-\nbarbarian in the fifth century B.C. Now it was that Confucius,\nseeing that the imperial power had diminished almost to nothing;\nthat the Odes and Book, the Rites, and the Music no longer\npossessed their former influence; employed himself in making\nsystematic search for documents, in re-editing the Book (of\nHistory), and in endeavouring to ascertain the exact ritual or\nadministration of the preceding dynasties. “Henceforth the Rites\ncould be understood and transmitted,\"–from which we may assume\nthat, up to this time, they had been practically a monopoly of the\nprincely caste. He did not go further back into the mythical\nperiod than the two emperors who preceded the Hia dynasty, nor did\nhe bring the Book farther down than to the time of Duke Muh of\nTs’in, which practically means the time of the first Protectors.\nHe really did for rites and history what he had blamed Tsz-ch’an\nfor doing with the law: he popularized it. He also attempted with\npersistent study to master the Changes, to which incomprehensible\nwork he added features of his own–very little more understandable\nthan the original texts. As to the Odes, 3000 in number, he used\nthe pruning knife much more vigorously, and nine-tenths of them\nwere rejected as unsuitable for the purposes of good didactic\nlessons or conservative precedents. If we substitute, as we are\nentitled to do, the vague word “religion” for the equally vague\nword “rites” (which in fact were the only ancient Chinese\nreligion); if we substitute the empty Christian churches of to-\nday, and the too little scrupulous ambitions of rival European\nPowers, for the neglected tao of the Chou ideal, and for\nthe savage rivalry of the great Chinese vassals; we obtain an\nalmost precisely similar situation in modern Europe. If we can\nimagine a great Pope, or a great philosopher, taking advantage of\na turn in the European conscience to bring back the simple ideals\nof Christianity, we can easily imagine this European Confucius\nbeing universally hailed in future times as the saviour of a\nparlous situation; which, in Europe now, as 2000 years ago in\nChina, entails on the people so much misery and suffering.\nConfucius was, in short, in a way, a Chinese Pius X. declaiming\nagainst Modernism.",
        "Confucius’ only certain original work was the “Springs and\nAutumns,” which is practically a continuation (with the necessary\nintroductory years) of the ancient Book edited or, as some think,\ncomposed by him. He brought the former, this history of his, down\nfrom 722 to 481 B.C. and died in 479. His pupil Tso K’iu-ming,\nwho was official historian to the Lu court, annotated and\nexpounded Confucius’ bald annals, bringing the narrative down from\n481 to 468; and Tso’s delightful work forms the chief, but by no\nmeans the sole, basis for what we have to say in the present book\nof sketches.",
        "Apart from the fact that reverence for rulers was the pivot of the\nChou religious system, or, what was then the same thing,\nadministrative system; official historiographers, who were mere\nservants of the executive, had to be careful how they offended the\nexecutive power in those capricious days; all the more had a\nprivate author and a retired official like Confucius carefully to\nmind the conventions. For instance, two historians had been put to\ndeath by a king-maker in Ts’i for recording the murder by him of a\nTs’i reigning prince; and Ts’i was but next door to Lu. Hence we\nfind the leading feature of his work is that he hints rather than\ncriticizes, suggests rather than condemns, conceals rather than\nexposes, when it is a question of class honour or divine right;\njust as, with us, the Church prefers to hush up rather than to\npublish any unfortunate internal episode that would redound to its\ndiscredit. So shocked was he at the assassination of the ruler of\nTs’i by an usurping family in 481, that, even at his venerable\nage, he unsuccessfully counselled instant war against Ts’i. His\nmotive was perhaps doubtful, for the next year we find a pupil of\nhis, then in office, going as a member of the mission to the same\nusurper in order to try and obtain a cession of territory\nimproperly held. This pupil was one of the friends who assisted at\nthe arrangement made in Wei in 492. Confucius’ failings–for after\nall he was only a man, and never pretended to be a genius–in no\nway affect the truth of his writings, for they were detected\nalmost from the very beginning, and have never been in the least\nconcealed. Notable instances are the mission from Lu to Ts’u in\n634; Confucius conceals the fact that, not courtesy to barbarian\nTs’u, but a desire to obtain vengeance against orthodox Ts’i was\nthe true motive. Again, in 632, when the faineant Emperor\nwas “sent for” by the Second Protector to preside at a durbar;\nConfucius prefers to say: “His Majesty went to inspect his fiefs\nnorth of the river,” thus even avoiding so much as to name the\nexact place, not to say describe the circumstances. He punishes\nthe Emperor for an act of impropriety in 693 by recording him as\n\"the King,” instead of “the Heavenly King.” On the other hand, in\n598, even the barbarian King of Ts’u was “a sage,” because, having\nconquered the orthodox state of Ch’en, he magnanimously renounced\nhis conquest. In 529 the infamous ruler of the orthodox state of\nTs’ai is recorded as being “solemnly buried\"; but the rule was\nthat no “solemn funeral” should be accorded to (1) barbarians, (2)\nrulers who lose their crown, (3) murderers. Now, this ruler was a\nmurderer; but it was a barbarian state (Ts’u) that killed him,\nwhich insult to civilization must be punished by making two blacks\none white, i.e. by giving the murdered murderer an orthodox\nfuneral. Again, in 522, a high officer was “killed by robbers\"; it\nis explained that there were no robbers at all, in fact, but that\nthe mere killing of an officer by a common person needs the\nassumption of robbery. It is like the legal fiction of lunacy in\nmodern Chinese law to account for the heinous crime of parricide,\nand thus save the city from being razed to the ground. Once more,\nat the Peace Conference of 546, Ts’u undoubtedly “bluffed” Tsin\nout of her rightful precedence; but, Tsin being an orthodox state,\nConfucius makes Tsin the diplomatic victor. We have already seen\nthat he once deliberately broke his plighted word, meanly attacked\nthe men who spared him; and, out of servility, visited a woman of\nnoble rank who was “no better than she ought to have been.” There\nis another little female indiscretion recorded against him. When,\nin 482, the Lu ruler’s concubine, a Wu princess (imperial clan\nname), died, Confucius obsequiously went into mourning for an\n\"incestuous” woman; but, seeing immediately afterwards that the\npowerful family then at the helm did not condescend to do so, he\nsomewhat ignominiously took off his mourning in a hurry. All\nthese, and numerous similar petty instances of timorousness, may\nappear to us at a remote distance trifling and pusillanimous, as\ndo also many of the model personal characteristics and goody-goody\nprivate actions of the sage; but if we make due allowance for the\ndifficulty of translating strange notions into a strange tongue,\nand for the natural absence of sympathy in trying to enter into\nforeign feelings, we may concede that these petty details, quite\nincidentally related, need in no way destroy the main features of\na great picture. Few heroes look the character except in their\nnative clothes and surroundings; and, as Carlyle said, a naked\nHouse of Lords would look much less dignified than a naked negro\nconference.",
        "As a philosopher, Confucius in his own time had scarcely the\nreputation of Tsz-ch’an of Cheng, who in many respects seems to\nhave been his model and guide. Much more is said of Tsz-ch’an’s\nphilosophy, of his careful definition of the ritual system, of his\nlegal acumen, of his paternal care for the people’s welfare; but,\nlike his contemporaries and friends of Ts’i, Tsin, Cheng, Sung,\nWei; and even of Wu and Yueh; he was working for the immediate\ngood of his own state in times of dire peril; whereas Confucius\nfrom first to last was aiming at the restoration of religion\n(i.e., of the imperial, ritualistic, feudal system); and for this\nreason it was that, after the violent unification of the empire by\nthe First August Emperor in 221 B.C., followed by his fall and the\nrise of the Han dynasty in 202 B.C., this latter house finally\ndecided to venerate, and all subsequent houses have continued to\nvenerate, Confucius’ memory; because his system was, after Lao-\ntsz’s system had been given a fair trial, at last found the best\nsuited for peace and permanency.",
        "Not only is Lao-tsz not mentioned in the “Springs and Autumns” of\nConfucius, as extended by his contemporary and latter commentators,\nbut none other of the great writers and philosophers anterior\nto and contemporary with Confucius are spoken of except\nstrictly in their capacity of administrators. Thus the Ts’i\nphilosopher Kwan-tsz of the First Protector’s time, 650 B.C.; the\nTs’i philosopher Yen-tsz of Confucius’ time; and the others\nmentioned in preceding Chapters, notably in Chapter XV. (of whom\neach orthodox state of political importance can boast at least\none); based their reputation on what they had achieved for the\nstate rather than what they had taught in the abstract; and their\neconomical and historical books, which have all come down to us in\na more or less complete and authentic state, are valued for the\nexpression they give to the definite theories by which they\narrived at practical results, rather than for the preaching of the\ncounsels of perfection, We have seen that Yen-tsz expressed rather\na contempt for the (to him) out-of-date formalistic ideals of\nConfucius, though Confucius himself had a high opinion of Yen-tsz.\nLao-tsz is first mentioned by the writers of the various “schools\"\nbrought into existence by the collapse of Tsin in 452 B.C., and\nits subdivision into three separate kingdoms, recognized as such\nby the puppet Emperor in 403 B.C. The diplomatic activity was soon\nafter that quite extraordinary, and each of the seven royal courts\nbecame a centre of revolutionary thought; that is, every literary\nadventurer had his own views of what interpretation of ancient\nliterature was best suited to the times: it was Modernism with a\nvengeance. There is ample evidence of Lao-tsz’s influence upon the\nage, though Lao-tsz himself had been dead for a century or more in\nthe year 403. Lao-tsz is spoken of and written about in the fourth\ncentury B.C. as though it were perfectly well known who he was,\nand what his sentiments were; but as, up to Confucius’ time, state\nintercourse had been confined to traders, warriors, and officials\nof the princely castes; and as books had been unwieldy objects\nstored only in capitals and great centres; there is good reason to\nassume that philosophy had been taught almost entirely by word of\nmouth, and that something must have occurred shortly after his\ndeath to cheapen and facilitate the dissemination of literature.\nProbably this something was the gradual introduction of the\npractice of writing on silk rolls and on silk “paper,” which\npractice is known to have been in vogue long before the discovery\nof rubbish paper A.D. 100. Confucius himself evidently made use of\nthe old-fashioned bamboo slips, strung together by cords like a\nbundle of tickets; for we are told that he worked so hard in\nendeavouring to understand the “Changes,” that he “wore out three\nsets of leather bands\"; and it will be remembered from Chapter\nXXXV. how the Bamboo Books buried in 299 B.C., to be discovered\nnearly 600 years later, consisted of slips strung together in this\nway.",
        "Confucius’ movements during the fourteen years of his exile are\nvery clearly marked out, and there seems to be no doubt that his\nvisit to the Emperor’s court took place when he was a young man;\nfirstly, because Lao-tsz ironically calls him a young man, and\nsecondly because he went to visit Lao-tsz with the son of the\nstatesman who on his death-bed foretold Confucius’ future\ndistinction; and there was no Lu mission to the imperial court\nafter 520. In the second century B.C., not only are there a dozen\nstatesmen specifically stated to have studied the works of Lao-\ntsz, but the Empress herself is said to have possessed his book;\nand a copy of it, distinctly said to be in ancient character, was\nthen stored amongst other copies of the same book in the imperial\nlibrary. The two questions which the Chinese historians and\nliterary men of the fifth, fourth, third, and second centuries\nB.C. do not attempt to decide are: Why is the life of Lao-tsz not\ngiven to us earlier than 100 B.C.? Why is that life so scant, and\nwhy does the writer of it allude to “other stories” current about\nhim? Why is it that the book which Lao-tsz wrote at the request of\na friend is not alluded to by any writer previous to 100 B.C.?",
        "As not one single one of these numerous Taoists or students of\nLao-tsz expresses the faintest doubt about Lao-tsz’s existence, or\nabout the genuineness of his traditional teachings, it is evident\nthat the meagreness of Lao-tsz’s life, as told by the historian,\nis rather a guarantee of the truth of what he says than the\nreverse, so far as he knows the truth; otherwise he would have\ncertainly embellished. The essence of Lao-tsz’s doctrine is its\ndemocracy, its defence of popular rights, its allusion to kings\nand governments as necessary evils, its disapproval of luxury and\nhoarding wealth; its enthusiasm for the simple life, for absence\nof caste, for equality of opportunity, for socialism and\ninformality; all of which was, though extracted from the same\nOdes, Book, Changes, and Rites, quite contrary in principle to the\n\"back to the rites” doctrine of Confucius. Therefore, there could\nbe no possible inducement for Confucius, the pruning editor of the\nOdes, Book, etc., or for his admirers, to mention Lao-tsz in\neither his original work, the “Springs and Autumns,” or in the\nother works (composed by his disciples) giving the original words\nand sentiments of Confucius. Besides, during the whole of Lao-\ntsz’s life, the imperial court (where he served as a clerk) was\ntotally ignored by all the “powers” as a political force; the only\npersons mentioned in what survives of Chou history are the\nhistoriographers, the wizards, the ritual clerks, the ducal\nenvoys, now sent by the Emperor to the vassals, now consulted by\nthe vassals upon matters of etiquette. Lao-tsz, being an obscure\nclerk in an obscure appanage, and holding no political office, had\nno more title to be mentioned in history than any other servant or\n\"harmless drudge.” That his doctrines were well known is not\nwonderful, for Tsz-ch’an, his contemporary, and this great man’s\ncolleagues of the other states, also had doctrines of their own\nwhich were widely discussed and, as we have seen, even Tsz-ch’an\nwas severely blamed for the unheard-of novelty of committing the\nlaws to writing, both by Confucius of Lu and by Shuh Hiang of Tsin\n(imperial clan states). It is reasonable to suppose, therefore,\nthat the traditional story is true; namely, that Lao-tsz’s\ndoctrines were never taught in a school at all, and that he had no\nfollowers or admirers except the vassal envoys who used to come on\nspiritual business to the metropolis. We have seen how these men\nused to entertain each other over their wine by quoting the Odes\nand other ancient saws; when consulting the imperial library to\nrectify their own dates, they would naturally meet the old recluse\nLao-tsz, and hear from his own mouth what he thought of the coming\ncollapse anticipated by all. He is said to have left orthodox\nChina in disgust, and gone West–well, he must have passed through\nTs’in if he went to the west. At the frontier pass (it is not\nknown precisely whether on the imperial frontier or on the Ts’in\nfrontier) an acquaintance or correspondent on duty there invited\nhim to put his thoughts into writing, which he did. Books being\nextremely rare, copies would be slowly transmitted. This was about\n500 B.C., between which time and 200 B.C., when a copy of his book\nis first reported to be actually held in the hand by a definite\nperson, the great protecting powers, and later the seven kings,\nwere all engaged in a bloodthirsty warfare, which ended in the\nalmost total destruction throughout the empire of the Odes, Rites,\nand the Book in 213 B.C. Remember, however, that the literary\nempire practically meant parts of the modern provinces of Ho Nan\nand Shan Tung. The “Changes” were not destroyed; and as the First\nAugust Emperor himself, his illegitimate father, several of his\nstatesmen, and his visitors the travelling diplomats, were all\neither Taoists or imbued with Taoist doctrines (their sole policy\nbeing to destroy the old ritual and feudal thrones), there is\nground to conjecture that Lao-tsz’s book escaped too, and was\ndeliberately suffered to escape. We know absolutely nothing of\nthat; assuming the truth of the tradition that there was a book,\nwe do not know what became of the first copy, nor how many copies\nwere made of it during the succeeding 300 years. No attempt\nwhatever has ever been made by the serious Chinese historians\nthemselves to manufacture a story. It is, of course, unsatisfactory\nnot to know all the exact truth; but, for the matter of that, the\nexistence, identity, and authorship of Confucius’ pupil and commentator\nTso K’iu-ming, the official historian of Lu, is equally obscure; not to\nmention the history of the earliest Taoist critics who actually mention\nLao-tsz, and quote the words of (if they do not mention) his book.\nWhen we read Renan’s masterly examination into the origins of our\nown Gospels, and when we reflect that even the origin of Shakespeare’s\nplays, and the individuality of Shakespeare’s person, are open to\neverlasting discussion, we may not unreasonably leave Chinese\ncritics and Chinese historians to judge of the value of their own\nnational evidence, and accept in general terms what they tell us\nof fact, however imperfect it may be in detail, without adding\nhypothetical facts or raising new critical difficulties of our own.\nNo such foreign criticisms are or can be worth much unless the\noriginal Chinese histories and the original Chinese philosophers have\nbeen carefully examined by the foreign critic in the original Chinese text.",
        "Consulting the oracles seems to have been a universal practice,\nand there are numerous historical allusions, made by statesmen of\nthe orthodox principalities, to supposed interpretations attached\nto this or that combination of mystic signs or diagrams from the\n\"Changes,” together with arguments as to their specific meaning or\nomen in given circumstances. Doubtless the Chinese of those dates,\nlike our own searchers for religious “analogies” and mysteries,\nexamined with perfect good faith combinations of the Diagrams\nwhich to us appear arrant nonsense; and there can be no doubt of\nConfucius’ own individual zeal, though the fact that he thought\nfifty years’ study at least would be necessary for full\ncomprehension points to the tacit confession that he had totally\nfailed to understand much of the mystery. The Changes are supposed\nto have been developed by the father of the Warrior King when\n(about 1160 B.C.) he was in prison under the tyrannous suspicions\nof the last Shang emperor; and we have seen that the ruler of Ts’u\nwas his tutor, at a time when Ts’u was not yet vassal to\nChou. Like the Odes, Book, and Rites, the Changes were Chou\nliterature, though possibly the unwritten traditions of earlier\ndynasties may have contributed to that literature; which, indeed,\nseems very likely, as Ts’u was already able to teach Chou.",
        "Another form of augury was the examination of the marks on the\ncarapax of a tortoise; thus the Martial King in 146 consulted, and\nfound unfavourable, such marks–this was before attacking the last\nShang emperor; and it was only at the earnest instigation of his\nchief henchman (afterwards vassal king and founder of Ts’i) that\nhe was prevailed upon to proceed. Possibly he borrowed Eastern\nideas from this founder of Ts’i too. Later on, the Martial King’s\nyounger brother, the Duke of Chou, consulted the oracle along with\nthe same Ts’i adviser: this was done before the three ancestral\naltars of their father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, in\norder to ascertain if the Emperor (i.e. the Martial King)\nwould recover from a sickness. In 1109 the Martial King’s son and\nsuccessor sent one of his uncles or near relatives to examine the\nsite of modern Ho-nan Fu, with a view to transferring the\nmetropolis thither, and, the oracles being favourable, the Nine\nTripods were removed to that place, and it was afterwards called\nthe “Eastern Metropolis” (the original or western capital was not\nmoved for over 300 years after that). It was at the same time\nforetold that there would be thirty more reigns, of 700 years in\nall: this was “Heaven’s decree.” On the other hand, when the Duke\nof Chou died during a tempest, the young Emperor was advised not\nto consult the oracles as to what the storm signified, because his\nuncle’s virtues were so manifest that Heaven itself had, by the\nagency of a tempest, spontaneously announced the fact.",
        "Astrology was another form of soothsaying. In 780 B.C. the\nimperial astrologer (one of those two men, by the way, whom\nerroneous tradition 1000 years later confused with Lao-tsz)\nforetold the rise of Ts’i, Tsin, Ts’u, and Ts’in, upon the ruins\nof the imperial power; in 773 the same astrologer repeated the\nprophecy to the imperial prince then recently enfeoffed by his\nrelative the Emperor in the state of CHENG. In 705 the imperial\nastrologer, when passing through the orthodox state of CH’EN,\nforetold from the diagrams that a scion of the CH’EN house would\nobtain the throne of Ts’i (which actually took place when the\nmaire du palais, to the horror of Confucius, assassinated\nthe last legitimate duke in 481 B.C.); this particular prophecy is\ndoubly interesting, because the diagrams from the Changes, thus\ncited in detail in Confucius’ history, correspond exactly with the\ndiagrams of the Book of Changes as we have it now, since Confucius\nmanipulated it–proof that no change has taken place in this part\nof the text at least.",
        "The ruler of Ts’in in the year 762, nine years after receiving the\nwestern half of the Chou imperial domain, and being recognized as\na first-class vassal, consulted the oracle as to whither he should\nmove his own capital. In the year 677 the oracles once more\ndecided the then reigning ruler to shift his capital to (the\nmodern) Feng-siang Fu in West Shen Si; the oracles added: “And\nlater you will water your steeds in the Yellow River\"; which came\nto pass after the conquests and annexations of 643 B.C., as\nalready related. In 374 B.C. the imperial astrologer (the second\nman whom tradition, 300 years later this time, erroneously\nconfused with Lao-tsz) then on a visit to the now royal Ts’in\ncourt said: “After 500 years of separation Ts’in is reunited to\nour imperial house; in 77 years more a domineering monarch will\narise.” Seven years later the “raining down of metal” (probably\nsome natural phenomenon not clearly understood at the time) was\nconsidered a good omen in connection with the new capital, now\nplaced on the south bank of the River Wei. After Ts’in had\nconquered China, there are numerous other instances of oracles,\nomens, and so forth, all supposed to have had political\nsignificance.",
        "In 645 the ruler of the neighbouring state of Tsin consults the\noracles in order to ascertain who will be the most suitable war\ncharioteer. A few years before that the court diviner foretold the\nfuture success of the petty Ngwei sub-principality of Tsin, which\nin 403 B.C. actually became a separate vassal kingdom. In 575 Tsin\ndared not, at the moment, accept the battle challenge of Tsu,\nbecause the particular day was a dies nefas, being the last\nday of the moon. Meanwhile the spies of the Ts’u army discerned\nthat the Tsin leaders were consulting the oracles before the\ntablets of their ancestors in the field tent. In 535 the Ts’in\nadministration consulted its own astrologer upon the point: “Will\nthe state of Ch’en survive?” The answer was: “When it secures\nTs’i, it will perish.” As just explained, a scion of the Ch’en\nhouse did practically obtain Ts’i in 481 B.C., and the very next\nyear Ch’en was annexed by Ts’u. In 510 the Tsin astrologer\nprophesied the destruction of Wu by Yiieh within forty years, and\nalso the predominancy of the Lu private family so intimately\nconnected with Confucius’ troubles. There were not lacking\nsensible men, even in those days, who ridiculed the science of\nastrology: for instance, Shuh Hiang of Tsin–the man who so\nstrongly disapproved Tsz-ch’an’s written laws, and the man who\ndiscussed with the Ts’i envoy, the philosopher Yen-tsz, the\nworthlessness of their respective dukes–said on one occasion when\nthe “course of the heavens towards north-west” was supposed to\nindicate a success for Tsin: “The course of the heavens, as that\nof our success, lies in the qualities of the prince, and not in\nthe situation of the stars.”",
        "Tsz-ch’an of Cheng himself pooh-poohed oracular warnings, and said\nthat he preferred to do his best, and leave omens to do their\nworst. On one occasion, outside the south gate of the Cheng\ncapital, two snakes (one from the city, one from outside) were\nobserved fighting; the one from the inside was defeated. Sure\nenough! the exiled duke six years after that returned to his own.\nSo, in the state of Lu, the children sang: “When the thrushes come\nand make their nests, the ruler will go to a place on the Tsin\nfrontier; when the thrushes settle here, the duke will be abroad\"–\nin allusion to the future ejecting of the reigning prince by the\npowerful family above referred to. And, again (480 B.C.), in the\nstate of Sung, whose terrestrial position was supposed to be\n\"invaded” by the then peculiar celestial position of the planet\nMars: it was suggested, however, to the ruling prince that he\nmight “pass on” the threatened disaster to his ministers, to his\npeople, or to their harvests–a solution the duke declined to\navail himself of. ’Yours are indeed the words of a sage,’ said the\nastrologer.",
        "We now come to the semi-civilized state of Ts’u, which seems to\nhave had its oracles with the best of them, at all events after\n560 B.C. At that date it was explained to the King that “the\nancient emperors would at times consult the oracles for five years\nbefore deciding upon an expedition, or fixing the date of it; they\nwere content to await patiently the decrees of Heaven.” In 537 the\nTs’u king, having a prince of Wu in his power, sent to ask him\nironically if he had duly consulted the oracles. “Yes,” said the\nprince, “every ruler has his tortoise, and it is easy to\ndemonstrate by our oracles how injurious it will be for you if any\nharm comes to me.” This presence of mind saved his life. In 528 a\nTs’u usurper invited a man who had once assisted him to name any\npost he would like. The man chose that of diviner, which, it\nappears, was an office of the first rank. The father of this king\nhad secretly arranged with a concubine, notwithstanding the Ts’u\nrule (or possibly in accordance with it) that one of the youngest\nsons should succeed, to “sacrifice from a distance to the gods in\ngeneral, and ask of them which of five sons should sacrifice to\nthe spirits of the land\"; then he buried a jade symbol of rule in\nthe ancestral temple, and ordered the five sons to enter after\nproper purification; the three sons who happened to touch the spot\nreigned one after the other. In 489 the King of Ts’u, then engaged\nin assisting the orthodox state of Ch’en against the attacks of\nWu, interrogated the imperial astrologer (who must have been there\non a visit): “What is the meaning of that halo, like a bird’s\nwings, on each side of the sun?” The astrologer replied: “It\npresages calamity, but you can transfer it to your generals.” The\ngenerals then offered to consult the gods themselves, and even to\nsacrifice their own persons if necessary; but the King declined\n(on the same ground as the Duke of Sung above mentioned) because\n\"my generals are my own limbs.” It was then proposed to transfer\nthe calamity to the Yellow River. “No, the Yellow River has never\nplayed me false: ever since we received our fief, we have never at\nfull moon sacrificed beyond the River Han and Yang-tsz.” Confucius\nregistered his approval of this answer. It will be remembered that\njust at this time Confucius was hanging about Ch’Uen and coquetting\nwith Ts’u, so that possibly this approval had something to do with\nhis own prospects.",
        "In recording these instances of prophecies and omens (which might\nbe multiplied tenfold), it is desired to show how one main set of\nideas pervaded the whole. We should not be too ready to ridicule\nthem, or to hint at “after the event.” Our own Scriptures are full\nof similar prophecies, and what is good for us is good for the\nChinese. If the celestial movements can be foretold, why not\ncorresponding terrestrial movements, each corner of the earth\nbeing on the meridian of something? In the infancy of science, it\nis rather a question of good faith than of truth; and even the\ntruth, if we insist on expecting it, was rudely guessed at by such\ngreat thinkers as Tsz-ch’an and Shuh Hiang.",
        "A feature of the times was the remarkably personal character of\nthe wars, and the apparent utter indifference to humble popular\ninterests; Quidquid delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi; stress\nis laid upon this point by the democratic philosopher Lao-tsz, who,\nhowever, in his book (be it genuine or not), is wise enough never\nto name a person or place; probably that prudence saved it from\nthe flames in 213 B.C.",
        "In 684 B.C. the ruler of Ts’ai (imperial clan) treated very rudely\nhis own wife’s sister, married to a petty prince (imperial clan)\nclose by; the sister was simply passing through as a traveller;\nthe result was that this petty prince, her husband, induced Ts’u\nto make war upon Ts’ai, whose reigning prince was captured, and\ndied a prisoner. In 657 the ruler of Ts’ai had a sister\nmarried in Ts’i. The First Protector, offended at some act of\nplayful disobedience, sent her back, but without actually\ndivorcing her. Her brother was so angry that he found her another\nhusband. On this Ts’i declared war, and captured the brother, who,\nhowever, at the intercession of the other vassal princes, was\nrestored to his kingdom. In 509 and 506 B.C. Ts’ai induces Tsin to\nmake war on Ts’u, and also assists Wu in her hostilities against\nTs’u, because a Ts’u minister had detained the ruler of Ts’ai for\nrefusing to part with a handsome fur coat. It is like the stealing\nof the Golden Fleece by Jason, and similar Greek squabbles. In 675\nB.C. the Emperor, for the third time, had to fly from his capital,\nthe immediate cause of the trouble being an attempt on his part to\nseize a vassal’s rice-field for including in his own park–a\nChinese version of the Naboth’s vineyard dispute. Nothing could\nbetter prove the pettiness of the ancient state-horizon; no busily\nactive great power could find time for such trifles.",
        "When the Second Protector came to the throne, the orthodox states\nof Wei, Ts’ao, and Cheng (all of the imperial clan), which had\ntreated him scurvily as a wanderer, had all three of them to pay\ndearly for their meanness. In 632, when the Protector had secured\nthe Tsin throne, the ruler of Ts’ao was promptly captured, and\npart of his territory was given to Sung (where the wanderer had\nbeen well treated). The same year Tsin wished to assist Sung, and\naccordingly asked right of way through the state of Wei, which was\ncurtly refused; the Tsin army therefore crossed the Yellow River\nto the south of Wei: as a punishment for this refusal, and also\nfor the previous rude treatment, Wei also had to give part of her\nterritory to the favoured Sung. In 630 Tsin induced Ts’in to join\nin an attack upon Cheng, the object being, of course, to revenge\nsimilar personal rudenesses; however, Cheng diplomacy was\nsuccessful in inducing Ts’in to abandon Tsin in the nick of time:\nthis was one of the very few cases in which Ts’in interfered, or\nwas about to interfere, in “orthodox” affairs. In 592 Tsin sent a\nhunchback envoy to Ts’i; it so happened that at the same time Lu\nsent one who was lame, and Wei a third who was blind of one eye.\nThe Ts’i ruler thereupon appointed an officer mutilated in some\nother way to do the duties of host to this sorry trio. The Tsin\nenvoy swore: “If I do not revenge this upon Ts’i, may the God of\nthe Yellow River take note of it!” Reaching his own country, he\ntried to induce the ruler to make war on Ts’i; but the prince\nsaid: “Your personal pique should hardly suffice for ground to\ntrouble the whole country”: and he refused.",
        "The principle of the divinity that doth hedge a king was early\nestablished, but there are certainly more numerous evidences of\nroyal absolutism in Ts’u than in orthodox China, where responsibility\nof rulers before Heaven and the People (symbolical of Heaven also)\nwas an accepted axiom. For instance, in 522 B.C., an officer, knowing\nthat the King of Ts’u was sending for him in order to kill him, said to his\nbrother: “As the king orders it, one of us two must go, but you can\navenge me later on.” When the next Ts’u king was a fugitive, and it\nwas a question in a subject’s mind of killing him because his father\nhad taken a brother’s life, it was objected: “No! if the king slays one\nof his officers, who can avenge it? His commands emanate from Heaven.\nIt is unpardonable to cut off the ancestral sacrifice of a whole house\nin this way.”",
        "In still more ancient times, when the last Emperor of the Shang\ndynasty was being warned of the rising popular feeling in favour\nof the rising Chou power, he remarked: “Have I not Heaven’s\nmandate? What can they do to me?” When the Martial King achieved\nhis conquest, he smeared the god of the soil with the sacrificial\nvictims’ blood, and announced the crimes of the dead tyrant to\nHeaven. In the war of 589 between Tsin and Ts’i, the ruler of\nTs’i, who had changed places with his charioteer in order to\nescape detection, was hotly pursued; but his chariot caught in a\ntree. Seeing this, the Tsin captain prostrated himself before the\nchariot, and said: “My princely master’s orders are to assist the\nstates of Lu and Wei” (i.e. not to attack your person). Meanwhile\nthe disguised charioteer ordered the disguised king to fetch a\ndrink of water, and the king thus escaped even the humiliation of\na favour from his generous victor. When in 548 a worthless Ts’i\nruler was assassinated, the philosopher Yen-tsz said: “When the\nruler dies or is exiled for the gods of the land and its harvests,\none dies or is exiled with him; but if he dies or is exiled for\nprivate reasons, then only his personal friends die with him.” He\ntherefore contented himself with wailing, and with laying his head\non the royal body. The same Tsin captain who was so tender to the\nTs’i duke in 589 had an opportunity fourteen years later of taking\nprisoner the ruler of CHENG in battle; but he said: “Evil cometh\nto him who toucheth a crowned head! I have already committed\nsacrilege once against the ruler of Ts’i; preserve me from\ncommitting this crime a second time!” And he turned promptly back.\nDuring the same fight, the King of Ts’u’s body-guard was attacked\nby the Tsin generalissimo, who, when he discerned the king in the\ncentre of the guards, got out of his chariot, doffed his helmet,\nand fled in horror, “such was his respect for the person of\nroyalty.” It was a ritual rule in China for the distinguished men\nnot to remove the official head-covering in death; for instance,\nin 481, when one of Confucius’ pupils was killed in war, his last\npatriotic act was to tie his hat-strings tighter. Though rulers\nwere supposed to owe duties to the gods in general, yet the power\nof the gods was limited. Thus when Tsz-ch’an of CHENG was sent as\nenvoy to Tsin in 541, the sick Tsin ruler asked him: “How can the\ntwo gods who, they say, are responsible for my malady, be\nconjured?” Tsz-ch’an replied: “These particular gods cannot injure\nyou; we sacrifice to them in connection with natural phenomena,\nsuch as drought, flood, or other disaster; just as in matters of\nsnow, hail, rain, or wind we sacrifice to the gods of the sun,\nmoon, planets, and constellations. Your illness is the result of\ndrink, over-feeding, women, passionate anger, excessive pleasure.\"\nShuh Hiang approved this common-sense view of the situation.",
        "In the spring of the year 536 B.C., Tsz-ch’an, one of the leading\nstatesmen in the Chinese Federal Union, decided to publish for\npopular information the Criminal Law which had hitherto been\nsimply “declared” by the various rulers and their officers\naccording to the circumstances of each case. At this time the\ndifferent premiers and ministers used to visit each other freely,\ngenerally in the suite of the reigning prince who happened to be\neither receiving or paying a visit from or to some other vassal\nprince. The Emperor himself, now shorn of his power, was only\nprimus inter pares amongst these princes. Shuh Hiang, one\nof the ministers at the neighbouring court of Tsin, addressed the\nfollowing remarkable letter to the colleague above mentioned who\nhad introduced the legal innovation. It is published in\nexteso in Confucius’ own history of the times, as expanded\nby one of his pupils:–",
        "“At first I used to regard you as a guide, but now all this is at\nan end. Our monarchs in past times were wont to decide matters by\nspecific ordinance, and had no prepared statutes, fearing lest the\npeople should grow contentious. Yet even so it was impossible to\nsuppress wrong-doing; for which reason they employed justice as a\npreventive, administration to bring things into line, external\nformality to secure respect, good faith as an abiding principle,\nand kindness in actual treatment. They appointed certain ranks and\nemoluments with a view to encouraging their officers to follow the\ncourse thus sketched out for them, and they fixed certain stern\npunishments and fines in order to fill these officers with a dread\nof arbitrariness, fearing that otherwise they might fail in their\nduty. Thus admonition was given with every loyalty; fear was\ninspired by personal example; instruction was conveyed as occasion\nrequired; employment in service was accompanied by suavity;\ncontact with inferiors was marked by a respectful demeanour; the\nexecutive arm was firmly applied; and decisions were carried out\nwith virility. Yet, with all this, it was never too easy to secure\nwise and saintly (vassal) princes, clever and discriminating\nministers, loyal and trusty officials, or kind and affectionate\ninstructors. Under these circumstances, however, it was possible\nto set the people going, and China was at least free from\nrevolution and misery.",
        "“But when the people themselves become cognizant of a written law,\nthey will cease to fear their superiors, and, moreover, they will\nacquire a contentious spirit. Having book to refer to, they will\nemploy every device to elude the letter of the law. This will not\ndo at all. It was only in times of anarchical rule that the\nfounders of the Hia and Shang dynasties (2200 B.C. and 1760 B.C.)\nfound it necessary to issue (to their officers) the collections of\nlaws which still bear their two respective names; and it was also\nonly in anarchical times (1000 B.C.) that one Emperor of our\npresent dynasty found it necessary to publish (for his officers)\nthe so-called Nine Laws. In other words, the advent of written law\nhas on all three occasions connoted a decay in government. You,\nsir, are the chief minister of CHENG state (part of modern\nHo Nan); you made a few years ago some new regulations about the\nparcelling of land; next you placed the system of your taxation on\na fresh basis; and you now proceed to embody the three special\ncollections just cited in a new popular code, which you have had\ncast in metal characters. If you are doing it with a view to\npacify the people, surely you will not find this an easy matter?\nThe ’Book of Odes’ says: ’King Wen (the virtual founder,\n2200 B.C., of the then reigning Chou dynasty) took virtue as his\nguide, and thus gradually pacified the four quarters of the\nworld.’ It also says: ’The methods of King Wu (son of the\nvirtual founder) secured the confidence of all the other\ncountries.’ Where were the written laws in those times? When\npeople begin to get the contentious spirit upon them, they will\nhave done with the principles of propriety, and only stickle for\nthe letter; they will haggle upon every tiny point accessible to\nknife’s edge or awl’s tip. We shall witness a flood of litigious\naccusations; bribery and corruption will be rampant. Do you think\nthe state of Cheng will last out your life? I have heard it\nsaid: ’When a country is about to collapse, there are many\nconflicting administrative changes.’ Will this apply to present\nconditions?”",
        "The reply returned was:-",
        "“With regard to what my honourable friend has been pleased to say,\nI am afraid my humble capacities are not sufficiently great to\ntake the interests of posterity; my action has been taken in the\ninterests of the state as I find it, and as I have to govern it.\nThough, therefore, I cannot accept tour commands, I shall be\ncareful not to forget your kindness in proffering advice.”",
        "Though the exact words of the above-mentioned Code in Brass have\nnot come down to us, they are (like the Twelve Tables of Rome,\neighty years later in date, were in relation to Roman jurisprudence)\nthe foundation of Chinese Criminal Law as it exists to-day, modified,\nof course, dynasty by dynasty. At this time Confucius was a mere\nyouth; but later on, as minister of a third vassal state, that of Lu, he\nalso expressed his disapproval of a written code, much though he\nrespected the author, whom he knew personally. Shuh Hiang’s letter\nis of interest as showing the pitch of philosophy, common-sense, and\ninternational courtesy to which the statesmen of China had attained\n2400 years ago.",
        "In 539 B.C. the Ts’i statesman and philosopher Yen-tsz was sent on\na mission to Tsin in order to negotiate a political marriage. At\nthis period Han K’i, also called Han Suean-tsz, was the premier of\nTsin, and he despatched the minister Shuh Hiang with a complimentary\nmessage to the Ts’i envoy, accepting the offer of a suitable wife. At\nthis time the diplomatic relations of the Chinese states were particularly\ninteresting, because, apart from the fact that intellectual premiers ruled\nall the great states, most of them were personal friends, acquaintances,\nor correspondents of Confucius, who has left on record his judgment\nupon each. After the official marriage negotiations were over, Shuh\nHiang ordered refreshments, and he and Yen-tsz sat down to a nice\nquiet little chat by themselves.",
        "Shuh Hiang. How is Ts’i going on?",
        "Yen-tsz. These are bad times. I don’t know what I can say\nabout Ts’i, except that it appears to be falling into the hands of\nthe CH’EN family. The prince neglects his people, and consequently\nthey turn to the CH’EN family for protection. In former times Ts’i\nhad three grain measures, each a four multiple of the other–etc.\nfour pints, sixteen pints, sixty-four pints–and finally there was\na large measure containing ten times the last, or 640 pints (or\nlitres); but the three measures of the CH’EN family have each been\nraised by one unit, so that three successive fives multiplied by\nten give 800 pints, and their plan is to make loans of grain with\ntheir private 8oo-pint measure, and then to take back payments in\nthe prince’s measure. The wood from the mountains is sold in the\nmarket-place as cheaply as on the mountains; fish, salt, clams,\nand cockles are sold in the market-place as cheaply as on the\nshore. On the other hand, two-thirds of the produce of the\npeople’s labour go to the prince, whilst only one-third remains\nfor the sustenance of the producers. The prince’s stores rot away,\nwhilst our old men die of starvation. False feet are cheaper than\nshoes in the market-place (owing to the number of people punished\nwith amputation of a foot); the people are smarting with a sense\nof wrong, and are longing for the advent (of the CH’EN family),\nwhom they love as a parent, and towards whom they tend, just as\nwater runs downhill. Under these circumstances, even if they did\nnot want to gain the people over, how can they avoid it? The last\nsurviving member of that branch of the CH’EN family who traced his\ndescent to previous dynasties has still left his spirit in the\nland of Ts’i, though the representatives of the family are\nnominally subjects of Ts’i.",
        "Shuh Hiang. Yes. And even our ruling house of Tsin has\nfallen on degenerate times. Armies are no longer equipped, and our\nstatesmen are not ready for war. There is no one to lead the\nchariots, and our battalions have no competent commanders. The\ncommon people are utterly exhausted, whilst the extravagance of\nthe palace is unbounded. The starving folk line the roads, whilst\nmoney is squandered upon female favourites. The commands of the\nprince are received by the people as though they longed to escape\nthe clutches of a bandit. The representatives of the eight leading\nfamilies who have served the state so long and faithfully are\nreduced to the most insignificant offices. Government is\nadministered in certain private interests, and the people have no\none to whom to appeal. The ruler shows no sign of amendment, and\nendeavours to drown his cares in excessive indulgence. When did\nthe ruling house ever before reach the low depths of to-day? The\nwarning oracle inscribed on the tripod says: “However early you\nmay get to zealous work, your descendants may be lazy.” How much\nmore, in the case of a man who will not reform, is disaster likely\nto be impending soon!",
        "Yen-tsz. What do you propose to do?",
        "Shuh Hiang. The ruling house of Tsin is about exhausted. I\nhave heard it said that when a ruling house is about to fall, its\nfamily members drop off first, like the branches and leaves of a\nstricken tree; and the ruler himself, like the trunk, follows\nsuit. Take my own stock, for instance, which formerly contained\neleven family or clan names. The Sheepstongue (cf, English\nSheepshanks) clan is my clan, and the only one now left; and I\nmyself have no son fit to be my heir. The ruling house is\narbitrary and capricious, so that, even if I am fortunate enough\nto die in my bed myself, I shall have no one to perform the\nsacra for me.",
        "In 513 B.C. two generals of the Tsin state carried their arms into\nthe Luh-hun reservation (in modern Ho Nan province), whither, in\n638 B.C., the Tartar tribe of that name had been brought to settle\nby agreement between the two Chinese powers whose territories\n(Ts’in and Tsin) ran with the Tartars; “and then they drew upon\nTsin state for four cwt. of iron, in order to cast a punishment\ntripod upon which to inscribe the law-book composed by Fan Suean-\ntsz (a minister).” Confucius said:–",
        "“It looks as though Tsin were about to perish, as it has made a\nmistake in its calculations. The state of Tsin ought to govern its\npeople by maintaining the ancient laws and ordinances received by\ntheir ancestor who was first enfeoffed there (in 1120 B.C.), when\nthe officers of state would each observe the same in their degree.\nThus the people would know how to respect their superiors, and the\nruling classes would be in a position to maintain their\npatrimonies. The proper balance between superior classes and\ncommoners is what we call ’ordinance.’ The ruling prince W&n (who\nassumed the Protectorship of China in 632 B.C.) for this reason\nestablished an official body of dignitaries, and organized the\nannual spring revision of the laws of his ancestors as Representative\nFederal Prince. Now Tsin abandons this system, and makes a tripod,\nwhich tripod–will henceforth govern the people’s acts. How can they\nnow respect their superiors (having book to go by)? How can the\nsuperiors maintain their patrimonies? If superiors and commoners\nconfuse degree, how can the state go on? Moreover, Suean-tsz’s\npunishments date from the spring revision (of 621 B.C.), when confusion\nand change was going on in Tsin state; how can they take this as a\nfit precedent?”",
        "About twenty-five centuries ago–in 546 B.C., to be precise–the\nChinese Powers had a “Hague Conference” with a view to the\nreduction of armaments. This is how Confucius’ pupil, Tso K’iu-\nming, tells the story in the “Tso Chwan,” or expanded version of\nConfucius’ “Springs and Autumns” (for convenience the names of the\nancient States are changed to those of the modern provinces\ncorresponding with them):–",
        "“A statesman of Ho Nan, being on friendly terms with his\ncolleagues of Shan Si and Hu P&h, conceived the idea of making a\nname for himself by proposing a cessation of armaments. He went\nfirst to Shan Si, and interviewed the Premier there; the Premier\nconsulted his colleagues in the Shan Si ministry, and one of them\nsaid: ’War is ruinous to the people, and a fearful waste of\nwealth; it is the curse of the smaller Powers. Although the idea\nwill come to nothing, we must consent to a conference; otherwise\nHu P&h will consent to it first, in order to gain favour with the\nPowers, and thus we shall lose the predominant position we now\noccupy.’ So Shan Si consented.",
        "“Then (the narrative continues) Hu Peh was visited, and also\nconsented. Then Shan Tung (the German sphere now). Shan Tung did\nnot like the idea; but one of the Shan Tung Ministers said: ’Shan\nSi and Hu P&h have agreed, and we have no help for it. Besides,\nthe world will say that there would be a cessation of armaments\nwere it not for our refusal, and thus our own people will vote\nagainst us. What is the use of that?’ So Shan Tung consented. Next\nShen Si was notified. Shen Si also consented. Then the whole four\ngreat Powers notified the minor States, and a great durbar (of\nfourteen States) was held at a minor court in Ho Nan.”",
        "The curious part of it all is that the representative of the\nEmperor (whose political position was not unlike that of the Popes\nin Europe since 1870) did not appear at the Conference at all,\nthough all the Great Powers maintained the fiction of granting\nprecedence to the Emperor and his nuncios, and even went through\nthe form of accepting investiture from him and taking tribute\npresents to the Imperial Court-when it suited them.",
        "This celebrated Peace Conference closed the seventy-two years of\nalmost incessant war that had been going on between Tsin and Ts’in\n(Shan Si and Shen Si), apart from the subsidiary war between Tsin\nand Ts’u (Hu Peh).",
