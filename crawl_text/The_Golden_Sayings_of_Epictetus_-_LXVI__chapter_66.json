        "We see that a carpenter becomes a carpenter by learning\ncertain things: that a pilot, by learning certain things, becomes\na pilot. Possibly also in the present case the mere desire to be\nwise and good is not enough. It is necessary to learn certain\nthings. This is then the object of our search. The Philosophers\nwould have us first learn that there is a God, and that His\nProvidence directs the Universe; further, that to hide from Him\nnot only one’s acts but even one’s thoughts and intentions is\nimpossible; secondly, what the nature of God is. Whatever that\nnature is discovered to be, the man who would please and obey Him\nmust strive with all his might to be made like unto Him. If the\nDivine is faithful, he also must be faithful; if free, he also\nmust be free; if beneficent, he also must be beneficent; if\nmagnanimous, he also must be magnanimous. Thus as an imitator of\nGod must he follow Him in every deed and word.",
