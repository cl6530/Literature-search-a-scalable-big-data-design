        "Soon as the valiant Dankwart / stood beneath the door,\nBade he Etzel’s followers / all make way before.\nWith blood from armor streaming / did there the hero stand;\nA sharp and mighty weapon / bore he naked in his hand.",
        "1952",
        "Into the hall then Dankwart / cried with voice full strong:\n“At table, brother Hagen, / thou sittest all too long.\nTo thee and God in heaven / must I sore complain:\nKnights and squires also / lie within their lodging slain.”",
        "1953",
        "Straight he cried in answer: / “Who hath done such deed?\"\n“That hath done Sir Bloedel / and knights that he did lead.\nEke made he meet atonement, / that may’st thou understand:\nHis head from off his body / have I struck with mine own hand.”",
        "1954",
        "“’Tis little cause for sorrow,\" / Hagen spake again,\n“When they tell the story / of a valiant thane,\nThat he to death was smitten / by knight of high degree.\nThe less a cause for weeping / to winsome women shall it be.",
        "1955",
        "“Now tell me, brother Dankwart, / how thou so red may’st be;\nFrom thy wounds thou sufferest, / I ween, full grievously.\nLives he within this country / who serves thee in such way,\nHim must the devil shelter, / or for the deed his life shall pay.”",
        "1956",
        "“Behold me here all scatheless. / My gear is wet with blood,\nFrom wounds of others, natheless, / now hath flowed that flood,\nOf whom this day so many / beneath my broadsword fell:\nMust I make solemn witness, / ne’er knew I full the tale to tell.”",
        "1957",
        "He answered: “Brother Dankwart, / now take thy stand before,\nAnd Huns let never any / make passage by the door.\nI’ll speak unto these warriors, / as needs must spoken be:\nDead lie all our followers, / slain by foulest treachery.”",
        "1958",
        "“Must I here be chamberlain,\" / replied the warrior keen,\n“Well know I such high monarchs / aright to serve, I ween.\nSo will I guard the stairway / as sorts with honor well.\"\nNe’er to the thanes of Kriemhild / so sorry case before befell.",
        "1959",
        "“To me ’tis mickle wonder,\" / Hagen spake again,\n“What thing unto his neighbor / whispers each Hunnish thane.\nI ween they’d forego the service / of him who keeps the door,\nAnd who such high court tidings / to his friends of Burgundy bore.",
        "1960",
        "“Long since of Lady Kriemhild / the story I did hear,\nHow unavenged her sorrow / she might no longer bear.\nA memory-cup now quaff we / and pay for royal cheer!\nThe youthful lord of Hunland / shall make the first instalment here.”",
        "1961",
        "Thereat the child Ortlieb / doughty Hagen slew,\nThat from the sword downward / the blood to hand-grip flew,\nAnd into lap of Kriemhild / the severed head down rolled.\nThen might ye see ’mid warriors / a slaughter great and grim unfold.",
        "1962",
        "By both hands swiftly wielded, / his blade then cut the air\nAnd smote upon the tutor / who had the child in care,\nThat down before the table / his head that instant lay:\nIt was a sorry payment / wherewith he did the tutor pay.",
        "1963",
        "His eye ’fore Etzel’s table / a minstrel espied:\nTo whom in hasty manner / did wrathful Hagen stride,\nWhere moved it on the fiddle / his right hand off smote he;\n“Have that for thy message / unto the land of Burgundy.”",
        "1964",
        "“Alack my hand!” did Werbel / that same minstrel moan;\n“What, Sir Hagen of Tronje, / have I to thee done?\nI bore a faithful message / unto thy master’s land.\nHow may I more make music / thus by thee bereft of hand?”",
        "1965",
        "Little in sooth recked Hagen, / fiddled he nevermore.\nThen in the hall all wrathful / wrought he havoc sore\nUpon the thanes of Etzel / whereof he many slew;\nEre they might find exit, / to death then smote he not a few.",
        "1966",
        "Volker the full valiant / up sprang from board also:\nIn his hand full clearly / rang out his fiddle-bow,\nFor mightily did fiddle / Gunther’s minstrel thane.\nWhat host of foes he made him / because of Hunnish warriors slain!",
        "1967",
        "Eke sprang from the table / the lofty monarchs three,\nWho glad had stilled the combat / ere greater scathe might be.\nYet all their art availed not / their anger to assuage,\nWhen Volker and Hagen / so mightily began to rage.",
        "1968",
        "When the lord of Rhineland / saw how his toil was vain,\nGaping wounds full many / himself did smite amain\nThrough rings of shining mail-coats / there upon the foe.\nHe was a valiant hero, / as he full gallantly did show.",
        "1969",
        "Strode eke into the combat / Gernot a doughty thane;\nBy whom of Hunnish warriors / full many a one was slain\nWith a sword sharp-edged / he had of Ruediger;\nOft sent to dire ruin / by him the knights of Etzel were.",
        "1970",
        "The youthful son of Ute / eke to the combat sprang,\nAnd merrily his broadsword / upon the helmets rang\nOf many a Hunnish warrior / there in Etzel’s land;\nFeasts of mickle wonder / wrought Giselher with dauntless hand.",
        "1971",
        "How bold soe’er was any, / of kings and warrior band,\nSaw ye yet the foremost / Giselher to stand\nThere against the foemen, / a knight of valor good;\nWounded deep full many / made he to fall in oozing blood.",
        "1972",
        "Eke full well defend them / did Etzel’s warriors too.\nThere might ye see the strangers / their gory way to hew\nWith swords all brightly gleaming / adown that royal hall;\nHeard ye there on all sides / loudly ring the battle-call.",
        "1973",
        "Join friends within beleaguered / would they without full fain,\nYet might they at the portal / but little vantage gain.\nEke they within had gladly / gained the outer air;\nNor up nor down did Dankwart / suffer one to pass the stair.",
        "1974",
        "There before the portal / surged a mighty throng,\nAnd with a mickle clangor / on helm the broadsword rung.\nThus on the valiant Dankwart / his foes did sorely press,\nAnd soon his trusty brother / was anxious grown o’er his distress.",
        "1975",
        "Full loudly cried then Hagen / unto Volker:\n“Trusty fere, behold’st thou / my brother standing there,\nWhere on him Hunnish warriors / their mighty blows do rain?\nGood friend, save thou my brother / ere we do lose the valiant thane.”",
        "1976",
        "“That will I do full surely,\" / thereat the minstrel spake.\nAdown the hall he fiddling / gan his way to make;\nIn his hand full often / a trusty sword rang out,\nWhile grateful knights of Rhineland / acclaimed him with a mickle shout.",
        "1977",
        "Soon did the valiant Volker / Dankwart thus address:\n“Hard this day upon thee / hath weighed the battle’s stress.\nThat I should come to help thee / thy brother gave command;\nKeep thou without the portal, / I inward guarding here will stand.”",
        "1978",
        "Dankwart, thane right valiant, / stood without the door\nAnd guarded so the stairway / that none might pass before.\nThere heard ye broadswords ringing, / swung by warrior’s hand,\nWhile inward in like manner / wrought Volker of Burgundian land.",
        "1979",
        "There the valiant Fiddler / above the press did call:\n“Securely now, friend Hagen, / closed is the hall.\nYea, so firmly bolted / is King Etzel’s door\nBy hands of two good warriors, / as thousand bars were set before,”",
        "1980",
        "When Hagen thus of Tronje / the door did guarded find,\nThe warrior far renowned / swung his shield behind;\nHe first for harm received / revenge began to take,\nWhereat all hope of living / did soon his enemies forsake.",
        "1981",
        "When of Bern Sir Dietrich / rightly did perceive\nHow the doughty Hagen / did many a helmet cleave,\nThe king of Amelungen / upon a bench leaped up;\nQuoth he: “Here poureth Hagen / for us exceeding bitter cup.”",
        "1982",
        "Great fear fell eke on Etzel, / as well might be the case,\n(What trusty followers snatched they / to death before his face!)\nFor well nigh did his enemies / on him destruction bring.\nThere sat he all confounded. / What booted him to be a king?",
        "1983",
        "Cried then aloud to Dietrich / Kriemhild, the high lady:\n“Now help me, knight so noble, / that hence with life I flee,\nBy princely worth, I pray thee, / thou lord of Amelung’s land;\nIf here do reach me Hagen, / straight find I death beneath his hand.”",
        "1984",
        "“How may my help avail thee, / noble queen and high?\"\nAnswered her Sir Dietrich, / “Fear for myself have I.\nToo sorely is enraged / each knight in Gunther’s band,\nTo no one at this season / may I lend assisting hand.”",
        "1985",
        "“But nay, but nay, Sir Dietrich, / full noble knight and keen,\nWhat maketh thy bright chivalry, / let it this day be seen,\nAnd bring me hence to safety, / else am I death’s sure prey.\"\nGood cause was that on Kriemhild’s / bosom fear so heavy lay.",
        "1986",
        "“So will I here endeavor / to help thee as I may;\nYet shalt thou well believe me, / hath passed full many a day\nSince saw I goodly warriors / of so bitter mood.\n’Neath swords behold I flowing / through helmets plenteously the blood.”",
        "1987",
        "Lustily then cried he, / the warrior nobly born,\nThat his voice rang loudly / like blast from bison’s horn,\nThat all around the palace / gave back the lusty sound;\nUnto the might of Dietrich / never limit yet was found.",
        "1988",
        "When did hear King Gunther / how called the doughty man\nAbove the storm of combat, / to hearken he began.\nQuoth he: “The voice of Dietrich / hath fallen upon mine ear;\nI ween some of his followers / before our thanes have fallen here.",
        "1989",
        "“High on the board I see him; / he beckons with the hand.\nNow my good friends and kinsmen / of Burgundian land,\nStay ye your hands from conflict, / let us hear and see\nIf done upon the chieftain / aught by my men of scathe there be.”",
        "1990",
        "When thus King Gunther / did beg and eke command,\nWith swords in stress of battle / stayed they all the hand.\n’Twas token of his power / that straight the strife did pause.\nThen him of Bern he questioned / what of his outcry were the cause.",
        "1991",
        "He spake: “Full noble Dietrich, / what here on thee is wrought\nBy any of my warriors? / For truly is my thought\nTo make a full atonement / and amends to thee.\nIf here hath wronged thee any, / ’twere cause of mickle grief to me.”",
        "1992",
        "Then answered him Sir Dietrich: / “Myself do nothing grieve.\nGrant me with thy protection / but this hall to leave\nAnd quit the dire conflict, / with them that me obey.\nThen surely will I ever / seek thy favor to repay.”",
        "1993",
        "“How plead’st thou thus so early?\" / Wolfhart was heard;\n“The Fiddler so securely / the door not yet hath barred,\nBut it so wide we’ll open / to pass it through, I trow.\"\n“Now hold thy peace,” quoth Dietrich, / “wrought but little here hast\n      thou.”",
        "1994",
        "Then spake the royal Gunther: / “That grant I thee to do,\nForth from the hall lead many / or lead with thee few,\nAn if my foes it be not; / here stay they every one.\nUpon me here in Hunland / hath grievous wrong by them been done.”",
        "1995",
        "When heard he Gunther’s answer / he took beneath his arm\nThe noble Queen Kriemhild, / who dreaded mickle harm.\nOn the other side too led he / Etzel with him away;\nEke went thence with Dietrich / six hundred knights in fair array.",
        "1996",
        "Then outspake the margrave, / the noble Ruediger:\n“If leave to any others / be granted forth to fare,\nOf those who glad would serve you, / give us the same to see.\nYea, peace that’s never broken / ’twixt friends ’tis meet should ever\n      be.”",
        "1997",
        "Thereto gave answer Giselher / of the land of Burgundy:\n“Peace and unbroken friendship / wish we e’er with thee,\nWith thee and all thy kinsmen, / as true thou ever art.\nWe grant thee all untroubled / with thy friends from hence to part.”",
        "1998",
        "When thus Sir Ruediger / from the hall did pass,\nA train of knights five hundred / or more with him there was,\nOf them of Bechelaren, / kinsmen and warriors true,\nWhose parting gave King Gunther / anon full mickle cause to rue.",
        "1999",
        "When did a Hunnish warrior / Etzel’s passing see\n’Neath the arm of Dietrich, / to profit him thought he.\nSmote him yet the Fiddler / such a mighty blow,\nThat ’fore the feet of Etzel / sheer on the floor his head fell low.",
        "2000",
        "When the country’s monarch / had gained the outer air,\nTurned he looking backward / and gazed on Volker.\n“Alack such guests to harbor! / Ah me discomfited!\nThat all the knights that serve me / shall before their might lie dead.",
        "2001",
        "“Alack their coming hither!\" / spake the king once more.\n“Within, a warrior fighteth / like to wild forest boar;\nHight the same is Volker, / and a minstrel is also;\nTo pass the demon scatheless / I to fortune’s favor owe.",
        "2002",
        "“Evil sound his melodies, / his strokes of bow are red,\nYea, beneath his music / full many a knight lies dead.\nI know not what against us / hath stirred that player’s ire,\nFor guests ne’er had I any / whereby to suffer woe so dire.”",
        "2003",
        "None other would they suffer / to pass the door than those.\nThen ’neath the hall’s high roof-tree / a mighty din arose.\nFor evil wrought upon them / those guests sore vengeance take.\nVolker the doughty Fiddler, / what shining helmets there he brake!",
        "2004",
        "Gunther, lofty monarch, / thither turned his ear.\n“Hear’st thou the music, Hagen, / that yonder Volker\nDoth fiddle for the Hun-men, / when near the door they go?\nThe stroke is red of color, / where he doth draw the fiddle-bow.”",
        "2005",
        "“Mickle doth it rue me,\" / Hagen spake again,\n“That in the hall far severed / I am from that bold thane.\nI was his boon companion / and he sworn friend to me:\nCome we hence ever scatheless, / trusty feres we yet shall be.",
        "2006",
        "“Behold now, lofty sire, / the faith of Volker bold!\nWith will he seeks to win him / thy silver and thy gold.\nWith fiddle-bow he cleaveth / e’en the steel so hard,\nBright-gleaming crests of helmets / are scattered by his mighty sword.",
        "2007",
        "“Never saw I fiddler / so dauntless heart display,\nAs the doughty Volker / here hath done this day.\nThrough shield and shining helmet / his melodies ring clear;\nGive him to ride good charger / and eke full stately raiment wear.”",
        "2008",
        "Of all the Hunnish kindred / that in the hall had been,\nNone now of all their number / therein to fight was seen.\nHushed was the din of battle / and strife no more was made:\nFrom out their hands aweary / their swords the dauntless warriors laid.",
