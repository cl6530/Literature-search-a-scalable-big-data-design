        "The ever-memorable oath of the States General, taken at the Tennis Court\nof Versailles, was followed by the royal sitting of the 23d of June.  In\nthis seance the King declared that the Orders must vote separately, and\nthreatened, if further obstacles were met with, to himself act for the\ngood of the people.  The Queen looked on M. Necker’s not accompanying the\nKing as treachery or criminal cowardice: she said that he had converted a\nremedy into poison; that being in full popularity, his audacity, in\nopenly disavowing the step taken by his sovereign, had emboldened the\nfactious, and led away the whole Assembly; and that he was the more\nculpable inasmuch as he had the evening before given her his word to\naccompany the King.  In vain did M. Necker endeavour to excuse himself by\nsaying that his advice had not been followed.",
        "Soon afterwards the insurrections of the 11th, 12th, and 14th of July–\n[The Bastille was taken on the 14th July, 1789.]–opened the disastrous\ndrama with which France was threatened.  The massacre of M. de Flesselles\nand M. de Launay drew bitter tears from the Queen, and the idea that the\nKing had lost such devoted subjects wounded her to the heart.",
        "The character of the movement was no longer merely that of a popular\ninsurrection; cries of “Vive la Nation!  Vive le Roi!  Vive la Liberte!\"\nthrew the strongest light upon the views of the reformers.  Still the\npeople spoke of the King with affection, and appeared to think him\nfavourable to the national desire for the reform of what were called\nabuses; but they imagined that he was restrained by the opinions and\ninfluence of the Comte d’Artois and the Queen; and those two august\npersonages were therefore objects of hatred to the malcontents.  The\ndangers incurred by the Comte d’Artois determined the King’s first step\nwith the States General.  He attended their meeting on the morning of the\n15th of July with his brothers, without pomp or escort; he spoke standing\nand uncovered, and pronounced these memorable words: “I trust myself to\nyou; I only wish to be at one with my nation, and, counting on the\naffection and fidelity of my subjects, I have given orders to the troops\nto remove from Paris and Versailles.”  The King returned on foot from the\nchamber of the States General to his palace; the deputies crowded after\nhim, and formed his escort, and that of the Princes who accompanied him.\nThe rage of the populace was pointed against the Comte d’Artois, whose\nunfavourable opinion of the double representation was an odious crime in\ntheir eyes.  They repeatedly cried out, “The King for ever, in spite of\nyou and your opinions, Monseigneur!” One woman had the impudence to come\nup to the King and ask him whether what he had been doing was done\nsincerely, and whether he would not be forced to retract it.",
        "The courtyards of the Chateau were thronged with an immense concourse of\npeople; they demanded that the King and Queen, with their children,\nshould make their appearance in the balcony.  The Queen gave me the key\nof the inner doors, which led to the Dauphin’s apartments, and desired me\nto go to the Duchesse de Polignac to tell her that she wanted her son,\nand had directed me to bring him myself into her room, where she waited\nto show him to the people.  The Duchess said this order indicated that\nshe was not to accompany the Prince.  I did not answer; she squeezed my\nhand, saying, “Ah! Madame Campan, what a blow I receive!”  She embraced\nthe child and me with tears.  She knew how much I loved and valued the\ngoodness and the noble simplicity of her disposition.  I endeavoured to\nreassure her by saying that I should bring back the Prince to her; but\nshe persisted, and said she understood the order, and knew what it meant.\nShe then retired to her private room, holding her handkerchief to her\neyes.  One of the under-governesses asked me whether she might go with\nthe Dauphin; I told her the Queen had given no order to the contrary, and\nwe hastened to her Majesty, who was waiting to lead the Prince to the\nbalcony.",
        "Having executed this sad commission, I went down into the courtyard,\nwhere I mingled with the crowd.  I heard a thousand vociferations; it was\neasy to see, by the difference between the language and the dress of some\npersons among the mob, that they were in disguise.  A woman, whose face\nwas covered with a black lace veil, seized me by the arm with some\nviolence, and said, calling me by my name, “I know you very well; tell\nyour Queen not to meddle with government any longer; let her leave her\nhusband and our good States General to effect the happiness of the\npeople.”  At the same moment a man, dressed much in the style of a\nmarketman, with his hat pulled down over his eyes, seized me by the other\narm, and said, “Yes, yes; tell her over and over again that it will not\nbe with these States as with the others, which produced no good to the\npeople; that the nation is too enlightened in 1789 not to make something\nmore of them; and that there will not now be seen a deputy of the ’Tiers\nEtat’ making a speech with one knee on the ground; tell her this, do you\nhear?  “I was struck with dread; the Queen then appeared in the balcony.\n\"Ah!” said the woman in the veil, “the Duchess is not with her.\"–\"No,\"\nreplied the man, “but she is still at Versailles; she is working\nunderground, molelike; but we shall know how to dig her out.”  The\ndetestable pair moved away from me, and I reentered the palace, scarcely\nable to support myself.  I thought it my duty to relate the dialogue of\nthese two strangers to the Queen; she made me repeat the particulars to\nthe King.",
        "About four in the afternoon I went across the terrace to Madame\nVictoire’s apartments; three men had stopped under the windows of the\nthrone-chamber.  “Here is that throne,” said one of them aloud, “the\nvestiges of which will soon be sought for.”  He added a thousand\ninvectives against their Majesties.  I went in to the Princess, who was\nat work alone in her closet, behind a canvass blind, which prevented her\nfrom being seen by those without.  The three men were still walking upon\nthe terrace; I showed them to her, and told her what they had said.  She\nrose to take a nearer view of them, and informed me that one of them was\nnamed Saint-Huruge; that he was sold to the Duc d’Orleans, and was\nfurious against the Government, because he had been confined once under a\n’lettre de cachet’ as a bad character.",
        "The King was not ignorant of these popular threats; he also knew the days\non which money was scattered about Paris, and once or twice the Queen\nprevented my going there, saying there would certainly be a riot the next\nday, because she knew that a quantity of crown pieces had been\ndistributed in the faubourgs.",
        "     [I have seen a six-franc crown piece, which certainly served to pay\n     some wretch on the night of the 12th of July; the words “Midnight,\n     12th July, three pistols,” were rather deeply engraven on it.  They\n     were, no doubt, a password for the first insurrection.\n     –MADAME COMPAN]",
        "On the evening of the 14th of July the King came to the Queen’s\napartments, where I was with her Majesty alone; he conversed with her\nrespecting the scandalous report disseminated by the factious, that he\nhad had the Chamber of the National Assembly undermined, in order to blow\nit up; but he added that it became him to treat such absurd assertions\nwith contempt, as usual; I ventured to tell him that I had the evening\nbefore supped with M. Begouen, one of the deputies, who said that there\nwere very respectable persons who thought that this horrible contrivance\nhad been proposed without the King’s knowledge.  “Then,” said his\nMajesty, “as the idea of such an atrocity was not revolting to so worthy\na man as M. Begouen, I will order the chamber to be examined early to-\nmorrow morning.”  In fact, it will be seen by the King’s, speech to the\nNational Assembly, on the 15th of July, that the suspicions excited\nobtained his attention.  “I know,” said he in the speech in question,\n\"that unworthy insinuations have been made; I know there are those who\nhave dared to assert that your persons are not safe; can it be necessary\nto give you assurances upon the subject of reports so culpable, denied\nbeforehand by my known character?”",
        "The proceedings of the 15th of July produced no mitigation of the\ndisturbances.  Successive deputations of poissardes came to request the\nKing to visit Paris, where his presence alone would put an end to the\ninsurrection.",
        "On the 16th a committee was held in the King’s apartments, at which a\nmost important question was discussed: whether his Majesty should quit\nVersailles and set off with the troops whom he had recently ordered to\nwithdraw, or go to Paris to tranquillise the minds of the people.  The\nQueen was for the departure.  On the evening of the 16th she made me take\nall her jewels out of their cases, to collect them in one small box,\nwhich she might carry off in her own carriage.  With my assistance she\nburnt a large quantity of papers; for Versailles was then threatened with\nan early visit of armed men from Paris.",
        "The Queen, on the morning of the 16th, before attending another committee\nat the King’s, having got her jewels ready, and looked over all her\npapers, gave me one folded up but not sealed, and desired me not to read\nit until she should give me an order to do so from the King’s room, and\nthat then I was to execute its contents; but she returned herself about\nten in the morning; the affair was decided; the army was to go away\nwithout the King; all those who were in imminent danger were to go at the\nsame time.  “The King will go to the Hotel de Ville to-morrow,” said the\nQueen to me; “he did not choose this course for himself; there were long\ndebates on the question; at last the King put an end to them by rising\nand saying, ’Well, gentlemen, we must decide; am I to go or to stay?  I\nam ready to do either.’  The majority were for the King staying; time\nwill show whether the right choice has been made.”  I returned the Queen\nthe paper she had given me, which was now useless; she read it to me; it\ncontained her orders for the departure; I was to go with her, as well on\naccount of my office about her person as to serve as a teacher to Madame.\nThe Queen tore the paper, and said, with tears in her eyes, “When I wrote\nthis I thought it would be useful, but fate has ordered otherwise, to the\nmisfortune of us all, as I much fear.”",
        "After the departure of the troops the new administration received thanks;\nM. Necker was recalled.  The artillery soldiers were undoubtedly\ncorrupted.  “Wherefore all these guns?”  exclaimed the crowds of women\nwho filled the streets.  “Will you kill your mothers, your wives, your\nchildren?\"–\"Don’t be afraid,” answered the soldiers; “these guns shall\nrather be levelled against the tyrant’s palace than against you!”",
        "The Comte d’Artois, the Prince de Conde, and their children set off at\nthe same time with the troops.  The Duc and Duchesse de Polignac, their\ndaughter, the Duchesse de Guiche, the Comtesse Diane de Polignac, sister\nof the Duke, and the Abbe de Baliviere, also emigrated on the same night.\nNothing could be more affecting than the parting of the Queen and her\nfriend; extreme misfortune had banished from their minds the recollection\nof differences to which political opinions alone had given rise.  The\nQueen several times wished to go and embrace her once more after their\nsorrowful adieu, but she was too closely watched.  She desired M. Campan\nto be present at the departure of the Duchess, and gave him a purse of\nfive hundred Louis, desiring him to insist upon her allowing the Queen to\nlend her that sum to defray her expenses on the road.  The Queen added\nthat she knew her situation; that she had often calculated her income,\nand the expenses occasioned by her place at Court; that both husband and\nwife having no other fortune than their official salaries, could not\npossibly have saved anything, however differently people might think at\nParis.",
        "M. Campan remained till midnight with the Duchess to see her enter her\ncarriage.  She was disguised as a femme de chambre, and got up in front\nof the Berlin; she requested M. Campan to remember her frequently to the\nQueen, and then quitted for ever that palace, that favour, and that\ninfluence which had raised her up such cruel enemies.  On their arrival\nat Sens the travellers found the people in a state of insurrection; they\nasked all those who came from Paris whether the Polignacs were still with\nthe Queen.  A group of inquisitive persons put that question to the Abbe\nde Baliviere, who answered them in the firmest tone, and with the most\ncavalier air, that they were far enough from Versailles, and that we had\ngot rid of all such bad people.  At the following stage the postilion got\non the doorstep and said to the Duchess, “Madame, there are some good\npeople left in the world: I recognised you all at Sens.”  They gave the\nworthy fellow a handful of gold.",
        "On the breaking out of these disturbances an old man above seventy years\nof age gave the Queen an extraordinary proof of attachment and fidelity.\nM. Peraque, a rich inhabitant of the colonies, father of M. d’Oudenarde,\nwas coming from Brussels to Paris; while changing horses he was met by a\nyoung man who was leaving France, and who recommended him if he carried\nany letters from foreign countries to burn them immediately, especially\nif he had any for the Queen.  M. Peraque had one from the Archduchess,\nthe Gouvernante of the Low Countries, for her Majesty.  He thanked the\nstranger, and carefully concealed his packet; but as he approached Paris\nthe insurrection appeared to him so general and so violent, that he\nthought no means could be relied on for securing this letter from\nseizure.  He took upon him to unseal it, and learned it by heart, which\nwas a wonderful effort for a man at his time of life, as it contained\nfour pages of writing.  On his arrival at Paris he wrote it down, and\nthen presented it to the Queen, telling her that the heart of an old and\nfaithful subject had given him courage to form and execute such a\nresolution.  The Queen received M. Peraque in her closet, and expressed\nher gratitude in an affecting manner most honourable to the worthy old\nman.  Her Majesty thought the young stranger who had apprised him of the\nstate of Paris was Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, who was very devoted\nto her, and who left Paris at that time.",
        "The Marquise de Tourzel replaced the Duchess de Polignac.  She was\nselected by the Queen as being the mother of a family and a woman of\nirreproachable conduct, who had superintended the education of her own\ndaughters with the greatest success.",
        "The King went to Paris on the 17th of July, accompanied by the Marechal\nde Beauvau, the Duc de Villeroi, and the Duc de Villequier; he also took\nthe Comte d’Estaing, and the Marquis de Nesle, who were then very\npopular, in his carriage.  Twelve Body Guards, and the town guard of\nVersailles, escorted him to the Pont du Jour, near Sevres, where the\nParisian guard was waiting for him.  His departure caused equal grief and\nalarm to his friends, notwithstanding the calmness he exhibited.  The\nQueen restrained her tears, and shut herself up in her private rooms with\nher family.  She sent for several persons belonging to her Court; their\ndoors were locked.  Terror had driven them away.  The silence of death\nreigned throughout the palace; they hardly dared hope that the King would\nreturn?  The Queen had a robe prepared for her, and sent orders to her\nstables to have all her equipages ready.  She wrote an address of a few\nlines for the Assembly, determining to go there with her family, the\nofficers of her palace, and her servants, if the King should be detained\nprisoner at Paris.  She got this address by heart; it began with these\nwords: “Gentlemen, I come to place in your hands the wife and family of\nyour sovereign; do not suffer those who have been united in heaven to be\nput asunder on earth.”  While she was repeating this address she was\noften interrupted by tears, and sorrowfully exclaimed: “They will not let\nhim return!”",
        "It was past four when the King, who had left Versailles at ten in the\nmorning, entered the Hotel de Ville.  At length, at six in the evening,\nM. de Lastours, the King’s first page, arrived; he was not half an hour\nin coming from the Barriere de la Conference to Versailles.  Everybody\nknows that the moment of calm in Paris was that in which the unfortunate\nsovereign received the tricoloured cockade from M. Bailly, and placed it\nin his hat.  A shout of “Vive le Roi!” arose on all sides; it had not\nbeen once uttered before.  The King breathed again, and with tears in his\neyes exclaimed that his heart stood in need of such greetings from the\npeople.  One of his equerries (M. de Cubieres) told him the people loved\nhim, and that he could never have doubted it.  The King replied in\naccents of profound sensibility:",
        "“Cubieres, the French loved Henri IV., and what king ever better deserved\nto be beloved?”",
        "     [Louis XVI. cherished the memory of Henri IV.: at that moment he\n     thought of his deplorable end; but he long before regarded him as a\n     model.  Soulavie says on the subject: “A tablet with the inscription\n     ’Resurrexit’ placed upon the pedestal of Henri IV.’s statue on the\n     accession of Louis XVI. flattered him exceedingly.  ’What a fine\n     compliment,’ said he, ’if it were true!  Tacitus himself never wrote\n     anything so concise or so happy.’  Louis XVI. wished to take the\n     reign of that Prince for a model.  In the following year the party\n     that raised a commotion among the people on account of the dearness\n     of corn removed the tablet inscribed Resurrexit from the statue of\n     Henri IV., and placed it under that of Louis XV., whose memory was\n     then detested, as he was believed to have traded on the scarcity of\n     food.  Louis XVI., who was informed of it, withdrew into his private\n     apartments, where he was found in a fever shedding tears; and during\n     the whole of that day he could not be prevailed upon either to dine,\n     walk out, or sup.  From this circumstance we may judge what he\n     endured at the commencement of the Revolution, when he was accused\n     of not loving the French people.\"–NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]",
        "His return to Versailles filled his family with inexpressible joy; in the\narms of the Queen, his sister, and his children, he congratulated himself\nthat no accident had happened; and he repeated several times, “Happily no\nblood has been shed, and I swear that never shall a drop of French blood\nbe shed by my order,\"–a determination full of humanity, but too openly\navowed in such factious times!",
        "The King’s last measure raised a hope in many that general tranquillity\nwould soon enable the Assembly to resume its, labours, and promptly bring\nits session to a close.  The Queen never flattered herself so far;\nM. Bailly’s speech to the King had equally wounded her pride and hurt her\nfeelings.  “Henri IV. conquered his people, and here are the people\nconquering their King.”  The word “conquest” offended her; she never\nforgave M. Bailly for this fine academical phrase.",
        "Five days after the King’s visit to Paris, the departure of the troops,\nand the removal of the Princes and some of the nobility whose influence\nseemed to alarm the people, a horrible deed committed by hired assassins\nproved that the King had descended the steps of his throne without having\neffected a reconciliation with his people.",
        "M. Foulon, adjoint to the administration while M. de Broglie was\ncommanding the army assembled at Versailles, had concealed himself at\nViry.  He was there recognised, and the peasants seized him, and dragged\nhim to the Hotel de Ville.  The cry for death was heard; the electors,\nthe members of committee, and M. de La Fayette, at that time the idol of\nParis, in vain endeavoured to save the unfortunate man.  After tormenting\nhim in a manner which makes humanity shudder, his body was dragged about\nthe streets, and to the Palais Royal, and his heart was carried by women\nin the midst of a bunch of white carnations!  M. Berthier, M. Foulon’s\nson-in-law, intendant of Paris, was seized at Compiegne, at the same time\nthat his father-in-law was seized at Viry, and treated with still more\nrelentless cruelty.",
        "The Queen was always persuaded that this horrible deed was occasioned by\nsome indiscretion; and she informed me that M. Foulon had drawn up two\nmemorials for the direction of the King’s conduct at the time of his\nbeing called to Court on the removal of M. Necker; and that these\nmemorials contained two schemes of totally different nature for\nextricating the King from the dreadful situation in which he was placed.\nIn the first of these projects M. Foulon expressed himself without\nreserve respecting the criminal views of the Duc d’Orleans; said that\nhe ought to be put under arrest, and that no time should be lost in\ncommencing a prosecution against him, while the criminal tribunals were\nstill in existence; he likewise pointed out such deputies as should be\napprehended, and advised the King not to separate himself from his army\nuntil order was restored.",
        "His other plan was that the King should make himself master of the\nrevolution before its complete explosion; he advised his Majesty to go to\nthe Assembly, and there, in person, to demand the cahiers,",
        "     [Cahiers, the memorials or lists of complaints, grievances, and\n     requirements of the electors drawn up by the primary assemblies and\n     sent with the deputies.]",
        "and to make the greatest sacrifices to satisfy the legitimate wishes of\nthe people, and not to give the factious time to enlist them in aid of\ntheir criminal designs.  Madame Adelaide had M. Foulon’s two memorials\nread to her in the presence of four or five persons.  One of them, Comte\nLouis de Narbonne, was very intimate with Madame de Stael, and that\nintimacy gave the Queen reason to believe that the opposite party had\ngained information of M. Foulon’s schemes.",
        "It is known that young Barnave, during an aberration of mind, since\nexpiated by sincere repentance, and even by death, uttered these\natrocious words: “Is then the blood now, flowing so pure?” when M.\nBerthier’s son came to the Assembly to implore the eloquence of M. de\nLally to entreat that body to save his father’s life.  I have since been\ninformed that a son of M. Foulon, having returned to France after these\nfirst ebullitions of the Revolution, saw Barnave, and gave him one of\nthose memorials in which M. Foulon advised Louis XVI. to prevent the\nrevolutionary explosion by voluntarily granting all that the Assembly\nrequired before the 14th of July.  “Read this memorial,” said he; “I have\nbrought it to increase your remorse: it is the only revenge I wish to\ninflict on you.”  Barnave burst into tears, and said to him all that the\nprofoundest grief could dictate.",
        "After the 14th of July, by a manoeuvre for which the most skilful\nfactions of any age might have envied the Assembly, the whole population\nof France was armed and organised into a National Guard.  A report was\nspread throughout France on the same day, and almost at the same hour,\nthat four thousand brigands were marching towards such towns or villages\nas it was wished to induce to take arms.  Never was any plan better laid;\nterror spread at the same moment all over the kingdom.  In 1791 a peasant\nshowed me a steep rock in the mountains of the Mont d’Or on which his\nwife concealed herself on the day when the four thousand brigands were to\nattack their village, and told me they had been obliged to make use of\nropes to let her down from the height which fear alone had enabled her to\nclimb.",
        "Versailles was certainly the place where the national military uniform\nappeared most offensive.  All the King’s valets, even of the lowest\nclass, were metamorphosed into lieutenants or captains; almost all the\nmusicians of the chapel ventured one day to make their appearance at the\nKing’s mass in a military costume; and an Italian soprano adopted the\nuniform of a grenadier captain.  The King was very much offended at this\nconduct, and forbade his servants to appear in his presence in so\nunsuitable a dress.",
        "The departure of the Duchesse de Polignac naturally left the Abbe de\nVermond exposed to all the dangers of favouritism.  He was already talked\nof as an adviser dangerous to the nation.  The Queen was alarmed at it,\nand recommended him to remove to Valenciennes, where Count Esterhazy was\nin command.  He was obliged to leave that place in a few days and set off\nfor Vienna, where he remained.",
        "On the night of the 17th of July the Queen, being unable to sleep, made\nme watch by her until three in the morning.  I was extremely surprised to\nhear her say that it would be a very long time before the Abbe de Vermond\nwould make his appearance at Court again, even if the existing ferment\nshould subside, because he would not readily be forgiven for his\nattachment to the Archbishop of Sens; and that she had lost in him a very\ndevoted servant.  Then she suddenly remarked to me, that although he was\nnot much prejudiced against me I could not have much regard for him,\nbecause he could not bear my father-in-law to hold the place of secretary\nof the closet.  She went on to say that I must have studied the Abbe’s\ncharacter, and, as I had sometimes drawn her portraits of living\ncharacters, in imitation of those which were fashionable in the time of\nLouis XIV., she desired me to sketch that of the Abbe, without any\nreserve.  My astonishment was extreme; the Queen spoke of the man who,\nthe day before, had been in the greatest intimacy with her with the\nutmost coolness, and as a person whom, perhaps, she might never see\nagain!  I remained petrified; the Queen persisted, and told me that he\nhad been the enemy of my family for more than twelve years, without\nhaving been able to injure it in her opinion; so that I had no occasion\nto dread his return, however severely I might depict him.  I promptly\nsummarised my ideas about the favourite; but I only remember that the\nportrait was drawn with sincerity, except that everything which could\ndenote antipathy was kept out of it.  I shall make but one extract from\nit: I said that he had been born talkative and indiscreet, and had\nassumed a character of singularity and abruptness in order to conceal\nthose two failings.  The Queen interrupted me by saying, “Ah! how true\nthat is!”  I have since discovered that, notwithstanding the high favour\nwhich the Abbe de Vermond enjoyed, the Queen took precautions to guard\nherself against an ascendency the consequences of which she could not\ncalculate.",
        "On the death of my father-in-law his executors placed in my hands a box\ncontaining a few jewels deposited by the Queen with M. Campan on the\ndeparture from Versailles of the 6th of October, and two sealed packets,\neach inscribed, “Campan will take care of these papers for me.”  I took\nthe two packets to her Majesty, who kept the jewels and the larger\npacket, and, returning me the smaller, said, “Take care of that for me as\nyour father-in-law did.”",
        "After the fatal 10th of August, 1792,–[The day of the attack on the\nTuileries, slaughter of the Swiss guard, and suspension of the King from\nhis functions.]–when my house was about to be surrounded, I determined\nto burn the most interesting papers of which I was the depositary; I\nthought it my duty, however, to open this packet, which it might perhaps\nbe necessary for me to preserve at all hazards.\nI saw that it contained a letter from the Abbe de Vermond to the Queen.\nI have already related that in the earlier days of Madame de Polignac’s\nfavour he determined to remove from Versailles, and that the Queen\nrecalled him by means of the Comte de Mercy.  This letter contained\nnothing but certain conditions for his return; it was the most whimsical\nof treaties; I confess I greatly regretted being under the necessity of\ndestroying it.  He reproached the Queen for her infatuation for the\nComtesse Jules, her family, and society; and told her several truths\nabout the possible consequences of a friendship which ranked that lady\namong the favourites of the Queens of France, a title always disliked by\nthe nation.  He complained that his advice was neglected, and then came\nto the conditions of his return to Versailles; after strong assurances\nthat he would never, in all his life, aim at the higher church dignities,\nhe said that he delighted in an unbounded confidence; and that he asked\nbut two things of her Majesty as essential: the first was, not to give\nhim her orders through any third person, and to write to him herself; he\ncomplained much that he had had no letter in her own hand since he had\nleft Vienna; then he demanded of her an income of eighty thousand livres,\nin ecclesiastical benefices; and concluded by saying that, if she\ncondescended to assure him herself that she would set about procuring him\nwhat he wished, her letter would be sufficient in itself to show him that\nher Majesty had accepted the two conditions he ventured to make\nrespecting his return.  No doubt the letter was written; at least it is\nvery certain that the benefices were granted, and that his absence from\nVersailles lasted only a single week.",
        "In the course of July, 1789, the regiment of French guards, which had\nbeen in a state of insurrection from the latter end of June, abandoned\nits colours.  One single company of grenadiers remained faithful, to its\npost at Versailles.  M. le Baron de Leval was the captain of this\ncompany.  He came every evening to request me to give the Queen an\naccount of the disposition of his soldiers; but M. de La Fayette having\nsent them a note, they all deserted during the night and joined their\ncomrades, who were enrolled in the Paris guard; so that Louis XVI. on\nrising saw no guard whatever at the various posts entrusted to them.",
        "The decrees of the 4th of August, by which all privileges were abolished,\nare well known.",
        "     [\"It was during the night of the 4th of August,” says Rivarol, “that\n     the demagogues of the nobility, wearied with a protracted discussion\n     upon the rights of man, and burning to signalise their zeal, rose\n     all at once, and with loud exclamations called for the last sighs of\n     the feudal system.  This demand electrified the Assembly.  All heads\n     were frenzied.  The younger sons of good families, having nothing,\n     were delighted to sacrifice their too fortunate elders upon the\n     altar of the country; a few country cures felt no less pleasure in\n     renouncing the benefices of others; but what posterity will hardly\n     believe is that the same enthusiasm infected the whole nobility;\n     zeal walked hand in hand with malevolence; they made sacrifice upon\n     sacrifice.  And as in Japan the point of honour lies in a man’s\n     killing himself in the presence of the person who has offended him,\n     so did the deputies of the nobility vie in striking at themselves\n     and their constituents.  The people who were present at this noble\n     contest increased the intoxication of their new allies by their\n     shouts; and the deputies of the commons, seeing that this memorable\n     night would only afford them profit without honour, consoled their\n     self-love by wondering at what Nobility, grafted upon the Third\n     Estate, could do.  They named that night the ’night of dupes’; the\n     nobles called it the ’night of sacrifices’.\"–NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]",
        "The King sanctioned all that tended to the diminution of his own personal\ngratifications, but refused his consent to the other decrees of that\ntumultuous night; this refusal was one of the chief causes of the\nferments of the month of October.",
        "In the early part of September meetings were held at the Palais Royal,\nand propositions made to go to Versailles; it was said to be necessary to\nseparate the King from his evil counsellors, and keep him, as well as the\nDauphin, at the Louvre.  The proclamations by the officers of the commune\nfor the restoration of tranquillity were ineffectual; but M. de La\nFayette succeeded this time in dispersing the populace.  The Assembly\ndeclared itself permanent; and during the whole of September, in which no\ndoubt the preparations were made for the great insurrections of the\nfollowing month, the Court was not disturbed.",
        "The King had the Flanders regiment removed to Versailles; unfortunately\nthe idea of the officers of that regiment fraternising with the Body\nGuards was conceived, and the latter invited the former to a dinner,\nwhich was given in the great theatre of Versailles, and not in the Salon\nof Hercules, as some chroniclers say.  Boxes were appropriated to various\npersons who wished to be present at this entertainment.  The Queen told\nme she had been advised to make her appearance on the occasion, but that\nunder existing circumstances she thought such a step might do more harm\nthan good; and that, moreover, neither she nor the King ought directly to\nhave anything to do with such a festival.  She ordered me to go, and\ndesired me to observe everything closely, in order to give a faithful\naccount of the whole affair.",
        "The tables were set out upon the stage; at them were placed one of the\nBody Guard and an officer of the Flanders regiment alternately.  There\nwas a numerous orchestra in the room, and the boxes were filled with\nspectators.  The air, “O Richard, O mon Roi!” was played, and shouts of\n\"Vive de Roi!” shook the roof for several minutes.  I had with me one of\nmy nieces, and a young person brought up with Madame by her Majesty.\nThey were crying “Vive le Roi!” with all their might when a deputy of the\nThird Estate, who was in the next box to mine, and whom I had never seen,\ncalled to them, and reproached them for their exclamations; it hurt him,\nhe said, to see young and handsome Frenchwomen brought up in such servile\nhabits, screaming so outrageously for the life of one man, and with true\nfanaticism exalting him in their hearts above even their dearest\nrelations; he told them what contempt worthy American women would feel on\nseeing Frenchwomen thus corrupted from their earliest infancy.  My niece\nreplied with tolerable spirit, and I requested the deputy to put an end\nto the subject, which could by no means afford him any satisfaction,\ninasmuch as the young persons who were with me lived, as well as myself,\nfor the sole purpose of serving and loving the King.  While I was\nspeaking what was my astonishment at seeing the King, the Queen, and the\nDauphin enter the chamber!  It was M. de Luxembourg who had effected this\nchange in the Queen’s determination.",
        "The enthusiasm became general; the moment their Majesties arrived the\norchestra repeated the air I have just mentioned, and afterwards played a\nsong in the “Deserter,” “Can we grieve those whom we love?”  which also\nmade a powerful impression upon those present: on all sides were heard\npraises of their Majesties, exclamations of affection, expressions of\nregret for what they had suffered, clapping of hands, and shouts of “Vive\nle Roi! Vive la Reine! Vive le Dauphin!”  It has been said that white\ncockades were worn on this occasion; that was not the case; the fact is,\nthat a few young men belonging to the National Guard of Versailles, who\nwere invited to the entertainment, turned the white lining of their\nnational cockades outwards.  All the military men quitted the hall,\nand reconducted the King and his family to their apartments.  There was\nintoxication in these ebullitions of joy: a thousand extravagances were\ncommitted by the military, and many of them danced under the King’s\nwindows; a soldier belonging to the Flanders regiment climbed up to the\nbalcony of the King’s chamber in order to shout “Vive le Roi!”  nearer\nhis Majesty; this very soldier, as I have been told by several officers\nof the corps, was one of the first and most dangerous of their insurgents\nin the riots of the 5th and 6th of October.  On the same evening another\nsoldier of that regiment killed himself with a sword.  One of my\nrelations, chaplain to the Queen, who supped with me, saw him stretched\nout in a corner of the Place d’Armes; he went to him to give him\nspiritual assistance, and received his confession and his last sighs.\nHe destroyed himself out of regret at having suffered himself to be\ncorrupted by the enemies of his King, and said that, since he had seen\nhim and the Queen and the Dauphin, remorse had turned his brain.",
        "I returned home, delighted with all that I had seen.",
        "I found a great many people there.  M. de Beaumetz, deputy for Arras,\nlistened to my description with a chilling air, and, when I had finished,\ntold me that all that had passed was terrific; that he knew the\ndisposition of the Assembly, and that the greatest misfortunes would\nfollow the drama of that night; and he begged my leave to withdraw that\nhe might take time for deliberate reflection whether he should on the\nvery next day emigrate, or pass over to the left side of the Assembly.\nHe adopted the latter course, and never appeared again among my\nassociates.",
        "On the 2d of October the military entertainment was followed up by a\nbreakfast given at the hotel of the Body Guards.  It is said that a\ndiscussion took place whether they should not march against the Assembly;\nbut I am utterly ignorant of what passed at that breakfast.  From that\nmoment Paris was constantly in commotion; there were continual mobs,\nand the most virulent proposals were heard in all public places; the\nconversation was invariably about proceeding to Versailles.  The King and\nQueen did not seem apprehensive of such a measure, and took no precaution\nagainst it; even when the army had actually left Paris, on the evening of\nthe 5th of October, the King was shooting at Meudon, and the Queen was\nalone in her gardens at Trianon, which she then beheld for the last time\nin her life.  She was sitting in her grotto absorbed in painful\nreflection, when she received a note from the Comte de Saint-Priest,\nentreating her to return to Versailles.  M. de Cubieres at the same time\nwent off to request the King to leave his sport and return to the palace;\nthe King did so on horseback, and very leisurely.  A few minutes\nafterwards he was informed that a numerous body of women, which preceded\nthe Parisian army, was at Chaville, at the entrance of the avenue from\nParis.",
        "The scarcity of bread and the entertainment of the Body Guards were the\npretexts for the insurrection of the 5th and 6th of October, 1789; but it\nis clear to demonstration that this new movement of the people was a part\nof the original plan of the factious, insomuch as, ever since the\nbeginning of September, a report had been industriously circulated that\nthe King intended to withdraw, with his family and ministers, to some\nstronghold; and at all the popular assemblies there had been always a\ngreat deal said about going to Versailles to seize the King.",
        "At first only women showed themselves; the latticed doors of the Chateau\nwere closed, and the Body Guard and Flanders regiment were drawn up in\nthe Place d’Armes.  As the details of that dreadful day are given with\nprecision in several works, I will only observe that general\nconsternation and disorder reigned throughout the interior of the palace.",
        "I was not in attendance on the Queen at this time.  M. Campan remained\nwith her till two in the morning.  As he was leaving her she\ncondescendingly, and with infinite kindness, desired him to make me easy\nas to the dangers of the moment, and to repeat to me M. de La Fayette’s\nown words, which he had just used on soliciting the royal family to\nretire to bed, undertaking to answer for his army.",
        "The Queen was far from relying upon M. de La Fayette’s loyalty; but she\nhas often told me that she believed on that day, that La Fayette, having\naffirmed to the King, in the presence of a crowd of witnesses, that he\nwould answer for the army of Paris, would not risk his honour as a\ncommander, and was sure of being able to redeem his pledge.  She also\nthought the Parisian army was devoted to him, and that all he said about\nhis being forced to march upon Versailles was mere pretence.",
        "On the first intimation of the march of the Parisians, the Comte de\nSaint-Priest prepared Rambouillet for the reception of the King, his\nfamily, and suite, and the carriages were even drawn out; but a few cries\nof “Vive le Roi!”  when the women reported his Majesty’s favourable\nanswer, occasioned the intention of going away to be given up, and orders\nwere given to the troops to withdraw.",
        "     [Compare this account with the particulars given in the “Memoirs” of\n     Ferribres, Weber, Bailly, and Saint-Priest, from the latter of which\n     the following sentence is taken:",
        "     “M. d’Estaing knew not what to do with the Body Guards beyond\n     bringing them into the courtyard of the ministers, and shutting the\n     grilles.  Thence they proceeded to the terrace of the Chateau, then\n     to Trianon, and lastly to Rambouillet.",
        "     “I could not refrain from expressing to M. d’Estaing, when he came\n     to the King, my astonishment at not seeing him make any military\n     disposition.  ’Monsieur,’ replied he, ’I await the orders of the\n     King’ (who did not open his mouth).  ’When the King gives no\n     orders,’ pursued I, ’a general should decide for himself in a\n     soldierly manner.’  This observation remained unanswered.\"]",
        "The Body Guards were, however, assailed with stones and musketry while\nthey were passing from the Place d’Armes to, their hotel.  Alarm revived;\nagain it was thought necessary that the royal family should go away; some\ncarriages still remained ready for travelling; they were called for; they\nwere stopped by a wretched player belonging to the theatre of the town,\nseconded by the mob: the opportunity for flight had been lost.",
        "The insurrection was directed against the Queen in particular; I shudder\neven now at the recollection of the poissardes, or rather furies, who\nwore white aprons, which they screamed out were intended to receive the\nbowels of Marie Antoinette, and that they would make cockades of them,\nmixing the most obscene expressions with these horrible threats.",
        "The Queen went to bed at two in the morning, and even slept, tired out\nwith the events of so distressing a day.  She had ordered her two women\nto bed, imagining there was nothing to dread, at least for that night;\nbut the unfortunate Princess was indebted for her life to that feeling of\nattachment which prevented their obeying her.  My sister, who was one of\nthe ladies in question, informed me next day of all that I am about to\nrelate.",
        "On leaving the Queen’s bedchamber, these ladies called their femmes de\nchambre, and all four remained sitting together against her Majesty’s\nbedroom door.  About half-past four in the morning they heard horrible\nyells and discharges of firearms; one ran to the Queen to awaken her and\nget her out of bed; my sister flew to the place from which the tumult\nseemed to proceed; she opened the door of the antechamber which leads to\nthe great guard-room, and beheld one of the Body Guard holding his musket\nacross the door, and attacked by a mob, who were striking at him; his\nface was covered with blood; he turned round and exclaimed: “Save the\nQueen, madame; they are come to assassinate her!”  She hastily shut the\ndoor upon the unfortunate victim of duty, fastened it with the great\nbolt, and took the same precaution on leaving the next room.  On reaching\nthe Queen’s chamber she cried out to her, “Get up, Madame!  Don’t stay to\ndress yourself; fly to the King’s apartment!”  The terrified Queen threw\nherself out of bed; they put a petticoat upon her without tying it, and\nthe two ladies conducted her towards the oile-de-boeuf.  A door, which\nled from the Queen’s dressing-room to that apartment, had never before\nbeen fastened but on her side.  What a dreadful moment!  It was found to\nbe secured on the other side.  They knocked repeatedly with all their\nstrength; a servant of one of the King’s valets de chambre came and\nopened it; the Queen entered the King’s chamber, but he was not there.\nAlarmed for the Queen’s life, he had gone down the staircases and through\nthe corridors under the oeil-de-boeuf, by means of which he was\naccustomed to go to the Queen’s apartments without being under the\nnecessity of crossing that room.  He entered her Majesty’s room and found\nno one there but some Body Guards, who had taken refuge in it.  The King,\nunwilling to expose their lives, told them to wait a few minutes, and\nafterwards sent to desire them to go to the oeil-de-boeuf.  Madame de\nTourzel, at that time governess of the children of France, had just taken\nMadame and the Dauphin to the King’s apartments.  The Queen saw her\nchildren again.  The reader must imagine this scene of tenderness and\ndespair.",
        "It is not true that the assassins penetrated to the Queen’s chamber and\npierced the bed with their swords.  The fugitive Body Guards were the\nonly persons who entered it; and if the crowd had reached so far they\nwould all have been massacred.  Besides, when the rebels had forced the\ndoors of the antechamber, the footmen and officers on duty, knowing that\nthe Queen was no longer in her apartments, told them so with that air of\ntruth which always carries conviction.  The ferocious horde instantly\nrushed towards the oeil-de-boeuf, hoping, no doubt, to intercept her on\nher way.",
        "Many have asserted that they recognised the Duc d’Orleans in a greatcoat\nand slouched hat, at half-past four in the morning, at the top of the\nmarble staircase, pointing out with his hand the guard-room, which led to\nthe Queen’s apartments.  This fact was deposed to at the Chatelet by\nseveral individuals in the course of the inquiry instituted respecting\nthe transactions of the 5th and 6th of October.",
        "     [The National Assembly was sitting when information of the march of\n     the Parisians was given to it by one of the deputies who came from\n     Paris.  A certain number of the members were no strangers, to this\n     movement.  It appears that Mirabeau wished to avail himself of it to\n     raise the Duc d’Orleans to the throne.  Mounier, who presided over\n     the National Assembly, rejected the idea with horror.  “My good\n     man,” said Mirabeau to him, “what difference will it make to you to\n     have Louis XVII. for your King instead of Louis XVI.?” (The Duc\n     d’Orleans was baptised Louis.)]",
        "The prudence and honourable feeling of several officers of the Parisian\nguards, and the judicious conduct of M. de Vaudreuil, lieutenant-general\nof marine, and of M. de Chevanne, one of the King’s Guards, brought about\nan understanding between the grenadiers of the National Guard of Paris\nand the King’s Guard.  The doors of the oeil-de-boeuf were closed, and\nthe antechamber which precedes that room was filled with grenadiers who\nwanted to get in to massacre the Guards.  M. de Chevanne offered himself\nto them as a victim if they wished for one, and demanded what they would\nhave.  A report had been spread through their ranks that the Body Guards\nset them at defiance, and that they all wore black cockades.  M. de\nChevanne showed them that he wore, as did the corps, the cockade of their\nuniform; and promised that the Guards should exchange it for that of the\nnation.  This was done; they even went so far as to exchange their\ngrenadiers’ caps for the hats of the Body Guards; those who were on guard\ntook off their shoulder-belts; embraces and transports of fraternisation\ninstantly succeeded to the savage eagerness to murder the band which had\nshown so much fidelity to its sovereign.  The cry was now “Vivent le Roi,\nla Nation, et les Gardes-du-corps!”",
        "The army occupied the Place d’Armes, all the courtyards of the Chateau,\nand the entrance to the avenue.  They called for the Queen to appear in\nthe balcony: she came forward with Madame and the Dauphin.  There was a\ncry of “No children!”  Was this with a view to deprive her of the\ninterest she inspired, accompanied as she was by her young family, or did\nthe leaders of the democrats hope that some madman would venture to aim a\nmortal blow at her person?  The unfortunate Princess certainly was\nimpressed with the latter idea, for she sent away her children, and with\nher hands and eyes raised towards heaven, advanced upon the balcony like\na self-devoted victim.",
        "A few voices shouted “To Paris!”  The exclamation soon became general.\nBefore the King agreed to this removal he wished to consult the National\nAssembly, and caused that body to be invited to sit at the Chateau.\nMirabeau opposed this measure.  While these discussions were going\nforward it became more and more difficult to restrain the immense\ndisorderly multitude.  The King, without consulting any one, now said to\nthe people: “You wish, my children, that I should follow you to Paris: I\nconsent, but on condition that I shall not be separated from my wife and\nfamily.”  The King added that he required safety also for his Guards; he\nwas answered by shouts of “Vivo le Roi!  Vivent les Gardes-du-corps!\"\nThe Guards, with their hats in the air, turned so as to exhibit the.\ncockade, shouted “Vive le Roi!  Vive la Nation!”  shortly afterwards a\ngeneral discharge of all the muskets took place, in token of joy.  The\nKing and Queen set off from Versailles at one o’clock.  The Dauphin,\nMadame, the King’s daughter, Monsieur, Madame,–[Madame, here, the wife\nof Monsieur le Comte de Provence.]– Madame Elisabeth, and Madame de\nTourzel, were in the carriage; the Princesse de Chimay and the ladies of\nthe bedchamber for the week, the King’s suite and servants, followed in\nCourt carriages; a hundred deputies in carriages, and the bulk of the\nParisian army, closed the procession.",
        "The poissardes went before and around the carriage of their Majesties,\nCrying, “We shall no longer want bread!  We have the baker, the baker’s\nwife, and the baker’s boy with us!”  In the midst of this troop of\ncannibals the heads of two murdered Body Guards were carried on poles.\nThe monsters, who made trophies of them, conceived the horrid idea of\nforcing a wigmaker of Sevres to dress them up and powder their bloody\nlocks.  The unfortunate man who was forced to perform this dreadful work\ndied in consequence of the shock it gave him.",
        "     [The King did not leave Versailles till one o’clock.  The Queen, the\n     Dauphin, Madame Royale, Monsieur, Madame Elisabeth, and Madame de\n     Tourzel were in his Majesty’s carriage.  The hundred deputies in\n     their carriages came next.  A detachment of brigands, bearing the\n     heads of the two Body Guards in triumph, formed the advance guard,\n     and set out two hours earlier.  These cannibals stopped a moment at\n     Sevres, and carried their cruelty to the length of forcing an\n     unfortunate hairdresser to dress the gory heads; the bulk of the\n     Parisian army followed them closely.  The King’s carriage was\n     preceded by the ’poissardes’, who had arrived the day before from\n     Paris, and a rabble of prostitutes, the vile refuse of their sex,\n     still drunk with fury and wine.  Several of them rode astride upon\n     cannons, boasting, in the most horrible songs, of the crimes they\n     had committed themselves, or seen others commit.  Those who were\n     nearest the King’s carriage sang ballads, the allusions in which by\n     means of their vulgar gestures they applied to the Queen.  Wagons,\n     full of corn and flour,–which had been brought into Versailles,\n     formed a train escorted by grenadiers, and surrounded by women and\n     bullies, some armed with pikes, and some carrying long branches of\n     poplar.  At some distance this part of the procession had a most\n     singular effect: it looked like a moving forest, amidst which shone\n     pike-heads and gun-barrels.  In the paroxysms of their brutal joy\n     the women stopped passengers, and, pointing to the King’s carriage,\n     howled in their ears: “Cheer up, friends; we shall no longer be in\n     want of bread!  We bring you the baker, the baker’s wife, and the\n     baker’s little boy!”  Behind his Majesty’s carriage were several of\n     his faithful Guards, some on foot, and some on horseback, most of\n     them uncovered, all unarmed, and worn out with hunger and fatigue;\n     the dragoons, the Flanders regiment, the hundred Swiss, and the\n     National Guards preceded, accompanied, or followed the file of\n     carriages.  I witnessed this heartrending spectacle; I saw the\n     ominous procession.  In the midst of all the tumult, clamour, and\n     singing, interrupted by frequent discharges of musketry, which the\n     hand of a monster or a bungler might so easily render fatal, I saw\n     the Queen preserving most courageous tranquillity of soul, and an\n     air of nobleness and inexpressible dignity, and my eyes were\n     suffused with tears of admiration and grief.–\"Memoirs of Bertrand\n     de Molleville.\"]",
        "The progress of the procession was so slow that it was near six in the\nevening when this august family, made prisoners by their own people,\narrived at the Hotel de Ville.  Bailly received them there; they\nwere placed upon a throne, just when that of their ancestors had been\noverthrown.  The King spoke in a firm yet gracious manner; he said that\nhe always came with pleasure and confidence among the inhabitants of his\ngood city of Paris.  M. Bailly repeated this observation to the\nrepresentatives of the commune, who came to address the King; but he\nforgot the word confidence.  The Queen instantly and loudly reminded him\nof the omission.  The King and Queen, their children, and Madame\nElisabeth, retired to the Tuileries.  Nothing was ready for their\nreception there.  All the living-rooms had been long given up to persons\nbelonging to the Court; they hastily quitted them on that day, leaving\ntheir furniture, which was purchased by the Court.  The Comtesse de la\nMarck, sister to the Marechaux de Noailles and de Mouchy, had occupied\nthe apartments now appropriated to the Queen.  Monsieur and Madame\nretired to the Luxembourg.",
        "The Queen had sent for me on the morning of the 6th of October, to leave\nme and my father-in-law in charge of her most valuable property.  She\ntook away only her casket of diamonds.  Comte Gouvernet de la Tour-du-\nPin, to whom the military government of Versailles was entrusted ’pro\ntempore’, came and gave orders to the National Guard, which had taken\npossession of the apartments, to allow us to remove everything that we\nshould deem necessary for the Queen’s accommodation.",
        "I saw her Majesty alone in her private apartments a moment before her\ndeparture for Paris; she could hardly speak; tears bedewed her face, to\nwhich all the blood in her body seemed to have rushed; she condescended\nto embrace me, gave her hand to M. Campan to kiss, and said to us, “Come\nimmediately and settle at Paris; I will lodge you at the Tuileries; come,\nand do not leave me henceforward; faithful servants at moments like these\nbecome useful friends; we are lost, dragged away, perhaps to death; when\nkings become prisoners they are very near it.”",
        "I had frequent opportunities during the course of our misfortunes of\nobserving that the people never entirely give their allegiance to\nfactious leaders, but easily escape their control when some cause reminds\nthem of their duty.  As soon as the most violent Jacobins had an\nopportunity of seeing the Queen near at hand, of speaking to her, and of\nhearing her voice, they became her most zealous partisans; and even when\nshe was in the prison of the Temple several of those who had contributed\nto place her there perished for having attempted to get her out again.",
        "On the morning of the 7th of October the same women who the day before\nsurrounded the carriage of the august prisoners, riding on cannons and\nuttering the most abusive language, assembled under the Queen’s windows,\nupon the terrace of the Chateau, and desired to see her.  Her Majesty\nappeared.  There are always among mobs of this description orators, that\nis to say, beings who have more assurance than the rest; a woman of this\ndescription told the Queen that she must now remove far from her all such\ncourtiers as ruin kings, and that she must love the inhabitants of her\ngood city.  The Queen answered that she had loved them at Versailles, and\nwould likewise love them at Paris.  “Yes, yes,” said another; “but on the\n14th of July you wanted to besiege the city and have it bombarded; and on\nthe 6th of October you wanted to fly to the frontiers.”  The Queen\nreplied, affably, that they had been told so, and had believed it; that\nthere lay the cause of the unhappiness of the people and of the best of\nkings.  A third addressed a few words to her in German: the Queen told\nher she did not understand it; that she had become so entirely French as\neven to have forgotten her mother tongue.  This declaration was answered\nwith “Bravo!” and clapping of hands; they then desired her to make a\ncompact with them.  “Ah,” said she, “how can I make a compact with you,\nsince you have no faith in that which my duty points out to me, and which\nI ought for my own happiness to respect?”  They asked her for the ribbons\nand flowers out of her hat; her Majesty herself unfastened them and gave\nthem; they were divided among the party, which for above half an hour\ncried out, without ceasing, “Marie Antoinette for ever!  Our good Queen\nfor ever!”",
        "Two days after the King’s arrival at Paris, the city and the National\nGuard sent to request the Queen to appear at the theatre, and prove by\nher presence and the King’s that it was with pleasure they resided in\ntheir capital.  I introduced the deputation which came to make this\nrequest.  Her Majesty replied that she should have infinite pleasure in\nacceding to the invitation of the city of Paris; but that time must be\nallowed her to soften the recollection of the distressing events which\nhad just occurred, and from which she had suffered too much.  She added,\nthat having come into Paris preceded by the heads of the faithful Guards\nwho had perished before the door of their sovereign, she could not think\nthat such an entry into the capital ought to be followed by rejoicings;\nbut that the happiness she had always felt in appearing in the midst of\nthe inhabitants of Paris was not effaced from her memory, and that she\nshould enjoy it again as soon as she found herself able to do so.",
        "Their Majesties found some consolation in their private life: from\nMadame’s–[Madame, here, the Princesse Marie Therese, daughter of Marie\nAntoinette.]–gentle manners and filial affection, from the\naccomplishments and vivacity of the little Dauphin, and the attention and\ntenderness of the pious Princess Elisabeth, they still derived moments of\nhappiness.  The young Prince daily gave proofs of sensibility and\npenetration; he was not yet beyond female care, but a private tutor, the\nAbbe Davout, gave him all the instruction suitable to his age; his memory\nwas highly cultivated, and he recited verses with much grace and feeling.",
        "     [On the 19th of October, that is to say, thirteen days after he had\n     taken up his abode at Paris, the King went, on foot and almost\n     alone, to review some detachments of the National Guard.  After the\n     review Louis XVI. met with a child sweeping the street, who asked\n     him for money.  The child called the King “M. le Chevalier.”  His\n     Majesty gave him six francs.  The little sweeper, surprised at\n     receiving so large a sum, cried out, “Oh! I have no change; you will\n     give me money another time.”  A person who accompanied the monarch\n     said to the child, “Keep it all, my friend; the gentleman is not\n     chevalier, he is the eldest of the family.\"–NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]",
        "The day after the arrival of the Court at Paris, terrified at hearing\nsome noise in the gardens of the Tuileries, the young prince threw\nhimself into the arms of the Queen, crying out, “Grand-Dieu, mamma! will\nit be yesterday over again?”  A few days after this affecting\nexclamation, he went up to the King, and looked at him with a pensive\nair.  The King asked him what he wanted; he answered, that he had\nsomething very serious to say to him.  The King having prevailed on him\nto explain himself, the young Prince asked why his people, who formerly\nloved him so well, were all at once angry with him; and what he had done\nto irritate them so much.  His father took him upon his knees, and spoke\nto him nearly as follows: “I wished, child, to render the people still\nhappier than they were; I wanted money to pay the expenses occasioned by\nwars.  I asked my people for money, as my predecessors have always done;\nmagistrates, composing the Parliament, opposed it, and said that my\npeople alone had a right to consent to it.  I assembled the principal\ninhabitants of every town, whether distinguished by birth, fortune, or\ntalents, at Versailles; that is what is called the States General.  When\nthey were assembled they required concessions of me which I could not\nmake, either with due respect for myself or with justice to you, who will\nbe my successor; wicked men inducing the people to rise have occasioned\nthe excesses of the last few days; the people must not be blamed for\nthem.”",
        "The Queen made the young Prince clearly comprehend that he ought to treat\nthe commanders of battalions, the officers of the National Guard, and all\nthe Parisians who were about him, with affability; the child took great\npains to please all those people, and when he had had an opportunity of\nreplying obligingly to the mayor or members of the commune he came and\nwhispered in his mother’s ear, “Was that right?”",
        "He requested M. Bailly to show him the shield of Scipio, which is in the\nroyal library; and M. Bailly asking him which he preferred, Scipio or\nHannibal, the young Prince replied, without hesitation, that he preferred\nhim who had defended his own country.  He gave frequent proofs of ready\nwit.  One day, while the Queen was hearing Madame repeat her exercises in\nancient history, the young Princess could not at the moment recollect the\nname of the Queen of Carthage; the Dauphin was vexed at his sister’s want\nof memory, and though he never spoke to her in the second person\nsingular, he bethought himself of the expedient of saying to her, “But\n’dis donc’ the name of the Queen, to mamma; ’dis donc’ what her name\nwas.”",
        "Shortly after the arrival of the King and his family at Paris the\nDuchesse de Luynes came, in pursuance of the advice of a committee of the\nConstitutional Assembly, to propose to the Queen a temporary retirement\nfrom France, in order to leave the constitution to perfect itself, so\nthat the patriots should not accuse her of influencing the King to oppose\nit.  The Duchess knew how far the schemes of the conspirers extended,\nand her attachment to the Queen was the principal cause of the advice she\ngave her.  The Queen perfectly comprehended the Duchesse de Luynes’s\nmotive; but replied that she would never leave either the King or her\nson; that if she thought herself alone obnoxious to public hatred she\nwould instantly offer her life as a sacrifice;–but that it was the\nthrone which was aimed at, and that, in abandoning the King, she should\nbe merely committing an act of cowardice, since she saw no other\nadvantage in it than that of saving her own life.",
        "One evening, in the month of November, 1790, I returned home rather late;\nI there found the Prince de Poix; he told me he came to request me to\nassist him in regaining his peace of mind; that at the commencement of\nthe sittings of the National Assembly he had suffered himself to be\nseduced into the hope of a better order of things; that he blushed for\nhis error, and that he abhorred plans which had already produced such\nfatal results; that he broke with the reformers for the rest of his life;\nthat he had given in his resignation as a deputy of the National\nAssembly; and, finally, that he was anxious that the Queen should not\nsleep in ignorance of his sentiments.  I undertook his commission, and\nacquitted myself of it in the best way I could; but I was totally\nunsuccessful.  The Prince de Poix remained at Court; he there suffered\nmany mortifications, never ceasing to serve the King in the most\ndangerous commissions with that zeal for which his house has always been\ndistinguished.",
        "When the King, the Queen, and the children were suitably established at\nthe Tuileries, as well as Madame Elisabeth and the Princesse de Lamballe,\nthe Queen resumed her usual habits; she employed her mornings in\nsuperintending the education of Madame, who received all her lessons in\nher presence, and she herself began to work large pieces of tapestry.\nHer mind was too much occupied with passing events and surrounding\ndangers to admit her of applying herself to reading; the needle was the\nonly employment which could divert her.",
        "     [There was long preserved at Paris, in the house of Mademoiselle\n     Dubuquois, a tapestry-worker, a carpet worked by the Queen and\n     Madame Elisabeth for the large room of her Majesty’s ground-floor\n     apartments at the Tuileries.  The Empress Josephine saw and admired\n     this carpet, and desired it might be taken care of, in the hope of\n     one day sending it to Madame–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "She received the Court twice a week before going to mass, and on those\ndays dined in public with the King; she spent the rest of the time with\nher family and children; she had no concert, and did not go to the play\nuntil 1791, after the acceptation of the constitution.  The Princesse de\nLamballe, however, had some evening parties in her apartments at the\nTuileries, which were tolerably brilliant in consequence of the great\nnumber of persons who attended them.  The Queen was present at a few of\nthese assemblies; but being soon convinced that her present situation\nforbade her appearing much in public, she remained at home, and conversed\nas she sat at work.  The sole topic of her discourse was, as may well be\nsupposed, the Revolution.  She sought to discover the real opinions of\nthe Parisians respecting her, and how she could have so completely lost\nthe affections of the people, and even of many persons in the higher\nranks.  She well knew that she ought to impute the whole to the spirit of\nparty, to the hatred of the Duc d’Orleans, and the folly of the French,\nwho desired to have a total change in the constitution; but she was not\nthe less desirous of ascertaining the private feelings of all the people\nin power.",
        "From the very commencement of the Revolution General Luckner indulged in\nviolent sallies against her.  Her Majesty, knowing that I was acquainted\nwith a lady who had been long connected with the General, desired me to\ndiscover through that channel what was the private motive on which\nLuckner’s hatred against her was founded.  On being questioned upon this\npoint, he answered that Marechal de Segur had assured him he had proposed\nhim for the command of a camp of observation, but that the Queen had made\na bar against his name; and that this ’par’, as he called it, in his\nGerman accent, he could not forget.",
        "The Queen ordered me to repeat this reply to the King myself, and said to\nhim: “See, Sire, whether I was not right in telling you that your\nministers, in order to give themselves full scope in the distribution of\nfavours, persuaded the French that I interfered in everything; there was\nnot a single license given out in the country for the sale of salt or\ntobacco but the people believed it was given to one of my favourites.”",
        "“That is very, true,” replied the King; “but I find it very difficult to\nbelieve that Marechal de Segur ever said any such thing to Luckner; he\nknew too well that you never interfered in the distribution of favours.",
        "“That Luckner is a good-for-nothing fellow, and Segur is a brave and\nhonourable man who never uttered such a falsehood; however, you are\nright; and because you provided for a few dependents, you are most\nunjustly reported to have disposed of all offices, civil and military.”",
        "All the nobility who had not left Paris made a point of presenting\nthemselves assiduously to the King, and there was a considerable influx\nto the Tuileries.  Marks of attachment were exhibited even in external\nsymbols; the women wore enormous bouquets of lilies in their bosoms and\nupon their heads, and sometimes even bunches of white ribbon.  At the\nplay there were often disputes between the pit and the boxes about\nremoving these ornaments, which the people thought dangerous emblems.\nNational cockades were sold in every corner of Paris; the sentinels\nstopped all who did not wear them; the young men piqued themselves upon\nbreaking through this regulation, which was in some degree sanctioned by\nthe acquiescence of Louis XVI.  Frays took place, which were to be\nregretted, because they excited a spirit of lawlessness.  The King\nadopted conciliatory measures with the Assembly in order to promote\ntranquillity; the revolutionists were but little disposed to think him\nsincere; unfortunately the royalists encouraged this incredulity by\nincessantly repeating that the King was not free, and that all that he\ndid was completely null, and in no way bound him for the time to come.\nSuch was the heat and violence of party spirit that persons the most\nsincerely attached to the King were not even permitted to use the\nlanguage of reason, and recommend greater reserve in conversation.\nPeople would talk and argue at table without considering that all the\nservants belonged to the hostile army; and it may truly be said there was\nas much imprudence and levity in the party assailed as there was cunning,\nboldness, and perseverance in that which made the attack.",
        "In February, 1790, another matter gave the Court much uneasiness; a\nzealous individual of the name of Favras had conceived the scheme of\ncarrying off the King, and affecting a counter-revolution.  Monsieur,\nprobably out of mere benevolence, gave him some money, and thence arose a\nreport that he thereby wished to favour the execution of the enterprise.\nThe step taken by Monsieur in going to the Hotel de Ville to explain\nhimself on this matter was unknown to the Queen; it is more than probable\nthat the King was acquainted with it.  When judgment was pronounced upon\nM. de Favras the Queen did not conceal from me her fears about the\nconfessions of the unfortunate man in his last moments.",
        "I sent a confidential person to the Hotel de Ville; she came to inform\nthe Queen that the condemned had demanded to be taken from Notre-Dame to\nthe Hotel de Ville to make a final declaration, and give some particulars\nverifying it.  These particulars compromised nobody; Favras corrected his\nlast will after writing it, and went to the scaffold with heroic courage\nand coolness.  The judge who read his condemnation to him told him that\nhis life was a sacrifice which he owed to public tranquillity.  It was\nasserted at the time that Favras was given up as a victim in order to\nsatisfy the people and save the Baron de Besenval, who was a prisoner in\nthe Abbaye.",
        "     [Thomas Mahy, Marquis de Favras, was accused in the month of\n     December, 1789, of having conspired against the Revolution.  Having\n     been arrested by order of the committee of inquiry of the National\n     Assembly, he was transferred to the Chatelet, where he defended\n     himself with much coolness and presence of mind, repelling the\n     accusations brought against him by Morel, Turcati, and Marquis, with\n     considerable force.  These witnesses declared he had imparted his\n     plan to them; it was to be carried into execution by 12,000 Swiss\n     and 12,000 Germans, who were to be assembled at Montargis, thence to\n     march upon Paris, carry off the King, and assassinate Bailly, La\n     Fayette, and Necker.  The greater number of these charges he denied,\n     and declared that the rest related only to the levy of a troop\n     intended to favour the revolution preparing in Brabant.  The judge\n     having refused to disclose who had denounced him, he complained to\n     the Assembly, which passed to the order of the day.  His death was\n     obviously inevitable.  During the whole time of the proceedings the\n     populace never ceased threatening the judges and shouting, “A la\n     lanterne!”  It was even necessary to keep numerous troops and\n     artillery constantly ready to act in the courtyard of the Chatelet.\n     The judges, who had just acquitted M. de Besenval in an affair\n     nearly similar, doubtless dreaded the effects of this fury.  When\n     they refused to hear Favras’s witnesses in exculpation, he compared\n     them to the tribunal of the Inquisition.  The principal charge\n     against him was founded on a letter from M. de Foucault, asking him,\n     “where are your troops?  in which direction will they enter Paris?\n     I should like to be employed among them.”  Favras was condemned to\n     make the ’amende honorable’ in front of the Cathedral, and to be\n     hanged at the Place de Greve.  He heard this sentence with wonderful\n     calmness, and said to his judges, “I pity you much if the testimony\n     of two men is sufficient to induce you to condemn.”  The judge\n     having said to him, “I have no other consolation to hold out to you\n     than that which religion affords,” he replied, nobly, “My greatest\n     consolation is that which I derive from my innocence.\"–\"Biographic\n     Universelle\"]",
        "On the morning of the Sunday following this execution M. de la Villeurnoy\ncame to my house to tell me that he was going that day to the public\ndinner of the King and Queen to present Madame de Favras and her son,\nboth of them in mourning for the brave Frenchman who fell a sacrifice for\nhis King; and that all the royalists expected to see the Queen load the\nunfortunate family with favours.  I did all that lay in my power to\nprevent this proceeding.  I foresaw the effect it would have upon the\nQueen’s feeling heart, and the painful constraint she would experience,\nhaving the horrible Santerre, the commandant of a battalion of the\nParisian guard, behind her chair during dinner-time.  I could not make\nM. de la Villeurnoy comprehend my argument; the Queen was gone to mass,\nsurrounded by her whole Court, and I had not even means of apprising her\nof his intention.",
        "When dinner was over I heard a knocking at the door of my apartment,\nwhich opened into the corridor next that of the Queen; it was herself.\nShe asked me whether there was anybody with me; I was alone; she threw\nherself into an armchair, and told me she came to weep with me over the\nfoolish conduct of the ultras of the King’s party.  “We must fall,” said\nshe, “attacked as we are by men who possess every talent and shrink from\nno crime, while we are defended only by those who are no doubt very\nestimable, but have no adequate idea of our situation.  They have exposed\nme to the animosity of both parties by presenting the widow and son of\nFavras to me.  Were I free to act as I wish, I should take the child of\nthe man who has just sacrificed himself for us and place him at table\nbetween the King and myself; but surrounded by the assassins who have\ndestroyed his father, I did not dare even to cast my eyes upon him.  The\nroyalists will blame me for not having appeared interested in this poor\nchild; the revolutionists will be enraged at the idea that his\npresentation should have been thought agreeable to me.”  However, the\nQueen added that she knew Madame de Favras was in want, and that she\ndesired me to send her next day, through a person who could be relied on,\na few rouleaus of fifty Louis, and to direct that she should be assured\nher Majesty would always watch over the fortunes of herself and her son.",
        "In the month of March following I had an opportunity of ascertaining the\nKing’s sentiments respecting the schemes which were continually proposed\nto him for making his escape.  One night about ten o’clock Comte\nd’Inisdal, who was deputed by the nobility, came to request that I would\nsee him in private, as he had an important matter to communicate to me.\nHe told me that on that very night the King was to be carried off; that\nthe section of the National Guard, that day commanded by M. d’Aumont,\nwas gained over, and that sets of horses, furnished by some good\nroyalists, were placed in relays at suitable distances; that he had just\nleft a number of the nobility assembled for the execution of this scheme,\nand that he had been sent to me that I might, through the medium of the\nQueen, obtain the King’s positive consent to it before midnight; that the\nKing was aware of their plan, but that his Majesty never would speak\ndecidedly, and that it was necessary he should consent to the\nundertaking.  I greatly displeased Comte d’Inisdal by expressing my\nastonishment that the nobility at the moment of the execution of so\nimportant a project should send to me, the Queen’s first woman, to obtain\na consent which ought to have been the basis of any well-concerted\nscheme.  I told him, also, that it would be impossible for me to go at\nthat time to the Queen’s apartments without exciting the attention of the\npeople in the antechambers; that the King was at cards with the Queen and\nhis family, and that I never broke in upon their privacy unless I was\ncalled for.  I added, however, that M. Campan could enter without being\ncalled; and if the Count chose to give him his confidence he might rely\nupon him.",
        "My father-in-law, to whom Comte d’Inisdal repeated what he had said to\nme, took the commission upon himself, and went to the Queen’s apartments.\nThe King was playing at whist with the Queen, Monsieur, and Madame;\nMadame Elisabeth was kneeling on a stool near the table.  M. Campan\ninformed the Queen of what had been communicated to me; nobody uttered a\nword.  The Queen broke silence and said to the King, “Do you hear, Sire,\nwhat Campan says to us?\"–\"Yes, I hear,” said the King, and continued his\ngame.  Monsieur, who was in the habit of introducing passages from plays\ninto his conversation, said to my father-in-law, “M. Campan, that pretty\nlittle couplet again, if you please;” and pressed the King to reply.  At\nlength the Queen said, “But something must be said to Campan.”  The King\nthen spoke to my father-in-law in these words: “Tell M. d’Inisdal that I\ncannot consent to be carried off!”  The Queen enjoined M. Campan to take\ncare and, report this answer faithfully.  “You understand,” added she,\n\"the King cannot consent to be carried off.”",
        "Comte d’Inisdal was very much dissatisfied with the King’s answer, and\nwent out, saying, “I understand; he wishes to throw all the blame,\nbeforehand, upon those who are to devote themselves for him.”",
        "He went away, and I thought the enterprise would be abandoned.  However,\nthe Queen remained alone with me till midnight, preparing her cases of\nvaluables, and ordered me not to go to bed.  She imagined the King’s\nanswer would be understood as a tacit consent, and merely a refusal to\nparticipate in the design.  I do not know what passed in the King’s\napartments during the night; but I occasionally looked out at the\nwindows: I saw the garden clear; I heard no noise in the palace, and day\nat length confirmed my opinion that the project had been given up.  “We\nmust, however, fly,” said the Queen to me, shortly afterwards; “who knows\nhow far the factious may go?  The danger increases every day.”",
        "     [The disturbances of the 13th of April, 1790, occasioned by the\n     warmth of the discussions upon Dom Gerle’s imprudent motion in the\n     National Assembly, having afforded room for apprehension that the\n     enemies of the country would endeavour to carry off the King from\n     the capital, M. de La Fayette promised to keep watch, and told Louis\n     XVI. that if he saw any alarming movement among the disaffected he\n     would give him notice of it by the discharge of a cannon from Henri\n     IV.’s battery on the Pont Neuf.  On the same night a few casual\n     discharges of musketry were heard from the terrace of the Tuileries.\n     The King, deceived by the noise, flew to the Queen’s apartments; he\n     did not find her; he ran to the Dauphin’s room, where he found the\n     Queen holding her son in her arms. “Madame;” said the King to her,\n     “I have been seeking you; and you have made me uneasy.”  The Queen,\n     showing her son, said to him, “I was at my post.\"–\"Anecdotes of the\n     Reign of Louis XVI.\"]",
        "This Princess received advice and memorials from all quarters.  Rivarol\naddressed several to her, which I read to her.  They were full of\ningenious observations; but the Queen did not find that they, contained\nanything of essential service under the circumstances in which the royal\nfamily was placed.  Comte du Moustier also sent memorials and plans of\nconduct.  I remember that in one of his writings he said to the King,\n\"Read ’Telemachus’ again, Sire; in that book which delighted your Majesty\nin infancy you will find the first seeds of those principles which,\nerroneously followed up by men of ardent imaginations, are bringing on\nthe explosion we expect every moment.”  I read so many of these memorials\nthat I could hardly give a faithful account of them, and I am determined\nto note in this work no other events than such as I witnessed; no other\nwords than such as (notwithstanding the lapse of time) still in some\nmeasure vibrate in my ears.",
        "Comte de Segur, on his return from Russia, was employed some time by the\nQueen, and had a certain degree of influence over her; but that did not\nlast long.  Comte Augustus de la Marck likewise endeavoured to negotiate\nfor the King’s advantage with the leaders of the factious.  M. de\nFontanges, Archbishop of Toulouse, possessed also the Queen’s confidence;\nbut none of the endeavours which were made on the spot produced any,\nbeneficial result.  The Empress Catherine II. also conveyed her opinion\nupon the situation of Louis XVI. to the Queen, and her Majesty made me\nread a few lines in the Empress’s own handwriting, which concluded with\nthese words:",
        "“Kings ought to proceed in their career undisturbed by the cries of the\npeople, even as the moon pursues her course unimpeded by the baying of\ndogs.”  This maxim of the despotic sovereign of Russia was very\ninapplicable to the situation of a captive king.",
        "Meanwhile the revolutionary party followed up its audacious enterprise in\na determined manner, without meeting any opposition.  The advice from\nwithout, as well from Coblentz as from Vienna, made various impressions\nupon the members of the royal family, and those cabinets were not in\naccordance with each other.  I often had reason to infer from what the\nQueen said to me that she thought the King, by leaving all the honour of\nrestoring order to the Coblentz party,–[The Princes and the chief of the\nemigrant nobility assembled at Coblentz, and the name was used to\ndesignate the reactionary party.]–would, on the return of the emigrants,\nbe put under a kind of guardianship which would increase his own\nmisfortunes.  She frequently said to me, “If the emigrants succeed, they\nwill rule the roast for a long time; it will be impossible to refuse them\nanything; to owe the crown to them would be contracting too great an\nobligation.”  It always appeared to me that she wished her own family to\ncounterbalance the claims of the emigrants by disinterested services.\nShe was fearful of M. de Calonne, and with good reason.  She had proof\nthat this minister was her bitterest enemy, and that he made use of the\nmost criminal means in order to blacken her reputation.  I can testify\nthat I have seen in the hands of the Queen a manuscript copy of the\ninfamous memoirs of the woman De Lamotte, which had been brought to her\nfrom London, and in which all those passages where a total ignorance of\nthe customs of Courts had occasioned that wretched woman to make blunders\nwhich would have been too palpable were corrected in M. de Calonne’s own\nhandwriting.",
        "The two King’s Guards who were wounded at her Majesty’s door on the 6th\nof October were M. du Repaire and M. de Miomandre de Sainte-Marie; on the\ndreadful night of the 6th of October the latter took the post of the\nformer the moment he became incapable of maintaining it.",
        "A considerable number of the Body Guards, who were wounded on the 6th of\nOctober, betook themselves to the infirmary at Versailles.  The brigands\nwanted to make their way into the infirmary in order to massacre them.\nM. Viosin, head surgeon of that infirmary, ran to the entrance hall,\ninvited the assailants to refresh themselves, ordered wine to be brought,\nand found means to direct the Sister Superior to remove the Guards into a\nward appropriated to the poor, and dress them in the caps and greatcoats\nfurnished by the institution.  The good sisters executed this order so\npromptly that the Guards were removed, dressed as paupers, and their beds\nmade, while the assassins were drinking.  They searched all the wards,\nand fancied they saw no persons there but the sick poor; thus the Guards\nwere saved.",
        "M. de Miomandre was at Paris, living on terms of friendship with another\nof the Guards, who, on the same day, received a gunshot wound from the\nbrigands in another part of the Chateau.  These two officers, who were\nattended and cured together at the infirmary of Versailles, were almost\nconstant companions; they were recognised at the Palais Royal, and\ninsulted.  The Queen thought it necessary for them to quit Paris.  She\ndesired me to write to M. de Miomandre de Sainte-Marie, and tell him to\ncome to me at eight o’clock in the evening; and then to communicate to\nhim her wish to hear of his being in safety; and ordered me, when he had\nmade up his mind to go, to tell him in her name that gold could not repay\nsuch a service as he had rendered; that she hoped some day to be in\nsufficiently happy circumstances to recompense him as she ought; but that\nfor the present her offer of money was only that of a sister to a brother\nsituated as he then was, and that she requested he would take whatever\nmight be necessary to discharge his debts at Paris and defray the\nexpenses of his journey.  She told me also to desire he would bring his.\nfriend Bertrand with him, and to make him the same offer.",
        "The two Guards came at the appointed hour, and accepted, I think, each\none or two hundred louis.  A moment afterwards the Queen opened my door;\nshe was accompanied by the King and Madame Elisabeth; the King stood with\nhis back against the fireplace; the Queen sat down upon a sofa and Madame\nElisabeth sat near her; I placed myself behind the Queen, and the two\nGuards stood facing the King.  The Queen told them that the King wished\nto see before they went away two of the brave men who had afforded him\nthe strongest proofs of courage and attachment.  Miomandre said all that\nthe Queen’s affecting observations were calculated to inspire.  Madame\nElisabeth spoke of the King’s gratitude; the Queen resumed the subject of\ntheir speedy departure, urging the necessity of it; the King was silent;\nbut his emotion was evident, and his eyes were suffused with tears.  The\nQueen rose, the King went out, and Madame Elisabeth followed him; the\nQueen stopped and said to me, in the recess of a window, “I am sorry I\nbrought the King here!  I am sure Elisabeth thinks with me; if the King\nhad but given utterance to a fourth part of what he thinks of those brave\nmen they would have been in ecstacies; but he cannot overcome his\ndiffidence.”",
        "The Emperor Joseph died about this time.  The Queen’s grief was not\nexcessive; that brother of whom she had been so proud, and whom she had\nloved so tenderly, had probably suffered greatly in her opinion; she\nreproached him sometimes, though with moderation, for having adopted\nseveral of the principles of the new philosophy, and perhaps she knew\nthat he looked upon our troubles with the eye of the sovereign of Germany\nrather than that of the brother of the Queen of France.",
        "The Emperor on one occasion sent the Queen an engraving which represented\nunfrocked nuns and monks.  The first were trying on fashionable dresses,\nthe latter were having their hair arranged; the picture was always left\nin the closet, and never hung up.  The Queen told me to have it taken\naway; for she was hurt to see how much influence the philosophers had\nover her brother’s mind and actions.",
        "Mirabeau had not lost the hope of becoming the last resource of the\noppressed Court; and at this time some communications passed between the\nQueen and him.  The question was about an office to be conferred upon\nhim.  This transpired, and it must have been about this period that the\nAssembly decreed that no deputy could hold an office as a minister of the\nKing until the expiration of two years after the cessation of his\nlegislative functions.  I know that the Queen was much hurt at this\ndecision, and considered that the Court had lost a promising opening.",
        "The palace of the Tuileries was a very disagreeable residence during the\nsummer, which made the Queen wish to go to St. Cloud.  The removal was\ndecided on without any opposition; the National Guard of Paris followed\nthe Court thither.  At this period new opportunities of escape were\npresented; nothing would have been more easy than to execute them.  The\nKing had obtained leave (!) to go out without guards, and to be\naccompanied only by an aide-de-camp of M. de La Fayette.  The Queen also\nhad one on duty with her, and so had the Dauphin.  The King and Queen\noften went out at four in the afternoon, and did not return until eight\nor nine.",
        "I will relate one of the plans of emigration which the Queen communicated\nto me, the success of which seemed infallible.  The royal family were to\nmeet in a wood four leagues from St. Cloud; some persons who could be\nfully relied on were to accompany the King, who was always followed by\nhis equerries and pages; the Queen was to join him with her daughter and\nMadame Elisabeth.  These Princesses, as well as the Queen, had equerries\nand pages, of whose fidelity no doubt could be entertained.  The Dauphin\nlikewise was to be at the place of rendezvous with Madame de Tourzel;\na large berlin and a chaise for the attendants were sufficient for the\nwhole family; the aides-de-camp were to have been gained over or\nmastered.  The King was to leave a letter for the President of the\nNational Assembly on his bureau at St. Cloud.  The people in the service\nof the King and Queen would have waited until nine in the evening without\nanxiety, because the family sometimes did not return until that hour.\nThe letter could not be forwarded to Paris until ten o’clock at the\nearliest.  The Assembly would not then be sitting; the President must\nhave been sought for at his own house or elsewhere; it would have been\nmidnight before the Assembly could have been summoned and couriers sent\noff to have the royal family stopped; but the latter would have been six\nor seven hours in advance, as they would have started at six leagues’\ndistance from Paris; and at this period travelling was not yet impeded in\nFrance.",
        "The Queen approved of this plan; but I did not venture to interrogate\nher, and I even thought if it were put in execution she would leave me in\nignorance of it.  One evening in the month of June the people of the\nChateau, finding the King did not return by nine o’clock, were walking\nabout the courtyards in a state of great anxiety.  I thought the family,\nwas gone, and I could scarcely breathe amidst the confusion of my good\nwishes, when I heard the sound of the carriages.  I confessed to the\nQueen that I thought she had set off; she told me she must wait until\nMesdames the King’s aunts had quitted France, and afterwards see whether\nthe plan agreed with those formed abroad.",
        "There was a meeting at Paris for the first federation on the 14th of\nJuly, 1790, the anniversary of the taking of the Bastille.  What an\nastonishing assemblage of four hundred thousand men, of whom there were\nnot perhaps two hundred who did not believe that the King found happiness\nand glory in the order of things then being established.  The love which\nwas borne him by all, with the exception of those who meditated his ruin,\nstill reigned in the hearts of the French in the departments; but if I\nmay judge from those whom I had an opportunity of seeing, it was totally\nimpossible to enlighten them; they were as much attached to the King as\nto the constitution, and to the constitution as to the King; and it was\nimpossible to separate the one from the other in their hearts and minds.",
        "The Court returned to St. Cloud after the federation.  A wretch, named\nRotondo, made his way into the palace with the intention of assassinating\nthe Queen.  It is known that he penetrated to the inner gardens: the rain\nprevented her Majesty from going out that day.  M. de La Fayette, who was\naware of this plot, gave all the sentinels the strictest orders, and a\ndescription of the monster was distributed throughout the palace by order\nof the General.  I do not know how he was saved from punishment.\nThe police belonging to the King discovered that there was likewise a\nscheme on foot for poisoning the Queen.  She spoke to me, as well as to\nher head physician, M. Vicq-d’Azyr, about it, without the slightest\nemotion, but both he and I consulted what precautions it would be proper\nto take.  He relied much upon the Queen’s temperance; yet he recommended\nme always to have a bottle of oil of sweet almonds within reach, and to\nrenew it occasionally, that oil and milk being, as is known, the most\ncertain antidotes to the divellication of corrosive poisons.",
        "The Queen had a habit which rendered M. Vicq-d’Azyr particularly uneasy:\nthere was always some pounded sugar upon the table in her Majesty’s\nbedchamber; and she frequently, without calling anybody, put spoonfuls of\nit into a glass of water when she wished to drink.  It was agreed that I\nshould get a considerable quantity of sugar powdered; that I should\nalways have some papers of it in my bag, and that three or four times a\nday, when alone in the Queen’s room, I should substitute it for that in\nher sugar-basin.  We knew that the Queen would have prevented all such\nprecautions, but we were not aware of her reason.  One day she caught me\nalone making this exchange, and told me, she supposed it was agreed on\nbetween myself and M. Vicq-d’Azyr, but that I gave myself very\nunnecessary trouble.  “Remember,” added she, “that not a grain of poison\nwill be put in use against me.  The Brinvilliers do not belong to this\ncentury: this age possesses calumny, which is a much more convenient\ninstrument of death; and it is by that I shall perish.”",
        "Even while melancholy presentiments afflicted this unfortunate Princess,\nmanifestations of attachment to her person, and to the King’s cause,\nwould frequently raise agreeable illusions in her mind, or present to her\nthe affecting spectacle of tears shed for her sorrows.  I was one day,\nduring this same visit to St. Cloud, witness of a very touching scene,\nwhich we took great care to keep secret.  It was four in the afternoon;\nthe guard was not set; there was scarcely anybody at St. Cloud that day,\nand I was reading to the Queen, who was at work in a room the balcony of\nwhich hung over the courtyard.  The windows were closed, yet we heard a\nsort of inarticulate murmur from a great number of voices.  The Queen\ndesired me to go and see what it was; I raised the muslin curtain, and\nperceived more than fifty persons beneath the balcony: this group\nconsisted of women, young and old, perfectly well dressed in the country\ncostume, old chevaliers of St. Louis, young knights of Malta, and a few\necclesiastics.  I told the Queen it was probably an assemblage of persons\nresiding in the neighbourhood who wished to see her.  She rose, opened\nthe window, and appeared in the balcony; immediately all these worthy\npeople said to her, in an undertone: “Courage, Madame; good Frenchmen\nsuffer for you, and with you; they pray for you.  Heaven will hear their\nprayers; we love you, we respect you, we will continue to venerate our\nvirtuous King.”  The Queen burst into tears, and held her handkerchief to\nher eyes.  “Poor Queen! she weeps!”  said the women and young girls; but\nthe dread of exposing her Majesty, and even the persons who showed so\nmuch affection for her, to observation, prompted me to take her hand, and\nprevail upon her to retire into her room; and, raising my eyes, I gave\nthe excellent people to understand that my conduct was dictated by\nprudence.  They comprehended me, for I heard, “That lady is right;” and\nafterwards, “Farewell, Madame!” from several of them; and all this in\naccents of feeling so true and so mournful, that I am affected at the\nrecollection of them even after a lapse of twenty years.",
        "A few days afterwards the insurrection of Nancy took place.",
        "     [The insurrection of the troops at Nancy broke out in August 1790,\n     and was put down by Marechal de Bouille on the last day of that\n     month.  See “Bouille,” p. 195.]",
        "Only the ostensible cause is known; there was another, of which I might\nhave been in full possession, if the great confusion I was in upon the\nsubject had not deprived me of the power of paying attention to it.  I\nwill endeavour to make myself understood.  In the early part of September\nthe Queen, as she was going to bed, desired me to let all her people go,\nand to remain with her myself; when we were alone she said to me, “The\nKing will come here at midnight.  You know that he has always shown you\nmarks of distinction; he now proves his confidence in you by selecting\nyou to write down the whole affair of Nancy from his dictation.  He must\nhave several copies of it.”  At midnight the King came to the Queen’s\napartments, and said to me, smiling, “You did not expect to become my\nsecretary, and that, too, during the night.”  I followed the King into\nthe council chamber.  I found there sheets of paper, an inkstand, and\npens all ready prepared.  He sat down by my side and dictated to me the\nreport of the Marquis de Bouille, which he himself copied at the same\ntime.  My hand trembled; I wrote with difficulty; my reflections scarcely\nleft me sufficient power of attention to listen to the King.  The large\ntable, the velvet cloth, seats which ought to have been filled by none\nbut the King’s chief councillors; what that chamber had been, and what it\nwas at that moment, when the King was employing a woman in an office\nwhich had so little affinity with her ordinary functions; the misfortunes\nwhich had brought him to the necessity of doing so,–all these ideas made\nsuch an impression upon me that when I had returned to the Queen’s\napartments I could not sleep for the remainder of the night, nor could I\nremember what I had written.",
        "The more I saw that I had the happiness to be of some use to my\nemployers, the more scrupulously careful was I to live entirely with my\nfamily; and I never indulged in any conversation which could betray the\nintimacy to which I was admitted; but nothing at Court remains long\nconcealed, and I soon saw I had many enemies.  The means of injuring\nothers in the minds of sovereigns are but too easily obtained, and they\nhad become still more so, since the mere suspicion of communication with\npartisans of the Revolution was sufficient to forfeit the esteem and\nconfidence of the King and Queen; happily, my conduct protected me, with\nthem, against calumny.  I had left St. Cloud two days, when I received at\nParis a note from the Queen, containing these words:",
        "“Come to St. Cloud immediately; I have something concerning you to\ncommunicate.”  I set off without loss of time.  Her Majesty told me she\nhad a sacrifice to request of me; I answered that it was made.  She said\nit went so far as the renunciation of a friend’s society; that such a\nrenunciation was always painful, but that it must be particularly so to\nme; that, for her own part, it might have been very useful that a deputy,\na man of talent, should be constantly received at my house; but at this\nmoment she thought only of my welfare.  The Queen then informed me that\nthe ladies of the bedchamber had, the preceding evening, assured her that\nM. de Beaumetz, deputy from the nobility of Artois, who had taken his\nseat on the left of the Assembly, spent his whole time at my house.\nPerceiving on what false grounds the attempt to injure, me was based,\nI replied respectfully, but at the same time smiling, that it was\nimpossible for me to make the sacrifice exacted by her Majesty; that M.\nde Beaumetz, a man of great judgment, had not determined to cross over to\nthe left of the Assembly with the intention of afterwards making himself\nunpopular by spending his time with the Queen’s first woman; and that,\never since the 1st of October, 1789, I had seen him nowhere but at the\nplay, or in the public walks, and even then without his ever coming to\nspeak to me; that this line of conduct had appeared to me perfectly\nconsistent: for whether he was desirous to please the popular party, or\nto be sought after by the Court, he could not act in any other way\ntowards me.  The Queen closed this explanation by saying, “Oh! it is\nclear, as clear as the day! this opportunity for trying to do you an\ninjury is very ill chosen; but be cautious in your slightest actions; you\nperceive that the confidence placed in you by the King and myself raises\nyou up powerful enemies.”",
        "The private communications which were still kept up between the Court and\nMirabeau at length procured him an interview with the Queen, in the\ngardens of St. Cloud.  He left Paris on horseback, on pretence of going\ninto the country, to M. de Clavieres, one of his friends; but he stopped\nat one of the gates of the gardens of St.  Cloud, and was led to a spot\nsituated in the highest part of the private garden, where the Queen was\nwaiting for him.  She told me she accosted him by saying, “With a common\nenemy, with a man who had sworn to destroy monarchy without appreciating\nits utility among a great people, I should at this moment be guilty of a\nmost ill-advised step; but in speaking to a Mirabeau,” etc.  The poor\nQueen was delighted at having discovered this method of exalting him\nabove all others of his principles; and in imparting the particulars of\nthis interview to me she said, “Do you know that those words,\n’a Mirabeau,’ appeared to flatter him exceedingly.”  On leaving the Queen\nhe said to her with warmth, “Madame, the monarchy is saved!”  It must\nhave been soon afterwards that Mirabeau received considerable sums of\nmoney.  He showed it too plainly by the increase of his expenditure.\nAlready did some of his remarks upon the necessity of arresting the\nprogress of the democrats circulate in society.  Being once invited to\nmeet a person at dinner who was very much attached to the Queen, he\nlearned that that person withdrew on hearing that he was one of the\nguests; the party who invited him told him this with some degree of\nsatisfaction; but all were very much astonished when they heard Mirabeau\neulogise the absent guest, and declare that in his place he would have\ndone the same; but, he added, they had only to invite that person again\nin a few months, and he would then dine with the restorer of the\nmonarchy.  Mirabeau forgot that it was more easy to do harm than good,\nand thought himself the political Atlas of the whole world.",
        "Outrages and mockery were incessantly mingled with the audacious\nproceedings of the revolutionists.  It was customary to give serenades\nunder the King’s windows on New Year’s Day.  The band of the National\nGuard repaired thither on that festival in 1791; in allusion to the\nliquidation of the debts of the State, decreed by the Assembly, they\nplayed solely, and repeatedly, that air from the comic opera of the\n\"Debts,” the burden of which is, “But our creditors are paid, and that\nmakes us easy.”",
        "On the same day some “conquerors of the Bastille,” grenadiers of the\nParisian guard, preceded by military music, came to present to the young\nDauphin, as a New Year’s gift, a box of dominoes, made of some of the\nstone and marble of which that state prison was built.  The Queen gave me\nthis inauspicious curiosity, desiring me to preserve it, as it would be a\ncurious illustration of the history of the Revolution.  Upon the lid were\nengraved some bad verses, the purport of which was as follows: “Stones\nfrom those walls, which enclosed the innocent victims of arbitrary power,\nhave been converted into a toy, to be presented to you, Monseigneur, as a\nmark of the people’s love; and to teach you their power.”",
        "The Queen said that M. de La Fayette’s thirst for popularity induced him\nto lend himself, without discrimination, to all popular follies.  Her\ndistrust of the General increased daily, and grew so powerful that when,\ntowards the end of the Revolution, he seemed willing to support the\ntottering throne, she could never bring herself to incur so great an\nobligation to him.",
        "M. de J––-, a colonel attached to the staff of the army, was fortunate\nenough to render several services to the Queen, and acquitted himself\nwith discretion and dignity of various important missions.",
        "     [During the Queen’s detention in the Temple he introduced himself\n     Into that prison in the dress of a lamplighter, and there discharged\n     his duty unrecognised.–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "Their Majesties had the highest confidence in him, although it frequently\nhappened that his prudence, when inconsiderate projects were under\ndiscussion, brought upon him the charge of adopting the principles of the\nconstitutionals.  Being sent to Turin, he had some difficulty in\ndissuading the Princes from a scheme they had formed at that period of\nreentering France, with a very weak army, by way of Lyons; and when, in a\ncouncil which lasted till three o’clock in the morning, he showed his\ninstructions, and demonstrated that the measure would endanger the King,\nthe Comte d’Artois alone declared against the plan, which emanated from\nthe Prince de Conde.",
        "Among the persons employed in subordinate situations, whom the critical\ncircumstances of the times involved in affairs of importance, was M. de\nGoguelat, a geographical engineer at Versailles, and an excellent\ndraughtsman.  He made plans of St. Cloud and Trianon for the Queen; she\nwas very much pleased with them, and had the engineer admitted into the\nstaff of the army.  At the commencement of the Revolution he was sent to\nCount Esterhazy, at Valenciennes, in the capacity of aide-de-camp.  The\nlatter rank was given him solely to get him away from Versailles, where\nhis rashness endangered the Queen during the earlier months of the\nAssembly of the States General.  Making a parade of his devotion to the\nKing’s interests, he went repeatedly to the tribunes of the Assembly, and\nthere openly railed at all the motions of the deputies, and then returned\nto the Queen’s antechamber, where he repeated all that he had just heard,\nor had had the imprudence to say.  Unfortunately, at the same time that\nthe Queen sent away M. de Goguelat, she still believed that, in a\ndangerous predicament, requiring great self-devotion, the man might be\nemployed advantageously.  In 1791 he was commissioned to act in concert\nwith the Marquis de Bouille in furtherance of the King’s intended escape.",
        "     [See the “Memoirs” of M. de Bouille, those of the Duc de Choiseul,\n     and the account of the journey to Varennes, by M. de Fontanges, in\n     “Weber’s Memoirs.\"–NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]",
        "Projectors in great numbers endeavoured to introduce themselves not only\nto the Queen, but to Madame Elisabeth, who had communications with many\nindividuals who took upon themselves to make plans for the conduct of the\nCourt.  The Baron de Gilliers and M. de Vanoise were of this description;\nthey went to the Baronne de Mackau’s, where the Princess spent almost all\nher evenings.  The Queen did not like these meetings, where Madame\nElisabeth might adopt views in opposition to the King’s intentions or her\nown.",
        "The Queen gave frequent audiences to M. de La Fayette.  One day, when he\nwas in her inner closet, his aides-de-camp, who waited for him, were\nwalking up and down the great room where the persons in attendance\nremained.  Some imprudent young women were thoughtless enough to say,\nwith the intention of being overheard by those officers, that it was very\nalarming to see the Queen alone with a rebel and a brigand.  I was\nannoyed at their indiscretion, and imposed silence on them.  One of them\npersisted in the appellation “brigand.”  I told her that M. de La Fayette\nwell deserved the name of rebel, but that the title of leader of a party\nwas given by history to every man commanding forty thousand men, a\ncapital, and forty leagues of country; that kings had frequently treated\nwith such leaders, and if it was convenient to the Queen to do the same,\nit remained for us only to be silent and respect her actions.  On the\nmorrow the Queen, with a serious air; but with the greatest kindness,\nasked what I had said respecting M. de La Fayette on the preceding day;\nadding that she had been assured I had enjoined her women silence,\nbecause they did not like him, and that I had taken his part.  I repeated\nwhat had passed to the Queen, word for word.  She condescended to tell me\nthat I had done perfectly right.",
        "Whenever any false reports respecting me were conveyed to her she was\nkind enough to inform me of them; and they had no effect on the\nconfidence with which she continued to honour me, and which I am happy to\nthink I have justified even at the risk of my life.",
        "Mesdames, the King’s aunts, set out from Bellevue in the beginning of the\nyear 1791.  Alexandre Berthier, afterwards Prince de Neufchatel, then a\ncolonel on the staff of the army, and commandant of the National Guard of\nVersailles, facilitated the departure of Mesdames.  The Jacobins of that\ntown procured his dismissal, and he ran the greatest risk, on account of\nhaving rendered this service to these Princesses.",
        "I went to take leave of Madame Victoire.  I little thought that I was\nthen seeing her for the last time.  She received me alone in her closet,\nand assured",
        "     [General Berthier justified the monarch’s confidence by a firm and\n     prudent line of conduct which entitled him to the highest military\n     honours, and to the esteem of the great warrior whose fortune,\n     dangers, and glory he afterwards shared.  This officer, full of\n     honour, and gifted with the highest courage, was shut into the\n     courtyard of Bellevue by his own troop, and ran great risk of being\n     murdered.  It was not until the 14th of March that he succeeded in\n     executing his instructions (\"Memoirs of Mesdames,” by Montigny,\n     vol. i.)]",
        "me that she hoped, as well as wished, soon to return to France; that the\nFrench would be much to be pitied if the excesses of the Revolution\nshould arrive at such a pitch as to force her to prolong her absence.\nI knew from the Queen that the departure of Mesdames was deemed\nnecessary, in order to leave the King free to act when he should be\ncompelled to go away with his family.  It being impossible that the\nconstitution of the clergy should be otherwise than in direct opposition\nto the religious principles of Mesdames, they thought their journey to\nRome would be attributed to piety alone.  It was, however, difficult to\ndeceive an Assembly which weighed the slightest actions of the royal\nfamily, and from that moment they were more than ever alive to what was\npassing at the Tuileries.",
        "Mesdames were desirous of taking Madame Elisabeth to Rome.  The free\nexercise of religion, the happiness of taking refuge with the head of the\nChurch, and the prospect of living in safety with her aunts, whom she\ntenderly loved, were sacrificed by that virtuous Princess to her\nattachment to the King.",
        "The oath required of priests by the civil constitution of the clergy\nintroduced into France a division which added to the dangers by which the\nKing was already surrounded.",
        "     [The priests were required to swear to the civil constitution of the\n     clergy of 1790, by which all the former bishoprics and parishes were\n     remodelled, and the priests and bishops elected by the people.  Most\n     refused, and under the name of ’pretres insermentes’ (as opposed to\n     the few who took the oath, ’pretres assermentes’) were bitterly\n     persecuted.  A simple promise to obey the constitution of the State\n     was substituted by Napoleon as soon as he came to power.]",
        "Mirabeau spent a whole night with the cure of St. Eustache, confessor of\nthe King and Queen, to persuade him to take the oath required by that\nconstitution.  Their Majesties chose another confessor, who remained\nunknown.",
        "A few months afterwards (2d April, 1791), the too celebrated Mirabeau,\nthe mercenary democrat and venal royalist, terminated his career.  The\nQueen regretted him, and was astonished at her own regret; but she had\nhoped that he who had possessed adroitness and weight enough to throw\neverything into confusion would have been able by the same means to\nrepair the mischief he had caused.  Much has been said respecting the\ncause of Mirabeau’s death.  M. Cabanis, his friend and physician, denied\nthat he was poisoned.  M. Vicq-d’Azyr assured the Queen that the ’proces-\nverbal’ drawn up on the state of the intestines would apply just as well\nto a case of death produced by violent remedies as to one produced by\npoison.  He said, also, that the report had been faithful; but that it\nwas prudent to conclude it by a declaration of natural death, since, in\nthe critical state in which France then was, if a suspicion of foul play\nwere admitted, a person innocent of any such crime might be sacrificed to\npublic vengeance.",
        "In the beginning of the spring of 1791, the King, tired of remaining at\nthe Tuileries, wished to return to St. Cloud.  His whole household had\nalready gone, and his dinner was prepared there.  He got into his\ncarriage at one; the guard mutinied, shut the gates, and declared they\nwould not let him pass.  This event certainly proceeded from some\nsuspicion of a plan to escape.  Two persons who drew near the King’s\ncarriage were very ill treated.  My father-in-law was violently laid hold\nof by the guards, who took his sword from him.  The King and his family\nwere obliged to alight and return to their apartments.",
        "They did not much regret this outrage in their hearts; they saw in it a\njustification, even in the eyes of the people, of their intention to\nleave Paris.",
        "So early as the month of March in the same year, the Queen began to busy\nherself in preparing for her departure.  I spent that month with her,\nand executed a great number of secret orders which she gave me respecting\nthe intended event.  It was with uneasiness that I saw her occupied with\ncares which seemed to me useless, and even dangerous, and I remarked to\nher that the Queen of France would find linen and gowns everywhere.\nMy observations were made in vain; she determined to have a complete\nwardrobe with her at Brussels, as well for her children as herself.\nI went out alone and almost disguised to purchase the articles necessary\nand have them made up.",
        "I ordered six chemises at the shop of one seamstress, six at that of\nanother, gowns, combing cloths, etc.  My sister had a complete set of\nclothes made for Madame, by the measure of her eldest daughter, and I\nordered clothes for the Dauphin from those of my son.  I filled a trunk\nwith these things, and addressed them, by the Queen’s orders, to one of\nher women, my aunt, Madame Cardon,–a widow living at Arras, by virtue of\nan unlimited leave of absence,–in order that she might be ready to start\nfor Brussels, or any other place, as soon as she should be directed to do\nso.  This lady had landed property in Austrian Flanders, and could at any\ntime quit Arras unobserved.",
        "The Queen was to take only her first woman in attendance with her from\nParis.  She apprised me that if I should not be on duty at the moment of\ndeparture, she would make arrangements for my joining her.  She\ndetermined also to take her travelling dressing-case.  She consulted me\non her idea of sending it off, under pretence of making a present of it\nto the Archduchess Christina, Gouvernante of the Netherlands.  I ventured\nto oppose this plan strongly, and observed that, amidst so many people\nwho watched her slightest actions, there would be found a sufficient\nnumber sharp-sighted enough to discover that it was only a pretext for\nsending away the property in question before her own departure;\nshe persisted in her intention, and all I could arrange was that the\ndressing-case should not be removed from her apartment, and that M. de\ncharge d’afaires from the Court of Vienna during the absence of the Comte\nde Mercy, should come and ask her, at her toilet, before all her people,\nto order one exactly like her own for Madame the Gouvernante of the\nNetherlands.  The Queen, therefore, commanded me before the charge\nd’affaires to order the article in question.  This occasioned only an\nexpense of five hundred louis, and appeared calculated to lull suspicion\ncompletely.",
        "About the middle of May, 1791, a month after the Queen had ordered me to\nbespeak the dressing-case, she asked me whether it would soon be\nfinished.  I sent for the ivory-turner who had it in hand.  He could not\ncomplete it for six weeks.  I informed the Queen of this, and she told me\nshe should not be able to wait for it, as she was to set out in the\ncourse of June.  She added that, as she had ordered her sister’s\ndressing-case in the presence of all her attendants, she had taken a\nsufficient precaution, especially by saying that her sister was out of\npatience at not receiving it, and that therefore her own must be emptied\nand cleaned, and taken to the charge d’affaires, who would send it off.\nI executed this order without any, appearance of mystery.  I desired the\nwardrobe woman to take out of the dressing-case all that it contained,\nbecause that intended for the Archduchess could not be finished for some\ntime; and to take great care to leave no remains of the perfumes which\nmight not suit that Princess.",
        "The woman in question executed her commission punctually; but, on the\nevening of that very day, the 15th of May, 1791, she informed M. Bailly,\nthe Mayor of Paris, that preparations were making at the Queen’s\nresidence for a departure; and that the dressing-case was already sent\noff, under pretence of its being presented to the Archduchess Christina.",
        "     [After the return from Varennes M. Bailly put this woman’s\n     deposition into the Queen’s hands.–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "It was necessary, likewise, to send off all the diamonds belonging to the\nQueen.  Her Majesty shut herself up with me in a closet in the entresol,\nlooking into the garden of the Tuileries, and we packed all the diamonds,\nrubies, and pearls she possessed in a small chest.  The cases containing\nthese ornaments, being altogether of considerable bulk, had been\ndeposited, ever since the 6th of October, 1789, with the valet de chambre\nwho had the care of the Queen’s jewels.  That faithful servant, himself\ndetecting the use that was to be made of the valuables, destroyed all the\nboxes, which were, as usual, covered with red morocco, marked with the\ncipher and arms of France.  It would have been impossible for him to hide\nthem from the eyes of the popular inquisitors during the domiciliary\nvisits in January, 1793, and the discovery might have formed a ground of\naccusation against the Queen.",
        "I had but a few articles to place in the box when the Queen was compelled\nto desist from packing it, being obliged to go down to cards, which began\nat seven precisely.  She therefore desired me to leave all the diamonds\nupon the sofa, persuaded that, as she took the key of her closet herself,\nand there was a sentinel under the window, no danger was to be\napprehended for that night, and she reckoned upon returning very early\nnext day to finish the work.",
        "The same woman who had given information of the sending away of the\ndressing-case was also deputed by the Queen to take care of her more\nprivate rooms.  No other servant was permitted to enter them; she renewed\nthe flowers, swept the carpets, etc.  The Queen received back the key,\nwhen the woman had finished putting them in order, from her own hands;\nbut, desirous of doing her duty well, and sometimes having the key in her\npossession for a few minutes only, she had probably on that account\nordered one without the Queen’s knowledge.  It is impossible not to\nbelieve this, since the despatch of the diamonds was the subject of a\nsecond accusation which the Queen heard of after the return from\nVarennes.  She made a formal declaration that her Majesty, with the\nassistance of Madame Campan, had packed up all her jewelry some time\nbefore the departure; that she was certain of it, as she had found the\ndiamonds, and the cotton which served to wrap them, scattered upon the\nsofa in the Queen’s closet in the ’entresol’; and most assuredly she\ncould only have seen these preparations in the interval between seven in\nthe evening and seven in the morning.  The Queen having met me next day\nat the time appointed, the box was handed over to Leonard, her Majesty’s\nhairdresser,–[This unfortunate man, after having emigrated for some\ntime, returned to France, and perished upon the scaffold.–NOTE BY\nEDITOR]–who left the country with the Duc de Choiseul.  The box\nremained a long time at Brussels, and at length got into the hands of\nMadame la Duchesse d’Angouleme, being delivered to her by the Emperor on\nher arrival at Vienna.",
        "In order not to leave out any of the Queen’s diamonds, I requested the\nfirst tirewoman to give me the body of the full dress, and all the\nassortment which served for the stomacher of the full dress on days of\nstate, articles which always remained at the wardrobe.",
        "The superintendent and the dame d’honneur being absent, the first\ntirewoman required me to sign a receipt, the terms of which she dictated,\nand which acquitted her of all responsibility for these diamonds.\nShe had the prudence to burn this document on the 10th of August, 1792.\n–[The date of the sack of the Tuileries and slaughter of the Swiss\nGuard]–The Queen having determined, upon the arrest at Varennes, not to\nhave her diamonds brought back to France, was often anxious about them\nduring the year which elapsed between that period and the 10th of August,\nand dreaded above all things that such a secret should be discovered.",
        "In consequence of a decree of the Assembly, which deprived the King of\nthe custody of the Crown diamonds, the Queen had at this time already\ngiven up those which she generally used.",
        "She preferred the twelve brilliants called Hazarins, from the name of the\nCardinal who had enriched the treasury with them, a few rose-cut\ndiamonds, and the Sanci.  She determined to deliver, with her own hands,\nthe box containing them to the commissioner nominated by the National\nAssembly to place them with the Crown diamonds.  After giving them to\nhim, she offered him a row of pearls of great beauty, saying to him that\nit had been brought into France by Anne of Austria; that it was\ninvaluable, on account of its rarity; that, having been appropriated by\nthat Princess to the use of the Queens and Dauphinesses, Louis XV.  had\nplaced it in her hands on her arrival in France; but that she considered\nit national property.  “That is an open question, Madame,” said the\ncommissary.  “Monsieur,” replied the Queen, “it is one for me to decide,\nand is now settled.”",
        "My father-in-law, who was dying of the grief he felt for the misfortunes\nof his master and mistress, strongly interested and occupied the thoughts\nof the Queen.  He had been saved from the fury of the populace in the\ncourtyard of the Tuileries.",
        "On the day on which the King was compelled by an insurrection to give up\na journey to St. Cloud, her Majesty looked upon this trusty servant as\ninevitably lost, if, on going away, she should leave him in the apartment\nhe occupied in the Tuileries.  Prompted by her apprehensions, she ordered\nM. Vicq-d’Azyr, her physician, to recommend him the waters of Mont d’Or\nin Auvergne, and to persuade him to set off at the latter end of May.\nAt the moment of my going away the Queen assured me that the grand\nproject would be executed between the 15th and the 20th of June; that as\nit was not my month to be on duty, Madame Thibaut would take the journey;\nbut that she had many directions to give me before I went.  She then\ndesired me to write to my aunt, Madame Cardon, who was by that time in\npossession of the clothes which I had ordered, that as soon as she should\nreceive a letter from M. Augur, the date of which should be accompanied\nwith a B, an L, or an M, she was to proceed with her property to\nBrussels, Luxembourg, or Montmedy.  She desired me to explain the meaning\nof these three letters clearly to my sister, and to leave them with her\nin writing, in order that at the moment of my going away she might be\nable to take my place in writing to Arras.",
        "The Queen had a more delicate commission for me; it was to select from\namong my acquaintance a prudent person of obscure rank, wholly devoted to\nthe interests of the Court, who would be willing to receive a portfolio\nwhich she was to give up only to me, or some one furnished with a note\nfrom the Queen.  She added that she would not travel with this portfolio,\nand that it was of the utmost importance that my opinion of the fidelity\nof the person to whom it was to be entrusted should be well founded.  I\nproposed to her Madame Vallayer Coster, a painter of the Academy, and an\namiable and worthy artist, whom I had known from my infancy.  She lived\nin the galleries of the Louvre.  The choice seemed a good one.  The Queen\nremembered that she had made her marriage possible by giving her a place\nin the financial offices, and added that gratitude ought sometimes to be\nreckoned on.  She then pointed out to me the valet belonging to her\ntoilet, whom I was to take with me, to show him the residence of Madame\nCoster, so that he might not mistake it when he should take the portfolio\nto her.  The day before her departure the Queen particularly recommended\nme to proceed to Lyons and the frontiers as soon as she should have\nstarted.  She advised me to take with me a confidential person, fit to\nremain with M. Campan when I should leave him, and assured me that she\nwould give orders to M. ––– to set off as soon as she should be known\nto be at the frontiers in order to protect me in going out.  She\ncondescended to add that, having a long journey to make in foreign\ncountries, she determined to give me three hundred louis.",
        "I bathed the Queen’s hands with tears at the moment of this sorrowful\nseparation; and, having money at my disposal, I declined accepting her\ngold.  I did not dread the road I had to travel in order to rejoin her;\nall my apprehension was that by treachery or miscalculation a scheme, the\nsafety of which was not sufficiently clear to me, should fail.  I could\nanswer for all those who belonged to the service immediately about the\nQueen’s person, and I was right; but her wardrobe woman gave me well-\nfounded reason for alarm.  I mentioned to the Queen many revolutionary\nremarks which this woman had made to me a few days before.  Her office\nwas directly under the control of the first femme de chambre, yet she had\nrefused to obey the directions I gave her, talking insolently to me about\n\"hierarchy overturned, equality among men,” of course more especially\namong persons holding offices at Court; and this jargon, at that time in\nthe mouths of all the partisans of the Revolution, was terminated by an\nobservation which frightened me.  “You know many important secrets,\nmadame,” said this woman to me, “and I have guessed quite as many.  I am\nnot a fool; I see all that is going forward here in consequence of the\nbad advice given to the King and Queen; I could frustrate it all if I\nchose.”  This argument, in which I had been promptly silenced, left me\npale and trembling.  Unfortunately, as I began my narrative to the Queen\nwith particulars of this woman’s refusal to obey me,–and sovereigns are\nall their lives importuned with complaints upon the rights of places,–\nshe believed that my own dissatisfaction had much to do with the step\nI was taking; and she did not sufficiently fear the woman.  Her office,\nalthough a very inferior one, brought her in nearly fifteen thousand\nfrancs a year.  Still young, tolerably handsome, with comfortable\napartments in the entresols of the Tuileries, she saw a great deal of\ncompany, and in the evening had assemblies, consisting of deputies of the\nrevolutionary party.  M. de Gouvion, major-general of the National Guard,\npassed almost every day with her; and it is to be presumed that she had\nlong worked for the party in opposition to the Court.  The Queen asked\nher for the key of a door which led to the principal vestibule of the\nTuileries, telling her she wished to have a similar one, that she might\nnot be under the necessity of going out through the pavilion of Flora.\nM. de Gouvion and M. de La Fayette would, of course, be apprised of this\ncircumstance, and well-informed persons have assured me that on the very\nnight of the Queen’s departure this wretched woman had a spy with her,\nwho saw the royal family set off.",
        "As soon as I had executed all the Queen’s orders, on the 30th of May,\n1791, I set out for Auvergne, and was settled in the gloomy narrow valley\nof Mont d’Or, when, about four in the afternoon of the 25th of June,\nI heard the beat of a drum to call the inhabitants of the hamlet\ntogether.  When it had ceased I heard a hairdresser from Bresse proclaim\nin the provincial dialect of Auvergne: “The King and Queen were taking\nflight in order to ruin France, but I come to tell you that they are\nstopped, and are well guarded by a hundred thousand men under arms.”  I\nstill ventured to hope that he was repeating only a false report, but he\nwent on: “The Queen,” with her well-known haughtiness, lifted up the veil\nwhich covered her face, and said to the citizens who were upbraiding the\nKing, “Well, since you recognise your sovereign, respect him.”  Upon\nhearing these expressions, which the Jacobin club of Clermont could not\nhave invented, I exclaimed, “The news is true!”",
        "I immediately learnt that, a courier being come from Paris to Clermont,\nthe ’procureur’ of the commune had sent off messengers to the chief\nplaces of the canton; these again sent couriers to the districts, and the\ndistricts in like manner informed the villages and hamlets which they\ncontained.  It was through this ramification, arising from the\nestablishment of clubs, that the afflicting intelligence of the\nmisfortune of my sovereigns reached me in the wildest part of France,\nand in the midst of the snows by which we were environed.",
        "On the 28th I received a note written in a hand which I recognised as\nthat of M. Diet,–[This officer was slain in the Queen’s chamber on the\n10th of August]–usher of the Queen’s chamber, but dictated by her\nMajesty.  It contained these words: “I am this moment arrived; I have\njust got into my bath; I and my family exist, that is all.  I have\nsuffered much.  Do not return to Paris until I desire you.  Take good\ncare of my poor Campan, soothe his sorrow.  Look for happier times.\"\nThis note was for greater safety addressed to my father-in-law’s valet-de\n-chambre.  What were my feelings on perceiving that after the most\ndistressing crisis we were among the first objects of the kindness of\nthat unfortunate Princess!",
        "M. Campan having been unable to benefit by the waters of Mont d’Or, and\nthe first popular effervescence having subsided, I thought I might return\nto Clermont.  The committee of surveillance, or that of general safety,\nhad resolved to arrest me there; but the Abbe Louis, formerly a\nparliamentary counsellor, and then a member of the Constituent Assembly,\nwas kind enough to affirm that I was in Auvergne solely for the purpose\nof attending my father-in-law, who was extremely ill.  The precautions\nrelative to my absence from Paris were limited to placing us under the\nsurveillance of the ’procureur’ of the commune, who was at the same time\npresident of the Jacobin club; but he was also a physician of repute, and\nwithout having any doubt that he had received secret orders relative to\nme, I thought it would favour the chances of our safety if I selected him\nto attend my patient.  I paid him according to the rate given to the best\nParis physicians, and I requested him to visit us every morning and every\nevening.  I took the precaution to subscribe to no other newspaper than\nthe Moniteur.  Doctor Monestier (for that was the physician’s name)\nfrequently took upon himself to read it to us.  Whenever he thought\nproper to speak of the King and Queen in the insulting and brutal terms\nat that time unfortunately adopted throughout France, I used to stop him\nand say, coolly, “Monsieur, you are here in company with the servants of\nLouis XVI.  and Marie Antoinette.  Whatever may be the wrongs with which\nthe nation believes it has to reproach them, our principles forbid our\nlosing sight of the respect due to them from us.”  Notwithstanding that\nhe was an inveterate patriot, he felt the force of this remark, and even\nprocured the revocation of a second order for our arrest, becoming\nresponsible for us to the committee of the Assembly, and to the Jacobin\nsociety.",
        "The two chief women about the Dauphin, who had accompanied the Queen to\nVarennes, Diet, her usher, and Camot, her garcon de toilette,–the women\non account of the journey, and the men in consequence of the denunciation\nof the woman belonging to the wardrobe,–were sent to the prisons of the\nAbbaye.  After my departure the garcon de toilette whom I had taken to\nMadame Vallayer Coster’s was sent there with the portfolio she had agreed\nto receive.  This commission could not escape the detestable spy upon the\nQueen.  She gave information that a portfolio had been carried out on the\nevening of the departure, adding that the King had placed it upon the\nQueen’s easy-chair, that the garcon de toilette wrapped it up in a napkin\nand took it under his arm, and that she did not know where he had carried\nit.  The man, who was remarkable for his fidelity, underwent three\nexaminations without making the slightest disclosure.  M. Diet, a man of\ngood family, a servant on whom the Queen placed particular reliance,\nlikewise experienced the severest treatment.  At length, after a lapse of\nthree weeks, the Queen succeeded in obtaining the release of her\nservants.",
        "The Queen, about the 15th of August, had me informed by letter that I\nmight come back to Paris without being under any apprehension of arrest\nthere, and that she greatly desired my return.  I brought my father-in-\nlaw back in a dying state, and on the day preceding that of the\nacceptation of the constitutional act, I informed the Queen that he was\nno more.  “The loss of Lassonne and Campan,” said she, as she applied her\nhandkerchief to her streaming eyes, “has taught me how valuable such\nsubjects are to their masters.  I shall never find their equals.”",
        "I resumed my functions about the Queen on the 1st of September, 1791.\nShe was unable then to converse with me on all the lamentable events\nwhich had occurred since the time of my leaving her, having on guard near\nher an officer whom she dreaded more than all the others.  She merely\ntold me that I should have some secret services to perform for her, and\nthat she would not create uneasiness by long conversations with me, my\nreturn being a subject of suspicion.  But next day the Queen, well\nknowing the discretion of the officer who was to be on guard that night,\nhad my bed placed very near hers, and having obtained the favour of\nhaving the door shut, when I was in bed she began the narrative of the\njourney, and the unfortunate arrest at Varennes.  I asked her permission\nto put on my gown, and kneeling by her bedside I remained until three\no’clock in the morning, listening with the liveliest and most sorrowful\ninterest to the account I am about to repeat, and of which I have seen\nvarious details, of tolerable exactness, in papers of the time.",
        "The King entrusted Count Fersen with all the preparations for departure.\nThe carriage was ordered by him; the passport, in the name of Madame de\nKorf, was procured through his connection with that lady, who was a\nforeigner.  And lastly, he himself drove the royal family, as their\ncoachman, as far as Bondy, where the travellers got into their berlin.\nMadame Brunier and Madame Neuville, the first women of Madame and the\nDauphin, there joined the principal carriage.  They were in a cabriolet.\nMonsieur and Madame set out from the Luxembourg and took another road.\nThey as well as the King were recognised by the master of the last post\nin France, but this man, devoting himself to the fortunes of the Prince,\nleft the French territory, and drove them himself as postilion.  Madame\nThibaut, the Queen’s first woman, reached Brussels without the slightest\ndifficulty.  Madame Cardon, from Arras, met with no hindrance; and\nLeonard, the Queen’s hairdresser, passed through Varennes a few hours\nbefore the royal family.  Fate had reserved all its obstacles for the\nunfortunate monarch.",
        "Nothing worthy of notice occurred in the beginning of the journey.  The\ntravellers were detained a short time, about twelve leagues from Paris,\nby some repairs which the carriage required.  The King chose to walk up\none of the hills, and these two circumstances caused a delay of three\nhours, precisely at the time when it was intended that the berlin should\nhave been met, just before reaching Varennes, by the detachment commanded\nby M. de Goguelat.  This detachment was punctually stationed upon the\nspot fixed on, with orders to wait there for the arrival of certain\ntreasure, which it was to escort; but the peasantry of the neighbourhood,\nalarmed at the sight of this body of troops, came armed with staves, and\nasked several questions, which manifested their anxiety.  M. de Goguelat,\nfearful of causing a riot, and not finding the carriage arrive as he\nexpected, divided his men into two companies, and unfortunately made them\nleave the highway in order to return to Varennes by two cross roads.\nThe King looked out of the carriage at Ste. Menehould, and asked several\nquestions concerning the road.  Drouet, the post-master, struck by the\nresemblance of Louis to the impression of his head upon the assignats,\ndrew near the carriage, felt convinced that he recognised the Queen also,\nand that the remainder of the travellers consisted of the royal family\nand their suite, mounted his horse, reached Varennes by cross roads\nbefore the royal fugitives, and gave the alarm.–[Varennes lies between\nVerdun and Montmedy, and not far from the French frontier.]",
        "The Queen began to feel all the agonies of terror; they were augmented by\nthe voice of a person unknown, who, passing close to the carriage in full\ngallop, cried out, bending towards the window without slackening his\nspeed, “You are recognised!”  They arrived with beating hearts at the\ngates of Varennes without meeting one of the horsemen by whom they were\nto have been escorted into the place.  They were ignorant where to find\ntheir relays, and some minutes were lost in waiting, to no purpose.  The\ncabriolet had preceded them, and the two ladies in attendance found the\nbridge already blocked up with old carts and lumber.  The town guards\nwere all under arms.  The King at last entered Varennes.  M. de Goguelat\nhad arrived there with his detachment.  He came up to the King and asked\nhim if he chose to effect a passage by force!  What an unlucky question\nto put to Louis XVI., who from the very beginning of the Revolution had\nshown in every crisis the fear he entertained of giving the least order\nwhich might cause an effusion of blood!  “Would it be a brisk action?\"\nsaid the King.  “It is impossible that it should be otherwise, Sire,\"\nreplied the aide-decamp.  Louis XVI. was unwilling to expose his family.\nThey therefore went to the house of a grocer, Mayor of Varennes.  The\nKing began to speak, and gave a summary of his intentions in departing,\nanalogous to the declaration he had made at Paris.  He spoke with warmth\nand affability, and endeavoured to demonstrate to the people around him\nthat he had only put himself, by the step he had taken, into a fit\nsituation to treat with the Assembly, and to sanction with freedom the\nconstitution which he would maintain, though many of its articles were\nincompatible with the dignity of the throne, and the force by which it\nwas necessary that the sovereign should be surrounded.  Nothing could be\nmore affecting, added the Queen, than this moment, in which the King felt\nbound to communicate to the very humblest class of his subjects his\nprinciples, his wishes for the happiness of his people, and the motives\nwhich had determined him to depart.",
        "Whilst the King was speaking to this mayor, whose name was Sauce, the\nQueen, seated at the farther end of the shop, among parcels of soap and\ncandles, endeavoured to make Madame Sauce understand that if she would\nprevail upon her husband to make use of his municipal authority to cover\nthe flight of the King and his family, she would have the glory of having\ncontributed to restore tranquillity to France.  This woman was moved;\nshe could not, without streaming eyes, see herself thus solicited by her\nQueen; but she could not be got to say anything more than, “Bon Dieu,\nMadame, it would be the destruction of M. Sauce; I love my King, but I\nlove my husband too, you must know, and he would be answerable, you see.\"\nWhilst this strange scene was passing in the shop, the people, hearing\nthat the King was arrested, kept pouring in from all parts.  M. de\nGoguelat, making a last effort, demanded of the dragoons whether they\nwould protect the departure of the King; they replied only by murmurs,\ndropping the points of their swords.  Some person unknown fired a pistol\nat M. de Goguelat; he was slightly wounded by the ball.  M. Romeuf, aide-\nde-camp to M. de La Fayette, arrived at that moment.  He had been chosen,\nafter the 6th of October, 1789, by the commander of the Parisian guard to\nbe in constant attendance about the Queen.  She reproached him bitterly\nwith the object of his mission.  “If you wish to make your name\nremarkable, monsieur,” said the Queen to him, “you have chosen strange\nand odious means, which will produce the most fatal consequences.”  This\nofficer wished to hasten their departure.  The Queen, still cherishing\nthe hope of seeing M. de Bouille arrive with a sufficient force to\nextricate the King from his critical situation, prolonged her stay at\nVarennes by every means in her power.",
        "The Dauphin’s first woman pretended to be taken ill with a violent colic,\nand threw herself upon a bed, in the hope of aiding the designs of her\nsuperiors; she went and implored for assistance.  The Queen understood\nher perfectly well, and refused to leave one who had devoted herself to\nfollow them in such a state of suffering.  But no delay in departing was\nallowed.  The three Body Guards (Valory, Du Moustier, and Malden) were\ngagged and fastened upon the seat of the carriage.  A horde of National\nGuards, animated with fury and the barbarous joy with which their fatal\ntriumph inspired them, surrounded the carriage of the royal family.",
        "The three commissioners sent by the Assembly to meet the King, MM. de\nLatour-Maubourg, Barnave, and Potion, joined them in the environs of\nEpernay.  The two last mentioned got into the King’s carriage.  The Queen\nastonished me by the favourable opinion she had formed of Barnave.\nWhen I quitted Paris a great many persons spoke of him only with horror.\nShe told me he was much altered, that he was full of talent and noble\nfeeling.  “A feeling of pride which I cannot much blame in a young man\nbelonging to the Tiers Etat,” she said, “made him applaud everything\nwhich smoothed the road to rank and fame for that class in which he was\nborn.  And if we get the power in our own hands again, Barnave’s pardon\nis already written on our hearts.”  The Queen added, that she had not the\nsame feeling towards those nobles who had joined the revolutionary party,\nwho had always received marks of favour, often to the injury of those\nbeneath them in rank, and who, born to be the safeguard of the monarchy,\ncould never be pardoned for having deserted it.  She then told me that\nBarnave’s conduct upon the road was perfectly correct, while Potion’s\nrepublican rudeness was disgusting; that the latter ate and drank in the\nKing’s berlin in a slovenly manner, throwing the bones of the fowls out\nthrough the window at the risk of sending them even into the King’s face;\nlifting up his glass, when Madame Elisabeth poured him out wine, to show\nher that there was enough, without saying a word; that this offensive\nbehaviour must have been intentional, because the man was not without\neducation; and that Barnave was hurt at it.  On being pressed by the\nQueen to take something, “Madame,” replied Barnave, “on so solemn an\noccasion the deputies of the National Assembly ought to occupy your\nMajesties solely about their mission, and by no means about their wants.\"\nIn short, his respectful delicacy, his considerate attentions, and all\nthat he said, gained the esteem not only of the Queen, but of Madame\nElisabeth also.",
        "The King began to talk to Petion about the situation of France, and the\nmotives of his conduct, which were founded upon the necessity of giving\nto the executive power a strength necessary for its action, for the good\neven of the constitutional act, since France could not be a republic.\n\"Not yet, ’tis true,” replied Petion, “because the French are not ripe\nenough for that.”  This audacious and cruel answer silenced the King, who\nsaid no more until his arrival at Paris.  Potion held the little Dauphin\nupon his knees, and amused himself with curling the beautiful light hair\nof the interesting child round his fingers; and, as he spoke with much\ngesticulation, he pulled his locks hard enough to make the Dauphin cry\nout.  “Give me my son,” said the Queen to him; “he is accustomed to\ntenderness and delicacy, which render him little fit for such\nfamiliarity.”",
        "The Chevalier de Dampierre was killed near the King’s carriage upon\nleaving Varennes.  A poor village cure, some leagues from the place where\nthe crime was committed, was imprudent enough to draw near to speak to\nthe King; the cannibals who surrounded the carriage rushed upon him.\n\"Tigers,” exclaimed Barnave, “have you ceased to be Frenchmen?  Nation of\nbrave men, are you become a set of assassins?”  These words alone saved\nthe cure, who was already upon the ground, from certain death.  Barnave,\nas he spoke to them, threw himself almost out of the coach window, and\nMadame Elisabeth, affected by this noble burst of feeling, held him by\nthe skirt of his coat.  The Queen, while speaking of this event, said\nthat on the most momentous occasions whimsical contrasts always struck\nher, and that even at such a moment the pious Elisabeth holding Barnave\nby the flap of his coat was a ludicrous sight.",
        "The deputy was astonished in another way.  Madame Elisabeth’s comments\nupon the state of France, her mild and persuasive eloquence, and the,\nease and simplicity with which she talked to him, yet without sacrificing\nher dignity in the slightest degree, appeared to him unique, and his\nheart, which was doubtless inclined to right principles though he had\nfollowed the wrong path, was overcome by admiration.  The conduct of the\ntwo deputies convinced the Queen of the total separation between the\nrepublican and constitutional parties.  At the inns where she alighted\nshe had some private conversation with Barnave.  The latter said a great\ndeal about the errors committed by the royalists during the Revolution,\nadding that he had found the interest of the Court so feebly and so badly\ndefended that he had been frequently tempted to go and offer it, in\nhimself, an aspiring champion, who knew the spirit of the age and nation.\nThe Queen asked him what was the weapon he would have recommended her to\nuse.",
        "“Popularity, Madame.”",
        "“And how could I use that,” replied her Majesty, “of which I have been\ndeprived?”",
        "“Ah!  Madame, it was much more easy for you to regain it, than for me to\nacquire it.”",
        "The Queen mainly attributed the arrest at Varennes to M. de Goguelat; she\nsaid he calculated the time that would be spent in the journey\nerroneously.  He performed that from Montmedy to Paris before taking the\nKing’s last orders, alone in a post-chaise, and he founded all his\ncalculations upon the time he spent thus.  The trial has been made since,\nand it was found that a light carriage without any courier was nearly\nthree hours less in running the distance than a heavy carriage preceded\nby a courier.",
        "The Queen also blamed him for having quitted the high-road at Pont-de-\nSommevelle, where the carriage was to meet the forty hussars commanded by\nhim.  She thought that he ought to have dispersed the very small number\nof people at Varennes, and not have asked the hussars whether they were\nfor the King or the nation; that, particularly, he ought to have avoided\ntaking the King’s orders, as he was previously aware of the reply\nM. d’Inisdal had received when it was proposed to carry off the King.",
        "After all that the Queen had said to me respecting the mistakes made by\nM. de Goguelat, I thought him of course disgraced.  What was my surprise\nwhen, having been set at liberty after the amnesty which followed the\nacceptance of the constitution, he presented himself to the Queen, and\nwas received with the greatest kindness!  She said he had done what he\ncould, and that his zeal ought to form an excuse for all the rest.",
        "     [Full details of the preparations for the flight to Varennes will be\n     found in “Le Comte de Fersen et La Cour de France,” Paris, Didot et\n     Cie, 1878 (a review of which was given in the Quarterly Review for\n     July, 1880), and in the “Memoirs of the Marquis de Bouille”, London,\n     Cadell and Davis, 1797; Count Fersen being the person who planned\n     the actual escape, and De Bouille being in command of the army which\n     was to receive the King.  The plan was excellent, and would\n     certainly have succeeded, if it had not been for the royal family\n     themselves.  Marie Antoinette, it will have been seen by Madame\n     Campan’s account, nearly wrecked the plan from inability to do\n     without a large dressing or travelling case.  The King did a more\n     fatal thing.  De Bouille had pointed out the necessity for having in\n     the King’s carriage an officer knowing the route, and able to show\n     himself to give all directions, and a proper person had been\n     provided.  The King, however, objected, as “he could not have the\n     Marquis d’Agoult in the same carriage with himself; the governess of\n     the royal children, who was to accompany them, having refused to\n     abandon her privilege of constantly remaining with her charge.”  See\n     “De Bouille,” pp. 307 and 334.  Thus, when Louis was recognised at\n     the window of the carriage by Drouet, he was lost by the very danger\n     that had been foreseen, and this wretched piece of etiquette led to\n     his death.]",
        "When the royal family was brought back from Varennes to the Tuileries,\nthe Queen’s attendants found the greatest difficulty in making their way\nto her apartments; everything had been arranged so that the wardrobe\nwoman, who had acted as spy, should have the service; and she was to be\nassisted in it only by her sister and her sister’s daughter.",
        "M. de Gouvion, M. de La Fayette’s aide-de-camp, had this woman’s portrait\nplaced at the foot of the staircase which led to the Queen’s apartments,\nin order that the sentinel should not permit any other women to make\ntheir way in.  As soon as the Queen was informed of this contemptible\nprecaution, she told the King of it, who sent to ascertain the fact.\nHis Majesty then called for M. de La Fayette, claimed freedom in his\nhousehold, and particularly in that of the Queen, and ordered him to send\na woman in, whom no one but himself could confide out of the palace.\nM. de La Fayette was obliged to comply.",
        "On the day when the return of the royal family was expected, there were\nno carriages in motion in the streets of Paris.  Five or six of the\nQueen’s women, after being refused admittance at all the other gates,\nwent with one of my sisters to that of the Feuillans, insisting that the\nsentinel should admit them.  The poissardes attacked them for their\nboldness in resisting the order excluding them.  One of them seized my\nsister by the arm, calling her the slave of the Austrian.  “Hear me,\"\nsaid my sister to her, “I have been attached to the Queen ever since I\nwas fifteen years of age; she gave me my marriage portion; I served her\nwhen she was powerful and happy.  She is now unfortunate.  Ought I to\nabandon her?\"–\"She is right,” cried the poissardes; “she ought not to\nabandon her mistress; let us make an entry for them.”  They instantly\nsurrounded the sentinel, forced the passage, and introduced the Queen’s\nwomen, accompanying them to the terrace of the Feuillans.  One of these\nfuries, whom the slightest impulse would have driven to tear my sister to\npieces, taking her under her protection, gave her advice by which she\nmight reach the palace in safety.  “But of all things, my dear friend,\"\nsaid she to her, “pull off that green ribbon sash; it is the color of\nthat D’Artois, whom we will never forgive.”",
        "The measures adopted for guarding the King were rigorous with respect to\nthe entrance into the palace, and insulting as to his private apartments.\nThe commandants of battalion, stationed in the salon called the grand\ncabinet, and which led to the Queen’s bedchamber, were ordered to keep\nthe door of it always open, in order that they might have their eyes\nupon the royal family.  The King shut this door one day; the officer of\nthe guard opened it, and told him such were his orders, and that he would\nalways open it; so that his Majesty in shutting it gave himself useless\ntrouble.  It remained open even during the night, when the Queen was in\nbed; and the officer placed himself in an armchair between the two doors,\nwith his head turned towards her Majesty.  They only obtained permission\nto have the inner door shut when the Queen was rising.  The Queen had the\nbed of her first femme de chambre placed very near her own; this bed,\nwhich ran on casters, and was furnished with curtains, hid her from the\nofficer’s sight.",
        "Madame de Jarjaye, my companion, who continued her functions during the\nwhole period of my absence, told me that one night the commandant of\nbattalion, who slept between the two doors, seeing that she was sleeping\nsoundly, and that the Queen was awake, quitted his post and went close to\nher Majesty, to advise her as to the line of conduct she should pursue.\nAlthough she had the kindness to desire him to speak lower in order that\nhe might not disturb Madame de Jarjaye’s rest, the latter awoke, and\nnearly died with fright at seeing a man in the uniform of the Parisian\nguard so near the Queen’s bed.  Her Majesty comforted her, and told her\nnot to rise; that the person she saw was a good Frenchman, who was\ndeceived respecting the intentions and situation of his sovereign and\nherself, but whose conversation showed sincere attachment to the King.",
        "There was a sentinel in the corridor which runs behind the apartments in\nquestion, where there is a staircase, which was at that time an inner\none, and enabled the King and Queen to communicate freely.  This post,\nwhich was very onerous, because it was to be kept four and twenty hours,\nwas often claimed by Saint Prig, an actor belonging to the Theatre\nFrancais.  He took it upon himself sometimes to contrive brief interviews\nbetween the King and Queen in this corridor.  He left them at a distance,\nand gave them warning if he heard the slightest noise.  M. Collot,\ncommandant of battalion of the National Guard, who was charged with the\nmilitary duty of the Queen’s household, in like manner softened down,\nso far as he could with prudence, all, the revolting orders he received;\nfor instance, one to follow the Queen to the very door of her wardrobe\nwas never executed.  An officer of the Parisian guard dared to speak\ninsolently of the Queen in her own apartment.  M. Collot wished to make a\ncomplaint to M. de La Fayette against him, and have him dismissed.  The\nQueen opposed it, and condescended to say a few words of explanation and\nkindness to the man; he instantly became one of her most devoted\npartisans.",
        "The first time I saw her Majesty after the unfortunate catastrophe of the\nVarennes journey, I found her getting out of bed; her features were not\nvery much altered; but after the first kind words she uttered to me she\ntook off her cap and desired me to observe the effect which grief had\nproduced upon her hair.  It had become, in one single night, as white as\nthat of a woman of seventy.  Her Majesty showed me a ring she had just\nhad mounted for the Princesse de Lamballe; it contained a lock of her\nwhitened hair, with the inscription, “Blanched by sorrow.”  At the period\nof the acceptance of the constitution the Princess wished to return to\nFrance.  The Queen, who had no expectation that tranquillity would be\nrestored, opposed this; but the attachment of Madame de Lamballe to the\nroyal family impelled her to come and seek death.",
        "When I returned to Paris most of the harsh precautions were abandoned;\nthe doors were not kept open; greater respect was paid to the sovereign;\nit was known that the constitution soon to be completed would be\naccepted, and a better order of things was hoped for.",
        "On my arrival at Paris on the 25th of August I found the state of feeling\nthere much more temperate than I had dared to hope.  The conversation\ngenerally ran upon the acceptance of the constitution, and the fetes\nwhich would be given in consequence.  The struggle between the Jacobins\nand the constitutionals on the 17th of July, 1791, nevertheless had\nthrown the Queen into great terror for some moments; and the firing of\nthe cannon from the Champ de Mars upon a party which called for a trial\nof the King, and the leaders of which were in the very bosom of the\nAssembly, left the most gloomy impressions upon her mind.",
        "The constitutionals, the Queen’s connection with whom was not slackened\nby the intervention of the three members already mentioned, had\nfaithfully served the royal family during their detention.",
        "“We still hold the wire by which this popular mass is moved,” said\nBarnave to M. de J––- one day, at the same time showing him a large\nvolume, in which the names of all those who were influenced with the\npower of gold alone were registered.  It was at that time proposed to\nhire a considerable number of persons in order to secure loud\nacclamations when the King and his family should make their appearance at\nthe play upon the acceptance of the constitution.  That day, which\nafforded a glimmering hope of tranquillity, was the 14th of September;\nthe fetes were brilliant; but already fresh anxieties forbade the royal\nfamily to encourage much hope.",
        "The Legislative Assembly, which had just succeeded the Constituent\nAssembly (October, 1791), founded its conduct upon the wildest republican\nprinciples; created from the midst of popular assemblies, it was wholly\ninspired by the spirit which animated them.  The constitution, as I have\nsaid, was presented to the King on the 3d of September, 1791.  The\nministers, with the exception of M. de Montmorin, insisted upon the\nnecessity of accepting the constitutional act in its entirety.  The\nPrince de Kaunitz–[Minister of Austria]– was of the same opinion.\nMalouet wished the King to express himself candidly respecting any errors\nor dangers that he might observe in the constitution.  But Duport and\nBarnave, alarmed at the spirit prevailing in the Jacobin Club,",
        "     [The extreme revolutionary party, so called from the club,\n     originally “Breton,” then “Amis de la Constitution,” sitting at the\n     convent of the Dominicans (called in France Jacobins) of the Rue\n     Saint Honore.]",
        "and even in the Assembly, where Robespierre had already denounced them as\ntraitors to the country, and dreading still greater evils, added their\nopinions to those of the majority of the ministers and M. de Kaunitz;\nthose who really desired that the constitution should be maintained\nadvised that it should not be accepted thus literally.  The King seemed\ninclined to this advice; and this is one of the strongest proofs of his\nsincerity.",
        "Alexandre Lameth, Duport, and Barnave, still relying on the resources of\ntheir party, hoped to have credit for directing the King through the\ninfluence they believed they had acquired over the mind of the Queen.\nThey also consulted people of acknowledged talent, but belonging to no\ncouncil nor to any assembly.  Among these was M. Dubucq, formerly\nintendant of the marine and of the colonies.  He answered laconically in\none phrase: “Prevent disorder from organising itself.”",
        "The letter written by the King to the Assembly, claiming to accept the\nconstitution in the very place where it had been created, and where he\nannounced he would be on the 14th September at mid-day, was received with\ntransport, and the reading was repeatedly interrupted by plaudits.  The\nsitting terminated amidst the greatest enthusiasm, and M. de La Fayette\nobtained the release of all those who were detained on account of the\nKing’s journey [to Varennes], the abandonment of all proceedings relative\nto the events of the Revolution, and the discontinuance of the use of\npassports and of temporary restraints upon free travelling, as well in\nthe interior as without.  The whole was conceded by acclamation.  Sixty\nmembers were deputed to go to the King and express to him fully the\nsatisfaction his Majesty’s letter had given.  The Keeper of the Seals\nquitted the chamber, in the midst of applause, to precede the deputation\nto the King.",
        "The King answered the speech addressed to him, and concluded by saying to\nthe Assembly that a decree of that morning, which had abolished the order\nof the Holy Ghost, had left him and his son alone permission to be\ndecorated with it; but that an order having no value in his eyes, save\nfor the power of conferring it, he would not use it.",
        "The Queen, her son, and Madame, were at the door of the chamber into\nwhich the deputation was admitted.  The King said to the deputies, “You\nsee there my wife and children, who participate in my sentiments;” and\nthe Queen herself confirmed the King’s assurance.  These apparent marks\nof confidence were very inconsistent with the agitated state of her mind.\n\"These people want no sovereigns,” said she.  “We shall fall before their\ntreacherous though well-planned tactics; they are demolishing the\nmonarchy stone by stone.”",
        "Next day the particulars of the reception of the deputies by the King\nwere reported to the Assembly, and excited warm approbation.  But the\nPresident having put the question whether the Assembly ought not to\nremain seated while the King took the oath “Certainly,” was repeated by\nmany voices; “and the King, standing, uncovered.”  M. Malouet observed\nthat there was no occasion on which the nation, assembled in the presence\nof the King, did not acknowledge him as its head; that the omission to\ntreat the head of the State with the respect due to him would be an\noffence to the nation, as well as to the monarch.  He moved that the King\nshould take the oath standing, and that the Assembly should also stand\nwhile he was doing so.  M. Malouet’s observations would have carried the\ndecree, but a deputy from Brittany exclaimed, with a shrill voice, that\nhe had an amendment to propose which would render all unanimous.  “Let us\ndecree,” said he, “that M. Malouet, and whoever else shall so please, may\nhave leave to receive the King upon their knees; but let us stick to the\ndecree.”",
        "The King repaired to the chamber at mid-day.  His speech was followed by\nplaudits which lasted several minutes.  After the signing of the\nconstitutional act all sat down.  The President rose to deliver his\nspeech; but after he had begun, perceiving that the King did not rise to\nhear him, he sat down again.  His speech made a powerful impression; the\nsentence with which it concluded excited fresh acclamations, cries of\n\"Bravo!”  and “Vive le Roi!\"–\"Sire, “said he, “how important in our\neyes, and how dear to our hearts–how sublime a feature in our history–\nmust be the epoch of that regeneration which gives citizens to France,\nand a country to Frenchmen,–to you, as a king, a new title of greatness\nand glory, and, as a man, a source of new enjoyment.”  The whole Assembly\naccompanied the King on his return, amidst the people’s cries of\nhappiness, military music, and salvoes of artillery.",
        "At length I hoped to see a return of that tranquillity which had so long\nvanished from the countenances of my august master and mistress.  Their\nsuite left them in the salon; the Queen hastily saluted the ladies, and\nreturned much affected; the King followed her, and, throwing himself into\nan armchair, put his handkerchief to his eyes.  “Ah! Madame,” cried he,\nhis voice choked by tears, “why were you present at this sitting?  to\nwitness–” these words were interrupted by sobs.  The Queen threw herself\nupon her knees before him, and pressed him in her arms.  I remained with\nthem, not from any blamable curiosity, but from a stupefaction which\nrendered me incapable of determining what I ought to do.  The Queen said\nto me, “Oh! go, go!” with an accent which expressed, “Do not remain to\nsee the dejection and despair of your sovereign!”  I withdrew, struck\nwith the contrast between the shouts of joy without the palace and the\nprofound grief which oppressed the sovereigns within.  Half an hour\nafterwards the Queen sent for me.  She desired to see M. de Goguelat, to\nannounce to him his departure on that very night for Vienna.  The renewed\nattacks upon the dignity of the throne which had been made during the\nsitting; the spirit of an Assembly worse than the former; the monarch put\nupon a level with the President, without any deference to the throne,–\nall this proclaimed but too loudly that the sovereignty itself was aimed\nat.  The Queen no longer saw any ground for hope from the Provinces.\nThe King wrote to the Emperor; she told me that she would herself,\nat midnight, bring the letter which M. de Goguelat was to bear to the\nEmperor, to my room.",
        "During all the remainder of the day the Chateau and the Tuileries were\ncrowded; the illuminations were magnificent.  The King and Queen were\nrequested to take an airing in their carriage in the Champs-Elysees,\nescorted by the aides-decamp, and leaders of the Parisian army, the\nConstitutional Guard not being at the time organised.  Many shouts of\n\"Vive le Roi!”  were heard; but as often as they ceased, one of the mob,\nwho never quitted the door of the King’s carriage for a single instant,\nexclaimed with a stentorian voice, “No, don’t believe them!  Vive la\nNation!”  This ill-omened cry struck terror into the Queen.",
        "A few days afterwards M. de Montmorin sent to say he wanted to speak to\nme; that he would come to me, if he were not apprehensive his doing so\nwould attract observation; and that he thought it would appear less\nconspicuous if he should see me in the Queen’s great closet at a time\nwhich he specified, and when nobody would be there.  I went.  After\nhaving made some polite observations upon the services I had already\nperformed, and those I might yet perform, for my master and mistress, he\nspoke to me of the King’s imminent danger, of the plots which were\nhatching, and of the lamentable composition of the Legislative Assembly;\nand he particularly dwelt upon the necessity of appearing, by prudent\nremarks, determined as much as possible to abide by the act the King had\njust recognised.  I told him that could not be done without committing\nourselves in the eyes of the royalist party, with which moderation was a\ncrime; that it was painful to hear ourselves taxed with being\nconstitutionalists, at the same time that it was our opinion that the\nonly constitution which was consistent with the King’s honour, and the\nhappiness and tranquillity of his people, was the absolute power of the\nsovereign; that this was my creed, and it would pain me to give any room\nfor suspicion that I was wavering in it.",
        "“Could you ever believe,” said he, “that I should desire any other order\nof things?  Have you any doubt of my attachment to the King’s person, and\nthe maintenance of his rights?”",
        "“I know it, Count,” replied I; “but you are not ignorant that you lie\nunder the imputation of having adopted revolutionary ideas.”",
        "“Well, madame, have resolution enough to dissemble and to conceal your\nreal sentiments; dissimulation was never more necessary.  Endeavours are\nbeing made to paralyse the evil intentions of the factious as much as\npossible; but we must not be counteracted here by certain dangerous\nexpressions which are circulated in Paris as coming from the King and\nQueen.”",
        "I told him that I had been already struck with apprehension of the evil\nwhich might be done by the intemperate observations of persons who had no\npower to act; and that I had felt ill consequences from having repeatedly\nenjoined silence on those in the Queen’s service.",
        "“I know that,” said the Count; “the Queen informed me of it, and that\ndetermined me to come and request you to increase and keep alive, as much\nas you can, that spirit of discretion which is so necessary.”",
        "While the household of the King and Queen were a prey to all these fears,\nthe festivities in celebration of the acceptance of the constitution\nproceeded.  Their Majesties went to the Opera; the audience consisted\nentirely of persons who sided with the King, and on that day the\nhappiness of seeing him for a short time surrounded by faithful subjects\nmight be enjoyed.  The acclamations were then sincere.",
        "“La Coquette Corrigee” had been selected for representation at the\nTheatre Francais solely because it was the piece in which Mademoiselle\nContat shone most.  Yet the notions propagated by the Queen’s enemies\ncoinciding in my mind with the name of the play, I thought the choice\nvery ill-judged.  I was at a loss, however, how to tell her Majesty so;\nbut sincere attachment gives courage.  I explained myself; she was\nobliged to me, and desired that another play might be performed.  They\naccordingly selected “La Gouvernante,” almost equally unfortunate in\ntitle.",
        "The Queen, Madame the King’s daughter, and Madame Elisabeth were all well\nreceived on this occasion.  It is true that the opinions and feelings of\nthe spectators in the boxes could not be otherwise than favourable, and\ngreat pains had been taken, previously to these two performances, to fill\nthe pit with proper persons.  But, on the other hand, the Jacobins took\nthe same precautions on their side at the Theatre Italien, and the tumult\nwas excessive there.  The play was Gretry’s “Les Evenements Imprevus.\"\nUnfortunately, Madame Dugazon thought proper to bow to the Queen as she\nsang the words, “Ah, how I love my mistress!” in a duet.  Above twenty\nvoices immediately exclaimed from the pit, “No mistress!  no master!\nliberty!”  A few replied from the boxes and slips, “Vive le Roi!  vive la\nReine!”  Those in the pit answered, “No master! no Queen!” The quarrel\nincreased; the pit formed into parties; they began fighting, and the\nJacobins were beaten; tufts of their black hair flew about the theatre.–\n[At this time none but the Jacobins had discontinued the use of\nhairpowder.–MADAME CAMPAN.]– A military guard arrived.  The Faubourg\nSt. Antoine, hearing of what was going on at the Theatre Italien, flocked\ntogether, and began to talk of marching towards the scene of action.  The\nQueen preserved the calmest demeanour; the commandants of the guard\nsurrounded and encouraged her; they conducted themselves promptly and\ndiscreetly.  No accident happened.  The Queen was highly applauded as she\nquitted the theatre; it was the last time she was ever in one!",
        "While couriers were bearing confidential letters from the King to the\nPrinces, his brothers, and to the foreign sovereigns, the Assembly\ninvited him to write to the Princes in order to induce them to return to\nFrance.  The King desired the Abbe de Montesquiou to write the letter he\nwas to send; this letter, which was admirably composed in a simple and\naffecting style, suited to the character of Louis XVI., and filled with\nvery powerful arguments in favour of the advantages to be derived from\nadopting the principles of the constitution, was confided to me by the\nKing, who desired me to make him a copy of it.",
        "At this period M. M––-, one of the intendants of Monsieur’s household,\nobtained a passport from the Assembly to join that Prince on business\nrelative to his domestic concerns.  The Queen selected him to be the\nbearer of this letter.  She determined to give it to him herself, and to\ninform him of its object.  I was astonished at her choice of this\ncourier.  The Queen assured me he was exactly the man for her purpose,\nthat she relied even upon his indiscretion, and that it was merely\nnecessary that the letter from the King to his brothers should be known\nto exist.  The Princes were doubtless informed beforehand on the subject\nby the private correspondence.  Monsieur nevertheless manifested some\ndegree of surprise, and the messenger returned more grieved than pleased\nat this mark of confidence, which nearly cost him his life during the\nReign of Terror.",
        "Among the causes of uneasiness to the Queen there was one which was but\ntoo well founded, the thoughtlessness of the French whom she sent to\nforeign Courts.  She used to say that they had no sooner passed the\nfrontiers than they disclosed the most secret matters relative to the\nKing’s private sentiments, and that the leaders of the Revolution were\ninformed of them through their agents, many of whom were Frenchmen who\npassed themselves off as emigrants in the cause of their King.",
        "After the acceptance of the constitution, the formation of the King’s\nhousehold, as well military as civil, formed a subject of attention.\nThe Duc de Brissac had the command of the Constitutional Guard, which was\ncomposed of officers and men selected from the regiments, and of several\nofficers drawn from the National Guard of Paris.  The King was satisfied\nwith the feelings and conduct of this band, which, as is well known,\nexisted but a very short time.",
        "The new constitution abolished what were called honours, and the\nprerogatives belonging to them.  The Duchesse de Duras resigned her place\nof lady of the bedchamber, not choosing to lose her right to the tabouret\nat Court.  This step hurt the Queen, who saw herself forsaken through the\nloss of a petty privilege at a time when her own rights and even life\nwere so hotly attacked.  Many ladies of rank left the Court for the same\nreason.  However, the King and Queen did not dare to form the civil part\nof their household, lest by giving the new names of the posts they should\nacknowledge the abolition of the old ones, and also lest they should\nadmit into the highest positions persons not calculated to fill them\nwell.  Some time was spent in discussing the question, whether the\nhousehold should be formed without chevaliers and without ladies of\nhonour.  The Queen’s constitutional advisers were of opinion that the\nAssembly, having decreed a civil list adequate to uphold the splendour of\nthe throne, would be dissatisfied at seeing the King adopting only a\nmilitary household, and not forming his civil household upon the new\nconstitutional plan.  “How is it, Madame,” wrote Barnave to the Queen,\n\"that you will persist in giving these people even the smallest doubt as\nto your sentiments?  When they decree you a civil and a military\nhousehold, you, like young Achilles among the daughters of Lycomedes,\neagerly seize the sword and scorn the mere ornaments.”  The Queen\npersisted in her determination to have no civil household.  “If,” said\nshe, “this constitutional household be formed, not a single person of\nrank will remain with us, and upon a change of affairs we should be\nobliged to discharge the persons received into their place.”",
        "“Perhaps,” added she, “perhaps I might find one day that I had saved the\nnobility, if I now had resolution enough to afflict them for a time; I\nhave it not.  When any measure which injures them is wrested from us they\nsulk with me; nobody comes to my card party; the King goes unattended to\nbed.  No allowance is made for political necessity; we are punished for\nour very misfortunes.”",
        "The Queen wrote almost all day, and spent part of the night in reading:\nher courage supported her physical strength; her disposition was not at\nall soured by misfortunes, and she was never seen in an ill-humour for a\nmoment.  She was, however, held up to the people as a woman absolutely\nfurious and mad whenever the rights of the Crown were in any way\nattacked.",
        "I was with her one day at one of her windows.  We saw a man plainly\ndressed, like an ecclesiastic, surrounded by an immense crowd.  The Queen\nimagined it was some abbe whom they were about to throw into the basin of\nthe Tuileries; she hastily opened her window and sent a valet de chambre\nto know what was going forward in the garden.  It was Abbe Gregoire, whom\nthe men and women of the tribunes were bringing back in triumph, on\naccount of a motion he had just made in the National Assembly against the\nroyal authority.  On the following day the democratic journalists\ndescribed the Queen as witnessing this triumph, and showing, by\nexpressive gestures at her window, how highly she was exasperated by the\nhonours conferred upon the patriot.",
        "The correspondence between the Queen and the foreign powers was carried\non in cipher.  That to which she gave the preference can never be\ndetected; but the greatest patience is requisite for its use.  Each\ncorrespondent must have a copy of the same edition of some work.  She\nselected “Paul and Virginia.”  The page and line in which the letters\nrequired, and occasionally a monosyllable, are to be found are pointed\nout in ciphers agreed upon.  I assisted her in finding the letters, and\nfrequently I made an exact copy for her of all that she had ciphered,\nwithout knowing a single word of its meaning.",
        "There were always several secret committees in Paris occupied in\ncollecting information for the King respecting the measures of the\nfactions, and in influencing some of the committees of the Assembly.\nM. Bertrand de Molleville was in close correspondence with the Queen.\nThe King employed M. Talon and others; much money was expended through\nthe latter channel for the secret measures.  The Queen had no confidence\nin them.  M. de Laporte, minister of the civil list and of the household,\nalso attempted to give a bias to public opinion by means of hireling\npublications; but these papers influenced none but the royalist party,\nwhich did not need influencing.  M. de Laporte had a private police which\ngave him some useful information.",
        "I determined to sacrifice myself to my duty, but by no means to any\nintrigue, and I thought that, circumstanced as I was, I ought to confine\nmyself to obeying the Queen’s orders.  I frequently sent off couriers to\nforeign countries, and they were never discovered, so many precautions\ndid I take.  I am indebted for the preservation of my own existence to\nthe care I took never to admit any deputy to my abode, and to refuse all\ninterviews which even people of the highest importance often requested of\nme; but this line of conduct exposed me to every species of ill-will,\nand on the same day I saw myself denounced by Prud’homme, in his ’Gazette\nRevolutionnaire’, as capable of making an aristocrat of the mother of the\nGracchi, if a person so dangerous as myself could have got into her\nhousehold; and by Gauthier’s Gazette Royaliste, as a monarchist, a\nconstitutionalist, more dangerous to the Queen’s interests than a\nJacobin.",
        "At this period an event with which I had nothing to do placed me in a\nstill more critical situation.  My brother, M. Genet, began his\ndiplomatic career successfully.  At eighteen he was attached to the\nembassy to Vienna; at twenty he was appointed chief secretary of Legation\nin England, on occasion of the peace of 1783.  A memorial which he\npresented to M. de Vergennes upon the dangers of the treaty of commerce\nthen entered into with England gave offence to M. de Calonne, a patron of\nthat treaty, and particularly to M. Gerard de Rayneval, chief clerk for\nforeign affairs.  So long as M. de Vergennes lived, having upon my\nfather’s death declared himself the protector of my brother, he supported\nhim against the enemies his views had created.  But on his death M. de\nMontmorin, being much in need of the long experience in business which he\nfound in M. de Rayneval, was guided solely by the latter.  The office of\nwhich my brother was the head was suppressed.  He then went to St.\nPetersburg, strongly recommended to the Comte de Segur, minister from\nFrance to that Court, who appointed him secretary of Legation.  Some time\nafterwards the Comte de Segur left him at St. Petersburg, charged with\nthe affairs of France.  After his return from Russia, M. Genet was\nappointed ambassador to the United States by the party called Girondists,\nthe deputies who headed it being from the department of the Gironde.  He\nwas recalled by the Robespierre party, which overthrew the former\nfaction, on the 31st of May, 1793, and condemned to appear before the\nConvention.  Vice-President Clinton, at that time Governor of New York,\noffered him an asylum in his house and the hand of his daughter, and M.\nGenet established himself prosperously in America.",
        "When my brother quitted Versailles he was much hurt at being deprived of\na considerable income for having penned a memorial which his zeal alone\nhad dictated, and the importance of which was afterwards but too well\nunderstood.  I perceived from his correspondence that he inclined to some\nof the new notions.  He told me it was right he should no longer conceal\nfrom me that he sided with the constitutional party; that the King had in\nfact commanded it, having himself accepted the constitution; that he\nwould proceed firmly in that course, because in this case\ndisingenuousness would be fatal, and that he took that side of the\nquestion because he had had it proved to him that the foreign powers\nwould not serve the King’s cause without advancing pretensions prompted\nby long-standing interests, which always would influence their councils;\nthat he saw no salvation for the King and Queen but from within France,\nand that he would serve the constitutional King as he served him before\nthe Revolution.  And lastly, he requested me to impart to the Queen the\nreal sentiments of one of his Majesty’s agents at a foreign Court.  I\nimmediately went to the Queen and gave her my brother’s letter; she read\nit attentively, and said, “This is the letter of a young man led astray\nby discontent and ambition; I know you do not think as he does; do not\nfear that you will lose the confidence of the King and myself.”  I\noffered to discontinue all correspondence with my brother; she opposed\nthat, saying it would be dangerous.  I then entreated she would permit me\nin future to show her my own and my brother’s letters, to which she\nconsented.  I wrote warmly to my brother against the course he had\nadopted.  I sent my letters by sure channels; he answered me by the post,\nand no longer touched upon anything but family affairs.  Once only he\ninformed me that if I should write to him respecting the affairs of the\nday he would give me no answer.  “Serve your august mistress with the\nunbounded devotion which is due from you,” said he, “and let us each do\nour duty.  I will only observe to you that at Paris the fogs of the Seine\noften prevent people from seeing that immense capital, even from the\nPavilion of Flora, and I see it more clearly from St. Petersburg.\"\nThe Queen said, as she read this letter, “Perhaps he speaks but too\ntruly; who can decide upon so disastrous a position as ours has become?\"\nThe day on which I gave the Queen my brother’s first letter to read she\nhad several audiences to give to ladies and other persons belonging to\nthe Court, who came on purpose to inform her that my brother was an\navowed constitutionalist and revolutionist.  The Queen replied, “I know\nit; Madame Campan has told me so.”  Persons jealous of my situation\nhaving subjected me to mortifications, and these unpleasant circumstances\nrecurring daily, I requested the Queen’s permission to withdraw from\nCourt.  She exclaimed against the very idea, represented it to me as\nextremely dangerous for my own reputation, and had the kindness to add\nthat, for my sake as well as for her own, she never would consent to it.\nAfter this conversation I retired to my apartment.  A few minutes later a\nfootman brought me this note from the Queen: “I have never ceased to give\nyou and yours proofs of my attachment; I wish to tell you in writing that\nI have full faith in your honour and fidelity, as well as in your other\ngood qualities; and that I ever rely on the zeal and address you exert to\nserve me.”",
        "     [I had just received this letter from the Queen when M. de la\n     Chapelle, commissary-general of the King’s household, and head of\n     the offices of M. de Laporte, minister of the civil list, came to\n     see me.  The palace having been already sacked by the brigands on\n     the 20th of June, 1792, he proposed that I should entrust the paper\n     to him, that he might place it in a safer situation than the\n     apartments of the Queen.  When he returned into his offices he\n     placed the letter she had condescended to write to me behind a large\n     picture in his closet; but on the loth of August M. de la Chapelle\n     was thrown into the prisons of the Abbaye, and the committee of\n     public safety established themselves in his offices, whence they\n     issued all their decrees of death.  There it was that a villainous\n     servant belonging to M. de Laporte went to declare that in the\n     minister’s apartments, under a board in the floor, a number of\n     papers would be found.  They were brought forth, and M. de Laporte\n     was sent to the scaffold, where he suffered for having betrayed the\n     State by serving his master and sovereign.  M. de la Chapelle was\n     saved, as if by a miracle, from the massacres of the 2d of\n     September.  The committee of public safety having removed to the\n     King’s apartments at the Tuileries, M. de la Chapelle had permission\n     to return to his closet to take away some property belonging to him.\n     Turning round the picture, behind which he had hidden the Queen’s\n     letter, he found it in the place into which he had slipped it, and,\n     delighted to see that I was safe from the ill consequences the\n     discovery of this paper might have brought upon me, he burnt it\n     instantly.  In times of danger a mere nothing may save life or\n     destroy it.–MADAME CAMPAN]",
        "At the moment that I was going to express my gratitude to the Queen I\nheard a tapping at the door of my room, which opened upon the Queen’s\ninner corridor.  I opened it; it was the King.  I was confused; he\nperceived it, and said to me, kindly: “I alarm you, Madame Campan; I\ncome, however, to comfort you; the Queen has told me how much she is hurt\nat the injustice of several persons towards you.  But how is it that you\ncomplain of injustice and calumny when you see that we are victims of\nthem?  In some of your companions it is jealousy; in the people belonging\nto the Court it is anxiety.  Our situation is so disastrous, and we have\nmet with so much ingratitude and treachery, that the apprehensions of\nthose who love us are excusable!  I could quiet them by telling them all\nthe secret services you perform for us daily; but I will not do it.  Out\nof good-will to you they would repeat all I should say, and you would be\nlost with the Assembly.  It is much better, both for you and for us, that\nyou should be thought a constitutionalist.  It has been mentioned to me a\nhundred times already; I have never contradicted it; but I come to give\nyou my word that if we are fortunate enough to see an end of all this, I\nwill, at the Queen’s residence, and in the presence of my brothers,\nrelate the important services you have rendered us, and I will recompense\nyou and your son for them.”  I threw myself at the King’s feet and kissed\nhis hand.  He raised me up, saying, “Come, come, do not grieve; the\nQueen, who loves you, confides in you as I do.”",
        "Down to the day of the acceptance it was impossible to introduce Barnave\ninto the interior of the palace; but when the Queen was free from the\ninner guard she said she would see him.  The very great precautions which\nit was necessary for the deputy to take in order to conceal his\nconnection with the King and Queen compelled them to spend two hours\nwaiting for him in one of the corridors of the Tuileries, and all in\nvain.  The first day that he was to be admitted, a man whom Barnave knew\nto be dangerous having met him in the courtyard of the palace, he\ndetermined to cross it without stopping, and walked in the gardens in\norder to lull suspicion.  I was desired to wait for Barnave at a little\ndoor belonging to the entresols of the palace, with my hand upon the open\nlock.  I was in that position for an hour.  The King came to me\nfrequently, and always to speak to me of the uneasiness which a servant\nbelonging to the Chateau, who was a patriot, gave him.  He came again to\nask me whether I had heard the door called de Decret opened.  I assured\nhim nobody had been in the corridor, and he became easy.  He was\ndreadfully apprehensive that his connection with Barnave would be\ndiscovered.  “It would,” said the King, “be a ground for grave\naccusations, and the unfortunate man would be lost.”  I then ventured to\nremind his Majesty that as Barnave was not the only one in the secret of\nthe business which brought him in contact with their Majesties, one of\nhis colleagues might be induced to speak of the association with which\nthey were honoured, and that in letting them know by my presence that I\nalso was informed of it, a risk was incurred of removing from those\ngentlemen part of the responsibility of the secret.  Upon this\nobservation the King quitted me hastily and returned a moment afterwards\nwith the Queen.  “Give me your place,” said she; “I will wait for him in\nmy turn.  You have convinced the King.  We must not increase in their\neyes the number of persons informed of their communications with us.”",
        "The police of M. de Laporte, intendant of the civil list, apprised him,\nas early as the latter end of 1791, that a man belonging to the King’s\noffices who had set up as a pastrycook at the Palais Royal was about to\nresume the duties of his situation, which had devolved upon him again on\nthe death of one who held it for life; that he was so furious a Jacobin\nthat he had dared to say it would be a good thing for France if the\nKing’s days were shortened.  His duty was confined to making the pastry;\nhe was closely watched by the head officers of the kitchen, who were\ndevoted to his Majesty; but it is so easy to introduce a subtle poison\ninto made dishes that it was determined the King and Queen should eat\nonly plain roast meat in future; that their bread should be brought to\nthem by M. Thierry de Ville-d’Avray, intendant of the smaller apartments,\nand that he should likewise take upon himself to supply the wine.  The\nKing was fond of pastry; I was directed to order some, as if for myself,\nsometimes of one pastry-cook, and sometimes of another.  The pounded\nsugar, too, was kept in my room.  The King, the Queen, and Madame\nElisabeth ate together, and nobody remained to wait on them.  Each had a\ndumb waiter and a little bell to call the servants when they were wanted.\nM. Thierry used himself to bring me their Majesties’ bread and wine, and\nI locked them up in a private cupboard in the King’s closet on the ground\nfloor.  As soon as the King sat down to table I took in the pastry and\nbread.  All was hidden under the table lest it might be necessary to have\nthe servants in.  The King thought it dangerous as well as distressing to\nshow any apprehension of attempts against his person, or any mistrust of\nhis officers of the kitchen.  As he never drank a whole bottle of wine at\nhis meals (the Princesses drank nothing but water), he filled up that out\nof which he had drunk about half from the bottle served up by the\nofficers of his butlery.  I took it away after dinner.  Although he never\nate any other pastry than that which I brought, he took care in the same\nmanner that it should seem that he had eaten of that served at table.\nThe lady who succeeded me found this duty all regulated, and she executed\nit in the same manner; the public never was in possession of these\nparticulars, nor of the apprehensions which gave rise to them.  At the\nend of three or four months the police of M. de Laporte gave notice that\nnothing more was to be dreaded from that sort of plot against the King’s\nlife; that the plan was entirely changed; and that all the blows now to\nbe struck would be directed as much against the throne as against the\nperson of the sovereign.",
        "There are others besides myself who know that at this time one of the\nthings about which the Queen most desired to be satisfied was the opinion\nof the famous Pitt.  She would sometimes say to me, “I never pronounce\nthe name of Pitt without feeling a chill like that of death.”  (I repeat\nhere her very expressions.) “That man is the mortal enemy of France; and\nhe takes a dreadful revenge for the impolitic support given by the\nCabinet of Versailles to the American insurgents.  He wishes by our\ndestruction to guarantee the maritime power of his country forever\nagainst the efforts made by the King to improve his marine power and\ntheir happy results during the last war.  He knows that it is not only\nthe King’s policy but his private inclination to be solicitous about his\nfleets, and that the most active step he has taken during his whole reign\nwas to visit the port of Cherbourg.  Pitt had served the cause of the\nFrench Revolution from the first disturbances; he will perhaps serve it\nuntil its annihilation.  I will endeavour to learn to what point he\nintends to lead us, and I am sending M.––- to London for that purpose.\nHe has been intimately connected with Pitt, and they have often had\npolitical conversations respecting the French Government.  I will get him\nto make him speak out, at least so far as such a man can speak out.\"\nSome time afterwards the Queen told me that her secret envoy was returned\nfrom London, and that all he had been able to wring from Pitt, whom he\nfound alarmingly reserved, was that he would not suffer the French\nmonarchy to perish; that to suffer the revolutionary spirit to erect an\norganised republic in France would be a great error, affecting the\ntranquillity of Europe.  “Whenever,” said she, “Pitt expressed himself\nupon the necessity of supporting monarchy in France, he maintained the\nmost profound silence upon what concerns the monarch.  The result of\nthese conversations is anything but encouraging; but, even as to that\nmonarchy which he wishes to save, will he have means and strength to save\nit if he suffers us to fall?”",
        "The death of the Emperor Leopold took place on the 1st of March, 1792.\nWhen the news of this event reached the Tuileries, the Queen was gone\nout.  Upon her return I put the letter containing it into her hands.  She\nexclaimed that the Emperor had been poisoned; that she had remarked and\npreserved a newspaper, in which, in an article upon the sitting of the\nJacobins, at the time when the Emperor Leopold declared for the\ncoalition, it was said, speaking of him, that a pie-crust would settle\nthat matter.  At this period Barnave obtained the Queen’s consent that he\nshould read all the letters she should write.  He was fearful of private\ncorrespondences that might hamper the plan marked out for her; he\nmistrusted her Majesty’s sincerity on this point; and the diversity of\ncounsels, and the necessity of yielding, on the one hand, to some of the\nviews of the constitutionalists, and on the other, to those of the French\nPrinces, and even of foreign Courts, were unfortunately the circumstances\nwhich most rapidly impelled the Court towards its ruin.",
        "However, the emigrants showed great apprehensions of the consequences\nwhich might follow in the interior from a connection with the\nconstitutionalists, whom they described as a party existing only in idea,\nand totally without means of repairing their errors.  The Jacobins were\npreferred to them, because, said they, there would be no treaty to be\nmade with any one at the moment of extricating the King and his family\nfrom the abyss in which they were plunged.",
        "In the beginning of the year 1792, a worthy priest requested a private\ninterview with me.  He had learned the existence of a new libel by Madame\nde Lamotte.  He told me that the people who came from London to get it\nprinted in Paris only desired gain, and that they were ready to deliver\nthe manuscript to him for a thousand louis, if he could find any friend\nof the Queen disposed to make that sacrifice for her peace; that he had\nthought of me, and if her Majesty would give him the twenty-four thousand\nfrancs, he would hand the manuscript to me.",
        "I communicated this proposal to the Queen, who rejected it, and desired\nme to answer that at the time when she had power to punish the hawkers of\nthese libels she deemed them so atrocious and incredible that she\ndespised them too much to stop them; that if she were imprudent and weak\nenough to buy a single one of them, the Jacobins might possibly discover\nthe circumstance through their espionage; that were this libel brought\nup, it would be printed nevertheless, and would be much more dangerous\nwhen they apprised the public of the means she had used to suppress it.",
        "Baron d’Aubier, gentleman-in-ordinary to the King, and my particular\nfriend, had a good memory and a clear way of communicating the substance\nof the debates and decrees of the National Assembly.  I went daily to the\nQueen’s apartments to repeat all this to the King, who used to say, on\nseeing me, “Ah! here’s the Postillon par Calais,\"–a newspaper of the\ntime.",
        "M. d’Aubier one day said to me: “The Assembly has been much occupied with\nan information laid by the workmen of the Sevres manufactory.  They\nbrought to the President’s office a bundle of pamphlets which they said\nwere the life of Marie Antoinette.  The director of the manufactory was\nordered up to the bar, and declared he had received orders to burn the\nprinted sheets in question in the furnaces used for baking his china.”",
        "While I was relating this business to the Queen the King coloured and\nheld his head down over his plate.  The Queen said to him, “Do you know\nanything about this, Sire?”  The King made no answer.  Madame Elisabeth\nrequested him to explain what it meant.  Louis was still silent.  I\nwithdrew hastily.  A few minutes afterwards the Queen came to my room and\ninformed me that the King, out of regard for her, had purchased the whole\nedition struck off from the manuscript which I had mentioned to her, and\nthat M. de Laporte had not been able to devise any more secret way of\ndestroying the work than that of having it burnt at Sevres, among two\nhundred workmen, one hundred and eighty of whom must, in all probability,\nbe Jacobins!  She told me she had concealed her vexation from the King;\nthat he was in consternation, and that she could say nothing, since his\ngood intentions and his affection for her had been the cause of the\nmistake.",
        "     [M. de Laporte had by order of the King bought up the whole edition\n     of the “Memoirs” of the notorious Madame de Lamotte against the\n     Queen.  Instead of destroying them immediately, he shut them up in\n     one of the closets in his house, The alarming and rapid growth of\n     the rebellion, the arrogance of the crowd of brigands, who in great\n     measure composed the populace of Paris, and the fresh excesses daily\n     resulting from it, rendered the intendant of the civil list\n     apprehensive that some mob might break into his house, carry off\n     these “Memoirs,” and spread them among the public.  In order to\n     prevent this he gave orders to have the “Memoirs” burnt with every\n     necessary precaution; and the clerk who received the order entrusted\n     the execution of it to a man named Riston, a dangerous Intriguer,\n     formerly an advocate of Nancy, who had a twelve-month before escaped\n     the gallows by favour of the new principles and the patriotism of\n     the new tribunals, although convicted of forging the great seal, and\n     fabricating decrees of the council.  This Riston, finding himself\n     entrusted with a commission which concerned her Majesty, and the\n     mystery attending which bespoke something of importance, was less\n     anxious to execute it faithfully than to make a parade of this mark\n     of confidence.  On the 30th of May, at ten in the morning, he had\n     the sheets carried to the porcelain manufactory at Sevres, in a cart\n     which he himself accompanied, and made a large fire of them before\n     all the workmen, who were expressly forbidden to approach it.  All\n     these precautions, and the suspicions to which they gave rise, under\n     such critical circumstances, gave so much publicity to this affair\n     that it was denounced to the Assembly that very night.  Brissot, and\n     the whole Jacobin party, with equal effrontery and vehemence,\n     insisted that the papers thus secretly burnt could be no other than\n     the registers and documents of the correspondence of the Austrian\n     committee.  M. de Laporte was ordered to the bar, and there gave the\n     most precise account of the circumstances.  Riston was also called\n     up, and confirmed M. de Laporte’s deposition.  But these\n     explanations, however satisfactory, did not calm the violent ferment\n     raised in the Assembly by this affair.–\"Memoirs of Bertrand de\n     Molleville.\"]",
        "Some time afterwards the Assembly received a denunciation against M. de\nMontmorin.  The ex-minister was accused of having neglected forty\ndespatches from M. Genet, the charge d’affaires from France in Russia,\nnot having even unsealed them, because M. Genet acted on constitutional\nprinciples.  M. de Montmorin appeared at the bar to answer this\naccusation.  Whatever distress I might feel in obeying the order I had\nreceived from the King to go and give him an account of the sitting, I\nthought I ought not to fail in doing so.  But instead of giving my\nbrother his family name, I merely said “your Majesty’s charge d’affaires\nat St. Petersburg.”",
        "The King did me the favour to say that he noticed a reserve in my\naccount, of which he approved.  The Queen condescended to add a few\nobliging remarks to those of the King.  However, my office of journalist\ngave me in this instance so much pain that I took an opportunity, when\nthe King was expressing his satisfaction to me at the manner in which I\ngave him this daily account, to tell him that its merits belonged wholly\nto M. d’Aubier; and I ventured to request the King to suffer that\nexcellent man to give him an account of the sittings himself.  I assured\nthe King that if he would permit it, that gentleman might proceed to the\nQueen’s apartments through mine unseen; the King consented to the\narrangement.  Thenceforward M. d’Aubier gave the King repeated proofs of\nzeal and attachment.",
        "The Cure of St. Eustache ceased to be the Queen’s confessor when he took\nthe constitutional oath.  I do not remember the name of the ecclesiastic\nwho succeeded him; I only know that he was conducted into her apartments\nwith the greatest mystery.  Their Majesties did not perform their Easter\ndevotions in public, because they could neither declare for the\nconstitutional clergy, nor act so as to show that they were against them.",
        "The Queen did perform her Easter devotions in 1792; but she went to the\nchapel attended only by myself.  She desired me beforehand to request one\nof my relations, who was her chaplain, to celebrate a mass for her at\nfive o’clock in the morning.  It was still dark; she gave me her arm,\nand I lighted her with a taper.  I left her alone at the chapel door.\nShe did not return to her room until the dawn of day.",
        "Dangers increased daily.  The Assembly were strengthened in the eyes of\nthe people by the hostilities of the foreign armies and the army of the\nPrinces.  The communication with the latter party became more active;\nthe Queen wrote almost every day.  M. de Goguelat possessed her\nconfidence for all correspondence with the foreign parties, and I was\nobliged to have him in my apartments; the Queen asked for him very\nfrequently, and at times which she could not previously appoint.",
        "All parties were exerting themselves either to ruin or to save the King.\nOne day I found the Queen extremely agitated; she told me she no longer\nknew where she was; that the leaders of the Jacobins offered themselves\nto her through the medium of Dumouriez; or that Dumouriez, abandoning the\nJacobins, had come and offered himself to her; that she had granted him\nan audience; that when alone with her, he had thrown himself at her feet,\nand told her that he had drawn the ’bonnet rouge’ over his head to the\nvery ears; but that he neither was nor could be a Jacobin; that the\nRevolution had been suffered to extend even to that rabble of destroyers\nwho, thinking of nothing but pillage, were ripe for anything, and might\nfurnish the Assembly with a formidable army, ready to undermine the\nremains of a throne already but too much shaken.  Whilst speaking with\nthe utmost ardour he seized the Queen’s hand and kissed it with\ntransport, exclaiming, “Suffer yourself to be saved!”  The Queen told me\nthat the protestations of a traitor were not to be relied on; that the\nwhole of his conduct was so well known that undoubtedly the wisest course\nwas not to trust to it;",
        "     [The sincerity of General Dumouriez cannot be doubted in this\n     instance.  The second volume of his Memoirs shows how unjust the\n     mistrust and reproaches of the Queen were.  By rejecting his\n     services, Marie Antoinette deprived herself of her only remaining\n     support.  He who saved France in the defiles of Argonne would\n     perhaps have saved France before the 20th of June, had he obtained\n     the full confidence of Louis XVI. and the Queen.–NOTE BY THE\n     EDITOR.]",
        "that, moreover, the Princes particularly recommended that no confidence\nshould be placed in any proposition emanating from within the kingdom;\nthat the force without became imposing; and that it was better to rely\nupon their success, and upon the protection due from Heaven to a\nsovereign so virtuous as Louis XVI.  and to so just a cause.",
        "The constitutionalists, on their part, saw that there had been nothing\nmore than a pretence of listening to them.  Barnave’s last advice was as\nto the means of continuing, a few weeks longer, the Constitutional Guard,\nwhich had been denounced to the Assembly, and was to be disbanded.  The\ndenunciation against the Constitutional Guard affected only its staff,\nand the Duc de Brissac.  Barnave wrote to the Queen that the staff of the\nguard was already attacked; that the Assembly was about to pass a decree\nto reduce it; and he entreated her to prevail on the King, the very\ninstant the decree should appear, to form the staff afresh of persons\nwhose names he sent her.  Barnave said that all who were set down in it\npassed for decided Jacobins, but were not so in fact; that they, as well\nas himself, were in despair at seeing the monarchical government\nattacked; that they had learnt to dissemble their sentiments, and that it\nwould be at least a fortnight before the Assembly could know them well,\nand certainly before it could succeed in making them unpopular; that it\nwould be necessary to take advantage of that short space of time to get\naway from Paris, immediately after their nomination.  The Queen was of\nopinion that she ought not to yield to this advice.  The Duc de Brissac\nwas sent to Orleans, and the guard was disbanded.",
        "Barnave, seeing that the Queen did not follow his counsel in anything,\nand convinced that she placed all her reliance on assistance from abroad,\ndetermined to quit Paris.  He obtained a last audience.  “Your\nmisfortunes, Madame,” said he, “and those which I anticipate for France,.\ndetermined me to sacrifice myself to serve you.  I see, however, that my\nadvice does not agree with the views of your Majesties.  I augur but\nlittle advantage from the plan you are induced to pursue,–you are too\nremote from your succours; you will be lost before they reach you.  Most\nardently do I wish I may be mistaken in so lamentable a prediction; but I\nam sure to pay with my head for the interest your misfortunes have raised\nin me, and the services I have sought to render you.  I request, for my\nsole reward, the honour of kissing your hand.”  The Queen, her eyes\nsuffused with tears, granted him that favour, and remained impressed with\na favourable idea of his sentiments.  Madame Elisabeth participated in\nthis opinion, and the two Princesses frequently spoke of Barnave.  The\nQueen also received M. Duport several times, but with less mystery.  Her\nconnection with the constitutional deputies transpired.  Alexandre de\nLameth was the only one of the three who survived the vengeance of the\nJacobins.",
        "     [Barnave was arrested at Grenoble.  He remained in prison in that\n     town fifteen months, and his friends began to hope that he would be\n     forgotten, when an order arrived that he should be removed to Paris.\n     At first he was imprisoned in the Abbaye, but transferred to the\n     Conciergerie, and almost immediately taken before the revolutionary\n     tribunal.  He appeared there with wonderful firmness, summed up the\n     services he had rendered to the cause of liberty with his usual\n     eloquence, and made such an impression upon the numerous auditors\n     that, although accustomed to behold only conspirators worthy of\n     death in all those who appeared before the tribunal, they themselves\n     considered his acquittal certain.  The decree of death was read\n     amidst the deepest silence; but Barnave’a firmness was immovable.\n     When he left the court, he cast upon the judges, the jurors, and the\n     public looks expressive of contempt and indignation.  He was led to\n     his fate with the respected Duport du Tertre, one of the last\n     ministers of Louis XVI. when he had ascended the scaffold, Barnave\n     stamped, raised his eyes to heaven, and said: “This, then, is the\n     reward of all that I have done for liberty!”  He fell on the 29th of\n     October, 1793, in the thirty-second year of his age; his bust was\n     placed in the Grenoble Museum.

        "About this time the King fell into a despondent state, which amounted\nalmost to physical helplessness.  He passed ten successive days without\nuttering a single word, even in the bosom of his family; except, indeed,\nwhen playing at backgammon after dinner with Madame Elisabeth.  The Queen\nroused him from this state, so fatal at a critical period, by throwing\nherself at his feet, urging every alarming idea, and employing every\naffectionate expression.  She represented also what he owed to his\nfamily; and told him that if they were doomed to fall they ought to fall\nhonourably, and not wait to be smothered upon the floor of their\napartment.",
        "About the 15th of June, 1792, the King refused his sanction to the two\ndecrees ordaining the deportation of priests and the formation of a camp\nof twenty thousand men under the walls of Paris.  He himself wished to\nsanction them, and said that the general insurrection only waited for a\npretence to burst forth.  The Queen insisted upon the veto, and\nreproached herself bitterly when this last act of the constitutional\nauthority had occasioned the day of the 20th of June.",
        "A few days previously about twenty thousand men had gone to the Commune\nto announce that, on the 20th, they would plant the tree of liberty at\nthe door of the National Assembly, and present a petition to the King\nrespecting the veto which he had placed upon the decree for the\ndeportation of the priests.  This dreadful army crossed the garden of the\nTuileries, and marched under the Queen’s windows; it consisted of people\nwho called themselves the citizens of the Faubourgs St. Antoine and St.\nMarceau.  Clothed in filthy rags, they bore a most terrifying appearance,\nand even infected the air.  People asked each other where such an army\ncould come from; nothing so disgusting had ever before appeared in Paris.",
        "On the 20th of June this mob thronged about the Tuileries in still\ngreater numbers, armed with pikes, hatchets, and murderous instruments of\nall kinds, decorated with ribbons of the national colours, Shouting, “The\nnation for ever!  Down with the veto!”  The King was without guards.\nSome of these desperadoes rushed up to his apartment; the door was about\nto be forced in, when the King commanded that it should be opened.\nMessieurs de Bougainville, d’Hervilly, de Parois, d’Aubier, Acloque,\nGentil, and other courageous men who were in the apartment of M. de\nSepteuil, the King’s first valet de chambre, instantly ran to his\nMajesty’s apartment.  M. de Bougainville, seeing the torrent furiously\nadvancing, cried out, “Put the King in the recess of the window, and\nplace benches before him.”  Six royalist grenadiers of the battalion of\nthe Filles Saint Thomas made their way by an inner staircase, and ranged\nthemselves before the benches.  The order given by M. de Bougainville\nsaved the King from the blades of the assassins, among whom was a Pole\nnamed Lazousky, who was to strike the first blow.  The King’s brave\ndefenders said, “Sire, fear nothing.”  The King’s reply is well known:\n\"Put your hand upon my heart, and you will perceive whether I am afraid.\"\nM. Vanot, commandant of battalion, warded off a blow aimed by a wretch\nagainst the King; a grenadier of the Filles Saint Thomas parried a sword-\nthrust made in the same direction.  Madame Elisabeth ran to her brother’s\napartments; when she reached the door she heard loud threats of death\nagainst the Queen: they called for the head of the Austrian.  “Ah!  let\nthem think I am the Queen,” she said to those around her, “that she may\nhave time to escape.”",
        "The Queen could not join the King; she was in the council chamber, where\nshe had been placed behind the great table to protect her, as much as\npossible, against the approach of the barbarians.  Preserving a noble and\nbecoming demeanour in this dreadful situation, she held the Dauphin\nbefore her, seated upon the table.  Madame was at her side; the Princesse\nde Lamballe, the Princesse de Tarente, Madame de la Roche-Aymon, Madame\nde Tourzel, and Madame de Mackau surrounded her.  She had fixed a\ntricoloured cockade, which one of the National Guard had given her, upon\nher head.  The poor little Dauphin was, like the King, shrouded in an\nenormous red cap.  The horde passed in files before the table;",
        "     [One of the circumstances of the 20th of June which most vexed the\n     King’s friends being that of his wearing the bonnet rouge nearly\n     three hours, I ventured to ask him for some explanation of a fact so\n     strikingly in contrast with the extraordinary intrepidity shown by\n     his Majesty during that horrible day.  This was his answer: “The\n     cries of ’The nation for ever!’ violently increasing around me, and\n     seeming to be addressed to me, I replied that the nation had not a\n     warmer friend than myself.  Upon this an ill-looking man, making his\n     way through the crowd, came up to me and said, rather roughly,\n     ’Well, if you speak the truth, prove it by putting on this red cap.’\n     ’I consent,’ replied I.  One or two of them immediately came forward\n     and placed the cap upon my hair, for it was too small for my head.\n     I was convinced, I knew not why, that his intention was merely to\n     place the cap upon my head for a moment, and then to take it off\n     again; and I was so completely taken up with what was passing before\n     me that I did not feel whether the cap did or did not remain upon my\n     hair.  I was so little aware of it that when I returned to my room I\n     knew only from being told so that it was still there.  I was very\n     much surprised to find it upon my head, and was the more vexed at it\n     because I might have taken it off immediately without the smallest\n     difficulty.  But I am satisfied that if I had hesitated to consent\n     to its being placed upon my head the drunken fellow who offered it\n     to me would have thrust his pike into my stomach.\"–\"Memoirs of\n     Bertrand de Molleville.\"]",
        "the sort of standards which they carried were symbols of the most\natrocious barbarity.  There was one representing a gibbet, to which a\ndirty doll was suspended; the words “Marie Antoinette a la lanterne” were\nwritten beneath it.  Another was a board, to which a bullock’s heart was\nfastened, with “Heart of Louis XVI.” written round it.  And a third\nshowed the horn of an ox, with an obscene inscription.",
        "One of the most furious Jacobin women who marched with these wretches\nstopped to give vent to a thousand imprecations against the Queen.  Her\nMajesty asked whether she had ever seen her.  She replied that she had\nnot.  Whether she had done her any, personal wrong?  Her answer was the\nsame; but she added:",
        "“It is you who have caused the misery of the nation.”",
        "“You have been told so,” answered the Queen; “you are deceived.  As the\nwife of the King of France, and mother of the Dauphin, I am a French-\nwoman; I shall never see my own country again, I can be happy or unhappy\nonly in France; I was happy when you loved me.”",
        "The fury began to weep, asked her pardon, and said, “It was because I did\nnot know you; I see that you are good.”",
        "Santerre, the monarch of the faubourgs, made his subjects file off as\nquickly as he could; and it was thought at the time that he was ignorant\nof the object of this insurrection, which was the murder of the royal\nfamily.  However, it was eight o’clock in the evening before the palace\nwas completely cleared.  Twelve deputies, impelled by attachment to the\nKing’s person, ranged themselves near him at the commencement of the\ninsurrection; but the deputation from the Assembly did not reach the\nTuileries until six in the evening; all the doors of the apartments were\nbroken.  The Queen pointed out to the deputies the state of the King’s\npalace, and the disgraceful manner in which his asylum had been violated\nunder the very eyes of the Assembly; she saw that Merlin de Thionville\nwas so much affected as to shed tears while she spoke.",
        "“You weep, M. Merlin,” said she to him, “at seeing the King and his\nfamily so cruelly treated by a people whom he always wished to make\nhappy.”",
        "“True, Madame,” replied Merlin; “I weep for the misfortunes of a\nbeautiful and feeling woman, the mother of a family; but do not mistake,\nnot one of my tears falls for either King or Queen; I hate kings and\nqueens,–it is my religion.”",
        "The Queen could not appreciate this madness, and saw all that was to be\napprehended by persons who evinced it.",
        "All hope was gone, and nothing was thought of but succour from abroad.\nThe Queen appealed to her family and the King’s brothers; her letters\nprobably became more pressing, and expressed apprehensions upon the\ntardiness of relief.  Her Majesty read me one to herself from the\nArchduchess Christina, Gouvernante of the Low Countries: she reproached\nthe Queen for some of her expressions, and told her that those out of\nFrance were at least as much alarmed as herself at the King’s situation\nand her own; but that the manner of attempting to assist her might either\nsave her or endanger her safety; and that the members of the coalition\nwere bound to act prudently, entrusted as they were with interests so\ndear to them.",
        "The 14th of July, 1792, fixed by the constitution as the anniversary of\nthe independence of the nation drew near.  The King and Queen were\ncompelled to make their appearance on the occasion; aware that the plot\nof the 20th of June had their assassination for its object, they had no\ndoubt but that their death was determined on for the day of this national\nfestival.  The Queen was recommended, in order to give the King’s friends\ntime to defend him if the attack should be made, to guard him against the\nfirst stroke of a dagger by making him wear a breastplate.  I was\ndirected to get one made in my apartments: it was composed of fifteen\nfolds of Italian taffety, and formed into an under-waistcoat and a wide\nbelt.  This breastplate was tried; it resisted all thrusts of the dagger,\nand several balls were turned aside by it.  When it was completed the\ndifficulty was to let the King try it on without running the risk of\nbeing surprised.  I wore the immense heavy waistcoat as an under-\npetticoat for three days without being able to find a favourable moment.\nAt length the King found an opportunity one morning to pull off his coat\nin the Queen’s chamber and try on the breastplate.",
        "The Queen was in bed; the King pulled me gently by the gown, and drew me\nas far as he could from the Queen’s bed, and said to me, in a very low\ntone of voice: “It is to satisfy her that I submit to this inconvenience:\nthey will not assassinate me; their scheme is changed; they will put me\nto death another way.”  The Queen heard the King whispering to me, and\nwhen he was gone out she asked me what he had said.  I hesitated to\nanswer; she insisted that I should, saying that nothing must be concealed\nfrom her, and that she was resigned upon every point.",
        "When she was informed of the King’s remark she told me she had guessed\nit, that he had long since observed to her that all which was going\nforward in France was an imitation of the revolution in England in the\ntime of Charles I., and that he was incessantly reading the history of\nthat unfortunate monarch in order that he might act better than Charles\nhad done at a similar crisis.  “I begin to be fearful of the King’s being\nbrought to trial,” continued the Queen; “as to me, I am a foreigner; they\nwill assassinate me.  What will become of my poor children?”",
        "These sad ejaculations were followed by a torrent of tears.  I wished to\ngive her an antispasmodic; she refused it, saying that only happy women\ncould feel nervous; that the cruel situation to which she was reduced\nrendered these remedies useless.  In fact, the Queen, who during her\nhappier days was frequently attacked by hysterical disorders, enjoyed\nmore uniform health when all the faculties of her soul were called forth\nto support her physical strength.",
        "I had prepared a corset for her, for the same purpose as the King’s\nunder-waistcoat, without her knowledge; but she would not make use of it;\nall my entreaties, all my tears, were in vain.  “If the factions\nassassinate me,” she replied, “it will be a fortunate event for me; they\nwill deliver me from a most painful existence.”  A few days after the\nKing had tried on his breastplate I met him on a back staircase.  I drew\nback to let him pass.  He stopped and took my hand; I wished to kiss his;\nhe would not suffer it, but drew me towards him by the hand, and kissed\nboth my cheeks without saying a single word.",
        "The fear of another attack upon the Tuileries occasioned scrupulous\nsearch among the King’s papers",
        "I burnt almost all those belonging to the Queen.  She put her family\nletters, a great deal of correspondence which she thought it necessary to\npreserve for the history of the era of the Revolution, and particularly\nBarnave’s letters and her answers, of which she had copies, into a\nportfolio, which she entrusted to M. de J––.  That gentleman was unable\nto save this deposit, and it was burnt.  The Queen left a few papers in\nher secretaire.  Among them were instructions to Madame de Tourzel,\nrespecting the dispositions of her children and the characters and\nabilities of the sub-governesses under that lady’s orders.  This paper,\nwhich the Queen drew up at the time of Madame de Tourzel’s appointment,\nwith several letters from Maria Theresa, filled with the best advice and\ninstructions, was printed after the 10th of August by order of the\nAssembly in the collection of papers found in the secretaires of the King\nand Queen.",
        "Her Majesty had still, without reckoning the income of the month, one\nhundred and forty thousand francs in gold.  She was desirous of\ndepositing the whole of it with me; but I advised her to retain fifteen\nhundred louis, as a sum of rather considerable amount might be suddenly\nnecessary for her.  The King had an immense quantity of papers, and\nunfortunately conceived the idea of privately making, with the assistance\nof a locksmith who had worked with him above ten years, a place of\nconcealment in an inner corridor of his apartments.  The place of\nconcealment, but for the man’s information, would have been long\nundiscovered?  The wall in which it was made was painted to imitate large\nstones, and the opening was entirely concealed among the brown grooves\nwhich formed the shaded part of these painted stones.  But even before\nthis locksmith had denounced what was afterwards called the iron closet\nto the Assembly, the Queen was aware that he had talked of it to some of\nhis friends; and that this man, in whom the King from long habit placed\ntoo much confidence, was a Jacobin.  She warned the King of it, and\nprevailed on him to fill a very large portfolio with all the papers he\nwas most interested in preserving, and entrust it to me.  She entreated\nhim in my presence to leave nothing in this closet; and the King, in\norder to quiet her, told her that he had left nothing there.  I would\nhave taken the portfolio and carried it to my apartment, but it was too\nheavy for me to lift.  The King said he would carry it himself; I went\nbefore to open the doors for him.  When he placed the portfolio in my\ninner closet he merely said, “The Queen will tell you what it contains.\"\nUpon my return to the Queen I put the question to her, deeming, from what\nthe King had said, that it was necessary I should know.  “They are,” the\nQueen answered me, “such documents as would be most dangerous to the King\nshould they go so far as to proceed to a trial against him.  But what he\nwishes me to tell you is, that the portfolio contains a ’proces-verbal’\nof a cabinet council, in which the King gave his opinion against the war.\nHe had it signed by all the ministers, and, in case of a trial, he trusts\nthat this document will be very useful to him.”  I asked the Queen to\nwhom she thought I ought to commit the portfolio.  “To whom you please,\"\nanswered she; “you alone are answerable for it.  Do not quit the palace\neven during your vacation months: there may be circumstances under which\nit would be very desirable that we should be able to have it instantly.”",
        "At this period M. de La Fayette, who had probably given up the idea of\nestablishing a republic in France similar to that of the United States,\nand was desirous to support the first constitution which he had sworn to\ndefend, quitted his army and came to the Assembly for the purpose of\nsupporting by his presence and by an energetic speech a petition signed\nby twenty thousand citizens against the late violation of the residence\nof the King and his family.  The General found the constitutional party\npowerless, and saw that he himself had lost his popularity.  The Assembly\ndisapproved of the step he had taken; the King, for whom it, was taken,\nshowed no satisfaction at it, and he saw himself compelled to return to\nhis army as quickly as he could.  He thought he could rely on the\nNational Guard; but on the day of his arrival those officers who were in\nthe King’s interest inquired of his Majesty whether they were to forward\nthe views of Gendral de La Fayette by joining him in such measures as he\nshould pursue during his stay at Paris.  The King enjoined them not to do\nso.  From this answer M. de La Fayette perceived that he was abandoned by\nthe remainder of his party in the Paris guard.",
        "On his arrival a plan was presented to the Queen, in which it was\nproposed by a junction between La Fayette’s army and the King’s party to\nrescue the royal family and convey them to Rouen.  I did not learn the\nparticulars of this plan; the Queen only said to me upon the subject that\nM. de La Fayette was offered to them as a resource; but that it would be\nbetter for them to perish than to owe their safety to the man who had\ndone them the most mischief, or to place themselves under the necessity\nof treating with him.",
        "I passed the whole month of July without going to bed; I was fearful of\nsome attack by night.  There was one plot against the Queen’s life which\nhas never been made known.  I was alone by her bedside at one o’clock in\nthe morning; we heard somebody walking softly down the corridor, which\npasses along the whole line of her apartments, and which was then locked\nat each end.  I went out to fetch the valet de chambre; he entered the\ncorridor, and the Queen and myself soon heard the noise of two men\nfighting.  The unfortunate Princess held me locked in her arms, and\nsaid to me, “What a situation! insults by day and assassins by night!\"\nThe valet de chambre cried out to her from the corridor, “Madame, it is a\nwretch that I know; I have him!\"–\"Let him go,” said the Queen; “open the\ndoor to him; he came to murder me; the Jacobins would carry him about in\ntriumph to-morrow.”  The man was a servant of the King’s toilet, who had\ntaken the key of the corridor out of his Majesty’s pocket after he was in\nbed, no doubt with the intention of committing the crime suspected.  The\nvalet de chambre, who was a very strong man, held him by the wrists, and\nthrust him out at the door.  The wretch did not speak a word.  The valet\nde chambre said, in answer to the Queen, who spoke to him gratefully of\nthe danger to which he had exposed himself, that he feared nothing, and\nthat he had always a pair of excellent pistols about him for no other\npurpose than to defend her Majesty.  The next day M. de Septeuil had all\nthe locks of the King’s inner apartments changed.  I did the same by\nthose of the Queen.",
        "We were every moment told that the Faubourg St. Antoine was preparing to\nmarch against the palace.  At four o’clock one morning towards the latter\nend of July a person came to give me information to that effect.  I\ninstantly sent off two men, on whom I could rely, with orders to proceed\nto the usual places for assembling, and to come back speedily and give me\nan account of the state of the city.  We knew that at least an hour must\nelapse before the populace or the faubourgs assembled on the site of the\nBastille could reach the Tuileries.  It seemed to me sufficient for the\nQueen’s safety that all about her should be awakened. I went softly into\nher room; she was asleep; I did not awaken her.  I found General de W––\nin the great closet; he told me the meeting was, for this once,\ndispersing.  The General had endeavoured to please the populace by the\nsame means as M. de La Fayette had employed.  He saluted the lowest\npoissarde, and lowered his hat down to his very stirrup. But the\npopulace, who had been flattered for three years, required far different\nhomage to its power, and the poor man was unnoticed.  The King had been\nawakened, and so had Madame Elisabeth, who had gone to him.  The Queen,\nyielding to the weight of her griefs, slept till nine o’clock on that\nday, which was very unusual with her.  The King had already been to know\nwhether she was awake; I told him what I had done, and the care I had\ntaken not to disturb her.  He thanked me, and said, “I was awake, and so\nwas the whole palace; she ran no risk.  I am very glad to see her take a\nlittle rest.  Alas! her griefs double mine!” What was my chagrin when,\nupon awaking and learning what had passed, the Queen burst into tears\nfrom regret at not having been called, and began to upbraid me, on whose\nfriendship she ought to have been able to rely, for having served her so\nill under such circumstances!  In vain did I reiterate that it had been\nonly a false alarm, and that she required to have her strength recruited.\n\"It is not diminished,” said she; “misfortune gives us additional\nstrength.  Elisabeth was with the King, and I was asleep,–I who am\ndetermined to perish by his side!  I am his wife; I will not suffer him\nto incur the smallest risk without my sharing it.”",
        "During July the correspondence of M. Bertrand de Molleville with the King\nand Queen was most active.  M. de Marsilly, formerly a lieutenant of the\nCent-Suisses of the Guard, was the bearer of the letters.",
        "     [I received by night only the King’s answer, written with his own\n     hand, in the margin of my letter.  I always sent him back with the\n     day’s letter that to which he had replied the day before, so that my\n     letters and his answers, of which I contented myself with taking\n     notes only, never remained with me twenty-four hours.  I proposed\n     this arrangement to his Majesty to remove all uneasiness from his\n     mind; my letters were generally delivered to the King or the Queen\n     by M. de Marsilly, captain of the King’s Guard, whose attachment and\n     fidelity were known to their Majesties.  I also sometimes employed\n     M. Bernard de Marigny, who had left Brest for the purpose of sharing\n     with his Majesty’s faithful servants the dangers which threatened\n     the King.–\"Memoirs of Bertrand de Molleville,” vol.  ii., p.  12.]",
        "He came to me the first time with a note from the Queen directed to M.\nBertrand himself.  In this note the Queen said: “Address yourself with\nfull confidence to Madame Campan; the conduct of her brother in Russia\nhas not at all influenced her sentiments; she is wholly devoted to us;\nand if, hereafter, you should have anything to say to us verbally, you\nmay rely entirely upon her devotion and discretion.”",
        "The mobs which gathered almost nightly in the faubourgs alarmed the\nQueen’s friends; they entreated her not to sleep in her room on the\nground floor of the Tuileries.  She removed to the first floor, to a room\nwhich was between the King’s apartments and those of the Dauphin.  Being\nawake always from daybreak, she ordered that neither the shutters nor the\nwindow-blinds should be closed, that her long sleepless nights might be\nthe less weary.  About the middle of one of these nights, when the moon\nwas shining into her bedchamber, she gazed at it, and told me that in a\nmonth she should not see that moon unless freed from her chains, and\nbeholding the King at liberty.  She then imparted to me all that was\nconcurring to deliver them; but said that the opinions of their intimate\nadvisers were alarmingly at variance; that some vouched for complete\nsuccess, while others pointed out insurmountable dangers.  She added that\nshe possessed the itinerary of the march of the Princes and the King of\nPrussia: that on such a day they would be at Verdun, on another day at\nsuch a place, that Lille was about to be besieged, but that M. de J––-,\nwhose prudence and intelligence the King, as well as herself, highly\nvalued, alarmed them much respecting the success of that siege, and made\nthem apprehensive that, even were the commandant devoted to them, the\ncivil authority, which by the constitution gave great power to the mayors\nof towns, would overrule the military commandant.  She was also very\nuneasy as to what would take place at Paris during the interval, and\nspoke to me of the King’s want of energy, but always in terms expressive\nof her veneration for his virtues and her attachment to himself.–\n\"The King,” said she, “is not a coward; he possesses abundance of passive\ncourage, but he is overwhelmed by an awkward shyness, a mistrust of\nhimself, which proceeds from his education as much as from his\ndisposition.  He is afraid to command, and, above all things, dreads\nspeaking to assembled numbers.  He lived like a child, and always ill at\nease under the eyes of Louis XV., until the age of twenty-one.  This\nconstraint confirmed his timidity.",
        "“Circumstanced as we are, a few well-delivered words addressed to the\nParisians, who are devoted to him, would multiply the strength of our\nparty a hundredfold: he will not utter them.  What can we expect from\nthose addresses to the people which he has been advised to post up?\nNothing but fresh outrages.  As for myself, I could do anything, and\nwould appear on horseback if necessary.  But if I were really to begin to\nact, that would be furnishing arms to the King’s enemies; the cry against\nthe Austrian, and against the sway of a woman, would become general in\nFrance; and, moreover, by showing myself, I should render the King a mere\nnothing.  A queen who is not regent ought, under these circumstances, to\nremain passive and prepare to die.”",
        "The garden of the Tuileries was full of maddened men, who insulted all\nwho seemed to side with the Court.  “The Life of Marie Antoinette” was\ncried under the Queen’s windows, infamous plates were annexed to the\nbook, the hawkers showed them to the passersby.  On all sides were heard\nthe jubilant outcries of a people in a state of delirium almost as\nfrightful as the explosion of their rage.  The Queen and her children\nwere unable to breathe the open air any longer.  It was determined that\nthe garden of the Tuileries should be closed: as soon as this step was\ntaken the Assembly decreed that the whole length of the Terrace des\nFeuillans belonged to it, and fixed the boundary between what was called\nthe national ground and the Coblentz ground by a tricoloured ribbon\nstretched from one end of the terrace to the other.  All good citizens\nwere ordered, by notices affixed to it, not to go down into the garden,\nunder pain of being treated in the same manner as Foulon and Berthier.\nA young man who did not observe this written order went down into the\ngarden; furious outcries, threats of la lanterne, and the crowd of people\nwhich collected upon the terrace warned him of his imprudence, and the\ndanger which he ran.  He immediately pulled off his shoes, took out his\nhandkerchief, and wiped the dust from their soles.  The people cried out,\n\"Bravo!  the good citizen for ever!”  He was carried off in triumph.  The\nshutting up of the Tuileries did not enable the Queen and her children to\nwalk in the garden.  The people on the terrace sent forth dreadful\nshouts, and she was twice compelled to return to her apartments.",
        "In the early part of August many zealous persons offered the King money;\nhe refused considerable sums, being unwilling to injure the fortunes of\nindividuals.  M. de la Ferte, intendant of the ’menus plaisirs’, brought\nme a thousand louis, requesting me to lay them at the feet of the Queen.\nHe thought she could not have too much money at so perilous a time, and\nthat every good Frenchman should hasten to place all his ready money in\nher hands.  She refused this sum, and others of much greater amount which\nwere offered to her.",
        "     [M. Auguie, my brother-in-law, receiver-general of the finances,\n     offered her, through his wife, a portfolio containing one hundred\n     thousand crowns in paper money.  On this occasion the Queen said the\n     most affecting things to my sister, expressive of her happiness at\n     having contributed to the fortunes of such faithful subjects as\n     herself and her husband, but declined her offer.–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "However, a few days afterwards, she told me she would accept M. de la\nFerte’s twenty-four thousand francs, because they would make up a sum\nwhich the King had to expend.  She therefore directed, me to go and\nreceive those twenty-four thousand francs, to add them to the one hundred\nthousand francs she had placed in my hands, and to change the whole into\nassignats to increase their amount.  Her orders were executed, and the\nassignats were delivered to the King.  The Queen informed me that Madame\nElisabeth had found a well-meaning man who had engaged to gain over\nPetion by the bribe of a large sum of money, and that deputy would, by a\npreconcerted signal, inform the King of the success of the project.  His\nMajesty soon had an opportunity of seeing Petion, and on the Queen asking\nhim before me if he was satisfied with him, the King replied, “Neither\nmore nor less satisfied than usual; he did not make the concerted signal,\nand I believe I have been cheated.”  The Queen then condescended to\nexplain the whole of the enigma to me.  “Petion,” said she, “was, while\ntalking to the King, to have kept his finger fixed upon his right eye for\nat least two seconds.\"–\"He did not even put his hand up to his chin,\"\nsaid the King; “after all, it is but so much money stolen: the thief will\nnot boast of it, and the affair will remain a secret.  Let us talk of\nsomething else.”  He turned to me and said, “Your father was an intimate\nfriend of Mandat, who now commands the National Guard; describe him to\nme; what ought I to expect from him?”  I answered that he was one of his\nMajesty’s most faithful subjects, but that with a great deal of loyalty\nhe possessed very little sense, and that he was involved in the\nconstitutional vortex.  “I understand,” said the King; “he is a man who\nwould defend my palace and my person, because that is enjoined by the\nconstitution which he has sworn to support, but who would fight against\nthe party in favour of sovereign authority; it is well to know this with\ncertainty.”",
        "On the next day the Princesse de Lamballe sent for me very early in the\nmorning.  I found her on a sofa facing a window that looked upon the Pont\nRoyal.  She then occupied that apartment of the Pavilion of Flora which\nwas on a level with that of the Queen.  She desired me to sit down by\nher.  Her Highness had a writing-desk upon her knees.  “You have had many\nenemies,” said she; “attempts have been made to deprive you of the\nQueen’s favour; they have been far from successful.  Do you know that\neven I myself, not being so well acquainted with you as the Queen, was\nrendered suspicious of you; and that upon the arrival of the Court at the\nTuileries I gave you a companion to be a spy upon you; and that I had\nanother belonging to the police placed at your door!  I was assured that\nyou received five or six of the most virulent deputies of the Tiers Etat;\nbut it was that wardrobe woman whose rooms were above you.",
        "“In short,” said the Princess, “persons of integrity have nothing to fear\nfrom the evil-disposed when they belong to so upright a prince as the\nKing.  As to the Queen, she knows you, and has loved you ever since\nshe came into France.  You shall judge of the King’s opinion of you: it\nwas yesterday evening decided in the family circle that, at a time when\nthe Tuileries is likely to be attacked, it was necessary to have the most\nfaithful account of the opinions and conduct of all the individuals\ncomposing the Queen’s service.  The King takes the same precaution on his\npart respecting all who are about him.  He said there was with him a\nperson of great integrity, to whom he would commit this inquiry; and\nthat, with regard to the Queen’s household, you must be spoken to, that\nhe had long studied your character, and that he esteemed your veracity.”",
        "The Princess had a list of the names of all who belonged to the Queen’s\nchamber on her desk.  She asked me for information respecting each\nindividual.  I was fortunate in having none but the most favourable\ninformation to give.  I had to speak of my avowed enemy in the Queen’s\nchamber; of her who most wished that I should be responsible for my\nbrother’s political opinions.  The Princess, as the head of the chamber,\ncould not be ignorant of this circumstance; but as the person in\nquestion, who idolised the King and Queen, would not have hesitated to\nsacrifice her life in order to save theirs, and as possibly her\nattachment to them, united to considerable narrowness of intellect and a\nlimited education, contributed to her jealousy of me, I spoke of her in\nthe highest terms.",
        "The Princess wrote as I dictated, and occasionally looked at me with\nastonishment.  When I had done I entreated her to write in the margin\nthat the lady alluded to was my declared enemy.  She embraced me, saying,\n\"Ah! do not write it!  we should not record an unhappy circumstance which\nought to be forgotten.”  We came to a man of genius who was much attached\nto the Queen, and I described him as a man born solely to contradict,\nshowing himself an aristocrat with democrats, and a democrat among\naristocrats; but still a man of probity, and well disposed to his\nsovereign.  The Princess said she knew many persons of that disposition,\nand that she was delighted I had nothing to say against this man, because\nshe herself had placed him about the Queen.",
        "The whole of her Majesty’s chamber, which consisted entirely of persons\nof fidelity, gave throughout all the dreadful convulsions of the\nRevolution proofs of the greatest prudence and self-devotion.  The same\ncannot be said of the antechambers.  With the exception of three or four,\nall the servants of that class were outrageous Jacobins; and I saw on\nthose occasions the necessity of composing the private household of\nprinces of persons completely separated from the class of the people.",
        "The situation of the royal family was so unbearable during the months\nwhich immediately preceded the 10th of August that the Queen longed for\nthe crisis, whatever might be its issue.  She frequently said that a long\nconfinement in a tower by the seaside would seem to her less intolerable\nthan those feuds in which the weakness of her party daily threatened an\ninevitable catastrophe.",
        "     [A few days before the 10th of August the squabbles between the\n     royalists and the Jacobins, and between the Jacobins and the\n     constitutionalists, increased in warmth; among the latter those men\n     who defended the principles they professed with the greatest talent,\n     courage, and constancy were at the same time the most exposed to\n     danger.  Montjoie says: “The question of dethronement was discussed\n     with a degree of frenzy in the Assembly.  Such of the deputies as\n     voted against it were abused, ill treated, and surrounded by\n     assassins.  They had a battle to fight at every step they took; and\n     at length they did not dare to sleep in their own houses.  Of this\n     number were Regnault de Beaucaron, Froudiere, Girardin, and\n     Vaublanc.  Girardin complained of having been struck in one of the\n     lobbies of the Assembly.  A voice cried out to him, ’Say where were\n     you struck.’  ’Where?’ replied Girardin, ’what a question!  Behind.\n     Do assassins ever strike otherwise?\"]",
        "Not only were their Majesties prevented from breathing the open air, but\nthey were also insulted at the very foot of the altar.  The Sunday before\nthe last day of the monarchy, while the royal family went through the\ngallery to the chapel, half the soldiers of the National Guard exclaimed,\n\"Long live the King!” and the other half, “No; no King!  Down with the\nveto!” and on that day at vespers the choristers preconcerted to use loud\nand threatening emphasis when chanting the words, “Deposuit potentes de\nsede,” in the “Magnificat.”  Incensed at such an irreverent proceeding,\nthe royalists in their turn thrice exclaimed, “Et reginam,” after the\n\"Domine salvum fac regem.”  The tumult during the whole time of divine\nservice was excessive.",
        "At length the terrible night of the 10th of August, 1792, arrived.  On\nthe preceding evening Potion went to the Assembly and informed it that\npreparations were making for an insurrection on the following day; that\nthe tocsin would sound at midnight; and that he feared he had not\nsufficient means for resisting the attack which was about to take place.\nUpon this information the Assembly passed to the order of the day.\nPetion, however, gave an order for repelling force by force.",
        "     [Petion was the Mayor of Paris, and Mandat on this day was\n     commandant of the National Guard.  Mandat was assassinated that\n     night.–\"Thiers,” vol. i., p. 260.]",
        "M. Mandat was armed with this order; and, finding his fidelity to the\nKing’s person supported by what he considered the law of the State, he\nconducted himself in all his operations with the greatest energy.  On the\nevening of the 9th I was present at the King’s supper.  While his Majesty\nwas giving me various orders we heard a great noise at the door of the\napartment.  I went to see what was the cause of it, and found the two\nsentinels fighting.  One said, speaking of the King, that he was hearty\nin the cause of the constitution, and would defend it at the peril of his\nlife; the other maintained that he was an encumbrance to the only\nconstitution suitable to a free people.  They were almost ready to cut\none another’s throats.  I returned with a countenance which betrayed my\nemotion.  The King desired to know what was going forward at his door; I\ncould not conceal it from him.  The Queen said she was not at all\nsurprised at it, and that more than half the guard belonged to the\nJacobin party.",
        "The tocsin sounded at midnight.  The Swiss were drawn up like walls; and\nin the midst of their soldierlike silence, which formed a striking\ncontrast with the perpetual din of the town guard, the King informed\nM. de J––-, an officer of the staff, of the plan of defence laid down\nby General Viomenil.  M. de J––- said to me, after this private\nconference, “Put your jewels and money into your pockets; our dangers are\nunavoidable; the means of defence are nil; safety might be obtained by\nsome degree of energy in the King, but that is the only virtue in which\nhe is deficient.”",
        "An hour after midnight the Queen and Madame Elisabeth said they would lie\ndown on a sofa in a room in the entresols, the windows of which commanded\nthe courtyard of the Tuileries.",
        "The Queen told me the King had just refused to put on his quilted under-\nwaistcoat; that he had consented to wear it on the 14th of July because\nhe was merely going to a ceremony where the blade of an assassin was to\nbe apprehended, but that on a day on which his party might fight against\nthe revolutionists he thought there was something cowardly in preserving\nhis life by such means.",
        "During this time Madame Elisabeth disengaged herself from some of her\nclothing which encumbered her in order to lie down on the sofa: she took\na cornelian pin out of her cape, and before she laid it down on the table\nshe showed it to me, and desired me to read a motto engraved upon it\nround a stalk of lilies.  The words were, “Oblivion of injuries; pardon\nfor offences.\"–\"I much fear,” added that virtuous Princess, “this maxim\nhas but little influence among our enemies; but it ought not to be less\ndear to us on that account.”",
        "     [The exalted piety of Madame Elisabeth gave to all she said and did\n     a noble character, descriptive of that of her soul.  On the day on\n     which this worthy descendant of Saint Louis was sacrificed, the\n     executioner, in tying her hands behind her, raised up one of the\n     ends of her handkerchief.  Madame Elisabeth, with calmness, and in a\n     voice which seemed not to belong to earth, said to him, “In the name\n     of modesty, cover my bosom.”  I learned this from Madame de Serilly,\n     who was condemned the same day as the Princess, but who obtained a\n     respite at the moment of the execution, Madame de Montmorin, her\n     relation, declaring that her cousin was enceinte.-MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "The Queen desired me to sit down by her; the two Princesses could not\nsleep; they were conversing mournfully upon their situation when a musket\nwas discharged in the courtyard.  They both quitted the sofa, saying,\n\"There is the first shot, unfortunately it will not be the last; let us\ngo up to the King.”  The Queen desired me to follow her; several of her\nwomen went with me.",
        "At four o’clock the Queen came out of the King’s chamber and told us she\nhad no longer any hope; that M. Mandat, who had gone to the Hotel de\nVille to receive further orders, had just been assassinated, and that the\npeople were at that time carrying his head about the streets.  Day came.\nThe King, the Queen, Madame Elisabeth, Madame, and the Dauphin went down\nto pass through the ranks of the sections of the National Guard; the cry\nof “Vive le Roi!” was heard from a few places.  I was at a window on the\ngarden side; I saw some of the gunners quit their posts, go up to the\nKing, and thrust their fists in his face, insulting him by the most\nbrutal language.  Messieurs de Salvert and de Bridges drove them off in a\nspirited manner.  The King was as pale as a corpse.  The royal family\ncame in again.  The Queen told me that all was lost; that the King had\nshown no energy; and that this sort of review had done more harm than\ngood.",
        "I was in the billiard-room with my companions; we placed ourselves upon\nsome high benches.  I then saw M. d’Hervilly with a drawn sword in his\nhand, ordering the usher to open the door to the French noblesse.  Two\nhundred persons entered the room nearest to that in which the family\nwere; others drew up in two lines in the preceding rooms.  I saw a few\npeople belonging to the Court, many others whose features were unknown to\nme, and a few who figured technically without right among what was called\nthe noblesse, but whose self-devotion ennobled them at once.  They were\nall so badly armed that even in that situation the indomitable French\nliveliness indulged in jests.  M. de Saint-Souplet, one of the King’s\nequerries, and a page, carried on their shoulders instead of muskets the\ntongs belonging to the King’s antechamber, which they had broken and\ndivided between them.  Another page, who had a pocket-pistol in his hand,\nstuck the end of it against the back of the person who stood before him,\nand who begged he would be good enough to rest it elsewhere.  A sword and\na pair of pistols were the only arms of those who had had the precaution\nto provide themselves with arms at all.  Meanwhile, the numerous bands\nfrom the faubourgs, armed with pikes and cutlasses, filled the Carrousel\nand the streets adjacent to the Tuileries.  The sanguinary Marseillais\nwere at their head, with cannon pointed against the Chateau.  In this\nemergency the King’s Council sent M. Dejoly, the Minister of Justice, to\nthe Assembly to request they would send the King a deputation which might\nserve as a safeguard to the executive power.  His ruin was resolved on;\nthey passed to the order of the day.  At eight o’clock the department\nrepaired to the Chateau.  The procureur-syndic, seeing that the guard\nwithin was ready to join the assailants, went into the King’s closet and\nrequested to speak to him in private.  The King received him in his\nchamber; the Queen was with him.  There M. Roederer told him that the\nKing, all his family, and the people about them would inevitably perish\nunless his Majesty immediately determined to go to the National Assembly.\nThe Queen at first opposed this advice, but the procureur-syndic told her\nthat she rendered herself responsible for the deaths of the King, her\nchildren, and all who were in the palace.  She no longer objected.  The\nKing then consented to go to the Assembly.  As he set out, he said to the\nminister and persons who surrounded him, “Come, gentlemen, there is\nnothing more to be done here.”",
        "     [\"The King hesitated, the Queen manifested the highest\n     dissatisfaction.  ’What!’ said she,’ are we alone; is there nobody\n     who can act?’–’Yes, Madame, alone; action is useless–resistance is\n     impossible.’ One of the members of the department, M. Gerdrot,\n     insisted on the prompt execution of the proposed measure.  ’Silence,\n     monsieur,’ said the Queen to him; ’silence; you are the only person\n     who ought to be silent here; when the mischief is done, those who\n     did it should not pretend to wish to remedy it.’ .  .  .",
        "     “The King remained mute; nobody spoke.  It was reserved for me to\n     give the last piece of advice.  I had the firmness to say, ’Let us\n     go, and not deliberate; honour commands it, the good of the State\n     requires it.  Let us go to the National Assembly; this step ought to\n     have been taken long ago: ’Let us go,’ said the King, raising his\n     right hand; ’let us start; let us give this last mark of self-\n     devotion, since it is necessary.’  The Queen was persuaded.  Her\n     first anxiety was for the King, the second for her son; the King had\n     none.  ’M. Roederer–gentlemen,’ said the Queen, ’you answer for the\n     person of the King; you answer for that of my son.’–’Madame,’\n     replied M. Roederer, ’we pledge ourselves to die at your side; that\n     is all we can engage for.’\"–MONTJOIE, “History of Marie\n     Antoinette.\"]",
        "The Queen said to me as she left the King’s chamber, “Wait in my\napartments; I will come to you, or I will send for you to go I know not\nwhither.”  She took with her only the Princesse de Lamballe and Madame de\nTourzel.  The Princesse de Tarente and Madame de la Roche-Aymon were\ninconsolable at being left at the Tuileries; they, and all who belonged\nto the chamber, went down into the Queen’s apartments.",
        "We saw the royal family pass between two lines formed by the Swiss\ngrenadiers and those of the battalions of the Petits-Peres and the Filles\nSaint Thomas.  They were so pressed upon by the crowd that during that\nshort passage the Queen was robbed of her watch and purse.  A man of\ngreat height and horrible appearance, one of such as were to be seen at\nthe head of all the insurrections, drew near the Dauphin, whom the Queen\nwas leading by the hand, and took him up in his arms.  The Queen uttered\na scream of terror, and was ready to faint.  The man said to her, “Don’t\nbe frightened, I will do him no harm;” and he gave him back to her at\nthe entrance of the chamber.",
        "I leave to history all the details of that too memorable day, confining\nmyself to recalling a few of the frightful scenes acted in the interior\nof the Tuileries after the King had quitted the palace.",
        "The assailants did not know that the King and his family had betaken\nthemselves to the Assembly; and those who defended the palace from the\naide of the courts were equally ignorant of it.  It is supposed that if\nthey had been aware of the fact the siege would never have taken place.",
        "     [In reading of the events of the 10th of August, 1792, the reader\n     must remember that there was hardly any armed force to resist the\n     mob.  The regiments that had shown signs of being loyal to the King\n     had been removed from Paris by the Assembly.  The Swiss had been\n     deprived of their own artillery, and the Court had sent one of their\n     battalions into Normandy at a time when there was an idea of taking\n     refuge there.  The National Guard were either disloyal or\n     disheartened, and the gunners, especially of that force at the\n     Tuileries, sympathised with the mob.  Thus the King had about 800 or\n     900 Swiss and little more than one battalion of the National Guard.\n     Mandat, one of the six heads of the legions of the National Guard,\n     to whose turn the command fell on that day, was true to his duty,\n     but was sent for to the Hotel de Ville and assassinated.  Still the\n     small force, even after the departure of the King, would have\n     probably beaten off the mob had not the King given the fatal order\n     to the Swiss to cease firing.  (See Thiers’s “Revolution Francaise,\"\n     vol.  i., chap.  xi.) Bonaparte’s opinion of the mob may be judged\n     by his remarks on the 20th June, 1792, when, disgusted at seeing the\n     King appear with the red cap on his head, he exclaimed, “Che\n     coglione!  Why have they let in all that rabble?  Why don’t they\n     sweep off 400 or 500 of them with the cannon?  The rest would then\n     set off.”  (\"Bourrienne,” vol. i., p.13, Bentley, London, 1836.)\n     Bonaparte carried out his own plan against a far stronger force of\n     assailants on the Jour des Sections, 4th October, 1795.]",
        "The Marseillais began by driving from their posts several Swiss, who\nyielded without resistance; a few of the assailants fired upon them; some\nof the Swiss officers, seeing their men fall, and perhaps thinking the\nKing was still at the Tuileries, gave the word to a whole battalion to\nfire.  The aggressors were thrown into disorder, and the Carrousel was\ncleared in a moment; but they soon returned, spurred on by rage and\nrevenge.  The Swiss were but eight hundred strong; they fell back into\nthe interior of the Chateau; some of the doors were battered in by the\nguns, others broken through with hatchets; the populace rushed from all\nquarters into the interior of the palace; almost all the Swiss were\nmassacred; the nobles, flying through the gallery which leads to the\nLouvre, were either stabbed or shot, and the bodies thrown out of the\nwindows.",
        "M. Pallas and M. de Marchais, ushers of the King’s chamber, were killed\nin defending the door of the council chamber; many others of the King’s\nservants fell victims to their fidelity.  I mention these two persons in\nparticular because, with their hats pulled over their brows and their\nswords in their hands, they exclaimed, as they defended themselves with\nunavailing courage, “We will not survive!–this is our post; our duty is\nto die at it.”  M. Diet behaved in the same manner at the door of the\nQueen’s bedchamber; he experienced the same fate.  The Princesse de\nTarente had fortunately opened the door of the apartments; otherwise, the\ndreadful band seeing several women collected in the Queen’s salon would\nhave fancied she was among us, and would have immediately massacred us\nhad we resisted them.  We were, indeed, all about to perish, when a man\nwith a long beard came up, exclaiming, in the name of Potion, “Spare the\nwomen; don’t dishonour the nation!”  A particular circumstance placed me\nin greater danger than the others.  In my confusion I imagined, a moment\nbefore the assailants entered the Queen’s apartments, that my sister was\nnot among the group of women collected there; and I went up into an\n’entresol’, where I supposed she had taken refuge, to induce her to come\ndown, fancying it safer that we should not be separated.  I did not find\nher in the room in question; I saw there only our two femmes de chambre\nand one of the Queen’s two heyducs, a man of great height and military\naspect.  I saw that he was pale, and sitting on a bed.  I cried out to\nhim, “Fly! the footmen and our people are already safe.\"–\"I cannot,\"\nsaid the man to me; “I am dying of fear.”  As he spoke I heard a number\nof men rushing hastily up the staircase; they threw themselves upon him,\nand I saw him assassinated.",
        "I ran towards the staircase, followed by our women.  The murderers left\nthe heyduc to come to me.  The women threw themselves at their feet, and\nheld their sabres.  The narrowness of the staircase impeded the\nassassins; but I had already felt a horrid hand thrust into my back to\nseize me by my clothes, when some one called out from the bottom of the\nstaircase, “What are you doing above there?  We don’t kill women.”  I was\non my knees; my executioner quitted his hold of me, and said, “Get up,\nyou jade; the nation pardons you.”",
        "The brutality of these words did not prevent my suddenly experiencing an\nindescribable feeling which partook almost equally of the love of life\nand the idea that I was going to see my son, and all that was dear to me,\nagain.  A moment before I had thought less of death than of the pain\nwhich the steel, suspended over my head, would occasion me.  Death is\nseldom seen so close without striking his blow.  I heard every syllable\nuttered by the assassins, just as if I had been calm.",
        "Five or six men seized me and my companions, and, having made us get up\non benches placed before the windows, ordered us to call out, “The nation\nfor ever!”",
        "I passed over several corpses; I recognised that of the old Vicomte de\nBroves, to whom the Queen had sent me at the beginning of the night to\ndesire him and another old man in her name to go home.  These brave men\ndesired I would tell her Majesty that they had but too strictly obeyed\nthe King’s orders in all circumstances under which they ought to have\nexposed their own lives in order to preserve his; and that for this once\nthey would not obey, though they would cherish the recollection of the\nQueen’s goodness.",
        "Near the grille, on the side next the bridge, the men who conducted me\nasked whither I wished to go.  Upon my inquiring, in my turn, whether\nthey were at liberty to take me wherever I might wish to go, one of them,\na Marseillais, asked me, giving me at the same time a push with the butt\nend of his musket, whether I still doubted the power of the people?  I\nanswered “No,” and I mentioned the number of my brother-in-law’s house.\nI saw my sister ascending the steps of the parapet of the bridge,\nsurrounded by members of the National Guard.  I called to her, and she\nturned round.  “Would you have her go with you?” said my guardian to me.\nI told him I did wish it.  They called the people who were leading my\nsister to prison; she joined me.",
        "Madame de la Roche-Aymon and her daughter, Mademoiselle Pauline de\nTourzel, Madame de Ginestoux, lady to the Princesse de Lamballe, the\nother women of the Queen, and the old Comte d’Affry, were led off\ntogether to the Abbaye.",
        "Our progress from the Tuileries to my sister’s house was most\ndistressing.  We saw several Swiss pursued and killed, and musket-shots\nwere crossing each other in all directions.  We passed under the walls of\nthe Louvre; they were firing from the parapet into the windows of the\ngallery, to hit the knights of the dagger; for thus did the populace\ndesignate those faithful subjects who had assembled at the Tuileries to\ndefend the King.",
        "The brigands broke some vessels of water in the Queen’s first\nantechamber; the mixture of blood and water stained the skirts of our\nwhite gowns.  The poissardes screamed after us in the streets that we\nwere attached to the Austrian.  Our protectors then showed some\nconsideration for us, and made us go up a gateway to pull off our gowns;\nbut our petticoats being too short, and making us look like persons in\ndisguise, other poissardes began to bawl out that we were young Swiss\ndressed up like women.  We then saw a tribe of female cannibals enter the\nstreet, carrying the head of poor Mandat.  Our guards made us hastily\nenter a little public-house, called for wine, and desired us to drink\nwith them.  They assured the landlady that we were their sisters, and\ngood patriots.  Happily the Marseillais had quitted us to return to the\nTuileries.  One of the men who remained with us said to me in a low\nvoice: “I am a gauze-worker in the faubourg.  I was forced to march; I am\nnot for all this; I have not killed anybody, and have rescued you.  You\nran a great risk when we met the mad women who are carrying Mandat’s\nhead.  These horrible women said yesterday at midnight, upon the site of\nthe Bastille, that they must have their revenge for the 6th of October,\nat Versailles, and that they had sworn to kill the Queen and all the\nwomen attached to her; the danger of the action saved you all.”",
        "As I crossed the Carrousel, I saw my house in flames; but as soon as the\nfirst moment of affright was over, I thought no more of my personal\nmisfortunes.  My ideas turned solely upon the dreadful situation of the\nQueen.",
        "On reaching my sister’s we found all our family in despair, believing\nthey should never see us again.  I could not remain in her house; some of\nthe mob, collected round the door, exclaimed that Marie Antoinette’s\nconfidante was in the house, and that they must have her head.  I\ndisguised myself, and was concealed in the house of M. Morel, secretary\nfor the lotteries.  On the morrow I was inquired for there, in the name\nof the Queen.  A deputy, whose sentiments were known to her, took upon\nhimself to find me out.",
        "I borrowed clothes, and went with my sister to the Feuillans–[A former\nmonastery near the Tuileries, so called from the Bernardines, one of the\nCistercian orders; later a revolutionary club.]–We got there at the\nsame time with M. Thierry de Ville d’Avray, the King’s first valet de\nchambre.  We were taken into an office, where we wrote down our names and\nplaces of abode, and we received tickets for admission into the rooms\nbelonging to Camus, the keeper of the Archives, where the King was with\nhis family.",
        "As we entered the first room, a person who was there said to me, “Ah!\nyou are a brave woman; but where is that Thierry,",

        "that man loaded with his master’s bounties?\"–\"He is here,” said I; “he\nis following me.  I perceive that even scenes of death do not banish\njealousy from among you.”",
        "Having belonged to the Court from my earliest youth, I was known to many\npersons whom I did not know.  As I traversed a corridor above the\ncloisters which led to the cells inhabited by the unfortunate Louis XVI.\nand his family, several of the grenadiers called me by name.  One of them\nsaid to me, “Well, the poor King is lost!  The Comte d’Artois would have\nmanaged it better.\"–\"Not at all,” said another.",
        "The royal family occupied a small suite of apartments consisting of four\ncells, formerly belonging to the ancient monastery of the Feuillans.  In\nthe first were the men who had accompanied the King: the Prince de Poix,\nthe Baron d’Aubier, M. de Saint-Pardou, equerry to Madame Elisabeth, MM.\nde Goguelat, de Chamilly, and de Hue.  In the second we found the King;\nhe was having his hair dressed; he took two locks of it, and gave one to\nmy sister and one to me.  We offered to kiss his hand; he opposed it, and\nembraced us without saying anything.  In the third was the Queen, in bed,\nand in indescribable affliction.  We found her accompanied only by a\nstout woman, who appeared tolerably civil; she was the keeper of the\napartments.  She waited upon the Queen, who as yet had none of her own\npeople about her.  Her Majesty stretched out her arms to us, saying,\n\"Come, unfortunate women; come, and see one still more unhappy than\nyourselves, since she has been the cause of all your misfortunes.  We are\nruined,” continued she; “we have arrived at that point to which they have\nbeen leading us for three years, through all possible outrages; we shall\nfall in this dreadful revolution, and many others will perish after us.\nAll have contributed to our downfall; the reformers have urged it like\nmad people, and others through ambition, for the wildest Jacobin seeks\nwealth and office, and the mob is eager for plunder.  There is not one\nreal patriot among all this infamous horde.  The emigrant party have\ntheir intrigues and schemes; foreigners seek to profit by the dissensions\nof France; every one has a share in our misfortunes.”",
        "The Dauphin came in with Madame and the Marquise de Tourzel.  On seeing\nthem the Queen said to me, “Poor children!  how heartrending it is,\ninstead of handing down to them so fine an inheritance, to say it ends\nwith us!”  She afterwards conversed with me about the Tuileries and the\npersons who had fallen; she condescended also to mention the burning of\nmy house.  I looked upon that loss as a mischance which ought not to\ndwell upon her mind, and I told her so.  She spoke of the Princesse de\nTarente, whom she greatly loved and valued, of Madame de la Roche-Aymon\nand her daughter, of the other persons whom she had left at the palace,\nand of the Duchesse de Luynes, who was to have passed the night at the\nTuileries.  Respecting her she said, “Hers was one of the first heads\nturned by the rage for that mischievous philosophy; but her heart brought\nher back, and I again found a friend in her.”",
        "     [During the Reign of Terror I withdrew to the Chateau de Coubertin,\n     near that of Dampierre.  The Duchesse de Luynes frequently came to\n     ask me to tell her what the Queen had said about her at the\n     Feuillans.  She would say as she went away, “I have often need to\n     request you to repeat those words of the Queen.\"–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "I asked the Queen what the ambassadors from foreign powers had done under\nexisting circumstances.  She told me that they could do nothing; and that\nthe wife of the English ambassador had just given her a proof of the\npersonal interest she took in her welfare by sending her linen for her\nson.",
        "I informed her that, in the pillaging of my house, all my accounts with\nher had been thrown into the Carrousel, and that every sheet of my\nmonth’s expenditure was signed by her, sometimes leaving four or five\ninches of blank paper above her signature, a circumstance which rendered\nme very uneasy, from an apprehension that an improper use might be made\nof those signatures.  She desired me to demand admission to the committee\nof general safety, and to make this declaration there.  I repaired\nthither instantly and found a deputy, with whose name I have never become\nacquainted.  After hearing me he said that he would not receive my\ndeposition; that Marie Antoinette was now nothing more than any other\nFrenchwoman; and that if any of those detached papers bearing her\nsignature should be misapplied, she would have, at a future period, a\nright to lodge a complaint, and to support her declaration by the facts\nwhich I had just related.  The Queen then regretted having sent me, and\nfeared that she had, by her very caution, pointed out a method of\nfabricating forgeries which might be dangerous to her; then again she\nexclaimed, “My apprehensions are as absurd as the step I made you take.\nThey need nothing more for our ruin; all has been told.”",
        "She gave us details of what had taken place subsequently to the King’s\narrival at the Assembly.  They are all well known, and I have no occasion\nto record them; I will merely mention that she told us, though with much\ndelicacy, that she was not a little hurt at the King’s conduct since he\nhad quitted the Tuileries; that his habit of laying no restraint upon his\ngreat appetite had prompted him to eat as if he had been at his palace;\nthat those who did not know him as she did, did not feel the piety and\nthe magnanimity of his resignation, all which produced so bad an effect\nthat deputies who were devoted to him had warned him of it; but no change\ncould be effected.",
        "I still see in imagination, and shall always see, that narrow cell at the\nFeuillans, hung with green paper, that wretched couch whence the\ndethroned, Queen stretched out her arms to us, saying that our\nmisfortunes, of which she was the cause, increased her own.  There, for\nthe last time, I saw the tears, I heard the sobs of her whom high birth,\nnatural endowments, and, above all, goodness of heart, had seemed to\ndestine to adorn any throne, and be the happiness of any people!  It is\nimpossible for those who lived with Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette not\nto be fully convinced, while doing full justice to the King’s virtues,\nthat if the Queen had been from the moment of her arrival in France the\nobject of the care and affection of a prince of decision and authority,\nshe would have only added to the glory of his reign.",
        "What affecting things I have heard the Queen say in the affliction caused\nher by the belief of part of the Court and the whole of the people that\nshe did not love France!  How did that opinion shock those who knew her\nheart and her sentiments!  Twice did I see her on the point of going from\nher apartments in the Tuileries into the gardens, to address the immense\nthrong constantly assembled there to insult her.  “Yes,” exclaimed she,\nas she paced her chamber with hurried steps, “I will say to them\nFrenchmen, they have had the cruelty to persuade you that I do not love\nFrance!–I! the mother of a Dauphin who will reign over this noble\ncountry!–I! whom Providence has seated upon the most powerful throne of\nEurope!  Of all the daughters of Maria Theresa am I not that one whom\nfortune has most highly favoured?  And ought I not to feel all these\nadvantages?  What should I find at Vienna?  Nothing but sepulchres!  What\nshould I lose in France?  Everything which can confer glory!”",
        "I protest I only repeat her own words; the soundness of her judgment soon\npointed out to her the dangers of such a proceeding.  “I should descend\nfrom the throne,” said she, “merely, perhaps, to excite a momentary\nsympathy, which the factious would soon render more injurious than\nbeneficial to me.”",
        "Yes, not only did Marie Antoinette love France, but few women took\ngreater pride in the courage of Frenchmen.  I could adduce a multitude of\nproofs of this; I will relate two traits which demonstrate the noblest\nenthusiasm: The Queen was telling me that, at the coronation of the\nEmperor Francis II., that Prince, bespeaking the admiration of a French\ngeneral officer, who was then an emigrant, for the fine appearance of his\ntroops, said to him, “There are the men to beat your sans culottes!\"\n\"That remains to be seen, Sire,” instantly replied the officer.  The\nQueen added, “I don’t know the name of that brave Frenchman, but I will\nlearn it; the King ought to be in possession of it.”  As she was reading\nthe public papers a few days before the 10th of August, she observed that\nmention was made of the courage of a young man who died in defending the\nflag he carried, and shouting, “Vive la Nation!\"–\"Ah! the fine lad!\"\nsaid the Queen; “what a happiness it would have been for us if such men\nhad never left off crying, ’Vive de Roi!’”",
        "In all that I have hitherto said of this most unfortunate of women and of\nqueens, those who did not live with her, those who knew her but\npartially, and especially the majority of foreigners, prejudiced by\ninfamous libels, may imagine I have thought it my duty to sacrifice truth\non the altar of gratitude.  Fortunately I can invoke unexceptionable\nwitnesses; they will declare whether what I assert that I have seen and\nheard appears to them either untrue or improbable.",
        "The Queen having been robbed of her purse as she was passing from the\nTuileries to the Feuillans, requested my sister to lend her twenty-five\nlouis.",
        "     [On being interrogated the Queen declared that these five and twenty\n     louis had been lent to her by my sister; this formed a pretence for\n     arresting her and me, and led to her death.–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "I spent part of the day at the Feuillans, and her Majesty told me she\nwould ask Potion to let me be with her in the place which the Assembly\nshould decree for her prison.  I then returned home to prepare everything\nthat might be necessary for me to accompany her.",
        "On the same day (11th August), at nine in the evening, I returned to the\nFeuillans.  I found there were orders at all the gates forbidding my\nbeing admitted.  I claimed a right to enter by virtue of the first\npermission which had been given to me; I was again refused.  I was told\nthat the Queen had as many people as were requisite about her.  My sister\nwas with her, as well as one of my companions, who came out of the\nprisons of the Abbaye on the 11th.  I renewed my solicitations on the\n12th; my tears and entreaties moved neither the keepers of the gates, nor\neven a deputy, to whom I addressed myself.",
        "I soon heard of the removal of Louis XVI. and his family to the Temple.\nI went to Potion accompanied by M. Valadon, for whom I had procured a\nplace in the post-office, and who was devoted to me.  He determined to go\nup to Potion alone; he told him that those who requested to be confined\ncould not be suspected of evil designs, and that no political opinion\ncould afford a ground of objection to these solicitations.  Seeing that\nthe well-meaning man did not succeed, I thought to do more in person; but\nPetion persisted in his refusal, and threatened to send me to La Force.\nThinking to give me a kind of consolation, he added I might be certain\nthat all those who were then with Louis XVI. and his family would not\nstay with them long.  And in fact, two or three days afterwards the\nPrincesse de Lamballe, Madame de Tourzel, her daughter, the Queen’s first\nwoman, the first woman of the Dauphin and of Madame, M. de Chamilly, and\nM. de Hue were carried off during the night and transferred to La Force.\nAfter the departure of the King and Queen for the Temple, my sister was\ndetained a prisoner in the apartments their Majesties had quitted for\ntwenty-four hours.",
        "From this time I was reduced to the misery of having no further\nintelligence of my august and unfortunate mistress but through the medium\nof the newspapers or the National Guard, who did duty at the Temple.",
        "The King and Queen said nothing to me at the Feuillans about the\nportfolio which had been deposited with me; no doubt they expected to see\nme again.  The minister Roland and the deputies composing the provisional\ngovernment were very intent on a search for papers belonging to their\nMajesties.  They had the whole of the Tuileries ransacked.  The infamous\nRobespierre bethought himself of M. Campan, the Queen’s private\nsecretary, and said that his death was feigned; that he was living\nunknown in some obscure part of France, and was doubtless the depositary\nof all the important papers.  In a great portfolio belonging to the King\nthere had been found a solitary letter from the Comte d’Artois, which, by\nits date, and the subjects of which it treated, indicated the existence\nof a continued correspondence.  (This letter appeared among the documents\nused on the trial of Louis XVI.)  A former preceptor of my son’s had\nstudied with Robespierre; the latter, meeting him in the street, and\nknowing the connection which had subsisted between him and the family of\nM. Campan, required him to say, upon his honour, whether he was certain\nof the death of the latter.  The man replied that M. Campan had died at\nLa Briche in 1791, and that he had seen him interred in the cemetery of\nEpinay.  “well, then,” resumed Robespierre, “bring me the certificate of\nhis burial at twelve to-morrow; it is a document for which I have\npressing occasion.”  Upon hearing the deputy’s demand I instantly sent\nfor a certificate of M. Campan’s burial, and Robespierre received it at\nnine o’clock the next morning.  But I considered that, in thinking of my\nfather-in-law, they were coming very near me, the real depositary of\nthese important papers.  I passed days and nights in considering what I\ncould do for the best under such circumstances.",
        "I was thus situated when the order to inform against those who had been\ndenounced as suspected on the 10th of August led to domiciliary visits.\nMy servants were told that the people of the quarter in which I lived\nwere talking much of the search that would be made in my house, and came\nto apprise me of it.  I heard that fifty armed men would make themselves\nmasters of M. Auguies house, where I then was.  I had just received this\nintelligence when M. Gougenot, the King’s maitre d’hotel and receiver-\ngeneral of the taxes, a man much attached to his sovereign, came into my\nroom wrapped in a ridingcloak, under which, with great difficulty, he\ncarried the King’s portfolio, which I had entrusted to him.  He threw it\ndown at my feet, and said to me, “There is your deposit; I did not\nreceive it from our unfortunate King’s own hands; in delivering it to you\nI have executed my trust.”  After saying this he was about to withdraw.\nI stopped him, praying him to consult with me what I ought to do in such\na trying emergency.  He would not listen to my entreaties, or even hear\nme describe the course I intended to pursue.  I told him my abode was\nabout to be surrounded; I imparted to him what the Queen had said to me\nabout the contents of the portfolio.  To all this he answered, “There it\nis; decide for yourself; I will have no hand in it.”  Upon that I\nremained a few seconds thinking, and my conduct was founded upon the\nfollowing reasons.  I spoke aloud, although to myself; I walked about the\nroom with agitated steps; M. Gougenot was thunderstruck.  “Yes,” said I,\n\"when we can no longer communicate with our King and receive his orders,\nhowever attached we may be to him, we can only serve him according to the\nbest of our own judgment.  The Queen said to me, ’This portfolio contains\nscarcely anything but documents of a most dangerous description in the\nevent of a trial taking place, if it should fall into the hands of\nrevolutionary persons.’  She mentioned, too, a single document which\nwould, under the same circumstances, be useful.  It is my duty to\ninterpret her words, and consider them as orders.  She meant to say,\n’You will save such a paper, you will destroy the rest if they are likely\nto be taken from you.’  If it were not so, was there any occasion for her\nto enter into any detail as to what the portfolio contained?  The order\nto keep it was sufficient.  Probably it contains, moreover, the letters\nof that part of the family which has emigrated; there is nothing which\nmay have been foreseen or decided upon that can be useful now; and there\ncan be no political thread which has not been cut by the events of the\n10th of August and the imprisonment of the King.  My house is about to be\nsurrounded; I cannot conceal anything of such bulk; I might, then,\nthrough want of foresight, give up that which would cause the\ncondemnation of the King.  Let us open the portfolio, save the document\nalluded to, and destroy the rest.”  I took a knife and cut open one side\nof the portfolio.  I saw a great number of envelopes endorsed by the\nKing’s own hand.  M. Gougenot found there the former seals of the King,",
        "     [No doubt it was in order to have the ancient seals ready at a\n     moment’s notice, in case of a counter-revolution, that the Queen\n     desired me not to quit the Tuileries.  M. Gougenot threw the seals\n     into the river, one from above the Pont Neuf, and the other from\n     near the Pont Royal.–MADAME CAMPAN.]",
        "such as they were before the Assembly had changed the inscription.  At\nthis moment we heard a great noise; he agreed to tie up the portfolio,\ntake it again under his cloak, and go to a safe place to execute what I\nhad taken upon me to determine.  He made me swear, by all I held most\nsacred, that I would affirm, under every possible emergency, that the\ncourse I was pursuing had not been dictated to me by anybody; and that,\nwhatever might be the result, I would take all the credit or all the\nblame upon myself.  I lifted up my hand and took the oath he required;\nhe went out.  Half an hour afterwards a great number of armed men came to\nmy house; they placed sentinels at all the outlets; they broke open\nsecretaires and closets of which they had not the keys; they ’searched\nthe flower-pots and boxes; they examined the cellars; and the commandant\nrepeatedly said, “Look particularly for papers.”  In the afternoon M.\nGougenot returned.  He had still the seals of France about him, and he\nbrought me a statement of all that he had burnt.",
        "The portfolio contained twenty letters from Monsieur, eighteen or\nnineteen from the Comte d’Artois, seventeen from Madame Adelaide,\neighteen from Madame Victoire, a great many letters from Comte Alexandre\nde Lameth, and many from M. de Malesherbes, with documents annexed to\nthem.  There were also some from M. de Montmorin and other ex-ministers\nor ambassadors.  Each correspondence had its title written in the King’s\nown hand upon the blank paper which contained it.  The most voluminous\nwas that from Mirabeau.  It was tied up with a scheme for an escape,\nwhich he thought necessary.  M. Gougenot, who had skimmed over these\nletters with more attention than the rest, told me they were of so\ninteresting a nature that the King had no doubt kept them as documents\nexceedingly valuable for a history of his reign, and that the\ncorrespondence with the Princes, which was entirely relative to what was\ngoing forward abroad, in concert with the King, would have been fatal to\nhim if it had been seized.  After he had finished he placed in my hands\nthe proces-verbal, signed by all the ministers, to which the King\nattached so much importance, because he had given his opinion against the\ndeclaration of war; a copy of the letter written by the King to the\nPrinces, his brothers, inviting them to return to France; an account of\nthe diamonds which the Queen had sent to Brussels (these two documents\nwere in my handwriting); and a receipt for four hundred thousand francs,\nunder the hand of a celebrated banker.  This sum was part of the eight\nhundred thousand francs which the Queen had gradually saved during her\nreign, out of her pension of three hundred thousand francs per annum, and\nout of the one hundred thousand francs given by way of present on the\nbirth of the Dauphin.",
        "This receipt, written on a very small piece of paper, was in the cover of\nan almanac.  I agreed with M. Gougenot, who was obliged by his office to\nreside in Paris, that he should retain the proces-verbal of the Council\nand the receipt for the four hundred thousand francs, and that we should\nwait either for orders or for the means of transmitting these documents\nto the King or Queen; and I set out for Versailles.",
        "The strictness of the precautions taken to guard the illustrious\nprisoners was daily increased.  The idea that I could not inform the King\nof the course I had adopted of burning his papers, and the fear that I\nshould not be able to transmit to him that which he had pointed out as\nnecessary, tormented me to such a degree that it is wonderful my health\nendured the strain.",
        "The dreadful trial drew near.  Official advocates were granted to the\nKing; the heroic virtue of M. de Malesherbes induced him to brave the\nmost imminent dangers, either to save his master or to perish with him.\nI hoped also to be able to find some means of informing his Majesty of\nwhat I had thought it right to do.  I sent a man, on whom I could rely,\nto Paris, to request M. Gougenot to come to me at Versailles he came\nimmediately.  We agreed that he should see M. de Malesherbes without\navailing himself of any intermediate person for that purpose.",
        "M. Gougenot awaited his return from the Temple at the door of his hotel,\nand made a sign that he wished to speak to him.  A moment afterwards a\nservant came to introduce him into the magistrates’ room.  He imparted to\nM. de Malesherbes what I had thought it right to do with respect to the\nKing’s papers, and placed in his hands the proces-verbal of the Council,\nwhich his Majesty had preserved in order to serve, if occasion required\nit, for a ground of his defence.  However, that paper is not mentioned in\neither of the speeches of his advocate; probably it was determined not to\nmake use of it.",
        "I stop at that terrible period which is marked by the assassination of a\nKing whose virtues are well known; but I cannot refrain from relating\nwhat he deigned to say in my favour to M. de Malesherbes:",
        "“Let Madame Campan know that she did what I should myself have ordered\nher to do; I thank her for it; she is one of those whom I regret I have\nit not in my power to recompense for their fidelity to my person, and for\ntheir good services.”  I did not hear of this until the morning after he\nhad suffered, and I think I should have sunk under my despair if this\nhonourable testimony had not given me some consolation.",
        "MADAME CAMPAN’S narrative breaking off abruptly at the time of the\npainful end met with by her sister, we have supplemented it by abridged\naccounts of the chief incidents in the tragedy which overwhelmed the\nroyal house she so faithfully served, taken from contemporary records and\nthe best historical authorities.",
        "                     The Royal Family in the Temple.",
        "The Assembly having, at the instance of the Commune of Paris, decreed\nthat the royal family should be immured in the Temple, they were removed\nthither from the Feuillans on the 13th of August, 1792, in the charge of\nPotion, Mayor of Paris, and Santerre, the commandant-general.  Twelve\nCommissioners of the general council were to keep constant watch at the\nTemple, which had been fortified by earthworks and garrisoned by\ndetachments of the National Guard, no person being allowed to enter\nwithout permission from the municipality.",
        "The Temple, formerly the headquarters of the Knights Templars in Paris,\nconsisted of two buildings,–the Palace, facing the Rue de Temple,\nusually occupied by one of the Princes of the blood; and the Tower,\nstanding behind the Palace.",
        "     [Clery gives a more minute description of this singular building:\n     “The small tower of the Temple in which the King was then confined\n     stood with its back against the great tower, without any interior\n     communication, and formed a long square, flanked by two turrets.  In\n     one of these turrets there was a narrow staircase that led from the\n     first floor to a gallery on the platform; in the other were small\n     rooms, answering to each story of the tower.  The body of the\n     building was four stories high.  The first consisted of an\n     antechamber, a dining-room, and a small room in the turret, where\n     there was a library containing from twelve to fifteen hundred\n     volumes.  The second story was divided nearly in the same manner.\n     The largest room was the Queen’s bedchamber, in which the Dauphin\n     also slept; the second, which was separated from the Queen’s by a\n     small antechamber almost without light, was occupied by Madame\n     Royale and Madame Elisabeth.  The King’s apartments were on the\n     third story.  He slept in the great room, and made a study of the\n     turret closet.  There was a kitchen separated from the King’s\n     chamber by a small dark room, which had been successively occupied\n     by M. de Chamilly and M. de Hue.  The fourth story was shut up; and\n     on the ground floor there were kitchens of which no use was made.\"\n     –\"Journal,” p. 96.]",
        "The Tower was a square building, with a round tower at each corner and a\nsmall turret on one side, usually called the Tourelle.  In the narrative\nof the Duchesse d’Angouleme she says that the soldiers who escorted the\nroyal prisoners wished to take the King alone to the Tower, and his\nfamily to the Palace of the Temple, but that on the way Manuel received\nan order to imprison them all in the Tower, where so little provision had\nbeen made for their reception that Madame Elisabeth slept in the kitchen.\nThe royal family were accompanied by the Princesse de Lamballe, Madame de\nTourzel and her daughter Pauline, Mesdames de Navarre, de Saint-Brice,\nThibaut, and Bazire, MM. de Hug and de Chamilly, and three men-servants–\nAn order from the Commune soon removed these devoted attendants, and M.\nde Hue alone was permitted to return.  “We all passed the day together,\"\nsays Madame Royale.  “My father taught my brother geography; my mother\nhistory, and to learn verses by heart; and my aunt gave him lessons in\narithmetic.  My father fortunately found a library which amused him, and\nmy mother worked tapestry .  .  .  .  We went every day to walk in the\ngarden, for the sake of my brother’s health, though the King was always\ninsulted by the guard.  On the Feast of Saint Louis ’Ca Ira’ was sung\nunder the walls of the Temple.  Manuel that evening brought my aunt a\nletter from her aunts at Rome.  It was the last the family received from\nwithout.  My father was no longer called King.  He was treated with no\nkind of respect; the officers always sat in his presence and never took\noff their hats.  They deprived him of his sword and searched his pockets\n.  .  .  .  Petion sent as gaoler the horrible man –[Rocher, a saddler\nby trade] who had broken open my father’s door on the 20th June, 1792,\nand who had been near assassinating him.  This man never left the Tower,\nand was indefatigable in endeavouring to torment him.  One time he would\nsing the ’Caramgnole,’ and a thousand other horrors, before us; again,\nknowing that my mother disliked the smoke of tobacco, he would puff it in\nher face, as well as in that of my father, as they happened to pass him.\nHe took care always to be in bed before we went to supper, because he\nknew that we must pass through his room.  My father suffered it all with\ngentleness, forgiving the man from the bottom of his heart.  My mother\nbore it with a dignity that frequently repressed his insolence.\"\nThe only occasion, Madame Royale adds, on which the Queen showed any\nimpatience at the conduct of the officials, was when a municipal officer\nwoke the Dauphin suddenly in the night to make certain that he was safe,\nas though the sight of the peacefully sleeping child would not have been\nin itself the best assurance.",
        "Clery, the valet de chambre of the Dauphin, having with difficulty\nobtained permission to resume his duties, entered the Temple on the 24th\nAugust, and for eight days shared with M. de Hue the personal attendance;\nbut on the 2d September De Hue was arrested, seals were placed on the\nlittle room he had occupied, and Clery passed the night in that of the\nKing.  On the following morning Manuel arrived, charged by the Commune to\ninform the King that De Hue would not be permitted to return, and to\noffer to send another person.  “I thank you,” answered the King.  “I will\nmanage with the valet de chambre of my son; and if the Council refuse I\nwill serve myself.  I am determined to do it.”  On the 3d September\nManual visited the Temple and assured the King that Madame de Lamballe\nand all the other prisoners who had been removed to La Force were well,\nand safely guarded.  “But at three o’clock,” says Madame Royale, “just\nafter dinner, and as the King was sitting down to ’tric trac’ with my\nmother (which he played for the purpose of having an opportunity of saying\na few words to her unheard by the keepers), the most horrid shouts were\nheard.  The officer who happened to be on guard in the room behaved well.\nHe shut the door and the window, and even drew the curtains to prevent\ntheir seeing anything; but outside the workmen and the gaoler Rocher\njoined the assassins and increased the tumult.  Several officers of the\nguard and the municipality now arrived, and on my father’s asking what\nwas the matter, a young officer replied, ’Well, since you will know,\nit is the head of Madame de Lamballe that they want to show you.’\nAt these words my mother was overcome with horror; it was the only\noccasion on which her firmness abandoned her.  The municipal officers\nwere very angry with the young man; but the King, with his usual\ngoodness, excused him, saying that it was his own fault, since he had\nquestioned the officer.  The noise lasted till five o’clock.  We learned\nthat the people had wished to force the door, and that the municipal\nofficers had been enabled to prevent it only by putting a tricoloured\nscarf across it, and allowing six of the murderers to march round our\nprison with the head of the Princess, leaving at the door her body, which\nthey would have dragged in also.”",
        "Clery was not so fortunate as to escape the frightful spectacle.  He had\ngone down to dine with Tison and his wife, employed as servants in the\nTemple, and says: “We were hardly seated when a head, on the end of a\npike, was presented at the window.  Tison’s wife gave a great cry; the\nassassins fancied they recognised the Queen’s voice, and responded by\nsavage laughter.  Under the idea that his Majesty was still at table,\nthey placed their dreadful trophy where it must be seen.  It was the head\nof the Princesse de Lamballe; although bleeding, it was not disfigured,\nand her light hair, still in curls, hung about the pike.”",
        "At length the immense mob that surrounded the Temple gradually withdrew,\n\"to follow the head of the Princess de Lamballe to the Palais Royal.”",
        "     [The pike that bore the head was fixed before the Duc d’Orleans’s\n     window as he was going to dinner.  It is said that he looked at this\n     horrid sight without horror, went into the dining-room, sat down to\n     table, and helped his guests without saying a word.  His silence and\n     coolness left it doubtful whether the assassins, in presenting him\n     this bloody trophy, intended to offer him an insult or to pay him\n     homage.–DE MOLLEVILLE’S “Annals of the French Revolution,” vol.\n     vii., p.  398.]",
        "Meanwhile the royal family could scarcely believe that for the time their\nlives were saved.  “My aunt and I heard the drums beating to arms all\nnight,” says Madame Royale; “my unhappy mother did not even attempt to\nsleep.  We heard her sobs.”",
        "In the comparative tranquillity which followed the September massacres,\nthe royal family resumed the regular habits they had adopted on entering\nthe Temple.  “The King usually rose at six in the morning,” says Clery.\n\"He shaved himself, and I dressed his hair; he then went to his reading-\nroom, which, being very small, the municipal officer on duty remained in\nthe bedchamber with the door open, that he might always keep the King in\nsight.  His Majesty continued praying on his knees for some time, and\nthen read till nine.  During that interval, after putting his chamber to\nrights and preparing the breakfast, I went down to the Queen, who never\nopened her door till I arrived, in order to prevent the municipal officer\nfrom going into her apartment.  At nine o’clock the Queen, the children,\nand Madame Elisabeth went up to the King’s chamber to breakfast.  At ten\nthe King and his family went down to the Queen’s chamber, and there\npassed the day.  He employed himself in educating his son, made him\nrecite passages from Corneille and Racine, gave him lessons in geography,\nand exercised him in colouring the maps.  The Queen, on her part, was\nemployed in the education of her daughter, and these different lessons\nlasted till eleven o’clock.  The remaining time till noon was passed in\nneedlework, knitting, or making tapestry.  At one o’clock, when the\nweather was fine, the royal family were conducted to the garden by four\nmunicipal officers and the commander of a legion of the National Guard.\nAs there were a number of workmen in the Temple employed in pulling down\nhouses and building new walls, they only allowed a part of the chestnut-\ntree walk for the promenade, in which I was allowed to share, and where I\nalso played with the young Prince at ball, quoits, or races.  At two we\nreturned to the Tower, where I served the dinner, at which time Santerre\nregularly came to the Temple, attended by two aides-de-camp.  The King\nsometimes spoke to him,–the Queen never.",
        "“After the meal the royal family came down into the Queen’s room, and\ntheir Majesties generally played a game of piquet or tric-trac.  At four\no’clock the King took a little repose, the Princesses round him, each\nwith a book .  .  .  .  When the King woke the conversation was resumed,\nand I gave writing lessons to his son, taking the copies, according to\nhis instructions, from the works of, Montesquieu and other celebrated\nauthors.  After the lesson I took the young Prince into Madame\nElisabeth’s room, where we played at ball, and battledore and\nshuttlecock.  In the evening the family sat round a table, while the\nQueen read to them from books of history, or other works proper to\ninstruct and amuse the children.  Madame Elisabeth took the book in her\nturn, and in this manner they read till eight o’clock.  After that I\nserved the supper of the young Prince, in which the royal family shared,\nand the King amused the children with charades out of a collection of\nFrench papers which he found in the library.  After the Dauphin had\nsupped, I undressed him, and the Queen heard him say his prayers.  At\nnine the King went to supper, and afterwards went for a moment to the\nQueen’s chamber, shook hands with her and his sister for the night,\nkissed his children, and then retired to the turret-room, where he sat\nreading till midnight.  The Queen and the Princesses locked themselves\nin, and one of the municipal officers remained in the little room which\nparted their chamber, where he passed the night; the other followed his\nMajesty.  In this manner was the time passed as long as the King remained\nin the small tower.”",
        "But even these harmless pursuits were too often made the means of further\ninsulting and thwarting the unfortunate family.  Commissary Le Clerc\ninterrupted the Prince’s writing lessons, proposing to substitute\nRepublican works for those from which the King selected his copies.\nA smith, who was present when the Queen was reading the history of France\nto her children, denounced her to the Commune for choosing the period\nwhen the Connstable de Bourbon took arms against France, and said she\nwished to inspire her son with unpatriotic feelings; a municipal officer\nasserted that the multiplication table the Prince was studying would\nafford a means of “speaking in cipher,” so arithmetic had to be\nabandoned.  Much the same occurred even with the needlework,\nthe Queen and Princess finished some chairbacks, which they wished to\nsend to the Duchesse de Tarente; but the officials considered that the\npatterns were hieroglyphics, intended for carrying on a correspondence,\nand ordered that none of the Princesses work should leave the Temple.\nThe short daily walk in the garden was also embittered by the rude\nbehaviour of the military and municipal gaolers; sometimes, however, it\nafforded an opportunity for marks of sympathy to be shown.  People would\nstation themselves at the windows of houses overlooking the Temple\ngardens, and evince by gestures their loyal affection, and some of the\nsentinels showed, even by tears, that their duty was painful to them.",
        "On the 21st September the National Convention was constituted, Petion\nbeing made president and Collot d’Herbois moving the “abolition of\nroyalty” amidst transports of applause.  That afternoon a municipal\nofficer attended by gendarmes a cheval, and followed by a crowd of\npeople, arrived at the Temple, and, after a flourish of trumpets,\nproclaimed the establishment of the French Republic.  The man, says\nClery, “had the voice of a Stentor.”  The royal family could distinctly\nhear the announcement of the King’s deposition.  “Hebert, so well known\nunder the title of Pere Duchesne, and Destournelles were on guard.  They\nwere sitting near the door, and turned to the King with meaning smiles.\nHe had a book in his hand, and went on reading without changing\ncountenance.  The Queen showed the same firmness.  The proclamation\nfinished, the trumpets sounded afresh.  I went to the window; the people\ntook me for Louis XVI. and I was overwhelmed with insults.”",
        "After the new decree the prisoners were treated with increased harshness.\nPens, paper, ink, and pencils were taken from them.  The King and Madame\nElisabeth gave up all, but the Queen and her daughter each concealed a\npencil.  “In the beginning of October,” says Madame Royale, “after my\nfather had supped, he was told to stop, that he was not to return to his\nformer apartments, and that he was to be separated from his family.  At\nthis dreadful sentence the Queen lost her usual courage.  We parted from\nhim with abundance of tears, though we expected to see him again in the\nmorning.",
        "     [At nine o’clock, says Clery, the King asked to be taken to his\n     family, but the municipal officers replied that they had “no orders\n     for that.”  Shortly afterwards a boy brought the King some bread and\n     a decanter of lemonade for his breakfast.  The King gave half the\n     bread to Clery, saying, “It seems they have forgotten your\n     breakfast; take this, the rest is enough for me.”  Clery refused,\n     but the King insisted.  “I could not contain my tears,” he adds;\n     “the King perceived them, and his own fell also.\"]",
        "They brought in our breakfast separately from his, however.  My mother\nwould take nothing.  The officers, alarmed at her silent and concentrated\nsorrow, allowed us to see the King, but at meal-times only, and on\ncondition that we should not speak low, nor in any foreign language, but\nloud and in ’good French.’  We went down, therefore, with the greatest\njoy to dine with my father.  In the evening, when my brother was in bed,\nmy mother and my aunt alternately sat with him or went with me to sup\nwith my father.  In the morning, after breakfast, we remained in the\nKing’s apartments while Clery dressed our hair, as he was no longer\nallowed to come to my mother’s room, and this arrangement gave us the\npleasure of spending a few moments more with my father.”",
        "     [When the first deputation from the Council of the Commune visited\n     the Temple, and formally inquired whether the King had any complaint\n     to make, he replied, “No; while he was permitted to remain with his\n     family he was happy.\"]",
        "The royal prisoners had no comfort except their affection for each other.\nAt that time even common necessaries were denied them.  Their small stock\nof linen had been lent them; by persons of the Court during the time they\nspent at the Feuillans.  The Princesses mended their clothes every day,\nand after the King had gone to bed Madame Elisabeth mended his.  “With\nmuch trouble,” says Clrry, “I procured some fresh linen for them.  But\nthe workwomen having marked it with crowned letters, the Princesses were\nordered to pick them out.”  The room in the great tower to which the King\nhad been removed contained only one bed, and no other article of\nfurniture.  A chair was brought on which Clery spent the first night;\npainters were still at work on the room, and the smell of the paint, he\nsays, was almost unbearable.  This room was afterwards furnished by\ncollecting from various parts of the Temple a chest of drawers, a small\nbureau, a few odd chairs, a chimney-glass, and a bed hung with green\ndamask, which had been used by the captain of the guard to the Comte\nd’Artois.  A room for the Queen was being prepared over that of the King,\nand she implored the workmen to finish it quickly, but it was not ready\nfor her occupation for some time, and when she was allowed to remove to\nit the Dauphin was taken from her and placed with his father.  When their\nMajesties met again in the great Tower, says Clery, there was little\nchange in the hours fixed for meals, reading, walking and the education\nof their children.  They were not allowed to have mass said in the\nTemple, and therefore commissioned Clery to get them the breviary in use\nin the diocese of Paris.  Among the books read by the King while in the\nTower were Hume’s “History of England” (in the original), Tasso, and the\n\"De Imitatione Christi.”  The jealous suspicions of the municipal\nofficers led to the most absurd investigations; a draught-board was taken\nto pieces lest the squares should hide treasonable papers; macaroons were\nbroken in half to see that they did not contain letters; peaches were cut\nopen and the stones cracked; and Clery was compelled to drink the essence\nof soap prepared for shaving the King, under the pretence that it might\ncontain poison.",
        "In November the King and all the family had feverish colds, and Clery had\nan attack of rheumatic fever.  On the first day of his illness he got up\nand tried to dress his master, but the King, seeing how ill he was,\nordered him to lie down, and himself dressed the Dauphin.  The little\nPrince waited on Clery all day, and in the evening the King contrived to\napproach his bed, and said, in a low voice, “I should like to take care\nof you myself, but you know how we are watched.  Take courage; tomorrow\nyou shall see my doctor.”  Madame Elisabeth brought the valet cooling\ndraughts, of which she deprived herself; and after Clery was able to get\nup, the young Prince one night with great difficulty kept awake till\neleven o’clock in order to give him a box of lozenges when he went to\nmake the King’s bed.",
        "On 7th December a deputation from the Commune brought an order that the\nroyal family should be deprived of “knives, razors, scissors, penknives,\nand all other cutting instruments.”  The King gave up a knife, and took\nfrom a morocco case a pair of scissors and a penknife; and the officials\nthen searched the room, taking away the little toilet implements of gold\nand silver, and afterwards removing the Princesses’ working materials.\nReturning to the King’s room, they insisted upon seeing what remained in\nhis pocket-case.  “Are these toys which I have in my hand also cutting\ninstruments?”  asked the King, showing them a cork-screw, a turn-screw,\nand a steel for lighting.  These also were taken from him.  Shortly\nafterwards Madame Elisabeth was mending the King’s coat, and, having no\nscissors, was compelled to break the thread with her teeth.",
        "“What a contrast!” he exclaimed, looking at her tenderly.  “You wanted\nnothing in your pretty house at Montreuil.”",
        "“Ah, brother,” she answered, “how can I have any regret when I partake\nyour misfortunes?”",
        "The Queen had frequently to take on herself some of the humble duties of\na servant.  This was especially painful to Louis XVI. when the\nanniversary of some State festival brought the contrast between past and\npresent with unusual keenness before him.",
        "“Ah, Madame,” he once exclaimed, “what an employment for a Queen of\nFrance!  Could they see that at Vienna!  Who would have foreseen that,\nin uniting your lot to mine, you would have descended so low?”",
        "“And do you esteem as nothing,” she replied, “the glory of being the wife\nof one of the best and most persecuted of men?  Are not such misfortunes\nthe noblest honours?\"–[Alison’s “History of Europe,” vol. ii., p. 299.]",
        "Meanwhile the Assembly had decided that the King should be brought to\ntrial.  Nearly all parties, except the Girondists, no matter how bitterly\nopposed to each other, could agree in making him the scapegoat; and the\nfirst rumour of the approaching ordeal was conveyed to the Temple by\nClery’s wife, who, with a friend, had permission occasionally to visit\nhim.  “I did not know how to announce this terrible news to the King,” he\nsays; “but time was pressing, and be had forbidden my concealing anything\nfrom him.  In the evening, while undressing him, I gave him an account of\nall I had learnt, and added that there were only four days to concert\nsome plan of corresponding with the Queen.  The arrival of the municipal\nofficer would not allow me to say more.  Next morning, when the King\nrose, I could not get a moment for speaking with him.  He went up with\nhis son to breakfast with the Princesses, and I followed.  After\nbreakfast he talked long with the Queen, who, by a look full of trouble,\nmade me understand that they were discussing what I had told the King.\nDuring the day I found an opportunity of describing to Madame Elisabeth\nhow much it had cost me to augment the King’s distresses by informing him\nof his approaching trial.  She reassured me, saying that the King felt\nthis as a mark of attachment on my part, and added, ’That which most\ntroubles him is the fear of being separated from us.’  In the evening the\nKing told me how satisfied he was at having had warning that he was to\nappear before the Convention.  ’Continue,’ he said, ’to endeavour to find\nout something as to what they want to do with me.  Never fear distressing\nme.  I have agreed with my family not to seem pre-informed, in order not\nto compromise you.’”",
        "On the 11th December, at five o’clock in the morning, the prisoners heard\nthe generale beaten throughout Paris, and cavalry and cannon entered the\nTemple gardens.  At nine the King and the Dauphin went as usual to\nbreakfast with the Queen.  They were allowed to remain together for an\nhour, but constantly under the eyes of their republican guardians.  At\nlast they were obliged to part, doubtful whether they would ever see each\nother again.  The little Prince, who remained with his father, and was\nignorant of the new cause for anxiety, begged hard that the King would\nplay at ninepins with him as usual.  Twice the Dauphin could not get\nbeyond a certain number.  “Each time that I get up to sixteen,” he said,\nwith some vexation, “I lose the game.”  The King did not reply, but Clery\nfancied the words made a painful impression on him.",
        "At eleven, while the King was giving the Dauphin a reading lesson, two\nmunicipal officers entered and said they had come “to take young Louis to\nhis mother.”  The King inquired why, but was only told that such were the\norders of the Council.  At one o’clock the Mayor of Paris, Chambon,\naccompanied by Chaumette, Procureur de la Commune, Santerre, commandant\nof the National Guard, and others, arrived at the Temple and read a\ndecree to the King, which ordered that “Louis Capet” should be brought\nbefore the Convention.  “Capet is not my name,” he replied, “but that of\none of my ancestors.  I could have wished,” he added, “that you had left\nmy son with me during the last two hours.  But this treatment is\nconsistent with all I have experienced here.  I follow you, not because I\nrecognise the authority of the Convention, but because I can be compelled\nto obey it.”  He then followed the Mayor to a carriage which waited, with\na numerous escort, at the gate of the Temple.  The family left behind\nwere overwhelmed with grief and apprehension.  “It is impossible to\ndescribe the anxiety we suffered,” says Madame Royale.  “My mother used\nevery endeavour with the officer who guarded her to discover what was\npassing; it was the first time she had condescended to question any of\nthese men.  He would tell her nothing.”",
        "       Trial of the King.–Parting of the Royal Family.–Execution.",
        "The crowd was immense as, on the morning of the 11th December, 1792,\nLouis XVI. was driven slowly from the Temple to the Convention, escorted\nby cavalry, infantry, and artillery.  Paris looked like an armed camp:\nall the posts were doubled; the muster-roll of the National Guard was\ncalled over every hour; a picket of two hundred men watched in the court\nof each of the right sections; a reserve with cannon was stationed at the\nTuileries, and strong detachments patroled the streets and cleared the\nroad of all loiterers.  The trees that lined the boulevards, the doors\nand windows of the houses, were alive with gazers, and all eyes were\nfixed on the King.  He was much changed since his people last beheld him.\nThe beard he had been compelled to grow after his razors were taken from\nhim covered cheeks, lips, and chin with light-coloured hair, which\nconcealed the melancholy expression of his mouth; he had become thin, and\nhis garments hung loosely on him; but his manner was perfectly collected\nand calm, and he recognised and named to the Mayor the various quarters\nthrough which he passed.  On arriving at the Feuillans he was taken to a\nroom to await the orders of the Assembly.",
        "It was about half-past two when the King appeared at the bar.  The Mayor\nand Generaux Santerre and Wittengoff were at his side.  Profound silence\npervaded the Assembly.  All were touched by the King’s dignity and the\ncomposure of his looks under so great a reverse of fortune.  By nature he\nhad been formed rather to endure calamity with patience than to contend\nagainst it with energy.  The approach of death could not disturb his\nserenity.",
        "“Louis, you may be seated,” said Barere.  “Answer the questions that\nshall be put to you.”  The King seated himself and listened to the\nreading of the ’acte enonciatif’, article by article.  All the faults\nof the Court were there enumerated and imputed to Louis XVI. personally.\nHe was charged with the interruption of the sittings of the 20th of June,\n1789, with the Bed of Justice held on the 23d of the same month, the\naristocratic conspiracy thwarted by the insurrection of the 14th of July,\nthe entertainment of the Life Guards, the insults offered to the national\ncockade, the refusal to sanction the Declaration of Rights, as well as\nseveral constitutional articles; lastly, all the facts which indicated a\nnew conspiracy in October, and which were followed by the scenes of the\n5th and 6th; the speeches of reconciliation which had succeeded all these\nscenes, and which promised a change that was not sincere; the false oath\ntaken at the Federation of the 14th of July; the secret practices of\nTalon and Mirabeau to effect a counter-revolution; the money spent in\nbribing a great number of deputies; the assemblage of the “knights of\nthe dagger” on the 28th of February, 1791; the flight to Varennes; the\nfusilade of the Champ de Mars; the silence observed respecting the Treaty\nof Pilnitz; the delay in the promulgation of the decree which\nincorporated Avignon with France; the commotions at Nimes, Montauban,\nMende, and Jales; the continuance of their pay to the emigrant Life\nGuards and to the disbanded Constitutional Guard; the insufficiency of\nthe armies assembled on the frontiers; the refusal to sanction the decree\nfor the camp of twenty thousand men; the disarming of the fortresses; the\norganisation of secret societies in the interior of Paris; the review of\nthe Swiss and the garrison of the palace on the 10th August; the\nsummoning the Mayor to the Tuileries; and lastly, the effusion of blood\nwhich had resulted from these military dispositions.  After each article\nthe President paused, and said, “What have you to answer?”  The King, in\na firm voice, denied some of the facts, imputed others to his ministers,\nand always appealed to the constitution, from which he declared he had\nnever deviated.  His answers were very temperate, but on the charge, “You\nspilt the blood of the people on the 10th of August,” he exclaimed, with\nemphasis, “No, monsieur, no; it was not I.”",
        "All the papers on which the act of accusation was founded were then shown\nto the King, and he disavowed some of them and disputed the existence of\nthe iron chest; this produced a bad impression, and was worse than\nuseless, as the fact had been proved.",
        "     [A secret closet which the King had directed to be constructed in a\n     wall in the Tuileries.  The door was of iron, whence it was\n     afterwards known by the name of the iron chest.  See Thiers, and\n     Scott.]",
        "Throughout the examination the King showed great presence of mind.\nHe was careful in his answers never to implicate any members of the\nconstituent, and legislative Assemblies; many who then sat as his judges\ntrembled lest he should betray them.  The Jacobins beheld with dismay the\nprofound impression made on the Convention by the firm but mild demeanour\nof the sovereign.  The most violent of the party proposed that he should\nbe hanged that very night; a laugh as of demons followed the proposal\nfrom the benches of the Mountain, but the majority, composed of the\nGirondists and the neutrals, decided that he should be formally tried.",
        "After the examination  Santerre took the King by the arm and led him back\nto the waiting-room of the Convention, accompanied by Chambon and\nChaumette.  Mental agitation and the length of the proceedings had\nexhausted him, and he staggered from weakness.  Chaumette inquired if he\nwished for refreshment, but the King refused it.  A moment after, seeing\na grenadier of the escort offer the Procureur de la Commune half a small\nloaf, Louis XVI. approached and asked him, in a whisper, for a piece.",
        "“Ask aloud for what you want,” said Chaumette, retreating as though he\nfeared being suspected of pity.",
        "“I asked for a piece of your bread,” replied the King.",
        "“Divide it with me,” said Chaumette.  “It is a Spartan breakfast.  If I\nhad a root I would give you half.\"–[Lamartine’s “History of the\nGirondists,” edit.  1870, vol. ii., p. 313.]",
        "Soon after six in the evening the King returned to the Temple.  “He\nseemed tired,” says Clery, simply, “and his first wish was to be led to\nhis family.  The officers refused, on the plea that they had no orders.\nHe insisted that at least they should be informed of his return, and this\nwas promised him.  The King ordered me to ask for his supper at half-past\neight.  The intervening hours he employed in his usual reading,\nsurrounded by four municipals.  When I announced that supper was served,\nthe King asked the commissaries if his family could not come down.  They\nmade no reply.  ’But at least,’ the King said, ’my son will pass the\nnight in my room, his bed being here?’  The same silence.  After supper\nthe King again urged his wish to see his family.  They answered that they\nmust await the decision of the Convention.  While I was undressing him\nthe King said, ’I was far from expecting all the questions they put to\nme.’  He lay down with perfect calmness.  The order for my removal during\nthe night was not executed.”  On the King’s return to the Temple being\nknown, “my mother asked to see him instantly,” writes Madame Royale.\n\"She made the same request even to Chambon, but received no answer.  My\nbrother passed the night with her; and as he had no bed, she gave him\nhers, and sat up all the night in such deep affliction that we were\nafraid to leave her; but she compelled my aunt and me to go to bed.  Next\nday she again asked to see my father, and to read the newspapers, that\nshe might learn the course of the trial.  She entreated that if she was\nto be denied this indulgence, his children, at least, might see him.  Her\nrequests were referred to the Commune.  The newspapers were refused; but\nmy brother and I were to be allowed to see my father on condition of\nbeing entirely separated from my mother.  My father replied that, great\nas his happiness was in seeing his children, the important business which\nthen occupied him would not allow of his attending altogether to his son,\nand that his daughter could not leave her mother.”",
        "     [During their last interview Madame Elisabeth had given Clery one of\n     her handkerchiefs, saying, “You shall keep it so long as my brother\n     continues well; if he becomes ill, send it to me among my nephew’s\n     things.\"]",
        "The Assembly having, after a violent debate, resolved that Louis XVI.\nshould have the aid of counsel, a deputation was sent to the Temple to\nask whom he would choose.  The King named Messieurs Target and Tronchet.\nThe former refused his services on the ground that he had discontinued\npractice since 1785; the latter complied at once with the King’s request;\nand while the Assembly was considering whom to, nominate in Target’s\nplace, the President received a letter from the venerable Malesherbes,",
        "     [Christian Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, an eminent French\n     statesman, son of the Chancellor of France, was born at Paris in\n     1721.  In 1750 he succeeded his father as President of the Court of\n     Aids, and was also made superintendent of the press.  On the\n     banishment of the Parliaments and the suppression of the Court of\n     Aids, Malesherbes was exiled to his country-seat.  In 1775 he was\n     appointed Minister of State.  On the decree of the Convention for\n     the King’s trial, he emerged from his retreat to become the\n     voluntary advocate of his sovereign.  Malesherbes was guillotined in\n     1794, and almost his whole family were extirpated by their merciless\n     persecutors.]",

If I knew any possible means of acquainting him with my\ndesires, I should not take the liberty of addressing myself to you.\"\nOther citizens made similar proposals, but the King, being made\nacquainted with them by a deputation from the Commune, while expressing\nhis gratitude for all the offers, accepted only that of Malesherbes.",

The Assembly passed to the order of the day on\n     this request.–BERTRAND DE MOLLEVILLE, “Annals,” edit.  1802, vol,\n     viii., p. 254.]",
        "On 14th December M. Tronchet was allowed to confer with the King, and\nlater in the same day M. de Malesherbes was admitted to the Tower.  “The\nKing ran up to this worthy old man, whom he clasped in his arms,” said\nClery, “and the former minister melted into tears at the sight of his\nmaster.”",
        "     [According to M. de Hue, “The first time M. de Malesherbes entered\n     the Temple, the King clasped him in his arms and said, ’Ah, is it\n     you, my friend?  You fear not to endanger your own life to save\n     mine; but all will be useless.  They will bring me to the scaffold.\n     No matter; I shall gain my cause if I leave an unspotted memory\n     behind me.’\"]",
        "Another deputation brought the King the Act of Accusation and the\ndocuments relating to it, numbering more than a hundred, and taking from\nfour o’clock till midnight to read.  During this long process the King\nhad refreshments served to the deputies, taking nothing himself till they\nhad left, but considerately reproving Clery for not having supped.  From\nthe 14th to the 26th December the King saw his counsel and their\ncolleague M. de Size every day.  At this time a means of communication\nbetween the royal family and the King was devised: a man named Turgi, who\nhad been in the royal kitchen, and who contrived to obtain employment in\nthe Temple, when conveying the meals of the royal family to their\napartments, or articles he had purchased for them, managed to give Madame\nElisabeth news of the King.  Next day, the Princess, when Turgi was\nremoving the dinner, slipped into his hand a bit of paper on which she\nhad pricked with a pin a request for a word from her brother’s own hand.\nTurgi gave this paper to Clery, who conveyed it to the King the same\nevening; and he, being allowed writing materials while preparing his\ndefence, wrote Madame Elisabeth a short note.  An answer was conveyed in\na ball of cotton, which Turgi threw under Clery’s bed while passing the\ndoor of his room.  Letters were also passed between the Princess’s room\nand that of Clery, who lodged beneath her, by means of a string let down\nand drawn up at night.  This communication with his family was a great\ncomfort to the King, who, nevertheless, constantly cautioned his faithful\nservant.  “Take care,” he would say kindly, “you expose yourself too\nmuch.”",
        "     [The King’s natural benevolence was constantly shown while in the\n     Temple.  His own dreadful position never prevented him from sympathy\n     with the smaller troubles of others.  A servant in the Temple named\n     Marchand, the father of a family, was robbed of two hundred francs,\n     –his wages for two months.  The King observed his distress, asked\n     its cause, and gave Clery the amount to be handed to Marchand, with\n     a caution not to speak of it to any one, and, above all, not to\n     thank the King, lest it should injure him with his employers.]",
        "During his separation from his family the King refused to go into the\ngarden.  When it was proposed to him he said, “I cannot make up my mind\nto go out alone; the walk was agreeable to me only when I shared it with\nmy family.”  But he did not allow himself to dwell on painful\nreflections.  He talked freely to the municipals on guard, and surprised\nthem by his varied and practical knowledge of their trades, and his\ninterest in their domestic affairs.  On the 19th December the King’s\nbreakfast was served as usual; but, being a fast-day, he refused to take\nanything.  At dinner-time the King said to Clery, “Fourteen years ago you\nwere up earlier than you were to-day; it is the day my daughter was born-\n-today, her birthday,” he repeated, with tears, “and to be prevented from\nseeing her!”  Madame Royale had wished for a calendar; the King ordered\nClery to buy her the “Almanac of the Republic,” which had replaced the\n\"Court Almanac,” and ran through it, marking with a pencil many names.",
        "“On Christmas Day,” Says Clery, “the King wrote his will.”",
        "     [Madame Royale says: “On the 26th December, St. Stephen’s Day, my\n     father made his will, because he expected to be assassinated that\n     day on his way to the bar of the Convention.  He went thither,\n     nevertheless, with his usual calmness.\"–\"Royal Memoirs,” p. 196.]",
        "On the 26th December, 1792, the King appeared a second time before the\nConvention.  M. de Seze, labouring night and day, had completed his\ndefence.  The King insisted on excluding from it all that was too\nrhetorical, and confining it to the mere discussion of essential points.",
        "     [When the pathetic peroration of M, de Seze was read to the King,\n     the evening before it was delivered to the Assembly, “I have to\n     request of you,” he said, “to make a painful sacrifice; strike out\n     of your pleading the peroration.  It is enough for me to appear\n     before such judges, and show my entire innocence; I will not move\n     their feelings.–\"LACRETELLE.]",
        "At half-past nine in the morning the whole armed force was in motion to\nconduct him from the Temple to the Feuillans, with the same precautions\nand in the same order as had been observed on the former occasion.\nRiding in the carriage of the Mayor, he conversed, on the way, with the\nsame composure as usual, and talked of Seneca, of Livy, of the hospitals.\nArrived at the Feuillans, he showed great anxiety for his defenders; he\nseated himself beside them in the Assembly, surveyed with great composure\nthe benches where his accusers and his judges sat, seemed to examine\ntheir faces with the view of discovering the impression produced by the\npleading of M. de Seze, and more than once conversed smilingly with\nTronchet and Malesherbes.  The Assembly received his defence in sullen\nsilence, but without any tokens of disapprobation.",
        "Being afterwards conducted to an adjoining room with his counsel, the\nKing showed great anxiety about M. de Seze, who seemed fatigued by the\nlong defence.  While riding back to the Temple he conversed with his\ncompanions with the same serenity as he had shown on leaving it.",
        "No sooner had the King left the hall of the Convention than a violent\ntumult arose there.  Some were for opening the discussion.  Others,\ncomplaining of the delays which postponed the decision of this process,\ndemanded the vote immediately, remarking that in every court, after the\naccused had been heard, the judges proceed to give their opinion.\nLanjuinais had from the commencement of the proceedings felt an\nindignation which his impetuous disposition no longer suffered him to\nrepress.  He darted to the tribune, and, amidst the cries excited by his\npresence, demanded the annulling of the proceedings altogether.\nHe exclaimed that the days of ferocious men were gone by, that the\nAssembly ought not to be so dishonoured as to be made to sit in judgment\non Louis XVI., that no authority in France had that right, and the\nAssembly in particular had no claim to it; that if it resolved to act as\na political body, it could do no more than take measures of safety\nagainst the ci-devant King; but that if it was acting as a court of\njustice it was overstepping all principles, for it was subjecting the\nvanquished to be tried by the conquerors, since most of the present\nmembers had declared themselves the conspirators of the 10th of August.\nAt the word “conspirators” a tremendous uproar arose on all aides.  Cries\nof “Order!\"–\"To the Abbaye!\"–\"Down with the Tribune!” were heard.\nLanjuinais strove in vain to justify the word “conspirators,” saying that\nhe meant it to be taken in a favourable sense, and that the 10th of\nAugust was a glorious conspiracy.  He concluded by declaring that he\nwould rather die a thousand deaths than condemn, contrary to all laws,\neven the most execrable of tyrants.",
        "A great number of speakers followed, and the confusion continually\nincreased.  The members, determined not to hear any more, mingled\ntogether, formed groups, abused and threatened one another.  After a\ntempest of an hour’s duration, tranquillity was at last restored; and the\nAssembly, adopting the opinion of those who demanded the discussion on\nthe trial of Louis XVI., declared that it was opened, and that it should\nbe continued, to the exclusion of all other business, till sentence\nshould be passed.",
        "The discussion was accordingly resumed on the 27th, and there was a\nconstant succession of speakers from the 28th to the 31st.  Vergniaud at\nlength ascended the tribune for the first time, and an extraordinary\neagerness was manifested to hear the Girondists express their sentiments\nby the lips of their greatest orator.",
        "The speech of Vergniaud produced a deep impression on all his hearers.\nRobespierre was thunderstruck by his earnest and, persuasive eloquence.\nVergniaud, however, had but shaken, not convinced, the Assembly, which\nwavered between the two parties.  Several members were successively\nheard, for and against the appeal to the people.  Brissot, Gensonne,\nPetion, supported it in their turn.  One speaker at length had a decisive\ninfluence on the question.  Barere, by his suppleness, and his cold and\nevasive eloquence, was the model and oracle of the centre.  He spoke at\ngreat length on the trial, reviewed it in all its bearings–of facts, of\nlaws, and of policy–and furnished all those weak minds, who only wanted\nspecious reasons for yielding, with motives for the condemnation of the\nKing.  From that moment the unfortunate King was condemned.  The\ndiscussion lasted till the 7th, and nobody would listen any longer to the\ncontinual repetition of the same facts and arguments.  It was therefore\ndeclared to be closed without opposition, but the proposal of a fresh\nadjournment excited a commotion among the most violent, and ended in a\ndecree which fixed the 14th of January for putting the questions to the\nvote.",
        "Meantime the King did not allow the torturing suspense to disturb his\noutward composure, or lessen his kindness to those around him.  On the\nmorning after his second appearance at the bar of the Convention, the\ncommissary Vincent, who had undertaken secretly to convey to the Queen\na copy of the King’s printed defence, asked for something which had\nbelonged to him, to treasure as a relic; the King took off his neck\nhandkerchief and gave it him; his gloves he bestowed on another\nmunicipal, who had made the same request.  “On January 1st,” says Clery,\n\"I approached the King’s bed and asked permission to offer him my warmest\nprayers for the end of his misfortunes.  ’I accept your good wishes with\naffection,’ he replied, extending his hand to me.  As soon as he had\nrisen, he requested a municipal to go and inquire for his family, and\npresent them his good wishes for the new year.  The officers were moved\nby the tone in which these words, so heartrending considering the\nposition of the King, were pronounced .  .  .  .  The correspondence\nbetween their Majesties went on constantly.  The King being informed that\nMadame Royale was ill, was very uneasy for some days.  The Queen, after\nbegging earnestly, obtained permission for M. Brunnier, the medical\nattendant of the royal children, to come to the Temple.  This seemed to\nquiet him.”",
        "The nearer the moment which was to decide the King’s fate approached, the\ngreater became the agitation in, Paris.  “A report was circulated that\nthe atrocities of September were to be repeated there, and the prisoners\nand their relatives beset the deputies with supplications that they would\nsnatch them from destruction.  The Jacobins, on their part, alleged that\nconspiracies were hatching in all quarters to save Louis XVI.  from\npunishment, and to restore royalty.  Their anger, excited by delays and\nobstacles, assumed a more threatening aspect; and the two parties thus\nalarmed one another by supposing that each harboured sinister designs.”",
        "On the 14th of January the Convention called for the order of the day,\nbeing the final judgment of Louis XVI.",
        "“The sitting of the Convention which concluded the trial,” says Hazlitt,\n\"lasted seventy-two hours.  It might naturally be supposed that silence,\nrestraint, a sort of religious awe, would have pervaded the scene.  On\nthe contrary, everything bore the marks of gaiety, dissipation, and the\nmost grotesque confusion.  The farther end of the hall was converted into\nboxes, where ladies, in a studied deshabille, swallowed ices, oranges,\nliqueurs, and received the salutations of the members who went and came,\nas on ordinary occasions.  Here the doorkeepers on the Mountain side\nopened and shut the boxes reserved for the mistresses of the Duc\nd’Orleans; and there, though every sound of approbation or disapprobation\nwas strictly forbidden, you heard the long and indignant ’Ha, ha’s!’ of\nthe mother-duchess, the patroness of the bands of female Jacobins,\nwhenever her ears were not loudly greeted with the welcome sounds of\ndeath.  The upper gallery, reserved for the people, was during the whole\ntrial constantly full of strangers of every description, drinking wine as\nin a tavern.",
        "“Bets were made as to the issue of the trial in all the neighbouring\ncoffee-houses.  Ennui, impatience, disgust sat on almost every\ncountenance.  The figures passing and repassing, rendered more ghastly by\nthe pallid lights, and who in a slow, sepulchral voice pronounced only\nthe word–Death; others calculating if they should have time to go to\ndinner before they gave their verdict; women pricking cards with pins in\norder to count the votes; some of the deputies fallen asleep, and only\nwaking up to give their sentence,–all this had the appearance rather of\na hideous dream than of a reality.”",
        "The Duc d’Orleans, when called on to give his vote for the death of his\nKing and relation, walked with a faltering step, and a face paler than\ndeath itself, to the appointed place, and there read these words:\n\"Exclusively governed by my duty, and convinced that all those who have\nresisted the sovereignty of the people deserve death, my vote is for\ndeath!”  Important as the accession of the first Prince of the blood was\nto the Terrorist faction, his conduct in this instance was too obviously\nselfish and atrocious not to excite a general feeling of indignation; the\nagitation of the Assembly became extreme; it seemed as if by this single\nvote the fate of the monarch was irrevocably sealed.",
        "The President having examined the register, the result of the scrutiny\nwas proclaimed as follows",
        "     Against an appeal to the people........... 480\n     For an appeal to the people............... 283",
        "     Majority for final judgment............... 197",
        "The President having announced that he was about to declare the result of\nthe scrutiny, a profound silence ensued, and he then gave in the\nfollowing declaration: that, out of 719 votes, 366 were for DEATH, 319\nwere for imprisonment during the war, two for perpetual imprisonment,\neight for a suspension of the execution of the sentence of death until\nafter the expulsion of the family of the Bourbons, twenty-three were for\nnot putting him to death until the French territory was invaded by any\nforeign power, and one was for a sentence of death, but with power of\ncommutation of the punishment.",
        "After this enumeration the President took off his hat, and, lowering his\nvoice, said: “In consequence of this expression of opinion I declare that\nthe punishment pronounced by the National Convention against Louis Capet\nis DEATH!”",
        "Previous to the passing of the sentence the President announced on the\npart of the Foreign Minister the receipt of a letter from the Spanish\nMinister relative to that sentence.  The Convention, however, refused to\nhear it.  [It will be remembered that a similar remonstrance was\nforwarded by the English Government.]",
        "M. de Malesherbes, according to his promise to the King, went to the\nTemple at nine o’clock on the morning of the 17th?.",
        "     [Louis was fully prepared for his fate.  During the calling of the\n     votes he asked M. de Malesherbes, “Have you not met near the Temple\n     the White Lady?\"–” What do you mean?” replied he.  “Do you not\n     know,” resumed the King with a smile, “that when a prince of our\n     house is about to die, a female dressed in white is seen wandering\n     about the palace?  My friends,” added he to his defenders, “I am\n     about to depart before you for the land of the just, but there, at\n     least, we shall be reunited.”  In fact, his Majesty’s only\n     apprehension seemed to be for his family.–ALISON.]",
        "“All is lost,” he said to Clery.  “The King is condemned.”  The King, who\nsaw him arrive, rose to receive him.",
        "     [When M. de Malesherbes went to the Temple to announce the result of\n     the vote, he found Louis with his forehead resting on his hands, and\n     absorbed in a deep reverie.  Without inquiring concerning his fate,\n     he said: “For two hours I have been considering whether, during my\n     whole reign, I have voluntarily given any cause of complaint to my\n     subjects; and with perfect sincerity I declare that I deserve no\n     reproach at their hands, and that I have never formed a wish but for\n     their happiness.”  LACRETELLE.]",
        "M. de Malesherbes, choked by sobs, threw himself at his feet.  The King\nraised him up and affectionately embraced him.  When he could control his\nvoice, De Malesherbes informed the King of the decree sentencing him to\ndeath; he made no movement of surprise or emotion, but seemed only\naffected by the distress of his advocate, whom he tried to comfort.",
        "On the 20th of January, at two in the afternoon, Louis XVI. was awaiting\nhis advocates, when he heard the approach of a numerous party.  He\nstopped with dignity at the door of his apartment, apparently unmoved:\nGarat then told him sorrowfully that he was commissioned to communicate\nto him the decrees of the Convention.  Grouvelle, secretary of the\nExecutive Council, read them to him.  The first declared Louis XVI.\nguilty of treason against the general safety of the State; the second\ncondemned him to death; the third rejected any appeal to the people; and\nthe fourth and last ordered his execution in twenty-four hours.  Louis,\nlooking calmly round, took the paper from Grouvelle, and read Garat a\nletter, in which he demanded from the Convention three days to prepare\nfor death, a confessor to assist him in his last moments, liberty to see\nhis family, and permission for them to leave France.  Garat took the\nletter, promising to submit it immediately to the Convention.",
        "Louis XVI. then went back into his room with great composure, ordered his\ndinner, and ate as usual.  There were no knives on the table, and his\nattendants refused to let him have any.  “Do they think me so cowardly,\"\nhe exclaimed, “as to lay violent hands on myself?  I am innocent, and I\nam not afraid to die.”",
        "The Convention refused the delay, but granted some other demands which he\nhad made.  Garat sent for Edgeworth de Firmont, the ecclesiastic whom\nLouis XVI. had chosen, and took him in his own carriage to the Temple.\nM. Edgeworth, on being ushered into the presence of the King, would have\nthrown himself at his feet, but Louis instantly raised him, and both shed\ntears of emotion.  He then, with eager curiosity, asked various questions\nconcerning the clergy of France, several bishops, and particularly the\nArchbishop of Paris, requesting him to assure the latter that he died\nfaithfully attached to his communion.–The clock having struck eight, he\nrose, begged M. Edgeworth to wait, and retired with emotion, saying that\nhe was going to see his family.  The municipal officers, unwilling to\nlose sight of the King, even while with his family, had decided that he\nshould see them in the dining-room, which had a glass door, through which\nthey could watch all his motions without hearing what he said.  At half-\npast eight the door opened.  The Queen, holding the Dauphin by the hand,\nMadame Elisabeth, and Madame Royale rushed sobbing into the arms of Louis\nXVI.  The door was closed, and the municipal officers, Clery, and M.\nEdgeworth placed themselves behind it.  During the first moments, it was\nbut a scene of confusion and despair.  Cries and lamentations prevented\nthose who were on the watch from distinguishing anything.  At length the\nconversation became more calm, and the Princesses, still holding the King\nclasped in their arms, spoke with him in a low tone.  “He related his\ntrial to my mother,” says Madame Royale, “apologising for the wretches\nwho had condemned him.  He told her that he would not consent to any\nattempt to save him, which might excite disturbance in the country.\nHe then gave my brother some religious advice, and desired him, above\nall, to forgive those who caused his death; and he gave us his blessing.\nMy mother was very desirous that the whole family should pass the night\nwith my father, but he opposed this, observing to her that he much needed\nsome hours of repose and quiet.”  After a long conversation, interrupted\nby silence and grief, the King put an end to the painful meeting,\nagreeing to see his family again at eight the next morning.  “Do you\npromise that you will?”  earnestly inquired the Princesses.  “Yes, yes,\"\nsorrowfully replied the King.",
        "     [\"But when we were gone,” says his daughter, “he requested that we\n     might not be permitted to return, as our presence afflicted him too\n     much.\"]",
        "At this moment the Queen held him by one arm, Madame Elisabeth by the\nother, while Madame Royale clasped him round the waist, and the Dauphin\nstood before him, with one hand in that of his mother.  At the moment of\nretiring Madame Royale fainted; she was carried away, and the King\nreturned to M. Edgeworth deeply depressed by this painful interview.\nThe King retired to rest about midnight; M. Edgeworth threw himself upon\na bed, and Clery took his place near the pillow of his master.",
        "Next morning, the 21st of January, at five, the King awoke, called Clery,\nand dressed with great calmness.  He congratulated himself on having\nrecovered his strength by sleep.  Clery kindled a fire,, and moved a\nchest of drawers, out of which he formed an altar.  M. Edgeworth put on\nhis pontifical robes, and began to celebrate mass.  Clery waited on him,\nand the King listened, kneeling with the greatest devotion.  He then\nreceived the communion from the hands of M. Edgeworth, and after mass\nrose with new vigour, and awaited with composure the moment for going to\nthe scaffold.  He asked for scissors that Clery might cut his hair; but\nthe Commune refused to trust him with a pair.",
        "At this moment the drums were beating in the capital.  All who belonged\nto the armed sections repaired to their company with complete submission.\nIt was reported that four or five hundred devoted men, were to make a\ndash upon the carriage, and rescue the King.  The Convention, the\nCommune, the Executive Council, and the Jacobins were sitting.  At eight.\nin the morning, Santerre, with a deputation from the Commune, the\ndepartment, and the criminal tribunal, repaired to the Temple.  Louis\nXVI., on hearing them arrive, rose and prepared to depart.  He desired\nClery to transmit his last farewell to his wife, his sister, and his\nchildren; he gave him a sealed packet, hair, and various trinkets, with\ndirections to deliver these articles to them.",
        "     [In the course of the morning the King said to me: “You will give\n     this seal to my son and this ring to the Queen, and assure her that\n     it is with pain I part with it.  This little packet contains the\n     hair of all my family; you will give her that, too.  Tell the Queen,\n     my dear sister, and my children, that, although I promised to see\n     them again this morning, I have resolved to spare them the pang of\n     so cruel a separation.  Tell them how much it costs me to go away\n     without receiving their embraces once more!”  He wiped away some\n     tears, and then added, in the most mournful accents, “I charge you\n     to bear them my last farewell.\"–CLERY.]",
        "He then clasped his hand and thanked him for his services.  After this he\naddressed himself to one of the municipal officers, requesting him to\ntransmit his last will to the Commune.  This officer, who had formerly\nbeen a priest, and was named Jacques Roux, brutally replied that his\nbusiness was to conduct him to execution, and not to perform his\ncommissions.  Another person took charge of it, and Louis, turning\ntowards the party, gave with firmness the signal for starting.",
        "Officers of gendarmerie were placed on the front seat of the carriage.\nThe King and M. Edgeworth occupied the back.  During the ride, which was\nrather long, the King read in M. Edgeworth’s breviary the prayers for\npersons at the point of death; the two gendarmes were astonished at his\npiety and tranquil resignation.  The vehicle advanced slowly, and amidst\nuniversal silence.  At the Place de la Revolution an extensive space had\nbeen left vacant about the scaffold.  Around this space were planted\ncannon; the most violent of the Federalists were stationed about the\nscaffold; and the vile rabble, always ready to insult genius, virtue, and\nmisfortune, when a signal is given it to do so, crowded behind the ranks\nof the Federalists, and alone manifested some outward tokens of\nsatisfaction.",
        "At ten minutes past ten the carriage stopped.  Louis XVI., rising\nbriskly, stepped out into the Place.  Three executioners came up; he\nrefused their assistance, and took off his clothes himself.  But,\nperceiving that they were going to bind his hands, he made a movement of\nindignation, and seemed ready to resist.  M. Edgeworth gave him a last\nlook, and said, “Suffer this outrage, as a last resemblance to that God\nwho is about to be your reward.”  At these words the King suffered\nhimself to be bound and conducted to the scaffold.  All at once Louis\nhurriedly advanced to address the people.  “Frenchmen,” said he, in a\nfirm voice, “I die innocent of the crimes which are imputed to me; I\nforgive the authors of my death, and I pray that my blood may not fall\nupon France.”  He would have continued, but the drums were instantly\nordered to beat: their rolling drowned his voice; the executioners laid\nhold of him, and M. Edgeworth took his leave in these memorable words:\n\"Son of Saint Louis, ascend to heaven!”  As soon as the blood flowed,\nfurious wretches dipped their pikes and handkerchiefs in it, then\ndispersed throughout Paris, shouting “Vive la Republique!  Vive la\nNation!”  and even went to the gates of the Temple to display brutal and\nfactious joy.",
        "     [The body of Louis was, immediately after the execution, removed to\n     the ancient cemetery of the Madeleine.  Large quantities of\n     quicklime were thrown into the grave, which occasioned so rapid a\n     decomposition that, when his remains were nought for in 1816, it was\n     with difficulty any part could be recovered.  Over the spot where he\n     was interred Napoleon commenced the splendid Temple of Glory, after\n     the battle of Jena; and the superb edifice was completed by the\n     Bourbons, and now forms the Church of the Madeleine, the most\n     beautiful structure in Paris.  Louis was executed on the same ground\n     where the Queen, Madame Elisabeth, and so many other noble victims\n     of the Revolution perished; where Robespierre and Danton afterwards\n     suffered; and where the Emperor Alexander and the allied sovereigns\n     took their station, when their victorious troops entered Paris in\n     1814!  The history of modern Europe has not a scene fraught with\n     equally interesting recollections to exhibit.  It is now marked by\n     the colossal obelisk of blood-red granite which was brought from\n     Thebes, in Upper Egypt, in 1833, by the French Government.–\n     ALLISON.]",

        "On the morning of the King’s execution, according to the narrative of\nMadame Royale, his family rose at six: “The night before, my mother had\nscarcely strength enough to put my brother to bed; She threw herself,\ndressed as she was, on her own bed, where we heard her shivering with\ncold and grief all night long.  At a quarter-past six the door opened; we\nbelieved that we were sent for to the King, but it was only the officers\nlooking for a prayer-book for him.  We did not, however, abandon the hope\nof seeing him, till shouts of joy from the infuriated populace told us\nthat all was over.  In the afternoon my mother asked to see Clery, who\nprobably had some message for her; we hoped that seeing him would\noccasion a burst of grief which might relieve the state of silent and\nchoking agony in which we saw her.”  The request was refused, and the\nofficers who brought the refusal said Clery was in “a frightful state of\ndespair” at not being allowed to see the royal family; shortly afterwards\nhe was dismissed from the Temple.",
        "“We had now a little more freedom,” continues the Princess; “our guards\neven believed that we were about to be sent out of France; but nothing\ncould calm my mother’s agony; no hope could touch her heart, and life or\ndeath became indifferent to her.  Fortunately my own affliction increased\nmy illness so seriously that it distracted her thoughts .  .  .  .\nMy mother would go no more to the garden, because she must have passed\nthe door of what had been my father’s room, and that she could not bear.\nBut fearing lest want of air should prove injurious to my brother and me,\nabout the end of February she asked permission to walk on the leads of\nthe Tower, and it was granted.”",
        "The Council of the Commune, becoming aware of the interest which these\nsad promenades excited, and the sympathy with which they were observed\nfrom the neighbouring houses, ordered that the spaces between the\nbattlements should be filled up with shutters, which intercepted the\nview.  But while the rules for the Queen’s captivity were again made more\nstrict, some of the municipal commissioners tried slightly to alleviate\nit, and by means of M. de Hue, who was at liberty in Paris, and the\nfaithful Turgi, who remained in the Tower, some communications passed\nbetween the royal family and their friends.  The wife of Tison, who\nwaited on the Queen, suspected and finally denounced these more lenient\nguardians,–[Toulan, Lepitre, Vincent, Bruno, and others.]–who were\nexecuted, the royal prisoners being subjected to a close examination.",
        "“On the 20th of April,” says Madame Royale, “my mother and I had just\ngone to bed when Hebert arrived with several municipals.  We got up\nhastily, and these men read us a decree of the Commune directing that we\nshould be searched.  My poor brother was asleep; they tore him from his\nbed under the pretext of examining it.  My mother took him up, shivering\nwith cold.  All they took was a shopkeeper’s card which my mother had\nhappened to keep, a stick of sealing-wax from my aunt, and from me ’une\nsacre coeur de Jesus’ and a prayer for the welfare of France.  The search\nlasted from half-past ten at night till four o’clock in the morning.”",
        "The next visit of the officials was to Madame Elisabeth alone; they found\nin her room a hat which the King had worn during his imprisonment, and\nwhich she had begged him to give her as a souvenir.  They took it from\nher in spite of her entreaties.  “It was suspicious,” said the cruel and\ncontemptible tyrants.",
        "The Dauphin became ill with fever, and it was long before his mother,\nwho watched by him night and day, could obtain medicine or advice for\nhim.  When Thierry was at last allowed to see him his treatment relieved\nthe most violent symptoms, but, says Madame Royale, “his health was never\nreestablished.  Want of air and exercise did him great mischief, as well\nas the kind of life which this poor child led, who at eight years of age\npassed his days amidst the tears of his friends, and in constant anxiety\nand agony.”",
        "While the Dauphin’s health was causing his family such alarm, they were\ndeprived of the services of Tison’s wife, who became ill, and finally\ninsane, and was removed to the Hotel Dieu, where her ravings were\nreported to the Assembly and made the ground of accusations against the\nroyal prisoners.",
        "     [This woman, troubled by remorse, lost her reason, threw herself at\n     the feet of the Queen, implored her pardon, and disturbed the Temple\n     for many days with the sight and the noise of her madness.  The\n     Princesses, forgetting the denunciations of this unfortunate being,\n     in consideration of her repentance and insanity, watched over her by\n     turns, and deprived themselves of their own food to relieve her.–\n     LAMARTINE, “History of the Girondists,” vol. iii., p.140.]",
        "No woman took her place, and the Princesses themselves made their beds,\nswept their rooms, and waited upon the Queen.",
        "Far worse punishments than menial work were prepared for them.  On 3d\nJuly a decree of the Convention ordered that the Dauphin should be\nseparated from his family and “placed in the most secure apartment of the\nTower.”  As soon as he heard this decree pronounced, says his sister, “he\nthrew himself into my mother’s arms, and with violent cries entreated not\nto be parted from her.  My mother would not let her son go, and she\nactually defended against the efforts of the officers the bed in which\nshe had placed him.  The men threatened to call up the guard and use\nviolence.  My mother exclaimed that they had better kill her than tear\nher child from her.  At last they threatened our lives, and my mother’s\nmaternal tenderness forced her to the sacrifice.  My aunt and I dressed\nthe child, for my poor mother had no longer strength for anything.\nNevertheless, when he was dressed, she took him up in her arms and\ndelivered him herself to the officers, bathing him with her tears,\nforeseeing that she was never to behold him again.  The poor little\nfellow embraced us all tenderly, and was carried away in a flood of\ntears.  My mother’s horror was extreme when she heard that Simon, a\nshoemaker by trade, whom she had seen as a municipal officer in the\nTemple, was the person to whom her child was confided .  .  .  .  The\nofficers now no longer remained in my mother’s apartment; they only came\nthree times a day to bring our meals and examine the bolts and bars of\nour windows; we were locked up together night and day.  We often went up\nto the Tower, because my brother went, too, from the other side.  The\nonly pleasure my mother enjoyed was seeing him through a crevice as he\npassed at a distance.  She would watch for hours together to see him as\nhe passed.  It was her only hope, her only thought.”",
        "The Queen was soon deprived even of this melancholy consolation.  On 1st\nAugust, 1793, it was resolved that she should be tried.  Robespierre\nopposed the measure, but Barere roused into action that deep-rooted\nhatred of the Queen which not even the sacrifice of her life availed to\neradicate.  “Why do the enemies of the Republic still hope for success?\"\nhe asked.  “Is it because we have too long forgotten the crimes of the\nAustrian?  The children of Louis the Conspirator are hostages for the\nRepublic .  .  .but behind them lurks a woman who has been the cause of\nall the disasters of France.”",
        "At two o’clock on the morning of the following day, the municipal\nofficers “awoke us,” says Madame Royale, “to read to my mother the decree\nof the Convention, which ordered her removal to the Conciergerie,",
        "     [The Conciergerie was originally, as its name implies, the porter’s\n     lodge of the ancient Palace of Justice, and became in time a prison,\n     from the custom of confining there persons who had committed\n     trifling offences about the Court.]",
        "preparatory to her trial.  She heard it without visible emotion, and\nwithout speaking a single word.  My aunt and I immediately asked to be\nallowed to accompany my mother, but this favour was refused us.  All the\ntime my mother was making up a bundle of clothes to take with her, these\nofficers never left her.  She was even obliged to dress herself before\nthem, and they asked for her pockets, taking away the trifles they\ncontained.  She embraced me, charging me to keep up my spirits and my\ncourage, to take tender care of my aunt, and obey her as a second mother.\nShe then threw herself into my aunt’s arms, and recommended her children\nto her care; my aunt replied to her in a whisper, and she was then\nhurried away.  In leaving the Temple she struck her head against the\nwicket, not having stooped low enough.",

        "We have already seen what changes had been made in the Temple.  Marie\nAntoinette had been separated from her sister, her daughter, and her Son,\nby virtue of a decree which ordered the trial and exile of the last\nmembers of the family of the Bourbons.  She had been removed to the\nConciergerie, and there, alone in a narrow prison, she was reduced to\nwhat was strictly necessary, like the other prisoners.  The imprudence of\na devoted friend had rendered her situation still more irksome.\nMichonnis, a member of the municipality, in whom she had excited a warm\ninterest, was desirous of introducing to her a person who, he said,\nwished to see her out of curiosity.  This man, a courageous emigrant,\nthrew to her a carnation, in which was enclosed a slip of very fine paper\nwith these words: “Your friends are ready,\"–false hope, and equally\ndangerous for her who received it, and for him who gave it!  Michonnis\nand the emigrant were detected and forthwith apprehended; and the\nvigilance exercised in regard to the unfortunate prisoner became from\nthat day more rigorous than ever.",
        "     [The Queen was lodged in a room called the council chamber, which\n     was considered as the moat unwholesome apartment in the Conciergerie\n     on account of its dampness and the bad smells by which it was\n     continually affected.  Under pretence of giving her a person to wait\n     upon her they placed near her a spy,–a man of a horrible\n     countenance and hollow, sepulchral voice.  This wretch, whose name\n     was Barassin, was a robber and murderer by profession.  Such was the\n     chosen attendant on the Queen of France!  A few days before her\n     trial this wretch was removed and a gendarme placed in her chamber,\n     who watched over her night and day, and from whom she was not\n     separated, even when in bed, but by a ragged curtain.  In this\n     melancholy abode Marie Antoinette had no other dress than an old\n     black gown, stockings with holes, which she was forced to mend every\n     day; and she was entirely destitute of shoes.–DU  BROCA.]",
        "Gendarmes were to mount guard incessantly at the door of her prison, and\nthey were expressly forbidden to answer anything that she might say to\nthem.",
        "That wretch Hebert, the deputy of Chaumette, and editor of the disgusting\npaper Pere Duchesne, a writer of the party of which Vincent, Ronsin,\nVarlet, and Leclerc were the leaders–Hebert had made it his particular\nbusiness to torment the unfortunate remnant of the dethroned family.\nHe asserted that the family of the tyrant ought not to be better treated\nthan any sans-culotte family; and he had caused a resolution to be passed\nby which the sort of luxury in which the prisoners in the Temple were\nmaintained was to be suppressed.  They were no longer to be allowed\neither poultry or pastry; they were reduced to one sort of aliment for\nbreakfast, and to soup or broth and a single dish for dinner, to two\ndishes for supper, and half a bottle of wine apiece.  Tallow candles were\nto be furnished instead of wag, pewter instead of silver plate, and delft\nware instead of porcelain.  The wood and water carriers alone were\npermitted to enter their room, and that only accompanied by two\ncommissioners.  Their food was to be introduced to them by means of a\nturning box.  The numerous establishment was reduced to a cook and an\nassistant, two men-servants, and a woman-servant to attend to the linen.",
        "As soon as this resolution was passed, Hebert had repaired to the Temple\nand inhumanly taken away from the unfortunate prisoners even the most\ntrifling articles to which they attached a high value.  Eighty Louis\nwhich Madame Elisabeth had in reserve, and which she had received from\nMadame de Lamballe, were also taken away.  No one is more dangerous, more\ncruel, than the man without acquirements, without education, clothed with\na recent authority.  If, above all, he possess a base nature, if, like\nHebert, who was check-taker at the door of a theatre, and embezzled money\nout of the receipts, he be destitute of natural morality, and if he leap\nall at once from the mud of his condition into power, he is as mean as he\nis atrocious.  Such was Hebert in his conduct at the Temple.  He did not\nconfine himself to the annoyances which we have mentioned.  He and some\nothers conceived the idea of separating the young Prince from his aunt\nand sister.  A shoemaker named Simon and his wife were the instructors to\nwhom it was deemed right to consign him for the purpose of giving him a\nsans-cullotte education.  Simon and his wife were shut up in the Temple,\nand, becoming prisoners with the unfortunate child, were directed to\nbring him up in their own way.  Their food was better than that of the\nPrincesses, and they shared the table of the municipal commissioners who\nwere on duty.  Simon was permitted to go down, accompanied by two\ncommissioners, to the court of the Temple, for the purpose of giving the\nDauphin a little exercise.",
        "Hebert conceived the infamous idea of wringing from this boy revelations\nto criminate his unhappy mother.  Whether this wretch imputed to the\nchild false revelations, or abused his, tender age and his condition to\nextort from him what admissions soever he pleased, he obtained a\nrevolting deposition; and as the youth of the Prince did not admit of his\nbeing brought before the tribunal, Hebert appeared and detailed the\ninfamous particulars which he had himself either dictated or invented.",
        "It was on the 14th of October that Marie Antoinette appeared before her\njudges.  Dragged before the sanguinary tribunal by inexorable\nrevolutionary vengeance, she appeared there without any chance of\nacquittal, for it was not to obtain her acquittal that the Jacobins had\nbrought her before it.  It was necessary, however, to make some charges.\nFouquier therefore collected the rumours current among the populace ever\nsince the arrival of the Princess in France, and, in the act of\naccusation, he charged her with having plundered the exchequer, first for\nher pleasures, and afterwards in order to transmit money to her brother,\nthe Emperor.  He insisted on the scenes of the 5th and 6th of October,\nand on the dinners of the Life Guards, alleging that she had at that\nperiod framed a plot, which obliged the people to go to Versailles to\nfrustrate it.  He afterwards accused her of having governed her husband,\ninterfered in the choice of ministers, conducted the intrigues with the\ndeputies gained by the Court, prepared the journey to Varennes, provoked\nthe war, and transmitted to the enemy’s generals all our plans of\ncampaign.  He further accused her of having prepared a new conspiracy on\nthe 10th of August, of having on that day caused the people to be fired\nupon, having induced her husband to defend himself by taxing him with\ncowardice; lastly, of having never ceased to plot and correspond with\nforeigners since her captivity in the Temple, and of having there treated\nher young son as King.  We here observe how, on the terrible day of long-\ndeferred vengeance, when subjects at length break forth and strike such\nof their princes as have not deserved the blow, everything is distorted\nand converted into crime.  We see how the profusion and fondness for\npleasure, so natural to a young princess, how her attachment to her\nnative country, her influence over her husband, her regrets, always more\nindiscreet in a woman than a man, nay, even her bolder courage, appeared\nto their inflamed or malignant imaginations.",
        "It was necessary to produce witnesses.  Lecointre, deputy of Versailles,\nwho had seen what had passed on the 5th and 6th of October, Hebert, who\nhad frequently visited the Temple, various clerks in the ministerial\noffices, and several domestic servants of the old Court were summoned..\nAdmiral d’Estaing, formerly commandant of the guard of Versailles;\nManuel, the ex-procureur of the Commune; Latour-du-Pin, minister of war\nin 1789; the venerable Bailly, who, it was said, had been, with La\nFayette, an accomplice in the journey to Varennes; lastly, Valaze one of\nthe Girondists destined to the scaffold, were taken from their prisons\nand compelled to give evidence.",
        "No precise fact was elicited.  Some had seen the Queen in high spirits\nwhen the Life Guards testified their attachment; others had seen her\nvexed and dejected while being conducted to Paris, or brought back from\nVarennes; these had been present at splendid festivities which must have\ncost enormous sums; those had heard it said in the ministerial offices\nthat the Queen was adverse to the sanction of the decrees.  An ancient\nwaiting-woman of the Queen had heard the Duc de Coigny say, in 1788, that\nthe Emperor had already received two hundred millions from France to make\nwar upon the Turks.",
        "The cynical Hebert, being brought before the unfortunate Queen, dared at\nlength to prefer the charges wrung from the young Prince.  He said that\nCharles Capet had given Simon an account of the journey to Varennes, and\nmentioned La Fayette and Bailly as having cooperated in it.  He then\nadded that this boy was addicted to odious and very premature vices for\nhis age; that he had been surprised by Simon, who, on questioning him,\nlearned that he derived from his mother the vices in which he indulged.\nHebert said that it was no doubt the intention of Marie Antoinette, by\nweakening thus, early the physical constitution of her son, to secure to\nherself the means of ruling him in case he should ever ascend the throne.\nThe rumours which had been whispered for twenty years by a malicious\nCourt had given the people a most unfavourable opinion of the morals of\nthe Queen.  That audience, however, though wholly Jacobin, was disgusted\nat the accusations of Hebert.",
        "     [Can there be a more infernal invention than that made against the.\n     Queen by Hdbert,-namely, that she had had an improper intimacy with\n     her own son?  He made use of this sublime idea of which he boasted\n     in order to prejudice the women against the Queen, and to prevent\n     her execution from exciting pity.  It had, however, no other effect\n     than that of disgusting all parties.–PRUDHOMME.]",
        "He nevertheless persisted in supporting them.",
        "     [Hebert did not long survive her in whose sufferings he had taken\n     such an infamous part.  He was executed on 26th March, 1794.]",
        "The unhappy mother made no reply.  Urged a new to explain herself, she\nsaid, with extraordinary emotion, “I thought that human nature would\nexcuse me from answering such an imputation, but I appeal from it to the\nheart of every mother here present.”  This noble and simple reply\naffected all who heard it.",
        "In the depositions of the witnesses, however, all was not so bitter for\nMarie Antoinette.  The brave D’Estaing, whose enemy she had been, would\nnot say anything to inculpate her, and spoke only of the courage which\nshe had shown on the 5th and 6th of October, and of the noble resolution\nwhich she had expressed, to die beside her husband rather than fly.\nManuel, in spite of his enmity to the Court during the time of the\nLegislative Assembly, declared that he could not say anything against the\naccused.  When the venerable Bailly was brought forward, who formerly so\noften predicted to the Court the calamities which its imprudence must\nproduce, he appeared painfully affected; and when he was asked if he knew\nthe wife of Capet, “Yes,” said he, bowing respectfully, “I have known\nMadame.”  He declared that he knew nothing, and maintained that the\ndeclarations extorted from the young Prince relative to the journey to\nVarennes were false.  In recompense for his deposition he was assailed\nwith outrageous reproaches, from which he might judge what fate would\nsoon be awarded to himself.",
        "In all the evidence there appeared but two serious facts, attested by\nLatour-du-Pin and Valaze, who deposed to them because they could not help\nit.  Latour-du-Pin declared that Marie Antoinette had applied to him for\nan accurate statement of the armies while he was minister of war.\nValaze, always cold, but respectful towards misfortune, would not say\nanything to criminate the accused; yet he could not help declaring that,\nas a member of the commission of twenty-four, being charged with his\ncolleagues to examine the papers found at the house of Septeuil,\ntreasurer of the civil list, he had seen bonds for various sums signed\nAntoinette, which was very natural; but he added that he had also seen a\nletter in which the minister requested the King to transmit to the Queen\nthe copy of the plan of campaign which he had in his hands.  The most\nunfavourable construction was immediately put upon these two facts, the\napplication for a statement of the armies, and the communication of the\nplan of campaign; and it was concluded that they could not be wanted for\nany other purpose than to be sent to the enemy, for it was not supposed\nthat a young princess should turn her attention, merely for her own\nsatisfaction, to matters of administration and military, plans.  After\nthese depositions, several others were received respecting the expenses\nof the Court, the influence of the Queen in public affairs, the scene of\nthe 10th of August, and what had passed in the Temple; and the most vague\nrumours and most trivial circumstances were eagerly caught at as proofs.",

But alas!  all that I loved\nwas perishing around me, and I was soon to lose her also .  .  .  .

I answered as well as I could\nwithout implicating anybody.  I had always heard my parents say that it\nwere better to die than to implicate anybody.”  When the examination was\nover the Princess begged to be allowed to join her mother, but Chaumette\nsaid he could not obtain permission for her to do so.  She was then\ncautioned to say nothing about her examination to her aunt, who was next\nto appear before them.

The officers who guarded them took away their\nchessmen and cards because some of them were named kings and queens, and\nall the books with coats of arms on them; they refused to get ointment\nfor a gathering on Madame Elisabeth’s arm; they, would not allow her to\nmake a herb-tea which she thought would strengthen her niece; they\ndeclined to supply fish or eggs on fast-days or during Lent, bringing\nonly coarse fat meat, and brutally replying to all remonstances, “None\nbut fools believe in that stuff nowadays.”  Madame Elisabeth never made\nthe officials another request, but reserved some of the bread and cafe-\nau-fait from her breakfast for her second meal.  The time during which\nshe could be thus tormented was growing short.",
        "On 9th May, 1794, as the Princesses were going to bed, the outside bolts\nof the door were unfastened and a loud knocking was heard.  “When my aunt\nwas dressed,” says Madame Royale, “she opened the door, and they said to\nher, ’Citoyenne, come down.’–’And my niece?’–’We shall take care of her\nafterwards.’ She embraced me, and to calm my agitation promised to\nreturn.  ’No, citoyenne,’ said the men, ’bring your bonnet; you shall not\nreturn.’  They overwhelmed her with abuse, but she bore it patiently,\nembracing me, and exhorting me to trust in Heaven, and never to forget\nthe last commands of my father and mother.”",
        "Madame Elisabeth was then taken to the Conciergerie, where she was\ninterrogated by the vice-president at midnight,’ and then allowed to take\nsome hours rest on the bed on which Marie Antoinette had slept for the\nlast time.  In the morning she was brought before the tribunal, with\ntwenty-four other prisoners, of varying ages and both sexes, some of whom\nhad once been frequently seen at Court.",
        "“Of what has Elisabeth to complain?”  Fouquier-Tinville satirically\nasked.  “At the foot of the guillotine, surrounded by faithful nobility,\nshe may imagine herself again at Versailles.”",
        "“You call my brother a tyrant,” the Princess replied to her accuser; “if\nhe had been what you say, you would not be where you are, nor I before\nyou!”",
        "She was sentenced to death, and showed neither surprise nor grief.  “I am\nready to die,” she said, “happy in the prospect of rejoining in a better\nworld those whom I loved on earth.”",
        "On being taken to the room where those condemned to suffer at the same\ntime as herself were assembled, she spoke to them with so much piety and\nresignation that they were encouraged by her example to show calmness and\ncourage like her own.  The women, on leaving the cart, begged to embrace\nher, and she said some words of comfort to each in turn as they mounted\nthe scaffold, which she was not allowed to ascend till all her companions\nhad been executed before her eyes.",
        "     [Madame Elisabeth was one of those rare personages only seen at\n     distant intervals during the course of ages; she set an example of\n     steadfast piety in the palace of kings, she lived amid her family\n     the favourite of all and the admiration of the world ....  When I\n     went to Versailles Madame Elisabeth was twenty-two years of age.\n     Her plump figure and pretty pink colour must have attracted notice,\n     and her air of calmness and contentment even more than her beauty.\n     She was fond of billiards, and her elegance and courage in riding\n     were remarkable.  But she never allowed these amusements to\n     interfere with her religious observances.  At that time her wish to\n     take the veil at St. Cyr was much talked of, but the King was too\n     fond of his sister to endure the separation.  There were also\n     rumours of a marriage between Madame Elisabeth and the Emperor\n     Joseph.  The Queen was sincerely attached to her brother, and loved\n     her sister-in-law most tenderly; she ardently desired this marriage\n     as a means of raising the Princess to one of the first thrones in\n     Europe, and as a possible means of turning the Emperor from his\n     innovations.  She had been very carefully educated, had talent in\n     music and painting, spoke Italian and a little Latin, and understood\n     mathematics....  Her last moments were worthy of her courage and\n     virtue.–D’HEZECQUES’s “Recollections,” pp. 72-75.]",
        "“It is impossible to imagine my distress at finding myself separated from\nmy aunt,” says Madame Royale.  “Since I had been able to appreciate her\nmerits, I saw in her nothing but religion, gentleness, meekness, modesty,\nand a devoted attachment to her family; she sacrificed her life for them,\nsince nothing could persuade her to leave the King and Queen.  I never\ncan be sufficiently grateful to her for her goodness to me, which ended\nonly with her life.  She looked on me as her child, and I honoured and\nloved her as a second mother.  I was thought to be very like her in\ncountenance, and I feel conscious that I have something of her character.\nWould to God I might imitate her virtues, and hope that I may hereafter\ndeserve to meet her, as well as my dear parents, in the bosom of our\nCreator, where I cannot doubt that they enjoy the reward of their\nvirtuous lives and meritorious deaths.”",
        "Madame Royale vainly begged to be allowed to rejoin her mother or her\naunt, or at least to know their fate.  The municipal officers would tell\nher nothing, and rudely refused her request to have a woman placed with\nher.  “I asked nothing but what seemed indispensable, though it was often\nharshly refused,” she says.  “But I at least could keep myself clean.  I\nhad soap and water, and carefully swept out my room every day.  I had no\nlight, but in the long days I did not feel this privation much .  .  .  .\nI had some religious works and travels, which I had read over and over.\nI had also some knitting, ’qui m’ennuyait beaucoup’.”  Once, she\nbelieves, Robespierre visited her prison:",
        "     [It has been said that Robespierre vainly tried to obtain the hand\n     of Mademoiselle d’Orleans.  It was also rumoured that Madame Royale\n     herself owed her life to his matrimonial ambition.]",
        "“The officers showed him great respect; the people in the Tower did not\nknow him, or at least would not tell me who he was.  He stared insolently\nat me, glanced at my books, and, after joining the municipal officers in\na search, retired.”",
        "     [On another occasion “three men in scarfs,” who entered the\n     Princess’s room, told her that they did not see why she should wish\n     to be released, as she seemed very comfortable!  “It is dreadful,’\n     I replied, ’to be separated for more than a year from one’s mother,\n     without even hearing what has become of her or of my aunt.’–’You\n     are not ill?’–’No, monsieur, but the cruellest illness is that of\n     the heart’–’ We can do nothing for you.  Be patient, and submit to\n     the justice and goodness of the French people: I had nothing more to\n     say.\"–DUCHESSE D’ANGOULEME, “Royal Memoirs,” p. 273.]",
        "When Laurent was appointed by the Convention to the charge of the young\nprisoners, Madame Royale was treated with more consideration.  “He was\nalways courteous,” she says; he restored her tinderbox, gave her fresh\nbooks, and allowed her candles and as much firewood as she wanted, “which\npleased me greatly.”  This simple expression of relief gives a clearer\nidea of what the delicate girl must have suffered than a volume of\ncomplaints.",
        "But however hard Madame Royale’s lot might be, that of the Dauphin was\ninfinitely harder.  Though only eight years old when he entered the\nTemple, he was by nature and education extremely precocious; “his memory\nretained everything, and his sensitiveness comprehended everything.”  His\nfeatures “recalled the somewhat effeminate look of Louis XV., and the\nAustrian hauteur of Maria Theresa; his blue eyes, aquiline nose, elevated\nnostrils, well-defined mouth, pouting lips, chestnut hair parted in the\nmiddle and falling in thick curls on his shoulders, resembled his mother\nbefore her years of tears and torture.  All the beauty of his race, by\nboth descents, seemed to reappear in him.\"–[Lamartine]–  For some time\nthe care of his parents preserved his health and cheerfulness even in the\nTemple; but his constitution was weakened by the fever recorded by his\nsister, and his gaolers were determined that he should never regain\nstrength.",
        "“What does the Convention intend to do with him?” asked Simon, when the\ninnocent victim was placed in his clutches.  “Transport him?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Kill him?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Poison him?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“What, then?”",
        "“Why, get rid of him.”",
        "For such a purpose they could not have chosen their instruments better.\n\"Simon and his wife, cut off all those fair locks that had been his\nyouthful glory and his mother’s pride.  This worthy pair stripped him of\nthe mourning he wore for his father; and as they did so, they called it\n’playing at the game of the spoiled king.’  They alternately induced him\nto commit excesses, and then half starved him.  They beat him\nmercilessly; nor was the treatment by night less brutal than that by day.\nAs soon as the weary boy had sunk into his first profound sleep, they\nwould loudly call him by name, ’Capet!  Capet!’ Startled, nervous, bathed\nin perspiration, or sometimes trembling with cold, he would spring up,\nrush through the dark, and present himself at Simon’s bedside, murmuring,\ntremblingly, ’I am here, citizen.’–’Come nearer; let me feel you.’\nHe would approach the bed as he was ordered, although he knew the\ntreatment that awaited him.  Simon would buffet him on the head, or kick\nhim away, adding the remark, ’Get to bed again, wolfs cub; I only wanted\nto know that you were safe.’  On one of these occasions, when the child\nhad fallen half stunned upon his own miserable couch, and lay there\ngroaning and faint with pain, Simon roared out with a laugh, ’Suppose you\nwere king, Capet, what would you do to me?’ The child thought of his\nfather’s dying words, and said, ’I would forgive you.’\"–[THIERS]",
        "The change in the young Prince’s mode of life, and the cruelties and\ncaprices to which he was subjected, soon made him fall ill, says his\nsister.  “Simon forced him to eat to excess, and to drink large\nquantities of wine, which he detested .  .  .  .  He grew extremely fat\nwithout increasing in height or strength.”  His aunt and sister, deprived\nof the pleasure of tending him, had the pain of hearing his childish\nvoice raised in the abominable songs his gaolers taught him.  The\nbrutality of Simon “depraved at once the body and soul of his pupil.  He\ncalled him the young wolf of the Temple.  He treated him as the young of\nwild animals are treated when taken from the mother and reduced to\ncaptivity,–at once intimidated by blows and enervated by taming.  He\npunished for sensibility; he rewarded meanness; he encouraged vice; he\nmade the child wait on him at table, sometimes striking him on the face\nwith a knotted towel, sometimes raising the poker and threatening to\nstrike him with it.”",
        "     [Simon left the Temple to become a municipal officer.  He was\n     involved in the overthrow of Robespierre, and guillotined the day\n     after him, 29th July, 1794.]",
        "Yet when Simon was removed the poor young Prince’s condition became even\nworse.  His horrible loneliness induced an apathetic stupor to which any\nsuffering would have been preferable.  “He passed his days without any\nkind of occupation; they did not allow him light in the evening.  His\nkeepers never approached him but to give him food;” and on the rare\noccasions when they took him to the platform of the Tower, he was unable\nor unwilling to move about.  When, in November, 1794, a commissary named\nGomin arrived at the Temple, disposed to treat the little prisoner with\nkindness, it was too late.  “He took extreme care of my brother,” says\nMadame Royale.  “For a long time the unhappy child had been shut up in\ndarkness, and he was dying of fright.  He was very grateful for the\nattentions of Gomin, and became much attached to him.”  But his physical\ncondition was alarming, and, owing to Gomin’s representations, a\ncommission was instituted to examine him.  “The commissioners appointed\nwere Harmond, Mathieu, and Reverchon, who visited ’Louis Charles,’ as he\nwas now called, in the month of February, 1795.  They found the young\nPrince seated at a square deal table, at which he was playing with some\ndirty cards, making card houses and the like,–the materials having been\nfurnished him, probably, that they might figure in the report as\nevidences of indulgence.  He did not look up from the table as the\ncommissioners entered.  He was in a slate-coloured dress, bareheaded; the\nroom was reported as clean, the bed in good condition, the linen fresh;\nhis clothes were also reported as new; but, in spite of all these\nassertions, it is well known that his bed had not been made for months,\nthat he had not left his room, nor was permitted to leave it, for any\npurpose whatever, that it was consequently uninhabitable, and that he was\ncovered with vermin and with sores.  The swellings at his knees alone\nwere sufficient to disable him from walking.  One of the commissioners\napproached the young Prince respectfully.  The latter did not raise his\nhead.  Harmond in a kind voice begged him to speak to them.  The eyes of\nthe boy remained fixed on the table before him.  They told him of the\nkindly intentions of the Government, of their hopes that he would yet be\nhappy, and their desire that he would speak unreservedly to the medical\nman that was to visit him.  He seemed to listen with profound attention,\nbut not a single word passed his lips.  It was an heroic principle that\nimpelled that poor young heart to maintain the silence of a mute in\npresence of these men.  He remembered too well the days when three other\ncommissaries waited on him, regaled him with pastry and wine, and\nobtained from him that hellish accusation against the mother that he\nloved.  He had learnt by some means the import of the act, so far as it\nwas an injury to his mother.  He now dreaded seeing again three\ncommissaries, hearing again kind words, and being treated again with fine\npromises.  Dumb as death itself he sat before them, and remained\nmotionless as stone, and as mute.” [THIERS]",
        "His disease now made rapid progress, and Gomin and Lasne, superintendents\nof the Temple, thinking it necessary to inform the Government of the\nmelancholy condition of their prisoner, wrote on the register: “Little\nCapet is unwell.”  No notice was taken of this account, which was renewed\nnext day in more urgent terms: “Little Capet is dangerously ill.”  Still\nthere was no word from beyond the walls.  “We must knock harder,” said\nthe keepers to each other, and they added, “It is feared he will not\nlive,” to the words “dangerously ill.”  At length, on Wednesday, 6th May,\n1795, three days after the first report, the authorities appointed M.\nDesault to give the invalid the assistance of his art.  After having\nwritten down his name on the register he was admitted to see the Prince.\nHe made a long and very attentive examination of the unfortunate child,\nasked him many questions without being able to obtain an answer, and\ncontented himself with prescribing a decoction of hops, to be taken by\nspoonfuls every half-hour, from six o’clock in the morning till eight in\nthe evening.  On the first day the Prince steadily refused to take it.\nIn vain Gomin several times drank off a glass of the potion in his\npresence; his example proved as ineffectual as his words.  Next day Lasne\nrenewed his solicitations.  “Monsieur knows very well that I desire\nnothing but the good of his health, and he distresses me deeply by thus\nrefusing to take what might contribute to it.  I entreat him as a favour\nnot to give me this cause of grief.”  And as Lasne, while speaking, began\nto taste the potion in a glass, the child took what he offered him out of\nhis hands.  “You have, then, taken an oath that I should drink it,” said\nhe, firmly; “well, give it me, I will drink it.”  From that moment he\nconformed with docility to whatever was required of him, but the policy\nof the Commune had attained its object; help had been withheld till it\nwas almost a mockery to supply it.",
        "The Prince’s weakness was excessive; his keepers could scarcely drag him\nto the, top of the Tower; walking hurt his tender feet, and at every step\nhe stopped to press the arm of Lasne with both hands upon his breast.  At\nlast he suffered so much that it was no longer possible for him to walk,\nand his keeper carried him about, sometimes on the platform, and\nsometimes in the little tower, where the royal family had lived at first.\nBut the slight improvement to his health occasioned by the change of air\nscarcely compensated for the pain which his fatigue gave him.  On the\nbattlement of the platform nearest the left turret, the rain had, by\nperseverance through ages, hollowed out a kind of basin.  The water that\nfell remained there for several days; and as, during the spring of 1795,\nstorms were of frequent occurrence, this little sheet of water was kept\nconstantly supplied.  Whenever the child was brought out upon the\nplatform, he saw a little troop of sparrows, which used to come to drink\nand bathe in this reservoir.  At first they flew away at his approach,\nbut from being accustomed to see him walking quietly there every day,\nthey at last grew more familiar, and did not spread their wings for\nflight till he came up close to them.  They were always the same, he knew\nthem by sight, and perhaps like himself they were inhabitants of that\nancient pile.  He called them his birds; and his first action, when the\ndoor into the terrace was opened, was to look towards that side,–and\nthe sparrows were always there.  He delighted in their chirping, and he\nmust have envied them their wings.",
        "Though so little could be done to alleviate his sufferings, a moral\nimprovement was taking place in him.  He was touched by the lively\ninterest displayed by his physician, who never failed to visit him at\nnine o’clock every morning.  He seemed pleased with the attention paid\nhim, and ended by placing entire confidence in M. Desault.  Gratitude\nloosened his tongue; brutality and insult had failed to extort a murmur,\nbut kind treatment restored his speech he had no words for anger, but he\nfound them to express his thanks.  M. Desault prolonged his visits as\nlong as the officers of the municipality would permit.  When they\nannounced the close of the visit, the child, unwilling to beg them to\nallow a longer time, held back M. Desault by the skirt of his coat.\nSuddenly M. Desault’s visits ceased.  Several days passed and nothing was\nheard of him.  The keepers wondered at his absence, and the poor little\ninvalid was much distressed at it.  The commissary on duty (M. Benoist)\nsuggested that it would be proper to send to the physician’s house to\nmake inquiries as to the cause of so long an absence.  Gomin and Larne\nhad not yet ventured to follow this advice, when next day M. Benoist was\nrelieved by M. Bidault, who, hearing M. Desault’s name mentioned as he\ncame in, immediately said, “You must not expect to see him any more; he\ndied yesterday.”",
        "M. Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de l’Humanite, was next\ndirected to attend the prisoner, and in June he found him in so alarming\na state that he at once asked for a coadjutor, fearing to undertake the\nresponsibility alone.  The physician–sent for form’s sake to attend the\ndying child, as an advocate is given by law to a criminal condemned\nbeforehand–blamed the officers of the municipality for not having\nremoved the blind, which obstructed the light, and the numerous bolts,\nthe noise of which never failed to remind the victim of his captivity.\nThat sound, which always caused him an involuntary shudder, disturbed him\nin the last mournful scene of his unparalleled tortures.  M. Pelletan\nsaid authoritatively to the municipal on duty, “If you will not take\nthese bolts and casings away at once, at least you can make no objection\nto our carrying the child into another room, for I suppose we are sent\nhere to take charge of him.”  The Prince, being disturbed by these words,\nspoken as they were with great animation, made a sign to the physician to\ncome nearer.  “Speak lower, I beg of you,” said he; “I am afraid they\nwill hear you up-stairs, and I should be very sorry for them to know that\nI am ill, as it would give them much uneasiness.”",
        "At first the change to a cheerful and airy room revived the Prince and\ngave him evident pleasure, but the improvement did not last.  Next day M.\nPelletan learned that the Government had acceded to his request for a\ncolleague.  M. Dumangin, head physician of the Hospice de l’Unite, made\nhis appearance at his house on the morning of Sunday, 7th June, with the\nofficial despatch sent him by the committee of public safety.  They\nrepaired together immediately to the Tower.  On their arrival they heard\nthat the child, whose weakness was excessive, had had a fainting fit,\nwhich had occasioned fears to be entertained that his end was\napproaching.  He had revived a little, however, when the physicians went\nup at about nine o’clock.  Unable to contend with increasing exhaustion,\nthey perceived there was no longer any hope of prolonging an existence\nworn out by so much suffering, and that all their art could effect would\nbe to soften the last stage of this lamentable disease.  While standing\nby the Prince’s bed, Gomin noticed that he was quietly crying, and asked\nhim.  kindly what was the matter.  “I am always alone,” he said.  “My\ndear mother remains in the other tower.”  Night came,–his last night,–\nwhich the regulations of the prison condemned him to pass once more in\nsolitude, with suffering, his old companion, only at his side.  This\ntime, however, death, too, stood at his pillow.  When Gomin went up to\nthe child’s room on the morning of 8th June, he said, seeing him calm,\nmotionless, and mute:",
        "“I hope you are not in pain just now?”",
        "“Oh, yes, I am still in pain, but not nearly so much,–the music is so\nbeautiful!”",
        "Now there was no music to be heard, either in the Tower or anywhere near.",
        "Gomin, astonished, said to him, “From what direction do you hear this\nmusic?”",
        "“From above!”",
        "“Have you heard it long?”",
        "“Since you knelt down.  Do you not hear it?  Listen!  Listen!”  And the\nchild, with a nervous motion, raised his faltering hand, as he opened his\nlarge eyes illuminated by delight.  His poor keeper, unwilling to destroy\nthis last sweet illusion, appeared to listen also.",
        "After a few minutes of attention the child again started, and cried out,\nin intense rapture, “Amongst all the voices I have distinguished that of\nmy mother!”",
        "These were almost his last words.  At a quarter past two he died, Lasne\nonly being in the room.  at the time.  Lasne acquainted Gomin and Damont,\nthe commissary on duty, with the event, and they repaired to the chamber\nof death.  The poor little royal corpse was carried from the room into\nthat where he had suffered so long,–where for two years he had never\nceased to suffer.  From this apartment the father had gone to the\nscaffold, and thence the son must pass to the burial-ground.  The remains\nwere laid out on the bed, and the doors of the apartment were set open,–\ndoors which had remained closed ever since the Revolution had seized on a\nchild, then full of vigour and grace and life and health!",
        "At eight o’clock next morning (9th June) four members of the committee of\ngeneral safety came to the Tower to make sure that the Prince was really\ndead.  When they were admitted to the death-chamber by Lasne and Damont\nthey affected the greatest indifference.  “The event is not of the least\nimportance,” they repeated, several times over; “the police commissary of\nthe section will come and receive the declaration of the decease; he will\nacknowledge it, and proceed to the interment without any ceremony; and\nthe committee will give the necessary directions.”  As they withdrew,\nsome officers of the Temple guard asked to see the remains of little\nCapet.  Damont having observed that the guard would not permit the bier\nto pass without its being opened, the deputies decided that the officers\nand non-commissioned officers of the guard going off duty, together with\nthose coming on, should be all invited to assure themselves of the\nchild’s death.  All having assembled in the room where the body lay, he\nasked them if they recognised it as that of the ex-Dauphin, son of the\nlast King of France.  Those who had seen the young Prince at the\nTuileries, or at the Temple (and most of them had), bore witness to its\nbeing the body of Louis XVII.  When they were come down into the council-\nroom, Darlot drew up the minutes of this attestation, which was signed by\na score of persons.  These minutes were inserted in the journal of the\nTemple tower, which was afterwards deposited in the office of the\nMinister of the Interior.",
        "During this visit the surgeons entrusted with the autopsy arrived at the\nouter gate of the Temple.  These were Dumangin, head physician of the\nHospice de l’Unite; Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de\nl’Humanite; Jeanroy, professor in the medical schools of Paris; and\nLaasus, professor of legal medicine at the Ecole de Sante of Paris.\nThe last two were selected by Dumangin and Pelletan because of the former\nconnection of M. Lassus with Mesdames de France, and of M. Jeanroy with\nthe House of Lorraine, which gave a peculiar weight to their signatures.\nGomin received them in the council-room, and detained them until the\nNational Guard, descending from the second floor, entered to sign the\nminutes prepared by Darlot.  This done, Lasne, Darlot, and Bouquet went\nup again with the surgeons, and introduced them into the apartment of\nLouis XVII., whom they at first examined as he lay on his death-bed; but\nM. Jeanroy observing that the dim light of this room was but little\nfavourable to the accomplishment of their mission, the commissaries\nprepared a table in the first room, near the window, on which the corpse\nwas laid, and the surgeons began their melancholy operation.",
        "At seven o’clock the police commissary ordered the body to be taken up,\nand that they should proceed to the cemetery.  It was the season of the\nlongest days, and therefore the interment did not take place in secrecy\nand at night, as some misinformed narrators have said or written; it took\nplace in broad daylight, and attracted a great concourse of people before\nthe gates of the Temple palace.  One of the municipals wished to have the\ncoffin carried out secretly by the door opening into the chapel\nenclosure; but M. Duaser, police commiasary, who was specially entrusted\nwith the arrangement of the ceremony, opposed this indecorous measure,\nand the procession passed out through the great gate.  The crowd that was\npressing round was kept back, and compelled to keep a line, by a\ntricoloured ribbon, held at short distances by gendarmes.  Compassion and\nsorrow were impressed on every countenance.",
        "A small detachment of the troops of the line from the garrison of Paris,\nsent by the authorities, was waiting to serve as an escort.  The bier,\nstill covered with the pall, was carried on a litter on the shoulders of\nfour men, who relieved each other two at a time; it was preceded by six\nor eight men, headed by a sergeant.  The procession was accompanied a\nlong way by the crowd, and a great number of persona followed it even to\nthe cemetery.  The name of “Little Capet,” and the more popular title of\nDauphin, spread from lip to lip, with exclamations of pity and\ncompassion.  The funeral entered the cemetery of Ste. Marguerite, not by\nthe church, as some accounts assert, but by the old gate of the cemetery.\nThe interment was made in the corner, on the left, at a distance of eight\nor nine feet from the enclosure wall, and at an equal distance from a\nsmall house, which subsequently served as a school.  The grave was filled\nup,–no mound marked its place, and not even a trace remained of the\ninterment!  Not till then did the commissaries of police and the\nmunicipality withdraw, and enter the house opposite the church to draw up\nthe declaration of interment.  It was nearly nine o’clock, and still\ndaylight.",

        "The last person to hear of the sad events in the Temple was the one for\nwhom they had the deepest and most painful interest.  After her brother’s\ndeath the captivity of Madame Royale was much lightened.  She was allowed\nto walk in the Temple gardens, and to receive visits from some ladies of\nthe old Court, and from Madame de Chantereine, who at last, after several\ntimes evading her questions, ventured cautiously to tell her of the\ndeaths of her mother, aunt, and brother.  Madame Royale wept bitterly,\nbut had much difficulty in expressing her feelings.  “She spoke so\nconfusedly,” says Madame de la Ramiere in a letter to Madame de Verneuil,\n\"that it was difficult to understand her.  It took her more than a\nmonth’s reading aloud, with careful study of pronunciation, to make\nherself intelligible,–so much had she lost the power of expression.\"\nShe was dressed with plainness amounting to poverty, and her hands were\ndisfigured by exposure to cold and by the menial work she had been so\nlong accustomed to do for herself, and which it was difficult to persuade\nher to leave off.  When urged to accept the services of an attendant, she\nreplied, with a sad prevision of the vicissitudes of her future life,\nthat she did not like to form a habit which she might have again to\nabandon.  She suffered herself, however, to be persuaded gradually to\nmodify her recluse and ascetic habits.  It was well she did so, as a\npreparation for the great changes about to follow.",
        "Nine days after the death of her brother, the city of Orleans interceded\nfor the daughter of Louis XVI., and sent deputies to the Convention to\npray for her deliverance and restoration to her family.  Names followed\nthis example; and Charette, on the part of the Vendeans, demanded, as a\ncondition of the pacification of La Vendee, that the Princess should be\nallowed to join her relations.  At length the Convention decreed that\nMadame Royale should be exchanged with Austria for the representatives\nand ministers whom Dumouriez had given up to the Prince of Cobourg,–\nDrouet, Semonville, Maret, and other prisoners of importance.  At\nmidnight on 19th December, 1795, which was her birthday, the Princess was\nreleased from prison, the Minister of the Interior, M. Benezech, to avoid\nattracting public attention and possible disturbance, conducting her on\nfoot from the Temple to a neighbouring street, where his carriage awaited\nher.  She made it her particular request that Gomin, who had been so\ndevoted to her brother, should be the commissary appointed to accompany\nher to the frontier; Madame de Soucy, formerly under-governess to the\nchildren of France, was also in attendance; and the Princess took with\nher a dog named Coco, which had belonged to Louis XVI.",
        "     [The mention of the little dog taken from the Temple by Madame\n     Royale reminds me how fond all the family were of these creatures.\n     Each Princess kept a different kind.  Mesdames had beautiful\n     spaniels; little grayhounds were preferred by Madame Elisabeth.\n     Louis XVI. was the only one of all his family who had no dogs in his\n     room.  I remember one day waiting in the great gallery for the\n     King’s retiring, when he entered with all his family and the whole\n     pack, who were escorting him.  All at once all the dogs began to\n     bark, one louder than another, and ran away, passing like ghosts\n     along those great dark rooms, which rang with their hoarse cries.\n     The Princesses shouting, calling them, running everywhere after\n     them, completed a ridiculous spectacle, which made those august\n     persons very merry.–D’HEZECQUES, p. 49.]",
        "She was frequently recognised on her way through France, and always with\nmarks of pleasure and respect.",
        "It might have been supposed that the Princess would rejoice to leave\nbehind her the country which had been the scene of so many horrors and\nsuch bitter suffering.  But it was her birthplace, and it held the graves\nof all she loved; and as she crossed the frontier she said to those\naround her, “I leave France with regret, for I shall never cease to\nconsider it my country.”  She arrived in Vienna on 9th January, 1796, and\nher first care was to attend a memorial service for her murdered\nrelatives.  After many weeks of close retirement she occasionally began\nto appear in public, and people looked with interest at the pale, grave,\nslender girl of seventeen, dressed in the deepest mourning, over whose\nyoung head such terrible storms had swept.  The Emperor wished her to\nmarry the Archduke Charles of Austria, but her father and mother had,\neven in the cradle, destined her hand for her cousin, the Duc\nd’Angouleme, son of the Comte d’Artois, and the memory of their lightest\nwish was law to her.",
        "Her quiet determination entailed anger and opposition amounting to\npersecution.  Every effort was made to alienate her from her French\nrelations.  She was urged to claim Provence, which had become her own if\nLouis XVIII.  was to be considered King of France.  A pressure of opinion\nwas brought to bear upon her which might well have overawed so young a\ngirl.  “I was sent for to the Emperor’s cabinet,” she writes, “where I\nfound the imperial family assembled.  The ministers and chief imperial\ncounsellors were also present .  .  .  .  When the Emperor invited me to\nexpress my opinion, I answered that to be able to treat fittingly of such\ninterests I thought, I ought to be surrounded not only by my mother’s\nrelatives, but also by those of my father .  .  .  .  Besides, I said,\nI was above all things French, and in entire subjection to the laws of\nFrance, which had rendered me alternately the subject of the King my\nfather, the King my brother, and the King my uncle, and that I would\nyield obedience to the latter, whatever might be his commands.  This\ndeclaration appeared very much to dissatisfy all who were present, and\nwhen they observed that I was not to be shaken, they declared that my\nright being independent of my will, my resistance would not be the\nslightest obstacle to the measures they might deem it necessary to adopt\nfor the preservation of my interests.”",
        "In their anxiety to make a German princess of Marie Therese, her imperial\nrelations suppressed her French title as much as possible.  When, with\nsome difficulty, the Duc de Grammont succeeded in obtaining an audience\nof her, and used the familiar form of address, she smiled faintly, and\nbade him beware.  “Call me Madame de Bretagne, or de Bourgogne, or de\nLorraine,” she said, “for here I am so identified with these provinces\n–[which the Emperor wished her to claim from her uncle Louis XVIII.]–\nthat I shall end in believing in my own transformation.”  After these\ndiscussions she was so closely watched, and so many restraints were\nimposed upon her, that she was scarcely less a prisoner than in the old\ndays of the Temple, though her cage was this time gilded.  Rescue,\nhowever, was at hand.",
        "In 1798 Louis XVIII. accepted a refuge offered to him at Mittau by the\nCzar Paul, who had promised that he would grant his guest’s first\nrequest, whatever it might be.  Louis begged the Czar to use his\ninfluence with the Court of Vienna to allow his niece to join him.\n\"Monsieur, my brother,” was Paul’s answer, “Madame Royale shall be\nrestored to you, or I shall cease to be Paul I.”  Next morning the Czar\ndespatched a courier to Vienna with a demand for the Princess, so\nenergetically worded that refusal must have been followed by war.\nAccordingly, in May, 1799, Madame Royale was allowed to leave the capital\nwhich she had found so uncongenial an asylum.",
        "In the old ducal castle of Mittau, the capital of Courland, Louis XVIII.\nand his wife, with their nephews, the Ducs d’Angouleme",
        "     [The Duc d’Angonleme was quiet and reserved.  He loved hunting as\n     means of killing time; was given to early hours and innocent\n     pleasures.  He was a gentleman, and brave as became one.  He had not\n     the “gentlemanly vices” of his brother, and was all the better for\n     it.  He was ill educated, but had natural good sense, and would have\n     passed for having more than that had he cared to put forth\n     pretensions.  Of all his family he was the one most ill spoken of,\n     and least deserving of it.–DOCTOR DORAN.]",
        "and de Berri, were awaiting her, attended by the Abbe Edgeworth, as chief\necclesiastic, and a little Court of refugee nobles and officers.  With\nthem were two men of humbler position, who must have been even more\nwelcome to Madame Royale,–De Malden, who had acted as courier to Louis\nXVI. during the flight to Varennes, and Turgi, who had waited on the\nPrincesses in the Temple.  It was a sad meeting, though so long anxiously\ndesired, and it was followed on 10th June, 1799, by an equally sad\nwedding,–exiles, pensioners on the bounty of the Russian monarch,\nfulfilling an engagement founded, not on personal preference, but on\nfamily policy and reverence for the wishes of the dead, the bride and\nbridegroom had small cause for rejoicing.  During the eighteen months of\ntranquil seclusion which followed her marriage, the favourite occupation\nof the Duchess was visiting and relieving the poor.  In January, 1801,\nthe Czar Paul, in compliance with the demand of Napoleon, who was just\nthen the object of his capricious enthusiasm, ordered the French royal\nfamily to leave Mittau.  Their wanderings commenced on the 21st, a day of\nbitter memories; and the young Duchess led the King to his carriage\nthrough a crowd of men, women, and children, whose tears and blessings\nattended them on their way.",
        "     [The Queen was too ill to travel.  The Duc d’Angouleme took another\n     route to join a body of French gentlemen in arms for the Legitimist\n     cause.]",
        "The exiles asked permission from the King of Prussia to settle in his\ndominions, and while awaiting his answer at Munich they were painfully\nsurprised by the entrance of five old soldiers of noble birth, part of\nthe body-guard they had left behind at Mittau, relying on the protection\nof Paul.  The “mad Czar” had decreed their immediate expulsion, and,\npenniless and almost starving, they made their way to Louis XVIII.  All\nthe money the royal family possessed was bestowed on these faithful\nservants, who came to them in detachments for relief, and then the\nDuchess offered her diamonds to the Danish consul for an advance of two\nthousand ducats, saying she pledged her property “that in our common\ndistress it may be rendered of real use to my uncle, his faithful\nservants, and myself.”  The Duchess’s consistent and unselfish kindness\nprocured her from the King, and those about him who knew her best, the\nname of “our angel.”",
        "Warsaw was for a brief time the resting-place of the wanderers, but there\nthey were disturbed in 1803 by Napoleon’s attempt to threaten and bribe\nLouis XVIII. into abdication.  It was suggested that refusal might bring\nupon them expulsion from Prussia.  “We are accustomed to suffering,” was\nthe King’s answer, “and we do not dread poverty.  I would, trusting in\nGod, seek another asylum.”  In 1808, after many changes of scene, this\nasylum was sought in England, Gosfield Hall, Essex, being placed at their\ndisposal by the Marquis of Buckingham.  From Gosfield, the King moved to\nHartwell Hall, a fine old Elizabethan mansion rented from Sir George Lee\nfor L 500 a year.  A yearly grant of L 24,000 was made to the exiled\nfamily by the British Government, out of which a hundred and forty\npersons were supported, the royal dinner-party generally numbering two\ndozen.",
        "At Hartwell, as in her other homes, the Duchess was most popular amongst\nthe poor.  In general society she was cold and reserved, and she disliked\nthe notice of strangers.  In March, 1814, the royalist successes at\nBordeaux paved the way for the restoration of royalty in France, and\namidst general sympathy and congratulation, with the Prince Regent\nhimself to wish them good fortune, the King, the Duchess, and their suite\nleft Hartwell in April, 1814.  The return to France was as triumphant as\na somewhat half-hearted and doubtful enthusiasm could make it, and most\nof such cordiality as there was fell to the share of the Duchess.  As she\npassed to Notre-Dame in May, 1814, on entering Paris, she was\nvociferously greeted.  The feeling of loyalty, however, was not much\nlonger-lived than the applause by which it was expressed; the Duchess had\nscarcely effected one of the strongest wishes of her heart,–the\nidentification of what remained of her parents’ bodies, and the\nmagnificent ceremony with which they were removed from the cemetery of\nthe Madeleine to the Abbey of St. Denis,–when the escape of Napoleon\nfrom Elba in February,1815, scattered the royal family and their\nfollowers like chaff before the wind.  The Duc d’Angouleme, compelled to\ncapitulate at Toulouse, sailed from Cette in a Swedish vessel.  The Comte\nd’Artois, the Duc de Berri, and the Prince de Conde withdrew beyond the\nfrontier.  The King fled from the capital.  The Duchesse d’Angouleme,\nthen at Bordeaux celebrating the anniversary of the Proclamation of Louis\nXVIII., alone of all her family made any stand against the general panic.\nDay after day she mounted her horse and reviewed the National Guard.  She\nmade personal and even passionate appeals to the officers and men,\nstanding firm, and prevailing on a handful of soldiers to remain by her,\neven when the imperialist troops were on the other side of the river and\ntheir cannon were directed against the square where the Duchess was\nreviewing her scanty followers.",
        "     [\"It was the Duchesse d’Angouleme who saved you,” said the gallant\n     General Clauzel, after these events, to a royalist volunteer;\n     “I could not bring myself to order such a woman to be fired upon,\n     at the moment when she was providing material for the noblest page\n     in her history.\"–\"Fillia Dolorosa,” vol. vii., p. 131.]",
        "With pain and difficulty she was convinced that resistance was vain;\nNapoleon’s banner soon floated over Bordeaux; the Duchess issued a\nfarewell proclamation to her “brave Bordelais,” and on the 1st April,\n1815, she started for Pouillac, whence she embarked for Spain.  During a\nbrief visit to England she heard that the reign of a hundred days was\nover, and the 27th of July, 1815, saw her second triumphal return to the\nTuileries.  She did not take up her abode there with any wish for State\nceremonies or Court gaieties.  Her life was as secluded as her position\nwould allow.  Her favourite retreat was the Pavilion, which had been\ninhabited by her mother, and in her little oratory she collected relics\nof her family, over which on the anniversaries of their deaths she wept\nand prayed.  In her daily drives through Paris she scrupulously avoided\nthe spot on which they had suffered; and the memory of the past seemed to\nrule all her sad and self-denying life, both in what she did and what she\nrefrained from doing.",
        "     [She was so methodical and economical, though liberal in her\n     charities, that one of her regular evening occupations was to tear\n     off the seals from the letters she had received during the day, in\n     order that the wax might be melted down and sold; the produce made\n     one poor family “passing rich with forty pounds a year.\"–See “Filia\n     Dolorosa,” vol. ii., p. 239.]",
        "Her somewhat austere goodness was not of a nature to make her popular.\nThe few who really understood her loved her, but the majority of her\npleasure-seeking subjects regarded her either with ridicule or dread.\nShe is said to have taken no part in politics, and to have exerted no\ninfluence in public affairs, but her sympathies were well known, and “the\nvery word liberty made her shudder;” like Madame Roland, she had seen “so\nmany crimes perpetrated under that name.”",
        "The claims of three pretended Dauphins–Hervagault, the son of the tailor\nof St. Lo; Bruneau, son of the shoemaker of Vergin; and Naundorf or\nNorndorff, the watchmaker somewhat troubled her peace, but never for a\nmoment obtained her sanction.  Of the many other pseudo-Dauphins (said to\nnumber a dozen and a half) not even the names remain.  In February,1820,\na fresh tragedy befell the royal family in the assassination of the Duc\nde Berri, brother-in-law of the Duchesse d’Angouleme, as he was seeing\nhis wife into her carriage at the door of the Opera-house.  He was\ncarried into the theatre, and there the dying Prince and his wife were\njoined by the Duchess, who remained till he breathed his last, and was\npresent when he, too, was laid in the Abbey of St. Denis.  She was\npresent also when his son, the Duc de Bordeaux, was born, and hoped that\nshe saw in him a guarantee for the stability of royalty in France.  In\nSeptember, 1824, she stood by the death-bed of Louis XVIII., and\nthenceforward her chief occupation was directing the education of the\nlittle Duc de Bordeaux, who generally resided with her at Villeneuve\nl’Etang, her country house near St.  Cloud.  Thence she went in July,\n1830, to the Baths of Vichy, stopping at Dijon on her way to Paris, and\nvisiting the theatre on the evening of the 27th.  She was received with\n\"a roar of execrations and seditious cries,” and knew only too well what\nthey signified.  She instantly left the theatre and proceeded to Tonnere,\nwhere she received news of the rising in Paris, and, quitting the town by\nnight, was driven to Joigny with three attendants.  Soon after leaving\nthat place it was thought more prudent that the party should separate and\nproceed on foot, and the Duchess and M. de Foucigny, disguised as\npeasants, entered Versailles arm-in-arm, to obtain tidings of the King.\nThe Duchess found him at Rambouillet with her husband, the Dauphin, and\nthe King met her with a request for “pardon,” being fully conscious, too\nlate, that his unwise decrees and his headlong flight had destroyed the\nlast hopes of his family.  The act of abdication followed, by which the\nprospect of royalty passed from the Dauphin and his wife, as well as from\nCharles X.–Henri V. being proclaimed King, and the Duc d’Orleans (who\nrefused to take the boy monarch under his personal protection)\nlieutenant-general of the kingdom.",
        "Then began the Duchess’s third expatriation.  At Cherbourg the royal\nfamily, accompanied by the little King without a kingdom, embarked in the\n’Great Britain’, which stood out to sea.  The Duchess, remaining on deck\nfor a last look at the coast of France, noticed a brig which kept, she\nthought, suspiciously near them.",
        "“Who commands that vessel?” she inquired.",
        "“Captain Thibault.”",
        "And what are his orders?”",
        "“To fire into and sink the vessels in which we sail, should any attempt\nbe made to return to France.”",
        "Such was the farewell of their subjects to the House of Bourbon.  The\nfugitives landed at Weymouth; the Duchesse d’Angouleme under the title of\nComtesse de Marne, the Duchesse de Berri as Comtesse de Rosny, and her\nson, Henri de Bordeaux, as Comte de Chambord, the title he retained till\nhis death, originally taken from the estate presented to him in infancy\nby his enthusiastic people.  Holyrood, with its royal and gloomy\nassociations, was their appointed dwelling.  The Duc and Duchesse\nd’Angouleme, and the daughter of the Duc de Berri, travelled thither by\nland, the King and the young Comte de Chambord by sea.  “I prefer my\nroute to that of my sister,” observed the latter, “because I shall see the\ncoast of France again, and she will not.”",
        "The French Government soon complained that at Holyrood the exiles were\nstill too near their native land, and accordingly, in 1832, Charles X.,\nwith his son and grandson, left Scotland for Hamburg, while the Duchesse\nd’Angouleme and her niece repaired to Vienna.  The family were reunited\nat Prague in 1833, where the birthday of the Comte de Chambord was\ncelebrated with some pomp and rejoicing, many Legitimists flocking\nthither to congratulate him on attaining the age of thirteen, which the\nold law of monarchical France had fixed as the majority of her princes.\nThree years later the wanderings of the unfortunate family recommenced;\nthe Emperor Francis II. was dead, and his successor, Ferdinand, must\nvisit Prague to be crowned, and Charles X. feared that the presence of a\ndiscrowned monarch might be embarrassing on such an occasion.  Illness\nand sorrow attended the exiles on their new journey, and a few months\nafter they were established in the Chateau of Graffenburg at Goritz,\nCharles X. died of cholera, in his eightieth year.  At Goritz, also, on\nthe 31st May, 1844, the Duchesse d’Angouleme, who had sat beside so many\ndeath-beds, watched over that of her husband.  Theirs had not been a\nmarriage of affection in youth, but they respected each other’s virtues,\nand to a great extent shared each other’s tastes; banishment and\nsuffering had united them very closely, and of late years they had been\nalmost inseparable,–walking, riding, and reading together.  When the\nDuchesse d’Angouleme had seen her husband laid by his father’s side in\nthe vault of the Franciscan convent, she, accompanied by her nephew and\nniece, removed to Frohsdorf, where they spent seven tranquil years.  Here\nshe was addressed as “Queen” by her household for the first time in her\nlife, but she herself always recognised Henri, Comte de Chambord, as her\nsovereign.  The Duchess lived to see the overthrow of Louis Philippe, the\nusurper of the inheritance of her family.  Her last attempt to exert\nherself was a characteristic one.  She tried to rise from a sick-bed in\norder to attend the memorial service held for her mother, Marie\nAntoinette, on the 16th October, the anniversary of her execution.  But\nher strength was not equal to the task; on the 19th she expired, with her\nhand in that of the Comte de Chambord, and on 28th October, 1851, Marie\nTherese Charlotte, Duchesse d’Angouleme, was buried in the Franciscan\nconvent.",
        "                        The Ceremony of Expiation.",
        "“In the spring of 1814 a ceremony took place in Paris at which I was\npresent because there was nothing in it that could be mortifying to a\nFrench heart.  The death of Louis XVI.  had long been admitted to be one\nof the most serious misfortunes of the Revolution.  The Emperor Napoleon\nnever spoke of that sovereign but in terms of the highest respect, and\nalways prefixed the epithet unfortunate to his name.  The ceremony to\nwhich I allude was proposed by the Emperor of Russia and the King of\nPrussia.  It consisted of a kind of expiation and purification of the\nspot on which Louis XVI. and his Queen were beheaded.  I went to see the\nceremony, and I had a place at a window in the Hotel of Madame de\nRemusat, next to the Hotel de Crillon, and what was termed the Hotel de\nCourlande.",
        "“The expiation took place on the 10th of April.  The weather was\nextremely fine and warm for the season.  The Emperor of Russia and King\nof Prussia, accompanied by Prince Schwartzenberg, took their station at\nthe entrance of the Rue Royale; the King of Prussia being on the right of\nthe Emperor Alexander, and Prince Schwartzenberg on his left.  There was\na long parade, during which the Russian, Prussian and Austrian military\nbands vied with each other in playing the air, ’Vive Henri IV.!’\nThe cavalry defiled past, and then withdrew into the Champs Elysees;\nbut the infantry ranged themselves round an altar which was raised in the\nmiddle of the Place, and which was elevated on a platform having twelve\nor fifteen steps.  The Emperor of Russia alighted from his horse, and,\nfollowed by the King of Prussia, the Grand Duke Constantine, Lord\nCathcart, and Prince Schwartzenberg, advanced to the altar.  When the\nEmperor had nearly reached the altar the “Te Deum” commenced.  At the\nmoment of the benediction, the sovereigns and persons who accompanied\nthem, as well as the twenty-five thousand troops who covered the Place,\nall knelt down.  The Greek priest presented the cross to the Emperor\nAlexander, who kissed it; his example was followed by the individuals who\naccompanied him, though they were not of the Greek faith.  On rising, the\nGrand Duke Constantine took off his hat, and immediately salvoes of\nartillery were heard.”",
