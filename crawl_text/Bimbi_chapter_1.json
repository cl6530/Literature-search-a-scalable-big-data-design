        "August lived in a little town called Hall. Hall is a favorite name\nfor several towns in Austria and in Germany; but this one especial\nlittle Hall, in the Upper Innthal, is one of the most charming\nOld-World places that I know, and August, for his part, did not\nknow any other. It has the green meadows and the great mountains\nall about it, and the gray-green glacier-fed water rushes by it.\nIt has paved streets and enchanting little shops that have all\nlatticed panes and iron gratings to them; it has a very grand old\nGothic church, that has the noblest blendings of light and shadow,\nand marble tombs of dead knights, and a look of infinite strength\nand repose as a church should have. Then there is the Muntze\nTower, black and white, rising out of greenery, and looking down\non a long wooden bridge and the broad rapid river; and there is an\nold schloss which has been made into a guardhouse, with\nbattlements and frescos and heraldic devices in gold and colors,\nand a man-at-arms carved in stone standing life-size in his niche\nand bearing his date 1530. A little farther on, but close at hand,\nis a cloister with beautiful marble columns and tombs, and a\ncolossal wood-carved Calvary, and beside that a small and very\nrich chapel; indeed, so full is the little town of the undisturbed\npast, that to walk in it is like opening a missal of the Middle\nAges, all emblazoned and illuminated with saints and warriors, and\nit is so clean, and so still, and so noble, by reason of its\nmonuments and its historic color, that I marvel much no one has\never cared to sing its praises. The old pious, heroic life of an\nage at once more restful and more brave than ours still leaves its\nspirit there, and then there is the girdle of the mountains all\naround, and that alone means strength, peace, majesty.",
        "In this little town a few years ago August Strehla lived with his\npeople in the stone-paved, irregular square where the grand church\nstands.",
        "He was a small boy of nine years at that time,–a chubby-faced\nlittle man with rosy cheeks, big hazel eyes, and clusters of curls\nthe brown of ripe nuts. His mother was dead, his father was poor,\nand there were many mouths at home to feed. In this country the\nwinters are long and very cold; the whole land lies wrapped in\nsnow for many months; and this night that he was trotting home,\nwith a jug of beer in his numb red hands, was terribly cold and\ndreary. The good burghers of Hall had shut their double shutters,\nand the few lamps there were flickered dully behind their quaint,\nold-fashioned iron casings. The mountains indeed were beautiful,\nall snow-white under the stars that are so big in frost. Hardly\nany one was astir; a few good souls wending home from vespers, a\ntired post-boy, who blew a shrill blast from his tasseled horn as\nhe pulled up his sledge before a hostelry, and little August\nhugging his jug of beer to his ragged sheepskin coat, were all who\nwere abroad, for the snow fell heavily and the good folks of Hall\ngo early to their beds. He could not run, or he would have spilled\nthe beer; he was half frozen and a little frightened, but he kept\nup his courage by saying over and over again to himself, “I shall\nsoon be at home with dear Hirschvogel.”",
        "He went on through the streets, past the stone man-at-arms of the\nguardhouse, and so into the place where the great church was, and\nwhere near it stood his father Karl Strehla’s house, with a\nsculptured Bethlehem over the doorway, and the Pilgrimage of the\nThree Kings painted on its wall. He had been sent on a long errand\noutside the gates in the afternoon, over the frozen fields and the\nbroad white snow, and had been belated, and had thought he had\nheard the wolves behind him at every step, and had reached the\ntown in a great state of terror, thankful with all his little\npanting heart to see the oil lamp burning under the first house\nshrine. But he had not forgotten to call for the beer, and he\ncarried it carefully now, though his hands were so numb that he\nwas afraid they would let the jug down every moment.",
        "The snow outlined with white every gable and cornice of the\nbeautiful old wooden houses; the moonlight shone on the gilded\nsigns, the lambs, the grapes, the eagles, and all the quaint\ndevices that hung before the doors; covered lamps burned before\nthe Nativities and Crucifixions painted on the walls or let into\nthe woodwork; here and there, where a shutter had not been closed,\na ruddy fire-light lit up a homely interior, with a noisy band of\nchildren clustering round the house-mother and a big brown loaf,\nor some gossips spinning and listening to the cobbler’s or the\nbarber’s story of a neighbor, while the oil wicks glimmered, and\nthe hearth logs blazed, and the chestnuts sputtered in their iron\nroasting pot. Little August saw all these things, as he saw\neverything with his two big bright eyes, that had such curious\nlights and shadows in them; but he went needfully on his way for\nthe sake of the beer which a single slip of the foot would make\nhim spill. At his knock and call the solid oak door, four\ncenturies old if one, flew open, and the boy darted in with his\nbeer and shouted with all the force of mirthful lungs: “Oh, dear\nHirschvogel, but for the thought of you I should have died!”",
        "It was a large barren room into which he rushed with so much\npleasure, and the bricks were bare and uneven. It had a walnut-\nwood press, handsome and very old, a broad deal table, and several\nwooden stools, for all its furniture; but at the top of the\nchamber, sending out warmth and color together as the lamp shed\nits rays upon it, was a tower of porcelain, burnished with all the\nhues of a king’s peacock and a queen’s jewels, and surmounted with\narmed figures, and shields, and flowers of heraldry, and a great\ngolden crown upon the highest summit of all.",
        "It was a stove of 1532, and on it were the letters H. R. H., for\nit was in every portion the handwork of the great potter of\nNurnberg, Augustin Hirschvogel, who put his mark thus, as all the\nworld knows.",
        "The stove, no doubt, had stood in palaces and been made for\nprinces, had warmed the crimson stockings of cardinals and the\ngold-broidered shoes of archduchesses, had glowed in presence-\nchambers and lent its carbon to help kindle sharp brains in\nanxious councils of state; no one knew what it had seen or done or\nbeen fashioned for; but it was a right royal thing. Yet perhaps it\nhad never been more useful than it was now in this poor, desolate\nroom, sending down heat and comfort into the troop of children\ntumbled together on a wolfskin at its feet, who received frozen\nAugust among them with loud shouts of joy.",
        "“Oh, dear Hirschvogel, I am so cold, so cold!” said August,\nkissing its gilded lion’s claws. “Is father not in, Dorothea?”",
        "“No, dear. He is late.”",
        "Dorothea was a girl of seventeen, dark-haired and serious, and\nwith a sweet sad face, for she had had many cares laid on her\nshoulders, even whilst still a mere baby. She was the eldest of\nthe Strehla family; and there were ten of them in all. Next to her\nthere came Jan and Karl and Otho, big lads, gaining a little for\ntheir own living; and then came August, who went up in the summer\nto the high alps with the farmers’ cattle, but in winter could do\nnothing to fill his own little platter and pot; and then all the\nlittle ones, who could only open their mouths to be fed like young\nbirds,–Albrecht and Hilda, and Waldo and Christof, and last of\nall little three-year-old Ermengilda, with eyes like forget-me-\nnots, whose birth had cost them the life of their mother.",
        "They were of that mixed race, half Austrian, half Italian, so\ncommon in the Tyrol; some of the children were white and golden as\nlilies, others were brown and brilliant as fresh fallen chestnuts.\nThe father was a good man, but weak and weary with so many to find\nfor and so little to do it with. He worked at the salt furnaces,\nand by that gained a few florins; people said he would have worked\nbetter and kept his family more easily if he had not loved his\npipe and a draught of ale too well; but this had only been said of\nhim after his wife’s death, when trouble and perplexity had begun\nto dull a brain never too vigorous, and to enfeeble further a\ncharacter already too yielding. As it was, the wolf often bayed at\nthe door of the Strehla household, without a wolf from the\nmountains coming down.",
        "Dorothea was one of those maidens who almost work miracles, so far\ncan their industry and care and intelligence make a home sweet and\nwholesome and a single loaf seem to swell into twenty. The\nchildren were always clean and happy, and the table was seldom\nwithout its big pot of soup once a day. Still, very poor they\nwere, and Dorothea’s heart ached with shame, for she knew that\ntheir father’s debts were many for flour and meat and clothing. Of\nfuel to feed the big stove they had always enough without cost,\nfor their mother’s father was alive, and sold wood and fir cones\nand coke, and never grudged them to his grandchildren, though he\ngrumbled at Strehla’s improvidence and hapless, dreamy ways.",
        "“Father says we are never to wait for him; we will have supper,\nnow you have come home, dear,” said Dorothea, who, however she\nmight fret her soul in secret as she knitted their hose and mended\ntheir shirts, never let her anxieties cast a gloom on the\nchildren; only to August she did speak a little sometimes, because\nhe was so thoughtful and so tender of her always, and knew as well\nas she did that there were troubles about money,–though these\ntroubles were vague to them both, and the debtors were patient and\nkindly, being neighbors all in the old twisting streets between\nthe guardhouse and the river.",
        "Supper was a huge bowl of soup, with big slices of brown bread\nswimming in it and some onions bobbing up and down; the bowl was\nsoon emptied by ten wooden spoons, and then the three eldest boys\nslipped off to bed, being tired with their rough bodily labor in\nthe snow all day, and Dorothea drew her spinning-wheel by the\nstove and set it whirring, and the little ones got August down\nupon the old worn wolfskin and clamored to him for a picture or a\nstory. For August was the artist of the family.",
        "He had a piece of planed deal that his father had given him, and\nsome sticks of charcoal, and he would draw a hundred things he had\nseen in the day, sweeping each out with his elbow when the\nchildren had seen enough of it, and sketching another in its\nstead,–faces and dogs’ heads, and men in sledges, and old women\nin their furs, and pine trees, and cocks and hens, and all sorts\nof animals, and now and then–very reverently–a Madonna and\nChild. It was all very rough, for there was no one to teach him\nanything. But it was all lifelike, and kept the whole troop of\nchildren shrieking with laughter, or watching breathless, with\nwide open, wondering, awed eyes.",
        "They were all so happy; what did they care for the snow outside?\nTheir little bodies were warm, and their hearts merry; even\nDorothea, troubled about the bread for the morrow, laughed as she\nspun; and August, with all his soul in his work, and little rosy\nErmengilda’s cheek on his shoulder, glowing after his frozen\nafternoon, cried out loud, smiling, as he looked up at the stove\nthat was shedding its heat down on them all:–",
        "“Oh, dear Hirschvogel! you are almost as great and good as the\nsun! No; you are greater and better, I think, because he goes away\nnobody knows where all these long, dark, cold hours, and does not\ncare how people die for want of him; but you–you are always\nready; just a little bit of wood to feed you, and you will make a\nsummer for us all the winter through!”",
        "The grand old stove seemed to smile through all its iridescent\nsurface at the praises of the child. No doubt the stove, though it\nhad known three centuries and more, had known but very little\ngratitude.",
        "It was one of those magnificent stoves in enameled faience which\nso excited the jealousy of the other potters of Nurnberg that in a\nbody they demanded of the magistracy that Augustin Hirschvogel\nshould be forbidden to make any more of them,–the magistracy,\nhappily, proving of a broader mind, and having no sympathy with\nthe wish of the artisans to cripple their greater fellow.",
        "It was of great height and breadth, with all the majolica luster\nwhich Hirschvogel learned to give to his enamels when he was\nmaking love to the young Venetian girl whom he afterwards married.\nThere was the statue of a king at each corner, modeled with as\nmuch force and splendor as his friend Albrecht Durer could have\ngiven unto them on copperplate or canvas. The body of the stove\nitself was divided into panels, which had the Ages of Man painted\non them in polychrome; the borders of the panels had roses and\nholly and laurel and other foliage, and German mottoes in black\nletter of odd Old World moralizing, such as the old Teutons, and\nthe Dutch after them, love to have on their chimney-places and\ntheir drinking cups, their dishes and flagons. The whole was\nburnished with gilding in many parts, and was radiant everywhere\nwith that brilliant coloring of which the Hirschvogel family,\npainters on glass and great in chemistry, as they were, were all\nmasters.",
        "The stove was a very grand thing, as I say; possibly Hirschvogel\nhad made it for some mighty lord of the Tyrol at that time when he\nwas an imperial guest at Innspruck, and fashioned so many things\nfor the Schloss Amras and beautiful Philippine Welser, the\nburgher’s daughter, who gained an archduke’s heart by her beauty\nand the right to wear his honors by her wit. Nothing was known of\nthe stove at this latter day in Hall. The grandfather Strehla, who\nhad been a master-mason, had dug it up out of some ruins where he\nwas building, and, finding it without a flaw, had taken it home,\nand only thought it worth finding because it was such a good one\nto burn. That was now sixty years past, and ever since then the\nstove had stood in the big, desolate, empty room, warming three\ngenerations of the Strehla family, and having seen nothing\nprettier, perhaps, in all its many years than the children tumbled\nnow in a cluster like gathered flowers at its feet. For the\nStrehla children, born to nothing else, were all born with beauty;\nwhite or brown, they were equally lovely to look upon, and when\nthey went into the church to Mass, with their curling locks and\ntheir clasped hands, they stood under the grim statues like\ncherubs flown down off some fresco.",
        "“Tell us a story, August,” they cried in chorus, when they had\nseen charcoal pictures till they were tired; and August did as he\ndid every night pretty nearly–looked up at the stove and told\nthem what he imagined of the many adventures and joys and sorrows\nof the human being who figured on the panels from his cradle to\nhis grave.",
        "To the children the stove was a household god. In summer they laid\na mat of fresh moss all round it, and dressed it up with green\nboughs and the numberless beautiful wild flowers of the Tyrol\ncountry. In winter all their joys centered in it, and scampering\nhome from school over the ice and snow they were happy, knowing\nthat they would soon be cracking nuts or roasting chestnuts in the\nbroad ardent glow of its noble tower, which rose eight feet high\nabove them with all its spires and pinnacles and crowns.",
        "Once a traveling peddler had told them that the letters on it\nmeant Augustin Hirschvogel, and that Hirschvogel had been a great\nGerman potter and painter, like his father before him, in the art-\nsanctified city of Nurnberg, and had made many such stoves, that\nwere all miracles of beauty and of workmanship, putting all his\nheart and his soul and his faith into his labors, as the men of\nthose earlier ages did, and thinking but little of gold or praise.",
        "An old trader, too, who sold curiosities not far from the church,\nhad told August a little more about the brave family of\nHirschvogel, whose houses can be seen in Nuremberg to this day; of\nold Veit, the first of them, who painted the Gothic windows of St.\nSebald with the marriage of the margravine; of his sons and of his\ngrand-sons, potters, painters, engravers all, and chief of them\ngreat Augustin, the Luca della Robbia of the North. And August’s\nimagination, always quick, had made a living personage out of\nthese few records, and saw Hirschvogel as though he were in the\nflesh walking up and down the Maximilian-Strass in his visit to\nInnspruck, and maturing beautiful things in his brain as he stood\non the bridge and gazed on the emerald green flood of the Inn.",
        "So the stove had got to be called Hirschvogel in the family, as if\nit were a living creature, and little August was very proud\nbecause he had been named after that famous old dead German who\nhad had the genius to make so glorious a thing. All the children\nloved the stove, but with August the love of it was a passion;\nand in his secret heart he used to say to himself, “When I am a\nman, I will make just such things too, and then I will set\nHirschvogel in a beautiful room in a house that I will build\nmyself in Innspruck just outside the gates, where the chestnuts\nare, by the river; that is what I will do when I am a man.”",
        "For August, a salt baker’s son and a little cow-keeper when he was\nanything, was a dreamer of dreams, and when he was upon the high\nalps with his cattle, with the stillness and the sky around him,\nwas quite certain that he would live for greater things than\ndriving the herds up when the springtide came among the blue sea\nof gentians, or toiling down in the town with wood and with timber\nas his father and grandfather did every day of their lives. He was\na strong and healthy little fellow, fed on the free mountain air,\nand he was very happy, and loved his family devotedly, and was as\nactive as a squirrel and as playful as a hare; but he kept his\nthoughts to himself, and some of them went a very long way for a\nlittle boy who was only one among many, and to whom nobody had\never paid any attention except to teach him his letters and tell\nhim to fear God. August in winter was only a little, hungry\nschoolboy, trotting to be catechised by the priest, or to bring\nthe loaves from the bakehouse, or to carry his father’s boots to\nthe cobbler; and in summer he was only one of hundreds of cowboys,\nwho drove the poor, half-blind, blinking, stumbling cattle,\nringing their throat bells, out into the sweet intoxication of the\nsudden sunlight, and lived up with them in the heights among the\nAlpine roses, with only the clouds and the snow summits near. But\nhe was always thinking, thinking, thinking, for all that; and\nunder his little sheepskin winter coat and his rough hempen summer\nshirt his heart had as much courage in it as Hofer’s ever had,–\ngreat Hofer, who is a household word in all the Innthal, and whom\nAugust always reverently remembered when he went to the city of\nInnspruck and ran out by the foaming water mill and under the\nwooded height of Berg Isel.",
        "August lay now in the warmth of the stove and told the children\nstories, his own little brown face growing red with excitement as\nhis imagination glowed to fever heat. That human being on the\npanels, who was drawn there as a baby in a cradle, as a boy\nplaying among flowers, as a lover sighing under a casement, as a\nsoldier in the midst of strife, as a father with children round\nhim, as a weary, old, blind man on crutches, and, lastly, as a\nransomed soul raised up by angels, had always had the most intense\ninterest for August, and he had made, not one history for him, but\na thousand; he seldom told them the same tale twice. He had never\nseen a storybook in his life; his primer and his Mass book were\nall the volumes he had. But nature had given him Fancy, and she is\na good fairy that makes up for the want of very many things!\nonly, alas! her wings are so very soon broken, poor thing! and\nthen she is of no use at all.",
        "“It is time for you all to go to bed, children,” said Dorothea,\nlooking up from her spinning. “Father is very late to-night; you\nmust not sit up for him.”",
        "“Oh, five minutes more, dear Dorothea!” they pleaded; and little\nrosy and golden Ermengilda climbed up into her lap. “Hirschvogel\nis so warm, the beds are never so warm as he. Cannot you tell us\nanother tale, August?”",
        "“No,” cried August, whose face had lost its light, now that his\nstory had come to an end, and who sat serious, with his hands\nclasped on his knees, gazing on to the luminous arabesques of the\nstove.",
        "“It is only a week to Christmas,” he said suddenly.",
        "“Grandmother’s big cakes!” chuckled little Christof, who was five\nyears old, and thought Christmas meant a big cake and nothing\nelse.",
        "“What will Santa Claus find for ’Gilda if she be good?” murmured\nDorothea over the child’s sunny head; for, however hard poverty\nmight pinch, it could never pinch so tightly that Dorothea would\nnot find some wooden toy and some rosy apples to put in her little\nsister’s socks.",
        "“Father Max has promised me a big goose, because I saved the\ncalf’s life in June,” said August; it was the twentieth time he\nhad told them so that month, he was so proud of it.",
        "“And Aunt Maila will be sure to send us wine and honey and a\nbarrel of flour; she always does,” said Albrecht. Their Aunt Maila\nhad a chalet and a little farm over on the green slopes towards\nDorp Ampas.",
        "“I shall go up into the woods and get Hirschvogel’s crown,” said\nAugust; they always crowned Hirschvogel for Christmas with pine\nboughs and ivy and mountain berries. The heat soon withered the\ncrown; but it was part of the religion of the day to them, as much\nso as it was to cross themselves in church and raise their voices\nin the “O Salutaris Hostia.”",
        "And they fell chatting of all they would do on the Christ-night,\nand one little voice piped loud against another’s, and they were\nas happy as though their stockings would be full of golden purses\nand jeweled toys, and the big goose in the soup pot seemed to them\nsuch a meal as kings would envy.",
        "In the midst of their chatter and laughter a blast of frozen air\nand a spray of driven snow struck like ice through the room, and\nreached them even in the warmth of the old wolfskins and the great\nstove. It was the door which had opened and let in the cold; it\nwas their father who had come home.",
        "The younger children ran joyous to meet him. Dorothea pushed the\none wooden armchair of the room to the stove, and August flew to\nset the jug of beer on a little round table, and fill a long clay\npipe; for their father was good to them all, and seldom raised his\nvoice in anger, and they had been trained by the mother they had\nloved to dutifulness and obedience and a watchful affection.",
        "To-night Karl Strehla responded very wearily to the young ones’\nwelcome, and came to the wooden chair with a tired step and sat\ndown heavily, not noticing either pipe or beer.",
        "“Are you not well, dear father?” his daughter asked him.",
        "“I am well enough,” he answered dully, and sat there with his head\nbent, letting the lighted pipe grow cold.",
        "He was a fair, tall man, gray before his time, and bowed with\nlabor.",
        "“Take the children to bed,” he said suddenly, at last, and\nDorothea obeyed. August stayed behind, curled before the stove; at\nnine years old, and when one earns money in the summer from the\nfarmers, one is not altogether a child any more, at least in one’s\nown estimation.",
        "August did not heed his father’s silence; he was used to it. Karl\nStrehla was a man of few words, and, being of weakly health, was\nusually too tired at the end of the day to do more than drink his\nbeer and sleep. August lay on the wolfskin, dreamy and comfortable,\nlooking up through his drooping eyelids at the golden coronets on\nthe crest of the great stove, and wondering for the millionth time\nwhom it had been made for, and what grand places and scenes it had\nknown.",
        "Dorothea came down from putting the little ones in their beds; the\ncuckoo clock in the corner struck eight; she looked to her father\nand the untouched pipe, then sat down to her spinning, saying\nnothing. She thought he had been drinking in some tavern; it had\nbeen often so with him of late.",
        "There was a long silence; the cuckoo called the quarter twice;\nAugust dropped to sleep, his curls falling over his face;\nDorothea’s wheel hummed like a cat.",
        "Suddenly Karl Strehla struck his hand on the table, sending the\npipe on the ground.",
        "“I have sold Hirschvogel,” he said; and his voice was husky and\nashamed in his throat. The spinning wheel stopped. August sprang\nerect out of his sleep.",
        "“Sold Hirschvogel!” If their father had dashed the holy crucifix\non the floor at their feet and spat on it, they could not have\nshuddered under the horror of a greater blasphemy.",
        "“I have sold Hirschvogel!” said Karl Strehla in the same husky,\ndogged voice. “I have sold it to a traveling trader in such things\nfor two hundred florins. What would you?–I owe double that. He\nsaw it this morning when you were all out. He will pack it and\ntake it to Munich to-morrow.”",
        "Dorothea gave a low, shrill cry:–",
        "“Oh, father!–the children–in midwinter!”",
        "She turned white as the snow without; her words died away in her\nthroat.",
        "August stood, half blind with sleep, staring with dazed eyes as\nhis cattle stared at the sun when they came out from their\nwinter’s prison.",
        "“It is not true! It is not true!” he muttered. “You are jesting,\nfather?”",
        "Strehla broke into a dreary laugh.",
        "“It is true. Would you like to know what is true too?–that the\nbread you eat, and the meat you put in this pot, and the roof you\nhave over your heads, are none of them paid for, have been none of\nthem paid for for months and months; if it had not been for your\ngrandfather, I should have been in prison all summer and autumn;\nand he is out of patience and will do no more now. There is no\nwork to be had; the masters go to younger men; they say I work\nill; it may be so. Who can keep his head above water with ten\nhungry children dragging him down? When your mother lived it was\ndifferent. Boy, you stare at me as if I were a mad dog! You have\nmade a god of yon china thing. Well–it goes; goes to-morrow. Two\nhundred florins, that is something. It will keep me out of prison\nfor a little, and with the spring things may turn–”",
        "August stood like a creature paralyzed. His eyes were wide open,\nfastened on his father’s with terror and incredulous horror; his\nface had grown as white as his sister’s; his chest heaved with\ntearless sobs.",
        "“It is not true! It is not true!” he echoed stupidly. It seemed to\nhim that the very skies must fall, and the earth perish, if they\ncould take away Hirschvogel. They might as soon talk of tearing\ndown God’s sun out of the heavens.",
        "“You will find it true,” said his father doggedly, and angered\nbecause he was in his own soul bitterly ashamed to have bartered\naway the heirloom and treasure of his race and the comfort and\nhealth-giver of his young children.” You will find it true. The\ndealer has paid me half the money to-night, and will pay me the\nother half to-morrow, when he packs it up and takes it away to\nMunich. No doubt it is worth a great deal more,–at least I\nsuppose so, as he gives that,–but beggars cannot be choosers. The\nlittle black stove in the kitchen will warm you all just as well.\nWho would keep a gilded, painted thing in a poor house like this,\nwhen one can make two hundred florins by it? Dorothea, you never\nsobbed more when your mother died. What is it, when all is said?–\na bit of hardware much too grand-looking for such a room as this.\nIf all the Strehlas had not been born fools, it would have been\nsold a century ago, when it was dug up out of the ground. It is a\nstove for a museum, the trader said when he saw it. To a museum\nlet it go.”",
        "August gave a shrill shriek like a hare’s when it is caught for\nits death, and threw himself on his knees at his father’s feet.",
        "“Oh, father, father!” he cried convulsively, his hands closing on\nStrehla’s knees, and his uplifted face blanched and distorted with\nterror. “Oh, father, dear father, you cannot mean what you say?\nSend IT away–our life, our sun, our joy, our comfort? We shall\nall die in the dark and the cold. Sell ME rather. Sell me to any\ntrade or any pain you like; I will not mind. But Hirschvogel!–it\nis like selling the very cross off the altar! You must be in jest.\nYou could not do such a thing–you could not!–you who have always\nbeen gentle and good, and who have sat in the warmth here year\nafter year with our mother. It is not a piece of hardware, as you\nsay; it is a living thing, for a great man’s thoughts and fancies\nhave put life into it, and it loves us though we are only poor\nlittle children, and we love it with all our hearts and souls, and\nup in heaven I am sure the dead Hirschvogel knows! Oh, listen; I\nwill go and try and get work to-morrow! I will ask them to let me\ncut ice or make the paths through the snow. There must be\nsomething I could do, and I will beg the people we owe money to to\nwait; they are all neighbors, they will be patient. But sell\nHirschvogel!–oh, never! never! never! Give the florins back to\nthe vile man. Tell him it would be like selling the shroud out of\nmother’s coffin, or the golden curls off Ermengilda’s head! Oh,\nfather, dear father! do hear me, for pity’s sake!”",
        "Strehla was moved by the boy’s anguish. He loved his children,\nthough he was often weary of them, and their pain was pain to him.\nBut besides emotion, and stronger than emotion, was the anger that\nAugust roused in him; he hated and despised himself for the barter\nof the heirloom of his race, and every word of the child stung him\nwith a stinging sense of shame.",
        "And he spoke in his wrath rather than in his sorrow.",
        "“You are a little fool,” he said harshly, as they had never heard\nhim speak. “You rave like a play-actor. Get up and go to bed. The\nstove is sold. There is no more to be said. Children like you have\nnothing to do with such matters. The stove is sold, and goes to\nMunich to-morrow. What is it to you? Be thankful I can get bread\nfor you. Get on your legs I say, and go to bed.”",
        "Strehla took up the jug of ale as he paused, and drained it slowly\nas a man who had no cares.",
        "August sprang to his feet and threw his hair back off his face;\nthe blood rushed into his cheeks, making them scarlet; his great\nsoft eyes flamed alight with furious passion.",
        "“You DARE not!” he cried aloud, “you dare not sell it, I say! It\nis not yours alone; it is ours–”",
        "Strehla flung the emptied jug on the bricks with a force that\nshivered it to atoms, and, rising to his feet, struck his son a\nblow that felled him to the floor. It was the first time in all\nhis life that he had ever raised his hand against any one of his\nchildren.",
        "Then he took the oil lamp that stood at his elbow and stumbled off\nto his own chamber with a cloud before his eyes.",
        "“What has happened?” said August a little while later, as he\nopened his eyes and saw Dorothea weeping above him on the wolfskin\nbefore the stove. He had been struck backward, and his head had\nfallen on the hard bricks where the wolfskin did not reach. He sat\nup a moment, with his face bent upon his hands.",
        "“I remember now,” he said, very low, under his breath.",
        "Dorothea showered kisses on him, while her tears fell like rain.",
        "“But, oh, dear, how could you speak so to father?” she murmured.\n“It was very wrong.”",
        "“No, I was right,” said August; and his little mouth, that\nhitherto had only curled in laughter, curved downward with a fixed\nand bitter seriousness. “How dare he? How dare he?” he muttered,\nwith his head sunk in his hands. “It is not his alone. It belongs\nto us all. It is as much yours and mine as it is his.”",
        "Dorothea could only sob in answer. She was too frightened to\nspeak. The authority of their parents in the house had never in\nher remembrance been questioned.",
        "“Are you hurt by the fall, dear August?” she murmured at length,\nfor he looked to her so pale and strange.",
        "“Yes–no. I do not know. What does it matter?”",
        "He sat up upon the wolfskin with passionate pain upon his face;\nall his soul was in rebellion, and he was only a child and was\npowerless.",
        "“It is a sin; it is a theft; it is an infamy,” he said slowly, his\neyes fastened on the gilded feet of Hirschvogel.",
        "“Oh, August, do not say such things of father!” sobbed his sister.\n“Whatever he does, WE ought to think it right.”",
        "August laughed aloud.",
        "“Is it right that he should spend his money in drink?–that he\nshould let orders lie unexecuted?–that he should do his work so\nill that no one cares to employ him?–that he should live on\ngrandfather’s charity, and then dare sell a thing that is ours\nevery whit as much as it is his? To sell Hirschvogel! Oh, dear\nGod! I would sooner sell my soul!”",
        "“August!” cried Dorothea with piteous entreaty. He terrified her;\nshe could not recognize her little, gay, gentle brother in those\nfierce and blasphemous words.",
        "August laughed aloud again; then all at once his laughter broke\ndown into bitterest weeping. He threw himself forward on the\nstove, covering it with kisses, and sobbing as though his heart\nwould burst from his bosom.",
        "What could he do? Nothing, nothing, nothing!",
        "“August, dear August,” whispered Dorothea piteously, and trembling\nall over,–for she was a very gentle girl, and fierce feeling\nterrified her,–\"August, do not lie there. Come to bed; it is\nquite late. In the morning you will be calmer. It is horrible\nindeed, and we shall die of cold, at least the little ones; but if\nit be father’s will–”",
        "“Let me alone,” said August through his teeth, striving to still\nthe storm of sobs that shook him from head to foot. “Let me alone.\nIn the morning!–how can you speak of the morning”",
        "“Come to bed, dear,” sighed his sister. “Oh, August, do not lie\nand look like that! you frighten me. Do come to bed.”",
        "“I shall stay here.”",
        "“Here! all night!”",
        "“They might take it in the night. Besides, to leave it NOW!”",
        "“But it is cold! the fire is out.”",
        "“It will never be warm any more, nor shall we.”",
        "All his childhood had gone out of him, all his gleeful, careless,\nsunny temper had gone with it; he spoke sullenly and wearily,\nchoking down the great sobs in his chest. To him it was as if the\nend of the world had come.",
        "His sister lingered by him while striving to persuade him to go to\nhis place in the little crowded bedchamber with Albrecht and Waldo\nand Christof. But it was in vain. “I shall stay here,” was all he\nanswered her. And he stayed–all the night long.",
        "The lamps went out; the rats came and ran across the floor; as the\nhours crept on through midnight and past, the cold intensified and\nthe air of the room grew like ice. August did not move; he lay\nwith his face downward on the golden and rainbow-hued pedestal of\nthe household treasure, which henceforth was to be cold\nforevermore, an exiled thing in a foreign city, in a far-off land.",
        "Whilst yet it was dark his three elder brothers came down the\nstairs and let themselves out, each bearing his lantern and going\nto his work in stone yard and timber yard and at the salt works.\nThey did not notice him; they did not know what had happened.",
        "A little later his sister came down with a light in her hand to\nmake ready the house ere morning should break.",
        "She stole up to him and laid her hand on his shoulder timidly.",
        "“Dear August, you must be frozen. August, do look up! do speak!”",
        "August raised his eyes with a wild, feverish, sullen look in them\nthat she had never seen there. His face was ashen white; his lips\nwere like fire. He had not slept all night; but his passionate\nsobs had given way to delirious waking dreams and numb senseless\ntrances, which had alternated one on another all through the\nfreezing, lonely, horrible hours.",
        "“It will never be warm again,” he muttered, “never again!”",
        "Dorothea clasped him with trembling hands. “August! do you not\nknow me?” she cried in an agony. “I am Dorothea. Wake up, dear–\nwake up! It is morning, only so dark!”",
        "August shuddered all over.",
        "“The morning!” he echoed.",
        "He slowly rose up on to his feet.",
        "“I will go to grandfather,” he said very low. “He is always good;\nperhaps he could save it.”",
        "Loud blows with the heavy iron knocker of the house-door drowned\nhis words. A strange voice called aloud through the keyhole:–",
        "“Let me in! Quick!–there is no time to lose! More snow like\nthis, and the roads will all be blocked. Let me in! Do you hear? I\nam come to take the great stove.”",
        "August sprang erect, his fists doubled, his eyes blazing.",
        "“You shall never touch it!” he screamed; “you shall never touch\nit!”",
        "“Who shall prevent us?” laughed a big man who was a Bavarian,\namused at the fierce little figure fronting him.",
        "“I!” said August. “You shall never have it! you shall kill me\nfirst!”",
        "“Strehla,” said the big man as August’s father entered the room,\n“you have got a little mad dog here; muzzle him.”",
        "One way and another they did muzzle him. He fought like a little\ndemon, and hit out right and left, and one of his blows gave the\nBavarian a black eye. But he was soon mastered by four grown men,\nand his father flung him with no light hand out from the door of\nthe back entrance, and the buyers of the stately and beautiful\nstove set to work to pack it heedfully and carry it away.",
        "When Dorothea stole out to look for August, he was nowhere in\nsight. She went back to little ’Gilda, who was ailing, and sobbed\nover the child, whilst the others stood looking on, dimly\nunderstanding that with Hirschvogel was going all the warmth of\ntheir bodies, all the light of their hearth.",
        "Even their father now was sorry and ashamed; but two hundred\nflorins seemed a big sum to him, and, after all, he thought the\nchildren could warm themselves quite as well at the black iron\nstove in the kitchen. Besides, whether he regretted it now or not,\nthe work of the Nurnberg potter was sold irrevocably, and he had\nto stand still and see the men from Munich wrap it in manifold\nwrappings and bear it out into the snowy air to where an ox cart\nstood in waiting for it.",
        "In another moment Hirschvogel was gone–gone forever and aye.",
        "August had stood still for a time, leaning, sick and faint from\nthe violence that had been used to him, against the back wall of\nthe house. The wall looked on a court where a well was, and the\nbacks of other houses, and beyond them the spire of the Muntze\nTower and the peaks of the mountains.",
        "Into the court an old neighbor hobbled for water, and, seeing the\nboy, said to him:–",
        "“Child, is it true your father is selling the big painted stove?”",
        "August nodded his head, then burst into a passion of tears.",
        "“Well, for sure he is a fool,” said the neighbor. “Heaven forgive\nme for calling him so before his own child! but the stove was\nworth a mint of money. I do remember in my young days, in old\nAnton’s time (that was your great-grand-father, my lad), a\nstranger from Vienna saw it, and said that it was worth its weight\nin gold.”",
        "August’s sobs went on their broken, impetuous course.",
        "“I loved it! I loved it!” he moaned. “I do not care what its value\nwas. I loved it! I LOVED IT!”",
        "“You little simpleton!” said the old man, kindly. “But you are\nwiser than your father, when all’s said. If sell it he must, he\nshould have taken it to good Herr Steiner over at Spritz, who\nwould have given him honest value. But no doubt they took him over\nhis beer–ay, ay! but if I were you I would do better than cry. I\nwould go after it.”",
        "August raised his head, the tears raining down his cheeks.",
        "“Go after it when you are bigger,” said the neighbor, with a good-\nnatured wish to cheer him up a little. “The world is a small thing\nafter all: I was a traveling clockmaker once upon a time, and I\nknow that your stove will be safe enough whoever gets it; anything\nthat can be sold for a round sum is always wrapped up in cotton\nwool by everybody. Ay, ay, don’t cry so much; you will see your\nstove again some day.”",
        "Then the old man hobbled away to draw his brazen pail full of\nwater at the well.",
        "August remained leaning against the wall; his head was buzzing,\nand his heart fluttering with the new idea which had presented\nitself to his mind. “Go after it,” had said the old man. He\nthought, “Why not go with it?” He loved it better than any one,\neven better than Dorothea; and he shrank from the thought of\nmeeting his father again, his father who had sold Hirschvogel.",
        "He was by this time in that state of exaltation in which the\nimpossible looks quite natural and commonplace. His tears were\nstill wet on his pale cheeks, but they had ceased to fall. He ran\nout of the courtyard by a little gate, and across to the huge\nGothic porch of the church. From there he could watch unseen his\nfather’s house door, at which were always hanging some blue-and-\ngray pitchers, such as are common and so picturesque in Austria,\nfor a part of the house was let to a man who dealt in pottery.",
        "He hid himself in the grand portico, which he had so often passed\nthrough to go to mass or complin within, and presently his heart\ngave a great leap, for he saw the straw-enwrapped stove brought\nout and laid with infinite care on the bullock dray. Two of the\nBavarian men mounted beside it, and the sleigh-wagon slowly crept\nover the snow of the place–snow crisp and hard as stone. The\nnoble old minister looked its grandest and most solemn, with its\ndark gray stone and its vast archways, and its porch that was\nitself as big as many a church, and its strange gargoyles and\nlamp-irons black against the snow on its roof and on the pavement;\nbut for once August had no eyes for it: he only watched for his\nold friend. Then he, a little unnoticeable figure enough, like a\nscore of other boys in Hall, crept, unseen by any of his brothers\nor sisters, out of the porch and over the shelving uneven square,\nand followed in the wake of the dray.",
        "Its course lay towards the station of the railway, which is close\nto the salt works, whose smoke at times sullies this part of clean\nlittle Hall, though it does not do very much damage. From Hall the\niron road runs northward through glorious country to Salzburg,\nVienna, Prague, Buda, and southward over the Brenner into Italy.\nWas Hirschvogel going north or south? This at least he would soon\nknow.",
        "August had often hung about the little station, watching the\ntrains come and go and dive into the heart of the hills and\nvanish. No one said anything to him for idling about; people are\nkind-hearted and easy of temper in this pleasant land, and\nchildren and dogs are both happy there. He heard the Bavarians\narguing and vociferating a great deal, and learned that they meant\nto go too and wanted to go with the great stove itself. But this\nthey could not do, for neither could the stove go by a passenger\ntrain nor they themselves go in a goods train. So at length they\ninsured their precious burden for a large sum, and consented to\nsend it by a luggage train which was to pass through Hall in half\nan hour. The swift trains seldom deign to notice the existence of\nHall at all.",
        "August heard, and a desperate resolve made itself up in his little\nmind. Where Hirschvogel went would he go. He gave one terrible\nthought to Dorothea–poor, gentle Dorothea!–sitting in the cold\nat home, then set to work to execute his project. How he managed\nit he never knew very clearly himself; but certain it is that when\nthe goods train from the north, that had come all the way from\nLinz on the Danube, moved out of Hall, August was hidden behind\nthe stove in the great covered truck, and wedged, unseen and\nundreamt of by any human creature, amidst the cases of wood-\ncarving, of clocks and clock-work, of Vienna toys, of Turkish\ncarpets, of Russian skins, of Hungarian wines, which shared the\nsame abode as did his swathed and bound Hirschvogel. No doubt he\nwas very naughty, but it never occurred to him that he was so: his\nwhole mind and soul were absorbed in the one entrancing idea, to\nfollow his beloved friend and fire-king.",
        "It was very dark in the closed truck, which had only a little\nwindow above the door; and it was crowded, and had a strong smell\nin it from the Russian hides and the hams that were in it. But\nAugust was not frightened; he was close to Hirschvogel, and\npresently he meant to be closer still; for he meant to do nothing\nless than get inside Hirschvogel itself. Being a shrewd little\nboy, and having had, by great luck, two silver groschen in his\nbreeches pocket, which he had earned the day before by chopping\nwood, he had bought some bread and sausage at the station of a\nwoman there who knew him, and who thought he was going out to his\nUncle Joachim’s chalet above Jenbach. This he had with him, and\nthis he ate in the darkness and the lumbering, pounding,\nthundering noise which made him giddy, as never had he been in a\ntrain of any kind before. Still he ate, having had no breakfast,\nand being a child, and half a German, and not knowing at all how\nor when he ever would eat again.",
        "When he had eaten, not as much as he wanted, but as much as he\nthought was prudent (for who could say when he would be able to\nbuy anything more?), he set to work like a little mouse to make a\nhole in the withes of straw and hay which enveloped the stove. If\nit had been put in a packing-case, he would have been defeated at\nthe onset. As it was, he gnawed, and nibbled, and pulled, and\npushed, just as a mouse would have done, making his hole where he\nguessed that the opening of the stove was–the opening through\nwhich he had so often thrust the big oak logs to feed it. No one\ndisturbed him; the heavy train went lumbering on and on, and he\nsaw nothing at all of the beautiful mountains, and shining waters,\nand great forests through which he was being carried. He was hard\nat work getting through the straw and hay and twisted ropes; and\nget through them at last he did, and found the door of the stove,\nwhich he knew so well, and which was quite large enough for a\nchild of his age to slip through, and it was this which he had\ncounted upon doing. Slip through he did, as he had often done at\nhome for fun, and curled himself up there to see if he could\nanyhow remain during many hours. He found that he could; air came\nin through the brass fretwork of the stove; and with admirable\ncaution in such a little fellow he leaned out, drew the hay and\nstraw together, and rearranged the ropes, so that no one could\never have dreamed a little mouse had been at them. Then he curled\nhimself up again, this time more like a dormouse than anything\nelse; and, being safe inside his dear Hirschvogel and intensely\ncold, he went fast asleep, as if he were in his own bed at home\nwith Albrecht and Christof on either side of him. The train\nlumbered on, stopping often and long, as the habit of goods trains\nis, sweeping the snow away with its cow-switcher, and rumbling\nthrough the deep heart of the mountains, with its lamps aglow like\nthe eyes of a dog in a night of frost.",
        "The train rolled on in its heavy, slow fashion, and the child\nslept soundly for a long while. When he did awake, it was quite\ndark outside in the land; he could not see, and of course he was\nin absolute darkness; and for a while he was sorely frightened,\nand trembled terribly, and sobbed in a quiet, heartbroken fashion,\nthinking of them all at home. Poor Dorothea! how anxious she would\nbe! How she would run over the town and walk up to grandfather’s\nat Dorf Ampas, and perhaps even send over to Jenbach, thinking he\nhad taken refuge with Uncle Joachim! His conscience smote him for\nthe sorrow he must be even then causing to his gentle sister; but\nit never occurred to him to try and go back. If he once were to\nlose sight of Hirschvogel, how could he ever hope to find it\nagain? how could he ever know whither it had gone–north, south,\neast, or west? The old neighbor had said that the world was small;\nbut August knew at least that it must have a great many places in\nit: that he had seen himself on the maps on his schoolhouse walls.\nAlmost any other little boy would, I think, have been frightened\nout of his wits at the position in which he found himself; but\nAugust was brave, and he had a firm belief that God and\nHirschvogel would take care of him. The master-potter of Nurnberg\nwas always present to his mind, a kindly, benign, and gracious\nspirit, dwelling manifestly in that porcelain tower whereof he had\nbeen the maker.",
        "A droll fancy, you say? But every child with a soul in him has\nquite as quaint fancies as this one was of August’s.",
        "So he got over his terror and his sobbing both, though he was so\nutterly in the dark. He did not feel cramped at all, because the\nstove was so large, and air he had in plenty, as it came through\nthe fretwork running round the top. He was hungry again, and again\nnibbled with prudence at his loaf and his sausage. He could not at\nall tell the hour. Every time the train stopped and he heard the\nbanging, stamping, shouting, and jangling of chains that went on,\nhis heart seemed to jump up into his mouth. If they should find\nhim out! Sometimes porters came and took away this case and the\nother, a sack here, a bale there, now a big bag, now a dead\nchamois. Every time the men trampled near him, and swore at each\nother, and banged this and that to and fro, he was so frightened\nthat his very breath seemed to stop. When they came to lift the\nstove out, would they find him? and if they did find him, would\nthey kill him? That was what he kept thinking of all the way, all\nthrough the dark hours, which seemed without end. The goods trains\nare usually very slow, and are many days doing what a quick train\ndoes in a few hours. This one was quicker than most, because it\nwas bearing goods to the King of Bavaria; still, it took all the\nshort winter’s day and the long winter’s night and half another\nday to go over ground that the mail trains cover in a forenoon. It\npassed great armored Kufstein standing across the beautiful and\nsolemn gorge, denying the right of way to all the foes of Austria.\nIt passed twelve hours later, after lying by in out-of-the-way\nstations, pretty Rosenheim, that marks the border of Bavaria. And\nhere the Nurnberg stove, with August inside it, was lifted out\nheedfully and set under a covered way. When it was lifted out, the\nboy had hard work to keep in his screams; he was tossed to and fro\nas the men lifted the huge thing, and the earthenware walls of his\nbeloved fire-king were not cushions of down. However, though they\nswore and grumbled at the weight of it, they never suspected that\na living child was inside it, and they carried it out on to the\nplatform and set it down under the roof of the goods shed. There\nit passed the rest of the night and all the next morning, and\nAugust was all the while within it.",
        "The winds of early winter sweep bitterly over Rosenheim, and all\nthe vast Bavarian plain was one white sheet of snow. If there had\nnot been whole armies of men at work always clearing the iron\nrails of the snow, no trains could ever have run at all. Happily\nfor August, the thick wrappings in which the stove was enveloped\nand the stoutness of its own make screened him from the cold, of\nwhich, else, he must have died–frozen. He had still some of his\nloaf, and a little–a very little–of his sausage. What he did\nbegin to suffer from was thirst; and this frightened him almost\nmore than anything else, for Dorothea had read aloud to them one\nnight a story of the tortures some wrecked men had endured because\nthey could not find any water but the salt sea. It was many hours\nsince he had last taken a drink from the wooden spout of their old\npump, which brought them the sparkling, ice-cold water of the\nhills.",
        "But, fortunately for him, the stove, having been marked and\nregistered as “fragile and valuable,” was not treated quite like a\nmere bale of goods, and the Rosenheim station-master, who knew its\nconsignees, resolved to send it on by a passenger train that would\nleave there at daybreak. And when this train went out, in it,\namong piles of luggage belonging to other travelers, to Vienna,\nPrague, Buda-Pest, Salzburg, was August, still undiscovered, still\ndoubled up like a mole in the winter under the grass. Those words,\n“fragile and valuable,” had made the men lift Hirschvogel gently\nand with care. He had begun to get used to his prison, and a\nlittle used to the incessant pounding and jumbling and rattling\nand shaking with which modern travel is always accompanied, though\nmodern invention does deem itself so mightily clever. All in the\ndark he was, and he was terribly thirsty; but he kept feeling the\nearthenware sides of the Nurnberg giant and saying, softly, “Take\ncare of me; oh, take care of me, dear Hirschvogel!”",
        "He did not say, “Take me back;” for, now that he was fairly out in\nthe world, he wished to see a little of it. He began to think that\nthey must have been all over the world in all this time that the\nrolling and roaring and hissing and jangling had been about his\nears; shut up in the dark, he began to remember all the tales that\nhad been told in Yule round the fire at his grandfather’s good\nhouse at Dorf, of gnomes and elves and subterranean terrors, and\nthe Erl King riding on the black horse of night, and–and–and he\nbegan to sob and to tremble again, and this time did scream\noutright. But the steam was screaming itself so loudly that no\none, had there been any one nigh, would have heard him; and in\nanother minute or so the train stopped with a jar and a jerk, and\nhe in his cage could hear men crying aloud, “Munchen! Munchen!”",
        "Then he knew enough of geography to know that he was in the heart\nof Bavaria. He had had an uncle killed in the Bayerischenwald by\nthe Bavarian forest guards, when in the excitement of hunting a\nblack bear he had overpassed the limits of the Tyrol frontier.",
        "That fate of his kinsman, a gallant young chamois hunter who had\ntaught him to handle a trigger and load a muzzle, made the very\nname of Bavaria a terror to August.",
        "“It is Bavaria! It is Bavaria!” he sobbed to the stove; but the\nstove said nothing to him; it had no fire in it. A stove can no\nmore speak without fire than a man can see without light. Give it\nfire, and it will sing to you, tell tales to you, offer you in\nreturn all the sympathy you ask.",
        "“It is Bavaria!” sobbed August; for it is always a name of dread\naugury to the Tyroleans, by reason of those bitter struggles and\nmidnight shots and untimely deaths which come from those meetings\nof jager and hunter in the Bayerischenwald. But the train stopped;\nMunich was reached, and August, hot and cold by turns, and shaking\nlike a little aspen leaf, felt himself once more carried out on\nthe shoulders of men, rolled along on a truck, and finally set\ndown, where he knew not, only he knew he was thirsty–so thirsty!\nIf only he could have reached his hand out and scooped up a little\nsnow!",
        "He thought he had been moved on this truck many miles, but in\ntruth the stove had been only taken from the railway station to a\nshop in the Marienplatz. Fortunately, the stove was always set\nupright on its four gilded feet, an injunction to that effect\nhaving been affixed to its written label, and on its gilded feet\nit stood now in the small dark curiosity shop of one Hans Rhilfer.",
        "“I shall not unpack it till Anton comes,” he heard a man’s voice\nsay; and then he heard a key grate in a lock, and by the unbroken\nstillness that ensued he concluded he was alone, and ventured to\npeep through the straw and hay. What he saw was a small square\nroom filled with pots and pans, pictures, carvings, old blue jugs,\nold steel armor, shields, daggers, Chinese idols, Vienna china,\nTurkish rugs, and all the art lumber and fabricated rubbish of a\nbric-a-brac dealer’s. It seemed a wonderful place to him; but, oh!\nwas there one drop of water in it all? That was his single\nthought; for his tongue was parching, and his throat felt on fire,\nand his chest began to be dry and choked as with dust.",
        "There was not a drop of water, but there was a lattice window\ngrated, and beyond the window was a wide stone ledge covered with\nsnow. August cast one look at the locked door, darted out of his\nhiding-place, ran and opened the window, crammed the snow into his\nmouth again and again, and then flew back into the stove, drew the\nhay and straw over the place he entered by, tied the cords, and\nshut the brass door down on himself. He had brought some big\nicicles in with him, and by them his thirst was finally, if only\ntemporarily, quenched. Then he sat still in the bottom of the\nstove, listening intently, wide awake, and once more recovering\nhis natural boldness.",
        "The thought of Dorothea kept nipping his heart and his conscience\nwith a hard squeeze now and then; but he thought to himself, “If I\ncan take her back Hirschvogel, then how pleased she will be, and\nhow little ’Gilda will clap her hands!” He was not at all selfish\nin his love for Hirschvogel: he wanted it for them all at home\nquite as much as for himself. There was at the bottom of his mind\na kind of ache of shame that his father–his own father–should\nhave stripped their hearth and sold their honor thus.",
        "A robin had been perched upon a stone griffin sculptured on a\nhouse eave near. August had felt for the crumbs of his loaf in his\npocket, and had thrown them to the little bird sitting so easily\non the frozen snow.",
        "In the darkness where he was he now heard a little song, made\nfaint by the stove-wall and the window glass that was between him\nand it, but still distinct and exquisitely sweet. It was the\nrobin, singing after feeding on the crumbs. August, as he heard,\nburst into tears. He thought of Dorothea, who every morning threw\nout some grain or some bread on the snow before the church. “What\nuse is it going THERE,” she said, “if we forget the sweetest\ncreatures God has made?” Poor Dorothea! Poor, good, tender, much-\nburdened little soul! He thought of her till his tears ran like\nrain.",
        "Yet it never once occurred to him to dream of going home.\nHirschvogel was here.",
        "Presently the key turned in the lock of the door, he heard heavy\nfootsteps and the voice of the man who had said to his father,\n“You have a little mad dog; muzzle him!” The voice said, “Ay, ay,\nyou have called me a fool many times. Now you shall see what I\nhave gotten for two hundred dirty florins. Potztausend! never did\nYOU do such a stroke of work.”",
        "Then the other voice grumbled and swore, and the steps of the two\nmen approached more closely, and the heart of the child went pit-\na-pat, pit-a-pat, as a mouse’s does when it is on the top of a\ncheese and hears a housemaid’s broom sweeping near. They began to\nstrip the stove of its wrappings: that he could tell by the noise\nthey made with the hay and the straw. Soon they had stripped it\nwholly: that, too, he knew by the oaths and exclamations of wonder\nand surprise and rapture which broke from the man who had not seen\nit before.",
        "“A right royal thing! A wonderful and never-to-be-rivaled thing!\nGrander than the great stove of Hohen-Salzburg! Sublime!\nmagnificent! matchless!”",
        "So the epithets ran on in thick guttural voices, diffusing a smell\nof lager beer so strong as they spoke that it reached August\ncrouching in his stronghold. If they should open the door of the\nstove! That was his frantic fear. If they should open it, it would\nbe all over with him. They would drag him out; most likely they\nwould kill him, he thought, as his mother’s young brother had been\nkilled in the Wald.",
        "The perspiration rolled off his forehead in his agony; but he had\ncontrol enough over himself to keep quiet, and after standing by\nthe Nurnberg master’s work for nigh an hour, praising, marveling,\nexpatiating in the lengthy German tongue, the men moved to a\nlittle distance and began talking of sums of money and divided\nprofits, of which discourse he could make out no meaning. All he\ncould make out was that the name of the king–the king–the king\ncame over very often in their arguments. He fancied at times they\nquarreled, for they swore lustily and their voices rose hoarse and\nhigh; but after a while they seemed to pacify each other and agree\nto something, and were in great glee, and so in these merry\nspirits came and slapped the luminous sides of stately Hirschvogel,\nand shouted to it:–",
        "“Old Mumchance, you have brought us rare good luck! To think you\nwere smoking in a silly fool of a salt baker’s kitchen all these\nyears!”",
        "Then inside the stove August jumped up, with flaming cheeks and\nclinching hands, and was almost on the point of shouting out to\nthem that they were the thieves and should say no evil of his\nfather, when he remembered, just in time, that to breathe a word\nor make a sound was to bring ruin on himself and sever him forever\nfrom Hirschvogel. So he kept quite still, and the men barred the\nshutters of the little lattice and went out by the door, double-\nlocking it after them. He had made out from their talk that they\nwere going to show Hirschvogel to some great person: therefore he\nkept quite still and dared not move.",
        "Muffled sounds came to him through the shutters from the streets\nbelow–the rolling of wheels, the clanging of church bells, and\nbursts of that military music which is so seldom silent in the\nstreets of Munich. An hour perhaps passed by; sounds of steps on\nthe stairs kept him in perpetual apprehension. In the intensity of\nhis anxiety, he forgot that he was hungry and many miles away from\ncheerful, Old World little Hall, lying by the clear gray river-\nwater, with the ramparts of the mountains all around.",
        "Presently the door opened again sharply. He could hear the two\ndealers’ voices murmuring unctuous words, in which “honor,\"\n“gratitude,” and many fine long noble titles played the chief\nparts. The voice of another person, more clear and refined than\ntheirs, answered them curtly, and then, close by the Nurnberg\nstove and the boy’s ear, ejaculated a single “Wunderschon!” August\nalmost lost his terror for himself in his thrill of pride at his\nbeloved Hirschvogel being thus admired in the great city. He\nthought the master-potter must be glad too.",
        "“Wunderschon!” ejaculated the stranger a second time, and then\nexamined the stove in all its parts, read all its mottoes, gazed\nlong on all its devices.",
        "“It must have been made for the Emperor Maximilian,” he said at\nlast; and the poor little boy, meanwhile, within, was “hugged up\ninto nothing,” as you children say, dreading that every moment he\nwould open the stove. And open it truly he did, and examined the\nbrass-work of the door; but inside it was so dark that crouching\nAugust passed unnoticed, screwed up into a ball like a hedgehog as\nhe was. The gentleman shut to the door at length, without having\nseen anything strange inside it; and then he talked long and low\nwith the tradesmen, and, as his accent was different from that\nwhich August was used to, the child could distinguish little that\nhe said, except the name of the king and the word “gulden” again\nand again. After a while he went away, one of the dealers\naccompanying him, one of them lingering behind to bar up the\nshutters. Then this one also withdrew again, double-locking the\ndoor.",
        "The poor little hedgehog uncurled itself and dared to breathe\naloud.",
        "What time was it?",
        "Late in the day, he thought, for to accompany the stranger they\nhad lighted a lamp; he had heard the scratch of the match, and\nthrough the brass fretwork had seen the lines of light.",
        "He would have to pass the night here, that was certain. He and\nHirschvogel were locked in, but at least they were together. If\nonly he could have had something to eat! He thought with a pang of\nhow at this hour at home they ate the sweet soup, sometimes with\napples in it from Aunt Maila’s farm orchard, and sang together,\nand listened to Dorothea’s reading of little tales, and basked in\nthe glow and delight that had beamed on them from the great\nNurnberg fire-king.",
        "“Oh, poor, poor little ’Gilda! What is she doing without the dear\nHirschvogel?” he thought. Poor little ’Gilda! she had only now the\nblack iron stove of the ugly little kitchen. Oh, how cruel of\nfather!",
        "August could not bear to hear the dealers blame or laugh at his\nfather, but he did feel that it had been so, so cruel to sell\nHirschvogel. The mere memory of all those long winter evenings,\nwhen they had all closed round it, and roasted chestnuts or crab\napples in it, and listened to the howling of the wind and the deep\nsound of the church bells, and tried very much to make each other\nbelieve that the wolves still came down from the mountains into\nthe streets of Hall, and were that very minute growling at the\nhouse door–all this memory coming on him with the sound of the\ncity bells, and the knowledge that night drew near upon him so\ncompletely, being added to his hunger and his fear, so overcame\nhim that he burst out crying for the fiftieth time since he had\nbeen inside the stove, and felt that he would starve to death, and\nwondered dreamily if Hirschvogel would care. Yes, he was sure\nHirschvogel would care. Had he not decked it all summer long with\nalpine roses and edelweiss and heaths and made it sweet with thyme\nand honeysuckle and great garden lilies? Had he ever forgotten\nwhen Santa Claus came to make it its crown of holly and ivy and\nwreathe it all around?",
        "“Oh, shelter me; save me; take care of me!” he prayed to the old\nfire-king, and forgot, poor little man, that he had come on this\nwild-goose chase northward to save and take care of Hirschvogel!",
        "After a time he dropped asleep, as children can do when they weep,\nand little robust hill-born boys most surely do, be they where\nthey may. It was not very cold in this lumber-room; it was tightly\nshut up, and very full of things, and at the back of it were the\nhot pipes of an adjacent house, where a great deal of fuel was\nburnt. Moreover, August’s clothes were warm ones, and his blood\nwas young. So he was not cold, though Munich is terribly cold in\nthe nights of December; and he slept on and on–which was a\ncomfort to him, for he forgot his woes, and his perils, and his\nhunger, for a time.",
        "Midnight was once more chiming from all the brazen tongues of the\ncity when he awoke, and, all being still around him, ventured to\nput his head out of the brass door of the stove to see why such a\nstrange bright light was round him.",
        "It was a very strange and brilliant light indeed; and yet, what is\nperhaps still stranger, it did not frighten or amaze him, nor did\nwhat he saw alarm him either, and yet I think it would have done\nyou or me. For what he saw was nothing less than all the bric-a-\nbrac in motion.",
        "A big jug, an Apostel-Krug, of Kruessen, was solemnly dancing a\nminuet with a plump Faenza jar; a tall Dutch clock was going\nthrough a gavotte with a spindle-legged ancient chair; a very\ndroll porcelain figure of Littenhausen was bowing to a very stiff\nsoldier in terre cuite of Ulm; an old violin of Cremona was\nplaying itself, and a queer little shrill plaintive music that\nthought itself merry came from a painted spinnet covered with\nfaded roses; some gilt Spanish leather had got up on the wall and\nlaughed; a Dresden mirror was tripping about, crowned with\nflowers, and a Japanese bonze was riding along on a griffin; a\nslim Venetian rapier had come to blows with a stout Ferrara sabre,\nall about a little pale-faced chit of a damsel in white\nNymphenburg china; and a portly Franconian pitcher in gres gris\nwas calling aloud, “Oh, these Italians! always at feud!” But\nnobody listened to him at all. A great number of little Dresden\ncups and saucers were all skipping and waltzing; the teapots, with\ntheir broad round faces, were spinning their own lids like\nteetotums; the high-backed gilded chairs were having a game of\ncards together; and a little Saxe poodle, with a blue ribbon at\nits throat, was running from one to another, whilst a yellow cat\nof Cornelis Lachtleven’s rode about on a Delft horse in blue\npottery of 1489. Meanwhile the brilliant light shed on the scene\ncame from three silver candelabra, though they had no candles set\nup in them; and, what is the greatest miracle of all, August\nlooked on at these mad freaks and felt no sensation of wonder! He\nonly, as he heard the violin and the spinnet playing, felt an\nirresistible desire to dance too. No doubt his face said what he\nwished; for a lovely little lady, all in pink and gold and white,\nwith powdered hair, and high-heeled shoes, and all made of the\nvery finest and fairest Meissen china, tripped up to him, and\nsmiled, and gave him her hand, and led him out to a minuet. And he\ndanced it perfectly–poor little August in his thick, clumsy\nshoes, and his thick, clumsy sheepskin jacket, and his rough\nhomespun linen, and his broad Tyrolean hat! He must have danced it\nperfectly, this dance of kings and queens in days when crowns were\nduly honored, for the lovely lady always smiled benignly and never\nscolded him at all, and danced so divinely herself to the stately\nmeasures the spinnet was playing that August could not take his\neyes off her till, their minuet ended, she sat down on her own\nwhite-and-gold bracket.",
        "“I am the Princess of Saxe-Royale,” she said to him, with a\nbenignant smile; “and you have got through that minuet very\nfairly.”",
        "Then he ventured to say to her:–",
        "“Madame my princess, could you tell me kindly why some of the\nfigures and furniture dance and speak, and some lie up in a corner\nlike lumber? It does make me curious. Is it rude to ask?”",
        "For it greatly puzzled him why, when some of the bric-a-brac was\nall full of life and motion, some was quite still and had not a\nsingle thrill in it.",
        "“My dear child,” said the powdered lady, “is it possible that you\ndo not know the reason? Why, those silent, dull things are\nIMITATION!”",
        "This she said with so much decision that she evidently considered\nit a condensed but complete answer.",
        "“Imitation?” repeated August, timidly, not understanding.",
        "“Of course! Lies, falsehoods, fabrications!” said the princess in\npink shoes, very vivaciously. “They only PRETEND to be what we\nARE! They never wake up: how can they? No imitation ever had any\nsoul in it yet.”",
        "“Oh!” said August, humbly, not even sure that he understood\nentirely yet. He looked at Hirschvogel: surely it had a royal soul\nwithin it: would it not wake up and speak? Oh, dear! how he longed\nto hear the voice of his fire-king! And he began to forget that he\nstood by a lady who sat upon a pedestal of gold-and-white china,\nwith the year 1746 cut on it, and the Meissen mark.",
        "“What will you be when you are a man?” said the little lady,\nsharply, for her black eyes were quick though her red lips were\nsmiling. “Will you work for the Konigliche Porcellan-Manufactur,\nlike my great dead Kandler?”",
        "“I have never thought,” said August, stammering; “at least–that\nis–I do wish–I do hope to be a painter, as was Master Augustin\nHirschvogel at Nurnberg.”",
        "“Bravo!” said all the real bric-a-brac in one breath, and the two\nItalian rapiers left off fighting to cry, “Begone!” For there is\nnot a bit of true bric-a-brac in all Europe that does not know the\nnames of the mighty masters.",
        "August felt quite pleased to have won so much applause, and grew\nas red as the lady’s shoes with bashful contentment.",
        "“I knew all the Hirschvogels, from old Veit downwards,” said a fat\ngres de Flandre beer jug; “I myself was made at Nurnberg.” And he\nbowed to the great stove very politely, taking off his own silver\nhat–I mean lid–with a courtly sweep that he could scarcely have\nlearned from burgomasters. The stove, however, was silent, and a\nsickening suspicion (for what is such heartbreak as a suspicion of\nwhat we love?) came through the mind of August: WAS HIRSCHVOGEL\nONLY IMITATION?",
        "“No, no, no, no!” he said to himself stoutly; though Hirschvogel\nnever stirred, never spoke, yet would he keep all faith in it!\nAfter all their happy years together, after all the nights of\nwarmth and joy he owed it, should he doubt his own friend and\nhero, whose gilt lion’s feet he had kissed in his babyhood? “No,\nno, no, no!” he said again, with so much emphasis that the Lady of\nMeissen looked sharply again at him.",
        "“No,” she said, with pretty disdain; “no, believe me, they may\n’pretend’ forever. They can never look like us! They imitate even\nour marks, but never can they look like the real thing, never can\nthey chassent de race.”",
        "“How should they?” said a bronze statuette of Vischer’s. “They\ndaub themselves green with verdigris, or sit out in the rain to\nget rusted; but green and rust are not patina; only the ages can\ngive that!”",
        "“And MY imitations are all in primary colors, staring colors, hot\nas the colors of a hostelry’s signboard!” said the Lady of\nMeissen, with a shiver.",
        "“Well, there is a gres de Flandre over there, who pretends to be a\nHans Kraut, as I am,” said the jug with the silver hat, pointing\nwith his handle to a jug that lay prone on its side in a corner.\n“He has copied me as exactly as it is given to moderns to copy us.\nAlmost he might be mistaken for me. But yet what a difference\nthere is! How crude are his blues! how evidently done over the\nglaze are his black letters! He has tried to give himself my very\ntwist; but what a lamentable exaggeration of that playful\ndeviation in my lines which in his becomes actual deformity!”",
        "“And look at that,” said the gilt Cordovan leather, with a\ncontemptuous glance at a broad piece of gilded leather spread out\non a table. “They will sell him cheek by jowl with me, and give\nhim my name; but look! I am overlaid with pure gold beaten thin\nas a film and laid on me in absolute honesty by worthy Diego de\nlas Gorgias, worker in leather of lovely Cordova in the blessed\nreign of Ferdinand the Most Christian. HIS gilding is one part\ngold to eleven other parts of brass and rubbish, and it has been\nlaid on him with a brush–A BRUSH!–pah! of course he will be as\nblack as a crock in a few years’ time, whilst I am as bright as\nwhen I first was made, and, unless I am burnt as my Cordova burnt\nits heretics, I shall shine on forever.”",
        "“They carve pear wood because it is so soft, and dye it brown, and\ncall it ME!” said an old oak cabinet, with a chuckle.",
        "“That is not so painful; it does not vulgarize you so much as the\ncups they paint to-day and christen after ME!” said a Carl Theodor\ncup subdued in hue, yet gorgeous as a jewel.",
        "“Nothing can be so annoying as to see common gimcracks aping ME!\"\ninterposed the princess in the pink shoes.",
        "“They even steal my motto, though it is Scripture,” said a\nTrauerkrug of Regensburg in black-and-white.",
        "“And my own dots they put on plain English china creatures!\"\nsighed the little white maid of Nymphenburg.",
        "“And they sell hundreds and thousands of common china plates,\ncalling them after me, and baking my saints and my legends in a\nmuffle of to-day; it is blasphemy!” said a stout plate of Gubbio,\nwhich in its year of birth had seen the face of Maestro Giorgio.",
        "“That is what is so terrible in these bric-a-brac places,” said\nthe princess of Meissen. “It brings one in contact with such low,\nimitative creatures; one really is safe nowhere nowadays unless\nunder glass at the Louvre or South Kensington.”",
        "“And they get even there,” sighed the gres de Flandre. “A terrible\nthing happened to a dear friend of mine, a terre cuite of Blasius\n(you know the terres cuites of Blasius date from 1560). Well, he\nwas put under glass in a museum that shall be nameless, and he\nfound himself set next to his own imitation born and baked\nyesterday at Frankfort, and what think you the miserable creature\nsaid to him, with a grin? ’Old Pipeclay,’–that is what he called\nmy friend,–’the fellow that bought ME got just as much commission\non me as the fellow that bought YOU, and that was all that HE\nthought about. You know it is only the public money that goes!’\nAnd the horrid creature grinned again till he actually cracked\nhimself. There is a Providence above all things, even museums.”",
        "“Providence might have interfered before, and saved the public\nmoney,” said the little Meissen lady with the pink shoes.",
        "“After all, does it matter?” said a Dutch jar of Haarlem. “All the\nshamming in the world will not MAKE them us!”",
        "“One does not like to be vulgarized,” said the Lady of Meissen,\nangrily.",
        "“My maker, the Krabbetje,[Footnote: Jan Asselyn. called Krabbetje,\nthe Little Crab, born 1610, master-potter of Delft and Haarlem]\ndid not trouble his head about that,” said the Haarlem jar,\nproudly. “The Krabbetje made me for the kitchen, the bright,\nclean, snow-white Dutch kitchen, well-nigh three centuries ago,\nand now I am thought worthy the palace; yet I wish I were at home;\nyes, I wish I could see the good Dutch vrouw, and the shining\ncanals, and the great green meadows dotted with the kine.”",
        "“Ah! if we could all go back to our makers!” sighed the Gubbio\nplate, thinking of Giorgio Andreoli and the glad and gracious days\nof the Renaissance: and somehow the words touched the frolicsome\nsouls of the dancing jars, the spinning teapots, the chairs that\nwere playing cards; and the violin stopped its merry music with a\nsob, and the spinnet sighed, thinking of dead hands.",
        "Even the little Saxe poodle howled for a master forever lost; and\nonly the swords went on quarreling, and made such a clattering\nnoise that the Japanese bonze rode at them on his monster and\nknocked them both right over, and they lay straight and still,\nlooking foolish, and the little Nymphenburg maid, though she was\ncrying, smiled and almost laughed.",
        "Then from where the great stove stood there came a solemn voice.",
        "All eyes turned upon Hirschvogel, and the heart of its little\nhuman comrade gave a great jump of joy.",
        "“My friends,” said that clear voice from the turret of Nurnberg\nfaience, “I have listened to all you have said. There is too much\ntalking among the Mortalities whom one of themselves has called\nthe Windbags. Let not us be like them. I hear among men so much\nvain speech, so much precious breath and precious time wasted in\nempty boasts, foolish anger, useless reiteration, blatant\nargument, ignoble mouthings, that I have learned to deem speech a\ncurse, laid on man to weaken and envenom all his under-takings.\nFor over two hundred years I have never spoken myself: you, I\nhear, are not so reticent. I only speak now because one of you\nsaid a beautiful thing that touched me. If we all might but go\nback to our makers! Ah, yes! if we might! We were made in days\nwhen even men were true creatures, and so we, the work of their\nhands, were true too. We, the begotten of ancient days, derive all\nthe value in us from the fact that our makers wrought at us with\nzeal, with piety, with integrity, with faith,–not to win fortunes\nor to glut a market, but to do nobly an honest thing and create\nfor the honor of the Arts and God. I see amidst you a little human\nthing who loves me, and in his own ignorant childish way loves\nArt. Now, I want him forever to remember this night and these\nwords; to remember that we are what we are, and precious in the\neyes of the world, because centuries ago those who were of single\nmind and of pure hand so created us, scorning sham and haste and\ncounterfeit. Well do I recollect my master, Augustin Hirschvogel.\nHe led a wise and blameless life, and wrought in loyalty and love,\nand made his time beautiful thereby, like one of his own rich,\nmany-colored church casements, that told holy tales as the sun\nstreamed through them. Ah, yes, my friends, to go back to our\nmasters!–that would be the best that could befall us. But they\nare gone, and even the perishable labors of their lives outlive\nthem. For many, many years I, once honored of emperors, dwelt in a\nhumble house and warmed in successive winters three generations of\nlittle, cold, hungry children. When I warmed them they forgot that\nthey were hungry; they laughed and told tales, and slept at last\nabout my feet. Then I knew that humble as had become my lot it was\none that my master would have wished for me, and I was content.\nSometimes a tired woman would creep up to me, and smile because\nshe was near me, and point out my golden crown or my ruddy fruit\nto a baby in her arms. That was better than to stand in a great\nhall of a great city, cold and empty, even though wise men came to\ngaze and throngs of fools gaped, passing with flattering words.\nWhere I go now I know not; but since I go from that humble house\nwhere they loved me, I shall be sad and alone. They pass so soon–\nthose fleeting mortal lives! Only we endure–we, the things that\nthe human brain creates. We can but bless them a little as they\nglide by: if we have done that, we have done what our masters\nwished. So in us our masters, being dead, yet may speak and live.”",
        "Then the voice sank away in silence, and a strange golden light\nthat had shone on the great stove faded away; so also the light\ndied down in the silver candelabra. A soft, pathetic melody stole\ngently through the room. It came from the old, old spinnet that\nwas covered with the faded roses.",
        "Then that sad, sighing music of a bygone day died too; the clocks\nof the city struck six of the morning; day was rising over the\nBayerischenwald. August awoke with a great start, and found\nhimself lying on the bare bricks of the floor of the chamber, and\nall the bric-a-brac was lying quite still all around. The pretty\nLady of Meissen was motionless on her porcelain bracket, and the\nlittle Saxe poodle was quiet at her side.",
        "He rose slowly to his feet. He was very cold, but he was not\nsensible of it or of the hunger that was gnawing his little empty\nentrails. He was absorbed in the wondrous sight, in the wondrous\nsounds, that he had seen and heard.",
        "All was dark around him. Was it still midnight or had morning\ncome? Morning, surely; for against the barred shutters he heard\nthe tiny song of the robin.",
        "Tramp, tramp, too, came a heavy step up the stair. He had but a\nmoment in which to scramble back into the interior of the great\nstove, when the door opened and the two dealers entered, bringing\nburning candles with them to see their way.",
        "August was scarcely conscious of danger more than he was of cold\nor hunger. A marvelous sense of courage, of security, of\nhappiness, was about him, like strong and gentle arms enfolding\nhim and lifting him upwards–upwards–upwards! Hirschvogel would\ndefend him.",
        "The dealers undid the shutters, scaring the redbreast away, and\nthen tramped about in their heavy boots and chattered in contented\nvoices, and began to wrap up the stove once more in all its straw\nand hay and cordage.",
        "It never once occurred to them to glance inside. Why should they\nlook inside a stove that they had bought and were about to sell\nagain for all its glorious beauty of exterior?",
        "The child still did not feel afraid. A great exaltation had come\nto him: he was like one lifted up by his angels.",
        "Presently the two traders called up their porters, and the stove,\nheedfully swathed and wrapped and tended as though it were some\nsick prince going on a journey, was borne on the shoulders of six\nstout Bavarians down the stairs and out of the door into the\nMarienplatz. Even behind all those wrappings August felt the icy\nbite of the intense cold of the outer air at dawn of a winter’s\nday in Munich. The men moved the stove with exceeding gentleness\nand care, so that he had often been far more roughly shaken in his\nbig brothers’ arms than he was in his journey now; and though both\nhunger and thirst made themselves felt, being foes that will take\nno denial, he was still in that state of nervous exaltation which\ndeadens all physical suffering and is at once a cordial and an\nopiate. He had heard Hirschvogel speak; that was enough.",
        "The stout carriers tramped through the city, six of them, with the\nNurnberg fire-castle on their brawny shoulders, and went right\nacross Munich to the railway station, and August in the dark\nrecognized all the ugly, jangling, pounding, roaring, hissing\nrailway noises, and thought, despite his courage and excitement,\n“Will it be a VERY long journey?” for his stomach had at times an\nodd sinking sensation, and his head sadly often felt light and\nswimming. If it was a very, very long journey, he felt half afraid\nthat he would be dead or something bad before the end, and\nHirschvogel would be so lonely: that was what he thought most\nabout; not much about himself, and not much about Dorothea and the\nhouse at home. He was “high strung to high emprise,” and could not\nlook behind him.",
        "Whether for a long or a short journey, whether for weal or woe,\nthe stove with August still within it was once more hoisted up\ninto a great van; but this time it was not all alone, and the two\ndealers as well as the six porters were all with it.",
        "He in his darkness knew that; for he heard their voices. The train\nglided away over the Bavarian plain southward; and he heard the\nmen say something of Berg and the Wurm-See, but their German was\nstrange to him, and he could not make out what these names meant.",
        "The train rolled on, with all its fume and fuss, and roar of\nsteam, and stench of oil and burning coal. It had to go quietly\nand slowly on account of the snow which was falling, and which had\nfallen all night.",
        "“He might have waited till he came to the city,” grumbled one man\nto another. “What weather to stay on at Berg!”",
        "But who he was that stayed on at Berg, August could not make out\nat all.",
        "Though the men grumbled about the state of the roads and the\nseason, they were hilarious and well content, for they laughed\noften, and, when they swore, did so good-humoredly, and promised\ntheir porters fine presents at New Year; and August, like a shrewd\nlittle boy as he was, who even in the secluded Innthal had learned\nthat money is the chief mover of men’s mirth, thought to himself\nwith a terrible pang:–",
        "“They have sold Hirschvogel for some great sum! They have sold him\nalready!”",
        "Then his heart grew faint and sick within him, for he knew very\nwell that he must soon die, shut up without food and water thus;\nand what new owner of the great fire-palace would ever permit him\nto dwell in it?",
        "“Never mind; I WILL die,” thought he; “and Hirschvogel will know\nit.”",
        "Perhaps you think him a very foolish little fellow; but I do not.",
        "It is always good to be loyal and ready to endure to the end.\nIt is but an hour and a quarter that the train usually takes to\npass from Munich to the Wurm-See or Lake of Starnberg; but this\nmorning the journey was much slower, because the way was\nencumbered by snow. When it did reach Possenhofen and stop, and\nthe Nurnberg stove was lifted out once more, August could see\nthrough the fretwork of the brass door, as the stove stood upright\nfacing the lake, that this Wurm-See was a calm and noble piece of\nwater, of great width, with low wooded banks and distant\nmountains, a peaceful, serene place, full of rest.",
        "It was now near ten o’clock. The sun had come forth; there was a\nclear gray sky hereabouts; the snow was not falling, though it lay\nwhite and smooth everywhere, down to the edge of the water, which\nbefore long would itself be ice.",
        "Before he had time to get more than a glimpse of the green gliding\nsurface, the stove was again lifted up and placed on a large boat\nthat was in waiting–one of those very long and huge boats which\nthe women in these parts use as laundries, and the men as timber\nrafts. The stove, with much labor and much expenditure of time and\ncare, was hoisted into this, and August would have grown sick and\ngiddy with the heaving and falling if his big brothers had not\nlong used him to such tossing about, so that he was as much at\nease head, as feet, downward. The stove once in it safely with its\nguardians, the big boat moved across the lake to Leoni. How a\nlittle hamlet on a Bavarian lake got that Tuscan-sounding name I\ncannot tell; but Leoni it is. The big boat was a long time\ncrossing; the lake here is about three miles broad, and these\nheavy barges are unwieldy and heavy to move, even though they are\ntowed and tugged at from the shore.",
        "“If we should be too late!” the two dealers muttered to each\nother, in agitation and alarm. “He said eleven o’clock.”",
        "“Who was he?” thought August; “the buyer, of course, of\nHirschvogel.” The slow passage across the Wurm-See was\naccomplished at length; the lake was placid; there was a sweet\ncalm in the air and on the water; there was a great deal of snow\nin the sky, though the sun was shining and gave a solemn hush to\nthe atmosphere. Boats and one little steamer were going up and\ndown; in the clear frosty light the distant mountains of\nZillerthal and the Algau Alps were visible; market people, cloaked\nand furred, went by on the water or on the banks; the deep woods\nof the shores were black and gray and brown. Poor August could see\nnothing of a scene that would have delighted him; as the stove was\nnow set, he could only see the old worm-eaten wood of the huge\nbarge.",
        "Presently they touched the pier at Leoni.",
        "“Now, men, for a stout mile and half! You shall drink your reward\nat Christmas-time,” said one of the dealers to his porters, who,\nstout, strong men as they were, showed a disposition to grumble at\ntheir task. Encouraged by large promises, they shouldered sullenly\nthe Nurnberg stove, grumbling again at its preposterous weight,\nbut little dreaming that they carried within it a small, panting,\ntrembling boy; for August began to tremble now that he was about\nto see the future owner of Hirschvogel.",
        "“If he look a good, kind man,” he thought, “I will beg him to let\nme stay with it.”",
        "The porters began their toilsome journey, and moved off from the\nvillage pier. He could see nothing, for the brass door was over\nhis head, and all that gleamed through it was the clear gray sky.\nHe had been tilted on to his back, and if he had not been a little\nmountaineer, used to hanging head downwards over crevasses, and,\nmoreover, seasoned to rough treatment by the hunters and guides of\nthe hills and the salt-workers in the town, he would have been\nmade ill and sick by the bruising and shaking and many changes of\nposition to which he had been subjected.",
        "The way the men took was a mile and a half in length, but the road\nwas heavy with snow, and the burden they bore was heavier still.\nThe dealers cheered them on, swore at them and praised them in one\nbreath; besought them and reiterated their splendid promises, for\na clock was striking eleven, and they had been ordered to reach\ntheir destination at that hour, and, though the air was so cold,\nthe heat-drops rolled off their foreheads as they walked, they\nwere so frightened at being late. But the porters would not budge\na foot quicker than they chose, and as they were not poor\nfourfooted carriers their employers dared not thrash them, though\nmost willingly would they have done so.",
        "The road seemed terribly long to the anxious tradesmen, to the\nplodding porters, to the poor little man inside the stove, as he\nkept sinking and rising, sinking and rising, with each of their\nsteps.",
        "Where they were going he had no idea, only after a very long time\nhe lost the sense of the fresh icy wind blowing on his face\nthrough the brasswork above, and felt by their movements beneath\nhim that they were mounting steps or stairs. Then he heard a great\nmany different voices, but he could not understand what was being\nsaid. He felt that his bearers paused some time, then moved on and\non again. Their feet went so softly he thought they must be moving\non carpet, and as he felt a warm air come to him he concluded that\nhe was in some heated chambers, for he was a clever little fellow,\nand could put two and two together, though he was so hungry and so\nthirsty and his empty stomach felt so strangely. They must have\ngone, he thought, through some very great number of rooms, for\nthey walked so long on and on, on and on. At last the stove was\nset down again, and, happily for him, set so that his feet were\ndownward.",
        "What he fancied was that he was in some museum, like that which he\nhad seen in the city of Innspruck.",
        "The voices he heard were very hushed, and the steps seemed to go\naway, far away, leaving him alone with Hirschvogel. He dared not\nlook out, but he peeped through the brasswork, and all he could\nsee was a big carved lion’s head in ivory, with a gold crown atop.\nIt belonged to a velvet fauteuil, but he could not see the chair,\nonly the ivory lion.",
        "There was a delicious fragrance in the air–a fragrance as of\nflowers. “Only how can it be flowers?” thought August. “It is\nNovember!”",
        "From afar off, as it seemed, there came a dreamy, exquisite music,\nas sweet as the spinnet’s had been, but so much fuller, so much\nricher, seeming as though a chorus of angels were singing all\ntogether. August ceased to think of the museum: he thought of\nheaven. “Are we gone to the Master?” he thought, remembering the\nwords of Hirschvogel.",
        "All was so still around him; there was no sound anywhere except\nthe sound of the far-off choral music.",
        "He did not know it, but he was in the royal castle of Berg, and\nthe music he heard was the music of Wagner, who was playing in a\ndistant room some of the motives of “Parsival.”",
        "Presently he heard a fresh step near him, and he heard a low voice\nsay, close behind him, “So!” An exclamation no doubt, he thought,\nof admiration and wonder at the beauty of Hirschvogel.",
        "Then the same voice said, after a long pause, during which no\ndoubt, as August thought, this newcomer was examining all the\ndetails of the wondrous fire-tower, “It was well bought; it is\nexceedingly beautiful! It is most undoubtedly the work of Augustin\nHirschvogel.”",
        "Then the hand of the speaker turned the round handle of the brass\ndoor, and the fainting soul of the poor little prisoner within\ngrew sick with fear.",
        "The handle turned, the door was slowly drawn open, some one bent\ndown and looked in, and the same voice that he had heard in praise\nof its beauty called aloud, in surprise: “What is this in it? A\nlive child!”",
        "Then August, terrified beyond all self-control, and dominated by\none master-passion, sprang out of the body of the stove and fell\nat the feet of the speaker.",
        "“Oh, let me stay! Pray, meinherr, let me stay!” he sobbed. “I have\ncome all the way with Hirschvogel!”",
        "Some gentlemen’s hands seized him, not gently by any means, and\ntheir lips angrily muttered in his ear, “Little knave, peace! be\nquiet! hold your tongue! It is the king!”",
        "They were about to drag him out of the august atmosphere as if he\nhad been some venomous, dangerous beast come there to slay, but\nthe voice he had heard speak of the stove said, in kind accents,\n“Poor little child! he is very young. Let him go: let him speak to\nme.”",
        "The word of a king is law to his courtiers: so, sorely against\ntheir wish, the angry and astonished chamberlains let August slide\nout of their grasp, and he stood there in his little rough\nsheepskin coat and his thick, mud-covered boots, with his curling\nhair all in a tangle, in the midst of the most beautiful chamber\nhe had ever dreamed of, and in the presence of a young man with a\nbeautiful dark face, and eyes full of dreams and fire; and the\nyoung man said to him:–",
        "“My child, how came you here, hidden in this stove? Be not afraid:\ntell me the truth. I am the king.”",
        "August, in an instinct of homage, cast his great battered black\nhat with the tarnished gold tassels down on the floor of the room,\nand folded his little brown hands in supplication. He was too\nintensely in earnest to be in any way abashed; he was too lifted\nout of himself by his love for Hirschvogel to be conscious of any\nawe before any earthly majesty. He was only so glad–so glad it\nwas the king. Kings were always kind; so the Tyrolese think, who\nlove their lords.",
        "“Oh, dear king!” he said, with trembling entreaty in his faint\nlittle voice, “Hirschvogel was ours, and we have loved it all our\nlives; and father sold it. And when I saw that it did really go\nfrom us, then I said to myself I would go with it; and I have come\nall the way inside it. And last night it spoke and said beautiful\nthings.",
        "“And I do pray you to let me live with it, and I will go out every\nmorning and cut wood for it and you, if only you will let me stay\nbeside it. No one ever has fed it with fuel but me since I grew\nbig enough, and it loves me,–it does indeed; it said so last\nnight; and it said that it had been happier with us than if it\nwere in any palace–”",
        "And then his breath failed him, and, as he lifted his little,\neager, pale face to the young king’s, great tears were falling\ndown his cheeks.",
        "Now, the king liked all poetic and uncommon things, and there was\nthat in the child’s face which pleased and touched him. He\nmotioned to his gentlemen to leave the little boy alone.",
        "“What is your name?” he asked him.",
        "“I am August Strehla. My father is Hans Strehla. We live in Hall,\nin the Innthal; and Hirschvogel has been ours so long–so long!”",
        "His lips quivered with a broken sob.",
        "“And have you truly traveled inside this stove all the way from\nTyrol?”",
        "“Yes,” said August; “no one thought to look inside till you did.”",
        "The king laughed; then another view of the matter occurred to him.",
        "“Who bought the stove of your father?” he inquired.",
        "“Traders of Munich,” said August, who did not know that he ought\nnot to have spoken to the king as to a simple citizen, and whose\nlittle brain was whirling and spinning dizzily round its one\ncentral idea.",
        "“What sum did they pay your father, do you know?” asked the\nsovereign.",
        "“Two hundred florins,” said August, with a great sigh of shame.\n“It was so much money, and he is so poor, and there are so many of\nus.”",
        "The king turned to his gentlemen-in-waiting. “Did these dealers of\nMunich come with the stove?”",
        "He was answered in the affirmative. He desired them to be sought\nfor and brought before him. As one of his chamberlains hastened on\nthe errand, the monarch looked at August with compassion.",
        "“You are very pale, little fellow; when did you eat last?”",
        "“I had some bread and sausage with me; yesterday afternoon I\nfinished it.”",
        "“You would like to eat now?”",
        "“If I might have a little water I would be glad; my throat is very\ndry.”",
        "The king had water and wine brought for him, and cake also; but\nAugust, though he drank eagerly, could not swallow anything. His\nmind was in too great a tumult.",
        "“May I stay with Hirschvogel?–may I stay?” he said, with feverish\nagitation.",
        "“Wait a little,” said the king, and asked abruptly, “What do you\nwish to be when you are a man?”",
        "“A painter. I wish to be what Hirschvogel was–I mean the master\nthat made MY Hirschvogel.”",
        "“I understand,” said the king.",
        "Then the two dealers were brought into their sovereign’s presence.\nThey were so terribly alarmed, not being either so innocent or so\nignorant as August was, that they were trembling as though they\nwere being led to the slaughter, and they were so utterly\nastonished too at a child having come all the way from Tyrol in\nthe stove, as a gentleman of the court had just told them this\nchild had done, that they could not tell what to say or where to\nlook, and presented a very foolish aspect indeed.",
        "“Did you buy this Nurnberg stove of this boy’s father for two\nhundred florins?” the king asked them; and his voice was no longer\nsoft and kind as it had been when addressing the child, but very\nstern.",
        "“Yes, your majesty,” murmured the trembling traders.",
        "“And how much did the gentleman who purchased it for me give to\nyou?”",
        "“Two thousand ducats, your majesty,” muttered the dealers,\nfrightened out of their wits, and telling the truth in their\nfright.",
        "The gentleman was not present: he was a trusted counselor in art\nmatters of the king’s, and often made purchases for him.",
        "The king smiled a little, and said nothing. The gentleman had made\nout the price to him as eleven thousand ducats.",
        "“You will give at once to this boy’s father the two thousand gold\nducats that you received, less the two hundred Austrian florins\nthat you paid him,” said the king to his humiliated and abject\nsubjects. “You are great rogues. Be thankful you are not more\ngreatly punished.”",
        "He dismissed them by a sign to his courtiers, and to one of these\ngave the mission of making the dealers of the Marienplatz disgorge\ntheir ill-gotten gains.",
        "August heard, and felt dazzled yet miserable. Two thousand gold\nBavarian ducats for his father! Why, his father would never need\nto go any more to the salt-baking! And yet whether for ducats or\nfor florins, Hirschvogel was sold just the same, and would the\nking let him stay with it?–would he?",
        "“Oh, do! oh, please do!” he murmured, joining his little brown\nweather-stained hands, and kneeling down before the young monarch,\nwho himself stood absorbed in painful thought, for the deception\nso basely practised for the greedy sake of gain on him by a\ntrusted counselor was bitter to him.",
        "He looked down on the child, and as he did so smiled once more.",
        "“Rise up, my little man,” he said, in a kind voice; “kneel only to\nyour God. Will I let you stay with your Hirschvogel? Yes, I will;\nyou shall stay at my court, and you shall be taught to be a\npainter,–in oils or on porcelain as you will,–and you must grow\nup worthily, and win all the laurels at our Schools of Art, and if\nwhen you are twenty-one years old you have done well and bravely,\nthen I will give you your Nurnberg stove, or, if I am no more\nliving, then those who reign after me shall do so. And now go away\nwith this gentleman, and be not afraid, and you shall light a fire\nevery morning in Hirschvogel, but you will not need to go out and\ncut the wood.”",
        "Then he smiled and stretched out his hand; the courtiers tried to\nmake August understand that he ought to bow and touch it with his\nlips, but August could not understand that anyhow; he was too\nhappy. He threw his two arms about the king’s knees, and kissed\nhis feet passionately; then he lost all sense of where he was, and\nfainted away from hunger, and tire, and emotion, and wondrous joy.",
        "As the darkness of his swoon closed in on him, he heard in his\nfancy the voice from Hirschvogel saying:–",
        "“Let us be worthy our maker!”",
        "He is only a scholar yet, but he is a happy scholar, and promises\nto be a great man. Sometimes he goes back for a few days to Hall,\nwhere the gold ducats have made his father prosperous. In the old\nhouse room there is a large white porcelain stove of Munich, the\nking’s gift to Dorothea and ’Gilda.",
        "And August never goes home without going into the great church and\nsaying his thanks to God, who blessed his strange winter’s journey\nin the Nurnberg stove. As for his dream in the dealers’ room that\nnight, he will never admit that he did dream it; he still declares\nthat he saw it all, and heard the voice of Hirschvogel. And who\nshall say that he did not? for what is the gift of the poet and\nthe artist except to see the sights which others cannot see and to\nhear the sounds that others cannot hear?",
