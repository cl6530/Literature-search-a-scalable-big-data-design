        "From the facts recorded in the foregoing pages, we have seen that\ntrue Christianity was but a continuation of that great movement\nwhich was begun in Persia seven or eight centuries before, and\nwhose gathering strength had been emphasized by the humane\ndoctrines set forth in the various schools of Greek philosophy.",
        "In the first century of the Christian era may be observed among\nvarious sects, notably the Gnostics, a desire to popularize the\nteachings of an ancient race, and to accentuate those principles\nwhich had been taught by Buddha, Pythagoras, the Stoic\nphilosophers, the Roman jurisconsults and others.  In other words\nthe object of the new religion was to stimulate the altruistic\ncharacters which had been developed during the evolutionary\nprocesses, and to strengthen and encourage the almost forgotten\nprinciples of justice and personal liberty upon which early\nsociety was founded, but which through ages of sensuality and\nselfishness had been denied expression.",
        "When we remember the tenacity with which the human mind clings to\nestablished beliefs and forms, it is not perhaps singular that in\na comparatively short time these principles were lost sight of,\nand that the entire system of corrupt paganism, with Christ as\nthe New Solar Deity, was reinstated; neither is it remarkable,\nwhen we reflect upon the length of time required to bring about\nany appreciable change in human thought and action, that the\nprinciples which this Great Teacher enunciated are at the present\ntime only just beginning to be understood.",
        "To one who carefully studies the history of Christianity by the\nlight of recently developed truths, the fact will doubtless be\ndiscovered that the fundamental difference existing between\nCatholic and Protestant sects is grounded in the old feud arising\nout of the relative importance of the sex-principles.  From the\ndays of Zoroaster to the final establishment of Christianity by\nPaul, the tendency–although slight–had been toward the\nelevation of woman, and consequently toward a greater\nacknowledgment of the female element in the god-idea. \nConsiderable impetus was given to the cause of woman’s\nadvancement through the doctrines of the various schools of\nphilosophy in Greece, and subsequently by the efforts put forth\nby the Roman lawyers to establish their equality with men before\nthe law; hence, during the first hundred years of the Christian\nera the “new religion” seems to have contained much of the spirit\nof the ancient philosophy.",
        "By several of the early Christian sects, the second person in the\ntrinity was female, as was also the Holy Ghost.",
        "In a “fragment of a gospel preserved by St. Jerome, and believed\nto have been from the original Aramaean Gospel of St. Matthew,\nwith additions, the Holy Ghost (ruach), which in Hebrew is\nfeminine, is called by the infant Savior, ’My Mother, the Holy\nGhost.’ “[142]",
        "[142] Barlow, Essays on Symbolism, p. 135.",
        "The mission of Christ was that of a Regenerator of mankind, an\noffice which had been symbolized by the powers of the sun.  He\nwas to restore that which was lost.  He attempted to teach to the\nmasses of the people the long neglected principles of purity and\npeace.  He did not condemn woman.  He was baptized by John (Ion\nor Yon) in water, the original symbol for the female element, and\nwhile in the water; the Holy Ghost in form of a dove (female)\ndescended upon him.  To those who have given attention to the\nsymbolism of the pagan worship these facts are not without\nsignification.",
        "Because of the peculiar tendency of Christ’s teachings women soon\nbecame active factors in their promulgation.  If there were no\nother evidence to show that they publicly taught the new\ndoctrines, the injunction of St. Paul, “I suffer not a woman to\nteach,” would seem to imply that they were not silent.",
        "The doctrines of the Gnostics were particularly favorable to\nwomen.  Marcellina, who belonged to this order, was the founder\nof a sect called Marcelliens.  Of her works Waite observes: “It\nwould scarcely be expected that the heretical writings of a woman\nwould be preserved amid such wholesale slaughter of the obnoxious\nworks of the opposite sex.  The writings of Marcellina have\nperished.\"[143] Not only did women teach publicly, and write, but\naccording to Bunsen they claimed the privilege of baptizing their\nown sex.  The reason for this is evident.  Before baptism it was\ncustomary for the newly-made converts to strip and be anointed\nwith oil.  After the establishment of Paul’s doctrines, however,\n“the bishops and presbyters did not care to be relieved from the\npleasant duty of baptizing the female converts.\"[144]",

        "Although the utmost care has been exercised to conceal the fact\nthat women equally with men, performed the offices connected with\nthe early church, yet by those who have paid attention to the\ntrue history of this movement, there can be no doubt about the\nmatter.  Notwithstanding the early tendencies of the “new\nreligion” toward the recognition of women, and toward the\nrestoration of the female principle in the Deity, the policy to\nbe pursued by the church was soon apparent, for Paul, the real\nfounder of the system calling itself Christian, and a man imbued\nwith Asiatic prejudices concerning women, arrogantly declared\nthat “man is the head of woman as Christ is the head of the\nChurch.”  Women were commanded to be under obedience.  Neither\nwas the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man;\nthus was re-established and emphasized the absurd doctrine of the\nLingaites, that the male is an independent entity, that he is\nspirit and superior to the female which is matter.  After this\nindication of the policy to be pursued under the new regime, it\nwould scarcely be expected that theefforts put forth by the\nvarious sects among the Gnostics toreinstate the female element\neither on the earth or in heavenwould be successful, and as might\nbe anticipated from the factsalready adduced, as early as the\nyear 325, at the council of Nice, a male trinity was formally\nestablished, and soon thereafter, the Collylidians, a sect which\nrigorously persisted in the adoration of the female principle,\nwere condemned.  At the council of Laodicea, A.D. 365, the 11th\ncanon forbade the ordination of women for the ministry and the\n44th canon prohibited them from entering the altar.",
        "The devotees of female worship, although for a time silenced,\nwere evidently not convinced, and to force their understanding\ninto conformity with the newly established order, the Nestorians,\nin the year 430 A. D., reopened the old dispute, and formally\ndenied to Mary the title of Mother of God.  Their efforts,\nhowever, were of little avail, for in the year 451, at the\ncouncil of Ephesus, the third general council, the decision of\nthe Nestorians was reversed and the Virgin Mother reinstated. \nUpon this subject Barlow remarks: “Well might those who made this\nsymbolical doctrine what it now is, at length desire to do tardy\njustice to the female element, by promoting the mother to the\nplace once occupied by the Egyptian Neith, and crowning her Queen\nof Heaven.\"[145] The fact will doubtless be observed, however,\nthat by the Romish Church the idea of the god-mother differs\nwidely from the Queen of Heaven–the original God of the\nancients.  Mary the Mother of Jesus is not a Creator, but simply\na mediator between her Son and His earthly devotees–a doctrine\nonly a trifle less masculine in texture than that of an Almighty\nFather and his victimized son.  The worship of Mary was adopted\nby the so-called Christians in response to a craving in the human\nheart for a recognition of those characters developed in mankind\nwhich may be said to contain the germ of the divine.  The\nmasculine god of the Jews was feared not loved, and his son had\nalready been invested with his attributes.  He was all powerful,\nhence a mediator, a mother, was necessary to intercede in behalf\nof fallen man, and this, too, notwithstanding the fact that woman\nhad become the “cause of evil in the world.”",
        "[145] Essays on Symbolism, p. 134.",
        "The Great Goddess of the ancients, Perceptive Wisdom, the Deity\nof giving, she who represented the purely altruistic characters\ndeveloped in mankind, and whose worship involved a scientific\nknowledge of the processes of Nature, when engrafted upon the\nso-called Christian system, although indicating an important step\ntoward the recognition of the genuine creative principles, was\nnot understood.  Although her effigies were brought from the East\nand made to do duty as representations of Mary, the Mother of\nChrist, a knowledge of her true significance lay hurled beneath\nages of sensuality and selfishness.",
        "By those who have made it their business to investigate this\nsubject, it is observed that there is scarcely an old church in\nItaly in which there is not to be found a remnant of a black\nvirgin and child.  In very many instances these black virgins\nhave been replaced by white ones, the older figures having been\nretired to some secluded niche in the church where they are held\nespecially sacred by the ignorant devotees who know absolutely\nnothing of their original significance.  We are assured that many\nof these images have been painted over, ostensibly in imitation\nof bronze, but the whites of the eyes, the teeth, and colored\nlips reveal the fact that they are really not intended to\nrepresent bronze, but figures of a black virgin goddess and child\nwhose worship has been imported into Europe from the East.  I had\nbeen told that one of the oldest of these images extant was to be\nfound in Augsburg; a thorough search, however, in all the\nchurches and cathedrals of that city failed to reveal it, but in\nthe museum at Munich such a figure is to be seen.  It is in a\nstate of decay, one arm of the mother and a portion of the\nchild’s figure being worn away.  Upon this subject Godfrey\nHiggins remarks:",
        "“If the author had wished to invent a circumstance to corroborate\nthe assertion that the Romish Christ of Europe is the Crishna of\nIndia, how could he have desired anything more striking than the\nfact of the black virgin and child being so common in the Romish\ncountries of Europe?  A black virgin and child among the white\nGermans, Swiss, French, and Italians!!!\"[146]",
        "[146] Anacalypsis, book iv., ch. i., p. 175.",
        "We have observed that during an earlier age in the history of\nreligious worship, as the female was supposed to comprehend both\nthe female and male elements in creation, a belief in the\npossible creative power of the female independently of the male\nwas everywhere entertained, and that after the schismatic faction\narose which endeavored to exalt the male, the production of a son\nby a woman unaided by man, was among the Yonigas to be the sign\nwhich would forever settle the question of the superior\nimportance of the female functions in the processes of\nreproduction, and consequently, also, her claim to the greater\nimportance in the deity.",
        "The sacred books of India show that from a former belief in one\nor the other of the two creative principles throughout Nature as\nGod, the people had come to accept both female and male as\nnecessary elements in reproduction, the latter being the more\nimportant.  In course of time this change seems to have been\nuniversal and to have extended to all the countries of the globe.",
        "As the male could not create independently of the female, or, as\nspirit was dependent on matter for its manifestations, there\narose a necessity for a Savior to redeem man from the evil\neffects arising from his relations with woman who was regarded as\nmatter, and who in course of time became the cause of evil.",
        "Concerning the doctrines which prevailed in the earlier ages of\nChristianity relative to the ancient dual principle in creation,\nand regarding the offices which were performed by the two\nelements, male and female, in the deity, we have the following\nfrom Justinus, who is said to have been contemporary with Peter\nand Paul:",
        "“When Elohim had prepared and created the world as a result from\njoint pleasure, He wished to ascend up to the elevated parts of\nheaven, and to see that not anything of what pertained to the\ncreation laboured under deficiency.  And He took His Own angels\nwith Him, for His nature was to mount aloft, leaving Edem below;\nfor inasmuch as she was earth, she was not disposed to follow\nupward her spouse.  Elohim, then, coming to the highest part of\nheaven above and beholding a light superior to that which He\nhimself had created, exclaimed: ’Open me the gates, that entering\nin I may acknowledge the Lord.’ “",
        "As he enters the Good One addresses him in the following manner:\n“Sit thou on my right hand.”  Then the soaring male principle\nsays to the Good One “permit me Lord to overturn the world which\nI have made, for my spirit is bound to men.”  To which the Good\nOne replies: “No evil canst thou do while thou art with me, for\nboth thou and Edem made the world as a result of conjugal joy. \nPermit Edem then, to hold possession of the world as long as she\nwishes; but you remain with me.”  While the father is drawn away\nfrom earth to Heaven, Edem, in the meantime is bringing woes\ninnumerable upon man.  Naas, who has received his evil nature\nfrom her, and who is a child of the Devil, has debauched Eve,\n“Henceforward vice and virtue are prevalent among men.”  The\nFather seeing these things dispatches Baruch his third angel to\nMoses, and through him spake to the children of Israel, that they\nmight be converted unto the Good One.  But the third angel, Naas,\nby the soul of which came from Edem upon Moses, as also upon all\nmen, observed the precepts of Baruch, and caused his own peculiar\ninjunctions to be hearkened unto.",
        "Again, after these occurrences Baruch, the angel of the Good One,\nwas sent to the prophets to warn them against the wiles of Edem,\nbut in the same manner Nass, the Devil, enticed them away, they\nbeing allured by him to their own destruction.  Again Elohim\nselected Hercules, an uncircumcised prophet, and sent him to\nquell the disturbance caused by Naas or Edem and to release the\nFather from their power.",
        "“These are the twelve conflicts of Hercules which He underwent,\nin order, from first to last, viz.:  Lion, and Hydra, and Boar,\nand the others successively.  For they say that these are the\nnames of them among the Gentiles, and they have been derived,\nwith altered denomination, from the energy of the maternal\nangels.  When he seemed to have vanquished his antagonists,\nOmphale (now she is Venus) clings to him and entices away\nHercules, and divests him of his power, viz.:  the commands of\nBaruch which Elohim issued.  And in place of this power Babel, or\nVenus, envelops him in her own peculiar robe, that is, in the\npower of Edem, who is the power below; and in this way the\nprophecy of Hercules remained unfulfilled and his work.”",
        "As men were still bound by the power of Edem, or the Devil, in\nthe days of Herod the king, Baruch was again dispatched by\nElohim, and coming to Nazareth delivered his message to Jesus,\nson of Joseph and Mary.  Nass, who, as we have seen, was the evil\nspirit in Edem, wished to entice away Jesus also.  He was not,\nhowever, disposed to listen but remained faithful to Baruch.\nNaas, overcome by anger at not being able to seduce him, caused\nhim to be crucified.",
        "“He, leaving the body of Edem on the accursed tree, ascended to\nthe Good One; saying to Edem, ’Woman, thou retainest thy Son,’\nthat is, the natural and the earthly man.  But Jesus himself\ncommending his spirit into the hands of the Father, ascended to\nthe Good One.  Now the Good One is Priapus, and he it is who\nantecedently caused the production of everything that exists.  On\nthis account he is styled Priapus, because he previously\nfashioned all things according to his design.  For this reason,\nhe says, in every temple is preserved his statue, which is\nrevered by every creature; and there are images of him in the\nhighways carrying over his head ripened fruits, that is, the\nproduce of the creation, of which he is the cause, having in the\nfirst instance formed, according to his design, the creation,\nwhen as yet it had no existence.\"[147]",

        "Thus the fact is observed not only that in the time of Paul,\nphallic worship still existed, but by the writings of Justinus\nand others is shown the manner in which the doctrine that woman\nis the cause of evil in the world became formulated and adopted\nas part and parcel of the Christian belief.",
        "Staniland Wake, director of the anthropological society of\nLondon, when commenting on the obscene myths upon which the\nChristian religion rests, remarks:",
        "“The fundamental basis of Christianity is more purely phallic\nthan that of any other religion now existing, and its emotional\nnature .  .  .  shows how intimately it was related to the older\nfaiths which had a phallic basis.”",
        "After stating that the myth of creation and that of the flood\nhave their exact counterpart in India, the Rev. Mr. Faber\nremarks that “there is no rite or ceremony directed in the\nPentateuch of which there is not an exact copy in the rites of\nthe pagans.”",
        "The Christian doctrines as established by Paul, and afterwards\nformulated into a system by the Romish Church, were adopted by\nthe ignorant multitude who, being incapable of understanding the\nhigher principles involved, accepted the allegories beneath which\nwere veiled the ancient mysteries literally, and as the highest\nexpression of divine wisdom.  Hence the comparatively recent\nobservation that the “new religion was eventually but the\ngathering in of the superstitions of paganism” is a matter of\nlittle surprise to those who have carefully examined the facts\nconnected with the growth of religious faith.",
        "Under the new regime Christ became the New Solar Deity and round\nhim were finally ranged all the myths of Solo-phallic worship\nwhich had prevailed under the adoration of Crishna at a time when\nthe higher truths underlying pure Nature-worship had been\nforgotten.",
