        "This is a book which is wanted. Thoughtful men, in every class, are\nnot afraid of theology, i.e. of a reasoned account of their\nreligion, but they want a theology which can be stated without\nconventions and technicalities; they do not at all care for a religion\nwhich pretends to do away with all mystery, but they are glad to be\nassured of the essential reasonableness of the Christian Faith; they\ndo not expect a ready-made solution of the problem of evil, but they\nwish to see it honestly faced; above all, they want to know how\nChristian truth bears on the real problems of life; the best of them\nare not at all afraid of a religion which makes big demands on them,\nbut they know well enough the difficulty of responding to those\nclaims, and their greatest need of all is to find and to use that life\nand power, coming from a living Person, without which our best\naspirations must fail and our highest ideals remain unrealized.",
        "These needs seem to me to be satisfactorily and happily met in the\nfollowing pages. My friend and chaplain, Mr. Bawlinson, has had good\nmeans of knowing what men are and what they want. He has had to do\nwith the undergraduate, with officers and men in the Army, and with\nthe ordinary civilian in parish life. He has been able to see the\nnature and needs of our British manhood at different angles, and he is\nthe sort of man with whom men are not afraid to talk. He has had good\nopportunity of diagnosing the situation, and this book shows his skill\nin dealing with it.",
        "I do not find myself in agreement with everything in these pages, but\nwhen I am conscious of difference of view, I am no less grateful for\nthe stimulus to thought. I am specially thankful that the writer has\nbeen so courageous in tackling the most difficult subjects.",
        "I know that the author’s one desire is to help men to be more real in\ntheir religion. I share his hope, and I believe that this book will do\nmuch to accomplish it.",
