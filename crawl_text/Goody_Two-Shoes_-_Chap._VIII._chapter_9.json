        "          Of something which happened to Little Two-Shoes        in a Barn, more dreadful than the Ghost in the Church;\n    and how she returned Good for Evil to her Enemy Sir Timothy.",
        "Some Days after this a more dreadful Accident befel Little Madge.\nShe happened to be coming late from teaching, when it rained,\nthundered, and lightened, and therefore she took Shelter in a Farmer’s\nBarn at a Distance from the Village. Soon after, the Tempest drove in\nfour Thieves, who, not seeing such a little creep-mouse Girl as\nTwo-Shoes, lay down on the Hay next to her, and began to talk over\ntheir Exploits, and to settle Plans for future Robberies. Little\nMargery on hearing them, covered herself with Straw. To be sure she\nwas sadly frighted, but her good Sense taught her, that the only\nSecurity she had was in keeping herself concealed; therefore she laid\nvery still, and breathed very softly. About Four o’Clock these wicked\nPeople came to a Resolution to break both Sir William Dove’s House,\nand Sir Timothy Gripe’s, and by Force of Arms to carry off all their\nMoney, Plate and Jewels; but as it was thought then too late, they\nagreed to defer it till the next Night. After laying this Scheme they\nall set out upon their Pranks, which greatly rejoiced Margery, as it\nwould any other little Girl in her Situation. Early in the Morning she\nwent to Sir William, and told him the whole of their Conversation.\nUpon which, he asked her Name, gave her Something, and bid her call at\nhis House the Day following. She also went to Sir Timothynotwithstanding standing he had used her so ill; for she knew it was\nher Duty to do Good for Evil. As soon as he was informed who she\nwas, he took no Notice of her; upon which she desired to speak to Lady\nGripe; and having informed her Ladyship of the Affair, she went her\nWay. This Lady had more Sense than her Husband, which indeed is not a\nsingular Case; for instead of despising Little Margery and her\nInformation, she privately set People to guard the House. The Robbers\ndivided themselves, and went about the Time mentioned to both Houses,\nand were surprized by the Guards, and taken. Upon examining these\nWretches, one of which turned Evidence, both Sir William and Sir\nTimothy found that they owed their Lives to the Discovery made by\nLittle Margery, and the first took great Notice of her, and would no\nlonger let her lie in a Barn; but Sir Timothy only said, that he was\nashamed to owe his Life to the Daughter of one who was his Enemy; so\ntrue it is, that a proud Man seldom forgives those he has injured.",
