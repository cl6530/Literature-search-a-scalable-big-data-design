        "FOREIGN POWERS THE ENEMIES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT–THEIR PART IN THE\nPROGRAMME OF THE REBELLION.",
        "The event of the American revolution burst upon the world as the most\nstartling era in the history of nations. Monarchical Europe had long\nenvied the proud career and inevitable destiny of these States, which had\nbeen shaken as the brightest jewels from the British Crown. Monarchs,\nEmperors, Queens, lords, princes and diplomats, who wield the sceptre of\ndominion, could not conceal the joy afforded them by a scene, which\nexecuted, promised the speedy extinguishment of the leading national power\non the globe, and the final demolition of the only altar of liberty upon\nwhich the fires of freedom had continued bright.",
        "The event created the more joy, because it was attributable partly to the\nefforts so strenuously put forth for many preceding years by the combined\nenemies of American Independence, to poison the American mind and breed\ndisunion in the ranks of a free, industrious and honest yeomanry, with a\nview to the ultimate dissolution of the bonds of the Union.",
        "These enemies, however, for some time anterior to the development of the\nfruit of their labors, had begun to despair of the cause in which they had\nengaged, and it is possible that the scheme of American wreck and ruin\nupon their part had been permanently abandoned, hence their immediate\ndemonstrations of joy at the triumph of their cause of sedition.",
        "But seeds sown, however barren the soil, seldom fail of some growth, and\nsubsequent to the presidential election of 1860, the great American\nrebellion became transparent to both friend and foe. To enumerate and\nexamine in detail the different phases of the programme of artificial\ncauses which precipitated defiance of the General Government, and gave\norigin to the chronic disorder of the people of different sections upon\nthe subject of their government, would occupy more space than has been\nallotted this brief narrative, which is more especially intended to\nembrace a readable compilation of the later movements of the enemies of\nthe Government to crown the Confederate cause with success, through the\nbloody implement of Conspiracy and Revolution in the Northern States.",
        "Having alluded to the prominent part occupied by foreign hostile powers in\nthe general scheme of Conspiracy against the Federal Government, a brief\nallusion to the part executed by the native born American will not be out\nof place.",
        "The cheek tingles with the blush of shame, when alas, it must be said\nthat the pride of the American has been humbled by his too faithful\nadherence to the grand original compact of treason, even after the second\nmost potent auxiliary to the plan had been tenderly touched with the\nwickedness of the scheme, and had withdrawn in dismay at the approach of\nthe enactment of crime so revolting.",
        "All things material and tangible have their bases and starting points, so\ntoo, had the Southern Rebellion its foundation stone laid deep and solid\nin the minds of the people by John C. Calhoun, the first great Supreme\nCommander of the germ from whence sprung the various elements of treason,\nwhich have entered into the composition of the powers seeking the\ndestruction of the Federal Government. As for the doctrine of State Rights\nas expounded by Calhoun, it is carried beyond the Virginia and Kentucky\nresolutions of ’98, to that point which renders it destructive of the end\nfor which it is claimed to be enunciated.",
        "It has been sought to carry the doctrine to that extremity beyond the\nexercise of its own reserved powers, which must inevitably bring it in\ncollision with the legitimate operation of the powers delegated to the\nGeneral Government.",
        "With this extreme, hence fallacious, doctrine of State Rights thus firmly\nimbedded in the hearts and heads of a zealous people, rendering them, upon\nconscientious principles, the ready tools of ambitious leaders, filled\nwith lust for power and place, it should not be a matter of so much\nsurprise, that, after years of uninterrupted and persistent education and\ntraining of the generations in their order, that the year of 1860 found\nthe continent trembling beneath the crack of musketry, the tread of horse,\nand the roar of cannon.",
        "As among the more important means used by designing men in aid of the\nscheme of rebellion, and the ultimate establishment of a separate\ngovernment in the South, the nucleus of which was to be the cotton states,\nsecret organizations, assuming different names and traditions in different\nlocalities in the South were established, having for their special mission\nin the meantime the privacy of the plot, and the education of the people\nto that indispensable standard of treason which would eventually lead them\nto avow their principles at the point of the sword.",
        "These organizations, in point of antiquity, are traced to a time not long\nanterior to the nullification of South Carolina in 1832, which was so\npromptly suppressed by General Jackson, then President of the United\nStates. Some of them, however, claim even greater antiquity, and point\nwith affected pride to the historical period of the American colonial\nrevolution against the taxation and tyranny of England, as the date of\ntheir origin. Whatever may be the facts as to the precise date of the\nexistence, respectively, of these disreputable cables, laid to undermine\nthe greatness and glory of the National Union, cemented as it is by the\nblood of the sires and sages of the Revolution, is unimportant to the\npurpose of the author, while the great living fact that they have been the\nmost deadly weapon in the hands of the enemy is corroborated by the\neventful history of the union of these States.",
        "Prior to the breaking out of the rebellion in 1861, these various\norganizations, being the van-guards in the general conspiracy against the\nintegrity and perpetuity of the Federal Government, had not been\nintroduced, to any great extent, in the non-slaveholding states, and in\nconsequence thereof had little or no tangibility north of the compromise\nof 1820, familiarly known as Mason and Dixon’s line. South of this line,\nhowever, they had long been standing institutions in every city, town,\nhamlet, villa and populated district throughout all of the late so-called\nConfederate States of America; vying the Palmetto in rankness of growth,\nand rivaling the rattlesnake in deadness of poison, until at length,\ngorged with their own baneful offspring, and pale with the sickness of\ntheir own stomachs, the child of secession was born unto them as a curse\nand reproach to the Southern people and the generations to follow them\nforever.",
        "On the 17th of April, 1861, the report of the gun fired upon Fort Sumter\nwas heard by every member of these secret conclaves in the South, and was\nthe signal for the opening of the outer gates of every temple of treason\nin the land.",
        "From that inauspicious moment forward to the present, no mask has hid from\nthe scorn of the Christian world treason’s hideous visage, but that\nblear-eyed monster, armed with every weapon of iniquity which devilish\ninvention could devise, has alternately, with rage and despair, rushed to\nand fro across the continent, spilling the blood of innocence.",
        "When, upon the occurrence of the Presidential election in 1860, it was\nfound that the kernel planted by Calhoun had been fostered to maturity by\nsecret organization, the blood and treasure of seven states was at once\nstaked upon the fearful result, and the disruption of the Republic and the\nerection of a slave-driving despotism upon the ruins solemnly declared. In\nthe outset, it was thought by leading political minds at the North, that\nbut little sincerity could be attached to the assertion of independence by\nthe Southern people. But as time elapsed and the contest grew more\nformidable and bloody, Northern men began by degrees to comprehend the\nmagnitude of a chronic conspiracy which had cost the life-long labors of\nits ablest advocates to prepare. And though the hosts enlisted in the\nexecution of this conspiracy for a time won the prestige of victors upon\nfields of blood, knowledge of their sincerity of purpose and the extent of\ntheir carefully collected resources at length came to every loyal man in\nthe country, and vigorous measures, corresponding to the necessity, were\nat once devised, the effects of which are now seen in the capture of\nRichmond and the surrender of Lee.",
        "Earlier than this date in the progress of the struggle, however, it became\nmanifest that the wheel of fortune would eventually turn against the cause\nof the South in consequence of her comparative weakness to contend against\na power so amply provided with the material of war as the government at\nWashington. Then it was that the project of enlarging the area of the\nrebellion, first fell upon the Southern mind as indispensable to their\ncause, now fast becoming desperate in the extreme. Hurried raids into\nborder northern states gave to the prowess of southern arms but momentary\neclat, and little or no enduring strength was added to the stability of\nthe Richmond government, beyond the plunder obtained in the line of march.\nOn the contrary, these raids, instead of being evidence of the power of\nthe South to maintain the standard of independence, were looked upon by\nthe military chieftains of the North, without apprehension further than\nthe demoralization, consequent upon the particular neighborhoods and\ndistricts thus invaded. In fact each recurring raid gave additional\ngrounds for the confident belief on the part of the North, that the\ndownfall of the rebellion was but a question of time, much sooner to be\nsolved than many people of both sections supposed. These symptoms of the\ndistress of the cause meantime did not escape the sagacity of the leaders\nof the rebellion, and as an expedient remedy, the plan of secretly\norganizing traitors in the northern states was determined upon as early as\n1862, by the political representatives and agents of the confederate\nstates, the attempt, character and success of which project will be the\nsubject of the next chapter.",
