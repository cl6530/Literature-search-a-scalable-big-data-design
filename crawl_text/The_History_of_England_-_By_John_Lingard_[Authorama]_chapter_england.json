        "It had been suggested to the king that, at the head of an army, he might\nnegotiate with greater dignity and effect. From Nottingham he despatched to\nLondon the earl of Southampton, Sir John Colepepper, and William Uvedale,\nthe bearers of a proposal, that commissioners should be appointed on both\nsides, with full powers to treat of an accommodation.[a] The two houses,\nassuming a tone of conscious superiority, replied that they could\nreceive no message from a prince who had raised his standard against his\nparliament, and had pronounced their general a traitor.[b] Charles (and his\ncondescension may be taken as a[c]",

        "Three-fourths of the nobility and superior gentry, led by feelings of\nhonour and gratitude, or by their attachment to the church, or by a\nwell-grounded suspicion of the designs of the leading patriots, had ranged\nthemselves under the royal banner. Charles felt assured of victory, when he\ncontemplated the birth, and wealth, and influence of those by whom he was\nsurrounded; but he might have discovered much to dissipate the illusion,\nhad he considered their habits, or been acquainted with their real, but\nunavowed sentiments. They were for the most part men of pleasure, fitter to\ngrace a court than to endure the rigour of military discipline, devoid of\nmental energy, and likely, by their indolence and debauchery, to offer\nadvantages to a prompt and vigilant enemy. Ambition would induce them to\naspire to office, and commands and honours, to form cabals against their\ncompetitors, and to distract the attention of the monarch by their\nimportunity or their complaints. They contained among them many who\nsecretly disapproved of the war,",

        "conceiving that it was undertaken for the sake of episcopacy,–an\ninstitution in the fate of which they felt no interest, and others who\nhad already in affection enrolled themselves among the followers of the\nparliament, though shame deterred them for a time from abandoning the royal\ncolours.[1]",
        "There was another class of men on whose services the king might rely with\nconfidence,–the Catholics,–who, alarmed by the fierce intolerance and the\nsevere menaces of the parliament, saw that their own safety depended on the\nascendancy of the sovereign. But Charles hesitated to avail himself of\nthis resource. His adversaries had allured the zealots to their party, by\nrepresenting the king as the dupe of a popish faction, which laboured to\nsubvert the Protestant, and to establish on its ruins the popish worship.\nIt was in vain that he called on them to name the members of this invisible\nfaction, that he publicly asserted his attachment to the reformed faith,\nand that, to prove his orthodoxy, he ordered two priests to be put to death\nat Tyburn, before his departure from the capital, and two others at York,\nsoon after his arrival in that city.[2] The houses still persisted in the\ncharge; and in all their votes and remonstrances attributed the measures\nadopted by the king to the advice and influence of the papists",
        "[Footnote 1: Thus Sir Edward Varney, the standard-bearer, told Hyde, that\nhe followed the king because honour obliged him; but the object of the war\nwas against his conscience, for he had no reverence for the bishops, whose\nquarrel it was.–Clarendon’s Life, 69. Lord Spencer writes to his lady,\n\"If there could be an expedient found to salve the punctilio of honour, I\nwould not continue here an hour.\"–Sidney Papers, ii. 667.]",

        "and their adherents.[1] Aware of the impression which such reports made on\nthe minds of the people, he at first refused to intrust with a commission,\nor even to admit into the ranks, any person, who had not taken the oaths of\nallegiance and supremacy; but necessity soon taught him to accept of the\nservices of all his subjects without distinction of religion, and he not\nonly granted[a] permission to the Catholics to carry arms in their own\ndefence, but incorporated them among his own forces.[2]",
        "While the higher classes repaired with their dependants to the support of\nthe king, the call of the parliament was cheerfully obeyed by the yeomanry\nin the country, and by the merchants and tradesmen in the towns. All these\nhad felt the oppression of monopolies and ship-money; to the patriots they\nwere indebted for their freedom from such grievances; and, as to them they\nlooked up with gratitude for past benefits,",
        "[Footnote 1: In proof of the existence of such a faction, an appeal has\nbeen made to a letter from Lord Spencer to his wife.–Sidney Papers, ii.\n667. Whether the cipher 243 is correctly rendered “papists,” I know not. It\nis not unlikely that Lord Spencer may have been in the habit of applying\nthe term to the party supposed to possess the royal confidence, of which\nparty he was the professed adversary. But when it became at last necessary\nto point out the heads of this popish faction, it appeared that, with\none exception, they were Protestants–the earls of Bristol, Cumberland,\nNewcastle, Carnarvon, and Rivers, secretary Nicholas, Endymion Porter,\nEdward Hyde, the duke of Richmond, and the viscounts Newark and\nFalkland.–Rushworth, v. 16. May, 163. Colonel Endymion Porter was a\nCatholic.–Also Baillie, i. 416, 430; ii. 75.]",
        "[Footnote 2: Rushworth, iv. 772; v. 49, 50, 80. Clarendon, ii. 41. On\nSeptember 23, 1642, Charles wrote from Shrewsbury, to the earl of\nNewcastle: “This rebellion is growen to that height, that I must not looke\nto what opinion men are, who at this tyme are willing and able to serve me.\nTherefore I doe not only permit, but command you, to make use of all my\nloving subjects’ services, without examining ther contienses (more than\nthere loyalty to me) as you shall fynde most to conduce to the upholding of\nmy just regall power.\"–Ellis, iii. 291.]",

        "so they trusted to their wisdom for the present defence of their liberties.\nNor was this the only motive; to political must be added religious\nenthusiasm. The opponents of episcopacy, under the self-given denomination\nof the godly, sought to distinguish themselves by the real or affected\nseverity of their morals; they looked down with contempt on all others, as\nmen of dissolute or irreligious habits; and many among them, in the belief\nthat the reformed religion was in danger, deemed it a conscientious duty\nto risk their lives and fortunes in the quarrel.[1] Thus were brought into\ncollision some of the most powerful motives which can agitate the human\nbreast,–loyalty, and liberty, and religion; the conflict elevated the\nminds of the combatants above their ordinary level, and in many instances\nproduced a spirit of heroism, and self-devoted-ness, and endurance, which\ndemands our admiration and sympathy. Both parties soon distinguished their\nadversaries by particular appellations. The royalists were denominated\nCavaliers; a word which, though applied to them at first in allusion to\ntheir quality, soon lost its original acceptation, and was taken to be\nsynonymous with papist, atheist, and voluptuary; and they on their part\ngave to their enemies the name of Roundheads, because they cropped their\nhair short, dividing “it into so many little peaks as was something\nridiculous to behold.\"[2]",
        "Each army in its composition resembled the other. Commissions were given,\nnot to persons the most fit to",

        "command, but to those who were most willing and able to raise men; and\nthe men themselves, who were generally ill paid, and who considered their\nservices as voluntary, often defeated the best-concerted plans, by their\nrefusal to march from their homes, or their repugnance to obey some\nparticular officer, or their disapproval of the projected expedition. To\nenforce discipline was dangerous; and both the king and the parliament\nfound themselves compelled to entreat or connive, where they ought to\nhave employed authority and punishment. The command of the royal army was\nintrusted to the earl of Lindsey, of the parliamentary forces to the earl\nof Essex, each of whom owed the distinction to the experience which he was\nsupposed to have acquired in foreign service. But such experience\nafforded little benefit. The passions of the combatants despised the cool\ncalculations of military prudence; a new system of warfare was necessarily\ngenerated; and men of talents and ambition quickly acquired that knowledge\nwhich was best adapted to the quality of the troops and to the nature of\nthe contest.",
        "Charles, having left Nottingham, proceeded to Shrewsbury, collecting\nreinforcements, and receiving voluntary contributions on his march.\nHalf-way between Stafford and Wellington he halted the army, and placing\nhimself in the centre, solemnly declared in the presence of Almighty God\nthat he had no other design, that he felt no other wish, than to maintain.\nthe Protestant faith, to govern according to law, and to observe all\nthe statutes enacted in parliament. Should he fail in any one of these\nparticulars, he renounced all claim to assistance from man, or protection\nfrom God; but as long as he remained faithful to his promise, he hoped for\ncheerful aid from his subjects, and was confident of obtaining the blessing\nof Heaven. This solemn and affecting protestation being circulated through\nthe kingdom, gave a new stimulus to the exertions of his friends; but it\nwas soon opposed by a most extraordinary declaration on the part of[a]\nthe parliament; that it was the real intention of the king to satisfy the\ndemands of the papists by altering the national religion, and the rapacity\nof the Cavaliers by giving up to them the plunder of the metropolis; and\nthat, to prevent the accomplishment of so wicked a design, the two houses\nhad resolved to enter into a solemn covenant with God, to defend his truth\nat the hazard of their lives, to associate with the well-affected in London\nand the rest of the kingdom, and to request the aid of their Scottish\nbrethren, whose liberties and religion were equally at stake.[1]",
        "In the meantime Waller had reduced Portsmouth,[b] while Essex concentrated\nhis force, amounting to fifteen thousand men, in the vicinity of\nNorthampton. He received orders from the houses to rescue, by force[c] if\nit were necessary, the persons of the king, the prince, and the duke of\nYork, from the hands of those desperate men by whom they were surrounded,\nto offer a free pardon to all who, within ten days, should return to their\nduty, and to forward to the king a petition that he would separate himself\nfrom his evil counsellors, and rely once more on the loyalty of his\nparliament. From Northampton Essex hastened to[d] Worcester to oppose the\nadvance of the royal army.",

        "he contrived to elude the vigilance of the enemy; and had advanced two\ndays’ march on the road to the metropolis before Essex became aware of his\nobject. In London the news was received with terror. Little reliance could\nbe placed on the courage, less on the fidelity of the trained bands; and\nperemptory orders were despatched to Essex, to hasten with his whole force\nto the protection of the capital and the parliament. That general had seen\nhis error; he was following the king with expedition; and his vanguard\nentered the village of Keynton on the same evening on which the royalists\nhalted on Edgehill, only a few miles in advance. At midnight[a] Charles\nheld a council of war, in which it was resolved to turn upon the pursuers,\nand to offer them battle. Early in the morning the royal army was seen in\nposition[b] on the summit of a range of hills, which gave them a decided\nsuperiority in case of attack; but Essex, whose artillery, with one-fourth\nof his men, was several miles in the rear, satisfied with having arrested\nthe march of the enemy, quietly posted the different corps, as they\narrived, on a rising ground in the Vale of the Red Horse, about half a mile\nin front of the village. About noon the Cavaliers grew weary of inaction;\ntheir importunity at last prevailed; and about two the king discharged a\ncannon with his own hand as the signal of battle. The royalists descended\nin good order to the foot of the hill, where their hopes were raised by the\ntreachery of Sir Faithful Fortescue, a parliamentary officer, who, firing\nhis pistol into the ground, ranged himself with two troops of horse under\nthe royal banner. Soon afterwards Prince Rupert, who commanded the cavalry\non the right, charged twenty-two troops of parliamentary horse led by Sir\nJames",

Had it not been for\nthis fatal imprudence, the royalists would probably have gained a decisive\nvictory.",
        "During his absence the main bodies of infantry were engaged under their\nrespective leaders, the earls of Lindsey and Essex, both of whom,\ndismounting, led their men into action on foot. The cool and determined\ncourage of the Roundheads undeceived and disconcerted the Cavaliers.\nThe royal horse on the left, a weak body under lord Wilmot, had sought\nprotection behind a regiment of pikemen; and Sir William Balfour, the\nparliamentary commander, leaving a few squadrons to keep them at bay,\nwheeled round on the flank of the royal infantry, broke through two\ndivisions, and made himself master of a battery of cannon. In another part\nof the field the king’s guards, with his standard, bore down every corps\nthat opposed them, till Essex ordered two regiments of infantry and a\nsquadron of horse to charge them in front and flank, whilst Balfour,\nabandoning the guns which he had taken, burst on them from the rear. They\nnow broke; Sir Edward Varner was slain, and the standard which he bore was\ntaken; the earl of Lindsey received a mortal wound; and his son, the lord\nWilloughby, was made prisoner in the attempt to rescue his father[1].\nCharles, who, attended by his troop of pensioners, watched the fortune of\nthe field, beheld with dismay the slaughter of his guards;",

        "and ordering the reserve to advance, placed himself at their head; but\nat the moment Rupert and the cavalry reappeared; and, though they had\nwithdrawn from Keynton to avoid, the approach of Hampden with the rear of\nthe parliamentary army, their presence restored the hopes of the royalists\nand damped the ardour of their opponents. A breathing-time succeeded; the\nfiring ceased on both sides, and the adverse armies stood gazing at each\nother till the darkness induced them to withdraw,–the royalists to their\nfirst position on the hills, and the parliamentarians to the village of\nKeynton. From the conflicting statements of the parties, it is impossible\nto estimate their respective losses. Most writers make the number of the\nslain to amount to five thousand; but the clergyman of the place, who\nsuperintended the burial of the dead, reduces it to about one thousand two\nhundred men.[1]",
        "Both armies claimed the honour, neither reaped the benefit, of victory.\nEssex, leaving the king to pursue his march, withdrew to Warwick, and\nthence to Coventry; Charles, having compelled the garrison[a] of Banbury to\nsurrender, turned aside to the city of Oxford. Each commander wished for\nleisure to",
        "[Footnote 1: This is the most consistent account of the battle, which I can\nform out of the numerous narratives in Clarendon, May, Ludlow, Heath, &c.\nLord Wharton, to silence the alarm in London, on his arrival from the\narmy, assured the two houses that the loss did not exceed three hundred\nmen.–Journ. v. 423. The prince of Wales, about twelve years old, who was\non horseback in a field under the care of Sir John Hinton, had a narrow\nescape, “One of the troopers observing you,” says Hinton, “came in fall\ncareer towards your highness. I received his charge, and, having spent a\npistol or two on each other, I dismounted him in the closing, but being\narmed cap-a-pie I could do no execution on him with my sword: at which\ninstant one Mr. Matthews, a gentleman pensioner, rides in, and with a\npole-axe decides the business.\"–MS. in my possession.]",

The two houses, though they\nassumed the laurels of victory, felt alarm at the proximity of the\nroyalists, and at occasional visits from parties of cavalry. They ordered\nEssex to come to their protection; they[a] wrote for assistance from\nScotland; they formed a new army under the earl of Warwick; they voted an\naddress to the king; they even submitted to his refusal of receiving as\none of their deputies Sir John Evelyn, whom he had previously pronounced a\ntraitor.[1] In the meanwhile the royal army, leaving Oxford, loitered-for\nwhat reason is unknown-in the vicinity of Reading, and permitted Essex\nto march without molestation by the more eastern road to the capital.\nKingston, Acton, and Windsor were already garrisoned[b] for the parliament;\nand the only open passage to London lay through the town of Brentford.\nCharles had reached Colnbrook in this direction, when he was[c] met by the\ncommissioners, who prevailed on him to suspend his march. The conference\nlasted two days; on the second of which Essex threw a brigade,[d]\nconsisting of three of his best regiments, into that town. Charles felt\nindignant at this proceeding. It was in his opinion a breach of faith; and\ntwo days[e] later, after an obstinate resistance on the part of the enemy,\nhe gained possession of Brentford, having driven part of the garrison into\nthe river, and taken fifteen pieces of cannon and five hundred men. The\nlatter he ordered to be discharged, leaving it to their option either to\nenter among his followers or to",

        "This action put an end to the projected treaty. The parliament reproached\nthe king that, while he professed the strongest repugnance to shed the\nblood of Englishmen, he had surprised and murdered their adherents at\nBrentford, unsuspicious as they were, and relying on the security of a\npretended negotiation. Charles indignantly retorted the charge on his\naccusers. They were the real deceivers, who sought to keep him inactive\nin his position, till they had surrounded him with the multitude of\ntheir adherents. In effect his situation daily became more critical. His\nopponents had summoned forces from every quarter to London, and Essex found\nhimself at the head of twenty-four thousand men. The two armies faced[a]\neach other a whole day on Turnham Green; but neither ventured to charge,\nand the king, understanding that the corps which, defended the bridge\nat Kingston had been withdrawn, retreated first to Beading, and then to\nOxford. Probably he found himself too weak to cope with the superior number\nof his adversaries; publicly he alleged his unwillingness to oppose by a\nbattle any further obstacle to a renewal of the treaty.[2]",
        "The whole kingdom at this period exhibited a most melancholy spectacle.\nNo man was suffered to remain neuter. Each county, town, and hamlet was\ndivided into factions, seeking the ruin. of each other. All stood upon\ntheir guard, while the most active of either",

The two great armies, in defiance of the\nprohibitions of their leaders, plundered wherever they came, and their\nexample was faithfully copied by the smaller bodies of armed men in other\ndistricts. The intercourse between distant parts of the country was\ninterrupted; the operations of commerce were suspended; and every person\npossessed of property was compelled to contribute after a certain rate\nto the support of that cause which obtained the superiority in his\nneighbourhood. In Oxford and its vicinity, in the four northern counties,\nin Wales, Shropshire, and Worcestershire, the royalists triumphed without\nopposition; in the metropolis, and the adjoining counties, on the southern\nand eastern coast, the superiority of the parliament was equally decisive.\nBut in many parts the adherents of both were intermixed in such different\nproportions, and their power and exertions were so variously affected by\nthe occurrences of each succeeding day, that it became difficult to decide\nwhich of the two parties held the preponderance. But there were four\ncounties, those of York, Chester, Devon, and Cornwall, in which the leaders\nhad[a] already learned to abhor the evils of civil dissension. They met\non both sides, and entered into engagements to suspend their political\nanimosities, to aid each other in putting down the disturbers of the public\npeace, and to oppose the introduction, of any armed force, without the\njoint consent both of the king and the parliament. Had the other counties\nfollowed the example, the war would have been ended almost as soon as it\nbegan. But this was a consummation which the patriots deprecated. They\npronounced such engagements",

It spread rapidly through the whole kingdom; it\nmanifested itself without disguise even in the metropolis. Mea were anxious\nto free themselves from the forced contribution of one-twentieth part of\ntheir estates for the support of the parliamentary army[2] and the citizens\ncould not forget the alarm which had been created by the late approach\nof the royal forces.

        "Here the reader may pause, and, before he proceeds to the events of the\nnext campaign, may take a view of the different financial expedients\nadopted by the contending parties. Want of money was an evil which pressed\nequally on both; but it was more easily borne by the patriots, who\npossessed an abundant resource in the riches of the capital, and were less\nrestrained in their demands by considerations of delicacy or justice. 1.\nThey were able on sudden emergencies to raise considerable supplies by loan\nfrom the merchants of the city, who seldom dared to refuse, or, if they\ndid, were compelled to yield by menaces of distraint and imprisonment. For\nall such advances interest was promised at the usual rate of eight per\ncent., and “the public faith was pledged for the repayment of the capital.\"\n2. When the parliament ordered their first levy of soldiers, many of their\npartisans subscribed considerable sums in money, or plate, or arms, or\nprovisions. But it was soon asked, why the burthen should fall exclusively\non the well-affected; and the houses improved the hint to ordain that all\nnon-subscribers, both in the city and in the country, should be compelled\nto contribute the twentieth part of their estates towards the support of\nthe common cause. 3. Still the wants of the army daily increased, and, as a\ntemporary resource, an order was made that each county should provide for\nthe subsistence of the men whom it had furnished; 4. and this was followed\nby a more permanent expedient, a weekly assessment of ten thousand pounds\non the city of London, and of twenty-four thousand pounds on the rest of\nthe kingdom, to be levied by county-rates after the manner of subsidies. 5.\nIn addition, the estates both real and personal of all delinquents, that\nis, of all individuals who had borne arms for the king, or supplied him\nwith money, or in any manner, or under any pretence, had opposed the\nparliament, were sequestrated from the owners, and placed under the\nmanagement of certain commissioners empowered to receive the rents, to\nseize the moneys and goods, to sue for debts, and to pay the proceeds into\nthe treasury. 6. In the next place came the excise, a branch of taxation of\nexotic origin, and hitherto unknown in the kingdom. To it many objections\nwere made; but the ample and constant supply which it promised insured its\nadoption; and after a succession of debates and conferences, which occupied\nthe houses during three months, the new duties, which were in most\ninstances to be paid by the first purchaser, were imposed both on the\narticles already subject to the customs, and on a numerous class of\ncommodities of indigenous growth or manufacture.[1] Lastly, in aid of these\nseveral sources of revenue, the houses did not refuse another of a more\nsingular description. It was customary for many of the patriots to observe\na weekly fast for the success of their cause; and, that their purses might\nnot profit by the exercise of their piety,",
        "[Footnote 1: It should be observed that the excise in its very infancy\nextended to strong beer, ale, cider, perry, wine, oil, figs, sugar,\nraisins, pepper, salt, silk, tobacco, soap, strong waters, and even flesh\nmeat, whether it were exposed for sale in the market, or killed by private\nfamilies for their own consumption.–Journals, vi. 372.] they were careful\nto pay into the treasury the price of the meal from which they had\nabstained. If others would not fast, it was at least possible to make them\npay; and commissioners were appointed by ordinance to go through the city,\nto rate every housekeeper at the price of one meal for his family, and to\ncollect the money on every Tuesday during the next six months. By these\nexpedients the two houses contrived to carry on the war, though their\npecuniary embarrassments were continually multiplied by the growing\naccumulation of their debts, and the unavoidable increase of their\nexpenditure.[1] With respect to the king, his first resource was in the\nsale of his plate and jewels, his next in the generous devotion of his\nadherents, many of whom served him during the whole war at their own cost,\nand, rather than become a burthen to their sovereign, mortgaged their last\nacre, and left themselves and their families without the means of future\nsubsistence. As soon as he had set up his standard, he solicited loans from\nhis friends, pledging his word to requite their promptitude, and allotting\ncertain portions of the crown lands for their repayment–a very precarious\nsecurity as long as the issue of the contest should remain uncertain. But\nthe appeal was not made in vain.

That he prepared for the resumption of\nhostilities is indeed true, but the reason which he gives to the queen is\nsatisfactory, “the improbability that this present treaty should produce\na peace, considering the great strange difference (if not contrariety) of\ngrounds that are betwixt the rebels’ propositions and mine, and that I\ncannot alter mine, nor will they ever theirs, until they be out of the hope\nto prevail by force” (p. 146). Nor do I see any proof that Charles was\ngoverned, as is pretended, by the queen. He certainly took his resolutions\nwithout consulting her, and, if she sometimes expressed her opinion\nrespecting them, it was no more than any other woman in a similar situation\nwould have done. “I have nothing to say, but that you have a care of your\nhonour; and that, if you have a peace, it may be such as may hold; and if\nit fall out otherwise, that you do not abandon those who have served you,\nfor fear they do forsake you in your need. Also I do not see how you can\nbe in safety without a regiment of guard; for myself, I think I cannot be,\nseeing the malice which they have against me and my religion, of which I\nhope you will have a care of both. But in my opinion, religion should\nbe the last thing upon which you should treat; for if you do agree upon\nstrictness against the Catholics, it would discourage them to serve you;\nand if afterwards there should be no peace, you could never expect succours\neither from Ireland, or any other Catholic prince, for they would believe\nyou would abandon them after you have served yourself” (p. 142, 143).]",

The Irish urged\nthe precedent of Scotland; they asked no more than had been conceded to the\nCovenanters; they had certainly as just a claim to the free exercise of\nthat worship, which had been the national worship for ages, as the Scots\ncould have, to the exclusive establishment of a form of religion which had\nnot existed during an entire century. But Charles, in addition to his own\nscruples, feared to irritate the prejudices of his Protestant subjects.

They allowed of no appeal from the\necclesiastical tribunals to the civil magistrate; the parliament empowered\nall who thought themselves aggrieved to apply for redress to either of\nthe two houses.[1] This profane mutilation of the divine right of the\npresbyteries excited the alarm and execration of every orthodox believer.\nWhen the ordinance for carrying the new plan into execution was in progress\nthrough the Commons, the ministers generally determined not to act under\nits provisions. The citizens of London, who petitioned against it, were\nindeed silenced by a vote[a] that they had violated the privileges of the\nhouse; but the Scottish commissioners came to their aid with a demand that\nreligion should be regulated to the satisfaction of the church; and the\nassembly of divines ventured to remonstrate, that they could not\nin conscience submit to an imperfect and anti-scriptural form of\necclesiastical government. To the Scots a civil but unmeaning answer was\nreturned:[b] to alarm the assembly, it was resolved that the remonstrance\nwas a breach of privilege, and that nine questions should be proposed to\nthe divines, respecting the nature and object of the divine right to which\nthey pretended.

So having spent the\nwhole day about this business, I returned to my quarters; and as I took\nleave of the king, he said to me, Sir, I have as good interest in the army\nas you....

So much apparent reverence was still paid to the\nauthority of the parliament, so powerful was the Presbyterian interest in\nthe city and among the military, that they believed it would require only a\nfew concessions, and some judicious management on their part, to break that\nbond of union which formed the chief element of strength possessed by their\nadversaries. But when it became known that a friendly understanding already\nexisted between the officers and the king, they saw that no time was to be\nlost. In their alarm the measures, which they had hitherto discussed very\nleisurely, were turned through the two houses; the obnoxious declaration\nwas erased from the journals; a most extensive bill of indemnity was\npassed; several ordinances were added securing more plentiful pay to the\ndisbanded soldiers, and still more plentiful to those who should volunteer\nfor the service in Ireland.

The latter dared not act on\ntheir own discretion, but resolved to obey their instructions to the very\nletter. Proceeding, therefore, to the heath, they rode at once to the\nregiment of infantry of which Fairfax was colonel. The votes of the two\nhouses were then read to the men, and Skippon, having made a long harangue\nin commendation of the votes, concluded by asking whether, with these\nconcessions, they were not all satisfied. “To that no answer can be\nreturned,” exclaimed a voice from the ranks, “till your proposals have been\nsubmitted to, and approved by, the council of officers and agitators.\"\nThe speaker was a subaltern, who immediately, having asked and obtained\npermission from his colonel to address the whole corps, called aloud, “Is\nnot that the opinion of you all?” They shouted, “It is, of all, of all.\"\n\"But are there not,” he pursued, “some among you who think otherwise?\"\n\"No,” was the general response, “no, not one.” Disconcerted and abashed,\nthe commissioners turned aside, and, as they withdrew, were",

No one now\ncould doubt that both officers and men were joined in one common league;\nand that the link which bound them together was the “solemn engagement.\"[2]\nBoth looked upon that engagement as the charter of their rights and\nliberties. No concession or intrigue, no partiality of friendship or\nreligion, could seduce them from the faith which they had sworn to it.\nThere were, indeed, a few seceders, particularly the captains, and several\nof the lord general’s life-guard; but after all, the men who yielded to\ntemptation amounted to a very inconsiderable number, in comparison with\nthe immense majority of those who with inviolable fidelity adhered to\nthe engagement, and, by their resolution and perseverance, enabled their\nleaders to win for them a complete, and at the same time a bloodless\nvictory.",

A committee was established with power to raise\nforces for the defence of the nation: the favourite general Skippon was\nappointed to provide for the safety of the capital; and the most positive\norders were sent to Fairfax not to suffer any one of the corps under his\ncommand to approach within forty miles of London. Every day the\ncontest assumed a more threatening aspect. A succession of petitions,\nremonstrances, and declarations issued from the pens of Ireton and Lambert,\nguided, it was believed, by the hand of Cromwell.

To give weight to\nthese demands, Fairfax, who seems to have acted as the mere organ of the\ncouncil of officers,[1] marched successively to St. Alban’s, to Watford,\nand to Uxbridge.[a] His approach revealed the weakness of his opponents,\nand the cowardice, perhaps hypocrisy, of many, who foresaw the probable\nissue of the contest, and deemed it not their interest to provoke by a\nuseless resistance the military chiefs, who might in a few hours be\ntheir masters.[b] Hence it happened that men, who had so clamorously and\nsuccessfully appealed to the privileges of parliament, when the king\ndemanded the five members, now submitted tamely to a similar demand, when\nit was made by twelve thousand men in arms.

But the return of the\ncommissioners, and the publication of “the agreement” with the king,\nbitterly disappointed their hopes. It was found that Charles had indeed\nconsented to the establishment of Presbyterianism in England, but only as\nan experiment for three years, and with the liberty of dissent both for\nhimself, and for those who might choose to follow his example. Their\ninvectives were no longer pointed against the Independents; “the agreement\"\nand its advocates became the objects of their fiercest attacks. Its\nprovisions were said to be unwarranted by the powers of the commissioners,\nand its purpose was pronounced an act of apostasy from the covenant, an\nimpious attempt to erect the throne of the king in preference to the\nthrone of Christ.

That nobleman,\nwhose imprisonment ended with the surrender of Pendennis, had waited on the\nking in Newcastle; a reconciliation followed; and he was now become the\navowed leader of the royalists and moderate Presbyterians. That he might\nnot irritate the religious prejudices of his countrymen, he sought to mask\nhis real object, the restoration of the monarch, under the pretence of\nsuppressing heresy and schism; he professed the deepest veneration for the\ncovenant, and the most implicit deference to the authority of the kirk;\nhe listened with apparent respect to the remonstrances of the clerical\ncommission, and openly solicited its members to aid the parliament with\ntheir wisdom, and to state their desires. But these were mere words\nintended to lull suspicion. By dint of numbers (for his party comprised\ntwo-thirds of the convention), he obtained the appointment of a committee\nof danger; this was followed by a vote to place the kingdom in a posture\nof defence; and the consequence of that vote was the immediate levy of\nreinforcements for the army. But his opponents under the earl of Argyle\nthrew every obstacle in his way. They protested in parliament against the\nwar; the commissioners of the kirk demanded that their objections should be\npreviously removed; the women cursed the duke as he passed, and pelted\nhim with stones from their windows; and the ministers from their pulpits\ndenounced the curse of God on all who should take a share in the unholy\nenterprise.

Still he felt that he\nwas a captive, under promise not to leave the island till twenty days after\nthe conclusion of the treaty, and he soon found, in addition, that he was\nnot expected to treat, but merely to submit. How far the two houses might\nhave yielded in other circumstances is uncertain; but, under the present\nsuperiority of the army, they dared not descend from the lofty pretensions\nwhich they had previously put forth. The commissioners were permitted to\nargue, to advise, to entreat; but they had no power to concede; their\ninstructions bound them to insist on the king’s assent to every proposition\nwhich had been submitted to his consideration at Hampton Court. To many of\nthese demands Charles made no objection; in lieu of those which he\nrefused, he substituted proposals of his own, which were forwarded to\nthe parliament, and voted unsatisfactory. He offered new expedients and\nmodifications; but the same answer was invariably returned, till the\nnecessity of his situation wrung from the unfortunate prince his\nunqualified assent to most of the articles in debate. On four points only\nhe remained inflexible. Though he agreed to suspend for three years, he\nrefused to abolish entirely, the functions of the bishops; he objected to\nthe perpetual alienation of the episcopal lands, but proposed to grant\nleases of them for lives, or for ninety-nine years, in favour of the\npresent purchasers; he contended that all his followers, without any\nexception, should be admitted to compound for their delinquency; and he\nprotested that, till his conscience were satisfied of the lawfulness of the\ncovenant, he would neither swear to it himself, nor impose it upon others.\nSuch was the state of the negotiation, when the time allotted by the\nparliament expired;[a] and a prolongation for twenty days was voted.[1]",

In\na petition presented[b] by “thousands of well-affected persons in and near\nLondon,” they enumerated the objects for which they had fought, and which\nthey now claimed as the fruit of their victory. Of these the principal\nwere, that the supremacy of the people should be established against the\nnegative voice of the king and of the lords; that to prevent civil wars,\nthe office of the king and the privileges of the peers should be clearly\ndefined; that a new parliament, to be elected of course and without writs,\nshould assemble every year, but never for a longer time than forty or fifty\ndays; that religious belief and worship should be free from restraint",

Charles wrote to him\ntwo letters (Oct. 10, 28.–Carte, ii.

Of these letters the\nhouses were ignorant; but they got possession of one from Ormond to the\nIrish Catholics, and insisted that Charles should order the lord lieutenant\nto desist.

        "In the army, flushed as it was with victory, and longing for revenge,\nmaxims began to prevail of the most dangerous tendency in respect of the\nroyal captive. The politicians maintained that no treaty could be safely\nmade with the king, because if he were under restraint, he could not be\nbound by his consent; if he were restored to liberty, he could not be\nexpected to make any concessions. The fanatics went still further. They had\nread in the book of Numbers that “blood defileth the land, and the land\ncannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of\nhim that shed it;” and hence they inferred that it was a duty, imposed\non them by the God who had given them the victory, to call the king to a\nstrict account for all the blood which had been shed during the civil\nwar. Among these, one of the most eminent was Colonel Ludlow, a member of\nparliament, who, having persuaded himself that the anger of God could be\nappeased only by the death of Charles, laboured, though in vain, to make\nFairfax a convert to his opinion. He proved more successful with Ireton,\nwhose regiment petitioned[a] the commander-in-chief,",

The immediate object\nof this paper was to try the general disposition of the army. Though it did\nnot openly express, it evidently contemplated the future trial of the\nking, and was followed by another petition[a] from the regiment of Colonel\nIngoldsby, which, in plainer and bolder terms, demanded that the monarch\nand his adherents should be brought to justice; condemned the treaty\nbetween him and the parliament as dangerous and unjust; and required the\nappointment of a council of war to discover an adequate remedy for the\nnational evils. Fairfax had not the courage to oppose what, in his own\njudgment, he disapproved; the petitions were laid before an assembly of\nofficers; and the result of their deliberation was a remonstrance[b] of\nenormous length, which, in a tone of menace and asperity, proclaimed the\nwhole plan of the reformers. It required that “the capital and grand author\nof all the troubles and woes which the kingdom had endured, should be\nspeedily brought to justice for the treason, blood, and mischief of which\nhe had been guilty;” that a period should be fixed for the dissolution of\nthe parliament; that a more equal representation of the people should be\ndevised; that the representative body should possess the supreme power, and\nelect every future king; and that the prince so elected should be bound to\ndisclaim all pretentions to a negative voice in the passing of laws, and to\nsubscribe to that form of government which he",

They felt that they were supported by the general\nwish of the nation, and trusted that if peace were once established\nby agreement with the king, the officers would act dare to urge their\npretensions.

Then, in allusion to the offers formerly made\nto him by the army, he concluded with, these words:–\"Sirs, it was for the\nliberties of the people that I am come here. If I would have assented to an\narbitrary sway, to have all things changed according to the power of the\nsword, I needed not to have come hither; and therefore, I tell you (and\nI pray God it be not laid to your charge), that I am the martyr of the\npeople.”",

That\nnobleman, accompanied by the marquess of Hertford, the earls of Southampton\nand Lindsey, Dr. Juxon, and a few of the king’s attendants, deposited it in\na vault in the choir of St. George’s chapel, which already contained the\nremains of Henry VIII. and of his third queen, Jane Seymour.–Herbert, 203.\nBlencowe, Sydney Papers, 64. Notwithstanding such authority, the assertion\nof Clarendon that the place could not be discovered threw some doubt upon\nthe subject. But in 1813 it chanced that the workmen made an aperture in a\nvault corresponding in situation, and occupied by three coffins; and the\nprince-regent ordered an investigation to ascertain the truth. One of the\ncoffins, in conformity with the account of Herbert, was of lead, with a\nleaden scroll in which were cut the words “King Charles.” In the upper lid\nof this an opening was made; and when the cerecloth and unctuous\nmatter were removed, the features of the face, as far as they could be\ndistinguished, bore a strong resemblance to the portraits of Charles I.\nTo complete the proof, the head was found to have been separated from the\ntrunk by some sharp instrument, which had cut through the fourth, vertebra\nof the neck.–See “An Account of what appeared on opening the coffin of\nKing Charles I. by Sir Henry Halford, bart.” 1813. It was observed at the\nsame time, that “the lead coffin of Henry VIII. had been beaten in about\nthe middle, and a considerable opening in that part exposed a mere skeleton\nof the king.” This may, perhaps, be accounted for from a passage in\nHerbert, who tells us that while the workmen were employed about the\ninscription, the chapel was cleared, but a soldier contrived to conceal\nhimself, descended into the vault, cut off some of the velvet pall, and\n\"wimbled a hole into the largest coffin.” He was caught, and “a bone was\nfound about him, which, he said, he would haft a knife with.\"–Herbert 204.\nSee note (C).]",
        "Such was the end of the unfortunate Charles Stuart; an awful lesson to\nthe possessors of royalty, to watch the growth of public opinion, and to\nmoderate their pretensions in conformity with the reasonable desires of\ntheir subjects. Had he lived at a more early period, when the sense of\nwrong was quickly subdued by the habit of submission, his reign would\nprobably have been marked with fewer violations of the national liberties.\nIt was resistance that made him a tyrant. The spirit of the people refused\nto yield to the encroachments of authority; and one act of oppression\nplaced him under the necessity of committing another, till he had revived\nand enforced all those odious prerogatives, which, though usually claimed,\nwere but sparingly exercised, by his predecessors. For some years his\nefforts seemed successful; but the Scottish insurrection revealed the\ndelusion; he had parted with the real authority of a king, when he\nforfeited the confidence and affection of his subjects.",
        "But while we blame the illegal measures of Charles, we ought not to screen\nfrom censure the subsequent conduct of his principal opponents. From the\nmoment that war seemed inevitable, they acted as if they thought themselves\nabsolved from all obligations of honour and honesty. They never ceased to\ninflame the passions of the people by misrepresentation and calumny; they\nexercised a power far more arbitrary and formidable than had ever been\nclaimed by the king; they punished summarily, on mere suspicion, and\nwithout attention to the forms of law; and by their committees they\nestablished in every county a knot of petty tyrants, who disposed at\nwill of the liberty and property of the inhabitants. Such anomalies may,\nperhaps, be inseparable from the jealousies, the resentments, and the\nheart-burnings, which are engendered in civil commotions; but certain it is\nthat right and justice had seldom been more wantonly outraged, than they\nwere by those who professed to have drawn the sword in the defence of right\nand justice.",
        "Neither should the death of Charles be attributed to the vengeance of the\npeople. They, for the most part, declared themselves satisfied with their\nvictory; they sought not the blood of the captive monarch; they were even,\nwilling to replace him on the throne, under those limitations which they\ndeemed necessary for the preservation of their rights. The men who hurried\nhim to the scaffold were a small faction of bold and ambitious spirits, who\nhad the address to guide the passions and fanaticism of their followers,\nand were enabled through them to control the real sentiments of the nation.\nEven of the commissioners appointed to sit in judgment on the king,\nscarcely one-half could be induced to attend at his trial; and many of\nthose who concurred in his condemnation subscribed the sentence with\nfeelings of shame and remorse. But so it always happens in revolutions: the\nmost violent put themselves forward; their vigilance and activity seem to\nmultiply their number; and the daring of the few wins the ascendancy over\nthe indolence or the pusillanimity of the many.",

        "When the two houses first placed themselves in opposition to the sovereign,\ntheir demands were limited to the redress of existing grievances; now that\nthe struggle was over, the triumphant party refused to be content with\nanything less than the abolition of the old, and the establishment of a new\nand more popular form of government. Some, indeed, still ventured to raise\ntheir voices in favour of monarchy, on the plea that it was an institution\nthe most congenial to the habits and feelings of Englishmen. By these\nit was proposed that the two elder sons of Charles should be passed by,\nbecause their notions were already formed, and their resentments already\nkindled; that the young duke of Gloucester, or his sister Elizabeth, should\nbe placed on the throne; and that, under the infant sovereign, the royal\nprerogative should be circumscribed by law, so as to secure from future\nencroachment the just liberties of the people. But the majority warmly\ncontended for the establishment of a commonwealth. Why, they asked, should\nthey spontaneously set up again the idol which it had cost them so much\nblood and treasure to pull down? Laws would prove but feeble restraints on\nthe passions of a proud and powerful monarch. If they sought an insuperable\nbarrier to the restoration of despotism, it could be found only in some of\nthose institutions which lodge the supreme power with the representatives\nof the people. That they spoke their real sentiments is not improbable,\nthough we are assured, by one who was present at their meetings, that\npersonal interest had no small influence in their final determination. They\nhad sinned too deeply against royalty to trust themselves to the mercy, or\nthe moderation, of a king. A republic was their choice, because it promised\nto shelter them from the vengeance of their enemies, and offered to them\nthe additional advantage of sharing among themselves all the power, the\npatronage, and the emoluments of office.[1]",

The\nfollowing is the ground on which he attempts to justify himself.

Now there was no human probability\nthat Charles would ever be restored to his throne, but on such conditions\nas the parliament and the Scots should prescribe; and that, on their\ndemand, he would, after some struggle, sacrifice the Irish Catholics,\nwas plain from what had passed in his different negotiations with the\nparliament, from his disavowal of Glamorgan’s commission, and from the\nobstinacy with which his lieutenant, Ormond, had opposed the claims of the\nconfederates. Hence he inferred that a peace, which left the establishment\nof religion to the subsequent determination of the king, afforded no\nsecurity, but, on the contrary, was an abandonment of the cause for which\nthe Catholics had associated; and that it therefore became him, holding\nthe situation which he did, to oppose it by every means in his power.–MS.\nnarrative of Rinuccini’s proceedings, written to be delivered to the pope;\nand Ponce, 271.]",

To the\nchancellor, who, in a tone of bitterness and reprobation, enumerated the\noffences with which he was charged, he replied, that since the king had\ncondescended to treat with them as estates, it became not a subject to\ndispute their authority; but that the apostasy and rebellion with which\nthey reproached him were, in his estimation, acts of duty. Whatever he had\ndone, either in the last or present reign, had been done with the sanction\nof the sovereign. If he had formerly taken up arms, it had been to divert\nhis countrymen from the impious war which they waged against the royal\nauthority in England; if now, his object was to accelerate the existing\nnegotiation between them and their new king. As a Christian, he had always\nsupported that cause which his conscience approved; as a subject, he always\nfought in support of his prince; and as a neighbour, he had frequently\npreserved the lives of those who had forfeited them against him in battle.\nThe chancellor, in return, declared him a murderer of his fellow-subjects,\nan enemy to the covenant and the peace of the kingdom, and an agitator,\nwhose ambition had helped to destroy the father, and was now employed for\nthe destruction of the son. Judgment, which had been passed in parliament\nsome days before, was then pronounced, by the dempster, that James Graham\nshould be hanged for the space of three hours on a gibbet thirty feet high,\nthat his head should be fixed on a spike in Edinburgh, his arms on the\ngates of Perth or Stirling, his legs on those of Glasgow and Aberdeen,\nand his body be interred by the hangman on the burrowmuir, unless he were\npreviously released from excommunication by the kirk. During this trying\nscene, his enemies eagerly watched his demeanour. Twice, if we may believe\nreport, he was heard to sigh, and his eyes occasionally wandered along\nthe cornice of the hall. But he stood before them cool and collected; no\nsymptom of perturbation marked his countenance, no expression of complaint\nor impatience escaped his lips; he showed himself superior to insult, and\nunscarred at the menaces of death.",

When the ministers admonished[a] him that his punishment in\nthis world was but a shadow of that which awaited him in the next, he\nindignantly replied, that he gloried in his fate, and only lamented that he\nhad not limbs sufficient to furnish every city in Christendom with proofs\nof his loyalty. On the scaffold, he maintained the uprightness of his\nconduct, praised the character of the present king, and appealed from the\ncensures of the kirk to the justice of Heaven. As a last disgrace, the\nexecutioner hung round his neck his late declaration, with the history of\nhis former exploits. He smiled at the malice of his enemies, and said that\nthey had given. him a more brilliant decoration than the garter with which\nhe had been honoured by his sovereign.

The\ncrusade was preached by Gillespie; his efforts were successfully seconded\nby the other ministers, and in a short time four regiments of horse,\namounting almost to five thousand men, were raised under Strachan, Kerr,\nand two other colonels.

On that morning Fleetwood, who had advanced\nfrom Upton to Powick,[a] was ordered to force the passage of the Team,\nwhile Cromwell, to preserve the communication, should throw a bridge of\nboats across the Severn at Bunshill, near the confluence of the two rivers.\nAbout one in the afternoon, while Charles with his staff observed from the\ntower of the cathedral the positions of the enemy, his attention was drawn\nby a discharge of musketry near Powick. He descended immediately, rode to\nthe scene of action, and ordered Montgomery with a brigade of horse and\nfoot to defend the line of the Team and oppose the formation of the bridge.\nAfter a long and sanguinary struggle, Fleetwood effected a passage just at\nthe moment when Cromwell, having completed the work, moved four regiments\nto his assistance. The Scots, though urged by superior numbers, maintained\nthe most obstinate resistance; they disputed every field and hedge,\nrepeatedly charged with the pike to check the advance of the enemy, and,\nanimated by the shouts of the combatants on the opposite bank, sought to\nprotract the contest with the vain hope that, by occupying the forces of\nFleetwood, they might insure the victory to their friends, who were engaged\nwith Cromwell.",
        "That commander, as soon as he had secured the communication across the\nriver, ordered a battery of heavy guns to play upon Fort Royal, a work\nlately raised to cover the Sidbury gate of the city, and led his troops\nin two divisions to Perrywood and Red-hill.

Leading out the whole of his\ndisposable infantry, with the duke of Hamilton’s troop of horse, and the\nEnglish volunteers, he marched to attack the enemy in their position, and\nfought at the head of the Highlanders with a spirit worthy of a prince who\nstaked his life for the acquisition of a crown. Fortune favoured his first\nefforts. The militia regiments shrunk from the shock, and the guns of the\nenemy became the prize of the assailants. But Cromwell had placed some\nveteran battalions in reserve. They restored the battle; and the royalists,\nin their turn, began to retreat. Still they remained unbroken, availing\nthemselves of every advantage of the ground to check the enemy, and\nanxiously expecting the aid of their cavalry, which, under the command of\nLeslie, had remained in the city. From what cause it happened is unknown;\nbut that officer did not appear on the field till the battle was lost, and\nthe infantry, unable to resist the superior pressure of the enemy, was\nfleeing in confusion to the gate under the shelter of the fort. The\nfugitives rallied in Friar-street, and Charles, riding among them,\nendeavoured by his words and gestures to re-animate their courage. Instead\nof a reply, they hung down their heads, or threw away their arms. “Then\nshoot me dead,” exclaimed the distressed prince, “rather than let me live\nto see the sad consequences of this day.” But his despair was as unavailing\nas had been his entreaties; and his friends admonished him to provide for\nhis safety, for the enemy had already penetrated within the walls.",
        "We left Fleetwood on the right bank pushing the Scots slowly before him. At\nlength they resigned the hope of resistance; their flight opened to him the\nway to St. John’s, and its timid commander yielded at the first summons. On\nthe other bank, Cromwell stormed the Fort Royal, put its defenders, fifteen\nhundred men, to the sword, and turned the guns upon the city. Within the\nwalls irremediable confusion prevailed, and the enemy began to pour in by\nthe quay, the castle hill, and the Sidbury gate. Charles had not a moment\nto spare. Placing himself in the midst of the Scottish cavalry, he took the\nnorthern road by the gate of St. Martin’s, while a few devoted spirits,\nwith such troopers as dared to followed them, charged down Sidbury-street\nin the contrary direction.[1] They accomplished their purpose. The royal\nparty cleared the walls, while they arrested the advance, and distracted\nthe attention of the enemy. It was past the hour of sunset; and before dark\nall resistance ceased. Colonel Drummond surrendered the castle hill on\nconditions; the infantry in the street were killed or led prisoners to the\ncathedral; and the city was abandoned during the obscurity of the night to\nthe licentious passions of the victors.[2]",
        "In this disastrous battle the slain on the part of the royalists amounted\nto three thousand men, the taken to a still greater number. The cavalry\nescaped in separate bodies; but so depressed was their courage, so\nbewildered were their counsels, that they successively surrendered to\nsmaller parties of their pursuers.

She afterwards proved to be a French hoy;\nbut Charles waited not to ascertain the fact; the boat was instantly\nlowered, and the two adventurers were rowed safely into the harbour.[1]",
        "The king’s deliverance was a subject of joy to the nations of Europe, among\nwhom the horror excited by the death of the father had given popularity to\nthe exertions of the son. In his expedition into England they had followed\nhim with wishes for his success;",

Hist. iii.\n427, 428); yet, whoever will compare it with the other accounts will see\nthat much of great interest has been omitted, and much so disfigured as\nto bear little resemblance to the truth.

        "after his defeat at Worcester they were agitated with apprehensions for his\nsafety. He had now eluded the hunters of his life; he appeared before them\nwith fresh claims on their sympathy, from the spirit which he had displayed\nin the field, and the address with which he had extricated himself from\ndanger. His adventures were listened to with interest; and his conduct was\nmade the theme of general praise. That he should be the heir to the British\ncrowns, was the mere accident of birth; that he was worthy to wear them,\nhe owed to the resources and energies of his own mind. In a few months,\nhowever, the delusion vanished. Charles had borne the blossoms of\npromise; they were blasted under the withering influence of pleasure and\ndissipation.",

The\nparliament seemed at a loss to express its gratitude to the man to whose\nsplendid services the commonwealth owed its preservation. At Ailesbury\nCromwell was met by a deputation of the two commissioners of the great\nseal, the lord chief justice, and Sir Gilbert Pickering; to each of whom,\nin token of his satisfaction, he made a present of a horse and of two\nScotsmen selected from his prisoners. At Acton he was received by the\nspeaker and the lord president, attended by members of parliament and of\nthe council, and by the lord mayor with the aldermen and sheriffs; and\nheard from the recorder, in an address of congratulation, that he was\ndestined “to bind kings in chains, and their nobles in fetters of iron.\"\nHe entered[a] the capital in the state carriage, was greeted with the\nacclamations of the people as the procession passed through the city, and",

In parliament it was\nproposed that the 3rd of September should be kept a holiday for ever in\nmemory of his victory; a day was appointed for a general thanksgiving; and\nin addition to a former grant of lands to the amount of two thousand five\nhundred pounds per annum, other lands of the value of four thousand pounds\nwere settled on him in proof of the national gratitude.
