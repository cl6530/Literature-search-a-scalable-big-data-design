        "I’m getting to be quite a connoisseur of hotel keys as I get older. For\nten years I have been collecting these mementoes of travel and cording\nthem away in my key cabinet. Some have square brass tags attached to them,\nothers have round ones. Still others affect the octagonal, the fluted, the\nhexagonal, the scalloped, the plain, the polished, the docorated, the\nchaste, the Etruscan, the metropolitan, the rural, the cosmopolitan, the\nshirred, the tucked, the biased, the high neck and long sleeve or the\ndecolette style of brass check.",
        "I have, so far, paid my bills, but I have not returned the keys to my\nroom. Hotel proprietors will please take notice and govern themselves\naccordingly. When my visit to a pleasant city has become a beautiful\nmemory only, I all at once sit down on something hard and find that it is\nthe key to my former room at the hotel. Sitting down on a key tag of\ncorrugated brass, as big as a buckwheat pancake, would remind most anyone\nof something or other.",
        "I generally leave my tooth-brush in my room and carry off the key as a\nkind of involuntary swap, so far as the hotel proprietor is concerned, but\nI do not think it is a mutual benefit, particularly. I cannot use the key\nto a hotel 500 miles away, and so far as a tooth-brush is concerned, it\ngenerally has pleasant associations only for the owner. A man is fond of\nhis own toothbrush, but it takes years for him to love the tooth-brush of\na stranger.",
        "There are a good many associations attached to these keys, like the tags.\nThey point backward to the rooms to which the keys belong. Here is a fat\none that led to room number 33-1/2 in the Synagogue hotel. It was a\ncheerful room, where the bell boy said an old man had asphyxiated himself\nwith gas the previous week. I had never met the old man before, but that\nnight, about 1 o’clock A.M., I had the pleasure of his acquaintance. He\ncame in a sad and reproachful way, and showed me how the post-mortem\npeople had disfigured him. Of course it was a little tough to be mutilated\nby an inquest, but that’s no reason why he should come back there and\noccupy a room that I was paying for so that I could be alone. He showed me\nhow he blew out the gas, and told me how a man could successfully blow\ndown the muzzle of a shot-gun or a gas jet, but both of these weapons had\na way of blowing back.",
        "I have a key that brings back to me the memory of a room that I lived in\ntwo days at one time. I do not mean that I lived the two days at once, but\nthat at one period I occupied that room, partially, for two days and two\nnights, I say I partially occupied it, because I used to occupy it days\nand share it nights with others; that is, I tried to occupy it nights. I\ntried to get the clerk to throw off something because I didn’t have the\nexclusive use of the room. He wouldn’t throw off anything. He even wanted\nto fight me because I said that the room was occupied before I got it and\nafter I left it. Finally, I told him that if he would throw a bed quilt\nover his diamond, so I could see him, I would fight him with buckwheat\ncakes at five-hundred miles. I took my position the next morning at the\nplace appointed, but he did not appear.",
