        "You have selected your theme, chosen your characters, thought out\nevery angle of business, and mapped nearly all of your points, as\nwell as your big laugh-lines:  now you are ready to put your two-act\non paper.  Before “taking your pen in hand,” stop for a moment of\nself-analysis.",
        "You can now determine how likely you are to succeed as a writer\nof the two-act, by this simple self-examination:",
        "How much of my two-act have I thought out clearly so that it is\nplaying before my very eyes?",
        "If you have thought it all out, so that every bit of business moves\nbefore your eyes, as every point rings in your ears, you are very\nlikely to turn out an acceptable two-act–if you have not played\na “chooser’s” part, and your points are real points.",
        "But do not imagine because you are positive that you have thought\neverything out beforehand, and now have come to writing it down,\nthat your job of thinking is ended.  Not at all; there are a few\nthings still to be thought out, while you are writing.",
        "As in the monologue–because your material is made up of points–you\nmay begin nearly anywhere to write your two-act.  And like the\nmonologue, you need not have a labored formal introduction.",
        "Still, your introduction is no less comprehensively informing\nbecause it has not the air of formality.  If your characters by\ntheir appearance stamp themselves for what they are, you may trust\ncomplete characterization–as you should in writing every form of\nstage material–to what each character does and says.",
        "But in your very first line you should subtly tell the audience,\nso there cannot possibly be any mistake, what your subject is.",
        "Why are those two men out there on the stage?",
        "What is the reason for their attitude toward each ther?",
        "If they are quarreling, why are they quarreling?",
        "If they are laughing, why are they laughing?",
        "But don’t make the mistake of trying to tell too much.  To do that,\nwould be to make your introduction draggy.  You must make the\naudience think the characters are bright–precisely as the\nintroduction of the monologue is designed to make the audience\nthink the monologist is bright.  Write your introduction in very\nshort speeches.  Show the attitude of the characters clearly and\nplainly, as the first speech of our two-act example shows the\ncharacters are quarreling:",
        "                        STRAIGHT",
        "  Say, whenever we go out together you always got a kick coming.\n  What’s the matter with you?",
        "Then get into your subject-theme quickly after you have given the\naudience time to get acquainted and settled, with the memory of\nthe preceding act dimmed in their minds by the giggle-points of\nyour introduction.",
        "The introduction of the two-act is designed to stamp the characters\nas real characters, to establish their relations to each other,\nto give the audience time to settle down to the new “turn,” to\nmake them think the performers are “bright” and to delay the first\nbig laugh until the psychological moment has come to spring the\ninitial big point of the subject theme, after the act has “got\"\nthe audience.",
        "It would seem needless to repeat what has already been stated so\nplainly in the chapters on the monologue, that no one can teach\nyou how to write excruciatingly funny points and gags, and that\nno one can give you the power to originate laughter-compelling\nsituations.  You must rise or fall by the force of your own ability.",
        "There are, however, two suggestions that can be given you for the\nproduction of a good two-act.  One is a “don’t,” and the other a\n“do.”  Don’t write your points in the form of questions and answers.\nThe days of the “Why did the chicken cross the road?\"–\"Because\nshe wanted to get on the other side” sort of two-act, is past.\nWrite all your points in conversational style.",
        "Never write:",
        "What were you doing at Pat’s dinner lathering your face with a\n  charlotte russe?",
        "Write it:",
        "So you were down at Pat’s house for dinner, and you went and\n  lathered your face with a charlotte russe–I saw you.",
        "Of course when a legitimate question is to be asked, ask it.  But\ndo not deliberately throw your points into question form.  Your\nguide to the number of direct queries you would use should be the\nusual conversational methods of real life.",
        "Your subject, of course, in a large measure determines how many\nquestions you need to ask.  For instance, if your theme is one\nthat develops a lot of fun through one character instructing the\nother, a correspondingly large number of questions naturally would\nbe asked.  But, as “The Art of Flirtation” plainly shows, you can\nget a world of fun out of even an instruction theme, without the\nuse of a wearying number of inquiries.  The two-act fashion today\nis the direct, conversational style.",
        "Now for the second suggestion:",
        "Although some exceedingly successful two-acts have been written\nwith many themes scattered through their twelve or more minutes,\nprobably a larger number have won success through singleness of\nsubject.  A routine with but one subject worked up to its most\neffective height is often more likely to please.",
        "Furthermore, for the reason that the two-act is breaking away from\nthe offering that is merely pieced together out of successful\nbits–precisely as that class of act struggled away from the old\nslap-stick turn–the single-routine now finds readier sale.  The\npresent tendency of the two-act seems to be to present clever\ncharacterization–and so to win by artistic acting, as before it\nwon by cruder methods.",
        "Therefore, strive for unity of routine.  Treat but one subject and\namplify that one subject with singleness of purpose.",
        "The point, or the gag, of a two-act is very much like that of the\nmonologue.  In so far as construction is concerned–by this I mean\nlaugh-wave construction–they are identical.  Study “The Art of\nFlirtation,” and you will see how little laughs precede big laughs\nand follow after, mounting into still bigger laughs that rise into\nroars of laughter.",
        "If you were telling a joke to a friend you would be sure to tell\nhim in your very first sentence all the things he would need in\norder to understand the point of the joke, wouldn’t you?  You would\ntake great care not to leave out one salient bit of information\nthat would make him see the joke plainly–you would be as logical\nas though you were trying to sell him a bill of goods.  Take the\nsame attitude toward each point that you introduce into your\ntwo-act.  Remember, you are wholesaling your “jokes” to the\ncomedians, who must retail them to their audiences.  Therefore,\nintroduce each new point as clearly and as briefly as you can.",
        "Let us take a point from “The Art of Flirtation” and see how it\nis constructed.  The very first line the straight-man speaks when\nhe comes out on the stage unmistakably declares his relation to\nthe comedian.  When he shows the book, he explains precisely what\nit is.  And while laugh after laugh is worked out of it, the precise\nthings that the book teaches are made clear.",
        "                         STRAIGHT",
        "  No.  It ain’t ten cent love.  It’s fine love.  (Opens book)\n  See–here is the destructions.  Right oil the first page you\n  learn something.  See–how to flirt with a handkerchief.",
        "                         COMEDIAN",
        "  Who wants to flirt with a handkerchief?  I want to flirt with a\n  woman.",
        "                         STRAIGHT",
        "  Listen to what the book says.  To a flirter all things have got\n  a language.  According to this book flirters can speak with the\n  eye, with the fan, with the cane, with the umbrella, with the\n  handkerchief, with anything; this book tells you how to do it.",
        "                         COMEDIAN\n                     \n  For ten cents.",
        "Note that the straight-man does not say, “with the eye, cane,\numbrella–” and so on through the list.  He says “With the eye,\nwith the fan, with the cane–.”  There can be no mistake–as there\nmight be if the items were enumerated swiftly.  Each one is given\nimportance by the “with the eye, with the fan.”  The words “with\nthe” lend emphasis and a humorous weight.",
        "                         STRAIGHT",
        "  Shut up.  Now when you see a pretty woman coming along who wants\n  to flirt with you, what is the first thing a man should do?",
        "                         COMEDIAN",
        "  Run the other way.",
        "                         STRAIGHT",
        "  No, no.  This is the handkerchief flirtation. . . .",
        "You see precisely what the subject of this particular point is\nbecause it is stated in unmistakable words.",
        "                         STRAIGHT",
        "  . . .As soon as a pretty woman makes eyes at you, you put your\n  hands in your pockets.",
        "                         COMEDIAN",
        "  And hold on to your money.",
        "Now this is a big laugh at every performance–a sure-fire laugh\nwhen it is well done.  Note that it is the fourth line the comedian\nhas after the specific point introduction, “. . .See–how to flirt\nwith a handkerchief?”  Now the line “Who wants to flirt with a\nhandkerchief?  I want to flirt with a woman,” is not intended to\nbe a real laugh-line.  It serves as an audience settler, gives\nemphasis to the explanation of just what the book tells and helps\nto blend into the next line.",
        "There’s a first laugh on, “For ten cents.”  A bigger laugh comes\non, “Run the other way.”  And the bigest–in this point-division–\non the third laugh line “And hold on to your money.”",
        "When you have a big laugh, you must make the next line carry you\non smoothly into the succeeding lint.  It matters not whether the\npoints are all related to the same general subject or not–although\nwe are considering here only the single-routine two-act–you must\ntake great care that each point blends into the following one with\nlogical sequence.",
        "The line, “Who wants to flirt with a handkerchief?  I want to flirt\nwith a woman,” helps in the blending of the point division we have\njust examined.",
        "The straight-man’s line following the big laugh line in that point\ndivision, “No, you take out your handkerchief,” (biz. [1]) is\nanother example of the blend-line.  And it is the very first\nintroduction of the peculiar style of business that makes of “The\nArt of Flirtation” so funny an act.",
        "[1] Biz. is often used in vaudeville material for bus., the\ncorrect contraction of business.",
        "Let us continue in the examination of this example.",
        "                         COMEDIAN",
        "  Suppose you ain’t got a handkerchief?\n\n                         STRAIGHT",
        "  Every flirter must have a handkerchief.  It says it in the book.\n  Now you shake the handkerchief three times like this.  (Biz) Do\n  you know what that means?",
        "                         COMEDIAN",
        "  (Biz. of shaking head.)",
        "                         STRAIGHT",
        "  That means you want her to give you–",
        "                         COMEDIAN\n\n  Ten cents.",
        "The reason why these two words come with such humorous effect,\nlies in two causes.  First, “ten cents” has been used before with\ngood laugh results–as a “gag line,” you recall–and this is the\ncomedian’s magical “third time” use of it.  It is a good example\nof the “three-sequence mystery” which Weber and Fields mentioned,\nand which has been used to advantage on the stage for many, many\nyears.",
        "Second, the comedian had refused to answer the straight-man’s\nquestion.  He simply stood there and shook his head.  It was the\nvery simple business of shaking his head that made his interruption\ncome as a surprise and gave perfect setting for the “gag-line.”",
        "Read the speeches that follow and you will see how business is\nused.  Note particularly how the business makes this point stand\nout as a great big laugh:",
        "                        STRAIGHT",
        "  . . .Den you hold your handkerchief by the comer like dis.",
        "                        COMEDIAN",
        "  Vat does that mean?",
        "                        STRAIGHT",
        "  Meet me on the corner.",
        "                        COMEDIAN",
        "  Och, dat’s fine.  (Takes handkerchief). . . Den if you hold it\n  dis way, dat means (biz.):  “Are you on the square?”",
        "This line reads even funnier than many laughs in the act that are\nbigger, but its business cannot be explained in words.  It seems\nfunnier to you because you can picture it.  You actually see it,\nprecisely as it is done.",
        "Then the next line blends it into the next point, which is clearly\nintroduced with a grin–is developed into a laugh, a bigger laugh\nby effective business, and then into a roar.",
        "Point after point follows–each point topping the preceding\npoint–until the end of the two-act is reached in the biggest laugh\nof all.",
        "The business of the two-act, which secures its effects by actions\nthat are often wholly without words, makes the two-act more difficult\nto time than a monologue.  Furthermore, even if the time-consuming\nbits of business were negligible, the precise timing of a two-act\nby the author is not really necessary.",
        "Precisely as a monologist can vary the length of his offering by\nleaving out gags, the two-act performers can shorten their offering\nat will–by leaving out points.  Hence it is much better to supply\nmore points than time will permit to delivery in the finished\nperformance, than to be required to rewrite your material to stretch\nthe subject to fill out time.  All you need do is to keep the\ntwo-act within, say, twenty minutes.  And to gauge the length\nroughly, count about one hundred and fifteen words to a minute.",
        "Therefore, having arranged your points upon separate cards, or\nslips of paper, and having shuffied them about and tried them all\nin various routines to establish the best, choose your very biggest\nlaugh for the last. [1] Wherever that biggest laugh may have been\nin the sample routines you have arranged, take it out and blend\nit in for your final big roar.",
        "[1] See description of card system, Chapter VI, section III.",
        "Remember that the last laugh must be the delighted roar that will\ntake the performers off stage, and bring them back again and again\nfor their bows.",
        "The manuscript of a two-act is only a prophecy of what may be.\nIt may be a good prophecy or a bad prognostication–only actual\nperformance before an audience can decide.  As we saw in the\nmonologue, points that the author thought would “go big\"–\"die\";\nand unexpectedly, little grins waken into great big laughs.  There\nis no way of telling from the manuscript.",
        "When you have finished your two-act you must be prepared to construct\nit all over again in rehearsal, and during all the performances\nof its try-out weeks.  Not only must the points be good themselves,\nthey must also fit the performers like the proverbial kid gloves.",
        "More two-acts–and this applies to all other stage-offerings as\nwell–have started out as merely promising successes, than have\nwon at the first try-out.  For this reason, be prepared to work\nall the morning rehearsing, at the matinee and the night performances,\nand after the theatre is dark, to conjure giggle points into great\nbig laughs, and lift the entire routine into the success your\nability and the performers’ cleverness can make it.",
        "Even after it has won its way into a contract and everybody is\nhappy, you must be prepared to keep your two-act up-to-the-minute.\nWhile it is on the road, you must send to the performers all the\nlaughs you can think of–particularly if you have chosen for your\ntheme one that demands constant furbishing to keep it bright.",
        "It is with direct purpose that the discussion of the two-act has\nbeen confined to the kind of act that Weber and Fields made so\nsuccessful–and of which Mr. Hoffman’s “The Art of Flirtation” is\na more up-to-date, mild and artistic form.  There are other forms\nof the two-act, of course, but the kind of two-act we have discussed\nis peculiarly typical of two-act material.  It holds within itself\npractically all the elements of the two-act that the writer has\nto consider.  It is only necessary now to describe the other forms\nbriefly.",
        "By “pure two-act form,” I mean the two-act that is presented without\nsongs, tricks, or any other entertainment elements.  Yet many of\nthe most successful two-acts open with a song, introduce songs or\nparodies into the middle of their dialogue, or close with a song\nor some novelty.",
        "Do not imagine that a two-act in which songs are introduced cannot\nbe precisely as good as one that depends upon its talk alone.  It\nmay be an even better act.  If it pleases the audience better, it\nis a better act.  Remember that while we have been discussing the\ntwo-act from the writer’s view-point, it is the applause of the\naudience that stamps every act with the final seal of approval.\nBut, whether a two-act makes use of songs or tricks or anything\nelse, does not change the principles on which all two-act points\nand gags are constructed.",
        "The more common talking two-acts are:",
        "This form may or may not open and close with songs, and depends\nupon skillfully blended, but not necessarily related, gags and\njokes.",
        "This sort of act opens and closes with parodies on the latest\nsong-hits, and uses talk for short rests and humorous effect between\nthe parodies by which the act makes its chief appeal.",
        "This type makes its appeal not by the use of songs, but because\nthe voices are very fine.  Such an act may use a few gags and\nunrelated jokes–perhaps of the “nut” variety–to take the act out\nof the pure duet class and therefore offer wider appeal.",
        "Such acts may depend on precisely the same form of routine the\npure talking two-act for men uses.  Of course, the treatment of\nthe subject themes is gentler and the material is all of a milder\ncharacter.",
        "Acts of this character make use of a comedy, burlesque, melodramatic\nor even a dramatic plot.  This form of sketch seldom rises into\nthe playlet class.  It is a two-act merely because it is played\nby two persons.  Often, however, this form of the two-act uses a\nthread of plot on which to string its business and true two-act\npoints.  It may or may not make use of songs, parodies, tricks or\nother entertainment elements.  We have now come to a form of two-act\nwhich is of so popular a nature that it requires more than passing\nmention.  This is",
        "Usually presented with songs making their appeal to sentiment,\nalmost always marked by at least one change of costume by the\nwoman, sometimes distinguished by a special drop and often given\nmore than a nucleus of plot, this very popular form of two-act\nsometimes rises into the dignity of a little production.  Indeed,\nmany two-acts of this kind have been so successful in their little\nform they have been expanded into miniature musical comedies [1].",
        "[1] See Chapter XXX, The One-Act Musical Comedy.",
        "(a) Romance is the chief source of the flirtation two-act’s\nappeal.  It is the dream-love in the heart of every person in the\naudience which makes this form of two-act “go” so well.  Moonlight,\na girl and a man–this is the recipe.",
        "(b) Witty Dialogue that fences with love, that thrusts, parries\nand–surrenders, is what makes the flirtation two-act “get over.\"\nIt is the same kind of dialogue that made Anthony Hope’s “Dolly\nDialogues” so successful in their day, the sort of speeches which\nwe, in real life, think of afterward and wish we had made.",
        "(c) Daintiness of effect is what is needed in this form of\ntwo-act.  Dialogue and business, scenery, lights and music all\ncombine to the fulfillment of its purpose.  The cruder touches of\nother two-act forms are forgotten and the entire effort is\nconcentrated on making an appeal to the “ideal.”  Turn to the\nAppendix, and read “After the Shower,” and you will see how these\nvarious elements are unified.  This famous flirtation two-act has\nbeen chosen because it shows practically all the elements we have\ndiscussed.",
