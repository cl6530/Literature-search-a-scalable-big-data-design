        "HOW GEORGE, ONCE UPON A TIME, GOT UP EARLY IN THE MORNING. – GEORGE, \nHARRIS, AND MONTMORENCY DO NOT LIKE THE LOOK OF THE COLD WATER. – HEROISM \nAND DETERMINATION ON THE PART OF J. – GEORGE AND HIS SHIRT: STORY WITH A \nMORAL. – HARRIS AS COOK. – HISTORICAL RETROSPECT, SPECIALLY INSERTED FOR \nTHE USE OF SCHOOLS.",
        "I WOKE at six the next morning; and found George awake too.  We both \nturned round, and tried to go to sleep again, but we could not.  Had \nthere been any particular reason why we should not have gone to sleep \nagain, but have got up and dressed then and there, we should have dropped \noff while we were looking at our watches, and have slept till ten.  As \nthere was no earthly necessity for our getting up under another two hours \nat the very least, and our getting up at that time was an utter \nabsurdity, it was only in keeping with the natural cussedness of things \nin general that we should both feel that lying down for five minutes more \nwould be death to us.",
        "George said that the same kind of thing, only worse, had happened to him \nsome eighteen months ago, when he was lodging by himself in the house of \na certain Mrs. Gippings.  He said his watch went wrong one evening, and \nstopped at a quarter-past eight.  He did not know this at the time \nbecause, for some reason or other, he forgot to wind it up when he went \nto bed (an unusual occurrence with him), and hung it up over his pillow \nwithout ever looking at the thing.",
        "It was in the winter when this happened, very near the shortest day, and \na week of fog into the bargain, so the fact that it was still very dark \nwhen George woke in the morning was no guide to him as to the time.  He \nreached up, and hauled down his watch.  It was a quarter-past eight.",
        "“Angels and ministers of grace defend us!” exclaimed George; “and here \nhave I got to be in the City by nine.  Why didn’t somebody call me?  Oh, \nthis is a shame!”  And he flung the watch down, and sprang out of bed, \nand had a cold bath, and washed himself, and dressed himself, and shaved \nhimself in cold water because there was not time to wait for the hot, and \nthen rushed and had another look at the watch.",
        "Whether the shaking it had received in being thrown down on the bed had \nstarted it, or how it was, George could not say, but certain it was that \nfrom a quarter-past eight it had begun to go, and now pointed to twenty \nminutes to nine.",
        "George snatched it up, and rushed downstairs.  In the sitting-room, all \nwas dark and silent: there was no fire, no breakfast.  George said it was \na wicked shame of Mrs. G., and he made up his mind to tell her what he \nthought of her when he came home in the evening.  Then he dashed on his \ngreat-coat and hat, and, seizing his umbrella, made for the front door.  \nThe door was not even unbolted.  George anathematized Mrs. G. for a lazy \nold woman, and thought it was very strange that people could not get up \nat a decent, respectable time, unlocked and unbolted the door, and ran \nout.",
        "He ran hard for a quarter of a mile, and at the end of that distance it \nbegan to be borne in upon him as a strange and curious thing that there \nwere so few people about, and that there were no shops open.  It was \ncertainly a very dark and foggy morning, but still it seemed an unusual \ncourse to stop all business on that account.  HE had to go to business: \nwhy should other people stop in bed merely because it was dark and foggy!",
        "At length he reached Holborn.  Not a shutter was down! not a bus was \nabout!  There were three men in sight, one of whom was a policeman; a \nmarket-cart full of cabbages, and a dilapidated looking cab.  George \npulled out his watch and looked at it: it was five minutes to nine!  He \nstood still and counted his pulse.  He stooped down and felt his legs.  \nThen, with his watch still in his hand, he went up to the policeman, and \nasked him if he knew what the time was.",
        "“What’s the time?” said the man, eyeing George up and down with evident \nsuspicion; “why, if you listen you will hear it strike.”",
        "George listened, and a neighbouring clock immediately obliged.",
        "“But it’s only gone three!” said George in an injured tone, when it had \nfinished.",
        "“Well, and how many did you want it to go?” replied the constable.",
        "“Why, nine,” said George, showing his watch.",
        "“Do you know where you live?” said the guardian of public order, \nseverely.",
        "George thought, and gave the address.",
        "“Oh! that’s where it is, is it?” replied the man; “well, you take my \nadvice and go there quietly, and take that watch of yours with you; and \ndon’t let’s have any more of it.”",
        "And George went home again, musing as he walked along, and let himself \nin.",
        "At first, when he got in, he determined to undress and go to bed again; \nbut when he thought of the redressing and re-washing, and the having of \nanother bath, he determined he would not, but would sit up and go to \nsleep in the easy-chair.",
        "But he could not get to sleep: he never felt more wakeful in his life; so \nhe lit the lamp and got out the chess-board, and played himself a game of \nchess.  But even that did not enliven him: it seemed slow somehow; so he \ngave chess up and tried to read.  He did not seem able to take any sort \nof interest in reading either, so he put on his coat again and went out \nfor a walk.",
        "It was horribly lonesome and dismal, and all the policemen he met \nregarded him with undisguised suspicion, and turned their lanterns on him \nand followed him about, and this had such an effect upon him at last that \nhe began to feel as if he really had done something, and he got to \nslinking down the by-streets and hiding in dark doorways when he heard \nthe regulation flip-flop approaching.",
        "Of course, this conduct made the force only more distrustful of him than \never, and they would come and rout him out and ask him what he was doing \nthere; and when he answered, “Nothing,” he had merely come out for a \nstroll (it was then four o’clock in the morning), they looked as though \nthey did not believe him, and two plain-clothes constables came home with \nhim to see if he really did live where he had said he did.  They saw him \ngo in with his key, and then they took up a position opposite and watched \nthe house.",
        "He thought he would light the fire when he got inside, and make himself \nsome breakfast, just to pass away the time; but he did not seem able to \nhandle anything from a scuttleful of coals to a teaspoon without dropping \nit or falling over it, and making such a noise that he was in mortal fear \nthat it would wake Mrs. G. up, and that she would think it was burglars \nand open the window and call “Police!” and then these two detectives \nwould rush in and handcuff him, and march him off to the police-court.",
        "He was in a morbidly nervous state by this time, and he pictured the \ntrial, and his trying to explain the circumstances to the jury, and \nnobody believing him, and his being sentenced to twenty years’ penal \nservitude, and his mother dying of a broken heart.  So he gave up trying \nto get breakfast, and wrapped himself up in his overcoat and sat in the \neasy-chair till Mrs. G came down at half-past seven.",
        "He said he had never got up too early since that morning: it had been \nsuch a warning to him.",
        "We had been sitting huddled up in our rugs while George had been telling \nme this true story, and on his finishing it I set to work to wake up \nHarris with a scull.  The third prod did it: and he turned over on the \nother side, and said he would be down in a minute, and that he would have \nhis lace-up boots.  We soon let him know where he was, however, by the \naid of the hitcher, and he sat up suddenly, sending Montmorency, who had \nbeen sleeping the sleep of the just right on the middle of his chest, \nsprawling across the boat.",
        "Then we pulled up the canvas, and all four of us poked our heads out over \nthe off-side, and looked down at the water and shivered.  The idea, \novernight, had been that we should get up early in the morning, fling off \nour rugs and shawls, and, throwing back the canvas, spring into the river \nwith a joyous shout, and revel in a long delicious swim.  Somehow, now \nthe morning had come, the notion seemed less tempting.  The water looked \ndamp and chilly: the wind felt cold.",
        "“Well, who’s going to be first in?” said Harris at last.",
        "There was no rush for precedence.  George settled the matter so far as he \nwas concerned by retiring into the boat and pulling on his socks.  \nMontmorency gave vent to an involuntary howl, as if merely thinking of \nthe thing had given him the horrors; and Harris said it would be so \ndifficult to get into the boat again, and went back and sorted out his \ntrousers.",
        "I did not altogether like to give in, though I did not relish the plunge.  \nThere might be snags about, or weeds, I thought.  I meant to compromise \nmatters by going down to the edge and just throwing the water over \nmyself; so I took a towel and crept out on the bank and wormed my way \nalong on to the branch of a tree that dipped down into the water.",
        "It was bitterly cold.  The wind cut like a knife.  I thought I would not \nthrow the water over myself after all.  I would go back into the boat and \ndress; and I turned to do so; and, as I turned, the silly branch gave \nway, and I and the towel went in together with a tremendous splash, and I \nwas out mid-stream with a gallon of Thames water inside me before I knew \nwhat had happened.",
        "“By Jove! old J.’s gone in,” I heard Harris say, as I came blowing to the \nsurface.  “I didn’t think he’d have the pluck to do it.  Did you?”",
        "“Is it all right?” sung out George.",
        "“Lovely,” I spluttered back.  “You are duffers not to come in.  I \nwouldn’t have missed this for worlds.  Why won’t you try it?  It only \nwants a little determination.”",
        "But I could not persuade them.",
        "Rather an amusing thing happened while dressing that morning.  I was very \ncold when I got back into the boat, and, in my hurry to get my shirt on, \nI accidentally jerked it into the water.  It made me awfully wild, \nespecially as George burst out laughing.  I could not see anything to \nlaugh at, and I told George so, and he only laughed the more.  I never \nsaw a man laugh so much.  I quite lost my temper with him at last, and I \npointed out to him what a drivelling maniac of an imbecile idiot he was; \nbut he only roared the louder.  And then, just as I was landing the \nshirt, I noticed that it was not my shirt at all, but George’s, which I \nhad mistaken for mine; whereupon the humour of the thing struck me for \nthe first time, and I began to laugh.  And the more I looked from \nGeorge’s wet shirt to George, roaring with laughter, the more I was \namused, and I laughed so much that I had to let the shirt fall back into \nthe water again.",
        "“Ar’n’t you – you – going to get it out?” said George, between his \nshrieks.",
        "I could not answer him at all for a while, I was laughing so, but, at \nlast, between my peals I managed to jerk out:",
        "“It isn’t my shirt – it’s YOURS!”",
        "I never saw a man’s face change from lively to severe so suddenly in all \nmy life before.",
        "“What!” he yelled, springing up.  “You silly cuckoo!  Why can’t you be \nmore careful what you’re doing?  Why the deuce don’t you go and dress on \nthe bank?  You’re not fit to be in a boat, you’re not.  Gimme the \nhitcher.”",
        "I tried to make him see the fun of the thing, but he could not.  George \nis very dense at seeing a joke sometimes.",
        "Harris proposed that we should have scrambled eggs for breakfast.  He \nsaid he would cook them.  It seemed, from his account, that he was very \ngood at doing scrambled eggs.  He often did them at picnics and when out \non yachts.  He was quite famous for them.  People who had once tasted his \nscrambled eggs, so we gathered from his conversation, never cared for any \nother food afterwards, but pined away and died when they could not get \nthem.",
        "It made our mouths water to hear him talk about the things, and we handed \nhim out the stove and the frying-pan and all the eggs that had not \nsmashed and gone over everything in the hamper, and begged him to begin.",
        "He had some trouble in breaking the eggs – or rather not so much trouble \nin breaking them exactly as in getting them into the frying-pan when \nbroken, and keeping them off his trousers, and preventing them from \nrunning up his sleeve; but he fixed some half-a-dozen into the pan at \nlast, and then squatted down by the side of the stove and chivied them \nabout with a fork.",
        "It seemed harassing work, so far as George and I could judge.  Whenever \nhe went near the pan he burned himself, and then he would drop everything \nand dance round the stove, flicking his fingers about and cursing the \nthings.  Indeed, every time George and I looked round at him he was sure \nto be performing this feat.  We thought at first that it was a necessary \npart of the culinary arrangements.",
        "We did not know what scrambled eggs were, and we fancied that it must be \nsome Red Indian or Sandwich Islands sort of dish that required dances and \nincantations for its proper cooking.  Montmorency went and put his nose \nover it once, and the fat spluttered up and scalded him, and then he \nbegan dancing and cursing.  Altogether it was one of the most interesting \nand exciting operations I have ever witnessed.  George and I were both \nquite sorry when it was over.",
        "The result was not altogether the success that Harris had anticipated.  \nThere seemed so little to show for the business.  Six eggs had gone into \nthe frying-pan, and all that came out was a teaspoonful of burnt and \nunappetizing looking mess.",
        "Harris said it was the fault of the frying-pan, and thought it would have \ngone better if we had had a fish-kettle and a gas-stove; and we decided \nnot to attempt the dish again until we had those aids to housekeeping by \nus.",
        "The sun had got more powerful by the time we had finished breakfast, and \nthe wind had dropped, and it was as lovely a morning as one could desire.  \nLittle was in sight to remind us of the nineteenth century; and, as we \nlooked out upon the river in the morning sunlight, we could almost fancy \nthat the centuries between us and that ever-to-be-famous June morning of \n1215 had been drawn aside, and that we, English yeomen’s sons in homespun \ncloth, with dirk at belt, were waiting there to witness the writing of \nthat stupendous page of history, the meaning whereof was to be translated \nto the common people some four hundred and odd years later by one Oliver \nCromwell, who had deeply studied it.",
        "It is a fine summer morning – sunny, soft, and still.  But through the \nair there runs a thrill of coming stir.  King John has slept at Duncroft \nHall, and all the day before the little town of Staines has echoed to the \nclang of armed men, and the clatter of great horses over its rough \nstones, and the shouts of captains, and the grim oaths and surly jests of \nbearded bowmen, billmen, pikemen, and strange-speaking foreign spearmen.",
        "Gay-cloaked companies of knights and squires have ridden in, all travel-\nstained and dusty.  And all the evening long the timid townsmen’s doors \nhave had to be quick opened to let in rough groups of soldiers, for whom \nthere must be found both board and lodging, and the best of both, or woe \nbetide the house and all within; for the sword is judge and jury, \nplaintiff and executioner, in these tempestuous times, and pays for what \nit takes by sparing those from whom it takes it, if it pleases it to do \nso.",
        "Round the camp-fire in the market-place gather still more of the Barons’ \ntroops, and eat and drink deep, and bellow forth roystering drinking \nsongs, and gamble and quarrel as the evening grows and deepens into \nnight.  The firelight sheds quaint shadows on their piled-up arms and on \ntheir uncouth forms.  The children of the town steal round to watch them, \nwondering; and brawny country wenches, laughing, draw near to bandy ale-\nhouse jest and jibe with the swaggering troopers, so unlike the village \nswains, who, now despised, stand apart behind, with vacant grins upon \ntheir broad, peering faces.  And out from the fields around, glitter the \nfaint lights of more distant camps, as here some great lord’s followers \nlie mustered, and there false John’s French mercenaries hover like \ncrouching wolves without the town.",
        "And so, with sentinel in each dark street, and twinkling watch-fires on \neach height around, the night has worn away, and over this fair valley of \nold Thame has broken the morning of the great day that is to close so big \nwith the fate of ages yet unborn.",
        "Ever since grey dawn, in the lower of the two islands, just above where \nwe are standing, there has been great clamour, and the sound of many \nworkmen.  The great pavilion brought there yester eve is being raised, \nand carpenters are busy nailing tiers of seats, while `prentices from \nLondon town are there with many-coloured stuffs and silks and cloth of \ngold and silver.",
        "And now, lo! down upon the road that winds along the river’s bank from \nStaines there come towards us, laughing and talking together in deep \nguttural bass, a half-a-score of stalwart halbert-men – Barons’ men, \nthese – and halt at a hundred yards or so above us, on the other bank, \nand lean upon their arms, and wait.",
        "And so, from hour to hour, march up along the road ever fresh groups and \nbands of armed men, their casques and breastplates flashing back the long \nlow lines of morning sunlight, until, as far as eye can reach, the way \nseems thick with glittering steel and prancing steeds.  And shouting \nhorsemen are galloping from group to group, and little banners are \nfluttering lazily in the warm breeze, and every now and then there is a \ndeeper stir as the ranks make way on either side, and some great Baron on \nhis war-horse, with his guard of squires around him, passes along to take \nhis station at the head of his serfs and vassals.",
        "And up the slope of Cooper’s Hill, just opposite, are gathered the \nwondering rustics and curious townsfolk, who have run from Staines, and \nnone are quite sure what the bustle is about, but each one has a \ndifferent version of the great event that they have come to see; and some \nsay that much good to all the people will come from this day’s work; but \nthe old men shake their heads, for they have heard such tales before.",
        "And all the river down to Staines is dotted with small craft and boats \nand tiny coracles – which last are growing out of favour now, and are \nused only by the poorer folk.  Over the rapids, where in after years trim \nBell Weir lock will stand, they have been forced or dragged by their \nsturdy rowers, and now are crowding up as near as they dare come to the \ngreat covered barges, which lie in readiness to bear King John to where \nthe fateful Charter waits his signing.",
        "It is noon, and we and all the people have been waiting patient for many \nan hour, and the rumour has run round that slippery John has again \nescaped from the Barons’ grasp, and has stolen away from Duncroft Hall \nwith his mercenaries at his heels, and will soon be doing other work than \nsigning charters for his people’s liberty.",
        "Not so!  This time the grip upon him has been one of iron, and he has \nslid and wriggled in vain.  Far down the road a little cloud of dust has \nrisen, and draws nearer and grows larger, and the pattering of many hoofs \ngrows louder, and in and out between the scattered groups of drawn-up \nmen, there pushes on its way a brilliant cavalcade of gay-dressed lords \nand knights.  And front and rear, and either flank, there ride the yeomen \nof the Barons, and in the midst King John.",
        "He rides to where the barges lie in readiness, and the great Barons step \nforth from their ranks to meet him.  He greets them with a smile and \nlaugh, and pleasant honeyed words, as though it were some feast in his \nhonour to which he had been invited.  But as he rises to dismount, he \ncasts one hurried glance from his own French mercenaries drawn up in the \nrear to the grim ranks of the Barons’ men that hem him in.",
        "Is it too late?  One fierce blow at the unsuspecting horseman at his \nside, one cry to his French troops, one desperate charge upon the unready \nlines before him, and these rebellious Barons might rue the day they \ndared to thwart his plans!  A bolder hand might have turned the game even \nat that point.  Had it been a Richard there! the cup of liberty might \nhave been dashed from England’s lips, and the taste of freedom held back \nfor a hundred years.",
        "But the heart of King John sinks before the stern faces of the English \nfighting men, and the arm of King John drops back on to his rein, and he \ndismounts and takes his seat in the foremost barge.  And the Barons \nfollow in, with each mailed hand upon the sword-hilt, and the word is \ngiven to let go.",
        "Slowly the heavy, bright-decked barges leave the shore of Runningmede.  \nSlowly against the swift current they work their ponderous way, till, \nwith a low grumble, they grate against the bank of the little island that \nfrom this day will bear the name of Magna Charta Island.  And King John \nhas stepped upon the shore, and we wait in breathless silence till a \ngreat shout cleaves the air, and the great cornerstone in England’s \ntemple of liberty has, now we know, been firmly laid.",
