        "When our guards aroused us from sleep we were much refreshed.\nThey gave us food. Strips of dried meat it was, but it\nput new life and strength into us, so that now we too\nmarched with high-held heads, and took noble strides.\nAt least I did, for I was young and proud; but poor Perry\nhated walking. On earth I had often seen him call a cab\nto travel a square—he was paying for it now, and his old\nlegs wobbled so that I put my arm about him and half carried\nhim through the balance of those frightful marches.",
        "The country began to change at last, and we wound up\nout of the level plain through mighty mountains of\nvirgin granite. The tropical verdure of the lowlands was\nreplaced by hardier vegetation, but even here the effects\nof constant heat and light were apparent in the immensity\nof the trees and the profusion of foliage and blooms.\nCrystal streams roared through their rocky channels,\nfed by the perpetual snows which we could see far above us.\nAbove the snowcapped heights hung masses of heavy clouds.\nIt was these, Perry explained, which evidently served\nthe double purpose of replenishing the melting snows and\nprotecting them from the direct rays of the sun.",
        "By this time we had picked up a smattering of the bastard\nlanguage in which our guards addressed us, as well\nas making good headway in the rather charming tongue\nof our co-captives. Directly ahead of me in the chain\ngang was a young woman. Three feet of chain linked us\ntogether in a forced companionship which I, at least,\nsoon rejoiced in. For I found her a willing teacher,\nand from her I learned the language of her tribe,\nand much of the life and customs of the inner world—at\nleast that part of it with which she was familiar.",
        "She told me that she was called Dian the Beautiful,\nand that she belonged to the tribe of Amoz, which dwells\nin the cliffs above the Darel Az, or shallow sea.",
        "“How came you here?” I asked her.",
        "“I was running away from Jubal the Ugly One,” she answered,\nas though that was explanation quite sufficient.",
        "“Who is Jubal the Ugly One?” I asked. “And why did you\nrun away from him?”",
        "She looked at me in surprise.",
        "“Why DOES a woman run away from a man?” she answered\nmy question with another.",
        "“They do not, where I come from,” I replied.\n“Sometimes they run after them.”",
        "But she could not understand. Nor could I get her to grasp\nthe fact that I was of another world. She was quite as\npositive that creation was originated solely to produce her\nown kind and the world she lived in as are many of the outer world.",
        "“But Jubal,” I insisted. “Tell me about him, and why you\nran away to be chained by the neck and scourged across\nthe face of a world.”",
        "“Jubal the Ugly One placed his trophy before my father’s house.\nIt was the head of a mighty tandor. It remained there\nand no greater trophy was placed beside it. So I knew\nthat Jubal the Ugly One would come and take me as his mate.\nNone other so powerful wished me, or they would have\nslain a mightier beast and thus have won me from Jubal.\nMy father is not a mighty hunter. Once he was,\nbut a sadok tossed him, and never again had he the full\nuse of his right arm. My brother, Dacor the Strong One,\nhad gone to the land of Sari to steal a mate for himself.\nThus there was none, father, brother, or lover, to save\nme from Jubal the Ugly One, and I ran away and hid among\nthe hills that skirt the land of Amoz. And there these\nSagoths found me and made me captive.”",
        "“What will they do with you?” I asked. “Where are they\ntaking us?”",
        "Again she looked her incredulity.",
        "“I can almost believe that you are of another world,\"\nshe said, “for otherwise such ignorance were inexplicable.\nDo you really mean that you do not know that the Sagoths\nare the creatures of the Mahars—the mighty Mahars who\nthink they own Pellucidar and all that walks or grows\nupon its surface, or creeps or burrows beneath, or swims\nwithin its lakes and oceans, or flies through its air?\nNext you will be telling me that you never before heard\nof the Mahars!”",
        "I was loath to do it, and further incur her scorn;\nbut there was no alternative if I were to absorb knowledge,\nso I made a clean breast of my pitiful ignorance as to the\nmighty Mahars. She was shocked. But she did her very best\nto enlighten me, though much that she said was as Greek\nwould have been to her. She described the Mahars largely\nby comparisons. In this way they were like unto thipdars,\nin that to the hairless lidi.",
        "About all I gleaned of them was that they were\nquite hideous, had wings, and webbed feet; lived in\ncities built beneath the ground; could swim under\nwater for great distances, and were very, very wise.\nThe Sagoths were their weapons of offense and defense,\nand the races like herself were their hands and feet—they\nwere the slaves and servants who did all the manual labor.\nThe Mahars were the heads—the brains—of the inner world.\nI longed to see this wondrous race of supermen.",
        "Perry learned the language with me. When we halted,\nas we occasionally did, though sometimes the halts seemed\nages apart, he would join in the conversation, as would\nGhak the Hairy One, he who was chained just ahead of Dian\nthe Beautiful. Ahead of Ghak was Hooja the Sly One.\nHe too entered the conversation occasionally. Most of\nhis remarks were directed toward Dian the Beautiful.\nIt didn’t take half an eye to see that he had developed\na bad case; but the girl appeared totally oblivious\nto his thinly veiled advances. Did I say thinly veiled?\nThere is a race of men in New Zealand, or Australia,\nI have forgotten which, who indicate their preference\nfor the lady of their affections by banging her over\nthe head with a bludgeon. By comparison with this method\nHooja’s lovemaking might be called thinly veiled.\nAt first it caused me to blush violently although I\nhave seen several Old Years out at Rectors, and in other\nless fashionable places off Broadway, and in Vienna,\nand Hamburg.",
        "But the girl! She was magnificent. It was easy to see\nthat she considered herself as entirely above and apart from\nher present surroundings and company. She talked with me,\nand with Perry, and with the taciturn Ghak because we\nwere respectful; but she couldn’t even see Hooja the\nSly One, much less hear him, and that made him furious.\nHe tried to get one of the Sagoths to move the girl up\nahead of him in the slave gang, but the fellow only poked\nhim with his spear and told him that he had selected the\ngirl for his own property—that he would buy her from the\nMahars as soon as they reached Phutra. Phutra, it seemed,\nwas the city of our destination.",
        "After passing over the first chain of mountains we skirted\na salt sea, upon whose bosom swam countless horrid things.\nSeal-like creatures there were with long necks stretching\nten and more feet above their enormous bodies and whose\nsnake heads were split with gaping mouths bristling\nwith countless fangs. There were huge tortoises too,\npaddling about among these other reptiles, which Perry\nsaid were Plesiosaurs of the Lias. I didn’t question his\nveracity—they might have been most anything.",
        "Dian told me they were tandorazes, or tandors of the sea,\nand that the other, and more fearsome reptiles, which occasionally\nrose from the deep to do battle with them, were azdyryths,\nor sea-dyryths—Perry called them Ichthyosaurs.\nThey resembled a whale with the head of an alligator.",
        "I had forgotten what little geology I had studied\nat school—about all that remained was an impression\nof horror that the illustrations of restored prehistoric\nmonsters had made upon me, and a well-defined belief\nthat any man with a pig’s shank and a vivid imagination\ncould “restore” most any sort of paleolithic monster he\nsaw fit, and take rank as a first class paleontologist.\nBut when I saw these sleek, shiny carcasses shimmering in\nthe sunlight as they emerged from the ocean, shaking their\ngiant heads; when I saw the waters roll from their sinuous\nbodies in miniature waterfalls as they glided hither\nand thither, now upon the surface, now half submerged;\nas I saw them meet, open-mouthed, hissing and snorting,\nin their titanic and interminable warring I realized\nhow futile is man’s poor, weak imagination by comparison\nwith Nature’s incredible genius.",
        "And Perry! He was absolutely flabbergasted. He said\nso himself.",
        "“David,” he remarked, after we had marched for a long time\nbeside that awful sea. “David, I used to teach geology,\nand I thought that I believed what I taught; but now I\nsee that I did not believe it—that it is impossible\nfor man to believe such things as these unless he sees\nthem with his own eyes. We take things for granted,\nperhaps, because we are told them over and over again,\nand have no way of disproving them—like religions,\nfor example; but we don’t believe them, we only think\nwe do. If you ever get back to the outer world you\nwill find that the geologists and paleontologists will\nbe the first to set you down a liar, for they know\nthat no such creatures as they restore ever existed.\nIt is all right to IMAGINE them as existing in an equally\nimaginary epoch—but now? poof!”",
        "At the next halt Hooja the Sly One managed to find enough\nslack chain to permit him to worm himself back quite close\nto Dian. We were all standing, and as he edged near the\ngirl she turned her back upon him in such a truly earthly\nfeminine manner that I could scarce repress a smile; but it\nwas a short-lived smile for on the instant the Sly One’s\nhand fell upon the girl’s bare arm, jerking her roughly\ntoward him.",
        "I was not then familiar with the customs or social ethics\nwhich prevailed within Pellucidar; but even so I did\nnot need the appealing look which the girl shot to me\nfrom her magnificent eyes to influence my subsequent act.\nWhat the Sly One’s intention was I paused not to inquire;\nbut instead, before he could lay hold of her with his\nother hand, I placed a right to the point of his jaw that\nfelled him in his tracks.",
        "A roar of approval went up from those of the other prisoners\nand the Sagoths who had witnessed the brief drama; not, as I\nlater learned, because I had championed the girl, but for\nthe neat and, to them, astounding method by which I had bested Hooja.",
        "And the girl? At first she looked at me with wide, wondering eyes,\nand then she dropped her head, her face half averted,\nand a delicate flush suffused her cheek. For a moment\nshe stood thus in silence, and then her head went high,\nand she turned her back upon me as she had upon Hooja.\nSome of the prisoners laughed, and I saw the face of Ghak\nthe Hairy One go very black as he looked at me searchingly.\nAnd what I could see of Dian’s cheek went suddenly from red\nto white.",
        "Immediately after we resumed the march, and though I realized\nthat in some way I had offended Dian the Beautiful I could\nnot prevail upon her to talk with me that I might learn\nwherein I had erred—in fact I might quite as well have\nbeen addressing a sphinx for all the attention I got.\nAt last my own foolish pride stepped in and prevented\nmy making any further attempts, and thus a companionship\nthat without my realizing it had come to mean a great deal\nto me was cut off. Thereafter I confined my conversation\nto Perry. Hooja did not renew his advances toward the girl,\nnor did he again venture near me.",
        "Again the weary and apparently interminable marching became\na perfect nightmare of horrors to me. The more firmly\nfixed became the realization that the girl’s friendship\nhad meant so much to me, the more I came to miss it;\nand the more impregnable the barrier of silly pride.\nBut I was very young and would not ask Ghak for the\nexplanation which I was sure he could give, and that might\nhave made everything all right again.",
        "On the march, or during halts, Dian refused consistently\nto notice me—when her eyes wandered in my direction\nshe looked either over my head or directly through me.\nAt last I became desperate, and determined to swallow\nmy self-esteem, and again beg her to tell me how I\nhad offended, and how I might make reparation. I made\nup my mind that I should do this at the next halt.\nWe were approaching another range of mountains at the time,\nand when we reached them, instead of winding across\nthem through some high-flung pass we entered a mighty\nnatural tunnel—a series of labyrinthine grottoes,\ndark as Erebus.",
        "The guards had no torches or light of any description.\nIn fact we had seen no artificial light or sign of\nfire since we had entered Pellucidar. In a land of\nperpetual noon there is no need of light above ground,\nyet I marveled that they had no means of lighting\ntheir way through these dark, subterranean passages.\nSo we crept along at a snail’s pace, with much stumbling\nand falling—the guards keeping up a singsong chant ahead\nof us, interspersed with certain high notes which I found\nalways indicated rough places and turns.",
        "Halts were now more frequent, but I did not wish to speak\nto Dian until I could see from the expression of her face\nhow she was receiving my apologies. At last a faint\nglow ahead forewarned us of the end of the tunnel,\nfor which I for one was devoutly thankful. Then at a sudden\nturn we emerged into the full light of the noonday sun.",
        "But with it came a sudden realization of what meant\nto me a real catastrophe—Dian was gone, and with her\na half-dozen other prisoners. The guards saw it too,\nand the ferocity of their rage was terrible to behold.\nTheir awesome, bestial faces were contorted in the most\ndiabolical expressions, as they accused each other of\nresponsibility for the loss. Finally they fell upon us,\nbeating us with their spear shafts, and hatchets.\nThey had already killed two near the head of the line,\nand were like to have finished the balance of us when\ntheir leader finally put a stop to the brutal slaughter.\nNever in all my life had I witnessed a more horrible\nexhibition of bestial rage—I thanked God that Dian had not\nbeen one of those left to endure it.",
        "Of the twelve prisoners who had been chained ahead of me\neach alternate one had been freed commencing with Dian.\nHooja was gone. Ghak remained. What could it mean? How\nhad it been accomplished? The commander of the guards\nwas investigating. Soon he discovered that the rude\nlocks which had held the neckbands in place had been\ndeftly picked.",
        "“Hooja the Sly One,” murmured Ghak, who was now next to me\nin line. “He has taken the girl that you would not have,\"\nhe continued, glancing at me.",
        "“That I would not have!” I cried. “What do you mean?”",
        "He looked at me closely for a moment.",
        "“I have doubted your story that you are from another world,\"\nhe said at last, “but yet upon no other grounds could\nyour ignorance of the ways of Pellucidar be explained.\nDo you really mean that you do not know that you offended\nthe Beautiful One, and how?”",
        "“I do not know, Ghak,” I replied.",
        "“Then shall I tell you. When a man of Pellucidar\nintervenes between another man and the woman the other\nman would have, the woman belongs to the victor.\nDian the Beautiful belongs to you. You should have claimed\nher or released her. Had you taken her hand, it would\nhave indicated your desire to make her your mate, and had\nyou raised her hand above her head and then dropped it,\nit would have meant that you did not wish her for a mate\nand that you released her from all obligation to you.\nBy doing neither you have put upon her the greatest affront\nthat a man may put upon a woman. Now she is your slave.\nNo man will take her as mate, or may take her honorably,\nuntil he shall have overcome you in combat, and men do not\nchoose slave women as their mates—at least not the men\nof Pellucidar.”",
        "“I did not know, Ghak,” I cried. “I did not know.\nNot for all Pellucidar would I have harmed Dian the Beautiful\nby word, or look, or act of mine. I do not want her as\nmy slave. I do not want her as my—” but here I stopped.\nThe vision of that sweet and innocent face floated before\nme amidst the soft mists of imagination, and where I had\non the second believed that I clung only to the memory\nof a gentle friendship I had lost, yet now it seemed\nthat it would have been disloyalty to her to have said\nthat I did not want Dian the Beautiful as my mate.\nI had not thought of her except as a welcome friend\nin a strange, cruel world. Even now I did not think\nthat I loved her.",
        "I believe Ghak must have read the truth more in my\nexpression than in my words, for presently he laid\nhis hand upon my shoulder.",
        "“Man of another world,” he said, “I believe you.\nLips may lie, but when the heart speaks through the eyes\nit tells only the truth. Your heart has spoken to me.\nI know now that you meant no affront to Dian the Beautiful.\nShe is not of my tribe; but her mother is my sister.\nShe does not know it—her mother was stolen by Dian’s\nfather who came with many others of the tribe of Amoz\nto battle with us for our women—the most beautiful women\nof Pellucidar. Then was her father king of Amoz, and her\nmother was daughter of the king of Sari—to whose power I,\nhis son, have succeeded. Dian is the daughter of kings,\nthough her father is no longer king since the sadok tossed\nhim and Jubal the Ugly One wrested his kingship from him.\nBecause of her lineage the wrong you did her was greatly\nmagnified in the eyes of all who saw it. She will never\nforgive you.”",
        "I asked Ghak if there was not some way in which I\ncould release the girl from the bondage and ignominy\nI had unwittingly placed upon her.",
        "“If ever you find her, yes,” he answered. “Merely to\nraise her hand above her head and drop it in the presence\nof others is sufficient to release her; but how may you\never find her, you who are doomed to a life of slavery\nyourself in the buried city of Phutra?”",
        "“Is there no escape?” I asked.",
        "“Hooja the Sly One escaped and took the others with him,\"\nreplied Ghak. “But there are no more dark places on\nthe way to Phutra, and once there it is not so easy—the\nMahars are very wise. Even if one escaped from Phutra\nthere are the thipdars—they would find you, and then—\"\nthe Hairy One shuddered. “No, you will never escape\nthe Mahars.”",
        "It was a cheerful prospect. I asked Perry what he thought\nabout it; but he only shrugged his shoulders and continued\na longwinded prayer he had been at for some time.\nHe was wont to say that the only redeeming feature of our\ncaptivity was the ample time it gave him for the improvisation\nof prayers—it was becoming an obsession with him.\nThe Sagoths had begun to take notice of his habit\nof declaiming throughout entire marches. One of them\nasked him what he was saying—to whom he was talking.\nThe question gave me an idea, so I answered quickly\nbefore Perry could say anything.",
        "“Do not interrupt him,” I said. “He is a very holy\nman in the world from which we come. He is speaking\nto spirits which you cannot see—do not interrupt him\nor they will spring out of the air upon you and rend you\nlimb from limb—like that,” and I jumped toward the great\nbrute with a loud “Boo!” that sent him stumbling backward.",
        "I took a long chance, I realized, but if we could make\nany capital out of Perry’s harmless mania I wanted to make\nit while the making was prime. It worked splendidly.\nThe Sagoths treated us both with marked respect during\nthe balance of the journey, and then passed the word along\nto their masters, the Mahars.",
        "Two marches after this episode we came to the city of Phutra.\nThe entrance to it was marked by two lofty towers of granite,\nwhich guarded a flight of steps leading to the buried city.\nSagoths were on guard here as well as at a hundred or more\nother towers scattered about over a large plain.",
