        "\nSamuel Butler (1835 - 1902)\nEnglish composer, novelist, and satiric author\n",
        "It is hardly necessary to apologise for the miscellaneous character\nof the following collection of essays.  Samuel Butler was a man of\nsuch unusual versatility, and his interests were so many and so\nvarious that his literary remains were bound to cover a wide field.\nNevertheless it will be found that several of the subjects to which\nhe devoted much time and labour are not represented in these pages.\nI have not thought it necessary to reprint any of the numerous\npamphlets and articles which he wrote upon the Iliad and Odyssey,\nsince these were all merged in “The Authoress of the Odyssey,” which\ngives his matured views upon everything relating to the Homeric\npoems.  For a similar reason I have not included an essay on the\nevidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, which he printed in\n1865 for private circulation, since he subsequently made extensive\nuse of it in “The Fair Haven.”",
        "Two of the essays in this collection were originally delivered as\nlectures; the remainder were published in The Universal Review\nduring 1888, 1889, and 1890.",
        "I should perhaps explain why two other essays of his, which also\nappeared in The Universal Review, have been omitted.",
        "The first of these, entitled “L’Affaire Holbein-Rippel,\" relates to\na drawing of Holbein’s “Danse des Paysans,” in the Basle Museum,\nwhich is usually described as a copy, but which Butler believed to\nbe the work of Holbein himself.  This essay requires to be\nillustrated in so elaborate a manner that it was impossible to\ninclude it in a book of this size.",
        "The second essay, which is a sketch of the career of the sculptor\nTabachetti, was published as the first section of an article\nentitled “A Sculptor and a Shrine,” of which the second section is\nhere given under the title, “The Sanctuary of Montrigone.”  The\nsection devoted to the sculptor represents all that Butler then knew\nabout Tabachetti, but since it was written various documents have\ncome to light, principally owing to the investigations of Cavaliere\nFrancesco Negri, of Casale Monferrato, which negative some of\nButler’s most cherished conclusions.  Had Butler lived he would\neither have rewritten his essay in accordance with Cavaliere Negri’s\ndiscoveries, of which he fully recognised the value, or incorporated\nthem into the revised edition of “Ex Voto,” which he intended to\npublish.  As it stands, the essay requires so much revision that I\nhave decided to omit it altogether, and to postpone giving English\nreaders a full account of Tabachetti’s career until a second edition\nof “Ex Voto” is required.  Meanwhile I have given a brief summary of\nthe main facts of Tabachetti’s life in a note (page 154) to the\nessay on “Art in the Valley of Saas.”  Any one who wishes for\nfurther details of the sculptor and his work will find them in\nCavaliere Negri’s pamphlet, “Il Santuario di Crea” (Alessandria,\n1902).",
        "The three essays grouped together under the title of “The Deadlock\nin Darwinism” may be regarded as a postscript to Butler’s four books\non evolution, viz., “Life and Habit,” “Evolution, Old and New,\"\n\"Unconscious Memory” and “Luck or Cunning.”  An occasion for the\npublication of these essays seemed to be afforded by the appearance\nin 1889 of Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace’s “Darwinism\"; and although\nnearly fourteen years have elapsed since they were published in the\nUniversal Review, I have no fear that they will be found to be out\nof date.  How far, indeed, the problem embodied in the deadlock of\nwhich Butler speaks is from solution was conclusively shown by the\ncorrespondence which appeared in the Times in May 1903, occasioned\nby some remarks made at University College by Lord Kelvin in moving\na vote of thanks to Professor Henslow after his lecture on “Present\nDay Rationalism.”  Lord Kelvin’s claim for a recognition of the fact\nthat in organic nature scientific thought is compelled to accept the\nidea of some kind of directive power, and his statement that\nbiologists are coming once more to a firm acceptance of a vital\nprinciple, drew from several distinguished men of science retorts\nheated enough to prove beyond a doubt that the gulf between the two\nmain divisions of evolutionists is as wide to-day as it was when\nButler wrote.  It will be well, perhaps, for the benefit of readers\nwho have not followed the history of the theory of evolution during\nits later developments, to state in a few words what these two main\ndivisions are.  All evolutionists agree that the differences between\nspecies are caused by the accumulation and transmission of\nvariations, but they do not agree as to the causes to which the\nvariations are due.  The view held by the older evolutionists,\nBuffon, Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck, who have been followed by many\nmodern thinkers, including Herbert Spencer and Butler, is that the\nvariations occur mainly as the result of effort and design; the\nopposite view, which is that advocated by Mr. Wallace in\n\"Darwinism,” is that the variations occur merely as the result of\nchance.  The former is sometimes called the theological view,\nbecause it recognises the presence in organic nature of design,\nwhether it be called creative power, directive force, directivity,\nor vital principle; the latter view, in which the existence of\ndesign is absolutely negatived, is now usually described as\nWeismannism, from the name of the writer who has been its principal\nadvocate in recent years.",
        "In conclusion, I must thank my friend Mr. Henry Festing Jones most\nwarmly for the invaluable assistance which he has given me in\npreparing these essays for publication, in correcting the proofs,\nand in compiling the introduction and notes.",
        "R. A. STREATFEILD.",
        "Like Mr. Wilkie Collins, I, too, have been asked to lay some of my\nliterary experiences before the readers of the Universal Review.  It\noccurred to me that the Review must be indeed universal before it\ncould open its pages to one so obscure as myself; but, nothing\ndaunted by the distinguished company among which I was for the first\ntime asked to move, I resolved to do as I was told, and went to the\nBritish Museum to see what books I had written.  Having refreshed my\nmemory by a glance at the catalogue, I was about to try and diminish\nthe large and ever-increasing circle of my non-readers when I became\naware of a calamity that brought me to a standstill, and indeed bids\nfair, so far as I can see at present, to put an end to my literary\nexistence altogether.",
        "I should explain that I cannot write unless I have a sloping desk,\nand the reading-room of the British Museum, where alone I can\ncompose freely, is unprovided with sloping desks.  Like every other\norganism, if I cannot get exactly what I want I make shift with the\nnext thing to it; true, there are no desks in the reading-room, but,\nas I once heard a visitor from the country say, “it contains a large\nnumber of very interesting works.”  I know it was not right, and\nhope the Museum authorities will not be severe upon me if any of\nthem reads this confession; but I wanted a desk, and set myself to\nconsider which of the many very interesting works which a grateful\nnation places at the disposal of its would-be authors was best\nsuited for my purpose.",
        "For mere reading I suppose one book is pretty much as good as\nanother; but the choice of a desk-book is a more serious matter.  It\nmust be neither too thick nor too thin; it must be large enough to\nmake a substantial support; it must be strongly bound so as not to\nyield or give; it must not be too troublesome to carry backwards and\nforwards; and it must live on shelf C, D, or E, so that there need\nbe no stooping or reaching too high.  These are the conditions which\na really good book must fulfil; simple, however, as they are, it is\nsurprising how few volumes comply with them satisfactorily;\nmoreover, being perhaps too sensitively conscientious, I allowed\nanother consideration to influence me, and was sincerely anxious not\nto take a book which would be in constant use for reference by\nreaders, more especially as, if I did this, I might find myself\ndisturbed by the officials.",
        "For weeks I made experiments upon sundry poetical and philosophical\nworks, whose names I have forgotten, but could not succeed in\nfinding my ideal desk, until at length, more by luck than cunning, I\nhappened to light upon Frost’s “Lives of Eminent Christians,” which\nI had no sooner tried than I discovered it to be the very perfection\nand ne plus ultra of everything that a book should be.  It lived in\nCase No. 2008, and I accordingly took at once to sitting in Row B,\nwhere for the last dozen years or so I have sat ever since.",
        "The first thing I have done whenever I went to the Museum has been\nto take down Frost’s “Lives of Eminent Christians” and carry it to\nmy seat.  It is not the custom of modern writers to refer to the\nworks to which they are most deeply indebted, and I have never, that\nI remember, mentioned it by name before; but it is to this book\nalone that I have looked for support during many years of literary\nlabour, and it is round this to me invaluable volume that all my own\nhave page by page grown up.  There is none in the Museum to which I\nhave been under anything like such constant obligation, none which I\ncan so ill spare, and none which I would choose so readily if I were\nallowed to select one single volume and keep it for my own.",
        "On finding myself asked for a contribution to the Universal Review,\nI went, as I have explained, to the Museum, and presently repaired\nto bookcase No. 2008 to get my favourite volume.  Alas! it was in\nthe room no longer.  It was not in use, for its place was filled up\nalready; besides, no one ever used it but myself.  Whether the ghost\nof the late Mr. Frost has been so eminently unchristian as to\ninterfere, or whether the authorities have removed the book in\nignorance of the steady demand which there has been for it on the\npart of at least one reader, are points I cannot determine.  All I\nknow is that the book is gone, and I feel as Wordsworth is generally\nsupposed to have felt when he became aware that Lucy was in her\ngrave, and exclaimed so emphatically that this would make a\nconsiderable difference to him, or words to that effect.",
        "Now I think of it, Frost’s “Lives of Eminent Christians” was very\nlike Lucy.  The one resided at Dovedale in Derbyshire, the other in\nGreat Russell Street, Bloomsbury.  I admit that I do not see the\nresemblance here at this moment, but if I try to develop my\nperception I shall doubtless ere long find a marvellously striking\none.  In other respects, however, than mere local habitat the\nlikeness is obvious.  Lucy was not particularly attractive either\ninside or out—no more was Frost’s “Lives of Eminent Christians\";\nthere were few to praise her, and of those few still fewer could\nbring themselves to like her; indeed, Wordsworth himself seems to\nhave been the only person who thought much about her one way or the\nother.  In like manner, I believe I was the only reader who thought\nmuch one way or the other about Frost’s “Lives of Eminent\nChristians,” but this in itself was one of the attractions of the\nbook; and as for the grief we respectively felt and feel, I believe\nmy own to be as deep as Wordsworth’s, if not more so.",
        "I said above, “as Wordsworth is generally supposed to have felt\";\nfor any one imbued with the spirit of modern science will read\nWordsworth’s poem with different eyes from those of a mere literary\ncritic.  He will note that Wordsworth is most careful not to explain\nthe nature of the difference which the death of Lucy will occasion\nto him.  He tells us that there will be a difference; but there the\nmatter ends.  The superficial reader takes it that he was very sorry\nshe was dead; it is, of course, possible that he may have actually\nbeen so, but he has not said this.  On the contrary, he has hinted\nplainly that she was ugly, and generally disliked; she was only like\na violet when she was half-hidden from the view, and only fair as a\nstar when there were so few stars out that it was practically\nimpossible to make an invidious comparison.  If there were as many\nas even two stars the likeness was felt to be at an end.  If\nWordsworth had imprudently promised to marry this young person\nduring a time when he had been unusually long in keeping to good\nresolutions, and had afterwards seen some one whom he liked better,\nthen Lucy’s death would undoubtedly have made a considerable\ndifference to him, and this is all that he has ever said that it\nwould do.  What right have we to put glosses upon the masterly\nreticence of a poet, and credit him with feelings possibly the very\nreverse of those he actually entertained?",
        "Sometimes, indeed, I have been inclined to think that a mystery is\nbeing hinted at more dark than any critic has suspected.  I do not\nhappen to possess a copy of the poem, but the writer, if I am not\nmistaken, says that “few could know when Lucy ceased to be.\"\n\"Ceased to be” is a suspiciously euphemistic expression, and the\nwords “few could know” are not applicable to the ordinary peaceful\ndeath of a domestic servant such as Lucy appears to have been.  No\nmatter how obscure the deceased, any number of people commonly can\nknow the day and hour of his or her demise, whereas in this case we\nare expressly told it would be impossible for them to do so.\nWordsworth was nothing if not accurate, and would not have said that\nfew could know, but that few actually did know, unless he was aware\nof circumstances that precluded all but those implicated in the\ncrime of her death from knowing the precise moment of its\noccurrence.  If Lucy was the kind of person not obscurely pourtrayed\nin the poem; if Wordsworth had murdered her, either by cutting her\nthroat or smothering her, in concert, perhaps, with his friends\nSouthey and Coleridge; and if he had thus found himself released\nfrom an engagement which had become irksome to him, or possibly from\nthe threat of an action for breach of promise, then there is not a\nsyllable in the poem with which he crowns his crime that is not\nalive with meaning.  On any other supposition to the general reader\nit is unintelligible.",
        "We cannot be too guarded in the interpretations we put upon the\nwords of great poets.  Take the young lady who never loved the dear\ngazelle—and I don’t believe she did; we are apt to think that Moore\nintended us to see in this creation of his fancy a sweet, amiable,\nbut most unfortunate young woman, whereas all he has told us about\nher points to an exactly opposite conclusion.  In reality, he wished\nus to see a young lady who had been an habitual complainer from her\nearliest childhood; whose plants had always died as soon as she\nbought them, while those belonging to her neighbours had flourished.\nThe inference is obvious, nor can we reasonably doubt that Moore\nintended us to draw it; if her plants were the very first to fade\naway, she was evidently the very first to neglect or otherwise\nmaltreat them.  She did not give them enough water, or left the door\nof her fern-ease open when she was cooking her dinner at the gas\nstove, or kept them too near the paraffin oil, or other like folly;\nand as for her temper, see what the gazelles did; as long as they\ndid not know her “well,” they could just manage to exist, but when\nthey got to understand her real character, one after another felt\nthat death was the only course open to it, and accordingly died\nrather than live with such a mistress.  True, the young lady herself\nsaid the gazelles loved her; but disagreeable people are apt to\nthink themselves amiable, and in view of the course invariably taken\nby the gazelles themselves any one accustomed to weigh evidence will\nhold that she was probably mistaken.",
        "I must, however, return to Frost’s “Lives of Eminent Christians.”  I\nwill leave none of the ambiguity about my words in which Moore and\nWordsworth seem to have delighted.  I am very sorry the book is\ngone, and know not where to turn for its successor.  Till I have\nfound a substitute I can write no more, and I do not know how to\nfind even a tolerable one.  I should try a volume of Migne’s\n\"Complete Course of Patrology,” but I do not like books in more than\none volume, for the volumes vary in thickness, and one never can\nremember which one took; the four volumes, however, of Bede in\nGiles’s “Anglican Fathers” are not open to this objection, and I\nhave reserved them for favourable consideration.  Mather’s\n\"Magnalia” might do, but the binding does not please me; Cureton’s\n\"Corpus Ignatianum” might also do if it were not too thin.  I do not\nlike taking Norton’s “Genuineness of the Gospels,” as it is just\npossible some one may be wanting to know whether the Gospels are\ngenuine or not, and be unable to find out because I have got Mr.\nNorton’s book.  Baxter’s “Church History of England,” Lingard’s\n\"Anglo-Saxon Church,” and Cardwell’s “Documentary Annals,” though\nnone of them as good as Frost, are works of considerable merit; but\non the whole I think Arvine’s “Cyclopedia of Moral and Religious\nAnecdote” is perhaps the one book in the room which comes within\nmeasurable distance of Frost.  I should probably try this book\nfirst, but it has a fatal objection in its too seductive title.  “I\nam not curious,” as Miss Lottie Venne says in one of her parts, “but\nI like to know,” and I might be tempted to pervert the book from its\nnatural uses and open it, so as to find out what kind of a thing a\nmoral and religious anecdote is.  I know, of course, that there are\na great many anecdotes in the Bible, but no one thinks of calling\nthem either moral or religious, though some of them certainly seem\nas if they might fairly find a place in Mr. Arvine’s work.  There\nare some things, however, which it is better not to know, and take\nit all round I do not think I should be wise in putting myself in\nthe way of temptation, and adopting Arvine as the successor to my\nbeloved and lamented Frost.",
        "Some successor I must find, or I must give up writing altogether,\nand this I should be sorry to do.  I have only as yet written about\na third, or from that—counting works written but not published—to\na half, of the books which I have set myself to write.  It would not\nso much matter if old age was not staring me in the face.  Dr. Parr\nsaid it was “a beastly shame for an old man not to have laid down a\ngood cellar of port in his youth\"; I, like the greater number, I\nsuppose, of those who write books at all, write in order that I may\nhave something to read in my old age when I can write no longer.  I\nknow what I shall like better than any one can tell me, and write\naccordingly; if my career is nipped in the bud, as seems only too\nlikely, I really do not know where else I can turn for present\nagreeable occupation, nor yet how to make suitable provision for my\nlater years.  Other writers can, of course, make excellent provision\nfor their own old ages, but they cannot do so for mine, any more\nthan I should succeed if I were to try to cater for theirs.  It is\none of those cases in which no man can make agreement for his\nbrother.",
        "I have no heart for continuing this article, and if I had, I have\nnothing of interest to say.  No one’s literary career can have been\nsmoother or more unchequered than mine.  I have published all my\nbooks at my own expense, and paid for them in due course.  What can\nbe conceivably more unromantic?  For some years I had a little\nliterary grievance against the authorities of the British Museum\nbecause they would insist on saying in their catalogue that I had\npublished three sermons on Infidelity in the year 1820.  I thought I\nhad not, and got them out to see.  They were rather funny, but they\nwere not mine.  Now, however, this grievance has been removed.  I\nhad another little quarrel with them because they would describe me\nas “of St. John’s College, Cambridge,” an establishment for which I\nhave the most profound veneration, but with which I have not had the\nhonour to be connected for some quarter of a century.  At last they\nsaid they would change this description if I would only tell them\nwhat I was, for, though they had done their best to find out, they\nhad themselves failed.  I replied with modest pride that I was a\nBachelor of Arts.  I keep all my other letters inside my name, not\noutside.  They mused and said it was unfortunate that I was not a\nMaster of Arts.  Could I not get myself made a Master?  I said I\nunderstood that a Mastership was an article the University could not\ndo under about five pounds, and that I was not disposed to go\nsixpence higher than three ten.  They again said it was a pity, for\nit would be very inconvenient to them if I did not keep to something\nbetween a bishop and a poet.  I might be anything I liked in reason,\nprovided I showed proper respect for the alphabet; but they had got\nme between “Samuel Butler, bishop,” and “Samuel Butler, poet.”  It\nwould be very troublesome to shift me, and bachelor came before\nbishop.  This was reasonable, so I replied that, under those\ncircumstances, if they pleased, I thought I would like to be a\nphilosophical writer.  They embraced the solution, and, no matter\nwhat I write now, I must remain a philosophical writer as long as I\nlive, for the alphabet will hardly be altered in my time, and I must\nbe something between “Bis” and “Poe.”  If I could get a volume of my\nexcellent namesake’s “Hudibras” out of the list of my works, I\nshould be robbed of my last shred of literary grievance, so I say\nnothing about this, but keep it secret, lest some worse thing should\nhappen to me.  Besides, I have a great respect for my namesake, and\nalways say that if “Erewhon” had been a racehorse it would have been\ngot by “Hudibras” out of “Analogy.”  Some one said this to me many\nyears ago, and I felt so much flattered that I have been repeating\nthe remark as my own ever since.",
        "But how small are these grievances as compared with those endured\nwithout a murmur by hundreds of writers far more deserving than\nmyself.  When I see the scores and hundreds of workers in the\nreading-room who have done so much more than I have, but whose work\nis absolutely fruitless to themselves, and when I think of the\nprompt recognition obtained by my own work, I ask myself what I have\ndone to be thus rewarded.  On the other hand, the feeling that I\nhave succeeded far beyond my deserts hitherto, makes it all the\nharder for me to acquiesce without complaint in the extinction of a\ncareer which I honestly believe to be a promising one; and once more\nI repeat that, unless the Museum authorities give me back my Frost,\nor put a locked clasp on Arvine, my career must be extinguished.\nGive me back Frost, and, if life and health are spared, I will write\nanother dozen of volumes yet before I hang up my fiddle—if so\nserious a confusion of metaphors may be pardoned.  I know from long\nexperience how kind and considerate both the late and present\nsuperintendents of the reading-room were and are, but I doubt how\nfar either of them would be disposed to help me on this occasion;\ncontinue, however, to rob me of my Frost, and, whatever else I may\ndo, I will write no more books.",
        "Note by Dr. Garnett, British Museum.—The frost has broken up.  Mr.\nButler is restored to literature.  Mr. Mudie may make himself easy.\nEngland will still boast a humourist; and the late Mr. Darwin (to\nwhose posthumous machinations the removal of the book was owing)\nwill continue to be confounded.—R. GANNETT.",
        "Walking the other day in Cheapside I saw some turtles in Mr.\nSweeting’s window, and was tempted to stay and look at them.  As I\ndid so I was struck not more by the defences with which they were\nhedged about, than by the fatuousness of trying to hedge that in at\nall which, if hedged thoroughly, must die of its own defencefulness.\nThe holes for the head and feet through which the turtle leaks out,\nas it were, on to the exterior world, and through which it again\nabsorbs the exterior world into itself—\"catching on” through them\nto things that are thus both turtle and not turtle at one and the\nsame time—these holes stultify the armour, and show it to have been\ndesigned by a creature with more of faithfulness to a fixed idea,\nand hence one-sidedness, than of that quick sense of relative\nimportances and their changes, which is the main factor of good\nliving.",
        "The turtle obviously had no sense of proportion; it differed so\nwidely from myself that I could not comprehend it; and as this word\noccurred to me, it occurred also that until my body comprehended its\nbody in a physical material sense, neither would my mind be able to\ncomprehend its mind with any thoroughness.  For unity of mind can\nonly be consummated by unity of body; everything, therefore, must be\nin some respects both knave and fool to all that which has not eaten\nit, or by which it has not been eaten.  As long as the turtle was in\nthe window and I in the street outside, there was no chance of our\ncomprehending one another.",
        "Nevertheless I knew that I could get it to agree with me if I could\nso effectually button-hole and fasten on to it as to eat it.  Most\nmen have an easy method with turtle soup, and I had no misgiving but\nthat if I could bring my first premise to bear I should prove the\nbetter reasoner.  My difficulty lay in this initial process, for I\nhad not with me the argument that would alone compel Mr. Sweeting\nthink that I ought to be allowed to convert the turtles—I mean I\nhad no money in my pocket.  No missionary enterprise can be carried\non without any money at all, but even so small a sum as half-a-crown\nwould, I suppose, have enabled me to bring the turtle partly round,\nand with many half-crowns I could in time no doubt convert the lot,\nfor the turtle needs must go where the money drives.  If, as is\nalleged, the world stands on a turtle, the turtle stands on money.\nNo money no turtle.  As for money, that stands on opinion, credit,\ntrust, faith—things that, though highly material in connection with\nmoney, are still of immaterial essence.",
        "The steps are perfectly plain.  The men who caught the turtles\nbrought a fairly strong and definite opinion to bear upon them, that\npassed into action, and later on into money.  They thought the\nturtles would come that way, and verified their opinion; on this,\nwill and action were generated, with the result that the men turned\nthe turtles on their backs and carried them off.  Mr. Sweeting\ntouched these men with money, which is the outward and visible sign\nof verified opinion.  The customer touches Mr. Sweeting with money,\nMr. Sweeting touches the waiter and the cook with money.  They touch\nthe turtle with skill and verified opinion.  Finally, the customer\napplies the clinching argument that brushes all sophisms aside, and\nbids the turtle stand protoplasm to protoplasm with himself, to know\neven as it is known.",
        "But it must be all touch, touch, touch; skill, opinion, power, and\nmoney, passing in and out with one another in any order we like, but\nstill link to link and touch to touch.  If there is failure anywhere\nin respect of opinion, skill, power, or money, either as regards\nquantity or quality, the chain can be no stronger than its weakest\nlink, and the turtle and the clinching argument will fly asunder.\nOf course, if there is an initial failure in connection, through\ndefect in any member of the chain, or of connection between the\nlinks, it will no more be attempted to bring the turtle and the\nclinching argument together, than it will to chain up a dog with two\npieces of broken chain that are disconnected.  The contact\nthroughout must be conceived as absolute; and yet perfect contact is\ninconceivable by us, for on becoming perfect it ceases to be\ncontact, and becomes essential, once for all inseverable, identity.\nThe most absolute contact short of this is still contact by courtesy\nonly.  So here, as everywhere else, Eurydice glides off as we are\nabout to grasp her.  We can see nothing face to face; our utmost\nseeing is but a fumbling of blind finger-ends in an overcrowded\npocket.",
        "Presently my own blind finger-ends fished up the conclusion, that as\nI had neither time nor money to spend on perfecting the chain that\nwould put me in full spiritual contact with Mr. Sweeting’s turtles,\nI had better leave them to complete their education at some one\nelse’s expense rather than mine, so I walked on towards the Bank.\nAs I did so it struck me how continually we are met by this melting\nof one existence into another.  The limits of the body seem well\ndefined enough as definitions go, but definitions seldom go far.\nWhat, for example, can seem more distinct from a man than his banker\nor his solicitor?  Yet these are commonly so much parts of him that\nhe can no more cut them off and grow new ones, than he can grow new\nlegs or arms; neither must he wound his solicitor; a wound in the\nsolicitor is a very serious thing.  As for his bank—failure of his\nbank’s action may be as fatal to a man as failure of his heart.  I\nhave said nothing about the medical or spiritual adviser, but most\nmen grow into the society that surrounds them by the help of these\nfour main tap-roots, and not only into the world of humanity, but\ninto the universe at large.  We can, indeed, grow butchers, bakers,\nand greengrocers, almost ad libitum, but these are low developments,\nand correspond to skin, hair, or finger-nails.  Those of us again\nwho are not highly enough organised to have grown a solicitor or\nbanker can generally repair the loss of whatever social organisation\nthey may possess as freely as lizards are said to grow new tails;\nbut this with the higher social, as well as organic, developments is\nonly possible to a very limited extent.",
        "The doctrine of metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls—a\ndoctrine to which the foregoing considerations are for the most part\neasy corollaries—crops up no matter in what direction we allow our\nthoughts to wander.  And we meet instances of transmigration of body\nas well as of soul.  I do not mean that both body and soul have\ntransmigrated together, far from it; but that, as we can often\nrecognise a transmigrated mind in an alien body, so we not less\noften see a body that is clearly only a transmigration, linked on to\nsome one else’s new and alien soul.  We meet people every day whose\nbodies are evidently those of men and women long dead, but whose\nappearance we know through their portraits.  We see them going about\nin omnibuses, railway carriages, and in all public places.  The\ncards have been shuffled, and they have drawn fresh lots in life and\nnationalities, but any one fairly well up in mediaeval and last\ncentury portraiture knows them at a glance.",
        "Going down once towards Italy I saw a young man in the train whom I\nrecognised, only he seemed to have got younger.  He was with a\nfriend, and his face was in continual play, but for some little time\nI puzzled in vain to recollect where it was that I had seen him\nbefore.  All of a sudden I remembered he was King Francis I. of\nFrance.  I had hitherto thought the face of this king impossible,\nbut when I saw it in play I understood it.  His great contemporary\nHenry VIII. keeps a restaurant in Oxford Street.  Falstaff drove one\nof the St. Gothard diligences for many years, and only retired when\nthe railway was opened.  Titian once made me a pair of boots at\nVicenza, and not very good ones.  At Modena I had my hair cut by a\nyoung man whom I perceived to be Raffaelle.  The model who sat to\nhim for his celebrated Madonnas is first lady in a confectionery\nestablishment at Montreal.  She has a little motherly pimple on the\nleft side of her nose that is misleading at first, but on\nexamination she is readily recognised; probably Raffaelle’s model\nhad the pimple too, but Raffaelle left it out—as he would.",
        "Handel, of course, is Madame Patey.  Give Madame Patey Handel’s wig\nand clothes, and there would be no telling her from Handel.  It is\nnot only that the features and the shape of the head are the same,\nbut there is a certain imperiousness of expression and attitude\nabout Handel which he hardly attempts to conceal in Madame Patey.\nIt is a curious coincidence that he should continue to be such an\nincomparable renderer of his own music.  Pope Julius II. was the\nlate Mr. Darwin.  Rameses II. is a blind woman now, and stands in\nHolborn, holding a tin mug.  I never could understand why I always\nfound myself humming “They oppressed them with burthens” when I\npassed her, till one day I was looking in Mr. Spooner’s window in\nthe Strand, and saw a photograph of Rameses II.  Mary Queen of Scots\nwears surgical boots and is subject to fits, near the Horse Shoe in\nTottenham Court Road.",
        "Michael Angelo is a commissionaire; I saw him on board the Glen\nRosa, which used to run every day from London to Clacton-on-Sea and\nback.  It gave me quite a turn when I saw him coming down the stairs\nfrom the upper deck, with his bronzed face, flattened nose, and with\nthe familiar bar upon his forehead.  I never liked Michael Angelo,\nand never shall, but I am afraid of him, and was near trying to hide\nwhen I saw him coming towards me.  He had not got his\ncommissionaire’s uniform on, and I did not know he was one till I\nmet him a month or so later in the Strand.  When we got to Blackwall\nthe music struck up and people began to dance.  I never saw a man\ndance so much in my life.  He did not miss a dance all the way to\nClacton, nor all the way back again, and when not dancing he was\nflirting and cracking jokes.  I could hardly believe my eyes when I\nreflected that this man had painted the famous “Last Judgment,” and\nhad made all those statues.",
        "Dante is, or was a year or two ago, a waiter at Brissago on the Lago\nMaggiore, only he is better-tempered-looking, and has a more\nintellectual expression.  He gave me his ideas upon beauty:  “Tutto\nch’ e vero e bello,” he exclaimed, with all his old self-confidence.\nI am not afraid of Dante.  I know people by their friends, and he\nwent about with Virgil, so I said with some severity, “No, Dante, il\nnaso della Signora Robinson e vero, ma non e bello\"; and he admitted\nI was right.  Beatrice’s name is Towler; she is waitress at a small\ninn in German Switzerland.  I used to sit at my window and hear\npeople call “Towler, Towler, Towler,” fifty times in a forenoon.\nShe was the exact antithesis to Abra; Abra, if I remember, used to\ncome before they called her name, but no matter how often they\ncalled Towler, every one came before she did.  I suppose they spelt\nher name Taula, but to me it sounded Towler; I never, however, met\nany one else with this name.  She was a sweet, artless little hussy,\nwho made me play the piano to her, and she said it was lovely.  Of\ncourse I only played my own compositions; so I believed her, and it\nall went off very nicely.  I thought it might save trouble if I did\nnot tell her who she really was, so I said nothing about it.",
        "I met Socrates once.  He was my muleteer on an excursion which I\nwill not name, for fear it should identify the man.  The moment I\nsaw my guide I knew he was somebody, but for the life of me I could\nnot remember who.  All of a sudden it flashed across me that he was\nSocrates.  He talked enough for six, but it was all in dialetto, so\nI could not understand him, nor, when I had discovered who he was,\ndid I much try to do so.  He was a good creature, a trifle given to\nstealing fruit and vegetables, but an amiable man enough.  He had\nhad a long day with his mule and me, and he only asked me five\nfrancs.  I gave him ten, for I pitied his poor old patched boots,\nand there was a meekness about him that touched me.  “And now,\nSocrates,” said I at parting, “we go on our several ways, you to\nsteal tomatoes, I to filch ideas from other people; for the rest—\nwhich of these two roads will be the better going, our father which\nis in heaven knows, but we know not.”",
        "I have never seen Mendelssohn, but there is a fresco of him on the\nterrace, or open-air dining-room, of an inn at Chiavenna.  He is not\ncalled Mendelssohn, but I knew him by his legs.  He is in the\ncostume of a dandy of some five-and-forty years ago, is smoking a\ncigar, and appears to be making an offer of marriage to his cook.\nBeethoven both my friend Mr. H. Festing Jones and I have had the\ngood fortune to meet; he is an engineer now, and does not know one\nnote from another; he has quite lost his deafness, is married, and\nis, of course, a little squat man with the same refractory hair that\nhe always had.  It was very interesting to watch him, and Jones\nremarked that before the end of dinner he had become positively\nposthumous.  One morning I was told the Beethovens were going away,\nand before long I met their two heavy boxes being carried down the\nstairs.  The boxes were so squab and like their owners, that I half\nthought for a moment that they were inside, and should hardly have\nbeen surprised to see them spring up like a couple of Jacks-in-the-\nbox.  “Sono indentro?” said I, with a frown of wonder, pointing to\nthe boxes.  The porters knew what I meant, and laughed.  But there\nis no end to the list of people whom I have been able to recognise,\nand before I had got through it myself, I found I had walked some\ndistance, and had involuntarily paused in front of a second-hand\nbookstall.",
        "I do not like books.  I believe I have the smallest library of any\nliterary man in London, and I have no wish to increase it.  I keep\nmy books at the British Museum and at Mudie’s, and it makes me very\nangry if any one gives me one for my private library.  I once heard\ntwo ladies disputing in a railway carriage as to whether one of them\nhad or had not been wasting money.  “I spent it in books,” said the\naccused, “and it’s not wasting money to buy books.”  “Indeed, my\ndear, I think it is,” was the rejoinder, and in practice I agree\nwith it.  Webster’s Dictionary, Whitaker’s Almanack, and Bradshaw’s\nRailway Guide should be sufficient for any ordinary library; it will\nbe time enough to go beyond these when the mass of useful and\nentertaining matter which they provide has been mastered.\nNevertheless, I admit that sometimes, if not particularly busy, I\nstop at a second-hand bookstall and turn over a book or two from\nmere force of habit.",
        "I know not what made me pick up a copy of AEschylus—of course in an\nEnglish version—or rather I know not what made AEschylus take up\nwith me, for he took me rather than I him; but no sooner had he got\nme than he began puzzling me, as he has done any time this forty\nyears, to know wherein his transcendent merit can be supposed to\nlie.  To me he is, like the greater number of classics in all ages\nand countries, a literary Struldbrug, rather than a true ambrosia-\nfed immortal.  There are true immortals, but they are few and far\nbetween; most classics are as great impostors dead as they were when\nliving, and while posing as gods are, five-sevenths of them, only\nStruldbrugs.  It comforts me to remember that Aristophanes liked\nAEschylus no better than I do.  True, he praises him by comparison\nwith Sophocles and Euripides, but he only does so that he may run\ndown these last more effectively.  Aristophanes is a safe man to\nfollow, nor do I see why it should not be as correct to laugh with\nhim as to pull a long face with the Greek Professors; but this is\nneither here nor there, for no one really cares about AEschylus; the\nmore interesting question is how he contrived to make so many people\nfor so many years pretend to care about him.",
        "Perhaps he married somebody’s daughter.  If a man would get hold of\nthe public ear, he must pay, marry, or fight.  I have never\nunderstood that AEschylus was a man of means, and the fighters do\nnot write poetry, so I suppose he must have married a theatrical\nmanager’s daughter, and got his plays brought out that way.  The ear\nof any age or country is like its land, air, and water; it seems\nlimitless but is really limited, and is already in the keeping of\nthose who naturally enough will have no squatting on such valuable\nproperty.  It is written and talked up to as closely as the means of\nsubsistence are bred up to by a teeming population.  There is not a\nsquare inch of it but is in private hands, and he who would freehold\nany part of it must do so by purchase, marriage, or fighting, in the\nusual way—and fighting gives the longest, safest tenure.  The\npublic itself has hardly more voice in the question who shall have\nits ear, than the land has in choosing its owners.  It is farmed as\nthose who own it think most profitable to themselves, and small\nblame to them; nevertheless, it has a residuum of mulishness which\nthe land has not, and does sometimes dispossess its tenants.  It is\nin this residuum that those who fight place their hope and trust.",
        "Or perhaps AEschylus squared the leading critics of his time.  When\none comes to think of it, he must have done so, for how is it\nconceivable that such plays should have had such runs if he had not?\nI met a lady one year in Switzerland who had some parrots that\nalways travelled with her and were the idols of her life.  These\nparrots would not let any one read aloud in their presence, unless\nthey heard their own names introduced from time to time.  If these\nwere freely interpolated into the text they would remain as still as\nstones, for they thought the reading was about themselves.  If it\nwas not about them it could not be allowed.  The leaders of\nliterature are like these parrots; they do not look at what a man\nwrites, nor if they did would they understand it much better than\nthe parrots do; but they like the sound of their own names, and if\nthese are freely interpolated in a tone they take as friendly, they\nmay even give ear to an outsider.  Otherwise they will scream him\noff if they can.",
        "I should not advise any one with ordinary independence of mind to\nattempt the public ear unless he is confident that he can out-lung\nand out-last his own generation; for if he has any force, people\nwill and ought to be on their guard against him, inasmuch as there\nis no knowing where he may not take them.  Besides, they have staked\ntheir money on the wrong men so often without suspecting it, that\nwhen there comes one whom they do suspect it would be madness not to\nbet against him.  True, he may die before he has out-screamed his\nopponents, but that has nothing to do with it.  If his scream was\nwell pitched it will sound clearer when he is dead.  We do not know\nwhat death is.  If we know so little about life which we have\nexperienced, how shall we know about death which we have not—and in\nthe nature of things never can?  Every one, as I said years ago in\n\"Alps and Sanctuaries,” is an immortal to himself, for he cannot\nknow that he is dead until he is dead, and when dead how can he know\nanything about anything?  All we know is, that even the humblest\ndead may live long after all trace of the body has disappeared; we\nsee them doing it in the bodies and memories of those that come\nafter them; and not a few live so much longer and more effectually\nthan is desirable, that it has been necessary to get rid of them by\nAct of Parliament.  It is love that alone gives life, and the truest\nlife is that which we live not in ourselves but vicariously in\nothers, and with which we have no concern.  Our concern is so to\norder ourselves that we may be of the number of them that enter into\nlife—although we know it not.",
        "AEschylus did so order himself; but his life is not of that\ninspiriting kind that can be won through fighting the good fight\nonly—or being believed to have fought it.  His voice is the echo of\na drone, drone-begotten and drone-sustained.  It is not a tone that\na man must utter or die—nay, even though he die; and likely enough\nhalf the allusions and hard passages in AEschylus of which we can\nmake neither head nor tail are in reality only puffs of some of the\nliterary leaders of his time.",
        "The lady above referred to told me more about her parrots.  She was\nlike a Nasmyth’s hammer going slow—very gentle, but irresistible.\nShe always read the newspaper to them.  What was the use of having a\nnewspaper if one did not read it to one’s parrots?",
        "“And have you divined,” I asked, “to which side they incline in\npolitics?”",
        "“They do not like Mr. Gladstone,” was the somewhat freezing answer;\n\"this is the only point on which we disagree, for I adore him.\nDon’t ask more about this, it is a great grief to me.  I tell them\neverything,” she continued, “and hide no secret from them.”",
        "“But can any parrot be trusted to keep a secret?”",
        "“Mine can.”",
        "“And on Sundays do you give them the same course of reading as on a\nweek-day, or do you make a difference?”",
        "“On Sundays I always read them a genealogical chapter from the Old\nor New Testament, for I can thus introduce their names without\nprofanity.  I always keep tea by me in case they should ask for it\nin the night, and I have an Etna to warm it for them; they take milk\nand sugar.  The old white-headed clergyman came to see them last\nnight; it was very painful, for Jocko reminded him so strongly of\nhis late . . . “",

        "One evening she was in difficulties about the quarantine, which was\nenforced that year on the Italian frontier.  The local doctor had\ngone down that morning to see the Italian doctor and arrange some\ndetails.  “Then, perhaps, my dear,” she said to her husband, “he is\nthe quarantine.”  “No, my love,” replied her husband.  “The\nquarantine is not a person, it is a place where they put people\";\nbut she would not be comforted, and suspected the quarantine as an\nenemy that might at any moment pounce out upon her and her parrots.\nSo a lady told me once that she had been in like trouble about the\nanthem.  She read in her prayer-book that in choirs and places where\nthey sing “here followeth the anthem,” yet the person with this most\nmysteriously sounding name never did follow.  They had a choir, and\nno one could say the church was not a place where they sang, for\nthey did sing—both chants and hymns.  Why, then, this persistent\nslackness on the part of the anthem, who at this juncture should\nfollow her papa, the rector, into the reading-desk?  No doubt he\nwould come some day, and then what would he be like?  Fair or dark?\nTall or short?  Would he be bald and wear spectacles like papa, or\nwould he be young and good-looking?  Anyhow, there was something\nwrong, for it was announced that he would follow, and he never did\nfollow; therefore there was no knowing what he might not do next.",
        "I heard of the parrots a year or two later as giving lessons in\nItalian to an English maid.  I do not know what their terms were.\nAlas! since then both they and their mistress have joined the\nmajority.  When the poor lady felt her end was near she desired (and\nthe responsibility for this must rest with her, not me) that the\nbirds might be destroyed, as fearing that they might come to be\nneglected, and knowing that they could never be loved again as she\nhad loved them.  On being told that all was over, she said, “Thank\nyou,” and immediately expired.",
        "Reflecting in such random fashion, and strolling with no greater\nmethod, I worked my way back through Cheapside and found myself once\nmore in front of Sweeting’s window.  Again the turtles attracted me.\nThey were alive, and so far at any rate they agreed with me.  Nay,\nthey had eyes, mouths, legs, if not arms, and feet, so there was\nmuch in which we were both of a mind, but surely they must be\nmistaken in arming themselves so very heavily.  Any creature on\ngetting what the turtle aimed at would overreach itself and be\nlanded not in safety but annihilation.  It should have no communion\nwith the outside world at all, for death could creep in wherever the\ncreature could creep out; and it must creep out somewhere if it was\nto hook on to outside things.  What death can be more absolute than\nsuch absolute isolation?  Perfect death, indeed, if it were\nattainable (which it is not), is as near perfect security as we can\nreach, but it is not the kind of security aimed at by any animal\nthat is at the pains of defending itself.  For such want to have\nthings both ways, desiring the livingness of life without its\nperils, and the safety of death without its deadness, and some of us\ndo actually get this for a considerable time, but we do not get it\nby plating ourselves with armour as the turtle does.  We tried this\nin the Middle Ages, and no longer mock ourselves with the weight of\narmour that our forefathers carried in battle.  Indeed the more\ndeadly the weapons of attack become the more we go into the fight\nslug-wise.",
        "Slugs have ridden their contempt for defensive armour as much to\ndeath as the turtles their pursuit of it.  They have hardly more\nthan skin enough to hold themselves together; they court death every\ntime they cross the road.  Yet death comes not to them more than to\nthe turtle, whose defences are so great that there is little left\ninside to be defended.  Moreover, the slugs fare best in the long\nrun, for turtles are dying out, while slugs are not, and there must\nbe millions of slugs all the world over for every single turtle.  Of\nthe two vanities, therefore, that of the slug seems most\nsubstantial.",
        "In either case the creature thinks itself safe, but is sure to be\nfound out sooner or later; nor is it easy to explain this mockery\nsave by reflecting that everything must have its meat in due season,\nand that meat can only be found for such a multitude of mouths by\ngiving everything as meat in due season to something else.  This is\nlike the Kilkenny cats, or robbing Peter to pay Paul; but it is the\nway of the world, and as every animal must contribute in kind to the\npicnic of the universe, one does not see what better arrangement\ncould be made than the providing each race with a hereditary\nfallacy, which shall in the end get it into a scrape, but which\nshall generally stand the wear and tear of life for some time.  “Do\nut des” is the writing on all flesh to him that eats it; and no\ncreature is dearer to itself than it is to some other that would\ndevour it.",
        "Nor is there any statement or proposition more invulnerable than\nliving forms are.  Propositions prey upon and are grounded upon one\nanother just like living forms.  They support one another as plants\nand animals do; they are based ultimately on credit, or faith,\nrather than the cash of irrefragable conviction.  The whole universe\nis carried on on the credit system, and if the mutual confidence on\nwhich it is based were to collapse, it must itself collapse\nimmediately.  Just or unjust, it lives by faith; it is based on\nvague and impalpable opinion that by some inscrutable process passes\ninto will and action, and is made manifest in matter and in flesh:\nit is meteoric—suspended in midair; it is the baseless fabric of a\nvision so vast, so vivid, and so gorgeous that no base can seem more\nbroad than such stupendous baselessness, and yet any man can bring\nit about his ears by being over-curious; when faith fails a system\nbased on faith fails also.",
        "Whether the universe is really a paying concern, or whether it is an\ninflated bubble that must burst sooner or later, this is another\nmatter.  If people were to demand cash payment in irrefragable\ncertainty for everything that they have taken hitherto as paper\nmoney on the credit of the bank of public opinion, is there money\nenough behind it all to stand so great a drain even on so great a\nreserve?  Probably there is not, but happily there can be no such\npanic, for even though the cultured classes may do so, the\nuncultured are too dull to have brains enough to commit such\nstupendous folly.  It takes a long course of academic training to\neducate a man up to the standard which he must reach before he can\nentertain such questions seriously, and by a merciful dispensation\nof Providence, university training is almost as costly as it is\nunprofitable.  The majority will thus be always unable to afford it,\nand will base their opinions on mother wit and current opinion\nrather than on demonstration.",
        "So I turned my steps homewards; I saw a good many more things on my\nway home, but I was told that I was not to see more this time than I\ncould get into twelve pages of the Universal Review; I must\ntherefore reserve any remark which I think might perhaps entertain\nthe reader for another occasion.",
        "When a thing is old, broken, and useless we throw it on the dust-\nheap, but when it is sufficiently old, sufficiently broken, and\nsufficiently useless we give money for it, put it into a museum, and\nread papers over it which people come long distances to hear.  By-\nand-by, when the whirligig of time has brought on another revenge,\nthe museum itself becomes a dust-heap, and remains so till after\nlong ages it is re-discovered, and valued as belonging to a neo-\nrubbish age—containing, perhaps, traces of a still older paleo-\nrubbish civilisation.  So when people are old, indigent, and in all\nrespects incapable, we hold them in greater and greater contempt as\ntheir poverty and impotence increase, till they reach the pitch when\nthey are actually at the point to die, whereon they become sublime.\nThen we place every resource our hospitals can command at their\ndisposal, and show no stint in our consideration for them.",
        "It is the same with all our interests.  We care most about extremes\nof importance and of unimportance; but extremes of importance are\ntainted with fear, and a very imperfect fear casteth out love.\nExtremes of unimportance cannot hurt us, therefore we are well\ndisposed towards them; the means may come to do so, therefore we do\nnot love them.  Hence we pick a fly out of a milk-jug and watch with\npleasure over its recovery, for we are confident that under no\nconceivable circumstances will it want to borrow money from us; but\nwe feel less sure about a mouse, so we show it no quarter.  The\ncompilers of our almanacs well know this tendency of our natures, so\nthey tell us, not when Noah went into the ark, nor when the temple\nof Jerusalem was dedicated, but that Lindley Murray, grammarian,\ndied January 16, 1826.  This is not because they could not find so\nmany as three hundred and sixty-five events of considerable interest\nsince the creation of the world, but because they well know we would\nrather hear of something less interesting.  We care most about what\nconcerns us either very closely, or so little that practically we\nhave nothing whatever to do with it.",
        "I once asked a young Italian, who professed to have a considerable\nknowledge of English literature, which of all our poems pleased him\nbest.  He replied without a moment’s hesitation:-",
        "He said this was better than anything in Italian.  They had Dante\nand Tasso, and ever so many more great poets, but they had nothing\ncomparable to “Hey diddle diddle,” nor had he been able to conceive\nhow any one could have written it.  Did I know the author’s name,\nand had we given him a statue?  On this I told him of the young lady\nof Harrow who would go to church in a barrow, and plied him with\nwhatever rhyming nonsense I could call to mind, but it was no use;\nall of these things had an element of reality that robbed them of\nhalf their charm, whereas “Hey diddle diddle” had nothing in it that\ncould conceivably concern him.",
        "So again it is with the things that gall us most.  What is it that\nrises up against us at odd times and smites us in the face again and\nagain for years after it has happened?  That we spent all the best\nyears of our life in learning what we have found to be a swindle,\nand to have been known to be a swindle by those who took money for\nmisleading us?  That those on whom we most leaned most betrayed us?\nThat we have only come to feel our strength when there is little\nstrength left of any kind to feel?  These things will hardly much\ndisturb a man of ordinary good temper.  But that he should have said\nthis or that little unkind and wanton saying; that he should have\ngone away from this or that hotel and given a shilling too little to\nthe waiter; that his clothes were shabby at such or such a garden-\nparty—these things gall us as a corn will sometimes do, though the\nloss of a limb way not be seriously felt.",
        "I have been reminded lately of these considerations with more than\ncommon force by reading the very voluminous correspondence left by\nmy grandfather, Dr. Butler, of Shrewsbury, whose memoirs I am\nengaged in writing.  I have found a large number of interesting\nletters on subjects of serious import, but must confess that it is\nto the hardly less numerous lighter letters that I have been most\nattracted, nor do I feel sure that my eminent namesake did not share\nmy predilection.  Among other letters in my possession I have one\nbundle that has been kept apart, and has evidently no connection\nwith Dr. Butler’s own life.  I cannot use these letters, therefore,\nfor my book, but over and above the charm of their inspired\nspelling, I find them of such an extremely trivial nature that I\nincline to hope the reader may derive as much amusement from them as\nI have done myself, and venture to give them the publicity here\nwhich I must refuse them in my book.  The dates and signatures have,\nwith the exception of Mrs. Newton’s, been carefully erased, but I\nhave collected that they were written by the two servants of a\nsingle lady who resided at no great distance from London, to two\nnieces of the said lady who lived in London itself.  The aunt never\nwrites, but always gets one of the servants to do so for her.  She\nappears either as “your aunt” or as “She\"; her name is not given,\nbut she is evidently looked upon with a good deal of awe by all who\nhad to do with her.",
        "The letters almost all of them relate to visits either of the aunt\nto London, or of the nieces to the aunt’s home, which, from\noccasional allusions to hopping, I gather to have been in Kent,\nSussex, or Surrey.  I have arranged them to the best of my power,\nand take the following to be the earliest.  It has no signature, but\nis not in the handwriting of the servant who styles herself\nElizabeth, or Mrs. Newton.  It runs:-",

The sheet is headed\nby a beautifully embossed device of some holly in red and green,\nwishing the recipient of the letter a merry Xmas and a happy new\nyear, while the border is crimped and edged with blue.  I know not\nwhat it is, but there is something in the writer’s highly finished\nstyle that reminds me of Mendelssohn.  It would almost do for the\nwords of one of his celebrated “Lieder ohne Worte”:",
        "“DEAR MISS MARIA,—I hasten to acknowledge the receipt of your kind\nnote with the inclosure for which I return my best thanks.  I need\nscarcely say how glad I was to know that the volumes secured your\napproval, and that the announcement of the improvement in the\ncondition of your Sister’s legs afforded me infinite pleasure.  The\ngratifying news encouraged me in the hope that now the nature of the\ndisorder is comprehended her legs will—notwithstanding the process\nmay be gradual—ultimately get quite well.  The pretty Robin\nRedbreast which lay ensconced in your epistle, conveyed to me, in\nterms more eloquent than words, how much you desired me those\nCompliments which the little missive he bore in his bill expressed;\nthe emblem is sweetly pretty, and now that we are again allowed to\nfelicitate each other on another recurrence of the season of the\nChristian’s rejoicing, permit me to tender to yourself, and by you\nto your Sister, mine and my Wife’s heartfelt congratulations and\nwarmest wishes with respect to the coming year.  It is a common\nbelief that if we take a retrospective view of each departing year,\nas it behoves us annually to do, we shall find the blessings which\nwe have received to immeasurably outnumber our causes of sorrow.\nSpeaking for myself I can fully subscribe to that sentiment, and\ndoubtless neither Miss — nor yourself are exceptions.  Miss —’s\nillness and consequent confinement to the house has been a severe\ntrial, but in that trouble an opportunity was afforded you to prove\na Sister’s devotion and she has been enabled to realise a larger (if\npossible) display of sisterly affection.",
        "“A happy Christmas to you both, and may the new year prove a\nCornucopia from which still greater blessings than even those we\nhave hitherto received, shall issue, to benefit us all by\ncontributing to our temporal happiness and, what is of higher\nimportance, conducing to our felicity hereafter.",

        "How little what is commonly called education can do after all\ntowards the formation of a good style, and what a delightful volume\nmight not be entitled “Half Hours with the Worst Authors.”  Why, the\nfinest word I know of in the English language was coined, not by my\npoor old grandfather, whose education had left little to desire, nor\nby any of the admirable scholars whom he in his turn educated, but\nby an old matron who presided over one of the halls, or houses of\nhis school.",
        "This good lady, whose name by the way was Bromfield, had a fine high\ntemper of her own, or thought it politic to affect one.  One night\nwhen the boys were particularly noisy she burst like a hurricane\ninto the hall, collared a youngster, and told him he was “the ramp-\ningest-scampingest-rackety-tackety-tow-row-roaringest boy in the\nwhole school.”  Would Mrs. Newton have been able to set the aunt and\nthe dog before us so vividly if she had been more highly educated?\nWould Mrs. Bromfield have been able to forge and hurl her\nthunderbolt of a word if she had been taught how to do so, or indeed\nbeen at much pains to create it at all?  It came.  It was her [Greek\ntext].  She did not probably know that she had done what the\ngreatest scholar would have had to rack his brains over for many an\nhour before he could even approach.  Tradition says that having\nbrought down her boy she looked round the hall in triumph, and then\nafter a moment’s lull said, “Young gentlemen, prayers are excused,\"\nand left them.",
        "I have sometimes thought that, after all, the main use of a\nclassical education consists in the check it gives to originality,\nand the way in which it prevents an inconvenient number of people\nfrom using their own eyes.  That we will not be at the trouble of\nlooking at things for ourselves if we can get any one to tell us\nwhat we ought to see goes without saying, and it is the business of\nschools and universities to assist us in this respect.  The theory\nof evolution teaches that any power not worked at pretty high\npressure will deteriorate:  originality and freedom from affectation\nare all very well in their way, but we can easily have too much of\nthem, and it is better that none should be either original or free\nfrom cant but those who insist on being so, no matter what\nhindrances obstruct, nor what incentives are offered them to see\nthings through the regulation medium.",
        "To insist on seeing things for oneself is to be in [Greek text], or\nin plain English, an idiot; nor do I see any safer check against\ngeneral vigour and clearness of thought, with consequent terseness\nof expression, than that provided by the curricula of our\nuniversities and schools of public instruction.  If a young man, in\nspite of every effort to fit him with blinkers, will insist on\ngetting rid of them, he must do so at his own risk.  He will not be\nlong in finding out his mistake.  Our public schools and\nuniversities play the beneficent part in our social scheme that\ncattle do in forests:  they browse the seedlings down and prevent\nthe growth of all but the luckiest and sturdiest.  Of course, if\nthere are too many either cattle or schools, they browse so\neffectually that they find no more food, and starve till equilibrium\nis restored; but it seems to be a provision of nature that there\nshould always be these alternate periods, during which either the\ncattle or the trees are getting the best of it; and, indeed, without\nsuch provision we should have neither the one nor the other.  At\nthis moment the cattle, doubtless, are in the ascendant, and if\nuniversity extension proceeds much farther, we shall assuredly have\nno more Mrs. Newtons and Mrs. Bromfields; but whatever is is best,\nand, on the whole, I should propose to let things find pretty much\ntheir own level.",
        "However this may be, who can question that the treasures hidden in\nmany a country house contain sleeping beauties even fairer than\nthose that I have endeavoured to waken from long sleep in the\nforegoing article?  How many Mrs. Quicklys are there not living in\nLondon at this present moment?  For that Mrs. Quickly was an\ninvention of Shakespeare’s I will not believe.  The old woman from\nwhom he drew said every word that he put into Mrs. Quickly’s mouth,\nand a great deal more which he did not and perhaps could not make\nuse of.  This question, however, would again lead me far from my\nsubject, which I should mar were I to dwell upon it longer, and\ntherefore leave with the hope that it may give my readers absolutely\nno food whatever for reflection.",
        "I have been asked to speak on the question how to make the best of\nlife, but may as well confess at once that I know nothing about it.\nI cannot think that I have made the best of my own life, nor is it\nlikely that I shall make much better of what may or may not remain\nto me.  I do not even know how to make the best of the twenty\nminutes that your committee has placed at my disposal, and as for\nlife as a whole, who ever yet made the best of such a colossal\nopportunity by conscious effort and deliberation?  In little things\nno doubt deliberate and conscious effort will help us, but we are\nspeaking of large issues, and such kingdoms of heaven as the making\nthe best of these come not by observation.",
        "The question, therefore, on which I have undertaken to address you\nis, as you must all know, fatuous, if it be faced seriously.  Life\nis like playing a violin solo in public and learning the instrument\nas one goes on.  One cannot make the best of such impossibilities,\nand the question is doubly fatuous until we are told which of our\ntwo lives—the conscious or the unconscious—is held by the asker to\nbe the truer life.  Which does the question contemplate—the life we\nknow, or the life which others may know, but which we know not?",
        "Death gives a life to some men and women compared with which their\nso-called existence here is as nothing.  Which is the truer life of\nShakespeare, Handel, that divine woman who wrote the “Odyssey,” and\nof Jane Austen—the life which palpitated with sensible warm motion\nwithin their own bodies, or that in virtue of which they are still\npalpitating in ours?  In whose consciousness does their truest life\nconsist—their own, or ours?  Can Shakespeare be said to have begun\nhis true life till a hundred years or so after he was dead and\nburied?  His physical life was but as an embryonic stage, a coming\nup out of darkness, a twilight and dawn before the sunrise of that\nlife of the world to come which he was to enjoy hereafter.  We all\nlive for a while after we are gone hence, but we are for the most\npart stillborn, or at any rate die in infancy, as regards that life\nwhich every age and country has recognised as higher and truer than\nthe one of which we are now sentient.  As the life of the race is\nlarger, longer, and in all respects more to be considered than that\nof the individual, so is the life we live in others larger and more\nimportant than the one we live in ourselves.  This appears nowhere\nperhaps more plainly than in the case of great teachers, who often\nin the lives of their pupils produce an effect that reaches far\nbeyond anything produced while their single lives were yet\nunsupplemented by those other lives into which they infused their\nown.",
        "Death to such people is the ending of a short life, but it does not\ntouch the life they are already living in those whom they have\ntaught; and happily, as none can know when he shall die, so none can\nmake sure that he too shall not live long beyond the grave; for the\nlife after death is like money before it—no one can be sure that it\nmay not fall to him or her even at the eleventh hour.  Money and\nimmortality come in such odd unaccountable ways that no one is cut\noff from hope.  We may not have made either of them for ourselves,\nbut yet another may give them to us in virtue of his or her love,\nwhich shall illumine us for ever, and establish us in some heavenly\nmansion whereof we neither dreamed nor shall ever dream.  Look at\nthe Doge Loredano Loredani, the old man’s smile upon whose face has\nbeen reproduced so faithfully in so many lands that it can never\nhenceforth be forgotten—would he have had one hundredth part of the\nlife he now lives had he not been linked awhile with one of those\nheaven-sent men who know che cosa e amor?  Look at Rembrandt’s old\nwoman in our National Gallery; had she died before she was eighty-\nthree years old she would not have been living now.  Then, when she\nwas eighty-three, immortality perched upon her as a bird on a\nwithered bough.",
        "I seem to hear some one say that this is a mockery, a piece of\nspecial pleading, a giving of stones to those that ask for bread.\nLife is not life unless we can feel it, and a life limited to a\nknowledge of such fraction of our work as may happen to survive us\nis no true life in other people; salve it as we may, death is not\nlife any more than black is white.",
        "The objection is not so true as it sounds.  I do not deny that we\nhad rather not die, nor do I pretend that much even in the case of\nthe most favoured few can survive them beyond the grave.  It is only\nbecause this is so that our own life is possible; others have made\nroom for us, and we should make room for others in our turn without\nundue repining.  What I maintain is that a not inconsiderable number\nof people do actually attain to a life beyond the grave which we can\nall feel forcibly enough, whether they can do so or not—that this\nlife tends with increasing civilisation to become more and more\npotent, and that it is better worth considering, in spite of its\nbeing unfelt by ourselves, than any which we have felt or can ever\nfeel in our own persons.",
        "Take an extreme case.  A group of people are photographed by\nEdison’s new process—say Titiens, Trebelli, and Jenny Lind, with\nany two of the finest men singers the age has known—let them be\nphotographed incessantly for half an hour while they perform a scene\nin “Lohengrin\"; let all be done stereoscopically.  Let them be\nphonographed at the same time so that their minutest shades of\nintonation are preserved, let the slides be coloured by a competent\nartist, and then let the scene be called suddenly into sight and\nsound, say a hundred years hence.  Are those people dead or alive?\nDead to themselves they are, but while they live so powerfully and\nso livingly in us, which is the greater paradox—to say that they\nare alive or that they are dead?  To myself it seems that their life\nin others would be more truly life than their death to themselves is\ndeath.  Granted that they do not present all the phenomena of life—\nwho ever does so even when he is held to be alive?  We are held to\nbe alive because we present a sufficient number of living phenomena\nto let the others go without saying; those who see us take the part\nfor the whole here as in everything else, and surely, in the case\nsupposed above, the phenomena of life predominate so powerfully over\nthose of death, that the people themselves must be held to be more\nalive than dead.  Our living personality is, as the word implies,\nonly our mask, and those who still own such a mask as I have\nsupposed have a living personality.  Granted again that the case\njust put is an extreme one; still many a man and many a woman has so\nstamped him or herself on his work that, though we would gladly have\nthe aid of such accessories as we doubtless presently shall have to\nthe livingness of our great dead, we can see them very sufficiently\nthrough the master pieces they have left us.",
        "As for their own unconsciousness I do not deny it.  The life of the\nembryo was unconscious before birth, and so is the life—I am\nspeaking only of the life revealed to us by natural religion—after\ndeath.  But as the embryonic and infant life of which we were\nunconscious was the most potent factor in our after life of\nconsciousness, so the effect which we may unconsciously produce in\nothers after death, and it may be even before it on those who have\nnever seen us, is in all sober seriousness our truer and more\nabiding life, and the one which those who would make the best of\ntheir sojourn here will take most into their consideration.",
        "Unconsciousness is no bar to livingness.  Our conscious actions are\na drop in the sea as compared with our unconscious ones.  Could we\nknow all the life that is in us by way of circulation, nutrition,\nbreathing, waste and repair, we should learn what an infinitesimally\nsmall part consciousness plays in our present existence; yet our\nunconscious life is as truly life as our conscious life, and though\nit is unconscious to itself it emerges into an indirect and\nvicarious consciousness in our other and conscious self, which\nexists but in virtue of our unconscious self.  So we have also a\nvicarious consciousness in others.  The unconscious life of those\nthat have gone before us has in great part moulded us into such men\nand women as we are, and our own unconscious lives will in like\nmanner have a vicarious consciousness in others, though we be dead\nenough to it in ourselves.",
        "If it is again urged that it matters not to us how much we may be\nalive in others, if we are to know nothing about it, I reply that\nthe common instinct of all who are worth considering gives the lie\nto such cynicism.  I see here present some who have achieved, and\nothers who no doubt will achieve, success in literature.  Will one\nof them hesitate to admit that it is a lively pleasure to her to\nfeel that on the other side of the world some one may be smiling\nhappily over her work, and that she is thus living in that person\nthough she knows nothing about it?  Here it seems to me that true\nfaith comes in.  Faith does not consist, as the Sunday School pupil\nsaid, “in the power of believing that which we know to be untrue.\"\nIt consists in holding fast that which the healthiest and most\nkindly instincts of the best and most sensible men and women are\nintuitively possessed of, without caring to require much evidence\nfurther than the fact that such people are so convinced; and for my\nown part I find the best men and women I know unanimous in feeling\nthat life in others, even though we know nothing about it, is\nnevertheless a thing to be desired and gratefully accepted if we can\nget it either before death or after.  I observe also that a large\nnumber of men and women do actually attain to such life, and in some\ncases continue so to live, if not for ever, yet to what is\npractically much the same thing.  Our life then in this world is, to\nnatural religion as much as to revealed, a period of probation.  The\nuse we make of it is to settle how far we are to enter into another,\nand whether that other is to be a heaven of just affection or a hell\nof righteous condemnation.",
        "Who, then, are the most likely so to run that they may obtain this\nveritable prize of our high calling?  Setting aside such lucky\nnumbers drawn as it were in the lottery of immortality, which I have\nreferred to casually above, and setting aside also the chances and\nchanges from which even immortality is not exempt, who on the whole\nare most likely to live anew in the affectionate thoughts of those\nwho never so much as saw them in the flesh, and know not even their\nnames?  There is a nisus, a straining in the dull dumb economy of\nthings, in virtue of which some, whether they will it and know it or\nno, are more likely to live after death than others, and who are\nthese?  Those who aimed at it as by some great thing that they would\ndo to make them famous?  Those who have lived most in themselves and\nfor themselves, or those who have been most ensouled consciously,\nbut perhaps better unconsciously, directly but more often\nindirectly, by the most living souls past and present that have\nflitted near them?  Can we think of a man or woman who grips us\nfirmly, at the thought of whom we kindle when we are alone in our\nhonest daw’s plumes, with none to admire or shrug his shoulders, can\nwe think of one such, the secret of whose power does not lie in the\ncharm of his or her personality—that is to say, in the wideness of\nhis or her sympathy with, and therefore life in and communion with\nother people?  In the wreckage that comes ashore from the sea of\ntime there is much tinsel stuff that we must preserve and study if\nwe would know our own times and people; granted that many a dead\ncharlatan lives long and enters largely and necessarily into our own\nlives; we use them and throw them away when we have done with them.\nI do not speak of these, I do not speak of the Virgils and Alexander\nPopes, and who can say how many more whose names I dare not mention\nfor fear of offending.  They are as stuffed birds or beasts in a\nMuseum, serviceable no doubt from a scientific standpoint, but with\nno vivid or vivifying hold upon us.  They seem to be alive, but are\nnot.  I am speaking of those who do actually live in us, and move us\nto higher achievements though they be long dead, whose life thrusts\nout our own and overrides it.  I speak of those who draw us ever\nmore towards them from youth to age, and to think of whom is to feel\nat once that we are in the hands of those we love, and whom we would\nmost wish to resemble.  What is the secret of the hold that these\npeople have upon us?  Is it not that while, conventionally speaking,\nalive, they most merged their lives in, and were in fullest\ncommunion with those among whom they lived?  They found their lives\nin losing them.  We never love the memory of any one unless we feel\nthat he or she was himself or herself a lover.",
        "I have seen it urged, again, in querulous accents, that the so-\ncalled immortality even of the most immortal is not for ever.  I see\na passage to this effect in a book that is making a stir as I write.\nI will quote it.  The writer says:-",
        "“So, it seems to me, is the immortality we so glibly predicate of\ndeparted artists.  If they survive at all, it is but a shadowy life\nthey live, moving on through the gradations of slow decay to distant\nbut inevitable death.  They can no longer, as heretofore, speak\ndirectly to the hearts of their fellow-men, evoking their tears or\nlaughter, and all the pleasures, be they sad or merry, of which\nimagination holds the secret.  Driven from the marketplace they\nbecome first the companions of the student, then the victims of the\nspecialist.  He who would still hold familiar intercourse with them\nmust train himself to penetrate the veil which in ever-thickening\nfolds conceals them from the ordinary gaze; he must catch the tone\nof a vanished society, he must move in a circle of alien\nassociations, he must think in a language not his own.” {5}",
        "This is crying for the moon, or rather pretending to cry for it, for\nthe writer is obviously insincere.  I see the Saturday Review says\nthe passage I have just quoted “reaches almost to poetry,” and\nindeed I find many blank verses in it, some of them very aggressive.\nNo prose is free from an occasional blank verse, and a good writer\nwill not go hunting over his work to rout them out, but nine or ten\nin little more than as many lines is indeed reaching too near to\npoetry for good prose.  This, however, is a trifle, and might pass\nif the tone of the writer was not so obviously that of cheap\npessimism.  I know not which is cheapest, pessimism or optimism.\nOne forces lights, the other darks; both are equally untrue to good\nart, and equally sure of their effect with the groundlings.  The one\nextenuates, the other sets down in malice.  The first is the more\namiable lie, but both are lies, and are known to be so by those who\nutter them.  Talk about catching the tone of a vanished society to\nunderstand Rembrandt or Giovanni Bellini!  It’s nonsense—the folds\ndo not thicken in front of these men; we understand them as well as\nthose among whom they went about in the flesh, and perhaps better.\nHomer and Shakespeare speak to us probably far more effectually than\nthey did to the men of their own time, and most likely we have them\nat their best.  I cannot think that Shakespeare talked better than\nwe hear him now in “Hamlet” or “Henry the Fourth\"; like enough he\nwould have been found a very disappointing person in a drawing-room.\nPeople stamp themselves on their work; if they have not done so they\nare naught; if they have we have them; and for the most part they\nstamp themselves deeper in their work than on their talk.  No doubt\nShakespeare and Handel will be one day clean forgotten, as though\nthey had never been born.  The world will in the end die; mortality\ntherefore itself is not immortal, and when death dies the life of\nthese men will die with it—but not sooner.  It is enough that they\nshould live within us and move us for many ages as they have and\nwill.  Such immortality, therefore, as some men and women are born\nto, achieve, or have thrust upon them, is a practical if not a\ntechnical immortality, and he who would have more let him have\nnothing.",
        "I see I have drifted into speaking rather of how to make the best of\ndeath than of life, but who can speak of life without his thoughts\nturning instantly to that which is beyond it?  He or she who has\nmade the best of the life after death has made the best of the life\nbefore it; who cares one straw for any such chances and changes as\nwill commonly befall him here if he is upheld by the full and\ncertain hope of everlasting life in the affections of those that\nshall come after?  If the life after death is happy in the hearts of\nothers, it matters little how unhappy was the life before it.",
        "And now I leave my subject, not without misgiving that I shall have\ndisappointed you.  But for the great attention which is being paid\nto the work from which I have quoted above, I should not have\nthought it well to insist on points with which you are, I doubt not,\nas fully impressed as I am:  but that book weakens the sanctions of\nnatural religion, and minimises the comfort which it affords us,\nwhile it does more to undermine than to support the foundations of\nwhat is commonly called belief.  Therefore I was glad to embrace\nthis opportunity of protesting.  Otherwise I should not have been so\nserious on a matter that transcends all seriousness.  Lord\nBeaconsfield cut it shorter with more effect.  When asked to give a\nrule of life for the son of a friend he said, “Do not let him try\nand find out who wrote the letters of Junius.”  Pressed for further\ncounsel he added, “Nor yet who was the man in the iron mask\"—and he\nwould say no more.  Don’t bore people.  And yet I am by no means\nsure that a good many people do not think themselves ill-used unless\nhe who addresses them has thoroughly well bored them—especially if\nthey have paid any money for hearing him.  My great namesake said,\n\"Surely the pleasure is as great of being cheated as to cheat,” and\ngreat as the pleasure both of cheating and boring undoubtedly is, I\nbelieve he was right.  So I remember a poem which came out some\nthirty years ago in Punch, about a young lady who went forth in\nquest to “Some burden make or burden bear, but which she did not\ngreatly care, oh Miserie.”  So, again, all the holy men and women\nwho in the Middle Ages professed to have discovered how to make the\nbest of life took care that being bored, if not cheated, should have\na large place in their programme.  Still there are limits, and I\nclose not without fear that I may have exceeded them.",
        "The only place in the Valsesia, except Varallo, where I at present\nsuspect the presence of Tabachetti {7} is at Montrigone, a little-\nknown sanctuary dedicated to St. Anne, about three-quarters of a\nmile south of Borgo-Sesia station.  The situation is, of course,\nlovely, but the sanctuary does not offer any features of\narchitectural interest.  The sacristan told me it was founded in\n1631; and in 1644 Giovanni d’Enrico, while engaged in superintending\nand completing the work undertaken here by himself and Giacomo\nFerro, fell ill and died.  I do not know whether or no there was an\nearlier sanctuary on the same site, but was told it was built on the\ndemolition of a stronghold belonging to the Counts of Biandrate.",
        "The incidents which it illustrates are treated with even more than\nthe homeliness usual in works of this description when not dealing\nwith such solemn events as the death and passion of Christ.  Except\nwhen these subjects were being represented, something of the\nlatitude, and even humour, allowed in the old mystery plays was\npermitted, doubtless from a desire to render the work more\nattractive to the peasants, who were the most numerous and most\nimportant pilgrims.  It is not until faith begins to be weak that it\nfears an occasionally lighter treatment of semi-sacred subjects, and\nit is impossible to convey an accurate idea of the spirit prevailing\nat this hamlet of sanctuary without attuning oneself somewhat to the\nmore pagan character of the place.  Of irreverence, in the sense of\na desire to laugh at things that are of high and serious import,\nthere is not a trace, but at the same time there is a certain\nunbending of the bow at Montrigone which is not perceivable at\nVarallo.",
        "The first chapel to the left on entering the church is that of the\nBirth of the Virgin.  St. Anne is sitting up in bed.  She is not at\nall ill—in fact, considering that the Virgin has only been born\nabout five minutes, she is wonderful; still the doctors think it may\nbe perhaps better that she should keep her room for half an hour\nlonger, so the bed has been festooned with red and white paper\nroses, and the counterpane is covered with bouquets in baskets and\nin vases of glass and china.  These cannot have been there during\nthe actual birth of the Virgin, so I suppose they had been in\nreadiness, and were brought in from an adjoining room as soon as the\nbaby had been born.  A lady on her left is bringing in some more\nflowers, which St. Anne is receiving with a smile and most gracious\ngesture of the hands.  The first thing she asked for, when the birth\nwas over, was for her three silver hearts.  These were immediately\nbrought to her, and she has got them all on, tied round her neck\nwith a piece of blue silk ribbon.",
        "Dear mamma has come.  We felt sure she would, and that any little\nmisunderstandings between her and Joachim would ere long be\nforgotten and forgiven.  They are both so good and sensible if they\nwould only understand one another.  At any rate, here she is, in\nhigh state at the right hand of the bed.  She is dressed in black,\nfor she has lost her husband some few years previously, but I do not\nbelieve a smarter, sprier old lady for her years could be found in\nPalestine, nor yet that either Giovanni d’Enrico or Giacomo Ferro\ncould have conceived or executed such a character.  The sacristan\nwanted to have it that she was not a woman at all, but was a\nportrait of St. Joachim, the Virgin’s father.  “Sembra una donna,\"\nhe pleaded more than once, “ma non e donna.”  Surely, however, in\nworks of art even more than in other things, there is no “is” but\nseeming, and if a figure seems female it must be taken as such.\nBesides, I asked one of the leading doctors at Varallo whether the\nfigure was man or woman.  He said it was evident I was not married,\nfor that if I had been I should have seen at once that she was not\nonly a woman but a mother-in-law of the first magnitude, or, as he\ncalled it, “una suocera tremenda,” and this without knowing that I\nwanted her to be a mother-in-law myself.  Unfortunately she had no\nreal drapery, so I could not settle the question as my friend Mr. H.\nF. Jones and I had been able to do at Varallo with the figure of Eve\nthat had been turned into a Roman soldier assisting at the capture\nof Christ.  I am not, however, disposed to waste more time upon\nanything so obvious, and will content myself with saying that we\nhave here the Virgin’s grandmother.  I had never had the pleasure,\nso far as I remembered, of meeting this lady before, and was glad to\nhave an opportunity of making her acquaintance.",
        "Tradition says that it was she who chose the Virgin’s name, and if\nso, what a debt of gratitude do we not owe her for her judicious\nselection!  It makes one shudder to think what might have happened\nif she had named the child Keren-Happuch, as poor Job’s daughter was\ncalled.  How could we have said, “Ave Keren-Happuch!”  What would\nthe musicians have done?  I forget whether Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz was\na man or a woman, but there were plenty of names quite as\nunmanageable at the Virgin’s grandmother’s option, and we cannot\nsufficiently thank her for having chosen one that is so euphonious\nin every language which we need take into account.  For this reason\nalone we should not grudge her her portrait, but we should try to\ndraw the line here.  I do not think we ought to give the Virgin’s\ngreat-grandmother a statue.  Where is it to end?  It is like Mr.\nCrookes’s ultimissimate atoms; we used to draw the line at ultimate\natoms, and now it seems we are to go a step farther back and have\nultimissimate atoms.  How long, I wonder, will it be before we feel\nthat it will be a material help to us to have ultimissimissimate\natoms?  Quavers stopped at demi-semi-demi, but there is no reason to\nsuppose that either atoms or ancestresses of the Virgin will be so\ncomplacent.",
        "I have said that on St. Anne’s left hand there is a lady who is\nbringing in some flowers.  St. Anne was always passionately fond of\nflowers.  There is a pretty story told about her in one of the\nFathers, I forget which, to the effect that when a child she was\nasked which she liked best—cakes or flowers?  She could not yet\nspeak plainly and lisped out, “Oh fowses, pretty fowses\"; she added,\nhowever, with a sigh and as a kind of wistful corollary, “but cakes\nare very nice.”  She is not to have any cakes, just now, but as soon\nas she has done thanking the lady for her beautiful nosegay, she is\nto have a couple of nice new-laid eggs, that are being brought her\nby another lady.  Valsesian women immediately after their\nconfinement always have eggs beaten up with wine and sugar, and one\ncan tell a Valsesian Birth of the Virgin from a Venetian or a\nFlorentine by the presence of the eggs.  I learned this from an\neminent Valsesian professor of medicine, who told me that, though\nnot according to received rules, the eggs never seemed to do any\nharm.  Here they are evidently to be beaten up, for there is neither\nspoon nor egg-cup, and we cannot suppose that they were hard-boiled.\nOn the other hand, in the Middle Ages Italians never used egg-cups\nand spoons for boiled eggs.  The mediaeval boiled egg was always\neaten by dipping bread into the yolk.",
        "Behind the lady who is bringing in the eggs is the under-under-nurse\nwho is at the fire warming a towel.  In the foreground we have the\nregulation midwife holding the regulation baby (who, by the way, was\nan astonishingly fine child for only five minutes old).  Then comes\nthe under-nurse—a good buxom creature, who, as usual, is feeling\nthe water in the bath to see that it is of the right temperature.\nNext to her is the head-nurse, who is arranging the cradle.  Behind\nthe head-nurse is the under-under-nurse’s drudge, who is just going\nout upon some errands.  Lastly—for by this time we have got all\nround the chapel—we arrive at the Virgin’s grandmother’s-body-\nguard, a stately, responsible-looking lady, standing in waiting upon\nher mistress.  I put it to the reader—is it conceivable that St.\nJoachim should have been allowed in such a room at such a time, or\nthat he should have had the courage to avail himself of the\npermission, even though it had been extended to him?  At any rate,\nis it conceivable that he should have been allowed to sit on St.\nAnne’s right hand, laying down the law with a “Marry, come up here,\"\nand a “Marry, go-down there,” and a couple of such unabashed collars\nas the old lady has put on for the occasion?",
        "Moreover (for I may as well demolish this mischievous confusion\nbetween St. Joachim and his mother-in-law once and for all), the\nmerest tyro in hagiology knows that St. Joachim was not at home when\nthe Virgin was born.  He had been hustled out of the temple for\nhaving no children, and had fled desolate and dismayed into the\nwilderness.  It shows how silly people are, for all the time he was\ngoing, if they had only waited a little, to be the father of the\nmost remarkable person of purely human origin who had ever been\nborn, and such a parent as this should surely not be hurried.  The\nstory is told in the frescoes of the chapel of Loreto, only a\nquarter of an hour’s walk from Varallo, and no one can have known it\nbetter than D’Enrico.  The frescoes are explained by written\npassages that tell us how, when Joachim was in the desert, an angel\ncame to him in the guise of a fair, civil young gentleman, and told\nhim the Virgin was to be born.  Then, later on, the same young\ngentleman appeared to him again, and bade him “in God’s name be\ncomforted, and turn again to his content,” for the Virgin had been\nactually born.  On which St. Joachim, who seems to have been of\nopinion that marriage after all WAS rather a failure, said that, as\nthings were going on so nicely without him, he would stay in the\ndesert just a little longer, and offered up a lamb as a pretext to\ngain time.  Perhaps he guessed about his mother-in-law, or he may\nhave asked the angel.  Of course, even in spite of such evidence as\nthis I may be mistaken about the Virgin’s grandmother’s sex, and the\nsacristan may be right; but I can only say that if the lady sitting\nby St. Anne’s bedside at Montrigone is the Virgin’s father—well, in\nthat case I must reconsider a good deal that I have been accustomed\nto believe was beyond question.",
        "Taken singly, I suppose that none of the figures in the chapel,\nexcept the Virgin’s grandmother, should be rated very highly.  The\nunder-nurse is the next best figure, and might very well be\nTabachetti’s, for neither Giovanni d’Enrico nor Giacomo Ferro was\nsuccessful with his female characters.  There is not a single really\ncomfortable woman in any chapel by either of them on the Sacro Monte\nat Varallo.  Tabachetti, on the other hand, delighted in women; if\nthey were young he made them comely and engaging, if they were old\nhe gave them dignity and individual character, and the under-nurse\nis much more in accordance with Tabachetti’s habitual mental\nattitude than with D’Enrico’s or Giacomo Ferro’s.  Still there are\nonly four figures out of the eleven that are mere otiose supers, and\ntaking the work as a whole it leaves a pleasant impression as being\nthroughout naive and homely, and sometimes, which is of less\nimportance, technically excellent.",
        "Allowance must, of course, be made for tawdry accessories and\nrepeated coats of shiny oleaginous paint—very disagreeable where it\nhas peeled off and almost more so where it has not.  What work could\nstand against such treatment as the Valsesian terra-cotta figures\nhave had to put up with?  Take the Venus of Milo; let her be done in\nterra-cotta, and have run, not much, but still something, in the\nbaking; paint her pink, two oils, all over, and then varnish her—it\nwill help to preserve the paint; glue a lot of horsehair on to her\npate, half of which shall have come off, leaving the glue still\nshowing; scrape her, not too thoroughly, get the village drawing-\nmaster to paint her again, and the drawing-master in the next\nprovincial town to put a forest background behind her with the\nbrightest emerald-green leaves that he can do for the money; let\nthis painting and scraping and repainting be repeated several times\nover; festoon her with pink and white flowers made of tissue paper;\nsurround her with the cheapest German imitations of the cheapest\ndecorations that Birmingham can produce; let the night air and\nwinter fogs get at her for three hundred years, and how easy, I\nwonder, will it be to see the goddess who will be still in great\npart there?  True, in the case of the Birth of the Virgin chapel at\nMontrigone, there is no real hair and no fresco background, but time\nhas had abundant opportunities without these.  I will conclude my\nnotice of this chapel by saying that on the left, above the door\nthrough which the under-under-nurse’s drudge is about to pass, there\nis a good painted terra-cotta bust, said—but I believe on no\nauthority—to be a portrait of Giovanni d’Enrico.  Others say that\nthe Virgin’s grandmother is Giovanni d’Enrico, but this is even more\nabsurd than supposing her to be St. Joachim.",
        "The next chapel to the Birth of the Virgin is that of the\nSposalizio.  There is no figure here which suggests Tabachetti, but\nstill there are some very good ones.  The best have no taint of\nbarocco; the man who did them, whoever he may have been, had\nevidently a good deal of life and go, was taking reasonable pains,\nand did not know too much.  Where this is the case no work can fail\nto please.  Some of the figures have real hair and some terra cotta.\nThere is no fresco background worth mentioning.  A man sitting on\nthe steps of the altar with a book on his lap, and holding up his\nhand to another, who is leaning over him and talking to him, is\namong the best figures; some of the disappointed suitors who are\nbreaking their wands are also very good.",
        "The angel in the Annunciation chapel, which comes next in order, is\na fine, burly, ship’s-figurehead, commercial-hotel sort of being\nenough, but the Virgin is very ordinary.  There is no real hair and\nno fresco background, only three dingy old blistered pictures of no\ninterest whatever.",
        "In the visit of Mary to Elizabeth there are three pleasing\nsubordinate lady attendants, two to the left and one to the right of\nthe principal figures; but these figures themselves are not\nsatisfactory.  There is no fresco background.  Some of the figures\nhave real hair and some terra cotta.",
        "In the Circumcision and Purification chapel—for both these events\nseem contemplated in the one that follows—there are doves, but\nthere is neither dog nor knife.  Still Simeon, who has the infant\nSaviour in his arms, is looking at him in a way which can only mean\nthat, knife or no knife, the matter is not going to end here.  At\nVarallo they have now got a dreadful knife for the Circumcision\nchapel.  They had none last winter.  What they have now got would do\nvery well to kill a bullock with, but could not be used\nprofessionally with safety for any animal smaller than a rhinoceros.\nI imagine that some one was sent to Novara to buy a knife, and that,\nthinking it was for the Massacre of the Innocents chapel, he got the\nbiggest he could see.  Then when he brought it back people said\n\"chow” several times, and put it upon the table and went away.",
        "Returning to Montrigone, the Simeon is an excellent figure, and the\nVirgin is fairly good, but the prophetess Anna, who stands just\nbehind her, is by far the most interesting in the group, and is\nalone enough to make me feel sure that Tabachetti gave more or less\nhelp here, as he had done years before at Orta.  She, too, like the\nVirgin’s grandmother, is a widow lady, and wears collars of a cut\nthat seems to have prevailed ever since the Virgin was born some\ntwenty years previously.  There is a largeness and simplicity of\ntreatment about the figure to which none but an artist of the\nhighest rank can reach, and D’Enrico was not more than a second or\nthird-rate man.  The hood is like Handel’s Truth sailing upon the\nbroad wings of Time, a prophetic strain that nothing but the old\nexperience of a great poet can reach.  The lips of the prophetess\nare for the moment closed, but she has been prophesying all the\nmorning, and the people round the wall in the background are in\necstasies at the lucidity with which she has explained all sorts of\ndifficulties that they had never been able to understand till now.\nThey are putting their forefingers on their thumbs and their thumbs\non their forefingers, and saying how clearly they see it all and\nwhat a wonderful woman Anna is.  A prophet indeed is not generally\nwithout honour save in his own country, but then a country is\ngenerally not without honour save with its own prophet, and Anna has\nbeen glorifying her country rather than reviling it.  Besides, the\nrule may not have applied to prophetesses.",
        "The Death of the Virgin is the last of the six chapels inside the\nchurch itself.  The Apostles, who of course are present, have all of\nthem real hair, but, if I may say so, they want a wash and a brush-\nup so very badly that I cannot feel any confidence in writing about\nthem.  I should say that, take them all round, they are a good\naverage sample of apostle as apostles generally go.  Two or three of\nthem are nervously anxious to find appropriate quotations in books\nthat lie open before them, which they are searching with eager\nhaste; but I do not see one figure about which I should like to say\npositively that it is either good or bad.  There is a good bust of a\nman, matching the one in the Birth of the Virgin chapel, which is\nsaid to be a portrait of Giovanni d’Enrico, but it is not known whom\nit represents.",
        "Outside the church, in three contiguous cells that form part of the\nfoundations, are:-",
        "1.  A dead Christ, the head of which is very impressive while the\nrest of the figure is poor.  I examined the treatment of the hair,\nwhich is terra-cotta, and compared it with all other like hair in\nthe chapels above described; I could find nothing like it, and think\nit most likely that Giacomo Ferro did the figure, and got Tabachetti\nto do the head, or that they brought the head from some unused\nfigure by Tabachetti at Varallo, for I know no other artist of the\ntime and neighbourhood who could have done it.",
        "2.  A Magdalene in the desert.  The desert is a little coal-cellar\nof an arch, containing a skull and a profusion of pink and white\npaper bouquets, the two largest of which the Magdalene is hugging\nwhile she is saying her prayers.  She is a very self-sufficient\nlady, who we may be sure will not stay in the desert a day longer\nthan she can help, and while there will flirt even with the skull if\nshe can find nothing better to flirt with.  I cannot think that her\nrepentance is as yet genuine, and as for her praying there is no\nobject in her doing so, for she does not want anything.",
        "3.  In the next desert there is a very beautiful figure of St. John\nthe Baptist kneeling and looking upwards.  This figure puzzles me\nmore than any other at Montrigone; it appears to be of the fifteenth\nrather than the sixteenth century; it hardly reminds me of\nGaudenzio, and still less of any other Valsesian artist.  It is a\nwork of unusual beauty, but I can form no idea as to its authorship.",
        "I wrote the foregoing pages in the church at Montrigone itself,\nhaving brought my camp-stool with me.  It was Sunday; the church was\nopen all day, but there was no mass said, and hardly any one came.\nThe sacristan was a kind, gentle, little old man, who let me do\nwhatever I wanted.  He sat on the doorstep of the main door, mending\nvestments, and to this end was cutting up a fine piece of figured\nsilk from one to two hundred years old, which, if I could have got\nit, for half its value, I should much like to have bought.  I sat in\nthe cool of the church while he sat in the doorway, which was still\nin shadow, snipping and snipping, and then sewing, I am sure with\nadmirable neatness.  He made a charming picture, with the arched\nportico over his head, the green grass and low church wall behind\nhim, and then a lovely landscape of wood and pasture and valleys and\nhillside.  Every now and then he would come and chirrup about\nJoachim, for he was pained and shocked at my having said that his\nJoachim was some one else and not Joachim at all.  I said I was very\nsorry, but I was afraid the figure was a woman.  He asked me what he\nwas to do.  He had known it, man and boy, this sixty years, and had\nalways shown it as St. Joachim; he had never heard any one but\nmyself question his ascription, and could not suddenly change his\nmind about it at the bidding of a stranger.  At the same time he\nfelt it was a very serious thing to continue showing it as the\nVirgin’s father if it was really her grandmother.  I told him I\nthought this was a case for his spiritual director, and that if he\nfelt uncomfortable about it he should consult his parish priest and\ndo as he was told.",
        "On leaving Montrigone, with a pleasant sense of having made\nacquaintance with a new and, in many respects, interesting work, I\ncould not get the sacristan and our difference of opinion out of my\nhead.  What, I asked myself, are the differences that unhappily\ndivide Christendom, and what are those that divide Christendom from\nmodern schools of thought, but a seeing of Joachims as the Virgin’s\ngrandmothers on a larger scale?  True, we cannot call figures\nJoachim when we know perfectly well that they are nothing of the\nkind; but I registered a vow that henceforward when I called\nJoachims the Virgin’s grandmothers I would bear more in mind than I\nhave perhaps always hitherto done, how hard it is for those who have\nbeen taught to see them as Joachims to think of them as something\ndifferent.  I trust that I have not been unfaithful to this vow in\nthe preceding article.  If the reader differs from me, let me ask\nhim to remember how hard it is for one who has got a figure well\ninto his head as the Virgin’s grandmother to see it as Joachim.",
        "This last summer I revisited Oropa, near Biella, to see what\nconnection I could find between the Oropa chapels and those at\nVarallo.  I will take this opportunity of describing the chapels at\nOropa, and more especially the remarkable fossil, or petrified girl\nschool, commonly known as the Dimora, or Sojourn of the Virgin Mary\nin the Temple.",
        "If I do not take these works so seriously as the reader may expect,\nlet me beg him, before he blames me, to go to Oropa and see the\noriginals for himself.  Have the good people of Oropa themselves\ntaken them very seriously?  Are we in an atmosphere where we need be\nat much pains to speak with bated breath?  We, as is well known,\nlove to take even our pleasures sadly; the Italians take even their\nsadness allegramente, and combine devotion with amusement in a\nmanner that we shall do well to study if not imitate.  For this best\nagrees with what we gather to have been the custom of Christ\nhimself, who, indeed, never speaks of austerity but to condemn it.\nIf Christianity is to be a living faith, it must penetrate a man’s\nwhole life, so that he can no more rid himself of it than he can of\nhis flesh and bones or of his breathing.  The Christianity that can\nbe taken up and laid down as if it were a watch or a book is\nChristianity in name only.  The true Christian can no more part from\nChrist in mirth than in sorrow.  And, after all, what is the essence\nof Christianity?  What is the kernel of the nut?  Surely common\nsense and cheerfulness, with unflinching opposition to the\ncharlatanisms and Pharisaisms of a man’s own times.  The essence of\nChristianity lies neither in dogma, nor yet in abnormally holy life,\nbut in faith in an unseen world, in doing one’s duty, in speaking\nthe truth, in finding the true life rather in others than in\noneself, and in the certain hope that he who loses his life on these\nbehalfs finds more than he has lost.  What can Agnosticism do\nagainst such Christianity as this?  I should be shocked if anything\nI had ever written or shall ever write should seem to make light of\nthese things.  I should be shocked also if I did not know how to be\namused with things that amiable people obviously intended to be\namusing.",
        "The reader may need to be reminded that Oropa is among the somewhat\ninfrequent sanctuaries at which the Madonna and infant Christ are\nnot white, but black.  I shall return to this peculiarity of Oropa\nlater on, but will leave it for the present.  For the general\ncharacteristics of the place I must refer the reader to my book,\n\"Alps and Sanctuaries.” {9}  I propose to confine myself here to the\nten or a dozen chapels containing life-sized terra-cotta figures,\npainted up to nature, that form one of the main features of the\nplace.  At a first glance, perhaps, all these chapels will seem\nuninteresting; I venture to think, however, that some, if not most\nof them, though falling a good deal short of the best work at\nVarallo and Crea, are still in their own way of considerable\nimportance.  The first chapel with which we need concern ourselves\nis numbered 4, and shows the Conception of the Virgin Mary.  It\nrepresents St. Anne as kneeling before a terrific dragon or, as the\nItalians call it, “insect,” about the size of a Crystal Palace\npleiosaur.  This “insect” is supposed to have just had its head\nbadly crushed by St. Anne, who seems to be begging its pardon.  The\ntext “Ipsa conteret caput tuum” is written outside the chapel.  The\nfigures have no artistic interest.  As regards dragons being called\ninsects, the reader may perhaps remember that the island of S.\nGiulio, in the Lago d’Orta, was infested with insetti, which S.\nGiulio destroyed, and which appear, in a fresco underneath the\nchurch on the island, to have been monstrous and ferocious dragons;\nbut I cannot remember whether their bodies are divided into three\nsections, and whether or no they have exactly six legs—without\nwhich, I am told, they cannot be true insects.",
        "The fifth chapel represents the birth of the Virgin.  Having\nobtained permission to go inside it, I found the date 1715 cut large\nand deep on the back of one figure before baking, and I imagine that\nthis date covers the whole.  There is a Queen Anne feeling\nthroughout the composition, and if we were told that the sculptor\nand Francis Bird, sculptor of the statue in front of St. Paul’s\nCathedral, had studied under the same master, we could very well\nbelieve it.  The apartment in which the Virgin was born is spacious,\nand in striking contrast to the one in which she herself gave birth\nto the Redeemer.  St. Anne occupies the centre of the composition,\nin an enormous bed; on her right there is a lady of the George\nCruikshank style of beauty, and on the left an older person.  Both\nare gesticulating and impressing upon St. Anne the enormous\nobligation she has just conferred upon mankind; they seem also to be\nimploring her not to overtax her strength, but, strange to say, they\nare giving her neither flowers nor anything to eat and drink.  I\nknow no other birth of the Virgin in which St. Anne wants so little\nkeeping up.",
        "I have explained in my book “Ex Voto,” {10} but should perhaps\nrepeat here, that the distinguishing characteristic of the Birth of\nthe Virgin, as rendered by Valsesian artists, is that St. Anne\nalways has eggs immediately after the infant is born, and usually a\ngood deal more, whereas the Madonna never has anything to eat or\ndrink.  The eggs are in accordance with a custom that still prevails\namong the peasant classes in the Valsesia, where women on giving\nbirth to a child generally are given a sabaglione—an egg beaten up\nwith a little wine, or rum, and sugar.  East of Milan the Virgin’s\nmother does not have eggs, and I suppose, from the absence of the\neggs at Oropa, that the custom above referred to does not prevail in\nthe Biellese district.  The Virgin also is invariably washed.  St.\nJohn the Baptist, when he is born at all, which is not very often,\nis also washed; but I have not observed that St. Elizabeth has\nanything like the attention paid her that is given to St. Anne.\nWhat, however, is wanting here at Oropa in meat and drink is made up\nin Cupids; they swarm like flies on the walls, clouds, cornices, and\ncapitals of columns.",
        "Against the right-hand wall are two lady-helps, each warming a towel\nat a glowing fire, to be ready against the baby should come out of\nits bath; while in the right-hand foreground we have the levatrice,\nwho having discharged her task, and being now so disposed, has\nremoved the bottle from the chimney-piece, and put it near some\nbread, fruit and a chicken, over which she is about to discuss the\nconfinement with two other gossips.  The levatrice is a very\ncharacteristic figure, but the best in the chapel is the one of the\nhead nurse, near the middle of the composition; she has now the\ninfant in full charge, and is showing it to St. Joachim, with an\nexpression as though she were telling him that her husband was a\nmerry man.  I am afraid Shakespeare was dead before the sculptor was\nborn, otherwise I should have felt certain that he had drawn\nJuliet’s nurse from this figure.  As for the little Virgin herself,\nI believe her to be a fine boy of about ten months old.  Viewing the\nwork as a whole, if I only felt more sure what artistic merit really\nis, I should say that, though the chapel cannot be rated very highly\nfrom some standpoints, there are others from which it may be praised\nwarmly enough.  It is innocent of anatomy-worship, free from\naffectation or swagger, and not devoid of a good deal of homely\nnaivete.  It can no more be compared with Tabachetti or Donatello\nthan Hogarth can with Rembrandt or Giovanni Bellini; but as it does\nnot transcend the limitations of its age, so neither is it wanting\nin whatever merits that age possessed; and there is no age without\nmerits of some kind.  There is no inscription saying who made the\nfigures, but tradition gives them to Pietro Aureggio Termine, of\nBiella, commonly called Aureggio.  This is confirmed by their strong\nresemblance to those in the Dimora Chapel, in which there is an\ninscription that names Aureggio as the sculptor.",
        "The sixth chapel deals with the Presentation of the Virgin in the\nTemple.  The Virgin is very small, but it must be remembered that\nshe is only seven years old, and she is not nearly so small as she\nis at Crea, where, though a life-sized figure is intended, the head\nis hardly bigger than an apple.  She is rushing up the steps with\nopen arms towards the High Priest, who is standing at the top.  For\nher it is nothing alarming; it is the High Priest who appears\nfrightened; but it will all come right in time.  The Virgin seems to\nbe saying, “Why, don’t you know me?  I’m the Virgin Mary.”  But the\nHigh Priest does not feel so sure about that, and will make further\ninquiries.  The scene, which comprises some twenty figures, is\nanimated enough, and though it hardly kindles enthusiasm, still does\nnot fail to please.  It looks as though of somewhat older date than\nthe Birth of the Virgin chapel, and I should say shows more signs of\ndirect Valsesian influence.  In Marocco’s book about Oropa it is\nascribed to Aureggio, but I find it difficult to accept this.",
        "The seventh, and in many respects most interesting chapel at Oropa,\nshows what is in reality a medieval Italian girl school, as nearly\nlike the thing itself as the artist could make it; we are expected,\nhowever, to see in this the high-class kind of Girton College for\nyoung gentlewomen that was attached to the Temple at Jerusalem,\nunder the direction of the Chief Priest’s wife, or some one of his\nnear female relatives.  Here all well-to-do Jewish young women\ncompleted their education, and here accordingly we find the Virgin,\nwhose parents desired she should shine in every accomplishment, and\nenjoy all the advantages their ample means commanded.",
        "I have met with no traces of the Virgin during the years between her\nPresentation in the Temple and her becoming head girl at Temple\nCollege.  These years, we may be assured, can hardly have been other\nthan eventful; but incidents, or bits of life, are like living\nforms—it is only here and here, as by rare chance, that one of them\ngets arrested and fossilised; the greater number disappear like the\ngreater number of antediluvian molluscs, and no one can say why one\nof these flies, as it were, of life should get preserved in amber\nmore than another.  Talk, indeed, about luck and cunning; what a\ngrain of sand as against a hundredweight is cunning’s share here as\nagainst luck’s.  What moment could be more humdrum and unworthy of\nspecial record than the one chosen by the artist for the chapel we\nare considering?  Why should this one get arrested in its flight and\nmade immortal when so many worthier ones have perished?  Yet\npreserved it assuredly is; it is as though some fairy’s wand had\nstruck the medieval Miss Pinkerton, Amelia Sedley, and others who do\nduty instead of the Hebrew originals.  It has locked them up as\nsleeping beauties, whose charms all may look upon.  Surely the hours\nare like the women grinding at the mill—the one is taken and the\nother left, and none can give the reason more than he can say why\nGallio should have won immortality by caring for none of “these\nthings.”",
        "It seems to me, moreover, that fairies have changed their practice\nnow in the matter of sleeping beauties, much as shopkeepers have\ndone in Regent Street.  Formerly the shopkeeper used to shut up his\ngoods behind strong shutters, so that no one might see them after\nclosing hours.  Now he leaves everything open to the eye and turns\nthe gas on.  So the fairies, who used to lock up their sleeping\nbeauties in impenetrable thickets, now leave them in the most public\nplaces they can find, as knowing that they will there most certainly\nescape notice.  Look at De Hooghe; look at “The Pilgrim’s Progress,\"\nor even Shakespeare himself—how long they slept unawakened, though\nthey were in broad daylight and on the public thoroughfares all the\ntime.  Look at Tabachetti, and the masterpieces he left at Varallo.\nHis figures there are exposed to the gaze of every passer-by; yet\nwho heeds them?  Who, save a very few, even know of their existence?\nLook again at Gaudenzio Ferrari, or the “Danse des Paysans,” by\nHolbein, to which I ventured to call attention in the Universal\nReview.  No, no; if a thing be in Central Africa, it is the glory of\nthis age to find it out; so the fairies think it safer to conceal\ntheir proteges under a show of openness; for the schoolmaster is\nmuch abroad, and there is no hedge so thick or so thorny as the\ndulness of culture.",
        "It may be, again, that ever so many years hence, when Mr. Darwin’s\nearth-worms shall have buried Oropa hundreds of feet deep, some one\nsinking a well or making a railway-cutting will unearth these\nchapels, and will believe them to have been houses, and to contain\nthe exuviae of the living forms that tenanted them.  In the\nmeantime, however, let us return to a consideration of the chapel as\nit may now be seen by any one who cares to pass that way.",
        "The work consists of about forty figures in all, not counting\nCupids, and is divided into four main divisions.  First, there is\nthe large public sitting-room or drawing-room of the College, where\nthe elder young ladies are engaged in various elegant employments.\nThree, at a table to the left, are making a mitre for the Bishop, as\nmay be seen from the model on the table.  Some are merely spinning\nor about to spin.  One young lady, sitting rather apart from the\nothers, is doing an elaborate piece of needlework at a tambour-frame\nnear the window; others are making lace or slippers, probably for\nthe new curate; another is struggling with a letter, or perhaps a\ntheme, which seems to be giving her a good deal of trouble, but\nwhich, when done, will, I am sure, be beautiful.  One dear little\ngirl is simply reading “Paul and Virginia” underneath the window,\nand is so concealed that I hardly think she can be seen from the\noutside at all, though from inside she is delightful; it was with\ngreat regret that I could not get her into any photograph.  One most\namiable young woman has got a child’s head on her lap, the child\nhaving played itself to sleep.  All are industriously and agreeably\nemployed in some way or other; all are plump; all are nice looking;\nthere is not one Becky Sharp in the whole school; on the contrary,\nas in “Pious Orgies,” all is pious—or sub-pious—and all, if not\ngreat, is at least eminently respectable.  One feels that St.\nJoachim and St. Anne could not have chosen a school more\njudiciously, and that if one had daughter oneself this is exactly\nwhere one would wish to place her.  If there is a fault of any kind\nin the arrangements, it is that they do not keep cats enough.  The\nplace is overrun with mice, though what these can find to eat I know\nnot.  It occurs to me also that the young ladies might be kept a\nlittle more free of spiders’ webs; but in all these chapels, bats,\nmice and spiders are troublesome.",
        "Off the main drawing-room on the side facing the window there is a\ndais, which is approached by a large raised semicircular step,\nhigher than the rest of the floor, but lower than the dais itself.\nThe dais is, of course, reserved for the venerable Lady Principal\nand the under-mistresses, one of whom, by the way, is a little more\nmondaine than might have been expected, and is admiring herself in a\nlooking-glass—unless, indeed, she is only looking to see if there\nis a spot of ink on her face.  The Lady Principal is seated near a\ntable, on which lie some books in expensive bindings, which I\nimagine to have been presented to her by the parents of pupils who\nwere leaving school.  One has given her a photographic album;\nanother a large scrap-book, for illustrations of all kinds; a third\nvolume has red edges, and is presumably of a devotional character.\nIf I dared venture another criticism, I should say it would be\nbetter not to keep the ink-pot on the top of these books.  The Lady\nPrincipal is being read to by the monitress for the week, whose duty\nit was to recite selected passages from the most approved Hebrew\nwriters; she appears to be a good deal outraged, possibly at the\nfaulty intonation of the reader, which she has long tried vainly to\ncorrect; or perhaps she has been hearing of the atrocious way in\nwhich her forefathers had treated the prophets, and is explaining to\nthe young ladies how impossible it would be, in their own more\nenlightened age, for a prophet to fail of recognition.",
        "On the half-dais, as I suppose the large semicircular step between\nthe main room and the dais should be called, we find, first, the\nmonitress for the week, who stands up while she recites; and\nsecondly, the Virgin herself, who is the only pupil allowed a seat\nso near to the august presence of the Lady Principal.  She is\nostensibly doing a piece of embroidery which is stretched on a\ncushion on her lap, but I should say that she was chiefly interested\nin the nearest of four pretty little Cupids, who are all trying to\nattract her attention, though they pay no court to any other young\nlady.  I have sometimes wondered whether the obviously scandalised\ngesture of the Lady Principal might not be directed at these Cupids,\nrather than at anything the monitress may have been reading, for she\nwould surely find them disquieting.  Or she may be saying, “Why,\nbless me!  I do declare the Virgin has got another hamper, and St.\nAnne’s cakes are always so terribly rich!”  Certainly the hamper is\nthere, close to the Virgin, and the Lady Principal’s action may be\nwell directed at it, but it may have been sent to some other young\nlady, and be put on the sub-dais for public exhibition.  It looks as\nif it might have come from Fortnum and Mason’s, and I half expected\nto find a label, addressing it to “The Virgin Mary, Temple College,\nJerusalem,” but if ever there was one the mice have long since eaten\nit.  The Virgin herself does not seem to care much about it, but if\nshe has a fault it is that she is generally a little apathetic.",
        "Whose the hamper was, however, is a point we shall never now\ncertainly determine, for the best fossil is worse than the worst\nliving form.  Why, alas! was not Mr. Edison alive when this chapel\nwas made?  We might then have had a daily phonographic recital of\nthe conversation, and an announcement might be put outside the\nchapels, telling us at what hours the figures would speak.",
        "On either of side the main room there are two annexes opening out\nfrom it; these are reserved chiefly for the younger children, some\nof whom, I think, are little boys.  In the left-hand annex, behind\nthe ladies who are making a mitre, there is a child who has got a\ncake, and another has some fruit—possibly given them by the Virgin-\n-and a third child is begging for some of it.  The light failed so\ncompletely here that I was not able to photograph any of these\nfigures.  It was a dull September afternoon, and the clouds had\nsettled thick round the chapel, which is never very light, and is\nnearly 4000 feet above the sea.  I waited till such twilight as made\nit hopeless that more detail could be got—and a queer ghostly place\nenough it was to wait in—but after giving the plate an exposure of\nfifty minutes, I saw I could get no more, and desisted.",
        "These long photographic exposures have the advantage that one is\ncompelled to study a work in detail through mere lack of other\nemployment, and that one can take one’s notes in peace without being\ntempted to hurry over them; but even so I continually find I have\nomitted to note, and have clean forgotten, much that I want later\non.",
        "In the other annex there are also one or two younger children, but\nit seems to have been set apart for conversation and relaxation more\nthan any other part of the establishment.",
        "I have already said that the work is signed by an inscription inside\nthe chapel, to the effect that the sculptures are by Pietro Aureggio\nTermine di Biella.  It will be seen that the young ladies are\nexceedingly like one another, and that the artist aimed at nothing\nmore than a faithful rendering of the life of his own times.  Let us\nbe thankful that he aimed at nothing less.  Perhaps his wife kept a\ngirls’ school; or he may have had a large family of fat, good-\nnatured daughters, whose little ways he had studied attentively; at\nall events the work is full of spontaneous incident, and cannot fail\nto become more and more interesting as the age it renders falls\nfarther back into the past.  It is to be regretted that many\nartists, better known men, have not been satisfied with the humbler\nambitions of this most amiable and interesting sculptor.  If he has\nleft us no laboured life-studies, he has at least done something for\nus which we can find nowhere else, which we should be very sorry not\nto have, and the fidelity of which to Italian life at the beginning\nof the last century will not be disputed.",
        "The eighth chapel is that of the Sposalizio, is certainly not by\nAureggio, and I should say was mainly by the same sculptor who did\nthe Presentation in the Temple.  On going inside I found the figures\nhad come from more than one source; some of them are constructed so\nabsolutely on Valsesian principles, as regards technique, that it\nmay be assumed they came from Varallo.  Each of these last figures\nis in three pieces, that are baked separately and cemented together\nafterwards, hence they are more easily transported; no more clay is\nused than is absolutely necessary; and the off-side of the figure is\nneglected; they will be found chiefly, if not entirely, at the top\nof the steps.  The other figures are more solidly built, and do not\nremind me in their business features of anything in the Valsesia.\nThere was a sculptor, Francesco Sala, of Locarno (doubtless the\nvillage a short distance below Varallo, and not the Locarno on the\nLago Maggiore), who made designs for some of the Oropa chapels, and\nsome of whose letters are still preserved, but whether the Valsesian\nfigures in this present work are by him or not I cannot say.",
        "The statues are twenty-five in number; I could find no date or\nsignature; the work reminds me of Montrigone; several of the figures\nare not at all bad, and several have horsehair for hair, as at\nVarallo.  The effect of the whole composition is better than we have\na right to expect from any sculpture dating from the beginning of\nthe last century.",
        "The ninth chapel, the Annunciation, presents no feature of interest;\nnor yet does the tenth, the Visit of Mary to Elizabeth.  The\neleventh, the Nativity, though rather better, is still not\nremarkable.",
        "The twelfth, the Purification, is absurdly bad, but I do not know\nwhether the expression of strong personal dislike to the Virgin\nwhich the High Priest wears is intended as prophetic, or whether it\nis the result of incompetence, or whether it is merely a smile gone\nwrong in the baking.  It is amusing to find Marocco, who has not\nbeen strict about archaeological accuracy hitherto, complain here\nthat there is an anachronism, inasmuch as some young ecclesiastics\nare dressed as they would be at present, and one of them actually\ncarries a wax candle.  This is not as it should be; in works like\nthose at Oropa, where implicit reliance is justly placed on the\nearnest endeavours that have been so successfully made to thoroughly\nand carefully and patiently ensure the accuracy of the minutest\ndetails, it is a pity that even a single error should have escaped\ndetection; this, however, has most unfortunately happened here, and\nMarocco feels it his duty to put us on our guard.  He explains that\nthe mistake arose from the sculptor’s having taken both his general\narrangement and his details from some picture of the fourteenth or\nfifteenth century, when the value of the strictest historical\naccuracy was not yet so fully understood.",
        "It seems to me that in the matter of accuracy, priests and men of\nscience whether lay or regular on the one hand, and plain people\nwhether lay or regular on the other, are trying to play a different\ngame, and fail to understand one another because they do not see\nthat their objects are not the same.  The cleric and the man of\nscience (who is only the cleric in his latest development) are\ntrying to develop a throat with two distinct passages—one that\nshall refuse to pass even the smallest gnat, and another that shall\ngracefully gulp even the largest camel; whereas we men of the street\ndesire but one throat, and are content that this shall swallow\nnothing bigger than a pony.  Every one knows that there is no such\neffectual means of developing the power to swallow camels as\nincessant watchfulness for opportunities of straining at gnats, and\nthis should explain many passages that puzzle us in the work both of\nour clerics and our scientists.  I, not being a man of science,\nstill continue to do what I said I did in “Alps and Sanctuaries,\"\nand make it a rule to earnestly and patiently and carefully swallow\na few of the smallest gnats I can find several times a day, as the\nbest astringent for the throat I know of.",
        "The thirteenth chapel is the Marriage Feast at Cana of Galilee.\nThis is the best chapel as a work of art; indeed, it is the only one\nwhich can claim to be taken quite seriously.  Not that all the\nfigures are very good; those to the left of the composition are\ncommonplace enough; nor are the Christ and the giver of the feast at\nall remarkable; but the ten or dozen figures of guests and\nattendants at the right-hand end of the work are as good as anything\nof their kind can be, and remind me so strongly of Tabachetti that I\ncannot doubt they were done by some one who was indirectly\ninfluenced by that great sculptor’s work.  It is not likely that\nTabachetti was alive long after 1640, by which time he would have\nbeen about eighty years old; and the foundations of this chapel were\nnot laid till about 1690; the statues are probably a few years\nlater; they can hardly, therefore, be by one who had even studied\nunder Tabachetti; but until I found out the dates, and went inside\nthe chapel to see the way in which the figures had been constructed,\nI was inclined to think they might be by Tabachetti himself, of\nwhom, indeed, they are not unworthy.  On examining the figures I\nfound them more heavily constructed than Tabachetti’s are, with\nsmaller holes for taking out superfluous clay, and more finished on\nthe off-sides.  Marocco says the sculptor is not known.  I looked in\nvain for any date or signature.  Possibly the right-hand figures\n(for the left-hand ones can hardly be by the same hand) may be by\nsome sculptor from Crea, which is at no very great distance from\nOropa, who was penetrated by Tabachetti’s influence; but whether as\nregards action and concert with one another, or as regards\nexcellence in detail, I do not see how anything can be more\nrealistic, and yet more harmoniously composed.  The placing of the\nmusicians in a minstrels’ gallery helps the effect; these musicians\nare six in number, and the other figures are twenty-three.  Under\nthe table, between Christ and the giver of the feast, there is a\ncat.",
        "The fourteenth chapel, the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, is without\ninterest.",
        "The fifteenth, the Coronation of the Virgin, contains forty-six\nangels, twenty-six cherubs, fifty-six saints, the Holy Trinity, the\nMadonna herself, and twenty-four innocents, making 156 statues in\nall.  Of these I am afraid there is not one of more than ordinary\nmerit; the most interesting is a half-length nude life-study of\nDisma—the good thief.  After what had been promised him it was\nimpossible to exclude him, but it was felt that a half-length nude\nfigure would be as much as he could reasonably expect.",
        "Behind the sanctuary there is a semi-ruinous and wholly valueless\nwork, which shows the finding of the black image, which is now in\nthe church, but is only shown on great festivals.",
        "This leads us to a consideration that I have delayed till now.  The\nblack image is the central feature of Oropa; it is the raison d’etre\nof the whole place, and all else is a mere incrustation, so to\nspeak, around it.  According to this image, then, which was carved\nby St. Luke himself, and than which nothing can be better\nauthenticated, both the Madonna and the infant Christ were as black\nas anything can be conceived.  It is not likely that they were as\nblack as they have been painted; no one yet ever was so black as\nthat; yet, even allowing for some exaggeration on St. Luke’s part,\nthey must have been exceedingly black if the portrait is to be\naccepted; and uncompromisingly black they accordingly are on most of\nthe wayside chapels for many a mile around Oropa.  Yet in the\nchapels we have been hitherto considering—works in which, as we\nknow, the most punctilious regard has been shown to accuracy—both\nthe Virgin and Christ are uncompromisingly white.  As in the shops\nunder the Colonnade where devotional knick-knacks are sold, you can\nbuy a black china image or a white one, whichever you like; so with\nthe pictures—the black and white are placed side by side—pagando\nil danaro si puo scegliere.  It rests not with history or with the\nChurch to say whether the Madonna and Child were black or white, but\nyou may settle it for yourself, whichever way you please, or rather\nyou are required, with the acquiescence of the Church, to hold that\nthey were both black and white at one and the same time.",
        "It cannot be maintained that the Church leaves the matter undecided,\nand by tolerating both types proclaims the question an open one, for\nshe acquiesces in the portrait by St. Luke as genuine.  How, then,\njustify the whiteness of the Holy Family in the chapels?  If the\nportrait is not known as genuine, why set such a stumbling-block in\nour paths as to show us a black Madonna and a white one, both as\nhistorically accurate, within a few yards of one another?",
        "I ask this not in mockery, but as knowing that the Church must have\nan explanation to give, if she would only give it, and as myself\nunable to find any, even the most farfetched, that can bring what we\nsee at Oropa, Loreto and elsewhere into harmony with modern\nconscience, either intellectual or ethical.",
        "I see, indeed, from an interesting article in the Atlantic Monthly\nfor September 1889, entitled “The Black Madonna of Loreto,” that\nblack Madonnas were so frequent in ancient Christian art that “some\nof the early writers of the Church felt obliged to account for it by\nexplaining that the Virgin was of a very dark complexion, as might\nbe proved by the verse of Canticles which says, ’I am black, but\ncomely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem.’  Others maintained that she\nbecame black during her sojourn in Egypt. . . .  Priests, of to-day,\nsay that extreme age and exposure to the smoke of countless altar-\ncandles have caused that change in complexion which the more naive\nfathers of the Church attributed to the power of an Egyptian sun\";\nbut the writer ruthlessly disposes of this supposition by pointing\nout that in nearly all the instances of black Madonnas it is the\nflesh alone that is entirely black, the crimson of the lips, the\nwhite of the eyes, and the draperies having preserved their original\ncolour.  The authoress of the article (Mrs. Hilliard) goes on to\ntell us that Pausanias mentions two statues of the black Venus, and\nsays that the oldest statue of Ceres among the Phigalenses was\nblack.  She adds that Minerva Aglaurus, the daughter of Cecrops, at\nAthens, was black; that Corinth had a black Venus, as also the\nThespians; that the oracles of Dodona and Delphi were founded by\nblack doves, the emissaries of Venus, and that the Isis Multimammia\nin the Capitol at Rome is black.",
        "Sometimes I have asked myself whether the Church does not intend to\nsuggest that the whole story falls outside the domain of history,\nand is to be held as the one great epos, or myth, common to all\nmankind; adaptable by each nation according to its own several\nneeds; translatable, so to speak, into the facts of each individual\nnation, as the written word is translatable into its language, but\nappertaining to the realm of the imagination rather than to that of\nthe understanding, and precious for spiritual rather than literal\ntruths.  More briefly, I have wondered whether she may not intend\nthat such details as whether the Virgin was white or black are of\nvery little importance in comparison with the basing of ethics on a\nstory that shall appeal to black races as well as to white ones.",
        "If so, it is time we were made to understand this more clearly.  If\nthe Church, whether of Rome or England, would lean to some such view\nas this—tainted though it be with mysticism—if we could see either\ngreat branch of the Church make a frank, authoritative attempt to\nbring its teaching into greater harmony with the educated\nunderstanding and conscience of the time, instead of trying to\nfetter that understanding with bonds that gall it daily more and\nmore profoundly; then I, for one, in view of the difficulty and\ngraciousness of the task, and in view of the great importance of\nhistorical continuity, would gladly sink much of my own private\nopinion as to the value of the Christian ideal, and would gratefully\nhelp either Church or both, according to the best of my very feeble\nability.  On these terms, indeed, I could swallow not a few camels\nmyself cheerfully enough.",
        "Can we, however, see any signs as though either Rome or England will\nstir hand or foot to meet us?  Can any step be pointed to as though\neither Church wished to make things easier for men holding the\nopinions held by the late Mr. Darwin, or by Mr. Herbert Spencer and\nProfessor Huxley?  How can those who accept evolution with any\nthoroughness accept such doctrines as the Incarnation or the\nRedemption with any but a quasi-allegorical and poetical\ninterpretation?  Can we conceivably accept these doctrines in the\nliteral sense in which the Church advances them?  And can the\nleaders of the Church be blind to the resistlessness of the current\nthat has set against those literal interpretations which she seems\nto hug more and more closely the more religious life is awakened at\nall?  The clergyman is wanted as supplementing the doctor and the\nlawyer in all civilised communities; these three keep watch on one\nanother, and prevent one another from becoming too powerful.  I, who\ndistrust the doctrinaire in science even more than the doctrinaire\nin religion, should view with dismay the abolition of the Church of\nEngland, as knowing that a blatant bastard science would instantly\nstep into her shoes; but if some such deplorable consummation is to\nbe avoided in England, it can only be through more evident leaning\non the part of our clergy to such an interpretation of the Sacred\nHistory as the presence of a black and white Madonna almost side by\nside at Oropa appears to suggest.",
        "I fear that in these last paragraphs I may have trenched on\ndangerous ground, but it is not possible to go to such places as\nOropa without asking oneself what they mean and involve.  As for the\naverage Italian pilgrims, they do not appear to give the matter so\nmuch as a thought.  They love Oropa, and flock to it in thousands\nduring the summer; the President of the Administration assured me\nthat they lodged, after a fashion, as many as ten thousand pilgrims\non the 15th of last August.  It is astonishing how living the\nstatues are to these people, and how the wicked are upbraided and\nthe good applauded.  At Varallo, since I took the photographs I\npublished in my book “Ex Voto,” an angry pilgrim has smashed the\nnose of the dwarf in Tabachetti’s Journey to Calvary, for no other\nreason than inability to restrain his indignation against one who\nwas helping to inflict pain on Christ.  It is the real hair and the\npainting up to nature that does this.  Here at Oropa I found a paper\non the floor of the Sposalizio Chapel, which ran as follows:-",
        "“By the grace of God and the will of the administrative chapter of\nthis sanctuary, there have come here to work — —, mason — —,\ncarpenter, and — — plumber, all of Chiavazza, on the twenty-first\nday of January 1886, full of cold (pieni di freddo).",
        "“They write these two lines to record their visit.  They pray the\nBlessed Virgin that she will maintain them safe and sound from\neverything equivocal that may befall them (sempre sani e salvi da\nogni equivoco li possa accadere).  Oh, farewell!  We reverently\nsalute all the present statues, and especially the Blessed Virgin,\nand the reader.”",
        "Through the Universal Review, I suppose, all its readers are to\nconsider themselves saluted; at any rate, these good fellows, in the\neffusiveness of their hearts, actually wrote the above in pencil.  I\nwas sorely tempted to steal it, but, after copying it, left it in\nthe Chief Priest’s hands instead.",
        "Having been told by Mr. Fortescue, of the British Museum, that there\nwere some chapels at Saas-Fee which bore analogy to those at\nVarallo, described in my book “Ex Voto,” {12} I went to Saas during\nthis last summer, and venture now to lay my conclusions before the\nreader.",
        "The chapels are fifteen in number, and lead up to a larger and\nsingularly graceful one, rather more than half-way between Saas and\nSaas-Fee.  This is commonly but wrongly called the chapel of St.\nJoseph, for it is dedicated to the Virgin, and its situation is of\nsuch extreme beauty—the great Fee glaciers showing through the open\nportico—that it is in itself worth a pilgrimage.  It is surrounded\nby noble larches and overhung by rock; in front of the portico there\nis a small open space covered with grass, and a huge larch, the stem\nof which is girt by a rude stone seat.  The portico itself contains\nseats for worshippers, and a pulpit from which the preacher’s voice\ncan reach the many who must stand outside.  The walls of the inner\nchapel are hung with votive pictures, some of them very quaint and\npleasing, and not overweighted by those qualities that are usually\ndubbed by the name of artistic merit.  Innumerable wooden and waxen\nrepresentations of arms, legs, eyes, ears and babies tell of the\ncures that have been effected during two centuries of devotion, and\ncan hardly fail to awaken a kindly sympathy with the long dead and\nforgotten folks who placed them where they are.",
        "The main interest, however, despite the extreme loveliness of the\nSt. Mary’s Chapel, centres rather in the small and outwardly\nunimportant oratories (if they should be so called) that lead up to\nit.  These begin immediately with the ascent from the level ground\non which the village of Saas-im-Grund is placed, and contain scenes\nin the history of the Redemption, represented by rude but spirited\nwooden figures, each about two feet high, painted, gilt, and\nrendered as life-like in all respects as circumstances would permit.\nThe figures have suffered a good deal from neglect, and are still\nnot a little misplaced.  With the assistance, however, of the Rev.\nE. J. Selwyn, English Chaplain at Saas-im-Grund, I have been able to\nreplace many of them in their original positions, as indicated by\nthe parts of the figures that are left rough-hewn and unpainted.\nThey vary a good deal in interest, and can be easily sneered at by\nthose who make a trade of sneering.  Those, on the other hand, who\nremain unsophisticated by overmuch art-culture will find them full\nof character in spite of not a little rudeness of execution, and\nwill be surprised at coming across such works in a place so remote\nfrom any art-centre as Saas must have been at the time these chapels\nwere made.  It will be my business therefore to throw what light I\ncan upon the questions how they came to be made at all, and who was\nthe artist who designed them.",
        "The only documentary evidence consists in a chronicle of the valley\nof Saas written in the early years of this century by the Rev. Peter\nJos. Ruppen, and published at Sion in 1851.  This work makes\nfrequent reference to a manuscript by the Rev. Peter Joseph Clemens\nLommatter, cure of Saas-Fee from 1738 to 1751, which has\nunfortunately been lost, so that we have no means of knowing how\nclosely it was adhered to.  The Rev. Jos. Ant. Ruppen, the present\nexcellent cure of Saas-im-Grund, assures me that there is no\nreference to the Saas-Fee oratories in the “Actes de l’Eglise” at\nSaas, which I understand go a long way back; but I have not seen\nthese myself.  Practically, then, we have no more documentary\nevidence than is to be found in the published chronicle above\nreferred to.",
        "We there find it stated that the large chapel, commonly, but as\nabove explained, wrongly called St. Joseph’s, was built in 1687, and\nenlarged by subscription in 1747.  These dates appear on the\nbuilding itself, and are no doubt accurate.  The writer adds that\nthere was no actual edifice on this site before the one now existing\nwas built, but there was a miraculous picture of the Virgin placed\nin a mural niche, before which the pious herdsmen and devout\ninhabitants of the valley worshipped under the vault of heaven. {13}\nA miraculous (or miracle-working) picture was always more or less\nrare and important; the present site, therefore, seems to have been\nlong one of peculiar sanctity.  Possibly the name Fee may point to\nstill earlier Pagan mysteries on the same site.",
        "As regards the fifteen small chapels, the writer says they\nillustrate the fifteen mysteries of the Psalter, and were built in\n1709, each householder of the Saas-Fee contributing one chapel.  He\nadds that Heinrich Andenmatten, afterwards a brother of the Society\nof Jesus, was an especial benefactor or promoter of the undertaking.\nOne of the chapels, the Ascension (No. 12 of the series), has the\ndate 1709 painted on it; but there is no date on any other chapel,\nand there seems no reason why this should be taken as governing the\nwhole series.",
        "Over and above this, there exists in Saas a tradition, as I was told\nimmediately on my arrival, by an English visitor, that the chapels\nwere built in consequence of a flood, but I have vainly endeavoured\nto trace this story to an indigenous source.",
        "The internal evidence of the wooden figures themselves—nothing\nanalogous to which, it should be remembered, can be found in the\nchapel of 1687—points to a much earlier date.  I have met with no\nschool of sculpture belonging to the early part of the eighteenth\ncentury to which they can be plausibly assigned; and the supposition\nthat they are the work of some unknown local genius who was not led\nup to and left no successors may be dismissed, for the work is too\nscholarly to have come from any one but a trained sculptor.  I refer\nof course to those figures which the artist must be supposed to have\nexecuted with his own hand, as, for example, the central figure of\nthe Crucifixion group and those of the Magdalene and St. John.  The\ngreater number of the figures were probably, as was suggested to me\nby Mr. Ranshaw, of Lowth, executed by a local woodcarver from models\nin clay and wax furnished by the artist himself.  Those who examine\nthe play of line in the hair, mantle, and sleeve of the Magdalene in\nthe Crucifixion group, and contrast it with the greater part of the\nremaining draperies, will find little hesitation in concluding that\nthis was the case, and will ere long readily distinguish the two\nhands from which the figures have mainly come.  I say “mainly,\"\nbecause there is at least one other sculptor who may well have\nbelonged to the year 1709, but who fortunately has left us little.\nExamples of his work may perhaps be seen in the nearest villain with\na big hat in the Flagellation chapel, and in two cherubs in the\nAssumption of the Virgin.",
        "We may say, then, with some certainty, that the designer was a\ncultivated and practised artist.  We may also not less certainly\nconclude that he was of Flemish origin, for the horses in the\nJourney to Calvary and Crucifixion chapels, where alone there are\nany horses at all, are of Flemish breed, with no trace of the Arab\nblood adopted by Gaudenzio at Varallo.  The character, moreover, of\nthe villains is Northern—of the Quentin Matsys, Martin Schongauer\ntype, rather than Italian; the same sub-Rubensesque feeling which is\napparent in more than one chapel at Varallo is not less evident\nhere—especially in the Journey to Calvary and Crucifixion chapels.\nThere can hardly, therefore, be a doubt that the artist was a\nFleming who had worked for several years in Italy.",
        "It is also evident that he had Tabachetti’s work at Varallo well in\nhis mind.  For not only does he adopt certain details of costume (I\nrefer particularly to the treatment of soldiers’ tunics) which are\npeculiar to Tabachetti at Varallo, but whenever he treats a subject\nwhich Tabachetti had treated at Varallo, as in the Flagellation,\nCrowning with Thorns, and Journey to Calvary chapels, the work at\nSaas is evidently nothing but a somewhat modified abridgement of\nthat at Varallo.  When, however, as in the Annunciation, the\nNativity, the Crucifixion, and other chapels, the work at Varallo is\nby another than Tabachetti, no allusion is made to it.  The Saas\nartist has Tabachetti’s Varallo work at his finger-ends, but betrays\nno acquaintance whatever with Gaudenzio Ferrari, Gio. Ant. Paracca,\nor Giovanni D’Enrico.",
        "Even, moreover, when Tabachetti’s work at Varallo is being most\nobviously drawn from, as in the Journey to Calvary chapel, the Saas\nversion differs materially from that at Varallo, and is in some\nrespects an improvement on it.  The idea of showing other horsemen\nand followers coming up from behind, whose heads can be seen over\nthe crown of the interposing hill, is singularly effective as\nsuggesting a number of others that are unseen, nor can I conceive\nthat any one but the original designer would follow Tabachetti’s\nVarallo design with as much closeness as it has been followed here,\nand yet make such a brilliantly successful modification.  The\nstumbling, again, of one horse (a detail almost hidden, according to\nTabachetti’s wont) is a touch which Tabachetti himself might add,\nbut which no Saas woodcarver who was merely adapting from a\nreminiscence of Tabachetti’s Varallo chapel would be likely to\nintroduce.  These considerations have convinced me that the designer\nof the chapels at Saas is none other than Tabachetti himself, who,\nas has been now conclusively shown, was a native of Dinant, in\nBelgium.",
        "The Saas chronicler, indeed, avers that the chapels were not built\ntill 1709—a statement apparently corroborated by a date now visible\non one chapel; but we must remember that the chronicler did not\nwrite until a century or so later than 1709, and though, indeed, his\nstatement may have been taken from the lost earlier manuscript of\n1738, we know nothing about this either one way or the other.  The\nwriter may have gone by the still existing 1709 on the Ascension\nchapel, whereas this date may in fact have referred to a\nrestoration, and not to an original construction.  There is nothing,\nas I have said, in the choice of the chapel on which the date\nappears, to suggest that it was intended to govern the others.  I\nhave explained that the work is isolated and exotic.  It is by one\nin whom Flemish and Italian influences are alike equally\npredominant; by one who was saturated with Tabachetti’s Varallo\nwork, and who can improve upon it, but over whom the other Varallo\nsculptors have no power.  The style of the work is of the sixteenth\nand not of the eighteenth century—with a few obvious exceptions\nthat suit the year 1709 exceedingly well.  Against such\nconsiderations as these, a statement made at the beginning of this\ncentury referring to a century earlier, and a promiscuous date upon\none chapel, can carry but little weight.  I shall assume, therefore,\nhenceforward, that we have here groups designed in a plastic\nmaterial by Tabachetti, and reproduced in wood by the best local\nwood-sculptor available, with the exception of a few figures cut by\nthe artist himself.",
        "We ask, then, at what period in his life did Tabachetti design these\nchapels, and what led to his coming to such an out-of-the-way place\nas Saas at all?  We should remember that, according both to Fassola\nand Torrotti (writing in 1671 and 1686 respectively), Tabachetti\n{14} became insane about the year 1586 or early in 1587, after\nhaving just begun the Salutation chapel.  I have explained in “Ex\nVoto” that I do not believe this story.  I have no doubt that\nTabachetti was declared to be mad, but I believe this to have been\ndue to an intrigue, set on foot in order to get a foreign artist out\nof the way, and to secure the Massacre of the Innocents chapel, at\nthat precise time undertaken, for Gio. Ant. Paracca, who was an\nItalian.",
        "Or he may have been sacrificed in order to facilitate the return of\nthe workers in stucco whom he had superseded on the Sacro Monte.  He\nmay have been goaded into some imprudence which was seized upon as a\npretext for shutting him up; at any rate, the fact that when in 1587\nhe inherited his father’s property at Dinant, his trustee (he being\nexpressly stated to be “expatrie”) was “datif,” “dativus,” appointed\nnot by himself but by the court, lends colour to the statement that\nhe was not his own master at the time; for in later kindred deeds,\nnow at Namur, he appoints his own trustee.  I suppose, then, that\nTabachetti was shut up in a madhouse at Varallo for a considerable\ntime, during which I can find no trace of him, but that eventually\nhe escaped or was released.",
        "Whether he was a fugitive, or whether he was let out from prison, he\nwould in either case, in all reasonable probability, turn his face\nhomeward.  If he was escaping, he would make immediately for the\nSavoy frontier, within which Saas then lay.  He would cross the\nBaranca above Fobello, coming down on to Ponte Grande in the Val\nAnzasca.  He would go up the Val Anzasca to Macugnaga, and over the\nMonte Moro, which would bring him immediately to Saas.  Saas,\ntherefore, is the nearest and most natural place for him to make\nfor, if he were flying from Varallo, and here I suppose him to have\nhalted.",
        "It so happened that on the 9th of September, 1589, there was one of\nthe three great outbreaks of the Mattmark See that have from time to\ntime devastated the valley of Saas. {15}  It is probable that the\nchapels were decided upon in consequence of some grace shown by the\nmiraculous picture of the Virgin, which had mitigated a disaster\noccurring so soon after the anniversary of her own Nativity.\nTabachetti, arriving at this juncture, may have offered to undertake\nthem if the Saas people would give him an asylum.  Here, at any\nrate, I suppose him to have stayed till some time in 1590, probably\nthe second half of it, his design of eventually returning home, if\nhe ever entertained it, being then interrupted by a summons to Crea\nnear Casale, where I believe him to have worked with a few brief\ninterruptions thenceforward for little if at all short of half a\ncentury, or until about the year 1640.  I admit, however, that the\nevidence for assigning him so long a life rests solely on the\nsupposed identity of the figure known as “Il Vecchietto,” in the\nVarallo Descent from the Cross chapel, with the portrait of\nTabachetti himself in the Ecce Homo chapel, also at Varallo.",
        "I find additional reason for thinking the chapels owe their origin\nto the inundation of September 9, 1589, in the fact that the 8th of\nSeptember is made a day of pilgrimage to the Saas-Fee chapels\nthroughout the whole valley of Saas.  It is true the 8th of\nSeptember is the festival of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, so\nthat under any circumstances this would be a great day, but the fact\nthat not only the people of Saas, but the whole valley down to Visp,\nflock to this chapel on the 8th of September, points to the belief\nthat some special act of grace on the part of the Virgin was\nvouchsafed on this day in connection with this chapel.  A belief\nthat it was owing to the intervention of St. Mary of Fee that the\ninundation was not attended with loss of life would be very likely\nto lead to the foundation of a series of chapels leading up to the\nplace where her miraculous picture was placed, and to the more\nspecial celebration of her Nativity in connection with this spot\nthroughout the valley of Saas.  I have discussed the subject with\nthe Rev. Jos. Ant. Ruppen, and he told me he thought the fact that\nthe great fete of the year in connection with the Saas-Fee chapels\nwas on the 8th of September pointed rather strongly to the\nsupposition that there was a connection between these and the\nrecorded flood of September 9, 1589.",
        "Turning to the individual chapels they are as follows:-",
        "1.  The Annunciation.  The treatment here presents no more analogy\nto that of the same subject at Varallo than is inevitable in the\nnature of the subject.  The Annunciation figures at Varallo have\nproved to be mere draped dummies with wooden heads; Tabachetti, even\nthough he did the heads, which he very likely did, would take no\ninterest in the Varallo work with the same subject.  The\nAnnunciation, from its very simplicity as well as from the\ntranscendental nature of the subject, is singularly hard to treat,\nand the work here, whatever it may once have been, is now no longer\nremarkable.",
        "2.  The Salutation of Mary by Elizabeth.  This group, again, bears\nno analogy to the Salutation chapel at Varallo, in which\nTabachetti’s share was so small that it cannot be considered as in\nany way his.  It is not to be expected, therefore, that the Saas\nchapel should follow the Varallo one.  The figures, four in number,\nare pleasing and well arranged.  St. Joseph, St. Elizabeth, and St.\nZacharias are all talking at once.  The Virgin is alone silent.",
        "3.  The Nativity is much damaged and hard to see.  The treatment\nbears no analogy to that adopted by Gaudenzio Ferrari at Varallo.\nThere is one pleasing young shepherd standing against the wall, but\nsome figures have no doubt (as in others of the chapels)\ndisappeared, and those that remain have been so shifted from their\noriginal positions that very little idea can be formed of what the\ngroup was like when Tabachetti left it.",
        "4.  The Purification.  I can hardly say why this chapel should\nremind me, as it does, of the Circumcision chapel at Varallo, for\nthere are more figures here than space at Varallo will allow.  It\ncannot be pretended that any single figure is of extraordinary\nmerit, but amongst them they tell their story with excellent effect.\nTwo, those of St. Joseph and St. Anna (?), that doubtless were once\nmore important factors in the drama, are now so much in corners near\nthe window that they can hardly be seen.",
        "5.  The Dispute in the Temple.  This subject is not treated at\nVarallo.  Here at Saas there are only six doctors now; whether or no\nthere were originally more cannot be determined.",
        "6.  The Agony in the Garden.  Tabachetti had no chapel with this\nsubject at Varallo, and there is no resemblance between the Saas\nchapel and that by D’Enrico.  The figures are no doubt approximately\nin their original positions, but I have no confidence that I have\nrearranged them correctly.  They were in such confusion when I first\nsaw them that the Rev. E. J. Selwyn and myself determined to\nrearrange them.  They have doubtless been shifted more than once\nsince Tabachetti left them.  The sleeping figures are all good.  St.\nJames is perhaps a little prosaic.  One Roman soldier who is coming\ninto the garden with a lantern, and motioning silence with his hand,\ndoes duty for the others that are to follow him.  I should think\nmore than one of these figures is actually carved in wood by\nTabachetti, allowance being made for the fact that he was working in\na material with which he was not familiar, and which no sculptor of\nthe highest rank has ever found congenial.",
        "7.  The Flagellation.  Tabachetti has a chapel with this subject at\nVarallo, and the Saas group is obviously a descent with modification\nfrom his work there.  The figure of Christ is so like the one at\nVarallo that I think it must have been carved by Tabachetti himself.\nThe man with the hooked nose, who at Varallo is stooping to bind his\nrods, is here upright:  it was probably the intention to emphasise\nhim in the succeeding scenes as well as this, in the same way as he\nhas been emphasised at Varallo, but his nose got pared down in the\ncutting of later scenes, and could not easily be added to.  The man\nbinding Christ to the column at Varallo is repeated (longo\nintervallo) here, and the whole work is one inspired by that at\nVarallo, though no single figure except that of the Christ is\nadhered to with any very great closeness.  I think the nearer\nmalefactor, with a goitre, and wearing a large black hat, is either\nan addition of the year 1709, or was done by the journeyman of the\nlocal sculptor who carved the greater number of the figures.  The\nman stooping down to bind his rods can hardly be by the same hand as\neither of the two black-hatted malefactors, but it is impossible to\nspeak with certainty.  The general effect of the chapel is\nexcellent, if we consider the material in which it is executed, and\nthe rudeness of the audience to whom it addresses itself.",
        "8.  The Crowning with Thorns.  Here again the inspiration is derived\nfrom Tabachetti’s Crowning with Thorns at Varallo.  The Christs in\nthe two chapels are strikingly alike, and the general effect is that\nof a residuary impression left in the mind of one who had known the\nVarallo Flagellation exceedingly well.",
        "9.  Sta. Veronica.  This and the next succeeding chapels are the\nmost important of the series.  Tabachetti’s Journey to Calvary at\nVarallo is again the source from which the present work was taken,\nbut, as I have already said, it has been modified in reproduction.\nMount Calvary is still shown, as at Varallo, towards the left-hand\ncorner of the work, but at Saas it is more towards the middle than\nat Varallo, so that horsemen and soldiers may be seen coming up\nbehind it—a stroke that deserves the name of genius none the less\nfor the manifest imperfection with which it has been carried into\nexecution.  There are only three horses fully shown, and one partly\nshown.  They are all of the heavy Flemish type adopted by Tabachetti\nat Varallo.  The man kicking the fallen Christ and the goitred man\n(with the same teeth missing), who are so conspicuous in the Varallo\nJourney to Calvary, reappear here, only the kicking man has much\nless nose than at Varallo, probably because (as explained) the nose\ngot whittled away and could not be whittled back again.  I observe\nthat the kind of lapelled tunic which Tabachetti, and only\nTabachetti, adopts at Varallo, is adopted for the centurion in this\nchapel, and indeed throughout the Saas chapels this particular form\nof tunic is the most usual for a Roman soldier.  The work is still a\nvery striking one, notwithstanding its translation into wood and the\ndecay into which it has been allowed to fall; nor can it fail to\nimpress the visitor who is familiar with this class of art as coming\nfrom a man of extraordinary dramatic power and command over the\nalmost impossible art of composing many figures together effectively\nin all-round sculpture.  Whether all the figures are even now as\nTabachetti left them I cannot determine, but Mr. Selwyn has restored\nSimon the Cyrenian to the position in which he obviously ought to\nstand, and between us we have got the chapel into something more\nlike order.",
        "10.  The Crucifixion.  This subject was treated at Varallo not by\nTabachetti but by Gaudenzio Ferrari.  It confirms therefore my\nopinion as to the designer of the Saas chapels to find in them no\ntrace of the Varallo Crucifixion, while the kind of tunic which at\nVarallo is only found in chapels wherein Tabachetti worked again\nappears here.  The work is in a deplorable state of decay.  Mr.\nSelwyn has greatly improved the arrangement of the figures, but even\nnow they are not, I imagine, quite as Tabachetti left them.  The\nfigure of Christ is greatly better in technical execution than that\nof either of the two thieves; the folds of the drapery alone will\nshow this even to an unpractised eye.  I do not think there can be a\ndoubt but that Tabachetti cut this figure himself, as also those of\nthe Magdalene and St. John, who stand at the foot of the cross.  The\nthieves are coarsely executed, with no very obvious distinction\nbetween the penitent and the impenitent one, except that there is a\nfiend painted on the ceiling over the impenitent thief.  The one\nhorse introduced into the composition is again of the heavy Flemish\ntype adopted by Tabachetti at Varallo.  There is great difference in\nthe care with which the folds on the several draperies have been\ncut, some being stiff and poor enough, while others are done very\nsufficiently.  In spite of smallness of scale, ignoble material,\ndisarrangement and decay, the work is still striking.",
        "11.  The Resurrection.  There being no chapel at Varallo with any of\nthe remaining subjects treated at Saas, the sculptor has struck out\na line for himself.  The Christ in the Resurrection Chapel is a\ncarefully modelled figure, and if better painted might not be\nineffective.  Three soldiers, one sleeping, alone remain.  There\nwere probably other figures that have been lost.  The sleeping\nsoldier is very pleasing.",
        "12.  The Ascension is not remarkably interesting; the Christ appears\nto be, but perhaps is not, a much more modern figure than the rest.",
        "18.  The Descent of the Holy Ghost.  Some of the figures along the\nend wall are very good, and were, I should imagine, cut by\nTabachetti himself.  Those against the two side walls are not so\nwell cut.",
        "14.  The Assumption of the Virgin Mary.  The two large cherubs here\nare obviously by a later hand, and the small ones are not good.  The\nfigure of the Virgin herself is unexceptionable.  There were\ndoubtless once other figures of the Apostles which have disappeared;\nof these a single St. Peter (?), so hidden away in a corner near the\nwindow that it can only be seen with difficulty, is the sole\nsurvivor.",
        "15.  The Coronation of the Virgin is of later date, and has probably\nsuperseded an earlier work.  It can hardly be by the designer of the\nother chapels of the series.  Perhaps Tabachetti had to leave for\nCrea before all the chapels at Saas were finished.",
        "Lastly, we have the larger chapel dedicated to St. Mary, which\ncrowns the series.  Here there is nothing of more than common\nartistic interest, unless we except the stone altar mentioned in\nRuppen’s chronicle.  This is of course classical in style, and is, I\nshould think, very good.",
        "Once more I must caution the reader against expecting to find\nhighly-finished gems of art in the chapels I have been describing.\nA wooden figure not more than two feet high clogged with many coats\nof paint can hardly claim to be taken very seriously, and even those\nfew that were cut by Tabachetti himself were not meant to have\nattention concentrated on themselves alone.  As mere wood-carving\nthe Saas-Fee chapels will not stand comparison, for example, with\nthe triptych of unknown authorship in the Church of St. Anne at\nGliss, close to Brieg.  But, in the first place, the work at Gliss\nis worthy of Holbein himself:  I know no wood-carving that can so\nrivet the attention; moreover it is coloured with water-colour and\nnot oil, so that it is tinted, not painted; and, in the second\nplace, the Gliss triptych belongs to a date (1519) when artists held\nneither time nor impressionism as objects, and hence, though greatly\nbetter than the Saas-Fee chapels as regards a certain Japanese\ncuriousness of finish and naivete of literal transcription, it\ncannot even enter the lists with the Saas work as regards elan and\ndramatic effectiveness.  The difference between the two classes of\nwork is much that between, say, John Van Eyck or Memling and Rubens\nor Rembrandt, or, again, between Giovanni Bellini and Tintoretto;\nthe aims of the one class of work are incompatible with those of the\nother.  Moreover, in the Gliss triptych the intention of the\ndesigner is carried out (whether by himself or no) with admirable\nskill; whereas at Saas the wisdom of the workman is rather of Ober-\nAmmergau than of the Egyptians, and the voice of the poet is not a\nlittle drowned in that of his mouthpiece.  If, however, the reader\nwill bear in mind these somewhat obvious considerations, and will\nalso remember the pathetic circumstances under which the chapels\nwere designed—for Tabachetti when he reached Saas was no doubt\nshattered in body and mind by his four years’ imprisonment—he will\nprobably be not less attracted to them than I observed were many of\nthe visitors both at Saas-Grund and Saas-Fee with whom I had the\npleasure of examining them.",
        "I will now run briefly through the other principal works in the\nneighbourhood to which I think the reader would be glad to have his\nattention directed.",
        "At Saas-Fee itself the main altar-piece is without interest, as also\none with a figure of St. Sebastian.  The Virgin and Child above the\nremaining altar are, so far as I remember them, very good, and\ngreatly superior to the smaller figures of the same altar-piece.",
        "At Almagel, an hour’s walk or so above Saas-Grund—a village, the\nname of which, like those of the Alphubel, the Monte Moro, and more\nthan one other neighbouring site, is supposed to be of Saracenic\norigin—the main altar-piece represents a female saint with folded\narms being beheaded by a vigorous man to the left.  These two\nfigures are very good.  There are two somewhat inferior elders to\nthe right, and the composition is crowned by the Assumption of the\nVirgin.  I like the work, but have no idea who did it.  Two bishops\nflanking the composition are not so good.  There are two other\naltars in the church:  the right-hand one has some pleasing figures,\nnot so the left-hand.",
        "In St. Joseph’s Chapel, on the mule-road between Saas-Grund and\nSaas-Fee, the St. Joseph and the two children are rather nice.  In\nthe churches and chapels which I looked into between Saas and\nStalden, I saw many florid extravagant altar-pieces, but nothing\nthat impressed me favourably.",
        "In the parish church at Saas-Grund there are two altar-pieces which\ndeserve attention.  In the one over the main altar the arrangement\nof the Last Supper in a deep recess half-way up the composition is\nvery pleasing and effective; in that above the right-hand altar of\nthe two that stand in the body of the church there are a number of\nround lunettes, about eight inches in diameter, each containing a\nsmall but spirited group of wooden figures.  I have lost my notes on\nthese altar-pieces and can only remember that the main one has been\nrestored, and now belongs to two different dates, the earlier date\nbeing, I should imagine, about 1670.  A similar treatment of the\nLast Supper may be found near Brieg in the church of Naters, and no\ndoubt the two altar-pieces are by the same man.  There are, by the\nway, two very ambitious altars on either side the main arch leading\nto the chance in the church at Naters, of which the one on the south\nside contains obvious reminiscences of Gaudenzio Ferrari’s Sta.\nMaria frescoes at Varallo; but none of the four altar-pieces in the\ntwo transepts tempted me to give them much attention.  As regards\nthe smaller altar-piece at Saas-Grund, analogous work may be found\nat Cravagliana, half-way between Varallo and Fobello, but this last\nhas suffered through the inveterate habit which Italians have of\nshowing their hatred towards the enemies of Christ by mutilating the\nfigures that represent them.  Whether the Saas work is by a\nValsesian artist who came over to Switzerland, or whether the\nCravagliana work is by a Swiss who had come to Italy, I cannot say\nwithout further consideration and closer examination than I have\nbeen able to give.  The altar-pieces of Mairengo, Chiggiogna, and, I\nam told, Lavertezzo, all in the Canton Ticino, are by a Swiss or\nGerman artist who has migrated southward; but the reverse migration\nwas equally common.",
        "Being in the neighbourhood, and wishing to assure myself whether the\nsculptor of the Saas-Fee chapels had or had not come lower down the\nvalley, I examined every church and village which I could hear of as\ncontaining anything that might throw light on this point.  I was\nthus led to Vispertimenen, a village some three hours above either\nVisp or Stalden.  It stands very high, and is an almost untouched\nexample of a medieval village.  The altar-piece of the main church\nis even more floridly ambitious in its abundance of carving and\ngilding than the many other ambitious altar-pieces with which the\nCanton Valais abounds.  The Apostles are receiving the Holy Ghost on\nthe first storey of the composition, and they certainly are\nreceiving it with an overjoyed alacrity and hilarious ecstasy of\nallegria spirituale which it would not be easy to surpass.  Above\nthe village, reaching almost to the limits beyond which there is no\ncultivation, there stands a series of chapels like those I have been\ndescribing at Saas-Fee, only much larger and more ambitious.  They\nare twelve in number, including the church that crowns the series.\nThe figures they contain are of wood (so I was assured, but I did\nnot go inside the chapels):  they are life-size, and in some chapels\nthere are as many as a dozen figures.  I should think they belonged\nto the later half of the last century, and here, one would say,\nsculpture touches the ground; at least, it is not easy to see how\ncheap exaggeration can sink an art more deeply.  The only things\nthat at all pleased me were a smiling donkey and an ecstatic cow in\nthe Nativity chapel.  Those who are not allured by the prospect of\nseeing perhaps the very worst that can be done in its own line, need\nnot be at the pains of climbing up to Vispertimenen.  Those, on the\nother hand, who may find this sufficient inducement will not be\ndisappointed, and they will enjoy magnificent views of the Weisshorn\nand the mountains near the Dom.",
        "I have already referred to the triptych at Gliss.  This is figured\nin Wolf’s work on Chamonix and the Canton Valais, but a larger and\nclearer reproduction of such an extraordinary work is greatly to be\ndesired.  The small wooden statues above the triptych, as also those\nabove its modern companion in the south transept, are not less\nadmirable than the triptych itself.  I know of no other like work in\nwood, and have no clue whatever as to who the author can have been\nbeyond the fact that the work is purely German and eminently\nHolbeinesque in character.",
        "I was told of some chapels at Rarogne, five or six miles lower down\nthe valley than Visp.  I examined them, and found they had been\nstripped of their figures.  The few that remained satisfied me that\nwe have had no loss.  Above Brieg there are two other like series of\nchapels.  I examined the higher and more promising of the two, but\nfound not one single figure left.  I was told by my driver that the\nother series, close to the Pont Napoleon on the Simplon road, had\nbeen also stripped of its figures, and, there being a heavy storm at\nthe time, have taken his word for it that this was so.",
        "Three well-known writers, Professor Max Muller, Professor Mivart,\nand Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace have lately maintained that though the\ntheory of descent with modification accounts for the development of\nall vegetable life, and of all animals lower than man, yet that man\ncannot—not at least in respect of the whole of his nature—be held\nto have descended from any animal lower than himself, inasmuch as\nnone lower than man possesses even the germs of language.  Reason,\nit is contended—more especially by Professor Max Muller in his\n\"Science of Thought,” to which I propose confining our attention\nthis evening—is so inseparably connected with language, that the\ntwo are in point of fact identical; hence it is argued that, as the\nlower animals have no germs of language, they can have no germs of\nreason, and the inference is drawn that man cannot be conceived as\nhaving derived his own reasoning powers and command of language\nthrough descent from beings in which no germ of either can be found.\nThe relations therefore between thought and language, interesting in\nthemselves, acquire additional importance from the fact of their\nhaving become the battle-ground between those who say that the\ntheory of descent breaks down with man, and those who maintain that\nwe are descended from some ape-like ancestor long since extinct.",
        "The contention of those who refuse to admit man unreservedly into\nthe scheme of evolution is comparatively recent.  The great\npropounders of evolution, Buffon, Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck—not to\nmention a score of others who wrote at the close of the last and\nearly part of this present century—had no qualms about admitting\nman into their system.  They have been followed in this respect by\nthe late Mr. Charles Darwin, and by the greatly more influential\npart of our modern biologists, who hold that whatever loss of\ndignity we may incur through being proved to be of humble origin, is\ncompensated by the credit we may claim for having advanced ourselves\nto such a high pitch of civilisation; this bids us expect still\nfurther progress, and glorifies our descendants more than it abases\nour ancestors.  But to whichever view we may incline on sentimental\ngrounds the fact remains that, while Charles Darwin declared\nlanguage to form no impassable barrier between man and the lower\nanimals, Professor Max Muller calls it the Rubicon which no brute\ndare cross, and deduces hence the conclusion that man cannot have\ndescended from an unknown but certainly speechless ape.",
        "It may perhaps be expected that I should begin a lecture on the\nrelations between thought and language with some definition of both\nthese things; but thought, as Sir William Grove said of motion, is a\nphenomenon “so obvious to simple apprehension, that to define it\nwould make it more obscure.” {17}  Definitions are useful where\nthings are new to us, but they are superfluous about those that are\nalready familiar, and mischievous, so far as they are possible at\nall, in respect of all those things that enter so profoundly and\nintimately into our being that in them we must either live or bear\nno life.  To vivisect the more vital processes of thought is to\nsuspend, if not to destroy them; for thought can think about\neverything more healthily and easily than about itself.  It is like\nits instrument the brain, which knows nothing of any injuries\ninflicted upon itself.  As regards what is new to us, a definition\nwill sometimes dilute a difficulty, and help us to swallow that\nwhich might choke us undiluted; but to define when we have once well\nswallowed is to unsettle, rather than settle, our digestion.\nDefinitions, again, are like steps cut in a steep slope of ice, or\nshells thrown on to a greasy pavement; they give us foothold, and\nenable us to advance, but when we are at our journey’s end we want\nthem no longer.  Again, they are useful as mental fluxes, and as\nhelping us to fuse new ideas with our older ones.  They present us\nwith some tags and ends of ideas that we have already mastered, on\nto which we can hitch our new ones; but to multiply them in respect\nof such a matter as thought, is like scratching the bite of a gnat;\nthe more we scratch the more we want to scratch; the more we define\nthe more we shall have to go on defining the words we have used in\nour definitions, and shall end by setting up a serious mental raw in\nthe place of a small uneasiness that was after all quite endurable.\nWe know too well what thought is, to be able to know that we know\nit, and I am persuaded there is no one in this room but understands\nwhat is meant by thought and thinking well enough for all the\npurposes of this discussion.  Whoever does not know this without\nwords will not learn it for all the words and definitions that are\nlaid before him.  The more, indeed, he hears, the more confused he\nwill become.  I shall, therefore, merely premise that I use the word\n\"thought” in the same sense as that in which it is generally used by\npeople who say that they think this or that.  At any rate, it will\nbe enough if I take Professor Max Muller’s own definition, and say\nthat its essence consists in a bringing together of mental images\nand ideas with deductions therefrom, and with a corresponding power\nof detaching them from one another.  Hobbes, the Professor tells us,\nmaintained this long ago, when he said that all our thinking\nconsists of addition and subtraction—that is to say, in bringing\nideas together, and in detaching them from one another.",
        "Turning from thought to language, we observe that the word is\nderived from the French langue, or tongue.  Strictly, therefore, it\nmeans tonguage.  This, however, takes account of but a very small\npart of the ideas that underlie the word.  It does, indeed, seize a\nfamiliar and important detail of everyday speech, though it may be\ndoubted whether the tongue has more to do with speaking than lips,\nteeth and throat have, but it makes no attempt at grasping and\nexpressing the essential characteristic of speech.  Anything done\nwith the tongue, even though it involve no speaking at all, is\ntonguage; eating oranges is as much tonguage as speech is.  The\nword, therefore, though it tells us in part how speech is effected,\nreveals nothing of that ulterior meaning which is nevertheless\ninseparable from any right use of the words either “speech” or\n\"language.”  It presents us with what is indeed a very frequent\nadjunct of conversation, but the use of written characters, or the\nfinger-speech of deaf mutes, is enough to show that the word\n\"language” omits all reference to the most essential characteristics\nof the idea, which in practice it nevertheless very sufficiently\npresents to us.  I hope presently to make it clear to you how and\nwhy it should do so.  The word is incomplete in the first place,\nbecause it omits all reference to the ideas which words, speech or\nlanguage are intended to convey, and there can be no true word\nwithout its actually or potentially conveying an idea.  Secondly, it\nmakes no allusion to the person or persons to whom the ideas are to\nbe conveyed.  Language is not language unless it not only expresses\nfairly definite and coherent ideas, but unless it also conveys these\nideas to some other living intelligent being, either man or brute,\nthat can understand them.  We may speak to a dog or horse, but not\nto a stone.  If we make pretence of doing so we are in reality only\ntalking to ourselves.  The person or animal spoken to is half the\nbattle—a half, moreover, which is essential to there being any\nbattle at all.  It takes two people to say a thing—a sayee as well\nas a sayer.  The one is as essential to any true saying as the\nother.  A. may have spoken, but if B. has not heard, there has been\nnothing said, and he must speak again.  True, the belief on A.’s\npart that he had a bona fide sayee in B., saves his speech qua him,\nbut it has been barren and left no fertile issue.  It has failed to\nfulfil the conditions of true speech, which involve not only that A.\nshould speak, but also that B. should hear.  True, again, we often\nspeak of loose, incoherent, indefinite language; but by doing so we\nimply, and rightly, that we are calling that language which is not\ntrue language at all.  People, again, sometimes talk to themselves\nwithout intending that any other person should hear them, but this\nis not well done, and does harm to those who practise it.  It is\nabnormal, whereas our concern is with normal and essential\ncharacteristics; we may, therefore, neglect both delirious\nbabblings, and the cases in which a person is regarding him or\nherself, as it were, from outside, and treating himself as though he\nwere some one else.",
        "Inquiring, then, what are the essentials, the presence of which\nconstitutes language, while their absence negatives it altogether,\nwe find that Professor Max Muller restricts them to the use of\ngrammatical articulate words that we can write or speak, and denies\nthat anything can be called language unless it can be written or\nspoken in articulate words and sentences.  He also denies that we\ncan think at all unless we do so in words; that is to say, in\nsentences with verbs and nouns.  Indeed he goes so far as to say\nupon his title-page that there can be no reason—which I imagine\ncomes to much the same thing as thought—without language, and no\nlanguage without reason.",
        "Against the assertion that there can be no true language without\nreason I have nothing to say.  But when the Professor says that\nthere can be no reason, or thought, without language, his opponents\ncontend, as it seems to me, with greater force, that thought, though\ninfinitely aided, extended and rendered definite through the\ninvention of words, nevertheless existed so fully as to deserve no\nother name thousands, if not millions of years before words had\nentered into it at all.  Words, they say, are a comparatively recent\ninvention, for the fuller expression of something that was already\nin existence.",
        "Children, they urge, are often evidently thinking and reasoning,\nthough they can neither think nor speak in words.  If you ask me to\ndefine reason, I answer as before that this can no more be done than\nthought, truth or motion can be defined.  Who has answered the\nquestion, “What is truth?”  Man cannot see God and live.  We cannot\ngo so far back upon ourselves as to undermine our own foundations;\nif we try to do we topple over, and lose that very reason about\nwhich we vainly try to reason.  If we let the foundations be, we\nknow well enough that they are there, and we can build upon them in\nall security.  We cannot, then, define reason nor crib, cabin and\nconfine it within a thus-far-shalt-thou-go-and-no-further.  Who can\ndefine heat or cold, or night or day?  Yet, so long as we hold fast\nby current consent, our chances of error for want of better\ndefinition are so small that no sensible person will consider them.\nIn like manner, if we hold by current consent or common sense, which\nis the same thing, about reason, we shall not find the want of an\nacademic definition hinder us from a reasonable conclusion.  What\nnurse or mother will doubt that her infant child can reason within\nthe limits of its own experience, long before it can formulate its\nreason in articulately worded thought?  If the development of any\ngiven animal is, as our opponents themselves admit, an epitome of\nthe history of its whole anterior development, surely the fact that\nspeech is an accomplishment acquired after birth so artificially\nthat children who have gone wild in the woods lose it if they have\never learned it, points to the conclusion that man’s ancestors only\nlearned to express themselves in articulate language at a\ncomparatively recent period.  Granted that they learn to think and\nreason continually the more and more fully for having done so, will\ncommon sense permit us to suppose that they could neither think nor\nreason at all till they could convey their ideas in words?",
        "I will return later to the reason of the lower animals, but will now\ndeal with the question what it is that constitutes language in the\nmost comprehensive sense that can be properly attached to it.  I\nhave said already that language to be language at all must not only\nconvey fairly definite coherent ideas, but must also convey them to\nanother living being.  Whenever two living beings have conveyed and\nreceived ideas, there has been language, whether looks or gestures\nor words spoken or written have been the vehicle by means of which\nthe ideas have travelled.  Some ideas crawl, some run, some fly; and\nin this case words are the wings they fly with, but they are only\nthe wings of thought or of ideas, they are not the thought or ideas\nthemselves, nor yet, as Professor Max Muller would have it,\ninseparably connected with them.  Last summer I was at an inn in\nSicily, where there was a deaf and dumb waiter; he had been born so,\nand could neither write nor read.  What had he to do with words or\nwords with him?  Are we to say, then, that this most active, amiable\nand intelligent fellow could neither think nor reason?  One day I\nhad had my dinner and had left the hotel.  A friend came in, and the\nwaiter saw him look for me in the place I generally occupied.  He\ninstantly came up to my friend, and moved his two forefingers in a\nway that suggested two people going about together, this meant “your\nfriend\"; he then moved his forefingers horizontally across his eyes,\nthis meant, “who wears divided spectacles\"; he made two fierce marks\nover the sockets of his eyes, this meant, “with the heavy eyebrows\";\nhe pulled his chin, and then touched his white shirt, to say that my\nbeard was white.  Having thus identified me as a friend of the\nperson he was speaking to, and as having a white beard, heavy\neyebrows, and wearing divided spectacles, he made a munching\nmovement with his jaws to say that I had had my dinner; and finally,\nby making two fingers imitate walking on the table, he explained\nthat I had gone away.  My friend, however, wanted to know how long I\nhad been gone, so he pulled out his watch and looked inquiringly.\nThe man at once slapped himself on the back, and held up the five\nfingers of one hand, to say it was five minutes ago.  All this was\ndone as rapidly as though it had been said in words; and my friend,\nwho knew the man well, understood without a moment’s hesitation.\nAre we to say that this man had no thought, nor reason, nor\nlanguage, merely because he had not a single word of any kind in his\nhead, which I am assured he had not; for, as I have said, he could\nnot speak with his fingers?  Is it possible to deny that a dialogue-\n-an intelligent conversation—had passed between the two men?  And\nif conversation, then surely it is technical and pedantic to deny\nthat all the essential elements of language were present.  The signs\nand tokens used by this poor fellow were as rude an instrument of\nexpression, in comparison with ordinary language, as going on one’s\nhands and knees is in comparison with walking, or as walking\ncompared with going by train; but it is as great an abuse of words\nto limit the word “language” to mere words written or spoken, as it\nwould be to limit the idea of a locomotive to a railway engine.\nThis may indeed pass in ordinary conversation, where so much must be\nsuppressed if talk is to be got through at all, but it is\nintolerable when we are inquiring about the relations between\nthought and words.  To do so is to let words become as it were the\nmasters of thought, on the ground that the fact of their being only\nits servants and appendages is so obvious that it is generally\nallowed to go without saying.",
        "If all that Professor Max Muller means to say is, that no animal but\nman commands an articulate language, with verbs and nouns, or is\never likely to command one (and I question whether in reality he\nmeans much more than this), no one will differ from him.  No dog or\nelephant has one word for bread, another for meat, and another for\nwater.  Yet, when we watch a cat or dog dreaming, as they often\nevidently do, can we doubt that the dream is accompanied by a mental\nimage of the thing that is dreamed of, much like what we experience\nin dreams ourselves, and much doubtless like the mental images which\nmust have passed through the mind of my deaf and dumb waiter?  If\nthey have mental images in sleep, can we doubt that waking, also,\nthey picture things before their mind’s eyes, and see them much as\nwe do—too vaguely indeed to admit of our thinking that we actually\nsee the objects themselves, but definitely enough for us to be able\nto recognise the idea or object of which we are thinking, and to\nconnect it with any other idea, object, or sign that we may think\nappropriate?",
        "Here we have touched on the second essential element of language.\nWe laid it down, that its essence lay in the communication of an\nidea from one intelligent being to another; but no ideas can be\ncommunicated at all except by the aid of conventions to which both\nparties have agreed to attach an identical meaning.  The agreement\nmay be very informal, and may pass so unconsciously from one\ngeneration to another that its existence can only be recognised by\nthe aid of much introspection, but it will be always there.  A\nsayer, a sayee, and a convention, no matter what, agreed upon\nbetween them as inseparably attached to the idea which it is\nintended to convey—these comprise all the essentials of language.\nWhere these are present there is language; where any of them are\nwanting there is no language.  It is not necessary for the sayee to\nbe able to speak and become a sayer.  If he comprehends the sayer—\nthat is to say, if he attaches the same meaning to a certain symbol\nas the sayer does—if he is a party to the bargain whereby it is\nagreed upon by both that any given symbol shall be attached\ninvariably to a certain idea, so that in virtue of the principle of\nassociated ideas the symbol shall never be present without\nimmediately carrying the idea along with it, then all the essentials\nof language are complied with, and there has been true speech though\nnever a word was spoken.",
        "The lower animals, therefore, many of them, possess a part of our\nown language, though they cannot speak it, and hence do not possess\nit so fully as we do.  They cannot say “bread,” “meat,” or “water,\"\nbut there are many that readily learn what ideas they ought to\nattach to these symbols when they are presented to them.  It is idle\nto say that a cat does not know what the cat’s-meat man means when\nhe says “meat.”  The cat knows just as well, neither better nor\nworse than the cat’s-meat man does, and a great deal better than I\nmyself understand much that is said by some very clever people at\nOxford or Cambridge.  There is more true employment of language,\nmore bona fide currency of speech, between a sayer and a sayee who\nunderstand each other, though neither of them can speak a word, than\nbetween a sayer who can speak with the tongues of men and of angels\nwithout being clear about his own meaning, and a sayee who can\nhimself utter the same words, but who is only in imperfect agreement\nwith the sayer as to the ideas which the words or symbols that he\nutters are intended to convey.  The nature of the symbols counts for\nnothing; the gist of the matter is in the perfect harmony between\nsayer and sayee as to the significance that is to be associated with\nthem.",
        "Professor Max Muller admits that we share with the lower animals\nwhat he calls an emotional language, and continues that we may call\ntheir interjections and imitations language if we like, as we speak\nof the language of the eyes or the eloquence of mute nature, but he\nwarns us against mistaking metaphor for fact.  It is indeed mere\nmetaphor to talk of the eloquence of mute nature, or the language of\nwinds and waves.  There is no intercommunion of mind with mind by\nmeans of a covenanted symbol; but it is only an apparent, not a\nreal, metaphor to say that two pairs of eyes have spoken when they\nhave signalled to one another something which they both understand.\nA schoolboy at home for the holidays wants another plate of pudding,\nand does not like to apply officially for more.  He catches the\nservant’s eye and looks at the pudding; the servant understands,\ntakes his plate without a word, and gets him some.  Is it metaphor\nto say that the boy asked the servant to do this, or is it not\nrather pedantry to insist on the letter of a bond and deny its\nspirit, by denying that language passed, on the ground that the\nsymbols covenanted upon and assented to by both were uttered and\nreceived by eyes and not by mouth and ears?  When the lady drank to\nthe gentleman only with her eyes, and he pledged with his, was there\nno conversation because there was neither noun nor verb?  Eyes are\nverbs, and glasses of wine are good nouns enough as between those\nwho understand one another.  Whether the ideas underlying them are\nexpressed and conveyed by eyeage or by tonguage is a detail that\nmatters nothing.",
        "But everything we say is metaphorical if we choose to be captious.\nScratch the simplest expressions, and you will find the metaphor.\nWritten words are handage, inkage and paperage; it is only by\nmetaphor, or substitution and transposition of ideas, that we can\ncall them language.  They are indeed potential language, and the\nsymbols employed presuppose nouns, verbs, and the other parts of\nspeech; but for the most part it is in what we read between the\nlines that the profounder meaning of any letter is conveyed.  There\nare words unwritten and untranslatable into any nouns that are\nnevertheless felt as above, about and underneath the gross material\nsymbols that lie scrawled upon the paper; and the deeper the feeling\nwith which anything is written the more pregnant will it be of\nmeaning which can be conveyed securely enough, but which loses\nrather than gains if it is squeezed into a sentence, and limited by\nthe parts of speech.  The language is not in the words but in the\nheart-to-heartness of the thing, which is helped by words, but is\nnearer and farther than they.  A correspondent wrote to me once,\nmany years ago, “If I could think to you without words you would\nunderstand me better.”  But surely in this he was thinking to me,\nand without words, and I did understand him better . . .  So it is\nnot by the words that I am too presumptuously venturing to speak to-\nnight that your opinions will be formed or modified.  They will be\nformed or modified, if either, by something that you will feel, but\nwhich I have not spoken, to the full as much as by anything that I\nhave actually uttered.  You may say that this borders on mysticism.\nPerhaps it does, but their really is some mysticism in nature.",
        "To return, however, to terra firma.  I believe I am right in saying\nthat the essence of language lies in the intentional conveyance of\nideas from one living being to another through the instrumentality\nof arbitrary tokens or symbols agreed upon, and understood by both\nas being associated with the particular ideas in question.  The\nnature of the symbol chosen is a matter of indifference; it may be\nanything that appeals to human senses, and is not too hot or too\nheavy; the essence of the matter lies in a mutual covenant that\nwhatever it is it shall stand invariably for the same thing, or\nnearly so.",
        "We shall see this more easily if we observe the differences between\nwritten and spoken language.  The written word “stone,” and the\nspoken word, are each of them symbols arrived at in the first\ninstance arbitrarily.  They are neither of them more like the other\nthan they are to the idea of a stone which rises before our minds,\nwhen we either see or hear the word, or than this idea again is like\nthe actual stone itself, but nevertheless the spoken symbol and the\nwritten one each alike convey with certainty the combination of\nideas to which we have agreed to attach them.",
        "The written symbol is formed with the hand, appeals to the eye,\nleaves a material trace as long as paper and ink last, can travel as\nfar as paper and ink can travel, and can be imprinted on eye after\neye practically ad infinitum both as regards time and space.",
        "The spoken symbol is formed by means of various organs in or about\nthe mouth, appeals to the ear, not the eye, perishes instantly\nwithout material trace, and if it lives at all does so only in the\nminds of those who heard it.  The range of its action is no wider\nthan that within which a voice can be heard; and every time a fresh\nimpression is wanted the type must be set up anew.",
        "The written symbol extends infinitely, as regards time and space,\nthe range within which one mind can communicate with another; it\ngives the writer’s mind a life limited by the duration of ink,\npaper, and readers, as against that of his flesh and blood body.  On\nthe other hand, it takes longer to learn the rules so as to be able\nto apply them with ease and security, and even then they cannot be\napplied so quickly and easily as those attaching to spoken symbols.\nMoreover, the spoken symbol admits of a hundred quick and subtle\nadjuncts by way of action, tone and expression, so that no one will\nuse written symbols unless either for the special advantages of\npermanence and travelling power, or because he is incapacitated from\nusing spoken ones.  This, however, is hardly to the point; the point\nis that these two conventional combinations of symbols, that are as\nunlike one another as the Hallelujah Chorus is to St. Paul’s\nCathedral, are the one as much language as the other; and we\ntherefore inquire what this very patent fact reveals to us about the\nmore essential characteristics of language itself.  What is the\ncommon bond that unites these two classes of symbols that seem at\nfirst sight to have nothing in common, and makes the one raise the\nidea of language in our minds as readily as the other?  The bond\nlies in the fact that both are a set of conventional tokens or\nsymbols, agreed upon between the parties to whom they appeal as\nbeing attached invariably to the same ideas, and because they are\nbeing made as a means of communion between one mind and another,—\nfor a memorandum made for a person’s own later use is nothing but a\ncommunication from an earlier mind to a later and modified one; it\nis therefore in reality a communication from one mind to another as\nmuch as though it had been addressed to another person.",
        "We see, therefore, that the nature of the outward and visible sign\nto which the inward and spiritual idea of language is attached does\nnot matter.  It may be the firing of a gun; it may be an old\nsemaphore telegraph; it may be the movements of a needle; a look, a\ngesture, the breaking of a twig by an Indian to tell some one that\nhe has passed that way:  a twig broken designedly with this end in\nview is a letter addressed to whomsoever it may concern, as much as\nthough it had been written out in full on bark or paper.  It does\nnot matter one straw what it is, provided it is agreed upon in\nconcert, and stuck to.  Just as the lowest forms of life\nnevertheless present us with all the essential characteristics of\nlivingness, and are as much alive in their own humble way as the\nmost highly developed organisms, so the rudest intentional and\neffectual communication between two minds through the\ninstrumentality of a concerted symbol is as much language as the\nmost finished oratory of Mr. Gladstone.  I demur therefore to the\nassertion that the lower animals have no language, inasmuch as they\ncannot themselves articulate a grammatical sentence.  I do not\nindeed pretend that when the cat calls upon the tiles it uses what\nit consciously and introspectively recognises as language; it says\nwhat it has to say without introspection, and in the ordinary course\nof business, as one of the common forms of courtship.  It no more\nknows that it has been using language than M. Jourdain knew he had\nbeen speaking prose, but M. Jourdain’s knowing or not knowing was\nneither here nor there.",
        "Anything which can be made to hitch on invariably to a definite idea\nthat can carry some distance—say an inch at the least, and which\ncan be repeated at pleasure, can be pressed into the service of\nlanguage.  Mrs. Bentley, wife of the famous Dr. Bentley of Trinity\nCollege, Cambridge, used to send her snuff-box to the college\nbuttery when she wanted beer, instead of a written order.  If the\nsnuff-box came the beer was sent, but if there was no snuff-box\nthere was no beer.  Wherein did the snuff-box differ more from a\nwritten order, than a written order differs from a spoken one?  The\nsnuff-box was for the time being language.  It sounds strange to say\nthat one might take a pinch of snuff out of a sentence, but if the\nservant had helped him or herself to a pinch while carrying it to\nthe buttery this is what would have been done; for if a snuff-box\ncan say “Send me a quart of beer,” so efficiently that the beer is\nsent, it is impossible to say that it is not a bona fide sentence.\nAs for the recipient of the message, the butler did not probably\ntranslate the snuff-box into articulate nouns and verbs; as soon as\nhe saw it he just went down into the cellar and drew the beer, and\nif he thought at all, it was probably about something else.  Yet he\nmust have been thinking without words, or he would have drawn too\nmuch beer or too little, or have spilt it in the bringing it up, and\nwe may be sure that he did none of these things.",
        "You will, of course, observe that if Mrs. Bentley had sent the\nsnuff-box to the buttery of St. John’s College instead of Trinity,\nit would not have been language, for there would have been no\ncovenant between sayer and sayee as to what the symbol should\nrepresent, there would have been no previously established\nassociation of ideas in the mind of the butler of St. John’s between\nbeer and snuff-box; the connection was artificial, arbitrary, and by\nno means one of those in respect of which an impromptu bargain might\nbe proposed by the very symbol itself, and assented to without\nprevious formality by the person to whom it was presented.  More\nbriefly, the butler of St. John’s would not have been able to\nunderstand and read it aright.  It would have been a dead letter to\nhim—a snuff-box and not a letter; whereas to the butler of Trinity\nit was a letter and not a snuff-box.",
        "You will also note that it was only at the moment when he was\nlooking at it and accepting it as a message that it flashed forth\nfrom snuff-box-hood into the light and life of living utterance.  As\nsoon as it had kindled the butler into sending a single quart of\nbeer, its force was spent until Mrs. Bentley threw her soul into it\nagain and charged it anew by wanting more beer, and sending it down\naccordingly.",
        "Again, take the ring which the Earl of Essex sent to Queen\nElizabeth, but which the queen did not receive.  This was intended\nas a sentence, but failed to become effectual language because the\nsensible material symbol never reached those sentient organs which\nit was intended to affect.  A book, again, however full of excellent\nwords it may be, is not language when it is merely standing on a\nbookshelf.  It speaks to no one, unless when being actually read, or\nquoted from by an act of memory.  It is potential language as a\nlucifer-match is potential fire, but it is no more language till it\nis in contact with a recipient mind, than a match is fire till it is\nstruck, and is being consumed.",
        "A piece of music, again, without any words at all, or a song with\nwords that have nothing in the world to do with the ideas which it\nis nevertheless made to convey, is often very effectual language.\nMuch lying, and all irony depends on tampering with covenanted\nsymbols, and making those that are usually associated with one set\nof ideas convey by a sleight of mind others of a different nature.\nThat is why irony is intolerably fatiguing unless very sparingly\nused.  Take the song which Blondel sang under the window of King\nRichard’s prison.  There was not one syllable in it to say that\nBlondel was there, and was going to help the king to get out of\nprison.  It was about some silly love affair, but it was a letter\nall the same, and the king made language of what would otherwise\nhave been no language, by guessing the meaning, that is to say by\nperceiving that he was expected to enter then and there into a new\ncovenant as to the meaning of the symbols that were presented to\nhim, understanding what this covenant was to be, and acquiescing in\nit.",
        "On the other hand, no ingenuity can torture language into being a\nfit word to use in connection with either sounds or any other\nsymbols that have not been intended to convey a meaning, or again in\nconnection with either sounds or symbols in respect of which there\nhas been no covenant between sayer and sayee.  When we hear people\nspeaking a foreign language—we will say Welsh—we feel that though\nthey are no doubt using what is very good language as between\nthemselves, there is no language whatever as far as we are\nconcerned.  We call it lingo, not language.  The Chinese letters on\na tea-chest might as well not be there, for all that they say to us,\nthough the Chinese find them very much to the purpose.  They are a\ncovenant to which we have been no parties—to which our intelligence\nhas affixed no signature.",
        "We have already seen that it is in virtue of such an understood\ncovenant that symbols so unlike one another as the written word\n\"stone” and the spoken word alike at once raise the idea of a stone\nin our minds.  See how the same holds good as regards the different\nlanguages that pass current in different nations.  The letters p, i,\ne, r, r, e convey the idea of a stone to a Frenchman as readily as\ns, t, o, n, e do to ourselves.  And why? because that is the\ncovenant that has been struck between those who speak and those who\nare spoken to.  Our “stone” conveys no idea to a Frenchman, nor his\n\"pierre” to us, unless we have done what is commonly called\nacquiring one another’s language.  To acquire a foreign language is\nonly to learn and adhere to the covenants in respect of symbols\nwhich the nation in question has adopted and adheres to.",
        "Till we have done this we neither of us know the rules, so to speak,\nof the game that the other is playing, and cannot, therefore, play\ntogether; but the convention being once known and assented to, it\ndoes not matter whether we raise the idea of a stone by the word\n\"lapis,” or by “lithos,” “pietra,” “pierre,” “stein,” “stane” or\n\"stone\"; we may choose what symbols written or spoken we choose, and\none set, unless they are of unwieldy length will do as well as\nanother, if we can get other people to choose the same and stick to\nthem; it is the accepting and sticking to them that matters, not the\nsymbols.  The whole power of spoken language is vested in the\ninvariableness with which certain symbols are associated with\ncertain ideas.  If we are strict in always connecting the same\nsymbols with the same ideas, we speak well, keep our meaning clear\nto ourselves, and convey it readily and accurately to any one who is\nalso fairly strict.  If, on the other hand, we use the same\ncombination of symbols for one thing one day and for another the\nnext, we abuse our symbols instead of using them, and those who\nindulge in slovenly habits in this respect ere long lose the power\nalike of thinking and of expressing themselves correctly.  The\nsymbols, however, in the first instance, may be anything in the wide\nworld that we have a fancy for.  They have no more to do with the\nideas they serve to convey than money has with the things that it\nserves to buy.",
        "The principle of association, as every one knows, involves that\nwhenever two things have been associated sufficiently together, the\nsuggestion of one of them to the mind shall immediately raise a\nsuggestion of the other.  It is in virtue of this principle that\nlanguage, as we so call it, exists at all, for the essence of\nlanguage consists, as I have said perhaps already too often, in the\nfixity with which certain ideas are invariably connected with\ncertain symbols.  But this being so, it is hard to see how we can\ndeny that the lower animals possess the germs of a highly rude and\nunspecialised, but still true language, unless we also deny that\nthey have any ideas at all; and this I gather is what Professor Max\nMuller in a quiet way rather wishes to do.  Thus he says, “It is\neasy enough to show that animals communicate, but this is a fact\nwhich has never been doubted.  Dogs who growl and bark leave no\ndoubt in the minds of other dogs or cats, or even of man, of what\nthey mean, but growling and barking are not language, nor do they\neven contain the elements of language.” {18}",
        "I observe the Professor says that animals communicate without saying\nwhat it is that they communicate.  I believe this to have been\nbecause if he said that the lower animals communicate their ideas,\nthis would be to admit that they have ideas; if so, and if, as they\npresent every appearance of doing, they can remember, reflect upon,\nmodify these ideas according to modified surroundings, and\ninterchange them with one another, how is it possible to deny them\nthe germs of thought, language, and reason—not to say a good deal\nmore than the germs?  It seems to me that not knowing what else to\nsay that animals communicated if it was not ideas, and not knowing\nwhat mess he might not get into if he admitted that they had ideas\nat all, he thought it safer to omit his accusative case altogether.",
        "That growling and barking cannot be called a very highly specialised\nlanguage goes without saying; they are, however, so much diversified\nin character, according to circumstances, that they place a\nconsiderable number of symbols at an animal’s command, and he\ninvariably attaches the same symbol to the same idea.  A cat never\npurrs when she is angry, nor spits when she is pleased.  When she\nrubs her head against any one affectionately it is her symbol for\nsaying that she is very fond of him, and she expects, and usually\nfinds that it will be understood.  If she sees her mistress raise\nher hand as though to pretend to strike her, she knows that it is\nthe symbol her mistress invariably attaches to the idea of sending\nher away, and as such she accepts it.  Granted that the symbols in\nuse among the lower animals are fewer and less highly differentiated\nthan in the case of any known human language, and therefore that\nanimal language is incomparably less subtle and less capable of\nexpressing delicate shades of meaning than our own, these\ndifferences are nevertheless only those that exist between highly\ndeveloped and inchoate language; they do not involve those that\ndistinguish language from no language.  They are the differences\nbetween the undifferentiated protoplasm of the amoeba and our own\ncomplex organisation; they are not the differences between life and\nno life.  In animal language as much as in human there is a mind\nintentionally making use of a symbol accepted by another mind as\ninvariably attached to a certain idea, in order to produce that idea\nin the mind which it is desired to affect—more briefly, there is a\nsayer, a sayee, and a covenanted symbol designedly applied.  Our own\nspeech is vertebrated and articulated by means of nouns, verbs, and\nthe rules of grammar.  A dog’s speech is invertebrate, but I do not\nsee how it is possible to deny that it possesses all the essential\nelements of language.",
        "I have said nothing about Professor R. L. Garner’s researches into\nthe language of apes, because they have not yet been so far verified\nand accepted as to make it safe to rely upon them; but when he lays\nit down that all voluntary sounds are the products of thought, and\nthat, if they convey a meaning to another, they perform the\nfunctions of human speech, he says what I believe will commend\nitself to any unsophisticated mind.  I could have wished, however,\nthat he had not limited himself to sounds, and should have preferred\nhis saying what I doubt not he would readily accept—I mean, that\nall symbols or tokens of whatever kind, if voluntarily adopted as\nsuch, are the products of thought, and perform the functions of\nhuman speech; but I cannot too often remind you that nothing can be\nconsidered as fulfilling the conditions of language, except a\nvoluntary application of a recognised token in order to convey a\nmore or less definite meaning, with the intention doubtless of thus\npurchasing as it were some other desired meaning and consequent\nsensation.  It is astonishing how closely in this respect money and\nwords resemble one another.  Money indeed may be considered as the\nmost universal and expressive of all languages.  For gold and silver\ncoins are no more money when not in the actual process of being\nvoluntarily used in purchase, than words not so in use are language.\nPounds, shillings and pence are recognised covenanted tokens, the\noutward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual purchasing\npower, but till in actual use they are only potential money, as the\nsymbols of language, whatever they may be, are only potential\nlanguage till they are passing between two minds.  It is the power\nand will to apply the symbols that alone gives life to money, and as\nlong as these are in abeyance the money is in abeyance also; the\ncoins may be safe in one’s pocket, but they are as dead as a log\ntill they begin to burn in it, and so are our words till they begin\nto burn within us.",
        "The real question, however, as to the substantial underlying\nidentity between the language of the lower animals and our own,\nturns upon that other question whether or no, in spite of an\nimmeasurable difference of degree, the thought and reason of man and\nof the lower animals is essentially the same.  No one will expect a\ndog to master and express the varied ideas that are incessantly\narising in connection with human affairs.  He is a pauper as against\na millionaire.  To ask him to do so would be like giving a street-\nboy sixpence and telling him to go and buy himself a founder’s share\nin the New River Company.  He would not even know what was meant,\nand even if he did it would take several millions of sixpences to\nbuy one.  It is astonishing what a clever workman will do with very\nmodest tools, or again how far a thrifty housewife will make a very\nsmall sum of money go, or again in like manner how many ideas an\nintelligent brute can receive and convey with its very limited\nvocabulary; but no one will pretend that a dog’s intelligence can\never reach the level of a man’s.  What we do maintain is that,\nwithin its own limited range, it is of the same essential character\nas our own, and that though a dog’s ideas in respect of human\naffairs are both vague and narrow, yet in respect of canine affairs\nthey are precise enough and extensive enough to deserve no other\nname than thought or reason.  We hold moreover that they communicate\ntheir ideas in essentially the same manner as we do—that is to say,\nby the instrumentality of a code of symbols attached to certain\nstates of mind and material objects, in the first instance\narbitrarily, but so persistently, that the presentation of the\nsymbol immediately carries with it the idea which it is intended to\nconvey.  Animals can thus receive and impart ideas on all that most\nconcerns them.  As my great namesake said some two hundred years\nago, they know “what’s what, and that’s as high as metaphysic wit\ncan fly.”  And they not only know what’s what themselves, but can\nimpart to one another any new what’s-whatness that they may have\nacquired, for they are notoriously able to instruct and correct one\nanother.",
        "Against this Professor Max Muller contends that we can know nothing\nof what goes on in the mind of any lower animal, inasmuch as we are\nnot lower animals ourselves.  “We can imagine anything we like about\nwhat passes in the mind of an animal,” he writes, “we can know\nabsolutely nothing.” {19}  It is something to have it in evidence\nthat he conceives animals as having a mind at all, but it is not\neasy to see how they can be supposed to have a mind, without being\nable to acquire ideas, and having acquired, to read, mark, learn,\nand inwardly digest them.  Surely the mistake of requiring too much\nevidence is hardly less great than that of being contented with too\nlittle.  We, too, are animals, and can no more refuse to infer\nreason from certain visible actions in their case than we can in our\nown.  If Professor Max Muller’s plea were allowed, we should have to\ndeny our right to infer confidently what passes in the mind of any\none not ourselves, inasmuch as we are not that person.  We never,\nindeed, can obtain irrefragable certainty about this or any other\nmatter, but we can be sure enough in many cases to warrant our\nstaking all that is most precious to us on the soundness of our\nopinion.  Moreover, if the Professor denies our right to infer that\nanimals reason, on the ground that we are not animals enough\nourselves to be able to form an opinion, with what right does he\ninfer so confidently himself that they do not reason?  And how, if\nthey present every one of those appearances which we are accustomed\nto connect with the communication of an idea from one mind to\nanother, can we deny that they have a language of their own, though\nit is one which in most cases we can neither speak nor understand?\nHow can we say that a sentinel rook, when it sees a man with a gun\nand warns the other rooks by a concerted note which they all show\nthat they understand by immediately taking flight, should not be\ncredited both with reason and the germs of language?",
        "After all, a professor, whether of philology, psychology, biology,\nor any other ology, is hardly the kind of person to whom we should\nappeal on such an elementary question as that of animal intelligence\nand language.  We might as well ask a botanist to tell us whether\ngrass grows, or a meteorologist to tell us if it has left off\nraining.  If it is necessary to appeal to any one, I should prefer\nthe opinion of an intelligent gamekeeper to that of any professor,\nhowever learned.  The keepers, again, at the Zoological Gardens,\nhave exceptional opportunities for studying the minds of animals—\nmodified, indeed, by captivity, but still minds of animals.  Grooms,\nagain, and dog-fanciers, are to the full as able to form an\nintelligent opinion on the reason and language of animals as any\nUniversity Professor, and so are cats’-meat men.  I have repeatedly\nasked gamekeepers and keepers at the Zoological Gardens whether\nanimals could reason and converse with one another, and have always\nfound myself regarded somewhat contemptuously for having even asked\nthe question.  I once said to a friend, in the hearing of a keeper\nat the Zoological Gardens, that the penguin was very stupid.  The\nman was furious, and jumped upon me at once.  “He’s not stupid at\nall,” said he; “he’s very intelligent.”",
        "Who has not seen a cat, when it wishes to go out, raise its fore\npaws on to the handle of the door, or as near as it can get, and\nlook round, evidently asking some one to turn it for her?  Is it\nreasonable to deny that a reasoning process is going on in the cat’s\nmind, whereby she connects her wish with the steps necessary for its\nfulfilment, and also with certain invariable symbols which she knows\nher master or mistress will interpret?  Once, in company with a\nfriend, I watched a cat playing with a house-fly in the window of a\nground-floor room.  We were in the street, while the cat was inside.\nWhen we came up to the window she gave us one searching look, and,\nhaving satisfied herself that we had nothing for her, went on with\nher game.  She knew all about the glass in the window, and was sure\nwe could do nothing to molest her, so she treated us with absolute\ncontempt, never even looking at us again.",
        "The game was this.  She was to catch the fly and roll it round and\nround under her paw along the window-sill, but so gently as not to\ninjure it nor prevent it from being able to fly again when she had\ndone rolling it.  It was very early spring, and flies were scarce,\nin fact there was not another in the whole window.  She knew that if\nshe crippled this one, it would not be able to amuse her further,\nand that she would not readily get another instead, and she liked\nthe feel of it under her paw.  It was soft and living, and the\nquivering of its wings tickled the ball of her foot in a manner that\nshe found particularly grateful; so she rolled it gently along the\nwhole length of the window-sill.  It then became the fly’s turn.  He\nwas to get up and fly about in the window, so as to recover himself\na little; then she was to catch him again, and roll him softly all\nalong the window-sill, as she had done before.",
        "It was plain that the cat knew the rules of her game perfectly well,\nand enjoyed it keenly.  It was equally plain that the fly could not\nmake head or tail of what it was all about.  If it had been able to\ndo so it would have gone to play in the upper part of the window,\nwhere the cat could not reach it.  Perhaps it was always hoping to\nget through the glass, and escape that way; anyhow, it kept pretty\nmuch to the same pane, no matter how often it was rolled.  At last,\nhowever, the fly, for some reason or another, did not reappear on\nthe pane, and the cat began looking everywhere to find it.  Her\nannoyance when she failed to do so was extreme.  It was not only\nthat she had lost her fly, but that she could not conceive how she\nshould have ever come to do so.  Presently she noted a small knot in\nthe woodwork of the sill, and it flashed upon her that she had\naccidentally killed the fly, and that this was its dead body.  She\ntried to move it gently with her paw, but it was no use, and for the\ntime she satisfied herself that the knot and the fly had nothing to\ndo with one another.  Every now and then, however, she returned to\nit as though it were the only thing she could think of, and she\nwould try it again.  She seemed to say she was certain there had\nbeen no knot there before—she must have seen it if there had been;\nand yet, the fly could hardly have got jammed so firmly into the\nwood.  She was puzzled and irritated beyond measure, and kept\nlooking in the same place again and again, just as we do when we\nhave mislaid something.  She was rapidly losing temper and dignity\nwhen suddenly we saw the fly reappear from under the cat’s stomach\nand make for the window-pane, at the very moment when the cat\nherself was exclaiming for the fiftieth time that she wondered where\nthat stupid fly ever could have got to.  No man who has been hunting\ntwenty minutes for his spectacles could be more delighted when he\nsuddenly finds them on his own forehead.  “So that’s where you\nwere,” we seemed to hear her say, as she proceeded to catch it, and\nagain began rolling it very softly without hurting it, under her\npaw.  My friend and I both noticed that the cat, in spite of her\nperplexity, never so much as hinted that we were the culprits.  The\nquestion whether anything outside the window could do her good or\nharm had long since been settled by her in the negative, and she was\nnot going to reopen it; she simply cut us dead, and though her\nannoyance was so great that she was manifestly ready to lay the\nblame on anybody or anything with or without reason, and though she\nmust have perfectly well known that we were watching the whole\naffair with amusement, she never either asked us if we had happened\nto see such a thing as a fly go down our way lately, or accused us\nof having taken it from her—both of which ideas she would, I am\nconfident, have been very well able to convey to us if she had been\nso minded.",
        "Now what are thought and reason if the processes that were going\nthrough this cat’s mind were not both one and the other?  It would\nbe childish to suppose that the cat thought in words of its own, or\nin anything like words.  Its thinking was probably conducted through\nthe instrumentality of a series of mental images.  We so habitually\nthink in words ourselves that we find it difficult to realise\nthought without words at all; our difficulty, however, in imagining\nthe particular manner in which the cat thinks has nothing to do with\nthe matter.  We must answer the question whether she thinks or no,\nnot according to our own ease or difficulty in understanding the\nparticular manner of her thinking, but according as her action does\nor does not appear to be of the same character as other action that\nwe commonly call thoughtful.  To say that the cat is not\nintelligent, merely on the ground that we cannot ourselves fathom\nher intelligence—this, as I have elsewhere said, is to make\nintelligence mean the power of being understood, rather than the\npower of understanding.  This nevertheless is what, for all our\nboasted intelligence, we generally do.  The more we can understand\nan animal’s ways, the more intelligent we call it, and the less we\ncan understand these, the more stupid do we declare it to be.  As\nfor plants—whose punctuality and attention to all the details and\nroutine of their somewhat restricted lines of business is as obvious\nas it is beyond all praise—we understand the working of their minds\nso little that by common consent we declare them to have no\nintelligence at all.",
        "Before concluding I should wish to deal a little more fully with\nProfessor Max Muller’s contention that there can be no reason\nwithout language, and no language without reason.  Surely when two\npractised pugilists are fighting, parrying each other’s blows, and\nwatching keenly for an unguarded point, they are thinking and\nreasoning very subtly the whole time, without doing so in words.\nThe machination of their thoughts, as well as its expression, is\nactual—I mean, effectuated and expressed by action and deed, not\nwords.  They are unaware of any logical sequence of thought that\nthey could follow in words as passing through their minds at all.\nThey may perhaps think consciously in words now and again, but such\nthought will be intermittent, and the main part of the fighting will\nbe done without any internal concomitance of articulated phrases.\nYet we cannot doubt that their action, however much we may\ndisapprove of it, is guided by intelligence and reason; nor should\nwe doubt that a reasoning process of the same character goes on in\nthe minds of two dogs or fighting-cocks when they are striving to\nmaster their opponents.",
        "Do we think in words, again, when we wind up our watches, put on our\nclothes, or eat our breakfasts?  If we do, it is generally about\nsomething else.  We do these things almost as much without the help\nof words as we wink or yawn, or perform any of those other actions\nthat we call reflex, as it would almost seem because they are done\nwithout reflection.  They are not, however, the less reasonable\nbecause wordless.",
        "Even when we think we are thinking in words, we do so only in half\nmeasure.  A running accompaniment of words no doubt frequently\nattends our thoughts; but, unless we are writing or speaking, this\naccompaniment is of the vaguest and most fitful kind, as we often\nfind out when we try to write down or say what we are thinking\nabout, though we have a fairly definite notion of it, or fancy that\nwe have one, all the time.  The thought is not steadily and\ncoherently governed by and moulded in words, nor does it steadily\ngovern them.  Words and thought interact upon and help one another,\nas any other mechanical appliances interact on and help the\ninvention that first hit upon them; but reason or thought, for the\nmost part, flies along over the heads of words, working its own\nmysterious way in paths that are beyond our ken, though whether some\nof our departmental personalities are as unconscious of what is\npassing, as that central government is which we alone dub with the\nname of “we” or “us,” is a point on which I will not now touch.",
        "I cannot think, then, that Professor Max Muller’s contention that\nthought and language are identical—and he has repeatedly affirmed\nthis—will ever be generally accepted.  Thought is no more identical\nwith language than feeling is identical with the nervous system.\nTrue, we can no more feel without a nervous system than we can\ndiscern certain minute organisms without a microscope.  Destroy the\nnervous system, and we destroy feeling.  Destroy the microscope, and\nwe can no longer see the animalcules; but our sight of the\nanimalcules is not the microscope, though it is effectuated by means\nof the microscope, and our feeling is not the nervous system, though\nthe nervous system is the instrument that enables us to feel.",
        "The nervous system is a device which living beings have gradually\nperfected—I believe I may say quite truly—through the will and\npower which they have derived from a fountain-head, the existence of\nwhich we can infer, but which we can never apprehend.  By the help\nof this device, and in proportion as they have perfected it, living\nbeings feel ever with greater definiteness, and hence formulate\ntheir feelings in thought with more and more precision.  The higher\nevolution of thought has reacted on the nervous system, and the\nconsequent higher evolution of the nervous system has again reacted\nupon thought.  These things are as power and desire, or supply and\ndemand, each one of which is continually outstripping, and being in\nturn outstripped by the other; but, in spite of their close\nconnection and interaction, power is not desire, nor demand supply.\nLanguage is a device evolved sometimes by leaps and bounds, and\nsometimes exceedingly slowly, whereby we help ourselves alike to\ngreater ease, precision, and complexity of thought, and also to more\nconvenient interchange of thought among ourselves.  Thought found\nrude expression, which gradually among other forms assumed that of\nwords.  These reacted upon thought, and thought again on them, but\nthought is no more identical with words than words are with the\nseparate letters of which they are composed.",
        "To sum up, then, and to conclude.  I would ask you to see the\nconnection between words and ideas, as in the first instance\narbitrary.  No doubt in some cases an imitation of the cry of some\nbird or wild beast would suggest the name that should be attached to\nit; occasionally the sound of an operation such as grinding may have\ninfluenced the choice of the letters g, r, as the root of many words\nthat denote a grinding, grating, grasping, crushing, action; but I\nunderstand that the number of words due to direct imitation is\ncomparatively few in number, and that they have been mainly coined\nas the result of connections so far-fetched and fanciful as to\namount practically to no connection at all.  Once chosen, however,\nthey were adhered to for a considerable time among the dwellers in\nany given place, so as to become acknowledged as the vulgar tongue,\nand raise readily in the mind of the inhabitants of that place the\nideas with which they had been artificially associated.",
        "As regards our being able to think and reason without words, the\nDuke of Argyll has put the matter as soundly as I have yet seen it\nstated.  “It seems to me,” he wrote, “quite certain that we can and\ndo constantly think of things without thinking of any sound or word\nas designating them.  Language seems to me to be necessary for the\nprogress of thought, but not at all for the mere act of thinking.\nIt is a product of thought, an expression of it, a vehicle for the\ncommunication of it, and an embodiment which is essential to its\ngrowth and continuity; but it seems to me altogether erroneous to\nregard it as an inseparable part of cogitation.”",
        "The following passages, again, are quoted from Sir William Hamilton\nin Professor Max Muller’s own book, with so much approval as to lead\none to suppose that the differences between himself and his\nopponents are in reality less than he believes them to be:-",
        "“Language,” says Sir W. Hamilton, “is the attribution of signs to\nour cognitions of things.  But as a cognition must have already been\nthere before it could receive a sign, consequently that knowledge\nwhich is denoted by the formation and application of a word must\nhave preceded the symbol that denotes it.  A sign, however, is\nnecessary to give stability to our intellectual progress—to\nestablish each step in our advance as a new starting-point for our\nadvance to another beyond.  A country may be overrun by an armed\nhost, but it is only conquered by the establishment of fortresses.\nWords are the fortresses of thought.  They enable us to realise our\ndominion over what we have already overrun in thought; to make every\nintellectual conquest the base of operations for others still\nbeyond.”",
        "“This,” says Professor Max Muller, “is a most happy illustration,\"\nand he proceeds to quote the following, also from Sir William\nHamilton, which he declares to be even happier still.",
        "“You have all heard,” says Sir William Hamilton, “of the process of\ntunnelling through a sandbank.  In this operation it is impossible\nto succeed unless every foot, nay, almost every inch of our progress\nbe secured by an arch of masonry before we attempt the excavation of\nanother.  Now language is to the mind precisely what the arch is to\nthe tunnel.  The power of thinking and the power of excavation are\nnot dependent on the words in the one case or on the mason-work in\nthe other; but without these subsidiaries neither could be carried\non beyond its rudimentary commencement.  Though, therefore, we allow\nthat every movement forward in language must be determined by an\nantecedent movement forward in thought, still, unless thought be\naccompanied at each point of its evolutions by a corresponding\nevolution of language, its further development is arrested.”",
        "Man has evolved an articulate language, whereas the lower animals\nseem to be without one.  Man, therefore, has far outstripped them in\nreasoning faculty as well as in power of expression.  This, however,\ndoes not bar the communications which the lower animals make to one\nanother from possessing all the essential characteristics of\nlanguage, and as a matter of fact, wherever we can follow them we\nfind such communications effectuated by the aid of arbitrary symbols\ncovenanted upon by the living beings that wish to communicate, and\npersistently associated with certain corresponding feelings, states\nof mind, or material objects.  Human language is nothing more than\nthis in principle, however much further the principle has been\ncarried in our own case than in that of the lower animals.",
        "This being admitted, we should infer that the thought or reason on\nwhich the language of men and animals is alike founded differs as\nbetween men and brutes in degree but not in kind.  More than this\ncannot be claimed on behalf of the lower animals, even by their most\nenthusiastic admirer.",
        "It will be readily admitted that of all living writers Mr. Alfred\nRussel Wallace is the one the peculiar turn of whose mind best fits\nhim to write on the subject of natural selection, or the\naccumulation of fortunate but accidental variations through descent\nand the struggle for existence.  His mind in all its more essential\ncharacteristics closely resembles that of the late Mr. Charles\nDarwin himself, and it is no doubt due to this fact that he and Mr.\nDarwin elaborated their famous theory at the same time, and\nindependently of one another.  I shall have occasion in the course\nof the following article to show how misled and misleading both\nthese distinguished men have been, in spite of their unquestionable\nfamiliarity with the whole range of animal and vegetable phenomena.\nI believe it will be more respectful to both of them to do this in\nthe most out-spoken way.  I believe their work to have been as\nmischievous as it has been valuable, and as valuable as it has been\nmischievous; and higher, whether praise or blame, I know not how to\ngive.  Nevertheless I would in the outset, and with the utmost\nsincerity, admit concerning Messrs. Wallace and Darwin that neither\ncan be held as the more profound and conscientious thinker; neither\ncan be put forward as the more ready to acknowledge obligation to\nthe great writers on evolution who had preceded him, or to place his\nown developments in closer and more conspicuous historical\nconnection with earlier thought upon the subject; neither is the\nmore ready to welcome criticism and to state his opponent’s case in\nthe most pointed and telling way in which it can be put; neither is\nthe more quick to encourage new truth; neither is the more genial,\ngenerous adversary, or has the profounder horror of anything even\napproaching literary or scientific want of candour; both display the\nsame inimitable power of putting their opinions forward in the way\nthat shall best ensure their acceptance; both are equally unrivalled\nin the tact that tells them when silence will be golden, and when on\nthe other hand a whole volume of facts may be advantageously brought\nforward.  Less than the foregoing tribute both to Messrs. Darwin and\nWallace I will not, and more I cannot pay.",
        "Let us now turn to the most authoritative exponent of latter-day\nevolution—I mean to Mr. Wallace, whose work, entitled “Darwinism,\"\nthough it should have been entitled “Wallaceism,” is still so far\nDarwinistic that it develops the teaching of Mr. Darwin in the\ndirection given to it by Mr. Darwin himself—so far, indeed, as this\ncan be ascertained at all—and not in that of Lamarck.  Mr. Wallace\ntells us, on the first page of his preface, that he has no intention\nof dealing even in outline with the vast subject of evolution in\ngeneral, and has only tried to give such an account of the theory of\nnatural selection as may facilitate a clear conception of Darwin’s\nwork.  How far he has succeeded is a point on which opinion will\nprobably be divided.  Those who find Mr. Darwin’s works clear will\nalso find no difficulty in understanding Mr. Wallace; those, on the\nother hand, who find Mr. Darwin puzzling are little likely to be\nless puzzled by Mr. Wallace.  He continues:-",
        "“The objections now made to Darwin’s theory apply solely to the\nparticular means by which the change of species has been brought\nabout, not to the fact of that change.”",
        "But “Darwin’s theory\"—as Mr. Wallace has elsewhere proved that he\nunderstands—has no reference “to the fact of that change\"—that is\nto say, to the fact that species have been modified in course of\ndescent from other species.  This is no more Mr. Darwin’s theory\nthan it is the reader’s or my own.  Darwin’s theory is concerned\nonly with “the particular means by which the change of species has\nbeen brought about\"; his contention being that this is mainly due to\nthe natural survival of those individuals that have happened by some\naccident to be born most favourably adapted to their surroundings,\nor, in other words, through accumulation in the common course of\nnature of the more lucky variations that chance occasionally\npurveys.  Mr. Wallace’s words, then, in reality amount to this, that\nthe objections now made to Darwin’s theory apply solely to Darwin’s\ntheory, which is all very well as far as it goes, but might have\nbeen more easily apprehended if he had simply said, “There are\nseveral objections now made to Mr. Darwin’s theory.”",
        "It must be remembered that the passage quoted above occurs on the\nfirst page of a preface dated March 1889, when the writer had\ncompleted his task, and was most fully conversant with his subject.\nNevertheless, it seems indisputable either that he is still\nconfusing evolution with Mr. Darwin’s theory, or that he does not\nknow when his sentences have point and when they have none.",
        "I should perhaps explain to some readers that Mr. Darwin did not\nmodify the main theory put forward, first by Buffon, to whom it\nindisputably belongs, and adopted from him by Erasmus Darwin,\nLamarck, and many other writers in the latter half of the last\ncentury and the earlier years of the present.  The early\nevolutionists maintained that all existing forms of animal and\nvegetable life, including man, were derived in course of descent\nwith modification from forms resembling the lowest now known.",
        "Mr. Darwin went as far as this, and farther no one can go.  The\npoint at issue between him and his predecessors involves neither the\nmain fact of evolution, nor yet the geometrical ratio of increase,\nand the struggle for existence consequent thereon.  Messrs. Darwin\nand Wallace have each thrown invaluable light upon these last two\npoints, but Buffon, as early as 1756, had made them the keystone of\nhis system.  “The movement of nature,” he then wrote, “turns on two\nimmovable pivots:  one, the illimitable fecundity which she has\ngiven to all species:  the other, the innumerable difficulties which\nreduce the results of that fecundity.”  Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck\nfollowed in the same sense.  They thus admit the survival of the\nfittest as fully as Mr. Darwin himself, though they do not make use\nof this particular expression.  The dispute turns not upon natural\nselection, which is common to all writers on evolution, but upon the\nnature and causes of the variations that are supposed to be selected\nfrom and thus accumulated.  Are these mainly attributable to the\ninherited effects of use and disuse, supplemented by occasional\nsports and happy accidents?  Or are they mainly due to sports and\nhappy accidents, supplemented by occasional inherited effects of use\nand disuse?",
        "The Lamarckian system has all along been maintained by Mr. Herbert\nSpencer, who, in his “Principles of Biology,” published in 1865,\nshowed how impossible it was that accidental variations should\naccumulate at all.  I am not sure how far Mr. Spencer would consent\nto being called a Lamarckian pure and simple, nor yet how far it is\nstrictly accurate to call him one; nevertheless, I can see no\nimportant difference in the main positions taken by him and by\nLamarck.",
        "The question at issue between the Lamarckians, supported by Mr.\nSpencer and a growing band of those who have risen in rebellion\nagainst the Charles-Darwinian system on the one hand, and Messrs.\nDarwin and Wallace with the greater number of our more prominent\nbiologists on the other, involves the very existence of evolution as\na workable theory.  For it is plain that what Nature can be supposed\nable to do by way of choice must depend on the supply of the\nvariations from which she is supposed to choose.  She cannot take\nwhat is not offered to her; and so again she cannot be supposed able\nto accumulate unless what is gained in one direction in one\ngeneration, or series of generations, is little likely to be lost in\nthose that presently succeed.  Now variations ascribed mainly to use\nand disuse can be supposed capable of being accumulated, for use and\ndisuse are fairly constant for long periods among the individuals of\nthe same species, and often over large areas; moreover, conditions\nof existence involving changes of habit, and thus of organisation,\ncome for the most part gradually; so that time is given during which\nthe organism can endeavour to adapt itself in the requisite\nrespects, instead of being shocked out of existence by too sudden\nchange.  Variations, on the other hand, that are ascribed to mere\nchance cannot be supposed as likely to be accumulated, for chance is\nnotoriously inconstant, and would not purvey the variations in\nsufficiently unbroken succession, or in a sufficient number of\nindividuals, modified similarly in all the necessary correlations at\nthe same time and place to admit of their being accumulated.  It is\nvital therefore to the theory of evolution, as was early pointed out\nby the late Professor Fleeming Jenkin and by Mr. Herbert Spencer,\nthat variations should be supposed to have a definite and persistent\nprinciple underlying them, which shall tend to engender similar and\nsimultaneous modification, however small, in the vast majority of\nindividuals composing any species.  The existence of such a\nprinciple and its permanence is the only thing that can be supposed\ncapable of acting as rudder and compass to the accumulation of\nvariations, and of making it hold steadily on one course for each\nspecies, till eventually many havens, far remote from one another,\nare safely reached.",
        "It is obvious that the having fatally impaired the theory of his\npredecessors could not warrant Mr. Darwin in claiming, as he most\nfatuously did, the theory of evolution.  That he is still generally\nbelieved to have been the originator of this theory is due to the\nfact that he claimed it, and that a powerful literary backing at\nonce came forward to support him.  It seems at first sight\nimprobable that those who too zealously urged his claims were\nunaware that so much had been written on the subject, but when we\nfind even Mr. Wallace himself as profoundly ignorant on this subject\nas he still either is, or affects to be, there is no limit\nassignable to the ignorance or affected ignorance of the kind of\nbiologists who would write reviews in leading journals thirty years\nago.  Mr. Wallace writes:-",
        "“A few great naturalists, struck by the very slight difference\nbetween many of these species, and the numerous links that exist\nbetween the most different forms of animals and plants, and also\nobserving that a great many species do vary considerably in their\nforms, colours and habits, conceived the idea that they might be all\nproduced one from the other.  The most eminent of these writers was\na great French naturalist, Lamarck, who published an elaborate work,\nthe Philosophie Zoologique, in which he endeavoured to prove that\nall animals whatever are descended from other species of animals.\nHe attributed the change of species chiefly to the effect of changes\nin the conditions of life—such as climate, food, &c.; and\nespecially to the desires and efforts of the animals themselves to\nimprove their condition, leading to a modification of form or size\nin certain parts, owing to the well-known physiological law that all\norgans are strengthened by constant use, while they are weakened or\neven completely lost by disuse . . .",
        "“The only other important work dealing with the question was the\ncelebrated ’Vestiges of Creation,’ published anonymously, but now\nacknowledged to have been written by the late Robert Chambers.”",
        "None are so blind as those who will not see, and it would be waste\nof time to argue with the invincible ignorance of one who thinks\nLamarck and Buffon conceived that all species were produced from one\nanother, more especially as I have already dealt at some length with\nthe early evolutionists in my work, “Evolution, Old and New,” first\npublished ten years ago, and not, so far as I am aware, detected in\nserious error or omission.  If, however, Mr. Wallace still thinks it\nsafe to presume so far on the ignorance of his readers as to say\nthat the only two important works on evolution before Mr. Darwin’s\nwere Lamarck’s Philosophie Zoologique and the “Vestiges of\nCreation,” how fathomable is the ignorance of the average reviewer\nlikely to have been thirty years ago, when the “Origin of Species\"\nwas first published?  Mr. Darwin claimed evolution as his own\ntheory.  Of course, he would not claim it if he had no right to it.\nThen by all means give him the credit of it.  This was the most\nnatural view to take, and it was generally taken.  It was not,\nmoreover, surprising that people failed to appreciate all the\nniceties of Mr. Darwin’s “distinctive feature” which, whether\ndistinctive or no, was assuredly not distinct, and was never frankly\ncontrasted with the older view, as it would have been by one who\nwished it to be understood and judge upon its merits.  It was in\nconsequence of this omission that people failed to note how fast and\nloose Mr. Darwin played with his distinctive feature, and how\nreadily he dropped it on occasion.",
        "It may be said that the question of what was thought by the\npredecessors of Mr. Darwin is, after all, personal, and of no\ninterest to the general public, comparable to that of the main\nissue—whether we are to accept evolution or not.  Granted that\nBuffon, Erasmus Darwin, and Lamarck bore the burden and heat of the\nday before Mr. Charles Darwin was born, they did not bring people\nround to their opinion, whereas Mr. Darwin and Mr. Wallace did, and\nthe public cannot be expected to look beyond this broad and\nindisputable fact.",
        "The answer to this is, that the theory which Messrs. Darwin and\nWallace have persuaded the public to accept is demonstrably false,\nand that the opponents of evolution are certain in the end to\ntriumph over it.  Paley, in his “Natural Theology,” long since\nbrought forward far too much evidence of design in animal\norganisation to allow of our setting down its marvels to the\naccumulations of fortunate accident, undirected by will, effort and\nintelligence.  Those who examine the main facts of animal and\nvegetable organisation without bias will, no doubt, ere long\nconclude that all animals and vegetables are derived ultimately from\nunicellular organisms, but they will not less readily perceive that\nthe evolution of species without the concomitance and direction of\nmind and effort is as inconceivable as is the independent creation\nof every individual species.  The two facts, evolution and design,\nare equally patent to plain people.  There is no escaping from\neither.  According to Messrs. Darwin and Wallace, we may have\nevolution, but are on no account to have it as mainly due to\nintelligent effort, guided by ever higher and higher range of\nsensations, perceptions, and ideas.  We are to set it down to the\nshuffling of cards, or the throwing of dice without the play, and\nthis will never stand.",
        "According to the older men, cards did indeed count for much, but\nplay counted for more.  They denied the teleology of the time—that\nis to say, the teleology that saw all adaptation to surroundings as\npart of a plan devised long ages since by a quasi-anthropomorphic\nbeing who schemed everything out much as a man would do, but on an\ninfinitely vaster scale.  This conception they found repugnant alike\nto intelligence and conscience, but, though they do not seem to have\nperceived it, they left the door open for a design more true and\nmore demonstrable than that which they excluded.  By making their\nvariations mainly due to effort and intelligence, they made organic\ndevelopment run on all-fours with human progress, and with\ninventions which we have watched growing up from small beginnings.\nThey made the development of man from the amoeba part and parcel of\nthe story that may be read, though on an infinitely smaller scale,\nin the development of our most powerful marine engines from the\ncommon kettle, or of our finest microscopes from the dew-drop.",
        "The development of the steam-engine and the microscope is due to\nintelligence and design, which did indeed utilise chance\nsuggestions, but which improved on these, and directed each step of\ntheir accumulation, though never foreseeing more than a step or two\nahead, and often not so much as this.  The fact, as I have elsewhere\nurged, that the man who made the first kettle did not foresee the\nengines of the Great Eastern, or that he who first noted the\nmagnifying power of the dew-drop had no conception of our present\nmicroscopes—the very limited amount, in fact, of design and\nintelligence that was called into play at any one point—this does\nnot make us deny that the steam-engine and microscope owe their\ndevelopment to design.  If each step of the road was designed, the\nwhole journey was designed, though the particular end was not\ndesigned when the journey was begun.  And so is it, according to the\nolder view of evolution, with the development of those living\norgans, or machines, that are born with us, as part of the\nperambulating carpenter’s chest we call our bodies.  The older view\ngives us our design, and gives us our evolution too.  If it refuses\nto see a quasi-anthropomorphic God modelling each species from\nwithout as a potter models clay, it gives us God as vivifying and\nindwelling in all His creatures—He in them, and they in Him.  If it\nrefuses to see God outside the universe, it equally refuses to see\nany part of the universe as outside God.  If it makes the universe\nthe body of God, it also makes God the soul of the universe.  The\nquestion at issue, then, between the Darwinism of Erasmus Darwin and\nthe neo-Darwinism of his grandson, is not a personal one, nor\nanything like a personal one.  It not only involves the existence of\nevolution, but it affects the view we take of life and things in an\nendless variety of most interesting and important ways.  It is\nimperative, therefore, on those who take any interest in these\nmatters, to place side by side in the clearest contrast the views of\nthose who refer the evolution of species mainly to accumulation of\nvariations that have no other inception than chance, and of that\nolder school which makes design perceive and develop still further\nthe goods that chance provides.",
        "But over and above this, which would be in itself sufficient, the\nhistorical mode of studying any question is the only one which will\nenable us to comprehend it effectually.  The personal element cannot\nbe eliminated from the consideration of works written by living\npersons for living persons.  We want to know who is who—whom we can\ndepend upon to have no other end than the making things clear to\nhimself and his readers, and whom we should mistrust as having an\nulterior aim on which he is more intent than on the furthering of\nour better understanding.  We want to know who is doing his best to\nhelp us, and who is only trying to make us help him, or to bolster\nup the system in which his interests are vested.  There is nothing\nthat will throw more light upon these points than the way in which a\nman behaves towards those who have worked in the same field with\nhimself, and, again, than his style.  A man’s style, as Buffon long\nsince said, is the man himself.  By style, I do not, of course, mean\ngrammar or rhetoric, but that style of which Buffon again said that\nit is like happiness, and vient de la douceur de l’ame.  When we\nfind a man concealing worse than nullity of meaning under sentences\nthat sound plausibly enough, we should distrust him much as we\nshould a fellow-traveller whom we caught trying to steal our watch.\nWe often cannot judge of the truth or falsehood of facts for\nourselves, but we most of us know enough of human nature to be able\nto tell a good witness from a bad one.",
        "However this may be, and whatever we may think of judging systems by\nthe directness or indirectness of those who advance them,\nbiologists, having committed themselves too rashly, would have been\nmore than human if they had not shown some pique towards those who\ndared to say, first, that the theory of Messrs. Darwin and Wallace\nwas unworkable; and secondly, that even though it were workable it\nwould not justify either of them in claiming evolution.  When\nbiologists show pique at all they generally show a good deal of\npique, but pique or no pique, they shunned Mr. Spencer’s objection\nabove referred to with a persistency more unanimous and obstinate\nthan I ever remember to have seen displayed even by professional\ntruth-seekers.  I find no rejoinder to it from Mr. Darwin himself,\nbetween 1865 when it was first put forward, and 1882 when Mr. Darwin\ndied.  It has been similarly “ostrichised” by all the leading\napologists of Darwinism, so far at least as I have been able to\nobserve, and I have followed the matter closely for many years.  Mr.\nSpencer has repeated and amplified it in his recent work, “The\nFactors of Organic Evolution,” but it still remains without so much\nas an attempt at serious answer, for the perfunctory and illusory\nremarks of Mr. Wallace at the end of his “Darwinism” cannot be\ncounted as such.  The best proof of its irresistible weight is that\nMr. Darwin, though maintaining silence in respect to it, retreated\nfrom his original position in the direction that would most obviate\nMr. Spencer’s objection.",
        "Yet this objection has been repeatedly urged by the more prominent\nanti-Charles-Darwinian authorities, and there is no sign that the\nBritish public is becoming less rigorous in requiring people either\nto reply to objections repeatedly urged by men of even moderate\nweight, or to let judgment go by default.  As regards Mr. Darwin’s\nclaim to the theory of evolution generally, Darwinians are beginning\nnow to perceive that this cannot be admitted, and either say with\nsome hardihood that Mr. Darwin never claimed it, or after a few\nsaving clauses to the effect that this theory refers only to the\nparticular means by which evolution has been brought about, imply\nforthwith thereafter none the less that evolution is Mr. Darwin’s\ntheory.  Mr. Wallace has done this repeatedly in his recent\n\"Darwinism.”  Indeed, I should be by no means sure that on the first\npage of his preface, in the passage about “Darwin’s theory,” which I\nhave already somewhat severely criticised, he was not intending\nevolution by “Darwin’s theory,” if in his preceding paragraph he had\nnot so clearly shown that he knew evolution to be a theory of\ngreatly older date than Mr. Darwin’s.",
        "The history of science—well exemplified by that of the development\ntheory—is the history of eminent men who have fought against light\nand have been worsted.  The tenacity with which Darwinians stick to\ntheir accumulation of fortuitous variations is on a par with the\nlike tenacity shown by the illustrious Cuvier, who did his best to\ncrush evolution altogether.  It always has been thus, and always\nwill be; nor is it desirable in the interests of Truth herself that\nit should be otherwise.  Truth is like money—lightly come, lightly\ngo; and if she cannot hold her own against even gross\nmisrepresentation, she is herself not worth holding.\nMisrepresentation in the long run makes Truth as much as it mars\nher; hence our law courts do not think it desirable that pleaders\nshould speak their bona fide opinions, much less that they should\nprofess to do so.  Rather let each side hoodwink judge and jury as\nbest it can, and let truth flash out from collision of defence and\naccusation.  When either side will not collide, it is an axiom of\ncontroversy that it desires to prevent the truth from being\nelicited.",
        "Let us now note the courses forced upon biologists by the\ndifficulties of Mr. Darwin’s distinctive feature.  Mr. Darwin and\nMr. Wallace, as is well known, brought the feature forward\nsimultaneously and independently of one another, but Mr. Wallace\nalways believed in it more firmly than Mr. Darwin did.  Mr. Darwin\nas a young man did not believe in it.  He wrote before 1889,\n\"Nature, by making habit omnipotent and its effects hereditary, has\nfitted the Fuegian for the climate and productions of his country,\"\n{21} a sentence than which nothing can coincide more fully with the\nolder view that use and disuse were the main purveyors of\nvariations, or conflict more fatally with his own subsequent\ndistinctive feature.  Moreover, as I showed in my last work on\nevolution, {22} in the peroration to his “Origin of Species,” he\ndiscarded his accidental variations altogether, and fell back on the\nolder theory, so that the body of the “Origin of Species” supports\none theory, and the peroration another that differs from it toto\ncaelo.  Finally, in his later editions, he retreated indefinitely\nfrom his original position, edging always more and more continually\ntowards the theory of his grandfather and Lamarck.  These facts\nconvince me that he was at no time a thorough-going Darwinian, but\nwas throughout an unconscious Lamarckian, though ever anxious to\nconceal the fact alike from himself and from his readers.",
        "Not so with Mr. Wallace, who was both more outspoken in the first\ninstance, and who has persevered along the path of Wallaceism just\nas Mr. Darwin with greater sagacity was ever on the retreat from\nDarwinism.  Mr. Wallace’s profounder faith led him in the outset to\nplace his theory in fuller daylight than Mr. Darwin was inclined to\ndo.  Mr. Darwin just waved Lamarck aside, and said as little about\nhim as he could, while in his earlier editions Erasmus Darwin and\nBuffon were not so much as named.  Mr. Wallace, on the contrary, at\nonce raised the Lamarckian spectre, and declared it exorcised.  He\nsaid the Lamarckian hypothesis was “quite unnecessary.”  The giraffe\ndid not “acquire its long neck by desiring to reach the foliage of\nthe more lofty shrubs, and constantly stretching its neck for this\npurpose, but because any varieties which occurred among its\nantitypes with a longer neck than usual at once secured a fresh\nrange of pasture over the same ground as their shorter-necked\ncompanions, and on the first scarcity of food were thus enabled to\noutlive them.” {23}",
        "“Which occurred” is evidently “which happened to occur” by some\nchance or accident unconnected with use and disuse.  The word\n\"accident” is never used, but Mr. Wallace must be credited with this\ninstance of a desire to give his readers a chance of perceiving that\naccording to his distinctive feature evolution is an affair of luck,\nrather than of cunning.  Whether his readers actually did understand\nthis as clearly as Mr. Wallace doubtless desired that they should,\nand whether greater development at this point would not have helped\nthem to fuller apprehension, we need not now inquire.  What was\ngained in distinctness might have been lost in distinctiveness, and\nafter all he did technically put us upon our guard.",
        "Nevertheless he too at a pinch takes refuge in Lamarckism.  In\nrelation to the manner in which the eyes of soles, turbots, and\nother flat-fish travel round the head so as to become in the end\nunsymmetrically placed, he says:-",
        "“The eyes of these fish are curiously distorted in order that both\neyes may be upon the upper side, where alone they would be of any\nuse. . . . Now if we suppose this process, which in the young is\ncompleted in a few days or weeks, to have been spread over thousands\nof generations during the development of these fish, those usually\nsurviving WHOSE EYES RETAINED MORE AND MORE OF THE POSITION INTO\nWHICH THE YOUNG FISH TRIED TO TWIST THEM [italics mine], the change\nbecomes intelligible.” {24}  When it was said by Professor Ray\nLankester—who knows as well as most people what Lamarck taught—\nthat this was “flat Lamarckism,” Mr. Wallace rejoined that it was\nthe survival of the modified individuals that did it all, not the\nefforts of the young fish to twist their eyes, and the transmission\nto descendants of the effects of those efforts.  But this, as I said\nin my book, “Evolution, Old and New,” {25} is like saying that\nhorses are swift runners, not by reason of the causes, whatever they\nwere, that occasioned the direct line of their progenitors to vary\ntowards ever greater and greater swiftness, but because their more\nslow-going uncles and aunts go away.  Plain people will prefer to\nsay that the main cause of any accumulation of favourable\nmodifications consists rather in that which brings about the initial\nvariations, and in the fact that these can be inherited at all, than\nin the fact that the unmodified individuals were not successful.\nPeople do not become rich because the poor in large numbers go away,\nbut because they have been lucky, or provident, or more commonly\nboth.  If they would keep their wealth when they have made it they\nmust exclude luck thenceforth to the utmost of their power, and\ntheir children must follow their example, or they will soon lose\ntheir money.  The fact that the weaker go to the wall does not bring\nabout the greater strength of the stronger; it is the consequence of\nthis last and not the cause—unless, indeed, it be contended that a\nknowledge that the weak go to the wall stimulates the strong to\nexertions which they would not otherwise so make, and that these\nexertions produce inheritable modifications.  Even in this case,\nhowever, it would be the exertions, or use and disuse, that would be\nthe main agents in the modification.  But it is not often that Mr.\nWallace thus backslides.  His present position is that acquired (as\ndistinguished from congenital) modifications are not inherited at\nall.  He does not indeed put his faith prominently forward and pin\nhimself to it as plainly as could be wished, but under the heading,\n\"The Non-Heredity of Acquired Characters,” he writes as follows on\np. 440 of his recent work in reference to Professor Weismann’s\nTheory of Heredity:-",
        "“Certain observations on the embryology of the lower animals are\nheld to afford direct proof of this theory of heredity, but they are\ntoo technical to be made clear to ordinary readers.  A logical\nresult of the theory is the impossibility of the transmission of\nacquired characters, since the molecular structure of the germ-plasm\nis already determined within the embryo; and Weismann holds that\nthere are no facts which really prove that acquired characters can\nbe inherited, although their inheritance has, by most writers, been\nconsidered so probable as hardly to stand in need of direct proof.",
        "“We have already seen in the earlier part of this chapter that many\ninstances of change, imputed to the inheritance of acquired\nvariations, are really cases of selection.”",
        "And the rest of the remarks tend to convey the impression that Mr.\nWallace adopts Professor Weismann’s view, but, curiously enough,\nthough I have gone through Mr. Wallace’s book with a special view to\nthis particular point, I have not been able to find him definitely\ncommitting himself either to the assertion that acquired\nmodifications never are inherited, or that they sometimes are so.\nIt is abundantly laid down that Mr. Darwin laid too much stress on\nuse and disuse, and a residuary impression is left that Mr. Wallace\nis endorsing Professor Weismann’s view, but I have found it\nimpossible to collect anything that enables me to define his\nposition confidently in this respect.",
        "This is natural enough, for Mr. Wallace has entitled his book\n\"Darwinism,” and a work denying that use and disuse produced any\neffect could not conceivably be called Darwinism.  Mr. Herbert\nSpencer has recently collected many passages from “The Origin of\nSpecies” and from “Animals and Plants under Domestication,” {26}\nwhich show how largely, after all, use and disuse entered into Mr.\nDarwin’s system, and we know that in his later years he attached\nstill more importance to them.  It was out of the question,\ntherefore, that Mr. Wallace should categorically deny that their\neffects were inheritable.  On the other hand, the temptation to\nadopt Professor Weismann’s view must have been overwhelming to one\nwho had been already inclined to minimise the effects of use and\ndisuse.  On the whole, one does not see what Mr. Wallace could do,\nother than what he has done—unless, of course, he changed his\ntitle, or had been no longer Mr. Wallace.",
        "Besides, thanks to the works of Mr. Spencer, Professor Mivart,\nProfessor Semper, and very many others, there has for some time been\na growing perception that the Darwinism of Charles Darwin was\ndoomed.  Use and disuse must either do even more than is officially\nrecognised in Mr. Darwin’s later concessions, or they must do a\ngreat deal less.  If they can do as much as Mr. Darwin himself said\nthey did, why should they not do more?  Why stop where Mr. Darwin\ndid?  And again, where in the name of all that is reasonable did he\nreally stop?  He drew no line, and on what principle can we say that\nso much is possible as effect of use and disuse, but so much more\nimpossible?  If, as Mr. Darwin contended, disuse can so far reduce\nan organ as to render it rudimentary, and in many cases get rid of\nit altogether, why cannot use create as much as disuse can destroy,\nprovided it has anything, no matter how low in structure, to begin\nwith?  Let us know where we stand.  If it is admitted that use and\ndisuse can do a good deal, what does a good deal mean?  And what is\nthe proportion between the shares attributable to use and disuse and\nto natural selection respectively?  If we cannot be told with\nabsolute precision, let us at any rate have something more definite\nthan the statement that natural selection is “the most important\nmeans of modification.”",
        "Mr. Darwin gave us no help in this respect; and worse than this, he\ncontradicted himself so flatly as to show that he had very little\ndefinite idea upon the subject at all.  Thus in respect to the\nwinglessness of the Madeira beetles he wrote:-",
        "“In some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of\nstructure, which are wholly or mainly due to natural selection.  Mr.\nWollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out\nof the 550 species (but more are now known) inhabiting Madeira, are\nso far deficient in wings that they cannot fly; and that of the 29\nendemic genera no less than 23 have all their species in this\ncondition!  Several facts,—namely, that beetles in many parts of\nthe world are frequently blown out to sea and perish; that the\nbeetles in Madeira, as observed by Mr. Wollaston, lie much concealed\nuntil the wind lulls and the sun shines; that the proportion of\nwingless beetles is larger on the exposed Desertas than in Madeira\nitself; and especially the extraordinary fact, so strongly insisted\non by Mr. Wollaston, that certain large groups of beetles, elsewhere\nexcessively numerous, which absolutely require the use of their\nwings are here almost entirely absent;—these several considerations\nmake me believe that the wingless condition of so many Madeira\nbeetles is mainly due to the action of natural selection, COMBINED\nPROBABLY WITH DISUSE [italics mine].  For during many successive\ngenerations each individual beetle which flew least, either from its\nwings having been ever so little less perfectly developed or from\nindolent habit, will have had the best chance of surviving, from not\nbeing blown out to sea; and, on the other hand, those beetles which\nmost readily took to flight would oftenest have been blown to sea,\nand thus destroyed.” {27}",
        "We should like to know, first, somewhere about how much disuse was\nable to do after all, and moreover why, if it can do anything at\nall, it should not be able to do all.  Mr. Darwin says:  “Any change\nin structure and function which can be effected by small stages is\nwithin the power of natural selection.”  “And why not,” we ask,\n\"within the power of use and disuse?”  Moreover, on a later page we\nfind Mr. Darwin saying:-",
        "“IT APPEARS PROBABLE THAT DISUSE HAS BEEN THE MAIN AGENT IN\nRENDERING ORGANS RUDIMENTARY [italics mine].  It would at first lead\nby slow steps to the more and more complete reduction of a part,\nuntil at last it has become rudimentary—as in the case of the eyes\nof animals inhabiting dark caverns, and of the wings of birds\ninhabiting oceanic islands, which have seldom been forced by beasts\nof prey to take flight, and have ultimately lost the power of\nflying.  Again, an organ, useful under certain conditions, might\nbecome injurious under others, AS WITH THE WINGS OF BEETLES LIVING\nON SMALL AND EXPOSED ISLANDS; and in this case natural selection\nwill have aided in reducing the organ, until it was rendered\nharmless and rudimentary [italics mine].” {28}",
        "So that just as an undefined amount of use and disuse was introduced\non the earlier page to supplement the effects of natural selection\nin respect of the wings of beetles on small and exposed islands, we\nhave here an undefined amount of natural selection introduced to\nsupplement the effects of use and disuse in respect of the identical\nphenomena.  In the one passage we find that natural selection has\nbeen the main agent in reducing the wings, though use and disuse\nhave had an appreciable share in the result; in the other, it is use\nand disuse that have been the main agents, though an appreciable\nshare in the result must be ascribed to natural selection.",
        "Besides, who has seen the uncles and aunts going away with the\nuniformity that is necessary for Mr. Darwin’s contention?  We know\nthat birds and insects do often get blown out to sea and perish, but\nin order to establish Mr. Darwin’s position we want the evidence of\nthose who watched the reduction of the wings during the many\ngenerations in the course of which it was being effected, and who\ncan testify that all, or the overwhelming majority, of the beetles\nborn with fairly well-developed wings got blown out to sea, while\nthose alone survived whose wings were congenitally degenerate.  Who\nsaw them go, or can point to analogous cases so conclusive as to\ncompel assent from any equitable thinker?",
        "Darwinians of the stamp of Mr. Thiselton Dyer, Professor Ray\nLankester, or Mr. Romanes, insist on their pound of flesh in the\nmatter of irrefragable demonstration.  They complain of us for not\nbringing forward some one who has been able to detect the movement\nof the hour-hand of a watch during a second of time, and when we\nfail to do so, declare triumphantly that we have no evidence that\nthere is any connection between the beating of a second and the\nmovement of the hour-hand.  When we say that rain comes from the\ncondensation of moisture in the atmosphere, they demand of us a\nrain-drop from moisture not yet condensed.  If they stickle for\nproof and cavil on the ninth part of a hair, as they do when we\nbring forward what we deem excellent instances of the transmission\nof an acquired characteristic, why may not we, too, demand at any\nrate some evidence that the unmodified beetles actually did always,\nor nearly always, get blown out to sea, during the reduction above\nreferred to, and that it is to this fact, and not to the masterly\ninactivity of their fathers and mothers, that the Madeira beetles\nowe their winglessness?  If we began stickling for proof in this\nway, our opponents would not be long in letting us know that\nabsolute proof is unattainable on any subject, that reasonable\npresumption is our highest certainty, and that crying out for too\nmuch evidence is as bad as accepting too little.  Truth is like a\nphotographic sensitised plate, which is equally ruined by over and\nby under exposure, and the just exposure for which can never be\nabsolutely determined.",
        "Surely if disuse can be credited with the vast powers involved in\nMr. Darwin’s statement that it has probably “been the main agent in\nrendering organs rudimentary,” no limits are assignable to the\naccumulated effects of habit, provided the effects of habit, or use\nand disuse, are supposed, as Mr. Darwin supposed them, to be\ninheritable at all.  Darwinians have at length woke up to the\ndilemma in which they are placed by the manner in which Mr. Darwin\ntried to sit on the two stools of use and disuse, and natural\nselection of accidental variations, at the same time.  The knell of\nCharles-Darwinism is rung in Mr. Wallace’s present book, and in the\ngeneral perception on the part of biologists that we must either\nassign to use and disuse such a predominant share in modification as\nto make it the feature most proper to be insisted on, or deny that\nthe modifications, whether of mind or body, acquired during a single\nlifetime, are ever transmitted at all.  If they can be inherited at\nall, they can be accumulated.  If they can be accumulated at all,\nthey can be so, for anything that appears to the contrary, to the\nextent of the specific and generic differences with which we are\nsurrounded.  The only thing to do is to pluck them out root and\nbranch:  they are as a cancer which, if the smallest fibre be left\nunexcised, will grow again, and kill any system on to which it is\nallowed to fasten.  Mr. Wallace, therefore, may well be excused if\nhe casts longing eyes towards Weismannism.",
        "And what was Mr. Darwin’s system?  Who can make head or tail of the\ninextricable muddle in which he left it?  The “Origin of Species” in\nits latest shape is the reduction of hedging to an absurdity.  How\ndid Mr. Darwin himself leave it in the last chapter of the last\nedition of the “Origin of Species”?  He wrote:-",
        "“I have now recapitulated the facts and considerations which have\nthoroughly convinced me that species have been modified during a\nlong course of descent.  This has been effected chiefly through the\nnatural selection of numerous, successive, slight, favourable\nvariations; aided in an important manner by the inherited effects of\nthe use and disuse of parts, and in an unimportant manner—that is,\nin relation to adaptive structures whether past or present—by the\ndirect action of external conditions, and by variations which seem\nto us in our ignorance to arise spontaneously.  It appears that I\nformerly underrated the frequency and value of these latter forms of\nvariation, as leading to permanent modifications of structure\nindependently of natural selection.”",
        "The “numerous, successive, slight, favourable variations” above\nreferred to are intended to be fortuitous, accidental, spontaneous.\nIt is the essence of Mr. Darwin’s theory that this should be so.\nMr. Darwin’s solemn statement, therefore, of his theory, after he\nhad done his best or his worst with it, is, when stripped of\nsurplusage, as follows:-",
        "“The modification of species has been mainly effected by\naccumulation of spontaneous variations; it has been aided in an\nimportant manner by accumulation of variations due to use and\ndisuse, and in an unimportant manner by spontaneous variations; I do\nnot even now think that spontaneous variations have been very\nimportant, but I used once to think them less important than I do\nnow.”",
        "It is a discouraging symptom of the age that such a system should\nhave been so long belauded, and it is a sign of returning\nintelligence that even he who has been more especially the alter ego\nof Mr. Darwin should have felt constrained to close the chapter of\nCharles-Darwinism as a living theory, and relegate it to the\nimportant but not very creditable place in history which it must\nhenceforth occupy.  It is astonishing, however, that Mr. Wallace\nshould have quoted the extract from the “Origin of Species” just\ngiven, as he has done on p. 412 of his “Darwinism,” without\nbetraying any sign that he has caught its driftlessness—for drift,\nother than a desire to hedge, it assuredly has not got.  The battle\nnow turns on the question whether modifications of either structure\nor instinct due to use or disuse are ever inherited, or whether they\nare not.  Can the effects of habit be transmitted to progeny at all?\nWe know that more usually they are not transmitted to any\nperceptible extent, but we believe also that occasionally, and\nindeed not infrequently, they are inherited and even intensified.\nWhat are our grounds for this opinion?  It will be my object to put\nthese forward in the following number of the Universal Review.",
        "At the close of my article in last month’s number of the Universal\nReview, I said I would in this month’s issue show why the opponents\nof Charles-Darwinism believe the effects of habits acquired during\nthe lifetime of a parent to produce an effect on their subsequent\noffspring, in spite of the fact that we can rarely find the effect\nin any one generation, or even in several, sufficiently marked to\narrest our attention.",
        "I will now show that offspring can be, and not very infrequently is,\naffected by occurrences that have produced a deep impression on the\nparent organism—the effect produced on the offspring being such as\nleaves no doubt that it is to be connected with the impression\nproduced on the parent.  Having thus established the general\nproposition, I will proceed to the more particular one—that habits,\ninvolving use and disuse of special organs, with the modifications\nof structure thereby engendered, produce also an effect upon\noffspring, which, though seldom perceptible as regards structure in\na single, or even in several generations, is nevertheless capable of\nbeing accumulated in successive generations till it amounts to\nspecific and generic difference.  I have found the first point as\nmuch as I can treat within the limits of this present article, and\nwill avail myself of the hospitality of the Universal Review next\nmonth to deal with the second.",
        "The proposition which I have to defend is one which no one till\nrecently would have questioned, and even now, those who look most\naskance at it do not venture to dispute it unreservedly; they every\nnow and then admit it as conceivable, and even in some cases\nprobable; nevertheless they seek to minimise it, and to make out\nthat there is little or no connection between the great mass of the\ncells of which the body is composed, and those cells that are alone\ncapable of reproducing the entire organism.  The tendency is to\nassign to these last a life of their own, apart from, and\nunconnected with that of the other cells of the body, and to cheapen\nall evidence that tends to prove any response on their part to the\npast history of the individual, and hence ultimately of the race.",
        "Professor Weismann is the foremost exponent of those who take this\nline.  He has naturally been welcomed by English Charles-Darwinians;\nfor if his view can be sustained, then it can be contended that use\nand disuse produce no transmissible effect, and the ground is cut\nfrom under Lamarck’s feet; if, on the other hand, his view is\nunfounded, the Lamarckian reaction, already strong, will gain still\nfurther strength.  The issue, therefore, is important, and is being\nfiercely contested by those who have invested their all of\nreputation for discernment in Charles-Darwinian securities.",
        "Professor Weismann’s theory is, that at every new birth a part of\nthe substance which proceeds from parents and which goes to form the\nnew embryo is not used up in forming the new animal, but remains\napart to generate the germ-cells—or perhaps I should say “germ-\nplasm\"—which the new animal itself will in due course issue.",
        "Contrasting the generally received view with his own, Professor\nWeismann says that according to the first of these “the organism\nproduces germ-cells afresh again and again, and that it produces\nthem entirely from its own substance.”  While by the second “the\ngerm-cells are no longer looked upon as the product of the parent’s\nbody, at least as far as their essential part—the specific germ-\nplasm—is concerned; they are rather considered as something which\nis to be placed in contrast with the tout ensemble of the cells\nwhich make up the parent’s body, and the germ-cells of succeeding\ngenerations stand in a similar relation to one another as a series\nof generations of unicellular organisms arising by a continued\nprocess of cell-division.” {30}",
        "On another page he writes:-",
        "“I believe that heredity depends upon the fact that a small portion\nof the effective substance of the germ, the germ-plasm, remains\nunchanged during the development of the ovum into an organism, and\nthat this part of the germ-plasm serves as a foundation from which\nthe germ-cells of the new organism are produced.  There is,\ntherefore, continuity of the germ-plasm from one generation to\nanother.  One might represent the germ-plasm by the metaphor of a\nlong creeping root-stock from which plants arise at intervals, these\nlatter representing the individuals of successive generations.” {31}",
        "Mr. Wallace, who does not appear to have read Professor Weismann’s\nessays themselves, but whose remarks are, no doubt, ultimately\nderived from the sequel to the passage just quoted from page 266 of\nProfessor Weismann’s book, contends that the impossibility of the\ntransmission of acquired characters follows as a logical result from\nProfessor Weismann’s theory, inasmuch as the molecular structure of\nthe germ-plasm that will go to form any succeeding generation is\nalready predetermined within the still unformed embryo of its\npredecessor; “and Weismann,” continues Mr. Wallace, “holds that\nthere are no facts which really prove that acquired characters can\nbe inherited, although their inheritance has, by most writers, been\nconsidered so probable as hardly to stand in need of direct proof.\"\n{32}",
        "Professor Weismann, in passages too numerous to quote, shows that he\nrecognises this necessity, and acknowledges that the non-\ntransmission of acquired characters “forms the foundation of the\nviews” set forth in his book, p. 291.",
        "Professor Ray Lankester does not commit himself absolutely to this\nview, but lends it support by saying (Nature, December 12, 1889):\n\"It is hardly necessary to say that it has never yet been shown\nexperimentally that ANYTHING acquired by one generation is\ntransmitted to the next (putting aside diseases).”",
        "Mr. Romanes, writing in Nature, March 18, 1890, and opposing certain\ndetails of Professor Weismann’s theory, so far supports it as to say\nthat “there is the gravest possible doubt lying against the\nsupposition that any really inherited decrease is due to the\ninherited effects of disuse.”  The “gravest possible doubt” should\nmean that Mr. Romanes regards it as a moral certainty that disuse\nhas no transmitted effect in reducing an organ, and it should follow\nthat he holds use to have no transmitted effect in its development.\nThe sequel, however, makes me uncertain how far Mr. Romanes intends\nthis, and I would refer the reader to the article which Mr. Romanes\nhas just published on Weismann in the Contemporary Review for this\ncurrent month.",
        "The burden of Mr. Thiselton Dyer’s controversy with the Duke of\nArgyll (see Nature, January 16, 1890, et seq.) was that there was no\nevidence in support of the transmission of any acquired\nmodification.  The orthodoxy of science, therefore, must be held as\ngiving at any rate a provisional support to Professor Weismann, but\nall of them, including even Professor Weismann himself, shrink from\ncommitting themselves to the opinion that the germ-cells of any\norganisms remain in all cases unaffected by the events that occur to\nthe other cells of the same organism, and until they do this they\nhave knocked the bottom out of their case.",
        "From among the passages in which Professor Weismann himself shows a\ndesire to hedge I may take the following from page 170 of his book:-",
        "“I am also far from asserting that the germ-plasm which, as I hold,\nis transmitted as the basis of heredity from one generation to\nanother, is absolutely unchangeable or totally uninfluenced by\nforces residing in the organism within which it is transformed into\ngerm-cells.  I am also compelled to admit it as conceivable that\norganisms may exert a modifying influence upon their germ-cells, and\neven that such a process is to a certain extent inevitable.  The\nnutrition and growth of the individual must exercise some influence\nupon its germ-cells . . . “",
        "Professor Weismann does indeed go on to say that this influence must\nbe extremely slight, but we do not care how slight the changes\nproduced may be provided they exist and can be transmitted.  On an\nearlier page (p. 101) he said in regard to variations generally that\nwe should not expect to find them conspicuous; their frequency would\nbe enough, if they could be accumulated.  The same applies here, if\nstirring events that occur to the somatic cells can produce any\neffect at all on offspring.  A very small effect, provided it can be\nrepeated and accumulated in successive generations, is all that even\nthe most exacting Lamarckian will ask for.",
        "Having now made the reader acquainted with the position taken by the\nleading Charles-Darwinian authorities, I will return to Professor\nWeismann himself, who declares that the transmission of acquired\ncharacters “at first sight certainly seems necessary,” and that “it\nappears rash to attempt to dispense with its aid.”  He continues:-",
        "“Many phenomena only appear to be intelligible if we assume the\nhereditary transmission of such acquired characters as the changes\nwhich we ascribe to the use or disuse of particular organs, or to\nthe direct influence of climate.  Furthermore, how can we explain\ninstinct as hereditary habit, unless it has gradually arisen by the\naccumulation, through heredity, of habits which were practised in\nsucceeding generations?” {33}",
        "I may say in passing that Professor Weismann appears to suppose that\nthe view of instinct just given is part of the Charles-Darwinian\nsystem, for on page 889 of his book he says “that many observers had\nfollowed Darwin in explaining them [instincts] as inherited habits.\"\nThis was not Mr. Darwin’s own view of the matter.  He wrote:-",
        "“If we suppose any habitual action to become inherited—and I think\nit can be shown that this does sometimes happen—then the\nresemblance between what originally was a habit and an instinct\nbecomes so close as not to be distinguished. . . But it would be the\nmost serious error to suppose that the greater number of instincts\nhave been acquired by habit in one generation, and then transmitted\nby inheritance to succeeding generations.  It can be clearly shown\nthat the most wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted,\nnamely, those of the hive-bee and of many ants, could not possibly\nhave been thus acquired.\"—[\"Origin of Species,” ed., 1859, p. 209.]",
        "Again we read:  “Domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as\nactions which have become inherited solely from long-continued and\ncompulsory habit, but this, I think, is not true.\"—Ibid., p. 214.",
        "Again:  “I am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrative\ncase of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of inherited\nhabit, as advanced by Lamarck.\"—[\"Origin of Species,” ed. 1872, p.\n283.]",
        "I am not aware that Lamarck advanced the doctrine that instinct is\ninherited habit, but he may have done so in some work that I have\nnot seen.",
        "It is true, as I have more than once pointed out, that in the later\neditions of the “Origin of Species” it is no longer “the MOST\nserious” error to refer instincts generally to inherited habit, but\nit still remains “a serious error,” and this slight relaxation of\nseverity does not warrant Professor Weismann in ascribing to Mr.\nDarwin an opinion which he emphatically condemned.  His tone,\nhowever, is so offhand, that those who have little acquaintance with\nthe literature of evolution would hardly guess that he is not much\nbetter informed on this subject than themselves.",
        "Returning to the inheritance of acquired characters, Professor\nWeismann says that this has never been proved either by means of\ndirect observation or by experiment.  “It must be admitted,” he\nwrites, “that there are in existence numerous descriptions of cases\nwhich tend to prove that such mutilations as the loss of fingers,\nthe scars of wounds, &c., are inherited by the offspring, but in\nthese descriptions the previous history is invariably obscure, and\nhence the evidence loses all scientific value.”",
        "The experiments of M.  Brown-Sequard throw so much light upon the\nquestion at issue that I will quote at some length from the summary\ngiven by Mr. Darwin in his “Variation of Animals and Plants under\nDomestication.” {34}  Mr. Darwin writes:-",
        "“With respect to the inheritance of structures mutilated by injuries\nor altered by disease, it was until lately difficult to come to any\ndefinite conclusion.”  [Then follow several cases in which\nmutilations practised for many generations are not found to be\ntransmitted.]  “Notwithstanding,” continues Mr. Darwin, “the above\nseveral negative cases, we now possess conclusive evidence that the\neffects of operations are sometimes inherited.  Dr. Brown-Sequard\ngives the following summary of his observations on guinea-pigs, and\nthis summary is so important that I will quote the whole:-",
        "“’1st.  Appearance of epilepsy in animals born of parents having\nbeen rendered epileptic by an injury to the spinal cord.",
        "“’2nd.  Appearance of epilepsy also in animals born of parents\nhaving been rendered epileptic by the section of the sciatic nerve.",
        "“’3rd.  A change in the shape of the ear in animals born of parents\nin which such a change was the effect of a division of the cervical\nsympathetic nerve.",
        "“’4th.  Partial closure of the eyelids in animals born of parents in\nwhich that state of the eyelids had been caused either by the\nsection of the cervical sympathetic nerve or the removal of the\nsuperior cervical ganglion.",
        "“’5th.  Exophthalmia in animals born of parents in which an injury\nto the restiform body had produced that protrusion of the eyeball.\nThis interesting fact I have witnessed a good many times, and I have\nseen the transmission of the morbid state of the eye continue\nthrough four generations.  In these animals modified by heredity,\nthe two eyes generally protruded, although in the parents usually\nonly one showed exophthalmia, the lesion having been made in most\ncases only on one of the corpora restiformia.",
        "“’6th.  Haematoma and dry gangrene of the ears in animals born of\nparents in which these ear-alterations had been caused by an injury\nto the restiform body near the nib of the calamus.",
        "“’7th.  Absence of two toes out of the three of the hind leg, and\nsometimes of the three, in animals whose parents had eaten up their\nhind-leg toes which had become anaesthetic from a section of the\nsciatic nerve alone, or of that nerve and also of the crural.\nSometimes, instead of complete absence of the toes, only a part of\none or two or three was missing in the young, although in the parent\nnot only the toes but the whole foot was absent (partly eaten off,\npartly destroyed by inflammation, ulceration, or gangrene).",
        "“’8th.  Appearance of various morbid states of the skin and hair of\nthe neck and face in animals born of parents having had similar\nalterations in the same parts, as effects of an injury to the\nsciatic nerve.’",
        "“It should be especially observed that Brown-Sequard has bred during\nthirty years many thousand guinea-pigs from animals which had not\nbeen operated upon, and not one of these manifested the epileptic\ntendency.  Nor has he ever seen a guinea-pig born without toes,\nwhich was not the offspring of parents which had gnawed off their\nown toes owing to the sciatic nerve having been divided.  Of this\nlatter fact thirteen instances were carefully recorded, and a\ngreater number were seen; yet Brown-Sequard speaks of such cases as\none of the rarer forms of inheritance.  It is a still more\ninteresting fact, ’that the sciatic nerve in the congenitally\ntoeless animal has inherited the power of passing through all the\ndifferent morbid states which have occurred in one of its parents\nfrom the time of the division till after its reunion with the\nperipheric end.  It is not, therefore, simply the power of\nperforming an action which is inherited, but the power of performing\na whole series of actions, in a certain order.’",
        "“In most of the cases of inheritance recorded by Brown-Sequard only\none of the two parents had been operated upon and was affected.  He\nconcludes by expressing his belief that ’what is transmitted is the\nmorbid state of the nervous system,’ due to the operation performed\non the parents.”",
        "Mr. Darwin proceeds to give other instances of inherited effects of\nmutilations:-",
        "“With the horse there seems hardly a doubt that exostoses on the\nlegs, caused by too much travelling on hard roads, are inherited.\nBlumenbach records the case of a man who had his little finger on\nthe right hand almost cut off, and which in consequence grew\ncrooked, and his sons had the same finger on the same hand similarly\ncrooked.  A soldier, fifteen years before his marriage, lost his\nleft eye from purulent ophthalmia, and his two sons were\nmicrophthalmic on the same side.”",
        "The late Professor Rolleston, whose competence as an observer no one\nis likely to dispute, gave Mr. Darwin two cases as having fallen\nunder his own notice, one of a man whose knee had been severely\nwounded, and whose child was born with the same spot marked or\nscarred, and the other of one who was severely cut upon the cheek,\nand whose child was born scarred in the same place.  Mr. Darwin’s\nconclusion was that “the effects of injuries, especially when\nfollowed by disease, or perhaps exclusively when thus followed, are\noccasionally inherited.”",
        "Let us now see what Professor Weismann has to say against this.  He\nwrites:-",
        "“The only cases worthy of discussion are the well-known experiments\nupon guinea-pigs conducted by the French physiologist, Brown-\nSequard.  But the explanation of his results is, in my opinion, open\nto discussion.  In these cases we have to do with the apparent\ntransmission of artificially produced malformations . . . All these\neffects were said to be transmitted to descendants as far as the\nfifth or sixth generation.",
        "“But we must inquire whether these cases are really due to heredity,\nand not to simple infection.  In the case of epilepsy, at any rate,\nit is easy to imagine that the passage of some specific organism\nthrough the reproductive cells may take place, as in the case of\nsyphilis.  We are, however, entirely ignorant of the nature of the\nformer disease.  This suggested explanation may not perhaps apply to\nthe other cases; but we must remember that animals which have been\nsubjected to such severe operations upon the nervous system have\nsustained a great shock, and if they are capable of breeding, it is\nonly probable that they will produce weak descendants, and such as\nare easily affected by disease.  Such a result does not, however,\nexplain why the offspring should suffer from the same disease as\nthat which was artificially induced in the parents.  But this does\nnot appear to have been by any means invariably the case.  Brown-\nSequard himself says:  ’The changes in the eye of the offspring were\nof a very variable nature, and were only occasionally exactly\nsimilar to those observed in the parents.’",
        "“There is no doubt, however, that these experiments demand careful\nconsideration, but before they can claim scientific recognition,\nthey must be subjected to rigid criticism as to the precautions\ntaken, the nature and number of the control experiments, &c.",
        "“Up to the present time such necessary conditions have not been\nsufficiently observed.  The recent experiments themselves are only\ndescribed in short preliminary notices, which, as regards their\naccuracy, the possibility of mistake, the precautions taken, and the\nexact succession of individuals affected, afford no data on which a\nscientific opinion can be founded” (pp. 81, 82).",
        "The line Professor Weismann takes, therefore, is to discredit the\nfacts; yet on a later page we find that the experiments have since\nbeen repeated by Obersteiner, “who has described them in a very\nexact and unprejudiced manner,” and that “the fact\"—(I imagine that\nProfessor Weismann intends “the facts”)—\"cannot be doubted.”",
        "On a still later page, however, we read:-",
        "“If, for instance, it could be shown that artificial mutilation\nspontaneously reappears in the offspring with sufficient frequency\nto exclude all possibilities of chance, then such proof [i.e., that\nacquired characters can be transmitted] would be forthcoming.  The\ntransmission of mutilations has been frequently asserted, and has\nbeen even recently again brought forward, but all the supposed\ninstances have broken down when carefully examined” (p. 390).",
        "Here, then, we are told that proof of the occasional transmission of\nmutilations would be sufficient to establish the fact, but on p. 267\nwe find that no single fact is known which really proves that\nacquired characters can be transmitted, “FOR THE ASCERTAINED FACTS\nWHICH SEEM TO POINT TO THE TRANSMISSION OF ARTIFICIALLY PRODUCED\nDISEASES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS PROOF” [Italics mine.]  Perhaps;\nbut it was mutilation in many cases that Professor Weismann\npractically admitted to have been transmitted when he declared that\nObersteiner had verified Brown-Sequard’s experiments.",
        "That Professor Weismann recognises the vital importance to his own\ntheory of the question whether or no mutilations can be transmitted\nunder any circumstances, is evident from a passage on p. 425 of his\nwork, on which he says:  “It can hardly be doubted that mutilations\nare acquired characters; they do not arise from any tendency\ncontained in the germ, but are merely the reaction of the body under\ncertain external influences.  They are, as I have recently expressed\nit, purely somatogenic characters—viz., characters which emanate\nfrom the body (soma) only, as opposed to the germ-cells; they are,\ntherefore, characters that do not arise from the germ itself.",
        "“If mutilations must necessarily be transmitted” [which no one that\nI know of has maintained], “or even if they might occasionally be\ntransmitted” [which cannot, I imagine, be reasonably questioned], “a\npowerful support would be given to the Lamarckian principle, and the\ntransmission of functional hypertrophy or atrophy would thus become\nhighly probable.”",
        "I have not found any further attempt in Professor Weismann’s book to\ndeal with the evidence adduced by Mr. Darwin to show that\nmutilations, if followed by diseases, are sometimes inherited; and I\nmust leave it to the reader to determine how far Professor Weismann\nhas shown reason for rejecting Mr. Darwin’s conclusion.  I do not,\nhowever, dwell upon these facts now as evidence of a transmitted\nchange of bodily form, or of instinct due to use and disuse or\nhabit; what they prove is that the germ-cells within the parent’s\nbody do not stand apart from the other cells of the body so\ncompletely as Professor Weismann would have us believe, but that, as\nProfessor Hering, of Prague, has aptly said, they echo with more or\nless frequency and force to the profounder impressions made upon\nother cells.",
        "I may say that Professor Weismann does not more cavalierly wave\naside the mass of evidence collected by Mr. Darwin and a host of\nother writers, to the effect that mutilations are sometimes\ninherited, than does Mr. Wallace, who says that, “as regards\nmutilations, it is generally admitted that they are not inherited,\nand there is ample evidence on this point.”  It is indeed generally\nadmitted that mutilations, when not followed by disease, are very\nrarely, if ever, inherited; and Mr. Wallace’s appeal to the “ample\nevidence” which he alleges to exist on this head, is much as though\nhe should say that there is ample evidence to show that the days are\nlonger in summer than in winter.  “Nevertheless,” he continues, “a\nfew cases of apparent inheritance of mutilations have been recorded,\nand these, if trustworthy, are difficulties in the way of the\ntheory.” . . . “The often-quoted case of a disease induced by\nmutilation being inherited (Brown-Sequard’s epileptic guinea-pigs)\nhas been discussed by Professor Weismann and shown to be not\nconclusive.  The mutilation itself—a section of certain nerves—was\nnever inherited, but the resulting epilepsy, or a general state of\nweakness, deformity, or sores, was sometimes inherited.  It is,\nhowever, possible that the mere injury introduced and encouraged the\ngrowth of certain microbes, which, spreading through the organism,\nsometimes reached the germ-cells, and thus transmitted a diseased\ncondition to the offspring.” {35}",
        "I suppose a microbe which made guinea-pigs eat their toes off was\ncommunicated to the germ-cells of an unfortunate guinea-pig which\nhad been already microbed by it, and made the offspring bite its\ntoes off too.  The microbe has a good deal to answer for.",
        "On the case of the deterioration of horses in the Falkland Islands\nafter a few generations, Professor Weismann says:-",
        "“In such a case we have only to assume that the climate which is\nunfavourable, and the nutriment which is insufficient for horses,\naffect not only the animal as a whole but also its germ-cells.  This\nwould result in the diminution in size of the germ-cells, the\neffects upon the offspring being still further intensified by the\ninsufficient nourishment supplied during growth.  But such results\nwould not depend upon the transmission by the germ-cells of certain\npeculiarities due to the unfavourable climate, which only appear in\nthe full-grown horse.”",
        "But Professor Weismann does not like such cases, and admits that he\ncannot explain the facts in connection with the climatic varieties\nof certain butterflies, except “by supposing the passive acquisition\nof characters produced by the direct influence of climate.”",
        "Nevertheless in his next paragraph but one he calls such cases\n\"doubtful,” and proposes that for the moment they should be left\naside.  He accordingly leaves them, but I have not yet found what\nother moment he considered auspicious for returning to them.  He\ntells us that “new experiments will be necessary, and that he has\nhimself already begun to undertake them.”  Perhaps he will give us\nthe results of these experiments in some future book—for that they\nwill prove satisfactory to him can hardly, I think, be doubted.  He\nwrites:-",
        "“Leaving on one side, for the moment, these doubtful and\ninsufficiently investigated cases, we may still maintain that the\nassumption that changes induced by external conditions in the\norganism as a whole are communicated to the germ-cells after the\nmanner indicated in Darwin’s hypothesis of pangenesis, is wholly\nunnecessary for the explanation of these phenomena.  Still we cannot\nexclude the possibility of such a transmission occasionally\noccurring, for even if the greater part of the effects must be\nattributable to natural selection, there might be a smaller part in\ncertain cases which depends on this exceptional factor.”",
        "I repeatedly tried to understand Mr. Darwin’s theory of pangenesis,\nand so often failed that I long since gave the matter up in despair.\nI did so with the less unwillingness because I saw that no one else\nappeared to understand the theory, and that even Mr. Darwin’s\nwarmest adherents regarded it with disfavour.  If Mr. Darwin means\nthat every cell of the body throws off minute particles that find\ntheir way to the germ-cells, and hence into the new embryo, this is\nindeed difficult of comprehension and belief.  If he means that the\nrhythms or vibrations that go on ceaselessly in every cell of the\nbody communicate themselves with greater or less accuracy or\nperturbation, as the case may be, to the cells that go to form\noffspring, and that since the characteristics of matter are\ndetermined by vibrations, in communicating vibrations they in effect\ncommunicate matter, according to the view put forward in the last\nchapter of my book “Luck or Cunning,” {36} then we can better\nunderstand it.  I have nothing, however, to do with Mr. Darwin’s\ntheory of pangenesis beyond avoiding the pretence that I understand\neither the theory itself or what Professor Weismann says about it;\nall I am concerned with is Professor Weismann’s admission, made\nimmediately afterwards, that the somatic cells may, and perhaps\nsometimes do, impart characteristics to the germ-cells.",
        "“A complete and satisfactory refutation of such an opinion,” he\ncontinues, “cannot be brought forward at present\"; so I suppose we\nmust wait a little longer, but in the meantime we may again remark\nthat, if we admit even occasional communication of changes in the\nsomatic cells to the germ-cells, we have let in the thin end of the\nwedge, as Mr. Darwin did when he said that use and disuse did a good\ndeal towards modification.  Buffon, in his first volume on the lower\nanimals, {37} dwells on the impossibility of stopping the breach\nonce made by admission of variation at all.  “If the point,” he\nwrites, “were once gained, that among animals and vegetables there\nhad been, I do not say several species, but even a single one, which\nhad been produced in the course of direct descent from another\nspecies; if, for example, it could be once shown that the ass was\nbut a degeneration from the horse—then there is no farther limit to\nbe set to the power of Nature, and we should not be wrong in\nsupposing that with sufficient time she could have evolved all other\norganised forms from one primordial type.”  So with use and disuse\nand transmission of acquired characteristics generally—once show\nthat a single structure or instinct is due to habit in preceding\ngenerations, and we can impose no limit on the results achievable by\naccumulation in this respect, nor shall we be wrong in conceiving it\nas possible that all specialisation, whether of structure or\ninstinct, may be due ultimately to habit.",
        "How far this can be shown to be probable is, of course, another\nmatter, but I am not immediately concerned with this; all I am\nconcerned with now is to show that the germ-cells not unfrequently\nbecome permanently affected by events that have made a profound\nimpression upon the somatic cells, in so far that they transmit an\nobvious reminiscence of the impression to the embryos which they go\nsubsequently towards forming.  This is all that is necessary for my\ncase, and I do not find that Professor Weismann, after all, disputes\nit.",
        "But here, again, comes the difficulty of saying what Professor\nWeismann does, and what he does not, dispute.  One moment he gives\nall that is wanted for the Lamarckian contention, the next he denies\ncommon-sense the bare necessaries of life.  For a more exhaustive\nand detailed criticism of Professor Weismann’s position, I would\nrefer the reader to an admirably clear article by Mr. Sidney H.\nVines, which appeared in Nature, October 24, 1889.  I can only say\nthat while reading Professor Weismann’s book, I feel as I do when I\nread those of Mr. Darwin, and of a good many other writers on\nbiology whom I need not name.  I become like a fly in a window-pane.\nI see the sunshine and freedom beyond, and buzz up and down their\npages, ever hopeful to get through them to the fresh air without,\nbut ever kept back by a mysterious something, which I feel but\ncannot either grasp or see.  It was not thus when I read Buffon,\nErasmus Darwin, and Lamarck; it is not thus when I read such\narticles as Mr. Vines’s just referred to.  Love of self-display, and\nthe want of singleness of mind that it inevitably engenders—these,\nI suppose, are the sins that glaze the casements of most men’s\nminds; and from these, no matter how hard he tries to free himself,\nnor how much he despises them, who is altogether exempt?",
        "Finally, then, when we consider the immense mass of evidence\nreferred to briefly, but sufficiently, by Mr. Charles Darwin, and\nreferred to without other, for the most part, than off-hand\ndismissal by Professor Weismann in the last of the essays that have\nbeen recently translated, I do not see how any one who brings an\nunbiased mind to the question can hesitate as to the side on which\nthe weight of testimony inclines.  Professor Weismann declares that\n\"the transmission of mutilations may be dismissed into the domain of\nfable.” {38}  If so, then, whom can we trust?  What is the use of\nscience at all if the conclusions of a man as competent as I readily\nadmit Mr. Darwin to have been, on the evidence laid before him from\ncountless sources, is to be set aside lightly and without giving the\nclearest and most cogent explanation of the why and wherefore?  When\nwe see a person “ostrichising” the evidence which he has to meet, as\nclearly as I believe Professor Weismann to be doing, we shall in\nnine cases out of ten be right in supposing that he knows the\nevidence to be too strong for him.",
        "Now let me return to the recent division of biological opinion into\ntwo main streams—Lamarckism and Weismannism Both Lamarckians and\nWeismannists, not to mention mankind in general, admit that the\nbetter adapted to its surroundings a living form may be, the more\nlikely it is to outbreed its compeers.  The world at large, again,\nneeds not to be told that the normal course is not unfrequently\ndeflected through the fortunes of war; nevertheless, according to\nLamarckians and Erasmus-Darwinians, habitual effort, guided by ever-\ngrowing intelligence—that is to say, by continued increase of power\nin the matter of knowing our likes and dislikes—has been so much\nthe main factor throughout the course of organic development, that\nthe rest, though not lost sight of, may be allowed to go without\nsaying.  According, on the other hand, to extreme Charles-Darwinians\nand Weismannists, habit, effort and intelligence acquired during the\nexperience of any one life goes for nothing.  Not even a little\nfraction of it endures to the benefit of offspring.  It dies with\nhim in whom it is acquired, and the heirs of a man’s body take no\ninterest therein.  To state this doctrine is to arouse instinctive\nloathing; it is my fortunate task to maintain that such a nightmare\nof waste and death is as baseless as it is repulsive.",
        "The split in biological opinion occasioned by the deadlock to which\nCharles-Darwinism has been reduced, though comparatively recent,\nwidens rapidly.  Ten years ago Lamarck’s name was mentioned only as\na byword for extravagance; now, we cannot take up a number of Nature\nwithout seeing how hot the contention is between his followers and\nthose of Weismann.  This must be referred, as I implied earlier, to\ngrowing perception that Mr. Darwin should either have gone farther\ntowards Lamarckism or not so far.  In admitting use and disuse as\nfreely as he did, he gave Lamarckians leverage for the overthrow of\na system based ostensibly on the accumulation of fortunate\naccidents.  In assigning the lion’s share of development to the\naccumulation of fortunate accidents, he tempted fortuitists to try\nto cut the ground from under Lamarck’s feet by denying that the\neffects of use and disuse can be inherited at all.  When the public\nhad once got to understand what Lamarck had intended, and wherein\nMr. Charles Darwin had differed from him, it became impossible for\nCharles-Darwinians to remain where they were, nor is it easy to see\nwhat course was open to them except to cast about for a theory by\nwhich they could get rid of use and disuse altogether.  Weismannism,\ntherefore, is the inevitable outcome of the straits to which\nCharles-Darwinians were reduced through the way in which their\nleader had halted between two opinions.",
        "This is why Charles-Darwinians, from Professor Huxley downwards,\nhave kept the difference between Lamarck’s opinions and those of Mr.\nDarwin so much in the background.  Unwillingness to make this\nunderstood is nowhere manifested more clearly than in Dr. Francis\nDarwin’s life of his father.  In this work Lamarck is sneered at\nonce or twice, and told to go away, but there is no attempt to state\nthe two cases side by side; from which, as from not a little else, I\nconclude that Dr. Francis Darwin has descended from his father with\nsingularly little modification.",
        "Proceeding to the evidence for the transmissions of acquired habits,\nI will quote two recently adduced examples from among the many that\nhave been credibly attested.  The first was contributed to Nature\n(March 14, 1889) by Professor Marcus M. Hartog, who wrote:-",
        "“A. B. is moderately myopic and very astigmatic in the left eye;\nextremely myopic in the right.  As the left eye gave such bad images\nfor near objects, he was compelled in childhood to mask it, and\nacquired the habit of leaning his head on his left arm for writing,\nso as to blind that eye, or of resting the left temple and eye on\nthe hand, with the elbow on the table.  At the age of fifteen the\neyes were equalised by the use of suitable spectacles, and he soon\nlost the habit completely and permanently.  He is now the father of\ntwo children, a boy and a girl, whose vision (tested repeatedly and\nfully) is emmetropic in both eyes, so that they have not inherited\nthe congenital optical defect of their father.  All the same, they\nhave both of them inherited his early acquired habit, and need\nconstant watchfulness to prevent their hiding the left eye when\nwriting, by resting the head on the left forearm or hand.  Imitation\nis here quite out of the question.",
        "“Considering that every habit involves changes in the proportional\ndevelopment of the muscular and osseous systems, and hence probably\nof the nervous system also, the importance of inherited habits,\nnatural or acquired, cannot be overlooked in the general theory of\ninheritance.  I am fully aware that I shall be accused of flat\nLamarckism, but a nickname is not an argument.”",
        "To this Professor Ray Lankester rejoined (Nature, March 21, 1889):-",
        "“It is not unusual for children to rest the head on the left forearm\nor hand when writing, and I doubt whether much value can be attached\nto the case described by Professor Hartog.  The kind of observation\nwhich his letter suggests is, however, likely to lead to results\neither for or against the transmission of acquired characters.  An\nold friend of mine lost his right arm when a schoolboy, and has ever\nsince written with his left.  He has a large family and\ngrandchildren, but I have not heard of any of them showing a\ndisposition to left-handedness.”",
        "From Nature (March 21, 1889) I take the second instance communicated\nby Mr. J. Jenner-Weir, who wrote as follows:-",
        "“Mr. Marcus M. Hartog’s letter of March 6th, inserted in last week’s\nnumber (p. 462), is a very valuable contribution to the growing\nevidence that acquired characters may be inherited.  I have long\nheld the view that such is often the case, and I have myself\nobserved several instances of the, at least I may say, apparent\nfact.",
        "“Many years ago there was a very fine male of the Capra megaceros in\nthe gardens of the Zoological Society.  To restrain this animal from\njumping over the fence of the enclosure in which he was confined, a\nlong, and heavy chain was attached to the collar round his neck.  He\nwas constantly in the habit of taking this chain up by his horns and\nmoving it from one side to another over his back; in doing this he\nthrew his head very much back, his horns being placed in a line with\nthe back.  The habit had become quite chronic with him, and was very\ntiresome to look at.  I was very much astonished to observe that his\noffspring inherited the habit, and although it was not necessary to\nattach a chain to their necks, I have often seen a young male\nthrowing his horns over his back and shifting from side to side an\nimaginary chain.  The action was exactly the same as that of his\nancestor.  The case of the kid of this goat appears to me to be\nparallel to that of child and parent given by Mr. Hartog.  I think\nat the time I made this observation I informed Mr. Darwin of the\nfact by letter, and he did not accuse me of ’flat Lamarckism.’”",
        "To this letter there was no rejoinder.  It may be said, of course,\nthat the action of the offspring in each of these cases was due to\naccidental coincidence only.  Anything can be said, but the question\nturns not on what an advocate can say, but on what a reasonably\nintelligent and disinterested jury will believe; granted they might\nbe mistaken in accepting the foregoing stories, but the world of\nscience, like that of commerce, is based on the faith or confidence,\nwhich both creates and sustains them.  Indeed the universe itself is\nbut the creature of faith, for assuredly we know of no other\nfoundation.  There is nothing so generally and reasonably accepted—\nnot even our own continued identity—but questions may be raised\nabout it that will shortly prove unanswerable.  We cannot so test\nevery sixpence given us in change as to be sure that we never take a\nbad one, and had better sometimes be cheated than reduce caution to\nan absurdity.  Moreover, we have seen from the evidence given in my\npreceding article that the germ-cells issuing from a parent’s body\ncan, and do, respond to profound impressions made on the somatic-\ncells.  This being so, what impressions are more profound, what\nneeds engage more assiduous attention than those connected with\nself-protection, the procuring of food, and the continuation of the\nspecies?  If the mere anxiety connected with an ill-healing wound\ninflicted on but one generation is sometimes found to have so\nimpressed the germ-cells that they hand down its scars to offspring,\nhow much more shall not anxieties that have directed action of all\nkinds from birth till death, not in one generation only but in a\nlonger series of generations than the mind can realise to itself,\nmodify, and indeed control, the organisation of every species?",
        "I see Professor S. H. Vines, in the article on Weismann’s theory\nreferred to in my preceding article, says Mr. Darwin “held that it\nwas not the sudden variations due to altered external conditions\nwhich become permanent, but those slowly produced by what he termed\n’the accumulative action of changed conditions of life.’”  Nothing\ncan be more soundly Lamarckian, and nothing should more conclusively\nshow that, whatever else Mr. Darwin was, he was not a Charles-\nDarwinian; but what evidence other than inferential can from the\nnature of the case be adduced in support of this, as I believe,\nperfectly correct judgment?  None know better than they who clamour\nfor direct evidence that their master was right in taking the\nposition assigned to him by Professor Vines, that they cannot\nreasonably look for it.  With us, as with themselves, modification\nproceeds very gradually, and it violates our principles as much as\ntheir own to expect visible permanent progress, in any single\ngeneration, or indeed in any number of generations of wild species\nwhich we have yet had time to observe.  Occasionally we can find\nsuch cases, as in that of Branchipus stagnalis, quoted by Mr.\nWallace, or in that of the New Zealand Kea whose skin, I was assured\nby the late Sir Julius von Haast, has already been modified as a\nconsequence of its change of food.  Here we can show that in even a\nfew generations structure is modified under changed conditions of\nexistence, but as we believe these cases to occur comparatively\nrarely, so it is still more rarely that they occur when and where we\ncan watch them.  Nature is eminently conservative, and fixity of\ntype, even under considerable change of conditions, is surely more\nimportant for the well-being of any species than an over-ready power\nof adaptation to, it may be, passing changes.  There could be no\nsteady progress if each generation were not mainly bound by the\ntraditions of those that have gone before it.  It is evolution and\nnot incessant revolution that both parties are upholding; and this\nbeing so, rapid visible modification must be the exception, not the\nrule.  I have quoted direct evidence adduced by competent observers,\nwhich is, I believe, sufficient to establish the fact that offspring\ncan be and is sometimes modified by the acquired habits of a\nprogenitor.  I will now proceed to the still more, as it appears to\nme, cogent proof afforded by general considerations.",
        "What, let me ask, are the principal phenomena of heredity?  There\nmust be physical continuity between parent, or parents, and\noffspring, so that the offspring is, as Erasmus Darwin well said, a\nkind of elongation of the life of the parent.",
        "Erasmus Darwin put the matter so well that I may as well give his\nwords in full; he wrote:-",
        "“Owing to the imperfection of language the offspring is termed a new\nanimal, but is in truth a branch or elongation of the parent, since\na part of the embryon animal is, or was, a part of the parent, and\ntherefore, in strict language, cannot be said to be entirely new at\nthe time of its production; and therefore it may retain some of the\nhabits of the parent system.",
        "“At the earliest period of its existence the embryon would seem to\nconsist of a living filament with certain capabilities of\nirritation, sensation, volition, and association, and also with some\nacquired habits or propensities peculiar to the parent; the former\nof these are in common with other animals; the latter seem to\ndistinguish or produce the kind of animal, whether man or quadruped,\nwith the similarity of feature or form to the parent.” {39}",
        "Those who accept evolution insist on unbroken physical continuity\nbetween the earliest known life and ourselves, so that we both are\nand are not personally identical with the unicellular organism from\nwhich we have descended in the course of many millions of years,\nexactly in the same way as an octogenarian both is and is not\npersonally identical with the microscopic impregnate ovum from which\nhe grew up.  Everything both is and is not.  There is no such thing\nas strict identity between any two things in any two consecutive\nseconds.  In strictness they are identical and yet not identical, so\nthat in strictness they violate a fundamental rule of strictness—\nnamely, that a thing shall never be itself and not itself at one and\nthe same time; we must choose between logic and dealing in a\npractical spirit with time and space; it is not surprising,\ntherefore, that logic, in spite of the show of respect outwardly\npaid to her, is told to stand aside when people come to practice.\nIn practice identity is generally held to exist where continuity is\nonly broken slowly and piecemeal, nevertheless, that occasional\nperiods of even rapid change are not held to bar identity, appears\nfrom the fact that no one denies this to hold between the\nmicroscopically small impregnate ovum and the born child that\nsprings from it, nor yet, therefore, between the impregnate ovum and\nthe octogenarian into which the child grows; for both ovum and\noctogenarian are held personally identical with the newborn baby,\nand things that are identical with the same are identical with one\nanother.",
        "The first, then, and most important element of heredity is that\nthere should be unbroken continuity, and hence sameness of\npersonality, between parents and offspring, in neither more nor less\nthan the same sense as that in which any other two personalities are\nsaid to be the same.  The repetition, therefore, of its\ndevelopmental stages by any offspring must be regarded as something\nwhich the embryo repeating them has already done once, in the person\nof one or other parent; and if once, then, as many times as there\nhave been generations between any given embryo now repeating it, and\nthe point in life from which we started—say, for example, the\namoeba.  In the case of asexually and sexually produced organisms\nalike, the offspring must be held to continue the personality of the\nparent or parents, and hence on the occasion of every fresh\ndevelopment, to be repeating something which in the person of its\nparent or parents it has done once, and if once, then any number of\ntimes, already.",
        "It is obvious, therefore, that the germ-plasm (or whatever the fancy\nword for it may be) of any one generation is as physically identical\nwith the germ-plasm of its predecessor as any two things can be.\nThe difference between Professor Weismann and, we will say,\nHeringians consists in the fact that the first maintains the new\ngerm-plasm when on the point of repeating its developmental\nprocesses to take practically no cognisance of anything that has\nhappened to it since the last occasion on which it developed itself;\nwhile the latter maintain that offspring takes much the same kind of\naccount of what has happened to it in the persons of its parents\nsince the last occasion on which it developed itself, as people in\nordinary life take of things that happen to them.  In daily life\npeople let fairly normal circumstances come and go without much heed\nas matters of course.  If they have been lucky they make a note of\nit and try to repeat their success.  If they have been unfortunate\nbut have recovered rapidly they soon forget it; if they have\nsuffered long and deeply they grizzle over it and are scared and\nscarred by it for a long time.  The question is one of cognisance or\nnon-cognisance on the part of the new germs, of the more profound\nimpressions made on them while they were one with their parents,\nbetween the occasion of their last preceding development, and the\nnew course on which they are about to enter.  Those who accept the\ntheory put forward independently by Professor Hering of Prague\n(whose work on this subject is translated in my book, “Unconscious\nMemory”) {40} and by myself in “Life and Habit,” {41} believe in\ncognizance, as do Lamarckians generally.  Weismannites, and with\nthem the orthodoxy of English science, find non-cognisance more\nacceptable.",
        "If the Heringian view is accepted, that heredity is only a mode of\nmemory, and an extension of memory from one generation to another,\nthen the repetition of its development by any embryo thus becomes\nonly the repetition of a lesson learned by rote; and, as I have\nelsewhere said, our view of life is simplified by finding that it is\nno longer an equation of, say, a hundred unknown quantities, but of\nninety-nine only, inasmuch as two of the unknown quantities prove to\nbe substantially identical.  In this case the inheritance of\nacquired characteristics cannot be disputed, for it is postulated in\nthe theory that each embryo takes note of, remembers and is guided\nby the profounder impressions made upon it while in the persons of\nits parents, between its present and last preceding development.  To\nmaintain this is to maintain use and disuse to be the main factors\nthroughout organic development; to deny it is to deny that use and\ndisuse can have any conceivable effect.  For the detailed reasons\nwhich led me to my own conclusions I must refer the reader to my\nbooks, “Life and Habit” {42} and “Unconscious Memory,” {42} the\nconclusions of which have been often adopted, but never, that I have\nseen, disputed.  A brief resume of the leading points in the\nargument is all that space will here allow me to give.",
        "We have seen that it is a first requirement of heredity that there\nshall be physical continuity between parents and offspring.  This\nholds good with memory.  There must be continued identity between\nthe person remembering and the person to whom the thing that is\nremembered happened.  We cannot remember things that happened to\nsome one else, and in our absence.  We can only remember having\nheard of them.  We have seen, however, that there is as much bona-\nfide sameness of personality between parents and offspring up to the\ntime at which the offspring quits the parent’s body, as there is\nbetween the different states of the parent himself at any two\nconsecutive moments; the offspring therefore, being one and the same\nperson with its progenitors until it quits them, can be held to\nremember what happened to them within, of course, the limitations to\nwhich all memory is subject, as much as the progenitors can remember\nwhat happened earlier to themselves.  Whether it does so remember\ncan only be settled by observing whether it acts as living beings\ncommonly do when they are acting under guidance of memory.  I will\nendeavour to show that, though heredity and habit based on memory go\nabout in different dresses, yet if we catch them separately—for\nthey are never seen together—and strip them there is not a mole nor\nstrawberry-mark, nor trick nor leer of the one, but we find it in\nthe other also.",
        "What are the moles and strawberry-marks of habitual action, or\nactions remembered and thus repeated?  First, the more often we\nrepeat them the more easily and unconsciously we do them.  Look at\nreading, writing, walking, talking, playing the piano, &c.; the\nlonger we have practised any one of these acquired habits, the more\neasily, automatically and unconsciously, we perform it.  Look, on\nthe other hand, broadly, at the three points to which I called\nattention in “Life and Habit”:-",
        "I.  That we are most conscious of and have most control over such\nhabits as speech, the upright position, the arts and sciences—which\nare acquisitions peculiar to the human race, always acquired after\nbirth, and not common to ourselves and any ancestor who had not\nbecome entirely human.",
        "II.  That we are less conscious of and have less control over eating\nand drinking [provided the food be normal], swallowing, breathing,\nseeing, and hearing—which were acquisitions of our prehuman\nancestry, and for which we had provided ourselves with all the\nnecessary apparatus before we saw light, but which are still,\ngeologically speaking, recent.",
        "III.  That we are most unconscious of and have least control over\nour digestion and circulation—powers possessed even by our\ninvertebrate ancestry, and, geologically speaking, of extreme\nantiquity.",
        "I have put the foregoing very broadly, but enough is given to show\nthe reader the gist of the argument.  Let it be noted that\ndisturbance and departure, to any serious extent, from normal\npractice tends to induce resumption of consciousness even in the\ncase of such old habits as breathing, seeing, and hearing, digestion\nand the circulation of the blood.  So it is with habitual actions in\ngeneral.  Let a player be never so proficient on any instrument, he\nwill be put out if the normal conditions under which he plays are\ntoo widely departed from, and will then do consciously, if indeed he\ncan do it at all, what he had hitherto been doing unconsciously.  It\nis an axiom as regards actions acquired after birth, that we never\ndo them automatically save as the result of long practice; the\nstages in the case of any acquired facility, the inception of which\nwe have been able to watch, have invariably been from a nothingness\nof ignorant impotence to a little somethingness of highly self-\nconscious, arduous performance, and thence to the\nunselfconsciousness of easy mastery.  I saw one year a poor blind\nlad of about eighteen sitting on a wall by the wayside at Varese,\nplaying the concertina with his whole body, and snorting like a\nchild.  The next year the boy no longer snorted, and he played with\nhis fingers only; the year after that he seemed hardly to know\nwhether he was playing or not, it came so easily to him.  I know no\nexception to this rule.  Where is the intricate and at one time\ndifficult art in which perfect automatic ease has been reached\nexcept as the result of long practice?  If, then, wherever we can\ntrace the development of automatism we find it to have taken this\ncourse, is it not most reasonable to infer that it has taken the\nsame even when it has risen in regions that are beyond our ken?\nOught we not, whenever we see a difficult action performed,\nautomatically to suspect antecedent practice?  Granted that without\nthe considerations in regard to identity presented above it would\nnot have been easy to see where a baby of a day old could have had\nthe practice which enables it to do as much as it does\nunconsciously, but even without these considerations it would have\nbeen more easy to suppose that the necessary opportunities had not\nbeen wanting, than that the easy performance could have been gained\nwithout practice and memory.",
        "When I wrote “Life and Habit” (originally published in 1877) I said\nin slightly different words:-",
        "“Shall we say that a baby of a day old sucks (which involves the\nwhole principle of the pump and hence a profound practical knowledge\nof the laws of pneumatics and hydrostatics), digests, oxygenises its\nblood—millions of years before any one had discovered oxygen—sees\nand hears, operations that involve an unconscious knowledge of the\nfacts concerning optics and acoustics compared with which the\nconscious discoveries of Newton are insignificant—shall we say that\na baby can do all these things at once, doing them so well and so\nregularly without being even able to give them attention, and yet\nwithout mistake, and shall we also say at the same time that it has\nnot learnt to do them, and never did them before?",
        "“Such an assertion would contradict the whole experience of\nmankind.”",
        "I have met with nothing during the thirteen years since the\nforegoing was published that has given me any qualms about its\nsoundness.  From the point of view of the law courts and everyday\nlife it is, of course, nonsense; but in the kingdom of thought, as\nin that of heaven, there are many mansions, and what would be\nextravagance in the cottage or farmhouse, as it were, of daily\npractice, is but common decency in the palace of high philosophy,\nwherein dwells evolution.  If we leave evolution alone, we may stick\nto common practice and the law courts; touch evolution and we are in\nanother world; not higher, not lower, but different as harmony from\ncounterpoint.  As, however, in the most absolute counterpoint there\nis still harmony, and in the most absolute harmony still\ncounterpoint, so high philosophy should be still in touch with\ncommon sense, and common sense with high philosophy.",
        "The common-sense view of the matter to people who are not over-\ncurious and to whom time is money, will be that a baby is not a baby\nuntil it is born, and that when born it should be born in wedlock.\nNevertheless, as a sop to high philosophy, every baby is allowed to\nbe the offspring of its father and mother.",
        "The high-philosophy view of the matter is that every human being is\nstill but a fresh edition of the primordial cell with the latest\nadditions and corrections; there has been no leap nor break in\ncontinuity anywhere; the man of to-day is the primordial cell of\nmillions of years ago as truly as he is the himself of yesterday; he\ncan only be denied to be the one on grounds that will prove him not\nto be the other.  Every one is both himself and all his direct\nancestors and descendants as well; therefore, if we would be\nlogical, he is one also with all his cousins, no matter how distant,\nfor he and they are alike identical with the primordial cell, and we\nhave already noted it as an axiom that things which are identical\nwith the same are identical with one another.  This is practically\nmaking him one with all living things, whether animal or vegetable,\nthat ever have existed or ever will—something of all which may have\nbeen in the mind of Sophocles when he wrote:-",
        "“Nor seest thou yet the gathering hosts of ill\nThat shall en-one thee both with thine own self\nAnd with thine offspring.”",
        "And all this has come of admitting that a man may be the same person\nfor two days running!  As for sopping common sense it will be enough\nto say that these remarks are to be taken in a strictly scientific\nsense, and have no appreciable importance as regards life and\nconduct.  True they deal with the foundations on which all life and\nconduct are based, but like other foundations they are hidden out of\nsight, and the sounder they are, the less we trouble ourselves about\nthem.",
        "What other main common features between heredity and memory may we\nnote besides the fact that neither can exist without that kind of\nphysical continuity which we call personal identity?  First, the\ndevelopment of the embryo proceeds in an established order; so must\nall habitual actions based on memory.  Disturb the normal order and\nthe performance is arrested.  The better we know “God save the\nQueen,” the less easily can we play or sing it backwards.  The\nreturn of memory again depends on the return of ideas associated\nwith the particular thing that is remembered—we remember nothing\nbut for the presence of these, and when enough of these are\npresented to us we remember everything.  So, if the development of\nan embryo is due to memory, we should suppose the memory of the\nimpregnate ovum to revert not to yesterday, when it was in the\npersons of its parents, but to the last occasion on which it was an\nimpregnate ovum.  The return of the old environment and the presence\nof old associations would at once involve recollection of the course\nthat should be next taken, and the same should happen throughout the\nwhole course of development.  The actual course of development\npresents precisely the phenomena agreeable with this.  For fuller\ntreatment of this point I must refer the reader to the chapter on\nthe abeyance of memory in my book “Life and Habit,” already referred\nto.",
        "Secondly, we remember best our last few performances of any given\nkind, so our present performance will probably resemble some one or\nother of these; we remember our earlier performances by way of\nresiduum only, but every now and then we revert to an earlier habit.\nThis feature of memory is manifested in heredity by the way in which\noffspring commonly resembles most its nearer ancestors, but\nsometimes reverts to earlier ones.  Brothers and sisters, each as it\nwere giving their own version of the same story, but in different\nwords, should generally resemble each other more closely than more\ndistant relations.  And this is what actually we find.",
        "Thirdly, the introduction of slightly new elements into a method\nalready established varies it beneficially; the new is soon fused\nwith the old, and the monotony ceases to be oppressive.  But if the\nnew be too foreign, we cannot fuse the old and the new—nature\nseeming to hate equally too wide a deviation from ordinary practice\nand none at all.  This fact reappears in heredity as the beneficial\neffects of occasional crossing on the one hand, and on the other, in\nthe generally observed sterility of hybrids.  If heredity be an\naffair of memory, how can an embryo, say of a mule, be expected to\nbuild up a mule on the strength of but two mule-memories?  Hybridism\ncauses a fault in the chain of memory, and it is to this cause that\nthe usual sterility of hybrids must be referred.",
        "Fourthly, it requires many repeated impressions to fix a method\nfirmly, but when it has been engrained into us we cease to have much\nrecollection of the manner in which it came to be so, or indeed of\nany individual repetition, but sometimes a single impression, if\nprolonged as well as profound, produces a lasting impression and is\nliable to return with sudden force, and then to go on returning to\nus at intervals.  As a general rule, however, abnormal impressions\ncannot long hold their own against the overwhelming preponderance of\nnormal authority.  This appears in heredity as the normal non-\ninheritance of mutilations on the one hand, and on the other as\ntheir occasional inheritance in the case of injuries followed by\ndisease.",
        "Fifthly, if heredity and memory are essentially the same, we should\nexpect that no animal would develop new structures of importance\nafter the age at which its species begins ordinarily to continue its\nrace; for we cannot suppose offspring to remember anything that\nhappens to the parent subsequently to the parent’s ceasing to\ncontain the offspring within itself.  From the average age,\ntherefore, of reproduction, offspring should cease to have any\nfarther steady, continuous memory to fall back upon; what memory\nthere is should be full of faults, and as such unreliable.  An\norganism ought to develop as long as it is backed by memory—that is\nto say, until the average age at which reproduction begins; it\nshould then continue to go for a time on the impetus already\nreceived, and should eventually decay through failure of any memory\nto support it, and tell it what to do.  This corresponds absolutely\nwith what we observe in organisms generally, and explains, on the\none hand, why the age of puberty marks the beginning of completed\ndevelopment—a riddle hitherto not only unexplained but, so far as I\nhave seen, unasked; it explains, on the other hand, the phenomena of\nold age—hitherto without even attempt at explanation.",
        "Sixthly, those organisms that are the longest in reaching maturity\nshould on the average be the longest-lived, for they will have\nreceived the most momentous impulse from the weight of memory behind\nthem.  This harmonises with the latest opinion as to the facts.  In\nhis article on Weismann in the Contemporary Review for May 1890, Mr.\nRomanes writes:  “Professor Weismann has shown that there is\nthroughout the metazoa a general correlation between the natural\nlifetime of individuals composing any given species, and the age at\nwhich they reach maturity or first become capable of procreation.\"\nThis, I believe, has been the conclusion generally arrived at by\nbiologists for some years past.",
        "Lateness, then, in the average age of reproduction appears to be the\nprinciple underlying longevity.  There does not appear at first\nsight to be much connection between such distinct and apparently\ndisconnected phenomena as 1, the orderly normal progress of\ndevelopment; 2, atavism and the resumption of feral characteristics;\n3, the more ordinary resemblance inter se of nearer relatives; 4,\nthe benefit of an occasional cross, and the usual sterility of\nhybrids; 5, the unconsciousness with which alike bodily development\nand ordinary physiological functions proceed, so long as they are\nnormal; 6, the ordinary non-inheritance, but occasional inheritance\nof mutilations; 7, the fact that puberty indicates the approach of\nmaturity; 8, the phenomena of middle life and old age; 9, the\nprinciple underlying longevity.  These phenomena have no conceivable\nbearing on one another until heredity and memory are regarded as\npart of the same story.  Identify these two things, and I know no\nphenomenon of heredity that does not immediately become infinitely\nmore intelligible.  Is it conceivable that a theory which harmonises\nso many facts hitherto regarded as without either connection or\nexplanation should not deserve at any rate consideration from those\nwho profess to take an interest in biology?",
        "It is not as though the theory were unknown, or had been condemned\nby our leading men of science.  Professor Ray Lankester introduced\nit to English readers in an appreciative notice of Professor\nHering’s address, which appeared in Nature, July 18, 1876.  He wrote\nto the Athenaeum, March 24, 1884, and claimed credit for having done\nso, but I do not believe he has ever said more in public about it\nthan what I have here referred to.  Mr. Romanes did indeed try to\ncrush it in Nature, January 27, 1881, but in 1883, in his “Mental\nEvolution in Animals,” he adopted its main conclusion without\nacknowledgment.  The Athenaeum, to my unbounded surprise, called him\nto task for this (March 1, 1884), and since that time he has given\nthe Heringian theory a sufficiently wide berth.  Mr. Wallace showed\nhimself favourably enough disposed towards the view that heredity\nand memory are part of the same story when he reviewed my book “Life\nand Habit” in Nature, March 27, 1879, but he has never since\nbetrayed any sign of being aware that such a theory existed.  Mr.\nHerbert Spencer wrote to the Athenaeum (April 5, 1884), and claimed\nthe theory for himself, but, in spite of his doing this, he has\nnever, that I have seen, referred to the matter again.  I have dealt\nsufficiently with his claim in my book, “Luck or Cunning.” {43}\nLastly, Professor Hering himself has never that I know of touched\nhis own theory since the single short address read in 1870, and\ntranslated by me in 1881.  Every one, even its originator, except\nmyself, seems afraid to open his mouth about it.  Of course the\ninference suggests itself that other people have more sense than I\nhave.  I readily admit it; but why have so many of our leaders shown\nsuch a strong hankering after the theory, if there is nothing in it?",
        "The deadlock that I have pointed out as existing in Darwinism will,\nI doubt not, lead ere long to a consideration of Professor Hering’s\ntheory.  English biologists are little likely to find Weismann\nsatisfactory for long, and if he breaks down there is nothing left\nfor them but Lamarck, supplemented by the important and elucidatory\ncorollary on his theory proposed by Professor Hering.  When the time\narrives for this to obtain a hearing it will be confirmed,\ndoubtless, by arguments clearer and more forcible than any I have\nbeen able to adduce; I shall then be delighted to resign the\nchampionship which till then I shall continue, as for some years\npast, to have much pleasure in sustaining.  Heretofore my\nsatisfaction has mainly lain in the fact that more of our prominent\nmen of science have seemed anxious to claim the theory than to\nrefute it; in the confidence thus engendered I leave it to any\nfuller consideration which the outline I have above given may\nincline the reader to bestow upon it.",

        "{29}  Mr. J. T. Cunningham, of the Marine Biological Laboratory,\nPlymouth, has called my attention to the fact that I have ascribed\nto Professor Ray Lankester a criticism on Mr. Wallace’s remarks upon\nthe eyes of certain fiat-fish, which Professor Ray Lankester was, in\nreality, only adopting—with full acknowledgment—from Mr.\nCunningham.  Mr. Cunningham has left it to me whether to correct my\nomission publicly or not, but he would so plainly prefer my doing so\nthat I consider myself bound to insert this note.  Curiously enough\nI find that in my book “Evolution Old and New,” I gave what Lamarck\nactually said upon the eyes of flat-fish, and having been led to\nreturn to the subject, I may as well quote his words.  He wrote:-",
        "“Need—always occasioned by the circumstances in which an animal is\nplaced, and followed by sustained efforts at gratification—can not\nonly modify an organ—that is to say, augment or reduce it—but can\nchange its position when the case requires its removal.",
        "“Ocean fishes have occasion to see what is on either side of them,\nand have their eyes accordingly placed on either side of their head.\nSome fishes, however, have their abode near coasts on submarine\nbanks and inclinations, and are thus forced to flatten themselves as\nmuch as possible in order to get as near as they can to the shore.\nIn this situation they receive more light from above than from\nbelow, and find it necessary to pay attention to whatever happens to\nbe above them; this need has involved the displacement of their\neyes, which now take the remarkable position which we observe in the\ncase of soles, turbots, plaice, &c.  The transfer of position is not\neven yet complete in the case of these fishes, and the eyes are not,\ntherefore, symmetrically placed; but they are so with the skate,\nwhose head and whole body are equally disposed on either side a\nlongitudinal section.  Hence the eyes of this fish are placed\nsymmetrically upon the uppermost side.\"—Philosophie Zoologique,\ntom. i., pp. 250, 251.  Edition C. Martins.  Paris, 1873.",
