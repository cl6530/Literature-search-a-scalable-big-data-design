        "Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He\nliked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,\nliverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes. Most of all he\nliked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of\nfaintly scented urine.",
        "Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting\nher breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the\nkitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him feel\na bit peckish.",
        "The coals were reddening.",
        "Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn’t like\nher plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the\nhob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat, its\nspout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked stiffly\nround a leg of the table with tail on high.",
        "–Mkgnao!",
        "–O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.",
        "The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the\ntable, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch my\nhead. Prr.",
        "Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see:\nthe gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail,\nthe green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.",
        "–Milk for the pussens, he said.",
        "–Mrkgnao! the cat cried.",
        "They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we\nunderstand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too. Cruel.\nHer nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder what I\nlook like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.",
        "–Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the\nchookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.",
        "Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it.",
        "–Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.",
        "She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and\nlong, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits\nnarrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to the\ndresser, took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him, poured\nwarmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.",
        "–Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.",
        "He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped\nthree times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they\ncan’t mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or\nkind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.",
        "He listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with this\ndrouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for a\nmutton kidney at Buckley’s. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. Better\na pork kidney at Dlugacz’s. While the kettle is boiling. She lapped\nslower, then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so rough? To\nlap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced round him.\nNo.",
        "On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by\nthe bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter\nshe likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.",
        "He said softly in the bare hall:",
        "–I’m going round the corner. Be back in a minute.",
        "And when he had heard his voice say it he added:",
        "–You don’t want anything for breakfast?",
        "A sleepy soft grunt answered:",
        "–Mn.",
        "No. She didn’t want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as\nshe turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled. Must\nget those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar. Forgotten any\nlittle Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for it. Old style.\nAh yes! of course. Bought it at the governor’s auction. Got a short\nknock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At Plevna that\nwas. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I’m proud of it. Still he had brains\nenough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was farseeing.",
        "His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and\nhis lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback\npictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.\nThe sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto’s high\ngrade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White slip of\npaper. Quite safe.",
        "On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there. In\nthe trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky wardrobe. No\nuse disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He pulled the\nhalldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped\ngently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right till I come\nback anyhow.",
        "He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number\nseventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church. Be a\nwarm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black\nconducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn’t go in\nthat light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as\nhe walked in happy warmth. Boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our\ndaily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.\nMakes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at\ndawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day’s march on him. Keep\nit up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a strand,\nstrange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old\nTweedy’s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear. Wander\nthrough awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of carpet\nshops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled\npipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented with fennel,\nsherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two. Well, meet\nhim. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among the pillars:\npriest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal, the\nevening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from her\ndoorway. She calls her children home in their dark language. High wall:\nbeyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly’s new\ngarters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of those instruments what do\nyou call them: dulcimers. I pass.",
        "Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track\nof the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself. What\nArthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the FREEMAN leader: a\nhomerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank\nof Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule sun\nrising up in the north-west.",
        "He approached Larry O’Rourke’s. From the cellar grating floated up the\nflabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out\nwhiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the end\nof the city traffic. For instance M’Auley’s down there: n. g. as\nposition. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from\nthe cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.",
        "Baldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an\nad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my\nbold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the\naproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him off\nto a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I’m going to tell\nyou? What’s that, Mr O’Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians, they’d\nonly be an eight o’clock breakfast for the Japanese.",
        "Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor\nDignam, Mr O’Rourke.",
        "Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the\ndoorway:",
        "–Good day, Mr O’Rourke.",
        "–Good day to you.",
        "–Lovely weather, sir.",
        "–’Tis all that.",
        "Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the county\nLeitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and behold,\nthey blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then thin of the\ncompetition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without\npassing a pub. Save it they can’t. Off the drunks perhaps. Put down three\nand carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs. On\nthe wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with the town\ntravellers. Square it you with the boss and we’ll split the job, see?",
        "How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels\nof stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint\nJoseph’s National school. Brats’ clamour. Windows open. Fresh air helps\nmemory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee\ndoubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At their\njoggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.",
        "He halted before Dlugacz’s window, staring at the hanks of sausages,\npolonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened in\nhis mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links, packed\nwith forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm\nbreath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood.",
        "A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He stood\nby the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too, calling the\nitems from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a pound and a\nhalf of Denny’s sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. Woods his\nname is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New blood. No followers\nallowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. She\ndoes whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.",
        "The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with\nblotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.",
        "He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at\nKinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter\nsanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round it,\nblurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting: read it\nnearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling. A\nyoung white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing\nin their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in\nhobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a\nripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their\nhands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his\nwill, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging, whack by\nwhack by whack.",
        "The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime\nsausages and made a red grimace.",
        "–Now, my miss, he said.",
        "She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.",
        "–Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,\nplease?",
        "Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went\nslowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the\nmorning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood\noutside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He sighed\ndown his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted toenails\ntoo. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The sting of\ndisregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For another: a\nconstable off duty cuddling her in Eccles lane. They like them sizeable.\nPrime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I’m lost in the wood.",
        "–Threepence, please.",
        "His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.\nThen it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them on\nthe rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc\nby disc, into the till.",
        "–Thank you, sir. Another time.",
        "A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze\nafter an instant. No: better not: another time.",
        "–Good morning, he said, moving away.",
        "–Good morning, sir.",
        "No sign. Gone. What matter?",
        "He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:\nplanters’ company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government\nand plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel and\nconstruction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa. You\npay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives,\noranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial\nirrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your name entered\nfor life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten down and the\nbalance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W. 15.",
        "Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.",
        "He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered\nolivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in\njars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows\nthe taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons\ntoo. Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin’s parade. And Mastiansky\nwith the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in Citron’s\nbasketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to\nthe nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild\nperfume. Always the same, year after year. They fetched high prices too,\nMoisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times. Must\nbe without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar,\nMediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap\nticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled\ndungarees. There’s whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do you? Doesn’t see. Chap\nyou know just to salute bit of a bore. His back is like that Norwegian\ncaptain’s. Wonder if I’ll meet him today. Watering cart. To provoke the\nrain. On earth as it is in heaven.",
        "A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.",
        "No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead\nsea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift those\nwaves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it\nraining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead\nnames. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore the\noldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy’s, clutching a\nnaggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far away over all\nthe earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born\neverywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old\nwoman’s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.",
        "Desolation.",
        "Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned\ninto Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins,\nchilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I am here\nnow. Yes, I am here now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong side of\nthe bed. Must begin again those Sandow’s exercises. On the hands down.\nBlotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why is that?\nValuation is only twenty-eight. Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur:\nparlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore eye. To smell\nthe gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her\nample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.",
        "Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim\nsandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a\ngirl with gold hair on the wind.",
        "Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered\nthem. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand.\nMrs Marion.",
        "–Poldy!",
        "Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm\nyellow twilight towards her tousled head.",
        "–Who are the letters for?",
        "He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.",
        "–A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And a\nletter for you.",
        "He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her\nknees.",
        "–Do you want the blind up?",
        "Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her\nglance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.",
        "–That do? he asked, turning.",
        "She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.",
        "–She got the things, she said.",
        "He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly\nwith a snug sigh.",
        "–Hurry up with that tea, she said. I’m parched.",
        "–The kettle is boiling, he said.",
        "But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled\nlinen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.",
        "As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:",
        "–Poldy!",
        "–What?",
        "–Scald the teapot.",
        "On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and\nrinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the\nkettle then to let the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took off\nthe kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump\nof butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed\nhungrily against him. Give her too much meat she won’t mouse. Say they\nwon’t eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her\nand dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper. He\nsprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.",
        "Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks:\nnew tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s\nseaside girls.",
        "The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown",
        "Derby, smiling. Silly Milly’s birthday gift. Only five she was then. No,\nwait: four. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces of\nfolded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.",
        "    O, MILLY BLOOM, YOU ARE MY DARLING.\n    YOU ARE MY LOOKINGGLASS FROM NIGHT TO MORNING.\n    I’D RATHER HAVE YOU WITHOUT A FARTHING\n    THAN KATEY KEOGH WITH HER ASS AND GARDEN.",
        "Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous\nold chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And the\nlittle mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into the\nparlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat! All we laughed.\nSex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.",
        "He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the\nteapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it?\nBread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it\nupstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.",
        "Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on\nthe chair by the bedhead.",
        "–What a time you were! she said.",
        "She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on\nthe pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft\nbubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder. The warmth of\nher couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea\nshe poured.",
        "A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the act\nof going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.",
        "–Who was the letter from? he asked.",
        "Bold hand. Marion.",
        "–O, Boylan, she said. He’s bringing the programme.",
        "–What are you singing?",
        "–LA CI DAREM with J. C. Doyle, she said, and LOVE’S OLD SWEET SONG.",
        "Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves\nnext day. Like foul flowerwater.",
        "–Would you like the window open a little?",
        "She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:",
        "–What time is the funeral?",
        "–Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn’t see the paper.",
        "Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled\ndrawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a\nstocking: rumpled, shiny sole.",
        "–No: that book.",
        "Other stocking. Her petticoat.",
        "–It must have fell down, she said.",
        "He felt here and there. VOGLIO E NON VORREI. Wonder if she pronounces\nthat right: VOGLIO. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped and\nlifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the\norangekeyed chamberpot.",
        "–Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There’s a word I wanted to ask\nyou.",
        "She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having\nwiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text\nwith the hairpin till she reached the word.",
        "–Met him what? he asked.",
        "–Here, she said. What does that mean?",
        "He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.",
        "–Metempsychosis?",
        "–Yes. Who’s he when he’s at home?",
        "–Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It’s Greek: from the Greek. That\nmeans the transmigration of souls.",
        "–O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.",
        "He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same young eyes. The\nfirst night after the charades. Dolphin’s Barn. He turned over the\nsmudged pages. RUBY: THE PRIDE OF THE RING. Hello. Illustration. Fierce\nItalian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked.\nSheet kindly lent. THE MONSTER MAFFEI DESISTED AND FLUNG HIS VICTIM FROM\nHIM WITH AN OATH. Cruelty behind it all. Doped animals. Trapeze at\nHengler’s. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping. Break your neck and\nwe’ll break our sides. Families of them. Bone them young so they\nmetamspychosis. That we live after death. Our souls. That a man’s soul\nafter he dies. Dignam’s soul ...",
        "–Did you finish it? he asked.",
        "–Yes, she said. There’s nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with the\nfirst fellow all the time?",
        "–Never read it. Do you want another?",
        "–Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock’s. Nice name he has.",
        "She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.",
        "Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they’ll write to\nKearney, my guarantor. Reincarnation: that’s the word.",
        "–Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body\nafter death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That we\nall lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other\nplanet. They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their past\nlives.",
        "The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Bette remind\nher of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An example?",
        "The BATH OF THE NYMPH over the bed. Given away with the Easter number of\nPHOTO BITS: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea before you put milk\nin. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three and six I gave for\nthe frame. She said it would look nice over the bed. Naked nymphs:\nGreece: and for instance all the people that lived then.",
        "He turned the pages back.",
        "–Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They\nused to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for\ninstance. What they called nymphs, for example.",
        "Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her,\ninhaling through her arched nostrils.",
        "–There’s a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?",
        "–The kidney! he cried suddenly.",
        "He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes\nagainst the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping\nhastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs. Pungent smoke shot\nup in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of the\nfork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.\nOnly a little burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the\nscanty brown gravy trickle over it.",
        "Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. He\nshore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a forkful\ninto his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. Done\nto a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one\nin the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that about some young\nstudent and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side, reading it\nslowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and\nraising it to his mouth.",
        "    Dearest Papli",
        "Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me\nsplendid. Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got mummy’s\nIovely box of creams and am writing.

        "Your fond daughter,     MILLY.",

While his eyes still read\nblandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his\nright hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning.\nUnder their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather\nheadband inside his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down\ninto the bowl of his hat.

Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in DOLCE FAR NIENTE, not\ndoing a hand’s turn all day. Sleep six months out of twelve. Too hot to\nquarrel. Influence of the climate. Lethargy. Flowers of idleness. The air\nfeeds most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic gardens. Sensitive plants.\nWaterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness in the air. Walk on\nroseleaves. Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. Where was the chap I\nsaw in that picture somewhere? Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his\nback, reading a book with a parasol open. Couldn’t sink if you tried: so\nthick with salt. Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the\nbody in the water is equal to the weight of the what?

Then the\nnext one: a small old woman. The priest bent down to put it into her\nmouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next one. Shut your eyes and\nopen your mouth. What? CORPUS: body. Corpse. Good idea the Latin.\nStupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They don’t seem to chew it:\nonly swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse. Why the cannibals\ncotton to it.",

There’s a big\nidea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel. First\ncommunicants. Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one family party,\nsame in the theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I’m sure of that. Not\nso lonely. In our confraternity. Then come out a bit spreeish. Let off\nsteam. Thing is if you really believe in it.

Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit\nthick. What kind of voice is it? Must be curious to hear after their own\nstrong basses. Connoisseurs.

        "They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were\npassing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels\nrattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook\nrattling in the doorframes.",

Just a chance. Must have been that\nmorning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs\nat it by the wall of the cease to do evil.

Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles.\nFlaxseed tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don’t\nmiss this chance. Dogs’ home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,\nLeopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave. A\ndying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men’s dogs\nusually are.",
        "A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of\nshower spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a\ncolander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.",
        "–The weather is changing, he said quietly.",
        "–A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.",
        "–Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There’s the sun again coming out.",
        "Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun,\nhurled a mute curse at the sky.",
        "–It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said.",
        "–We’re off again.",
        "The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed\ngently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.",
        "–Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking\nhim off to his face.",
        "–O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear him,\nSimon, on Ben Dollard’s singing of THE CROPPY BOY.",
        "–Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. HIS SINGING OF THAT SIMPLE\nBALLAD, MARTIN, IS THE MOST TRENCHANT RENDERING I EVER HEARD IN THE WHOLE\nCOURSE OF MY EXPERIENCE.",
        "–Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He’s dead nuts on that. And the\nretrospective arrangement.",
        "–Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech? Martin Cunningham asked.",
        "–I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?",
        "–In the paper this morning.",
        "Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must\nchange for her.",
        "–No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.",
        "Mr Bloom’s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the\ndeaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what\nPeake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s? no, Sexton,\nUrbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.\nThanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of\nhis. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month’s mind: Quinlan.\nOn whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.",
        "    IT IS NOW A MONTH SINCE DEAR HENRY FLED\n    TO HIS HOME UP ABOVE IN THE SKY\n    WHILE HIS FAMILY WEEPS AND MOURNS HIS LOSS\n    HOPING SOME DAY TO MEET HIM ON HIGH.",
        "I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it in\nthe bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry fled.\nBefore my patience are exhausted.",
        "National school. Meade’s yard. The hazard. Only two there now.\nNodding. Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting\nround with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised\ntheir hats.",
        "A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a\ntramway standard by Mr Bloom’s window. Couldn’t they invent something\nautomatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow\nwould lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job\nmaking the new invention?",
