        "Unless you have a definite order to write a one-act musical comedy,\nit would seem, from the comparatively small part the writer has\nin the final effect, that the novice had better not write the\nmusical comedy at all.  Although this would appear to be clear\nfrom the discussion of the elements in the preceding chapter, I\nwant to make it even more emphatic by saying that more than once\nI have written a musical comedy act for the “small time” in a few\nhours–and have then spent weeks dovetailing it to fit the musical\nnumbers introduced and whipping the whole act into the aspect of\na “production.”",
        "But there is one time when even the amateur may write a musical\ncomedy–when he has a great idea.  But I do not mean the average\nmusical comedy idea–I mean such an idea as that which made “The\nNaked Truth” so successful.  And in the hope that you may possess\nsuch an idea, I offer a few hints that may prove helpful in casting\nyour idea into smooth musical comedy form.",
        "As I have already discussed plot in the chapters devoted to the\nplaylet, and have taken up the structure of the monologue and the\ntwo-act in the chapters on those forms, there is now no need for\nconsidering “writing” at all save for a single hint.  Yet even\nthis one suggestion deals less with the formal “writing” element\nthan with the “feel” of the material.  It is stated rather humorously\nby Thomas J. Gray, who has written many successful one-act musical\ncomedies, varying in style from “Gus Edwards’ School Boys and\nGirls” to “The Vaudeville Revue of 1915\"–a musical travesty on\nprevailing ideas–and the books of a few long musical successes,\nfrom comedy scenes in “Watch your Step” to “Ned Wayburn’s Town\nTopics,” that “Musical comedy, from a vaudeville standpoint, and\na ’Broadway’ or two-dollar standpoint, are two different things.\nA writer has to treat them in entirely different ways, as a doctor\nwould two different patients suffering from the same ailment.  In\nvaudeville an author has to remember that nearly everyone in the\naudience has some one particular favorite on the bill–you have\nto write something funny enough to:  please the admirers of the\nacrobat, the magician, the dancer, the dramatic artist, the rag-time\nsinger and the moving pictures.  But in ’Broadway’ musical comedy\nit is easier to please the audiences because they usually know\nwhat the show is about before they buy their tickets, and they\nknow what to expect.  That’s why you can tell ’vaudeville stuff’\nin a ’Broadway’ show–it’s the lines the audience laugh at.",
        "“To put it in a different way, let me say that while in two-dollar\nmusical comedy you can get by with ’smart lines’ and snickers, in\nvaudeville musical comedy you have to go deeper than the lip-laughter.\nYou must waken the laughter that lies deep down and rises in\nappreciative roars.  It is in ability to create situations that\nwill produce this type of laughter that the one-act musical comedy\nwriter’s success lies.”",
        "While it is not absolutely necessary to open a musical comedy with\nan ensemble number, many fine acts do so open.  And the ensemble\nfinish seems to be the rule.  Therefore let us assume that you\nwish to form your musical comedy on this usual style.  As your act\nshould run anywhere from thirty to fifty minutes, and as your\nopening number will consume scarcely two minutes, and your closing\nensemble perhaps three, you have–on a thirty-five minute basis–\nthirty minutes in which to bring in your third ensemble, your other\nmusical numbers and your dialogue.",
        "The third ensemble–probably a chorus number, with the tenor or\nthe ingenue, or both, working in front of the chorus–will consume\nanywhere from five to seven minutes.  Then your solo will take\nabout three minutes.  And if you have a duet or a trio, count four\nminutes more.  So you have about eighteen minutes for your plot\nand comedy–including specialties.",
        "While these time hints are obviously not exact, they are suggestive\nof the fact that you should time everything which enters into your\nact.  And having timed your musical elements by some such rough\nstandard as this–or, better still, by slowly reading your lyrics\nas though you were singing–you should set down for your own\nguidance a schedule that will look something like this:",
        "    Opening ensemble............. 2 minutes",
        "    Dialogue\n       Introducing Plot,\n       First Comedy Scenes....... 4   “",
        "    Solo......................... 3   “",
        "    Dialogue\n       Comedy and Specialties.... 5   “",
        "    Ensemble number.............. 5   “",
        "    Dialogue\n       Specialties, Comedy.\n       Plot climax–perhaps\n       a “big” love scene,\n       leading into.............. 7   “",
        "    Duet......................... 4   “",
        "    Dialogue\n       Plot Solution–the\n       final arrangement\n       of characters............. 2   “",
        "    Closing ensemble............. 3   “\n                                 ________\n                                 35   “",
        "Of course this imaginary schedule is not the only schedule that\ncan be used; also bear firmly in mind that you may make any\narrangement of your elements that you desire, within the musical\ncomedy form.  Let me repeat what I am never tired of saying, that\na rigid adherence to any existing form of vaudeville act is as\nlikely to be disastrous as a too wild desire to be original.  Be\nas unconventional as you can be within the necessary conventional\nlimits.  This is the way to success.",
        "You have your big idea, and you have the safe, conventional ensemble\nopening, or a semi-ensemble novelty opening.  Also you have a solo\nnumber for the tenor or the ingenue, with the chorus working behind\nthem.  Finally you have your ensemble ending.  Now, within these\nboundaries, arrange your solo and duet–or dispense with them, as\nyou feel best fits your plot and your comedy.  Develop your story\nby comedy situations–don’t depend upon lines.  Place your big\nscene in the last big dialogue space–the seven minutes of the\nforegoing schedule–and then bring your act to an end with a great\nbig musical finish.",
        "Although the schedule given allows plenty of time for costume\nchanges, you must not consider your schedule as a ready-made\nformula.  Read it and learn the lesson it points out–then cast\nit aside.  Test every minute of your act by the test of time.  Be\nespecially careful to give your chorus and your principal characters\ntime to make costume changes.",
        "In gauging the minutes these changes will take, time yourself in\nmaking actual changes of clothing.  Remember that you must allow\none minute to get to the dressing room and return to the stage.\nBut do not make the mistake of supposing that the first test you\nmake in changing your own clothes will be the actual time it will\ntake experienced dressers to change.  You yourself can cut down\nyour time record by practice–and your clothes are not equipped\nwith time-saving fasteners.  Furthermore, it often happens that\nthe most complicated dress is worn in the first scene and a very\nquick change is prepared for by under-dressing–that is, wearing\nsome of the garments of the next change under the pretentious\nover-garments of the preceding scene.  These are merely stripped\noff and the person is ready dressed to go back on the stage in\nhalf a minute.",
        "But precise exactness in costume changes need not worry you very\nmuch.  If you have been reasonably exact, the producer–upon whom\nthe costume changes and the costumes themselves depend–will add\na minute of dialogue here or take away a minute there, to make the\nact run as it should.",
        "Certain songs lend themselves more readily to effective staging,\nand these are called “production songs.”  For instance:  “Alexander’s\nRagtime Band” could be–and often was–put on with a real band.\nThe principal character could sing the first verse and the chorus\nalone.  Then the chorus girls could come out in regimentals, each\none “playing” some instrument–the music faked by the orchestra\nor produced by “zobos\"–and when they were all on the stage, the\nchorus could be played again with rousing effect.  During the\nsecond verse, sung as a solo, the girls could act out the lines.\nThen with the repetitioin of the chorus, they could produce funny\ncharacteristic effects on the instruments.  And then they could\nall exit–waiting for the audience to bring them back for the\nnovelties the audience would expect to be introduced in an encore.",
        "This is often the way a “popular song” is “plugged” in cabarets,\nmusical comedies, burlesque, and in vaudeville.  It is made so\nattractive that it is repeated again and again–and so drummed\ninto the ears of the audience that they go out whistling it.  Ned\nWayburn demonstrated this in his vaudeville act “Staging an Act.\"\nHe took a commonplace melody and built it up into a production–then\nthe audience liked it.  George Cohan did precisely the same thing\nin his “Hello, Broadway\"; taking a silly lyric and a melody, he\ntold the audience he was going to make ’em like it; and he did–by\n\"producing it.”",
        "But not every “popular song” lends itself to production treatment.\nFor instance, how would you go about producing “When it Strikes\nHome”?  How would you stage “When I Lost You”?  Or–to show you\nthat serious songs are not the only ones that may not be producible–\nhow would you put on “Oh, How that German Could Love”?  Of course you\ncould bring the chorus on in couples and have them sing such a\nsentimental song to each other–but that would not, in the fullest\nsense, be producing it.",
        "Just as not every “popular song” can be produced, so not every\nproduction song can be made popular.  You have never whistled that\nsong produced in “Staging an Act,” nor have you ever whistled\nCohan’s song from “Hello, Broadway.”  If they ever had any names\nI have forgotten them, but the audience liked them immensely at\nthe time.",
        "As many production songs are good only for stage purposes, and\ntherefore are not a source of much financial profit to their\nwriters, there is no need for me to describe their special differences\nand the way to go about writing them.  Furthermore, their elements\nare precisely the same as those of any other song–with the exception\nthat each chorus is fitted with different catch lines in the place\nof the regular punch lines, and there may be any number of different\nverses. [1] Now having your “big\" idea, and having built it up\nwith your musical elements carefully spaced to allow for costume\nchanges, perhaps having made your comedy rise out of the monologue\nand the two-act to good plot advantage, and having developed your\nstory to its climax in the last part of your act, you assemble all\nyour people, join the loose plot ends and bring your musical comedy\nto a close with a rousing ensemble finish.",
        "[1] See Chapter XXII.",
        "The word “tab” is vaudeville’s way of saying “tabloid,” or condensed\nversion.  While vaudeville is in itself a series of tabloid\nentertainments, “tab” is used to identify the form of a musical\ncomedy act which may run longer than the average one-act musical\ncomedy.  Although a tabloid is almost invariably in one act, it\nis hardly ever in only one scene.  There are usually several\ndifferent sets used, and the uninterrupted forty-five minutes, or\neven more than an hour, are designed to give a greater effect of\nbigness to the production.",
        "But the greatest difference between the one-act musical comedy and\nthe burlesque tab does not lie in playing-time, nor bigness of\neffect.  While a one-act musical comedy is usually intended to be\nmade up of carefully joined and new humorous situations, the\nburlesque tab–you will recall the definition of burlesque–depends\nupon older and more crude humor.",
        "James Madison, whose “My Old Kentucky Home” [1] has been chosen\nas showing clearly the elements peculiar to the burlesque tab,\ndescribes the difference in this way:",
        "“Burlesque does not depend for success upon smoothly joined plot,\nmusical numbers or pictorial effects.  Neither does it depend upon\nlines.  Making its appeal particularly to those who like their\nhumor of the elemental kind, the burlesque tab often uses slap-stick\ncomedy methods.  Frankly acknowledging this, vaudeville burlesque\nnevertheless makes a clean appeal.  It does not countenance either\nword or gesture that could offend.  Since its purpose is to raise\nuproarious laughter, it does not take time to smooth the changes\nfrom one comedy bit to the next, but one bit follows another\nswiftly, with the frankly avowed purpose to amuse, and to amuse\nfor the moment only.  Finally, the burlesque tab comes to an end\nswiftly:  it has made use of a plot merely for the purpose of\nstringing on comedy bits, and having come toward the close, it\nboldly states that fact, as it were, by a swift rearrangement of\ncharacters–and then ends.”",
        "[1] See the Appendix",
        "While the burlesque tab nearly always opens with an ensemble number,\nand almost invariably ends with an ensemble, there may be more\nsolos, duets, trios, quartets and ensembles than are used by the\nmusical comedy–if the act is designed to run for a longer time.\nBut as its appeal is made by humor rather than by musical or\npictorial effect, the burlesque tab places the emphasis on the\nhumor.  It does this by giving more time to comedy and by making\nits comedy more elemental, more uproarious.",
        "In a burlesque tab, the comedy bits are never barred by age–providing\nthey are sure-fire–and therefore they are sometimes reminiscent.\n[2] The effort to give them freshness and newness is to relate the\nhappenings to different characters, and to introduce the bits in\nnovel ways.",
        "[2] Mr. Madison informed me that the “statuary bit” in “My Old\nKentucky Home” is one of the oldest “bits” in the show business.\nIt is even older than Weber and Field’s first use of it a generation\nago.",
        "Therefore, it would seem obvious that the writing of the burlesque\ntab is not “writing” at all.  It is stage managing.  And as the\ncomedy bits are in many cases parts of the history of the\nstage–written down in the memories of actor and producer–the\nnovice had better not devote his thoughts to writing burlesque.\nHowever, if he can produce bits of new business that will be\nsure-fire, he may find the burlesque tab for him the most profitable\nof all opportunities the vaudeville stage has to offer.  That,\nhowever, is a rare condition for the beginner.",
        "The easiest thing in the world is to write a song; the most\ndifficult, to write a song that will be popular.  I do not mean a\n\"popular” song, but a song everybody will whistle–for few songs\nwritten for the populace really become songs of the people.  The\ndifference between poverty and opulence in the business of\nsong-writing is–whistling.",
        "What is the difference, then, between the man who can “write songs\"\nand the one who can write songs everybody will whistle?  Wherein\nlies the magic?  Here is the difference, unexplained it is true,\nbut at least clearly stated:",
        "There are hundreds of men and women all over the land who can rhyme\nwith facility.  Anyone of them can take almost any idea you suggest\noff hand, and on the instant sing you a song that plays up that\nidea.  These persons are the modern incarnations of the old time\nminstrels who wandered over the land and sang extemporaneous ditties\nin praise of their host for their dinners.  But, remarkable as the\ngift is, many of these modern minstrels cannot for the life of\nthem put into their songs that something which makes their hearers\nwhistle it long after they leave.  The whistle maker is the one\nwho can rhyme with perhaps no more ease than these others, but\ninto his song he is able to instil the magic–sometimes.",
        "But what is this magic that makes of song-writing a mystery that\neven the genius cannot unerringly solve each time he tries?  Not\nfor one moment would I have you believe that I can solve the mystery\nfor you.  If I could, I should not be writing this chapter–I\nshould be writing a song that could not fail of the greatest sale\nin history.  Still, with the kind assistance of the gentlemen in\nthe profession–as the prestidigitator used to say in the old town\nhall when he began his entertainment–I may be able to lift the\nouter veils of the unknown, and you may be able I to face the\nproblem with clearer-seeing eyes.",
        "I called for help first from Irving Berlin, without doubt the most\nsuccessful popular song writer this country has ever known; then\nthe assistance of phenomenally successful writers of such diverse\ngenius as Charles K. Harris, L. Wolfe Gilbert, Ballard MacDonald,\nJoe McCarthy, Stanley Murphy, and Anatol Friedland, was asked and\nfreely given.  It is from their observations, as well as from my\nown, that the following elements of the art of whistle-making have\nbeen gathered.",
        "Although we are interested only in the lyrics of the popular song,\nwe must first consider the music, for the lyric writer is very\noften required to write words to music that has already been\nwritten.  Therefore he must know the musical elements of his\nproblem.",
        "Think of any popular song-hit, and while you are recollecting just\n\"how it goes,” stand back from yourself  and watch your mental\nprocesses.  The words of the title first pop into your mind, do\nthey not?  Then do not you find yourself whistling that part of\nthe music fitted to those words?  Conversely, if the music comes\ninto your mind first, the words seem to sing themselves.  Now see\nif the bars of music you remember and whistle first are not the\nnotes fitted to the title.",
        "If these observations are correct, we have not only proof of the\ninseparable quality of the words and the music of a popular song,\nbut also evidence to which you can personally testify regarding\nthe foundations of lyric-writing.",
        "But first let us hear what Berlin has to say about the inseparable\nquality of words and music:  “The song writer who writes both words\nand music, has the advantage over the lyric writer who must fit\nhis words to somebody else’s music and the composer who must make\nhis music fit someone else’s words.  Latitude–the mother of\nnovelty–is denied them, and in consequence both lyrics and melody\nsuffer.  Since I write both words and music, I can compose them\ntogether and make them fit.  I sacrifice one for the other.  If I\nhave a melody I want to use, I plug away at the lyrics until I\nmake them fit the best parts of my music, and vice versa.  “For\ninstance:  ’In My Harem’ first came to me from the humorous possibility\nthat the Greeks, who at that time were fighting with the Turks,\nmight be the cause of a lot of harems running loose in Turkey.  I\ntried to fit that phrase to a melody, but I couldn’t.  At last I\ngot a melody; something that sounded catchy; a simple ’dum-te-de-dum.’\nI had it,",
        "                      In my harem,\n                      In my harem.",
        "“With ’Ragtime Violin’ I had the phrase and no music.  I got a few\nbars to fit, then the melody made a six-syllable and then a\nfive-syllable passage necessary.  I had it:",
        "                 Fiddle up!  Fiddle up!\n                     On your violin.",
        "“The lyric of a song must sing the music and the music sing the\nwords.”",
        "Charles K. Harris, who wrote the great popular success, “After the\nBall,” so far back in the early days of the popular song that some\nconsider this song the foundation of the present business, has\nfollowed it up with innumerable successes.  Mr. Harris has this\nto, say on the same point:",
        "“I believe it is impossible to collaborate with anyone in writing\na popular song.  I don’t believe one man can write the words and\nanother the music.  A man can’t put his heart in another’s lyrics\nor music.  To set a musical note for each word of a song is not\nall–the note must fit the word.”  But, while Mr. Harris’s words\nshould be considered as the expression of an authority, there is\nalso considerable evidence that points the other way.  Just to\nmention a few of the many partnerships which have resulted in\nnumerous successes, there are Williams and Van Alstyne, who followed\n\"Under the Shade of the Old Apple Tree” with a series of hits;\nBallard MacDonald and Harry Carroll, who made “On the Trail of the\nLonesome Pine” merely the first of a remarkably successful\nbrotherhood; Harry Von Tilzer with his ever varying collaborators,\nand L. Wolfe Gilbert, who wrote “Robert E. Lee,” “Hitchy Koo,\"\nand other hits, with Louis Muir, and then collaborated with Anatol\nFriedland and others in producing still other successes.  These\nfew examples out of many which might be quoted, show that two\npersons can collaborate in writing song-hits, but, in the main,\nas Mr. Berlin and Mr. Harris say, there are decided advantages\nwhen words and music can be done together by one writer.",
        "What is absolutely essential to the writing of songs which will\nmake the nation whistle, may be stated in this principle:",
        "The words and music of a song must fit each other so perfectly\nthat the thought of one is inseparable from the other.",
        "And now before we turn to the essential elements of the words, to\nwhich I shall devote the next chapter, permit me to name a few of\nthe elements of popular music that may be helpful to many modern\nminstrels to know.  In fact, these are all the suggestions on the\nwriting of popular music that I have been able to glean from many\nyears of curious inquiry.  I believe they represent practically,\nif not quite, all the hints that can be given on this subject. [1]",
        "[1] Because of the obvious impossibility of adequately discussing\nsyncopation and kindred purely technical elements, ragtime has not\nbeen particularly pointed out.  The elements here given are those\nthat apply to ragtime as well as to nearly every other sort of\npopular song.",
        "The popular song is introduced to the public by vaudeville performers,\ncabaret singers, and demonstrators, whose voices have not a wide\nrange.  Even some of the most successful vaudeville stars have not\nextraordinary voices.  Usually the vaudeville performer cannot\ncompass a range of much more than an octave.  The cabaret singer\nwho has command of more than seven notes is rare, and the demonstrator\nin the department store and the five-and ten-cent store usually\nhas a voice little better than the person who purchases.  Therefore\nthe composer of a song is restricted to the range of one octave.\nSometimes, it is true, a song is written in “one-one,” or even\n\"one-two” (one or two notes more than an octave), but even such\n\"rangey” songs make use of these notes only in the verses and\nconfine the chorus to a single octave.  But in the end, the necessity\nfor the composer’s writing his song within one octave to make an\neffective offering for his introducing singers, works out to his\nadvantage.  The average voice of an octave range is that possessed\nby those who buy popular songs to sing at home.",
        "Now here is a helpful hint and another bit of evidence from the\nmusic angle, to emphasize the necessity for the perfect fitting\nof words and music.  Let me state it as Berlin did, in an article\nwritten for the Green Book Magazine:",
        "“Melodies should go up on open vowels in the lyrics–A, I or O. E\nis half open and U is closed.  Going up on a closed vowel makes\nenunciation difficult.”",
        "Experience is the only thing warranted to convince beyond doubt,\nso test this rule on your own piano.  Then take down the most\npopular songs you have in your collection and measure them by it.",
        "As we shall see later, another definition of the popular song-hit\nmight be, “A song with a punch in the lyrics and a punch in the\nmusic.”  Berlin expressed the application to the problem of melody\nby the following:",
        "“In the ’International Rag,’ for example, I got my punch by means\nof my melody.  I used the triplet, the freak, from out of my bag\nof tricks:",
        "                   Raggedy melody,\n                   Full of originality.",
        "Anatol Friedland, who composed the music of “My Persian Rose,” and\nL. Wolfe Gilbert’s “My Little Dream Girl,” in discussing this\nquestion, said:",
        "“Ten notes may be the secret of a popular song success.  If I can\nmake my listeners remember ten notes of a song that’s all I ask.\nWhenever they hear these ten notes played they’ll say, ’That’s. . .,’\nand straightway they’ll begin to whistle it.  This is the\nmusic punch, and it depends on merit alone.  Now here’s one angle\nof the musical punch trick:",
        "“To make a punch more punchy still, we repeat it at least once,\nand sometimes oftener, in a song.  You may start your chorus with\nit, repeat it in the middle, or repeat it at the end.  Rarely is\nit repeated in the verse.  High-brow composers call it the theme.\nFor the popular song composer, it’s the punch.  Clever repetition\nthat makes the strain return with delightful satisfaction, is one\nof the tricks of the trade–as well as of the art of popular music.”",
        "If what Friedland says is so, and you may turn to your well-thumbed\npile of music for confirmation, the theme or the punch of popular\nmusic may prove the entire song.  I mean, that in its final sales\nanalysis, the magic bars are what count.  To carry this logical\nexamination still further, it is possible for a popular song to\nbe little more than theme.  As a musical theme is the underlying\nmelody out of which the variations are formed, it is possible to\nrepeat the theme so often that the entire song is little more than\nclever repetitions.",
        "One of the most common methods is to underlay a melody with what\nE. M. Wickes, [1] one of the keenest popular song critics of today,\ncalls the “internal vamp.”  This is the keeping of a melody so\nclosely within its possible octave that the variations play around\na very few notes.  Try on your piano this combination–D, E flat,\nand E natural, or F natural, with varying tempos, and you will\nrecognize many beginnings of different famous songs they represent.\nEither the verse of these songs starts off with this combination,\nor the chorus takes these notes for its beginning.  “Sweet Adeline\"\nand “On the Banks of the Wabash” are but two of the many famous\nsongs built on this foundation.  Of course, there are other\ncombinations.  These few combinations taken together might be\nconsidered as the popular idea of “easy music.”",
        "[1] Mr. Wickes has been contributing to The Writer’s Monthly a\nseries of valuable papers under the general caption, “Helps for\nSong Writers.”",
        "And now it is through the consideration of the importance of the\nvariations of the theme that we may come to an understanding of\nwhat, for the want of a better phrase, I shall call unexpected\npunches.",
        "The impossibility of adequately pointing out by words the specific\nexamples of what I mean in certain songs makes it necessary for\nme to direct you back to your own piano.  Run over a group of your\nfavorites and see how many musical punches you can find that are\nnot due directly to the theme.  Pick out the catchy variations in\na dozen songs–you may chance on one or two where the biggest punch\nis not in the theme.  Of course you may trace it all back to the\ntheme, but nevertheless it still stands out a distinct punch in\nthe variation.  If you can add this punch to your theme-punch,\nyour song success is assured.",
        "When Sol P. Levy, the composer of “Memories,” the “Dolly Dip\nDances,” and a score of better-class melodies, shared my office,\none of our sources of amusement was seeking the original themes\nfrom which the popular songs were made.  As Mr. Levy was arranging\nsongs for nearly all the big publishers, we had plenty of material\nwith which to play our favorite indoor sport.  It was a rare song,\nindeed, whose musical parent we could not ferret out.  Nearly all\nthe successful popular songs frankly owned themes that were favorites\nof other days–some were favorites long “before the war.”",
        "Berlin’s use of “Way down upon the Swanee River\"–\"played in\nragtime\"–for a musical punch in “Alexander’s Ragtime Band,” was\nnot the first free use of a theme of an old favorite for a punch,\nbut it was one of the first honestly frank uses.  The way he took\nMendelssohn’s “Spring Song” and worked it into as daring a “rag\"\nas he could achieve, is perhaps the most delightfully impudent,\n\"here-see-what-I-can-do,” spontaneously and honestly successful\n\"lift” ever perpetrated.  Berlin has “ragged” some of the most\nperfect themes of grand opera with wonderful success, but not\nalways so openly.  And other composers have done the same thing.",
        "The usual method is to take some theme that is filled with memories\nand make it over into a theme that is just enough like the familiar\ntheme to be haunting.  This is the one secret or trick of the\npopular song trade that has been productive of more money than\nperhaps any other.",
        "This lifting of themes is not plagiarism in the strict sense in\nwhich a solemn court of art-independence would judge it.  Of course\nit is well within that federal law which makes the copyrightable\npart of any piece of music as wide open as a barn door, for you\nknow you can with “legal honesty” steal the heart of any song, if\nyou are “clever” enough, and want it.  The average popular song\nwriter who makes free use of another composer’s melody, doubtless\nwould defend his act with the argument that he is not writing\n\"serious music,” only melodies for the passing hour and therefore\nthat he ought to be permitted the artistic license of weaving into\nhis songs themes that are a part of the melodic life of the day.\n[1] But, although some song writers contend for the right of free\nuse, they are usually the first to cry “stop thief” when another\ncomposer does the same thing to them.  However, dismissing the\nethics of this matter, right here there lies a warning, not of art\nor of law, but for your own success.",
        "[1] An interesting article discussing the harm such tactics have\ndone the popular song business is to be found over the signature\nof Will Rossiter in the New York Star for March 1, 1913.",
        "Never lift a theme of another popular song.  Never use a lifted\ntheme of any song–unless you can improve on it.  And even then\nnever try to hide a theme in your melody as your own–follow Mr.\nBerlin’s method, if you can, and weave it frankly into your music.",
        "Now, to sum up all that has been said on the music of the popular\nsong:  While it is an advantage for one man to write both the words\nand music of a song, it is not absolutely essential; what is\nessential is that the words and music fit each other so perfectly\nthat the thought of one is inseparable from the other.  One octave\nis the range in which popular music should be written.  Melodies\nshould go up on open vowels in the lyrics.  A “punch” should be\nput in the music wherever possible.  Punch is sometimes secured\nby the trick of repetition in the chorus, as well as at the beginning\nand end.  The theme may be and usually is the punch, but in the\nvariations there may be punches not suggested by the theme.  Themes,\nsemi-classical, or even operatic, or punches of old favorites may\nbe used–but not those of other popular songs–and then it is best\nto use them frankly.",
        "To state all this in one concise sentence permit me to hazard the\nfollowing:",
        "The music-magic of the popular song lies in a catchy theme stated\nat, or close to, the very beginning, led into clever variations\nthat round back at least once and maybe twice into the original\ntheme, and finishing with the theme–which was a punch of intrinsic\nmerit, made stronger by a repetition that makes it positively\nhaunting.",
        "One question about song-writing is often asked but will never be\nsettled:  Which is more important, the music or the words?  Among\nthe publishers with whom I have discussed this question is Louis\nBernstein, of Shapiro, Bernstein & Co.  He summed up what all the\nother publishers and song-writers I have known have said:",
        "“A great melody may carry a poor lyric to success, and a great\nlyric may carry a poor melody; but for a song to become widely\npopular you must have both a great melody and a great lyric.”",
        "This is but another way of stating the fact noted in the preceding\nchapter, that the words and music of a popular song-hit are\nindivisible.  And yet Mr. Bernstein gives an authoritative reply\nto the question with which this chapter opens.",
        "Charles K. Harris put it in another way.  Referring particularly\nto the ballad–and to the particular style of ballad that has made\nhim famous–he said:",
        "“The way to the whistling lips is always through the heart.  Reach\nthe heart through your lyrics, and the lips will whistle the emotion\nvia the melody.  When the heart has not been touched by the lyric,\nthe lips will prove rebellious.  They may, indeed, whistle the\nmelody once, even twice, but it takes more than that to make a\nsong truly popular.  A catchy tune is not sufficient in itself.\nIt goes far, it is true, but it will not go the entire distance\nof popularity, or even two-thirds of the distance, unless it is\naccompanied by a catchy lyric.”",
        "You may read into this a leaning toward the lyric, if you like.\nAnd it might be better if you did, for you would then realize that\nyour part of a popular song must be as “great” as you can make it.\nBut whatever may be your opinion, it does not alter the fact that\nboth Mr. Harris and Mr. Bernstein have pointed out–catchy words\nare needed as much as catchy melody.  And permit me to say very\nhumbly that personally I have no leaning toward the musical one\nof the twins:  my reason for discussing first the musical elements,\nis that a lyric writer often is called on to fit words to music,\nand because an understanding of the musical elements forms a fine\nfoundation for an easy, and therefore a quick, dissection of the\npopular song–that is all.",
        "In its original meaning, a lyric is verse designed to be sung to\nthe accompaniment of music.  Nowadays lyrical poetry is verse in\nwhich the poet’s personal emotions are strongly shown.  Popular\nsong-lyrics especially are not only designed to be sung, but are\nverses that show a great deal of emotion–any kind of emotion.\nBut remember this point:  Whatever and how great soever may be the\nemotion striving for expression, the words designed to convey it\ndo not become lyrics until the emotion is shown, and shown in a\nsort of verse which we shall presently examine.  If you convey\nemotion, your words may be worth thousands of dollars.  If you\nfail to convey it, they will be only a sad joke.",
        "As illustrations of this vital point, and to serve as examples for\nthe examination of the elements of the popular lyric, read the\nwords of the following famous songs; and while you are reading\nthem you will see vividly how music completes the lyric.  Stripped\nof its music, a popular song-lyric is often about as attractive\nas an ancient actress after she has taken off all the make-up that\nin the setting of the stage made her look like a girl.  Words with\nmusic become magically one, the moving expression of the emotion\nof their day.",

And furthermore, while two different choruses are\nsometimes used in popular songs, the common practice is to use but\none chorus.",
        "Now let us see the reason for a peculiarity that must have struck\nyou in reading these lyrics.",
        "Metre is the arrangement of emphatic and unemphatic syllables in\nverse on a measured plan, and is attained by the use of short\nsyllables of speech varied in different rotations by long syllables.\nThe metrical character of English poetry depends upon the recurrence\nof similarly accented syllables at short and more or less regular\nintervals.  Let us take this as the definition of what I mean by\nmetre in the few sentences in which I shall use the word.",
        "Among recognized poets there has always been a rather strict\nadherence to regularity of form.  Indeed, at times in the history\nof literature, poetry, to be considered poetry, had to confine\nitself to an absolutely rigid form.  In such periods it has been\nas though the poet were presented with a box, whose depth and\nbreadth and height could not be altered, and were then ordered to\nfill it full of beautiful thoughts expressed in beautiful words,\nand to fill it exactly, or be punished by having his work considered\nbad.",
        "In ages past this rigidity of rule used to apply to the song-poet\nalso, although the minstrel has always been permitted more latitude\nthan other poets.  To-day, however, the poet of the popular song\nmay write in any measure his fancy dictates, and he may make his\nmetre as regular or as irregular as he wishes.  He may do anything\nhe wants, in a song.  Certainly, his language need not be either\nexact or “literary.”  Practically all that is demanded is that his\nlyrics convey emotion.  The song-poet’s license permits a world\nof metrical and literary sinning.  I am not either apologizing for\nor praising this condition–I am simply stating a proved fact.",
        "Even without “scanning” the lyrics of the eleven songs you have\njust read their irregularity of metre is plain.  It is so plain\nthat some of the irregularities rise up and smite your ears.  This\nis why some popular songs seem so “impossible” without their music.\nAnd the reason why they seem so pleasing with their music is that\nthe music takes the place of regularity with delightful satisfaction.\nThe very irregularity is what often gives the composer his opportunity\nto contribute melodious punches, for the words of a popular song\nare a series of catchy phrases.  In some cases irregularity in a\nsong may be the crowning virtue that spells success.",
        "There is no need to point to specific examples of the lack of\nregularity in the recurrence of rhymes in most of the lyric specimens\nhere printed, or in other famous songs.  Nor is there any necessity\nto instance the obvious lack of precise rhyming.  Neither of these\npoetic qualities has ever been a virtue of the average popular\nsong-poet.",
        "So far as the vital necessities of the popular song go, rhymes may\noccur regularly or irregularly, with fine effect in either instance,\nand the rhymes may be precise or not.  To rhyme moon with June\nis not unforgivable.  The success of a popular song depends on\nentirely different bases.  Nevertheless, a finely turned bit of\nrhyming harmony may strike the ear and stand out from its fellows\nlike a lovely symphony of fancy.  If you have given any attention\nto this point of rhyming you can recall many instances of just\nwhat I mean.",
        "If you can be regular and if you can be precise in the use of\nrhymes in your song-poem, be regular and be precise.  Don’t be\nirregular and slovenly just because others have been and succeeded.\nYou will not succeed if you build your lyrics on the faults and\nnot on the virtues of others.  The song-poem that gleams like a\nflawless gem will have a wider and more lasting success–all other\nthings being equal.",
        "On the other hand, it is absolutely fatal to strive for regularity\nand precision, and thereby lose expression.  If you have to choose,\nchoose irregularity and faulty rhymes.  This is an important bit\nof advice, for a song-poem is not criticized for its regularity\nand precision–it is either taken to heart and loved in spite of\nits defects, or is forgotten as valueless.  As Winifred Black wrote\nof her child, “I love her not for her virtues, but oh, for the\nendearing little faults that make her what she is.”",
        "Reference to the lyrics already instanced will show you that they\nare written in various measures.  And while it is foreign to my\npurpose to discuss such purely technical points of poetry, [1]\npermit me to direct your attention to a few points of song measure.",
        "[1] The Art of Versification, by J. Berg Esenwein and Mary Eleanor\nRoberts–one of the volumes in “The Writer’s Library\"–covers this\nsubject with a thoroughness it would be useless for me to attempt.\nTherefore if you wish to take this subject up more in detail, I\nrefer you to this excellent book.",
        "An individual poetic measure is attained by the use of metre in a\ncertain distinct way.  Because the normal combinations of the\nemphatic and the unemphatic syllables of the English language are\nbut five, there are only five different poetic measures.  Let us\nnow see how an investigation of the bafflingly unexact measures\nof our examples will yield–even though their irregular natures\nwill not permit of precise poetic instances–the few helpful hints\nwe require.",
        "(a) The first measure–called by students of poetry the trochaic\nmeasure–is founded on the use of a long or emphatic syllable\nfollowed by a short or unemphatic syllable, It has a light, tripping\nmovement, therefore it is peculiarly fitted for the expression of\nlively subjects.  One of our examples shows this rather clearly:",
        "      ’           ’         ’         ’            ’\n    There’s a  | little | spark of | love still | burning",
        "Yet this is not a measure that is commonly found in the popular\nsong.  Other combinations seem to fit popular song needs quite as\nwell, if not better.",
        "(b) The second measure–called the iambic measure–is the reverse\nof the first.  That is, the short or unemphatic syllable precedes\nthe long or emphatic syllable.  “Alexander’s Ragtime Band “ uses\nthis measure at the beginning of the chorus.",
        "             ’         ’          ’         ’\n        Come on | and hear | come on | and hear",
        "The first verse of Mr. Harris’s song shows this measure even more\nclearly:",
        "        ’        ’          ’         ’           ’\n   You sit | at home | and calm | ly read | your pa | per",
        "This second measure, being less sustained in syllabic force, is\nmore easily kept up than the first measure.  It is therefore in\ncommon use.",
        "(c) The third measure–called the dactylic measure–is formed\nof a combination of three syllables.  Its characteristic is an\nemphatic syllable followed by two unemphatic syllables, as:",
        "                   ’             ’\n             The | old oak en | buck et",
        "                   ’             ’\n             The | iron bound | buck et",
        "(d) The fourth measure–called by the frighteningly long name\nof amphibrachic measure–is formed by a short or unemphatic syllable\nfollowed by a long or emphatic syllable, which is followed again\nby another short or unemphatic syllable.",
        "            ’                ’              ’\n         I won der  | who’s kiss ing | her now",
        "(e) The fifth measure–called anapestic measure–is made up of\ntwo short or unemphatic followed by a long or emphatic syllable.",
        "            ’             ’                   ’\n  When the bell | in the light | house rings ding | dong",
        "All these three-syllabic measures have a quicker movement than the\ntwo-syllabic, owing to the greater number of unaccented, unemphatic\nsyllables.  They lend themselves to a rushing impetuosity of\nexpression which is the notable characteristic of the popular song.\nBut they are not always regular, even in high-grade poetry.\nTherefore in the popular song we may look for, and certainly be\nsure to find, all sorts of variations from the regular forms here\ngiven.  Indeed, regularity, as has been clearly pointed out, is\nthe exception and not the rule; for few single lines, and, in a\nstill more marked degree, almost no songs, adhere to one measure\nthroughout.  Precisely as “apt alliteration’s artful aid” may be\nused or not used as may suit his purpose best, so the song-writer\nmakes regularity of measure subservient to the effect he desires.",
        "However, I give these examples not with a view to the encouragement\nof either regularity or irregularity.  My purpose is to show you\nwhat combinations are possible, and to say, as the jockey whispers\nin the eager ear of the racehorse he has held back so long, “Go\nto it!”  Break every rule you want to–only break a record.  As Mr.\nBerlin said, “I’ve broken every rule of versification and of music,\nand the result has often been an original twist.  In popular songs\na comparative ignorance of music is an advantage.  Further, since\nmy vocabulary is somewhat limited through lack of education, it\nfollows that my lyrics are simple.”",
        "This is only Berlin’s modest way of saying that not one in ten\nsuccessful song-writers know anything about the art of music, and\nthat very few are well enough educated to err on the side of\ninvolved language and write other than simple lyrics.  He drew the\napplication as to himself alone, although his native genius makes\nit less true of him than of many another less gifted.  The big\npoint of this observation lies in his emphasis on the fact that",
        "Perhaps in Mr. Berlin’s statement rests the explanation of the\ncurious fact that nearly all the successful popular song-writers\nare men who had few educational advantages in youth.  Most of them\nare self-made men who owe their knowledge of English and the art\nof writing to their own efforts.  Conversely, it may also explain\nwhy many well-educated persons strive for success in song-writing\nin vain.  They seem to find it difficult to acquire the chief lyric\nvirtue–simplicity.",
        "Not only must the words of a popular song be “easy,” but the idea\nof the lyric must be simple.  You cannot express a complex idea\nin the popular song-form, which is made up of phrases that sometimes\nseem short and abrupt.  And, even if you could overcome this\ntechnical difficulty, you would not find an audience that could\ngrasp your complex idea.  Remember that a majority of the purchasers\nof popular songs buy them at the five- and ten-cent store.  To\nsell songs to this audience, you must make your music easy to sing,\nyour words easy to say and your idea simple and plain.",
        "Being barred from other than the simplest of ways, by his own\nlimitations, his introducers and his market, the song-writer has\nto depend upon a purely inherent quality in his song for appeal.\nThis appeal is complex in its way, being composed of the lure of\nmusic, rhyme and emotion, but when analyzed all the parts are found\nto have one element in common.  This element to which all parts\ncontribute is rhythm.",
        "Now by rhythm I do not mean rhyme, nor metre, nor regularity.  It\nhas nothing necessarily to do with poetic measures nor with precision\nof rhymes.  Let me attempt to convey what I mean by saying that\nthe rhythm of a song is, as Irving Berlin said, the swing.  To\nthe swing of a song everything in it contributes.  Perhaps it will\nbe clearer when I say that rhythm is compounded of the exactness\nwith which the words clothe the idea and with which the music\nclothes the words, and the fineness with which both words and music\nfit the emotion.  Rhythm is singleness of effect.  Yet rhythm is\nmore–it is singleness of effect plus a sort of hypnotic fascination.",
        "And here we must rest as nearly content as we can, for the final\neffect of any work of art does not admit of dissection.  I have\nshown you some of the elements which contribute to making a popular\nsong popular, and in the next chapter we shall see still others\nwhich are best discussed in the direct application of the writing,\nbut even the most careful exposition must halt at the heart of the\nmystery of art.  The soul of a song defies analysis.",
        "Just as it is necessary for a popular song to have a punch somewhere\nin its music, so it must come somewhere in its lyric.  Just what\na lyrical punch is may be seen in the chorus of “The Trail of the\nLonesome Pine.”",
        "       In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia,\n         On the trail of the lonesome pine,\n       In the pale moonshine our hearts entwine,\n         Where she carved her name and I carved mine,\n       Oh, June, like the mountains I’m blue,\n         Like the pine, I am lonesome for you!\n       In the Blue Ridge mountains of Virginia,\n         On the trail of the lonesome pine.",
        "The underlined words are plainly the punch lines of this famous\nsong–the most attractive lines of the whole lyric.  Note where\nthey are placed–in the chorus, and next to the last lines.  Read\nthe chorus of “My Little Dream Girl” and you will find a similar\nexample of punch lines:",
        "       I’d sigh for,\n       I’d cry for, sweet dreams forever,\n       My little dream girl, good night.",
        "These, also, are placed next to the last lines of the chorus.",
        "The punch lines of “When it Strikes Home,” are found in",
        "       And when you hear of brave boys dying,\n         You may not care, they’re not your own,\n       But just suppose you lost your loved one\n         That is the time when it strikes home.",
        "Here the punch is placed at the very end of the chorus.",
        "Now test every song on your piano by this laboratory method.  You\nwill find that while there may be punch lines at the end of the\nverses there are nearly always punch lines at the end of the chorus.\nThere must be a reason for this similarity in all these popular\nsongs.  And the reason is this:  The emphatic parts of a sentence\nare the beginning and end.  The emphatic part of a paragraph is\nthe end.  If you have a number of paragraphs, the last must be the\nmost emphatic.  This is a common rule of composition founded on\nthe law of attention–we remember best what is said last.  The\nsame thing is true of songs.  And song-writers are compelled by\nvaudeville performers to put a punch near the end of their choruses\nbecause the performer must reap applause.  Thus commerce keeps the\nsong-writer true to the laws of good art.  Therefore remember:",
        "The most attractive lines of a popular song must be the last\nlines, or next to the last lines, of the chorus.",
        "This holds true whether the song is a “sob” ballad or a humorous\nnumber.  And–strictly adhering to this rule–put a punch, if you\ncan, at the end of each verse.  But whether you put a punch at the\nend of a verse or not, always put a punch close to the end of your\nchorus.",
        "One of the easiest ways of securing the vitally necessary punch\nlies in contrast.  Particularly is this true in humorous songs–it\nis the quick twist that wins the laughter.  But in all songs\ncontrast may form a large part of the punch element.",
        "The ways of securing a contrast are too many to permit of discussion\nhere, but I name a few:",
        "You may get contrast by switching the application as Harris did in:",
        "     You may not care, they’re not your own,\n     But just suppose you lost your loved one.",
        "Or you may get contrast by changing your metre and using a contrasting\nmeasure.  While you may do this in the middle of the chorus, it\nis nearly always done throughout the chorus.  I mean that the\nmeasure of the chorus is usually different from the measure used\nin the verse.",
        "And of course when you change the measure of your lyric, the\nmovement of the music changes too.  It is in the resulting contrasting\nmelody that lies much of the charm of the popular song.",
        "But, whatever means you use, be sure you have a contrast somewhere\nin your lyric–a contrast either of subject matter, poetic measure\nor musical sounds.",
        "If you will review all the great song successes of this year and\nof all the years that are past, you will come to the conclusion\nthat without love there could be no popular song.  Of course there\nhave been songs that have not had the element of love concealed\nanywhere in their lyrics, but they are the exceptions.",
        "If your song is not founded on love, it is well to add this element,\nfor when you remember that the song’s reason for being is emotion,\nand that the most moving emotion in the world is love, it would\nseem to be a grave mistake to write any song that did not offer\nthis easy bid for favor.  If you have not love in your lyrics make\nhaste to remedy the defect.",
        "The ballad is perhaps the one form by which the greatest number\nof successful song-writers have climbed to fame.  It is also one\nof the easiest types to write.  It should seem worth while, then,\nfor the newcomer to make a ballad one of his earliest bids for\nfame.",
        "The title of a song is the advertising line, and therefore it must\nbe the most attractive in your song.  It is the whole song summed\nup in one line.  It may be a single word or a half-dozen words.\nIt is not the punch line always.  It is often the very first line\nof the chorus, but it is usually the last line.",
        "There is little need for constructive thought in choosing a title.\nAll that is necessary is to select the best advertising line already\nwritten.  You have only to take the most prominent line and write\nit at the top of your lyrics.  Study the titles of the songs in\nthis chapter and you will see how easy it is to select your title\nafter you have written your song.",
        "To sum up:  a great lyric is as necessary to the success of a popular\nsong as a great melody, but not more necessary.  A lyric is a verse\nthat conveys a great deal of emotion.  Most popular songs have two\nverses and one chorus.  A regular metre is rare; irregularity may\neven be a virtue.  The regular occurrence of rhymes and precise\nrhymes are not necessary–but it is better to strive after regularity\nand precision.  There are five lyrical measures common to all\npoetry, but you may break every rule if you only break a record.\nRhythm–the swing–is the secret of successful songs.  Every lyric\nmust have one or more punch lines–which may occur at the end of\neach verse, but must be found in the last lines of the chorus.\nContrast–either of idea, poetic measure or music–is one sure way\nof securing the punch.  Love is the greatest single element that\nmakes for success in a song idea.  The one-word standard of\npopular-song writing is simplicity–music easy to sing, words\neasy to say, the idea simple and plain.",
        "In the preceding chapters we saw how the elements of a popular\nsong are nearly identical in music and in lyrics, no matter how\nthe styles of songs may differ.  In this chapter we shall see how\nthese elements may be combined–irrespective of styles–into a\nsong that the boy on the street will whistle, and the hand organs\ngrind out until you nearly go mad with the repetition of its rhythm.",
        "Not only because it will be interesting, but because such an insight\nwill help to a clear understanding of methods I shall ask you to\nglance into a popular song publisher’s professional department.",
        "A very large room–an entire floor, usually–is divided into a\nreception room, where vaudeville and cabaret performers are waiting\ntheir turns to rehearse, and half-a-dozen little rooms, each\ncontaining a piano.  As the walls of these rooms are never very\nthick, and often are mere partitions running only two-thirds of\nthe way to the ceiling, the discord of conflicting songs is sometimes\nappalling.  Every once in a while some performer comes to the\nmanager of the department and insists on being rehearsed by the\nwriters of the latest song-hit themselves.  And as often as not\nthe performer is informed that the writers are out.  In reality,\nperhaps, they are working on a new song in a back room.  Being\nespecially privileged, let us go into that back room and watch\nthem at work.",
        "All there is in the room is a piano and a few chairs.  One of the\nchairs has a broad arm, or there may be a tiny table or a desk.\nWith this slender equipment two persons are working as though the\nsalvation of the world depended on their efforts.  One of them is\nat the piano and the other is frowning over a piece of paper covered\nwith pencil marks.",
        "Perhaps the composer had the original idea–a theme for a melody.\nPerhaps the lyric writer had one line–an idea for a song.  It\ndoes not matter at all which had the idea originally, both are\nobsessed by it now.",
        "“Play the chorus over, will you?” growls the writer.  Obediently\nthe composer pounds away, with the soft pedal on, and the writer\nsings his words so that the composer can hear them.  There comes\na line that doesn’t fit.  “No good!” they say together.",
        "“Can’t you change that bar?” inquires the writer.",
        "“I’ll try,” says the composer.  “Gimme the sheet.”",
        "They prop it up on the piano and sing it together.",
        "“Shut up!” says the composer.  And the writer keeps still until\nthe other has pounded the offending bar to fit.",
        "Or perhaps the writer gets a new line that fits the music.  “How’s\nthis?” he cries with the intonation Columbus must have used when\nhe discovered the new world.",
        "“Punk!” comments the composer.  “You can’t rhyme ’man’ with ’grand’\nand get away with it these days.”",
        "“Oh, all right,” grumbles the harassed song-poet, and changes both\nlines to a better rhyme.  “I don’t like that part,” he gets back\nat the composer, “it sounds like ’Waiting at the Church.’”",
        "“How’s this, then?” inquires the composer, changing two notes.",
        "“Fine,” says the lyric writer, for the new variation has a hauntingly\nfamiliar sound, too elusive to label–is amazingly catchy.",
        "For hours, perhaps, they go on in this way–changing a note here,\na whole bar there, revising the lyric every few lines, substituting\na better rhyme for a bad one, and building the whole song into a\nclose-knit unity.",
        "At last the song is in pretty good shape.  As yet there is no\nsecond verse, but the “Boss” is called in and the boys sing him\nthe new song.  “Change ’dream’ to ’vision’–it sounds better,” he\nsays; or he may have a dozen suggestions–perhaps he gives the\nsong a new punch line.  He does his part in building it up, and\nthen the arranger is called in.",
        "With a pad of manuscript music paper, and a flying pencil, he jots\ndown the melody nearly as fast as the composer can pound it out\non tne piano.  “Get a ’lead-sheet’ ready as quick as you can,\ncommands the Boss.  “We’ll try it out tonight.”",
        "“Right!” grunts the arranger, and rushes away to give the melody\na touch here and there.  As often as not, he comes back to tell\nthe composer how little that worthy knows about music and to demand\nthat a note be changed or a whole bar recast to make it easier to\nplay, but at last he appears with a “lead-sheet\"–a mere suggestion\nof the song to be played, with all the discretion the pianist\ncommands–and the composer, the lyric writer and the “Boss” go\nacross the street to some cabaret and try out the new song.",
        "Here, before an audience, they can tell how much of a song they\nreally have.  They may have something that is a “winner,” and they\nmay see that their first judgment was wrong–they may have only\nthe first idea of a hit.",
        "But let us suppose that the song is a “knock ’em off their seats\"\nkind, that we may get down to the moral of this little narrative\nof actual happenings.  The “pluggers” are called in and bidden to\nmemorize the song.  They spend the afternoon singing it over and\nover again–and then they go out at night and sing it in a dozen\ndifferent places all over the city.  On their reports and on what\nthe “Boss” sees himself as he visits place after place, the decision\nis made to publish immediately or to work the song over again.\nIt is the final test before an audience that determines the fate\nof any song.  The new song may never be sung again, or tomorrow\nthe whole city may be whistling it.",
        "And now permit me to indicate a point that lies in the past of the\nsong we have seen in process of manufacture:  From somewhere the\ncomposer gets an idea for a melody–from somewhere the lyric writer\ngets an idea for a lyric.",
        "But we must put the music of a song to one side and devote our\nattention to the lyric.",
        "As a popular song becomes popular because it fits into the life\nof the day and is the individual expression of the spirit of the\nmoment, Charles K. Harris was doubtless right when he said:",
        "“The biggest secret of success, according to my own system, is the\nfollowing out in songs of ideas current in the national brain at\nthe moment.  My biggest song successes have always reflected the\nfavorite emotion–if I may use the word–of the people of the day.\nHow do I gauge this?  Through the drama!  The drama moves in irregular\ncycles, and changes in character according to the specific tastes\nof the public.  The yearly mood of the nation is reflected by the\ndrama and the theatrical entertainment of the year.  At least, I\nfigure it out this way, and compose my songs accordingly.",
        "“Here are just two instances of my old successes built on this\nplan:  When ’The Old Homestead’ and ’In Old Kentucky’ were playing\nto crowded houses, I wrote ’’Midst the Green Fields of Virginia’\nand ’In the Hills of Old Carolina,’ and won.  Then when Gillette’s\nwar plays, ’Held by the Enemy’ and ’Secret Service’ caught the\nnational eye, I caught the national ear with ’Just Break the News\nto Mother.’  But these are examples enough to show you how the\nsystem works.”",
        "Irving Berlin said, “You can get a song idea from anywhere.  I\nhave studied the times and produced such songs as ’In My Harem’\nwhen the Greeks were fleeing from the Turks and the harem was a\nhumorous topic in the daily newspapers.  And I have got ideas from\nchance remarks of my friends.  For instance:",
        "“I wrote ’My Wife’s Gone to the Country’ from the remark made to\nme by a friend when I asked him what time he was going home. ’I\ndon’t have to go home,’ he said, ’my wife’s gone to the country.’\nIt struck me as a great idea for a title for a song, but I needed\na note of jubilation, so I added ’Hooray, Hooray!’  The song almost\nwrote itself.  I had the chorus done in a few minutes, then I dug\ninto the verse, and it was finished in a few hours.”",
        "L. Wolfe Gilbert wrote “Robert E. Lee” from the “picture lines\"\nin one of his older songs, “Mammy’s Shuffiing Dance” and a good\nold-fashioned argument that he and I had about the famous old\nMississippi steamboat.  That night when I came back to the office\nwe shared, Gilbert read me his lyric.  From the first the original\nnovelty of the song was apparent, and in a few days the country\nwas whistling the levee dance of ’Daddy’ and ’Mammy,’ and ’Ephram’\nand ’Sammy,’ as they waited for the Robert E. Lee.  Had Gilbert\never seen a levee?  No–but out of his genius grew a song that\nsold into the millions.",
        "“Most of our songs come from imagination,” said Joe McCarthy.  “A\nsong-writer’s mind is ever alert for something new.  What might\npass as a casual remark to an outsider, might be a great idea to\na writer.  For instance, a very dear young lady friend might have\nsaid, ’You made me love you–I didn’t want to do it.’ Of course\nno young lady friend said that to me–I just imagined it.  And\nthen I went right on and imagined what that young lady would have\nsaid if she had followed that line of thought to a climax.”",
        "“It’s the chance remark that counts a lot to the lyric writer,\"\nsaid Ballard MacDonald.  “You might say something that you would\nforget the next minute–while I might seize that phrase and work\nover it until I had made it a lyric.”",
        "But, however the original idea comes–whether it creeps up in a\nchance remark of a friend, or the national mood of the moment is\ncarefully appraised and expressed, or seized “out of the air,” let\nus suppose you have an idea, and are ready to write your song.\nThe very first thing you do, nine chances out of ten, is to follow\nthe usual method of song-writers:",
        "The popular song is only as good as its chorus.  For whistling\npurposes there might just as well be no verses at all.  But of\ncourse you must have a first verse to set your scene and lead up\nto your chorus, and a second verse to finish your effect and give\nyou the opportunity to pound your chorus home.  Therefore you begin\nto write your chorus around your big idea.",
        "This idea is expressed in one line–your title, your catchy line,\nyour “idea line,” if you like–and if you will turn to the verses\nof the songs reproduced in these chapters you will be able to\ndetermine about what percentage of times the idea line is used to\nintroduce the chorus.  But do not rest content with this examination;\ncarry your investigation to all the songs on your piano.  Establish\nfor yourself, by this laboratory method, how often the idea line\nis used as a chorus introduction.",
        "Whether your idea line is used to introduce your chorus or not,\nit is usually wise to end your chorus with it.  Most choruses–but\nnot all, as “Put on your Old Grey Bonnet,” would suggest–end with\nthe idea line, on the theory that the emphatic spots in any form\nof writing are at the beginning and the end–and of these the more\nemphatic is the end.  Therefore, you must now concentrate your\nchorus to bring in that idea line as the very last line.",
        "As we saw in the previous chapter, a lyric is a set of verses that\nconveys emotion.  The purpose of the first verse is to lead up to\nthe emotion–which the chorus expresses.  While, as I shall\ndemonstrate later, a story may be proper to the verses, a story\nis rarely told in the chorus.  I mean, of course, a story conveyed\nby pure narrative, for emotion may convey a story by sheer lyrical\neffect.  Narrative is what you must strive to forget in a chorus–in\nyour chorus you must convey emotion swiftly–that is, with a\npunch.",
        "While it is impossible for anyone to tell you how to convey emotion,\none can point out one of the inherent qualities of emotional speech.",
        "When a man rushes through the corridors of a doomed liner he does\nnot stop to say, “The ship has struck an iceberg–or has been\ntorpedoed–and is sinking, you’d better get dressed quickly and\nget on deck and jump into the boats.”  He hasn’t time.  He cries,\n\"The ship’s sinking!  To the boats!”",
        "This is precisely the way the song-writer conveys his effect.  He\nnot only cuts out the “thes” and the “ands” and the “ofs” and “its\"\nand “perhapses\"–he shaves his very thoughts down–as the lyrics\nprinted in these chapters so plainly show–until even logic of\nconstruction seems engulfed by the flood of emotion.  Pare down\nyour sentences until you convey the dramatic meaning of your deep\nemotion, not by a logical sequence of sentences, but by revealing\nflashes.",
        "And now you must centre all your thoughts on your punch lines.\nPunch lines, as we saw, are sometimes the entire point of a\nsong–they are what makes a “popular” lyric get over the footlights\nwhen a performer sings the song and they are the big factor–together\nwith the music punches–that make a song popular.  However lyrical\nyou have been in the beginning of your chorus, you must now summon\nall your lyrical ability to your aid to write these, the fate-deciding\nlines.",
        "But note that emotion, however condensed the words may be that\nexpress it, must not be so condensed that it is incoherent.  You\nmust make your punch lines as clear in words as though you were\ndrawing a diagram to explain a problem in geometry.  The effect\nyou must secure is that of revealing clearness.",
        "Be very careful not to anticipate your punch lines.  For instance,\nif Mr. Gilbert had used “All day I sigh, all night I cry,” before\n\"I’d sigh for, I’d cry for, sweet dreams forever” in his “My Little\nDream Girl,” the whole effect would have been lost.  As your punch\nlines must be the most attractive lines, keep them new and fresh,\nby excluding from the rest of your song anything like them.",
        "If you can put your punch in the very last lines, fine.  If you\nwish to put your punch lines just before the last two lines–in\nthe third and fourth lines from the last–well and good.  But it\nis never wise to put your punch so far from the end that your\naudience will forget it before you finish and expect something\nmore.  It is a good rule to write your punch lines and then end\nyour song.",
        "Having constructed your chorus from a beginning that uses or does\nnot use your idea line, and having by broad strokes that convey\nemotion developed it into your punch lines, you end your chorus,\nusually, but not invariably, with your idea line–your title line.",
        "Now you are ready to write your first verse.",
        "If you have characters in your song, introduce them instantly.\nIf you are drawing a picture of a scene, locate it in your first\nline.  If your song is written in the first person–the “you and I\"\nkind–you must still establish your location and your “you and I\"\ncharacters at once.  If you keep in mind all the time you are\nwriting that your first verse is merely an introduction, you will\nnot be likely to drag it out.",
        "(a) Write in impersonal mood–that is, make your song such that\nit does not matter whether a man or a woman sings it.  Thus you will\nnot restrict the wide use of your song.  Anyone and everyone can\nsing it on the stage.  Furthermore, it will be apt to sell more\nreadily.",
        "(b) “Tell a complete story” is a rule that is sometimes laid\ndown for popular song-writers.  But it depends entirely upon what\nkind of song you are writing whether it is necessary to tell a\nstory or not.  “A story is not necessary,” Berlin says, and an\nexamination of the lyrics in the preceding chapter, and all the\nlyrics on your piano, will bear him out in this assertion.",
        "All you need remember is that your song must express emotion in a\ncatchy way.  If you can do this best by telling a story, compress\nyour narrative into your verses, making your chorus entirely\nemotional.",
        "(c) “Make your verses short” seems to be the law of the popular\nsong today.  In other years it was the custom to write long verses\nand short choruses.  Today the reverse seems to be the fashion.\nBut whether you decide on a short verse or a long verse–and\nreference to the latest songs will show you what is best for you\nto write–you must use as few words as possible to begin your story\nand–with all the information necessary to carry over the points\nof your chorus–to lead it up to the joining lines.",
        "You have introduced your chorus in your first verse, and the chorus\nhas conveyed the emotion to which the first verse gave the setting.\nNow in your second verse round out the story so that the repetition\nof the chorus may complete the total effect of your song.",
        "More than upon either the first verse or the chorus, unity of\neffect depends upon the second verse.  In it you must keep to the\nkey of emotion expressed in the chorus and to the general trend\nof feeling of the first verse.  If your first verse tells a\nlove-story of two characters, it is sometimes well to change the\nrelations of the characters in the second verse and make the\nrepetition of the chorus come as an answer.  But, whatever you\nmake of your second verse, you must not give it a different story.\nDon’t attempt to do more than round out your first-verse story to\na satisfying conclusion, of which the chorus is the completing end.",
        "And now we have come to",
        "Toward the end of each verse it is customary to place punch lines\nwhich are strong enough pictorially to sum up the contents of the\nverse and round it out into the chorus.  In humorous songs, these\npunch lines are often used as the very last lines, and the first\nline of the chorus is depended on to develop the snicker into a\nlaugh, which is made to grow into a roar with the punch lines of\nthe chorus.  In other words, there are in every song three places\nwhere punch lines must be used.  The most important is toward the\nend of the chorus, and the other places are toward the end of the\nverses.",
        "Don’t end your lines with words that are hard to enunciate–there\nare dozens of them, of which are “met,” and most of the dental\nsounds.  Experience alone can teach you what to avoid.  But it may\nbe said that precisely the same reason that dictates the use of\nopen vowels on rising notes, dictates that open sounds are safest\nwith which to end lines, because the last notes of a song are often\nrising notes.  This applies with emphatic force, also, to your\nchorus.  Never use such unrhetorical and laugh-provoking lines as\nthe grotesquely familiar “and then to him I did say.”",
        "Don’t always feel that it is necessary to tell the audience “here\nis the chorus.”  Imagination is common to all, and the chorus is\npredicted by the turn of thought and the “coming to it” feeling\nof the melody.",
        "Having gone over your verses and made sure that you have punch\nlines that rise out of the narrative effect into revealing flashes,\nand are completed and punched home by the punch lines of the chorus,\nand having made sure that your lyrics as a whole are the best you\ncan write, you must give thought to the music.",
        "If you are the sort of modern minstrel who has tunes buzzing in\nhis head, it is likely that you will have composed a melody to fit\nyour lyrics.  The chances are that you know only enough about music\nto play the piano rather indifferently.  Or, you may be an\naccomplished pianist without possessing a knowledge of harmony\nsufficient to admit of your setting down your melody in the form\nof a good piano score.  But even if you are only able to play the\npiano with one finger, you need not despair.  There are dozens of\nwell-known popular song composers who are little better off.  You\nmay do precisely what they do–you can call to your aid an arranger.\nThis is the first moral I shall draw from the true story with which\nthis chapter begins.",
        "As the composer played over his melody for the arranger to take\ndown in musical notes, you may sing, whistle or play your melody\non the piano with one finger, for the arranger to take down your\nsong.  All you need give him is the bare outline of your melody.\nAt best it will be but a forecasting shadow of what he will make\nout of it.  From it he will make you a “lead-sheet,” the first\nrecord of your melody.  Then, if you desire, he will arrange your\nmelody into a piano part, precisely identical in form with any\ncopy of a song you have seen.  With this piano version–into which\nthe words have been carefully written in their proper places–you\nmay seek your publisher.",
        "For taking down the melody and making an “ink lead-sheet,” the\narranger will charge you from one to two dollars.  For a piano\ncopy he will charge you anywhere from three to ten dollars–the\naverage price is about five dollars.",
        "Here we may draw the second moral from the little scene we witnessed\nin the song publisher’s room–this is the big lesson of that scene.\nIn a word, successful song-writers consider a song not as a lyric\nand a melody, but as a composite of both.  A successful song is a\nperfect fusing of both.  The melody writer is not averse to having\nhis melody changed, if by changing it a better song can be made.\nAnd the successful lyric writer is only too glad to change his\nwords, if a hit can be produced.  With the one end in view, they\ngo over their song time after time and change lyrics and melody\nwith ruthless hands until a whistle-making unity rises clear and\nhaunting.",
        "This is what you must now do with your song.  You must bend all\nyour energies to making it a perfect blend of words and music–a\nunity so compressed and so compactly lyrical that to take one\nlittle note or one little word away would ruin the total effect.",
        "This is why",
        "If you are invited to purchase music for a new song, it is the\npart of wisdom to refuse–because only in very rare instances has\na successful song been the result of such a method.  The reason\nis perfectly plain, when you consider that the composer who offers\nyou a melody for a cash price is interested only in the small lump\nsum he receives.  You are his market.  He does not care anything\nabout the market the music must make for itself, first with a\npublisher and then with the public.",
        "Therefore, no matter how willing a composer may appear to change\nhis melody to fit your song, scan his proposition with a cynical\neye.  On the surface he will make the music fit, but he would be\nwasting his time if he worked over your lyric and his music to the\nextent that a composer who is paid by the ultimate success of a\nsong would have to labor.",
        "It is very much better to take your chances with even an inferior\nmelody maker who is as much interested as you are in a final\nsuccess.  And when you have found a composer, do not quibble about\nchanging your words to fit his music.  And don’t fear to ask him\nto change his melody, wherever constant work on the song proves\nthat a change is necessary.  It is only by ceaselessly working\nover both words and melody that a song is turned into a national\nwhistle.",
        "[1] The matter under this section would seem to be an integral\npart of the following Chapter, “Manuscripts and Markets,” but it\nis included in this chapter because some of the points require a\ndiscussion too expansive for the general treatment employed in\ndescribing the handling of other stage material.",
        "You have written your lyrics, and you have fashioned your melody,\nor you have found a composer who is anxious to make his melody fit\nyour lyrics so perfectly that they have been fused into a unity\nso complete that it seems all you have to do to start everybody\nwhistling it is to find a publisher.  And so you set about the\ntask.",
        "While it is perfectly true that there have been many songs that\nhave paid handsome profits from private publication, it is more\nnearly exact to believe that private publication never pays.\nPrinters and song publishers who make a business of this private\ntrade will often lure the novice by citing the many famous songs\n\"published by their writers.”  Whenever you see such an advertisement,\nor whenever such an argument is used in a sales talk, dig right\ndown to the facts of the case.  Nine chances out of ten, you will\nfind that the writers are successful popular song publishers–it\nis their business to write for their own market.  Furthermore–and\nthis is the crux of the matter–they have a carefully maintained\nsales force and an intricate outlet for all their product, which\nwould take years for a “private publisher” to build up.  Really,\nyou cannot expect to make any money by private publication, even\nat the low cost of song-printing these days–unless you are willing\nto devote all your energies to pushing your song.  And even then,\nthe song must be exceptional to win against the better organized\ncompetition.",
        "It is never my desire to condemn a class even though a majority\nof that class may be worthy of reproach.  Therefore, instead of\ninveighing against the “song-poem” fakir with sounding periods of\ndenunciation, permit me to state the facts in this way:",
        "The advertisers for song-poems may be divided into two classes.\nIn the first class are publishers who publish songs privately for\nindividuals who have enough money to indulge a desire to see their\nsongs in print.  The writer may not intend his song for public\nsale.  He wishes to have it printed so that he may give copies to\nhis friends and thus satisfy his pride by their plaudits.  It is\nto these song-writers that the honest “private publisher” offers\na convenient and often cheap opportunity.  His dealings are perfectly\nhonest and fair, because he simply acts as a printer, and not as\na publisher, for he does not offer to do more than he can perform.",
        "The second class of song-poem advertisers lure writers by all sorts\nof glowing promises.  They tell you how such and such a song made\nthousands of dollars for its writer.  They offer to furnish music\nto fit your lyrics.  They will supply lyrics to fit your music.\nThey will print your song and push it to success.  They will do\nanything at all–for a fee!  And I have heard the most pitiful tales\nimaginable of high hopes at the beginning and bitter disappointment\nat the end, from poor people who could ill afford the money lost.",
        "These “publishers” are not fair–they are not honest.  They make\ntheir living from broken promises, and pocket the change with a\ngrin over their own cleverness.  Why these men cannot perform what\nthey promise is perfectly plain in the light of all that has been\nsaid about the popular song.  It does not need repetition here.\nIf you wish to publish your song privately for distribution among\nyour friends, seek the best and cheapest song printer you can find.\nBut if you hope to make your fortune through publication for which\nyou must pay–in which the publisher has nothing to lose and\neverything to win–take care!  At least consider the proposition\nas a long shot with the odds against you–then choose the fairest\npublisher you can find.",
        "But let us hope that you are the sort of song-writer who is anxious\nto test his ability against the best.  You do not care to have\nyour song published unless it wins publication on its merits–and\nunless you can be reasonably sure of making some money out of it.\nYou aspire to have your song bear the imprint of one of the\npublishers whose song-hits are well known.  To find the names and\naddresses of such publishers you have only to turn over the music\non your piano.  There is no need to print individual names here.",
        "But a few words of direction as to the way you should approach\nyour market may be helpful.  I quote here the composite opinion\nof all the well-known song publishers with whom I have talked:",
        "“To find a great song in the manuscripts that come through the\nmail–is a dream.  It is rare that the mail brings one worthy of\npublication.  If I were a song-writer I should not submit my song\nthrough the mails.  Of course, if I were far from the big markets\nI should be compelled to.  But if I were anywhere near the market\nI should go right to the publisher and demonstrate the song to him.",
        "“You see, I must be convinced that a song is a winner before I’ll\ngamble my money on its publication.  And the only way I can be\neasily convinced is to be compelled to listen to the song.\nNaturally, being a song publisher, I think I know a hit when I\nhear it–I may ’kid’ myself into believing I can pick winners, but\nI can be made to see the possibilities by actual demonstration,\nwhere I might ’pass a song up’ in manuscript.”",
        "Therefore, it would seem wise to offer a song through the mails\nonly when a personal visit and demonstration are impossible.  You\nneed not copyright your song, if you send it to a reputable\npublisher.  All you need do is to submit it with a short letter,\noffering it on the usual royalty basis, and enclose stamps for\nreturn, if it is not available.  From two to four weeks is the\nusual time required for consideration.",
        "If you are near a song publisher, the very best thing you can do\nis to fortify yourself with unassailable faith in your song and\nthen make the publisher listen to you.  If you have a song that\nshows any promise at all, the chances are that you will come out\nof the door an hour later with a contract.",
        "It is in the hope of directing you to your market that this chapter\nis designed.  But there is no form of writing for which it is more\ndifficult to point out a sure market than for vaudeville material.\nEven the legitimate stage–with its notorious shifting of plans\nto meet every veering wind–is not more fickle than the vaudeville\nstage.  The reason for this is, of course, to be found in the fact\nthat the stage must mirror the mind of the nation, and the national\nmind is ever changing.  But once let the public learn to love what\nyou have given them, and they will not jilt your offering in a\nday.  The great advantage the writer of vaudeville material today\nhas over every one of his predecessors, lies in the fact that the\nmodern methods of handling the vaudeville business lend him security\nin the profits of his success.",
        "(a) The acceptable manuscript forms into which all vaudeville\nmaterial may be cast may be learned by consulting the examples\nof the different vaudeville acts given in the appendix to this\nvolume.  A moment’s examination of them will show you that there\nis no difference between the manuscript ways of presenting the\ndifferent acts.  All are made up of the names of characters,\nbusiness and dialogue.  Therefore they may all be discussed at the\nsame time.",
        "(b) Have your manuscript typewritten. This suggestion has the\nforce of law.  While it would seem self-evident that a manuscript\nwritten out in long hand has a mussy appearance, however neat the\nwriting may be, the many hand-written manuscripts I have tried to\nread suggest the necessity for pointing out this fact.  You surely\nhandicap your manuscript by offering it in long hand to a busy\nproducer.",
        "(c) The two recognized methods for the typing of stage manuscripts.\nFirst, the entire manuscript is typed in black, blue or purple.\nThen, after the manuscript is complete, the name of the character\nabove each speech is underlined in red ink, and every bit of\nbusiness throughout the manuscript is also underlined in red.\nThis method is illustrated below.",
        "[Here, text originally underlined in red appear in all CAPS.]",
        "Second, a typewriter using two colors is employed.  The name of\nthe character above each speech is typed in red, and red is used\nto type the bits of business.  The speeches alone are typed in\nblack, blue or purple as the case may be.  The following example\nillustrates this method.",
        "Either of these methods serves the same purpose equally well.  The\naim is to separate the names and business from the dialogue, so\nthat the difference may be plain at a glance.  The use of either\nof these ways of typing a manuscript is desirable, but not absolutely\nnecessary.",
        "(d) Use a “record ribbon” in typewriting manuscript, because a\n\"copying ribbon “ smudges easily and will soil the hands of the\nreader.  Observation of this mechanical point is a big help in\nkeeping a manuscript clean–and respecting the temper of your\njudge.",
        "(e) Neatness is a prime requisite in any manuscript offered for\nsale.  Be sure that the finished copy is free from erasures and\npenciled after-thoughts.  “Do all your after-thinking beforehand,\"\nor have a clean, new copy made.",
        "(f) Re-copy a soiled manuscript as soon as it shows evidence of\nhandling.  Keep your “silent salesman” fresh in appearance.",
        "(g) Bind your manuscript in a flexible cover to give it a neat\nappearance and make it handy to read.",
        "(h) Type your name and address in full on the outside of the\ncover, and on the first white page.  Thus you stamp the manuscript\nas your act, and it always bears your address in case of loss.",
        "(i) Have your act copyrighted is a bit of advice that would seem\nneedless, but many performers and producers refuse to read an act\nunless it is copyrighted.  The copyright–while it is not as good\nproof in court as a public performance–is nevertheless a record\nthat on such and such a date the author deposited in the Library\nof Congress a certain manuscript.  This record can be produced as\nincontrovertible evidence of fact.  The view of the performer and\nthe producer is that he wishes to protect the author as much as\npossible–but himself more.  He desires to place beyond all\npossibility any charge of plagiarism.  Therefore, copyright the\nfinal version of your act and typewrite on the cover the date of\ncopyright and the serial number.",
        "(j) How to copyright the manuscript of a vaudeville act. Write\nto the Register of Copyrights, Library of Congress, Washington,\nD.C., asking him to send you the blank form prescribed by law to\ncopyright an unpublished dramatic composition.  Do not send stamps,\nas it is unnecessary.  In addition to the blank you will receive\nprinted instructions for filling it out, and full information\ncovering the copyright process.  The fee is one dollar, which\nincludes a certificate of copyright entry.  This covers copyright\nin the United States only; if you desire to copyright in a foreign\ncountry, consult a lawyer.",
        "(k) The preparation of a scene plot should not be a difficult\ntask if you will remember that you need merely draw a straight-line\ndiagram–such as are shown in the chapter on “The Vaudeville Stage\nand its Dimensions\"–so as to make your word-description perfectly\nclear.  On this diagram it is customary to mark the position of\nchairs, tables, telephones and other properties incidental to the\naction of the story.  But a diagram is not absolutely necessary.\nWritten descriptions will be adequate, if they are carefully and\nconcisely worded.",
        "(l) The preparation of property plots and light plots has been\nmentioned in the chapter on “The Vaudeville Stage and Its Dimensions,\"\ntherefore they require a word here.  They are merely a list of the\nproperties required and directions for any changes of lighting\nthat may occur in the act.  For a first presentation of a manuscript,\nit is quite unnecessary for you to bother about the technical plots\n(arrangement plans) of the stage.  If your manuscript is acceptable,\nyou may be quite sure that the producer will supply these plots\nhimself.",
        "(m) Do not offer “parts” with your manuscript. A “part” consists\nof the speeches and business indicated for one character, written\nout in full, with the cues given by the other characters–the whole\nbound so as to form a handy copy for the actor to study.  For\ninstance, there would be four “parts” in a four-people playlet\nmanuscript–therefore you would be offering a producer five\nmanuscripts in all, and the bulk of your material might deter a\nbusy man from reading it carefully.  If your manuscript progresses\nin its sale to the point where parts are desired, the producer\nwill take care of this detail for you.  And until you have made a\nsale, it is a waste of money to have parts made.",
        "Unlike nearly every other specialized business, there is a market\nin each city of the country for vaudeville material.  This market\nis the stage door of the vaudeville theatre.  While it would be\nunlikely that a dramatist would find a market for a long play at\nthe “legitimate” stage door–although this has happened–there are\npeculiar reasons why the stage door may be your market-place.  A\nlarge percentage of vaudeville performers are the owners of their\nown acts.  They buy the material, produce it themselves, and play\nin it themselves.  And they are ever on the lookout for new material.",
        "Not only is there a market at the stage door, but that market\nchanges continually.  Without fear of exaggeration it may be said\nthat with the weekly and sometimes semi-weekly changes of the bill\nin each house, there will in time flow past the stage door nearly\nall the acts which later appear in vaudeville.",
        "Offering a manuscript at the stage door, however, should not be\ndone without preparation.  As you would not rush up to a business\nman on the street or spring at him when he emerges from his office\ndoor, you certainly would not care to give a vaudeville performer\nthe impression that you were lying in wait for him.",
        "(a) The personal introduction is a distinct advantage in any\nbusiness, therefore it would be an advantage for you to secure,\nif possible, a personal introduction to the performer.  However,\nyou must be as discriminating in choosing the person to make that\nintroduction as you would were you selecting an endorser at a bank.\nA stage-hand or an usher is likely to do you more harm than good.\nThe “mash notes” they may have carried “back stage” would discount\ntheir value for you.  The manager of the theatre, however, might\narrange an introduction that would be of value.  At least he can\nfind out for you if the performer is in the market at the time.",
        "(b) The preliminary letter is never amiss, therefore it would\nseem advisable to write to the performer for whom you feel sure\nyou have an act that will fit.  Make the letter short.  Simply ask\nhim if he is in the market for material, state that you have an\nact that you would like him to read, and close by requesting an\nappointment at his convenience.",
        "Do not take up his time by telling him what a fine act you have.\nHe does not know you, and if you praise it too highly he may be\ninclined to believe that you do not have anything worth while.\nBut do not under-rate your material, either, in the hope of engaging\nhis attention by modesty.  Leave it for him to find out if you\nhave an act, first, that is worth while, and second, that fits him.",
        "If you do not hear from the performer, you may be sure that he is\nnot interested in your act.  He may be out for the first few weeks\nin a brand new act, and not in the market at all.  So if you do\nnot hear from him, wait until another act comes along and you see\nsomeone for whom your act is “just made.”",
        "(c) Should you receive a favorable reply to your request for an\nappointment, you may be reasonably sure that your prospective\npurchaser at least needs a new act.  In meeting your appointment,\nbe on time, and have someone with you.  A woman, of course, would\nhave a chaperon, precisely as she would if she were meeting any\nother stranger.  And a man might care to have someone to engage\nthe attention of the performer’s companion and leave him an\nuninterrupted opportunity to talk business.",
        "(d) Ask for an immediate reading of your manuscript, or at least\nrequest it read the next day, when you can be present while he is\nreading it.  Do not leave a manuscript to be returned to you by\nmail.  Vaudeville performers are as honest as any other class of\nmen, but they are busy people and the thing that is put off is\nforgotten.  They are in one town today and miles away tomorrow,\nand they may leave the manuscript on the bureau of their hotel\nroom intending to mail it at the last minute–and rush away and\nforget it.  Therefore you should ask for an immediate reading.\nIt will take a performer only a few minutes to decide if he cares\nto consider your act.  He knows of what he is in need–and usually\nis prepared to tell you.",
        "(e) Do not ask for specific criticism, for of all people in the\nworld vaudeville performers are the most good-hearted.  They would\nrather please you than hurt you.  They will evade the point nine\ntimes out of ten; so save them and yourself needless embarrassment.\nAnd thus you may also avoid a false valuation of your manuscript.",
        "(f) If the performer cannot use the act himself, and if the act\npossesses merit, the chances are that he will suggest some other\nperformer who might want it.  If he does not suggest someone\nhimself, ask him.  Vaudeville performers know what other performers\nwant, because they are continually discussing plans for “next\nseason.”  You may thus pick up some valuable information, even if\nyou do not dispose of the particular manuscript you have for sale.",
        "While you are likely at many turns of the sales road to have offered\nyou an opportunity to produce your own act, this method of finding\na market is rarely advisable.  You would not start a little magazine\nto get your short-story into print; your story could not possess\nthat much value even if it were a marvel–how much less so if you\nwere unable to find someone willing to buy it!",
        "But there is a still more important reason why you should not rush\ninto producing your act yourself.  Producing is a specialized\nbusiness, requiring wide experience and exact knowledge.  Besides,\nit is one of the most expensive pastimes in the world.  Without a\nmost comprehensive experience and peculiar abilities, failure is\nsure.  Do not attempt private production even if you are offered\nthe services of a performer or a producer in whom you have absolute\nfaith.  Remember, if they thought your act was really worth while\nthey would be anxious to reap the profits for themselves.",
        "While any performer who owns his act is a producer in the sense\nthat he “produces” his act, there are men who make a business of\nbuying manuscripts, engaging people, and producing many acts in\nwhich they do not themselves play.  Producers who may own a dozen\nacts of all different kinds would seem to offer to the writer for\nvaudeville an ideal market.  How, then, is the writer to get in\ntouch with them?",
        "(a) Selling through a Play broker is a method that is precisely\nthe same as though you consigned a bill of goods to a commission\nagent, and paid him for disposing of it.  The play broker reads\nyour manuscript and engages to try to dispose of it for you, or\nreturns it as not likely to fit in with the particular line of\nbusiness of which he makes a specialty.  If your act is really\ngood and yet the broker is able to make some suggestions that will\nimprove it, he is likely to offer such suggestions, purely in the\nhope of earning a commission, and in this way he may prove of\ndistinct value as a critic.  In any event, if he accepts a manuscript\nto sell for you, he will offer it in the quarters he thinks most\nlikely to produce it and will attend to all the business incidental\nto the making of the contract.",
        "For this service the broker charges a ten per cent commission.\nThis commission is paid either on the price of outright sale, or\non the royalty account.  If the act is sold on royalty, he will\ncollect the customary advance and also the weekly payments.  After\ndeducting his commission, he will remit the balance to you.",
        "On the last page of this chapter you will find a partial list of\nwell-known play brokers.  Although I do not know of any who deal\nexclusively in vaudeville material, any one of the agents who handles\nlong plays is glad to handle an exceptionally fine playlet.",
        "(b) Seeking a personal interview with a producer is usually\nproductive of one result:  The office-boy says, “Leave your manuscript,\nand he’ll read it and let you know.”  Anxious as he is to secure\ngood material, a man who is busily engaged in producing vaudeville\nacts has little time to spend on granting personal interviews.\nAnd there is another reason–he fears you will try to read your\nact to him.  A personal reading by the author is either a most\ndistressing affair, because the average writer cannot read stage\nmaterial as it should be read, or else it is very dangerous to the\nlistener’s judgment.  Many a producer has been tricked into producing\nan act whose merits a masterly reader has brought out so finely\nthat its fatal faults were forgotten.  And so the producer prefers\nto read a manuscript himself.  Alone in his office he can concentrate\non the act in hand, and give to it the benefit of his best judgment.",
        "(c) Offering a manuscript by mail is perfectly safe.  There has\nnever come to my knowledge one clearly proved instance of where a\nproducer has “stolen an idea.”",
        "(d) Send your manuscript by registered mail and demand a return\nreceipt.  Thus you will save losses in the mail and hold a check\nagainst the loss of your manuscript in the producer’s office.  And\nwhen you send your manuscript by mail, invariably enclose stamps\nto pay the return to you by registered delivery.  Better still,\nenclose a self-addressed envelope with enough postage affixed to\ninsure both return and registry.",
        "(e) Three weeks for consideration is about the usual time the\naverage producer requires to read a manuscript at his leisure.\nIn times when a producer is actively engaged in putting on an act,\nhe may not have an hour in the week he can call his own.  Therefore\nhave patience, and if you do not receive a reply from him in three\nweeks, write again and courteously remind him that you would like\nto have his decision at his earliest convenience.  Impatient letters\ncan only harm your chance.",
        "What money can be made by writing vaudeville material?  This is\ncertainly the most interesting question the writer for vaudeville\ncan ask.  Like the prices of diamonds, the prices of vaudeville\nacts depend on quality.  Every individual act, and each kind of\nact, commands its own special price.  There are two big questions\ninvolved in the pricing of every vaudeville manuscript.  First,\nof what value is the act itself?  Second, what can the performer\nor the producer afford to payor be made to pay for the act?",
        "The first question cannot be answered for even a class of acts.\nThe value of each individual act determines its own price.  And\neven here there enters the element inherent in all stage material–\na doubt of value until performance before an audience proves the\nworth of the act.  For this reason, it is customary for the purchaser\nof a vaudeville act to require that it first make good, before he\npays for it.  “Try and then buy,” is the average vaudevillian’s\nmotto.  If you are a good business man you will secure an advance\nagainst royalty of just as much as you can make the producer “give\nup.”  Precisely as in every other business, the price of service\ndepends upon the individual’s ability to “make a deal.”",
        "The answer to the second question likewise depends upon the\nvaudeville writer’s individual ability as a business man.  No hints\ncan be given you other than those that you may glean from a\nconsideration of average and record prices in the following\nparagraphs.",
        "(a) The monologue is usually sold outright.  The performer nearly\nalways will tell you–with no small degree of truth–that the\nmonologist makes the monologue, not the monologue the monologist.\nMany a monologue has sold for five dollars, and the purchaser been\n\"stung” at that price.  But very rarely is a monologue bought\noutright in manuscript–that is, before a try-out.  A monologue\nmust prove itself “there,” before a monologist will pay any more\nthan a small advance for the exclusive privilege of trying it out.",
        "If the monologue proves itself, an outright offer will be made by\nthe performer.  While there are no “regular rates,” from two hundred\nand fifty dollars to seven hundred dollars may be considered as\nsuggestive of the market value of the average successful monologue.",
        "In addition to this, the monologist usually retains the author to\nwrite new points and gags for him each week that he works.  This,\nof course, increases the return from a monologue, and insures the\nwriter a small weekly income.",
        "In very rare cases monologues are so good and, therefore, so\nvaluable that authors can retain the ownership and rent them out\nfor a weekly royalty.  In such a case, of course, the author engages\nhimself to keep the material up to the minute without extra\ncompensation.  But such monologues are so rare they can be counted\non the fingers of one hand.  There is little doubt that “The German\nSenator” is one of the most valuable monologue properties–if it\ndoes not stand in a class by itself–that has ever been written.\nFor many years it has returned to Aaron Hoffman a royalty of $100\na week, thirty and forty weeks in the year.  This may be considered\nthe record price for a monologue.",
        "(b) The vaudeville two-act varies in price as greatly as the\nmonologue.  Like the monologue, it is usually sold outright.  The\nperformers use precisely the same argument about the two-act that\nis used about the monologue.  It is maintained that the material\nitself is not to be compared with the importance of its presentation.\nWhen a two-act has been tried out and found “there,” the performers\nor the producer will offer a price for it.",
        "The same rule, that vaudeville material is worth only as much as\nit will bring, applies to the two-act.  From two hundred and fifty\ndollars to whatever you can get, may be considered suggestive of\ntwo-act prices.  Although more two-acts have sold outright for\nless than three hundred dollars than have sold above five hundred\ndollars, a successful two-act may be made to yield a far greater\nreturn if a royalty arrangement is secured.",
        "Whether it is a two-act, or any other vaudeville act, the royalty\nasking price is ten per cent of the weekly salary.  This rate is\ndifficult to enforce, and while five per cent is nearer the average,\nthe producer would rather pay a definite fixed figure each week,\nthan a percentage that must be reckoned on what may be a varying\nsalary.  Usually a compromise of a flat amount per playing week\nis made when a royalty is agreed on.",
        "(c) The playlet varies in returns amazingly.  While one small-time\nproducer pays no advance royalty and a flat weekly royalty of from\nten dollars to fifteen dollars a week–making his stand on the\nfact that he gives a longer playing season than his average\ncompetitor–many a big-time producer pays a good round advance and\nas high as $100 a week royalty.",
        "Edgar Allan Woolf has said:  “The desire for the one-act comedy is\nso great that even an unknown writer can secure an advance royalty\nas great as is paid to the author of a three-act play, if he has\nwritten a playlet which seems to possess novelty of story and\ncleverness of dialogue.”",
        "George V. Hobart is reported to have had a variously-quoted number\nof playlets playing at the same time, each one of which returned\nhim a weekly royalty of $100 a week.  And half a dozen other one-act\nplaywrights might be named who have had nearly equal success.",
        "On the other hand, Porter Emerson Brown is quoted as saying:  “The\nwork of writing a playlet is nearly as great as writing a three-act\nplay, and the returns cannot be compared.”",
        "One of the collaborators on a famous big-time success received\nforty dollars a week for three seasons as his share.  Another\nplaylet writer was paid one hundred dollars a week for one act,\nand only twenty dollars a week for another.  And a third was content\nwith a ten-dollars-a-week royalty on one act, at the same time\nthat another act of his was bringing him in fifty dollars a week.",
        "These examples I have cited to demonstrate that the return from\nthe playlet is a most variable quantity.  The small-time pays less\nthan the big-time, and each individual act on both small- and\nbig-time pays a different royalty.",
        "When a playlet–either comedy or straight dramatic–is accepted\nfor production, it is customary, although not an invariable rule,\nthat an advance royalty be paid “down.”  When the act proves\nsuccessful, one or more of three propositions may be offered the\nwriter:  outright sale at a price previously agreed upon; outright\nsale to be paid in weekly royalties until an agreed upon figure\nis reached, when ownership passes from the author to the producer;\nthe more customary weekly royalty.  As I have said before, what\nprice you receive for your act finally depends upon your keenness\nin driving a bargain.",
        "In nearly every case, outright sale has its advantage in the fact\nthat the author need not then worry about collecting his royalty.\nOf course, when a recognized producer puts out the act there need\nbe no concern about the royalty, so in such instances a royalty\nis preferable.  But in some cases, as when the performer is making\nlong jumps and has a hard time making railroad connections, a\nweekly royalty has its disadvantages in causing worry to the author.",
        "(d) The one-act musical comedy is usually bought outright–after\nthe act “gets over.”  While many a “book” is contracted for in\nadvance at a small figure, to be doubled or trebled on success,\nit is also true that royalties are paid.  In this case, the custom\nis to divide the royalty equally between the writer of the book\nand lyrics, and the composer of the music.  When a third person\nwrites the verses of the songs and ensemble numbers, the royalty\nis usually split three ways.  It would be misleading to quote any\nfigures on the musical comedy, for the reason that circumstances\nvary so greatly with each that there are no standards.",
        "(e) The burlesque tab pays about the same rates as the one-act\nmusical comedy, its kindred form.",
        "(f) The popular song, unlike the other material treated in this\nvolume, has a well established royalty price:  one cent a copy is\nthe standard.  Of this, half a cent goes to the writer of the\nlyric, and half a cent to the composer of the music.",
        "As a popular song, to be considered successful, must sell anywhere\nfrom half a million to a million copies, it is easy to estimate\nthe song-writer’s return.  If the same man writes both the words\nand the music he will receive from five to ten thousand dollars–or\ntwenty-five hundred to five thousand dollars if he divides with\nanother–for being able to make the nation whistle.  Of course,\nmany song-writers have two successful songs selling in a year–\ntherefore you may double the figures above to estimate some successful\nsong-writers’ incomes.  But it may safely be said that the song-writer\nwho has an income of twelve thousand dollars a year is doing very\nwell indeed!  There are many more professional song-writers who\nwork year after year for the salary of the average business man\nin every other line of endeavor.  Don’t count your royalty-chickens\ntoo soon.",

        "While an understanding of how a vaudeville act is transformed from\na manuscript into a commercial success may not be necessary to the\nwriting of a good act, such a knowledge is absolutely necessary\nto the writer who hopes to make money by his work.  For this reason\nI shall devote this final chapter to a brief discussion of the\nsubject.",
        "Permit me, therefore, to take the manuscript of an act, assuming\nfor my purpose that it represents a monologue or a two-act, a\nplaylet or a musical comedy, and trace its commercial career from\nthe author’s hands, into a producer’s, through a booking office,\nto success.  Anyone of the famous examples printed in this volume\ncould be so taken and its history told, but no one would combine\nin its experience all the points that should be given.  So I shall\nask you to imagine that the act whose commercial story I am about\nto tell represents in itself every kind of act to be seen in\nvaudeville.  I shall call this act by the name of “Success.”",
        "When Mr. Author, the writer of “Success,” received a letter from\nMr. Producer accepting the act and requesting him to call at his\noffice to discuss terms, Mr. Author was delighted and hurried there\nas fast as he could go.",
        "The office boy ushered him into Mr. Producer’s private office, and\nbefore the caller could get his breath Mr. Producer had made him\nan offer.  He accepted the offer without haggling over the terms,\nwhich seemed to Mr. Author very satisfactory.  To tell the truth,\nhe would have accepted almost anything, so eager was he to get his\nfirst act on the stage, so it was lucky for him that the terms\nwere really fair.",
        "He had hardly folded up the contract and stowed it, with the advance\nroyalty check, in his bosom pocket, before Mr. Producer plunged\ninto business.  He pressed a button for the office boy and told\nhim to tell Mr. Scenic Artist to come in.  Now Mr. Scenic Artist\nwas the representative of a great scenic studio, and he sketched\na design for a special set in a jiffy; then he thought of another,\nand then of a third.  And Mr. Producer and he were so interested\nin combining all their good ideas into one admirable set that Mr.\nAuthor was startled when they shoved a sketch under his nose and\nasked for suggestions.  He made two that were pertinent to the\natmosphere he had imagined for his room, and when they were\nincorporated in the sketch, Mr. Producer O. K’d it and Mr. Scenic\nArtist bowed himself out, promising to have a model ready the next\nday.",
        "Mr. Producer then rang for Miss Secretary, and told her to have\nMr. Star, Miss Leading Lady and other performers in the office\nnext morning at eleven o’clock, gave her a list of the characters\nhe wished to cast, and handed her the manuscript with an order to\nget out parts, and to have them out that night.  He turned to Mr.\nAuthor with a request for the incidental music for the act.  Mr.\nAuthor told him he had none.  Then Mr. Producer reached for the\ntelephone, with the remark that the music could wait, and called\nup the United Booking Offices of America.",
        "After a few minutes wait, Mr. Producer got the special Mr. Booking\nManager for whom he had inquired, told him he had an act for which\nhe wanted a break-in week, and as he hesitated and named a date\nthree weeks later, Mr. Author was sure the act had been booked.\nMr. Author marveled that the act should be contracted to appear\nwhen it was not even yet out of manuscript form, but when he\nmentioned this with a smile, Mr. Producer wanted to know how he\never would get “time” for an act if he didn’t engage it ahead.\nHe explained that he had a regular arrangement with Mr. House\nManager to play new acts in his house at a small “break-in” salary.\nIt was an arrangement convenient to him and gave Mr. House Manager\nfine acts at small cost.",
        "After this, Mr. Producer rose from his desk and Mr. Author went\nout, promising to be on hand that evening at eight to go over the\nmanuscript and make some changes that Mr. Producer promised to\nprove were necessary to the success of the act.  And as he passed\nthrough the outer office, Mr. Author heard Miss Secretary explain\nover the telephone that Mr. Producer wished a hall at eleven o’clock\ntwo days later to rehearse a new act.",
        "Promptly at eight o’clock that night Mr. Author presented himself\nat the office again, and found Mr. Producer busily engaged in\nreading the manuscript.  A tiny paper model of the mimic room in\nwhich the act was to be played stood upon the desk.  When he stooped\nhe saw that the walls were roughly colored after the sketch they\nhad discussed and that the whole scene bore an amazing likeness\nto the place of his imagination.  Mr. Producer explained that he\nhad had the model rushed through to make it possible for them to\n\"get down to brass tacks” at once.  The act needed so many little\nchanges that they would have to get busy to have it ready for the\nmorning.",
        "When Mr. Producer began discussing various points about the act,\nMr. Author could not for the life of him imagine what all these\nchanges could be.  But when Mr. Producer pointed out the first,\nMr. Author wondered how he ever had imagined that the heroine could\ndo the little thing he had made her do–it was physically impossible.\nPoint after point Mr. Producer questioned, and point after point\nthey changed, but there was only the one glaring error.  A motive\nwas added here, a bit of business was changed there, and as they\nworked they both grew so excited that they forget the time, forgot\neverything but that act.  And when the manuscript at last dropped\nfrom their exhausted hands, it looked as if an army had invaded it.",
        "Mr. Author glanced at the pile of nicely bound parts and sighed.\nAll that work would have to be done over!  “Only another one of my\nmistakes,” smiled Mr. Producer as he scribbled an order to Miss\nSecretary, attached it to the manuscript, together with these now\nuseless parts, and laid them on her desk, as he and Mr. Author\nwent out into the cool night air.  “See you tomorrow at eleven,\"\nsaid Mr. Producer as they parted.  And Mr. Author looking at his\nwatch wondered why he should take the trouble to go home at all.",
        "At eleven Mr. Author found the little outer office crowded with\nactors and actresses.  Miss Secretary was busily directing the\ntyping of the new manuscript and parts.  Mr. Producer was late.\nAfter Mr. Author had waited an hour in the private office, Miss\nSecretary came in and said he should wait no longer, because Mr.\nProducer had been called out of town to straighten out some trouble\nwhich had developed in one of his acts and had just telephoned\nthat he would not be in until late that afternoon.  Rehearsal would\nbe as scheduled next morning, Miss Secretary explained.  The\nperformers would be on hand, and she hoped to goodness they would\nhave some idea of their parts by then.  Mr. Author wanted to know\nhow the cast could be engaged when Mr. Producer was away, and Miss\nSecretary told him that Mr. Producer knew the capabilities of\neveryone who had called and had even directed her to engage the\nones he named.",
        "The following morning Mr. Author saw his characters for the\nfirst time in the flesh–and was disappointed.  Also, the rehearsal\nwas a sad awakening; it wasn’t anything like he had imagined it\nwould be.  They all sat around on chairs and Mr. Producer told\nthem what the act was all about.  Then he suggested that they go\nthrough it once, at any rate.  Chairs were placed to mark the\nfootlights, chairs were used to indicate the doors and window, and\nchairs were made to do duty as a table, a piano and everything\nelse.",
        "Finally they got started and limped through the lines, reading\ntheir parts.  Then Mr. Producer began to show them how he wanted\nit done, and before he had finished he had played every part in\nthe act.  They went through the act once more with a myriad of\ninterruptions from Mr. Producer, who insisted on getting things\nright the very first time, and then he knocked off, calling it a\nday’s work.",
        "The next morning Mr. Author was on hand early with some suggestions:\none Mr. Producer adopted, the others he explained into forgetfulness–and\nrehearsing began in earnest.  They worked all morning on the first\nquarter of the act and went back at it late that afternoon.  Miss\nLeading Lady unconsciously added one line and it was so good that\nit was kept in the act.  Then Mr. Star did something that made\nthem all laugh, and they put that in.  Of course some pretty lines\nin the dialogue had to come out to make room, but they came out,\nand Mr. Author never regretted their loss.  And the next day it\nwas the same, and the day after that, and the seventh day, and the\neighth day.",
        "Then came a day when Mr. Author saw the act taking shape and form,\nand when he spoke to Mr. Producer about it, Mr. Producer said he\nthought that after all the act might whip around into something\npretty good.",
        "A few days later when Mr. Author arrived at the rehearsal hall,\nthere were three strange men facing the company, who were going\nthrough the act for the first time without interruptions from Mr.\nProducer.  Mr. Author wondered who they were, and watched their\nfaces with interest to see how they liked his act.  After a while\nhe came to consider as great compliments the ghosts of smiles\nflickering across their jury-like faces.  And when it was all over\nthe performers gathered in one corner, and Mr. Producer came over\nto him, and the three men whispered among themselves.  Mr. Producer\nexplained that they were booking managers, and then Mr. Author\nsensed the psychological reason for the unconscious drawing together\nof the different clans.",
        "His heart beat rather violently when the three men came across the\nroom, and he felt a great wave of gladness sweep over him when the\ntallest of the three pulled out a little black book and said, “Mr.\nProducer, I’ll pencil it in one of my houses for next week at this\nfigure,” and he showed Mr. Producer what he had written.",
        "“And I’ll take you for the second break-in, as we agreed when you\n’phoned,” said the shortest man.  “And I’ll take the third at\nthat.”",
        "Then it was that Mr. Author felt a great admiration for Mr. Producer,\nbecause Mr. Producer dared assert his personality.  Mr. Producer\nobjected to the figure, talking of the “name” of Mr. Star.",
        "“That’s every penny he’s worth,” came the adamant answer.",
        "Then Mr. Producer mentioned transportation costs, and the cost of\nhauling scenery, as additional arguments.",
        "“Why didn’t you say special set at first?” said the smallest man;\n\"I’ll give you this advance.”  Then all four looked, and they all\nagreed.",
        "Then Mr. Author was introduced, quite casually.  “Guess your act’ll\nget by,” conceded one of the jury generously, as they all left.",
        "“So you’re going to open a week earlier?” gasped Mr. Author to Mr.\nProducer, when they were alone in the interval between the exit\nof the three and the entrance upon the scene of the performers,\nwho came swiftly across the room to learn their fate.  “And you’ve\nbooked three weeks more!”",
        "“Well,” said Mr. Producer, “you know the boys only pencilled those\nweeks in–pencil marks can be rubbed out.”",
        "The next day as they were on their way to the train to go up to\nthe town where the act was to open, Mr. Producer suddenly remembered\nthat he had forgotten to send Miss Secretary up to the Booking\nOffices for his contract.  He wanted that contract particularly,\nfor he had a feud of long standing with the manager of that\nparticular house.  So up he rushed to get that contract, with Mr.\nAuthor tagging at his heels.",
        "It was the first time Mr. Author had seen even the waiting room\nof a booking office–it amazed him by its busy air.  A score or\nmore performers crowded its every inch of space.  They were thickest\naround a little grilled window, behind which stood a boy who seemed\nto know them all.  Some he dismissed with a “Come in tomorrow.\"\nOthers he talked with at length, and took their cards.  When he\nhad a handful he disappeared from the window.",
        "But Mr. Producer was calling Mr. Author.  Mr. Producer stood holding\nopen the inner door.  So in Mr. Author went–to another surprise.\nHere there was no crush of people–here there was no rush, and\nlittle noise.  Stenographers stood about, seemingly idle, and at\na dozen little desks sat a dozen men quietly bending over rather\nodd-looking books, or talking with the few men who came in.",
        "One of these men Mr. Author recognized as Mr. Booking Manager, for\nwhom they were to play the second week.  He was about to speak to\nhim, when up came a bustling little man who said, “Do you want\nMiss Headliner for the week of the thirtieth?  I can give her to\nyou.”",
        "“Nope, all filled.  Give you the week of the twenty-third.”",
        "“All right.”",
        "Mr. Booking Agent made a note in his little book, and Mr. Booking\nManager bent over his desk and wrote Miss Headliner’s name in his\nbig book–and a business transaction was consummated.",
        "Then Mr. Booking Agent hustled over to another desk and repeated\nhis offer of the week of the thirtieth.",
        "“Sorry, give you the week of the twenty-third,” said this man.",
        "“Just filled it,” said Mr. Booking Agent.  “Can’t you give me the\nthirtieth?  Who’s got the thirtieth open?”",
        "The man at the next desk heard him.  “Who for?  Miss Headliner?\nAll right, I’ll take her.”",
        "Just then Mr. Producer came out of a little room and Mr. Author\nfollowed him in a wild dash to catch the train.  In the smoker he\nasked Mr. Producer to explain what he had seen in the Booking\nOffices.  And Mr. Producer said:  “Each one of those men you saw\nup there is in charge of the shows of one, or maybe three or four\nvaudeville theatres in different cities.  It is their duty to make\nup the shows that appear in each of their houses.  For instance,\nMr. Booking Manager, whose house we are playing this week, books\nthe shows in four other houses.",
        "“The man you heard ask him if he would take Miss Headliner for the\nthirtieth, is Miss Headliner’s business representative.  His name\nis Mr. Booking Agent.  Besides Miss Headliner, he is the representative\nfor maybe fifty other acts.  For this service he receives a\ncommission of five per cent of Miss Headliner’s salary and five\nper cent on the salaries of all the acts for whom he gets work.\nIt is his business to keep Miss Headliner booked, and he is paid\nby her and his other clients for keeping them working.",
        "“Mr. Booking Manager, on the other hand, is not paid a commission.\nHe receives a flat salary for the work that he does for his houses.\nYou remember you met him yesterday, when he pencilled ’Success’\nin for the house we are on our way to play.  Well, that is also a\npart of his business.  For some of his houses that like to make a\nbig showing at little expense, he must dig up new big acts like\nours, which are breaking-in.",
        "“Now, the price I get for this act for the breaking-in weeks, is\nmighty low.  But this is customary.  That is the reason why the\nperformers have to be content with half salaries, and you with\nhalf-royalty.  But this price does not affect the future price I\nwill receive.  It is marked on the books as the ’show price.’ That\nmeans that it is recorded in the book-keeping department by the\ncashier as the price for which I am showing this act to the managers.\nWhen the act has made good, a price is set on the act, and that\nis the standard price for the other houses that book through these\noffices.  The book-keeper watches the prices like a hawk, and if\nI tried to ’sneak a raise over,’ he would catch it, and both yours\ntruly and Mr. Booking Manager would be called up on the carpet by\nthe head of the Offices.  The only increase that is permitted is\nwhen a new season rolls around, or two or three booking managers\nagree to an increase and consult the office head about boosting\nthe salary on the books.”",
        "That night Mr. Author rather expected to see a dress rehearsal of\nthe act; he was disappointed.  But the next morning there was a\nfull dress rehearsal, played in the brand new special set which\nhad come up with them and that now shone like a pretty picture in\nthe dingy theatre.",
        "It rather amazed Mr. Author to note that the emphasis of this\nrehearsal was not put on the speeches, but upon the entrances and\nexits, and the precise use and disposal of the various properties\nemployed.  A glimmering of the reason came to him when Mr. Star\npromised to murder anyone who moved a book that he used in his\n\"big” scene.  “Unless it is here–right here–I’ll never be able\nto reach it and get back for the next bit without running.”",
        "And so the rehearsal went on, with no effort to improve the lines,\nbut only to blend the physical movements of everyone of the\nperformers to make a perfect whole and to heighten the natural\neffect of even the most natural action.  Then the dress rehearsal\ncame to an end, and the entire party went out to see the town.",
        "That night, after the performance, they worked again on the act,\nbecause Mr. Producer had been seized by an idea.  And when they\nhad gone through the act time and again to incorporate that idea,\nthey all went wearily to bed, praying for success next day.",
        "At ten o’clock in the morning Mr. Author was at the theatre.  He\nfound that other acts had preceded him.  The stage was littered\nwith trunks and scenery, trapeze bars, animal cages and the what-not\nof a vaudeville show.  Each performer as he came in was greeted\nby the doorman with the gift of a brass check, on which there was\nstamped a number.  This number told the performer in what order\nhe was entitled to rehearse.  Vaudeville is a democracy–first\ncome, first rehearsed.",
        "The stage hands were busy rolling in trunks which express-men had\ndumped on the sidewalk, the electrician was busy mentally rehearsing\nlight effects according to the formula on a printed light plot\nwhich was being explained to him by a performer.  “Props” was busy\ntrying to satisfy everyone with what he had on hand, or good-naturedly\nsending out for what had not been clearly specified on the property\nplot.  The spot-light man in the gallery out front was busy getting\nhis lamp ready for the matinee, and consulting his light plot.\nAnd the stage-manager was quite the busiest one of them all, shoving\nhis scenery here and there to make room for the newly arrived sets,\ndirecting the flying of the hanging stuff, and settling questions\nwith the directness of a czar.",
        "Suddenly through the caverny house sounded the noise of the orchestra\ntuning up.  The leader appeared and greeted the performers he knew\nlike long lost brothers and sisters, and then Brass Check Number\nOne dropped into his hand, and the Monday morning rehearsal began.\nThen it was that Mr. Author learned that it is not the acts, which\nare rehearsed on Monday morning, it is the vaudeville orchestra,\nand the light men and “Props.”",
        "This was borne in forcibly when Mr. Producer arrived with the\nperformers and “Success” went into rehearsal.  Although the entire\nstaff of the theatre had been rehearsed the night before at the\nfinal dress rehearsal, Mr. Producer wished to change some lights,\nto instruct “Props” more clearly, and to jack up the orchestra\ninto perfection.  Therefore they all went through the act once\nmore.  Then the scrub-women appeared and demanded the centre of\nthe stage with great swishes of watery cloths.  The curtain came\ndown to hide the stage from the front of the house, and the first\nearly comers of the audience filtered in.",
        "Mr. Author has never been able to recall just how “Success” played\nthat first performance.  He has dim memories of a throbbing heart,\nfears that lines would be forgotten or the whole “big” scene fall\nto pieces; and finally of a vast relief when the curtain came down,\namid–applause.  The curtain went up and came down a number of\ntimes, but Mr. Author was too busy pinching himself to make sure\nthat he wasn’t dreaming, to count how many curtains the act took.",
        "It seemed to him like a tremendous hit, but Mr. Producer was in a\nrage.  There were scores of points that had not “got over,” half\na dozen of his finest effects had been ruined, and he was bound\nthose points should “get over,” and those effects shine out clear\nand big.",
        "Looking back on that week, Mr. Author recalls it as a nightmare\nof changes.  They cut out speeches, and changed speeches, and took\nout bits of business, and added new bits–they changed everything\nin the act, and some of the changes they changed back again, until\nby Saturday the act was hardly to be recognized.  And then they\nplayed two more performances to crowded houses that applauded like\nmadmen; and Mr. Producer smiled for the first time.",
        "Then they moved to the next theatre, and the first performance\nshowed even Mr. Author that all the work had been wise.  Now he\nwas even more anxious than Mr. Producer to make the many changes\nby which this week was marked.  And by the end of the week “Success\"\nlooked like–success.",
        "They were preparing for a week of great things in the next town,\nwhen Wednesday night a cancellation notice came for that precious\nweek.  Something had gone wrong, and the pencilled date had to be\nrubbed out.  Of course, by all the laws of the legislatures that\nweek should never have been rubbed out, because there was a contract\nfully binding on both the theatre and Mr. Producer.  But the week\nwas rubbed out of sight, nevertheless, and Mr. Producer–knowing\nvaudeville necessities and also knowing that only the most dire\nnecessity made Mr. Booking Manager “do this thing to him\"–forgave\nit all with a smile and was quite ready to get back to town when\nMonday morning rolled around.",
        "But Monday morning there occurred a “disappointment” at another\ntheatre in a town only a few miles away.  The act that was to have\nplayed that date was wrecked, or had overslept itself.  Anyway.\nthe resident house manager telephoned to the Booking Offices that\nhe was shy one act.  Now it happened that the act that “disappointed,\"\nwas of the same general character as “Success.”  The Booking Manager\nknew this, and remembered that “Success” was within a few miles\nand with an open week that ought to have been filled.  Therefore,\njust as Mr. Producer and Mr. Author were leaving the hotel to join\nthe other members of “Success” at the railroad station.  Mr.\nProducer was called to the telephone–long distance.",
        "In less time than it takes to recount it, the resident manager who\nwas suffering from a disappointment, and Mr. Producer, suffering\nfrom the lack of a playing week, were both cured of their maladies\nat the same time.  And so, instead of going back to town, “Success\"\nrushed to the next city and played its week.",
        "Now, in this last week of breaking-in, Mr. Author realized one\nfact that stands out rather prominently in his memory; it is a\nsimple little fact, yet it sums up the entire problem of the show\nbusiness.  Perhaps the rush of events had made it impossible before\nfor the truth to strike home as keenly as it did when there suddenly\ncame to him a tiny little bit of business which made a very long\nspeech unnecessary.  He explained it to Mr. Producer, and Mr.\nProducer seized on it instantly and put it into the act.  That\nnight the act went better than it had ever gone before.  This\nlittle bit of condensation, this illuminating flash which was\nresponsible for it, “punched up” the big scene into a life it had\nnever had before.  Then it was that there also flashed upon Mr.\nAuthor’s mind this truth:",
        "A dramatic entertainment is not written on paper.  It is written\nwith characters of flesh and blood.  Strive as hard as man may,\nhe can never fully foretell how an ink-written act will play.\nThere is an inexplicable something which playing before an audience\ndevelops.  Both the audience and the actors on the stage are\naffected.  A play–the monologue and every musical form as well–is\none thing in manuscript, another thing in rehearsal, and quite a\ndifferent thing before an audience.  Playing before an audience\nalone shows what a play truly is.  Therefore, a play can only be\nmade–after it is produced.  Even in the fourth week of playing–the\nfirst week of metropolitan playing–Mr. Author and Mr. Producer\nmade many changes in “Success” that were responsible for the long\npopularity it enjoyed.  Mr. Author had learned his lesson well.\nHe approached his next work with clearer eyes.",

When the\norchestra begins the music for the act, the girl enters, dressed\nin a fashionable tailor-made gown, and carrying parasol.  She comes\non laughing, from L., and glancing back over her shoulder at THE\nFELLOW, who follows after her, a few paces behind.  THE GIRL wears\nonly one glove, and THE FELLOW is holding out the other one to her\nas he makes his entrance.  He is dressed in a natty light summer\nsuit and wears a neat straw hat.",
        "THE GIRL:  (As she comes on with a little run.)  I don’t see why on\nearth you insist upon following me.",
        "THE FELLOW:  (Lifting his hat.)  I never knew why I was on earth\nuntil I met you.  (Waving glove at her.)  Say, this is your glove–you\nknow it’s your glove.",
        "THE GIRL:  (Laughingly.)  It must belong to somebody else.",
        "THE FELLOW:  No, it doesn’t. I saw you drop it.  Besides, you are\nwearing only one glove, and this one matches it.",
        "THE GIRL:  (Stopping on right of stage near rustic bench and turning\nto face him, holding out her hand.)  You are right.  It is my\nglove.  I’ll take it, please.",
        "THE FELLOW:  (Stopping to gaze at her admiringly.)  No, on second\nthought, I’ll keep it.  (He folds it up tenderly, and places it in\nthe upper left-hand pocket of his coat.)  I’ll keep it right here,\ntoo,–near my heart.",
        "THE GIRL:  Oh, what nonsense!  You’ve never seen me but three times\nin your life.",
        "THE FELLOW:  (Coming nearer her.)  Yes–that’s true.  And you look\nbetter every time I see you.  Say, you do look awfully nice this\nmorning.  Nobody would think, from your appearance, that you\nbelonged to a camping party here on the shore of Lake George.  I\nguess that thunder storm last night didn’t bother you a little\nbit.  Why, you look as if you were out for a stroll on Fifth Avenue.",

        "THE FELLOW:  (Aside.)  This suit of clothes I got from Tommy Higgins\nhas made a hit with her.  I guess I’ll just let her think they\nbelong to me, and won’t tell her that I got soaked in the rain\nlast night.  (To her, lifting his hat again.)  I’m tickled nearly\nto death to have you say such complimentary things to me.  It makes\nme glad I came on this camping trip.",

        "THE FELLOW:  (Coming still nearer.)  Don’t be rash.  There’s no place\nto go.  All of your camping party have gone on a boating trip\nexcept yourself.  You’re surely not going back there and hang\naround the camp all alone?",
        "THE GIRL:  (In surprise.)  How did YOU know that the rest of my party\nhad gone away for the day?",
        "THE FELLOW:  I saw ’em start.  Why didn’t you go with ’em?",
        "THE GIRL:  I had nothing to wear but this tailor-made gown, and a\ngirl can’t go boating in a dress like this.  I only intended to\nstay two days when I came up here from New York to join the camp,\nand was not prepared with enough clothes.  I’ve sent home for\nclothes and am expecting them to arrive at the camp this morning–\nthat’s why I didn’t go boating, since you are impertinent enough\nto ask.  (She gives him an indignant look.)",

        "THE GIRL:  (Laughing.)  Well, you are so fresh that I can’t be mad\nat you.  You’re too funny.  Since you want to know so much, he got\nme on the knee.  I wasn’t far-seeing enough to bring mosquito\nnetting.  It’s a bad bite.",
        "THE FELLOW:  Is it possible?",
        "THE GIRL:  Don’t you believe it?",

How about this one?\n(She thrusts her hand into the lower left-hand pocket, and pulls\nout a letter, written on dainty writing paper.)  Ah! this is what\nI expected to find.  Perfumed note paper.

I–(Suddenly a look of enlightenment comes into his\nface.  Aside, he says.)  By thunder!–I had forgotten all about it.\nThis suit of clothes belongs to Tommy Higgins.

Say–listen\nto me, honestly that letter was not written to me, Tommy Higgins,\nyou see–",
        "THE GIRL:  (Waving him aside.)  No excuses.  You probably thought\nyou didn’t have it with you.  Falsehoods are always found out, you\nsee.  I was right.  You are like all the rest of the men–a born\nliar–only with this difference–you are a bigger liar than the\naverage.  You are really in a class all by yourself.

I didn’t\nwant to listen to you in the first place.  Here is your affinity’s\nletter, sir.  (She hands it to him.  He takes it and stuffs it\nangrily into the coat pocket.)  Now, let me have my parasol, please,\nand my glove.  (She reaches for the parasol, but he catches it up\nand holds it behind his back, as he rises from the bench.)",

Here–read it yourself, if you don’t\nbelieve me this time.  (THE GIRL wonderingly takes the letter and\nreads it to herself, her lips moving and her eyes wide open in\nsurprise.)",

        "THE FELLOW:  (Taking her by the shoulder and speaking quickly.)\nNow, you’ve got to listen.  That other letter was written to Tommy\nHiggins.  I was caught in the shower last night, and had to borrow\nthis suit of clothes from Tommy.",

        "ANGELA:  Thanks–I brought my own tea with me.  (Takes a little paper\nbag of tea out of one of the slippers and crosses to MISS CAREY.)\nIf I had struck him with the vase, I could understand his calling\nme “Vixen” (Beginning to weep again.)–but I only flung it at him,\n’cause I cracked it by accident in the morning, and I didn’t want\nhim to find it out.  He was always calling me “butter-fingers.\"\n(Sits at opposite side of table.)",
        "MISS CAREY:  Oh, he was always calling you names.",
        "ANGELA:  No, that’s all he ever called me–\"Butter-fingers.”  (Cries\nagain.)",
        "MISS CAREY:  (Pouring tea.)  Oh, he’s the kind that just loves to\nstay home and nag.",
        "ANGELA:  I’d like to catch any husband I ever get, nag.",
        "MISS CAREY:  Oh, a pouter–I know that kind.",
        "ANGELA:  Oh, no.  Why, every time I insulted him he kissed me–the\nbrute.  (After a second’s pause.)  But–excuse me–how do you know\nso many kinds of men if you’ve never been married?",
        "MISS CAREY:  (Quickly.)  Boarders–to make ends meet, I’ve always\nhad to have a male boarder since I was left an orphan.  (She\nrises–turns her back to audience–gives a touch to her pigtail,\nduring the laugh to this line.  This business always builds laugh.)",
        "ANGELA:  (Absent-mindedly.)  Well, I’ve heard that male boarders are\nvery nice.",
        "MISS CAREY:  I’ve never had a nice one yet, but I’ve named nearly\nall the style male brutes there are.  What kind of a brute have\nyou?  (She sips tea.)",
        "ANGELA:  Why, I don’t know–I’ve often wondered–you might call\nHarry a “lollard.”",
        "MISS CAREY:  A lollard?",
        "ANGELA:  Yes, I invented the word, and believe me, a woman suffers\nwith a lollard.  (At this, MISS CAREY lets her spoon fall in cup.)",
        "MISS CAREY:  I should think she would.  How did a sweet young thing\nlike you ever meet such a type of a vertebrate?",
        "ANGELA:  At a military ball, and oh Mrs.–",
        "MISS CAREY:  Miss Carey.",
        "ANGELA:  Miss Carey–he was the handsomest specimen.  His hair\nlooked so spick–his shoulders were so big and broad–his teeth\nso white–and his skin, well, Miss Carey, if you’d seen him, I’ll\nbet you’d have just gone crazy to kiss him yourself.  (MISS CAREY,\nwho is drinking tea, nearly chokes on this–coughing on the tea\nwhich goes down the wrong way.)",
        "MISS CAREY:  (After the business.)  How did he lose his looks?",
        "ANGELA:  By becoming a lollard.  Listen!  (They pull chairs in front\nof table together, teacups in hand.)  It happened on the honeymoon–\non the train–as we sat hand in hand, when all at once, the wind\nthrough the window, started to blow his hair the wrong way, and\noh, Miss Carey, what do you think I discovered?",
        "MISS CAREY: He had been branded on the head as a criminal.",
        "ANGELA:  Oh nothing so pleasant as that–but the hair that I thought\ngrew so lovely and plentifully, had been coaxed by a wet brush\nfrom the back over the front, and from the east over to the west.\n(Indicates by imitating action on her own head.)",
        "MISS CAREY: Oh, a lollard is a disappointment of the hair.",
        "ANGELA: No, Miss Carey, no.  Listen.  I said, “Oh, Harry, your\nhair which I thought grew so evenly and plentifully all over your\nhead really only grows in patches.”  He only answered, “Yes, and\nnow that we’re married, Angela, I don’t have to fool you by brushing\nit fancy anymore.”  In despair, I moaned “Yes, Harry–fool me–go\non love, fool me and brush it fancy.”",
        "MISS CAREY; (Rising and crossing R.)  That was your first mistake.\nNo woman should ever call any man “love.”",
        "ANGELA:  Oh, I didn’t know what I said–I was so busy the whole\njourney pulling his hair from the back to the front and the east\nto the west (Same business of illustrating.)–and then, oh Miss\nCarey, what do you think was the next thing I discovered?",
        "MISS CAREY:  (In horror.)  His teeth only grew in patches.",
        "ANGELA:  No, but I had fallen in love with a pair of tailor’s\nshoulder-pads–yes–when he took off his coat that night, he shrunk\nso, I screamed (Pause–as laugh comes here.)–thinking I was in a\nroom with a strange man–but all he muttered was “Angie, I can\nloll about in easy things now, I’m married\"–and that’s how gradually\nhis refined feet began to look like canal-boats–his skin only\nlooked kissable the days he shaved–twice a week–his teeth became\ntobacco stained–and to-night–to-night, Miss Carey, he stopped\nwearing hemstitched pajamas and took to wearing canton flannel\nnight shirts.  (In depth of woe after the big laugh this gets.)\nMiss Carey, have you ever seen a man in a canton flannel night\nshirt?",
        "MISS CAREY:  (After an expression of horror.)  I told you I am not\nmarried.",
        "ANGELA:  (Innocently.)  Oh, excuse me, I was thinking of your boarders.\n(MISS CAREY screams “what” and shows herself insulted beyond words.)\nIs it any wonder my love for him has grown cold?  Men expect a\nwoman to primp up for them–we must always look our best to hold\ntheir love–but once they wheedle us into signing our names to the\nmarriage contract–they think (Suddenly, seeing dress again.)–Oh\nMiss Carey, what do you charge for a frock like that?",
        "MISS CAREY:  I have no night rates for gowns, Mrs.–",
        "ANGELA:  Just call me Angie–’cause I probably will live with you\nnow.  (Slips her arm through MISS CAREY’S, laying her head on the\nolder woman’s shoulder.)",
        "MISS CAREY:  (Disengaging her.)  We’ll talk that over in the morning–\nif you want, you may sleep upon that couch–I’ll put out the light.\n(She does so.)  I’m going to bed–I must get a little rest.  (She\ngives a sharp turn and goes to her room.  Blue light floods stage.\nThrough the half open curtain she is seen having trouble with her\nbed covers–getting them too high up, then too far down, etc.  Big\nlaughs on this business.)",
        "ANGELA:  (Taking down hair.)  Miss Carey, you said you were an\norphan–I’m an orphan, too.  (There is no answer.)  I can’t tell you\nhow I appreciate your insisting on my staying–let me make your\nbreakfast in the morning, Miss Carey.  (No answer.)  Harry might at\nleast try to find me.  Aren’t men brutes, Miss Carey?",
        "MISS CAREY:  (Loudly from within.)  They certainly are.",
        "ANGELA:  (Lets peignoir slip off her shoulders, is in pretty silk\npajamas.)  In the morning, I must think how I can earn my own living.\n(She lies down as snores come from next room.)  Miss Carey, are you\nasleep?  (Snore.)  Oh dear, she’s asleep before I am–she might have\nwaited.  (A key is heard in the door–Angela sits up in alarm–as\nkey turns, she screams.)  Oh Miss Carey, wake up–someone’s at the\ndoor–wake up.  (Miss Carey jumps up and out of bed.)",
        "MISS CAREY:  Good Lord–what is it now?  (Puts up light–the door\nopens, and immaculately dressed, handsome young man in evening\nclothes, white gloves, etc., enters–FRED SALTUS.)",
        "ANGELA:  Burglars!  (She runs behind curtain of MISS CAREY’S room.)",
        "MISS CAREY:  You simpleton.  I told you I had a male boarder.  This\nis it, Mr. Saltus.",
        "FRED:  Oh, Miss Carey, pardon me–I’d have come in by the back door,\nbut I didn’t know you were entertaining company.",
        "MISS CAREY:  I’m not entertaining anyone–I’m trying to get a little\nrest before it’s time for me to get up–and young lady, if you’ll\ncome out of my room and let me in, I’ll beg of you not to disturb\nme again.  (She shoves ANGELA out in her pajamas, unintentionally\nknocking her into MR. SALTUS, and goes back to bed.) (Ad. lib.\ntalk.)",
        "ANGELA:  (Embarrassed and rushing behind the frock on the dressmaker’s\nfigure.)  I’ve made her awfully cross–but I thought it must be a\nburglar–’cause, you see, I never knew boarders were allowed out\nso late at night.",
        "FRED:  (Recognizing her.)  What are you doing here?",
        "ANGELA:  (Forced to confess.)  I’ve left my husband.  (He gives a\nwhistle of surprise.) You know he’s the man on the floor below–you\nmay have seen me with him–once in a great while.",
        "FRED:  I’ve seen you often (Delighted.)–and so you’ve left him, eh?",
        "ANGELA:  Yes–and I’m really quite upset about it–naturally he’s\nthe first husband I’ve ever left–and you can imagine how a woman\nfeels if you’ve left your husband–that is your wife.  (All in one\nbreath.)  Are you married?",
        "FRED:  No indeed–not a chance.",
        "ANGELA:  (Quickly fishes her opera cloak off couch–slips it over\nher and goes to couch.)  Then come here and sit down.  (He does so.)\nI should think the girls would all be crazy about you.",
        "FRED:  Oh–they are–are you boarding here too now?",
        "ANGELA:  Yes, but Miss Carey doesn’t know it yet.",
        "FRED:  Tell me, have you ever noticed me coming in or going out of\nthe building?",
        "ANGELA:  Oh yes, indeed–I used to point you out to Harry and show\nhim how you always looked so immaculate and dapper–just as he\nused to look before we were married.  (Starting to weep.)",
        "FRED:  Oh, you’ll go back to your home to-morrow.",
        "ANGELA:  No–I’ll never enter it again–never again–except for\nlunch.",
        "FRED:  Then you’re planning a divorce?",
        "ANGELA:  (As it dawns on her–with a smile.)  I suppose it would be\nwell to get something like that.",
        "FRED:  Is he in love with another woman?",
        "ANGELA:  (Indignantly.)  My Harry–I guess not.  (His hand is stretched\ntoward her–in anger she slaps it.)",
        "FRED:  Then you’ll never get it (Making love to her.) unless you\nfall in love with another man and let your husband get the divorce.",
        "ANGELA:  (Innocently.)  I think I’d like that better–I’ll tell Miss\nCarey (She approaches curtain–a snore makes her change her\nmind.)–I’ll tell her later.",
        "FRED:  I’m awfully glad I’m a fellow boarder here.  (He advances\nto her–as he is about to put his arm about her–suddenly a pounding\non door and a gruff voice without:) Open–open!",
        "ANGELA:  (In terror.)  Oh, it’s my husband–it’s Harry.",
        "FRED:  Don’t talk, or he’ll hear you.",
        "ANGELA:  I’ll hide–and you open, or he’ll break down the door.",
        "FRED:  I’ll have nothing to do with this mixup.",
        "HARRY:  (Loudly, without.)  Open, or I’ll bang–down–the–door.",
        "ANGELA:  If you don’t open, he’ll do it–he’s a regular “door-banger.”",
        "FRED:  Well, I’ll not.",
        "ANGELA:  Then I’ll get Miss Carey.  (Up to curtains again.)  Miss\nCarey–Miss Carey–get up.",
        "MISS CAREY:  (Sticking her head out of curtains.)  My Gawd, what is\nit now?",
        "ANGELA:  (After struggle as to how to explain.)  My husband is here\nto see us.",
        "MISS CAREY:  Confound your husband.",
        "HARRY:  (Outside.)  I want my wife.",
        "ANGELA:  (Pleading.)  Oh, Miss Carey, the poor man wants his wife–\ntell him I’m not here.",
        "MISS CAREY:  (Jumping up–to FRED.)  You go to your room, Mr.\nSaltus–I’ll bet you were afraid to open the door.  (FRED goes to\nhis room.)  And you go into my bed–if he sees you, I’ll never get\nany sleep.",
        "ANGELA:  Don’t hurt my Harry’s feelings, Miss Carey–he’s awfully\nsensitive.  (She goes behind curtains.)",
        "MISS CAREY:  No, I won’t hurt his feelings–(Opening door fiercely\nfor HARRY.)  What do you want?",
        "HARRY:  (Pushing her aside as he rushes in.)  My wife–she’s in here.",
        "MISS CAREY:  (Following him down.)  She’s not here–and you get\nout–what do you mean by waking me up at this hour?",
        "HARRY:  I’ve waked up everybody else in the building–why should\nyou sleep?",
        "MISS CAREY:  I’ve never seen you before, but now that I have, I\ndon’t wonder your wife left you.",
        "HARRY:  Madam, you look like a woman who could sympathize with a\nman.",
        "MISS CAREY:  With a man?  Never–now get out.",
        "HARRY:  (Making a tour of the room–she following.)  Not till I’ve\nsearched your place–my wife must be here.",
        "MISS CAREY:  I don’t know your wife–and I don’t want to.",
        "HARRY:  Why, madam–I’m crazy about her–suppose I’m the only man\nin the world who would be, but she’s my doll.",
        "MISS CAREY:  Well, you’ve lost your doll–good night.",
        "HARRY:  Oh, I’ll get her back again–but a change has seemed to\ncome over her of late, and to-night she broke out in a fury and\nhit me violently over the head with a Wedgewood vase.",
        "ANGELA:  (Rushing out–ready to slap him again.)  Oh Harry, I did\nnot–it never touched you.",
        "MISS CAREY:  (Throwing up her hands.)  Now I’ll never get to sleep.",
        "HARRY:  (Turning on MISS CAREY.)  Oh, I understand it all–it’s you\nwho’ve come between us–you designing, deceitful homebreaker.",
        "MISS CAREY:  You leave my apartment–you impertinent man.",
        "HARRY:  Not without my wife.",
        "ANGELA:  Then you’ll stay forever–’cause I’m not going with you.\n(She sits right of little table.)",
        "MISS CAREY:  See here–you argue this out between you–but I’m going\nto bed–but don’t you argue above a whisper or I’ll ring for the\npolice–the idea of you two galavanting about my apartments.\n(Going behind curtains.)",
        "(A funny scene ensues between husband and wife–they start their\nargument in whispered pantomime–she shakes her finger at him–he\nshakes back at her–it finally grows slightly louder and louder\nuntil they are yelling at each other.)",
        "ANGELA:  (Screaming.)  If you say the vase hit you–you’re a wicked–",
        "HARRY:  I don’t care anything about the vase–you’re coming downstairs\nwith me.  (He pulls her off chair and swings her R.)",
        "ANGELA:  (Falling on couch.)  I’m not.",
        "HARRY:  (Grabbing her again.)  You are.",
        "ANGELA:  I’m not.  (He tries to pull her to door–she bites his\nfinger, and breaking away, runs up to curtains again.)  Miss Carey,\nMiss Carey, wake up, he bit me.  (MISS CAREY dashes out in fury,\nANGELA hangs to her.)  Oh, Miss Carey, you’re the only one I have\nin all the world to keep me from this monster.  Oh, Miss Carey,\npity me, make believe you’re my mother.",
        "MISS CAREY:  I told you I’m not married.",
        "ANGELA:  Well, think how you’d feel if you were and I were your own\nlittle girl and a wicked man was ill-treating me, etc.  (She finally\ntouches the mother vein in MISS CAREY.)",
        "MISS CAREY:  (Affected.)  Go into my room, dear.  (She leads her up\nto bed behind curtains.  After Angela disappears behind curtains,\nMISS CAREY turns–facing HARRY.)  I’ll settle with this viper.\n(Coming down.)  Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?",
        "HARRY:  Why should I’be ashamed?",
        "MISS CAREY:  (Resolutely.)  Because you’re a lollard.",
        "HARRY:  I’m what?",
        "MISS CAREY:  You’re one of those vile creatures whose hair grows\nfrom east to west.  (Dramatically.)  Where are your refined feet\nnow? )",
        "HARRY:  (Thinking she’s mad.)  What on earth are you talking about?",
        "MISS CAREY:  The man she fell in love with and married was spick\nand span–his shoulders were big and broad–his teeth were white–and\nhis skin–well, if he were standing before me now, I’d be just\ncrazy to kiss him myself.",
        "HARRY:  I was all that you say when I married her–that’s how I won\nher.",
        "MISS CAREY:  And now you’re not all that I say–that’s how you lost\nher.  You can’t blame a little woman if she thinks she’s getting\na man of gold and she finds she’s got a gold brick.",
        "HARRY:  Why, I’m not different now than I was then–only before I was\nmarried I was like all men, I did everything to appear at my best–\nto fool her.",
        "MISS CAREY:  Fool her now–we women love to be fooled.  We want to\nbe proud of our husbands.  Most of us get gold bricks, but we don’t\nwant anyone else to know it.",
        "HARRY:  By George, there may be something in all this.  How did you\ncome to know it?",
        "MISS CAREY:  I’m an old maid, and old maids know more about men\nthan anyone–that’s why they stay old maids.  What were you wearing\nthe first time you met?",
        "HARRY:  (Reminiscently.)  A suit of regimentals.",
        "MISS CAREY:  (Hurrying up to door.)  Quick, go downstairs and put\n’em on and come up as quick as you can.",
        "HARRY:  (Looks at himself in glass near door.)  By George–you’re\nright.  Oh, Miss Carey, I am a lollard.  (He runs off.)",
        "MISS CAREY:  You’re a lollard, all right.  Now young woman–get\nyour things together and get ready to go–young woman, do you hear\nme?  (She goes up to curtains, and opens them–there lies ANGELA\ncozily huddled in a heap, fast asleep.)  Well, if the little fluff\nhasn’t fallen asleep.  Here–wake up–the idea.",

        "RICHARD FALLON, a millionaire mine owner.\n\"LOU” MOHUN, a crook.\nKELLY, a Pinkerton detective.\nMRS. HOWARD:",
        "SCENE",
        "The scene shows the interior of the sitting room of a suite in a\nNew York hotel of the class of the Hotel Astor or Claridge.  In\nthe back wall a door opens into what is the bedroom of the suite.\nThe hinges of this door are on the right, the door knob on the\nleft.  On the wall on either side of the door is hung a framed\ncopy of a picture by Gibson or Christy.  In the left wall, half\nway down, is a door leading to the hall.  Higher up against the\nwall is a writing desk on which are writing materials and a hand\ntelephone.  Above this pinned to the wall is a blue-print map.\nIn front of the desk is a gilt chair without arms.  Above and to\nthe right of the gilt chair is a Morris chair facing the audience.\nIn the seat of the chair is a valise; over the back hangs a man’s\ncoat.",
        "In the right wall are two windows with practical blinds.  Below\nthem against the wall, stretches a leather sofa.  On it is a\nsuitcase, beside it on the floor a pair of men’s boots.  Below the\nsofa and slightly to the left stands a table, sufficiently heavy\nto bear the weight of a man leaning against it.  On this table are\nmagazines, a man’s sombrero, a box of safety matches, a pitcher\nof ice water and a glass, and hanging over the edge of the table,\nin view of the audience, are two blue prints held down by pieces\nof ore.  The light that comes through the two windows is of a sunny\nday in August.",
        "WHEN THE CURTAIN RISES",
        "RICHARD FALLON is discovered at table arranging the specimens of\nore upon the blue prints.  He is a young man of thirty-five, his\nface is deeply tanned, his manner is rough and breezy.  He is\nwithout a coat, and his trousers are held up by a belt.  He is\nsmoking a cigar.",
        "FALLON crosses to Morris chair, opens valise, turns over papers,\nclothing, fails to find that for which he is looking and closes\nthe valise.  He recrosses to suit case which is at lower end of\nthe sofa.  He breaks it open and searches through more papers,\nshirts, coats.  Takes out another blue print, tightly rolled.\nUnrolls it, studies it, and apparently satisfied, with his left\nhand, places it on table.",
        "In attempting to close the suit case the half nearer the audience\nslips over the foot of the sofa, and there falls from it to the floor,\na heavy “bull dog” revolver.  FALLON stares at it, puzzled, as\nthough trying to recall when he placed it in his suit case.  Picks\nit up.  Looks at it.  Throws it carelessly into suit case and shuts\nit.  His manner shows he attaches no importance to the revolver.\nHe now surveys the blue prints and the specimens of ore, as might\na hostess, who is expecting guests, survey her dinner table.  He\ncrosses to hand telephone.",
        "FALLON:  (To ’phone.)  Give me the room clerk, please.  Hello?  This\nis Mr. Fallon.  I’m expecting two gentlemen at five o’clock.  Send\nthem right up.  And, not now, but when they come, send me up a box\nof your best cigars and some rye and seltzer.  Thank you.  (Starts\nto leave telephone, but is recalled.)  What?  A lady?  I don’t know\nany.  I don’t know a soul in New York!  What’s her name?  What–Mrs.\nTom Howard?  For heaven’s sake!  Tell her I’ll be there in one\nsecond!  What?  Why certainly!  Tell her to come right up.  (He rises,\nmuttering joyfully.)  Well, well, well!",
        "(Takes his coat from chair and puts it on.  Lifts valise from chair\nand places it behind writing desk.  Kicks boots under sofa.  Places\ncigar on edge of table in view of audience.  Looks about for mirror\nand finding none, brushes his hair with his hands, and arranges\nhis tie.  Goes to door L. and opens it, expectantly.)",
        "MRS. HOWARD enters.  She is a young woman of thirty.  Her face is\nsweet, sad, innocent.  She is dressed in white–well, but simply.\nNothing about her suggests anything of the fast, or adventuress\ntype.",
        "Well, Helen!  This is fine!  God bless you, this is the best thing\nthat’s come my way since I left Alaska.  And I never saw you looking\nbetter.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  (Taking his hand.)  And, it’s good to see you, Dick.\n(She staggers and sways slightly as though about to faint.)  Can I\nsit down?  (She moves to Morris chair and sits back in it.)",
        "FALLON: (In alarm.)  What is it?  Are you ill?",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  No, I’m–I’m so glad to find you–I was afraid!  I was\nafraid I wouldn’t find you, and I had to see you.  (Leaning\nforward, in great distress.)  I’m in trouble, Dick–terrible trouble.",
        "FALLON:  (Joyfully.)  And you’ve come to me to help you?",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  Yes.",
        "FALLON:  That’s fine!  That’s bully.  I thought, maybe, you’d just\ncome to talk over old times.  (Eagerly.)  And that would have been\nfine, too, understand–but if you’ve come to me because you’re in\ntrouble, then I know you’re still my good friend, my dear old pal.\n(Briskly.)  Now, listen, you say you’re in trouble.  Well, you knew\nme when I was down and out in San Francisco, living on free lunches\nand chop suey.  Now, look at me, Helen, I’m a bloated capitalist.\nI’m a millionaire.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  (Nervously.)  I know, Dick, and I’m so glad!  That’s\nhow I knew you were here, I read about you this morning in the\npapers.",
        "FALLON:  And half they said is true, too.  See those blue prints?\nEach one of them means a gold mine, and at five, I’m to unload\nthem on some of the biggest swells in Wall Street.  (Gently.)  Now,\nall that that means is this:  I don’t know what your trouble is,\nbut, if money can cure it, you haven’t got any trouble.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  Dick, you’re just as generous and kind.  You haven’t\nchanged in any way.",
        "FALLON:  I haven’t changed toward you.  How’s that husband of yours?\n(Jokingly.)  I’d ought to shot that fellow.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  (In distress.)  That’s why I came, Dick.  Oh, Dick–",
        "FALLON:  (Anxiously, incredulously.)  Don’t tell me there’s any\ntrouble between you and Tom?  Why, old Tom he just worships you.\nHe loves you like–",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  That’s it.  And I want to keep his love.",
        "FALLON:  (Laughingly.)  Keep his love?  Is that all you’ve got to\nworry about?  (Throughout the following scene, Mrs. Howard speaks\nin a fateful voice, like a woman beaten and hopeless.)",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  Dick, did you ever guess why I didn’t marry you?",
        "FALLON:  No, I knew.  You didn’t marry me because you didn’t love\nme, and you did love Tom.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  No, I didn’t know Tom then.  And I thought I loved\nyou, until I met Tom.  But I didn’t marry you, because it wouldn’t\nhave been honest–because, three years before I met you, I had\nlived with a man–as his wife.",
        "FALLON:  Helen!  (His tone is one of amazement, but not of reproach.\nIn his astonishment, he picks the cigar from the table, puffs at\nit standing and partly seated on the table.)",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  (In the same dead level, hopeless voice.)  I was\nseventeen years old.  I was a waiter girl at one of Fred Harvey’s\nrestaurants on the Santa Fe.  I was married to this man before a\nmagistrate.  (Fallon lifts his head.)  Three months later, when\nhe’d grown tired of me, he told me the magistrate who had married\nus was not a magistrate but a friend of his, a man named Louis\nMohun, and he brought this man to live with us.  I should have\nleft him then, that was where I did wrong.  That was all I did\nthat was wrong.  But, I couldn’t leave him, I couldn’t, because I\nwas going to be a mother–and in spite of what he had done–I\nbegged him to marry me.",
        "FALLON:  And–he wouldn’t?",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  Maybe he would–but–he was killed.",
        "FALLON:  (Eagerly.)  You?",
        "MRS. HOWARD.  (In horror.)  God, no!",
        "FALLON:  It’s a pity.  That’s what you should have done.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  He was a gambler, one night he cheated–the man he\ncheated, shot him.  Then–my baby–died!  After two years I came\nto San Francisco and met you and Tom.  Then you went to Klondike\nand I married Tom.",
        "FALLON:  And, you told Tom?",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  (Lowering her face.)",
        "FALLON:  Helen!",
        "MRS. HOWARP:  I know, but I was afraid.  I loved him so, and I was\nafraid.",
        "FALLON:  But Tom would have understood.  Why, you thought you were\nmarried.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  I was afraid.  I loved him too much.  I was too happy,\nand I was afraid I’d lose him.  (FALLON shakes his head.)  But, we\nwere leaving San Francisco forever–to live in the East–where I\nthought no one knew me.",
        "FALLON:  Well?",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  Well, one man knew me.  Mohun, the man who played the\nmagistrate.  He came East, too.  Three years ago he saw me one\nnight with Tom in a theatre.  He followed us and found out where\nI lived.  The next morning he came to see me, and threatened to\ntell!  And, I was terrified, I lost my head and gave him money.\n(Slowly.)  And I have been giving him money ever since.",
        "FALLON:  Helen!  You!  Fall for blackmail?  Why, that isn’t you.\nYou’re no coward!  You should have told the swine to go to Hell,\nand as soon as Tom came home, you should have told him the whole\nstory.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  (Fiercely.)  My story, yes!  But not a story Mohun\nthreatens to tell!  In a week he had it all backed up with letters,\ntelegrams, God knows what he didn’t make me out to be–a vile,\ndegraded creature.",
        "FALLON:  And who’d have believed it?",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  Everybody!  He proved it!  And my children.  He threatened\nto stop my children on the way to school and explain to them what\nkind of a woman their mother was.  So, I paid and paid and paid.\nI robbed Tom, I robbed the children.  I cheated them of food, and\nclothes, I’ve seen Tom look almost ashamed of us.  And when I’d\ntaken all I’d dared from Tom, I pretended I wanted to be more\nindependent, and I learned typewriting, and needlework and decorating,\nand I worked at night, and when Tom was at the office–to earn\nmoney–to give to Mohun.  And each time he said it was the last,\nand each time he came back demanding more.  God knows what he does\nwith it, he throws it away–on drink, on women, opium.",
        "FALLON:  Dope fiend, too, hey?",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  He’s that, too; he’s everything that’s vile; inhuman,\npitiless, degenerate.  Sometimes, I wonder why God lets him live.\n(Her voice drops to a whisper.)  Sometimes, I almost pray to God\nto let him die.  (FALLON who already has determined to kill MOHUN,\nreceives this speech with indifference, and continues grimly to\npuff on his cigar.)  He’s killed my happiness, he’s killing me.\nIn keeping him alive, I’ve grown ill and old.  I see the children\ngrowing away from me, I see Tom drawing away from me.  And now,\nafter all my struggles, after all my torture, Tom must be told.\nMohun is in some new trouble.  He must have a thousand dollars!\nI can no more give him a thousand dollars than I can give him New\nYork City.  But, if I don’t, he’ll tell! What am I to do?",
        "FALLON:  (Unmoved.)  When did you see this–this thing last?",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  This morning.  He’d read about you in the papers.\nHe knows I knew you in San Francisco.  He said you’d “struck it\nrich,” and that you’d give me the money.  (Rises, and comes to him.)\nBut, get this straight, Dick.  I didn’t come here for money.  I\ndon’t want money.  I won’t take money.  I came to you because you\nare my best friend, and Tom’s best friend, and because I need a\nman’s brain, a man’s advice.",
        "FALLON:  (Contemptuously.)  Advice!  Hell!  Am I the sort of man that\ngives girls–advice? (With rough tenderness.)  Now, you go home\nto Tom, and tell him I’m coming to dinner.  (Impressively.)  And\nleave this leech to me.  And, don’t worry.  This thing never\nhappened, it’s just a bad dream, a nightmare.  Just throw it from\nyour shoulders like a miner drops his pack.  It’s never coming\nback into your life again.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  (Earnestly.)  No!  I won’t let you pay that man!  He’d\nhound you, as he’s hounded me!",
        "FALLON:  (Indignantly.)  Pay him?  Me?  I haven’t got enough money\nto pay him!",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  What!",
        "FALLON:  No man on earth has money enough to pay blackmail.\nHelen, this is what I think of a blackmailer:  The lowest thing\nthat crawls, is a man that sends a woman into the streets to earn\nmoney for him.  Here, in New York, you call them “cadets.”  Now,\nthere’s only one thing on earth lower than a cadet, and that’s the\nblackmailer, the man who gets money from a woman–by threatening\nher good name–who uses her past as a club–who drags out some\nunhappy act of hers for which she’s repented, in tears, on her\nknees, which the world has forgotten, which God has forgiven.\nAnd, for that past sin, that’s forgotten and forgiven, this\nblackguard crucifies her.  And the woman–to protect her husband\nand her children, as you have done–to protect her own good name,\nthat she’s worked for and won, starves herself to feed that leech.\nAnd, you ask me, if I’m going to feed him, too!  Not me!  Helen,\ndown in lower California, there are black bats, the Mexican calls\n\"Vampire” bats.  They come at night and fasten on the sides of\nthe horses and drink their blood.  And, in the morning when you\ncome to saddle up, you’ll find the horses too weak to walk, and\nhanging to their flanks these vampires, swollen and bloated and\ndrunk with blood.  Now, I’ve just as much sympathy for Mr. Mohun,\nas I have for those vampires, and, I’m going to treat him just as\nI treat them!  Where is he?",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  Downstairs.  In the cafe.",
        "FALLON:  Here, in this hotel?",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  Yes.",
        "FALLON:  (Half to himself.)  Good!",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  He said he’d wait until I telephoned him that you\nwould pay.  If you won’t, he’s going straight to Tom.",
        "FALLON:  He is, is he?  Helen, I hate to have you speak to him\nagain, but, unless he hears your voice, he won’t come upstairs.\n(Motions towards telephone.)  Tell him I’ll see him in ten minutes.\nTell him I’ve agreed to make it all right.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  But, how, Dick, how?",
        "FALLON:  Don’t you worry about that.  I’m going to send him away.\nOut of the country.  He won’t trouble you any more.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  But he won’t go.  He’s promised me to go many times–",
        "FALLON:  Yes, but he’s not dealing with a woman, now, he’s dealing\nwith a man, with boots on.  Do as I tell you.",
        "(MRS. HOWARD sits at writing desk and takes receiver off telephone.\nFALLON leans against table right, puffing quickly on his cigar,\nand glancing impatiently at the valise that holds his revolver.)",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  Give me the cafe, please.  Is this the cafe?  I want\nto speak to a Mr. Mohun, he is waiting to be called up–oh, thank\nyou.  (To FALLON.)  He’s coming.  (To ’phone.)  I have seen that man\nand he says he’ll take up that debt, and pay it.  Yes, now, at\nonce.  You’re to wait for ten minutes, until he can get the\nmoney, and then, he’ll telephone you to come up.  I don’t know,\nI’ll ask.  (To Fallon.)  He says it must be in cash.",
        "FALLON:  (Sarcastically.)  Why, certainly!  That’ll be all right.\n(MRS. HOWARD Places her hand over the mouth piece.)",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  I’ll not let you pay him!",
        "FALLON:  I’m not going to!  I’m going to give him just what’s coming\nto him.  Tell him, it’ll be all right.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  (To ’phone.)  He says to tell you, it’ll be all right.\nThe room is 210 on the third floor.  In ten minutes, yes.  (She\nrises.)",
        "FALLON:  Now, then, you go back to Tom and get dinner ready.  Don’t\nforget I’m coming to dinner.  And the children must come to\ndinner, too.  We’ll have a happy, good old-time reunion.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  (With hand on door knob of door left.)  Dick, how can\nI thank you?",
        "FALLON:  Don’t let me catch you trying.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  God bless you, Dick.  (With a sudden hope.)  And you\nreally believe you can make him go?",
        "FALLON:  Don’t worry!  I’m sure of it.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  And, you think he won’t come back?",
        "FALLON:  (After a pause, gravely.)  I know he won’t come back.",
        "MRS. HOWARD:  God bless you, Dick!",
        "FALLON:  See you at dinner.",
        "(MRS. HOWARD exits.  FALLON stands considering, and chewing on his\ncigar.  Then, he crosses room briskly and lowers the blind at each\nwindow.  Opens valise and examines revolver.  Places the revolver\nin his left hip pocket.  Then, in a matter-of-course manner from\nhis right hand pocket, he draws his automatic pistol.  This, as\nthough assured he would find loaded, he examines in a quick,\nperfunctory way, and replaces.  He crosses left to desk, and taking\nfrom it a cheque book, writes out a cheque, which he tears from\nthe book, and holds in his right hand.  With left hand he removes\nthe receiver from the telephone.)",
        "Give me Murray Hill 2828.  Hello, is this the Corn and Grain Bank?\nI want to speak to the cashier.  Hello, is that the cashier?  This\nis Richard Fallon, of San Francisco, speaking from the Hotel\nWisteria.  I opened an account with you day before yesterday, for\ntwo hundred thousand dollars.  Yes, this is Mr. Fallon speaking.\nI made out a cheque yesterday payable to Louis Mohun (Glances at\ncheque.), dated August 4th, for two thousand dollars.  I want to\nknow if he’s cashed it in yet?  He hasn’t, hey?  Good!  (He continues\nto look at cheque, to impress upon audience, that the cheque they\nhave just seen him write, is the one which he is speaking about.)\nWell, I want to stop payment on that cheque.  Yes, yes.  I made\nit out under pressure, and I’ve decided not to stand for it.  Yes,\nsort of a hold up!  I guess that’s why he was afraid to cash it.\nYou’ll attend to that, will you?  Thank you.  Good-bye.  (He takes\nan envelope from desk, places cheque in it and puts envelope in\nhis breast pocket.  Again takes off receiver.)  Hello, give me the\ncashier, please.  Am I speaking to the cashier of the hotel?  This\nis Mr. Fallon in room 210.  Is your hotel detective in the lobby?\nHe is?  Good!  What–what sort of a man is he, is he a man I can\nrely on?  A Pinkerton, hey?  That’s good enough!  Well, I wish you’d\ngive him a thousand dollars for me in hundreds.  Ten hundred-dollar\nbills, and before you send them up, I wish you’d mark them and\ntake their numbers.  What?  No, there’s no trouble.  I just want\nto see that the right bills go to the right people, that’s all.\nThank you.",
        "(He crosses to door centre, and taking key from the bedroom side,\nplaces it in keyhole on side of door in view of the audience.  He\nturns the key several times.  He takes the revolver from his left\nhip pocket and holding it in his right hand, rehearses shooting\nunder his left arm through his coat which he holds from him by the\nfingers of his left hand.  Shifting revolver to his left hand, he\ntakes the automatic from his right hip pocket, and goes through\nthe motions of firing with both guns in opposite directions.  His\npantomine must show he intends making use of both guns at the same\ntime, using one apparently upon himself, and the other, in earnest,\nupon another person.

        "FALLON:  Yes, I know.  I’ve seen you in the lobby.",
        "KELLY:  Mr. Parmelee said I was to give you this.  (Gives envelope\nto FALLON.  FALLON takes out ten yellow-back bills.)  There ought\nto be a thousand dollars there in hundreds.",
        "FALLON:  That’s right.  Now, will you just sit over there, and as\nI read the numbers, you write them down.",
        "KELLY:  Mr. Parmelee made a note of the numbers, Mr. Fallon.",
        "FALLON:  I know.  I want you to identify them too.",
        "KELLY:  I can do that.  I saw him mark them.",
        "FALLON:  Good.  And if you saw these bills in the next five minutes\nyou’d be able to swear they’re the same bills you gave me?",
        "KELLY:  Sure.  (Starts towards door.)",
        "FALLON:  Wait a minute.  Sit down, Kelly.  (KELLY seats himself in\nMorris chair, holding his hat between his knees.)  Kelly, this hotel\nengages you from the Pinkertons to stay around the place, and–protect\nthe guests?",
        "KELLY:  Yes, sir.",
        "FALLON:  Well, there’s a man downstairs thinks he has a claim on\nthis money.  Now, I’d like you to wait in that bedroom and listen\nto what he says with a view to putting him in jail.",

        "KELLY:  (Excitedly.)  Where?  Not in this hotel?",
        "FALLON:  Yes, in this room.  I gave him a cheque for two thousand\ndollars.  That made him think I was easy, and he telephoned this\nmorning that he’s coming back for another thousand, and he wants\nit in cash.  That’s why I marked those bills.",
        "KELLY:  Why, we got him now!  He’s as good as dead.",
        "FALLON:  (Startled.)  What?",
        "KELLY:  I say, we’ve got him nailed now.",
        "FALLON:  Oh, yes.  (Pause.)  He hasn’t turned in the cheque yet–I’ve\njust called up the bank to find out.  I guess he means to hold\nthat over my head, hey?",
        "KELLY:  More likely he’s afraid of it.  (Eagerly.)  We may get\nthat back, too.  We may find it on him.",

        "KELLY:  (Eagerly.)  And as soon as he gets those bills in his clothes,\nyou give me the high sign (Fiercely.)–and we’ll nail him!",
        "FALLON:  Yes, we’ll nail him.  And, if he puts his gun in my face\ntoday, he won’t catch me empty-handed the second time.  (Draws\nautomatic from his pocket.)  I’m ready for him, today!",
        "KELLY:  (Greatly concerned.)  Here, none of that stuff, Mr. Fallon.\nA gentleman like you can’t take that chance.",
        "FALLON:  Chance?  Kelly, I haven’t always lived in a swell hotel.\nThe man that gets the drop on me–when I’ve got a gun–has got\nto be damned quick.",

        "KELLY:  You don’t want to go to jail for a rat like that.",
        "FALLON:  I don’t mean to go to jail, and, I don’t mean to die,\neither.  For the last six years I’ve been living on melted ice and\nbacon.  Now, I’m worth seven million dollars.

        "KELLY:  Yes, but you’ll get excited and–",
        "FALLON:  (Quietly.)  I?  Excited?  I never get excited.  The last\ntime I was excited was when I was seven years old, and the circus\ncame to town.",
        "KELLY:  Don’t mix up in this.  What am I here for?",

        "MOHUN:  Yes.  (MOHUN stands warily at the door.  Glances cautiously\naround the room.  Bends over quite openly to look under the sofa.\nFor some seconds his eyes rest with a smile on bedroom door.  He\nspeaks slowly, unemotionally.)  A mutual friend of ours said you\nwanted to see me.",
        "FALLON:  (Sharply.)  We’ve no mutual friend.  No one’s in this but\nyou and me.  You want to get that straight!",
        "MOHUN:  (Easily.)  All right.  That’s all right.  Well, what do you\nwant to see me about?",
        "(FALLON speaks in a loud voice.  In the speeches that follow, it\nmust be apparent that his loud tone and excited manner is assumed,\nand is intended only to convince KELLY.)",
        "FALLON:  I understand, you think you have a claim on me for a\nthousand dollars.  And, I’m going to give it to you.  But, first,\nI want a plain talk with you.  (Sharply.)  Are you listening to me?",
        "MOHUN:  No, not yet.  Before there’s any plain talking, I want to\nknow where that door leads to.",
        "FALLON:  What door?  That?  (In a louder voice.)  That’s my bedroom. \nIt’s empty.  Is that what you want?  Think I got someone in there?\nDo you want to look for yourself?  (Opens door.)  Go on in, and look.\n(MOHUN takes a step forward, and peers past FALLON into bedroom.)\nGo on, search it. Look under the bed.",
        "MOHUN:  I guess that’s all right.",
        "FALLON:  Don’t you want to look?",
        "MOHUN:  (Falling back to door left.)  Not now.  No need to, if you’re\nwilling to let me.  (Impatiently.)  Go on.  What is it you want with\nme?  (FALLON closes door with a slam.  Comes down to table.)",
        "FALLON:  What do I want?  I want you to understand that this is the\nlast time you come to me for money.",
        "MOHUN:  (Indifferently.)  That’s all right.",
        "FALLON:  No, its not all right.  (Takes out bills.)  Before I give\nyou this, you’ve got to promise me to keep silent.  I’ll stand for\nno more blackmail.",
        "MOHUN:  Don’t talk so loud.  I’m not deaf.  Look here, Mr. Fallon,\nI didn’t come here to be shouted at, I came here to get the money\nyou promised me.",
        "FALLON:  Well, here it is.  (Gives him bills.  MOHUN sticks them in\nhis right-hand vest pocket.)  No, you listen to me.  (As soon as he\nobtains the money, MOHUN’S manner changes.  He is amused, and\ninsolent.)",
        "MOHUN:  No, not a bit like it.  Now that I’ve got this, you’ll\nhave to listen to me.  (Moves deliberately to Morris chair and seats\nhimself) Mr. Fallon, I don’t like your tone.",
        "FALLON:  (Slowly.)  You–don’t–like my tone?  I don’t think I\nunderstand you.",
        "MOHUN:  You talk like you had a whip over me.  You don’t seem to see\nthat I got you dead to rights.",
        "FALLON:  (In pretended alarm.)  Have you?",
        "MOHUN:  Have I?  I got a mortgage on you for life.  You got in wrong\nwhen you gave me that money.  Don’t you see that?  Mr. Fallon,\nI’ve been taking out information about you.  Some ’Frisco lads\ntell me you used to be pretty sweet on a certain party, but she\nchucked you and married the other fellow.  But the first day you\ncome back a millionaire she visits your rooms–and you give her a\nthousand dollars!  Why?  She can’t tell.  You can’t tell.  But I\ncan tell.  I can tell her husband.  He’s only got to ask the\nhotel clerk and the cashier and the bell hops, and when I’ve told\nmy story as I’ll tell it–he’s liable to shoot you.  (There is a\npause during which FALLON stares at MOHUN incredulously.)  Let it\nsink in, Mr. Fallon.",
        "FALLON:  (Quietly.)  I am–letting it sink in.",
        "MOHUN:  Now, a thousand dollars is all well enough from a lady that\nhas to scrape to find it, but a thousand dollars from a millionaire\nlike you is a joke.  And unless you want me to go to the husband,\nyou’ll come across with fifty thousand dollars, and until I get\nit, I’m not going to leave this room.",
        "FALLON:  (Solemnly.)  Then, I don’t believe you are going to leave\nthis room.",
        "MOHUN:  (Impudently.)  Oh, I’ll go when I’m ready.",
        "FALLON:  (Going up close to centre door.)  Let me understand you.\nYou are going to this husband with a lie that will wreck his faith\nin his wife, that will wreck his faith in his best friend, unless\nI give you a thousand dollars?",
        "MOHUN:  No!  Fifty thousand dollars!",
        "FALLON:  Fifty thousand.  It’s the same thing.  But, you’d keep\nquiet for ten dollars, wouldn’t you, if that was all I had?",
        "MOHUN:  (Grinning at him.)  If that was all you had.",
        "FALLON:  (In a whisper, slowly, impressively.)  Then, Mr. Mohun (He\nraises his right arm.), may–God–have mercy–on your soul.  (In\nloud, excited tones and purposely, so that MOHUN can see him, he\nturns his face towards the centre door.)  I won’t pay that fifty\nthousand.  I won’t stand for blackmail, you’re robbing–(MOHUN\nleaps to his feet, and points at centre door.)",
        "MOHUN:  (Fiercely.)  Here.  What are you doing?  You’re trying to\ntrap me?  There is someone in that room.  (FALLON laughs mockingly\nat MOHUN, but speaks for KELLY to hear.)",
        "FALLON:  Don’t go near that room.  (With his left hand he quickly\nturns the key in the door.)  Don’t lock that door!  Don’t lock that\ndoor!  Kelly, he’s locked the door.  (He draws the revolver from his\nleft pocket.  KELLY is heard shaking the handle of the door, and\nbeating upon the panel.  FALLON speaks in a whisper.)  I told you,\nyou’d never leave this room, Mr. Mohun.  (In a loud, excited tone.)\nDrop that gun.  Drop that gun.  Don’t point that gun at me!  (Still\nsmiling mockingly at MOHUN, FALLON shoots twice through his own\ncoat on the left side, throws the gun at MOHUN’S feet, and drawing\nhis automatic pistol, shoves it against MOHUN’S stomach and fires.\nMOHUN falls back into the Morris chair dead.) (Shouts loudly.)\nBreak in the door.  Break in the door.  (From his pocket he takes\nthe envelope containing the cheque, and sticks it into the inside\npocket of MOHUN’S coat.  Then turns to table, right, as KELLY\nbursts open the door and sees MOHUN.)",
        "KELLY:  My God, Mr. Fallon.  I told you to give me that gun!",
        "FALLON:  Have I hurt him?",
        "KELLY:  (Bending over body.)  Hurt him?  You’ve killed him!  (FALLON\nwith his face turned from KELLY, smiles.  He speaks with pretended\nemotion.)  Killed him?  Here, you’re an officer.  (Throws gun on\ntable.)  I give myself up.  (KELLY runs to hand telephone.  FALLON\npicks up his cigar from the table and a box of matches.  Starts\nto light cigar, but seeing KELLY at ’phone hesitates and listens\neagerly.)",
        "KELLY:  (To ’phone.)  Send the hotel doctor here.  Quick!  Mr. Fallon’s\nwounded.  (To FALLON.)  Are you badly hurt?  (FALLON places his left\nhand on his left hip under the coat and removes it showing the\nfingers covered with blood.)",
        "FALLON:  Only scratched.",
        "KELLY:  (To ’phone.)  Some crank tried to shoot him up.  Mr. Fallon\nfired back and killed him.  (Pause.) No!  Mr. Fallon killed him!\n(Pause.)  Of course, in self-defense, you fool, of course, in\nself-defense!  (KELLY slams back the receiver, and rising quickly,\nturns to the right and stands with hands on his hips, and back to\naudience, gazing down at MOHUN.  He does not once look at FALLON.)",

He was only a harness cop then, and one night he thought\nhe made me coppin’ a super from a lush, which you know ain’t my\ngraft.  He started to fan me with a sap, so I just clubbed my smoke\nwagon, and before I got through with him, I made him a pick-up for\nthe ambulance, and he ain’t never forgot it.",

        "EEL:  (Taking time, looks around.)  You don’t think I’m goin’ to\naddress this Mass Meeting here.  (BROOKY looks L. to see if there\nis anyone else there.)",
        "INSPECTOR:  You’re not afraid to talk in front of a couple of\nnewspaper reporters, are you?",
        "EEL:  (Grinning at INSPECTOR to gain time.)  Roosevelt gets a dollar\na word, where do I come in?  (Resignedly.)  All right, flag the\npencil pushers and I’ll gab my nob.  (DUGAN turns L. to tell the\nREPORTERS to go.  BROOKY says he don’t understand.  PERKINS pulls\nhim off door C., remonstrating, going R.) (The INSPECTOR signs to\nDUGAN that they will now grill the EEL.)",
        "INSPECTOR:  This lady I suppose you know.",
        "EEL:  (Looks at MRS. WORTHINGTON.)  I never lamped her before in my\nlife.",
        "DUGAN:  That is Mrs. Worthington, the lady you robbed.",
        "EEL:  (Banteringly to MRS. WORTHINGTON to gain time.)  Is it?  How\ndo you do, pleased to meet you.  Gee! but you must be an awful\nmark to be robbed.  (INSPECTOR raps on desk.)  What was it I stole\nfrom you, Mrs. Worthington?",
        "DUGAN:  Nix on that bull.  You know what you stole.",
        "EEL:  Yes, and I suppose you know what I stole before I stole it.",
        "DUGAN:  With dips like you, I always look far ahead.",
        "EEL:  Get out! you couldn’t look far enough ahead to see the ashes\non your cigar.  Why, if it wasn’t for your stool pigeons–",
        "DUGAN:  That’s enough out of you.",
        "EEL:  Oh, go chase yourself.  (DUGAN smashes at EEL, who ducks around\nback of him.)",
        "INSPECTOR:  Dugan!!!  (When Dugan locates the EEL, he goes after him\nagain.  MRS. WORTHINGTON screams.)",
        "INSPECTOR:  None of that, Dugan!  Remember, he had no marks on him\nwhen you brought him in.  (DUGAN crosses L. in front of EEL and\nlooks off door L.  in subdued rage.)  A little more civility out\nof you, Bradley.",
        "EEL:  All right, Inspector.  (To MRS. W.)  I beg your pardon, lady.",
        "INSPECTOR:  You have been brought here as a suspect in a five\nthousand dollar jewelry theft which happened at the home of Mrs.\nWorthington last night.  (EEL makes no move.)  Circumstances point\nstrongly in your direction.  Your former sweetheart, Goldie Marshall,\nwas serving as maid to Mrs. Worthington at the time of the robbery.",
        "EEL:  And you think I planted her there as a stall.",
        "DUGAN:  Goldie spilled that much, and we didn’t, have to third\ndegree her.",
        "EEL:  So Goldie declared me in on this?",
        "INSPECTOR:  She couldn’t help it, we knew it was a two-man’s job.",
        "EEL:  She snitched me into a frame-up.",
        "DUGAN:  Same as she did two years ago.",
        "EEL:  Why say, Inspector, I ain’t seen Goldie since I was sprung\nfrom the Pen.",
        "DUGAN:  Is that so?  I got it straight that the first place you\nmozied to was Goldie’s flat on East Broadway.  You were trailed.",
        "EEL:  Sure I was, by one of you pathfinders at the Central Office.\nOh, I’ve played tag with you before; Dugan, whatever you say, is.",
        "INSPECTOR:  Then you admit–",
        "EEL:  I don’t admit nothin’.",
        "INSPECTOR:  Be careful what you say.  Have you retained counsel?",
        "EEL:  A mouthpiece!  What for?",
        "INSPECTOR:  You’ve got to be represented.  Have you any money?",
        "EEL:  Sure!  I left the hotel of Zebra clothed with a pocket full\nof smiles and a wad of joy.  (INSPECTOR whispers for O’MARA to bring\nup GOLDIE.  O’MARA exits door L.)",
        "INSPECTOR:  Well, the state will furnish you with an attorney.",
        "EEL:  What, one of them record shysters?  Eighty years old and never\nwon a case.  No, thanks, Inspector.  I’ll plead my own case; then\nI got at least a chance to beat this rap.",
        "DUGAN:  You’d have a swell time pleading your own case.",
        "EEL:  Yes, and believe me I’ll spring a sensation when I open up.\nI’ll show up some of this rotten graft.  I’ll bust “The System “\nto smithereens.  Dugan, I won’t be railroaded–(EEL crosses in\nrage L. to Dugan.)",
        "INSPECTOR:  Bradley! hold your tongue, you’ve said enough.",
        "EEL:  I ain’t said half what I’m going to say–",
        "INSPECTOR:  (Fiercely.)  Not another word out of you.  Do you\nunderstand?",
        "EEL:  (Coming down.)  All right, Inspector.  I don’t want to get\nanybody that’s right, in bad, but I’ve got something up my sleeve.\n(DUGAN laughs and goes up stage.) (GOLDIE enters door L. brought\nin by O’MARA.  She is startled at seeing EEL, then pleadingly:)",
        "GOLDIE:  Billy!  (EEL turns and is about to go to GOLDIE but stops.)",
        "EEL:  You snitched again!  You snitched again!  (Running L. to GOLDIE\nwith arms up as though to hit her with hand-cuffs.  GOLDIE snatches\nhis upraised arms.)",
        "GOLDIE:  Oh no, Billy!  True as God I didn’t!",
        "DUGAN:  (Aside to INSPECTOR.)  Let’s leave them alone, they’ll talk.\n(MRS. WORTHINGTON, INSPECTOR, DUGAN and O’MARA exit door R.)",
        "GOLDIE:  (Still holding EEL’S arms.)  Why, I’d rather die than snitch.",
        "EEL:  (Jerking away and going R.)  How about two years ago?",
        "GOLDIE:  I didn’t even then when you left me dying.  They framed\nyou while I was in the hospital.",
        "EEL:  Who?",
        "GOLDIE:  Dugan and his–",
        "EEL:  Sh!!!  Oh if I could only believe you, kid.",
        "GOLDIE:  Look at me, Billy.  Do you think I’d snitch?",
        "EEL:  (Looks at her, then pushes her head roughly back.) No, I can’t\nbelieve you did it, kid.  (EEL takes GOLDIE in his arms.)",
        "GOLDIE:  (Sobbingly.)  I’m so glad to see you again.",
        "EEL:  Me, too, kid.  Gee, your head feels as natural on my shoulder\nas a piece of pie on a prize-fighter’s knife.  (EEL takes GOLDIE\nfrom his shoulder and says inquiringly.)  But what are you doing\nhere?",
        "GOLDIE:  (Drying her tears.)  Bein’ held on suspicion, but they can’t\nget met I’m protected.  Dugan’s got to–",
        "EEL:  Nix on the crackin’, don’t shoot your trap, they’re leavin’\nus together for a stall.  Talk about something else.  (EEL turns\nR. and GOLDIE grabs his hand.)  Do you still love me?",
        "GOLDIE:  Always.",
        "EEL:  Will you marry me?",
        "GOLDIE:  If you want me to.",
        "EEL:  You know I do.  (Looks around suspiciously.)  Say, if I beat\nthis rap (DUGAN comes, on door R., and stands at upper end of\ndesk), let’s get spliced and go out West, turn over a new leaf,\nand begin life all over again, far away from the subway world where\nthe sun of happiness is always clouded and the ace of joy is\ncoppered.  What do you say?",
        "GOLDIE:  Gee! them’s the kindest words you’ve ever said to me.  (Then\nlightly.)  And I’ll march down the aisle with you, with my hair in\na braid.",
        "EEL:  Great!!  Gee, I wonder if we could make our get-away now.  (Both\nstart for door C., but DUGAN, who has come down behind them, stops\nthem.)",
        "DUGAN:  How do you do!  Would you like to take a little trip out in\nthe air with me?",
        "GOLDIE:  Say, I’d rather be home with the headache, than at the\nMovies with a guy like you.  (Crosses L.) (INSPECTOR enters door\nR. going behind desk.)",
        "INSPECTOR:  Well, have you got anything to say to me before I lock\nyou up for the night?",
        "EEL:  Nothin’, except that it’s a frame-up, and we defy you to go\nthrough with it.",
        "INSPECTOR:  Take ’em down.",
        "DUGAN:  (Above door L.)  Come on.  (EEL starts for door L.)",

        "INSPECTOR:  Good-night, Bradley.  (DUGAN shoves the EEL roughly off.\nGOLDIE circles around and switches in front of DUGAN.)  By the way,\nGoldie, what’s the number of your flat on East Broadway?",
        "GOLDIE:  (Hesitatingly at door L.) 327, Inspector.",
        "INSPECTOR:  Thanks.",
        "GOLDIE:  (Impudently.)  You’re welcome.  (Exit door L. followed by\nDUGAN.) (O’MARA locks door after them.)",
        "INSPECTOR:  (Calling O’MARA.)  O’Mara!",
        "O’MARA:  (At door L.)  Yes, sir.",
        "INSPECTOR:  I want a wire installed at 327 East Broadway.",
        "O’MARA:  (In front of desk.)  Goldie’s flat?",
        "INSPECTOR:  Yes.  I’m leaving it to you to see that the orders are\ncarried out to the letter.",
        "O’MARA:  Yes, sir, to-morrow.",
        "INSPECTOR:  To-night, at once.  I’m going to turn them loose.  You\nunderstand?",

        "PERKINS:  (Entering R. briskly.)  Come on, Brooky, don’t be so slow.",
        "BROOKY:  (Straggling in after PERKINS.)  I say, old chap, this sort\nof work is most laborious.  This flitting from one tram to another,\nand being jostled and ordered to “step lively” by vulgar guards,\nand running, yes actually running.  It’s not only bad taste, old\nman, but positively undignified.  (Dusting shoes with handkerchief,\nL., PERKINS is up in vestibule of door C.)",
        "PERKINS:  If you want to supply your paper with live news, you’ve\ngot to keep hustling.",
        "BROOKY:  Very true, but it seems such a waste of energy.",
        "PERKINS:  (Coming down to BROOKY.)  No energy is wasted that is\nproductive of flaring headlines.  Now take that note pad I gave\nyou, and get your pencil busy with a description of this neighborhood.\n(Goes R. making notes.)",
        "BROOKY:  (Taking paper and pencil from pockets after a search for\nthem.)  This is more like being a Scotland Yarder than a reporter.",
        "PERKINS:  A Scotland Yarder!",
        "BROOKY:  I should say detective.",
        "PERKINS:  (Coming L.)  Let me tell you something, Brooky.  The\nreporters and newspapers unravel more cases than the police.",
        "BROOKY:  I dare say you do.  You’re so damned inquisitive.",
        "PERKINS:  It isn’t inquisitiveness, my boy, it’s just being on the\nlevel with the public.",
        "BROOKY:  (Laughing.)  You know, some great man said, “The public be\ndamned.”",
        "PERKINS:  He wasn’t a great man, he was an ignorant man.  The public\nwill stand for just so much, then look out; let your mind wander\nback to the history of the French Revolution.  An infuriated public\nis the most ferocious blood-lapping animal in the earth’s jungle.",
        "BROOKY:  Perky, I adore your descriptive talents.",
        "PERKINS:  (Going up into vestibule and ringing bell.)  You make me\nsick.",
        "BROOKY:  But surely you’re not going to enter that apartment house\nunannounced?",
        "PERKINS:  No, I’ll tell them a couple of reporters want some news,\nthen you’ll hear language no paper can print.",
        "BROOKY:  Why, are they all foreigners?",
        "PERKINS:  Say, Brooky, you’re a perfect ass.",
        "BROOKY:  No, my dear fellow, none of us are perfect.",
        "PERKINS:  (Coming down out of vestibule to BROOKY.)  Now listen, I\ntold you that I had inside information that the EEL and GOLDIE\nwere to be released, that’s why I hustled you over here.  I could\nhave come alone, but I let you in on a big scoop for your paper.",
        "BROOKY:  Righto, old chap, righto; but what bothers me is, what’s\nit all about?",
        "PERKINS:  It’s about time you got next to yourself.",
        "BROOKY:  Another impossible metaphor, my dear fellow; how can one\nget next to one’s self without being twins?",
        "PERKINS:  Brooky, Englishmen as a rule are thick, but you are a\ndensity of thickness that is impenetrable.",
        "BROOKY:  Yes, I know I am a rare sort.",
        "PERKINS:  Now, we haven’t time to argue a lot of piffle.  The girl\nisn’t in yet, there’s no answer to my ring, so let’s stroll around\nand come back later.  (Exit R.)",

Perkins! you said stroll.\nDon’t run, don’t run, it’s so damned undignified.  (Exit R.) (Enter\nL., O’MARA dressed in citizen’s clothes.

        "FLYNN:  Hello, Maggie! been out to get the evening paper?  There\nis not much in it.",
        "MAGGIE:  There’s enough in it to quench me thirst after a hard day’s\nwork.",

        "MAGGIE:  I have that, and it’s meself instead of the paper’ll be\nwrapped around it in a minute.  (Light goes up in window above.)",
        "FLYNN:  I see you’ve got a new tenant.  Is she hard on you?",
        "MAGGIE:  Divel-a-bit!  She’s a nice respectable dacent girl, and\naisy to get along with.  I never seen her with no men folks.  Maybe\nshe’s a widdy, as I’d like to be.",

        "MAGGIE:  He ain’t done a tap since the civil war.",
        "FLYNN:  That’s quite a vacation.",

        "GOLDIE:  What do you mean?",
        "EEL:  Gee, Goldie, I hate to go back to the old life.  (Sits on\nsofa L.)",
        "GOLDIE:  Old life?  I thought you said we was goin’ to begin all\nover again, and live like decent, respectable people?",
        "EEL:  I know, but you’ve got to have money to be respectable.",
        "GOLDIE:  Well, we’ll get the money.",
        "EEL:  That’s what I hate about it.  Having to get it that way.",
        "GOLDIE:  But Billy, I mean honestly, work for it.",
        "EEL:  (Rising and coming R.)  Yes, but supposing we can’t get work?\nAnd supposing we can’t hold it after we do get it?",
        "GOLDIE:  If they go digging into our past, it’ll be tough rowing.\nBut there (caressing EEL.), don’t let’s worry till we come to the\nbridge.  Wait until we get to Chicago.  (Goes into bedroom and takes\ndown coat which is hanging on door C.)",
        "EEL:  (Lies on couch L.)  Have you got enough cale to carry us over\nthere?",
        "GOLDIE:  (Brushing off coat at door C.)  What?",
        "EEL:  I say, have you got enough money to hold us till we get to\nChi?",
        "GOLDIE:  (C. looking in surprise.)  Why no, Billy, I ain’t got no\nmoney.",
        "EEL:  (Surprised, slowly rising from couch to sitting position.)\nWhat?",
        "GOLDIE:  I ain’t got a cent.  I thought you had the sugar.",
        "EEL:  Me?",
        "GOLDIE:  AIN’T you got no money neither?",
        "EEL:  (Throwing away cigarette and going R.)  I ain’t got enough\nmoney to buy the controlling interest in a rotten egg.  (Goldie\nthrows coat on couch.)  How about that necklace?",
        "GOLDIE:  Why, Dugan’s got it.",
        "EEL:  Well, how about your share?",
        "GOLDIE:  Well, he promised I was going to get five hundred out of\nit, but now that you’re sprung, I suppose I’ll have to whistle for\nit.",
        "EEL:  Well, I see where I have to get to work before we get to\nChicago.",
        "GOLDIE:  (Turning him around quickly.)  What do you mean?",
        "EEL:  Well, we’ve got to get to Chi, and as the railroads are very\nparticular, somebody’ll have to pay our fares.  I won’t be long.\n(Crosses L. in front of GOLDIE and gets hat and coat off of sofa.\nGOLDIE runs to door R., then as EEL turns:)",
        "GOLDIE:  Oh no, no, don’t, please don’t. We’re going to be good,\nyou said so yourself.  We’re going to travel the straight road.",
        "EEL:  (C. with hat and coat in hand.)  But that road won’t take us\nto Chi.  (Pause.)  You see, there’s no other way out of it.  (Starts\ntoward door but GOLDIE stops him pleadingly.)",
        "GOLDIE:  Oh no, you musn’t, you shan’t. I won’t go with you if you\ndo.  I won’t go!  I won’t go!  (Becomes hysterical, pounds on door,\nthen begins to cry.)",
        "EEL:  (Putting arm around her.)  There, there, don’t cry.  Look!  (He\nturns her around and then puts his hat and coat in chair above\ndoor R.) (GOLDIE takes his hands in relief The EEL pats her cheek.)\nYou see, I’ll do as you say.  (Crossing down C.)  I’ll cut it out.",
        "GOLDIE:  (Following the EEL and putting her arms around him.)  I\nknew you would.",
        "EEL:  Oh, you did?  Well, what’s the next move?",
        "GOLDIE:  I don’t know, Billy.",
        "EEL:  There you are.  (Crosses L.)  We’re no better off than we were\nbefore.  By Monday, Dugan’ll have me back in the Tombs, maybe on\na charge of murder.  You know that he ain’t going to rest while\nI’m loose.",
        "GOLDIE:  Then why not let me end it all?",
        "EEL:  Not by squealing.",
        "GOLDIE:  It will be that sooner or later.",
        "EEL:  (Coming R. slowly.)  No, the best way is to let me go out and\nget some money.  (Crossing GOLDIE and going toward hat and coat on\nchair R.)",
        "GOLDIE:  (Stopping him.)  But, Billy, you promised me–",
        "EEL:  (Turning to GOLDIE.)  I don’t mean to rob anybody (Scratches\nhead in puzzled way, then brightly, as thought strikes him), I\nmean to borrow it.",
        "GOLDIE:  (Joyfully.)  Borrow it?",
        "EEL:  Yes, I’ll knock a guy down, strip him of his leather, get his\nname and address, then when we get to Chicago, I’ll send it back\nto him.",
        "GOLDIE:  (Shaking her head and smiling.)  Oh no, it won’t do.",
        "EEL:  Why?",
        "GOLDIE:  You might forget his address.  (Going up C. into bedroom.)\nNow, you come and help me pack the trunk.  (Stopping.)  Oh Billy,\ncome help me pull this trunk in there.  (Disappearing to R. of\ntrunk.  EEL comes and takes L. end and they carry it into living\nroom and place it C. under chandelier to open up stage.  As they\ncarry it down stage she speaks.)  There are a few more things to\ngo in.",
        "EEL:  (As they set trunk down.)  I’ve got it.",
        "GOLDIE:  What?",
        "EEL:  I know where I can get that money.",
        "GoLDffi:  Where?",
        "EEL:  Isaacson.",
        "GOLDIE:  What Isaacson?",
        "EEL:  Why the fence on Second Ave.  I’m aces with him.",
        "GOLDIE:  Yes, but what have you got to pawn?",
        "EEL:  I don’t need nothing.  I’ve thrown thousands of dollars his\nway in business, he’ll lend me a century sure.  I’ll be back in\nfifteen minutes.  (Goes to chair and gets coat and hat, then starts\nfor door R.)",
        "GOLDIE:  Wait!  (Crosses to mantel L. and gets keys from up stage\nend.)  Here, take my keys.  (Coming back to C. above trunk where EEL\nmeets her putting on coat and hat.)  To make sure, we’d better work\non signals.",
        "EEL:  (Taking keys.)  How do you mean?",
        "GOLDIE:  In case anything happens while you’re gone, when you come\nback, ring the bell downstairs three times.  If I don’t answer,\neverything’s O. K., come up; but if I do answer, don’t come up,\nsee?",
        "EEL:  If you don’t answer, everything’s all right, come up; but if\nyou do answer, don’t come up.",
        "GOLDIE:  That’s it.",
        "EEL:  I got you.  (Goes to door R. Opens it quickly to see if anyone\nis there.  Closes door, footsteps are heard in hall, then going\ndownstairs, then door slams.)",
        "GOLDIE:  (Listens intently until door slams, then begins to pack\ntrunk.  Opens trunk first.  Gets jacket from couch where she has\nthrown it, puts it in trunk.  Goes up into bedroom and gets skirt\nwhich hangs out of sight on end of dresser.  Comes down C. shaking\nskirt.  Long, low whistle stops her, then club raps.)  Bull’s!!\n(Looks up at light burning, turns it out and closes the trunk at\nthe same time.  Stands still until she sees the shadow of man’s\nhand in the moonlight on the wall R.  Frightened exclamation, then\ncowers on sofa.  DUGAN appears at window, looks in, then raises\nwindow and enters, closing window after him.  Takes gun out of\npocket, then goes up into kitchen and bedroom.  At door C. he sees\nGOLDIE, points gun at her.",
        "DUGAN:  Ah!  (GOLDIE springs to her feet with frightened exclamation,\nand DUGAN says:) don’t squawk or I’ll pop sure!",
        "GOLDIE:  (Nervously.)  Me squawk?  What do you think I am, a school\nteacher?",
        "DUGAN:  (Goes to door R., opens it to see if anyone is there, closes\nit and locks door.  Comes to C., turns on light, then puts gun in\npocket.  Coming L. to GOLDIE.)  I don’t want to frighten you.",
        "GOLDIE:  (L. nervously.)  I know, but one look at you would scare\nsome people to death.",
        "DUGAN:  Am I that homely?",
        "GOLDIE:  Homely?  Why an undershot bulldog is a peacock, ’long side\nof you.",
        "DUGAN:  Ain’t I welcome?",
        "GOLDIE:  You’re about as welcome as a rainy holiday.  (Sits on sofa.)",
        "DUGAN:  Say, Goldie, we’ve been almost more than friends in the\nlast two years.",
        "GOLDIE:  You mean almost friends.  (Rising.)  Never more.  Dugan, you\nknow why I’ve been your go-between in the System.  Because you\npromised to let up on the Eel.",
        "DUGAN:  I’ll never let up on him.  He’s a crook.",
        "GOLDIE:  Well, what are you?  (Turns L. away from DUGAN.)",
        "DUGAN:  Don’t get sore, Goldie.  You know I want you for myself.\n(Puts his arms around GOLDIE’S waist.)",
        "GOLDIE:  Well, you’re wasting time.  (Pulls savagely away from him\nand crosses R.)",
        "DUGAN:  (Following GOLDIE R.)  Am I?  I’ll get you, or I’ll send you\nboth up for years.",
        "GOLDIE:  (Savagely into DUGAN’s face.)  Is that why you had me steal\nthat necklace?",
        "DUGAN:  Yes, if you want to know it, I’ve been trying for two years\nto get something on you, and now I’ve got you.",
        "GOLDIE:  Well, suppose I squeal.",
        "DUGAN:  It’s my word against yours, the word of an officer against\na crook.",
        "GOLDIE:  Say, Dugan, if looks of contempt would hurt a man’s feelings,\nI’d disable you with a squint.  (DUGAN goes L., getting necklace\nout of pocket; GOLDIE is in panic for fear EEL will ring the bell,\nbut she crosses and sits on trunk.)",
        "DUGAN:  Goldie, this necklace will bring four thousand dollars from\na Buffalo fence, and if you’ll say three words, “I love you,” the\nprice is yours.  Won’t you say them, Goldie?  Just three words?",
        "GOLDIE:  (Thinks it over, then looks at DUGAN.)  Go–to–Hell.",
        "DUGAN:  (Going L. puts back necklace and takes out red wallet, then\ncomes C. to GOLDIE.)  Well, how does this strike you?  Here’s twenty\nthousand dollars.  It’s all yours for the asking.  Twenty thousand\ndollars.  (Sits on trunk beside GOLDIE.)",
        "GOLDIE:  Gee, but you’re doing a land office business.",
        "DUGAN:  I’ve got no kick coming.  Why say, I can take care of you\nin real style.  Why waste your time on the EEL?  I can make more\nmoney in a week than he can steal in a year.",
        "GOLDIE:  That’s because you’re a better thief than he is.  (Rises\nand goes R.)",
        "DUGAN:  I wouldn’t say that.  (Following GOLDIE R.)  Come on, Goldie\n(putting his arms around her, with purse in front of her face),\nwhat’s the answer?",
        "GOLDIE:  (Apparently weakening.)  Twenty thousand dollars!  Gee,\nthat’s a lot of money, and I could live right.",
        "DUGAN:  (Greedily, as though he has won her.)  Sure you could.  I’d\nset you up like a Queen, and between us we could milk the Tenderloin\ndry.",
        "GOLDIE:  But the Eel?",
        "DUGAN:  (Crossing L. and putting wallet away.)  I’ll attend to him!\n(Then to GOLDIE who has come L.)  Listen to this!  Ten minutes after\nyou two were turned loose, an old man was beaten and robbed, not\ntwo blocks from here.  He never came to!  (GOLDIE backs R. in horror.\nDUGAN follows.)  He died on his way to Bellevue.  Do you know who\nthe murderer is?  I’m here to arrest him on the charge of murder.",
        "GOLDIE:  (In mad rage.)  You lie, Dugan!  Billy said you’d frame him,\nbut you won’t this time–(GOLDIE flies at DUGAN as though to scratch\nhis eyes out, but he struggles with her and throws her to the floor\nL.)  No, Dugan, not murder, that would mean the chair!  (GOLDIE on\nknees pleading to DUGAN.  Bell rings three times, they both start.\nDUGAN puzzled and surprised, and GOLDIE terror-stricken, wondering\nwhat to do.  Then the thought of the bell on the wall comes.\nLooking at DUGAN with a forced smile and still on the floor.)  Oh,\nI wonder who that can be?  (By the last two words she is on her\nfeet and makes a dash for the bell up L., but DUGAN reaches it\nfirse.)",
        "DUGAN:  No, you don’t. I’m wise.  “If I answer, don’t come up.\"\n(GOLDIE, in disgusted rage, goes down to head of couch, followed\nby DUGAN.)  Old stuff, Goldie.  Let him come, I want him.  (Door\nslams off stage.  GOLDIE starts and DUGAN goes to door R. and\nunlocks it.  They both stand rigid.  DUGAN with gun in hand, while\nfootsteps come nearer.  As door opens and EEL enters.)",
        "GOLDIE:  Look out, Billy!  (DUGAN grabs EEL’S hand and throws him\nin the room and locks the door.  While he is doing this EEL runs\nacross room over trunk and disappears behind sofa.  When DUGAN\nturns, he can’t locate EEL and points gun up into bedroom.)",
        "DUGAN:  Hands up, Billy!  Hands up!  (He then locates EEL behind\nsofa.)  I won’t tell you again!  Hands up!  (The EEL holds hands up\nand appears behind sofa.) (GOLDIE is up C. behind trunk.)  Goldie,\nfrisk him clean.  (GOLDIE protests.)  Come on!  Come on!  (DUGAN points\ngun at EEL, and GOLDIE runs to him and goes through his pockets.\nShe finds tobacco bag which she hands to DUGAN.  He doesn’t take\nit, and she drops it on floor.)  Get to his gun pocket.  Get to his\ngun pocket.  (GOLDIE hesitates, then goes to EEL’S hip pocket, where\nshe finds a roll of money.  She tries to put it back but DUGAN\nsees it.)  Come on, hand it over.  (GOLDIE appeals to the EEL who\npantomimes to do so, and she hands it to DUGAN.)  This is the money\nhe took from the man he killed.  (Putting money into red wallet and\nreturning wallet to pocket.)",
        "EEL:  Do you think I’d frisk a stiff?  Let me tell you something,\nDugan.  (Throwing hat on floor.)  You staked me two years ago in the\nPen, and then tried to make me believe that Goldie was in on the frame.\nYou lied like a yellow dog, Dugan, and you know it.  Yes, I am a crook\nand a thief, and I’ve robbed a lot of people, but I’m just a little\nbit above you, Dugan, just a little bit above you.  Because, I never\ntook money from a woman, and that’s part of your graft.  (DUGAN takes\nout gun as though to hit EEL with it.  GOLDIE grabs his arm and bites\nhis hand and he drops the gun; Noise begins off stage.  GOLDIE runs\nto door R. while EEL and DUGAN struggle.  DUGAN throws EEL off and\ngoes toward window L. EEL sees gun on floor R., runs and gets it,\nbut GOLDIE prevents his shooting it.  The Police break in the door\nat this point.  One catches GOLDIE as she is running toward the\nwindow L. Another, who comes through the window, catches the EEL.\nThe Inspector stands at door R., crowd back of him.  DUGAN comes\ndown to him.)",
        "DUGAN:  Well, Inspector, I got him.  He robbed and croaked an old\nman.  I got him with the goods on!",
        "INSPECTOR:  Let these people go!  (Pointing to DUGAN.)  There’s your\nman, arrest him!  (GOLDIE and the EEL are released.)",
        "DUGAN:  Inspector, you’ve got nothing on me.",
        "INSPECTOR:  No?  (Crossing to DUGAN.)  Well, there’s a dictagraph in\nthis room (GOLDIE rushes into EEL’S arms.), and we’ve got everything\non you, you dog.  You’re a disgrace to all mankind.  It is unclean\ncurs like you that have bred a cancer in the department, and pointed\nthe finger of suspicion at ten thousand honest policemen.  But\nthat cancer must be cut out, and the operation begins now.  Take\nhim away.  (Policemen hand-cuff DUGAN, who struggles, then resignedly\nwalks off, preceded and followed by police.  The INSPECTOR follows\nthem, but stops and turns at door R.)  Well, Billy!  (EEL and GOLDIE\ncome C. and stand in front of trunk.)",
        "EEL:  Well, Inspector?",
        "INSPECTOR:  If you’re going to live square, stick to it.  (EEL takes\nGOLDIE’S hand.)  I never want to see you at headquarters again.\n(EEL drops his head and GOLDIE puts her arm around him.)  I won’t\neven need you as a witness.  The dictagraph has recorded all.  (EEL\nand GOLDIE pleased.)  Good-night!  (INSPECTOR exits, closing door\nafter him.)",
        "EEL and GOLDIE:  Good-night, Inspector!  (They both listen until his\nfootsteps die off, and door slams.  Then EEL runs to door to listen,\nand GOLDIE sits dejectedly on trunk.)",
        "GOLDIE:  Well, we’re broke again.  (Tearfully.)  We can’t go West\nnow, so there’s no use packing.  (The EEL goes stealthily to window\nL., looks out, pulls dictagraph from wall, then comes down R. of\nGOLDIE who is sitting on trunk and has watched him.  He taps her\non the shoulder, taking DUGAN’S red wallet out of pocket.)",
        "EEL:  Go right ahead and pack!  (GOLDIE looks astounded, and begins\nto laugh.)",

        "MRS. SCHUYLER:  Remember the night you let me flop?",
        "PHIL:  I couldn’t get into my part at all that night.  I kept saying\nto myself:  Phillip, be a bench, be a bench; but when I felt you\nnear me, all the benchiness left me.  When you sat on me, I put\nmy arms about you, like this.  (Does so.)",
        "MRS. SCHUYLER:  Ah–how it all comes back to me now!  When you would\nput your arms about me, I would close my eyes and make believe it\nwas Otis Skinner.  (Business.)",
        "PHIL:  And then before all the crowd, I kissed you so.  (He illustrates\nas PAUL enters with ROSE from arbor.)",

(As he comes\ndown with plums, the girl exits.)  But she said whoever was caught\nsending him any would suffer the penalty of death.  (Gets idea and\ncalls off.)  Phil–Phil!  (Moonlight effect.  As PHIL enters, anxiously,\nPAUL extends the basket of plums to him.)",
