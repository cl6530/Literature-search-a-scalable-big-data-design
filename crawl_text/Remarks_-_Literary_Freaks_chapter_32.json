        "People who write for a livelihood get some queer propositions from those\nwho have crude ideas about the operation of the literary machine. There is\na prevailing idea among those who have never dabbled in literature very\nmuch, that the divine afflatus works a good deal like a corn sheller. This\nis erroneous.",
        "To put a bushel of words into the hopper and have them come out a poem or\na sermon, is a more complicated process than it would seem to the casual\nobserver.",
        "I can hardly be called literary, though I admit that my tastes lie in that\ndirection, and yet I have had some singular experiences in that line. For\ninstance, last year I received flattering overtures from three young men\nwho wanted me to write speeches for them to deliver on the Fourth of July.\nThey could do it themselves, but hadn’t the time. If I would write the\nspeeches they would be willing to revise them. They seemed to think it\nwould be a good idea to write the speeches a little longer than necessary\nand then the poorer parts of the effort could be cut out. Various prices\nwere set on these efforts, from a dollar to “the kindest regards.” People\nwho have squeezed through one of our adult winters in this latitude,\nsubsisting on kind regards, will please communicate with the writer,\nstating how they like it.",
        "One gentleman, who was in the confectionery business, wanted a lot of\n“humorous notices wrote for to put into conversation candy.” It was a big\ntemptation to write something that would be in every lady’s mouth, but I\nrefrained. Writing gum drop epitaphs may properly belong to the domain of\nliterature, but I doubt it. Surely I do not want to be haughty and above\nmy business, but it seems to me that this is irrelevant.",
        "Another man wanted me to write a “piece for his boy to speak,” and if I\nwould do so, I could come to his house some Saturday night and stay over\nSunday. He said that the boy was “a perfect little case to carry on and\nfolks didn’t know whether he would develop into a condemb fool or a\nyoumerist.” So he wanted a piece of one of them tomfoolery kind for the\nlittle cuss to speak the last day of school.",
        "A coal dealer who had risen to affluence by selling coal to the poor by\napothecaries’ weight, wrote to ask me for a design to be used as a family\ncrest and a motto to emblazon on his arms. I told him I had run out of\ncrests, but that “weight for the wagon, we’ll all take a ride,” would be a\ngood motto; or he might use the following: “The fuel and his money are\nsoon parted.” He might emblazon this on his arms, or tattoo it on any\nother part of his system where he thought it would be becoming to his\ncomplexion. I never heard from him again, and I do not know whether he was\noffended or not.",
        "Two young men in Massachusetts wrote me a letter in which they said they\n“had a good thing on mother.” They wanted it written up in a facetious\nvein. They said that their father had been on the coast a few weeks\nbefore, engaged in the eeling industry. Being a good man, but partially\nfull, he had mingled himself in the flowing tide and got drowned. Finally,\nafter several days’ search, the neighbors came in sadly and told the old\nlady thai they had found all that was mortal of James, and there were two\neels in the remains. They asked for further instructions as to deceased.\nThe old lady swabbed out her weeping eyes, braced herself against the sink\nand told the men to “bring in the eels and set him again.”",
        "The boys thought that if this could be properly written up, “it would be a\nmighty good joke on mother.” I was greatly shocked when I received this\nletter. It seemed to me heartless for young men to speak lightly of their\nwidowed mother’s great woe. I wrote them how I felt about it, and rebuked\nthem severely for treating their mother’s grief so lightly. Also for\ntrying to impose upon me with an old chestnut.",
