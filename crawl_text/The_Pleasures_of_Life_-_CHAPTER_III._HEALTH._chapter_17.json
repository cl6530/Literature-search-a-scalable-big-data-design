        "    “Health is best for mortal man; next beauty; thirdly, well gotten\n    wealth; fourthly, the pleasures of youth among friends.”",
        "    SIMONIDES.",
        "But if there has been some difference of opinion as to the advantage of\nwealth, with reference to health all are agreed.",
        "“Health,” said Simonides long ago, “is best for mortal man; next beauty;\nthirdly, well gotten wealth; fourthly, the pleasure of youth among\nfriends.” “Life,” says Longfellow, “without health is a burden, with\nhealth is a joy and gladness.” Empedocles delivered the people of Selinus\nfrom a pestilence by draining a marsh, and was hailed as a Demigod. We are\ntold that a coin was struck in his honor, representing the Philosopher in\nthe act of staying the hand of Phoebus.",
        "We scarcely realize, I think, how much we owe to Doctors. Our system of\nMedicine seems so natural and obvious that it hardly occurs to us as\nsomewhat new and exceptional. When we are ill we send for a Physician; he\nprescribes some medicine; we take it, and pay his fee. But among the lower\nraces of men pain and illness are often attributed to the presence of evil\nspirits. The Medicine Man is a Priest, or rather a Sorcerer, more than a\ntrue Doctor, and his effort is to exorcise the evil spirit.",
        "In other countries where some advance has been made, a charm is written on\na board, washed off, and drunk. In some cases the medicine is taken, not\nby the patient, but by the Doctor. Such a system, however, is generally\ntransient; it is naturally discouraged by the Profession, and is indeed\nincompatible with a large practice. Even as regards the payment we find\nvery different systems. The Chinese pay their medical man as long as they\nare well, and stop his salary as soon as they are ill. In ancient Egypt we\nare told that the patient feed the Doctor for the first few days, after\nwhich the Doctor paid the patient until he made him well. This is a\nfascinating system, but might afford too much temptation to heroic\nremedies.",
        "On the whole our plan seems the best, though it does not offer adequate\nencouragement to discovery and research. We do not appreciate how much we\nowe to the discoveries of such men as Hunter and Jenner, Simpson and\nLister. And yet in the matter of health we can generally do more for\nourselves than the greatest Doctors can for us.",
        "But if all are agreed as to the blessing of health, there are many who\nwill not take the little trouble, or submit to the slight sacrifices,\nnecessary to maintain it. Many, indeed, deliberately ruin their own\nhealth, and incur the certainty of an early grave, or an old age of\nsuffering.",
        "No doubt some inherit a constitution which renders health almost\nunattainable. Pope spoke of that long disease, his life. Many indeed may\nsay, “I suffer, therefore I am.” But happily these cases are exceptional.\nMost of us might be well, if we would. It is very much our own fault that\nwe are ill. We do those things which we ought not to do, and we leave\nundone those things which we ought to have done, and then we wonder there\nis no health in us.",
        "We all know that we can make ourselves ill, but few perhaps realize how\nmuch we can do to keep ourselves well. Much of our suffering is\nself-inflicted. It has been observed that among the ancient Egyptians the\nchief aim of life seemed to be to be well buried. Many, however, live even\nnow as if this were the principal object of their existence.",
        "Like Naaman, we expect our health to be the subject of some miraculous\ninterference, and neglect the homely precautions by which it might be\nsecured.",
        "I am inclined to doubt whether the study of health is sufficiently\nimpressed on the minds of those entering life. Not that it is desirable to\npotter over minor ailments, to con over books on illnesses, or experiment\non ourselves with medicine. Far from it. The less we fancy ourselves ill,\nor bother about little bodily discomforts, the more likely perhaps we are\nto preserve our health.",
        "It is, however, a different matter to study the general conditions of\nhealth. A well-known proverb tells us that every one is a fool or a\nphysician at forty. Unfortunately, however, many persons are invalids at\nforty as well as physicians.",
        "Ill-health, however, is no excuse for moroseness. If we have one disease\nwe may at least congratulate ourselves that we are escaping all the rest.\nSydney Smith, ever ready to look on the bright side of things, once, when\nborne down by suffering, wrote to a friend that he had gout, asthma, and\nseven other maladies, but was “otherwise very well;” and many of the\ngreatest invalids have borne their sufferings with cheerfulness and good\nspirits.",
        "It is said that the celebrated physiognomist, Campanella, could so\nabstract his attention from any sufferings of his body, that he was even\nable to endure the rack without much pain; and whoever has the power of\nconcentrating his attention and controlling his will, can emancipate\nhimself from most of the minor miseries of life. He may have much cause\nfor anxiety, his body may be the seat of severe suffering, and yet his\nmind will remain serene and unaffected; he may triumph over care and pain.",
        "But many have undergone much unnecessary suffering, and valuable lives\nhave often been lost, through ignorance or carelessness. We cannot but\nfancy that the lives of many great men might have been much prolonged by\nthe exercise of a little ordinary care.",
        "If we take musicians only, what a grievous loss to the world it is that\nPergolesi should have died at twenty-six, Schubert at thirty-one, Mozart\nat thirty-five, Purcell at thirty-seven, and Mendelssohn at thirty-eight.",
        "In the old Greek myth the life of Meleager was indissolubly connected by\nfate with the existence of a particular log of wood. As long as this was\nkept safe by Althaea, his mother, Meleager bore a charmed life. It seems\nwonderful that we do not watch with equal care over our body, on the state\nof which happiness so much depends.",
        "The requisites of health are plain enough; regular habits, daily exercise,\ncleanliness, and moderation in all things–in eating as well as in\ndrinking–would keep most people well.",
        "I need not here dwell on the evils of drinking, but we perhaps scarcely\nrealize how much of the suffering and ill-humor of life is due to\nover-eating. Dyspepsia, for instance, from which so many suffer, is in\nnine cases out of ten their own fault, and arises from the combination of\ntoo much food with too little exercise. To lengthen your life, says an old\nproverb, shorten your meals. Plain living and high thinking will secure\nhealth for most of us, though it matters, perhaps, comparatively little\nwhat a healthy man eats, so long as he does not eat too much.",
        "Mr. Gladstone has told us that the splendid health he enjoys is greatly\ndue to his having early learnt one simple physiological maxim, and laid it\ndown as a rule for himself always to make twenty-five bites at every bit\nof meat.",
        "  “Go to your banquet then, but use delight,\n  So as to rise still with an appetite.” [1]",
        "No doubt, however, though the rule not to eat or drink too much is simple\nenough in theory, it is not quite so easy in application. There have been\nmany Esaus who sold their birthright of health for a mess of pottage.",
        "Moreover, it may seem paradoxical, but it is certainly true, that in the\nlong run the moderate man will derive more enjoyment even from eating and\ndrinking, than the glutton or the drunkard will ever obtain. They know not\nwhat it is to enjoy “the exquisite taste of common dry bread.” [2]",
        "And yet even if we were to consider merely the pleasure to be derived from\neating and drinking, the same rule would hold good. A lunch of bread and\ncheese after a good walk is more enjoyable than a Lord Mayor’s feast.\nWithout wishing, like Apicius, for the neck of a stork, so that he might\nenjoy his dinner longer, we must not be ungrateful for the enjoyment we\nderive from eating and drinking, even though they be amongst the least\naesthetic of our pleasures. They are homely, no doubt, but they come\nmorning, noon, and night, and are not the less real because they have\nreference to the body rather than the soul.",
        "We speak truly of a healthy appetite, for it is a good test of our bodily\ncondition; and indeed in some cases of our mental state also. That",
        "    “There cometh no good thing\n  Apart from toil to mortals,”",
        "is especially true with reference to appetite; to sit down to a dinner,\nhowever simple, after a walk with a friend among the mountains or along\nthe shore, is no insignificant pleasure.",
        "Cheerfulness and good humor, moreover, during meals are not only pleasant\nin themselves, but conduce greatly to health.",
        "It has been said that hunger is the best sauce, but most would prefer some\ngood stories at a feast even to a good appetite; and who would not like to\nhave it said of him, as of Biron by Rosaline–",
        "                      “A merrier man\n  Within the limit of becoming mirth\n  I never spent an hour’s talk withal.”",
        "In the three great “Banquets” of Plato, Xenophon, and Plutarch, the food\nis not even mentioned.",
        "In the words of the old Lambeth adage–",
        "  “What is a merry man?\n  Let him do what he can\n  To entertain his guests\n  With wine and pleasant jests,\n  Yet if his wife do frown\n  All merryment goes down.”",
        "What salt is to food, wit and humor are to conversation and literature.\n“You do not,” an amusing writer in the Cornhill has said, “expect humor\nin Thomas a Kempis or Hebrew Prophets;” but we have Solomon’s authority\nthat there is a time to laugh, as well as to weep.",
        "“To read a good comedy is to keep the best company in the world, when the\nbest things are said, and the most amusing things happen.” [3]",
        "It is not without reason that every one resents the imputation of being\nunable to see a joke.",
        "Laughter appears to be the special prerogative of man. The higher animals\npresent us with proof of evident, if not highly developed reasoning power,\nbut it is more than doubtful whether they are capable of appreciating a\njoke.",
        "Wit, moreover, has solved many difficulties and decided many\ncontroversies.",
        "  “Ridicule shall frequently prevail,\n  And cut the knot when graver reasons fail.” [4]",
        "A careless song, says Walpole, with a little nonsense in it now and then,\ndoes not misbecome a monarch, but it is difficult now to realize that\nJames I. should have regarded skill in punning in his selections of\nbishops and privy councillors.",
        "The most wasted of all days, says Chamfort, is that on which one has not\nlaughed.",
        "It is, moreover, no small merit of laughter that it is quite spontaneous.\n“You cannot force people to laugh; you cannot give a reason why they\nshould laugh; they must laugh of themselves or not at all.... If we think\nwe must not laugh, this makes our temptation to laugh the greater.” [5]\nHumor is, moreover, contagious. A witty man may say, as Falstaff does of\nhimself, “I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in\nother men.”",
        "But one may paraphrase the well-known remark about port wine and say that\nsome jokes may be better than others, but anything which makes one laugh\nis good. “After all,” says Dryden, “it is a good thing to laugh at any\nrate; and if a straw can tickle a man, it is an instrument of happiness,\"\nand I may add, of health.",
        "I have been told that in omitting any mention of smoking I was overlooking\none of the real pleasures of life. Not being a smoker myself I cannot\nperhaps judge; much must depend on the individual temperament; to some\nnervous natures it certainly appears to be a great comfort; but I have my\ndoubts whether smoking, as a general rule, does add to the pleasures of\nlife. It must, moreover, detract somewhat from the sensitiveness of taste\nand of smell.",
        "Those who live in cities may almost lay it down as a rule that no time\nspent out of doors is ever wasted. Fresh air is a cordial of incredible\nvirtue; old families are in all senses county families, not town families;\nand those who prefer Homer and Plato and Shakespeare to hares and\npartridges and foxes must beware that they are not tempted to neglect this\ngreat requisite of our nature.",
        "Most Englishmen, however, love open air, and it is probably true that most\nof us enjoy a game at cricket or golf more than looking at any of the old\nmasters. The love of sport is engraven in the English character. As was\nsaid of William Rufus, “he loves the tall deer as he had been their\nfather.”",
        "An Oriental traveler is said to have watched a game of cricket and been\nmuch astonished at hearing that many of those playing were rich men. He\nasked why they did not pay some poor people to do it for them.",
        "Wordsworth made it a rule to go out every day, and he used to say that as\nhe never consulted the weather, he never had to consult the physicians.",
        "It always seems to be raining harder than it really is when you look at\nthe weather through the window. Even in winter, though the landscape often\nseems cheerless and bare enough when you look at it from the fireside,\nstill it is far better to go out, even if you have to brave the storm:\nwhen you are once out of doors the touch of earth and the breath of the\nfresh air gives you fresh life and energy. Men, like trees, live in great\npart on air.",
        "After a gallop over the downs, a row on the river, a sea voyage, a walk by\nthe seashore or in the woods",
        "  “The blue above, the music in the air,\n  The flowers upon the ground,” [6]",
        "one feels as if one could say with Henry IV., “Je me porte comme le Ponte\nNeuf.”",
        "The Roman proverb that a child should be taught nothing which he cannot\nlearn standing up, went no doubt into an extreme, but surely we fall into\nanother when we act as if games were the only thing which boys could learn\nupon their feet.",
        "The love of games among boys is certainly a healthy instinct, and though\ncarried too far in some of our great schools, there can be no question\nthat cricket and football, boating and hockey, bathing and birdnesting,\nare not only the greatest pleasures, but the best medicines for boys.",
        "We cannot always secure sleep. When important decisions have to be taken,\nthe natural anxiety to come to a right decision will often keep us awake.\nNothing, however, is more conducive to healthy sleep than plenty of open\nair. Then indeed we can enjoy the fresh life of the early morning: “the\nbreezy call of incense-bearing morn.” [7]",
        "  “At morn the Blackcock trims his jetty wing,\n      ’Tis morning tempts the linnet’s blithest lay,\n  All nature’s children feel the matin spring\n      Of life reviving with reviving day.”",
        "Epictetus described himself as “a spirit bearing about a corpse.” That\nseems to me an ungrateful description. Surely we ought to cherish the\nbody, even if it be but a frail and humble companion. Do we not own to the\neye our enjoyment of the beauties of this world and the glories of the\nHeavens; to the ear the voices of friends and all the delights of music;\nare not the hands most faithful and invaluable instruments, ever ready in\ncase of need, ever willing to do our bidding; and even the feet bear us\nwithout a murmur along the roughest and stoniest paths of life.",
        "With reasonable care, then, most of us may hope to enjoy good health. And\nyet what a marvellous and complex organization we have!",
        "We are indeed fearfully and wonderfully made. It is",
        "  “Strange that a harp of a thousand strings,\n  Should keep in tune so long.”",
        "When we consider the marvellous complexity of our bodily organization, it\nseems a miracle that we should live at all; much more that the innumerable\norgans and processes should continue day after day and year after year\nwith so much regularity and so little friction that we are sometimes\nscarcely conscious of having a body at all.",
        "And yet in that body we have more than 200 bones, of complex and varied\nforms, any irregularity in, or injury to, which would of course grievously\ninterfere with our movements.",
        "We have over 500 muscles; each nourished by almost innumerable blood\nvessels, and regulated by nerves. One of our muscles, the heart, beats\nover 30,000,000 times in a year, and if it once stops, all is over.",
        "In the skin are wonderfully varied and complex organs–for instance, over\n2,000,000 perspiration glands, which regulate the temperature and\ncommunicate with the surface by ducts, which have a total length of some\nten miles.",
        "Think of the miles of arteries and veins, of capillaries and nerves; of\nthe blood, with the millions of millions of blood corpuscles, each a\nmicrocosm in itself.",
        "Think of the organs of sense,–the eye with its cornea and lens, vitreous\nhumor, aqueous humor, and choroid, culminating in the retina, no thicker\nthan a sheet of paper, and yet consisting of nine distinct layers, the\ninnermost composed of rods and cones, supposed to be the immediate\nrecipients of the undulations of light, and so numerous that in each eye\nthe cones are estimated at over 3,000,000, the rods at over 30,000,000.",
        "Above all, and most wonderful of all, the brain itself. Meinert has\ncalculated that the gray matter of the convolutions alone contains no less\nthan 600,000,000 cells; each cell consists of several thousand visible\natoms, and each atom again of many millions of molecules.",
        "And yet with reasonable care we can most of us keep this wonderful\norganization in health; so that it will work without causing us pain, or\neven discomfort, for many years; and we may hope that even when old age\ncomes",
        "                 “Time may lay his hand\n  Upon your heart gently, not smiting it\n  But as a harper lays his open palm\n  Upon his harp, to deaden its vibrations.”",
