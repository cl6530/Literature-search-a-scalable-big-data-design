        "There has always, no doubt, been a castle at Venosa. Frederick\nBarbarossa lived here oftener than in Sicily; from these regions he\ncould look over to his beloved East, and the security of this particular\nkeep induced him to store his treasures therein. The indefatigable\nHuillard Breholles has excavated some account of them from the\nHohen-staufen records. Thus we learn that here, at Venosa, the Emperor\ndeposited that marvel, that tentorium, I mean, mirifica arte\nconstructum, in quo imagines solis et lunce artificialiter motte, cursum\nsuum certis et debitis spatiis peragrant, et boras diei et noctis\nin-fallibiliter indicant. Cuius tentorii valor viginti millium marcarum\npretium dicitur transcendisse. It was given him by the Sultan of\nBabylonia. Always the glowing Oriental background!",
        "The present castle, a picturesque block with moat and corner towers, was\nbuilt in 1470 by the redoubtable Pierro del Balzo. A church used to\noccupy the site, but the warrior, recognizing its strategic advantages,\ntransplanted the holy edifice to some other part of the town. It is now\na ruin, the inhabitable portions of which have been converted into cheap\nlodgings for sundry poor folk–a monetary speculation of some local\nmagnate, who paid 30,000 francs for the whole structure. You can climb\nup into one of the shattered towers whereon reposes an old cannon amid a\nwind-sown garden of shrubs and weeds. Here the jackdaws congregate at\nnightfall, flying swiftly and noiselessly to their resting-place. Odd,\nhow quiet Italian jackdaws are, compared with those of England; they\nhave discarded their voices, which is the best thing they could have\ndone in a land where every one persecutes them. There is also a dungeon\nat this castle, an underground recess with cunningly contrived\nprojections in its walls to prevent prisoners from climbing upwards; and\nother horrors.",
        "The cathedral of Venosa contains a chapel with an unusually nne portal\nof Renaissance work, but the chief architectural beauty of the town is\nthe decayed Benedictine abbey of La Trinita. The building is roofless;\nit was never completed, and the ravages of time and of man have not\nspared it; earthquakes, too, have played sad tricks with its arches and\ncolumns, particularly that of 1851, which destroyed the neighbouring\ntown of Melfi. It stands beyond the more modern settlement on what is\nnow a grassy plain, and attached to it is a Norman chapel containing the\nbones of Alberada, mother of Boemund, and others of her race. Little of\nthe original structure of this church is left, though its walls are\nstill adorned, in patches, with frescoes of genuine angels–attractive\ncreatures, as far removed from those bloodless Byzantine anatomies as\nfrom the plethoric and insipid females of the settecento. There is\nalso a queenly portrait declared to represent Catherine of Siena. I\nwould prefer to follow those who think it is meant for Sigilgaita.",
        "Small as it is, this place–the church and the abbey–is not one for a\ncasual visit. Lenormant calls the Trinita a “Musee epigra-phique\"–so\nmany are the Latin inscriptions which the monks have worked into its\nmasonry. They have encrusted the walls with them; and many antiquities\nof other kinds have been deposited here since those days. The ruin is\nstrewn with columns and capitals of fantastic devices; the inevitable\nlions, too, repose upon its grassy floor, as well as a pagan altar-stone\nthat once adorned the neighbouring amphitheatre. One thinks of the\nlabour expended in raising those prodigious blocks and fitting them\ntogether without mortar in their present positions–they, also, came\nfrom the amphitheatre, and the sturdy letterings engraved on some of\nthem formed, once upon a time, a sentence that ran round that building,\nrecording the names of its founders.",
        "Besides the Latin inscriptions, there are Hebrew funereal stones of\ngreat interest, for a colony of Jews was established here between the\nyears 400 and 800; poor folks, for the most part; no one knows whence\nthey came or whither they went. One is apt to forget that south Italy\nwas swarming with Jews for centuries. The catacombs of Venosa were\ndiscovered in 1853. Their entrance lies under a hill-side not far from\nthe modern railway station, and Professor Mueller, a lover of Venosa,\nhas been engaged for the last twenty-five years in writing a ponderous\ntome on the subject. Unfortunately (so they say) there is not much\nchance of its ever seeing the light, for just as he is on the verge of\npublication, some new Jewish catacombs are discovered in another part of\nthe world which cause the Professor to revise all his previous theories.\nThe work must be written anew and brought up to date, and hardly is this\naccomplished when fresh catacombs are found elsewhere, necessitating a\nfurther revision. The Professor once more rewrites the whole. . . .",
        "You will find accounts of the Trinita in Bertaux, Schulz and other\nwriters. Italian ones tell us what sounds rather surprising, namely,\nthat the abbey was built after a Lombard model, and not a French one. Be\nthat as it may–and they certainly show good grounds for their\ncontention–the ruin is a place of rare charm. Not easily can one see\nrelics of Roman, Hebrew and Norman life crushed into so small a space,\nwelded together by the massive yet fair architecture of the\nBenedictines, and interpenetrated, at the same time, with a\nMephistophelian spirit of modern indifference. Of cynical\ninsouciance; for although this is a “national monument,” nothing\nwhatever is done in the way of repairs. Never a month passes without\nsome richly carven block of stonework toppling down into the weeds,\n[Footnote: The process of decay can be seen by comparing my photograph\nof the east front with that taken to illustrate Giuseppe de Lorenzo’s\nmonograph “Venosa e la Regione del Vulture” (Bergamo, 1906).]\nand were it not for the zeal of a private citizen, the interior of the\nbuilding would long ago have become an impassable chaos of stones and\nshrubbery. The Trinita cannot be restored without enormous outlay;\nnobody dreams of such a thing. A yearly expenditure of ten pounds,\nhowever, would go far towards arresting its fall. But where shall the\nmoney be found? This enthusiastic nation, so enamoured of all that is\nexquisite in art, will spend sixty million francs on a new Ministry of\nJustice which, barely completed, is already showing signs of disrupture;\nit will cheerfully vote (vide daily press) the small item of eighty\nthousand francs to supply that institution with pens and ink–lucky\ncontractor!–while this and a hundred other buildings of singular beauty\nare allowed to crumble to pieces, day by day.",
        "Not far from the abbey there stands a church dedicated to Saint Roque.\nGo within, if you wish to see the difference between Benedictine dignity\nand the buffoonery which subsequently tainted the Catholicism of the\nyouth. On its gable sits a strange emblem: a large stone dog, gazing\namiably at the landscape. The saint, during his earthly career, was\nalways accompanied by a dog, and now likes to have him on the roof of\nhis sanctuary.",
        "The Norman church attached to the Trinita lies at a lower level than\nthat building, having been constructed, says Lupoli, on the foundations\nof a temple to Hymenaeus. It may be so; but one distrusts Lupoli. A\nremarkable Norman capital, now wrought into a font, is preserved here,\nand I was interested in watching the behaviour of a procession of female\npilgrims in regard to it. Trembling with emotion, they perambulated the\nsacred stone, kissing every one of its corners; then they dipped their\nhands into its basin, and kissed them devoutly. An old hag, the mistress\nof the ceremonies, muttered: “tutti santi–tutti santi!” at each\nosculation. Next, they prostrated themselves on the floor and licked\nthe cold stones, and after wallowing there awhile, rose up and began to\nkiss a small fissure in the masonry of the wall, the old woman\nwhispering, “Santissimo!” A familiar spectacle, no doubt; but one which\nnever fails of its effect. This anti-hygienic crack in the wall, with\nits suggestions of yoni-worship, attracted me so strongly that I begged\na priest to explain to me its mystical signification. But he only said,\nwith a touch of mediaeval contempt:",
        "“Sono femine!“",
        "He showed me, later on, a round Roman pillar near the entrance of the\nchurch worn smooth by the bodies of females who press themselves between\nit and the wall, in order to become mothers. The notion caused him some\namusement–he evidently thought this practice a speciality of Venosa.",
        "In my country, I said, pillars with a contrary effect would be more\npopular among the fair sex.",
        "Lear gives another account of this phallic emblem. He says that\nperambulating it hand in hand with another person, the two are sure to\nremain friends for life.",
        "This is pre-eminently a “Victorian” version.",
