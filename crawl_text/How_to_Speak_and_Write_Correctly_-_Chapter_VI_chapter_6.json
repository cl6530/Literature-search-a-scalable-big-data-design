        "LETTER WRITING",
        "Principles of Letter-Writing–Forms–Notes",
        "Many people seem to regard letter-writing as a very simple and easily\nacquired branch, but on the contrary it is one of the most difficult\nforms of composition and requires much patience and labor to master its\ndetails. In fact there are very few perfect letter-writers in the\nlanguage. It constitutes the direct form of speech and may be called\nconversation at a distance. Its forms are so varied by every conceivable\ntopic written at all times by all kinds of persons in all kinds of moods\nand tempers and addressed to all kinds of persons of varying degrees in\nsociety and of different pursuits in life, that no fixed rules can be\nlaid down to regulate its length, style or subject matter. Only general\nsuggestions can be made in regard to scope and purpose, and the forms of\nindicting set forth which custom and precedent have sanctioned.",
        "The principles of letter-writing should be understood by everybody who\nhas any knowledge of written language, for almost everybody at some time\nor other has necessity to address some friend or acquaintance at a\ndistance, whereas comparatively few are called upon to direct their\nefforts towards any other kind of composition.",
        "Formerly the illiterate countryman, when he had occasion to communicate\nwith friends or relations, called in the peripatetic schoolmaster as his\namanuensis, but this had one draw-back,–secrets had to be poured into an\near other than that for which they were intended, and often the\nconfidence was betrayed.",
        "Now, that education is abroad in the land, there is seldom any occasion\nfor any person to call upon the service of another to compose and write a\npersonal letter. Very few now-a-days are so grossly illiterate as not to\nbe able to read and write. No matter how crude his effort may be it is\nbetter for any one to write his own letters than trust to another. Even\nif he should commence,–\"deer fren, i lift up my pen to let ye no that i\nhove been sik for the past 3 weeks, hopping this will findye the same,\"\nhis spelling and construction can be excused in view of the fact that his\nintention is good, and that he is doing his best to serve his own turn\nwithout depending upon others.",
        "The nature, substance and tone of any letter depend upon the occasion\nthat calls it forth, upon the person writing it and upon the person for\nwhom it is intended. Whether it should be easy or formal in style, plain\nor ornate, light or serious, gay or grave, sentimental or matter-of-fact\ndepend upon these three circumstances.",
        "In letter writing the first and most important requisites are to be\nnatural and simple; there should be no straining after effect, but simply\na spontaneous out-pouring of thoughts and ideas as they naturally occur\nto the writer. We are repelled by a person who is stiff and labored in\nhis conversation and in the same way the stiff and labored letter bores\nthe reader. Whereas if it is light and in a conversational vein it\nimmediately engages his attention.",
        "The letter which is written with the greatest facility is the best kind\nof letter because it naturally expresses what is in the writer, he has\nnot to search for his words, they flow in a perfect unison with the ideas\nhe desires to communicate. When you write to your friend John Browne to\ntell him how you spent Sunday you have not to look around for the words,\nor study set phrases with a view to please or impress Browne, you just\ntell him the same as if he were present before you, how you spent the\nday, where you were, with whom you associated and the chief incidents\nthat occurred during the time. Thus, you write natural and it is such\nwriting that is adapted to epistolary correspondence.",
        "There are different kinds of letters, each calling for a different style\nof address and composition, nevertheless the natural key should be\nmaintained in all, that is to say, the writer should never attempt to\nconvey an impression that he is other than what he is. It would be silly\nas well as vain for the common street laborer of a limited education to\ntry to put on literary airs and emulate a college professor; he may have\nas good a brain, but it is not as well developed by education, and he\nlacks the polish which society confers. When writing a letter the street\nlaborer should bear in mind that only the letter of a street-laborer is\nexpected from him, no matter to whom his communication may be addressed\nand that neither the grammar nor the diction of a Chesterfield or\nGladstone is looked for in his language. Still the writer should keep in\nmind the person to whom he is writing. If it is to an Archbishop or some\nother great dignitary of Church or state it certainly should be couched\nin terms different from those he uses to John Browne, his intimate\nfriend. Just as he cannot say “Dear John” to an Archbishop, no more can\nhe address him in the familiar words he uses to his friend of everyday\nacquaintance and companionship. Yet there is no great learning required\nto write to an Archbishop, no more than to an ordinary individual. All\nthe laborer needs to know is the form of address and how to properly\nutilize his limited vocabulary to the best advantage. Here is the form\nfor such a letter:",
        "                                 17 Second Avenue,\n                                      New York City.\n                                        January 1st, 1910.",
        "               Most Rev. P. A. Jordan,\n                   Archbishop of New York.",
        "               Most Rev. and dear Sir:–\n                  While sweeping the crossing at Fifth\n               Avenue and 50th street on last Wednesday\n               morning, I found the enclosed Fifty Dollar\n               Bill, which I am sending to you in the hope\n               that it may be restored to the rightful\n               owner.\n                  I beg you will acknowledge receipt and\n               should the owner be found I trust you will\n               notify me, so that I may claim some reward\n               for my honesty.\n                  I am, Most Rev. and dear Sir,",
        "                          Very respectfully yours,\n                                          Thomas Jones.",
        "Observe the brevity of the letter. Jones makes no suggestions to the\nArchbishop how to find the owner, for he knows the course the Archbishop\nwill adopt, of having the finding of the bill announced from the Church\npulpits. Could Jones himself find the owner there would be no occasion to\napply to the Archbishop.",
        "This letter, it is true, is different from that which he would send to\nBrowne. Nevertheless it is simple without being familiar, is just a plain\nstatement, and is as much to the point for its purpose as if it were\ngarnished with rhetoric and “words of learned length and thundering\nsound.”",
        "Letters may be divided into those of friendship, acquaintanceship, those\nof business relations, those written in an official capacity by public\nservants, those designed to teach, and those which give accounts of the\ndaily happenings on the stage of life, in other words, news letters.",
        "Letters of friendship are the most common and their style and form\ndepend upon the degree of relationship and intimacy existing between the\nwriters and those addressed. Between relatives and intimate friends the\nbeginning and end may be in the most familiar form of conversation,\neither affectionate or playful. They should, however, never overstep the\nboundaries of decency and propriety, for it is well to remember that,\nunlike conversation, which only is heard by the ears for which it is\nintended, written words may come under eyes other than those for whom\nthey were designed. Therefore, it is well never to write anything which\nthe world may not read without detriment to your character or your\ninstincts. You can be joyful, playful, jocose, give vent to your feelings,\nbut never stoop to low language and, above all, to language savoring in\nthe slightest degree of moral impropriety.",
        "Business letters are of the utmost importance on account of the\ninterests involved. The business character of a man or of a firm is often\njudged by the correspondence. On many occasions letters instead of\ndeveloping trade and business interests and gaining clientele, predispose\npeople unfavorably towards those whom they are designed to benefit.\nAmbiguous, slip-shod language is a detriment to success. Business letters\nshould be clear, concise, to the point and, above all, honest, giving no\nwrong impressions or holding out any inducements that cannot be fulfilled.\nIn business letters, just as in business conduct, honesty is always the\nbest policy.",
        "Official letters are mostly always formal. They should possess clearness,\nbrevity and dignity of tone to impress the receivers with the proper\nrespect for the national laws and institutions.",
        "Letters designed to teach or didactic letters are in a class all by\nthemselves. They are simply literature in the form of letters and are\nemployed by some of the best writers to give their thoughts and ideas a\ngreater emphasis. The most conspicuous example of this kind of composition\nis the book on Etiquette by Lord Chesterfield, which took the form of a\nseries of letters to his son.",
        "News letters are accounts of world happenings and descriptions of\nceremonies and events sent into the newspapers. Some of the best authors\nof our time are newspaper men who write in an easy flowing style which is\nmost readable, full of humor and fancy and which carries one along with\nbreathless interest from beginning to end.",
        "The principal parts of a letter are (1) the heading or introduction;\n(2) the body or substance of the letter; (3) the subscription or\nclosing expression and signature; (4) the address or direction on the\nenvelope. For the body of a letter no forms or rules can be laid down\nas it altogether depends on the nature of the letter and the relationship\nbetween the writer and the person addressed.",
        "There are certain rules which govern the other three features and which\ncustom has sanctioned. Every one should be acquainted with these rules.",
        "The Heading has three parts, viz., the name of the place, the date of\nwriting and the designation of the person or persons addressed; thus:",
        "                                   73 New Street,\n                                       Newark, N. J.,\n                                      February 1st, 1910.\n          Messr. Ginn and Co.,\n              New York\n          Gentlemen:",
        "The name of the place should never be omitted; in cities, street and\nnumber should always be given, and except when the city is large and very\nconspicuous, so that there can be no question as to its identity with\nanother of the same or similar name, the abbreviation of the State should\nbe appended, as in the above, Newark, N. J. There is another Newark in\nthe State of Ohio. Owing to failure to comply with this rule many letters\ngo astray. The date should be on every letter, especially business\nletters. The date should never be put at the bottom in a business letter,\nbut in friendly letters this may be done. The designation of the\nperson or persons addressed differs according to the relations of the\ncorrespondents. Letters of friendship may begin in many ways according to\nthe degrees of friendship or intimacy. Thus:",
        "  My dear Wife:\n  My dear Husband:\n  My dear Friend:\n  My darling Mother:\n  My dearest Love:\n  Dear Aunt:\n  Dear Uncle:\n  Dear George: etc.",
        "To mark a lesser degree of intimacy such formal designations as the\nfollowing may be employed:",
        "  Dear Sir:\n  My dear Sir:\n  Dear Mr. Smith:\n  Dear Madam: etc.",
        "For clergymen who have the degree of Doctor of Divinity, the designation\nis as follows:",
        "  Rev. Alban Johnson, D. D.\n  My dear Sir: or Rev. and dear Sir: or more familiarly\n  Dear Dr. Johnson:",
        "Bishops of the Roman and Anglican Communions are addressed as\nRight Reverend.",

        "The plural of Mr. as in addressing a firm is Messrs, and the\ncorresponding salutation is Dear Sirs: or Gentlemen:\nIn England Esq. is used for Mr. as a mark of slight superiority and\nin this country it is sometimes used, but it is practically obsolete.\nCustom is against it and American sentiment as well. If it is used it\nshould be only applied to lawyers and justices of the peace.",
        "The Subscription or ending of a letter consists of the term of respect\nor affection and the signature. The term depends upon the relation of the\nperson addressed. Letters of friendship can close with such expressions\nas:",

        "as between husbands and wives or between lovers. Such gushing\nterminations as Your Own Darling, Your own Dovey and other pet and silly\nendings should be avoided, as they denote shallowness. Love can be\nstrongly expressed without dipping into the nonsensical and the farcical.",

        "          Yours Sincerely,\n          Yours truly,\n          Respectfully yours,",

        "are condemned as savoring too much of affectation.",
        "It is better to finish formal letters without any such qualifying\nremarks. If you are writing to Mr. Ryan to tell him that you have a house\nfor sale, after describing the house and stating the terms simply sign\nyourself",
        "            Your obedient Servant\n            Yours very truly,\n            Yours with respect,\n              James Wilson.",

        "Don’t abbreviate the signature as: Y’rs Resp’fly and always make\nyour sex obvious. Write plainly",
        "  Yours truly,\n  John Field\nand not J. Field, so that the person to whom you send it may not take\nyou for Jane Field.",
        "It is always best to write the first name in full. Married women should\nprefix Mrs. to their names, as",
        "  Very sincerely yours,\n  Mrs. Theodore Watson.",
        "If you are sending a letter acknowledging a compliment or some kindness\ndone you may say, Yours gratefully, or Yours very gratefully, in\nproportion to the act of kindness received.",
        "It is not customary to sign letters of degrees or titles after your name,\nexcept you are a lord, earl or duke and only known by the title, but as\nwe have no such titles in America it is unnecessary to bring this matter\ninto consideration. Don’t sign yourself,",
        "           Sincerely yours,\n             Obadiah Jackson, M.A. or L.L. D.",
        "If you’re an M. A. or an L.L. D. people generally know it without your\nsounding your own trumpet. Many people, and especially clergymen, are\nfond of flaunting after their names degrees they have received honoris\ncausa, that is, degrees as a mark of honor, without examination. Such\ndegrees should be kept in the background. Many a deadhead has these\ndegrees which he could never have earned by brain work.",
        "Married women whose husbands are alive may sign the husband’s name with\nthe prefix Mrs: thus,",
        "  Yours sincerely,\n  Mrs. William Southey.",
        "but when the husband is dead the signature should be–",
        "    Yours sincerely,\n    Mrs. Sarah Southey.",
        "So when we receive a letter from a woman we are enabled to tell whether\nshe has a husband living or is a widow. A woman separated from her\nhusband but not a divorcee should not sign his name.",
        "The address of a letter consists of the name, the title and the\nresidence.",
        "          Mr. Hugh Black,\n            112 Southgate Street,\n              Altoona,\n                      Pa.",
        "Intimate friends have often familiar names for each other, such as pet\nnames, nicknames, etc., which they use in the freedom of conversation,\nbut such names should never, under any circumstances, appear on the\nenvelope. The subscription on the envelope should be always written with\npropriety and correctness and as if penned by an entire stranger. The\nonly difficulty in the envelope inscription is the title. Every man is\nentitled to Mr. and every lady to Mrs. and every unmarried lady to\nMiss. Even a boy is entitled to Master. When more than one is addressed\nthe title is Messrs. Mesdames is sometimes written of women. If the\nperson addressed has a title it is courteous to use it, but titles never\nmust be duplicated. Thus, we can write",
        "  Robert Stitt, M. D., but never\n  Dr. Robert Stitt, M. D, or\n  Mr. Robert Stitt, M. D.",
        "In writing to a medical doctor it is well to indicate his profession by\nthe letters M. D. so as to differentiate him from a D. D. It is better to\nwrite Robert Stitt, M. D., than Dr. Robert Stitt.",
        "In the case of clergymen the prefix Rev. is retained even when they have\nother titles; as",
        "  Rev. Tracy Tooke, LL. D.",
        "When a person has more titles than one it is customary to only give him\nthe leading one. Thus instead of writing Rev. Samuel MacComb, B. A.,\nM. A., B. Sc., Ph. D., LL. D., D. D. the form employed is Rev. Samuel\nMacComb, LL. D. LL. D. is appended in preference to D. D. because in most\ncases the “Rev.” implies a “D. D.” while comparatively few with the prefix\n“Rev.” are entitled to “LL. D.”",
        "In the case of Honorables such as Governors, Judges, Members of Congress,\nand others of the Civil Government the prefix “Hon.” does away with Mr.and Esq. Thus we write Hon. Josiah Snifkins, not Hon. Mr. Josiah Snifkins\nor Hon. Josiah Snifkins, Esq. Though this prefix Hon. is also often\napplied to Governors they should be addressed as Excellency. For instance:",
        "          His Excellency,\n            Charles E. Hughes,\n                          Albany,\n                               N. Y.",

        "The residence of the person addressed should be plainly written out in\nfull. The street and numbers should be given and the city or town written\nvery legibly. If the abbreviation of the State is liable to be confounded\nor confused with that of another then the full name of the State should\nbe written. In writing the residence on the envelope, instead of putting\nit all in one line as is done at the head of a letter, each item of the\nresidence forms a separate line. Thus,",
        "          Liberty,\n            Sullivan County,\n                          New York.",

        "There should be left a space for the postage stamp in the upper right\nhand corner. The name and title should occupy a line that is about\ncentral between the top of the envelope and the bottom. The name should\nneither be too much to right or left but located in the centre, the\nbeginning and end at equal distances from either end.",
        "In writing to large business concerns which are well known or to public\nor city officials it is sometimes customary to leave out number and street.\nThus,",
        "          Messrs. Seigel, Cooper Co.,\n                        New York City,",
        "          Hon. William J. Gaynor,\n                           New York City.",
        "Notes may be regarded as letters in miniature confined chiefly to\ninvitations, acceptances, regrets and introductions, and modern etiquette\ntends towards informality in their composition. Card etiquette, in fact,\nhas taken the place of ceremonious correspondence and informal notes are\nnow the rule. Invitations to dinner and receptions are now mostly written\non cards. “Regrets” are sent back on visiting cards with just the one\nword “Regrets” plainly written thereon. Often on cards and notes of\ninvitation we find the letters R. S. V. P. at the bottom. These letters\nstand for the French repondez s’il vous plait, which means “Reply, if\nyou please,” but there is no necessity to put this on an invitation card\nas every well-bred person knows that a reply is expected. In writing\nnotes to young ladies of the same family it should be noted that the\neldest daughter of the house is entitled to the designation Miss without\nany Christian name, only the surname appended. Thus if there are three\ndaughters in the Thompson family Martha, the eldest, Susan and Jemina,\nMartha is addressed as Miss Thompson and the other two as Miss Susan\nThompson and Miss Jemina Thompson respectively.",
        "Don’t write the word addressed on the envelope of a note.",
        "Don’t seal a note delivered by a friend.",
