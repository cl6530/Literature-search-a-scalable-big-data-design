        "\n\n",
        "Walking the other day in Cheapside I saw some turtles in Mr.\nSweeting’s window, and was tempted to stay and look at them.  As I\ndid so I was struck not more by the defences with which they were\nhedged about, than by the fatuousness of trying to hedge that in at\nall which, if hedged thoroughly, must die of its own defencefulness.\nThe holes for the head and feet through which the turtle leaks out,\nas it were, on to the exterior world, and through which it again\nabsorbs the exterior world into itself—\"catching on” through them\nto things that are thus both turtle and not turtle at one and the\nsame time—these holes stultify the armour, and show it to have been\ndesigned by a creature with more of faithfulness to a fixed idea,\nand hence one-sidedness, than of that quick sense of relative\nimportances and their changes, which is the main factor of good\nliving.",
        "The turtle obviously had no sense of proportion; it differed so\nwidely from myself that I could not comprehend it; and as this word\noccurred to me, it occurred also that until my body comprehended its\nbody in a physical material sense, neither would my mind be able to\ncomprehend its mind with any thoroughness.  For unity of mind can\nonly be consummated by unity of body; everything, therefore, must be\nin some respects both knave and fool to all that which has not eaten\nit, or by which it has not been eaten.  As long as the turtle was in\nthe window and I in the street outside, there was no chance of our\ncomprehending one another.",
        "Nevertheless I knew that I could get it to agree with me if I could\nso effectually button-hole and fasten on to it as to eat it.  Most\nmen have an easy method with turtle soup, and I had no misgiving but\nthat if I could bring my first premise to bear I should prove the\nbetter reasoner.  My difficulty lay in this initial process, for I\nhad not with me the argument that would alone compel Mr. Sweeting\nthink that I ought to be allowed to convert the turtles—I mean I\nhad no money in my pocket.  No missionary enterprise can be carried\non without any money at all, but even so small a sum as half-a-crown\nwould, I suppose, have enabled me to bring the turtle partly round,\nand with many half-crowns I could in time no doubt convert the lot,\nfor the turtle needs must go where the money drives.  If, as is\nalleged, the world stands on a turtle, the turtle stands on money.\nNo money no turtle.  As for money, that stands on opinion, credit,\ntrust, faith—things that, though highly material in connection with\nmoney, are still of immaterial essence.",
        "The steps are perfectly plain.  The men who caught the turtles\nbrought a fairly strong and definite opinion to bear upon them, that\npassed into action, and later on into money.  They thought the\nturtles would come that way, and verified their opinion; on this,\nwill and action were generated, with the result that the men turned\nthe turtles on their backs and carried them off.  Mr. Sweeting\ntouched these men with money, which is the outward and visible sign\nof verified opinion.  The customer touches Mr. Sweeting with money,\nMr. Sweeting touches the waiter and the cook with money.  They touch\nthe turtle with skill and verified opinion.  Finally, the customer\napplies the clinching argument that brushes all sophisms aside, and\nbids the turtle stand protoplasm to protoplasm with himself, to know\neven as it is known.",
        "But it must be all touch, touch, touch; skill, opinion, power, and\nmoney, passing in and out with one another in any order we like, but\nstill link to link and touch to touch.  If there is failure anywhere\nin respect of opinion, skill, power, or money, either as regards\nquantity or quality, the chain can be no stronger than its weakest\nlink, and the turtle and the clinching argument will fly asunder.\nOf course, if there is an initial failure in connection, through\ndefect in any member of the chain, or of connection between the\nlinks, it will no more be attempted to bring the turtle and the\nclinching argument together, than it will to chain up a dog with two\npieces of broken chain that are disconnected.  The contact\nthroughout must be conceived as absolute; and yet perfect contact is\ninconceivable by us, for on becoming perfect it ceases to be\ncontact, and becomes essential, once for all inseverable, identity.\nThe most absolute contact short of this is still contact by courtesy\nonly.  So here, as everywhere else, Eurydice glides off as we are\nabout to grasp her.  We can see nothing face to face; our utmost\nseeing is but a fumbling of blind finger-ends in an overcrowded\npocket.",
        "Presently my own blind finger-ends fished up the conclusion, that as\nI had neither time nor money to spend on perfecting the chain that\nwould put me in full spiritual contact with Mr. Sweeting’s turtles,\nI had better leave them to complete their education at some one\nelse’s expense rather than mine, so I walked on towards the Bank.\nAs I did so it struck me how continually we are met by this melting\nof one existence into another.  The limits of the body seem well\ndefined enough as definitions go, but definitions seldom go far.\nWhat, for example, can seem more distinct from a man than his banker\nor his solicitor?  Yet these are commonly so much parts of him that\nhe can no more cut them off and grow new ones, than he can grow new\nlegs or arms; neither must he wound his solicitor; a wound in the\nsolicitor is a very serious thing.  As for his bank—failure of his\nbank’s action may be as fatal to a man as failure of his heart.  I\nhave said nothing about the medical or spiritual adviser, but most\nmen grow into the society that surrounds them by the help of these\nfour main tap-roots, and not only into the world of humanity, but\ninto the universe at large.  We can, indeed, grow butchers, bakers,\nand greengrocers, almost ad libitum, but these are low developments,\nand correspond to skin, hair, or finger-nails.  Those of us again\nwho are not highly enough organised to have grown a solicitor or\nbanker can generally repair the loss of whatever social organisation\nthey may possess as freely as lizards are said to grow new tails;\nbut this with the higher social, as well as organic, developments is\nonly possible to a very limited extent.",
        "The doctrine of metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls—a\ndoctrine to which the foregoing considerations are for the most part\neasy corollaries—crops up no matter in what direction we allow our\nthoughts to wander.  And we meet instances of transmigration of body\nas well as of soul.  I do not mean that both body and soul have\ntransmigrated together, far from it; but that, as we can often\nrecognise a transmigrated mind in an alien body, so we not less\noften see a body that is clearly only a transmigration, linked on to\nsome one else’s new and alien soul.  We meet people every day whose\nbodies are evidently those of men and women long dead, but whose\nappearance we know through their portraits.  We see them going about\nin omnibuses, railway carriages, and in all public places.  The\ncards have been shuffled, and they have drawn fresh lots in life and\nnationalities, but any one fairly well up in mediaeval and last\ncentury portraiture knows them at a glance.",
        "Going down once towards Italy I saw a young man in the train whom I\nrecognised, only he seemed to have got younger.  He was with a\nfriend, and his face was in continual play, but for some little time\nI puzzled in vain to recollect where it was that I had seen him\nbefore.  All of a sudden I remembered he was King Francis I. of\nFrance.  I had hitherto thought the face of this king impossible,\nbut when I saw it in play I understood it.  His great contemporary\nHenry VIII. keeps a restaurant in Oxford Street.  Falstaff drove one\nof the St. Gothard diligences for many years, and only retired when\nthe railway was opened.  Titian once made me a pair of boots at\nVicenza, and not very good ones.  At Modena I had my hair cut by a\nyoung man whom I perceived to be Raffaelle.  The model who sat to\nhim for his celebrated Madonnas is first lady in a confectionery\nestablishment at Montreal.  She has a little motherly pimple on the\nleft side of her nose that is misleading at first, but on\nexamination she is readily recognised; probably Raffaelle’s model\nhad the pimple too, but Raffaelle left it out—as he would.",
        "Handel, of course, is Madame Patey.  Give Madame Patey Handel’s wig\nand clothes, and there would be no telling her from Handel.  It is\nnot only that the features and the shape of the head are the same,\nbut there is a certain imperiousness of expression and attitude\nabout Handel which he hardly attempts to conceal in Madame Patey.\nIt is a curious coincidence that he should continue to be such an\nincomparable renderer of his own music.  Pope Julius II. was the\nlate Mr. Darwin.  Rameses II. is a blind woman now, and stands in\nHolborn, holding a tin mug.  I never could understand why I always\nfound myself humming “They oppressed them with burthens” when I\npassed her, till one day I was looking in Mr. Spooner’s window in\nthe Strand, and saw a photograph of Rameses II.  Mary Queen of Scots\nwears surgical boots and is subject to fits, near the Horse Shoe in\nTottenham Court Road.",
        "Michael Angelo is a commissionaire; I saw him on board the Glen\nRosa, which used to run every day from London to Clacton-on-Sea and\nback.  It gave me quite a turn when I saw him coming down the stairs\nfrom the upper deck, with his bronzed face, flattened nose, and with\nthe familiar bar upon his forehead.  I never liked Michael Angelo,\nand never shall, but I am afraid of him, and was near trying to hide\nwhen I saw him coming towards me.  He had not got his\ncommissionaire’s uniform on, and I did not know he was one till I\nmet him a month or so later in the Strand.  When we got to Blackwall\nthe music struck up and people began to dance.  I never saw a man\ndance so much in my life.  He did not miss a dance all the way to\nClacton, nor all the way back again, and when not dancing he was\nflirting and cracking jokes.  I could hardly believe my eyes when I\nreflected that this man had painted the famous “Last Judgment,” and\nhad made all those statues.",
        "Dante is, or was a year or two ago, a waiter at Brissago on the Lago\nMaggiore, only he is better-tempered-looking, and has a more\nintellectual expression.  He gave me his ideas upon beauty:  “Tutto\nch’ e vero e bello,” he exclaimed, with all his old self-confidence.\nI am not afraid of Dante.  I know people by their friends, and he\nwent about with Virgil, so I said with some severity, “No, Dante, il\nnaso della Signora Robinson e vero, ma non e bello\"; and he admitted\nI was right.  Beatrice’s name is Towler; she is waitress at a small\ninn in German Switzerland.  I used to sit at my window and hear\npeople call “Towler, Towler, Towler,” fifty times in a forenoon.\nShe was the exact antithesis to Abra; Abra, if I remember, used to\ncome before they called her name, but no matter how often they\ncalled Towler, every one came before she did.  I suppose they spelt\nher name Taula, but to me it sounded Towler; I never, however, met\nany one else with this name.  She was a sweet, artless little hussy,\nwho made me play the piano to her, and she said it was lovely.  Of\ncourse I only played my own compositions; so I believed her, and it\nall went off very nicely.  I thought it might save trouble if I did\nnot tell her who she really was, so I said nothing about it.",
        "I met Socrates once.  He was my muleteer on an excursion which I\nwill not name, for fear it should identify the man.  The moment I\nsaw my guide I knew he was somebody, but for the life of me I could\nnot remember who.  All of a sudden it flashed across me that he was\nSocrates.  He talked enough for six, but it was all in dialetto, so\nI could not understand him, nor, when I had discovered who he was,\ndid I much try to do so.  He was a good creature, a trifle given to\nstealing fruit and vegetables, but an amiable man enough.  He had\nhad a long day with his mule and me, and he only asked me five\nfrancs.  I gave him ten, for I pitied his poor old patched boots,\nand there was a meekness about him that touched me.  “And now,\nSocrates,” said I at parting, “we go on our several ways, you to\nsteal tomatoes, I to filch ideas from other people; for the rest—\nwhich of these two roads will be the better going, our father which\nis in heaven knows, but we know not.”",
        "I have never seen Mendelssohn, but there is a fresco of him on the\nterrace, or open-air dining-room, of an inn at Chiavenna.  He is not\ncalled Mendelssohn, but I knew him by his legs.  He is in the\ncostume of a dandy of some five-and-forty years ago, is smoking a\ncigar, and appears to be making an offer of marriage to his cook.\nBeethoven both my friend Mr. H. Festing Jones and I have had the\ngood fortune to meet; he is an engineer now, and does not know one\nnote from another; he has quite lost his deafness, is married, and\nis, of course, a little squat man with the same refractory hair that\nhe always had.  It was very interesting to watch him, and Jones\nremarked that before the end of dinner he had become positively\nposthumous.  One morning I was told the Beethovens were going away,\nand before long I met their two heavy boxes being carried down the\nstairs.  The boxes were so squab and like their owners, that I half\nthought for a moment that they were inside, and should hardly have\nbeen surprised to see them spring up like a couple of Jacks-in-the-\nbox.  “Sono indentro?” said I, with a frown of wonder, pointing to\nthe boxes.  The porters knew what I meant, and laughed.  But there\nis no end to the list of people whom I have been able to recognise,\nand before I had got through it myself, I found I had walked some\ndistance, and had involuntarily paused in front of a second-hand\nbookstall.",
        "I do not like books.  I believe I have the smallest library of any\nliterary man in London, and I have no wish to increase it.  I keep\nmy books at the British Museum and at Mudie’s, and it makes me very\nangry if any one gives me one for my private library.  I once heard\ntwo ladies disputing in a railway carriage as to whether one of them\nhad or had not been wasting money.  “I spent it in books,” said the\naccused, “and it’s not wasting money to buy books.”  “Indeed, my\ndear, I think it is,” was the rejoinder, and in practice I agree\nwith it.  Webster’s Dictionary, Whitaker’s Almanack, and Bradshaw’s\nRailway Guide should be sufficient for any ordinary library; it will\nbe time enough to go beyond these when the mass of useful and\nentertaining matter which they provide has been mastered.\nNevertheless, I admit that sometimes, if not particularly busy, I\nstop at a second-hand bookstall and turn over a book or two from\nmere force of habit.",
        "I know not what made me pick up a copy of AEschylus—of course in an\nEnglish version—or rather I know not what made AEschylus take up\nwith me, for he took me rather than I him; but no sooner had he got\nme than he began puzzling me, as he has done any time this forty\nyears, to know wherein his transcendent merit can be supposed to\nlie.  To me he is, like the greater number of classics in all ages\nand countries, a literary Struldbrug, rather than a true ambrosia-\nfed immortal.  There are true immortals, but they are few and far\nbetween; most classics are as great impostors dead as they were when\nliving, and while posing as gods are, five-sevenths of them, only\nStruldbrugs.  It comforts me to remember that Aristophanes liked\nAEschylus no better than I do.  True, he praises him by comparison\nwith Sophocles and Euripides, but he only does so that he may run\ndown these last more effectively.  Aristophanes is a safe man to\nfollow, nor do I see why it should not be as correct to laugh with\nhim as to pull a long face with the Greek Professors; but this is\nneither here nor there, for no one really cares about AEschylus; the\nmore interesting question is how he contrived to make so many people\nfor so many years pretend to care about him.",
        "Perhaps he married somebody’s daughter.  If a man would get hold of\nthe public ear, he must pay, marry, or fight.  I have never\nunderstood that AEschylus was a man of means, and the fighters do\nnot write poetry, so I suppose he must have married a theatrical\nmanager’s daughter, and got his plays brought out that way.  The ear\nof any age or country is like its land, air, and water; it seems\nlimitless but is really limited, and is already in the keeping of\nthose who naturally enough will have no squatting on such valuable\nproperty.  It is written and talked up to as closely as the means of\nsubsistence are bred up to by a teeming population.  There is not a\nsquare inch of it but is in private hands, and he who would freehold\nany part of it must do so by purchase, marriage, or fighting, in the\nusual way—and fighting gives the longest, safest tenure.  The\npublic itself has hardly more voice in the question who shall have\nits ear, than the land has in choosing its owners.  It is farmed as\nthose who own it think most profitable to themselves, and small\nblame to them; nevertheless, it has a residuum of mulishness which\nthe land has not, and does sometimes dispossess its tenants.  It is\nin this residuum that those who fight place their hope and trust.",
        "Or perhaps AEschylus squared the leading critics of his time.  When\none comes to think of it, he must have done so, for how is it\nconceivable that such plays should have had such runs if he had not?\nI met a lady one year in Switzerland who had some parrots that\nalways travelled with her and were the idols of her life.  These\nparrots would not let any one read aloud in their presence, unless\nthey heard their own names introduced from time to time.  If these\nwere freely interpolated into the text they would remain as still as\nstones, for they thought the reading was about themselves.  If it\nwas not about them it could not be allowed.  The leaders of\nliterature are like these parrots; they do not look at what a man\nwrites, nor if they did would they understand it much better than\nthe parrots do; but they like the sound of their own names, and if\nthese are freely interpolated in a tone they take as friendly, they\nmay even give ear to an outsider.  Otherwise they will scream him\noff if they can.",
        "I should not advise any one with ordinary independence of mind to\nattempt the public ear unless he is confident that he can out-lung\nand out-last his own generation; for if he has any force, people\nwill and ought to be on their guard against him, inasmuch as there\nis no knowing where he may not take them.  Besides, they have staked\ntheir money on the wrong men so often without suspecting it, that\nwhen there comes one whom they do suspect it would be madness not to\nbet against him.  True, he may die before he has out-screamed his\nopponents, but that has nothing to do with it.  If his scream was\nwell pitched it will sound clearer when he is dead.  We do not know\nwhat death is.  If we know so little about life which we have\nexperienced, how shall we know about death which we have not—and in\nthe nature of things never can?  Every one, as I said years ago in\n“Alps and Sanctuaries,” is an immortal to himself, for he cannot\nknow that he is dead until he is dead, and when dead how can he know\nanything about anything?  All we know is, that even the humblest\ndead may live long after all trace of the body has disappeared; we\nsee them doing it in the bodies and memories of those that come\nafter them; and not a few live so much longer and more effectually\nthan is desirable, that it has been necessary to get rid of them by\nAct of Parliament.  It is love that alone gives life, and the truest\nlife is that which we live not in ourselves but vicariously in\nothers, and with which we have no concern.  Our concern is so to\norder ourselves that we may be of the number of them that enter into\nlife—although we know it not.",
        "AEschylus did so order himself; but his life is not of that\ninspiriting kind that can be won through fighting the good fight\nonly—or being believed to have fought it.  His voice is the echo of\na drone, drone-begotten and drone-sustained.  It is not a tone that\na man must utter or die—nay, even though he die; and likely enough\nhalf the allusions and hard passages in AEschylus of which we can\nmake neither head nor tail are in reality only puffs of some of the\nliterary leaders of his time.",
        "The lady above referred to told me more about her parrots.  She was\nlike a Nasmyth’s hammer going slow—very gentle, but irresistible.\nShe always read the newspaper to them.  What was the use of having a\nnewspaper if one did not read it to one’s parrots?",
        "“And have you divined,” I asked, “to which side they incline in\npolitics?”",
        "“They do not like Mr. Gladstone,” was the somewhat freezing answer;\n“this is the only point on which we disagree, for I adore him.\nDon’t ask more about this, it is a great grief to me.  I tell them\neverything,” she continued, “and hide no secret from them.”",
        "“But can any parrot be trusted to keep a secret?”",
        "“Mine can.”",
        "“And on Sundays do you give them the same course of reading as on a\nweek-day, or do you make a difference?”",
        "“On Sundays I always read them a genealogical chapter from the Old\nor New Testament, for I can thus introduce their names without\nprofanity.  I always keep tea by me in case they should ask for it\nin the night, and I have an Etna to warm it for them; they take milk\nand sugar.  The old white-headed clergyman came to see them last\nnight; it was very painful, for Jocko reminded him so strongly of\nhis late . . . “",
        "I thought she was going to say “wife,” but it proved to have been\nonly of a parrot that he had once known and loved.",
        "One evening she was in difficulties about the quarantine, which was\nenforced that year on the Italian frontier.  The local doctor had\ngone down that morning to see the Italian doctor and arrange some\ndetails.  “Then, perhaps, my dear,” she said to her husband, “he is\nthe quarantine.”  “No, my love,” replied her husband.  “The\nquarantine is not a person, it is a place where they put people\";\nbut she would not be comforted, and suspected the quarantine as an\nenemy that might at any moment pounce out upon her and her parrots.\nSo a lady told me once that she had been in like trouble about the\nanthem.  She read in her prayer-book that in choirs and places where\nthey sing “here followeth the anthem,” yet the person with this most\nmysteriously sounding name never did follow.  They had a choir, and\nno one could say the church was not a place where they sang, for\nthey did sing—both chants and hymns.  Why, then, this persistent\nslackness on the part of the anthem, who at this juncture should\nfollow her papa, the rector, into the reading-desk?  No doubt he\nwould come some day, and then what would he be like?  Fair or dark?\nTall or short?  Would he be bald and wear spectacles like papa, or\nwould he be young and good-looking?  Anyhow, there was something\nwrong, for it was announced that he would follow, and he never did\nfollow; therefore there was no knowing what he might not do next.",
        "I heard of the parrots a year or two later as giving lessons in\nItalian to an English maid.  I do not know what their terms were.\nAlas! since then both they and their mistress have joined the\nmajority.  When the poor lady felt her end was near she desired (and\nthe responsibility for this must rest with her, not me) that the\nbirds might be destroyed, as fearing that they might come to be\nneglected, and knowing that they could never be loved again as she\nhad loved them.  On being told that all was over, she said, “Thank\nyou,” and immediately expired.",
        "Reflecting in such random fashion, and strolling with no greater\nmethod, I worked my way back through Cheapside and found myself once\nmore in front of Sweeting’s window.  Again the turtles attracted me.\nThey were alive, and so far at any rate they agreed with me.  Nay,\nthey had eyes, mouths, legs, if not arms, and feet, so there was\nmuch in which we were both of a mind, but surely they must be\nmistaken in arming themselves so very heavily.  Any creature on\ngetting what the turtle aimed at would overreach itself and be\nlanded not in safety but annihilation.  It should have no communion\nwith the outside world at all, for death could creep in wherever the\ncreature could creep out; and it must creep out somewhere if it was\nto hook on to outside things.  What death can be more absolute than\nsuch absolute isolation?  Perfect death, indeed, if it were\nattainable (which it is not), is as near perfect security as we can\nreach, but it is not the kind of security aimed at by any animal\nthat is at the pains of defending itself.  For such want to have\nthings both ways, desiring the livingness of life without its\nperils, and the safety of death without its deadness, and some of us\ndo actually get this for a considerable time, but we do not get it\nby plating ourselves with armour as the turtle does.  We tried this\nin the Middle Ages, and no longer mock ourselves with the weight of\narmour that our forefathers carried in battle.  Indeed the more\ndeadly the weapons of attack become the more we go into the fight\nslug-wise.",
        "Slugs have ridden their contempt for defensive armour as much to\ndeath as the turtles their pursuit of it.  They have hardly more\nthan skin enough to hold themselves together; they court death every\ntime they cross the road.  Yet death comes not to them more than to\nthe turtle, whose defences are so great that there is little left\ninside to be defended.  Moreover, the slugs fare best in the long\nrun, for turtles are dying out, while slugs are not, and there must\nbe millions of slugs all the world over for every single turtle.  Of\nthe two vanities, therefore, that of the slug seems most\nsubstantial.",
        "In either case the creature thinks itself safe, but is sure to be\nfound out sooner or later; nor is it easy to explain this mockery\nsave by reflecting that everything must have its meat in due season,\nand that meat can only be found for such a multitude of mouths by\ngiving everything as meat in due season to something else.  This is\nlike the Kilkenny cats, or robbing Peter to pay Paul; but it is the\nway of the world, and as every animal must contribute in kind to the\npicnic of the universe, one does not see what better arrangement\ncould be made than the providing each race with a hereditary\nfallacy, which shall in the end get it into a scrape, but which\nshall generally stand the wear and tear of life for some time.  “Do\nut des” is the writing on all flesh to him that eats it; and no\ncreature is dearer to itself than it is to some other that would\ndevour it.",
        "Nor is there any statement or proposition more invulnerable than\nliving forms are.  Propositions prey upon and are grounded upon one\nanother just like living forms.  They support one another as plants\nand animals do; they are based ultimately on credit, or faith,\nrather than the cash of irrefragable conviction.  The whole universe\nis carried on on the credit system, and if the mutual confidence on\nwhich it is based were to collapse, it must itself collapse\nimmediately.  Just or unjust, it lives by faith; it is based on\nvague and impalpable opinion that by some inscrutable process passes\ninto will and action, and is made manifest in matter and in flesh:\nit is meteoric—suspended in midair; it is the baseless fabric of a\nvision so vast, so vivid, and so gorgeous that no base can seem more\nbroad than such stupendous baselessness, and yet any man can bring\nit about his ears by being over-curious; when faith fails a system\nbased on faith fails also.",
        "Whether the universe is really a paying concern, or whether it is an\ninflated bubble that must burst sooner or later, this is another\nmatter.  If people were to demand cash payment in irrefragable\ncertainty for everything that they have taken hitherto as paper\nmoney on the credit of the bank of public opinion, is there money\nenough behind it all to stand so great a drain even on so great a\nreserve?  Probably there is not, but happily there can be no such\npanic, for even though the cultured classes may do so, the\nuncultured are too dull to have brains enough to commit such\nstupendous folly.  It takes a long course of academic training to\neducate a man up to the standard which he must reach before he can\nentertain such questions seriously, and by a merciful dispensation\nof Providence, university training is almost as costly as it is\nunprofitable.  The majority will thus be always unable to afford it,\nand will base their opinions on mother wit and current opinion\nrather than on demonstration.",
        "So I turned my steps homewards; I saw a good many more things on my\nway home, but I was told that I was not to see more this time than I\ncould get into twelve pages of the Universal Review; I must\ntherefore reserve any remark which I think might perhaps entertain\nthe reader for another occasion.",
