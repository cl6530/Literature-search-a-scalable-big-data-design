        "Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\nBingley.  He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\nalways assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\nevening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.\nIt was then disclosed in the following manner.  Observing his\nsecond daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly\naddressed her with:",
        "“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”",
        "“We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes,” said\nher mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”",
        "“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet\nhim at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce\nhim.”",
        "“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.  She has two\nnieces of her own.  She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\nhave no opinion of her.”",
        "“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that\nyou do not depend on her serving you.”",
        "Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to\ncontain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.",
        "“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake!  Have a little\ncompassion on my nerves.  You tear them to pieces.”",
        "“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she\ntimes them ill.”",
        "“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully.\n“When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”",
        "“To-morrow fortnight.”",
        "“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come\nback till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to\nintroduce him, for she will not know him herself.”",
        "“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\nintroduce Mr. Bingley to her.”",
        "“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\nwith him myself; how can you be so teasing?”",
        "“I honour your circumspection.  A fortnight’s acquaintance is\ncertainly very little.  One cannot know what a man really is by\nthe end of a fortnight.  But if we do not venture somebody else\nwill; and after all, Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their\nchance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,\nif you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”",
        "The girls stared at their father.  Mrs. Bennet said only,\n“Nonsense, nonsense!”",
        "“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried\nhe.  “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress\nthat is laid on them, as nonsense?  I cannot quite agree with\nyou there.  What say you, Mary?  For you are a young lady of\ndeep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.”",
        "Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.",
        "“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return\nto Mr. Bingley.”",
        "“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.",
        "“I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that\nbefore?  If I had known as much this morning I certainly would\nnot have called on him.  It is very unlucky; but as I have\nactually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”",
        "The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\nMrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first\ntumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\nhad expected all the while.",
        "“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!  But I knew I should\npersuade you at last.  I was sure you loved your girls too well\nto neglect such an acquaintance.  Well, how pleased I am! and it\nis such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning\nand never said a word about it till now.”",
        "“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr.\nBennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\nraptures of his wife.",
        "“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the\ndoor was shut.  “I do not know how you will ever make him\namends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter.  At our\ntime of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making\nnew acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do\nanything.  Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare\nsay Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”",
        "“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I am the\nyoungest, I’m the tallest.”",
        "The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\nwould return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they\nshould ask him to dinner.",
