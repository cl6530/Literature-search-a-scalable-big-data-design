        "It was once when Goodman and Clemens were dining together that the latter\nasked to be allowed to report the proceedings of the coming legislature\nat Carson City.  He knew nothing of such work, and Goodman hesitated.\nThen, remembering that Clemens would, at least, make his reports\nreadable, whether they were parliamentary or not, he consented.",
        "So, at the beginning of the year (1863), Samuel Clemens undertook a new\nand interesting course in the study of human nature–the political human\nnature of the frontier.  There could have been no better school for him.\nHis wit, his satire, his phrasing had full swing–his letters, almost\nfrom the beginning, were copied as choice reading up and down the Coast.\nHe made curious blunders, at first, as to the proceedings, but his open\nconfession of ignorance in the early letters made these blunders their\nchief charm.  A young man named Gillespie, clerk of the House, coached\nhim, and in return was christened “Young Jefferson’s Manual,” a title\nwhich he bore for many years.",
        "A reporter named Rice, on a rival Virginia City paper, the “Union,” also\nearned for himself a title through those early letters.",
        "Rice concluded to poke fun at the “Enterprise” reports, pointing out\ntheir mistakes.  But this was not wise.  Clemens, in his next\ncontribution, admitted that Rice’s reports might be parliamentary enough,\nbut declared his glittering technicalities were only to cover\nmisstatements of fact.  He vowed they were wholly untrustworthy, dubbed\nthe author of them “The Unreliable,” and never thereafter referred to him\nby any other term.  Carson and the Comstock papers delighted in this\nfoolery, and Rice became “The Unreliable” for life.  There was no real\nfeeling between Rice and Clemens.  They were always the best of friends.",
        "But now we arrive at the story of still another name, one of vastly\ngreater importance than either of those mentioned, for it is the name\nchosen by Samuel Clemens for himself.  In those days it was the fashion\nfor a writer to have a pen-name, especially for his journalistic and\nhumorous work.  Clemens felt that his “Enterprise” letters, copied up and\ndown the Coast, needed a mark of identity.",
        "He gave the matter a good deal of thought.  He wanted something brief and\nstrong–something that would stick in the mind.  It was just at this time\nthat news came of the death of Capt. Isaiah Sellers, the old pilot who\nhad signed himself “Mark Twain.”   Mark Twain!  That was the name he\nwanted.  It was not trivial.  It had all the desired qualities.  Captain\nSellers would never need it again.  It would do no harm to keep it alive-\n-to give it a new meaning in a new land.  Clemens took a trip from Carson\nup to Virginia City.",
        "“Joe,” he said to Goodman, “I want to sign my articles.  I want to be\nidentified to a wider audience.”",
        "“All right, Sam.  What name do you want to use Josh?”",
        "“No, I want to sign them Mark Twain.  It is an old river term, a\nleadsman’s call, signifying two fathoms–twelve feet.  It has a richness\nabout it; it was always a pleasant sound for a pilot to hear on a dark\nnight; it meant safe waters.”",
        "He did not mention that Captain Sellers had used and dropped the name.\nHe was not proud of his part in that episode, and it was too recent for\nconfession.",
        "Goodman considered a moment.  “Very well, Sam,” he said, “that sounds\nlike a good name.”",
        "A good name, indeed!  Probably, if he had considered every combination of\nwords in the language, he could not have found a better one.  To-day we\nrecognize it as the greatest nom de plume ever chosen, and, somehow, we\ncannot believe that the writer of “Tom Sawyer” and “Huck Finn” and\n“Roughing It” could have selected any other had he tried.",
        "The name Mark Twain was first signed to a Carson letter, February 2,\n1863, and after that to all of Samuel Clemens’s work.  The letters that\nhad amused so many readers had taken on a new interest–the interest that\ngoes with a name.  It became immediately more than a pen-name.  Clemens\nfound he had attached a name to himself as well as to his letters.\nEverybody began to address him as Mark.  Within a few weeks he was no\nlonger “Sam” or “Clemens,” but Mark–Mark Twain.  The Coast papers liked\nthe sound of it.  It began to mean something to their readers.  By the\nend of that legislative session Samuel Clemens, as Mark Twain, had\nacquired out there on that breezy Western slope something resembling\nfame.",
        "Curiously, he fails to mention any of this success in his letters home of\nthat period.  Indeed, he seldom refers to his work, but more often speaks\nof mining shares which he has accumulated, and their possible values.\nHis letters are airy, full of the joy of life and of the wild doings of\nthe frontier.  Closing one of them, he says: “I have just heard five\npistolshots down the street.  As such things are in my line, I will go\nand see about it.”",
        "And in a postscript, later, he adds:",
        "“5 A.M.–The pistol-shots did their work well.  One man, a Jackson\n     County Missourian, shot two of my friends (police officers) through\n     the heart–both died within three minutes.  The murderer’s name is\n     John Campbell.”",
        "The Comstock was a great school for Mark Twain, and in “Roughing It” he\nhas left us a faithful picture of its long-vanished glory.",
        "More than one national character came out of the Comstock school.\nSenator James G. Fair was one of them, and John Mackay, both miners with\npick and shovel at first, though Mackay presently became a\nsuperintendent.  Mark Twain one day laughingly offered to trade jobs with\nMackay.",
        "“No,” Mackay said, “I can’t trade.  My business is not worth as much as\nyours.  I have never swindled anybody, and I don’t intend to begin now.”",
        "For both these men the future held splendid gifts: for Mackay vast\nwealth, for Mark Twain the world’s applause, and neither would have long\nto wait.",
