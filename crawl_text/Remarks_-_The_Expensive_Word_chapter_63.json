        "Much that is annoying in this life is occasioned by the use of a high\npriced word where a cheaper one would do. In these days of failure,\nshortage at both ends and financial stringency generally, I often wonder\nthat some people should go on, day after day, using just as extravagant\nlanguage as they did during the flush times. When I get hard up the first\nthing I do is to economize in my expressions in every day conversation. If\nthere is a marked stringency in business, I lay aside first, my French,\nthen my Latin, and finally my German. Should the times become greatly\ndepressed and failures and assignments become frequent, I begin to lop off\nthe large words in my own language, beginning with “incomprehensibility,\"\n“unconstitutionally,” etc., etc.",
        "Julius Caesar’s motto used to be, “Avoid an unusual word as you would a\nrock at sea,” and Jule was right about it, too. Large and unusual words,\nespecially in the mouths of ignorant people, are worse than “Rough on\nRats” in a boarding-house pie.",
        "Years ago there used to be a pompous cuss in southern Wisconsin, who was a\nself-made man. Extremely so. Those who used to hear him assert again and\nagain that he was a self-made man always felt renewed confidence in the\nCreator.",
        "He rose one evening in a political meeting, and swelling out his bosom, as\nhis eagle eye rested on the chairman, he said:",
        "“Mr. Cheerman! I move you that the cheer do appoint a committee of three\nto attend to the matter under discussion, and that sayed committee be\nclothed by the cheer with ominiscient and omnipotent powers.”",
        "The motion was duly seconded and the cheerman said he guessed that it\nwouldn’t be necessary to put it to a vote.",
        "“I guess it will be all right, Mr. Pinkham. I guess there’ll be no\ndeclivity to that.”",
        "And so the committee was appointed and clothed with omniscient and\nomnipotent powers, there being no declivity to it.",
        "We had a self-made lawyer at one time in the northern part of the State\nwho would rather find a seventy-five cent word and use it in a speech\nwhere it did not belong than to eat a good square meal. He was more fatal\nto the King’s English than O’Dynamite Rossa. One day he was telling how\nmethodical one of the county officials was.",
        "“Why,” said he, “I never saw a man do so much and do it so easy. But the\nsecret of it is plain enough. You see, he has a regular rotunda of\nbusiness every day.”",
        "If he meant anything, I suppose he meant a routine of business, but a man\nwould have to be a mind reader to follow him some days when he had about\nsix fingers of cough medicine aboard and began to paw around in the dark\nand musty garret of his memory for moth-eaten words that didn’t mean\nanything.",
        "A neighbor of mine went to Washington during the Guiteau trial and has\nbeen telling us about it ever since. He is one of those people who don’t\nwant to be close and stingy about what they know. He likes to go through\nlife shedding information right and left. He likes to get a crowd around\nhim and then tell how he was in Washington at the time of the “post\nmortise examination.” “Boys, you may talk all your a mind to, but the\ngreatest thing I saw in Washington,” said he, “was Dr. Mary Walker on the\nstreet every morning riding one of these philosophers.”",
        "He painted the top of his fence green, last year, so it would “kind of\ncombinate with his blinds.”",
        "If he would make his big words “combinate” with what he means a little\nbetter, he would not attract so much attention. But he don’t care. He\nhates to see a big, fat word loafing around with nothing to do, so he\nthrows one in occasionally for exercise, I guess.",
        "In the Minnesota legislature, in 1867, they had under discussion a bill to\nincrease the per diem of members from three dollars to five dollars. A\nmember of the lower house, who voted for the measure, was hauled over the\ncoals by one of his constituents and charged with corruption in no\nunmeasured terms. To all this the legislator calmly answered that when he\ngot down to the capital and found out the awful price of board, he\nconcluded that his “per diadem” ought to be increased, and so he supported\nthe measure. Then the belligerent constituent said:",
        "“I beg your pardon and acquit you of all charges of corruption, for a\nlegislator who does not know the difference between a crown of glory and\nthe price of a day’s work is too big a blankety blanked fool to be\nconvicted of an intentional wrong.”",
