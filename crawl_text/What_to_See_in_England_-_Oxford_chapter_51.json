        "Oxford was a centre of learning in the time of Alfred. Walter de Merton\nfounded the first college there, and others started the collegiate\nsystem of corporate colleges which makes English universities unique.\nThe most celebrated colleges are Christ Church, Magdalen, New College,\nand Merton. Keble, Mansfield, and Hertford were established in Victorian\ntimes. In one part of the High Street the scene is architecturally\nmagnificent. On the south side is University College, which claims the\noldest foundation, although the present building only dates from the\nseventeenth century. Opposite is Queen’s College, then comes All Souls’.\nOn the same side is St. Mary’s Church, and a little further All Souls’\nChurch. A turning by St. Mary’s Church leads to the Bodleian Library,\nthe Sheldonian Theatre, and the Ashmolean Museum. At one end of St.\nGiles’ Street is the Martyrs’ Memorial and the Taylor Institution.\nReturning to High Street, and going towards the stations, a turning on\nthe left leads to Oriel, Corpus Christi, and Merton Colleges, and still\nfurther on, St. Aldate’s Street, on the left, leads to Pembroke College\nand the fourteenth-century church of St. Aldate’s. Opposite the church\nare the buildings known as Christ Church, which has the Cathedral Church\nof St. Frideswide for its chapel. In the principal entrance is “Great\nTom,” the famous bell that tolls at 9.5 P.M. Christ Church, though the\nsmallest cathedral in England, and possibly in Europe, is of great\ninterest on account of its very distinct transitional style. Magdalen\nCollege, near the bridge over the River Cherwell, and the Botanic\nGardens, are at the other end of the High Street.",
        "There was a monastery in Oxford in the eighth century. A castle was\nbuilt by William I. after he captured the town, and from that time it\nwas often visited by English kings. Several parliaments have been held\nthere, and the courts of law as well as the parliament removed to Oxford\nduring the plague of 1665. Charles I. made it his headquarters until\nFairfax took the town.",
