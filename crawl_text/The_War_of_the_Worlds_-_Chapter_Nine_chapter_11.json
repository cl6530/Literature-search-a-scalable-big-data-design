        "\n   Saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense.  It\nwas a day of lassitude too, hot and close, with, I am told, a\nrapidly fluctuating barometer.  I had slept but little, though\nmy wife had succeeded in sleeping, and I rose early.  I went\ninto my garden before breakfast and stood listening, but\ntowards the common there was nothing stirring but a lark.",
        "The milkman came as usual.  I heard the rattle of his\nchariot and I went round to the side gate to ask the latest\nnews.  He told me that during the night the Martians had\nbeen surrounded by troops, and that guns were expected.\nThen--a familiar, reassuring note--I heard a train running\ntowards Woking.",
        "“They aren’t to be killed,” said the milkman, “if that can\npossibly be avoided.”",
        "I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a\ntime, and then strolled in to breakfast.  It was a most un-\nexceptional morning.  My neighbour was of opinion that the\ntroops would be able to capture or to destroy the Martians\nduring the day.",
        "“It’s a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,” he\nsaid.  “It would be curious to know how they live on another\nplanet; we might learn a thing or two.”",
        "He came up to the fence and extended a handful of straw-\nberries, for his gardening was as generous as it was enthusi-\nastic.  At the same time he told me of the burning of the pine\nwoods about the Byfleet Golf Links.",
        "“They say,” said he, “that there’s another of those blessed\nthings fallen there--number two.  But one’s enough, surely.\nThis lot’ll cost the insurance people a pretty penny before\neverything’s settled.”  He laughed with an air of the greatest\ngood humour as he said this.  The woods, he said, were still\nburning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to me.  “They will\nbe hot under foot for days, on account of the thick soil of\npine needles and turf,” he said, and then grew serious over\n“poor Ogilvy.”",
        "After breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk\ndown towards the common.  Under the railway bridge I found\na group of soldiers--sappers, I think, men in small round\ncaps, dirty red jackets unbuttoned, and showing their blue\nshirts, dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf.  They told\nme no one was allowed over the canal, and, looking along the\nroad towards the bridge, I saw one of the Cardigan men\nstanding sentinel there.  I talked with these soldiers for a\ntime; I told them of my sight of the Martians on the previous\nevening.  None of them had seen the Martians, and they had\nbut the vaguest ideas of them, so that they plied me with\nquestions.  They said that they did not know who had\nauthorised the movements of the troops; their idea was that\na dispute had arisen at the Horse Guards.  The ordinary\nsapper is a great deal better educated than the common\nsoldier, and they discussed the peculiar conditions of the\npossible fight with some acuteness.  I described the Heat-Ray\nto them, and they began to argue among themselves.",
        "“Crawl up under cover and rush ’em, say I,” said one.",
        "“Get aht!,” said another.  “What’s cover against this ’ere\n’eat?  Sticks to cook yer!  What we got to do is to go as near\nas the ground’ll let us, and then drive a trench.”",
        "“Blow yer trenches!  You always want trenches; you ought\nto ha” been born a rabbit Snippy.”",
        "“’Ain’t they got any necks, then?” said a third, abruptly--\na little, contemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe.",
        "I repeated my description.",
        "“Octopuses,” said he, “that’s what I calls ’em.  Talk about\nfishers of men--fighters of fish it is this time!”",
        "“It ain’t no murder killing beasts like that,” said the first\nspeaker.",
        "“Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish ’em?\"\nsaid the little dark man.  “You carn tell what they might do.”",
        "“Where’s your shells?” said the first speaker.  “There ain’t\nno time.  Do it in a rush, that’s my tip, and do it at once.”",
        "So they discussed it.  After a while I left them, and went\non to the railway station to get as many morning papers as\nI could.",
        " But I will not weary the reader with a description of that\nlong morning and of the longer afternoon.  I did not succeed\nin getting a glimpse of the common, for even Horsell and\nChobham church towers were in the hands of the military\nauthorities.  The soldiers I addressed didn’t know anything;\nthe officers were mysterious as well as busy.  I found people\nin the town quite secure again in the presence of the military,\nand I heard for the first time from Marshall, the tobacconist,\nthat his son was among the dead on the common.  The soldiers\nhad made the people on the outskirts of Horsell lock up and\nleave their houses.",
        "I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have\nsaid, the day was extremely hot and dull; and in order to\nrefresh myself I took a cold bath in the afternoon.  About half\npast four I went up to the railway station to get an evening\npaper, for the morning papers had contained only a very\ninaccurate description of the killing of Stent, Henderson,\nOgilvy, and the others.  But there was little I didn’t know.\nThe Martians did not show an inch of themselves.  They\nseemed busy in their pit, and there was a sound of hammering\nand an almost continuous streamer of smoke.  Apparently they\nwere busy getting ready for a struggle.  “Fresh attempts have\nbeen made to signal, but without success,” was the stereo-\ntyped formula of the papers.  A sapper told me it was done by\na man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole.  The Martians\ntook as much notice of such advances as we should of the\nlowing of a cow.",
        "I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this\npreparation, greatly excited me.  My imagination became bel-\nligerent, and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways;\nsomething of my schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism\ncame back.  It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at that time.\nThey seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs.",
        "About three o’clock there began the thud of a gun at\nmeasured intervals from Chertsey or Addlestone.  I learned\nthat the smouldering pine wood into which the second cylin-\nder had fallen was being shelled, in the hope of destroying\nthat object before it opened.  It was only about five, however,\nthat a field gun reached Chobham for use against the first\nbody of Martians.",
        "About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in\nthe summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was\nlowering upon us, I heard a muffled detonation from the\ncommon, and immediately after a gust of firing.  Close on\nthe heels of that came a violent rattling crash, quite close\nto us, that shook the ground; and, starting out upon the lawn,\nI saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental College burst\ninto smoky red flame, and the tower of the little church beside\nit slide down into ruin.  The pinnacle of the mosque had\nvanished, and the roof line of the college itself looked as if\na hundred-ton gun had been at work upon it.  One of our\nchimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it, flew, and a piece\nof it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap of\nbroken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study\nwindow.",
        "I and my wife stood amazed.  Then I realised that the crest\nof Maybury Hill must be within range of the Martians” Heat-\nRay now that the college was cleared out of the way.",
        "At that I gripped my wife’s arm, and without ceremony\nran her out into the road.  Then I fetched out the servant,\ntelling her I would go upstairs myself for the box she was\nclamouring for.",
        "“We can’t possibly stay here,” I said; and as I spoke the\nfiring reopened for a moment upon the common.",
        "“But where are we to go?” said my wife in terror.",
        "I thought perplexed.  Then I remembered her cousins at\nLeatherhead.",
        "“Leatherhead!” I shouted above the sudden noise.",
        "She looked away from me downhill.  The people were\ncoming out of their houses, astonished.",
        "“How are we to get to Leatherhead?” she said.",
        "Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the\nrailway bridge; three galloped through the open gates of\nthe Oriental College; two others dismounted, and began\nrunning from house to house.  The sun, shining through the\nsmoke that drove up from the tops of the trees, seemed blood\nred, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything.",
        "“Stop here,” said I; “you are safe here\"; and I started off\nat once for the Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a\nhorse and dog cart.  I ran, for I perceived that in a moment\neveryone upon this side of the hill would be moving.  I found\nhim in his bar, quite unaware of what was going on behind\nhis house.  A man stood with his back to me, talking to him.",
        "“I must have a pound,” said the landlord, “and I’ve no\none to drive it.”",
        "“I’ll give you two,” said I, over the stranger’s shoulder.",
        "“What for?”",
        "“And I’ll bring it back by midnight,” I said.",
        "“Lord!” said the landlord; “what’s the hurry?  I’m selling\nmy bit of a pig.  Two pounds, and you bring it back?  What’s\ngoing on now?”",
        "I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so\nsecured the dog cart.  At the time it did not seem to me nearly\nso urgent that the landlord should leave his.  I took care to\nhave the cart there and then, drove it off down the road, and,\nleaving it in charge of my wife and servant, rushed into my\nhouse and packed a few valuables, such plate as we had, and\nso forth.  The beech trees below the house were burning while\nI did this, and the palings up the road glowed red.  While I\nwas occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came\nrunning up.  He was going from house to house, warning peo-\nple to leave.  He was going on as I came out of my front\ndoor, lugging my treasures, done up in a tablecloth.  I shouted\nafter him:",
        "“What news?”",
        "He turned, stared, bawled something about “crawling out\nin a thing like a dish cover,” and ran on to the gate of the\nhouse at the crest.  A sudden whirl of black smoke driving\nacross the road hid him for a moment.  I ran to my neighbour’s\ndoor and rapped to satisfy myself of what I already knew, that\nhis wife had gone to London with him and had locked up\ntheir house.  I went in again, according to my promise, to get\nmy servant’s box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the\ntail of the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped\nup into the driver’s seat beside my wife.  In another moment\nwe were clear of the smoke and noise, and spanking down the\nopposite slope of Maybury Hill towards Old Woking.",
        "In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead\non either side of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its\nswinging sign.  I saw the doctor’s cart ahead of me.  At the\nbottom of the hill I turned my head to look at the hillside I\nwas leaving.  Thick streamers of black smoke shot with threads\nof red fire were driving up into the still air, and throwing\ndark shadows upon the green treetops eastward.  The smoke\nalready extended far away to the east and west--to the By-\nfleet pine woods eastward, and to Woking on the west.  The\nroad was dotted with people running towards us.  And very\nfaint now, but very distinct through the hot, quiet air, one\nheard the whirr of a machine-gun that was presently stilled,\nand an intermittent cracking of rifles.  Apparently the Mar-\ntians were setting fire to everything within range of their\nHeat-Ray.",
        "I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn\nmy attention to the horse.  When I looked back again the\nsecond hill had hidden the black smoke.  I slashed the horse\nwith the whip, and gave him a loose rein until Woking and\nSend lay between us and that quivering tumult.  I overtook\nand passed the doctor between Woking and Send.",
