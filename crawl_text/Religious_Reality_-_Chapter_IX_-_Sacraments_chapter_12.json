        "It is sometimes asked whether the sacraments of the Christian Church\nare two or more than two in number. The answer depends in part upon\nhow the term “sacrament” is defined. But the wisest teaching is that\nwhich recognizes in particular sacraments–such as Baptism and the\nSupper of the Lord–the operation of a general principle which runs\nthroughout all human experience, in things both sacred and profane. “I\nhave no soul,” remarked a well-known preacher on a famous occasion, “I\nhave no soul, because I am a soul: I have a body.” It would be\ndifficult to express more aptly the principle of sacraments, or–what\ncomes to the same thing–the true relationship of the material to the\nspiritual order.",
        "We are accustomed, in the world as we know it, to distinguish “spirit\"\nfrom “matter”: and we are tempted, by the mere fact that we draw a\ndistinction between them, to think and speak at times as though spirit\nand matter were necessarily opposed. This is a great mistake. Matter,\nso far from being the opposite or the contradiction of spirit, is the\nmedium of its expression, the vehicle of its manifestation. Spirit and\nmatter are correlatives, but the ultimate reality of the world is\nspiritual. It is the whole purpose and function of matter to express,\nto embody, to incarnate, the Spirit. The preacher, therefore, was\nquite right. “I am a soul”: that is, I am a personality, a spirit:\nand to say that is to give expression to the fundamental truth of my\nexistence: I am a soul, and I am not a body. But “I have a\nbody”: that is, my personality is embodied or incarnate: I have a body\nwhich serves as the vehicle or instrument of my life as a man here\nupon earth: a body which is the organ of my spirit’s self-expression\nand the medium both of my life’s experience and of my intercourse with\nother men. I think, and my thoughts are mediated by movements of the\nbrain. I speak, and the movements of my vocal chords set up vibrations\nand sound-waves which, impinging upon the nerves of another’s ear,\naffect in turn another’s brain: and the process, regarded from the\npoint of view of the physiologist or the scientific observer, is a\nphysical process through and through: yet it mediates from my mindto the mind of him who hears me a meaning which is wholly spiritual.",
        "This principle of the mediation of the spiritual by the material is\nthe principle of sacramentalism. It is the principle of incarnation,\nwhich runs throughout the world. The body is in this sense the\nsacrament of the spirit, sound is the sacrament of speech, and\nlanguage the sacrament of thought. So in like manner water is the\nsacrament of cleansing, hands laid upon a man’s head are the sacrament\nof authority or of benediction, food and drink are the sacrament of\nlife. All life and all experience are in a true sense sacramental, the\ninward ever seeking to reveal itself in and through the outward, the\noutward deriving its whole significance from the fact that it\nexpresses and mediates the spirit: so it is that a gesture–a bow or a\nsalute–may be a sacrament of politeness, a handshake the sacrament of\ngreeting and of friendship, the beauty of nature a sacrament of the\ncelestial beauty, the world a sacrament of GOD.",
        "It is in the light of this general principle of sacraments that the\nspecific sacraments of Christianity are to be understood. In Baptism\nthe water of an outward washing is the sacrament both of initiation\ninto a spiritual society, and also of the cleansing and regenerating\npower of GOD. In Confirmation the Church’s outward benediction, of\nwhich the Bishop is the minister, is the sacrament of an inward gift\nof spiritual strength. In Absolution words outwardly pronounced by\nhuman lips are a sacrament of Divine forgiveness and a pledge to\nassure us thereof. In the Eucharist the outward elements of food and\ndrink are the sacramental embodiment of Christ and the vehicles of His\noutpoured life. Other sacraments, or rites commonly reckoned\nsacramental, we need not here particularly consider. [Footnote:\nMatrimony and Holy Orders are discussed in different connexions\nelsewhere in this book. The sacrament of Unction, by which is meant\nthe Anointing of the Sick with oil in the name of the Lord with a view\nto their recovery (to be distinguished from the mediaeval and modern\nRoman use of “Extreme Unction” as a preparation for death), has been\nrevived sporadically within the Church of England in recent times, but\nis not usually for the plain man of more than academic importance or\ninterest.]",
        "Baptism and Confirmation\nBaptism is the sacrament of Christian initiation, whereby a man is\nmade visibly a member of the Christian fellowship. Converts were\noriginally baptized in adult life, as they are to-day in the mission\nfield. The candidate publicly renounced his heathen past and made a\nprofession of his faith in Christ and his desire to be loyal to His\nChurch. As a sinner in need of redemption he went down into the water,\nand was three times immersed in the Name of the Father, and of the\nSon, and of the Holy Ghost. The rite conveyed an assurance of the\nforgiveness of sins. The going down into the water symbolized the\nburial of the dead past. The coming up out of the water expressed the\nidea of resurrection to newness of life in Christ. The new-made\nChristian was said to be born again of water and of the Spirit: the\n“old Adam” was slain, the “new man” raised up. The candidate was\nhenceforward a “member of Christ,” a “child of GOD,” an “inheritor of\nthe Kingdom of Heaven.” He was admitted both to the privileges and to\nthe responsibilities of Church membership. It remained only that he\nshould walk worthily of his Christian profession, and to this end\nhands were laid upon his head in benediction, with prayer that he\nmight be made strong by the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit.\nConfirmation was thus the complement of Baptism, and the two things\nnormally went together. The same order is still commonly observed to-\nday in the case of persons baptized in adult life, and has the\nadvantage of making the significance of both rites, and their mutual\nrelation, at once more vivid and more intelligible.",
        "But the question arose, in the second Christian generation, of the\nstatus of children in relation to the Church. Might children be\nadmitted to membership in infancy, or must they wait until they were\nadult? The Church decided that they were admissible, provided there\nwere reasonable assurance that they would be Christianly brought up.\nWhy should a child grow up in heathenism? Had not the Lord said,\n“Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not”?\nThere seemed no reason why children should not be brought at once\nwithin the sphere of Christian regeneration.",
        "But if children were baptized in infancy, it was plainly essential\nthat they should at a later stage receive systematic instruction in\nChristian faith and practice; and the Western Church (though not the\nEastern) adopted the practice of separating Confirmation from Baptism,\nand deferring the former until such instruction had been received. The\nplan has obvious advantages, though it tends to obscure in some\nrespects the essential meaning of Confirmation and its original close\nrelation to the sacrament of Baptism.",
        "In modern usage Baptism is normally administered by a priest,\nConfirmation always by a Bishop. Candidates are received by the latter\nupon the assurance of one of his subordinate clergy that they are\nadequately instructed and rightly disposed by faith and penitence to\nreceive the gifts of the Holy Ghost–\"the spirit of wisdom and\nunderstanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of\nknowledge and of the fear of the Lord.” As an immediate preliminary to\nthe actual rite the candidate solemnly and deliberately declares his\nacceptance of the obligations and implications of his baptism. The\nlaying on of hands which follows is in one aspect the recognition by\nthe Bishop, as chief pastor of the flock of Christ in his own diocese,\nthat the candidate is henceforward of communicant status. In another\naspect it is the bestowal through prayer of a fuller gift of the Holy\nGhost, whereby the candidate is “confirmed” (_i.e. made strong). It\nshould be noted that the Bishop’s prayer for each candidate is not\nthat he may be made magically perfect there and then, but that he may\n“daily increase” in GOD’S Holy Spirit “more and more,” until he come\nto GOD’S “everlasting Kingdom.”",
        "The Sacrament of Repentance\nIt must be admitted that very large numbers of those who are confirmed\nlapse at an early stage in their lives from the communion of the\nChurch and never return. The causes of this are various, and there is\nno one sovereign or universal remedy. Sometimes it is to be feared\nthat there has been either lack of intelligence or lack of\nthoroughness in the candidates’ preparation. In not a few cases what\nhas really happened is that the young communicant has been led into\nthe commission of some sin of a kind which his own conscience\nrecognizes as grave, so that he feels that he has spoilt his record\nand failed to “live up to” his profession. To go back to communion, he\nthinks, would in these circumstances be a kind of mockery.\nUnfortunately he does not know–since too often he has not been\ntaught–any effectual method of spiritual recovery and renewal.",
        "What is needed in such cases is a real doctrine and practice of\nChristian repentance. It is the universal teaching of the Christian\nChurch that forgiveness is freely available for all those who truly\nrepent. A man who, laying aside self-justification, will freely\nacknowledge his offences and shortcomings before GOD, and that in a\nspirit not of self-pity, self-loathing or self-contempt, but of sorrow\nat having brought discredit upon the Christian name and done what in\nhim lies to crucify the Son of GOD afresh, may freely claim and find\nin Christ forgiveness and inward peace.",
        "This Gospel or message of the forgiveness of sins it is part of the\nmission of the Christian Church to set forth. It is her mission to set\nit forth not merely as a piece of good news proclaimed in general\nterms to the world at large, but as a healing assurance brought home\nin detail, as need may require, to the individual consciences of\nsinners. “Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and\nwhosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.” The words may have\nbeen uttered by the historical Jesus of Nazareth, or they may not–\nthey are ascribed to the risen Christ in the Fourth Gospel. In any\nevent they represent the Church’s conviction of her authority to\nexercise a reconciling ministry, to remit sins and to retain them.",
        "In early times such grave offenders as by their deeds had brought\nscandal upon the Christian name were excluded from Christian\nfellowship until reconciled by penance; and many whose sins, being\nsecret, might otherwise have escaped detection, preferred to make open\nconfession of them in the Christian assembly. “Confess your faults one\nto another,” writes S. James, “and pray one for another, that ye may\nbe healed.” The ancient system of public “penance” (_i.e. penitence)\nwas for a time at least revived in a modern form by Wesley.[Footnote:\nThe “class-meeting” of strict Wesleyanism is said to have originally\ninvolved mutual confession of sins among the members of the “class.\"]\nIts application to notorious offenders is described in the English\nPrayer-book as a “godly discipline,” the restoration of which is “much\nto be wished.” But it is hardly practicable under the conditions of\nmodern Church life, and it has disadvantages as well as advantages.\nIts working in the early days of the Church was not found to be wholly\nfor good.",
        "Burdened consciences nevertheless require relief: and sin is not\nmerely a private affair between the soul and GOD; it is also an\noffence against the Brotherhood. A system grew up under which the need\nwas met by the substitution, in the majority of cases, of private for\npublic penance. Confession was made, no longer before the whole\nassembly, but privately before the Bishop, whose office it was, both\nas pastor of the flock and as representative of the Church, to declare\nforgiveness or “absolution,” and to restore penitents to communion. At\na later date presbyters or priests were also authorized, as delegates\nof the Bishop for this and other purposes, to receive confessions and\nto absolve penitents.",
        "In this way arose in the Church what came to be known as the sacrament\nof Penance, or the practice of sacramental confession. It was ranked\nas a sacrament for the reason that the inward assurance of GOD’S\npardon is in this connexion outwardly mediated by words of Absolution\naudibly pronounced. In medieval times there grew up a regular system\nof the confessional and an elaborate science of the guidance and\ndirection of souls. Recourse to sacramental confession was made\nobligatory for all Christians at least once in the year. [Footnote:\nThis is still the formal rule of the Church of Rome.] The system came\nto be attended by many superstitions and abuses, frequently it was\nexploited in the interests of a corrupt sacerdotalism, sometimes it\nwas associated with a degrading casuistry.",
        "But the confessional met and meets a real human need; and while\nProtestantism, as a whole, broke away at the time of the Reformation\nin a violent reaction from the whole theory and practice of\nsacramental confession, the Church of England quite deliberately\nretained it. It was abolished as a compulsory obligation. It was made\nless prominent in the Church’s system. But as a means of spiritual\nreconciliation and spiritual guidance, freely open to such as for any\nreason desire to make use of it, it was retained; and in the case of\npersons who for reasons of conscience hesitate to present themselves\nfor Holy Communion it is specifically urged in the Book of Common\nPrayer as the needed remedy. [Footnote: See the closing paragraph of\nthe first of the three lengthy exhortations to Holy Communion, printed\nimmediately after the “Prayer for the Church Militant” in the Prayer-\nbook.]The words of S. John xx. 23 are quoted in the Anglican formula\nof ordination to the priesthood; and a form of words to be used by the\npriest in the private absolution of penitents is prescribed in the\nOffice for the Visitation of the Sick.",
        "As regards the theory of the confessional it is important to bear\ncertain things in mind. The confession is made primarily to GOD,\nsecondarily to His Church. The priest is the Church’s accredited\ndelegate and representative. He acts not in virtue of any magical\npowers inherent in himself, either as an individual or as a member of\nany so-called sacerdotal caste. If he declares the penitent absolved\nit is as pastor of the flock, and as one officially authorized by the\nChurch to be her mouthpiece for these purposes. The ultimate absolving\nauthority, under GOD, is the Christian Society as a whole. It is a\nconfessor’s duty to assure himself of the reality of the penitent’s\ncontrition, and to enjoin that restitution or amends shall be made for\nany wrong which has been done, in all cases in which amends or\nrestitution is possible. He may also give advice and counsel for the\nguidance of the spiritual life; and it is customary to enjoin the\nperformance of a “penance,” which in modern practice usually takes the\nform of some minor spiritual exercise of a more or less remedial kind.\nThe acceptance of the penance is regarded as an enacted symbol of\nsubmission to the Church’s judgment. (The mediaeval theory that the\npenance is of the nature of a punishment or penalty imposed by the\nChurch upon her erring members ought, I think, to be repudiated. It is\nperhaps permissible to differ from the moral theology of Borne in\nholding that it is not essential to impose a penance at all, while\nrecognizing the value in most cases of suggesting some definite act of\nself-discipline or observance, of a kind adapted to the penitent’s\ncircumstances and needs). The confessor is, of course, bound in the\nstrictest way not to reveal anything said to him in confession, or to\nbroach the subject again to the penitent without the latter’s express\npermission, or to allow his subsequent manner or behaviour to be\ninfluenced in any the least degree by what has been confessed.",
        "It is highly unfortunate that the practice of sacramental confession\nshould have been made the subject of controversy, and as a consequence\nof this that the Church’s teaching with regard to it should have been\neither unhealthily suppressed or obtruded out of season. There are\nwithout doubt numerous cases in which such a spiritual remedy is badly\nneeded. There are burdened souls needing absolution and there are\nperplexed souls needing guidance. What is desirable is that the actual\nteaching of the Church of England on this subject should be plainly\nand frankly set before her members, and that opportunities should be\nafforded them of making their confessions if they desire or need to do\nso. It is the plain duty of a parish priest to provide such\nopportunities for his people. He is as plainly going beyond his duty\nif he tries to enforce the practice of sacramental confession as a\nnecessary obligation. There are differences of opinion as to how\nwidespread is the spiritual need to which confession ministers. There\nare reasons for thinking that it is more widespread than is commonly\nrecognized. But it is of vital importance that no one should be\npressed or brow-beaten into going to confession, or should do so, in\nany circumstances, otherwise than by his own voluntary act.",
        "The Sacrament of Holy Communion\nThroughout Christian history and in all parts of Christendom the\ncentral and highest focus of Christian worship and devotion, and the\ngreat normal vivifying channel of spiritual renewal and power, has\nbeen the sacrament of Holy Communion. It has been celebrated amid\ngreat diversities of liturgy and ritual and circumstance, and has been\nknown by many different names and titles–mass, eucharist, communion,\nsacrifice: essentially it is one thing–the sacrament of the Body and\nBlood of Christ.",
        "The Gospels record that at the Last Supper on the night of His\nbetrayal the Lord Jesus took bread and blessed and broke it, saying,\n“Take, eat: this is My Body, which is for you: do this in remembrance\nof Me”: and that in like manner He took a Cup of mingled wine and\nwater, and when He had given thanks He gave it to them, saying, “This\nCup is the New Covenant in My Blood, which is shed for you and for\nmany for the remission of sins: do this, as often as ye shall drink\nit, in remembrance of Me.”",
        "With the exceptions of the Society of Friends and the Salvation Army,\nevery existing “denomination” of Christians has continued in one form\nor another the observance of this Mystical Meal. In the Roman Church,\nand in many parishes of the Church of England, it is celebrated daily;\nand it is evident from the provisions of her Prayer-book that the\nChurch of England intends that there shall be a celebration of the\nCommunion in all normal parishes at least on all Sundays and Holy\nDays.",
        "Historically the institution of the weekly Eucharist is deeply rooted\nin the tradition of the Church, and is the origin of the Christian\nSunday, The Christians met together week by week to keep on the day of\nthe Lord’s rising that memorial of the crucified yet risen Christ\nwhich is also Christ’s gift of Himself to men. It would have seemed\nunthinkable in the early days of Christianity for any baptized\nChristian, who was not prevented by unavoidable circumstances from\nbeing present, to be absent on the Lord’s Day from the Lord’s Table.\nIt ought to be equally unthinkable to-day.",
        "With regard to the significance of the Sacrament, a man’s view is\nnecessarily coloured partly by his own experience as a communicant,\nand partly by the extent to which he is disposed to attach weight to\nthe devotional traditions of Christendom as a whole; and it is worth\nremembering that forms of teaching about Holy Communion which are\nintellectually crude may represent a real, though an infelicitous,\nattempt to express in thought certain elements in eucharistic\nexperience which are deep and real, and to which more attenuated types\nof doctrine fail to do justice.",
        "The celebration of the Eucharist is from one point of view an enacted\ndrama, a doing over again in the name and in the person of Christ of\nthat which Christ did in His own person on the night of the Last\nSupper. Bread is taken and blessed and broken and offered to GOD in\nthanksgiving: Wine in like manner is poured out and blessed and\noffered together with the Bread. And the Bread and the Wine symbolize\nthe Body and the Blood of Christ–the Body that was broken and the\nBlood that was shed–the life that was freely given for the life of\nthe world.",
        "The whole drama of the Eucharist is thus deeply symbolical; but the\nBread and the Wine are more than mere symbols in the modern sense of\nthat word. They are a sacrament of Christ Himself, who by means of\nthem manifests His presence in the midst of His worshipping disciples\nto be the Bread of life and the Food of souls. “This is My Body\"–that\nis, “This embodies Me: where this is, I am: receiving this, you\nreceive Me.” “This is My Blood\"–that is, “This is My life: My life\nwhich is given for you: My life which in death I laid down and in\nrising again from the dead I resumed: My life which is to be the\nprinciple of spiritual life in you.” “Except ye eat the flesh of the\nSon of Man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth\nMy flesh and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life.... He that eateth\nMy flesh and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me and I in him.”",
        "There is, then, in the communion of the Body and Blood of Christ a\nmanifestation of Christ’s Real Presence, a spiritual Presence indeed,\nwhich is discerned by the spiritual vision of Christian faith, but a\nPresence of which the reality is independent of individual\nfaithlessness, though not independent of the faith of the Christian\nChurch as a whole.",
        "This doctrine of the Real Presence (as it is called) of course does\nnot imply that Christ is absent from His Church at other times or in\nother connexions. We believe that all times and places are present to\nthe mind of Christ, and that therefore at all times and in all places\nwe are in His presence. We believe, further, that Christ through the\nSpirit is embodied, however inadequately, in His Church, and that He\ndwells spiritually in the hearts of Christian men. There is nothing,\nhowever, in these truths to exclude the further truth that His\npresence is specially manifested through the Bread which embodies Him\nand the Wine which is His Blood. Bread and wine, solemnly set apart\nfor the purpose of communion and hallowed by the Spirit in response to\nthe prayer of the Church, possess henceforward a significance which\ndid not belong to them before. They are now vehicles or sacraments of\nthe Body and Blood of Christ.",
        "The purpose of the manifestation of Christ’s Presence in Holy\nCommunion is that we should receive Him, and a participation in the\nservice which stops short of actual communion is so far incomplete.\nBut it is gratuitous to assume that the reality of the sacramental\nPresence is limited to the moment of actual or individual reception,\nand it is untrue to say that attendance at the service, apart from\nindividual reception, is unmeaning. The habitual attendance of persons\nwho are not regular communicants–unless it be in the case of those\nwho for any reason are as yet unconfirmed–falls short of full\ndiscipleship and is intrinsically undesirable. But this objection does\nnot apply to attendance at the service on the part of communicant\nChurchmen who yet on a particular occasion do not communicate: and to\nattend throughout the service without personally communicating is a\nprocedure infinitely preferable to the irreverent modern custom, still\nprevalent in too many parishes, of leaving the Church in the course of\na celebration of the Communion, and before the consecration has taken\nplace. It is unfair to those who are preparing to receive Communion\nthat their devotions should be disturbed by the noisy egress of a\nlarge body of worshippers. It is also quite unintelligible that any\nChurchman who considers seriously the meaning of the Eucharist should\nbe content to depart before the liturgical drama has reached its\nclimax.",
        "As regards actual reception of Holy Communion, it is a partaking of\nChrist, who gives Himself therein to His disciples to be in them a\nspiritual principle of life and power. S. Paul discovers in the\nEucharist a spiritual food and drink which is the reality to which the\nManna and the Water from the Rock of Hebrew story correspond as types\nand shadows, and he declares that the Bread which we break is a\nsharing of the Body of Christ, and that the Cup of Blessing which we\nbless is a sharing of His Blood. At the same time the Communion is not\nto be interpreted in any gross or carnal manner, or in such a way as\nto give colour to the ancient taunt of Celsus, the heathen critic,\nthat Christians were self-confessed cannibals. The Fourth Gospel,\nwhich, in a context that is in a general sense eucharistic, ascribes\nto our Lord strong phrases about the necessity of eating His flesh and\ndrinking His blood, proceeds in the same context to explain that “it\nis the Spirit that giveth life,” that “the flesh,” in itself,\n“profiteth nothing.” “The sayings which I have spoken unto you are\nspirit and are life.” In other words, we are to understand that when\nour Lord uses the terms “flesh” and “blood” He means the Spirit of\nwhich His life in the flesh was the expression, and the Life of which\nHis outpoured Blood was the principle: that the inward reality of the\nEucharist is to be discovered, not in any quasi-material fleshly\nembodiment which the Bread conceals, or in any quasi-literal Blood,\nbut rather in the Spirit and the Life of Christ Himself. The Bread is\nHis Body in the sense that it is an embodiment of His Spirit: the Wine\nis His Blood in the sense that it mediates His Life. The sacrament is\nto be understood as a “point of personal contact with Jesus Christ.\"\nRightly to receive Communion is to hold spiritual converse with the\nrisen Lord and to find in Him the Bread of Life, the food and\nsustenance of the soul. So it is that the Eucharist, at once supremely\nnatural and wholly supernatural, is the meeting-place of earth and\nheaven. From one point of view our worship is in the heavenly places\nin Christ Jesus. It is “with angels and archangels and with all the\ncompany of heaven,” that we laud and magnify GOD’S Holy Name. We join\nin an eternal act of worship, which is that of the whole Church, the\ndeparted with the living, whose adoration ascends continually before\nthe throne of GOD.",
        "If we like to express it so, we are pleading the eternal sacrifice: we\nare uniting ourselves, in desire and in intention, with Christ’s\neternal self-devotion and oblation of Himself. Calvary itself was in a\nsense but the enacted symbol, the supreme outward expression, of our\nLord’s sacrifice, of which the inward essence is eternal. It is the\nself-offering of a Will that was wholly dedicated to GOD on others’\nbehalf, obedient even unto death, and through death triumphant: the\nWill of One “who through the Eternal Spirit offered Himself without\nspot to GOD,” and who now, being ascended into the heavens, for ever\nliveth to make intercession for us. Looking at the Eucharist from this\npoint of view we are bold to approach the Throne of GOD and to offer\nChrist on our behalf–\"Behold the Lamb of GOD that taketh away the sin\nof the world”: but we proceed also to offer ourselves in Christ–\"Here\nwe offer and present unto Thee, O Lord, ourselves, our souls and\nbodies, to be a reasonable, holy and lively sacrifice unto Thee.”",
        "And so doing we are made one with Christ and one in Him with each\nother. The Eucharist has a social aspect which is too little regarded.\nIt is the sacrament of Holy Fellowship. “We that are many are one\nBread, one Body,” wrote S. Paul, “for we all partake of the one\nBread.” The Holy Communion is the sacrament of the unity of all\nChristians in Christ. The scandal of a divided Christendom shows\nitself perhaps most of all in the fact that it prevents inter-\ncommunion. For that very reason it appears to many persons unreal, and\ntherefore wrong, to practise isolated acts of inter-communion while\necclesiastical differences remain unresolved: it is to conceal the\nfact of actual disunion beneath the cloak of immediate sentiment. Yet\nthere is a true sense in which, through the Spirit, we are, in the\nact of communion, made one with the fellowship of all faithful people\nwhether in the sphere of this earthly life or in the world that is\nbeyond death and tears: with all those, of whatever race or rank or\nage or country, who amid whatever diversity of language and liturgy\nand denominational loyalty, have named the name of Christ and received\nthe life of Christ in obedience to His command as they understood it.\nThere is no bond comparable to this bond, and no equality like the\nequality of those who, high and low, rich and poor, one with another,\nkneel side by side as brothers and sisters at the common Table of the\nLord.",
        "And lastly there is a further point. The Body of Christ is a broken\nBody and the Blood is Blood that is shed. “This is My Body which is\nfor you\"–for you, and never for Myself. The Bread is the Bread of\nSacrifice and the Cup is the Stirrup-cup of Service: and part, surely,\nand a great part, of the meaning of the words, “Do this in remembrance\nof Me,” is “Break your bodies in union with My Body broken: give your\nlives in sacrifice for others, as I have given Mine.” The Eucharist,\nrightly regarded, is the mainspring and motive-power of service, the\nprinciple of a life that is crucified. And all those who in their day\nand generation have spent their lives unselfishly and used themselves\nup in promoting causes not their own are partakers in that Holy\nFellowship.",
        "At this present time of war and tumult, when all the powers of Hell\nare abroad and leagued together for the onset, we think of that which\nalone can be the redemption of war, even the self-devotion of those\nwho, hating the whole devilish business and going into it only because\nthey saw no alternative to Duty’s clear and imperative call, have been\ncounted worthy to show forth the love than which no man hath greater,\neven to lay down their lives for their friends. There is no one so\nunfortunate as not to have known some such men. And at the Communion\nService “in the act of conscious incorporation into the fellowship of\nthe love of Jesus,” it may be given to us in some measure to\nunderstand these things, and to know that we are become partakers in\nthe power of a world-wide crucifixion, a fellowship of broken bodies\nand lives poured out in Christ: and to know also–with a knowledge\nthat is not of this world–that somehow, in it and through it, the\nSpirit of GOD in Christ will bring redemption.",
        "So wonderful, so many-sided, and so full of meaning is this Sacrament:\nso great is the measure of their loss who, professing and calling\nthemselves Christians, are content to ignore the last injunction of\nthe Christ to His disciples on the night before He died that we might\nlive.",
