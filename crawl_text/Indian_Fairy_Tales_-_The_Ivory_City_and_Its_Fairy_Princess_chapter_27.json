        "One day a young prince was out practising archery with the son of his\nfather’s chief vizier, when one of the arrows accidentally struck the\nwife of a merchant, who was walking about in an upper room of a house\nclose by. The prince aimed at a bird that was perched on the window-\nsill of that room, and had not the slightest idea that anybody was at\nhand, or he would not have shot in that direction. Consequently, not\nknowing what had happened, he and the vizier’s son walked away, the\nvizier’s son chaffing him because he had missed the bird.",
        "Presently the merchant went to ask his wife about something, and found\nher lying, to all appearance, dead in the middle of the room, and an\narrow fixed in the ground within half a yard of her head. Supposing\nthat she was dead, he rushed to the window and shrieked, “Thieves\nthieves! They have killed my wife.” The neighbours quickly gathered,\nand the servants came running upstairs to see what was the matter. It\nhappened that the woman had fainted, and that there was only a very\nslight wound in her breast where the arrow had grazed.",
        "As soon as the woman recovered her senses she told them that two young\nmen had passed by the place with their bows and arrows, and that one of\nthem had most deliberately aimed at her as she stood by the window.",
        "On hearing this the merchant went to the king, and told him what had\ntaken place. His Majesty was much enraged at such audacious wickedness,\nand swore that most terrible punishment should be visited on the\noffender if he could be discovered. He ordered the merchant to go back\nand ascertain whether his wife could recognise the young men if she saw\nthem again.",
        "“Oh yes,” replied the woman, “I should know them again among all the\npeople in the city.”",
        "“Then,” said the king, when the merchant brought back this reply, “to-\nmorrow I will cause all the male inhabitants of this city to pass\nbefore your house, and your wife will stand at the window and watch for\nthe man who did this wanton deed.”",
        "A royal proclamation was issued to this effect. So the next day all the\nmen and boys of the city, from the age of ten years upwards, assembled\nand marched by the house of the merchant. By chance (for they both had\nbeen excused from obeying this order) the king’s son and the vizier’s\nson were also in the company, and passed by in the crowd. They came to\nsee the tamasha.",
        "As soon as these two appeared in front of the merchant’s window they\nwere recognised by the merchant’s wife, and at once reported to the\nking.",
        "“My own son and the son of my chief vizier!” exclaimed the king, who\nhad been present from the commencement. “What examples for the people!\nLet them both be executed.”",
        "“Not so, your Majesty,” said the vizier, “I beseech you Let the facts\nof the case be thoroughly investigated. How is it?” he continued,\nturning to the two young men. “Why have you done this cruel thing?”",
        "“I shot an arrow at a bird that was sitting on the sill of an open\nwindow in yonder house, and missed,” answered the prince. “I suppose\nthe arrow struck the merchant’s wife. Had I known that she or anybody\nhad been near I should not have shot in that direction.”",
        "“We will speak of this later on,” said the king, on hearing this\nanswer. “Dismiss the people. Their presence is no longer needed.”",
        "In the evening his Majesty and the vizier had a long and earnest talk\nabout their two sons. The king wished both of them to be executed; but\nthe vizier suggested that the prince should be banished from the\ncountry. This was finally agreed to.",
        "Accordingly, on the following morning, a little company of soldiers\nescorted the prince out of the city. When they reached the last custom-\nhouse the vizier’s son overtook them. He had come with all haste,\nbringing with him four bags of muhrs on four horses. “I am come,” he\nsaid, throwing his arms round the prince’s neck, “because I cannot let\nyou go alone. We have lived together, we will be exiled together, and\nwe will die together. Turn me not back, if you love me.”",
        "“Consider,” the prince answered, “what you are doing. All kinds of\ntrial may be before me. Why should you leave your home and country to\nbe with me?”",
        "“Because I love you,” he said, “and shall never be happy without you.”",
        "So the two friends walked along hand in hand as fast as they could to\nget out of the country, and behind them marched the soldiers and the\nhorses with their valuable burdens. On reaching a place on the borders\nof the king’s dominions the prince gave the soldiers some gold, and\nordered them to return. The soldiers took the money and left; they did\nnot, however, go very far, but hid themselves behind rocks and stones,\nand waited till they were quite sure that the prince did not intend to\ncome back.",
        "On and on the exiles walked, till they arrived at a certain village,\nwhere they determined to spend the night under one of the big trees of\nthe place. The prince made preparations for a fire, and arranged the\nfew articles of bedding that they had with them, while the vizier’s son\nwent to the baniya and the baker and the butcher to get something for\ntheir dinner. For some reason he was delayed; perhaps the tsut was not\nquite ready, or the baniya had not got all the spices prepared. After\nwaiting half an hour the prince became impatient, and rose up and\nwalked about.",
        "He saw a pretty, clear little brook running along not far from their\nresting-place, and hearing that its source was not far distant, he\nstarted off to find it. The source was a beautiful lake, which at that\ntime was covered with the magnificent lotus flower and other water\nplants. The prince sat down on the bank, and being thirsty took up some\nof the water in his hand. Fortunately he looked into his hand before\ndrinking, and there, to his great astonishment, he saw reflected whole\nand clear the image of a beautiful fairy. He looked round, hoping to\nsee the reality; but seeing no person, he drank the water, and put out\nhis hand to take some more. Again he saw the reflection in the water\nwhich was in his palm. He looked around as before, and this time\ndiscovered a fairy sitting by the bank on the opposite side of the\nlake. On seeing her he fell so madly in love with her that he dropped\ndown in a swoon.",
        "When the vizier’s son returned, and found the fire lighted, the horses\nsecurely fastened, and the bags of muhrs lying altogether in a heap,\nbut no prince, he did not know what to think. He waited a little while,\nand then shouted; but not getting any reply, he got up and went to the\nbrook. There he came across the footmarks of his friend. Seeing these,\nhe went back at once for the money and the horses, and bringing them\nwith him, he tracked the prince to the lake, where he found him lying\nto all appearance dead.",
        "“Alas! alas!” he cried, and lifting up the prince, he poured some water\nover his head and face. “Alas! my brother, what is this? Oh! do not die\nand leave me thus. Speak, speak! I cannot bear this!”",
        "In a few minutes the prince, revived by the water, opened his eyes, and\nlooked about wildly.",
        "“Thank God!” exclaimed the vizier’s son. “But what is the matter,\nbrother?”",
        "“Go away,” replied the prince. “I don’t want to say anything to you, or\nto see you. Go away.”",
        "“Come, come; let us leave this place. Look, I have brought some food\nfor you, and horses, and everything. Let us eat and depart.”",
        "“Go alone,” replied the prince.",
        "“Never,” said the vizier’s son. “What has happened to suddenly estrange\nyou from me? A little while ago we were brethren, but now you detest\nthe sight of me.”",
        "“I have looked upon a fairy,” the prince said. “But a moment I saw her\nface; for when she noticed that I was looking at her she covered her\nface with lotus petals. Oh, how beautiful she was! And while I gazed\nshe took out of her bosom an ivory box, and held it up to me. Then I\nfainted. Oh! if you can get me that fairy for my wife, I will go\nanywhere with you.”",
        "“Oh, brother,” said the vizier’s son, “you have indeed seen a fairy.\nShe is a fairy of the fairies. This is none other than Gulizar of the\nIvory City. I know this from the signs that she gave you. From her\ncovering her face with lotus petals I learn her name, and from her\nshowing you the ivory box I learn where she lives. Be patient, and rest\nassured that I will arrange your marriage with her.”",
        "When the prince heard these encouraging words he felt much comforted,\nrose up, and ate, and then went away gladly with his friend.",
        "On the way they met two men. These two men belonged to a family of\nrobbers. There were eleven of them altogether. One, an elder sister,\nstayed at home and cooked the food, and the other ten–all brothers–\nwent out, two and two, and walked about the four different ways that\nran through that part of the country, robbing those travellers who\ncould not resist them, and inviting others, who were too powerful for\ntwo of them to manage, to come and rest at their house, where the whole\nfamily attacked them and stole their goods. These thieves lived in a\nkind of tower, which had several strong-rooms in it, and under it was a\ngreat pit, wherein they threw the corpses of the poor unfortunates who\nchanced to fall into their power.",
        "The two men came forward, and, politely accosting them, begged them to\ncome and stay at their house for the night. “It is late,” they said,\n“and there is not another village within several miles.”",
        "“Shall we accept this good man’s invitation, brother?” asked the\nprince.",
        "The vizier’s son frowned slightly in token of disapproval; but the\nprince was tired, and thinking that it was only a whim of his friend’s,\nhe said to the men, “Very well. It is very kind of you to ask us.”",
        "So they all four went to the robbers’ tower.",
        "Seated in a room, with the door fastened on the outside, the two\ntravellers bemoaned their fate.",
        "“It is no good groaning,” said the vizier’s son. “I will climb to the\nwindow, and see whether there are any means of escape. Yes! yes!” he\nwhispered, when he had reached the window-hole. “Below there is a ditch\nsurrounded by a high wall. I will jump down and reconnoitre. You stay\nhere, and wait till I return.”",
        "Presently he came back and told the prince that he had seen a most ugly\nwoman, whom he supposed was the robbers’ housekeeper. She had agreed to\nrelease them on the promise of her marriage with the prince.",
        "So the woman led the way out of the enclosure by a secret door.",
        "“But where are the horses and the goods?” the vizier’s son inquired.",
        "“You cannot bring them,” the woman said. “To go out by any other way\nwould be to thrust oneself into the grave.”",
        "“All right, then; they also shall go out by this door. I have a charm,\nwhereby I can make them thin or fat.” So the vizier’s son fetched the\nhorses without any person knowing it, and repeating the charm, he made\nthem pass through the narrow doorway like pieces of cloth, and when\nthey were all outside restored them to their former condition. He at\nonce mounted his horse and laid hold of the halter of one of the other\nhorses, and then beckoning to the prince to do likewise, he rode off.\nThe prince saw his opportunity, and in a moment was riding after him,\nhaving the woman behind him.",
        "Now the robbers heard the galloping of the horses, and ran out and shot\ntheir arrows at the prince and his companions. And one of the arrows\nkilled the woman, so they had to leave her behind.",
        "On, on they rode, until they reached a village where they stayed the\nnight. The following morning they were off again, and asked for Ivory\nCity from every passer-by. At length they came to this famous city, and\nput up at a little hut that belonged to an old woman, from whom they\nfeared no harm, and with whom, therefore, they could abide in peace and\ncomfort. At first the old woman did not like the idea of these\ntravellers staying in her house, but the sight of a muhr, which the\nprince dropped in the bottom of a cup in which she had given him water,\nand a present of another muhr from the vizier’s son, quickly made her\nchange her mind. She agreed to let them stay there for a few days.",
        "As soon as her work was over the old woman came and sat down with her\nlodgers. The vizier’s son pretended to be utterly ignorant of the place\nand people. “Has this city a name?” he asked the old woman.",
        "“Of course it has, you stupid. Every little village, much more a city,\nand such a city as this, has a name.”",
        "“What is the name of this city?”",
        "“Ivory City. Don’t you know that? I thought the name was known all over\nthe world.”",
        "On the mention of the name Ivory City the prince gave a deep sigh. The\nvizier’s son looked as much as to say “Keep quiet, or you’ll discover\nthe secret.”",
        "“Is there a king of this country?” continued the vizier’s son.",
        "“Of course there is, and a queen, and a princess.”",
        "“What are their names?”",
        "“The name of the princess is Gulizar, and the name of the queen––”",
        "The vizier’s son interrupted the old woman by turning to look at the\nprince, who was staring like a madman. “Yes,” he said to him\nafterwards, “we are in the right country. We shall see the beautiful\nprincess.”",
        "One morning the two travellers noticed the old woman’s most careful\ntoilette: how careful she was in the arrangement of her hair and the\nset of her kasabah and puts.",
        "“Who is coming?” said the vizier’s son.",
        "“Nobody,” the old woman replied.",
        "“Then where are you going?”",
        "“I am going to see my daughter, who is a servant of the Princess\nGulizar. I see her and the princess every day. I should have gone\nyesterday, if you had not been here and taken up all my time.”",
        "“Ah-h-h! Be careful not to say anything about us in the hearing of the\nprincess.” The vizier’s son asked her not to speak about them at the\npalace, hoping that, because she had been told not to do so, she would\nmention their arrival, and thus the princess would be informed of their\ncoming.",
        "On seeing her mother the girl pretended to be very angry. “Why have you\nnot been for two days?” she asked.",
        "“Because, my dear,” the old woman answered, “two young travellers, a\nprince and the son of some great vizier, have taken up their abode in\nmy hut, and demand so much of my attention. It is nothing but cooking\nand cleaning, and cleaning and cooking, all day long. I can’t\nunderstand the men,” she added; “one of them especially appears very\nstupid. He asked me the name of this country and the name of the\nking. Now where can these men have come from, that they do not know\nthese things? However, they are very great and very rich. They each\ngive me a muhr every morning and every evening.”",
        "After this the old woman went and repeated almost the same words to the\nprincess, on the hearing of which the princess beat her severely; and\nthreatened her with a severer punishment if she ever again spoke of the\nstrangers before her.",
        "In the evening, when the old woman had returned to her hut, she told\nthe vizier’s son how sorry she was that she could not help breaking her\npromise, and how the princess had struck her because she mentioned\ntheir coming and all about them.",
        "“Alas! alas!” said the prince, who had eagerly listened to every word.\n“What, then, will be her anger at the sight of a man?”",
        "“Anger?” said the vizier’s son, with an astonished air. “She would be\nexceedingly glad to see one man. I know this. In this treatment of the\nold woman I see her request that you will go and see her during the\ncoming dark fortnight.”",
        "“Heaven be praised!” the prince exclaimed.",
        "The next time the old woman went to the palace Gulizar called one of\nher servants and ordered her to rush into the room while she was\nconversing with the old woman; and if the old woman asked what was the\nmatter, she was to say that the king’s elephants had gone mad, and were\nrushing about the city and bazaar in every direction, and destroying\neverything in their way.",
        "The servant obeyed, and the old woman, fearing lest the elephants\nshould go and push down her hut and kill the prince and his friend,\nbegged the princess to let her depart. Now Gulizar had obtained a\ncharmed swing, that landed whoever sat on it at the place wherever they\nwished to be. “Get the swing,” she said to one of the servants standing\nby. When it was brought she bade the old woman step into it and desire\nto be at home.",
        "The old woman did so, and was at once carried through the air quickly\nand safely to her hut, where she found her two lodgers safe and sound.\n“Oh!” she cried, “I thought that both of you would be killed by this\ntime. The royal elephants have got loose and are running about wildly.\nWhen I heard this I was anxious about you. So the princess gave me this\ncharmed swing to return in. But come, let us get outside before the\nelephants arrive and batter down the place.”",
        "“Don’t believe this,” said the vizier’s son. “It is a mere hoax. They\nhave been playing tricks with you.”",
        "“You will soon have your heart’s desire,” he whispered aside to the\nprince. “These things are signs.”",
        "Two days of the dark fortnight had elapsed, when the prince and the\nvizier’s son seated themselves in the swing, and wished themselves\nwithin the grounds of the palace. In a moment they were there, and\nthere too was the object of their search standing by one of the palace\ngates, and longing to see the prince quite as much as he was longing to\nsee her.",
        "Oh, what a happy meeting it was!",
        "“At last,” said Gulizar, “I have seen my beloved, my husband.”",
        "“A thousand thanks to Heaven for bringing me to you,” said the prince.",
        "Then the prince and Gulizar betrothed themselves to one another and\nparted, the one for the hut and the other for the palace, both of them\nfeeling happier than they had ever been before.",
        "Henceforth the prince visited Gulizar every day and returned to the hut\nevery night. One morning Gulizar begged him to stay with her always.\nShe was constantly afraid of some evil happening to him–perhaps\nrobbers would slay him, or sickness attack him, and then she would be\ndeprived of him. She could not live without seeing him. The prince\nshowed her that there was no real cause for fear, and said that he felt\nhe ought to return to his friend at night, because he had left his home\nand country and risked his life for him; and, moreover, if it had not\nbeen for his friend’s help he would never have met with her.",
        "Gulizar for the time assented, but she determined in her heart to get\nrid of the vizier’s son as soon as possible. A few days after this\nconversation she ordered one of her maids to make a pilaw. She gave\nspecial directions that a certain poison was to be mixed into it while\ncooking, and as soon as it was ready the cover was to be placed on the\nsaucepan, so that the poisonous steam might not escape. When the pilaw\nwas ready she sent it at once by the hand of a servant to the vizier’s\nson with this message “Gulizar, the princess, sends you an offering in\nthe name of her dead uncle.”",
        "On receiving the present the vizier’s son thought that the prince had\nspoken gratefully of him to the princess, and therefore she had thus\nremembered him. Accordingly he sent back his salam and expressions of\nthankfulness.",
        "When it was dinner-time he took the saucepan of pilaw and went out to\neat it by the stream. Taking off the lid, he threw it aside on the\ngrass and then washed his hands. During the minute or so that he was\nperforming these ablutions, the green grass under the cover of the\nsaucepan turned quite yellow. He was astonished, and suspecting that\nthere was poison in the pilaw, he took a little and threw it to some\ncrows that were hopping about. The moment the crows ate what was thrown\nto them they fell down dead.",
        "“Heaven be praised,” exclaimed the vizier’s son, “who has preserved me\nfrom death at this time!”",
        "On the return of the prince that evening the vizier’s son was very\nreticent and depressed. The prince noticed this change in him, and\nasked what was the reason. “Is it because I am away so much at the\npalace?” The vizier’s son saw that the prince had nothing to do with\nthe sending of the pilaw, and therefore told him everything.",
        "“Look here,” he said, “in this handkerchief is some pilaw that the\nprincess sent me this morning in the name of her deceased uncle. It is\nsaturated with poison. Thank Heaven, I discovered it in time!”",
        "“Oh, brother! who could have done this thing? Who is there that\nentertains enmity against you?”",
        "“The Princess Gulizar. Listen. The next time you go to see her, I\nentreat you to take some snow with you; and just before seeing the\nprincess put a little of it into both your eyes. It will provoke tears,\nand Gulizar will ask you why you are crying. Tell her that you weep for\nthe loss of your friend, who died suddenly this morning. Look! take,\ntoo, this wine and this shovel, and when you have feigned intense grief\nat the death of your friend, bid the princess to drink a little of the\nwine. It is strong, and will immediately send her into a deep sleep.\nThen, while she is asleep, heat the shovel and mark her back with it.\nRemember to bring back the shovel again, and also to take her pearl\nnecklace. This done, return. Now fear not to execute these\ninstructions, because on the fulfilment of them depends your fortune\nand happiness. I will arrange that your marriage with the princess\nshall be accepted by the king, her father, and all the court.”",
        "The prince promised that he would do everything as the vizier’s son had\nadvised him; and he kept his promise.",
        "The following night, on the return of the prince from his visit to\nGulizar, he and the vizier’s son, taking the horses and bags of muhrs,\nwent to a graveyard about a mile or so distant. It was arranged that\nthe vizier’s son should act the part of a fakir and the prince the part\nof the fakir’s disciple and servant.",
        "In the morning, when Gulizar had returned to her senses, she felt a\nsmarting pain in her back, and noticed that her pearl necklace was\ngone. She went at once and informed the king of the loss of her\nnecklace, but said nothing to him about the pain in her back.",
        "The king was very angry when he heard of the theft, and caused\nproclamation concerning it to be made throughout all the city and\nsurrounding country.",
        "“It is well,” said the vizier’s son, when he heard of this\nproclamation. “Fear not, my brother, but go and take this necklace, and\ntry to sell it in the bazaar.”",
        "The prince took it to a goldsmith and asked him to buy it.",
        "“How much do you want for it?” asked the man.",
        "“Fifty thousand rupees,” the prince replied.",
        "“All right,” said the man; “wait here while I go and fetch the money.”",
        "The prince waited and waited, till at last the goldsmith returned, and\nwith him the kotwal, who at once took the prince into custody on the\ncharge of stealing the princess’s necklace.",
        "“How did you get the necklace?” the kotwal asked.",
        "“A fakir, whose servant I am, gave it to me to sell in the bazaar,” the\nprince replied. “Permit me, and I will show you where he is.”",
        "The prince directed the kotwal and the policeman to the place where he\nhad left the vizier’s son, and there they found the fakir with his eyes\nshut and engaged in prayer. Presently, when he had finished his\ndevotions, the kotwal asked him to explain how he had obtained\npossession of the princess’s necklace.",
        "“Call the king hither,” he replied, “and then I will tell his Majesty\nface to face.”",
        "On this some men went to the king and told him what the fakir had said.\nHis Majesty came, and seeing the fakir so solemn and earnest in his\ndevotions, he was afraid to rouse his anger, lest peradventure the\ndispleasure of Heaven should descend on him, and so he placed his hands\ntogether in the attitude of a supplicant, and asked, “How did you get\nmy daughter’s necklace?”",
        "“Last night,” replied the fakir, “we were sitting here by this tomb\nworshipping Khuda, when a ghoul, dressed as a princess, came and\nexhumed a body that had been buried a few days ago, and began to eat\nit. On seeing this I was filled with anger, and beat her back with a\nshovel, which lay on the fire at the time. While running away from me\nher necklace got loose and dropped. You wonder at these words, but they\nare not difficult to prove. Examine your daughter, and you will find\nthe marks of the burn on her back. Go, and if it is as I say, send the\nprincess to me, and I will punish her.”",
        "The king went back to the palace, and at once ordered the princess’s\nback to be examined.",
        "“It is so,” said the maid-servant; “the burn is there.”",
        "“Then let the girl be slain immediately,” the king shouted.",
        "“No, no, your Majesty,” they replied. “Let us send her to the fakir who\ndiscovered this thing, that he may do whatever he wishes with her.”",
        "The king agreed, and so the princess was taken to the graveyard.",
        "“Let her be shut up in a cage, and be kept near the grave whence she\ntook out the corpse,” said the fakir.",
        "This was done, and in a little while the fakir and his disciple and the\nprincess were left alone in the graveyard. Night had not long cast its\ndark mantle over the scene when the fakir and his disciple threw off\ntheir disguise, and taking their horses and luggage, appeared before\nthe cage. They released the princess, rubbed some ointment over the\nscars on her back, and then sat her upon one of their horses behind the\nprince. Away they rode fast and far, and by the morning were able to\nrest and talk over their plans in safety. The vizier’s son showed the\nprincess some of the poisoned pilaw that she had sent him, and asked\nwhether she had repented of her ingratitude. The princess wept, and\nacknowledged that he was her greatest helper and friend.",
        "A letter was sent to the chief vizier telling him of all that had\nhappened to the prince and the vizier’s son since they had left their\ncountry. When the vizier read the letter he went and informed the king.\nThe king caused a reply to be sent to the two exiles, in which he\nordered them not to return, but to send a letter to Gulizar’s father,\nand inform him of everything. Accordingly they did this; the prince\nwrote the letter at the vizier’s son’s dictation.",
        "On reading the letter Gulizar’s father was much enraged with his\nviziers and other officials for not discovering the presence in his\ncountry of these illustrious visitors, as he was especially anxious to\ningratiate himself in the favour of the prince and the vizier’s son. He\nordered the execution of some of the viziers on a certain date.",
        "“Come,” he wrote back to the vizier’s son, “and stay at the palace. And\nif the prince desires it, I will arrange for his marriage with Gulizar\nas soon as possible.”",
        "The prince and the vizier’s son most gladly accepted the invitation,\nand received a right noble welcome from the king. The marriage soon\ntook place, and then after a few weeks the king gave them presents of\nhorses and elephants, and jewels and rich cloths, and bade them start\nfor their own land; for he was sure that the king would now receive\nthem. The night before they left the viziers and others, whom the king\nintended to have executed as soon as his visitors had left, came and\nbesought the vizier’s son to plead for them, and promised that they\neach would give him a daughter in marriage. He agreed to do so, and\nsucceeded in obtaining their pardon.",
