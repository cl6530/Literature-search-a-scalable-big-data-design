        "“Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends.  It was\none which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding\nas it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to\none so utterly inexperienced as I was.",
        "“The name of the old man was De Lacey.  He was descended from a good\nfamily in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,\nrespected by his superiors and beloved by his equals.  His son was bred\nin the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the\nhighest distinction.  A few months before my arrival they had lived in\na large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and\npossessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or\ntaste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.",
        "“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin.  He was a\nTurkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some\nreason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. \nHe was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from\nConstantinople to join him.  He was tried and condemned to death.  The\ninjustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;\nand it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime\nalleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.",
        "“Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and\nindignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the\ncourt.  He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then\nlooked around for the means.  After many fruitless attempts to gain\nadmittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an\nunguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the\nunfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the\nexecution of the barbarous sentence.  Felix visited the grate at night\nand made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour.  The Turk,\namazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer\nby promises of reward and wealth.  Felix rejected his offers with\ncontempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit\nher father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the\nyouth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed\na treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.",
        "“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made\non the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in\nhis interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he\nshould be conveyed to a place of safety.  Felix was too delicate to\naccept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the\nevent as to the consummation of his happiness.",
        "“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for\nthe escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several\nletters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to\nexpress her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old\nman, a servant of her father who understood French.  She thanked him in\nthe most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and\nat the same time she gently deplored her own fate.",
        "“I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence\nin the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters\nwere often in the hands of Felix or Agatha.  Before I depart I will\ngive them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,\nas the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat\nthe substance of them to you.",
        "“Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a\nslave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of\nthe father of Safie, who married her.  The young girl spoke in high and\nenthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the\nbondage to which she was now reduced.  She instructed her daughter in\nthe tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of\nintellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female\nfollowers of Muhammad.  This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly\nimpressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again\nreturning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,\nallowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to\nthe temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble\nemulation for virtue.  The prospect of marrying a Christian and\nremaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in\nsociety was enchanting to her.",
        "“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night\nprevious to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant\nmany leagues from Paris.  Felix had procured passports in the name of\nhis father, sister, and himself.  He had previously communicated his\nplan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under\nthe pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in\nan obscure part of Paris.",
        "“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont\nCenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable\nopportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.",
        "“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his\ndeparture, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she\nshould be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in\nexpectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society\nof the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest\naffection.  They conversed with one another through the means of an\ninterpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie\nsang to him the divine airs of her native country.",
        "“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes\nof the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other\nplans.  He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a\nChristian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear\nlukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer\nif he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they\ninhabited.  He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled\nto prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and\nsecretly to take his daughter with him when he departed.  His plans\nwere facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.",
        "“The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their\nvictim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer.  The\nplot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were\nthrown into prison.  The news reached Felix and roused him from his\ndream of pleasure.  His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay\nin a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of\nher whom he loved.  This idea was torture to him.  He quickly arranged\nwith the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity\nfor escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a\nboarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,\nhe hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the\nlaw, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.  ",
        "“He did not succeed.  They remained confined for five months before the\ntrial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and\ncondemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.",
        "“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I\ndiscovered them.  Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for\nwhom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on\ndiscovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,\nbecame a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with\nhis daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,\nas he said, in some plan of future maintenance.",
        "“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered\nhim, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family.  He could\nhave endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his\nvirtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss\nof his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.  The\narrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.",
        "“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth\nand rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her\nlover, but to prepare to return to her native country.  The generous\nnature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to\nexpostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his\ntyrannical mandate.",
        "“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told\nher hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn\nhad been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the\nFrench government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to\nConstantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours.  He\nintended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential\nservant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his\nproperty, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.",
        "“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it\nwould become her to pursue in this emergency.  A residence in Turkey\nwas abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse\nto it.  By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she\nheard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where\nhe then resided.  She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her\ndetermination.  Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a\nsum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,\nbut who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for\nGermany.",
        "“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage\nof De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill.  Safie nursed her\nwith the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the\nArabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country\nand utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.  She fell, however,\ninto good hands.  The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for\nwhich they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in\nwhich they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at\nthe cottage of her lover.”",
