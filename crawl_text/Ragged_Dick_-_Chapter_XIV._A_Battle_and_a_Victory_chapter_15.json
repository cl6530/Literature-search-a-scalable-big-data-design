        "“What’s that for?” demanded Dick, turning round to see who had\nstruck him.",
        "“You’re gettin’ mighty fine!” said Micky Maguire, surveying Dick’s\nnew clothes with a scornful air.",
        "There was something in his words and tone, which Dick, who was\ndisposed to stand up for his dignity, did not at all relish.",
        "“Well, what’s the odds if I am?” he retorted. “Does it hurt you\nany?”",
        "“See him put on airs, Jim,” said Micky, turning to his companion.\n“Where’d you get them clo’es?”",
        "“Never mind where I got ’em. Maybe the Prince of Wales gave ’em to\nme.”",
        "“Hear him, now, Jim,” said Micky. “Most likely he stole ’em.”",
        "“Stealin’ aint in my line.”",
        "It might have been unconscious the emphasis which Dick placed on the\nword “my.” At any rate Micky chose to take offence.",
        "“Do you mean to say I steal?” he demanded, doubling up his fist,\nand advancing towards Dick in a threatening manner.",
        "“I don’t say anything about it,” answered Dick, by no means alarmed\nat this hostile demonstration. “I know you’ve been to the Island\ntwice. P’r’aps ’twas to make a visit along of the Mayor and\nAldermen. Maybe you was a innocent victim of oppression. I aint a\ngoin’ to say.”",
        "Micky’s freckled face grew red with wrath, for Dick had only stated\nthe truth.",
        "“Do you mean to insult me?” he demanded shaking the fist already\ndoubled up in Dick’s face. “Maybe you want a lickin’?”",
        "“I aint partic’larly anxious to get one,” said Dick, coolly. “They\ndon’t agree with my constitution which is nat’rally delicate. I’d\nrather have a good dinner than a lickin’ any time.”",
        "“You’re afraid,” sneered Micky. “Isn’t he, Jim?”",
        "“In course he is.”",
        "“P’r’aps I am,” said Dick, composedly, “but it don’t trouble\nme much.”",
        "“Do you want to fight?” demanded Micky, encouraged by Dick’s\nquietness, fancying he was afraid to encounter him.",
        "“No, I don’t,” said Dick. “I aint fond of fightin’. It’s a very poor\namusement, and very bad for the complexion, ’specially for the eyes\nand nose, which is apt to turn red, white, and blue.”",
        "Micky misunderstood Dick, and judged from the tenor of his speech\nthat he would be an easy victim. As he knew, Dick very seldom was\nconcerned in any street fight,–not from cowardice, as he imagined,\nbut because he had too much good sense to do so. Being quarrelsome,\nlike all bullies, and supposing that he was more than a match for\nour hero, being about two inches taller, he could no longer resist\nan inclination to assault him, and tried to plant a blow in Dick’s\nface which would have hurt him considerably if he had not drawn back\njust in time.",
        "Now, though Dick was far from quarrelsome, he was ready to defend\nhimself on all occasions, and it was too much to expect that he\nwould stand quiet and allow himself to be beaten.",
        "He dropped his blacking-box on the instant, and returned Micky’s\nblow with such good effect that the young bully staggered back, and\nwould have fallen, if he had not been propped up by his confederate,\nLimpy Jim.",
        "“Go in, Micky!” shouted the latter, who was rather a coward on his\nown account, but liked to see others fight. “Polish him off, that’s\na good feller.”",
        "Micky was now boiling over with rage and fury, and required no\nurging. He was fully determined to make a terrible example of poor\nDick. He threw himself upon him, and strove to bear him to the\nground; but Dick, avoiding a close hug, in which he might possibly\nhave got the worst of it, by an adroit movement, tripped up his\nantagonist, and stretched him on the side walk.",
        "“Hit him, Jim!” exclaimed Micky, furiously.",
        "Limpy Jim did not seem inclined to obey orders. There was a quiet\nstrength and coolness about Dick, which alarmed him. He preferred\nthat Micky should incur all the risks of battle, and accordingly set\nhimself to raising his fallen comrade.",
        "“Come, Micky,” said Dick, quietly, “you’d better give it up. I\nwouldn’t have touched you if you hadn’t hit me first. I don’t want\nto fight. It’s low business.”",
        "“You’re afraid of hurtin’ your clo’es,” said Micky, with a sneer.",
        "“Maybe I am,” said Dick. “I hope I haven’t hurt yours.”",
        "Micky’s answer to this was another attack, as violent and impetuous\nas the first. But his fury was in the way. He struck wildly, not\nmeasuring his blows, and Dick had no difficulty in turning aside, so\nthat his antagonist’s blow fell upon the empty air, and his momentum\nwas such that he nearly fell forward headlong. Dick might readily\nhave taken advantage of his unsteadiness, and knocked him down; but\nhe was not vindictive, and chose to act on the defensive, except\nwhen he could not avoid it.",
        "Recovering himself, Micky saw that Dick was a more formidable\nantagonist than he had supposed, and was meditating another assault,\nbetter planned, which by its impetuosity might bear our hero to the\nground. But there was an unlooked-for interference.",
        "“Look out for the ’copp,’” said Jim, in a low voice.",
        "Micky turned round and saw a tall policeman heading towards him, and\nthought it might be prudent to suspend hostilities. He accordingly\npicked up his black-box, and, hitching up his pants, walked off,\nattended by Limpy Jim.",
        "“What’s that chap been doing?” asked the policeman of Dick.",
        "“He was amoosin’ himself by pitchin’ into me,” replied Dick.",
        "“What for?”",
        "“He didn’t like it ’cause I patronized a different tailor from him.”",
        "“Well, it seems to me you are dressed pretty smart for a\nboot-black,” said the policeman.",
        "“I wish I wasn’t a boot-black,” said Dick.",
        "“Never mind, my lad. It’s an honest business,” said the policeman,\nwho was a sensible man and a worthy citizen. “It’s an honest\nbusiness. Stick to it till you get something better.”",
        "“I mean to,” said Dick. “It aint easy to get out of it, as the\nprisoner remarked, when he was asked how he liked his residence.”",
        "“I hope you don’t speak from experience.”",
        "“No,” said Dick; “I don’t mean to get into prison if I can\nhelp it.”",
        "“Do you see that gentleman over there?” asked the officer, pointing\nto a well-dressed man who was walking on the other side of the\nstreet.",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Well, he was once a newsboy.”",
        "“And what is he now?”",
        "“He keeps a bookstore, and is quite prosperous.”",
        "Dick looked at the gentleman with interest, wondering if he should\nlook as respectable when he was a grown man.",
        "It will be seen that Dick was getting ambitious. Hitherto he had\nthought very little of the future, but was content to get along as\nhe could, dining as well as his means would allow, and spending the\nevenings in the pit of the Old Bowery, eating peanuts between the\nacts if he was prosperous, and if unlucky supping on dry bread or\nan apple, and sleeping in an old box or a wagon. Now, for the first\ntime, he began to reflect that he could not black boots all his\nlife. In seven years he would be a man, and, since his meeting with\nFrank, he felt that he would like to be a respectable man. He could\nsee and appreciate the difference between Frank and such a boy as\nMicky Maguire, and it was not strange that he preferred the society\nof the former.",
        "In the course of the next morning, in pursuance of his new\nresolutions for the future, he called at a savings bank, and held\nout four dollars in bills besides another dollar in change. There\nwas a high railing, and a number of clerks busily writing at desks\nbehind it. Dick, never having been in a bank before, did not know\nwhere to go. He went, by mistake, to the desk where money was paid\nout.",
        "“Where’s your book?” asked the clerk.",
        "“I haven’t got any.”",
        "“Have you any money deposited here?”",
        "“No, sir, I want to leave some here.”",
        "“Then go to the next desk.”",
        "Dick followed directions, and presented himself before an elderly\nman with gray hair, who looked at him over the rims of his\nspectacles.",
        "“I want you to keep that for me,” said Dick, awkwardly emptying his\nmoney out on the desk.",
        "“How much is there?”",
        "“Five dollars.”",
        "“Have you got an account here?”",
        "“No, sir.”",
        "“Of course you can write?”",
        "The “of course” was said on account of Dick’s neat dress.",
        "“Have I got to do any writing?” asked our hero, a little\nembarrassed.",
        "“We want you to sign your name in this book,” and the old gentleman\nshoved round a large folio volume containing the names of\ndepositors.",
        "Dick surveyed the book with some awe.",
        "“I aint much on writin’,” he said.",
        "“Very well; write as well as you can.”",
        "The pen was put into Dick’s hand, and, after dipping it in the\ninkstand, he succeeded after a hard effort, accompanied by many\ncontortions of the face, in inscribing upon the book of the bank\nthe name",
        "“Dick!–that means Richard, I suppose,” said the bank officer, who\nhad some difficulty in making out the signature.",
        "“No; Ragged Dick is what folks call me.”",
        "“You don’t look very ragged.”",
        "“No, I’ve left my rags to home. They might get wore out if I used\n’em too common.”",
        "“Well, my lad, I’ll make out a book in the name of Dick Hunter,\nsince you seem to prefer Dick to Richard. I hope you will save up\nyour money and deposit more with us.”",
        "Our hero took his bank-book, and gazed on the entry “Five Dollars\"\nwith a new sense of importance. He had been accustomed to joke\nabout Erie shares, but now, for the first time, he felt himself a\ncapitalist; on a small scale, to be sure, but still it was no small\nthing for Dick to have five dollars which he could call his own. He\nfirmly determined that he would lay by every cent he could spare\nfrom his earnings towards the fund he hoped to accumulate.",
        "But Dick was too sensible not to know that there was something more\nthan money needed to win a respectable position in the world. He\nfelt that he was very ignorant. Of reading and writing he only knew\nthe rudiments, and that, with a slight acquaintance with arithmetic,\nwas all he did know of books. Dick knew he must study hard, and\nhe dreaded it. He looked upon learning as attended with greater\ndifficulties than it really possesses. But Dick had good pluck. He\nmeant to learn, nevertheless, and resolved to buy a book with his\nfirst spare earnings.",
        "When Dick went home at night he locked up his bank-book in one\nof the drawers of the bureau. It was wonderful how much more\nindependent he felt whenever he reflected upon the contents of\nthat drawer, and with what an important air of joint ownership\nhe regarded the bank building in which his small savings were\ndeposited.",
