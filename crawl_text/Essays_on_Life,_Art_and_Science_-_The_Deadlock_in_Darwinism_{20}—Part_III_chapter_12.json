        "Now let me return to the recent division of biological opinion into\ntwo main streams—Lamarckism and Weismannism Both Lamarckians and\nWeismannists, not to mention mankind in general, admit that the\nbetter adapted to its surroundings a living form may be, the more\nlikely it is to outbreed its compeers.  The world at large, again,\nneeds not to be told that the normal course is not unfrequently\ndeflected through the fortunes of war; nevertheless, according to\nLamarckians and Erasmus-Darwinians, habitual effort, guided by ever-\ngrowing intelligence—that is to say, by continued increase of power\nin the matter of knowing our likes and dislikes—has been so much\nthe main factor throughout the course of organic development, that\nthe rest, though not lost sight of, may be allowed to go without\nsaying.  According, on the other hand, to extreme Charles-Darwinians\nand Weismannists, habit, effort and intelligence acquired during the\nexperience of any one life goes for nothing.  Not even a little\nfraction of it endures to the benefit of offspring.  It dies with\nhim in whom it is acquired, and the heirs of a man’s body take no\ninterest therein.  To state this doctrine is to arouse instinctive\nloathing; it is my fortunate task to maintain that such a nightmare\nof waste and death is as baseless as it is repulsive.",
        "The split in biological opinion occasioned by the deadlock to which\nCharles-Darwinism has been reduced, though comparatively recent,\nwidens rapidly.  Ten years ago Lamarck’s name was mentioned only as\na byword for extravagance; now, we cannot take up a number of Nature\nwithout seeing how hot the contention is between his followers and\nthose of Weismann.  This must be referred, as I implied earlier, to\ngrowing perception that Mr. Darwin should either have gone farther\ntowards Lamarckism or not so far.  In admitting use and disuse as\nfreely as he did, he gave Lamarckians leverage for the overthrow of\na system based ostensibly on the accumulation of fortunate\naccidents.  In assigning the lion’s share of development to the\naccumulation of fortunate accidents, he tempted fortuitists to try\nto cut the ground from under Lamarck’s feet by denying that the\neffects of use and disuse can be inherited at all.  When the public\nhad once got to understand what Lamarck had intended, and wherein\nMr. Charles Darwin had differed from him, it became impossible for\nCharles-Darwinians to remain where they were, nor is it easy to see\nwhat course was open to them except to cast about for a theory by\nwhich they could get rid of use and disuse altogether.  Weismannism,\ntherefore, is the inevitable outcome of the straits to which\nCharles-Darwinians were reduced through the way in which their\nleader had halted between two opinions.",
        "This is why Charles-Darwinians, from Professor Huxley downwards,\nhave kept the difference between Lamarck’s opinions and those of Mr.\nDarwin so much in the background.  Unwillingness to make this\nunderstood is nowhere manifested more clearly than in Dr. Francis\nDarwin’s life of his father.  In this work Lamarck is sneered at\nonce or twice, and told to go away, but there is no attempt to state\nthe two cases side by side; from which, as from not a little else, I\nconclude that Dr. Francis Darwin has descended from his father with\nsingularly little modification.",
        "Proceeding to the evidence for the transmissions of acquired habits,\nI will quote two recently adduced examples from among the many that\nhave been credibly attested.  The first was contributed to Nature\n(March 14, 1889) by Professor Marcus M. Hartog, who wrote:-",
        "“A. B. is moderately myopic and very astigmatic in the left eye;\nextremely myopic in the right.  As the left eye gave such bad images\nfor near objects, he was compelled in childhood to mask it, and\nacquired the habit of leaning his head on his left arm for writing,\nso as to blind that eye, or of resting the left temple and eye on\nthe hand, with the elbow on the table.  At the age of fifteen the\neyes were equalised by the use of suitable spectacles, and he soon\nlost the habit completely and permanently.  He is now the father of\ntwo children, a boy and a girl, whose vision (tested repeatedly and\nfully) is emmetropic in both eyes, so that they have not inherited\nthe congenital optical defect of their father.  All the same, they\nhave both of them inherited his early acquired habit, and need\nconstant watchfulness to prevent their hiding the left eye when\nwriting, by resting the head on the left forearm or hand.  Imitation\nis here quite out of the question.",
        "“Considering that every habit involves changes in the proportional\ndevelopment of the muscular and osseous systems, and hence probably\nof the nervous system also, the importance of inherited habits,\nnatural or acquired, cannot be overlooked in the general theory of\ninheritance.  I am fully aware that I shall be accused of flat\nLamarckism, but a nickname is not an argument.”",
        "To this Professor Ray Lankester rejoined (Nature, March 21, 1889):-",
        "“It is not unusual for children to rest the head on the left forearm\nor hand when writing, and I doubt whether much value can be attached\nto the case described by Professor Hartog.  The kind of observation\nwhich his letter suggests is, however, likely to lead to results\neither for or against the transmission of acquired characters.  An\nold friend of mine lost his right arm when a schoolboy, and has ever\nsince written with his left.  He has a large family and\ngrandchildren, but I have not heard of any of them showing a\ndisposition to left-handedness.”",
        "From Nature (March 21, 1889) I take the second instance communicated\nby Mr. J. Jenner-Weir, who wrote as follows:-",
        "“Mr. Marcus M. Hartog’s letter of March 6th, inserted in last week’s\nnumber (p. 462), is a very valuable contribution to the growing\nevidence that acquired characters may be inherited.  I have long\nheld the view that such is often the case, and I have myself\nobserved several instances of the, at least I may say, apparent\nfact.",
        "“Many years ago there was a very fine male of the Capra megaceros in\nthe gardens of the Zoological Society.  To restrain this animal from\njumping over the fence of the enclosure in which he was confined, a\nlong, and heavy chain was attached to the collar round his neck.  He\nwas constantly in the habit of taking this chain up by his horns and\nmoving it from one side to another over his back; in doing this he\nthrew his head very much back, his horns being placed in a line with\nthe back.  The habit had become quite chronic with him, and was very\ntiresome to look at.  I was very much astonished to observe that his\noffspring inherited the habit, and although it was not necessary to\nattach a chain to their necks, I have often seen a young male\nthrowing his horns over his back and shifting from side to side an\nimaginary chain.  The action was exactly the same as that of his\nancestor.  The case of the kid of this goat appears to me to be\nparallel to that of child and parent given by Mr. Hartog.  I think\nat the time I made this observation I informed Mr. Darwin of the\nfact by letter, and he did not accuse me of ’flat Lamarckism.’”",
        "To this letter there was no rejoinder.  It may be said, of course,\nthat the action of the offspring in each of these cases was due to\naccidental coincidence only.  Anything can be said, but the question\nturns not on what an advocate can say, but on what a reasonably\nintelligent and disinterested jury will believe; granted they might\nbe mistaken in accepting the foregoing stories, but the world of\nscience, like that of commerce, is based on the faith or confidence,\nwhich both creates and sustains them.  Indeed the universe itself is\nbut the creature of faith, for assuredly we know of no other\nfoundation.  There is nothing so generally and reasonably accepted—\nnot even our own continued identity—but questions may be raised\nabout it that will shortly prove unanswerable.  We cannot so test\nevery sixpence given us in change as to be sure that we never take a\nbad one, and had better sometimes be cheated than reduce caution to\nan absurdity.  Moreover, we have seen from the evidence given in my\npreceding article that the germ-cells issuing from a parent’s body\ncan, and do, respond to profound impressions made on the somatic-\ncells.  This being so, what impressions are more profound, what\nneeds engage more assiduous attention than those connected with\nself-protection, the procuring of food, and the continuation of the\nspecies?  If the mere anxiety connected with an ill-healing wound\ninflicted on but one generation is sometimes found to have so\nimpressed the germ-cells that they hand down its scars to offspring,\nhow much more shall not anxieties that have directed action of all\nkinds from birth till death, not in one generation only but in a\nlonger series of generations than the mind can realise to itself,\nmodify, and indeed control, the organisation of every species?",
        "I see Professor S. H. Vines, in the article on Weismann’s theory\nreferred to in my preceding article, says Mr. Darwin “held that it\nwas not the sudden variations due to altered external conditions\nwhich become permanent, but those slowly produced by what he termed\n’the accumulative action of changed conditions of life.’”  Nothing\ncan be more soundly Lamarckian, and nothing should more conclusively\nshow that, whatever else Mr. Darwin was, he was not a Charles-\nDarwinian; but what evidence other than inferential can from the\nnature of the case be adduced in support of this, as I believe,\nperfectly correct judgment?  None know better than they who clamour\nfor direct evidence that their master was right in taking the\nposition assigned to him by Professor Vines, that they cannot\nreasonably look for it.  With us, as with themselves, modification\nproceeds very gradually, and it violates our principles as much as\ntheir own to expect visible permanent progress, in any single\ngeneration, or indeed in any number of generations of wild species\nwhich we have yet had time to observe.  Occasionally we can find\nsuch cases, as in that of Branchipus stagnalis, quoted by Mr.\nWallace, or in that of the New Zealand Kea whose skin, I was assured\nby the late Sir Julius von Haast, has already been modified as a\nconsequence of its change of food.  Here we can show that in even a\nfew generations structure is modified under changed conditions of\nexistence, but as we believe these cases to occur comparatively\nrarely, so it is still more rarely that they occur when and where we\ncan watch them.  Nature is eminently conservative, and fixity of\ntype, even under considerable change of conditions, is surely more\nimportant for the well-being of any species than an over-ready power\nof adaptation to, it may be, passing changes.  There could be no\nsteady progress if each generation were not mainly bound by the\ntraditions of those that have gone before it.  It is evolution and\nnot incessant revolution that both parties are upholding; and this\nbeing so, rapid visible modification must be the exception, not the\nrule.  I have quoted direct evidence adduced by competent observers,\nwhich is, I believe, sufficient to establish the fact that offspring\ncan be and is sometimes modified by the acquired habits of a\nprogenitor.  I will now proceed to the still more, as it appears to\nme, cogent proof afforded by general considerations.",
        "What, let me ask, are the principal phenomena of heredity?  There\nmust be physical continuity between parent, or parents, and\noffspring, so that the offspring is, as Erasmus Darwin well said, a\nkind of elongation of the life of the parent.",
        "Erasmus Darwin put the matter so well that I may as well give his\nwords in full; he wrote:-",
        "“Owing to the imperfection of language the offspring is termed a new\nanimal, but is in truth a branch or elongation of the parent, since\na part of the embryon animal is, or was, a part of the parent, and\ntherefore, in strict language, cannot be said to be entirely new at\nthe time of its production; and therefore it may retain some of the\nhabits of the parent system.",
        "“At the earliest period of its existence the embryon would seem to\nconsist of a living filament with certain capabilities of\nirritation, sensation, volition, and association, and also with some\nacquired habits or propensities peculiar to the parent; the former\nof these are in common with other animals; the latter seem to\ndistinguish or produce the kind of animal, whether man or quadruped,\nwith the similarity of feature or form to the parent.” {39}",
        "Those who accept evolution insist on unbroken physical continuity\nbetween the earliest known life and ourselves, so that we both are\nand are not personally identical with the unicellular organism from\nwhich we have descended in the course of many millions of years,\nexactly in the same way as an octogenarian both is and is not\npersonally identical with the microscopic impregnate ovum from which\nhe grew up.  Everything both is and is not.  There is no such thing\nas strict identity between any two things in any two consecutive\nseconds.  In strictness they are identical and yet not identical, so\nthat in strictness they violate a fundamental rule of strictness—\nnamely, that a thing shall never be itself and not itself at one and\nthe same time; we must choose between logic and dealing in a\npractical spirit with time and space; it is not surprising,\ntherefore, that logic, in spite of the show of respect outwardly\npaid to her, is told to stand aside when people come to practice.\nIn practice identity is generally held to exist where continuity is\nonly broken slowly and piecemeal, nevertheless, that occasional\nperiods of even rapid change are not held to bar identity, appears\nfrom the fact that no one denies this to hold between the\nmicroscopically small impregnate ovum and the born child that\nsprings from it, nor yet, therefore, between the impregnate ovum and\nthe octogenarian into which the child grows; for both ovum and\noctogenarian are held personally identical with the newborn baby,\nand things that are identical with the same are identical with one\nanother.",
        "The first, then, and most important element of heredity is that\nthere should be unbroken continuity, and hence sameness of\npersonality, between parents and offspring, in neither more nor less\nthan the same sense as that in which any other two personalities are\nsaid to be the same.  The repetition, therefore, of its\ndevelopmental stages by any offspring must be regarded as something\nwhich the embryo repeating them has already done once, in the person\nof one or other parent; and if once, then, as many times as there\nhave been generations between any given embryo now repeating it, and\nthe point in life from which we started—say, for example, the\namoeba.  In the case of asexually and sexually produced organisms\nalike, the offspring must be held to continue the personality of the\nparent or parents, and hence on the occasion of every fresh\ndevelopment, to be repeating something which in the person of its\nparent or parents it has done once, and if once, then any number of\ntimes, already.",
        "It is obvious, therefore, that the germ-plasm (or whatever the fancy\nword for it may be) of any one generation is as physically identical\nwith the germ-plasm of its predecessor as any two things can be.\nThe difference between Professor Weismann and, we will say,\nHeringians consists in the fact that the first maintains the new\ngerm-plasm when on the point of repeating its developmental\nprocesses to take practically no cognisance of anything that has\nhappened to it since the last occasion on which it developed itself;\nwhile the latter maintain that offspring takes much the same kind of\naccount of what has happened to it in the persons of its parents\nsince the last occasion on which it developed itself, as people in\nordinary life take of things that happen to them.  In daily life\npeople let fairly normal circumstances come and go without much heed\nas matters of course.  If they have been lucky they make a note of\nit and try to repeat their success.  If they have been unfortunate\nbut have recovered rapidly they soon forget it; if they have\nsuffered long and deeply they grizzle over it and are scared and\nscarred by it for a long time.  The question is one of cognisance or\nnon-cognisance on the part of the new germs, of the more profound\nimpressions made on them while they were one with their parents,\nbetween the occasion of their last preceding development, and the\nnew course on which they are about to enter.  Those who accept the\ntheory put forward independently by Professor Hering of Prague\n(whose work on this subject is translated in my book, “Unconscious\nMemory”) {40} and by myself in “Life and Habit,” {41} believe in\ncognizance, as do Lamarckians generally.  Weismannites, and with\nthem the orthodoxy of English science, find non-cognisance more\nacceptable.",
        "If the Heringian view is accepted, that heredity is only a mode of\nmemory, and an extension of memory from one generation to another,\nthen the repetition of its development by any embryo thus becomes\nonly the repetition of a lesson learned by rote; and, as I have\nelsewhere said, our view of life is simplified by finding that it is\nno longer an equation of, say, a hundred unknown quantities, but of\nninety-nine only, inasmuch as two of the unknown quantities prove to\nbe substantially identical.  In this case the inheritance of\nacquired characteristics cannot be disputed, for it is postulated in\nthe theory that each embryo takes note of, remembers and is guided\nby the profounder impressions made upon it while in the persons of\nits parents, between its present and last preceding development.  To\nmaintain this is to maintain use and disuse to be the main factors\nthroughout organic development; to deny it is to deny that use and\ndisuse can have any conceivable effect.  For the detailed reasons\nwhich led me to my own conclusions I must refer the reader to my\nbooks, “Life and Habit” {42} and “Unconscious Memory,” {42} the\nconclusions of which have been often adopted, but never, that I have\nseen, disputed.  A brief resume of the leading points in the\nargument is all that space will here allow me to give.",
        "We have seen that it is a first requirement of heredity that there\nshall be physical continuity between parents and offspring.  This\nholds good with memory.  There must be continued identity between\nthe person remembering and the person to whom the thing that is\nremembered happened.  We cannot remember things that happened to\nsome one else, and in our absence.  We can only remember having\nheard of them.  We have seen, however, that there is as much bona-\nfide sameness of personality between parents and offspring up to the\ntime at which the offspring quits the parent’s body, as there is\nbetween the different states of the parent himself at any two\nconsecutive moments; the offspring therefore, being one and the same\nperson with its progenitors until it quits them, can be held to\nremember what happened to them within, of course, the limitations to\nwhich all memory is subject, as much as the progenitors can remember\nwhat happened earlier to themselves.  Whether it does so remember\ncan only be settled by observing whether it acts as living beings\ncommonly do when they are acting under guidance of memory.  I will\nendeavour to show that, though heredity and habit based on memory go\nabout in different dresses, yet if we catch them separately—for\nthey are never seen together—and strip them there is not a mole nor\nstrawberry-mark, nor trick nor leer of the one, but we find it in\nthe other also.",
        "What are the moles and strawberry-marks of habitual action, or\nactions remembered and thus repeated?  First, the more often we\nrepeat them the more easily and unconsciously we do them.  Look at\nreading, writing, walking, talking, playing the piano, &c.; the\nlonger we have practised any one of these acquired habits, the more\neasily, automatically and unconsciously, we perform it.  Look, on\nthe other hand, broadly, at the three points to which I called\nattention in “Life and Habit”:-",
        "I.  That we are most conscious of and have most control over such\nhabits as speech, the upright position, the arts and sciences—which\nare acquisitions peculiar to the human race, always acquired after\nbirth, and not common to ourselves and any ancestor who had not\nbecome entirely human.",
        "II.  That we are less conscious of and have less control over eating\nand drinking [provided the food be normal], swallowing, breathing,\nseeing, and hearing—which were acquisitions of our prehuman\nancestry, and for which we had provided ourselves with all the\nnecessary apparatus before we saw light, but which are still,\ngeologically speaking, recent.",
        "III.  That we are most unconscious of and have least control over\nour digestion and circulation—powers possessed even by our\ninvertebrate ancestry, and, geologically speaking, of extreme\nantiquity.",
        "I have put the foregoing very broadly, but enough is given to show\nthe reader the gist of the argument.  Let it be noted that\ndisturbance and departure, to any serious extent, from normal\npractice tends to induce resumption of consciousness even in the\ncase of such old habits as breathing, seeing, and hearing, digestion\nand the circulation of the blood.  So it is with habitual actions in\ngeneral.  Let a player be never so proficient on any instrument, he\nwill be put out if the normal conditions under which he plays are\ntoo widely departed from, and will then do consciously, if indeed he\ncan do it at all, what he had hitherto been doing unconsciously.  It\nis an axiom as regards actions acquired after birth, that we never\ndo them automatically save as the result of long practice; the\nstages in the case of any acquired facility, the inception of which\nwe have been able to watch, have invariably been from a nothingness\nof ignorant impotence to a little somethingness of highly self-\nconscious, arduous performance, and thence to the\nunselfconsciousness of easy mastery.  I saw one year a poor blind\nlad of about eighteen sitting on a wall by the wayside at Varese,\nplaying the concertina with his whole body, and snorting like a\nchild.  The next year the boy no longer snorted, and he played with\nhis fingers only; the year after that he seemed hardly to know\nwhether he was playing or not, it came so easily to him.  I know no\nexception to this rule.  Where is the intricate and at one time\ndifficult art in which perfect automatic ease has been reached\nexcept as the result of long practice?  If, then, wherever we can\ntrace the development of automatism we find it to have taken this\ncourse, is it not most reasonable to infer that it has taken the\nsame even when it has risen in regions that are beyond our ken?\nOught we not, whenever we see a difficult action performed,\nautomatically to suspect antecedent practice?  Granted that without\nthe considerations in regard to identity presented above it would\nnot have been easy to see where a baby of a day old could have had\nthe practice which enables it to do as much as it does\nunconsciously, but even without these considerations it would have\nbeen more easy to suppose that the necessary opportunities had not\nbeen wanting, than that the easy performance could have been gained\nwithout practice and memory.",
        "When I wrote “Life and Habit” (originally published in 1877) I said\nin slightly different words:-",
        "“Shall we say that a baby of a day old sucks (which involves the\nwhole principle of the pump and hence a profound practical knowledge\nof the laws of pneumatics and hydrostatics), digests, oxygenises its\nblood—millions of years before any one had discovered oxygen—sees\nand hears, operations that involve an unconscious knowledge of the\nfacts concerning optics and acoustics compared with which the\nconscious discoveries of Newton are insignificant—shall we say that\na baby can do all these things at once, doing them so well and so\nregularly without being even able to give them attention, and yet\nwithout mistake, and shall we also say at the same time that it has\nnot learnt to do them, and never did them before?",
        "“Such an assertion would contradict the whole experience of\nmankind.”",
        "I have met with nothing during the thirteen years since the\nforegoing was published that has given me any qualms about its\nsoundness.  From the point of view of the law courts and everyday\nlife it is, of course, nonsense; but in the kingdom of thought, as\nin that of heaven, there are many mansions, and what would be\nextravagance in the cottage or farmhouse, as it were, of daily\npractice, is but common decency in the palace of high philosophy,\nwherein dwells evolution.  If we leave evolution alone, we may stick\nto common practice and the law courts; touch evolution and we are in\nanother world; not higher, not lower, but different as harmony from\ncounterpoint.  As, however, in the most absolute counterpoint there\nis still harmony, and in the most absolute harmony still\ncounterpoint, so high philosophy should be still in touch with\ncommon sense, and common sense with high philosophy.",
        "The common-sense view of the matter to people who are not over-\ncurious and to whom time is money, will be that a baby is not a baby\nuntil it is born, and that when born it should be born in wedlock.\nNevertheless, as a sop to high philosophy, every baby is allowed to\nbe the offspring of its father and mother.",
        "The high-philosophy view of the matter is that every human being is\nstill but a fresh edition of the primordial cell with the latest\nadditions and corrections; there has been no leap nor break in\ncontinuity anywhere; the man of to-day is the primordial cell of\nmillions of years ago as truly as he is the himself of yesterday; he\ncan only be denied to be the one on grounds that will prove him not\nto be the other.  Every one is both himself and all his direct\nancestors and descendants as well; therefore, if we would be\nlogical, he is one also with all his cousins, no matter how distant,\nfor he and they are alike identical with the primordial cell, and we\nhave already noted it as an axiom that things which are identical\nwith the same are identical with one another.  This is practically\nmaking him one with all living things, whether animal or vegetable,\nthat ever have existed or ever will—something of all which may have\nbeen in the mind of Sophocles when he wrote:-",
        "“Nor seest thou yet the gathering hosts of ill\nThat shall en-one thee both with thine own self\nAnd with thine offspring.”",
        "And all this has come of admitting that a man may be the same person\nfor two days running!  As for sopping common sense it will be enough\nto say that these remarks are to be taken in a strictly scientific\nsense, and have no appreciable importance as regards life and\nconduct.  True they deal with the foundations on which all life and\nconduct are based, but like other foundations they are hidden out of\nsight, and the sounder they are, the less we trouble ourselves about\nthem.",
        "What other main common features between heredity and memory may we\nnote besides the fact that neither can exist without that kind of\nphysical continuity which we call personal identity?  First, the\ndevelopment of the embryo proceeds in an established order; so must\nall habitual actions based on memory.  Disturb the normal order and\nthe performance is arrested.  The better we know “God save the\nQueen,” the less easily can we play or sing it backwards.  The\nreturn of memory again depends on the return of ideas associated\nwith the particular thing that is remembered—we remember nothing\nbut for the presence of these, and when enough of these are\npresented to us we remember everything.  So, if the development of\nan embryo is due to memory, we should suppose the memory of the\nimpregnate ovum to revert not to yesterday, when it was in the\npersons of its parents, but to the last occasion on which it was an\nimpregnate ovum.  The return of the old environment and the presence\nof old associations would at once involve recollection of the course\nthat should be next taken, and the same should happen throughout the\nwhole course of development.  The actual course of development\npresents precisely the phenomena agreeable with this.  For fuller\ntreatment of this point I must refer the reader to the chapter on\nthe abeyance of memory in my book “Life and Habit,” already referred\nto.",
        "Secondly, we remember best our last few performances of any given\nkind, so our present performance will probably resemble some one or\nother of these; we remember our earlier performances by way of\nresiduum only, but every now and then we revert to an earlier habit.\nThis feature of memory is manifested in heredity by the way in which\noffspring commonly resembles most its nearer ancestors, but\nsometimes reverts to earlier ones.  Brothers and sisters, each as it\nwere giving their own version of the same story, but in different\nwords, should generally resemble each other more closely than more\ndistant relations.  And this is what actually we find.",
        "Thirdly, the introduction of slightly new elements into a method\nalready established varies it beneficially; the new is soon fused\nwith the old, and the monotony ceases to be oppressive.  But if the\nnew be too foreign, we cannot fuse the old and the new—nature\nseeming to hate equally too wide a deviation from ordinary practice\nand none at all.  This fact reappears in heredity as the beneficial\neffects of occasional crossing on the one hand, and on the other, in\nthe generally observed sterility of hybrids.  If heredity be an\naffair of memory, how can an embryo, say of a mule, be expected to\nbuild up a mule on the strength of but two mule-memories?  Hybridism\ncauses a fault in the chain of memory, and it is to this cause that\nthe usual sterility of hybrids must be referred.",
        "Fourthly, it requires many repeated impressions to fix a method\nfirmly, but when it has been engrained into us we cease to have much\nrecollection of the manner in which it came to be so, or indeed of\nany individual repetition, but sometimes a single impression, if\nprolonged as well as profound, produces a lasting impression and is\nliable to return with sudden force, and then to go on returning to\nus at intervals.  As a general rule, however, abnormal impressions\ncannot long hold their own against the overwhelming preponderance of\nnormal authority.  This appears in heredity as the normal non-\ninheritance of mutilations on the one hand, and on the other as\ntheir occasional inheritance in the case of injuries followed by\ndisease.",
        "Fifthly, if heredity and memory are essentially the same, we should\nexpect that no animal would develop new structures of importance\nafter the age at which its species begins ordinarily to continue its\nrace; for we cannot suppose offspring to remember anything that\nhappens to the parent subsequently to the parent’s ceasing to\ncontain the offspring within itself.  From the average age,\ntherefore, of reproduction, offspring should cease to have any\nfarther steady, continuous memory to fall back upon; what memory\nthere is should be full of faults, and as such unreliable.  An\norganism ought to develop as long as it is backed by memory—that is\nto say, until the average age at which reproduction begins; it\nshould then continue to go for a time on the impetus already\nreceived, and should eventually decay through failure of any memory\nto support it, and tell it what to do.  This corresponds absolutely\nwith what we observe in organisms generally, and explains, on the\none hand, why the age of puberty marks the beginning of completed\ndevelopment—a riddle hitherto not only unexplained but, so far as I\nhave seen, unasked; it explains, on the other hand, the phenomena of\nold age—hitherto without even attempt at explanation.",
        "Sixthly, those organisms that are the longest in reaching maturity\nshould on the average be the longest-lived, for they will have\nreceived the most momentous impulse from the weight of memory behind\nthem.  This harmonises with the latest opinion as to the facts.  In\nhis article on Weismann in the Contemporary Review for May 1890, Mr.\nRomanes writes:  “Professor Weismann has shown that there is\nthroughout the metazoa a general correlation between the natural\nlifetime of individuals composing any given species, and the age at\nwhich they reach maturity or first become capable of procreation.\"\nThis, I believe, has been the conclusion generally arrived at by\nbiologists for some years past.",
        "Lateness, then, in the average age of reproduction appears to be the\nprinciple underlying longevity.  There does not appear at first\nsight to be much connection between such distinct and apparently\ndisconnected phenomena as 1, the orderly normal progress of\ndevelopment; 2, atavism and the resumption of feral characteristics;\n3, the more ordinary resemblance inter se of nearer relatives; 4,\nthe benefit of an occasional cross, and the usual sterility of\nhybrids; 5, the unconsciousness with which alike bodily development\nand ordinary physiological functions proceed, so long as they are\nnormal; 6, the ordinary non-inheritance, but occasional inheritance\nof mutilations; 7, the fact that puberty indicates the approach of\nmaturity; 8, the phenomena of middle life and old age; 9, the\nprinciple underlying longevity.  These phenomena have no conceivable\nbearing on one another until heredity and memory are regarded as\npart of the same story.  Identify these two things, and I know no\nphenomenon of heredity that does not immediately become infinitely\nmore intelligible.  Is it conceivable that a theory which harmonises\nso many facts hitherto regarded as without either connection or\nexplanation should not deserve at any rate consideration from those\nwho profess to take an interest in biology?",
        "It is not as though the theory were unknown, or had been condemned\nby our leading men of science.  Professor Ray Lankester introduced\nit to English readers in an appreciative notice of Professor\nHering’s address, which appeared in Nature, July 18, 1876.  He wrote\nto the Athenaeum, March 24, 1884, and claimed credit for having done\nso, but I do not believe he has ever said more in public about it\nthan what I have here referred to.  Mr. Romanes did indeed try to\ncrush it in Nature, January 27, 1881, but in 1883, in his “Mental\nEvolution in Animals,” he adopted its main conclusion without\nacknowledgment.  The Athenaeum, to my unbounded surprise, called him\nto task for this (March 1, 1884), and since that time he has given\nthe Heringian theory a sufficiently wide berth.  Mr. Wallace showed\nhimself favourably enough disposed towards the view that heredity\nand memory are part of the same story when he reviewed my book “Life\nand Habit” in Nature, March 27, 1879, but he has never since\nbetrayed any sign of being aware that such a theory existed.  Mr.\nHerbert Spencer wrote to the Athenaeum (April 5, 1884), and claimed\nthe theory for himself, but, in spite of his doing this, he has\nnever, that I have seen, referred to the matter again.  I have dealt\nsufficiently with his claim in my book, “Luck or Cunning.” {43}\nLastly, Professor Hering himself has never that I know of touched\nhis own theory since the single short address read in 1870, and\ntranslated by me in 1881.  Every one, even its originator, except\nmyself, seems afraid to open his mouth about it.  Of course the\ninference suggests itself that other people have more sense than I\nhave.  I readily admit it; but why have so many of our leaders shown\nsuch a strong hankering after the theory, if there is nothing in it?",
        "The deadlock that I have pointed out as existing in Darwinism will,\nI doubt not, lead ere long to a consideration of Professor Hering’s\ntheory.  English biologists are little likely to find Weismann\nsatisfactory for long, and if he breaks down there is nothing left\nfor them but Lamarck, supplemented by the important and elucidatory\ncorollary on his theory proposed by Professor Hering.  When the time\narrives for this to obtain a hearing it will be confirmed,\ndoubtless, by arguments clearer and more forcible than any I have\nbeen able to adduce; I shall then be delighted to resign the\nchampionship which till then I shall continue, as for some years\npast, to have much pleasure in sustaining.  Heretofore my\nsatisfaction has mainly lain in the fact that more of our prominent\nmen of science have seemed anxious to claim the theory than to\nrefute it; in the confidence thus engendered I leave it to any\nfuller consideration which the outline I have above given may\nincline the reader to bestow upon it.",
