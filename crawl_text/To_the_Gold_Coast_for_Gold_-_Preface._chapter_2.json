        "The following extract from ’Wanderings in West Africa,’ a book which I\nwrote in 1862 and published (anonymously) in 1863, will best explain the\nreasons which lately sent me to Western Africa:–",
        "In several countries, for instance, Dinkira, Tueful, Wásá (Wassaw), and\nespecially Akim, the hill-region lying north of Accra, the people are\nstill active in digging gold. The pits, varying from two to three feet\nin diameter, and from twelve to fifty deep (eighty feet is the extreme),\nare often so near the roads that loss of life has been the\nresult. ’Shoring up’ being little known, the miners are not unfrequently\nburied alive. The stuff is drawn up by ropes in clay pots, or\ncalabashes, and thus a workman at the bottom widens the pit to a\npyriform shape; tunnelling, however, is unknown. The excavated earth is\ncarried down to be washed. Besides sinking these holes, they pan in the\nbeds of rivers, and in places collect quartz, which is roughly pounded.",
        "They (the natives) often refuse to dig deeper than the chin, for fear of\nthe earth ’caving in;’ and, quartz-crushing and the use of quicksilver\nbeing unknown, they will not wash unless the gold ’show colour’ to the\nnaked eye.",
        "As we advance northwards from the Gold Coast the yield becomes\nricher....",
        "It is becoming evident that Africa will one day equal half-a-dozen\nCalifornias....",
        "Will our grandsons believe in these times ... that this Ophir–that\nthis California, where every river is a Tmolus and a Pactolus, every\nhillock is a gold-field–does not contain a cradle, a puddling-machine,\na quartz-crusher, a pound of mercury? That half the washings are wasted\nbecause quicksilver is unknown? That whilst convict labour is\nattainable, not a company has been formed, not a surveyor has been sent\nout? I exclaim with Dominie Sampson–’Pro-di-gious!’",
        "Western Africa was the first field that supplied the precious metal to\nmediaeval Europe. The French claim to have imported it from Elmina as\nearly as A.D. 1382. In 1442 Gonçales Baldeza returned from his second\nvoyage to the regions about Bojador, bringing with him the first gold.\nPresently a company was formed for the purpose of carrying on the\ngold-trade between Portugal and Africa. Its leading men were the\nnavigators Lanzarote and Gilianez, and Prince Henry ’the Navigator’ did\nnot disdain to become a member. In 1471 João de Santarem and Pedro\nEscobar reached a place on the Gold Coast to which, from the abundance\nof gold found there, they gave the name of ’São Jorje da Mina,’ the\npresent Elmina. After this a flood of gold poured into the lap of\nEurope; and at last, cupidity having mastered terror of the Papal Bull,\nwhich assigned to Portugal an exclusive right to the Eastern Hemisphere,\nEnglish, French, and Dutch adventurers hastened to share the spoils.",
        "For long years my words fell upon flat ears. Presently the Ashanti war\nof 1873-74 brought the subject before the public. The Protectorate was\noverrun by British officers, and their reports and itineraries never\nfailed to contain, with a marvellous unanimity of iteration, the magic\nword–Gold.",
        "The fraction of country, twenty-six miles of seaboard out of two\nhundred, by a depth of sixty–in fact, the valley of the Ancobra\nRiver–now (early 1882) contains five working companies. Upwards of\nseventy concessions, to my knowledge, have been obtained from native\nowners, and many more are spoken of. In fact, development has at length\nbegun, and the line of progress is clearly traced.",
        "At Madeira I was joined (January 8, 1882) by Captain Cameron, R.N.,\nC.B., &c. Our object was to explore the so-called Kong Mountains, which\nof late years have become quasi-mythical. He came out admirably\nequipped; nor was I less prepared. But inevitable business had delayed\nus both, and we landed on the Gold Coast at the end of January instead\nof early October. The hot-dry season had set in with a heat and a\ndrought unknown for years; the climate was exceptionally trying, and all\nexperts predicted early and violent rains. Finally, we found so much to\ndo upon the Ancobra River that we had no time for exploration. Geography\nis good, but Gold is better.",
        "In this joint book my energetic and hard-working friend and\nfellow-traveller has described the five working mines which I was unable\nto visit. He has also made an excellent route-survey of the country,\ncorrected by many and careful astronomical observations. It is curious\nto compare his work with the sketches of previous observers, Jeekel,\nWyatt, Bonnat, and Dahse. To my companion’s industry also are mainly due\nour collections of natural history.",
        "We are answerable only for our own, not for each other’s statements. As\nregards my part, I have described the Gold-land as minutely as possible,\ndespite the many and obvious disadvantages of the ’photographic style.’\nIndeed, we travellers often find ourselves in a serious dilemma. If we\ndo not draw our landscapes somewhat in pre-Raphaelite fashion, they do\nnot impress the reader; if we do, critics tell us that they are\nwearisome longueurs, and that the half would be better than the\nwhole. The latter alternative must often be risked, especially in\nwriting about a country where many at home have friends and\nrelatives. Of course they desire to have as much detail about it as\npossible; hence the reader will probably pardon my ’curiosity.’",
        "The Appendix discusses at some length the various objections made to the\nGold Coast mines by the public, which suffers equally from the ’bull’\nand the ’bear’ and from the wild rumours set afloat by those not\ninterested in the speculation. I first dispose of the dangers menaced by\nAshanti invasions. The second number notices the threatened\nlabour-famine, and shows how immigration of Chinese, of coolies, and of\nZanzibar-men will, when wanted, supply not only the Gold Coast, but also\nthe whole of our unhappy West African stations, miscalled colonies,\nwhich are now starving for lack of hands. The third briefly sketches the\nhistory of the Gold-trade in the north-western section of the Dark\nContinent, discusses the position and the connections of the auriferous\nKong Mountains, and suggests the easiest system of ’getting’ the\nprecious metal. This is by shallow working, by washing, and by the\n’hydraulicking’ which I had studied in California. The earlier miners\nhave, it is believed, begun at the wrong end with deep workings, shafts,\nand tunnels; with quartz-crushers, stamps, and heavy and expensive\nmachinery, when flumes and force-pumps would have cost less and brought\nmore. Our observations and deductions, drawn from a section of coast,\nwill apply if true, as I believe they are, to the whole region between\nthe Assini and the Volta Rivers.",
        "I went to the Gold Coast with small expectations. I found the Wásá\n(Wassaw) country, Ancobra section, far richer than the most glowing\ndescriptions had represented it. Gold and other metals are there in\nabundance, and there are good signs of diamond, ruby, and sapphire.",
        "Remains to be seen if England has still honesty and public spirit enough\nto work this old-new California as it should be worked. I will answer\nfor its success if the workers will avoid over-exclusiveness, undue\njealousy and rivalry, stockjobbing, and the rings of ’guinea-pigs’ and\n’guinea-worms.’",
