        "A long and exhaustive examination of the history of flying machines\nenables me to give briefly some of the main points of a few, for the\nbenefit of those who may be interested in this science. I give what I do\nin order to prepare the public to take advantage of the different methods,\nand be ready at once to fly as soon as the weather gets pleasant.",
        "A Frenchman invented a flying-machine, or dofunny, as we scientists would\nterm it, in 1600 and something, whereby he could sail down from the\nwoodshed and not break his neck. He could not rise from the ground like a\nlark and trill a few notes as he skimmed through the sky, but he could\nfall off an ordinary hay stack like a setting hen, with the aid of his\nwings. His name was Besnier.",
        "One hundred and twenty-five years after that a prisoner at Vienna, named\nJacob Dagen, told the jailer that he could fly. The jailer seemed\nincredulous, and so Jake constructed a pair of double barrel umbrellas,\nthat worked by hand, and fluttered with his machine into the air fifty\nfeet. He came down in a direct line, and in doing so ran one of the\numbrellas through his thorax. I am glad it is not the custom now to wear\nan umbrella in the thorax.",
        "In England, during the present century, several inventors produced flying\nmachines, but in an evil hour agreed to rise on them themselves, and so\nthey died from their injuries. Some came down on top of the machines,\nwhile others preceded their inventions by a few feet, but the result was\nthe same. The invention of flying machines has always been handicapped, as\nit were, by this fact Men invent a flying machine and then try to ride it\nand show it off, and thus they are prevented by death from perfecting\ntheir rolling stock and securing their right of way.",
        "In 1842, Mr. William Henderson got out a “two-propeller” machine, and\ntried to incorporate a company to utilize it for the purpose of carrying\nletters, running errands, driving home the cows, lighting the Northern\nLights and skimming the cream off the Milky Way, but it didn’t seem to\ncompete very successfully with other modes of travel, and so Mr. Henderson\nwrapped it up in an old tent and put it away in the hay-mow.",
        "In 1853, Mr. J.H. Johnson patented a balloon and parachute dingus which\nworked on the principle of a duck’s foot in the mud. I use scientific\nterms because I am unable to express myself in the common language of the\nvulgar herd. This machine had a tail which, under great excitement, it\nwould throw over the dash board as it bounded through the air.",
        "Probably the biggest thing in its way under this head was the revival of\nflying under the presidency of the Duke of Argyle, the society being\ncalled the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain. This society made some\nvaluable calculations and experiments in the interest of aerostation,\nadding much to our scientific knowledge, and filling London with cripples.",
        "In 1869, Mr. Joseph T. Kaufman invented and turned loose upon the people\nof Glasgow an infernal machine intended to soar considerably in a quiet\nkind of way and to be propelled by steam. It looked like the bird known to\nornithology as the flyupithecrick, and had an air brake, patent coupler,\nbuffer and platform. It was intended to hold two men on ice and a rosewood\ncasket with silver handles. It was mounted on wheels, and, as it did not\nseem to skim through the air very much, the people of Glasgow hitched a\nclothes line to it and used it for a band wagon.",
        "Rufus Porter invented an aerial dewdad ten years ago in Connecticut, where\nso many crimes have been committed since Mark Twain moved there. This was\ncalled the “aeraport,” and looked like a seed wart floating through space.\nThis engine was worked by springs connected with propellers. A saloon was\nsuspended beneath it, I presume on the principle that when a man is\nintoxicated he weighs a pound less. This machine flew around the rotunda\nof the Merchants’ Exchange, in New York City, eleven times, like a hen\nwith her head cut off, but has not been on the wing much since then.",
        "Other flying machines have been invented, but the air is not peopled with\nthem as I write. Most of them have folded their pinions and sought the\nseclusion of a hen-house. It is to be hoped that very soon some such\nmachine will be perfected, whereby a man may flit from the fifth story\nwindow of the Grand Pacific Hotel, in Chicago, to Montreal before\nbreakfast, leaving nothing in his room but the furniture and his kind\nregards.",
        "Such an invention would be hailed with much joy, and the sale would be\nenormous. Now, however, the matter is still in its infancy. The mechanical\nbirds invented for the purpose of skimming through the ether blue, have\nnot skum. The machines were built with high hopes and a throbbing heart,\nbut the aforesaid ether remains unskum as we go to press. The Milky Way is\nin the same condition, awaiting the arrival of the fearless skimmer. Will\nmen ever be permitted to pierce the utmost details of the sky and ramble\naround among the stars with a gum overcoat on? Sometimes I trow he will,\nand then again I ween not.",
