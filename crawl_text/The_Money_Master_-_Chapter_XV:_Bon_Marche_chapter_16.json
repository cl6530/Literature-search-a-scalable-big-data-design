        "Vilray was having its market day, and everyone was either going to or\ncoming from market, or buying and selling in the little square by the\nCourt House.  It was the time when the fruits were coming in, when\nvegetables were in full yield, when fish from the Beau Cheval were to be\nhad in plenty–from mud-cats and suckers, pike and perch, to rock-bass,\nsturgeon and even maskinonge.  Also it was the time of year when butter\nand eggs, chickens and ducks were so cheap that it was a humiliation not\nto buy.  There were other things on sale also, not for eating and\ndrinking, but for wear and household use–from pots and pans to rag-\ncarpets and table-linen, from woollen yarn to pictures of the Virgin and\nlittle calvaries.",
        "These were side by side with dried apples, bottled fruits, jars of maple\nsyrup, and cordials of so generous and penetrating a nature that the\ncurrant and elderberry wine by which they were flanked were tipple for\nbabes beside them.  Indeed, when a man wanted to forget himself quickly\nhe drank one of these cordials, in preference to the white whisky so\ncommonly imbibed in the parishes.  But the cordials being expensive, they\nwere chiefly bought for festive occasions like a wedding, a funeral, a\nconfirmation, or the going away of some young man or young woman to the\nmonastery or the convent to forget the world.  Meanwhile, if these\nspiritual argonauts drank it, they were likely to forget the world on the\nway to their voluntary prisons.  It was very seldom that a man or woman\nbought the cordials for ordinary consumption, and when that was done, it\nwould almost make a parish talk!  Yet cordials of nice brown, of delicate\ngreen, of an enticing yellow colour, were here for sale at Vilray market\non the morning after the painful scene at the Manor Cartier between Zoe\nand her father.",
        "The market-place was full–fuller than it had been for many a day.  A\ngreat many people were come in as much to “make fete” as to buy and sell.\nIt was a saint’s day, and the bell of St. Monica’s had been ringing away\ncheerfully twice that morning.  To it the bell of the Court House had\nmade reply, for a big case was being tried in the court.  It was a river-\ndriving and lumber case for which many witnesses had been called; and\nthere were all kinds of stray people in the place–red-shirted river-\ndrivers, a black-coated Methodist minister from Chalfonte, clerks from\nlumber-firms, and foremen of lumber-yards; and among these was one who\ngreatly loved such a day as this when he could be free from work, and\ncelebrate himself!",
        "Other people might celebrate saints dead and gone, and drink to ’La\nPatrie’, and cry “Vive Napoleon!” or “Vive la Republique!” or “Vive la\nReine!” though this last toast of the Empire was none too common–but he\ncould only drink with real sincerity to the health of Sebastian Dolores,\nwhich was himself.  Sebastian Dolores was the pure anarchist, the most\ncomplete of monomaniacs.",
        "“Here comes the father of the Spanische,” remarked Mere Langlois, who\npresided over a heap of household necessities, chiefly dried fruits,\npreserves and pickles, as Sebastian Dolores appeared not far away.",
        "“Good-for-nothing villain!  I pity the poor priest that confesses him.”",
        "“Who is the Spanische?” asked a young woman from her own stall or stand\nvery near, as she involuntarily arranged her hair and adjusted her waist-\nbelt; for the rakish-looking reprobate, with the air of having been\nsomewhere, was making towards them; and she was young enough to care how\nshe looked when a man, who took notice, was near.  Her own husband had\nbeen a horse-doctor, farmer, and sportsman of a kind, and she herself was\nnow a farmer of a kind; and she had only resided in the parish during the\nthree years since she had been married to, and buried, Palass Poucette.",
        "Old Mere Langlois looked at her companion in merchanting irritably, then\nshe remembered that Virginie Poucette was a stranger, in a way, and was\ntherefore deserving of pity, and she said with compassionate patronage:\n“Newcomer you–I’d forgotten.  Look you then, the Spanische was the wife\nof my third cousin, M’sieu’ Jean Jacques, and–”",
        "Virginie Poucette nodded, and the slight frown cleared from her low yet\nshapely forehead.  “Yes, yes, of course I know.  I’ve heard enough.  What\na fool she was, and M’sieu’ Jean Jacques so rich and kind and good-\nlooking!  So this is her father–well, well, well!”",
        "Palass Poucette’s widow leaned forward, and looked intently at Sebastian\nDolores, who had stopped near by, and facing a couple of barrels on which\nwere exposed some bottles of cordial and home-made wine.  He was\naddressing himself with cheerful words to the dame that owned the\nmerchandise.",
        "“I suppose you think it’s a pity Jean Jacques can’t get a divorce,\"\nsaid Mere Langlois, rather spitefully to Virginie, for she had her\nsex’s aversion to widows who had had their share of mankind, and were\nafterwards free to have someone else’s share as well.  But suddenly\nrepenting, for Virginie was a hard-working widow who had behaved very\nwell for an outsider–having come from Chalfonte beyond the Beau\nChevalshe added: “But if he was a Protestant and could get a divorce,\nand you did marry him, you’d make him have more sense than he’s got; for\nyou’ve a quiet sensible way, and you’ve worked hard since Palass Poucette\ndied.”",
        "“Where doesn’t he show sense, that M’sieu’ Jean Jacques?” the younger\nwoman asked.",
        "“Where?  Why, with his girl–with Ma’m’selle.”  “Everybody I ever heard\nspeaks well of Ma’m’selle Zoe,” returned the other warmly, for she had a\nvery generous mind and a truthful, sentimental heart.  Mere Langlois\nsniffed, and put her hands on her hips, for she had a daughter of her\nown; also she was a relation of Jean Jacques, and therefore resented in\none way the difference in their social position, while yet she plumed\nherself on being kin.",
        "“Then you’ll learn something now you never knew before,” she said.\n“She’s been carrying on–there’s no other word for it–with an actor\nfellow–”",
        "“Yes, yes, I did hear about him–a Protestant and an Englishman.”",
        "“Well, then, why do you pretend you don’t know–only to hear me talk, is\nit?  Take my word, I’d teach cousin Zoe a lesson with all her education\nand her two years at the convent.  Wasn’t it enough that her mother\nshould spoil everything for Jean Jacques, and make the Manor Cartier a\nplace to point the finger at, without her bringing disgrace on the parish\ntoo!  What happened last night–didn’t I hear this morning before I had\nmy breakfast!  Didn’t I–”",
        "She then proceeded to describe the scene in which Jean Jacques had thrown\nthe wrecked guitar of his vanished spouse into the fire.  Before she had\nfinished, however, something occurred which swept them into another act\nof the famous history of Jean Jacques Barbille and his house.",
        "She had arrived at the point where Zoe had cried aloud in pain at her\nfather’s incendiary act, when there was a great stir at the Court House\ndoor which opened on the market-place, and vagrant cheers arose.  These\nwere presently followed by a more disciplined fusillade; which presently,\nin turn, was met by hisses and some raucous cries of resentment.  These\nincreased as a man appeared on the steps of the Court House, looked round\nfor a moment in a dazed kind of way, then seeing some friends below who\nwere swarming towards him, gave a ribald cry, and scrambled down the\nsteps towards them.",
        "He was the prisoner whose release had suddenly been secured by a piece of\nevidence which had come as a thunder-clap on judge and jury.  Immediately\nafter giving this remarkable evidence the witness–Sebastian Dolores–\nhad left the court-room.  He was now engaged in buying cordials in the\nmarket-place–in buying and drinking them; for he had pulled the cork out\nof a bottle filled with a rich yellow liquid, and had drained half the\nbottle at a gulp.  Presently he offered the remainder to a passing\ncarter, who made a gesture of contempt and passed on, for, to him, white\nwhisky was the only drink worth while.  Besides, he disliked Sebastian\nDolores.  Then, with a flourish, the Spaniard tendered the bottle to\nMadame Langlois and Palass Poucette’s widow, at whose corner of\nmerchandise he had now arrived.",
        "Surely there never was a more benign villain and perjurer in the world\nthan Sebastian Dolores!  His evidence, given a half-hour before, with\nevery sign of truthfulness, was false.  The man–Rocque Valescure–for\nwhom he gave it was no friend of his; but he owned a tavern called “The\nRed Eagle,” a few miles from the works where the Spaniard was employed;\nalso Rocque Valescure’s wife set a good table, and Sebastian Dolores was\na very liberal feeder; when he was not hungry he was always thirsty.  The\nappeasement of hunger and thirst was now become a problem to him, for his\nemployers at Beauharnais had given him a month’s notice because of\ncertain irregularities which had come to their knowledge.  Like a wise\nman Sebastian Dolores had said nothing about this abroad, but had\nenlarged his credit in every direction, and had then planned this piece\nof friendly perjury for Rocque Valescure, who was now descending the\nsteps of the Court House to the arms of his friends and amid the\nexecrations of his foes.  What the alleged crime was does not matter.\nIt has no vital significance in the history of Jean Jacques Barbille,\nthough it has its place as a swivel on which the future swung.",
        "Sebastian Dolores had saved Rocque Valescure from at least three years in\njail, and possibly a very heavy fine as well; and this service must have\nits due reward.  Something for nothing was not the motto of Sebastian\nDolores; and he confidently looked forward to having a home at “The Red\nEagle” and a banker in its landlord.  He was no longer certain that he\ncould rely on help from Jean Jacques, to whom he already owed so much.\nThat was why he wanted to make Rocque Valescure his debtor.  It was not\nhis way to perjure his soul for nothing.  He had done so in Spain–yet\nnot for nothing either.  He had saved his head, which was now doing\nuseful work for himself and for a needy fellow-creature.  No one could\ndoubt that he had helped a neighbour in great need, and had done it at\nsome expense to his own nerve and brain.  None but an expert could have\nlied as he had done in the witness-box.  Also he had upheld his lies with\na striking narrative of circumstantiality.  He made things fit in “like\nmortised blocks” as the Clerk of the Court said to Judge Carcasson, when\nthey discussed the infamy afterwards with clear conviction that it was\nperjury of a shameless kind; for one who would perjure himself to save a\nman from jail, would also swear a man into the gallows-rope.  But Judge\nCarcasson had not been able to charge the jury in that sense, for there\nwas no effective evidence to rebut the untruthful attestation of the\nSpaniard.  It had to be taken for what it was worth, since the\nprosecuting attorney could not shake it; and yet to the Court itself it\nwas manifestly false witness.",
        "Sebastian Dolores was too wise to throw himself into the arms of his\nreleased tavern-keeper here immediately after the trial, or to allow\nRocque Valescure a like indiscretion and luxury; for there was a strong\nlaw against perjury, and right well Sebastian Dolores knew that old Judge\nCarcasson would have little mercy on him, in spite of the fact that he\nwas the grandfather of Zoe Barbille.  The Judge would probably think that\nsafe custody for his wayward character would be the kindest thing he\ncould do for Zoe.  Therefore it was that Sebastian Dolores paid no\nattention to the progress of the released landlord of “The Red Eagle,\"\nthough, by a glance out of the corner of his eyes, he made sure that the\nfootsteps of liberated guilt were marching at a tangent from where he\nwas–even to the nearest tavern.",
        "It was enough for Dolores that he should watch the result of his good\ndeed from the isolated area where he now was, in the company of two\nvirtuous representatives of domesticity.  His time with liberated guilt\nwould come!  He chuckled to think how he had provided himself with a\nrefuge against his hour of trouble.  That very day he had left his\nemployment, meaning to return no more, securing his full wages through\nhaving suddenly become resentful and troublesome, neglectful–and\nimperative.  To avoid further unpleasantness the firm had paid him all\nhis wages; and he had straightway come to Vilray to earn his bed and\nboard by other means than through a pen, a ledger and a gift for figures.\nIt would not be a permanent security against the future, but it would\nsuffice for the moment.  It was a rest-place on the road.  If the worst\ncame to the worst, there was his grand-daughter and his dear son-in-law\nwhom he so seldom saw–blood was thicker than water, and he would see to\nit that it was not thinned by neglect.",
        "Meanwhile he ogled Palass Poucette’s widow with one eye, and talked\nsoftly with his tongue to Mere Langlois, as he importuned Madame to “Sip\nthe good cordial in the name of charity to all and malice towards none.”",
        "“You’re a bad man–you, and I want none of your cordials,” was Mere\nLanglois’s response.  “Malice towards none, indeed!  If you and the devil\nstarted business in the same street, you’d make him close up shop in a\nyear.  I’ve got your measure, for sure; I have you certain as an arm and\na pair of stirrups.”",
        "“I go about doing good–only good,” returned the old sinner with a leer\nat the young widow, whose fingers he managed to press unseen, as he swung\nthe little bottle of cordial before the eyes of Mere Langlois.  He was\nnot wholly surprised when Palass Poucette’s widow did not show abrupt\ndispleasure at his bold familiarity.",
        "A wild thought flashed into his mind.  Might there not be another refuge\nhere–here in Palass Poucette’s widow!  He was sixty-three, it was true,\nand she was only thirty-two; but for her to be an old man’s darling who\nhad no doubt been a young man’s slave, that would surely have its weight\nwith her.  Also she owned the farm where she lived; and she was pleasant\npasturage–that was the phrase he used in his own mind, even as his eye\nswept from Mere Langlois to hers in swift, hungry inquiry.",
        "He seemed in earnest when he spoke–but that was his way; it had done him\nservice often.  “I do good whenever it comes my way to do it,” he\ncontinued.  “I left my work this morning\"–he lied of course–\"and hired\na buggy to bring me over here, all at my own cost, to save a fellow-man.\nThere in the Court House he was sure of prison, with a wife and three\nsmall children weeping in ’The Red Eagle’; and there I come at great\nexpense and trouble to tell the truth–before all to tell the truth–and\nsave him and set him free.  Yonder he is in the tavern, the work of my\nhands, a gift to the world from an honest man with a good heart and a\nsense of justice.  But for me there would be a wife and three children in\nthe bondage of shame, sorrow, poverty and misery\"–his eyes again\nravished the brown eyes of Palass Poucette’s widow–\"and here again\nI drink to my own health and to that of all good people–with charity\nto all and malice towards none!”",
        "The little bottle of golden cordial was raised towards Mere Langlois.\nThe fingers of one hand, however, were again seeking those of the comely\nyoung widow who was half behind him, when he felt them caught\nspasmodically away.  Before he had time to turn round he heard a voice,\nsaying: “I should have thought that ’With malice to all and charity\ntowards none,’ was your motto, Dolores.”",
        "He knew that voice well enough.  He had always had a lurking fear that\nhe would hear it say something devastating to him, from the great chair\nwhere its owner sat and dispensed what justice a jury would permit him to\ndo.  That devastating something would be agony to one who loved liberty\nand freedom–had not that ever been his watchword, liberty and freedom to\ndo what he pleased in the world and with the world?  Yes, he well knew\nJudge Carcasson’s voice.  He would have recognized it in the dark–or\nunder the black cap.  “M’sieu’ le juge !” he said, even before he turned\nround and saw the faces of the tiny Judge and his Clerk of the Court.\nThere was a kind of quivering about his mouth, and a startled look in his\neyes as he faced the two.  But there was the widow of Palass Poucette,\nand, if he was to pursue and frequent her, something must be done to keep\nhim decently figured in her eye and mind.",
        "“It cost me three dollars to come here and save a man from jail to-day,\nm’sieu’ le juge,” he added firmly.  The Judge pressed the point of his\ncane against the stomach of the hypocrite and perjurer.  “If the Devil\nand you meet, he will take off his hat to you, my escaped anarchist\"–\nDolores started almost violently now–\"for you can teach him much, and\nAnanias was the merest aboriginal to you.  But we’ll get you–we’ll get\nyou, Dolores.  You saved that guilty fellow by a careful and remarkable\nperjury to-day.  In a long experience I have never seen a better\nperformance–have you, monsieur?” he added to M. Fille.",
        "“But once,” was the pointed and deliberate reply.  “Ah, when was that?\"\nasked Judge Carcasson, interested.",
        "“The year monsieur le juge was ill, and Judge Blaquiere took your place.\nIt was in Vilray at the Court House here.”",
        "“Ah–ah, and who was the phenomenon–the perfect liar?” asked the Judge\nwith the eagerness of the expert.",
        "“His name was Sebastian Dolores,” meditatively replied M. Fille.  “It was\neven a finer performance than that of to-day.”",
        "The Judge gave a little grunt of surprise.  “Twice, eh?” he asked.\n“Yet this was good enough to break any record,” he added.  He fastened\nthe young widow’s eyes.  “Madame, you are young, and you have an eye of\nintelligence.  Be sure of this: you can protect yourself against almost\nanyone except a liar–eh, madame?” he added to Mere Langlois.  “I am\nsure your experience of life and your good sense–”",
        "“My good sense would make me think purgatory was hell if I saw him\"–\nshe nodded savagely at Dolores as she said it, for she had seen that last\neffort of his to take the fingers of Palass Poucette’s widow–\"if I saw\nhim there, m’sieu’ le juge.”",
        "“We’ll have you yet–we’ll have you yet, Dolores,” said the Judge, as the\nSpaniard prepared to move on.  But, as Dolores went, he again caught the\neyes of the young widow.",
        "This made him suddenly bold.  “’Thou shalt not bear false witness against\nthy neighbour,’–that is the commandment, is it not, m’sieu’ le juge?\nYou are doing against me what I didn’t do in Court to-day.  I saved a man\nfrom your malice.”",
        "The crook of the Judge’s cane caught the Spaniard’s arm, and held him\ngently.",
        "“You’re possessed of a devil, Dolores,” he said, “and I hope I’ll never\nhave to administer justice in your case.  I might be more man than judge.\nBut you will come to no good end.  You will certainly–”",
        "He got no further, for the attention of all was suddenly arrested by a\nwagon driving furiously round the corner of the Court House.  It was a\nred wagon.  In it was Jean Jacques Barbille.",
        "His face was white and set; his head was thrust forward, as though\nlooking at something far ahead of him; the pony stallions he was driving\nwere white with sweat, and he had an air of tragic helplessness and\npanic.",
        "Suddenly a child ran across the roadway in front of the ponies, and the\nwild cry of the mother roused Jean Jacques out of his agonized trance.\nHe sprang to his feet, wrenching the horses backward and aside with\ndeftness and presence of mind.  The margin of safety was not more than a\nfoot, but the child was saved.",
        "The philosopher of the Manor Cartier seemed to come out of a dream as men\nand women applauded, and cries arose of “Bravo, M’sieu’ Jean Jacques!”",
        "At any other time this would have made Jean Jacques nod and smile, or\nwave a hand, or exclaim in good fellowship.  Now, however, his eyes were\nfull of trouble, and the glassiness of the semi-trance leaving them, they\nshifted restlessly here and there.  Suddenly they fastened on the little\ngroup of which Judge Carcasson was the centre.  He had stopped his horses\nalmost beside them.",
        "“Ah!” he said, “ah!” as his eyes rested on the Judge.  “Ah!” he again\nexclaimed, as the glance ran from the Judge to Sebastian Dolores.  “Ah,\nmercy of God!” he added, in a voice which had both a low note and a high\nnote-deep misery and shrill protest in one.  Then he seemed to choke, and\nwords would not come, but he kept looking, looking at Sebastian Dolores,\nas though fascinated and tortured by the sight of him.",
        "“What is it, Jean Jacques?” asked the little Clerk of the Court gently,\ncoming forward and laying a hand on the steaming flank of a spent and\ntrembling pony.",
        "As though he could not withdraw his gaze from Sebastian Dolores, Jean\nJacques did not look at M. Fil1e; but he thrust out the long whip he\ncarried towards the father of his vanished Carmen and his Zoe’s\ngrandfather, and with the deliberation of one to whom speaking was like\nthe laceration of a nerve he said: “Zoe’s run away–gone–gone!”",
        "At that moment Louis Charron, his cousin, at whose house Gerard Fynes had\nlodged, came down the street galloping his horse.  Seeing the red wagon,\nhe made for it, and drew rein.",
        "“It’s no good, Jean Jacques,” he called.  “They’re married and gone to\nMontreal–married right under our noses by the Protestant minister at\nTerrebasse Junction.  I’ve got the telegram here from the stationmaster\nat Terrebasse.  .  .  .  Ah, the villain to steal away like that–only a\nchild–from her own father!  Here it is–the telegram.  But believe me,\nan actor, a Protestant and a foreigner–what a devil’s mess!”",
        "He waved the telegram towards Jean Jacques.",
        "“Did he owe you anything, Louis?” asked old Mere Langlois, whose\npractical mind was alert to find the material status of things.",
        "“Not a sou.  Well, but he was honest, I’ll say that for the rogue and\nseducer.”",
        "“Seducer–ah, God choke you with your own tongue!” cried Jean Jacques,\nturning on Louis Charron with a savage jerk of the whip he held.  “She is\nas pure–”",
        "“It is no marriage, of course!” squeaked a voice from the crowd.",
        "“It’ll be all right among the English, won’t it, monsieur le juge?\"\nasked the gentle widow of Palass Poucette, whom the scene seemed to rouse\nout of her natural shyness.",
        "“Most sure, madame, most sure,” answered the Judge.  “It will be all\nright among the English, and it is all right among the French so far as\nthe law is concerned.  As for the Church, that is another matter.  But–\nbut see,” he added addressing Louis Charron, “does the station-master say\nwhat place they took tickets for?”",
        "“Montreal and Winnipeg,” was the reply.  “Here it is in the telegram.\nWinnipeg–that’s as English as London.”",
        "“Winnipeg–a thousand miles!” moaned Jean Jacques.",
        "With the finality which the tickets for Winnipeg signified, the shrill\npanic emotion seemed to pass from him.  In its mumbling, deadening force\nit was like a sentence on a prisoner.",
        "As many eyes were on Sebastian Dolores as on Jean Jacques.  “It’s the bad\nblood that was in her,” said a farmer with a significant gesture towards\nSebastian Dolores.",
        "“A little bad blood let out would be a good thing,” remarked a truculent\nriver-driver, who had given evidence directly contrary to that given by\nSebastian Dolores in the trial just concluded.  There was a savage look\nin his eye.",
        "Sebastian Dolores heard, and he was not the man to invite trouble.  He\ncould do no good where he was, and he turned to leave the market-place;\nbut in doing so he sought the eye of Virginie Poucette, who, however,\nkept her face at an angle from him, as she saw Mere Langlois sharply\nwatching her.",
        "“Grandfather, mother and daughter, all of a piece!” said a spiteful\nwoman, as Sebastian Dolores passed her.  The look he gave her was not the\nsame as that he had given to Palass Poucette’s widow.  If it had been\ngiven by a Spanish inquisitor to a heretic, little hope would have\nremained in the heretic’s heart.  Yet there was a sad patient look on his\nface, as though he was a martyr.  He had no wish to be a martyr; but he\nhad a feeling that for want of other means of expressing their sympathy\nwith Jean Jacques, these rough people might tar and feather him at least;\nthough it was only his misfortune that those sprung from his loins had\nsuch adventurous spirits!",
        "Sebastian Dolores was not without a real instinct regarding things.  What\nwas in his mind was also passing through that of the river-driver and a\nfew of his friends, and they carefully watched the route he was taking.",
        "Jean Jacques prepared to depart.  He had ever loved to be the centre of a\npicture, but here was a time when to be in the centre was torture.  Eyes\nof morbid curiosity were looking at the open wounds of his heart-ragged\nwounds made by the shrapnel of tragedy and treachery, not the clean\nwounds got in a fair fight, easily healed.  For the moment at least the\nlittle egoist was a mere suffering soul–an epitome of shame, misery and\ndisappointment.  He must straightway flee the place where he was tied to\nthe stake of public curiosity and scorn.  He drew the reins tighter, and\nthe horses straightened to depart.  Then it was that old Judge Carcasson\nlaid a hand on his knee.",
        "“Come, come,” he said to the dejected and broken little man, “where is\nyour philosophy?”",
        "Jean Jacques looked at the Judge, as though with a new-born suspicion\nthat henceforth the world would laugh at him, and that Judge Carcasson\nwas setting the fashion; but seeing a pitying moisture in the other’s\neyes, he drew himself up, set his jaw, and calling on all the forces at\nhis command, he said:",
        "“Moi je suis philosophe!”",
        "His voice frayed a little on the last word, but his head was up now.\nThe Clerk of the Court would have asked to accompany him to the Manor\nCartier, but he was not sure that Jean Jacques would like it.  He had a\nfeeling that Jean Jacques would wish to have his dark hour alone.  So he\nremained silent, and Jean Jacques touched his horses with the whip.\nAfter starting, however, and having been followed for a hundred yards or\nso by the pitying murmurs and a few I-told-you-so’s and revilings for\nhaving married as he did, Jean Jacques stopped the ponies.  Standing up\nin the red wagon he looked round for someone whom, for a moment, he did\nnot see in the slowly shifting crowd.",
        "Philosophy was all very well, and he had courageously given his\nallegiance to it, or a formula of it, a moment before; but there was\nsomething deeper and rarer still in the little man’s soul.  His heart\nhungered for the two women who had been the joy and pride of his life,\neven when he had been lost in the business of the material world.  They\nwere more to him than he had ever known; they were parts of himself which\nhad slowly developed, as the features and characteristics of ancestors\ngradually emerge and are emphasized in a descendant as his years\nincrease.  Carmen and Zoe were more a part of himself now than they had\never been.",
        "They were gone, the living spirits of his home.  Anything that reminded\nhim of them, despite the pain of the reminder, was dear to him.  Love was\ngreater than the vengeful desire of injured human nature.  His eyes\nwandered over the people, over the market.  At last he saw what he was\nlooking for.  He called.  A man turned.  Jean Jacques beckoned to him.\nHe came eagerly, he hurried to the red wagon.",
        "“Come home with me,” said Jean Jacques.",
        "The words were addressed to Sebastian Dolores, who said to himself that\nthis was a refuge surer than “The Red Eagle,” or the home of the widow\nPoucette.  He climbed in beside Jean Jacques with a sigh of content.",
        "“Ah, but that–but that is the end of our philosopher,” said Judge\nCarcasson sadly to the Clerk of the Court, as with amazement he saw this\ncatastrophe.",
        "“Alas!  if I had only asked to go with him, as I wished to do!\"\nresponded M. Fille.  “There, but a minute ago, it was in my mind,” he\nadded with a look of pain.",
