        "I returned to the McCulloch to give directions for the landing\nof the luggage and war materials which I brought over with me\nfrom Hongkong. On my way to the McCulloch I met several of my\nold associates in the 1896 revolution who had come over from Bataan\nprovince. To these friends I gave two letters directing the people\nof that province and Zambales to rise against the Spaniards and\nvigorously attack them.",
        "Before returning to the Arsenal and when near the landing place\nI came across several bancas [large open boats] loaded with\nrevolutionists of Kawit (my birth-place) who told me they had been\nlooking out for me for about two weeks, the Americans having announced\nthat I would soon return to the islands. The feeling of joy which\nI experienced on the occasion of this reunion with my own kith and\nkin–people who had stood shoulder to shoulder with me in the desperate\nstruggles of the 1896-97 revolution–is simply indescribable. Words\nfail to express my feelings–joy mingled with sadness and strong\ndetermination to accomplish the salvation, the emancipation, of my\nbeloved countrymen. Hardly had I set foot in the Naval Headquarters\nat Cavite, at 4 o’clock in the afternoon, than I availed myself of\nthe opportunity to give these faithful adherents orders similar to\nthose despatched to Bataan and Zambales.",
        "I was engaged the whole of that night with my companions drawing up\norders and circulars for the above mentioned purpose.",
        "We were also kept very busy replying to letters which were pouring\nin from all sides asking for news respecting the reported return of\nmyself to the islands and requesting definite instructions regarding\na renewal of hostilities against the Spaniards.",
        "That the invisible, albeit irresistible, hand of Providence was\nguiding every movement and beneficently favouring all efforts to rid\nthe country of the detestable foreign yoke is fairly evidenced by the\nrapid sequence of events above recorded, for in no other way can one\naccount for the wonderful celebrity with which news of my projected\nreturn spread far and wide.",
        "Sixty-two Volunteers, organized and armed by the Spaniards with\nMausers and Remingtons, from San Roque and Caridad, placed themselves\nunder my orders. At first the Americans apprehended some danger from\nthe presence of this armed force, which was promptly placed on guard\nat the entrance to the Arsenal. When I heard of this I went down and\ngave them orders to occupy Dalajican, thereby preventing the Spaniards\nfrom carrying out their intention to approach Cavite by that route.",
        "When the Americans were informed of what I had done they were\nreassured, and orders were given to the Captain of the Petrel to\nhand over to me the 62 rifles and ammunition which Admiral Dewey had\nkindly promised. About 10 a.m. the Petrel’s launch landed the arms\nand ammunition in question at the Arsenal and no time was lost in\ndistributing the arms among the men who were by this time coming in\never increasing numbers to offer their services to me and expressing\ntheir willingness to be armed and assigned for duty at the outposts\nand on the firing line.",
        "During the evening of the 20th May the old Revolutionary officer\nSr. Luciano San Miguel (now a General in command of a Brigade)\ncame to me and asked for orders, which were given to him to effect\nthe uprising of the provinces of Manila, Laguna, Batangas, Tayabas,\nBulakan, Morong, Pampanga, Tarlak, Newva Ecija and other northern\nprovinces. He left the same night to execute the orders.",
        "During the 21st, 22nd and 23rd and subsequent days of that month my\nheadquarters were simply besieged by my countrymen, who poured into\nCavite from all sides to offer their services in the impending struggle\nwith the Spaniards. To such an extent, indeed, were my quarters in the\nArsenal invaded that I soon found it necessary to repair to another\nhouse in the town, leaving the place entirely at the disposal of the\nU.S. Marines, who were then in charge of and guarding Cavite Arsenal.",
