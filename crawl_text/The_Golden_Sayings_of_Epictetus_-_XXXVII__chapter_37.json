        "Yet God hath placed by the side of each a man’s own Guardian\nSpirit,(4) who is charged to watch over him—a Guardian who\nsleeps not nor is deceived. For to what better or more watchful\nGuardian could He have committed each of us? So when you have\nshut the doors and made a darkness within, remember never to say\nthat you are alone; for you are not alone, but God is within,\nand your Guardian Spirit, and what light do they need to behold\nwhat you do? To this God you also should have sworn allegiance,\neven as soldiers unto Caesar. They, when their service is hired,\nswear to hold the life of Caesar dearer than all else: and will\nyou not swear your oath, that are deemed worthy of so many and\ngreat gifts? And will you not keep your oath when you have sworn\nit? And what oath will you swear? Never to disobey, never to\narraign or murmur at aught that comes to you from His hand: never\nunwillingly to do or suffer aught that necessity lays upon you.",
        "“Is this oath like theirs?”",
