        "It is in the hope of directing you to your market that this chapter\nis designed.  But there is no form of writing for which it is more\ndifficult to point out a sure market than for vaudeville material.\nEven the legitimate stage–with its notorious shifting of plans\nto meet every veering wind–is not more fickle than the vaudeville\nstage.  The reason for this is, of course, to be found in the fact\nthat the stage must mirror the mind of the nation, and the national\nmind is ever changing.  But once let the public learn to love what\nyou have given them, and they will not jilt your offering in a\nday.  The great advantage the writer of vaudeville material today\nhas over every one of his predecessors, lies in the fact that the\nmodern methods of handling the vaudeville business lend him security\nin the profits of his success.",
        "(a) The acceptable manuscript forms into which all vaudeville\nmaterial may be cast may be learned by consulting the examples\nof the different vaudeville acts given in the appendix to this\nvolume.  A moment’s examination of them will show you that there\nis no difference between the manuscript ways of presenting the\ndifferent acts.  All are made up of the names of characters,\nbusiness and dialogue.  Therefore they may all be discussed at the\nsame time.",
        "(b) Have your manuscript typewritten. This suggestion has the\nforce of law.  While it would seem self-evident that a manuscript\nwritten out in long hand has a mussy appearance, however neat the\nwriting may be, the many hand-written manuscripts I have tried to\nread suggest the necessity for pointing out this fact.  You surely\nhandicap your manuscript by offering it in long hand to a busy\nproducer.",
        "(c) The two recognized methods for the typing of stage manuscripts.\nFirst, the entire manuscript is typed in black, blue or purple.\nThen, after the manuscript is complete, the name of the character\nabove each speech is underlined in red ink, and every bit of\nbusiness throughout the manuscript is also underlined in red.\nThis method is illustrated below.",
        "[Here, text originally underlined in red appear in all CAPS.]",
        "Second, a typewriter using two colors is employed.  The name of\nthe character above each speech is typed in red, and red is used\nto type the bits of business.  The speeches alone are typed in\nblack, blue or purple as the case may be.  The following example\nillustrates this method.",
        "Either of these methods serves the same purpose equally well.  The\naim is to separate the names and business from the dialogue, so\nthat the difference may be plain at a glance.  The use of either\nof these ways of typing a manuscript is desirable, but not absolutely\nnecessary.",
        "(d) Use a “record ribbon” in typewriting manuscript, because a\n“copying ribbon “ smudges easily and will soil the hands of the\nreader.  Observation of this mechanical point is a big help in\nkeeping a manuscript clean–and respecting the temper of your\njudge.",
        "(e) Neatness is a prime requisite in any manuscript offered for\nsale.  Be sure that the finished copy is free from erasures and\npenciled after-thoughts.  “Do all your after-thinking beforehand,\"\nor have a clean, new copy made.",
        "(f) Re-copy a soiled manuscript as soon as it shows evidence of\nhandling.  Keep your “silent salesman” fresh in appearance.",
        "(g) Bind your manuscript in a flexible cover to give it a neat\nappearance and make it handy to read.",
        "(h) Type your name and address in full on the outside of the\ncover, and on the first white page.  Thus you stamp the manuscript\nas your act, and it always bears your address in case of loss.",
        "(i) Have your act copyrighted is a bit of advice that would seem\nneedless, but many performers and producers refuse to read an act\nunless it is copyrighted.  The copyright–while it is not as good\nproof in court as a public performance–is nevertheless a record\nthat on such and such a date the author deposited in the Library\nof Congress a certain manuscript.  This record can be produced as\nincontrovertible evidence of fact.  The view of the performer and\nthe producer is that he wishes to protect the author as much as\npossible–but himself more.  He desires to place beyond all\npossibility any charge of plagiarism.  Therefore, copyright the\nfinal version of your act and typewrite on the cover the date of\ncopyright and the serial number.",
        "(j) How to copyright the manuscript of a vaudeville act. Write\nto the Register of Copyrights, Library of Congress, Washington,\nD.C., asking him to send you the blank form prescribed by law to\ncopyright an unpublished dramatic composition.  Do not send stamps,\nas it is unnecessary.  In addition to the blank you will receive\nprinted instructions for filling it out, and full information\ncovering the copyright process.  The fee is one dollar, which\nincludes a certificate of copyright entry.  This covers copyright\nin the United States only; if you desire to copyright in a foreign\ncountry, consult a lawyer.",
        "(k) The preparation of a scene plot should not be a difficult\ntask if you will remember that you need merely draw a straight-line\ndiagram–such as are shown in the chapter on “The Vaudeville Stage\nand its Dimensions\"–so as to make your word-description perfectly\nclear.  On this diagram it is customary to mark the position of\nchairs, tables, telephones and other properties incidental to the\naction of the story.  But a diagram is not absolutely necessary.\nWritten descriptions will be adequate, if they are carefully and\nconcisely worded.",
        "(l) The preparation of property plots and light plots has been\nmentioned in the chapter on “The Vaudeville Stage and Its Dimensions,\"\ntherefore they require a word here.  They are merely a list of the\nproperties required and directions for any changes of lighting\nthat may occur in the act.  For a first presentation of a manuscript,\nit is quite unnecessary for you to bother about the technical plots\n(arrangement plans) of the stage.  If your manuscript is acceptable,\nyou may be quite sure that the producer will supply these plots\nhimself.",
        "(m) Do not offer “parts” with your manuscript. A “part” consists\nof the speeches and business indicated for one character, written\nout in full, with the cues given by the other characters–the whole\nbound so as to form a handy copy for the actor to study.  For\ninstance, there would be four “parts” in a four-people playlet\nmanuscript–therefore you would be offering a producer five\nmanuscripts in all, and the bulk of your material might deter a\nbusy man from reading it carefully.  If your manuscript progresses\nin its sale to the point where parts are desired, the producer\nwill take care of this detail for you.  And until you have made a\nsale, it is a waste of money to have parts made.",
        "Unlike nearly every other specialized business, there is a market\nin each city of the country for vaudeville material.  This market\nis the stage door of the vaudeville theatre.  While it would be\nunlikely that a dramatist would find a market for a long play at\nthe “legitimate” stage door–although this has happened–there are\npeculiar reasons why the stage door may be your market-place.  A\nlarge percentage of vaudeville performers are the owners of their\nown acts.  They buy the material, produce it themselves, and play\nin it themselves.  And they are ever on the lookout for new material.",
        "Not only is there a market at the stage door, but that market\nchanges continually.  Without fear of exaggeration it may be said\nthat with the weekly and sometimes semi-weekly changes of the bill\nin each house, there will in time flow past the stage door nearly\nall the acts which later appear in vaudeville.",
        "Offering a manuscript at the stage door, however, should not be\ndone without preparation.  As you would not rush up to a business\nman on the street or spring at him when he emerges from his office\ndoor, you certainly would not care to give a vaudeville performer\nthe impression that you were lying in wait for him.",
        "(a) The personal introduction is a distinct advantage in any\nbusiness, therefore it would be an advantage for you to secure,\nif possible, a personal introduction to the performer.  However,\nyou must be as discriminating in choosing the person to make that\nintroduction as you would were you selecting an endorser at a bank.\nA stage-hand or an usher is likely to do you more harm than good.\nThe “mash notes” they may have carried “back stage” would discount\ntheir value for you.  The manager of the theatre, however, might\narrange an introduction that would be of value.  At least he can\nfind out for you if the performer is in the market at the time.",
        "(b) The preliminary letter is never amiss, therefore it would\nseem advisable to write to the performer for whom you feel sure\nyou have an act that will fit.  Make the letter short.  Simply ask\nhim if he is in the market for material, state that you have an\nact that you would like him to read, and close by requesting an\nappointment at his convenience.",
        "Do not take up his time by telling him what a fine act you have.\nHe does not know you, and if you praise it too highly he may be\ninclined to believe that you do not have anything worth while.\nBut do not under-rate your material, either, in the hope of engaging\nhis attention by modesty.  Leave it for him to find out if you\nhave an act, first, that is worth while, and second, that fits him.",
        "If you do not hear from the performer, you may be sure that he is\nnot interested in your act.  He may be out for the first few weeks\nin a brand new act, and not in the market at all.  So if you do\nnot hear from him, wait until another act comes along and you see\nsomeone for whom your act is “just made.”",
        "(c) Should you receive a favorable reply to your request for an\nappointment, you may be reasonably sure that your prospective\npurchaser at least needs a new act.  In meeting your appointment,\nbe on time, and have someone with you.  A woman, of course, would\nhave a chaperon, precisely as she would if she were meeting any\nother stranger.  And a man might care to have someone to engage\nthe attention of the performer’s companion and leave him an\nuninterrupted opportunity to talk business.",
        "(d) Ask for an immediate reading of your manuscript, or at least\nrequest it read the next day, when you can be present while he is\nreading it.  Do not leave a manuscript to be returned to you by\nmail.  Vaudeville performers are as honest as any other class of\nmen, but they are busy people and the thing that is put off is\nforgotten.  They are in one town today and miles away tomorrow,\nand they may leave the manuscript on the bureau of their hotel\nroom intending to mail it at the last minute–and rush away and\nforget it.  Therefore you should ask for an immediate reading.\nIt will take a performer only a few minutes to decide if he cares\nto consider your act.  He knows of what he is in need–and usually\nis prepared to tell you.",
        "(e) Do not ask for specific criticism, for of all people in the\nworld vaudeville performers are the most good-hearted.  They would\nrather please you than hurt you.  They will evade the point nine\ntimes out of ten; so save them and yourself needless embarrassment.\nAnd thus you may also avoid a false valuation of your manuscript.",
        "(f) If the performer cannot use the act himself, and if the act\npossesses merit, the chances are that he will suggest some other\nperformer who might want it.  If he does not suggest someone\nhimself, ask him.  Vaudeville performers know what other performers\nwant, because they are continually discussing plans for “next\nseason.”  You may thus pick up some valuable information, even if\nyou do not dispose of the particular manuscript you have for sale.",
        "While you are likely at many turns of the sales road to have offered\nyou an opportunity to produce your own act, this method of finding\na market is rarely advisable.  You would not start a little magazine\nto get your short-story into print; your story could not possess\nthat much value even if it were a marvel–how much less so if you\nwere unable to find someone willing to buy it!",
        "But there is a still more important reason why you should not rush\ninto producing your act yourself.  Producing is a specialized\nbusiness, requiring wide experience and exact knowledge.  Besides,\nit is one of the most expensive pastimes in the world.  Without a\nmost comprehensive experience and peculiar abilities, failure is\nsure.  Do not attempt private production even if you are offered\nthe services of a performer or a producer in whom you have absolute\nfaith.  Remember, if they thought your act was really worth while\nthey would be anxious to reap the profits for themselves.",
        "While any performer who owns his act is a producer in the sense\nthat he “produces” his act, there are men who make a business of\nbuying manuscripts, engaging people, and producing many acts in\nwhich they do not themselves play.  Producers who may own a dozen\nacts of all different kinds would seem to offer to the writer for\nvaudeville an ideal market.  How, then, is the writer to get in\ntouch with them?",
        "(a) Selling through a Play broker is a method that is precisely\nthe same as though you consigned a bill of goods to a commission\nagent, and paid him for disposing of it.  The play broker reads\nyour manuscript and engages to try to dispose of it for you, or\nreturns it as not likely to fit in with the particular line of\nbusiness of which he makes a specialty.  If your act is really\ngood and yet the broker is able to make some suggestions that will\nimprove it, he is likely to offer such suggestions, purely in the\nhope of earning a commission, and in this way he may prove of\ndistinct value as a critic.  In any event, if he accepts a manuscript\nto sell for you, he will offer it in the quarters he thinks most\nlikely to produce it and will attend to all the business incidental\nto the making of the contract.",
        "For this service the broker charges a ten per cent commission.\nThis commission is paid either on the price of outright sale, or\non the royalty account.  If the act is sold on royalty, he will\ncollect the customary advance and also the weekly payments.  After\ndeducting his commission, he will remit the balance to you.",
        "On the last page of this chapter you will find a partial list of\nwell-known play brokers.  Although I do not know of any who deal\nexclusively in vaudeville material, any one of the agents who handles\nlong plays is glad to handle an exceptionally fine playlet.",
        "(b) Seeking a personal interview with a producer is usually\nproductive of one result:  The office-boy says, “Leave your manuscript,\nand he’ll read it and let you know.”  Anxious as he is to secure\ngood material, a man who is busily engaged in producing vaudeville\nacts has little time to spend on granting personal interviews.\nAnd there is another reason–he fears you will try to read your\nact to him.  A personal reading by the author is either a most\ndistressing affair, because the average writer cannot read stage\nmaterial as it should be read, or else it is very dangerous to the\nlistener’s judgment.  Many a producer has been tricked into producing\nan act whose merits a masterly reader has brought out so finely\nthat its fatal faults were forgotten.  And so the producer prefers\nto read a manuscript himself.  Alone in his office he can concentrate\non the act in hand, and give to it the benefit of his best judgment.",
        "(c) Offering a manuscript by mail is perfectly safe.  There has\nnever come to my knowledge one clearly proved instance of where a\nproducer has “stolen an idea.”",
        "(d) Send your manuscript by registered mail and demand a return\nreceipt.  Thus you will save losses in the mail and hold a check\nagainst the loss of your manuscript in the producer’s office.  And\nwhen you send your manuscript by mail, invariably enclose stamps\nto pay the return to you by registered delivery.  Better still,\nenclose a self-addressed envelope with enough postage affixed to\ninsure both return and registry.",
        "(e) Three weeks for consideration is about the usual time the\naverage producer requires to read a manuscript at his leisure.\nIn times when a producer is actively engaged in putting on an act,\nhe may not have an hour in the week he can call his own.  Therefore\nhave patience, and if you do not receive a reply from him in three\nweeks, write again and courteously remind him that you would like\nto have his decision at his earliest convenience.  Impatient letters\ncan only harm your chance.",
        "What money can be made by writing vaudeville material?  This is\ncertainly the most interesting question the writer for vaudeville\ncan ask.  Like the prices of diamonds, the prices of vaudeville\nacts depend on quality.  Every individual act, and each kind of\nact, commands its own special price.  There are two big questions\ninvolved in the pricing of every vaudeville manuscript.  First,\nof what value is the act itself?  Second, what can the performer\nor the producer afford to payor be made to pay for the act?",
        "The first question cannot be answered for even a class of acts.\nThe value of each individual act determines its own price.  And\neven here there enters the element inherent in all stage material–\na doubt of value until performance before an audience proves the\nworth of the act.  For this reason, it is customary for the purchaser\nof a vaudeville act to require that it first make good, before he\npays for it.  “Try and then buy,” is the average vaudevillian’s\nmotto.  If you are a good business man you will secure an advance\nagainst royalty of just as much as you can make the producer “give\nup.”  Precisely as in every other business, the price of service\ndepends upon the individual’s ability to “make a deal.”",
        "The answer to the second question likewise depends upon the\nvaudeville writer’s individual ability as a business man.  No hints\ncan be given you other than those that you may glean from a\nconsideration of average and record prices in the following\nparagraphs.",
        "(a) The monologue is usually sold outright.  The performer nearly\nalways will tell you–with no small degree of truth–that the\nmonologist makes the monologue, not the monologue the monologist.\nMany a monologue has sold for five dollars, and the purchaser been\n“stung” at that price.  But very rarely is a monologue bought\noutright in manuscript–that is, before a try-out.  A monologue\nmust prove itself “there,” before a monologist will pay any more\nthan a small advance for the exclusive privilege of trying it out.",
        "If the monologue proves itself, an outright offer will be made by\nthe performer.  While there are no “regular rates,” from two hundred\nand fifty dollars to seven hundred dollars may be considered as\nsuggestive of the market value of the average successful monologue.",
        "In addition to this, the monologist usually retains the author to\nwrite new points and gags for him each week that he works.  This,\nof course, increases the return from a monologue, and insures the\nwriter a small weekly income.",
        "In very rare cases monologues are so good and, therefore, so\nvaluable that authors can retain the ownership and rent them out\nfor a weekly royalty.  In such a case, of course, the author engages\nhimself to keep the material up to the minute without extra\ncompensation.  But such monologues are so rare they can be counted\non the fingers of one hand.  There is little doubt that “The German\nSenator” is one of the most valuable monologue properties–if it\ndoes not stand in a class by itself–that has ever been written.\nFor many years it has returned to Aaron Hoffman a royalty of $100\na week, thirty and forty weeks in the year.  This may be considered\nthe record price for a monologue.",
        "(b) The vaudeville two-act varies in price as greatly as the\nmonologue.  Like the monologue, it is usually sold outright.  The\nperformers use precisely the same argument about the two-act that\nis used about the monologue.  It is maintained that the material\nitself is not to be compared with the importance of its presentation.\nWhen a two-act has been tried out and found “there,” the performers\nor the producer will offer a price for it.",
        "The same rule, that vaudeville material is worth only as much as\nit will bring, applies to the two-act.  From two hundred and fifty\ndollars to whatever you can get, may be considered suggestive of\ntwo-act prices.  Although more two-acts have sold outright for\nless than three hundred dollars than have sold above five hundred\ndollars, a successful two-act may be made to yield a far greater\nreturn if a royalty arrangement is secured.",
        "Whether it is a two-act, or any other vaudeville act, the royalty\nasking price is ten per cent of the weekly salary.  This rate is\ndifficult to enforce, and while five per cent is nearer the average,\nthe producer would rather pay a definite fixed figure each week,\nthan a percentage that must be reckoned on what may be a varying\nsalary.  Usually a compromise of a flat amount per playing week\nis made when a royalty is agreed on.",
        "(c) The playlet varies in returns amazingly.  While one small-time\nproducer pays no advance royalty and a flat weekly royalty of from\nten dollars to fifteen dollars a week–making his stand on the\nfact that he gives a longer playing season than his average\ncompetitor–many a big-time producer pays a good round advance and\nas high as $100 a week royalty.",
        "Edgar Allan Woolf has said:  “The desire for the one-act comedy is\nso great that even an unknown writer can secure an advance royalty\nas great as is paid to the author of a three-act play, if he has\nwritten a playlet which seems to possess novelty of story and\ncleverness of dialogue.”",
        "George V. Hobart is reported to have had a variously-quoted number\nof playlets playing at the same time, each one of which returned\nhim a weekly royalty of $100 a week.  And half a dozen other one-act\nplaywrights might be named who have had nearly equal success.",
        "On the other hand, Porter Emerson Brown is quoted as saying:  “The\nwork of writing a playlet is nearly as great as writing a three-act\nplay, and the returns cannot be compared.”",
        "One of the collaborators on a famous big-time success received\nforty dollars a week for three seasons as his share.  Another\nplaylet writer was paid one hundred dollars a week for one act,\nand only twenty dollars a week for another.  And a third was content\nwith a ten-dollars-a-week royalty on one act, at the same time\nthat another act of his was bringing him in fifty dollars a week.",
        "These examples I have cited to demonstrate that the return from\nthe playlet is a most variable quantity.  The small-time pays less\nthan the big-time, and each individual act on both small- and\nbig-time pays a different royalty.",
        "When a playlet–either comedy or straight dramatic–is accepted\nfor production, it is customary, although not an invariable rule,\nthat an advance royalty be paid “down.”  When the act proves\nsuccessful, one or more of three propositions may be offered the\nwriter:  outright sale at a price previously agreed upon; outright\nsale to be paid in weekly royalties until an agreed upon figure\nis reached, when ownership passes from the author to the producer;\nthe more customary weekly royalty.  As I have said before, what\nprice you receive for your act finally depends upon your keenness\nin driving a bargain.",
        "In nearly every case, outright sale has its advantage in the fact\nthat the author need not then worry about collecting his royalty.\nOf course, when a recognized producer puts out the act there need\nbe no concern about the royalty, so in such instances a royalty\nis preferable.  But in some cases, as when the performer is making\nlong jumps and has a hard time making railroad connections, a\nweekly royalty has its disadvantages in causing worry to the author.",
        "(d) The one-act musical comedy is usually bought outright–after\nthe act “gets over.”  While many a “book” is contracted for in\nadvance at a small figure, to be doubled or trebled on success,\nit is also true that royalties are paid.  In this case, the custom\nis to divide the royalty equally between the writer of the book\nand lyrics, and the composer of the music.  When a third person\nwrites the verses of the songs and ensemble numbers, the royalty\nis usually split three ways.  It would be misleading to quote any\nfigures on the musical comedy, for the reason that circumstances\nvary so greatly with each that there are no standards.",
        "(e) The burlesque tab pays about the same rates as the one-act\nmusical comedy, its kindred form.",
        "(f) The popular song, unlike the other material treated in this\nvolume, has a well established royalty price:  one cent a copy is\nthe standard.  Of this, half a cent goes to the writer of the\nlyric, and half a cent to the composer of the music.",
        "As a popular song, to be considered successful, must sell anywhere\nfrom half a million to a million copies, it is easy to estimate\nthe song-writer’s return.  If the same man writes both the words\nand the music he will receive from five to ten thousand dollars–or\ntwenty-five hundred to five thousand dollars if he divides with\nanother–for being able to make the nation whistle.  Of course,\nmany song-writers have two successful songs selling in a year–\ntherefore you may double the figures above to estimate some successful\nsong-writers’ incomes.  But it may safely be said that the song-writer\nwho has an income of twelve thousand dollars a year is doing very\nwell indeed!  There are many more professional song-writers who\nwork year after year for the salary of the average business man\nin every other line of endeavor.  Don’t count your royalty-chickens\ntoo soon.",
