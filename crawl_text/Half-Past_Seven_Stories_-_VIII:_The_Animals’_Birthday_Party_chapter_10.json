        "Birthdays are always important events, but some are more important\nthan others. The most important of all, of course, is one you can’t\nremember at all–the zero birthday, when you were born.",
        "After that, the fifth, I suppose, is the red letter day. A boy\ncertainly begins to appreciate life when he gets to be five years old.\nNext, probably, would come the seventh, for a boy–or a girl–is\npretty big by then, and able to do so many things. In old Bible days\nseven was supposed to be a sacred number, and even today many people\nthink it lucky. Why, at the baseball games the men in the stands rise\nup in the seventh inning and stretch, they say, to bring victory to\nthe home team.",
        "The seventeenth birthday is the next great event. By that time a boy\nis quite grown up and ready for college; and on the twenty-first he\ncan vote. But after that people don’t think so much of birthdays until\ntheir seventieth or so, when they become very proud of them once more.\nPerhaps they grow like little children again. Wouldn’t it be funny to\nhave, say, eighty candles on one cake? But what cook or baker makes\ncakes big enough for that?",
        "Marmaduke wasn’t looking so far ahead. All he was thinking about was\nhis own birthday, which came that fine day, his seventh; and he was\nwondering if Mother would put the seven candles on his cake, and if it\nwould turn out chocolate, which he very much hoped.",
        "About three o’clock of this same day, Mother looked out of the window\nand said “Good gracious!,” which were the very worst words she ever\nsaid; and Father looked up from the cider-press which he was mending,\nand said “By George!”, which were the very worst he ever said; and the\nToyman looked up from the sick chicken to which he was giving some\nmedicine, and said “Geewhillikens!” And whether or not that was the\nworst he ever said I do not know. I hope so.",
        "What could they be exclaiming about? Marmaduke! He was all\nalone as far as human beings went, for Jehosophat was putting\naxle-grease on his little red cart, and Hepzebiah was playing with\nHetty, her rag doll, and the rest were busy at their tasks, as we have\njust seen.",
        "But he had some fine company, oh, yes, he had. He was giving a\nbirthday party for the animals.",
        "And this is the way he persuaded all his noisy quarrelsome friends of\nthe barnyard to come to his party:",
        "First he went to the barn and filled one pocket–you see, he was a big\nboy now and had pockets–one, two, three, four, five, six, seven–one\nover his heart, two close by his belt, one on the inside of his\njacket, one on each side of his hips, and two in the back of his\ncorduroy trousers. Well, he filled pocket number one with golden\nkernels of corn from the sack; pocket number two with meal from\nanother sack; and he filled pocket number three with lettuce leaves\nfrom the garden; and number four with birdseed from a little box. That\nmakes four pockets.",
        "To fill the others, he had to make three more journeys–three very\nstrange journeys, so strange you could never guess where he was going.\nFirst he went to the wagon-shed, and there, because it was near the\nthree kennels, was kept the box of dog-biscuit. Six of these biscuits\nwent in the fifth pocket. Let’s see–yes, that leaves two more to be\nfilled.",
        "For the sixth, he went into his own little room and got a bottle with\na stopper in it, one which he had begged from the doctor that time he\nwas sick. Then he went to the springhouse by the well, and filled the\nlittle bottle with milk from the big can.",
        "But the seventh pocket had the strangest load of all. He took his\nshovel and actually dug some worms from the garden, long, wriggly\nworms–\"night-walkers,” the boys call them–and placed them in a can,\nand presto! that too went into his pocket, the seventh. And now all\nthe pockets were filled.",
        "And, mind you, he did all this by himself. And when he came back from\nall these errands he bulged out in such funny places, the places where\nhe had stuffed his pockets, so that he looked as if he had tremendous\nwarts or knobs all over his body.",
        "“Did you ever!” said Mother, and all three–she, the Toyman, and\nFather–kept watching, trying hard not to laugh. It paid them to watch\nhim, too, for they were going to see something worth-while, better\nthan a “movie,” better even than a circus.",
        "Well, after all the errands were over, Marmaduke collected some\nshingles, and all the cups and tins in which the Three Happy Children\nmade mud-pies. And he spread them out on the table in the summer-house\nvery carefully.",
        "Can you guess what he did that for? I don’t believe you can. I know I\ncouldn’t.",
        "Then he took his little scoopnet, and went to the pond and put the net\nin. Out it came, and in the meshes flopped and tumbled and\nsomersaulted three tiny fish.",
        "These he placed in one of the pans on the table in the summer-house,\nand then hurried to the rabbit-hutch and opened the sliding door and\ncalled,–",
        " “Come, Bunny, Bunny,\n  An’ don’t be funny!”",
        "But first we must explain that Marmaduke had a queer trick of making\nrhymes. I guess he caught it from the Toyman, who used to make lots\nfor the children, just to see them laugh. So Marmaduke got the habit.\nAnd making rhymes is just as catching as measles and whooping cough,\nonly it doesn’t hurt so much.",
        "Of course, some of Marmaduke’s rhymes weren’t very good, but he tried\nhis best, which is all you can ask of anybody. Anyway, we will have to\ntell you them just as he made them, so you can see what sort of a\nparty he had.",
        "So he said,–",
        " “Come, Bunny, Bunny,\n  An’ don’t be funny!”",
        "It didn’t mean anything much, but he just said it.",
        "And out, hippity hop, hippity hop, came the White Rabbits, making\nnoses at him in the odd way of their kind.",
        "Holding out the lettuce leaves in front of their wriggling noses, he\ncoaxed them over to the summer-house, and when they got there, he\nplaced a leaf in one of the dishes, saving the rest for the feast.",
        "And the Bunnies made funnier noses than ever and nibbled, nibbled away\nat their plates.",
        "Then he called out loud,–",
        " “Here chick, chick, chick,\n  Come quick, quick, quick!”",
        "And all the White Wyandottes came running. Mother Wyandotte and all\nthe little ones, and all their relatives, hurrying like fat old women\ntrying to catch the trolley car. Even lordly Father Wyandotte himself\nstalked along a little faster than usual, and I guess the Big Gold\nRooster on the top of the barn tried to fly down too, but he was\npinned up there tight on the roof, and so couldn’t accept the\ninvitation, much to his grave dissatisfaction.",
        "Marmaduke put only one or two kernels of corn from his first pocket,\nin the plates for the White Wyandottes, to hold them there until the\nrest of the guests could come. He wanted to get them all together and\nmake a speech to them, the way Deacon Slithers did when they gave a\npurse of gold to the minister. He was going to present himself with\nsomething at that speech. He had it all planned out, you see.",
        "So next he called the Pretty Pink Pigeons from their house on the top\nof the barn.",
        " “Coo, coo,\n  There’s some for you.”",
        "And the Pretty Pink Pigeons accepted his invitation very quickly, and\nhe tempted them, too, all the way to the summer-house, with a little\nof the bird-seed from the fourth pocket.",
        "And then he called,–",
        " “Goose, Goose, Goose–”",
        "At first he couldn’t think of anything nice for them, but just kept\ncalling, “Goose, Goose, Goose,” over and over until he thought up a\nbright idea–a fine rhyme,–",
        " “You’ve no excuse.”",
        "And then to the Turkey,–",
        " “Turkey, come to my party,\n  If you don’t, you’re a smarty.”",
        "Sort of silly, wasn’t it?–but, no, I guess that was pretty good.",
        "Then he yelled,–",
        " “Here Pussy Cat, Pussy Cat,\n  You’ll have a bite of that.”",
        "And–",
        " “Wienie and Brownie and Rover,\n  Come ’n over, come ’n over, come ’n over!”",
        "And at last,–",
        " “Here, little fish,\n  Is a nice little dish.”",
        "All things considered, he did pretty well, didn’t he?",
        "Now he emptied all the different kinds of food, from his seven\ndifferent pockets, on the little shingles and the little dishes on the\ntable in the summer-house.",
        "There was corn for the White Wyandottes and Mr. Stuckup the Turkey,\nand some, too, for the Foolish White Geese; and meal for the Pretty\nPink Pigeons; and lettuce leaves for the hippity-hop white Bunnies;\nand milk from the little bottle for the Pussy; and puppy biscuit for\nthe three Dogs; and worms for the Little Fish, all placed very\npolitely in their little dishes.",
        "It was a grand party. No wonder Mother said, “Good gracious!” and “Did\nyou ever!\"; and no wonder Father whistled, and said, “By George!”, and\nthe Toyman slapped his overalls, and said “Gee-willikens!\"–and\nperhaps a lot of other things besides.",
        "But there was one serious trouble about this party. Marmaduke couldn’t\nkeep sufficient order to make that important speech, which was to have\nbeen the event of the celebration.",
        "He stood up on the bench in the summer-house, put his hands in his new\npockets, made a fine bow, and began:",
        "“Ladees and gen’lemen an’ all others, Mr. Rooster and Mrs. Rooster an’\nGeneral Turkey\"–but he could get no further.",
        "The White Wyandottes were jumping all over the table, and the Pretty\nPink Pigeons, who were very tame, were trying to get in his pockets\nfor more of the feast; and Rover and Brownie and Wienerwurst were\njumping up and trying to lick his face; and his grand speech turned\nout something like this:",
        "“Down, Rover! Get away, you crazy Geese! Stop that, Bunny! Stop it, I\nsay–scat!!–scat!!!–”",
        "Well, by this time Wienerwurst was biting the tails of the Pretty Pink\nPigeons again; and Brownie was chasing the rabbits; and the Geese were\nflapping their wings and crying, “hiss, hiss!\"; and the Pigeons were\nflying back to their home on the roof; and Rover had his mouth full of\nWhite Geese feathers; and Tabby was swallowing the little\nfish–and–and–Marmaduke was almost crying.",
        "“I’ll take it all back,” he yelled, “you’re no ladies and gen’lemen\nyou’re–you’re just mean an’ I won’t ever ask you to my party again.”",
        "Of course, by this time, Mother and the Toyman and Father weren’t just\nstanding still and looking and saying things–they were\nrunning–and–saying things!–running straight for that party which\nhad turned out such a grand fight.",
        "They tried to save what they could from the wreck. They spanked little\nWienerwurst until he let go of the tails of the Pretty Pink Pigeons,\nand they got the Bunnies safe back in their hutch, and the White\nWyandottes in their yard, and Mr. Turkey in his.",
        "But they couldn’t save the poor little fish. It was very sad, but it\nwas too late. Tabby wasn’t like Jonah’s whale. What she had once\nswallowed she wasn’t apt to give up.",
        "[Illustration: “’I’ll take it all back,’ Marmaduke yelled, ’you’re no\nladies an’ gen’lemen–an’ I won’t ever ask you to my party again’\"]",
        "Marmaduke felt very much hurt and very indignant about the way he had\nbeen treated. As Father said, “it was a grave slight to his\nhospitality.”",
        "However, he forgot all about it when he saw the new skates which\nMother and Father had waiting for him, and the grand Noah’s Ark which\nthe Toyman had made with his very own hands. There isn’t much use\ntelling the colors in which it was painted, because you know the\nToyman was sure to put a lot of colors, and pretty ones, too, on all\nthe things he made for the Three Happy Children.",
        "There is one good thing about all the animals in that Noah’s Ark. They\nare very cunning and look like the real thing, but, as the Toyman\nsaid, “You can invite them to your house any time and they won’t\nfight, or bite, or scratch, or quarrel. They are very polite and\nwell-behaved.”",
        "Marmaduke had many a celebration for them, and made many a glorious\nspeech to them as well, and they listened to every word.",
        "So the birthday party really lasted long after the seven candles had\ngone out, and the cake had gone, too, every crumb.",
