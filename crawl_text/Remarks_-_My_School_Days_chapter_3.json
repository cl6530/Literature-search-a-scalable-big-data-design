        "Looking over my own school days, there are so many things that I would\nrather not tell, that it will take very little time and space for me to\nuse in telling what I am willing that the carping public should know about\nmy early history.",
        "I began my educational career in a log school house. Finding that other\ngreat men had done that way, I began early to look around me for a log\nschool house where I could begin in a small way to soak my system full of\nhard words and information.",
        "For a time I learned very rapidly. Learning came to me with very little\neffort at first. I would read my lesson over once or twice and then take\nmy place in the class. It never bothered me to recite my lesson and so I\nstood at the head of the class. I could stick my big toe through a\nknot-hole in the floor and work out the most difficult problem. This\nbecame at last a habit with me. With my knot-hole I was safe, without it I\nwould hesitate.",
        "A large red-headed boy, with feet like a summer squash and eyes like those\nof a dead codfish, was my rival. He soon discovered that I was very\ndependent on that knot-hole, and so one night he stole into the school\nhouse and plugged up the knot-hole, so that I could not work my toe into\nit and thus refresh my memory.",
        "Then the large red-headed boy, who had not formed the knot-hole habit went\nto the head of the class and remained there.",
        "After I grew larger, my parents sent me to a military school. That is\nwhere I got the fine military learning and stately carriage that I still\nwear.",
        "My room was on the second floor, and it was very difficult for me to leave\nit at night, because the turnkey locked us up at 9 o’clock every evening.\nStill, I used to get out once in a while and wander around in the\nstarlight. I did not know yet why I did it, but I presume it was a kind of\nsomnambulism. I would go to bed thinking so intently of my lessons that I\nwould get up and wander away, sometimes for miles, in the solemn night.",
        "One night I awoke and found myself in a watermelon patch. I was never so\nashamed in my life. It is a very serious thing to be awakened so rudely\nout of a sound sleep, by a bull dog, to find yourself in the watermelon\nvineyard of a man with whom you are not acquainted. I was not on terms of\nsocial intimacy with this man or his dog. They did not belong to our set.\nWe had never been thrown together before.",
        "After that I was called the great somnambulist and men who had watermelon\nconservatories shunned me. But it cured me of my somnambulism. I have\nnever tried to somnambule any more since that time.",
        "There are other little incidents of my schooldays that come trooping up in\nmy memory at this moment, but they were not startling in their nature.\nMine is but the history of one who struggled on year after year, trying to\ndo better, but most always failing to connect. The boys of Boston would do\nwell to study carefully my record and then–do differently.",
