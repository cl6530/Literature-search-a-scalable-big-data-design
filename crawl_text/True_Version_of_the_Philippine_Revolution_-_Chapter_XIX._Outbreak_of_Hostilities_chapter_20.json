        "While I, the Government, the Congress and the entire populace were\nawaiting the arrival of such a greatly desired reply, many fairly\noverflowing with pleasant thoughts, there came the fatal day of\nthe 4th February, during the night of which day the American forces\nsuddenly attacked all our lines, which were in fact at the time almost\ndeserted, because being Saturday, the day before a regular feast day,\nour Generals and some of the most prominent officers had obtained\nleave to pass the Sabbath with their respective families.",
        "General Pantaleon Garcia was the only one who at such a critical\nmoment was at his post in Maypajo, north of Manila, Generals Noriel,\nRizal and Ricarte and Colonels San Miguel, Cailles and others being\naway enjoying their leave.",
        "General Otis, according to trustworthy information, telegraphed to\nWashington stating that the Filipinos had attacked the American\nArmy. President McKinley read aloud the telegram in the Senate,\nwhere the Treaty of Paris of the 10th December, 1898, was being\ndiscussed with a view to its ratification, the question of annexation\nof the Philippines being the chief subject of debate, and through\nthis criminal procedure secured the acceptation of the said Treaty\nin toto by a majority of only three votes, [7] which were cast\nsimultaneously with a declaration that the voters sided with the\n“Ayes” on account of war having broken out in these Islands.",
        "This singular comedy could not continue for a great length of time\nbecause the Filipinos could never be the aggressors as against the\nAmerican forces, with whom we had sworn eternal friendship and in\nwhose power we expected to find the necessary protection to enable\nus to obtain recognition of our independence from the other Powers.",
        "The confusion and obfuscation of the first moments was indeed great,\nbut before long it gave place to the light of Truth which shone forth\nserene, bringing forth serious reflections.",
        "When sensible people studied the acts of Mr. McKinley, sending\nreinforcement after reinforcement to Manila at a time after an\narmistice was agreed upon and even when peace with Spain prevailed;\nwhen they took into account that the despatch of the Civil Commission\nto settle terms of a treaty of amity with the Filipinos was being\ndelayed; when, too, they knew of the antecedents of my alliance\nwith Admiral Dewey, prepared and arranged by the American Consuls of\nSingapore and Hongkong, Mr. Pratt and Mr. Wildman; when they became\nacquainted with the actual state of affairs on the 4th February knowing\nthat the Filipinos were awaiting the reply of Mr. McKinley to the\ntelegram of General Otis in which he transmitted the peaceful wish of\nthe Filipino people of live as an independent nation; when, lastly,\nthey riveted their attention to the terms of the Treaty of Paris,\nthe approval of which, in as far as it concerned the annexation of the\nPhilippines, was greeted with manifestations of joy and satisfaction\nby the Imperialist party led by Mr. McKinley, then their eyes were\nopened to the revelations of truth, clearly perceiving the base,\nselfish and inhuman policy which Mr. McKinley had followed in his\ndealings with us the Filipinos, sacrificing remorselessly to their\nunbridled ambition the honour of Admiral Dewey, exposing this worthy\ngentleman and illustrious conqueror of the Spanish fleet to universal\nridicule; for no other deduction can follow from the fact that about\nthe middle of May of 1898, the U.S.S. McCulloch brought me with\nmy revolutionary companions from Hongkong, by order of the above\nmentioned Admiral, while now actually the United States squadron is\nengaged in bombarding the towns and ports held by these revolutionists,\nwhose objective is and always has been Liberty and Independence.",
        "The facts as stated are of recent date and must still be fresh in\nthe memory of all.",
        "Those who in May, 1898, admired the courage of Admiral Dewey’s sailors\nand the humanitarianism of this illustrious Commander in granting\nvisible aid to an oppressed people to obtain freedom and independence,\nsurely cannot place an honest construction upon the present inhuman\nwar when contrasting it with those lofty and worthy sentiments.",
        "I need not dwell on the cruelty which, from the time of the\ncommencement of hostilities, has characterized General Otis’s\ntreatment of the Filipinos, shooting in secret many who declined\nto sign a petition asking for autonomy. I need not recapitulate the\nruffianly abuses which the American soldiers committed on innocent\nand defenseless people in Manila, shooting women and children simply\nbecause they were leaning out of windows; entering houses at midnight\nwithout the occupants’ permission–forcing open trunks and wardrobes\nand stealing money, jewellery and all valuables they came across;\nbreaking chairs, tables and mirrors which they could not carry away\nwith them, because, anyhow, they are consequences of the war, though\nimproper in the case of civilized forces. But what I would not leave\nunmentioned is the inhuman conduct of that General in his dealings\nwith the Filipino Army, when, to arrange a treaty of peace with the\nCivil Commission, of which Mr. Schurman was President, I thrice sent\nemissaries asking for a cessation of hostilities.",
        "General Otis refused the envoys’ fair and reasonable request, replying\nthat he would not stop hostilities so long as the Philippine Army\ndeclined to lay down their arms.",
        "But why does not this Army deserve some consideration at the hands\nof General Otis and the American forces? Had they already forgotten\nthe important service the Filipino Army rendered to the Americans in\nthe late war with Spain?",
        "Had General Otis forgotten the favours conferred on him by the Filipino\nArmy, giving up to him and his Army the suburbs and blockhouses which\nat such great sacrifice to themselves the Filipinos had occupied?",
        "Why should General Otis make such a humiliating condition a prime\nfactor or basis of terms of peace with an Army which stood shoulder to\nshoulder with the American forces, freely shedding its blood, and whose\nheroism and courage were extolled by Admiral Dewey and other Americans?",
        "This unexplained conduct of General Otis, so manifestly contrary\nto the canons of international law and military honour, is eloquent\ntestimony of his deliberate intention to neutralize the effects of\nMr. Schurman’s pacific mission.",
        "What peace can be concerted by the roaring of cannon and the whizzing\nof bullets?",
        "What is and has been the course of procedure of General Brooke in\nCuba? Are not the Cubans still armed, notwithstanding negotiations\nfor the pacification and future government of that Island are still\ngoing on?",
        "Are we, perchance, less deserving of liberty and independence than\nthose revolutionists?",
        "Oh, dear Philippines! Blame your wealth, your beauty for the stupendous\ndisgrace that rests upon your faithful sons.",
        "You have aroused the ambition of the Imperialists and Expansionists\nof North America and both have placed their sharp claws upon your\nentrails!",
        "Loved mother, sweet mother, we are here to defend your liberty and\nindependence to the death! We do not want war; on the contrary, we\nwish for peace; but honourable peace, which does not make you blush\nnor stain your forehead with shame and confusion. And we swear to you\nand promise that while America with all her power and wealth could\npossibly vanquish us; killing all of us; but enslave us, never!!!",
        "No; this humiliation is not the compact I celebrated in Singapore with\nthe American Consul Pratt. This was not the agreement stipulated for\nwith Mr. Wildman, American Consul in Hongkong. Finally, it was not\nthe subjection of my beloved country to a new alien yoke that Admiral\nDewey promised me.",
        "It is certain that these three have abandoned me, forgetting that I\nwas sought for and taken from my exile and deportation; forgetting,\nalso, that neither of these three solicited my services in behalf\nof American Sovereignty, they paying the expense of the Philippine\nRevolution for which, manifestly, they sought me and brought me back\nto your beloved bosom!",
        "If there is, as I believe, one God, the root and fountain of all\njustice and only eternal judge of international disputes, it will not\ntake long, dear mother, to save you from the hands, of your unjust\nenemies. So I trust in the honour of Admiral Dewey: So I trust in\nthe rectitude of the great people of the United States of America,\nwhere, if there are ambitious Imperialists, there are defenders of the\nhumane doctrines of the immortal Monroe, Franklin, and Washington;\nunless the race of noble citizens, glorious founders of the present\ngreatness of the North American Republic, have so degenerated that\ntheir benevolent influence has become subservient to the grasping\nambition of the Expansionists, in which latter unfortunate circumstance\nwould not death be preferable to bondage?",
        "Oh, sensible American people! Deep is the admiration of all the\nPhilippine people and of their untrained Army of the courage displayed\nby your Commanders and soldiers. We are weak in comparison with\nsuch Titanic instruments of your Government’s ambitious Caesarian\npolicy and find it difficult to effectively resist their courageous\nonslaught. Limited are our warlike resources, but we will continue this\nunjust, bloody, and unequal struggle, not for the love of war–which\nwe abhor–but to defend our incontrovertible rights of Liberty and\nIndependence (so dearly won in war with Spain) and our territory\nwhich is threatened by the ambitions of a party that is trying to\nsubjugate us.",
        "Distressing, indeed, is war! Its ravages cause us horror. Luckless\nFilipinos succumb in the confusion of combat, leaving behind them\nmothers, widows and children. America could put up with all the\nmisfortunes she brings on us without discomfort; but what the North\nAmerican people are not agreeable to is that she should continue\nsacrificing her sons, causing distress and anguish to mothers,\nwidows and daughters to satisfy the whim of maintaining a war\nin contravention of their honourable traditions as enunciated by\nWashington and Jefferson.",
        "Go back, therefore, North American people, to your old-time\nliberty. Put your hand on your heart and tell me: Would it be pleasant\nfor you if, in the course of time, North America should find herself in\nthe pitiful plight, of a weak and oppressed people and the Philippines,\na free and powerful nation, then at war with your oppressors, asked\nfor your aid promising to deliver you from such a weighty yoke, and\nafter defeating her enemy with your aid she set about subjugating you,\nrefusing the promised liberation?",
        "Civilized nations! Honourable inhabitants of the United States, to\nwhose high and estimable consideration I submit this unpretentious\nwork, herein you have the providential facts which led to the unjust\nattack upon the existence of the Philippine Republic and the existence\nof those for whom, though unworthy, God made me the principal guardian.",
        "The veracity of these facts rests upon my word as President of this\nRepublic and on the honour of the whole population of eight million\nsouls, who, for more than three hundred years have been sacrificing\nthe lives and wealth of their brave sons to obtain due recognition\nof the natural rights of mankind–liberty and independence.",
        "If you will do me the honour to receive and read this work and then\npass judgment impartially solemnly declaring on which side right and\njustice rests, your respectful servant will be eternally grateful.",
        "(Signed) Emilio Aguinaldo.",
