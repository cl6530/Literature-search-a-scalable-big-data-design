        "Lanercost Priory is situated in a singularly beautiful sylvan valley\nwatered by the river Irthing. Only the shell of the chancel remains, but\nthe nave has been restored, and is now used as the church of the parish.\nThe walls of the roofless transepts as well as the central tower are\nstill standing. The pillars on the south side support a much decayed\nclerestory, but on the opposite side both the triforium and clerestory\nare in a fairly good state of preservation.",
        "A side chapel in the choir contains some very finely carved but battered\naltar-tombs belonging to the Dacre family–one of them is believed to be\nthat of Lord William Howard. Under what was the refectory of the\nconventual buildings, one may find the crypt in a very good state of\npreservation. In it are preserved some Roman altars and carvings\ndiscovered at various times in the locality. A number of Roman\ninscriptions having been discovered on the walls of the Priory Church;\nit is generally supposed that much of the building material was obtained\nfrom the Roman wall. The Rev. J. Maughan has argued for the existence of\na Roman station at this point, and its name is believed to have been\nPetriana.",
        "The monastery adjoining the Priory Church belonged to the order of St.\nAugustine, and its endowments consisted of all the land lying between\nthe Picts’ wall and the river Irthing, upon which the buildings stood,\nand between Burgh and Poltross.",
        "After the dissolution the monastic buildings were put into a proper\nstate of repair, and were converted into a private residence by Lord\nThomas Dacre, who built the castellated portion towards the south, which\nof course did not belong to the original structure. Half a mile distant\nfrom the priory is Naworth Castle, the historic seat of the Earl of\nCarlisle, and Brampton is famous for its mote, which was possibly a\nDanish fort.",
