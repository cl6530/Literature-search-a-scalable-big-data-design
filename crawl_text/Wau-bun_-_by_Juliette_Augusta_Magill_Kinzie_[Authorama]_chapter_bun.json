        "Every work partaking of the nature of an autobiography is supposed to\ndemand an apology to the public. To refuse such a tribute, would be to\nrecognize the justice of the charge, so often brought against our\ncountrymen–of a too great willingness to be made acquainted with the\ndomestic history and private affairs of their neighbors.",
        "It is, doubtless, to refute this calumny that we find travellers, for\nthe most part, modestly offering some such form of explanation as this,\nto the reader: “That the matter laid before him was, in the first place,\nsimply letters to friends, never designed to be submitted to other eyes,\nand only brought forward now at the solicitation of wiser judges than\nthe author himself.”",
        "No such plea can, in the present instance, be offered. The record of\nevents in which the writer had herself no share, was preserved in\ncompliance with the suggestion of a revered relative, whose name often\nappears in the following pages. “My child,” she would say, “write these\nthings down, as I tell them to you. Hereafter our children, and even\nstrangers, will feel interested in hearing the story of our early lives\nand sufferings.” And it is a matter of no small regret and\nself-reproach, that much, very much, thus narrated was, through\nnegligence, or a spirit of procrastination, suffered to pass unrecorded.",
        "With regard to the pictures of domestic life and experience (preserved,\nas will be seen, in journals, letters, and otherwise), it is true their\npublication might have been deferred until the writer had passed away\nfrom the scene of action; and such, it was supposed, would have been\ntheir lot–that they would only have been dragged forth hereafter, to\nshow to a succeeding generation what “The Early Day” of our Western\nhomes had been. It never entered the anticipations of the most sanguine\nthat the march of improvement and prosperity would, in less than a\nquarter of a century, have so obliterated the traces of “the first\nbeginning,” that a vast and intelligent multitude would be crying out\nfor information in regard to the early settlement of this portion of our\ncountry, which so few are left to furnish.",
        "An opinion has been expressed, that a comparison of the present times\nwith those that are past, would enable our young people, emigrating from\ntheir luxurious homes at “the East,” to bear, in a spirit of patience\nand contentment, the slight privations and hardships they are at this\nday called to meet with. If, in one instance, this should be the case,\nthe writer may well feel happy to have incurred even the charge of\negotism, in giving thus much of her own history.",
        "It may be objected that all that is strictly personal, might have been\nmore modestly put forth under the name of a third person; or that the\nevents themselves and the scenes might have been described, while those\nparticipating in them might have been kept more in the background. In\nthe first case, the narrative would have lost its air of truth and\nreality–in the second, the experiment would merely have been tried of\ndressing up a theatre for representation, and omitting the actors.",
        "Some who read the following sketches may be inclined to believe that a\nresidence among our native brethren and an attachment growing out of our\npeculiar relation to them, have exaggerated our sympathies, and our\nsense of the wrongs they have received at the hands of the whites. This\nis not the place to discuss that point. There is a tribunal at which man\nshall be judged for that which he has meted out to his fellow-man.",
        "May our countrymen take heed that their legislation shall never unfit\nthem to appear “with joy, and not with grief,” before that tribunal!",
        "Chicago, July, 1855.",
        "It was on a dark, rainy evening in the month of September, 1830, that we\nwent on board the steamer “Henry Clay,” to take passage for Green Bay.\nAll our friends in Detroit had congratulated us upon our good fortune in\nbeing spared the voyage in one of the little schooners which at this\ntime afforded the ordinary means of communication with the few and\ndistant settlements on Lakes Huron and Michigan.",
        "Each one had some experience to relate of his own or Of his friends’\nmischances in these precarious journeys–long detentions on the St.\nClair flats–furious head-winds off Thunder Bay, or interminable Calms\nat Mackinac or the Manitous. That which most enhanced our sense of\npeculiar good luck, was the true story of one of our relatives having\nleft Detroit in the month of June and reached Chicago in the September\nfollowing, having been actually three months in performing what is\nsometimes accomplished by even a sail-vessel in four days.",
        "But the certainty of encountering similar misadventures would have\nweighed little with me. I was now to visit, nay, more, to become a\nresident of that land which had, for long years, been to me a region of\nromance. Since the time when, as a child, my highest delight had been in\nthe letters of a dear relative, describing to me his home and mode of\nlife in the “Indian country,” and still later, in his felicitous\nnarration of a tour with General Cass, in 1820, to the sources of the\nMississippi–nay, even earlier, in the days when I stood at my teacher’s\nknee, and spelled out the long word Mich-i-li-mack-i-nac, that distant\nland, with its vast lakes, its boundless prairies, and its mighty\nforests, had possessed a wonderful charm for my imagination. Now I was\nto see it!–it was to be my home!",
        "Our ride to the quay, through the dark by-ways, in a cart, the only\nvehicle which at that day could navigate the muddy, unpaved streets of\nDetroit, was a theme for much merriment, and not less so, our descent of\nthe narrow, perpendicular stair-way by which we reached the little\napartment called the Ladies’ Cabin. We were highly delighted with the\naccommodations, which, by comparison, seemed the very climax of comfort\nand convenience; more especially as the occupants of the cabin\nconsisted, beside myself, of but a lady and two little girls.",
        "Nothing could exceed the pleasantness of our trip for the first\ntwenty-four hours. There were some officers, old friends, among the\npassengers. We had plenty of books. The gentlemen read aloud\noccasionally, admired the solitary magnificence of the scenery around\nus, the primeval woods, or the vast expanse of water unenlivened by a\nsingle sail, and then betook themselves to their cigar, or their game of\neuchre, to while away the hours.",
        "For a time the passage over Thunder Bay was delightful, but, alas! it\nwas not destined, in our favor, to belie its name. A storm came on, fast\nand furious–what was worse, it was of long duration. The pitching and\nrolling of the little boat, the closeness, and even the sea-sickness, we\nbore as became us. They were what we had expected, and were prepared\nfor. But a new feature of discomfort appeared, which almost upset our\nphilosophy.",
        "The rain, which fell in torrents, soon made its way through every seam\nand pore of deck or moulding. Down the stair-way, through the joints and\ncrevices, it came, saturating first the carpet, then the bedding, until,\nfinally, we were completely driven, “by stress of weather,” into the\nGentlemen’s Cabin. Way was made for us very gallantly, and every\nprovision resorted to for our comfort, and we were congratulating\nourselves on having found a haven in our distress, when, lo! the seams\nabove opened, and down upon our devoted heads poured such a flood, that\neven umbrellas were an insufficient protection. There was nothing left\nfor the ladies and children but to betake ourselves to the berths,\nwhich, in this apartment, fortunately remained dry; and here we\ncontinued ensconced the livelong day. Our dinner was served up to us on\nour pillows. The gentlemen chose the dryest spots, raised their\numbrellas, and sat under them, telling amusing anecdotes, and saying\nfunny things to cheer us, until the rain ceased, and at nine o’clock in\nthe evening we were gladdened by the intelligence that we had reached\nthe pier at Mackinac.",
        "We were received with the most affectionate cordiality by Mr. and Mrs.\nRobert Stuart, at whose hospitable mansion we had been for some days\nexpected.",
        "The repose and comfort of an asylum like this, can be best appreciated\nby those who have reached it after a tossing and drenching such as ours\nhad been. A bright, warm fire, and countenances beaming with kindest\ninterest, dispelled all sensations of fatigue or annoyance.",
        "After a season of pleasant conversation, the servants were assembled,\nthe chapter of God’s word was solemnly read, the hymn chanted, the\nprayer of praise and thanksgiving offered, and we were conducted to our\nplace of repose.",
        "It is not my purpose here to attempt a portrait of those noble friends\nwhom I thus met for the first time. To an abler pen than mine should be\nassigned the honor of writing the biography of Robert Stuart. All who\nhave enjoyed the happiness of his acquaintance, or, still more, a\nsojourn under his hospitable roof, will carry with them to their latest\nhour the impression of his noble bearing, his genial humor, his untiring\nbenevolence, his upright, uncompromising adherence to principle, his\nardent philanthropy, his noble disinterestedness. Irving in his\n\"Astoria,” and Franchere in his “Narrative,” give many striking traits\nof his early character, together with events of his history of a\nthrilling and romantic interest, but both have left the most valuable\nportion unsaid, his after-life, namely, as a Christian gentleman.",
        "Of his beloved partner, who still survives him, mourning on her bereaved\nand solitary pilgrimage, yet cheered by the recollection of her long and\nuseful course as a “Mother in Israel,” we will say no more than to offer\nthe incense of loving hearts, and prayers for the best blessings from\nher Father in heaven.",
        "Michilimackinac! that gem of the Lakes! How bright and beautiful it\nlooked as we walked abroad on the following morning! The rain had passed\naway, but had left all things glittering in the light of the sun as it\nrose up over the waters of Lake Huron, far away to the east. Before us\nwas the lovely bay, scarcely yet tranquil after the storm, but dotted\nwith canoes and the boats of the fishermen already getting out their\nnets for the trout and whitefish, those treasures of the deep. Along the\nbeach were scattered the wigwams or lodges of the Ottawas who had come\nto the island to trade. The inmates came forth to gaze upon us. A shout\nof welcome was sent forth, as they recognized Shaw-nee-aw-kee, who,\nfrom a seven years’ residence among them, was well known to each\nindividual.",
        "A shake of the hand, and an emphatic ’Bon-jour–bon-jour,” is the\ncustomary salutation between the Indian and the white man.",
        "“Do the Indians speak French?” I inquired of my husband.",
        "“No; this is a fashion they have learned of the French traders during\nmany years of intercourse.”",
        "Not less hearty was the greeting of each Canadian engagé, as he\ntrotted forward to pay his respects to “Monsieur John,” and to utter a\nlong string of felicitations, in a most incomprehensible patois. I was\nforced to take for granted all the good wishes showered upon “Madame\nJohn,” of which I could comprehend nothing but the hope that I should\nbe happy and contented in my ’vie sauvage.”",
        "The object of our early walk was to visit the Mission-house and school\nwhich had been some few years previously established at this place by\nthe Presbyterian Board of Missions. It was an object of especial\ninterest to Mr. and Mrs. Stuart, and its flourishing condition at this\nperiod, and the prospects of extensive future usefulness it held out,\nmight well gladden their philanthropic hearts. They had lived many years\non the island, and had witnessed its transformation, through God’s\nblessing on Christian efforts, from a worldly, dissipated community to\none of which it might almost be said, “Religion was every man’s\nbusiness.” This mission establishment was the beloved child and the\ncommon centre of interest of the few Protestant families clustered\naround it. Through the zeal and good management of Mr. and Mrs. Ferry,\nand the fostering encouragement of the congregation, the school was in\ngreat repute, and it was pleasant to observe the effect of mental and\nreligious culture in subduing the mischievous, tricky propensities of\nthe half-breed, and rousing the stolid apathy of the genuine Indian.",
        "These were the palmy days of Mackinac. As the head-quarters of the\nAmerican Fur Company, and the entrepôt of the whole Northwest, all the\ntrade in supplies and goods on the one hand, and in furs and products of\nthe Indian country on the other, was in the hands of the parent\nestablishment or its numerous outposts scattered along Lakes Superior\nand Michigan, the Mississippi, or through still more distant regions.",
        "Probably few are ignorant of the fact, that all the Indian tribes, with\nthe exception of the Miamis and the Wyandots, had, since the transfer of\nthe old French possessions to the British Crown, maintained a firm\nalliance with the latter. The independence achieved by the United\nStates did not alter the policy of the natives, nor did our Government\nsucceed in winning or purchasing their friendship. Great Britain, it is\ntrue, bid high to retain them. Every year the leading men of the\nChippewas, Ottawas, Pottowattamies, Menomonees, Winnebagoes, Sauks, and\nFoxes, and even still more remote tribes, journeyed from their distant\nhomes to Fort Malden in Upper Canada, to receive their annual amount of\npresents from their Great Father across the water. It was a\nmaster-policy thus to keep them in pay, and had enabled those who\npractised it to do fearful execution through the aid of such allies in\nthe last war between the two countries.",
        "The presents they thus received were of considerable value, consisting\nof blankets, broadcloths or strouding, calicoes, guns, kettles, traps,\nsilver-works (comprising arm-bands, bracelets, brooches; and ear-bobs),\nlooking-glasses, combs, and various other trinkets distributed with no\nniggardly hand.",
        "The magazines and store-houses of the Fur Company at Mackinac were the\nresort of all the upper tribes for the sale of their commodities, and\nthe purchase of all such articles as they had need of, including those\nabove enumerated, and also ammunition, which, as well as money and\nliquor, their British friends very commendably omitted to furnish them.",
        "Besides their furs, various in kind and often of great value–beaver,\notter, marten, mink, silver-gray and red fox, wolf, bear, and wild-cat,\nmusk-rat, and smoked deer-skins–the Indians brought for trade\nmaple-sugar in abundance, considerable quantities of both Indian corn\nand petit-blé,[1] beans and the folles avoines,[2] or wild rice;\nwhile the squaws added to their quota of merchandise a contribution in\nthe form of moccasins, hunting-pouches, mococks, or little boxes of\nbirch-bark embroidered with porcupine-quills and filled with\nmaple-sugar, mats of a neat and durable fabric, and toy-models of Indian\ncradles, snow-shoes, canoes, etc., etc.",
        "It was no unusual thing, at this period, to see a hundred or more canoes\nof Indians at once approaching the island, laden with their articles of\ntraffic; and if to these we add the squadrons of large Mackinac boats\nconstantly arriving from the outposts, with the furs, peltries, and\nbuffalo-robes collected by the distant traders, some idea may be formed\nof the extensive operations and important position of the American Fur\nCompany, as well as of the vast circle of human beings either\nimmediately or remotely connected with it.",
        "It is no wonder that the philanthropic mind, surveying these, races of\nuncultivated heathen, should stretch forward to the time when, through\nan unwearied devotion of the white man’s energies, and an untiring\nsacrifice of self and fortune, his red brethren might rise in the scale\nof social civilization–when Education and Christianity should go hand\nin hand, to make “the wilderness blossom as the rose.”",
        "Little did the noble souls at that day rejoicing in the success of their\nlabors at Mackinac, anticipate that in less than a quarter of a century\nthere would remain of all these numerous tribes but a few scattered\nbands, squalid, degraded, with scarce a vestige remaining of their\nformer lofty character–their lands cajoled or wrested from them, the\ngraves of their fathers turned up by the ploughshare–themselves chased\nfarther and farther towards the setting sun, until they were literally\ngrudged a resting-place on the face of the earth!",
        "Our visit to the Mission-school was of short duration, for the Henry\nClay was to leave at two o’clock, and in the mean time we were to see\nwhat we could of the village and its environs, and after that dine with\nMr. Mitchell, an old friend of my husband. As we walked leisurely along\nover the white, gravelly road, many of the residences of the old\ninhabitants were pointed out to me. There was the dwelling of Madame\nLaframboise, an Ottawa woman, whose husband had taught her to read and\nwrite, and who had ever after continued to use the knowledge she had\nacquired for the instruction and improvement of the youth among her own\npeople. It was her custom to receive a class of young pupils daily at\nher house, that she might give them lessons in the branches mentioned,\nand also in the principles of the Roman Catholic religion, to which she\nwas deeply devoted. She was a woman of a vast deal of energy and\nenterprise–of a tall and commanding figure, and most dignified\ndeportment. After the death of her husband, who was killed while away at\nhis trading-post by a Winnebago named White Ox, she was accustomed to\nvisit herself the trading-posts, superintend the clerks and engagés, and\nsatisfy herself that the business was carried on in a regular and\nprofitable manner.",
        "The Agency-house, with its unusual luxuries of piazza and gardens, was\nsituated at the foot of the hill on which the fort was built. It was a\nlovely spot, notwithstanding the stunted and dwarfish appearance of all\ncultivated vegetation in this cold northern latitude.",
        "The collection of rickety, primitive-looking buildings, occupied by the\nofficials of the Fur Company, reflected no great credit on the\narchitectural skill of my husband, who had superintended their\nconstruction, he told me, when little more than a boy.",
        "There were, besides these, the residences of the Dousmans, the Abbotts,\nthe Biddles, the Drews, and the Lashleys, stretching away along the\nbase of the beautiful hill, crowned with the white walls and buildings\nof the fort, the ascent to which was so steep that on the precipitous\nface nearest the beach staircases were built by which to mount from\nbelow.",
        "My head ached intensely, the effect of the motion of the boat on the\nprevious day, but I did not like to give up to it; so, after I had been\nshown all that could be seen of the little settlement in the short time\nallowed us, we repaired to Mr. Mitchell’s.",
        "We were received by Mrs. M., an extremely pretty, delicate woman, part\nFrench and part Sioux, whose early life had been passed at Prairie du\nChien, on the Mississippi. She had been a great belle among the young\nofficers at Fort Crawford; so much so, indeed, that the suicide of the\npost-surgeon was attributed to an unsuccessful attachment he had\nconceived for her. I was greatly struck with her soft and gentle\nmanners, and the musical intonation of her voice, which I soon learned\nwas a distinguishing peculiarity of those women in whom are united the\nFrench and native blood.",
        "A lady, then upon a visit to the Mission, was of the company. She\ninsisted on my lying down upon the sofa, and ministered most kindly to\nmy suffering head. As she sat by my side, and expatiated upon the new\nsphere opening before me, she inquired:",
        "“Do you not realize very strongly the entire deprivation of religious\nprivileges you will be obliged to suffer in your distant home?”",
        "“The deprivation,” said I, “will doubtless be great, but not entire;\nfor I shall have my Prayer-Book, and, though destitute of a church, we\nneed not be without a mode of worship.”",
        "How often afterwards, when cheered by the consolations of that precious\nbook in the midst of the lonely wilderness, did I remember this\nconversation, and bless God that I could never, while retaining it, be\nwithout “religious privileges.”",
        "We had not yet left the dinner-table, when the bell of the little\nsteamer sounded to summon us on board, and we bade a hurried farewell to\nall our kind friends, bearing with us their hearty wishes for a safe and\nprosperous voyage.",
        "A finer sight can scarcely be imagined than Mackinac, from the water. As\nwe steamed away from the shore, the view came full upon us–the sloping\nbeach with the scattered wigwams, and canoes drawn up here and\nthere–the irregular, quaint-looking houses–the white walls of the\nfort, and, beyond, one eminence still more lofty crowned with the\nremains of old Fort Holmes. The whole picture completed, showed the\nperfect outline that had given the island its original Indian name,\nMich-i-li-mack-i-nac, the Big Turtle.",
        "Then those pure, living waters, in whose depths the fish might be seen\ngliding and darting to and fro; whose clearness is such that an object\ndropped to the bottom may be discerned at the depth of fifty or sixty\nfeet, a dollar lying far down on its green bed, looking no larger than a\nhalf dime! I could hardly wonder at the enthusiastic lady who exclaimed:\n\"Oh! I could wish to be drowned in these pure, beautiful waters!”",
        "As we passed the extreme western point of the island, my husband pointed\nout to me, far away to the northwest, a promontory which he told me was\nPoint St. Ignace. It possessed great historic interest, as one of the\nearliest white settlements on this continent. The Jesuit missionaries\nhad established here a church and school as early as 1607, the same year\nin which a white settlement was made at St. Augustine, in Florida, and\none year before the founding of Jamestown, Virginia.",
        "All that remains of the enterprises of these devoted men, is the\nremembrance of their labors, perpetuated, in most instances, only by the\nnames of the spots which witnessed their efforts of love in behalf of\ntheir savage brethren. The little French church at Sandwich, opposite\nDetroit, alone is left, a witness of the zeal and self-sacrifice of\nthese pioneers of Christianity.",
        "Passing “Old Mackinac,” on the main land, which forms the southern\nborder of the straits, we soon came out into the broad waters of Lake\nMichigan. Every traveller, and every reader of our history, is familiar\nwith the incidents connected with the taking of the old fort by the\nIndians, in the days of Pontiac. How, by means of a game of ball, played\nin an apparently friendly spirit outside the walls, and of which the\nofficers and soldiers had come forth to be spectators, the ball was\ndexterously tossed over the wall, and the savages rushing in, under\npretext of finding it, soon got possession and massacred the garrison.",
        "The little Indian village of L’Arbre Croche gleamed far away south, in\nthe light of the setting sun. With that exception, there was no sign of\nliving habitation along that vast and wooded shore. The gigantic\nforest-trees, and here and there the little glades of prairie opening to\nthe water, showed a landscape that would have gladdened the eye of the\nagriculturist, with its promise of fertility; but it was evidently\nuntrodden by the foot of man, and we left it, in its solitude, as we\ntook our course westward across the waters.",
        "The rainy and gusty weather, so incident to the equinoctial season,\novertook us again before we reached the mouth of Green Bay, and kept us\ncompany until the night of our arrival upon the flats, about three miles\nbelow the settlement. Here the little steamer grounded “fast and hard.\"\nAs almost every one preferred braving the elements to remaining cooped\nup in the quarters we had occupied for the past week, we decided to\ntrust ourselves to the little boat, spite of wind, and rain, and\ndarkness, and in due time we reached the shore.",
        "Our arrival at Green Bay was at an unfortunate moment. It was the time\nof a treaty between the United States Government and the Menomonees and\nWaubanakees. Consequently, not only the commissioners of the treaty,\nwith their clerks and officials, but traders, claimants, travellers, and\nidlers innumerable were upon the ground. Most of these were congregated\nin the only hotel the place afforded. This was a tolerably-sized house\nnear the river-side, and as we entered the long dining-room, cold and\ndripping from the open boat, we were infinitely amused at the motley\nassemblage it contained. Various groups were seated around. New comers,\nlike ourselves, stood here and there, for there were not seats enough to\naccommodate all who sought entertainment. The landlord sat calm and\nindifferent, his hands in his pockets, exhibiting all the phlegm of a\nPennsylvania Dutchman.",
        "His fat, notable spouse was trotting round, now stopping to scold about\nsome one who, “burn his skin!” had fallen short in his duty; now\nlaughing good-humoredly until her sides shook, at some witticism\naddressed to her.",
        "She welcomed us very cordially, but to our inquiry, “Can you\naccommodate us?” her reply was, “Not I. I have got twice as many people\nnow as I know what to do with. I have had to turn my own family out of\ntheir quarters, what with the commissioners and the lot of folks that\nhas come in upon us.”",
        "“What are we to do, then? It is too late and stormy to go up to\nShanty-town to seek for lodgings.”",
        "“Well, sit you down and take your supper, and we will see what we can\ndo.”",
        "And she actually did contrive to find a little nook, in which we were\nglad to take refuge from the multitudes around us.",
        "A slight board partition separated us from the apartment occupied by\nGeneral Root, of New York, one of the commissioners of the treaty. The\nsteamer in which we came had brought the mail, at that day a rare\nblessing to the distant settlements. The opening and reading of all the\ndispatches, which the General received about bed-time, had, of course,\nto be gone through with, before he could retire to rest. His eyes being\nweak, his secretaries were employed to read the communications. He was a\nlittle deaf withal, and through the slight division between the two\napartments the contents of the letters, and his comments upon them, were\nunpleasantly audible, as he continually admonished his secretary to\nraise his voice.",
        "“What is that, Walter? Read that over again.”",
        "In vain we coughed and hemmed, and knocked over sundry pieces of\nfurniture. They were too deeply interested to hear aught that passed\naround them, and if we had been politicians we should have had all the\nsecrets of the working-men’s party at our disposal, out of which to\nhave made capital.",
        "The next morning it was still rain! rain! nothing but rain! In spite of\nit, however, the gentlemen would take a small boat to row to the\nsteamer, to bring up the luggage, not the least important part of that\nwhich appertained to us being sundry boxes of silver for paying the\nannuities to the Winnebagoes at the Portage.",
        "I went out with some others of the company upon the piazza, to witness\ntheir departure. A gentleman pointed out to me Fort Howard, on a\nprojecting point of the opposite shore, about three-quarters of a mile\ndistant–the old barracks, the picketed inclosure, the walls, all\nlooking quaint, and, considering their modern erection, really ancient\nand venerable. Presently we turned our attention to the boat, which had\nby this time gained the middle of the river. One of the passengers was\nstanding up in the stern, apparently giving some directions.",
        "“That is rather a venturesome fellow,” remarked one; “if he is not\ncareful he will lose his balance.” And at this moment we saw him\nactually perform a summerset backward, and disappear in the water.",
        "“Oh!” cried I, “he will be drowned!”",
        "The gentlemen laughed. “No, there he is; they are helping him in again.”",
        "The course of the boat was immediately changed, and the party returned\nto the shore. It was not until one disembarked and came dripping and\nlaughing towards me, that I recognized him as my own peculiar property.\nHe was pleased to treat the matter as a joke, but I thought it rather a\nsad beginning of Western experience.",
        "He suffered himself to be persuaded to intrust the care of his effects\nto his friends, and having changed his dress, prepared to remain quietly\nwith me, when just at this moment a vehicle drove up to the door, and we\nrecognized the pleasant, familiar face of our old friend, Judge Doty.",
        "He had received the news of our arrival, and had come to take us at\nonce to his hospitable mansion. We were only too happy to gather\ntogether our bags and travelling-baskets and accompany him without\nfarther ceremony.",
        "Our drive took us first along the edge of Navarino, next through\nShanty-town (the latter a far more appropriate name than the former),\namid mud and mire, over bad roads, and up and down hilly, break-neck\nplaces, until we reached the little brick dwelling of our friends. Mrs.\nDoty received us with such true, sisterly kindness, and everything\nseemed so full of welcome, that we soon felt ourselves at home.",
        "We found that, expecting our arrival, invitations had already been\nprepared to assemble the whole circle of Green Bay society to meet us at\nan evening party–this, in a new country, being the established mode of\ndoing honor to guests or strangers.",
        "We learned, upon inquiry, that Captain Harney, who had kindly offered to\ncome with a boat and crew of soldiers from Fort Winnebago, to convey us\nto that place, our destined home, had not yet arrived; we therefore felt\nat liberty to make arrangements for a few days of social enjoyment at\n\"the Bay.”",
        "It was pleasant to people, secluded in such a degree from the world at\nlarge, to bear all the news we had brought–all the particulars of life\nand manners–the thousand little items that the newspapers of that day\ndid not dream of furnishing–the fashions, and that general gossip, in\nshort, which a lady is erroneously supposed more au fait of, than a\ngentleman.",
        "I well remember that, in giving and receiving information, the day\npassed in a pretty uninterrupted stream of communication. All the party\nexcept myself had made the journey, or rather voyage, up the Fox River\nand down the Wisconsin to the Mississippi.",
        "There were plenty of anecdotes of a certain trip performed by the\nthree, in company with a French trader and his two sisters, then making\ntheir debut as Western travellers. The manner in which Mademoiselle\nJulie would borrow, without leave, a fine damask napkin or two, to wipe\nout the ducks in preparation for cooking–the difficulty of persuading\neither of the sisters of the propriety of washing and rinsing their\ntable apparatus nicely before packing it away in the mess-basket, the\nconsequence of which was, that another nice napkin must be stealthily\nwhisked out, to wipe the dishes when the hour for meals arrived–the fun\nof the young gentleman in hunting up his stray articles, thus\nmisappropriated, from the nooks and corners of the boat, tying them with\na cord, and hanging them over the stern, to make their way down the\nWisconsin to Prairie du Chien.",
        "Then there was a capital story of M. Rolette himself. At one point on\nthe route (I think in crossing Winnebago Lake) the travellers met one of\nthe Company’s boats on its way to Green Bay for supplies. M. Rolette was\none of the agents of the Company, and the people in the boat were his\nemployés. Of course after an absence of some weeks from home, the\nmeeting on these lonely waters and the exchanging of news was an\noccasion of great excitement.",
        "The boats were stopped–earnest greetings interchanged–question\nfollowed question.",
        "“Eh bien–have they finished the new house?”",
        "“Oui, Monsieur.”",
        "“Et la cheminée, fume-t-elle?” (Does the chimney smoke?)",
        "“Non, Monsieur.”",
        "“And the harvest–how is that?”",
        "“Very fine, indeed.”",
        "“Is the mill at work?”",
        "“Yes, plenty of water.”",
        "“How is Whip?” (his favorite horse.)",
        "“Oh! Whip is first-rate.”",
        "Everything, in short, about the store, the farm, the business of various\ndescriptions being satisfactorily gone over, there was no occasion for\nfarther delay. It was time to proceed.",
        "“Eh bien–adieu! bon voyage!“",
        "“Arrachez, mes gens!” (Go ahead, men!)",
        "Then suddenly–”Arrêtez! arrêtez!” (Stop, stop!)",
        "“Comment se portent Madame Rolette et les enfans?” (How are Mrs.\nRolette and the children?)",
        "This day, with its excitement, was at length over, and we retired to our\nrest, thankful that we had not General Root and his secretary close to\nour bed’s head, with their budget of political news.",
        "My slumbers were not destined, however, to be quite undisturbed. I was\nawakened, at the first slight peep of dawn, by a sound from an apartment\nbeneath our own–a plaintive, monotonous chant, rising and then falling\nin a sort of mournful cadence. It seemed to me a wail of something\nunearthly–so wild–so strange–so unaccountable. In terror I awoke my\nhusband, who reassured me by telling me it was the morning salutation of\nthe Indians to the opening day.",
        "Some Menomonees had been kindly given shelter for the night in the\nkitchen below, and, having fulfilled their unvarying custom of chanting\ntheir morning hymn, they now ceased, and again composed themselves to\nsleep. But not so their auditor. There was to me something inexpressibly\nbeautiful in this morning song of praise from the untaught sons of the\nforest. What a lesson did it preach to the civilized, Christianized\nworld, too many of whom lie down and rise up without an aspiration of\nthanksgiving to their Almighty Preserver–without even a remembrance of\nHis care, who gives His angels charge concerning them! Never has the\nimpression of that simple act of worship faded from my mind. I have\nloved to think that, with some, these strains might be the outpouring of\na devotion as pure as that of the Christian when he utters the inspiring\nwords of the sainted Ken–",
        "“Awake, my soul! and with the sun,” etc.",
        "Among the visitors who called to offer me a welcome to the West, were\nMr. and Miss Cadle, who were earnestly engaged in the first steps of\ntheir afterwards flourishing enterprise for the education of Indian and\nhalf-breed children. The school-houses and chapel were not yet erected,\nbut we visited their proposed site, and listened with great interest to\nbright anticipations of the future good that was to be accomplished–the\nsuccess that was to crown their efforts for taming the heathen and\nteaching them the knowledge of their Saviour and the blessings of\ncivilized life. The sequel has shown how little the zeal of the few can\naccomplish, when opposed to the cupidity of the many.",
        "Our evening party went off as parties do elsewhere. The most interesting\nfeature to me, because the most novel, was the conversation of some\nyoung ladies to whom I was introduced, natives of Green Bay or its\nvicinity. Their mother was a Menomonee, but their father was a\nFrenchman, a descendant of a settler some generations back, and who,\nthere is reason to believe, was a branch of the same family of Grignon\nto which the daughter of Madame de Sévigné belonged. At least, it is\nsaid there are in the possession of the family many old papers and\nrecords which would give that impression, although the orthography of\nthe name has become slightly changed. Be that as it may, the Miss\nGrignons were strikingly dignified, well-bred young ladies, and there\nwas a charm about their soft voices, and original, unsophisticated\nremarks, very attractive to a stranger.",
        "They opened to me, however, a new field of apprehension; for, on my\nexpressing my great impatience to see my new home, they exclaimed, with\na look of wonder,–",
        "“Vous n’avez donc pas peur des serpens?”",
        "“Snakes! was it possible there were snakes at Fort Winnebago?”",
        "“At the Portage! oh! yes–one can never walk out for\nthem–rattle-snakes–copper-heads–all sorts!”",
        "I am not naturally timid, but I must confess that the idea of the\nserpens sonnettes and the siffleurs was not quite a subject of\nindifference.",
        "There was one among these young ladies whose tall, graceful figure,\nrich, blooming complexion, and dark, glancing eye, would have\ndistinguished her in any drawing-room–and another, whose gentle\nsweetness and cultivated taste made it a matter of universal regret that\nshe was afterwards led to adopt the seclusion of a convent.",
        "Captain Harney and his boat arrived in due time, and active preparations\nfar the comfort of our journey commenced under the kind supervision of\nMrs. Doty. The mess-basket was stowed with good things of every\ndescription–ham and tongue–biscuit and plum-cake–not to mention the\nsubstantiate of crackers, bread, and boiled pork, the latter of which,\nhowever, a lady was supposed to be too fastidious to think of touching,\neven if starving in the woods.",
        "We had engaged three Canadian voyageurs to take charge of our tent,\nmess-basket, and matters and things in general. Their business it was to\nbe to cut the wood for our fires, prepare our meals, and give a helping\nhand to whatever was going forward. A messenger had also been sent to\nthe Kakalin, or rapids, twenty-one miles above, to notify\nWish-tay-yun,[3] the most accomplished guide through the difficult\npasses of the river, to be in readiness for our service on a specified\nday.",
        "In the mean time, we had leisure for one more party, and it was to be a\n\"real Western hop.” Everybody will remember that dance at Mrs. Baird’s.\nAll the people, young and old, that would be gathered throughout, or, as\nit was the fashion to express it, on Green Bay, were assembled. The\nyoung officers were up from Fort Howard, looking so smart in their\nuniforms–treasures of finery, long uncalled forth, were now brought to\nlight–everybody was bound to do honor to the strangers by appearing in\ntheir very best. It was to be an entertainment unequalled by any given\nbefore. All the house was put in requisition for the occasion. Desks and\nseats were unceremoniously dismissed from Mr. B.’s office, which formed\none wing, to afford more space for the dancers. Not only the front\nportion of the dwelling, but even the kitchen was made fit for the\nreception of company, in case any primitive visitor, as was sometimes\nthe case, should prefer sitting down quietly there and smoking his\ncigar. This was an emergency that, in those days, had always to be\nprovided for.",
        "Nothing could exceed the mirth and hilarity of the company. No\nrestraint, but of good manners–no excess of conventionalities–genuine,\nhearty good-humor and enjoyment, such as pleasant, hospitable people,\nwith just enough of the French element to add zest to anything like\namusement, could furnish, to make the entertainment agreeable. In a\ncountry so new, and where, in a social gathering, the number of the\ncompany was more important than the quality, the circle was not always,\nstrictly speaking, select.",
        "I was aware of this, and was therefore more amused than surprised when a\nclumsy little man, with a broad, red, laughing face, waddled across the\nroom to where I had taken my seat after a dance, and thus addressed me:",
        "“Miss K––, nobody hain’t never introduced you to me, but I’ve seen\nyou a good many times, and I know your husband very well, so I thought I\nmight just as well come and speak to you–my name is A––.”",
        "“Ah! Mr. A––, good-evening. I hope you are enjoying yourself. How is\nyour sister?”",
        "“Oh! she is a great deal worse–her cold has got into her eye, and it is\nall shot up.”",
        "Then turning full upon a lady[4] who sat near, radiant with youth and\nbeauty, sparkling with wit and genuine humor:",
        "“Oh! Mrs. Beall,” he began, “what a beautiful gown you have got on, and\nhow handsome you do look! I declare you’re the prettiest woman in the\nroom, and dance the handsomest.”",
        "“Indeed, Mr. A––,” replied she, suppressing her love of fun and\nassuming a demure look, “I am afraid you flatter me.”",
        "“No, I don’t–I’m in earnest. I’ve just come to ask you to dance.”",
        "Such was the penalty of being too charming.",
        "It had been arranged that Judge Doty should accompany us in our boat as\nfar as the Butte des Morts, at which place his attendant would be\nwaiting with horses to convey him to Mineral Point, where he was to hold\ncourt.",
        "It was a bright and beautiful morning when we left his pleasant home, to\ncommence our passage up the Fox River Captain Harney was proposing to\nremain a few days longer at “the Bay,” but he called to escort us to the\nboat and instal us in all its comforts.",
        "As he helped me along over the ploughed ground and other inequalities in\nour way to the river-bank, where the boat lay, he told me how\nimpatiently Mrs. Twiggs, the wife of the commanding officer, who since\nthe past spring had been the only white lady at Fort Winnebago, was now\nexpecting a companion and friend. We had met in New York, shortly after\nher marriage, and were, therefore, not quite unacquainted. I, for my\npart, felt sure that when there were two of our sex–when my piano was\nsafely there–when the Post Library which we had purchased should be\nunpacked–when all should be fairly arranged and settled, we should be,\nalthough far away in the wilderness, the happiest little circle\nimaginable. All my anticipations were of the most sanguine and cheerful\ncharacter.",
        "It was a moderate-sized Mackinac boat, with a crew of soldiers, and our\nown three voyageurs in addition, that lay waiting for us–a dark-looking\nstructure of some thirty feet in length. Placed in the centre was a\nframe-work of slight posts, supporting a roof of canvas, with curtains\nof the same, which might be let down at the sides and ends, after the\nmanner of a country stage-coach, or rolled up to admit the light and\nair.",
        "In the midst of this little cabin or saloon was placed the box\ncontaining my piano, and on it a mattress, which was to furnish us a\ndivan through the day and a place of repose at night, should the weather\nat any time prove too wet or unpleasant for encamping. The boxes of\nsilver, with which my husband was to pay the annuities due his red\nchildren, by treaty-stipulation, were stowed next. Our mess-basket was\nin a convenient vicinity, and we had purchased a couple of large square\ncovered baskets of the Waubanakees, or New York Indians, to hold our\nvarious necessary articles of outward apparel and bedding, and at the\nsame time to answer as very convenient little work or dinner-tables.",
        "As a true daughter of New England, it is to be taken for granted I had\nnot forgotten to supply myself with knitting-work and embroidery. Books\nand pencils were a matter of course.",
        "The greater part of our furniture, together with the various articles\nfor housekeeping with which we had supplied ourselves in New York and\nDetroit, were to follow in another boat, under the charge of people\nwhose business it professed to be to take cargoes safely up the rapids\nand on to Fort Winnebago. This was an enterprise requiring some three\nweeks of time and a great amount of labor, so that the owners of the\ngoods transported might think themselves happy to receive them at last,\nhowever wet, broken, and dilapidated their condition might be. It was\nfor this reason that we took our choicest possessions with us, even at\nthe risk of being a little crowded.",
        "Until now I had never seen a gentleman attired in a colored shirt, a\nspotless white collar and bosom being one of those “notions” that\n\"Boston,” and consequently New England “folks,” entertained of the\nbecoming in a gentleman’s toilette. Mrs. Cass had laughingly forewarned\nme that not only calico shirts but patch-work pillow-cases were an\nindispensable part of a travelling equipment; and, thanks to the taste\nand skill of some tidy little Frenchwoman, I found our divan-pillows all\naccommodated in the brightest and most variegated garb.",
        "The Judge and my husband were gay with the deepest of blue and pink.\nEach was prepared, besides, with a bright red cap (a bonnet rouge, or\ntuque, as the voyageurs call it), which, out of respect for the lady,\nwas to be donned only when a hearty dinner, a dull book, or the want of\nexercise made an afternoon nap indispensable.",
        "The Judge was an admirable travelling companion. He had lived many years\nin the country, had been with General Cass on his expedition to the\nhead-waters of the Mississippi, and had a vast fund of anecdote\nregarding early times, customs, and inhabitants.",
        "Some instances of the mode of administering justice in those days, I\nhappen to recall.",
        "There was an old Frenchman at the Bay, named Réaume, excessively\nignorant and grasping, although otherwise tolerably good-natured. This\nman was appointed justice of the peace. Two men once appeared before\nhim, the one as plaintiff, the other as defendant. The justice listened\npatiently to the complaint of the one and the defence of the other;\nthen rising, with dignity, he pronounced his decision:",
        "“You are both wrong. You, Bois-vert,” to the plaintiff, “you bring me\none load of hay; and you, Crély,” to the defendant, “you bring me one\nload of wood; and now the matter is settled.” It does not appear that\nany exceptions were taken to this verdict.",
        "This anecdote led to another, the scene of which was Prairie du Chien,\non the Mississippi.",
        "There was a Frenchman, a justice of the peace, who was universally known\nby the name of “Old Boilvin.” His office was just without the walls of\nthe fort, and it was much the fashion among the officers to lounge in\nthere of a morning, to find sport for an idle hour, and to take a glass\nof brandy-and-water with the old gentleman, which he called “taking a\nlittle quelque-chose.”\nA soldier, named Fry, had been accused of stealing and killing a calf\nbelonging to M. Rolette, and the constable, a bricklayer of the name of\nBell, had been dispatched to arrest the culprit and bring him to trial.",
        "While the gentlemen were making their customary morning visit to the\njustice, a noise was heard in the entry, and a knock at the door.",
        "“Come in,” cried Old Boilvin, rising and walking toward the door.",
        "Bell,–Here, sir, I have brought Fry to you, as you ordered.",
        "Justice–Fry, you great rascal! What for you kill M. Rolette’s calf?",
        "Fry,–I did not kill M. Rolette’s calf.",
        "Justice (shaking his fist).–You lie, you great –– rascal! Bell,\ntake him to jail. Come, gentlemen, come, let us take a leetle\nquelque-chose.",
        "The Canadian boatmen always sing while rowing or paddling, and nothing\nencourages them so much as to hear the “bourgeois\"[5] take the lead in\nthe music. If the passengers, more especially those of the fair sex,\njoin in the refrain, the compliment is all the greater.",
        "Their songs are of a light, cheerful character, generally embodying some\nlittle satire or witticism, calculated to produce a spirited, sometimes\nan uproarious, chorus.",
        "The song and refrain are carried on somewhat in the following style:",
        "  BOURGEOIS.–Par-derrière chez ma tante,\n              Par-derrière chez ma tante.",
        "        CHORUS.–Par-derrière chez ma tante,\n                 Par-derrière chez ma tante.",
        "  BOURGEOIS.–Il y a un coq qui chante,\n              Des pommes, des poires, des raves, des choux,\n              Des figues nouvelles, des raisins doux.",
        "        CHORUS.–Des pommes, des poires, des raves, des choux,\n                 Des figues nouvelles, des raisins doux.",
        "  BOURGEOIS.–Il y a un coq qui chante,\n              Il y a un coq qui chante.",
        "        CHORUS.–Il y a un coq qui chante, etc.",
        "  BOURGEOIS.–Demande une femme à prendre,\n              Des pommes, des poires, des raves, des choux, etc.",
        "        CHORUS.–Des pommes, dos poires, etc.",
        "  BOURGEOIS.–Demande une femme à prendre,\n              Demande une femme à, etc.",
        "And thus it continues until the advice is given successively,",
        "  Ne prenez pas une noire,\n  Car elles aiment trop à boire,\n  Ne prenez pas une rousse,\n  Car elles sont trop jalouses.",
        "And by the time all the different qualifications are rehearsed and\nobjected to, lengthened out by the interminable repetition of the\nchorus, the shout of the bourgeois is heard–",
        "“Whoop la! à terre, à terre–pour la pipe!”",
        "It is an invariable custom for the voyageurs to stop every five or six\nmiles to rest and smoke, so that it was formerly the way of measuring\ndistances–\"so many pipes,” instead of “so many miles.”",
        "The Canadian melodies are sometimes very beautiful, and a more\nexhilarating mode of travel can hardly be imagined than a voyage over\nthese waters, amid all the wild magnificence of nature, with the\nmeasured strokes of the oar keeping time to the strains of ’Le Rosier\nBlanc,” “En roulant ma Boule,” or ’Lève ton pied, ma jolie Bergère.”\nThe climax of fun seemed to be in a comic piece, which, however oft\nrepeated, appeared never to grow stale. It was somewhat after this\nfashion:",
        "  BOURGEOIS.–Michaud est monté dans un prunier,\n              Pour treiller des prunes.\n              La branche a cassé–",
        "        CHORUS.–Michaud a tombé?",
        "  BOURGEOIS.–Ou est-ce qu’il est?",
        "        CHORUS.–Il est en bas.",
        "  BOURGEOIS.–Oh! reveille, reveille, reveille,\n              Oh! reveille, Michaud est en haut![6]",
        "It was always a point of etiquette to look astonished at the luck of\nMichaud in remaining in the tree, spite of the breaking of the branch,\nand the joke had to be repeated through all the varieties of\nfruit-trees that Michaud might be supposed able to climb.",
        "By evening of the first day we arrived at the Kakalin, where another\nbranch of the Grignon family resided. We were very pleasantly\nentertained, although, in my anxiety to begin my forest life, I would\nfain have had the tent pitched on the bank of the river, and have laid\naside, at once, the indulgences of civilization. This, however, would\nhave been a slight, perhaps an affront; so we did much better, and\npartook of the good cheer that was offered us in the shape of hot\nvenison steaks and crêpes, and that excellent cup of coffee which none\ncan prepare like a Frenchwoman, and which is so refreshing after a day\nin the open air.",
        "The Kakalin is a rapid of the Fox River, sufficiently important to make\nthe portage of the heavy lading of a boat necessary; the boat itself\nbeing poled or dragged up with cords against the current. It is one of a\nseries of rapids and chûtes, or falls, which occur between this point\nand Lake Winnebago, twenty miles above.",
        "The next morning, after breakfast, we took leave of our hosts, and\nprepared to pursue our journey. The bourgeois, from an early hour, had\nbeen occupied in superintending his men in getting the boat and its\nloading over the Kakalin. As the late rains had made the paths through\nthe woods and along the banks of the river somewhat muddy and\nuncomfortable for walking, I was put into an ox-cart, to be jolted over\nthe unequal road; saluting impartially all the stumps and stones that\nlay in our way, the only means of avoiding which seemed to be when the\nlittle, thick-headed Frenchman, our conductor, bethought him of suddenly\nguiding his cattle into a projecting tree or thorn-bush, to the great\ndetriment not only of my straw bonnet, but of my very eyes.",
        "But we got through at last, and, arriving at the head of the rapids, I\nfound the boat lying there, all in readiness for our re-embarking.",
        "Our Menomonee guide, Wish-tay-yun, a fine, stalwart Indian, with an\nopen, good-humored, one might almost say roguish countenance, came\nforward to be presented to me.",
        "“Bon-jour, bon-jour, maman,” was his laughing salutation. Again I was\nsurprised, not as before at the French, for to that I had become\naccustomed, but at the respectable title he was pleased to bestow upon\nme.",
        "“Yes,” said my husband, “you must make up your mind to receive a very\nnumerous and well-grown family, consisting of all the Winnebagoes,\nPottowattamies, Chippewas, and Ottawas, together with such Sioux, Sacs\nand Foxes, and Iowas, as have any point to gain in applying to me. By\nthe first-named tribe in virtue of my office, and by the others as a\nmatter of courtesy, I am always addressed as ’father’–you, of course,\nwill be their ’mother.’”",
        "Wish-tay-yun and I were soon good friends, my husband interpreting to me\nthe Chippewa language in which he spoke. We were impatient to be off,\nthe morning being already far advanced, and, all things being in\nreadiness, the word was given:",
        "“Pousse au large, mes gens!” (Push out, my men).",
        "At this moment a boat was seen leaving the opposite bank of the river\nand making towards us. It contained white men, and they showed by signs\nthat they wished to detain us until they came up. They drew near, and we\nfound them to be Mr. Marsh, a missionary among the Waubanakees, or the\nNew York Indians, lately brought into this country, and the Rev. Eleazar\nWilliams,[7] who was at that time living among his red brethren on the\nright bank of the Fox River.",
        "To persons so situated, even more emphatically than to those of the\nsettlements, the arrival of visitors from the “east countrie” was a\ngodsend indeed. We had to give all the news of various kinds that we had\nbrought–political, ecclesiastical, and social–as well as a tolerably\ndetailed account of what we proposed to do, or rather what we hoped to\nbe able to do, among our native children at the Portage.",
        "I was obliged, for my part, to confess that, being almost entirely a\nstranger to the Indian character and habits, I was going among them with\nno settled plans of any kind–general good-will, and a hope of making\nthem my friends, being the only principles I could lay claim to at\npresent. I must leave it for time and a better acquaintance to show me\nin what way the principle could be carried out for their greatest good.",
        "Mr. Williams was a dark-complexioned, good-looking man. Having always\nheard him spoken of, by his relations in Connecticut, as “our Indian\ncousin,” it never occurred to me to doubt his belonging to that race,\nalthough I now think that if I had met him elsewhere I should have taken\nhim for a Spaniard or a Mexican. His complexion had decidedly more of\nthe olive than the copper hue, and his countenance was grave, almost\nmelancholy. He was very silent during this interview, asking few\nquestions, and offering no observations except in reply to some question\naddressed to him.",
        "It was a hard pull for the men up the rapids. Wish-tay-yun, whose clear,\nsonorous voice was the bugle of the party, shouted and whooped–each one\nanswered with a chorus, and a still more vigorous effort. By-and-by the\nboat would become firmly set between two huge stones–",
        "“Whoop la! whoop! whoop!”",
        "Another pull, and another, straining every nerve–in vain.",
        "“She will not budge!”",
        "“Men, overboard!” and instantly every rower is over the side and into\nthe water.",
        "By pulling, pushing, and tugging, the boat is at length released from\nher position, and the men walk along beside her, helping and guiding\nher, until they reach a space of comparatively smooth water, when they\nagain take their seats and their oars.",
        "It will be readily imagined that there were few songs this day, but very\nfrequent pipes, to refresh the poor fellows after such an arduous\nservice.",
        "It was altogether a new spectacle to me. In fact, I had hardly ever\nbefore been called upon to witness severe bodily exertion, and my\nsympathies and sensibilities were, for this reason, the more enlisted on\nthe occasion. It seemed a sufficient hardship to have to labor in this\nviolent manner; but to walk in cold water up to their waists, and then\nto sit down in their soaking garments without going near a fire! Poor\nmen! this was too much to be borne! What, then, was my consternation to\nsee my husband, who, shortly after our noon-tide meal, had surprised me\nby making his appearance in a pair of duck trowsers and light jacket, at\nthe first cry of “Fast, again!” spring over into the water with the men,\nand “bear a hand” throughout the remainder of the long stretch!",
        "When he returned on board, it was to take the oar of a poor,\ndelicate-looking boy, one of the company of soldiers, who from the first\nhad suffered with bleeding at the nose on every unusual exertion. I was\nnot surprised, on inquiring, to find that this lad was a recruit just\nentered the service. He passed by the name of Gridley, but that was\nundoubtedly an assumed name. He had the appearance of having been\ndelicately nurtured, and had probably enlisted without at all\nappreciating the hardships and discomforts of a soldier’s life. This is\nevident from the dissatisfaction he always continued to feel, until at\nlength he deserted from his post. This was some months subsequent to the\ntime of which I am writing. He was once retaken, and kept for a time in\nconfinement, but immediately on his release deserted again, and his\nremains were found the following spring, not many miles from the fort.\nHe had died, either of cold or starvation. This is a sad interlude–we\nwill return to our boating.",
        "With all our tugging and toiling, we had accomplished but thirteen miles\nsince leaving the Kakalin, and it was already late when we arrived in\nview of the “Grande Chûte,” near which we were to encamp.",
        "We had passed the “Little Chûte” (the spot where the town of Appleton\nnow stands) without any further observation than that it required a vast\ndeal of extra exertion to buffet with the rushing stream and come off,\nas we did, victorious.",
        "The brilliant light of the setting sun was resting on the high wooded\nbanks through which broke the beautiful, foaming, dashing waters of the\nChûte. The boat was speedily turned towards a little headland projecting\nfrom the left bank, which had the advantage of a long strip of level\nground, sufficiently spacious to afford a good encamping ground. I\njumped ashore before the boat was fairly pulled up by the men, and with\nthe Judge’s help made my way as rapidly as possible to a point lower\ndown the river, from which, he said, the best view of the Chûte could be\nobtained. I was anxious to make a sketch before the daylight quite faded\naway.",
        "The left bank of the river was to the west, and over a portion less\nelevated than the rest the sun’s parting rays fell upon the boat, the\nmen with their red caps and belts, and the two tents already pitched.\nThe smoke now beginning to ascend from the evening fires, the high\nwooded bank beyond, up which the steep portage path could just be\ndiscerned, and, more remote still, the long stretch of waterfall now\ndarkening in the shadow of the overhanging forests, formed a lovely\nlandscape, to which the pencil of an artist could alone do justice.",
        "This was my first encampment, and I was quite enchanted with the novelty\nof everything about me.",
        "The fires had been made of small saplings and underbrush, hastily\ncollected, the mildness of the weather rendering anything beyond what\nsufficed for the purposes of cooking and drying the men’s clothes,\nsuperfluous. The soldiers’ tent was pitched at some distance from our\nown, but not too far for us to hear distinctly their laughter and\napparent enjoyment after the fatigues of the day.",
        "Under the careful superintendence of Corporal Kilgour, however, their\nhilarity never passed the bounds of respectful propriety, and, by the\ntime we had eaten our suppers, cooked in the open air with the simple\napparatus of a tea-kettle and frying-pan, we were, one and all, ready to\nretire to our rest.",
        "The first sound that saluted our ears in the early dawn of the following\nmorning, was the far-reaching call of the bourgeois:",
        "“How! how! how!” uttered at the very top of his voice.",
        "All start at that summons, and the men are soon turning out of their\ntents, or rousing from their slumbers beside the fire, and preparing for\nthe duties of the day.",
        "The fire is replenished, the kettles set on to boil, the mess-baskets\nopened, and a portion of their contents brought forth to be made ready\nfor breakfast. One Frenchman spreads our mat within the tent, whence the\nbedding has all been carefully removed and packed up for stowing in the\nboat. The tin cups and plates are placed around on the new-fashioned\ntable-cloth. The heavy dews make it a little too damp for us to\nbreakfast in the open air; otherwise our preparations would be made\noutside, upon the green grass. In an incredibly short time our smoking\ncoffee and broiled ham are placed before us, to which are added, from\ntime to time, slices of toast brought hot and fresh from the glowing\ncoals.",
        "There is, after all, no breakfast like a breakfast in the woods, with a\nwell-trained Frenchman for master of ceremonies.",
        "It was a hard day’s work to which the men now applied themselves, that\nof dragging the heavy boat up the Chûte. It had been thought safest to\nleave the piano in its place on board, but the rest of the lading had to\nbe carried up the steep bank, and along its summit, a distance of some\nhundreds of rods, to the smooth water beyond, where all the difficulties\nof our navigation terminated.",
        "The Judge kindly took charge of me while “the bourgeois” superintended\nthis important business, and with reading, sketching, and strolling\nabout, the morning glided away. Twelve o’clock came, and still the\npreparations for starting were not yet completed.",
        "In my rambles about to seek out some of the finest of the wild flowers\nfor a bouquet, before my husband’s return, I came upon the camp-fire of\nthe soldiers. A tall, red-faced, light-haired young man in fatigue dress\nwas attending a kettle of soup, the savory steams of which were very\nattractive.",
        "Seeing that I was observing his occupation, he politely ladled out a\ntin-cupful of the liquid and offered it to me.",
        "I declined it, saying we should have our dinner immediately.",
        "“They left me here to get their dinner,” said he, apparently not\ndispleased to have some one to talk to; “and I thought I might as well\nmake some soup. Down on the German Flats, where I come from, they always\nlike soup.”",
        "“Ah! you are from the German Flats–then your name must be Bellinger or\nWeber.”",
        "“No, it isn’t–it’s Krissman.”",
        "“Well, Krissman, how do you like the service?”",
        "“Very well. I was only recruited last summer. I used to ride horse on\nthe Canawl, and, as I can blow a horn first-rate, I expect I will soon\nbe able to play on a bugle, and then, when I get to be musician, you\nknow, I shall have extra pay.”",
        "I did not know it, but I expressed due pleasure at the information, and\nwishing Krissman all manner of success in his dreams of ambition, or\nrather, I should say, of avarice, for the hopes of “extra pay” evidently\npreponderated over those of fame, I returned to my own quarters.",
        "My husband, with his French tastes, was inclined to be somewhat\ndisappointed when I told him of this little incident, and my refusal of\nKrissman’s soup; but we were soon gratified by seeing his tall, awkward\nform bearing a kettle of the composition, which he set down before the\ntwo gentlemen, by whom, to his infinite satisfaction, it was pronounced\nexcellent.",
        "Everything being at length in readiness, the tents were struck and\ncarried around the Portage, and my husband, the Judge, and I followed at\nour leisure.",
        "The woods were brilliant with wild flowers, although it was so late in\nthe season that the glory of the summer was well-nigh past. But the\nlupin, the moss-pink, and the yellow wallflower, with all the varieties\nof the helianthus, the aster, and the solidago, spread their gay charms\naround. The gentlemen gathered clusters of the bittersweet (celastrus\nscandens) from the overhanging boughs to make a wreath for my hat, as we\ntrod the tangled pathway, which, like that of Christabel, was",
        "“Now in glimmer and now in gloom,”",
        "through the alternations of open glade and shady thicket. Soon, like the\nsame lovely heroine,",
        "“We reached the place–right glad we were,”",
        "and, without further delay, we were again on board our little boat and\nskimming over the now placid waters.",
        "Our encampment this night was the most charming that can be imagined.\nOwing to the heavy service the men had gone through in the earlier part\nof the day, we took but a short stage for the afternoon, and, having\npulled some seven or eight miles to a spot a short distance below the\n\"little Butte,” we drew in at a beautiful opening among the trees.",
        "The soldiers now made a regular business of encamping, by cutting down a\nlarge tree for their fire and applying themselves to the preparing of a\nsufficient quantity of food for their next day’s journey, a long\nstretch, namely, of twenty-one miles across Winnebago Lake. Our\nFrenchmen did the same. The fire caught in the light dry grass by which\nwe were surrounded, and soon all was blaze and crackle.",
        "Fortunately the wind was sufficient to take the flames all in one\ndirection, and, besides, there was not enough fuel to have made them a\nsubject of any alarm. We hopped upon the fallen logs, and dignified the\nlittle circumscribed affair with the name of “a prairie on fire.” The\nmost serious inconvenience was its having consumed all the dry grass,\nsome armfuls of which, spread under the bear-skin in my tent, I had\nfound, the night before, a great improvement to my place of repose.",
        "Our supper was truly delightful, at the pleasant sunset hour, under the\ntall trees beside the waters that ran murmuring by; and when the bright,\nbroad moon arose, and shed her flood of light over the scene, so wild\nyet so beautiful in its vast solitude, I felt that I might well be an\nobject of envy to the friends I had left behind.",
        "But all things have an end, and so must at last my enthusiasm for the\nbeauties around me, and, albeit unwillingly, I closed my tent and took\nmy place within, so near the fall of canvas that I could raise it\noccasionally and peep forth upon the night.",
        "In time all was quiet. The men had become silent, and appeared to have\nretired to rest, and we were just sinking to our slumbers, when a heavy\ntread and presently a bluff voice were heard outside.",
        "“Mr. Kinzie! Mr. Kinzie!”",
        "“Who is there? What is it?”",
        "“I’m Krissman; didn’t you mean, sir, that the men should have any liquor\nto-night?”",
        "“Of course I did. Has not Kilgour given out your rations?”",
        "“No: he says you did not say anything particular about it, and he was\nnot coming to ask you if you forgot it; but I thought I wouldn’t be\nbashful–I’d just come and ask.’”",
        "“That is right. Tell Kilgour I should like to have him serve out a\nration apiece.”",
        "“Thank you, sir,” in a most cheerful tone; “I’ll tell him.”",
        "Krissman was getting to be quite a character with us.",
        "A row of a few miles, on the following morning, brought us to Four-Legs’\nvillage,[8] at the entrance to Winnebago Lake, a picturesque cluster of\nIndian huts, spread around on a pretty green glade, and shaded by fine\nlofty trees.",
        "We were now fairly in the Winnebago country, and I soon learned that the\nodd-sounding name of the place was derived from the principal chief of\nthe nation, whose residence it was. The inhabitants were absent, having,\nin all probability, departed to their wintering grounds. We here took\nleave of our friend Wish-tay-yun, at the borders of whose country we had\nnow arrived.",
        "“Bon-jour, Chon!” (John:) ’bon-jour, maman.” A hearty shake of the\nhand completed his adieu, as we pushed off into the lake, and left him\nsmoking his kin-nee-kin-nick[9] and waiting until the spirit should move\nhim to take up his long Indian trot towards his home in the Menomonee\ncountry.",
        "With him our sunshine seemed to have departed. The skies, hitherto so\nbright and serene, became overcast, and, instead of the charming voyage\nwe had anticipated over the silver waters of the lake, we were obliged\nto keep ourselves housed under our canvas shelter, only peeping out now\nand then to catch a glimpse of the surrounding prospect through the\npouring rain.",
        "It was what might have been expected on an autumnal day, but we were\nunreasonable enough to find it tedious; so, to beguile the time and\nlessen my disappointment, my husband related to me some incidents of his\nearly history, apropos to the subject of “Four-Legs.”",
        "While he was living at Prairie du Chien, in the employ of the American\nFur Company, the chiefs and other Indians from the Upper Mississippi\nused frequently to come to the place to sell their furs and peltries,\nand to purchase merchandise, ammunition, trinkets, etc.",
        "As is usual with all who are not yet acclimated, he was seized with\nchills and fever. One day, while suffering with an unusually severe\naccess of the latter, a chief of the Four-Legs family, a brother to the\none before mentioned, came in to the Company’s warehouse to trade. There\nis no ceremony or restraint among the Indians: so, hearing that\nShaw-nee-aw-kee was sick, Four-Legs instantly made his way to him, to\noffer his sympathy and prescribe the proper remedies.",
        "Every one who has suffered from ague and the intense fever that succeeds\nit, knows how insupportable is the protracted conversation of an\ninconsiderate person, and will readily believe that the longer Four-Legs\ncontinued his pratings the higher mounted the fever of the patient, and\nthe more intolerable became the pain of head, back, and limbs.",
        "At length the old man arrived at the climax of what he had to say. “It\nwas not good for a young man, suffering with sickness, and away from his\nfamily, to be without a home and a wife. He had a nice daughter at home,\nhandsome and healthy, a capital nurse, the best hand in all the tribe at\ntrapping beaver and musk-rats. He was coming down again in the spring,\nand he would bring her with him, and Shaw-nee-aw-kee should see that he\nhad told no falsehood about her. Should he go now, and bring his\ndaughter the next time he came?”",
        "Stunned with his importunate babble, and anxious only for rest and\nquiet, poor Shaw-nee-aw-kee eagerly assented, and the chief took his\ndeparture.",
        "So nearly had his disorder been aggravated to delirium, that the young\nman forgot entirely, for a time, the interview and the proposal which\nhad been made him. But it was recalled to his memory some months after,\nwhen Four-Legs made his appearance, bringing with him a squaw of mature\nage, and a very Hecate for ugliness. She carried on her shoulders an\nimmense pack of furs, which, approaching with her awkward criss-crossgait, she threw at his feet, thus marking, by an Indian custom, her\nsense of the relation that existed between them.",
        "The conversation with her father now flashed across his mind, and he\nbegan to be sensible that he had got into a position that it would\nrequire some skill to extricate himself from.",
        "He bade one of the young clerks take up the pack and carry it into the\nmagazine where the furs were stored; then he coolly went on talking with\nthe chief about indifferent matters.",
        "Miss Four-Legs sat awhile with a sulky, discontented air; at length\nshe broke out,–",
        "“Humph! he seems to take no more notice of me than if I was nobody!”",
        "He again turned to the clerk.–\"Give her a calico shirt and half a dozen\nbread-tickets.”",
        "This did not dissipate the gloom on her countenance. Finding that he\nmust commence the subject, the father says,–",
        "“Well, I have brought you my daughter, according to our agreement. How\ndo you like her?”",
        "“Ah, yes–she is a very nice young woman, and would make a first-rate\nwife, I have no doubt. But do you know a very strange thing has happened\nsince you were here? Our father, Governor Cass,[10] has sent for me to\ncome to Detroit, that he may send me among the Wyandottes and other\nnations to learn their customs and manners. Now, if I go, as I shall be\nobliged to do, I shall be absent two or three years,–perhaps four. What\nthen? Why, the people will say, Shaw-nee-aw-kee has married Four-Legs’\ndaughter, and then has hated her and run away from her, and so everybody\nwill laugh at her, and she will be ashamed. It will be better to take\nsome good, valuable presents, blankets, guns, etc., and to marry her to\none of her own people, who will always stay by her and take care of\nher.”",
        "The old man was shrewd enough to see that it was wisest to make the best\nbargain he could. I have no doubt it cost a round sum to settle the\nmatter to the satisfaction of the injured damsel, though I have never\nbeen able to ascertain how much. This I know, that the young gentleman\ntook care not to make his next bargain while in a fit of the ague. The\nlady up on the Mississippi is called, in derision, by his name to this\nday.",
        "About midway of the lake we passed Garlic Island–a lovely spot,\ndeserving of a more attractive name. It belonged, together with the\nvillage on the opposite shore, to “Wild Cat,” a fat, jolly, good-natured\nfellow, by no means the formidable animal his name would imply.",
        "He and his band were absent, like their neighbors of Four-Legs’\nvillage, so there was nothing to vary the monotony of our sail. It was\ntoo wet to sing, and the men, although wrapped in their overcoats,\nlooked like drowned chickens. They were obliged to ply their oars with\nunusual vigor to keep themselves warm and comfortable, and thus probably\nfelt less than we, the dulness and listlessness of the cold, rainy,\nOctober day.",
        "Towards evening the sun shone forth. We had passed into the Fox River,\nand were just entering that beautiful little expanse known as Butte des\nMorts Lake, at the farther extremity of which we were to encamp for the\nnight.",
        "The water along its shores was green with the fields of wild rice, the\ngathering of which, just at this season, is an important occupation of\nthe Indian women. They push their canoes into the thick masses of the\nrice, bend it forward over the side with their paddles, and then beat\nthe ripe husks off the stalks into a cloth spread in the canoe. After\nthis, it is rubbed to separate the grain from the husk, and fanned in\nthe open air. It is then put in their cordage bags and packed away for\nwinter use. The grain is longer and more slender than the Carolina\nrice–it is of a greenish-olive color, and, although it forms a pleasant\narticle of food, it is far from being particularly nutritive. The\nIndians are fond of it in the form of soup, with the addition of birds\nor venison.",
        "The earth, the trees, and the shrubbery were all too much filled with\nthe heavy rain which had fallen to allow us to think of encamping, so we\nmade arrangements to bestow ourselves in our little saloon for the\nnight. It was rather a difficult matter to light a fire, but among the\nunderbrush, in a wild, undisturbed spot, there will always be found some\nfragments of dried branches, and tufts of grass which the rain has not\nreached, and by the assistance of the spunk, or light-wood, with which\ntravellers always go well provided, a comforting fire was at length\nblazing brightly.",
        "After our chilling, tedious day, it was pleasant to gather round it, to\nsit on the end of the blazing logs, and watch the Frenchmen preparing\nour supper–the kettle nestling in a little nook of bright glowing\ncoals–the slices of ham browning and crisping on the forked sticks, or\n\"broches,” which the voyageurs dexterously cut, and set around the\nburning brands–- the savory messes of “pork and onions” hissing in the\nfrying-pan, always a tempting regale to the hungry Frenchmen. Truly, it\nneeds a wet, chilly journey, taken nearly fasting, as ours had been, to\nenable one to enjoy to its full extent that social meal–a supper.",
        "The bright sun, setting amid brilliant masses of clouds, such as are\nseen only in our Western skies, gave promise of a fine day on the\nmorrow, with which comforting assurance we were glad to take our leave\nof him, and soon after of each other.",
        "We had hardly roused up the following morning, in obedience to the call\nof the bourgeois, when our eyes were greeted with the sight of an\naddition to our company–a tall, stalwart, fine-looking young mitiff,\nor half-breed, accompanied by two or three Indians. Vociferous and\njoyous were the salutations of the latter to their “father” and their\nnew “mother.” They were the first Winnebagoes I had seen, and they were\ndecidedly not the finest specimens of their tribe. The mitiff, a scion\nof the wide-spreading tree of the Grignons, was the bearer of an\ninvitation to us from Judge Law, who, with one or two Green Bay friends,\nwas encamped a few miles above, to come and breakfast with him in his\ntent. We had not dreamed of finding white neighbors here, but our\nvicinity could be no secret to them, as long as there was an Indian in\nthe neighborhood. So, delaying only for the soldiers to finish their\nbreakfast, we pushed on for the “Butte des Morts,” or, as Mrs. A always\npersisted in calling it, Betty More’s.",
        "The white tent of the Judge gleamed in the morning sun as we approached\nthe little rising ground on which it stood. The river was filled with\ncanoes, paddled principally by squaws. Many Indians were to be seen on\nthe banks, all with their guns and hunting accoutrements, for the air\nwas filled in every direction with flocks of teal, which at this season\nare most abundant and delicious. The immense fields of wild rice\nabounding here and in the little lake below, make this vicinity their\nfavorite place of resort in the autumn months. The effect of this\nnourishing food is to make the flesh of the birds so fat, so white, and\nso tender, that a caution is always given to a young sportsman to fire\nonly at such as fly very low, for if shot high in the air they are\nbruised to pieces and rendered unfit for eating by their fall to the\nground.",
        "We were hemmed in by a little fleet of canoes which surrounded us, the\nwomen chattering, laughing, and eagerly putting forward their little\nwooden bowls of fresh cranberries as an offering of welcome to me.",
        "I amused myself with tossing crackers to them, some of which would reach\nthem, others would fall into the water, and then such a scrambling and\nshouting! Hands and paddles were in requisition, and loud was the\ntriumph of her who was successful in reaching a floating one.",
        "Among the Indians with whom Shaw-nee-aw-kee was now engaged in shaking\nhands, and who all seemed old friends, were many fine, straight,\nwell-formed figures, all of them exhibiting frames capable of enduring\nfatigue and the hardships of their mode of life. One was describing with\nmuch gesticulation the abundance of the game in the neighborhood, and he\nseemed greatly delighted at receiving a quantity of ammunition, with\nwhich he instantly departed to make good his boasts in the matter.",
        "After walking a short distance, we reached the tent, where I was\nintroduced to Judge Law and a pleasant little gray-haired French\ngentleman of the name of Porlier. Several voyageurs and half-breeds were\nnear, the former busily at work, the latter lounging for the most part,\nand going through with what they had to do with a sort of listless\nindifference.",
        "The contrast between the “all-alive” air of the one class and the\napathetic manner of the other, was quite striking.",
        "After a short conversation among the members of the party, breakfast was\nannounced, and we entered the tent and took our seats on the ground\naround the Indian mat which supplied the place of a table.",
        "The post of honor, namely, the head of the table, was of course given\nto me, so that I could not only look around upon the circle of the\ncompany, but also enjoy a fine view out of the open door of the tent,\nand take an observation of all that was going on at the side-tableoutside. Judge Doty sat opposite me, with his back to the opening of the\ntent, and the other gentlemen on either hand. We had for our waiter the\ntall “mitiff” who had been the messenger of the morning. He was still in\nthe same garb–calico shirt, bright-colored scarf around his waist, and\non his head a straw hat encircled with a band of black ostrich feathers,\nthe usual dress of his class.",
        "The tin cups which were to hold our coffee were duly set around, then\nbreakfast-plates of the same metal, with knives and forks; then followed\nthe viands, among the most conspicuous of which was a large tin pan of\nboiled ducks.",
        "The Judge, wishing to show, probably, that, although we were in the vast\nwilderness, all fastidious nicety had not been left behind, took up the\nplate which had been set before him, and, seeing something adhering to\nit which did not exactly please him, handed it over his shoulder to\nGrignon, requesting him to wipe it carefully. Grignon complied by\npulling a black silk barcelona handkerchief out of his bosom, where it\nhad been snugly tucked away to answer any occasion that might present\nitself, and, giving the tin a furious polishing, handed it back again.\nThe Judge looked at it with a smile of approbation, and giving a glance\naround the table as much as to say, “You see how I choose to have things\ndone,” applied himself to his breakfast.",
        "The trail for Fort Winnebago then led from the shore opposite Butte des\nMorts, through Ma-zhee-gaw-gaw swamp, and past Green Lake, and it was\nwell for the Judge that his horses stood waiting for him to “mount and\naway” as early as possible after breakfast, or I am afraid the story I\nshould have been tempted to tell would have made his ride an\nuncomfortable one throughout the day.",
        "We had hardly finished breakfast when our hunter, who had received the\nammunition, returned, bringing with him about fifty fine ducks, which he\nhad shot in little more than an hour. From that time until the close of\nour journey our supply of these delicate birds was never wanting.",
        "The Butte des Morts, or Hillock of the Dead, was the scene long\nsince[11] of a most sanguinary battle between the French and the\nMis-qua-kees, or Foxes. So great was the carnage in this engagement,\nthat the memory of it has been perpetuated by the gloomy appellation\ngiven to the mound where the dead were buried. The Foxes up to this time\nhad inhabited the shores of the river to which they had given their\nname, but, being completely overwhelmed and beaten in this conflict,\nthey retired to the neighborhood of the Mississippi, and sought an\nasylum among their allies, the Saukies, or, as they are now called, the\nSauks, with whom they became gradually incorporated, until the combined\ntribes came to be known, as at present, by the name of “Sauks and\nFoxes.”",
        "Among the French inhabitants of the upper country, each tribe of Indians\nhas a particular appellation, descriptive of some peculiarity of either\ntheir habits or their personal appearance. Thus, the Chippewas, from\ntheir agility, are denominated “Sauteurs,” or Jumpers; the Ottawas, the\n\"Courtes-oreilles,” or Short-ears. The Menomonees, from the wild rice so\nabundant in their country, are called “Folles Avoines;\"–the\nWinnebagoes, from their custom of wearing the fur of a polecat on their\nlegs when equipped for war, are termed “les Puans;\"–the Pottowattamies,\nfrom their uncleanly habits, “les Poux;\"–the Foxes are “les Renards,\"\netc. etc.",
        "Hence you will never hear a French or half-breed resident of the country\nmention an Indian in any other style. “Such a person is a\n’Court-oreille.’” “Is that woman a ’Winnebago’?” “No, she is a ’Folle\nAvoine.’” In this manner a stranger is somewhat puzzled at first to\nclassify the acquaintances he forms.",
        "All the native friends with whom we were here surrounded were “les\nPuans,” or, to use their own euphonious appellation, the\n”Ho-tshung-rahs.”",
        "Having with great regret said adieu to our friend Judge Doty, whose\nsociety had contributed so much to the pleasure of our trip, and whose\nexample, moreover, had given us a valuable lesson to take things as we\nfind them, we bade good-bye at an early hour after breakfast to our kind\nhosts, and set forward on our journey.",
        "From Butte des Morts to the Portage, the distance by land is about\nseventy miles; by water, it is not less than a hundred and thirty, so\nserpentine is the course of the river through the low swampy prairies\nwhich stretch over a great portion of this part of the country.",
        "About six miles above the Butte, a tolerably broad stream, called Wolf\nRiver, joins the Fox, and as it is much the more direct and promising of\nthe two, strangers have sometimes mistaken it for the main stream, and\njourneyed up it a considerable distance before discovering, to their\ngreat chagrin, that they must retrace their steps.",
        "Beyond this place, the river begins to play its pranks with the compass.\nAs I was always looking out for pretty scenery to sketch, I was at one\nspot much attracted by a picturesque group on a bank quite close to the\nstream. There were broad overhanging trees, and two or three wigwams\nnestled under their shade. Bright-looking little children, quite\nunencumbered with clothing, were sporting about, and their two mothers\nwere sitting on the ground, engaged in the manufacture of a mat for\ntheir lodge. It was a pretty scene, and I commenced a sketch. As usual,\nthe whole party on the bank set up a shout when they recognized\nShaw-nee-aw-kee,–",
        "“Ee-awn-chee-wee-rah, Hee-nee-kar-ray-kay-noo.\"[12]",
        "It was an occasion on which they became demonstrative. After a little\ntime we proceeded, and I went on to complete my drawing. The sun kept\ncoming more and more into the wrong place. He had been just behind me,\npresently he was on my left hand, now he was straight ahead. I moved\nfrom time to time; at length the sun was decidedly on my right hand.\nWhat could be the matter? I looked up. “Oh, here is a pretty scene; I\nmust have this too! But how surprisingly like the one I have just\nfinished, only in a different direction.” Again we were greeted with\nshouts and laughter; it was the same spot which we had passed not an\nhour before, and, having taken a circuit of nearly four miles, we had\nreturned to find that we had made an actual progress of only the width\nof the bank on which the trees and wigwams stood. Decidedly not very\nencouraging to an impatient traveller.",
        "We reached Lake Puckaway late in the evening of our second day from\nButte des Morts. Here lived a white man named Gleason, the same\nconcerning whom, owing to his vast powers of exaggeration, poor Hooe was\nfond of uttering his little pun, “All is not gold that Gleasons.” We did\nnot seek shelter at his house, for, late as the season was, we found the\nshore so infested with mosquitoes that we were glad to choose a spot as\nfar as possible from the bank, and make ourselves comfortable in our\nboat.",
        "This lake has its name from the long flags or rushes which are found in\nits waters in great abundance, and of which the squaws manufacture the\ncoarse matting used in covering their wigwams. Their mode of fabricating\nthis is very primitive and simple. Seated on the ground, with the rushes\nlaid side by side, and fastened at each extremity, they pass their\nshuttle, a long flat needle made of bone, to which is attached a piece\nof cordage formed of the bark of a tree, through each rush, thus\nconfining it very closely, and making a fine substantial mat. These mats\nare seldom more than five or six feet in length, as a greater size would\nbe inconvenient in adjusting and preparing the lodges.",
        "It is a species of labor usually assigned to the elder women of the\nfamily. When they become broken down and worn out with exposure and\nhardship, so that they cannot cut down trees, hoe corn, or carry heavy\nburdens, they are set to weaving mats, taking care of the children, and\ndisciplining the dogs, with which every Indian lodge abounds.",
        "Lac de Boeuf, or Buffalo Lake, into which our course next brought us, is\na lovely sheet of water. In some places its banks are exceedingly\npicturesque, with beautiful headlands jutting out into the clear depths,\nwhere they, and the magnificent groups of trees which crown them, lie\nreflected as in a mirror. Now and then we would catch a glimpse of deer\ndarting across the glades which at intervals opened through the\nwoodlands, or a pair of sand-hill cranes would rise, slowly flapping\ntheir wings, and seek a place of more undisturbed repose. The flocks of\nteal now skimming the surface of the water, now rising higher towards\nthe shelter of the forests, tempted our sportsman sorely; but, as there\nwas little prospect of finding his game when it was brought down, he did\nnot give way to the wanton pleasure of shooting merely to destroy life.",
        "In quitting this charming lake, and again entering the narrow, tortuous\ncourse of the river, we bade adieu to everything like scenery, until we\nshould reach our journey’s end.",
        "We had now seventy miles to pass through a country perfectly monotonous\nand uninteresting, the distastefulness of which was aggravated by the\nknowledge that we could, had we been provided with horses or a carriage\nof any kind, have crossed over to the Portage from Gleason’s, through a\npleasant country, in little more than three hours. Even our great\nresource, the cheering, animating songs of our voyageurs, was out of the\nquestion; for the river, though deep, is so narrow that, in many places,\nthere is no room for the regular play of the oars; and the voices of\nFrenchmen can never “keep tune” unless their oars can “keep time.\"\nLapierre, one of our men, did his best with a paddle, or, as he called\nit, the ’little row,” but it was to no purpose–it would not go.\nBesides this, the wild rice abounds to such an extent in many places,\nthat it almost completely obstructs the progress of even a\nmoderate-sized boat, so that a passage through its tangled masses is\nwith difficulty forced by the oars. Tedious and monotonous as was the\nwhole course of the two following days, the climax of impatience and\ndiscouragement was not reached until we arrived in sight of the white\nwalls of Fort Winnebago, looking down from a rising ground upon the vast\nexpanse of low land through which the river winds.",
        "The Indians have a tradition that a vast serpent once lived in the\nwaters of the Mississippi, and that, taking a freak to visit the Great\nLakes, he left his trail through the prairies, which, collecting the\nwaters from the meadows and the rains of heaven as they fell, at length\nbecame the Fox River.",
        "The little lakes along its course were probably the spots where he\nflourished about in his uneasy slumbers at night. He must have played\nall the antics of a kitten in the neighborhood of the Portage. When the\nfort was first pointed out to me, I exclaimed, with delight, “Oh, we\nshall be there in half an hour!”",
        "“Not quite so soon,” said my husband, smiling. “Wait and see.” We sat\nand watched. We seemed approaching the very spot where we were to\ndisembark. We could distinguish the officers and a lady on the bank\nwaiting to receive us. Now we were turning our backs on them, and\nshooting out into the prairie again. Anon we approached another bank, on\nwhich was a range of comfortable-looking log houses. “That’s the\nAgency,” said my husband; “the largest house belongs to Paquette, the\ninterpreter, and the others are the dwellings of our Frenchmen. The\nlittle building, just at the foot of the hill, is the blacksmith’s shop,\nkept there by the Government, that the Indians may have their guns and\ntraps mended free of expense.”",
        "“But are we going to stop there?”",
        "“No; do you not see we are going back to the fort?”",
        "And, to be sure, our course had now turned, and we were setting in our\nfirst direction. In this manner, after tacking to the right and left and\nputting backwards and forwards during the greater part of two hours, we\nat length reached the little landing, on which the assembled party stood\nready to greet us.",
        "Major and Mrs. Twiggs, and a few of the younger officers (for nearly all\nof the older ones were absent), with our brother Robert, or, as he is\ncalled throughout all the Indian tribes, “Bob,” gave us a cordial\nwelcome–how cordial those alone can know who have come, like us, to a\nremote, isolated home in the wilderness. The Major insisted on our\ntaking possession at once of vacant quarters in the fort, instead of at\n\"the Agency,” as had been proposed.",
        "“No–we must be under the same roof with them. Mrs. Twiggs had been\nwithout a companion of her own sex for more than four months, and would\ncertainly not hear of a separation now. But we must be their guests\nuntil the arrival of the boats containing our furniture,” which, under\nthe care of our old acquaintance, Hamilton Arndt, was making its way\nslowly up from Green Bay.",
        "A dinner had been prepared for us. This is one of the advantages of the\nzigzag approach by the Fox River–travellers never take their friends by\nsurprise; and when the whole circle sat down to the hospitable board, we\nwere indeed a merry company.",
        "After dinner Mrs. Twiggs showed me the quarters assigned to us, on the\nopposite side of the spacious hall. They consisted of two large rooms on\neach of the three floors or stories of the building. On the ground-floor\nthe front room was vacant. The one in the rear was to be the\nsleeping-apartment, as was evident from a huge, unwieldy bedstead, of\nproportions amply sufficient to have accommodated Og, the King of\nBashan, with Mrs. Og and the children into the bargain. We could not\nrepress our laughter; but the bedstead was nothing to another structure\nwhich occupied a second corner of the apartment.",
        "This edifice had been built under the immediate superintendence of one\nof our young lieutenants, and it was plain to be seen that upon it both\nhe and the soldiers who fabricated it had exhausted all their\narchitectural skill. The timbers of which it was composed had been\ngrooved and carved; the pillars that supported the front swelled in and\nout in a most fanciful manner; the doors were not only panelled, but\nradiated in a way to excite the admiration of all unsophisticated eyes.\nA similar piece of workmanship had been erected in each set of quarters,\nto supply the deficiency of closets, an inconvenience which had never\noccurred, until too late, to the bachelors who planned them. The three\napartments of which each structure was composed, were unquestionably\ndesigned for clothes-press, store-room, and china-closet; such, at\nleast, were the uses to which Mrs. Twiggs had appropriated the one\nassigned to her. There was this slight difficulty, that in the latter\nthe shelves were too close to admit of setting in even a gravy-boat, but\nthey made up in number what was wanting in space. We christened the\nwhole affair, in honor of its projector, a “Davis,” thus placing the\nfirst laurel on the brow of one who was afterwards to signalize himself\nin Cabinet making of quite a different character.",
        "The bold promontory on which Fort Winnebago was built looked down upon\nthe extended prairie and the Fox River on one side, and on the other\nstretched away into the thickly-wooded ridge that led off to Belle\nFontaine and Lake Puckaway.",
        "In front lay an extent of meadow, across which was the Portage road, of\nabout two miles in length, leading between the Fox and the Wisconsin\nRivers. Teams of oxen and a driver were kept at the Agency by the\nGovernment, to transport the canoes of the Indians across this place,\nwhich at many seasons was wet, miry, and almost impassable.",
        "The woods were now brilliant with the many tints of autumn, and the\nscene around was further enlivened by groups of Indians, in all\ndirections, and their lodges, which were scattered here and there, in\nthe vicinity of the Agency buildings. On the low grounds might be seen\nthe white tents of the traders, already prepared to furnish winter\nsupplies to the Indians, in exchange for the annuity money they were\nabout to receive.",
        "A great concourse had been for many days assembling in anticipation of\nthe payment, which was expected to take place as soon as Shaw-nee-aw-kee\nshould arrive with the silver.",
        "Preparatory to this event, the great chief of the nation, Four-Legs,\nwhose village we had passed at the entrance to Winnebago Lake, had\nthought proper to take a little carouse, as is too apt to be the custom\nwhen the savages come into the neighborhood of a sutler’s establishment.\nIn the present instance, the facilities for a season of intoxication had\nbeen augmented by the presence on the ground of some traders, too\nregardless of the very stringent laws prohibiting the sale of liquor to\nthe Indians.",
        "Poor Four-Legs could not stand this full tide of prosperity. Unchecked\nby the presence of his Father, the agent, he carried his indulgence to\nsuch excess that he fell a victim in the course of a few days. His\nfuneral had been celebrated with unusual pomp the day before our\narrival, and great was my disappointment at finding myself too late to\nwitness all the ceremonies.",
        "His body, according to their custom, having been wrapped in a blanket,\nand placed in a rude coffin, along with his guns, tomahawk, pipes, and a\nquantity of tobacco, had been carried to the most elevated point of the\nhill opposite the fort, followed by an immense procession of his people,\nwhooping, beating their drums, howling, and making altogether what is\nemphatically termed a ’pow-wow“",
        "After the interment of the body, a stake was planted at its head, on\nwhich was painted in vermilion a series of hieroglyphics, descriptive of\nthe great deeds and events of his life The whole was then surrounded\nwith pickets of the trunks of the tamarack-trees, and hither the friends\nwould come for many successive days to renew the expression of their\ngrief, and to throw over the grave tobacco and other offerings to the\nGreat Spirit.",
        "It was a consolation to find that, although delayed, we were yet in time\nto furnish a quantity of white cotton for a flag to wave over the grave,\nand also to pay a considerable bill at the sutler’s for the different\narticles that had been found necessary for the funeral parade–it being\na duty expected of their Father to bury the dead suitably.",
        "The funeral observances in honor of the chief had not yet ceased.\nThroughout the day, and all that night, the sound of instruments,\nmingled with doleful lamentations, and with the discordant whoops and\nyells of those in a partial state of intoxication, filled the air, and\ndisturbed our repose. To these were added occasionally the plaintive\nsounds of the Indian flute, upon which the young savage plays when he is\nin love. Grief and whiskey had made their hearts tender, and the woods\nresounded to their melancholy strains.",
        "Early the following morning, before I left my room, I was startled by\nthe sounds of lamentation and woe proceeding from the adjoining\napartment. On entering it, I found several squaws seated on the floor,\nwith downcast looks expressive of condolence and sympathy, while in\ntheir midst sat a little ugly woman, in tattered garments, with\nblackened face and dishevelled hair, sobbing and wailing bitterly.",
        "Not doubting they were the family of the deceased chief, I was quite\ntroubled at my inability to express, otherwise than by gestures, my\nparticipation in their sorrows.",
        "Unacquainted as I was with their customs, I took it for granted from\ntheir wretched appearance that poverty and destitution formed one of the\nsources of their affliction. One of the party, at least, seemed in the\nvery depths of misery. “Can it be possible,” said I to myself, “that\nthis poor creature has only these scanty rags to cover her?”",
        "Stepping back to my own room, I brought out a pretty calico wrapper,\nwhich I presented to the little, dirty, blackened object. She took it,\nand commenced a fresh series of sobbing and sighing. I made signs to her\nto put it on, opening it and explaining to her how it was to be worn,\nand recommending to her, by gestures, to lose no time in making herself\nmore comfortable.",
        "At this, the other women burst into a laugh.",
        "“Very mal-à-propos,” thought I, “and somewhat unfeeling.” At that moment\nmy husband, entering, explained to me that the chief mourner was Madame\nFour-Legs, the widow; that she had undoubtedly a comfortable wardrobe at\nhome, but that it was part of the etiquette of mourning to go for a\nseason with neglected persons and blackened faces. All this was told me\nin the intervals of shaking hands, and offering and receiving\ncondolences in the most uncouth, guttural language I had ever heard.\nTheir Father at length dismissed them, with a promise of some presents\nto help dry up their tears. It must not be inferred that the grief of\nthe poor little widow was not sincere. On the contrary, she was greatly\nattached to her husband, and had had great influence not only with him\nbut with the nation at large. She was a Fox woman, and spoke the\nChippewa, which is the court language among all the tribes, so that she\nwas often called upon to act as interpreter, and had, in fact, been in\nthe habit of accompanying her husband, and assisting him by her counsels\nupon all occasions. She was a person of great shrewdness and judgment,\nand, as I afterwards experienced, of strong and tenacious affections.",
        "After breakfast I received a visit from the principal chiefs, who had\nput on their best of apparel and paint to receive their new mother.",
        "There was Naw-kaw, or Kar-ray-mau-nee, “the Walking Turtle,” now the\nprincipal chief of the nation, a stalwart Indian, with a broad, pleasant\ncountenance, the great peculiarity of which was an immense under lip,\nhanging nearly to his chin. There was the old Day-kau-ray, the most\nnoble, dignified, and venerable of his own, or indeed of any tribe. His\nfine Roman countenance, rendered still more striking by his bald head,\nwith one solitary tuft of long silvery hair neatly tied and falling back\non his shoulders; his perfectly neat, appropriate dress, almost without\nornament, and his courteous demeanor, never laid aside under any\ncircumstances, all combined to give him the highest place in the\nconsideration of all who knew him. It will hereafter be seen that his\ntraits of character were not less grand and striking than were his\npersonal appearance and deportment.",
        "There was Black-Wolf, whose lowering, surly face was well described by\nhis name. The fierce expression of his countenance was greatly\nheightened by the masses of heavy black hair hanging round it, quite\ncontrary to the usual fashion among the Winnebagoes. They, for the most\npart, remove a portion of their hair, the remainder of which is drawn to\nthe back of the head, clubbed and ornamented with beads, ribbons, cock’s\nfeathers, or, if they are so entitled, an eagle’s feather for every\nscalp taken from an enemy.",
        "There was Talk-English, a remarkably handsome, powerful young Indian,\nwho received his name in the following manner. He was one of a party of\nsixteen Winnebagoes who had, by invitation, accompanied their Agent and\nMajor Forsyth (or the Chippewa, as he was called) on a visit to the\nPresident at Washington, the year previous.",
        "On the journey, the question naturally addressed to them by people not\nfamiliar with Western Indians was,–",
        "“Do you talk English?”",
        "The young fellow, being very observant, came to his Father. “What do\nthey mean by this? Everybody says to me, talk English!“",
        "The Agent interpreted the words to him. “Ah, very well.”",
        "The next place they arrived at was Lockport, in the State of New York.\nJumping off the canal-boat upon the lock, he ran up to the first man he\nmet, and, thrusting forward his face, cried out, “Talk Eengeesh?”",
        "“Yes,” said the man; “do you talk English?”",
        "“Ya-as.”",
        "From that time forward he always bore the name of Talk-English, and\nwas registered on the pay-rolls by a title of which he was not a little\nproud.",
        "Hoo-wau-ne-kah, “the Little Elk,” was another of the distinguished men\nof the tribe. He had likewise been at Washington. Henry Clay, when he\nvisited them, after looking carefully at the countenances and bearing\nof all the members of the deputation, had indicated him as the one\npossessing the greatest talent; and he was greatly pleased when informed\nthat he was the principal orator of the nation, and decidedly superior\nin abilities to any other individual of the tribe.",
        "Wild-Cat, our Indian Falstaff in all save the cowardice and falsehood, I\nhave already mentioned.",
        "Then there was Kau-ray-kaw-saw-kaw, “the White Crow,” a Rock River\nIndian, who afterwards distinguished himself as the friend of the whites\nduring the Sauk war. He was called by the French “le Borgne,” from\nhaving lost an eye; and the black silk handkerchief which he wore\ndrooping over the left side of his face to disguise the blemish, taken\nwith his native costume, gave him a very singular appearance.",
        "There was a nephew of the defunct chief Four-Legs, to whom with justice\nwas given, by both whites and Indians, the appellation of “the Dandy.\"\nWhen out of mourning his dress was of the most studied and fanciful\ncharacter. A shirt (when he condescended to wear any) of the brightest\ncolors, ornamented with innumerable rows of silver brooches set thickly\ntogether; never less than two pairs of silver arm-bands; leggings and\nmoccasins of the most elaborate embroidery in ribbons and\nporcupine-quills; everything that he could devise in the shape of\nornament hanging to his club of hair behind; a feather fan in one hand,\nand in the other a mirror, in which he contemplated himself every five\nminutes; these, with the variety and brilliancy of the colors upon his\nface, the suitable choice and application of which occupied no small\nportion of the hours allotted to his toilet, made up the equipment of\nyoung Four-Legs.",
        "This devotion to dress and appearance seemed not altogether out of\nplace in a youthful dandy; but we had likewise an old one of the same\nstamp. Pawnee Blanc, or the White Pawnee, surpassed his younger\ncompetitor, if possible, in attention to his personal attractions.",
        "Upon the present occasion he appeared in all his finery, and went\nthrough the customary salutations with an air of solemn dignity, then\nwalked, as did the others, into the parlor (for I had received them in\nthe hall), where they all seated themselves upon the floor. Fortunately,\nthe room was now bare of furniture, but “alas!” thought I, “for my\npretty carpet, if this is to be the way they pay their respects to me!\"\nI watched the falling of the ashes from their long pipes, and the other\ninconveniences of the use of tobacco, or kin-nee-kin-nick, with absolute\ndismay.",
        "The visit of the chiefs was succeeded by one from the interpreter and\nhis wife, with all the Canadian and half-breed women, whose husbands\nfound employment at the Agency or at the American Fur Company’s\nestablishment.",
        "By this time my piano had been taken from its case and set up in our\nquarters. To our great joy, we found it entirely uninjured. Thanks to\nthe skill of Nunns and Clark, not a note was out of tune.",
        "The women, to whom it was an entire novelty, were loud in their\nexclamations of wonder and delight.",
        "“Eh-h-h! regardez donc! Quelles inventions! Quelles merveilles!“[13]",
        "One, observing the play of my fingers reflected in the nameboard, called\nin great exultation to her companions. She had discovered, as she\nthought, the hidden machinery by which the sounds were produced, and was\nnot a little mortified when she was undeceived.",
        "As the boats might be expected in a few days, it was thought best to\nbegin at once what preparations were in my power towards housekeeping.\nThese were simply the fitting and sewing of my carpets, in which I was\nkindly assisted by Mrs. Twiggs; and, the wife of one of our Frenchmen\nhaving come over from the Agency and made everything tidy and\ncomfortable, the carpets were soon tacked down, and the rooms were ready\nfor the reception of the rest of the furniture.",
        "I had made many fruitless attempts, both in Detroit and Green Bay, to\nprocure a servant-woman to accompany me to my new home. Sometimes one\nwould present herself, but, before we could come to a final agreement,\nthe thoughts of the distance, of the savages, the hardships of the\njourney, or, perhaps, the objections of friends, would interfere to\nbreak off the negotiation; so that I had at length been obliged to rest\nsatisfied with the simple hope held out by my husband, that one of his\nFrench employés, with his wife, would be contented to take up their\nabode with us.",
        "In this state of things, all difficulties seemed to be obviated by the\nproposal of Major Twiggs, that we should take into our service a young\ncolored girl whom he had brought from Buffalo, in the spring, to wait on\nMrs. T. until her own servants should arrive from the South.",
        "Louisa was accordingly sent for, an uncommonly handsome young negress,\nwith an intelligent but very demure countenance, who called herself\nfifteen years of age, but who, from the progress in vice and iniquity I\nafterwards discovered her to have made, must have been at least several\nyears older. Be that as it may, she now seemed to have no fault but\ncarelessness and inexperience, both of which I had great hopes she would\nget the better of, under careful training.",
        "My first week’s visit with Mrs. Twiggs had just expired when word was\ngiven that the boats were in sight–the boats that contained our\nfurniture–and the expected arrival of Louis Philippe to visit Queen\nVictoria could scarcely have created a more universal sensation, than\ndid this announcement in our little community. Although we knew that\nsome hours must yet elapse before they could reach the spot for\ndisembarkation, we were constantly on the watch, and at length all the\nyoung officers, followed by as many of the soldiers as were off duty,\naccompanied Mr. Kinzie down the bank to the landing, to witness and, if\nnecessary, to assist in helping everything safe to land.",
        "Sad was the plight in which matters were found. The water poured out of\nthe corners of the boxes as they were successively hoisted on shore. Too\nimpatient to wait until they could be carried up to the fort, the\ngentlemen soon furnished themselves with, hammers and hatchets, and fell\neagerly to work, opening the boxes to explore the extent of the damage.\nAlas for the mahogany! not a piece from which the edges and veneering\nwere not starting. It had all the appearance of having lain under the\nGrande Chûte for days. Poor Hamilton was load in his protestations and\nexcuses.",
        "It was the fault of the men, of the weather, of the way the things were\npacked. “Confound it! he had taken the best care of the things he\npossibly could–better than he had ever taken before–it would get\ndone!”",
        "There was nothing but to be patient and make the best of it. And when\nthe pretty sideboard and work-table had been thoroughly rubbed and set\nup, and all the little knick-knacks arranged on the mantel-piece–when\nthe white curtains were hung at the windows, and the chairs and\ndining-table each in its proper place in relation to the piano, our\nparlor was pronounced “magnificent.” At least so seemed to think\nHamilton, who came to give one admiring look, and to hear the music of\nthe piano, which was a perfect novelty to him. His description of it to\nthe young officers, after his return to the Bay, was expressive of his\nadmiration and wonder–\"There it stood on its four legs! Anybody might\ngo up and touch it!”",
        "In due time the dinner- and tea-sets were carefully bestowed in the\n\"Davis,” together with sundry jars of sweetmeats that I had prepared in\nDetroit; the iron and tin utensils were placed in a neat cupboard in the\nkitchen, of which my piano-box supplied the frame; the barrel of eggs\nand tubs of butter, brought all the way from Ohio, were ranged in the\nstore-room; a suitable quantity of salt pork and flour was purchased\nfrom the commissary; and, there being no lack of game of every\ndescription, the offering of our red children, we were ready to commence\nhousekeeping.",
        "The first dinner in her own home is an era in the life of a young\nhousekeeper. I shall certainly never forget mine. While I was in the\nlower regions superintending my very inexpert little cook, my husband\nmade his appearance, to say that, as the payment (then the all-absorbing\ntopic of interest) would not commence until afternoon, he had invited M.\nRolette, Mr. Hempstead, and four other gentlemen to dine with us.",
        "“So unexpected–so unprepared for?”",
        "“Never mind; give them anything you have. They have been living for\nsome days in tents, and anything will taste well to them.”",
        "My dinner had been intended to consist chiefly of a venison pasty, and\nfortunately the only dish among my store was of very large proportions,\nso that there was already smoking in the oven a pie of a size nearly\nequal to the famous Norwich pudding; thus, with some trifling additions\nto the bill of fare, we made out very well, and the master of the house\nhad the satisfaction of hearing the impromptu dinner very much commended\nby his six guests.",
        "There were two divisions of the Winnebago Indians, one of which was paid\nby the Agent, at the Portage, the other at Prairie du Chien, by General\nStreet. The first, between four and five thousand in number, received,\naccording to treaty stipulations, fifteen thousand dollars annually,\nbesides a considerable amount of presents, and a certain number of\nrations of bread and pork, to be issued in times of emergency throughout\nthe year.",
        "The principal villages of this division of the tribe were at Lake\nWinnebago, Green and Fox Lakes, the Barribault, Mud Lake, the Four\nLakes, Kosh-ko-nong, and Turtle Creek. Messengers were dispatched, at or\nbefore the arrival of the annuity-money, to all the different villages,\nto notify the heads of families or lodges to assemble at “the Portage.”",
        "When arrived, the masters of families, under their different chiefs,\ngive in their names, and the number in their lodges, to be registered.\nAs, in paying, a certain sum of money is apportioned to each individual,\nit is, of course, an object to the head of a lodge to make the number\nregistered as great as possible. Each one brings his little bundle of\nsticks, and presents it to the Agent to register. Sometimes a dialogue\nlike the following occurs:",
        "“How many have you in your lodge?”",
        "The Indian carefully, and with great ceremony, counts his bundle of\nsticks–\"Fifteen”",
        "“How many men?”",
        "“Two.” The Agent lays aside two sticks",
        "“How many women?”",
        "“Three.” Three more sticks are separated.",
        "“How many children?”",
        "“Eight” Eight sticks are added to the heap.",
        "“What is the meaning of these two sticks that remain?”",
        "The culprit, whose arithmetic has not served him to carry out his\ndeception, disappears amid the shouts and jeers of his companions, who\nare always well pleased at the detection of any roguery in which they\nhave had no share.",
        "The young officers generally assisted in counting out and delivering the\nmoney at these payments, and it was no unusual thing, as the last band\ncame up, for the chiefs to take a quantity of silver out of the box and\nrequest their Father to pay his friends for their trouble, seeming\nreally disturbed at his refusal. In this, as in almost every instance,\nwe see the native courtesy and politeness, which are never lost sight of\namong them. If a party comes to their Father to beg for provisions, and\nfood is offered them, however hungry they may be, each waits patiently\nuntil one of the company makes an equal distribution of the whole, and\nthen, taking his share, eats it quietly, with the greatest moderation. I\nnever saw this rule violated, save in one instance.",
        "Our friend, Pawnee Blanc, the Old Dandy, once came with a party of\nIndians, requesting permission to dance for us in the open space before\nthe door. It was a warm, dusty afternoon, and as our friends grew heated\nand fatigued with the violent and long-continued exercise, a pitcher of\nraspberry negus was prepared and sent out to them. Pawnee received the\npitcher and tumbler, and, pouring the latter about half full, gave it to\nthe first of the circle, then filled the same for the next, and so on,\nuntil it suddenly occurred to him to look into the pitcher. What he saw\nthere determined his course of action; so, setting the tumbler upon the\nground, he raised the pitcher with both hands to his lips and gave a\nhearty pull, after which he went on, giving less and less, until he was\ncalled to have the pitcher replenished. All present agreed it was the\nonly instance they had ever witnessed, of an Indian’s appearing afraid\nof getting less of a thing than his share.",
        "During the payment a good many kegs of whiskey find their way into the\nlodges of the Indians, notwithstanding the watchfulness of both officers\nand Agent. Where there is a demand there will always be a supply, let\nthe legal prohibitions be what they may. The last day of the payment is,\ninvariably, one of general carousing.",
        "When the men begin their frolic, the women carefully gather all the\nguns, knives, tomahawks, and weapons of every description, and secrete\nthem, that as little mischief as possible may be done in the absence of\nall restraint and reason. I am sorry to record that our little friend,\nPawnee Blanc, was greatly addicted to the pleasures of the bottle.",
        "Among the presents for the chiefs, which Shaw-nee-aw-kee had brought\nfrom the East, was a trunk of blue cloth coats, trimmed with broad gold\nlace, and a box of round black hats, ornamented in a similar manner. All\nwho are familiar with Indians, of whatever tribe, will have observed\nthat their first step towards civilization, whether in man or woman, is\nmounting a man’s hat, decorated with tinsel; ribbons, or feathers.\nPawnee was among the happy number remembered in the distribution; so,\ndonning at once his new costume, and tying a few additional bunches of\ngay-colored ribbons to a long spear, that was always his baton of\nceremony, he came at once, followed by an admiring train, chiefly of\nwomen, to pay me a visit of state.",
        "The solemn gravity of his countenance, as he motioned away those who\nwould approach too near and finger his newly-received finery–the\ndignity with which he strutted along, edging this way and that to avoid\nany possible contact from homely, every-day wardrobes–augured well for\na continuance of propriety and self-respect, and a due consideration of\nthe good opinion of all around. But, alas for Pawnee! late in the day we\nsaw him assisted towards his lodge by two stout young Indians, who had\npulled him out of a ditch, his fine coat covered with mud, his hat\nbattered and bruised, his spear shorn of its gay streamers, and poor\nPawnee himself weeping and uttering all the doleful lamentations of a\ntipsy Indian.",
        "Among the women with whom I early made acquaintance was the wife of\nWau-kaun-zee-kah, the Yellow Thunder. She had accompanied her husband,\nwho was one of the deputation to visit the President, and from that time\nforth she had been known as “the Washington woman.” She had a pleasant,\nold-acquaintance sort of air in greeting me, as much as to say, “You\nand I have seen something of the world.” No expression of surprise or\nadmiration escaped her lips, as her companions, with childlike, laughing\nsimplicity, exclaimed and clapped their hands at the different wonderful\nobjects I showed them. Her deportment said plainly, “Yes, yes, my\nchildren, I have seen all these things before.” It was not until I put\nto her ear a tropical shell, of which I had a little cabinet, and she\nheard its murmuring sound, that she laid aside her apathy of manner. She\npoked her finger into the opening to get at the animal within, shook it\nviolently, then raised it to her ear again, and finally burst into a\nhearty laugh, and laid it down, acknowledging, by her looks, that this\nwas beyond her comprehension.",
        "I had one shell of peculiar beauty–my favorite in the whole\ncollection–a small conch, covered with rich, dark veins. Each of the\nvisitors successively took up this shell, and by words and gestures\nexpressed her admiration, evidently showing that she had an eye for\nbeauty–this was on the occasion of the parting visit of my red\ndaughters.",
        "Shortly after the payment had been completed, and the Indians had left,\nI discovered that my valued shell was missing from the collection. Could\nit be that one of the squaws had stolen it? It was possible–they would\noccasionally, though rarely, do such things under the influence of\nstrong temptation. I tried to recollect which, among the party, looked\nmost likely to have been the culprit. It could not have been the\nWashington woman–she was partly civilized, and knew better.",
        "A few weeks afterwards Mrs. Yellow Thunder again made her appearance,\nand carefully unfolding a gay-colored chintz shawl, which she carried\nrolled up in her hand, she produced the shell, and laid it on the table\nbefore me. I did not know whether to show, by my countenance,\ndispleasure at the trick she had played me, or joy at receiving my\ntreasure back again, but at length decided that it was the best policy\nto manifest no emotion whatever.",
        "She prolonged her visit until my husband’s return, and he then\nquestioned her about the matter.",
        "“She had taken the shell to her village, to show to some of her people,\nwho did not come to the payment.”",
        "“Why had she not asked her mother’s leave before carrying it away?”",
        "“Because she saw that her mother liked the shell, and she was afraid she\nwould say, No.”",
        "This was not the first instance in which Madame Washington had displayed\nthe shrewdness which was a predominant trait in her character. During\nthe visit of the Indians to the Eastern cities, they were taken to\nvarious exhibitions, museums, menageries, theatres, etc. It did not\nescape their observation that some silver was always paid before\nentrance, and they inquired the reason. It was explained to them. The\nwoman brightened up, as if struck with an idea.",
        "“How much do you pay for each one?”",
        "Her Father told her.",
        "“How do you say that in English?”",
        "“Two shillings.”",
        "“Two shinnin–humph” (good).",
        "The next day, when, as usual, visitors began to flock to the rooms where\nthe Indians were sojourning, the woman and a young Indian, her\nconfederate, took their station by the door, which they kept closed.\nWhen any one knocked, the door was cautiously opened, and the woman,\nextending her hand, exclaimed–”Two shinnin.”",
        "This was readily paid in each instance, and the game went on, until she\nhad accumulated a considerable sum. But this did not satisfy her. At the\nfirst attempt of a visitor to leave the room, the door was held close,\nas before, the hand was extended, and ’Two shinnin” again met his ear.\nHe tried to explain that, having paid for his entrance, he must go out\nfree. With an innocent shake of the head, ’Two shinnin,” was all the\nEnglish she could understand.",
        "The Agent, who had entered a short time before, and who, overhearing the\ndialogue, sat laughing behind his newspaper, waiting to see how it would\nall end, now came forward and interfered, and the guests were permitted\nto go forth without a further contribution.",
        "The good woman was moreover admonished that it was far from the custom\nof white people to tax their friends and visitors in this manner, and\nthat the practice must be laid aside in future.",
        "Another instance of the disposition of the Indians to avail themselves\nof all the goods that fortune throws in their way, was the following:",
        "Upon the same trip, while passing through Ohio, one of the party\ninquired of the Agent,–",
        "“Do you pay for all those provisions that are set before us at the\nhotels?”",
        "“Yes. Why do you ask?”",
        "“Nothing: I thought you perhaps paid for just what we ate of them.”",
        "At the next stopping-place a fine breakfast was set upon the table, of\nwhich, as usual, they partook plentifully. Just as they had finished,\nthe horn sounded for all to take their places in the stage-coaches. Each\nsprang to his feet. One seized the plates of biscuits and poured them\ninto the corner of his blanket; another the remains of a pair of\nchickens; a third emptied the sugar-bowls; each laid hold of what was\nnearest him, and in a trice nothing was left upon the table but the\nempty plates and dishes. The landlord and waiters, meanwhile, stood\nlaughing and enjoying the trick as much as any of the spectators.",
        "Upon another occasion, their Father had endeavored to impress upon them\nthe unseemliness of throwing their refuse pieces, bones, and fragments\nof food about on the table-cloth, pointing out to them the orderly\nmanner of the whites at table, and the propriety of keeping everything\nneat and nice around them.",
        "At their next meal, they were served first with a chicken-pie, of which\nthey ate very heartily, and the accumulation of bones on their plates\nwas very abundant. Presently another and more favorite dish appeared,–a\nfine, large, roasted turkey. A gentleman sat near, and was evidently\npreparing to carve it. No time was to be lost. What was to be done with\nthe bones? They looked around in some perplexity. A large apple-pie was\nstanding near. The most eager drew it towards him, and quick as thought\nall the bones were deposited upon it, while, with a triumphant laugh at\nthe happy idea, he coolly transferred the bird to his own dish, and\nproceeded to distribute it among his companions. The amazed stranger\nsoon joined in the laugh at the unceremonious manner in which his share\nof the dinner had vanished.",
        "The payment was now over, and the Indians had dispersed and gone to\ntheir wintering grounds. The traders, too, had departed, laden with a\ngood share of the silver, in exchange for which each family had provided\nitself, as far as possible, with clothing, guns, traps, ammunition, and\nthe other necessaries for their winter use. The Indians are good at a\nbargain. They are not easily overreached. On the contrary, they\nunderstand at once when a charge is exorbitant; and a trader who tries\nhis shrewdness upon them is sure to receive an expressive sobriquet,\nwhich ever after clings to him.",
        "For instance, M. Rolette was called by them “Ah-kay-zaup-ee-tah,” five\nmore–because, as they said, let them offer what number of skins they\nmight, in bartering for an article, his terms were invariably “five\nmore”",
        "Upon one occasion a lady remarked to him, “Oh, M. Rolette, I would not\nbe engaged in the Indian trade; it seems to me a system of cheating the\npoor Indians.”",
        "“Let me tell you, madame,” replied he, with great naïveté, “it is not\nso easy a thing to cheat the Indians as you imagine. I have tried it\nthese twenty years, and have never succeeded!”",
        "We were now settled down to a quiet, domestic life. The military system\nunder which everything was conducted–the bugle-call, followed by the\nmusic of a very good band, at reveille; the light, animated strains for\n\"sick-call,” and soon after for “breakfast;” the longer ceremony of\n\"guard-mounting;” the “Old English Roast-Beef,” to announce the\ndinner-hour; the sweet, plaintive strains of “Lochaber no more,\"\nfollowed most incongruously by “The Little Cock-Sparrow,” at retreat;\nand, finally, the long, rolling “tattoo,” late in the evening–made\npleasant divisions of our time, which, by the aid of books, music, and\ndrawing, in addition to household occupations, seemed to fly more\nswiftly than ever before. It was on Sunday that I most missed my Eastern\nhome. I had planned beforehand what we should do on the first recurrence\nof this sacred day, under our own roof. “We shall have at least,” said I\nto myself, “the Sabbath’s quiet and repose, and I can, among other\nthings, benefit poor Louisa by giving her some additional lessons of a\nserious character.”",
        "So, while she was removing the breakfast-things, I said to her,–",
        "“Now, Louisa, get your work all finished, and everything put neatly\naside, and then come here to me again.”",
        "“Yes, ma’am.”",
        "We sat down to our books, and read and waited; we waited and read\nanother hour–no Louisa.",
        "There was music and the sound of voices on the parade in front of our\nwindows, but that did not disturb us; it was what we were daily\naccustomed to.",
        "I must go at length, and see what could be keeping my damsel so. I\ndescended to the kitchen. The breakfast-things stood upon the table–the\nkettles and spider upon the hearth–the fire was out–the kitchen empty.",
        "Passing back into the hall, which extended the whole length of the house\nand opened in front upon the parade, I perceived a group collected in\nthe area, of all shades and colors, and in the midst, one round, woolly\nhead which I could not mistake, bobbing up and down, now on this side,\nnow on that, while peals of laughter were issuing from the whole group.",
        "“Louisa,” I called, “come here. What are you doing there?”",
        "“Looking at inspection.”",
        "“But why are not your breakfast-things washed, and your kitchen swept?\nDid I not tell you I wished you to come up and learn your lessons?”",
        "“Yes, ma’am; but I had to see inspection first. Everybody looks at\ninspection on Sunday.”",
        "I found it was in vain to expect to do more for Louisa than give her an\nafternoon’s lesson, and with that I was obliged to content myself.",
        "I felt that it would be very pleasant, and perhaps profitable, for all\nthe inmates of the garrison to assemble on this day; one of our number\nmight be found who would read a portion of the church-service, with a\nsermon from one of our different selections.",
        "I approached the subject cautiously, with an inquiry to this effect:",
        "“Are there none among the officers who are religiously disposed?”",
        "“Oh, yes,” replied the one whom I addressed, “there is S––; when he is\nhalf tipsy, he takes his Bible and ’Newton’s Works,’ and goes to bed and\ncries over them; he thinks in this way he is excessively pious.”",
        "S–– was among the officers who had never called upon us; it was fair\nto infer that if his religious principles did not correct his own evil\nhabits they would not aid much in improving others; therefore it seemed\nuseless to call in his co-operation in any scheme for a better\nobservance of the Lord’s day.",
        "We had to content ourselves with writing to our friends at the East to\ninterest themselves in getting a missionary sent to us, who should\nofficiate as chaplain in the garrison–a plan that seemed to find favor\nwith the officers. The hope of any united religious services was, for\nthe present, laid aside.",
        "The post-surgeon having obtained a furlough, his place was supplied by\nDr. Newhall, of Galena, and thus, by the addition of his gentle, quiet\nwife, our circle of ladies was now enlarged to three. Here we were, in a\nwilderness, but yet how contented and happy!",
        "A gloom was soon to replace this envied tranquillity in our home. A\nFrenchman, named Letendre, one day suddenly presented himself. He had\ncome from Chicago, with the distressing intelligence of the\nextreme–indeed, hopeless–illness of our dear relative, Dr. Wolcott. My\nhusband immediately commenced his preparations for instant departure. I\nbegged to be permitted to accompany him, but the rapidity with which he\nproposed to journey obliged him to refuse my entreaties. In a few hours\nhis provisions, horses, and all other things necessary for the journey\nwere in readiness, and he set off with Petaille Grignon, his usual\nattendant on such expeditions, leaving Letendre to follow as soon as\nrecruited from his fatigue.",
        "Sad and dreary were the hours of his absence, notwithstanding the kind\nefforts of our friends to cheer me. In a few days I received the news of\nthe fatal termination of Dr. W.’s illness, brought by another messenger.\nThat noble heart, so full of warm and kindly affections, had ceased to\nbeat, and sad and desolate indeed were those who had so loved and\nhonored him.",
        "As soon as he could possibly leave his family, my husband returned; and\nit was fortunate that he had delayed no longer, for the winter now began\nto set in, and with severity.",
        "Our quarters were spacious, but having been constructed of the green\ntrees of the forest, cut down and sawed into boards by the bands of the\nsoldiers, they were considerably given to shrinking and warping, thus\nleaving many a yawning crevice. Stuffing the cracks with cotton batting,\nand pasting strips of paper over them, formed the employment of many a\nleisure hour.",
        "Then the chimneys, spite of all the currents of air, which might have\nbeen expected to create a draught, had a sad habit of smoking. To remedy\nthis, a couple of gun-barrels were, by order of the commanding officer,\nsawed off and inserted in the hearth, one on each side of the\nfire-place, in the hope that the air from the room below might help to\ncarry the smoke into its proper place, the chimney.",
        "The next morning after this had been done, Louisa was washing the\nhearth.",
        "“Pray, ma’am,” said she, “what are these things put in here for?”",
        "I explained their use.",
        "“Oh, I am so glad it is only that! Uncle Ephraim (Major Twiggs’s\nservant) said they were to be filled with powder and fired off Christmas\nDay, and he was terribly afraid they would blow the house up, and we in\nit.”",
        "Ephraim, who was a most faithful and valuable servant, often amused\nhimself with playing upon the credulity of the younger portions of the\ncolored fraternity.",
        "“Is it true,” asked Louisa, one day, “that Pillon and Plante were once\nprairie-wolves?”",
        "“Prairie-wolves! what an idea! Why do you ask such a foolish question?”",
        "“Because Uncle Ephraim says they, and all the Frenchmen about here, were\nonce prairie-wolves, and that, living so near the white people, they\ngrow, after a time, to be like them, and learn to talk and dress like\nthem. And then, when they get to be old, they turn back into\nprairie-wolves again, and that all the wolves that the officers bait\nwith their dogs used to be Frenchmen, once.”",
        "After a time, however, I ceased to straighten out these stories of Uncle\nEphraim, for I was gradually arriving at the conviction that my little\ncolored damsel was by no means so simple and unsophisticated as she\nwould have me believe, and that I was, after all, the one who was\nimposed upon.",
        "The snow this winter was prodigious, and the cold intense. The water\nwould freeze in our parlors at a very short distance from the fire, for,\nalthough the “fatigue-parties” kept the halls filled with wood, almost\nup to the ceiling, that did not counterbalance the inconvenience of\nhaving the wide doors thrown open to the outer air for a great portion\nof the day, to allow of their bringing it in. We Northerners should have\nhad wood-houses specially for the purpose, and not only have kept our\ngreat hall-doors closed, but have likewise protected them with a\n\"hurricane-house.” But the Florida frontier was not a climate in which\nour Southern bachelors could have acquired the knowledge available when\nthe thermometer was twenty-five degrees below zero–a point at which\nbrandy congealed in the sideboard.",
        "The arrival of Christmas and New-Year’s brought us our Indian friends\nagain. They had learned something of the observance of these holidays\nfrom their French neighbors, and I had been forewarned that I should see\nthe squaws kissing every white man they met. Although not crediting this\nto its full extent, I could readily believe that they would each expect\na present, as a “compliment of the season,” so I duly prepared myself\nwith a supply of beads, ribbons, combs, and other trinkets. Knowing\nthem to be fond of dainties, I had also a quantity of crullers and\ndoughnuts made ready the day before, as a treat to them.",
        "To my great surprise and annoyance, only a moderate share of the cakes,\nthe frying of which had been intrusted to Louisa, were brought up to be\nplaced in the “Davis.”",
        "“Where are the rest of the cakes, Louisa?”",
        "“That great fellow, Hancock, came in with the fatigue-party to fill the\nwater-barrels, and while I had just stepped into the store-room to get\nsome more flour, he carried off all I had got cooked.”",
        "And Louisa made a face and whined, as if she had not herself treated\nevery soldier who had set his foot in the premises.",
        "At an early hour the next morning I had quite a levee of the\nHo-tshung-rah matrons. They seated themselves in a circle on the floor,\nand I was sorry to observe that the application of a little soap and\nwater to their blankets had formed no part of their holiday\npreparations. There being no one to interpret, I thought I would begin\nthe conversation in a way intelligible to themselves, so I brought out\nof the sideboard a china dish, filled with the nice brown crullers, over\nwhich I had grated, according to custom, a goodly quantity of white\nsugar. I handed it to the first of the circle. She took the dish from my\nhand, and, deliberately pouring all the cakes into the corner of her\nblanket, returned it to me empty. “She must be a meat voracious person,\"\nthought I; “but I will manage better the next time.” I refilled the\ndish, and approached the next one, taking care to keep a fast hold of it\nas I offered the contents, of which I supposed she would modestly take\none. Not so, however. She scooped out the whole with her two hands, and,\nlike the former, bestowed them in her blanket. My sense of politeness\nrevolted at handing them out one by one, as we do to children, so I sat\ndown to deliberate what was to be done, for evidently the supply would\nnot long answer such an ample demand, and there would be more visitors\nanon.",
        "While I was thus perplexed, those who had received the cakes commenced a\ndistribution, and the whole number was equitably divided among the\ncompany. But I observed they did not eat them. They passed their fingers\nover the grated sugar, looked in each other’s faces, and muttered in low\ntones–there was evidently something they did not understand. Presently\none more adventurous than the rest wet her fingers, and taking up a few\ngrains of the sugar put it cautiously to her mouth.",
        "“Tah-nee-zhoo-rah!” (Sugar!) was her delighted exclamation, and they all\nbroke out into a hearty laugh. It is needless to say that the cakes\ndisappeared with all the celerity they deemed compatible with\ngood-breeding. Never having seen any sugar but the brown or yellow\nmaple, they had supposed the white substance to be salt, and for that\nreason had hesitated to taste it.",
        "Their visit was prolonged until Shaw-nee-aw-kee made his appearance, and\nthen, having been made happy by their various gifts, they all took their\ndeparture.",
        "About this time, Mr. Kinzie received a letter from Colonel Richard M.\nJohnson, of Kentucky. This gentleman had interested himself greatly in a\nschool established in that State for the education of Indian youths and\nchildren. The purport of his letter was to request the Agent to use\nevery endeavor to induce the Winnebagoes not only to send their children\nto this institution for their education, but also (what was still more\nimportant) to set apart a portion of their annuity-money to assist in\nsustaining it.",
        "There happened to be, at this holiday season, a number of the chiefs in\nthe neighborhood of the Portage, and a messenger was sent to convene\nthem all at the house of Paquette, the interpreter, that their Father\nmight hold a talk with them.",
        "On the day appointed they all assembled. The subject-matter of the\nletter was laid before them, and all the advantages of civilization and\neducation duly set forth–the benefits which would arise to their\nnation, if even a small portion of the younger members could be well\ntaught by the whites, and then return to their tribe, to instruct them\nin the learning, the arts, manufactures, and habits of civilized life.\nTo each paragraph, as it was uttered to them, they responded with a\nunanimous “Humph!” (Good!)",
        "When their Father’s address was ended, Day-kau-ray, the oldest and\nmost venerable among the chiefs, rose and spoke as follows:",
        "“Father,–The Great Spirit made the white man and the Indian. He did not\nmake them alike. He gave the white man a heart to love peace, and the\narts of a quiet life. He taught him to live in towns, to build houses,\nto make books, to learn all things that would make him happy and\nprosperous in the way of life appointed him. To the red man the Great\nSpirit gave a different character. He gave him a love of the woods, of a\nfree life, of hunting and fishing, of making war with his enemies and\ntaking scalps. The white man does not live like the Indian–it is not\nhis nature. Neither does the Indian love to live like the white man–the\nGreat Spirit did not make him so.",
        "“Father,–We do not wish to do anything contrary to the will of the\nGreat Spirit. If he had made us with white skins, and characters like\nthe white men, then we would send our children to this school to be\ntaught like the white children.",
        "“Father,–We think that if the Great Spirit had wished us to be like\nthe whites, he would have made us so. As he has not seen fit to do so,\nwe believe he would be displeased with us, to try and make ourselves\ndifferent from what he thought good.",
        "“Father,–I have nothing more to say. This is what we think. If we\nchange our minds, we will let you know.”",
        "It will be seen from these remarks of Day-kau-ray that the Indians\nentertain a conviction that the Great Spirit himself teaches the white\nman the arts and sciences, and since he has given the red man no\ninstruction in these branches, it would be unbecoming in him to attempt\nto acquire them in an irregular manner.",
        "With little incidents of this kind, and with an occasional dinner- or\ntea-party to the young officers, sometimes given at the Major’s\nquarters, sometimes at our own, our course of life passed pleasantly on.\nAt times I would amuse myself by making something very nice, in the\nform of a fruit cake or pie, to send to the quarters of the young\nofficers as a present, it being supposed that possibly, without a lady\nto preside over their mess, it might be sometimes deficient in these\ndelicacies. Mrs. Twiggs was so fortunate as to have well-trained\nservants to do for her that which, thanks to my little dark handmaid,\nalways fell to my share.",
        "One day I had made some mince pies, which the Major and my husband\ngreatly approved, and I thought I would send one to each of the young\nofficers.",
        "It happened that my husband, that day, in returning from superintending\nhis men on the other side of the river, had occasion to call on some\nerrand at Captain Harney’s quarters.",
        "Dinner had just been placed upon the table, and the Captain insisted on\nhis visitor’s sitting down and partaking with him and another gentleman\nwho was present. The pork and beans were pronounced excellent, and being\nremoved there followed a mince pie.",
        "The Captain cut it, and helped his guests, then taking a piece himself,\nhe commenced tasting it. Pushing back his plate with an exclamation and\na sudden jerk, he called to his servant, a little thick-set mulatto who\nwaited–\"David, you yellow rascal, how dare you put such a pie on my\ntable?” And, turning to the company apologetically, he said,–",
        "“If there is anything on earth David does understand, it is how to\nmake a mince pie, and here he has filled this with brandy, so we cannot\neat a morsel of it!”",
        "“Please, sir,” said David, modestly, “I did not make the pie–it is one\nMrs. Kinzie sent as a present.”",
        "The poor Captain was now in a predicament. He raved at himself, at the\nsame time conjuring my husband most earnestly not to tell me what a\nmistake he had made–an injunction that was lost sight of as soon as the\nlatter returned to his home. As for the unlucky Captain, he did not\nventure to call on me again until he felt sure I had forgotten the\ncircumstance.",
        "Early in January the snow fell in great abundance. We had an unusual\nquantity at the Portage, but in “the diggings,” as the lead-mining\ncountry was called, it was of an unheard-of depth–five or six feet upon\na level.",
        "An express had been dispatched to Chicago by the officers to take our\nletters, and bring back the mail from that place. A tough, hardy\nsoldier, named Sulky, acted as messenger, and he had hitherto made light\nof his burden or the length of the way, notwithstanding that his task\nwas performed on foot with his pack upon his shoulders. But now Sulky\nhad been absent some weeks, and we had given him up entirely, persuaded\nthat he must have perished with cold and starvation.",
        "At length he appeared, nearly blind from travelling in the snow. He had\nlain by three weeks in an Indian lodge, the snow being too deep to\npermit him to journey. The account he gave put an end to the hopes I had\nbegun to entertain of being able to visit our friends at Chicago in the\ncourse of this winter.",
        "We had, before the last heavy fall of snow, been forming plans to that\neffect. Captain Harney had kindly commenced preparing some trains, or\nboxes placed on sledges, which it was thought would, when lined with\nbuffalo-skins, furnish a very comfortable kind of vehicle for the\njourney; and I was still inclined to think a good, deep bed of snow over\nthe whole country no great obstacle to a sleigh-ride. The whole matter\nwas, however, cut short by the commanding officer, who from the first\nhad violently opposed the scheme, declaring that he would order the\nsentinels to fire on us if we attempted to leave the fort. So, finding\nthe majority against us, we were obliged to yield.",
        "The arrival of sweet, lovely little Lizzie Twiggs, before January was\nquite past, was an event that shed light and joy in at least two\ndwellings. It seemed as if she belonged to all of us, and as she\nincreased in size and beauty it was hard to say who, among us all, was\nmost proud of her. If we had ever felt any languid hours before, we\ncould have none now–she was the pet, the darling, the joint property of\nboth households.",
        "Whatever regret I might have had, previous to this event, at the idea\nof leaving my friend for the three weeks to which we proposed to limit\nour visit to Chicago, I felt now that she would scarcely miss me, and\nthat we might hold ourselves in readiness to take advantage of the first\nimprovement in the weather, to put this favorite project in execution.",
        "During the latter part of February the cold became less severe. The\nsnows melted away, and by the beginning of March the weather was so warm\nand genial, that we were quite confident of being able to make the\njourney on horseback without any serious difficulty.",
        "Our plans once settled upon, the first thing to be provided was warm and\ncomfortable apparel. A riding-habit of stout broadcloth was pronounced\nindispensable to my equipment. But of such an article I was destitute.\nNothing among my wedding travelling gear seemed in any way to offer a\nsubstitute. What was to be done? The requisite material was to be found\nin abundance at the sutler’s store (the shantee, as it was technically\ntermed), but how to get it manufactured into a suitable garment was the\nquestion.",
        "The regimental tailor was summoned. He was cook to one of the companies,\nand there were at first some doubts whether he could be permitted to\nforsake the spit for the needle, during the time I should require his\nservices. All his tailoring-work had, heretofore, been done at odd times\non a bench in the company kitchen, and thither he now proposed to carry\nthe riding-habit. I suggested that, in order to superintend the work, I\nshould thus be driven to take up my abode for the time being in the\nbarracks, which would be a decided inconvenience.",
        "To remedy the difficulty, he was finally so happy as to find a soldier\nin “Company D,” who consented to officiate in his place as cook until\nhis term of service to me should expire.",
        "Behold, then, a little, solemn-looking man in his stocking-feet, seated\ncross-legged on an Indian mat by my parlor window. He had made all his\narrangements himself, and I deemed it wisest not to interfere with him.\nThe cutting-out was the most difficult part, and, as he had never made a\nlady’s riding-habit, that task fell to my share. I was as great a novice\nas himself, and I must admit that this, my first effort, was open to\ncriticism. But the little tailor was of a different opinion. He was in\nan ecstasy with our joint performance.",
        "“Upon my word, madam,” he would exclaim, surveying it with admiring\neyes, “we shall have a very respectable garment!” I do not know how many\ntimes he repeated this during the three days that the work was in\nprogress.",
        "I believe he had not perfect confidence in the culinary powers of his\ncomrade of “Company D,” for regularly a half-hour before beat of drum\nhis work was folded and laid aside, his snips gathered up, and, all\nthings being restored to order, he would slip out, resume his shoes,\nwhich, Turk-like, he had left outside the door, and speed over to the\nbarrack-kitchen to see how matters were going on.",
        "In the mean time, great preparations were making below, under the\nsupervision of our tidy, active little French servant, Mrs. Pillon, the\nwife of one of the engagés, by whom the irregular and unmanageable\nLouisa had been replaced.",
        "Biscuits were baked, a ham, some tongues, and sundry pieces of salt pork\nwere boiled, coffee roasted and ground, sugar cracked, isinglass cut in\npieces of the size requisite for a pot of coffee. For the reception of\nall these different articles cotton bags of different sizes had been\npreviously prepared. Large sacks of skin, called by the Canadians\nporches, were also provided to hold the more bulky provisions, for our\njourney was to be a long one.",
        "The distance from Fort Winnebago to Chicago was not very formidable, it\nis true, if the direct route were taken; but that we knew to be\nimpossible at this season of the year. The route by Kosh-ko-nong was out\nof the question; all the Indians being absent from their villages in the\nwinter, and the ice being now gone, we could have no means of crossing\nthe Rock River at that place.",
        "There remained therefore no alternative but to proceed south to Dixon,\nor, as it was then called, Ogie’s Ferry, the only certain means of\ncrossing this broad and rapid stream. This route being so much out of\nour direct course that we could not hope to accomplish it in less than\nsix days, it was necessary to prepare accordingly.",
        "While the wardrobe and provisions were thus in preparation, arrangements\nwere also being made as to our retinue and mode of conveyance.",
        "Mr. Kinzie decided to take with him but two men: Plante and Pierre\nRoy,–the former to act as guide, on the assurance that he knew every\nmile of the way, from the Portage to Ogie’s Ferry, and from Ogie’s Ferry\nto Chicago.",
        "The claims of the different saddle-horses were discussed, and the most\neligible one was selected for my use. We hesitated for a time between\n\"Le Gris” and “Souris,” two much-vaunted animals, belonging to Paquette,\nthe interpreter. At length, being determined, like most of my sex, by a\nregard for exterior, I chose “Le Gris,” and “Souris” was assigned to\nyoung Roy; my own little stumpy pony, “Brunet,” being pronounced just\nthe thing for a pack-saddle. My husband rode his own bay horse “Tom,\"\nwhile Plante, the gayest and proudest of the party, bestrode a fine,\nlarge animal called “Jerry,” which had lately been purchased for my use;\nand thus was our cortége complete.",
        "Having taken a tender leave of our friends, the morning of the 8th of\nMarch saw us mounted and equipped for our journey. The weather was\nfine–the streams, already fringed with green, were sparkling in the\nsun–everything gave promise of an early and genial season. In vain,\nwhen we reached the ferry at the foot of the hill on which the fort\nstood, did Major Twiggs repeat his endeavors to dissuade us from\ncommencing a journey which he assured me would be perilous beyond what I\ncould anticipate. I was resolute.",
        "Our party was augmented by an escort of all the young officers, who\npolitely insisted on accompanying us as far as Duck Creek, four miles\ndistant. Indeed, there were some who would gladly have prosecuted the\nwhole journey with us, and escaped the monotony of their solitary,\nuneventful life. In our rear followed an ox cart, on which was perched a\ncanoe, destined to transport us over the creek, and also an extensive\nmarsh beyond it, which was invariably, at this season, overflowed with\nwater to a considerable depth. We had much amusement in watching the\nprogress of this vehicle as it bumped and thumped over the road,\nunconscious hitherto of the dignity of a wheeled carriage.",
        "Our little, shock-headed, sunburnt, thick-lipped Canadian (who happened\nmost miraculously to be the husband of my pretty servant, Mrs. Pillon)\nshouted vociferously as the animals lagged in their pace, or jolted\nagainst a stump, ’Marchez, don-g,” ’regardez,” ’prenez garde,” to\nour infinite diversion. I was in high spirits, foreseeing no hardships\nor dangers, but rather imagining myself embarked on a pleasure excursion\nacross the prairies. It had not even suggested itself to me that a straw\nbonnet and kid gloves were no suitable equipment for such an expedition.\nNever having travelled at so inclement a season, I was heedlessly\nignorant of the mode of preparing against it, and had resisted or\nlaughed at my husband’s suggestions to provide myself with blanket\nsocks, and a woollen capuchon for my head and shoulders. And now,\nalthough the wind occasionally lifted my head-gear with a rude puff, and\nmy hands ere long became swollen and stiffened with the cold, I\npersuaded myself that these were trifling evils, to which I should soon\nget accustomed. I was too well pleased with the novelty of my outfit,\nwith my hunting-knife in a gay scabbard hanging from my neck, and my tin\ncup at my saddle-bow, to regard minor inconveniences.",
        "On reaching Duck Creek, we took leave of our young friends, who remained\non the bank long enough to witness our passage across–ourselves in the\ncanoe, and the poor horses swimming the stream, now filled with cakes of\nfloating ice.",
        "Beyond the rising ground which formed the opposite bank of the stream,\nextended a marsh of perhaps three hundred yards across. To this the men\ncarried the canoe which was to bear us over. The water was not deep, so\nour attendants merely took off the pack from Brunet and my side-saddle\nfrom Le Gris, for fear of accidents, and then mounted their own steeds,\nleading the two extra ones. My husband placed the furniture of the\npack-horse and my saddle in the centre of the canoe, which he was to\npaddle across.",
        "“Now, wifie,” said he, “jump in, and seat yourself flat in the bottom of\nthe canoe.”",
        "“Oh, no,” said I; “I will sit on the little trunk in the centre; I shall\nbe so much more comfortable, and I can balance the canoe exactly.”",
        "“As you please; but I think you will find it is not the best way.”",
        "A vigorous push sent us a few feet from the bank. At that instant two\nfavorite greyhounds whom we had brought with us, and who had stood\nwhining upon the bank, reluctant to take to the water as they were\nordered, gave a sudden bound, and alighted full upon me. The canoe\nbalanced a moment–then yielded–and, quick as thought, dogs, furniture,\nand lady were in the deepest of the water.",
        "My husband, who was just preparing to spring into the canoe when the\ndogs thus unceremoniously took precedence of him, was at my side in a\nmoment, and, seizing me by the collar of my cloak, begged me not to be\nfrightened. I was not, in the least, and only laughed as he raised and\nplaced me again upon the bank.",
        "The unfortunate saddle and little trunk were then rescued, but not until\nthey had received a pretty thorough wetting. Our merriment was still\nfurther increased by the sight of the maladroit Pillon, who was\nattempting to ride my spirited Jerry across the marsh. He was clinging\nto the neck of the animal, with a countenance distorted with terror, as\nhe shouted forth all manner of French objurgations. Jerry pranced and\ncurveted, and finally shot forward his rider, or rather his burden,\nheadforemost, a distance of several feet into the water.",
        "A general outcry of mirth saluted the unfortunate Frenchman, which was\nredoubled as he raised himself puffing and snorting from his watery bed\nand waddled back to his starting-place, the horse, meanwhile, very\nsensibly making his way to join his companions, who had already reached\nthe farther bank.",
        "“Well, wifie,” said Mr. Kinzie, “I cannot trust you in the canoe again.\nThere is no way but to carry you across the marsh like a pappoose. Will\nyou take a ride on my shoulders?”",
        "“With all my heart, if you will promise to take me safely.” And I was\nsoon mounted.",
        "I most confess that the gentleman staggered now and then under his\nburden, which was no slight one, and I was sadly afraid, more than once,\nthat I should meet a similar fate to old Pillon, but happily we reached\nthe other side in safety.",
        "There my husband insisted on my putting on dry shoes and stockings, and\n(must I confess it?) drinking a little brandy, to obviate the effects of\nmy icy bath. He would fain have made a halt to kindle a fire and dry my\napparel and wardrobe properly, but this I would not listen to. I\nendeavored to prove to him that the delay would expose me to more cold\nthan riding in my wet habit and cloak, and so indeed it might have been,\nbut along with my convictions upon the subject there was mingled a spice\nof reluctance that our friends at the fort should have an opportunity,\nas they certainly would have done, of laughing at our inauspicious\ncommencement.",
        "Soon our horses were put in order, and our march recommenced. The day\nwas fine for the season. I felt no inconvenience from my wet garments,\nthe exercise of riding taking away all feeling of chilliness. It was to\nme a new mode of travelling, and I enjoyed it the more from having been\nsecluded for more than five months within the walls of the fort,\nscarcely varying the tenor of our lives by an occasional walk of half a\nmile into the surrounding woods.",
        "We had still another detention upon the road, from meeting Lapierre, the\nblacksmith, from Sugar Creek, who with one of his associates was going\nto the Portage for supplies, so that we had not travelled more than\ntwenty-three miles when we came to our proposed encamping-ground. It was\nupon a beautiful stream, a tributary of one of the Four Lakes,[14] that\nchain whose banks are unrivalled for romantic loveliness.",
        "I could not but admire the sagacity of the horses, who seemed, with\nhuman intelligence, to divine our approach to the spot where their toils\nwere to cease. While still remote from the point of woods which foretold\na halt, they pricked up their ears, accelerated their pace, and finally\narrived at the spot on a full gallop.",
        "We alighted at an open space, just within the verge of the wood, or, as\nit is called by Western travellers, “the timber.” My husband recommended\nto me to walk about until a fire should be made, which was soon\naccomplished by our active and experienced woodsmen, to whom the felling\nof a large tree was the work of a very few minutes. The dry grass around\nfurnished an excellent tinder, which, ignited by the sparks from the\nflint (there were no loco-focos in those days), and aided by the\nbroken branches and bits of light-wood, soon produced a cheering flame.\n\"The bourgeois,” in the mean time, busied himself in setting up the\ntent, taking care to place it opposite the fire, but in such a direction\nthat the wind would carry the smoke and flame away from the opening or\ndoor. Within upon the ground were spread, first a bear-skin, then two\nor three blankets (of which each equestrian had carried two, one under\nthe saddle and one above it), after which, the remainder of the luggage\nbeing brought in, I was able to divest myself of all my wet clothing and\nreplace it with dry. Some idea of the state of the thermometer may be\nformed from the fact that my riding-habit, being placed over the end of\nthe huge log against which our fire was made, was, in a very few\nminutes, frozen so stiff as to stand upright, giving the appearance of a\ndress out of which a lady had vanished in some unaccountable manner.",
        "It would be but a repetition of our experience upon the Fox River to\ndescribe the ham broiled upon the “broches,” the toasted bread, the\nsteaming coffee, the primitive table-furniture. There is, however, this\ndifference, that of the latter we carry with us in our journeys on\nhorseback only a coffee-pot, a tea-kettle, and each rider his tin cup\nand hunting-knife. The deportment at table is marked by an absence of\nceremony. The knife is drawn from the scabbard–those who remember to do\nso, vouchsafe it a wipe upon the napkin. Its first office is to stir the\ncup of coffee–next, to divide the piece of ham which is placed on the\nhalf of a travelling biscuit, held in the left hand, to fulfil the\noffice of a plate. It is an art only to be acquired by long practice, to\ncut the meat so skilfully as not at the same time to destroy the dish.",
        "We take our places around the mat to enjoy what, after our fatiguing\nride, we find delicious food. The Frenchmen are seated at a little\ndistance, receiving their supplies of coffee, meat, and bread, and\noccasionally passing jokes with the bourgeois, who is their demi-god,\nand for whom their respect and devotion are never lessened by his\naffability or condescension.",
        "The meal being finished, the table-furniture is rinsed in hot water and\nset aside until morning. A wisp of dry prairie-grass is supposed in most\ncases to render the knife fit to be restored to the scabbard, and there\nbeing, at this season of the year, no amusement but that of watching the\nawkward movements of the spancelled horses in their progress from spot\nto spot in search of pasturage, we are usually soon disposed to arrange\nour blankets and retire to rest.",
        "At break of day we are aroused by the shout of the bourgeois,–",
        "“How! how! how!”",
        "All start from their slumbers. The fire, which has been occasionally\nreplenished through the night, is soon kindled into a flame. The horses\nare caught and saddled, while a breakfast, similar in kind to the meal\nof the preceding evening, is preparing–the tent is struck–the\npack-horse loaded–”tout démanché,” as the Canadian says. The\nbreakfast finished, we rinse our kettles and cups, tie them to our\nsaddle-bows, and then mount and away, leaving our fire, or rather our\nsmoke, to tell of our visit.",
        "March 9th.–Our journey this day led us past the first of the Four\nLakes. Scattered along its banks was an encampment of Winnebagoes. They\ngreeted their Father with vociferous joy–”Bon-jour, bon-jour,\nShaw-nee-aw-kee,” ’Hee-nee-kar-ray-kay-noo?” (how do you do?)",
        "To this succeeded the usual announcement, ’Wys-kap-rah\ntshoonsh-koo-nee-noh!” (I have no bread.)",
        "This is their form of begging; but we could not afford to be generous,\nfor the uncertainty of obtaining a supply, should our own be exhausted,\nobliged us to observe the strictest economy.",
        "How beautiful the entrapment looked in the morning sun! The matted\nlodges, with the blue smoke curling from their tops–the trees and\nbushes powdered with a light snow which had fallen through the\nnight–the lake, shining and sparkling, almost at our feet–even the\nIndians, in their peculiar costume, adding to the picturesque!",
        "I was sorry to leave it, as we were compelled to do, in all haste,\nSouris, the pack-horse, having taken it into his head to decamp while we\nwere in conversation with our red friends. As he had, very sensibly,\nconcluded to pursue his journey in the right direction, we had the good\nfortune to overtake him after a short race, and, having received much\nscolding and some blows from young Roy, whose charge he specially was,\nhe was placed in the middle of the cavalcade, as a mark of disgrace for\nhis breach of duty.",
        "Our road, after leaving the lake, lay over a “rolling prairie,” now bare\nand desolate enough. The hollows were filled with snow, which, being\npartly thawed, furnished an uncertain footing for the horses, and I\ncould not but join in the ringing laughter of oar Frenchmen as\noccasionally Brunet and Souris, the two ponies, would flounder, almost\nimbedded, through the yielding mass. Even the vainglorious Plante, who\npiqued himself on his equestrian skill, was once or twice nearly\nunhorsed, from having chosen his road badly. Sometimes the elevations\nwere covered with a thicket or copse, in which our dogs would generally\nrouse up one or more deer. Their first bound, or “lope,” was the signal\nfor a chase. The horses seemed to enter into the spirit of it, as\n\"halloo” answered “halloo;” but we were never so fortunate as to get a\nshot at one, for although the dogs once or twice caught they were not\nstrong enough to hold them. It was about the middle of the afternoon\nwhen we reached the Blue Mound. I rejoiced much to have got so far, for\nI was sadly fatigued, and every mile now seemed like two to me. In fact,\nthe miles are unconscionably long in this country. When I was told that\nwe had still seven miles to go, to “Morrison’s,” where we proposed\nstopping for the night, I was almost in despair. It was my first journey\non horseback, and I had not yet become inured to the exercise.",
        "When we reached Morrison’s I was so much exhausted that, as my husband\nattempted to lift me from the saddle, I fell into his arms.",
        "“This will never do,” said he. “To-morrow we must turn our faces towards\nFort Winnebago again.”",
        "The door opened hospitably to receive us. We were welcomed by a lady\nwith a most sweet, benignant countenance, and by her companion, some\nyears younger. The first was Mrs. Morrison–the other, Miss Elizabeth\nDodge, daughter of General Dodge.",
        "My husband laid me upon a small bed, in the room where the ladies had\nbeen sitting at work. They took off my bonnet and riding-dress, chafed\nmy hands, and prepared me some warm wine and water, by which I was soon\nrevived. A half-hour’s repose so refreshed me that I was able to\nconverse with the ladies, and to relieve my husband’s mind of all\nanxiety on my account. Tea was announced soon after, and we repaired to\nan adjoining building, for Morrison’s, like the establishment of all\nsettlers of that period, consisted of a group of detached log houses or\ncabins, each containing one or at most two apartments.",
        "The table groaned with good cheer, and brought to mind some that I had\nseen among the old-fashioned Dutch residents on the banks of the Hudson.",
        "I had recovered my spirits, and we were quite a cheerful party. Mrs.\nMorrison told us that during the first eighteen months she passed in\nthis country she did not speak with a white woman, the only society she\nhad being that of her husband and two black servant-women.",
        "A Tennessee woman had called in with her little son just before tea,\nand we amused Mr. Kinzie with a description of the pair. The mother’s\nvisit was simply one of courtesy. She was a little, dumpy woman, with a\ncomplexion burned perfectly red by the sun, and hair of an exact\ntow-color, braided up from her forehead in front and from her neck\nbehind. These tails, meeting on the top of her head, were fastened with\na small tin comb. Her dress was of checkered homespun, a “very tight\nfit,” and, as she wore no ruff or handkerchief around her neck, she\nlooked as if just prepared for execution. She was evidently awestruck at\nthe sight of visitors, and seemed inclined to take her departure at\nonce; but the boy, not so easily intimidated, would not understand her\nsigns and pinches until he had sidled up to Mrs. Morrison, and, drawing\nhis old hat still farther over his eyes, begged for a whang, meaning a\nnarrow strip of deer-skin. The lady very obligingly cut one from a large\nsmoked skin, which she produced from its receptacle, and mother and son\ntook their leave, with a smiling but rather a scared look.",
        "After tea we returned to Mrs. Morrison’s parlor, where she kindly\ninsisted on my again reposing myself on the little bed, to recruit me,\nas she said, for the ensuing day’s journey. My husband, in the mean\ntime, went to look after the accommodation of his men and horses.",
        "During the conversation that ensued, I learned that Mrs. Morrison had\npassed much time in the neighborhood of my recent home in Oneida County,\nthat many of the friends I had loved and valued were likewise her\nfriends, and that she had even proposed to visit me at Fort Winnebago on\nhearing of my arrival there, in order to commence an acquaintance which\nhad thus been brought about by other and unexpected means.",
        "Long and pleasant was the discourse we held together until a late hour,\nand mutual was the satisfaction with which we passed old friends and\nby-gone events in review, much to the edification of Miss Dodge, and of\nthe gentlemen when they once more joined us.",
        "The next morning, after a cheerful breakfast, at which we were joined by\nthe Rev. Mr. Kent, of Galena, we prepared for our journey. I had\nreconciled my husband to continuing our route towards Chicago, by\nassuring him that I felt as fresh and bright as when I first set out\nfrom home.",
        "There seemed some apprehension, however, that we might have difficulty\nin “striking the trail” to Hamilton’s diggings, our next point of\ndestination.",
        "The directions we received were certainly obscure. We were to pursue a\ngiven trail for a certain number of miles, when we should come to a\ncrossing into which we were to turn, taking an easterly direction; after\na time, this would bring us to a deep trail leading straight to\nHamilton’s. In this open country there are no landmarks. One elevation\nis so exactly like another, that if you lose your trail there is almost\nas little hope of regaining it as of finding a pathway in the midst of\nthe ocean.[15]",
        "The trail, it must be remembered, is not a broad highway, but a narrow\npath, deeply indented by the hoofs of the horses on which the Indians\ntravel in single file. So deeply is it sunk in the sod which covers the\nprairies, that it is difficult, sometimes, to distinguish it at a\ndistance of a few rods.",
        "It was new ground to Mr. Kinzie, whose journeys from the Portage to\nChicago had hitherto been made in the direct route by Kosh-ko-nong. He\ntherefore obliged Mr. Morrison to repeat the directions again and again,\nthough Plante, our guide, swaggered and talked big, averring that “he\nknew every hill and stream and point of woods from that spot to\nChicago.”",
        "We had not proceeded many miles on our journey, however, before we\ndiscovered that Monsieur Plante was profoundly ignorant of the country,\nso that Mr. Kinzie was obliged to take the lead himself, and make his\nway as he was best able, according to the directions he had received.\nNothing, however, like the “cross trails” we had been promised met our\nview, and the path on which we had set out diverged so much from what we\nknew to be the right direction, that we were at length compelled to\nabandon it altogether.",
        "We travelled the livelong day, barely making a halt at noon to bait our\nhorses and refresh ourselves with a luncheon. The ride was as gloomy and\ndesolate as could well be imagined. A rolling prairie, unvaried by\nforest or stream–hillock rising after hillock, at every ascent of which\nwe vainly hoped to see a distant fringe of ’timber.” But the same\ncheerless, unbounded prospect everywhere met the eye, diversified only\nhere and there by the oblong openings, like gigantic graves, which\nmarked an unsuccessful search for indications of a lead-mine.",
        "So great was our anxiety to recover our trail, for the weather was\ngrowing more cold, and the wind more sharp and piercing, that we were\nnot tempted to turn from our course even by the appearance, more than\nonce, of a gaunt prairie-wolf, peering over the nearest rising-ground\nand seeming to dare us to an encounter. The Frenchmen, it is true, would\ninstinctively give a shout and spur on their horses, while the hounds,\nKelda and Cora, would rush to the chase; but the bourgeois soon called\nthem back, with a warning that we must attend strictly to the\nprosecution of our journey. Just before sunset we crossed, with some\ndifficulty, a muddy stream, which was bordered by a scanty belt of\ntrees, making a tolerable encamping-ground; and of this we gladly\navailed ourselves, although we knew not whether it was near or remote\nfrom the place we were in search of.",
        "We had ridden at least fifty miles since leaving Morrison’s, yet I was\nsensible of very little fatigue; there was, however, a vague feeling of\ndiscomfort at the idea of being lost in this wild, cold region,\naltogether different from anything I had ever before experienced. The\nencouraging tones of my husband’s voice, however, “Cheer up, wifie–we\nwill find the trail to-morrow,” served to dissipate all uneasiness.",
        "The exertions of the men soon made our “camp” comfortable,\nnotwithstanding the difficulty of driving the tent-pins into the frozen\nground, and the want of trees sufficiently large to make a rousingfire. The place was a stony side-hill, as it would be called in New\nEngland, where such things abound; but we were not disposed to be\nfastidious, so we ate our salt ham and toasted our bread, and lent a\npleased ear to the chatter of our Frenchmen, who could not sufficiently\nadmire the heroism of “Madame John” amid the vicissitudes that befell\nher.",
        "The wind, which at bed-time was sufficiently high to be uncomfortable,\nincreased during the night. It snowed heavily, and we were every moment\nin dread that the tent would be carried away; but the matter was settled\ndifferently by the snapping of the poles, and the falling of the whole,\nwith its superincumbent weight of snow, in a mass upon us.",
        "Mr. Kinzie roused up his men, and at their head he sallied into the\nneighboring wood to cut a new set of poles, leaving me to bear the\nburden of the whole upon my shoulders, my only safety from the storm\nbeing to keep snugly housed beneath the canvas.",
        "With some difficulty a sort of support was at length adjusted for the\ntent-covering, which answered our purpose tolerably well until the break\nof day, when our damp and miserable condition made us very glad to rise\nand hang round the fire until breakfast was dispatched, and the horses\nonce more saddled for our journey.",
        "The prospect was not an encouraging one. Around us was an unbroken sheet\nof snow. We had no compass, and the air was so obscured by the driving\nsleet, that it was often impossible to tell in which direction the sun\nwas. I tied my husband’s silk pocket-handkerchief over my veil, to\nprotect my face from the wind and icy particles with which the air was\nfilled, and which cut like a razor; but, although shielded in every way\nthat circumstances rendered possible, I suffered intensely from the\ncold.",
        "We pursued our way, mile after mile, entering every point of woods, in\nhopes of meeting with, at least, some Indian wigwam at which we could\ngain intelligence. Every spot was solitary and deserted; not even the\ntrace of a recent fire, to cheer us with the hope of human beings within\nmiles of us.",
        "Suddenly, a shout from the foremost of the party made each heart bound\nwith joy.",
        "“Une clôture! une clôture!” (A fence! a fence!)",
        "It was almost like life to the dead.",
        "We spurred on, and indeed perceived a few straggling rails crowning a\nrising ground at no great distance.",
        "Never did music sound so sweet as the crowing of a cock which at this\nmoment saluted our ears.",
        "Following the course of the inclosure down the opposite slope, we came\nupon a group of log cabins, low, shabby, and unpromising in their\nappearance, but a most welcome shelter from the pelting storm.",
        "“Whose cabins are these?” asked Mr. Kinzie, of a man who was cutting\nwood at the door of one.",
        "“Hamilton’s,” was his reply; and he stepped forward at once to assist us\nto alight, hospitality being a matter of course in these wild regions.",
        "We were shown into the most comfortable-looking of the buildings. A\nlarge fire was burning in the clay chimney, and the room was of a genial\nwarmth, notwithstanding the apertures, many inches in width, beside the\ndoors and windows. A woman in a tidy calico dress, and shabby black silk\ncap trimmed with still shabbier lace, rose from her seat beside a sort\nof bread-trough, which fulfilled the office of cradle to a fine, fat\nbaby. She made room for us at the fire, but was either too timid or too\nignorant to relieve me of wrappings and defences, now heavy with the\nsnow.",
        "I soon contrived, with my husband’s aid, to disembarrass myself of them;\nand, having seen me comfortably disposed of, and in a fair way to be\nthawed after my freezing ride, he left me, to see after his men and\nhorses.",
        "He was a long time absent, and I expected he would return accompanied by\nour host; but when he reappeared it was to tell me, laughing, that Mr.\nHamilton hesitated to present himself before me, being unwilling that\none who had been acquainted with his family at the East should see him\nin his present mode of life. However, this feeling apparently wore off,\nfor before dinner he came in and was introduced to me, and was as\nagreeable and polite as the son of Alexander Hamilton would naturally\nbe.",
        "The housekeeper, who was the wife of one of the miners, prepared us a\nplain, comfortable dinner, and a table as long as the dimensions of the\ncabin would admit was set out, the end nearest the fire being covered\nwith somewhat nicer furniture and more delicate fare than the remaining\nportion.",
        "The blowing of a horn was the signal for the entrance of ten or twelve\nminers, who took their places below us at the table. They were the\nroughest-looking set of men I ever beheld, and their language was as\nuncouth as their persons. They wore hunting-shirts, trowsers, and\nmoccasins of deer-skin, the former being ornamented at the seams with a\nfringe of the same, while a colored belt around the waist, in which was\nstuck a large hunting-knife, gave each the appearance of a brigand.",
        "Mr. Hamilton, although so much their superior, was addressed by them\nuniformly as “Uncle Billy;” and I could not but fancy there was\nsomething desperate about them, that it was necessary to propitiate by\nthis familiarity. This feeling was further confirmed by the remarks of\none of the company who lingered behind after the rest of the gang had\ntaken their departure. He had learned that we came from Fort Winnebago,\nand, having informed us that “he was a discharged soldier, and would\nlike to make some inquiries about his old station and comrades,” he\nunceremoniously seated himself and commenced questioning us.",
        "The bitterness with which he spoke of his former officers made me quite\nsure he was a deserter, and I rather suspected he had made his escape\nfrom the service in consequence of some punishment. His countenance was\nfairly distorted as he spoke of Captain H., to whose company he had\nbelonged. “There is a man in the mines,” said he, “who has been in his\nhands, and if he ever gets a chance to come within shot of him, I guess\nthe captain will remember it. He knows well enough he darsn’t set his\nfoot in the diggings. And there’s T. is not much better. Everybody\nthought it a great pity that fellow’s gun snapped when he so nearly\nhad him at Green Bay.”",
        "Having delivered himself of these sentiments, he marched out, to my\ngreat relief.",
        "Mr. Hamilton passed most of the afternoon with us; for the storm raged\nso without, that to proceed on our journey was out of the question. He\ngave us many pleasant anecdotes and reminiscences of his early life in\nNew York, and of his adventures since he had come to the Western\nwilderness. When obliged to leave us for awhile, he furnished us with\nsome books to entertain us, the most interesting of which was the\nbiography of his father.",
        "Could this illustrious man have foreseen in what a scene–the dwelling\nof his son–this book was to be one day perused, what would have been\nhis sensations?",
        "The most amusing part of our experience was yet to come. I had been\nspeculating, as evening approached, on our prospects for the night’s\naccommodation. As our pale, melancholy-looking landlady and her fat baby\nwere evidently the only specimens of the feminine gender about the\nestablishment, it was hardly reasonable to suppose that any of the other\ncabins contained wherewithal to furnish us a comfortable lodging, and\nthe one in which we were offered nothing of the sort to view, but two\nbeds, uncurtained, extended against the farther wall. My doubts were\nafter a time resolved, by observing the hostess stretch a cord between\nthe two, on which she hung some petticoats and extra garments, by way\nof a partition, after which she invited us to occupy one of them.",
        "My only preparation was, to wrap my cloak around me and lie down with my\nface to the wall; but the good people were less ceremonious, for at the\ndistance of scarcely two feet, we could not be mistaken in the sound of\ntheir garments being, not “laid aside,” but whipped over the\npartition-wall between us.",
        "Our waking thoughts, however, were only those of thankfulness for so\ncomfortable a lodging after the trials and fatigues we had undergone;\nand even these were of short duration, for our eyes were soon closed in\nslumber.",
        "The next day’s sun rose clear and bright. Refreshed and invigorated, we\nlooked forward with pleasure to a recommencement of our journey,\nconfident of meeting no more mishaps by the way. Mr. Hamilton kindly\noffered to accompany us to his next neighbor’s, the trifling distance of\ntwenty-five miles. From Kellogg’s to Ogie’s Ferry, on the Rock River,\nthe road being much travelled, we should be in no danger, Mr. H. said,\nof again losing our way.",
        "The miner who owned the wife and baby, and who, consequently, was\nsomewhat more humanized than his comrades, in taking leave of us “wished\nus well out of the country, and that we might never have occasion to\nreturn to it!”",
        "“I pity a body,” said he, “when I see them making such an awful mistake\nas to come out this way; for comfort never touched this Western\ncountry.”",
        "We found Mr. Hamilton as agreeable a companion as on the preceding day,\nbut a most desperate rider. He galloped on at such a rate that, had I\nnot exchanged my pony for the fine, noble Jerry, I should have been in\ndanger of being left behind.",
        "Well mounted as we all were, he sometimes nearly distanced us. We were\nnow among the branches of the Pickatonick, and the country had lost its\nprairie character and become rough and broken. We went dashing on,\nsometimes down ravines, sometimes through narrow passes, where, as I\nfollowed, I left fragments of my veil upon the projecting and interwoven\nbranches. Once my hat became entangled, and, had not my husband sprung\nto my rescue, I must have shared the fate of Absalom, Jerry’s ambition\nto keep his place in the race making it probable he would do as did the\nmule who was under the unfortunate prince.",
        "There was no halting upon the route, and, as we kept the same pace until\nthree o’clock in the afternoon, it was beyond a question that when we\nreached “Kellogg’s” we had travelled at least thirty miles. One of my\ngreatest annoyances during the ride had been the behavior of the little\nbeast Brunet. He had been hitherto used as a saddle-horse, and had been\naccustomed to a station in the file near the guide or leader. He did not\nrelish being put in the background as a pack-horse, and accordingly,\nwhenever we approached a stream, where the file broke up to permit each\nhorseman to choose his own place of fording, it was, invariably the case\nthat just as I was reining Jerry into the water, Brunet would come\nrushing past and throw himself into our very footsteps. Plunging,\nsnorting, and splashing me with water, and sometimes even starting Jerry\ninto a leap aside, he more than once brought me into imminent danger of\nbeing tossed into the stream. It was in vain that, after one or two such\nadventures, I learned to hold back and give the vexatious little animal\nthe precedence. His passion seemed to be to go into the water precisely\nat the moment Jerry did; and I was obliged at last to make a bargain\nwith young Roy to dismount and hold him at every stream until I had got\nsafely across.",
        "“Kellogg’s\"[16] was a comfortable mansion, just within the verge of a\npleasant “grove of timber,” as a small forest is called by Western\ntravellers. We found Mrs. Kellogg a very respectable-looking matron, who\nsoon informed us she was from the city of New York. She appeared proud\nand delighted to entertain Mr. Hamilton, for whose family, she took\noccasion to tell us, she had, in former days, been in the habit of doing\nneedle-work.",
        "The worthy woman provided us an excellent dinner, and afterwards\ninstalled me in a rocking-chair beside a large fire, with the “Life of\nMrs. Fletcher” to entertain me, while the gentlemen explored the\npremises, visited Mr. Kellogg’s stock, and took a careful look at their\nown. We had intended to go to Dixon’s the same afternoon, but the snow,\nbeginning again to fall, obliged us to content ourselves where we were.",
        "In the mean time, finding we were journeying to Chicago, Mr. Kellogg\ncame to the determination to accompany us, having, as he said, some\nbusiness to accomplish at that place: so Mrs. Kellogg busied herself in\npreparing him to set off with us the following morning. I pleaded hard\nto remain yet another day, as the following was Sunday, on which I\nobjected to travel; but in view of the necessities of the case, the\nuncertainty of the weather, and the importance of getting as quickly as\npossible through this wild country, my objections were overruled, and I\ncould only obtain a delay in starting until so late in the afternoon as\nwould give us just time to ride the sixteen miles to “Dixon’s” before\nsunset.",
        "No great time was required for Mr. Kellogg’s preparations. He would\ntake, he said, only two days’ provisions, for at his brother-in-law\nDixon’s we should get our supper and breakfast, and the route from there\nto Chicago could, he well knew, be accomplished in a day and a half.",
        "Although, according to this calculation, we had sufficient remaining of\nour stores to carry us to the end of our journey, yet my husband took\nthe precaution of begging Mrs. Kellogg to bake us another bag of\nbiscuits, in case of accidents, and he likewise suggested to Mr. Kellogg\nthe prudence of furnishing himself with something more than his limited\nallowance; but the good man objected that he was unwilling to burden his\nhorse more than was absolutely necessary, seeing that, at this season of\nthe year, we were obliged to carry fodder for the animals, in addition\nto the rest of their load. It will be seen that we had reason to rejoice\nin our own foresight.",
        "My experience of the previous night had rendered me somewhat less\nfastidious than when I commenced my journey, so that, when introduced to\nour sleeping-apartment, which I found we were to share with six men,\ntravellers like ourselves, my only feeling was one of thankfulness that\neach bed was furnished with a full suit of blue checked curtains, which\nformed a very tolerable substitute for a dressing-room.",
        "It was late on the following day (March 13th) when we took leave of our\nkind hostess. She loaded us with cakes, good wishes, and messages to her\nsister Dixon and the children. We journeyed pleasantly along through a\ncountry beautiful in spite of its wintry appearance.",
        "There was a house at Buffalo Grove, at which we stopped for half an\nhour, and where a nice-looking young girl presented us with some\nmaple-sugar of her own making. She entertained us with the history of a\ncontest between two rival claimants for the patronage of the\nstage-wagon, the proprietors of which had not decided whether to send it\nby Buffalo Grove or by another route, which she pointed out to us, at no\ngreat distance. The driver, she took care to inform us, was in favor\nof the former; and the blush with which she replied in the affirmative\nto our inquiry, “Is he a young man?” explained the whole matter\nsatisfactorily.",
        "At length, just at sunset, we reached the dark, rapid waters of the Rock\nRiver. The ferry which we had travelled so far out of our way to take\nadvantage of, proved to be merely a small boat or skiff, the larger one\nhaving been swept off into the stream, and carried down in the\nbreaking-up of the ice, the week previous.",
        "My husband’s first care was to get me across. He placed me with the\nsaddles, packs, etc. in the boat, and as, at that late hour, no time was\nto be lost, he ventured, at the same time, to hold the bridles of the\ntwo most docile horses, to guide them in swimming the river.",
        "When we had proceeded a few rods from the shore, we were startled by a\nloud puffing and blowing near us, and looking around, to our great\nsurprise, discovered little Brunet just upon our “weather-bow.\"\nDetermined not to be outdone by his model, Jerry, he had taken to the\nwater on his own responsibility, and arrived at the opposite shore as\nsoon as any of the party.",
        "All being safely landed, a short walk brought us to the house of Mr.\nDixon. Although so recently come into the country, he had contrived to\nmake everything comfortable around him; and when he ushered us into Mrs.\nDixon’s sitting-room, and seated us by a glowing wood fire, while Mrs.\nDixon busied herself in preparing us a nice supper, I felt that the\ncomfort overbalanced the inconvenience of such a journey.",
        "Mrs. Dixon was surrounded by several children. One leaning against the\nchimney-piece was dressed in the full Indian costume–calico shirt,\nblanket, and leggings. His dark complexion, and full, melancholy eyes,\nwhich he kept fixed upon the ashes in which he was making marks with a\nstick, rarely raising them to gaze on us, as children are wont to do,\ninterested me exceedingly, and I inquired of an intelligent little girl,\nevidently a daughter of our host,–",
        "“Who is that boy?”",
        "“Oh, that is John Ogie,” answered she.",
        "“What is the matter with him? he looks very sad.”",
        "“Oh, he is fretting after his mother.”",
        "“Is she dead, then?”",
        "“Some say she is dead, and some say she is gone away. I guess she is\ndead, and buried up in one of those graves yonder\"–pointing to two or\nthree little picketed inclosures upon a rising ground opposite the\nwindow.",
        "I felt a strong sympathy with the child, which was increased when the\nlittle spokeswoman, in answer to my inquiry, “Has he no father?\"\nreplied,–",
        "“Oh, yes, but he goes away, and drinks, and don’t care for his\nchildren.”",
        "“And what becomes of John then?”",
        "“He stays here with us, and we teach him to read, and he learns\ndreadful fast.”",
        "When the boy at length turned his large dark eyes upon me, it went to my\nheart. It was such a motherless look. And it was explained when, long\nafterwards, I learned his further history. His mother was still living,\nand he knew it, although, with the reserve peculiar to his people, he\nnever spoke of her to his young companions. Unable to endure the\ncontinued ill treatment of her husband, a surly, intemperate Canadian,\nshe had left him, and returned to her own family among the\nPottowattamies. Years after, this boy and a brother who had also been\nleft behind with their father found their way to the Upper Missouri, to\njoin their mother, who, with the others of her tribe, had been removed\nby the Government from the shores of Lake Michigan.",
        "A most savory supper of ducks and venison, with their accompaniments,\nsoon smoked upon the board, and we did ample justice to it. Travelling\nis a great sharpener of the appetite, and so is cheerfulness; and the\nlatter was increased by the encouraging account Mr. Dixon gave us of the\nremainder of the route yet before us.",
        "“There is no difficulty,” said he, “if you keep a little to the north,\nand strike the great Sauk trail. If you get too far to the south, you\nwill come upon the Winnebago Swamp, and, once in that, there is no\ntelling when you will ever get out again. As for the distance, it is\nnothing at all to speak of. Two young men came out here from Chicago,\non foot, last fall. They got here the evening of the second day; and,\neven with a lady in your party, you could go on horseback in less time\nthan that. The only thing is to be sure and get on the great track that\nthe Sauks have made, in going every year from the Mississippi to Canada,\nto receive their presents from the British Indian Agent.”",
        "The following morning, which was a bright and lovely one for that season\nof the year, we took leave of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon, in high spirits. We\ntravelled for the first few miles along the beautiful, undulating banks\nof the Rock River, always in an easterly direction, keeping the beaten\npath, or rather road, which led to Fort Clark, or Peoria. The Sauk\ntrail, we had been told, would cross this road at the distance of about\nsix miles.",
        "After having travelled, as we judged, fully that distance, we came upon\na trail bearing northeast, and a consultation was held as to the\nprobability of its being the one we were in search of.",
        "Mr. Kinzie was of opinion that it tended too much to the north, and was,\nmoreover, too faint and obscure for a trail so much used, and by so\nlarge a body of Indians in their annual journeys.",
        "Plante was positive as to its being the very spot where he and “Piché\"\nin their journey to Port Winnebago, the year before, struck into the\ngreat road. “On that very rising-ground at the point of woods, he\nremembered perfectly well stopping to shoot ducks, which they ate for\ntheir supper.”",
        "Mr. Kellogg was non-committal, but sided alternately with each speaker.",
        "As Plante was “the guide,” and withal so confident of being right, it\nwas decided to follow him, not without some demurring, however, on the\npart of the bourgeois, who every now and then called to halt, to\ndiscuss the state of affairs.",
        "“Now, Plante,” he would say, “I am sure you are leading us too far\nnorth. Why, man, if we keep on in this direction, following the course\nof the river, we shall bring up at Kosh-ko-nong, instead of Chicago.”",
        "“Ah! mon bourgeois,” would the light-hearted Canadian reply, “would I\ntell you this is the road if I were not quite certain? Only one year ago\nI travelled it, and can I forget so soon? Oh, no–I remember every foot\nof it.”",
        "But Monsieur Plante was convinced of his mistake when the trail brought\nus to the great bend of the river with its bold rocky bluffs.",
        "“Are you satisfied now, Plante?” asked Mr. Kinzie. “By your leave, I\nwill now play pilot myself.” And he struck off from the trail, in a\ndirection as nearly east as possible.",
        "The weather had changed and become intensely cold, and we felt that the\ndetention we had met with, even should we now be in the right road, was\nno trifling matter. We had not added to our stock of provisions at\nDixon’s, wishing to carry as much forage as we were able for our horses,\nfor whom the scanty picking around our encamping-grounds afforded an\ninsufficient meal. But we were buoyed up by the hope that we were in the\nright path at last, and we journeyed on until night, when we reached a\ncomfortable “encampment,” in the edge of a grove near a small stream.",
        "Oh, how bitterly cold that night was! The salted provisions, to which I\nwas accustomed, occasioned me an intolerable thirst, and my husband was\nin the habit of placing the little tin coffee-pot filled with water at\nmy bed’s head when we went to rest, but this night it was frozen solid\nlong before midnight. We were so well wrapped up in blankets that we\ndid not suffer from cold while within the tent, but the open air was\nsevere in the extreme.",
        "March 15th.–We were roused by the bourgeois at peep of day to make\npreparations for starting. We must find the Sauk trail this day at all\nhazards. What would become of us should we fail to do so? It was a\nquestion no one liked to ask, and certainly one that none could have\nanswered.",
        "On leaving our encampment, we found ourselves entering a marshy tract of\ncountry. Myriads of wild geese, brant, and ducks rose up screaming at\nour approach. The more distant lakes and ponds were black with them, but\nthe shallow water through which we attempted to make our way was frozen,\nby the severity of the night, to a thickness not quite sufficient to\nbear the horses, but just such as to cut their feet and ankles at every\nstep as they broke through it. Sometimes the difficulty of going forward\nwas so great that we were obliged to retrace our steps and make our way\nround the head of the marsh, thus adding to the discomforts of our\nsituation by the conviction that, while journeying diligently, we were,\nin fact, making very little progress.",
        "This swampy region at length passed, we came upon more solid ground,\nchiefly the open prairie. But now a new trouble assailed us. The weather\nhad moderated, and a blinding snow-storm came on. Without a trail that\nwe could rely upon, and destitute of a compass, our only dependence had\nbeen the sun to point out our direction; but the atmosphere was now so\nobscure that it was impossible to tell in what quarter of the heavens he\nwas.",
        "We pursued our way, however, and a devious one it must have been. After\ntravelling in this way many miles, we came upon an Indian trail, deeply\nindented, running at right angles with the course we were pursuing. The\nsnow had ceased, and, the clouds becoming thinner, we were able to\nobserve the direction of the sun, and to perceive that the trail ran\nnorth and south. What should we do? Was it safest to pursue our easterly\ncourse, or was it probable that by following this new path we should\nfall into the direct one we had been so long seeking? If we decided to\ntake the trail, should we go north or south? Mr. Kinzie was for the\nlatter. He was of opinion we were still too far north–somewhere about\nthe Grand Marais, or Kish-wau-kee. Mr. Kellogg and Plante were for\ntaking the northerly direction. The latter was positive his bourgeois\nhad already gone too far south–in fact, that we must now be in the\nneighborhood of the Illinois River. Finding himself in the minority, my\nhusband yielded, and we turned our horses’ heads north, much against his\nwill. After proceeding a few miles, however, he took a sudden\ndetermination. “You may go north, if you please,” said he, “but I am\nconvinced that the other course is right, and I shall face about–follow\nwho will.”",
        "So we wheeled round and rode south again, and many a long and weary mile\ndid we travel, the monotony of our ride broken only by the querulous\nremarks of poor Mr. Kellogg. “I am really afraid we are wrong, Mr.\nKinzie. I feel pretty sure that the young man is right. It looks most\nnatural to me that we should take a northerly course, and not be\nstretching away so far to the south.”",
        "To all this, Mr. Kinzie turned a deaf ear. The Frenchmen rode in\nsilence. They would as soon have thought of cutting off their right hand\nas showing opposition to the bourgeois when he had once expressed his\ndecision. They would never have dreamed of offering an opinion or remark\nunless called upon to do so.",
        "The road, which had continued many miles through the prairie, at\nlength, in winding round a point of woods, brought us suddenly upon an\nIndian village. A shout of joy broke from the whole party, but no\nanswering shout was returned–not even a bark of friendly welcome–as we\ngalloped up to the wigwams. All was silent as the grave. We rode round\nand round, then dismounted and looked into several of the spacious huts.\nThey had evidently been long deserted. Nothing remained but the bare\nwalls of bark, from which everything in the shape of furniture had been\nstripped by the owners and carried with them to their wintering-grounds,\nto be brought back in the spring, when they returned to make their\ncorn-fields and occupy their summer cabins.",
        "Our disappointment may be better imagined than described. With heavy\nhearts, we mounted and once more pursued our way, the snow again falling\nand adding to the discomforts of our position. At length we halted for\nthe night. We had long been aware that our stock of provisions was\ninsufficient for another day, and here we were–nobody knew where–in\nthe midst of woods and prairies–certainly far from any human\nhabitation, with barely enough food for a slender evening’s meal.",
        "The poor dogs came whining round us to beg their usual portion, but they\nwere obliged to content themselves with a bare bone, and we retired to\nrest with the feeling that if not actually hungry then, we should\ncertainly be so to-morrow.",
        "The morrow came. Plante and Roy had a bright fire and a nice pot of\ncoffee for us. It was our only breakfast, for, on shaking the bag and\nturning it inside out, we could make no more of our stock of bread than\nthree crackers, which the rest of the party insisted I should put in my\npocket for my dinner. I was much touched by the kindness of Mr. Kellogg,\nwho drew from his wallet a piece of tongue and a slice of fruit-cake,\nwhich he said “he had been saving for the lady since the day before,\nfor he saw how matters were a going.”",
        "Poor man! it would have been well if he had listened to Mr. Kinzie and\nprovided himself at the outset with a larger store of provisions. As it\nwas, those he brought with him were exhausted early in the second day,\nand he had been boarding with us for the last two meals.",
        "We still had the trail to guide us, and we continued to follow it until\nabout nine o’clock, when, in emerging from a wood, we came upon a broad\nand rapid river. A collection of Indian wigwams stood upon the opposite\nbank, and, as the trail led directly to the water, it was fair to infer\nthat the stream was fordable. We had no opportunity of testing it,\nhowever, for the banks were so lined with ice, which was piled up tier\nupon tier by the breaking-up of the previous week, that we tried in vain\nto find a path by which we could descend the bank to the water.",
        "The men shouted again and again, in hopes some straggling inhabitant of\nthe village might be at hand with his canoe. No answer was returned,\nsave by the echoes. What was to be done? I looked at my husband and saw\nthat care was on his brow, although he still continued to speak\ncheerfully. “We will follow this cross-trail down the bank of the\nriver,” said he. “There must be Indians wintering near, in some of these\npoints of wood.”",
        "I must confess that I felt somewhat dismayed at our prospects, but I\nkept up a show of courage, and did not allow my despondency to be seen.\nAll the party were dull and gloomy enough.",
        "We kept along the bank, which was considerably elevated above the water,\nand bordered at a little distance with a thick wood. All at once my\nhorse, who was mortally afraid of Indians, began to jump and prance,\nsnorting and pricking up his ears as if an enemy were at hand. I\nscreamed with delight to my husband, who was at the head of the file,\n\"Oh, John! John! there are Indians near–look at Jerry!”",
        "At this instant a little Indian dog ran out from under the bushes by the\nroadside, and began barking at us. Never were sounds more welcome. We\nrode directly into the thicket, and, descending into a little hollow,\nfound two squaws crouching behind the bushes, trying to conceal\nthemselves from our sight.",
        "They appeared greatly relieved when Mr. Kinzie addressed them in the\nPottowattamie language,–",
        "“What are you doing here?”",
        "“Digging Indian potatoes\"–(a species of artichoke.)",
        "“Where is your lodge?”",
        "“On the other side of the river.”",
        "“Good–then you have a canoe here. Can you take us across?”",
        "“Yes–the canoe is very small.”",
        "They conducted us down the bank to the water’s edge where the canoe was.\nIt was indeed very small. My husband explained to them that they must\ntake me across first, and then return for the others of the party.",
        "“Will you trust yourself alone over the river?” inquired he. “You see\nthat but one can cross at a time.”",
        "“Oh, yes\"–and I was soon placed in the bottom of the canoe, lying flat\nand looking up at the sky, while the older squaw took the paddle in her\nhand, and placed herself on her knees at my head, and the younger, a\ngirl of fourteen or fifteen, stationed herself at my feet. There was\njust room enough for me to lie in this position, each of the others\nkneeling in the opposite ends of the canoe.",
        "While these preparations were making, Mr. Kinzie questioned the women as\nto our whereabout. They knew no name for the river but “Saumanong.\"\nThis was not definite, it being the generic term for any large stream.\nBut he gathered that the village we had passed higher up, on the\nopposite side of the stream, was Wau-ban-see’s, and then he knew that we\nwere on the Fox River, and probably about fifty miles from Chicago.",
        "The squaw, in answer to his inquiries, assured him that Chicago was\n\"close by.”",
        "“That means,” said he, “that it is not so far off as Canada. We must not\nbe too sanguine.”",
        "The men set about unpacking the horses, and I in the mean time was\npaddled across the river. The old woman immediately returned, leaving\nthe younger one with me for company. I seated myself on the fallen trunk\nof a tree, in the midst of the snow, and looked across the dark waters.\nI am not ashamed to confess my weakness–for the first time on my\njourney I shed tears. It was neither hunger, nor fear, nor cold, which\nextorted them from me. It was the utter desolation of spirit, the\nsickness of heart which “hope deferred” ever occasions, and which of all\nevils is the hardest to bear.",
        "The poor little squaw looked into my face with a wondering and\nsympathizing expression. Probably she was speculating in her own mind\nwhat a person who rode so fine a horse, and wore so comfortable a\nbroadcloth dress, could have to cry about. I pointed to a seat beside me\non the log, but she preferred standing and gazing at me, with the same\npitying expression. Presently she was joined by a young companion, and,\nafter a short chattering, of which I was evidently the subject, they\nboth trotted off into the woods, and left me to my own solitary\nreflections.",
        "“What would my friends at the East think,” said I to myself, “if they\ncould see me now? What would poor old Mrs. Welsh say? She who warned me\nthat if I came away so far to the West, I should break my heart?Would she not rejoice to find how likely her prediction was to be\nfulfilled?”",
        "These thoughts roused me. I dried up my tears, and by the time my\nhusband with his party and all his horses and luggage were across, I had\nrecovered my cheerfulness, and was ready for fresh adventures.",
        "We followed the old squaw to her lodge, which was at no great distance\nin the woods. I had never before been in an Indian lodge, although I had\noccasionally peeped into one of the many always clustered round the\nhouse of the Interpreter at the Portage.",
        "This one was very nicely arranged. Four sticks of wood placed to form a\nsquare in the centre, answered the purpose of a hearth, within which the\nfire was built, the smoke escaping through an opening in the top. The\nmats of which the lodge was constructed were very neat and new, and\nagainst the sides, depending from the poles or frame-work, hung various\nbags of Indian manufacture, containing their dried food and other\nhousehold treasures. Sundry ladles, small kettles, and wooden bowls also\nhung from the cross-poles; and dangling from the centre, by an iron\nchain, was a large kettle in which some dark, suspicious-looking\nsubstance was seething over the scanty fire. On the floor of the lodge,\nbetween the fire and the outer wall, were spread mats, upon which my\nhusband invited me to be seated and make myself comfortable.",
        "The first demand of an Indian on meeting a white man is for bread, of\nwhich they are exceedingly fond, and I knew enough of the Pottowattamie\nlanguage to comprehend the timid ’pe-qua-zhe-gun choh-kay-go” (I have\nno bread) with which the squaw commenced our conversation after my\nhusband had left the lodge.",
        "I shook my head, and endeavored to convey to her that, so far from being\nable to give, I had had no breakfast myself. She understood me, and\ninstantly produced a bowl, into which she ladled a quantity of Indian\npotatoes from the kettle over the fire, and set them before me. I was\ntoo hungry to be fastidious, and, owing partly, no doubt, to the\nsharpness of my appetite, I really found them delicious.",
        "Two little girls, inmates of the lodge, sat gazing at me with evident\nadmiration and astonishment, which were increased when I took my little\nPrayer book from my pocket and began to read. They had, undoubtedly,\nnever seen a book before, and I was amused at the care with which they\nlooked away from me, while they questioned their mother about my\nstrange employment and listened to her replies.",
        "While thus occupied, I was startled by a sudden sound of “hogh!” and the\nmat which hung over the entrance of the lodge was raised, and an Indian\nentered with that graceful bound which is peculiar to themselves. It was\nthe master of the lodge, who had been out to shoot ducks, and was just\nreturned. He was a tall, finely-formed man, with a cheerful, open\ncountenance, and he listened to what his wife in a quiet tone related to\nhim, while he divested himself of his accoutrements, in the most\nunembarrassed, well-bred manner imaginable.",
        "Soon my husband joined us. He had been engaged in attending to the\ncomfort of his horses, and assisting his men in making their fire, and\npitching their tent, which the rising storm made a matter of some\ndifficulty.",
        "From the Indian he learned that we were in what was called the Big\nWoods,[17] or “Piché’s Grove,” from a Frenchman of that name living not\nfar from the spot–that the river we had crossed was the Fox River–that\nhe could guide us to Piché’s, from which the road was perfectly plain,\nor even into Chicago if we preferred–but that we had better remain\nencamped for that day, as there was a storm coming on, and in the mean\ntime he would go and shoot some ducks for our dinner and supper. He was\naccordingly furnished with powder and shot, and set off again for game\nwithout delay.",
        "I had put into my pocket, on leaving home, a roll of scarlet ribbon, in\ncase a stout string should be wanted, and I now drew it forth, and with\nthe knife which hung around my neck I cut off a couple of yards for each\nof the little girls. They received it with great delight, and their\nmother, dividing each portion into two, tied a piece to each of the\nlittle clubs into which their hair was knotted on the temples. They\nlaughed, and exclaimed “Saum!” as they gazed at each other, and their\nmother joined in their mirth, although, as I thought, a little unwilling\nto display her maternal exultation before a stranger.",
        "The tent being all in order, my husband came for me, and we took leave\nof our friends in the wigwam, with grateful hearts.",
        "The storm was raging without. The trees were bending and cracking around\nus, and the air was completely filled with the wild-fowl screaming and\nquacking as they made their way southward before the blast. Our tent\nwas among the trees not far from the river. My husband took me to the\nbank to look for a moment at what we had escaped. The wind was sweeping\ndown from the north in a perfect hurricane. The water was filled with\nmasses of snow and ice, dancing along upon the torrent, over which were\nhurrying thousands of wild-fowl, making the woods resound to their\ndeafening clamor.",
        "Had we been one hour later, we could not possibly have crossed the\nstream, and there would have been nothing for us but to have remained\nand starved in the wilderness. Could we be sufficiently grateful to that\nkind Providence that had brought us safely through such dangers?",
        "The men had cut down an immense tree, and built a fire against it, but\nthe wind shifted so continually that every five minutes the tent would\nbecome completely filled with smoke, so that I was driven into the open\nair for breath. Then I would seat myself on one end of the huge log, as\nnear the fire as possible, for it was dismally cold, but the wind seemed\nactuated by a kind of caprice, for in whatever direction I took my seat,\njust that way came the smoke and hot ashes, puffing in my face until I\nwas nearly blinded. Neither veil nor silk handkerchief afforded an\neffectual protection, and I was glad when the arrival of our huntsmen,\nwith a quantity of ducks, gave me an opportunity of diverting my\nthoughts from my own sufferings, by aiding the men to pick them and get\nthem ready for our meal.",
        "We borrowed a kettle from our Indian friends. It was not remarkably\nclean; but we heated a little water in it, and prairie-hay’d it out,\nbefore consigning our birds to it, and with a bowl of Indian potatoes, a\npresent from our kind neighbors, we soon had an excellent soup.",
        "What with the cold, the smoke, and the driving ashes and cinders, this\nwas the most uncomfortable afternoon I had yet passed, and I was glad\nwhen night came, and I could creep into the tent and cover myself up in\nthe blankets, out of the way of all three of these evils.",
        "The storm raged with tenfold violence during the night. We were\ncontinually startled by the crashing of the falling trees around us, and\nwho could tell but that the next would be upon us? Spite of our fatigue,\nwe passed an almost sleepless night. When we arose in the morning, we\nwere made fully alive to the perils by which we had been surrounded. At\nleast fifty trees, the giants of the forest, lay prostrate within view\nof the tent.",
        "When we had taken our scanty breakfast, and were mounted and ready for\ndeparture, it was with difficulty we could thread our way, so completely\nwas it obstructed by the fallen trunks.",
        "Our Indian guide had joined us at an early hour, and after conducting us\ncarefully out of the wood, and pointing out to us numerous\nbee-trees,[18] for which he said that grove was famous, he set off at a\nlong trot, and about nine o’clock brought us to Piché’s, a log cabin\non a rising ground, looking off over the broad prairie to the east. We\nhad hoped to get some refreshment here, Piché being an old acquaintance\nof some of the party; but, alas! the master was from home. We found his\ncabin occupied by Indians and travellers–the latter few, the former\nnumerous.",
        "There was no temptation to a halt, except that of warming ourselves at a\nbright fire that was burning in the clay chimney. A man in Quaker\ncostume stepped forward to answer our inquiries, and offered to become\nour escort to Chicago, to which place he was bound–so we dismissed our\nIndian friend, with a satisfactory remuneration for all the trouble he\nhad so kindly taken for us.",
        "A long reach of prairie extended from Piché’s to the Du Page, between\nthe two forks of which, Mr. Dogherty, our new acquaintance, told us, we\nshould find the dwelling of a Mr. Hawley, who would give us a\ncomfortable dinner.",
        "The weather was intensely cold; the wind, sweeping over the wide prairie\nwith nothing to break its force, chilled our very hearts. I beat my feet\nagainst the saddle to restore the circulation, when they became benumbed\nwith the cold, until they were so bruised I could beat them no longer.\nNot a house or wigwam, not even a clump of trees as a shelter, offered\nitself for many a weary mile. At length we reached the west fork of the\nDu Page. It was frozen, but not sufficiently so to bear the horses. Our\nonly resource was to cut a way for them through the ice. It was a work\nof time, for the ice had frozen to several inches in thickness during\nthe last bitter night. Plante went first with an axe, and cut as far as\nhe could reach, then mounted one of the hardy little ponies, and With\nsome difficulty broke the ice before him, until he had opened a passage\nto the opposite shore.",
        "How the poor animals shivered as they were reined in among the floating\nice! And we, who sat waiting in the piercing wind, were not much better\noff. Probably Brunet was of the same opinion; for, with his usual\nperversity, he plunged in immediately after Plante, and stood shaking\nand quaking behind him, every now and then looking around him, as much\nas to say, “I’ve got ahead of you, this time!” We were all across at\nlast, and spurred on our horses, until we reached Hawley’s[19]–a\nlarge, commodious dwelling, near the east fork of the river.",
        "The good woman welcomed us kindly, and soon made us warm and\ncomfortable. We felt as if we were in a civilized land once more. She\nproceeded immediately to prepare dinner for us; and we watched her with\neager eyes, as she took down a huge ham from the rafters, out of which\nshe cut innumerable slices, then broke a dozen or more of fine fresh\neggs into a pan, in readiness for frying–then mixed a johnny-cake,\nand placed it against a board in front of the fire to bake. It seemed to\nme that even with the aid of this fine, bright fire, the dinner took an\nunconscionable time to cook; but cooked it was, at last, and truly might\nthe good woman stare at the travellers’ appetites we had brought with\nus. She did not know what short commons we had been on for the last two\ndays.",
        "We found, upon inquiry, that we could, by pushing on, reach Lawton’s, on\nthe Aux Plaines, that night–we should then be within twelve miles of\nChicago. Of course we made no unnecessary delay, but set off as soon\nafter dinner as possible.",
        "The crossing of the east fork of the Du Page was more perilous than the\nformer one had been. The ice had become broken, either by the force of\nthe current, or by some equestrians having preceded us and cut through\nit, so that when we reached the bank, the ice was floating down in large\ncakes. The horses had to make a rapid dart through the water, which was\nso high, and rushing in such a torrent, that if I had not been mounted\non Jerry, the tallest horse in the cavalcade, I must have got a terrible\nsplashing.",
        "As it was, I was well frightened, and grasped both bridle and mane with\nthe utmost tenacity. After this we travelled on as rapidly as possible,\nin order to reach our place of destination before dark.",
        "Mr. Dogherty, a tall, bolt-upright man, half Quaker, half Methodist, did\nhis best to entertain me, by giving me a thorough schedule of his\nreligious opinions, with the reasons from Scripture upon which they were\nbased. He was a good deal of a perfectionist, and evidently looked upon\nhimself with no small satisfaction, as a living illustration of his\nfavorite doctrine.",
        "“St. John says,” this was the style of his discourse, “St. John says,\n’He that is born of God, doth not commit sin’ Now, if I am born of\nGod, I do not commit sin.”",
        "I was too cold and too weary to argue the point, so I let him have it\nall his own way. I believe he must have thought me rather a dull\ncompanion; but at least he gave me the credit of being a good listener.",
        "It was almost dark when we reached Lawton’s. The Aux Plaines[20] was\nfrozen, and the house was on the other side. By loud shouting, we\nbrought out a man from the building, and he succeeded in cutting the\nice, and bringing a canoe over to us; but not until it had become\ndifficult to distinguish objects in the darkness.",
        "A very comfortable house was Lawton’s, after we did reach it–carpeted,\nand with a warm stove–in fact, quite in civilized style, Mr. Weeks, the\nman who brought us across, was the major-domo, during the temporary\nabsence of Mr. Lawton.",
        "Mrs. Lawton was a young woman, and not ill-looking. She complained\nbitterly of the loneliness of her condition, and having been “brought\nout there into the woods; which was a thing she had not expected, when\nshe came from the East.” We did not ask her with what expectations she\nhad come to a wild, unsettled country; but we tried to comfort her with\nthe assurance that things would grow better in a few years. She said,\n\"She did not mean to wait for that. She should go back to her family in\nthe East, if Mr. Lawton did not invite some of her young friends to come\nand stay with her, and make it agreeable.”",
        "We could hardly realize, on rising the following morning, that only\ntwelve miles of prairie intervened between us and Chicago le Désiré,\nas I could not but name it.",
        "We could look across the extended plain, and on its farthest verge were\nvisible two tall trees, which my husband pointed out to me as the\nplanting of his own hand, when a boy. Already they had become so lofty\nas to serve as landmarks, and they were constantly in view as we\ntravelled the beaten road. I was continually repeating to myself, “There\nlive the friends I am so longing to see! There will terminate all our\ntrials and hardships!”",
        "A Mr. Wentworth joined us on the road, and of him we inquired after the\nwelfare of the family, from whom we had, for a long time, received no\nintelligence. When we reached Chicago, he took us to a little tavern at\nthe forks of the river. This portion of the place was then called Wolf\nPoint, from its having been the residence of an Indian named\n”Moaway,” or “the Wolf.”",
        "“Dear me,” said the old landlady, at the little tavern, “what dreadful\ncold weather you must have had to travel in! Why, two days ago the river\nwas all open here, and now it’s frozen hard enough for folks to cross\na-horseback!”",
        "Notwithstanding this assurance, my husband did not like to venture, so\nhe determined to leave his horses and proceed on foot to the residence\nof his mother and sister, a distance of about half a mile.",
        "We set out on our walk, which was first across the ice, then down the\nnorthern bank of the river. As we approached the house we were espied by\nGenevieve, a half-breed servant of the family. She did not wait to\nsalute us, but flew into the house, crying,–",
        "“Oh! Madame Kinzie, who do you think has come? Monsieur John and Madame\nJohn, all the way from Fort Winnebago on foot!”",
        "Soon we were in the arms of our dear, kind friends. A messenger was\ndispatched to “the garrison” for the remaining members of the family,\nand for that day, at least, I was the wonder and admiration of the whole\ncircle, “for the dangers I had seen.”",
        "Fort Dearborn at that day consisted of the same buildings as at\npresent.[21] They were, of course, in a better state of preservation,\nthough still considerably dilapidated. They had been erected in 1816,\nunder the supervision of Captain Hezekiah Bradley, and there was a story\ncurrent that, such was his patriotic regard for the interests of the\nGovernment, he obliged the soldiers to fashion wooden pins, instead of\nspikes and nails, to fasten the timbers of the buildings, and that he\neven called on the junior officers to aid in their construction along\nwith the soldiers, whose business it was. If this were true, the captain\nmust have labored under the delusion (excusable in one who had lived\nlong on the frontier) that Government would thank its servants for any\nexcess of economical zeal.",
        "The fort was inclosed by high pickets, with bastions at the alternate\nangles. Large gates opened to the north and south, and there were small\nposterns here and there for the accommodation of the inmates. The bank\nof the river which stretches to the west, now covered by the light-house\nbuildings, and inclosed by docks, was then occupied by the root-houses\nof the garrison. Beyond the parade-ground, which extended south of the\npickets, were the company gardens, well filled with currant-bushes and\nyoung fruit-trees.",
        "The fort stood at what might naturally be supposed to be the mouth of\nthe river. It was not so, however, for in those days the latter took a\nturn, sweeping round the promontory on which the fort was built, towards\nthe south, and joining the lake about half a mile below. These buildings\nstood on the right bank of the river, the left being a long spit of land\nextending from the northern shore, of which it formed a part. After the\ncutting through of this portion of the left bank in 1833 by the United\nStates Engineers employed to construct a harbor at this point, and the\nthrowing out of the piers, the water overflowed this long tongue of\nland, and, continually encroaching on the southern bank, robbed it of\nmany valuable acres; while, by the same action of the vast body of the\nlake, an accretion was constantly taking place on the north of the\nharbor.",
        "The residence of Jean Baptiste Beaubien stood at this period between the\ngardens and the river-bank, and still farther south was a rickety\ntenement, built many years before by Mr. John Dean, the sutler of the\npost. A short time after the commencement of the growth of Chicago, the\nfoundations of this building were undermined by the gradual encroachment\nof the lake, and it tumbled backward down the bank, where it long lay, a\nmelancholy spectacle.",
        "On the northern bank of the river, directly facing the fort, was the\nfamily mansion of my husband.[22] It was a long, low building, with a\npiazza extending along its front, a range of four or five rooms. A broad\ngreen space was inclosed between it and the river, and shaded by a row\nof Lombardy poplars. Two immense cottonwood-trees stood in the rear of\nthe building, one of which still remains as an ancient landmark. A fine,\nwell-cultivated garden extended to the north of the dwelling, and\nsurrounding it were various buildings appertaining to the\nestablishment–dairy, bake-house, lodging-house for the Frenchmen, and\nstables.",
        "A vast range of sand-hills, covered with stunted cedars, pines, and\ndwarf-willow-trees, intervened between the house and the lake, which\nwas, at this time, not more than thirty rods distant.",
        "Proceeding from this point along the northern bank of the river, we came\nfirst to the Agency House, “Cobweb Castle,” as it had been denominated\nwhile long the residence of a bachelor, and the sobriquet adhered to\nit ever after. It stood at what is now the southwest corner of\nWolcott[23] and N. Water Streets. Many will still remember it, a\nsubstantial, compact little building of logs hewed and squared, with a\ncentre, two wings, and, strictly speaking, two tails, since, when\nthere was found no more room for additions at the sides, they were\nplaced in the rear, whereon a vacant spot could be found.",
        "These appendages did not mar the symmetry of the whole, as viewed from\nthe front, but when, in the process of the town’s improvement, a street\nwas maliciously opened directly in the rear of the building, the whole\nestablishment, with its comical little adjuncts, was a constant source\nof amusement to the passers-by. No matter. There were pleasant, happy\nhours passed under its odd-shaped roof, as many of Chicago’s early\nsettlers can testify.",
        "Around the Agency House were grouped a collection of log buildings, the\nresidences of the different persons in the employ of Government,\nappertaining to that establishment–blacksmith, striker, and laborers.\nThese were for the most part Canadians or half-breeds, with occasionally\na stray Yankee, to set all things going by his activity and enterprise.",
        "There was still another house on the north side of the river, built by a\nformer resident by the name of Miller, but he had removed to “Rivière du\nChemin,” or Trail Creek, which about this time began to be called\n\"Michigan City.\"[24] This house, which stood near the forks of the\nriver, was at this time vacant.",
        "There was no house on the southern bank of the river, between the fort\nand “The Point,” as the forks of the river were then called. The land\nwas a low wet prairie, scarcely affording good walking in the dryest\nsummer weather, while at other seasons it was absolutely impassable. A\nmuddy streamlet, or, as it is called in this country, a slew,[25]\nafter winding around from about the present site of the Tremont House,\nfell into the river at the foot of State Street.[26]",
        "At the Point, on the south side, stood a house just completed by Mark\nBeaubien. It was a pretentious white two-story building, with\nbright-blue wooden shutters, the admiration of all the little circle at\nWolf Point. Here a canoe ferry was kept to transport people across the\nsouth branch of the river.",
        "Facing down the river from the west was, first a small tavern kept by\nMr. Wentworth, familiarly known as “Old Geese,” not from any want of\nshrewdness on his part, but in compliment to one of his own cant\nexpressions. Near him were two or three log cabins occupied by Robinson,\nthe Pottowattamie chief, and some of his wife’s connexions. Billy\nCaldwell, the Sau-ga-nash, too, resided here occasionally, with his\nwife, who was a daughter of Nee-scot-nee-meg, one of the most famous\nchiefs of the nation. A little remote from these residences was a small\nsquare log building, originally designed for a school-house, but\noccasionally used as a place of worship whenever any itinerant minister\npresented himself.",
        "The family of Clybourn had, previous to this time, established\nthemselves near their present residence on the North Branch–they called\ntheir place New Virginia. Four miles up the South Branch was an old\nbuilding which was at one time an object of great interest as having\nbeen the theatre of some stirring events during the troubles of\n1812.[27] It was denominated Lee’s Place, or Hardscrabble. Here lived,\nat this time, a settler named Heacock.",
        "Owing to the badness of the roads a greater part of the year, the usual\nmode of communication between the fort and the Point was by a boat rowed\nup the river, or by a canoe paddled by some skilful hand. By the latter\nmeans, too, an intercourse was kept up between the residents of the fort\nand the Agency House.",
        "There were, at this time, two companies of soldiers in the garrison, but\nof the officers one, Lieutenant Furman, had died the autumn previous,\nand several of the others were away on furlough. In the absence of Major\nFowle and Captain Scott, the command devolved on Lieutenant Hunter.\nBesides him, there were Lieutenants Engle and Foster–the latter\nunmarried. Dr. Finley, the post surgeon, was also absent, and his place\nwas supplied by Dr. Harmon, a gentleman from Vermont.",
        "My husband’s mother, two sisters, and brother resided at the Agency\nHouse–the family residence near the lake being occupied by J.N. Bailey,\nthe postmaster.",
        "In the Dean House lived a Mr. and Mrs. Forbes, who kept a school.\nGholson Kercheval had a small trading establishment in one of the log\nbuildings at Wolf Point, and John S.C. Hogan superintended the sutler’s\nstore in the garrison.",
        "There was also a Mr. See lately come into the country, living at the\nPoint, who sometimes held forth in the little school-house on a Sunday,\nless to the edification of his hearers than to the unmerciful slaughter\nof the “King’s English.”",
        "I think this enumeration comprises all the white inhabitants of Chicago\nat a period less than half a century ago. To many who may read these\npages the foregoing particulars will, doubtless, appear uninteresting.\nBut to those who visit Chicago, and still more to those who come to make\nit their home, it may be not without interest to look back to its first\nbeginnings; to contemplate the almost magical change which a few years\nhave wrought; and from the past to augur the marvellous prosperity of\nthe future.",
        "The origin of the name Chicago is a subject of discussion, some of the\nIndians deriving it from the fitch or polecat, others from the wild\nonion with which the woods formerly abounded; but all agree that the\nplace received its name from an old chief who was drowned in the stream\nin former times. That this event, although so carefully preserved by\ntradition, must have occurred in a very remote period, is evident from\nan old French manuscript brought by General Cass from France.",
        "In this paper, which purports to be a letter from M. de Ligney, at Green\nBay, to M. de Siette, among the Illinois, dated as early as 1726, the\nplace is designated as “Chica-goux.” This orthography is also found in\nold family letters of the beginning of the present century.",
        "In giving the early history of Chicago, the Indians say, with great\nsimplicity, “the first white man who settled here was a negro.”",
        "This was Jean Baptiste Point-au-Sable, a native of St. Domingo, who,\nabout the year 1796, found his way to this remote region, and commenced\na life among the Indians. There is usually a strong affection between\nthese two races, and Jean Baptiste imposed upon his new friends by\nmaking them believe that he had been a “great chief” among the whites.\nPerhaps he was disgusted at not being elected to a similar dignity by\nthe Pottowattamies, for he quitted this vicinity, and finally terminated\nhis days at Peoria, under the roof of his friend Glamorgan, another St.\nDomingo negro, who had obtained large Spanish grants in St. Louis and\nits environs, and who, at one time, was in the enjoyment of an extensive\nlanded estate.",
        "Point-au-Sable had made some improvements at Chicago, which were taken\npossession of by a Frenchman named Le Mai, who commenced trading with\nthe Indians. After a few years Le Mai’s establishment was purchased by\nJohn Kinzie, Esq., who at that time resided at Bertrand, or Parc aux\nVaches, as it was then called, near Niles, in Michigan. As this\ngentleman was for nearly twenty years, with the exception of the\nmilitary, the only white inhabitant of Northern Illinois, some\nparticulars of his early life may not be uninteresting.",
        "He was born in Quebec in 1163. His mother had been previously married to\na gentleman of the name of Haliburton. The only daughter of this\nmarriage was the mother of General Fleming, Nicholas Low, Esq., and Mrs.\nCharles King, of New York. She is described as a lady of remarkable\nbeauty and accomplishments. Mr. Kinzie was the only child of the second\nmarriage. His father died in his infancy, and his mother married a third\ntime a Mr. Forsyth, after which they removed to the city of New York.",
        "At the age of ten or eleven years he was placed at school with two of\nhis half-brothers at Williamsburg, L.I. A negro servant was sent from\nthe city every Saturday, to bring the children home, to remain until the\nfollowing Monday morning. Upon one occasion, when the messenger arrived\nat the school he found all things in commotion. Johnny Kinzie was\nmissing! Search was made in all directions; every place was ransacked.\nIt was all in vain; no Johnny Kinzie could be found.",
        "The heavy tidings were carried home to his mother. By some it was\nsupposed the lad was drowned; by others that he had strayed away, and\nwould return. Weeks passed by, and months, and he was at length given up\nand mourned as lost. In the mean time the boy was fulfilling a\ndetermination he had long formed, to visit his native city of Quebec,\nand make his way in life for himself.",
        "He had by some means succeeded in crossing from Williamsburg to the city\nof New York, and finding at one of the docks on the North River a sloop\nbound for Albany, he took passage on board of her. While on his way up\nthe river, he was noticed by a gentleman, who, taking an interest in the\nlittle lonely passenger, questioned him about his business.",
        "“He was going to Quebec, where he had some friends.”",
        "“Had he the means to carry him there?”",
        "“Not much, but he thought he could get along.”",
        "It happened, fortunately, that the gentleman himself was going to\nQuebec. He took the boy under his care, paid his expenses the whole\ndistance, and finally parted with him in the streets of the city, where\nhe was, in truth, a stranger.",
        "He wandered about for a time, looking into various “stores” and\nworkshops. At length, on entering the shop of a silversmith, he was\nsatisfied with the expression he read in the countenance of the master,\nand he inquired if he wanted an apprentice.",
        "“What, you, my little fellow! What can you do?”",
        "“Anything you can teach me.”",
        "“Well, we will make a trial and see.”",
        "The trial was satisfactory. He remained in the family of his kind\nfriend for more than three years, when his parents, who, in removing to\nDetroit, had necessarily returned to Canada, discovered his place of\nabode, and he was restored to them.",
        "There were five younger half-brothers, of the name of Forsyth. In the\nold family Bible, we find the following touching record of an event that\noccurred after the family had removed to Detroit:–",
        "“George Forsyth was lost in the woods 6th August, 1775, when Henry Hays\nand Mark Stirling ran away and left him. The remains of George Forsyth\nwere found by an Indian the 2d of October, 1776, close by the Prairie\nRonde.”",
        "It seems a singular fatality that the unhappy mother should have been\ntwice called to suffer a similar affliction–the loss of a child in a\nmanner worse than death, inasmuch as it left room for all the horrors\nthat imagination can suggest. The particulars of the loss of this little\nbrother were these. As he came from school one evening, he met the\ncolored servant-boy on horseback, going to the common for the cows. The\nschool-house stood quite near the old fort, and all beyond that, towards\nthe west, was a wild, uncultivated tract called “the Common.” The child\nbegged of the servant to take him up and give him a ride, but the other\nrefused, bidding him return home at once. He was accompanied by two\nother boys, somewhat older, and together they followed the negro for\nsome distance, hoping to prevail upon him to give them a ride. As it\ngrew dark, the two older boys turned back, but the other kept on. When\nthe negro returned he had not again seen the child, nor were any tidings\never received of him, notwithstanding the diligent search made by the\nwhole little community, until, as related in the record, his remains\nwere found the following year by an Indian. There was nothing to\nidentify them, except the auburn curls of his hair, and the little boots\nhe had worn. He must have perished very shortly after having lost his\nway, for the Prairie Ronde was too near the settlement to have prevented\nhis bearing the calls and sounding horns of those in search of him, had\nhe been living.",
        "Mr. Kinzie’s enterprising and adventurous disposition led him, as he\ngrew older, to live much on the frontier. He early entered into the\nIndian trade, and had establishments at Sandusky and Maumee. About the\nyear 1800 he pushed farther west, to St. Joseph’s, Michigan. In this\nyear he married Mrs. McKillip, the widow of a British officer, and in\n1804 came to make his home at Chicago. It was in this year that the\nfirst fort was built by Major John Whistler.",
        "By degrees more remote trading-posts were established by him, all\ncontributing to the parent one at Chicago; at Milwaukie with the\nMenomonees; at Rock River with the Winnebagoes and the Pottowattamies;\non the Illinois River and Kankakee with the Pottowattamies of the\nPrairies, and with the Kickapoos in what was called ’Le Large,” being\nthe widely extended district afterwards erected into Sangamon County.",
        "Each trading-post had its superintendent, and its complement of\nengagés–its train of pack-horses and its equipment of boats and canoes.\nFrom most of the stations the furs and peltries were brought to Chicago\non pack-horses, and the goods necessary for the trade were transported\nin return by the same method.",
        "The vessels which came in the spring and fall (seldom more than two or\nthree annually), to bring the supplies and goods for the trade, took the\nfurs that were already collected to Mackinac, the depôt of the Southwest\nand American Fur Companies. At other seasons they were sent to that\nplace in boats, coasting around the lake.",
        "Of the Canadian voyageurs or engagés, a race that has now so nearly\npassed away, some notice may very properly here be given.",
        "They were unlike any other class of men. Like the poet, they seemed born\nto their vocation. Sturdy, enduring, ingenious, and light-hearted, they\npossessed a spirit capable of adapting itself to any emergency. No\ndifficulties baffled, no hardships discouraged them; while their\naffectionate nature led them to form attachments of the warmest\ncharacter to their “bourgeois,” or master, as well as to the native\ninhabitants, among whom their engagements carried them.",
        "Montreal, or, according to their own pronunciation, Marrialle, was\ntheir depôt. It was at that place that the agents commissioned to make\nup the quota for the different companies and traders found the material\nfor their selections.",
        "The terms of engagement were usually from four to six hundred livres\n(ancient Quebec currency) per annum as wages, with rations of one quart\nof lyed corn, and two ounces of tallow per diem, or “its equivalent in\nwhatever sort of food is to be found in the Indian country.” Instances\nhave been known of their submitting cheerfully to fare upon fresh fish\nand maple-sugar for a whole winter, when cut off from other supplies.",
        "It was a common saying, “Keep an engagé to his corn and tallow, he will\nserve you well–give him pork and bread, and he soon gets beyond your\nmanagement.” They regard the terms of their engagement as binding to the\nletter. An old trader, M. Berthelet, engaged a crew at Montreal. The\nterms of agreement were, that they should eat when their bourgeois did,\nand what he did. It was a piece of fun on the part of the old gentleman,\nbut the simple Canadians believed it to be a signal instance of good\nluck that had provided them such luxurious prospects. The bourgeois\nstuffed his pockets with crackers, and, when sure of being quite\nunobserved, would slily eat one. Pipe after pipe passed–the men grew\nhungry, but, observing that there were no preparations of a meal for the\nbourgeois, they bore their fast without complaining.",
        "At length the matter became too serious–they could stand it no longer.\nIn their distress they begged off from the bargain, and gladly\ncompounded to take the customary rations, instead of the dainty fare\nthey had been promising themselves with their master.",
        "On arriving at Mackinac, which was the entrepôt of the fur trade, a\nsmall proportion of the voyageur’s wages was advanced him, to furnish\nhis winter’s outfit, his pipes and tobacco, his needles and thread, some\npieces of bright-colored ribbons, and red and yellow gartering (quality\nbinding), with which to purchase their little necessaries from the\nIndians. To these, if his destination were Lake Superior, or a post far\nto the north where such articles could not be readily obtained, were\nadded one or two smoked deer-skins for moccasins.",
        "Thus equipped, he entered upon his three years’ service, to toil by day,\nand laugh, joke, sing, and tell stories when the evening hour brought\nrest and liberty.",
        "There was not wanting here and there an instance of obstinate adherence\nto the exact letter of the agreement in regard to the nature of\nemployment, although, as a general thing, the engagé held himself ready\nto fulfil the behests of his bourgeois, as faithfully as ever did vassal\nthose of his chief.",
        "A Story is told of M. St. Jean, a trader on the Upper Mississippi, who\nupon a certain occasion ordered one of his Frenchmen to accompany a\nparty to the forest to chop wood. The man refused. “He was not hired,\"\nhe said, “to chop wood.”",
        "“Ah! for what, then, were you hired?”",
        "“To steer a boat.”",
        "“Very well; steer a boat, then, since you prefer it.”",
        "It was mid-winter. The recusant was marched to the river-side, and\nplaced in the stern of the boat, which lay fastened in the ice.",
        "After serving a couple of hours at his legitimate employment, with the\nthermometer below zero, he was quite content to take his place with the\nchopping-party, and never again thought it good policy to choose work\nfor himself.",
        "There is an aristocracy in the voyageur service which is quite amusing.\nThe engagement is usually made for three years. The engagé of the first\nyear, who is called a ’mangeur-de-lard,” or pork-eater, is looked down\nupon with the most sovereign contempt by an ’hivernant,” or one who\nhas already passed a winter in the country. He will not only not\nassociate with him, but if invited by him to join him in a friendly\nglass, he will make some excuse for declining. The most inveterate\ndrunkard, while tortured by a longing to partake his favorite\nindulgence, will yet never suffer himself to be enticed into an\ninfringement of this custom.",
        "After the first winter, the mangeur-de-lard rises from his freshman\nclass, and takes his place where he can in turn lord it over all\nnew-comers.",
        "Another peculiarity of the voyageurs is their fancy for transforming the\nnames of their bourgeois into something funny, which resembles it in\nsound. Thus, Kinzie would be called by one ’Quinze nez” (fifteen\nnoses), by another ’Singé” (monkeyfied). Mr. Kercheval was denominated\nMons. Court-cheval (short horse), the Judge of Probate, ’le Juge\nTrop-bête” (too foolish), etc. The following is an instance in point.",
        "Mr. Shaw, one of the agents of the Northwest Fur Company, had passed\nmany years on the frontier, and was by the voyageurs called Monsieur Le\nChat.[28] On quitting the Indian country he married a Canadian lady and\nbecame the father of several children. Some years after his return to\nCanada, his old foreman, named Louis la Liberté, went to Montreal to\nspend the winter. He had heard of his old bourgeois’ marriage, and was\nanxious to see him.",
        "Mr. Shaw was walking in the Champ de Mars with a couple of officers,\nwhen La Liberté espied him. He immediately ran up, and, seizing him by\nboth hands, accosted him,–",
        "“Ah! mon cher Monsieur le Chat: comment vous portez-vous?” (My dear\nMr. Cat, how do you do?)",
        "“Très-bien, Louizon.”",
        "“Et comment se porte Madame la Chatte?” (How is the mother cat?)",
        "“Bien, bien, Louizon; elle est très-bien” (She is very well.)",
        "“Et tous les petits Chatons?” (And all the kittens?)",
        "This was too much for Mr. Shaw. He answered shortly that the kittens\nwere all well, and turned away with his military friends, leaving poor\nLouizon quite astonished at the abruptness of his departure.",
        "Cut off, in the manner described, from the world at large, with no\nsociety but the military, thus lived the family of Mr. Kinzie, in great\ncontentment, and in the enjoyment of all the comforts, together with\nmost of the luxuries, of life.",
        "The Indians reciprocated the friendship that was shown them, and formed\nfor them an attachment of no ordinary strength, as was manifested during\nthe scenes of the year 1812, eight years after Mr. Kinzie first came to\nlive among them.",
        "Some of the most prominent events of that year are recorded in the\nfollowing Narrative.",
        "It was the evening of the 7th of April, 1812. The children of Mr. Kinzie\nwere dancing before the fire to the music of their father’s violin. The\ntea-table was spread, and they were awaiting the return of their mother,\nwho had gone to visit a sick neighbor about a quarter of a mile up the\nriver.",
        "Suddenly their sports were interrupted. The door was thrown open, and\nMrs. Kinzie rushed in, pale with terror, and scarcely able to\narticulate, “The Indians! the Indians!”",
        "“The Indians? What? Where?” eagerly demanded they all.",
        "“Up at Lee’s Place, killing and scalping!”",
        "With difficulty Mrs. Kinzie composed herself sufficiently to give the\ninformation, “That, while she was up at Burns’s, a man and a boy were\nseen running down with all speed on the opposite side of the river; that\nthey had called across to give notice to Barns’s family to save\nthemselves, for the Indians were at Lee’s Place, from which they had\njust made their escape. Having given this terrifying news, they had made\nall speed for the fort, which was on the same side of the river that\nthey then were.”",
        "All was now consternation and dismay. The family were hurried into two\nold pirogues, that lay moored near the house, and paddled with all\npossible haste across the river to take refuge in the fort.",
        "All that the man and boy who had made their escape were able to tell,\nwas soon known; but, in order to render their story more intelligible,\nit is necessary to describe the scene of action.",
        "Lee’s Place, since known by the name of Hardscrabble, was a farm\nintersected by the Chicago River, about four miles from its mouth. The\nfarm-house stood on the western bank of the south branch of this river.\nOn the north side of the main stream, but quite near its junction with\nLake Michigan, stood (as has already been described) the dwelling-house\nand trading-establishment of Mr. Kinzie.",
        "The fort was situated on the southern bank, directly opposite this\nmansion–the river, and a few rods of sloping green turf on either side,\nbeing all that intervened between them.",
        "The fort was differently constructed from the one erected on the same\nsite in 1816. It had two block-houses on the southern side, and on the\nnorthern a sally-port, or subterranean passage from the parade-ground to\nthe river. This was designed either to facilitate escape in case of an\nemergency, or as a means of supplying the garrison with water during a\nsiege.",
        "The officers in the fort at this period were Captain Heald, the\ncommanding officer, Lieutenant Helm, the son-in-law of Mr. Kinzie, and\nEnsign Ronan–the two last were very young men–and the surgeon, Dr. Van\nVoorhees.",
        "The command numbered about seventy-five men; very few of whom were\neffective.",
        "A constant and friendly intercourse had been maintained between these\ntroops and the Indians. It is true that the principal men of the\nPottowattamie nation, like those of most other tribes, went yearly to\nFort Malden, in Canada, to receive a large amount of presents, with\nwhich the British Government had, for many years, been in the habit of\npurchasing their alliance; and it was well known that many of the\nPottowattamies, as well as Winnebagoes, had been engaged with the\nOttawas and Shawnees at the battle of Tippecanoe, the preceding autumn;\nyet, as the principal chiefs of all the bands in the neighborhood\nappeared to be on the most amicable terms with the Americans, no\ninterruption of their harmony was at any time anticipated.",
        "After the 15th of August, however, many circumstances were recollected\nthat might have opened the eyes of the whites, had they not been lulled\nin a fatal security. One instance in particular may be mentioned.",
        "In the spring preceding the destruction of the fort, two Indians of the\nCalumet band came to the fort on a visit to the commanding officer. As\nthey passed through the quarters, they saw Mrs. Heald and Mrs. Helm\nplaying at battledoor.",
        "Turning to the interpreter, one of them, Nau-non-gee, remarked, “The\nwhite chiefs’ wives are amusing themselves very much; it will not be\nlong before they are hoeing in our corn-fields!”",
        "This was considered at the time an idle threat, or, at most, an\nebullition of jealous feeling at the contrast between the situation of\ntheir own women and that of the “white chiefs’ wives.” Some months\nafter, how bitterly was it remembered!",
        "The farm at Lee’s Place was occupied by a Mr. White and three persons\nemployed by him in the care of the farm.",
        "In the afternoon of the day on which our narrative commences, a party of\nten or twelve Indians, dressed and painted, arrived at the house, and,\naccording to the custom among savages, entered and seated themselves\nwithout ceremony.",
        "Something in their appearance and manner excited the suspicions of one\nof the family, a Frenchman, who remarked, “I do not like the appearance\nof these Indians–they are none of our folks. I know by their dress and\npaint that they are not Pottowattamies.”",
        "Another of the family, a discharged soldier, then said to the boy who\nwas present, “If that is the case, we had better get away from them if\nwe can. Say nothing; but do as you see me do.”",
        "As the afternoon was far advanced, the soldier walked leisurely towards\nthe canoes, of which there were two tied near the bank. Some of the\nIndians inquired where he was going. He pointed to the cattle which were\nstanding among the haystacks on the opposite bank, and made signs that\nthey must go and fodder them, and then they should return and get their\nsupper.",
        "He got into one canoe, and the boy into the other. The stream was\nnarrow, and they were soon across. When they had gained the opposite\nside, they pulled some hay for the cattle–made a show of collecting\nthem–and when they had gradually made a circuit, so that their\nmovements were concealed by the haystacks, they took to the woods, which\nwere close at hand, and made for the fort.",
        "They had run about a quarter of a mile, when they heard the discharge of\ntwo guns successively, which they supposed to have been levelled at the\ncompanions they had left behind.",
        "They stopped not nor stayed until they arrived opposite Burns’s,[30]\nwhere, as before related, they called across to advertise the family of\ntheir danger, and then hastened on to the fort.",
        "It now occurred to those who had secured their own safety, that the\nfamily of Burns was at this moment exposed to the most imminent peril.\nThe question was, who would hazard his own life to bring them to a place\nof safety? A gallant young officer, Ensign Ronan, volunteered, with a\nparty of five or six soldiers, to go to their rescue.",
        "They ascended the river in a scow, and took the mother, with her infant\nof scarcely a day old, upon her bed to the boat, in which they carefully\nconveyed her and the other members of the family to the fort.",
        "A party of soldiers, consisting of a corporal and six men, had that\nafternoon obtained leave to go up the river to fish.",
        "They had not returned when the fugitives from Lee’s Place arrived at\nthe fort, and, fearing that they might encounter the Indians, the\ncommanding officer ordered a cannon to be fired, to warn them of danger.",
        "They were at the time about two miles above Lee’s Place. Hearing the\nsignal, they took the hint, put out their torches (for it was now\nnight), and dropped down the river towards the garrison, as silently as\npossible. It will be remembered that the unsettled state of the country\nsince the battle of Tippecanoe, the preceding November, had rendered\nevery man vigilant, and the slightest alarm was an admonition to “beware\nof the Indians.”",
        "When the fishing-party reached Lee’s Place, it was proposed to stop and\nwarn the inmates to be upon their guard, as the signal from the fort\nindicated danger of some kind. All was still as death around the house.\nThey groped their way along, and as the corporal jumped over the small\nenclosure he placed his hand upon the dead body of a man. By the sense\nof touch he soon ascertained that the head was without a scalp, and\notherwise mutilated. The faithful dog of the murdered man stood guarding\nthe lifeless remains of his master.",
        "The tale was now told. The men retreated to their canoes, and reached\nthe fort unmolested about eleven o’clock at night. The next morning a\nparty of the citizens and soldiers volunteered to go to Lee’s Place, to\nlearn further the fate of its occupants. The body of Mr. White was found\npierced by two balls, and with eleven stabs in the breast. The\nFrenchman, as already described, lay dead, with his dog still beside\nhim. Their bodies were brought to the fort and buried in its immediate\nvicinity.",
        "It was subsequently ascertained, from traders out in the Indian country,\nthat the perpetrators of this bloody deed were a party of Winnebagoes,\nwho had come into this neighborhood to “take some white scalps.” Their\nplan had been, to proceed down the river from Lee’s Place, and kill\nevery white man without the walls of the fort. Hearing, however, the\nreport of the cannon, and not knowing what it portended, they thought it\nbest to remain satisfied with this one exploit, and forthwith retreated\nto their homes on Rock River.",
        "The inhabitants outside the fort, consisting of a few discharged\nsoldiers and some families of half-breeds, now intrenched themselves in\nthe Agency House. This stood west of the fort, between the pickets and\nthe river, and distant about twenty rods from the former.",
        "It was an old-fashioned log building, with a hall running through the\ncentre, and one large room on each side. Piazzas extended the whole\nlength of the building in front and rear. These were planked up, for\ngreater security, port-holes were cut, and sentinels posted at night.",
        "As the enemy were believed to be lurking still in the neighborhood, or,\nemboldened by former success, likely to return at any moment, an order\nwas issued prohibiting any soldier or citizen from leaving the vicinity\nof the garrison without a guard.",
        "One night a sergeant and private, who were out on a patrol, came\nsuddenly upon a party of Indians in the pasture adjoining the esplanade.\nThe sergeant fired his piece, and both retreated towards the fort.\nBefore they could reach it, an Indian threw his tomahawk, which missed\nthe sergeant and struck a wagon standing near. The sentinel from the\nblock-house immediately fired, and with effect, while the men got safely\nin. The next morning it was ascertained, from traces of blood to a\nconsiderable distance into the prairie, and from the appearance of a\nbody having been laid among the long grass, that some execution had been\ndone.",
        "On another occasion the enemy entered the esplanade to steal horses.\nNot finding them in the stable, as they had expected, they made\nthemselves amends for their disappointment by stabbing all the sheep in\nthe stable and then letting them loose. The poor animals flocked towards\nthe fort. This gave the alarm–the garrison was aroused–parties were\nsent out, but the marauders escaped unmolested.",
        "The inmates of the fort experienced no farther alarm for many weeks.",
        "On the afternoon of the 7th of August, Winnemeg, or Catfish, a\nPottowattamie chief, arrived at the post, bringing despatches from\nGeneral Hull. These announced the declaration of war between the United\nStates and Great Britain, and that General Hull, at the head of the\nNorthwestern army, had arrived at Detroit; also, that the island of\nMackinac had fallen into the hands of the British.",
        "The orders to Captain Heald were, “to evacuate the fort, if practicable,\nand, in that event, to distribute all the United States’ property\ncontained in the fort, and in the United States’ factory or agency,\namong the Indians in the neighborhood.”",
        "After having delivered his despatches, Winnemeg requested a private\ninterview with Mr. Kinzie, who had taken up his residence in the fort.\nHe stated to Mr. K. that he was acquainted with the purport of the\ncommunications he had brought, and begged him to ascertain if it were\nthe intention of Captain Heald to evacuate the post. He advised strongly\nagainst such a step, inasmuch as the garrison was well supplied with\nammunition, and with provisions for six months. It would, therefore, be\nfar better, he thought, to remain until a reinforcement could be sent to\ntheir assistance. If, however, Captain Heald should decide upon leaving\nthe post, it should by all means be done immediately. The\nPottowattamies, through whose country they must pass, being ignorant of\nthe object of Winnemeg’s mission, a forced march might be made, before\nthose who were hostile in their feelings were prepared to interrupt\nthem.",
        "Of this advice, so earnestly given, Captain Heald was immediately\ninformed. He replied that it was his intention to evacuate the post, but\nthat, inasmuch as he had received orders to distribute the United\nStates’ property, he should not feel justified in leaving it until he\nhad collected the Indians of the neighborhood and made an equitable\ndivision among them.",
        "Winnemeg then suggested the expediency of marching out, and leaving all\nthings standing–possibly while the Indians were engaged in the\npartition of the spoils, the troops might effect their retreat\nunmolested. This advice was strongly seconded by Mr. Kinzie, but did not\nmeet the approbation of the commanding officer.",
        "The order for evacuating the post was read next morning upon parade. It\nis difficult to understand why Captain Heald, in such an emergency,\nomitted the usual form of calling a council of war with his officers. It\ncan only be accounted for by the fact of a want of harmonious feeling\nbetween himself and one of his junior officers–Ensign Ronan, a\nhigh-spirited and somewhat overbearing, but brave and generous young\nman.",
        "In the course of the day, finding that no council was called, the\nofficers waited on Captain Heald to be informed what course he intended\nto pursue. When they learned his intentions, they remonstrated with him,\non the following grounds:",
        "First–It was highly improbable that the command would be permitted to\npass through the country in safety to Fort Wayne. For although it had\nbeen said that some of the chiefs had opposed an attack upon the fort,\nplanned the preceding autumn, yet it was well known that they had been\nactuated in that matter by motives of private regard to one family, that\nof Mr. Kinzie, and not to any general friendly feeling towards the\nAmericans; and that, at any rate, it was hardly to be expected that\nthese few individuals would be able to control the whole tribe, who were\nthirsting for blood.",
        "In the next place–Their march must necessarily be slow, as their\nmovements must be accommodated to the helplessness of the women and\nchildren, of whom there were a number with the detachment. That of their\nsmall force, some of the soldiers were superannuated, others invalid;\ntherefore, since the course to be pursued was left discretional, their\nunanimous advice was, to remain where they were, and fortify themselves\nas strongly as possible. Succors from the other side of the peninsula\nmight arrive before they could be attacked by the British from Mackinac;\nand even should they not, it were far better to fall into the hands of\nthe latter than to become the victims of the savages.",
        "Captain Heald argued in reply, that a special order had been issued by\nthe War Department, that no post should be surrendered without battle\nhaving been given, and his force was totally inadequate to an engagement\nwith the Indians; that he should unquestionably be censured for\nremaining, when there appeared a prospect of a safe march through; and\nthat, upon the whole, he deemed it expedient to assemble the Indians,\ndistribute the property among them, and then ask of them an escort to\nFort Wayne, with the promise of a considerable reward upon their safe\narrival–adding, that he had full confidence in the friendly professions\nof the Indians, from whom, as well as from the soldiers, the capture of\nMackinac had been kept a profound secret.",
        "From this time the officers held themselves aloof, and spoke but little\nupon the subject, though they considered the project of Captain Heald\nlittle short of madness. The dissatisfaction among the soldiers hourly\nincreased, until it reached a high pitch of insubordination.",
        "Upon one occasion, as Captain Heald was conversing with Mr. Kinzie upon\nthe parade, he remarked, “I could not remain, even if I thought it best,\nfor I have but a small store of provisions.”",
        "“Why, captain,” said a soldier who stood near, forgetting all etiquette\nin the excitement of the moment, “you have cattle enough to last the\ntroops six months.”",
        "“But,” replied Captain Heald, “I have no salt to preserve it with.”",
        "“Then jerk[31] it,” said the man, “as the Indians do their venison.”",
        "The Indians now became daily more unruly. Entering the fort in defiance\nof the sentinels, they made their way without ceremony into the\nofficers’ quarters. On one occasion an Indian took up a rifle and fired\nit in the parlor of the commanding officer, as an expression of\ndefiance. Some were of opinion that this was intended among the young\nmen as a signal for an attack. The old chiefs passed backwards and\nforwards among the assembled groups, with the appearance of the most\nlively agitation, while the squaws rushed to and fro, in great\nexcitement, and evidently prepared for some fearful scene.",
        "Any further manifestation of ill feeling was, however, suppressed for\nthe present, and Captain Heald, strange as it may seem, continued to\nentertain a conviction of having created so amicable a disposition among\nthe Indians as would insure the safety of the command on their march to\nFort Wayne.",
        "Thus passed the time until the 12th of August. The feelings of the\ninmates of the fort during this time may be better imagined than\ndescribed. Each morning that dawned seemed to bring them nearer to that\nmost appalling fate–butchery by a savage foe–and at night they\nscarcely dared yield to slumber, lest they should be aroused by the\nwar-whoop and tomahawk. Gloom and mistrust prevailed, and the want of\nunanimity among the officers debarred them the consolation they might\nhave found in mutual sympathy and encouragement.",
        "The Indians being assembled from the neighboring villages, a council was\nheld with them on the afternoon of the 12th. Captain Heald alone\nattended on the part of the military. He requested his officers to\naccompany him, but they declined. They had been secretly informed that\nit was the intention of the young chiefs to fall upon the officers and\nmassacre them while in council, but they could not persuade Captain\nHeald of the truth of their information. They waited therefore only\nuntil he had left the garrison, accompanied by Mr. Kinzie, when they\ntook command of the block-houses which overlooked the esplanade on which\nthe council was held, opened the port-holes, and pointed the cannon so\nas to command the whole assembly. By this means, probably, the lives of\nthe whites who were present in council were preserved.",
        "In council, the commanding officer informed the Indians that it was his\nintention to distribute among them, the next day, not only the goods\nlodged in the United States’ factory, but also the ammunition and\nprovisions, with Which the garrison was well supplied. He then\nrequested of the Pottowattamies an escort to Fort Wayne, promising them\na liberal reward on arriving there, in addition to the presents they\nwere now about to receive. With many professions of friendship and good\nwill, the savages assented to all be proposed, and promised all he\nrequired.",
        "After the council, Mr. Kinzie, who understood well, not only the Indian\ncharacter, but the present tone of feeling among them, had a long\ninterview with Captain Heald, in hopes of opening his eyes to the\npresent posture of affairs.",
        "He reminded him that since the troubles with the Indians upon the Wabash\nand its vicinity, there had appeared a settled plan of hostilities\ntowards the whites, in consequence of which it had been the policy of\nthe Americans to withhold from them whatever would enable them to carry\non their warfare upon the defenceless inhabitants of the frontier.",
        "Mr. Kinzie also recalled to Captain Heald how that, having left home for\nDetroit, the preceding autumn, on receiving, when he had proceeded as\nfar as De Charme’s,[32] the intelligence of the battle of Tippecanoe, he\nhad immediately returned to Chicago, that he might dispatch orders to\nhis traders to furnish no ammunition to the Indians; in consequence of\nwhich all they had on hand was secreted, and such of the traders as had\nnot already started for their wintering-grounds, took neither powder nor\nshot with them.",
        "Captain Heald was struck with the impolicy of furnishing the enemy (for\nsuch they must now consider their old neighbors) with arms against\nhimself, and determined to destroy all the ammunition except what should\nbe necessary for the use of his own troops.",
        "On the 13th, the goods, consisting of blankets, broadcloths, calicoes,\npaints, etc., were distributed, as stipulated. The same evening the\nammunition and liquor were carried, part into the sally-port, and thrown\ninto a well which had been dug there to supply the garrison with water\nin case of emergency; the remainder was transported as secretly as\npossible through the northern gate, the heads of the barrels knocked in,\nand the contents poured into the river.",
        "The same fate was shared by a large quantity of alcohol belonging to Mr.\nKinzie, which had been deposited in a warehouse near his residence\nopposite the fort.",
        "The Indians suspected what was going on, and crept, serpent-like, as\nnear the scene of action as possible, but a vigilant watch was kept up,\nand no one was suffered to approach but those engaged in the affair. All\nthe muskets not necessary for the command on the march were broken up\nand thrown into the well, together with the bags of shot, flints,\ngunscrews, and, in short, everything relating to weapons of offence.",
        "Some relief to the general feeling of despondency was afforded, by the\narrival, on the 14th of August, of Captain Wells[33] with fifteen\nfriendly Miamis.",
        "Of this brave man, who forms so conspicuous a figure in our frontier\nannals, it is unnecessary here to say more than that he had been\nresiding from his boyhood among the Indians, and consequently possessed\na perfect knowledge of their character and habits.",
        "He had heard, at Fort Wayne, of the order for evacuating the fort at\nChicago, and, knowing the hostile determination of the Pottowattamies,\nhe had made a rapid march across the country, to prevent the exposure\nof his relative, Captain Heald, and his troops, to certain destruction.",
        "But he came “all too late.” When he reached the post he found that the\nammunition had been destroyed, and the provisions given to the Indians.\nThere was, therefore, now no alternative, and every preparation was made\nfor the march of the troops on the following morning.",
        "On the afternoon of the same day, a second council was held with the\nIndians. They expressed great indignation at the destruction of the\nammunition and liquor.",
        "Notwithstanding the precautions that had been taken to preserve secrecy,\nthe noise of knocking in the heads of the barrels had betrayed the\noperations of the preceding night; indeed, so great was the quantity of\nliquor thrown into the river, that the taste of the water the next\nmorning was, as one expressed it, “strong grog.”",
        "Murmurs and threats were everywhere heard among the savages. It was\nevident that the first moment of exposure would subject the troops to\nsome manifestation of their disappointment and resentment.",
        "Among the chiefs were several who, although they shared the general\nhostile feeling of their tribe towards the Americans, yet retained a\npersonal regard for the troops at this post, and for the few white\ncitizens of the place. These chiefs exerted their utmost influence to\nallay the revengeful feelings of the young men, and to avert their\nsanguinary designs, but without effect.",
        "On the evening succeeding the council, Black Partridge, a conspicuous\nchief, entered the quarters of the commanding officer.",
        "“Father,” said he, “I come to deliver up to you the medal I wear. It was\ngiven me by the Americans, and I have long worn it in token of our\nmutual friendship. But our young men are resolved to imbrue their hands\nin the blood of the whites. I cannot restrain them, and I will not wear\na token of peace while I am compelled to act as an enemy.”",
        "Had further evidence been wanting, this circumstance would have\nsufficiently proved to the devoted band the justice of their melancholy\nanticipations. Nevertheless, they went steadily on with the necessary\npreparations; and, amid the horrors of their situation, there were not\nwanting gallant hearts, who strove to encourage, in their desponding\ncompanions, the hopes of escape they were far from indulging themselves.",
        "Of the ammunition there had been reserved but twenty-five rounds,\nbesides one box of cartridges, contained in the baggage-wagons. This\nmust, under any circumstances of danger, have proved an inadequate\nsupply; but the prospect of a fatiguing march, in their present\nineffective state, forbade the troops embarrassing themselves with a\nlarger quantity.",
        "The morning of the 15th arrived. All things were in readiness, and nine\no’clock was the hour named for starting.",
        "Mr. Kinzie, having volunteered to accompany the troops in their march,\nhad intrusted his family to the care of some friendly Indians, who\npromised to convey them in a boat around the head of Lake Michigan to a\npoint[34] on the St. Joseph’s River, there to be joined by the troops,\nshould the prosecution of their march be permitted them.",
        "Early in the morning Mr. Kinzie received a message from To-pee-nee-bee,\na chief of the St. Joseph’s band, informing him that mischief was\nintended by the Pottowattamies who had engaged to escort the detachment,\nand urging him to relinquish his design of accompanying the troops by\nland, promising him that the boat containing himself and family should\nbe permitted to pass in safety to St. Joseph’s.",
        "Mr. Kinzie declined acceding to this proposal, as he believed that his\npresence might operate as a restraint upon the fury of the savages, so\nwarmly were the greater part of them attached to himself and his family.",
        "The party in the boat consisted of Mrs. Kinzie and her four younger\nchildren, their nurse Josette, a clerk of Mr. Kinzie’s, two servants and\nthe boatmen, besides the two Indians who acted as their protectors. The\nboat started, but had scarcely reached the mouth of the river, which, it\nwill be recollected, was here half a mile below the fort, when another\nmessenger from To-pee-nee-bee arrived to detain them where they were.\nThere was no mistaking the reason of this detention.",
        "In breathless anxiety sat the wife and mother. She was a woman of\nuncommon energy and strength of character, yet her heart died within her\nas she folded her arms around her helpless infants, and gazed upon the\nmarch of her husband and eldest child to certain destruction.",
        "As the troops left the fort, the band struck up the Dead March. On they\ncame, in military array, but with solemn mien. Captain Wells took the\nlead at the head of his little band of Miamis. He had blackened his face\nbefore leaving the garrison, in token of his impending fate. They took\ntheir route along the lake shore. When they reached the point where\ncommenced a range of sand-hills intervening between the prairie and the\nbeach, the escort of Pottowattamies, in number about five hundred, kept\nthe level of the prairie, instead of continuing along the beach with the\nAmericans and Miamis.",
        "They had marched perhaps a mile and a half, when Captain Wells, who had\nkept somewhat in advance with his Miamis, came riding furiously back.",
        "“They are about to attack us,” shouted he; “form instantly, and charge\nupon them.”",
        "Scarcely were the words uttered, when a volley was showered from among\nthe sand-hills. The troops were hastily brought into line, and charged\nup the bank. One man, a veteran of seventy winters, fell as they\nascended. The remainder of the scene is best described in the words of\nan eye-witness and participator in the tragedy, Mrs. Helm, the wife of\nCaptain (then Lieutenant) Helm, and step-daughter of Mr. Kinzie.",
        "“After we had left the bank the firing became general. The Miamis fled\nat the outset. Their chief rode up to the Pottowattamies, and said:",
        "“’You have deceived the Americans and us. You have done a bad action,\nand (brandishing his tomahawk) I will be the first to head a party of\nAmericans to return and punish your treachery.’ So saying, he galloped\nafter his companions, who were now scouring across the prairies.",
        "“The troops behaved most gallantly. They were but a handful, but they\nseemed resolved to sell their lives as dearly as possible. Our horses\npranced and bounded, and could hardly be restrained as the balls\nwhistled among them. I drew off a little, and gazed upon my husband and\nfather, who were yet unharmed. I felt that my hour was come, and\nendeavored to forget those I loved, and prepare myself for my\napproaching fate.",
        "“While I was thus engaged, the surgeon, Dr. Van Voorhees, came up. He\nwas badly wounded. His horse had been shot under him, and he had\nreceived a ball in his leg. Every muscle of his face was quivering with\nthe agony of terror. He said to me, ’Do you think they will take our\nlives? I am badly wounded, but I think not mortally. Perhaps we might\npurchase our lives by promising them a large reward. Do you think there\nis any chance?’",
        "“’Dr. Van Voorhees,’ said I, ’do not let us waste the few moments that\nyet remain to us in such vain hopes. Our fate is inevitable. In a few\nmoments we must appear before the bar of God. Let us make what\npreparation is yet in our power.’",
        "“’Oh, I cannot die!’ exclaimed he, ’I am not fit to die–if I had but a\nshort time to prepare–death is awful!’",
        "“I pointed to Ensign Ronan, who, though mortally wounded and nearly\ndown, was still fighting with desperation on one knee.[35]",
        "“’Look at that man!’ said I. ’At least he dies like a soldier.’",
        "“’Yes,’ replied the unfortunate man, with a convulsive gasp, ’but he has\nno terrors of the future–he is an unbeliever!’",
        "“At this moment a young Indian raised his tomahawk at me. By springing\naside, I partially avoided the blow, which was intended for my skull,\nbut which alighted on my shoulder. I seized him around the neck, and\nwhile exerting my utmost efforts to get possession of his\nscalping-knife, which hung in a scabbard over his breast, I was dragged\nfrom his grasp by another and older Indian.",
        "“The latter bore me struggling and resisting towards the lake.\nNotwithstanding the rapidity with which I was harried along, I\nrecognized, as I passed them, the lifeless remains of the unfortunate\nsurgeon. Some murderous tomahawk had stretched him upon the very spot\nwhere I had last seen him.",
        "“I was immediately plunged into the water and held there with a forcible\nhand, notwithstanding my resistance. I soon perceived, however, that the\nobject of my captor was not to drown me, for he held me firmly in such a\nposition as to place my head above water. This reassured me, and,\nregarding him attentively, I soon recognized, in spite of the paint with\nwhich he was disguised, The Black Partridge.",
        "“When the firing had nearly subsided, my preserver bore me from the\nwater and conducted me up the sand-banks. It was a burning August\nmorning, and walking through the sand in my drenched condition was\ninexpressibly painful and fatiguing. I stooped and took off my shoes to\nfree them from the sand with which they were nearly filled, when a squaw\nseized and carried them off, and I was obliged to proceed without them.",
        "“When we had gained the prairie, I was met by my father, who told me\nthat my husband was safe and but slightly wounded. They led me gently\nback towards the Chicago River, along the southern bank of which was the\nPottowattamie encampment. At one time I was placed upon a horse without\na saddle, but, finding the motion insupportable, I sprang off. Supported\npartly by my kind conductor, Black Partridge, and partly by another\nIndian, Pee-so-tum, who held dangling in his hand a scalp, which by the\nblack ribbon around the queue I recognized as that of Captain Wells, I\ndragged my fainting steps to one of the wigwams.",
        "“The wife of Wau-bee-nee-mah, a chief from the Illinois River, was\nstanding near, and, seeing my exhausted condition, she seized a kettle,\ndipped up some water from a stream that flowed near,[36] threw into it\nsome maple-sugar, and, stirring it up with her hand, gave it me to\ndrink. This act of kindness, in the midst of so many horrors, touched me\nmost sensibly; but my attention was soon diverted to other objects.",
        "“The fort had become a scene of plunder to such as remained after the\ntroops marched out. The cattle had been shot down as they ran at large,\nand lay dead or dying around. This work of butchery had commenced just\nas we were leaving the fort. I well remembered a remark of Ensign Ronan,\nas the firing went on. ’Such,’ turning to me, ’is to be our fate–to be\nshot down like brutes!’",
        "“’Well, sir,’ said the commanding officer, who overheard him, ’are you\nafraid?’",
        "“’No,’ replied the high-spirited young man, ’I can march up to the enemy\nwhere you dare not show your face.’ And his subsequent gallant behavior\nshowed this to be no idle boast.",
        "“As the noise of the firing grew gradually less and the stragglers from\nthe victorious party came dropping in, I received confirmation of what\nmy father had hurriedly communicated in our rencontre on the lake\nshore; namely, that the whites had surrendered, after the loss of about\ntwo-thirds of their number. They had stipulated, through the\ninterpreter, Peresh Leclerc, for the preservation of their lives, and\nthose of the remaining women and children, and for their delivery at\nsome of the British posts, unless ransomed by traders in the Indian\ncountry. It appears that the wounded prisoners were not considered as\nincluded in the stipulation, and a horrid scene ensued upon their being\nbrought into camp.",
        "“An old squaw, infuriated by the loss of friends, or excited by the\nsanguinary scenes around her, seemed possessed by a demoniac ferocity.\nShe seized a stable-fork and assaulted one miserable victim, who lay\ngroaning and writhing in the agony of his wounds, aggravated by the\nscorching beams of the sun. With a delicacy of feeling scarcely to have\nbeen expected under such circumstances, Wau-bee-nee-mah stretched a mat\nacross two poles, between me and this dreadful scene. I was thus spared\nin some degree a view of its horrors, although I could not entirely\nclose my ears to the cries of the sufferer The following night five more\nof the wounded prisoners were tomahawked.”",
        "The Americans, it appears, after their first attack by the Indians,\ncharged upon those who had concealed themselves in a sort of ravine,\nintervening between the sand-banks and the prairie. The latter gathered\nthemselves into a body, and after some hard fighting, in which the\nnumber of whites had become reduced to twenty-eight, this little band\nsucceeded in breaking through the enemy, and gaining a rising ground,\nnot far from the Oak Woods. Further contest now seeming hopeless,\nLieutenant Helm sent Peresh Leclerc, a half-breed boy in the service of\nMr. Kinzie, who had accompanied the detachment and fought manfully on\ntheir side, to propose terms of capitulation. It was stipulated that the\nlives of all the survivors should be spared, and a ransom permitted as\nsoon as practicable.",
        "But in the mean time a horrible scene had been enacted. One young\nsavage, climbing into the baggage-wagon containing the children of the\nwhite families, twelve in number, tomahawked the entire group. This was\nduring the engagement near the sand-hills. When Captain Wells, who was\nfighting near, beheld it, he exclaimed,–",
        "“Is that their game, butchering the women and children? Then I will\nkill, too!”",
        "So saying, he turned his horse’s head, and started for the Indian camp,\nnear the fort, where had been left their squaws and children.",
        "Several Indians pursued him as he galloped along. He laid himself flat\non the neck of his horse, loading and firing in that position, as he\nwould occasionally turn on his pursuers. At length their balls took\neffect, killing his horse, and severely wounding himself. At this moment\nhe was met by Winnemeg and Wau-ban-see, who endeavored to save him\nfrom the savages who had now overtaken him. As they supported him along,\nafter having disengaged him from his horse, he received his death-blow\nfrom another Indian, Pee-so-tum, who stabbed him in the back.",
        "The heroic resolution of one of the soldiers’ wives deserves to be\nrecorded. She was a Mrs. Corbin, and had, from the first, expressed the\ndetermination never to fall into the hands of the savages, believing\nthat their prisoners were always subjected to tortures worse than death.",
        "When, therefore, a party came upon her, to make her a prisoner, she\nfought with desperation, refusing to surrender, although assured, by\nsigns, of safety and kind treatment, and literally suffered herself to\nbe cut to pieces, rather than become their captive.",
        "There was a Sergeant Holt, who, early in the engagement, received a ball\nin the neck. Finding himself badly wounded, he gave his sword to his\nwife, who was on horseback near him, telling her to defend herself; he\nthen made for the lake, to keep out of the way of the balls. Mrs. Holt\nrode a very fine horse, which the Indians were desirous of possessing,\nand they therefore attacked her, in hopes of dismounting her.",
        "They fought only with the butt-ends of their guns, for their object was\nnot to kill her. She hacked and hewed at their pieces as they were\nthrust against her, now on this side, now that. Finally, she broke loose\nfrom them, and dashed out into the prairie. The Indians pursued her,\nshouting and laughing, and now and then calling out,–",
        "“The brave woman! do not hurt her!”",
        "At length they overtook her again, and, while she was engaged with two\nor three in front, one succeeded in seizing her by the neck behind, and\ndragging her, although a large and powerful woman, from her horse.\nNotwithstanding that their guns had been so hacked and injured, and even\nthemselves cut severely, they seemed to regard her only with admiration.\nThey took her to a trader on the Illinois River, by whom she was\nrestored to her friends, after having received every kindness during her\ncaptivity.[37]",
        "Those of the family of Mr. Kinzie who had remained in the boat, near the\nmouth of the river, were carefully guarded by Kee-po-tah and another\nIndian. They had seen the smoke–then the blaze–and immediately after,\nthe report of the first tremendous discharge sounded in their ears. Then\nall was confusion They realized nothing until they saw an Indian come\ntowards them from the battle-ground, leading a horse on which sat a\nlady, apparently wounded.",
        "“That is Mrs. Heald,” cried Mrs. Kinzie. “That Indian will kill her.\nRun, Chandonnai,” to one of Mr. Kinzie’s clerks, “take the mule that is\ntied there, and offer it to him to release her.”",
        "Her captor, by this time, was in the act of disengaging her bonnet from\nher head, in order to scalp her. Chandonnai ran up, and offered the mule\nas a ransom, with the promise of ten bottles of whiskey as soon as they\nshould reach his village. The latter was a strong temptation.",
        "“But,” said the Indian, “she is badly wounded–she will die. Will you\ngive me the whiskey at all events?”",
        "Chandonnai promised that he would, and the bargain was concluded. The\nsavage placed the lady’s bonnet on his own head, and, after an\nineffectual effort on the part of some squaws to rob her of her shoes\nand stockings, she was brought on board the boat, where she lay moaning\nwith pain from the many bullet-wounds she had received in both arms.",
        "The horse Mrs. Heald had ridden was a fine, spirited animal, and, being\ndesirous of possessing themselves of it uninjured, the Indians had aimed\ntheir shots so as to disable the rider, without injuring her steed.",
        "She had not lain long in the boat, when a young Indian of savage aspect\nwas seen appapproaching buffalo robe was hastily drawn over her, and she\nwas admonished to suppress all sound of complaint, as she valued her\nlife.",
        "The heroic woman remained perfectly silent, while the savage drew near.\nHe had a pistol in his hand, which he rested on the side of the boat,\nwhile, with a fearful scowl, he looked pryingly around. Black Jim, one\nof the servants, who stood in the bow of the boat, seized an axe that\nlay near, and signed to him that if he shot, he would cleave his skull;\ntelling him that the boat contained only the family of Shaw-nee-aw-kee.\nUpon this, the Indian retired. It afterwards appeared that the object of\nhis search was Mr. Burnett, a trader from St. Joseph’s, with whom he\nhad some account to settle.",
        "When the boat was at length permitted to return to the mansion of Mr.\nKinzie, and Mrs. Heald was removed to the house, it became necessary to\ndress her wounds.",
        "Mr. K. applied to an old chief who stood by, and who, like most of his\ntribe, possessed some skill in surgery, to extract a ball from the arm\nof the sufferer.",
        "“No, father,” replied he. “I cannot do it–it makes me sick\nhere\"–(placing his hand on his heart.)",
        "Mr. Kinzie then performed the operation himself, with his penknife.",
        "At their own mansion the family of Mr. Kinzie were closely guarded by\ntheir Indian friends, whose intention it was to carry them to Detroit\nfor security. The rest of the prisoners remained at the wigwams of their\ncaptors.",
        "The following morning, the work of plunder being completed, the Indians\nset fire to the fort. A very equitable distribution of the finery\nappeared to have been made, and shawls, ribbons, and feathers fluttered\nabout in all directions. The ludicrous appearance of one young fellow,\nwho had arrayed himself in a muslin gown and the bonnet of one of the\nladies, would, under other circumstances, have afforded matter of\namusement.",
        "Black Partridge, Wau-ban-see, and Kee-po-tah, with two other Indians,\nhaving established themselves in the porch of the building as sentinels,\nto protect the family from any evil that the young men might be excited\nto commit, all remained tranquil for a short space after the\nconflagration.",
        "Very soon, however, a party of Indians from the Wabash made their\nappearance. These were, decidedly, the most hostile and implacable of\nall the tribes of the Pottowattamies.",
        "Being more remote, they had shared less than some of their brethren in\nthe kindness of Mr. Kinzie and his family, and consequently their\nsentiments of regard for them were less powerful.",
        "Runners had been sent to the villages to apprise them of the intended\nevacuation of the post, as well as of the plan of the Indians assembled\nto attack the troops.",
        "Thirsting to participate in such a scene, they hurried on; and great was\ntheir mortification, on arriving at the river Aux Plaines, to meet with\na party of their friends having with them their chief Nee-scot-nee-meg,\nbadly wounded, and to learn that the battle was over, the spoils\ndivided, and the scalps all taken.",
        "On arriving at Chicago they blackened their faces, and proceeded towards\nthe dwelling of Mr. Kinzie.",
        "From his station on the piazza Black Partridge had watched their\napproach, and his fears were particularly awakened for the safety of\nMrs. Helm (Mr. Kinzie’s step-daughter), who had recently come to the\npost, and was personally unknown to the more remote Indians. By his\nadvice she was made to assume the ordinary dress of a Frenchwoman of the\ncountry; namely, a short gown and petticoat, with a blue cotton\nhandkerchief wrapped around her head. In this disguise she was conducted\nby Black Partridge himself to the house of Ouilmette, a Frenchman with a\nhalf-breed wife, who formed a part of the establishment of Mr. Kinzie\nand whose dwelling was close at hand.",
        "It so happened that the Indians came first to this house, in their\nsearch for prisoners. As they approached, the inmates, fearful that the\nfair complexion and general appearance of Mrs. Helm might betray her for\nan American, raised a large feather bed and placed her under the edge of\nit, upon the bedstead, with her face to the wall. Mrs. Bisson, a\nhalf-breed, the sister of Ouilmette’s wife, then seated herself with\nher sewing upon the front of the bed.",
        "It was a hot day in August, and the feverish excitement of fear and\nagitation, together with her position, which was nearly suffocating,\nbecame so intolerable, that Mrs. Helm at length entreated to be released\nand given up to the Indians.",
        "“I can but die,” said she; “let them put an end to my misery at once.”",
        "Mrs. Bisson replied, “Your death would be the destruction of us all, for\nBlack Partridge has resolved that if one drop of the blood of your\nfamily is spilled, he will take the lives of all concerned in it, even\nhis nearest friends; and if once the work of murder commences, there\nwill be no end of it, so long as there remains one white person or\nhalf-breed in the country.”",
        "This expostulation nerved Mrs. Helm with fresh resolution.",
        "The Indians entered, and she could occasionally see them from her\nhiding-place, gliding about, and stealthily inspecting every part of the\nroom, though without making any ostensible search, until, apparently\nsatisfied that there was no one concealed, they left the house.",
        "All this time Mrs. Bisson had kept her seat upon the side of the bed,\ncalmly sorting and arranging the patch-work of the quilt on which she\nwas engaged, and preserving an appearance of the utmost tranquillity,\nalthough she knew not but that the next moment she might receive a\ntomahawk in her brain. Her self-command unquestionably saved the lives\nof all present.",
        "From Ouilmette’s house the party of Indians proceeded to the dwelling of\nMr. Kinzie. They entered the parlor in which the family were assembled\nwith their faithful protectors, and seated themselves upon the floor in\nsilence. Black Partridge perceived from their moody and revengeful\nlooks what was passing in their minds, but he dared not remonstrate with\nthem. He only observed in a low tone to Wau-ban-see,–",
        "“We have endeavored to save our friends, but it is in vain–nothing will\nsave them now.”",
        "At this moment a friendly whoop was heard from a party of new-comers on\nthe opposite bank of the river. Black Partridge sprang to meet their\nleader, as the canoes in which they had hastily embarked touched the\nbank near the house.",
        "“Who are you?” demanded he.",
        "“A man. Who are you?”",
        "“A man like yourself. But tell me who you are,\"–meaning, Tell me your\ndisposition, and which side you are for.",
        "“I am a Sau-ga-nash!”",
        "“Then make all speed to the house–your friend is in danger, and you\nalone can save him.”",
        "Billy Caldwell[38] for it was he, entered the parlor with a calm step,\nand without a trace of agitation in his manner. He deliberately took off\nhis accoutrements and placed them with his rifle behind the door, then\nsaluted the hostile savages.",
        "“How now, my friends! A good-day to you. I was told there were enemies\nhere, but I am glad to find only friends. Why have you blackened your\nfaces? Is it that you are mourning for the friends you have lost in\nbattle?” (purposely misunderstanding this token of evil designs.)",
        "“Or is it that you are fasting? If so, ask our friend, here, and he\nwill give you to eat. He is the Indian’s friend, and never yet refused\nthem what they had need of.”",
        "Thus taken by surprise, the savages were ashamed to acknowledge their\nbloody purpose. They, therefore, said modestly that they came to beg of\ntheir friends some white cotton in which to wrap their dead before\ninterring them. This was given to them, with some other presents, and\nthey took their departure peaceably from the premises.",
        "Along with Mr. Kinzie’s party was a non-commissioned officer who had\nmade his escape in a singular manner. As the troops were about leaving\nthe fort, it was found that the baggage-horses of the surgeon had\nstrayed off. The quartermaster-sergeant, Griffith, was sent to collect\nthem and bring them on, it being absolutely necessary to recover them,\nsince their packs contained part of the surgeon’s apparatus, and the\nmedicines for the march.",
        "This man had been for a long time on the sick report and for this reason\nwas given the charge of the baggage, instead of being placed with the\ntroops. His efforts to recover the horses being unsuccessful, he was\nhastening to rejoin his party, alarmed at some appearances of disorder\nand hostile indications among the Indians, when he was met and made\nprisoner by To-pee-nee-bee.",
        "Having taken from him his arms and accoutrements, the chief put him into\na canoe and paddled him across the river, bidding him make for the woods\nand secrete himself. This he did; and the following day, in the\nafternoon, seeing from his lurking-place that all appeared quiet, he\nventured to steal cautiously into the garden of Ouilmette, where he\nconcealed himself for a time behind some currant-bushes.",
        "At length he determined to enter the house, and accordingly climbed up\nthrough a small back window into the room where the family were. This\nwas just as the Wabash Indians had left the house of Ouilmette for that\nof Mr. Kinzie. The danger of the sergeant was now imminent. The family\nstripped him of his uniform and arrayed him in a suit of deer-skin, with\nbelt, moccasins, and pipe, like a French engagé. His dark complexion and\nlarge black whiskers favored the disguise. The family were all ordered\nto address him in French, and, although utterly ignorant of the\nlanguage, he continued to pass for a Weem-tee-gosh,[39] and as such to\naccompany Mr. Kinzie and his family, undetected by his enemies, until\nthey reached a place of safety.",
        "On the third day after the battle, the family of Mr. Kinzie, with the\nclerks of the establishment, were put into a boat, under the care of\nFrançois, a half-breed interpreter, and conveyed to St. Joseph’s, where\nthey remained until the following November, under the protection of\nTo-pee-nee-bee’s band. They were then conducted to Detroit, under the\nescort of Chandonnai and their trusty Indian friend, Kee-po-tah, and\ndelivered up, as prisoners of war, to Colonel McKee, the British Indian\nAgent.",
        "Mr. Kinzie was not allowed to leave St. Joseph’s with his family, his\nIndian friends insisting on his remaining and endeavoring to secure some\nremnant of his scattered property. During his excursions with them for\nthat purpose, he wore the costume and paint of the tribe, in order to\nescape capture and perhaps death at the hands of those who were still\nthirsting for blood. In time, however, his anxiety for his family\ninduced him to follow them to Detroit, where, in the month of January,\nhe was received and paroled by General Proctor.",
        "Captain and Mrs. Heald were sent across the lake to St. Joseph the day\nafter the battle. The former had received two wounds, the latter seven,\nin the engagement.",
        "Lieutenant Helm, who was likewise wounded, was carried by some friendly\nIndians to their village on the Au Sable, and thence to Peoria, where he\nwas liberated by the intervention of Mr. Thomas Forsyth, the\nhalf-brother of Mr. Kinzie. Mrs. Helm accompanied her parents to St.\nJoseph, where they resided in the family of Alexander Robinson,[40]\nreceiving from them all possible kindness and hospitality for several\nmonths.",
        "After their arrival in Detroit, Mrs. Helm was joined by her husband,\nwhen they were both arrested by order of the British commander, and sent\non horseback, in the dead of winter, through Canada to Fort George, on\nthe Niagara frontier. When they arrived at that post, there had been no\nofficial appointed to receive them, and, notwithstanding their long and\nfatiguing journey in weather the most cold and inclement, Mrs. Helm, a\ndelicate woman of seventeen years, was permitted to sit waiting in her\nsaddle, outside the gate, for more than an hour, before the refreshment\nof fire or food, or even the shelter of a roof, was offered them. When\nColonel Sheaffe, who had been absent at the time, was informed of this\nbrutal inhospitality, he expressed the greatest indignation. He waited\non Mrs. Helm immediately, apologized in the most courteous manner, and\ntreated both her and Lieutenant Helm with the most considerate kindness,\nuntil, by an exchange of prisoners, they were liberated, and found means\nto reach their friends in Steuben County, N.Y.",
        "Captain Heald had been taken prisoner by an Indian from the Kankakee,\nwho had a strong personal regard for him, and who, when he saw the\nwounded and enfeebled state of Mrs. Heald, released her husband that he\nmight accompany his wife to St. Joseph. To the latter place they were\naccordingly carried, as has been related, by Chandonnai and his party.\nIn the mean time, the Indian who had so nobly released his prisoner\nreturned to his village on the Kankakee, where he had the mortification\nof finding that his conduct had excited great dissatisfaction among his\nband. So great was the displeasure manifested, that he resolved to make\na journey to St. Joseph and reclaim his prisoner.",
        "News of his intention being brought to To-pee-nee-bee and Kee-po-tah,\nunder whose care the prisoners were, they held a private council with\nChandonnai, Mr. Kinzie, and the principal men of the village, the result\nof which was a determination to send Captain and Mrs. Heald to the\nisland of Mackinac, and deliver them up to the British.",
        "They were accordingly put in a bark canoe, and paddled by Robinson and\nhis wife a distance of three hundred miles along the coast of Michigan,\nand surrendered as prisoners of war to the commanding officer at\nMackinac.",
        "As an instance of the procrastinating spirit of Captain Heald, it may be\nmentioned that, even after he had received certain intelligence that his\nIndian captor was on his way from the Kankakee to St. Joseph to retake\nhim, he would still have delayed another day at that place, to make\npreparation for a more comfortable journey to Mackinac.",
        "The soldiers, with their wives and surviving children, were dispersed\namong the different villages of the Pottowattamies upon the Illinois,\nWabash, Rock River, and at Milwaukie, until the following spring, when\nthey were, for the most part, carried to Detroit and ransomed.",
        "Mrs. Burns, with her infant, became the prisoner of a chief, who carried\nher to his village and treated her with great kindness. His wife, from\njealousy of the favor shown to “the white woman” and her child, always\ntreated them with great hostility. On one occasion she struck the infant\nwith a tomahawk, and narrowly missed her aim of putting an end to it\naltogether.[41] They were not left long in the power of the old hag\nafter this demonstration, but on the first opportunity were carried to a\nplace of safety.",
        "The family of Mr. Lee had resided in a house on the Lake shore, not far\nfrom the fort. Mr. Lee was the owner of Lee’s Place, which he cultivated\nas a farm. It was his son who ran down with the discharged soldier to\ngive the alarm of “Indians,” at the fort, on the afternoon of the 7th of\nApril. The father, the son, and all the other members of the family had\nfallen victims on the 15th of August, except Mrs. Lee and her young\ninfant. These were claimed by Black Partridge, and carried to his\nvillage on the Au Sable. He had been particularly attached to a little\ngirl of Mrs. Lee’s, about twelve years of age. This child had been\nplaced on horseback for the march; and, as she was unaccustomed to the\nexercise, she was tied fast to the saddle, lest by any accident she\nshould slip off or be thrown.",
        "She was within reach of the balls at the commencement of the engagement,\nand was severely wounded. The horse set off on a full gallop, which\npartly threw her, but she was held fast by the bands which confined her,\nand hung dangling as the animal ran violently about. In this state she\nwas met by Black Partridge, who caught the horse and disengaged her from\nthe saddle. Finding her so much wounded that she could not recover, and\nthat she was suffering great agony, he put the finishing stroke to her\nat once with his tomahawk. He afterwards said that this was the hardest\nthing he ever tried to do, but he did it because he could not bear to\nsee her suffer.",
        "He took the mother and her infant to his village, where he became warmly\nattached to the former–so much so, that he wished to marry her; but, as\nshe very naturally objected, he treated her with the greatest respect\nand consideration. He was in no hurry to release her, for he was in\nhopes of prevailing on her to become his wife. In the course of the\nwinter her child fell ill. Finding that none of the remedies within\ntheir reach were effectual, Black Partridge proposed to take the little\none to Chicago, where there was now a French trader living in the\nmansion of Mr. Kinzie, and procure some medical aid from him. Wrapping\nup his charge with the greatest care, he set out on his journey.",
        "When he arrived at the residence of M. Du Pin, he entered the room where\nhe was, and carefully placed his burden on the floor.",
        "“What have you there?” asked M. Du Pin.",
        "“A young raccoon, which I have brought you as a present,” was the reply;\nand, opening the pack, he showed the little sick infant.",
        "When the trader had prescribed for its complaint, and Black Partridge\nwas about to return to his home, he told his friend of the proposal he\nhad made to Mrs. Lee to become his wife, and the manner in which it had\nbeen received.",
        "M. Du Pin, entertaining some fears that the chief’s honorable resolution\nto leave it to the lady herself whether to accept his addresses or not,\nmight not hold out, entered at once into a negotiation for her ransom,\nand so effectually wrought upon the good feelings of Black Partridge\nthat he consented to bring his fair prisoner at once to Chicago, that\nshe might be restored to her friends.",
        "Whether the kind trader had at the outset any other feeling in the\nmatter than sympathy and brotherly kindness, we cannot say; we only know\nthat in process of time Mrs. Lee became Madame Du Pin, and that the\nworthy couple lived together in great happiness for many years after.",
        "The fate of Nau-non-gee, one of the chiefs of the Calumet village, and\nwho is mentioned in the early part of the narrative, deserves to be\nrecorded.",
        "Daring the battle of the 15th of August, the chief object of his attack\nwas one Sergeant Hays, a man from whom he had received many acts of\nkindness.",
        "After Hays had received a ball through the body, this Indian ran up to\nhim to tomahawk him, when the sergeant, collecting his remaining\nstrength, pierced him through the body with his bayonet. They fell\ntogether. Other Indians running up soon dispatched Hays, and it was not\nuntil then that his bayonet was extracted from the body of his\nadversary.",
        "The wounded chief was carried after the battle to his village on the\nCalumet, where he survived for several days. Finding his end\napproaching, he called together his young men, and enjoined them, in the\nmost solemn manner, to regard the safety of their prisoners after his\ndeath, and to take the lives of none of them from respect to his memory,\nas he deserved his fate from the hands of those whose kindness he had so\nill requited.",
        "It had been a stipulation of General Hull at the surrender of Detroit,\nwhich took place the day after the massacre at Chicago, that the\ninhabitants should be permitted to remain undisturbed in their homes.\nAccordingly, the family of Mr. Kinzie took up their quarters with their\nfriends in the old mansion, which many will still recollect as standing\non the northwest corner of Jefferson Avenue and Wayne Street.",
        "The feelings of indignation and sympathy were constantly aroused in the\nhearts of the citizens during the winter that ensued. They were almost\ndaily called upon to witness the cruelties practised upon the American\nprisoners brought in by their Indian captors. Those who could scarcely\ndrag their wounded, bleeding feet over the frozen ground, were compelled\nto dance for the amusement of the savages; and these exhibitions\nsometimes took place before the Government House, the residence of\nColonel McKee. Some of the British officers looked on from their windows\nat these heart-rending performances; for the honor of humanity, we will\nhope such instances were rare.",
        "Everything that could be made available among the effects of the\ncitizens was offered, to ransom their countrymen from the hands of these\ninhuman beings. The prisoners brought in from the River Raisin–those\nunfortunate men who were permitted, after their surrender to General\nProctor, to be tortured and murdered by inches by his savage\nallies–excited the sympathies and called for the action of the whole\ncommunity. Private houses were turned into hospitals, and every one was\nforward to get possession of as many as possible of the survivors. To\neffect this, even the articles of their apparel were bartered by the\nladies of Detroit, as they watched from their doors or windows the\nmiserable victims carried about for sale.",
        "In the dwelling of Mr. Kinzie one large room was devoted to the\nreception of the sufferers. Few of them survived. Among those spoken of\nas objects of the deepest interest were two young gentlemen of Kentucky,\nbrothers, both severely wounded, and their wounds aggravated to a mortal\ndegree by subsequent ill usage and hardships. Their solicitude for each\nother, and their exhibition in various ways of the most tender fraternal\naffection, created an impression never to be forgotten.",
        "The last bargain made was by black Jim, and one of the children, who had\npermission to redeem a negro servant of the gallant Colonel Allen, with\nan old white horse, the only available article that remained among their\npossessions.",
        "A brother of Colonel Allen afterwards came to Detroit, and the negro\npreferred returning to servitude rather than remaining a stranger in a\nstrange land.",
        "Mr. Kinzie, as has been related, joined his family at Detroit in the\nmonth of January. A short time after, suspicions arose in the mind of\nGeneral Proctor that he was in correspondence with General Harrison, who\nwas now at Fort Meigs, and who was believed to be meditating an advance\nupon Detroit. Lieutenant Watson, of the British army, waited upon Mr.\nKinzie one day with an invitation to the quarters of General Proctor on\nthe opposite side of the river, saying he wished to speak with him, on\nbusiness. Quite unsuspicious, he complied with the invitation, when to\nhis surprise he was ordered into confinement, and strictly guarded in\nthe house of his former partner, Mr. Patterson, of Sandwich. Finding\nthat he did not return to his home, Mrs. Kinzie informed some of the\nIndian chiefs, his particular friends, who immediately repaired to the\nhead-quarters of the commanding officer, demanded “their friend’s\"\nrelease, and brought him back to his home. After waiting a time until a\nfavorable opportunity presented itself, the General sent a detachment of\ndragoons to arrest Mr. Kinzie. They had succeeded in carrying him away,\nand crossing the river with him. Just at this moment a party of friendly\nIndians made their appearance.",
        "“Where is the Shaw-nee-aw-kee?” was the first question.",
        "“There,” replied his wife, pointing across the river, “in the hands of\nthe red-coats, who are taking him away again.”",
        "The Indians ran to the river, seized some canoes that they found there,\nand, crossing over to Sandwich, compelled General Proctor a second time\nto forego his intentions.",
        "A third time this officer made the attempt, and succeeded in arresting\nMr. Kinzie and conveying him heavily ironed to Fort Malden, in Canada,\nat the mouth of the Detroit River. Here he was at first treated with\ngreat severity, but after a time the rigor of his confinement was\nsomewhat relaxed, and he was permitted to walk on the bank of the river\nfor air and exercise.",
        "On the 10th of September, as he was taking his promenade under the close\nsupervision of a guard of soldiers, the whole party were startled by the\nsound of guns upon Lake Erie, at no great distance below. What could it\nmean? It must be Commodore Barclay firing into some of the Yankees. The\nfiring continued. The time allotted the prisoner for his daily walk\nexpired, but neither he nor his guard observed the lapse of time, so\nanxiously were they listening to what they now felt sure was an\nengagement between ships of war. At length Mr. Kinzie was reminded that\nthe hour for his return to confinement had arrived. He petitioned for\nanother half-hour.",
        "“Let me stay,” said he, “till we can learn how the battle has gone.”",
        "Very soon a sloop appeared under press of sail, rounding the point, and\npresently two gun-boats in chase of her.",
        "“She is running–she bears the British colors,” cried he–\"yes, yes,\nthey are lowering–she is striking her flag! Now,” turning to the\nsoldiers, “I will go back to prison contented–I know how the battle has\ngone.”",
        "The sloop was the Little Belt, the last of the squadron captured by the\ngallant Perry on that memorable occasion which he announced in the\nimmortal words:",
        "“We have met the enemy, and they are ours!”",
        "Matters were growing critical, and it was necessary to transfer all\nprisoners to a place of greater security than the frontier was now\nlikely to be. It was resolved therefore to send Mr. Kinzie to the\nmother-country. Nothing has ever appeared which would explain the course\nof General Proctor in regard to this gentleman. He had been taken from\nthe bosom of his family, where he was living quietly under the parole\nwhich he had received, and protected by the stipulations of the\nsurrender. He was kept for months in confinement. Now he was placed on\nhorseback under a strong guard, who announced that they had orders to\nshoot him through the head if he offered to speak to a person upon the\nroad. He was tied upon the saddle to prevent his escape, and thus they\nset out for Quebec. A little incident occurred, which will help to\nillustrate the course invariably pursued towards our citizens, at this\nperiod, by the British army on the Northwestern frontier.",
        "The saddle on which Mr. Kinzie rode had not been properly fastened, and,\nowing to the rough motion of the animal on which it was, it turned, so\nas to bring the rider into a most awkward and painful position. His\nlimbs being fastened, he could not disengage himself, and in this manner\nhe was compelled by those who had charge of him to ride until he was\nnearly exhausted, before they had the humanity to release him.",
        "Arrived at Quebec, he was put on board a small vessel to be sent to\nEngland. The vessel when a few days out at sea was chased by an American\nfrigate and driven into Halifax. A second time she set sail, when she\nsprung a leak and was compelled to put back.",
        "The attempt to send him across the ocean was now abandoned, and he was\nreturned to Quebec. Another step, equally inexplicable with his arrest,\nwas soon after taken. This was, his release and that of Mr. Macomb, of\nDetroit, who was also in confinement in Quebec, and the permission given\nthem to return to their friends and families, although the war was not\nyet ended. It may possibly be imagined that in the treatment these\ngentlemen received, the British commander-in-chief sheltered himself\nunder the plea of their being “native-born British subjects,” and\nperhaps when it was ascertained that Mr. Kinzie was indeed a citizen of\nthe United States it was thought safest to release him.",
        "In the mean time, General Harrison at the head of his troops had reached\nDetroit. He landed on the 29th of September. All the citizens went forth\nto meet him–Mrs. Kinzie, leading her children by the hand, was of the\nnumber. The General accompanied her to her home, and took up his abode\nthere. On his arrival he was introduced to Kee-po-tah, who happened to\nbe on a visit to the family at that time. The General had seen the chief\nthe preceding year, at the Council at Vincennes, and the meeting was one\nof great cordiality and interest.",
        "In 1816, Mr. Kinzie and his family again returned to Chicago. The fort\nwas rebuilt on a somewhat larger scale than the former one. It was not\nuntil the return of the troops that the bones of the unfortunate\nAmericans who had been massacred four years before, were collected and\nburied.",
        "An Indian Agency, under the charge of Charles Jewett, Esq., of Kentucky,\nwas established. He was succeeded in 1820 by Dr. Alexander Wolcott, of\nConnecticut, who occupied that position until his death in 1830.",
        "The troops were removed from the garrison in 1823, but restored in 1828,\nafter the Winnebago war. This was a disturbance between the Winnebagoes\nand white settlers on and near the Mississippi. After some murders had\nbeen committed, the young chief, Red Bird, was taken and imprisoned at\nPrairie du Chien to await his trial, where he committed suicide in\nconsequence of chagrin and the irksomeness of confinement. It was feared\nthat the Pottowattamies would make common cause with the Winnebagoes,\nand commence a general system of havoc and bloodshed on the frontier.\nThey were deterred from such a step, probably, by the exertions of Billy\nCaldwell, Robinson, and Shaw-bee-nay, who made an expedition among the\nRock River bands, to argue and persuade them into remaining tranquil.",
        "The few citizens of Chicago in those days, lived for the most part a\nvery quiet, unvaried life. The great abundance of game, and the immense\nfertility of the lands they cultivated, furnished them with a\nsuperabundance of all the luxuries of garden, corn-field, and dairy The\nquestion was once asked by a friend in the “East countrie,”",
        "“How do you dispose of all the good things you raise? You have no\nmarket?” “No.” “And you cannot consume them all yourselves?” “No.” “What\nthen do you do with them?”",
        "“Why, we manage, when a vessel arrives, to persuade the captain to\naccept a few kegs of butter, and stores of corn and vegetables, as a\npresent, and that helps us to get rid of some of our overplus.”",
        "The mails arrived, as may be supposed, at very rare intervals. They were\nbrought occasionally from Fort Clark (Peoria), but more frequently from\nFort Wayne, or across the peninsula of Michigan, which was still a\nwilderness peopled with savages. The hardy adventurer who acted as\nexpress was, not unfrequently, obliged to imitate the birds of heaven\nand “lodge among the branches,” in order to insure the safety of himself\nand his charge.",
        "Visitors were very rare, unless it was a friend who came to sojourn for\nseveral months and share a life in the wilderness. A traveller, however,\noccasionally found his way to the spot, in passing to or from “parts\nunknown,” and such a one was sure of a hospitable and hearty welcome.",
        "A gentleman journeying from the southern settlements once arrived late\nin the evening at Wolf Point, where was then the small\ntrading-establishment of George Hunt and a Mr. Wallace. He stopped and\ninquired if he could have accommodation for the night for himself and\nhis horse. The answer was, that they were ill provided to entertain a\nstranger–the house was small, and they were keeping “bachelor’s hall.”",
        "“Is there no place,” inquired the traveller, “where I can obtain a\nlodging?”",
        "“Oh, yes–you will find a very comfortable house, Mr. Kinzie’s, about\nhalf a mile below, near the mouth of the river.”",
        "The stranger turned his horse’s head and took the road indicated.\nArrived at the spot, his first inquiry was,–",
        "“Is this the residence of Mr. Kinzie?”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“I should be glad to get accommodation for myself and horse.”",
        "“Certainly, sir–walk in.”",
        "The horse was taken to the stable, while the gentleman was ushered into\na parlor where were two ladies. The usual preliminary questions and\nanswers were gone through, for in a new country people soon become\nacquainted, and the gentleman ere long found himself seated at a\ncomfortable hot supper–we will venture to say a fine supper, since the\ntable in this domestic establishment has always been somewhat famous.",
        "Apparently, the gentleman enjoyed it, for he made himself quite at home.\nHe even called for a boot-jack after tea, and drew off his boots. The\nladies were a little surprised, but they had lived a good while out of\nthe world, and they did not know what changes in etiquette might have\ntaken place during their retirement.",
        "Before taking his leave for the night, the traveller signified what it\nwould please him to have for breakfast, which was duly prepared. The\nnext day proved stormy. The gentleman was satisfied with his quarters,\nand, having taken care to ascertain that there was no neglect or\ndeficiency of accommodation so far as his horse was concerned, he got\nthrough the day very comfortably.",
        "Now and then, when he was tired of reading, he would converse with the\nfamily, and seemed, upon the whole, by no means disposed to hold himself\naloof, but to indulge in a little becoming sociability, seeing they were\nall there away in the woods.",
        "The second day the weather brightened. The traveller signified his\nintention to depart. He ordered his horse to the door–then he called\nfor his bill.",
        "“My house is not a tavern, sir,” was the astounding reply.",
        "“Not a tavern! Good heavens! have I been making myself at home in this\nmanner in a private family?”",
        "He was profuse in his apologies, which, however, were quite unnecessary,\nfor the family had perceived from the first the mistake he had fallen\ninto, and they had amused themselves during his whole visit in\nanticipating the consternation of their guest when he should be\nundeceived.",
        "It was in the year 1816 (the year of the rebuilding of the fort, after\nits destruction by the Indians) that the tract of land on which Chicago\nstands, together with the surrounding country, was ceded to the United\nStates by the Pottowattamies. They remained the peaceful occupants of\nit, however, for twenty years longer. It was not until 1836 that they\nwere removed by Government to lands appropriated for their use on the\nUpper Missouri.",
        "In the year 1830 the town of Chicago was laid out into lots by\nCommissioners appointed by the State. At this time the prices of these\nlots ranged from ten to sixty dollars.",
        "Mr. Kinzie, who, from the geographical position of this place, and the\nvast fertility of the surrounding country, had always foretold its\neventual prosperity and importance, was not permitted to witness the\nrealization of his predictions. He closed his useful and energetic life\non the 6th of January, 1828, having just completed his sixty-fifth year.",
        "Chicago was not, at the period of my first visit, the cheerful, happy\nplace it had once been. The death of Dr. Wolcott, of Lieutenant Furman,\nand of a promising young son of Mr. Beaubien, all within a few weeks of\neach other, had thrown a gloom over the different branches of the social\ncircle.",
        "The weather, too, was inclement and stormy beyond anything that had been\nknown before. Only twice, during a period of two months, did the sun\nshine out through the entire day. So late as the second week in April,\nwhen my husband had left to return to Fort Winnebago, the storms were so\nsevere that he and his men were obliged to lie by two or three days in\nan Indian lodge.",
        "Robert Kinzie, Medard Beaubien, and Billy Caldwell had gone at the same\ntime to the Calumet to hunt, and, as they did not make their appearance\nfor many days, we were persuaded they had perished with cold. They\nreturned at length, however, to our infinite joy, having only escaped\nfreezing by the forethought of Robert and Caldwell in carrying each two\nblankets instead of one.",
        "Our only recreation was an occasional ride on horseback, when the\nweather would permit, through the woods on the north side of the river,\nor across the prairie, along the lake shore on the south.",
        "When we went in the former direction, a little bridle-path took us along\nwhat is now Rush Street. The thick boughs of the trees arched over our\nheads, and we were often compelled, as we rode, to break away the\nprojecting branches of the shrubs which impeded our path. The little\nprairie west of Wright’s Woods was the usual termination of our ride in\nthis direction.",
        "When we chose the path across the prairie towards the south, we\ngenerally passed a new-comer, Dr. Harmon, superintending the\nconstruction of a sod fence, at a spot he had chosen, near the shore\nof the lake. In this inclosure he occupied himself, as the season\nadvanced, in planting fruit-stones of all descriptions, to make ready a\ngarden and orchard for future enjoyment.",
        "We usually stopped to have a little chat. The two favorite themes of the\nDoctor were horticulture, and the certain future importance of Chicago.\nThat it was destined to be a great city, was his unalterable conviction;\nand in deed, by this time, all forest and prairie as it was, we half\nbegan to believe it ourselves.",
        "On the pleasant afternoons which we occasionally enjoyed as the season\nadvanced, we found no small amusement in practising pistol-firing. The\nplace appropriated to this sport was outside the pickets, the mark being\nplaced on a panel in one of the bastions. The gentlemen must not be\noffended if I record that, in process of time, the ladies acquired a\ndegree of skill that enabled them, as a general thing, to come off\ntriumphant. One of the ladies, Mrs. Hunter, was a great shot, having\nbrought down her grouse on the wing, to the no small delight of one of\nthe officers, Captain Martin Scott, of raccoon celebrity.",
        "Now and then there was a little excitement within the fort, aroused by\nthe discovery that a settler had been engaged in selling milk-punch,\ninstead of milk, to the soldiers, thereby interfering in no small degree\nwith the regularity and perfect discipline of the service. The first\nstep was to “drum out” the offender with all the honors of war–that is,\nwith a party-colored dress, and the Rogue’s March played behind him. The\nnext, to place all the victims of this piece of deception in the\nguard-house, where the commanding officer’s lady supplied them\nbountifully with coffee and hot cakes, by way of opening their eyes to\nthe enormity of their offence. It is not to be wondered at that the\nofficers sometimes complained of its being more of a strife with the\nsoldiers who should get into the guard-house, than who should keep out\nof it. The poor fellows knew when they were well off.",
        "Once, upon a Sunday, we were rowed up to Wolf Point to attend a\nreligious service, conducted by Father See, as he was called.",
        "We saw a tall, slender man, dressed in a green frock-coat, from the\nsleeves of which dangled a pair of hands giving abundant evidence,\ntogether with the rest of his dress, that he placed small faith in the\naxiom–\"cleanliness is a part of holiness.”",
        "He stepped briskly upon a little platform behind a table, and commenced\nhis discourse. His subject was, “The fear of God.”",
        "“There was a kind of fear,” he told us, “that was very nearly\nalee-a-nated to love: so nearly, that it was not worth while splitting\nhairs for the difference.” He then went on to describe this kind of\nfear. He grew more and more involved as he proceeded with his\ndescription until at length, quite bewildered, he paused, and exclaimed,\n\"Come, let’s stop a little while, and clear away the brush.” He\nunravelled, as well as he was able, the tangled thread of his ideas,\nand went on with his subject. But soon, again losing his way, he came to\na second halt. “Now,” said he, wiping the perspiration from his forehead\nwith a red cotton handkerchief many degrees from clean, “now, suppose we\ndrive back a little piece.” Thus he recapitulated what he wished to\nimpress upon us, of the necessity of cherishing a fear that maketh wise\nunto salvation, “which fear,” said he, “may we all enjoy, that together\nwe may soar away, on the rolling clouds of aether, to a boundless and\nhappy eternity, which is the wish of your humble servant.” And,\nflourishing abroad his hands, with the best of dancing-school bows, he\ntook his seat.",
        "It will be readily imagined that we felt our own religious exercises at\nhome to be more edifying than such as this, and that we confined\nourselves to them for the future.",
        "The return of our brother, Robert Kinzie, from Palestine (not the Holy\nLand, but the seat of the Land Office), with the certificate of the\ntitle of the family to that portion of Chicago since known as “Kinzie’s\nAddition,” was looked upon as establishing a home for us at some future\nday, if the glorious dreams of good Dr. Harmon, and a few others, should\ncome to be realized. One little incident will show how moderate were the\nanticipations of most persons at that period.",
        "The certificate, which was issued in Robert’s name (he representing the\nfamily in making the application), described only a fractional\nquarter-section of one hundred and two acres, instead of one hundred and\nsixty acres, the river and Lake Michigan cutting off fifty-eight acres\non the southern and eastern lines of the quarter. The applicants had\nliberty to select their complement of fifty-eight acres out of any\nunappropriated land that suited them.",
        "“Now, my son,” said his mother to Robert, “lay your claim on the\ncorn-field at Wolf Point. It is fine land, and will always be valuable\nfor cultivation; besides, as it faces down the main river, the situation\nwill always be a convenient one.”",
        "The answer was a hearty laugh. “Hear mother!” said Robert. “We have just\ngot a hundred and two acres–more than we shall ever want, or know what\nto do with, and now she would have me go and claim fifty-eight acres\nmore!”",
        "“Take my advice, my boy,” repeated his mother, “or you may live one day\nto regret it.”",
        "“Well, I cannot see how I can ever regret not getting more than we can\npossibly make use of.” And so the matter ended. The fifty-eight acres\nwere never claimed, and there was, I think, a very general impression\nthat asking for our just rights in the case would have a very grasping,\ncovetous look. How much wiser five-and-twenty years have made us!",
        "During my sojourn of two months at Chicago, our mother often entertained\nme with stories of her early life and adventures. The following is her\nhistory of her captivity among the Senecas, which I have put in the form\nof a tale, although without the slightest variation from the facts as I\nreceived them from her lips, and those of her sister, Mrs. William\nForsyth, of Sandwich (C.W.), the little Maggie of the story.",
        "It is well known that previous to the war of the Revolution the whole of\nthe western portion of Pennsylvania was inhabited by different Indian\ntribes. Of these, the Delawares were the friends of the whites, and,\nafter the commencement of the great struggle, took part with the United\nStates. The Iroquois, on the contrary, were the friends and allies of\nthe mother-country.",
        "Very few white settlers had ventured beyond the Susquehanna. The\nnumerous roving bands of Shawanoes, Nanticokes, etc., although at times\nprofessing friendship with the Americans and acting in concert with the\nDelawares or Lenape as allies, at others suffered themselves to be\nseduced by their neighbors, the Iroquois, to show a most sanguinary\nspirit of hostility.",
        "For this reason, the life of the inhabitants of the frontier was one of\nconstant peril and alarm. Many a scene of dismal barbarity was enacted,\nas the history of the times testifies, and even those who felt\nthemselves in some measure protected by their immediate neighbors, the\nDelawares, never lost sight of the caution required by their exposed\nsituation.",
        "The vicinity of the military garrison at Pittsburg–or Fort Pitt, as it\nwas then called–gave additional security to those who had pushed\nfarther west, among the fertile valleys of the Alleghany and\nMonongahela. Among these were the family of Mr. Lytle, who, some years\nprevious to the opening of our story, had removed from Baltimore to\nPath Valley, near Carlisle, and subsequently settled himself on the\nbanks of Plum River, a tributary of the Alleghany. Here, with his wife\nand five children, he had continued to live in comfort and security,\nundisturbed by any hostile visit, and only annoyed by occasional false\nalarms from his more timorous neighbors, who, having had more experience\nin frontier life, were prone to anticipate evil, as well as to magnify\nevery appearance of danger.",
        "On a bright afternoon in the autumn of 1779, two children of Mr. Lytle,\na girl of nine, and her brother, two years younger, were playing in a\nlittle dingle or hollow in the rear of their father’s house. Some large\ntrees, which had been recently felled, were lying here and there, still\nuntrimmed of their branches, and many logs, prepared for fuel, were\nscattered around. Upon one of these the children, wearied with their\nsports, seated themselves, and to beguile the time they fell into\nconversation upon a subject that greatly perplexed them.",
        "While playing in the same place a few hours previous, they had imagined\nthey saw an Indian lurking behind one of the fallen trees. The Indians\nof the neighborhood were in the habit of making occasional visits to the\nfamily, and they had become familiar and even affectionate with many of\nthem, but this seemed a stranger, and after the first hasty glance they\nfled in alarm to the house.",
        "Their mother chid them for the report they brought, which she endeavored\nto convince them was without foundation. “You know,” said she, “you are\nalways alarming us unnecessarily: the neighbors’ children have\nfrightened you to death. Go back to your play, and learn to be more\ncourageous.”",
        "So the children returned to their sports, hardly persuaded by their\nmother’s arguments. While they were thus seated upon the trunk of the\ntree, their discourse was interrupted by the note, apparently, of a\nquail not far off.",
        "“Listen,” said the boy, as a second note answered the first; “do you\nhear that?”",
        "“Yes,” was the reply, and, after a few moments’ silence, “do you not\nhear a rustling among the branches of the tree yonder?”",
        "“Perhaps it is a squirrel–but look! what is that? Surely I saw\nsomething red among the branches. It looked like a fawn popping up its\nhead.”",
        "At this moment, the children, who had been gazing so intently in the\ndirection of the fallen tree that all other objects were forgotten, felt\nthemselves seized from behind and pinioned in an iron grasp. What were\ntheir horror and dismay to find themselves in the arms of savages, whose\nterrific countenances and gestures plainly showed them to be enemies!",
        "They made signs to the children to be silent, on pain of death, and\nhurried them off, half dead with terror, in a direction leading from\ntheir father’s habitation. After travelling some distance in profound\nsilence, the severity of their captors somewhat relaxed, and as night\napproached the party halted, after adopting the usual precautions to\nsecure themselves against a surprise.",
        "In an agony of uncertainty and terror, torn from their beloved home and\nparents, and anticipating all the horrors with which the rumors of the\ntimes had invested a captivity among the Indians–perhaps even a\ntorturing death–the poor children could no longer restrain their grief,\nbut gave vent to sobs and lamentations.",
        "Their distress appeared to excite the compassion of one of the party, a\nman of mild aspect, who approached and endeavored to soothe them. He\nspread them a couch of the long grass which grew near the\nencamping-place, offered them a portion of his own stock of dried meat\nand parched corn, and gave them to understand by signs that no farther\nevil was intended them.",
        "These kindly demonstrations were interrupted by the arrival of another\nparty of the enemy, bringing with them the mother of the little\nprisoners, with her youngest child, an infant of three months old.",
        "It had so happened that the father of the family, with his serving-men,\nhad gone early in the day to a raising at a few miles’ distance, and\nthe house had thus been left without a defender. The long period of\ntranquillity which they had enjoyed, free from all molestation or alarm\nfrom the savages, had thrown the settlers quite off their guard, and\nthey had recently laid aside some of the caution they had formerly\ndeemed necessary.",
        "These Indians, by lying in wait, had found the favorable moment for\nseizing the defenceless family and making them prisoners. Judging from\ntheir paint, and other marks by which the early settlers learned to\ndistinguish the various tribes, Mrs. Lytle conjectured that those into\nwhose hands she and her children had fallen were Senecas. Nor was she\nmistaken. It was a party of that tribe who had descended from their\nvillage with the intention of falling upon some isolated band of their\nenemies, the Delawares, but failing in this, had made themselves amends\nby capturing a few white settlers.",
        "It is to be attributed to the generally mild disposition of this tribe,\ntogether with the magnanimous character of the chief who accompanied the\nparty, that their prisoners in the present instance escaped the fate of\nmost of the Americans who were so unhappy as to fall into the hands of\nthe Iroquois.",
        "The children learned from their mother that she was profoundly ignorant\nof the fate of their remaining brother and sister, a boy of six and a\nlittle girl of four years of age, but she was in hopes they had made\ngood their escape with the servant-girl, who had likewise disappeared\nfrom the commencement.",
        "After remaining a few hours to recruit the exhausted frames of the\nprisoners, the savages again started on their march, one of the older\nIndians offering to relieve the mother from the burden of her infant,\nwhich she had hitherto carried in her arms. Pleased with the unexpected\nkindness, she resigned to him her tender charge.",
        "Thus they pursued their way, the savage who carried the infant lingering\nsomewhat behind the rest of the party, until, finding a spot convenient\nfor his purpose, he grasped his innocent victim by the feet, and, with\none whirl, to add strength to the blow, dashed out its brains against a\ntree. Leaving the body upon the spot, he rejoined the party.",
        "The mother, unsuspicious of what had passed, regarded him earnestly as\nhe reappeared without the child–then gazed wildly around on the rest of\nthe group. Her beloved little one was not there. Its absence spoke its\nfate; but, suppressing the shriek of agony, for she knew that the lives\nof the remaining ones depended upon her firmness in that trying hour,\nshe drew them yet closer to her and pursued her melancholy way without a\nword spoken or a question asked.",
        "From the depths of her heart she cried unto Him who is able to save, and\nHe comforted her with hopes of deliverance for the surviving ones, for\nshe saw that if blood had been their sole object the scalps of herself\nand her children would have been taken upon the spot where they were\nmade prisoners.",
        "She read too in the eyes of one who was evidently the commander of the\nparty an expression more merciful than she had even dared to hope.\nParticularly had she observed his soothing manner and manifest\npartiality towards her eldest child, the little girl of whom we have\nspoken, and she built many a bright hope of escape or ransom upon these\nslender foundations.",
        "After a toilsome and painful march of many days, the party reached the\nSeneca village, upon the head-waters of the Alleghany, near what is now\ncalled Olean Point. On their arrival the chief, their conductor, who was\ndistinguished by the name of the Big White Man[42] led his prisoners\nto the principal lodge. This was occupied by his mother, the widow of\nthe head-chief of that band, and who was called by them the Old Queen.",
        "On entering her presence, her son presented her the little girl,\nsaying,–",
        "“My mother, I bring you a child to supply the place of my brother, who\nwas killed by the Lenape six moons ago. She shall dwell in my lodge, and\nbe to me a sister. Take the white woman and her children and treat them\nkindly–our father will give us many horses and guns to buy them back\nagain.”",
        "He referred to the British Indian Agent of his tribe, Colonel Johnson,\nan excellent and benevolent gentleman, who resided at Port Niagara, on\nthe British side of the river of that name.",
        "The old queen fulfilled the injunctions of her son. She received the\nprisoners, and every comfort was provided them that her simple and\nprimitive mode of life rendered possible.",
        "We must now return to the place and period at which our story commences.",
        "Late in the evening of that day the father returned to his dwelling. All\nwithin and around was silent and desolate. No trace of a living creature\nwas to be found throughout the house or grounds. His nearest neighbors\nlived at a considerable distance, but to them he hastened, frantically\ndemanding tidings of his family.",
        "As he aroused them from their slumbers, one and another joined him in\nthe search, and at length, at the house of one of them, was found the\nservant-maid who had effected her escape. Her first place of refuge, she\nsaid, had been a large brewing-tub in an outer kitchen, under which she\nhad, at the first alarm, secreted herself until the departure of the\nIndians, who were evidently in haste, gave her an opportunity of fleeing\nto a place of safety. She could give no tidings of her mistress and the\nchildren, except that they had not been murdered in her sight or\nhearing.",
        "At length, having scoured the neighborhood without success, Mr. Lytle\nremembered an old settler who lived alone, far up the valley. Thither he\nand his friends immediately repaired, and from him they learned that,\nbeing at work in his field just before sunset, he had seen a party of\nstrange Indians passing at a short distance from his cabin. As they\nwound along the brow of the hill, he could perceive that they had\nprisoners with them–a woman and a child. The woman he knew to be a\nwhite, as she carried her infant in her arms, instead of upon her back,\nafter the manner of the savages.",
        "Day had now begun to break, for the night had been passed in fruitless\nsearches, and the agonized father, after a consultation with his kind\nfriends and neighbors, accepted their offer to accompany him to Fort\nPitt to ask advice and assistance of the commandant and Indian Agent at\nthat place.",
        "Proceeding down the valley, as they approached a hut which the night\nbefore they had found apparently deserted, they were startled by\nobserving two children standing upon the high bank in front of it. The\ndelighted father recognized two of his missing flock, but no tidings\ncould they give him of their mother and the other lost ones. Their story\nwas simple and touching.",
        "They were playing in the garden, when they were alarmed by seeing the\nIndians enter the yard near the house. Unperceived by them, the brother,\nwho was but six years of age, helped his little sister over the fence\ninto a field overrun with bushes of the blackberry and wild raspberry.\nThey concealed themselves among these for awhile, and then, finding all\nquiet, they attempted to force their way to the side of the field\nfarthest from the house. Unfortunately, the little girl in her play in\nthe garden had pulled off her shoes and stockings, and the briers\ntearing and wounding her tender feet, she with difficulty could refrain\nfrom crying out. Her brother took off his stockings and put them on her\nfeet. He attempted, too, to protect them with his shoes, but they were\ntoo large, and kept slipping off, so that she could not wear them. For a\ntime, they persevered in making what they considered their escape from\ncertain death, for, as I have said, the children had been taught, by the\ntales they had heard, to regard all strange Indians as ministers of\ntorture, and of horrors worse than death. Exhausted with pain and\nfatigue, the poor little girl at length declared she could go no\nfarther.",
        "“Then, Maggie,” said her brother, “I must kill you, for I cannot let\nyou be killed by the Indians.”",
        "“Oh, no, Thomas!” pleaded she, “do not, pray do not kill me! I do not\nthink the Indians will find us.”",
        "“Oh, yes, they will, Maggie, and I could kill you so much easier than\nthey would.’”",
        "For a long time he endeavored to persuade her, and even looked about for\na stick sufficiently large for his purpose; but despair gave the little\ncreature strength, and she promised her brother that she would neither\ncomplain nor falter, if he would assist her in making her way out of the\nfield.",
        "The idea of the little boy that he could save his sister from savage\nbarbarity by taking her life himself, shows what tales of horror the\nchildren of the early settlers were familiar with.",
        "After a few more efforts, they made their way out of the field, into an\nuninclosed pasture-ground, where, to their great delight, they saw some\ncows feeding. They recognized them as belonging to Granny Myers, an old\nwoman who lived at some little distance, but in what direction from the\nplace they then were, they were utterly ignorant.",
        "With a sagacity beyond his years, the boy said,–",
        "“Let us hide ourselves till sunset, when the cows will go home, and we\nwill follow them.”",
        "They did so, but, to their dismay, when they reached Granny Myers’s they\nfound the house deserted. The old woman had been called by some business\ndown the valley, and did not return that night.",
        "Tired and hungry, they could go no farther, but, after an almost\nfruitless endeavor to get some milk from the cows, they laid themselves\ndown to sleep under an old bedstead that stood behind the house. Their\nfather and his party had caused them additional terror in the night. The\nshouts and calls which had been designed to arouse the inmates of the\nhouse, they had mistaken for the whoop of the Indians, and, not being\nable to distinguish friends from foes, they had crept close to one\nanother, as far out of sight as possible. When found the following\nmorning, they were debating what course to take next, for safety.",
        "The commandant at Fort Pitt entered warmly into the affairs of Mr.\nLytle, and readily furnished him with a detachment of soldiers, to aid\nhim and his friends in the pursuit of the marauders. Some circumstances\nhaving occurred to throw suspicion upon the Senecas, the party soon\ndirected their search among the villages of that tribe.",
        "Their inquiries were prosecuted in various directions, and always with\ngreat caution, for all the tribes of the Iroquois, or, as they pompously\ncalled themselves, the Five Nations, being allies of Great Britain, were\ninveterate in their hostility to the Americans. Thus, some time elapsed\nbefore the father with his attendants reached the village of the Big\nWhite Man.",
        "A treaty was immediately entered into for the ransom of the captives,\nwhich was easily accomplished in regard to Mrs. Lytle and the younger\nchild. But no offers, no entreaties, no promises, could procure the\nrelease of the little Eleanor, the adopted child of the tribe. “No,” the\nchief said, “she was his sister; he had taken her to supply the place of\nhis brother who was killed by the enemy–she was dear to him, and he\nwould not part with her.”",
        "Finding every effort unavailing to shake this resolution, the father was\ncompelled to take his sorrowful departure with such of his beloved ones\nas he had had the good fortune to recover.",
        "We will not attempt to depict the grief of parents compelled thus to\ngive up a darling child, and to leave her in the hands of savages, whom\nuntil now they had too much reason to regard as merciless. But there was\nno alternative. Commending her to the care of their heavenly Father, and\ncheered by the manifest tenderness with which she had thus far been\ntreated, they set out on their melancholy journey homeward, trusting\nthat some future effort would be more effectual for the recovery of\ntheir little girl.",
        "Having placed his family in safety at Pittsburg, Mr. Lytle, still\nassisted by the commandant and the Indian Agent, undertook an expedition\nto the frontier to the residence of the British Agent, Colonel Johnson.\nHis representation of the case warmly interested the feelings of that\nbenevolent officer, who promised him to spare no exertions in his\nbehalf. This promise he religiously performed. He went in person to the\nvillage of the Big White Man, as soon as the opening of the spring\npermitted, and offered him many splendid presents of guns and horses,\nbut the chief was inexorable.",
        "Time rolled on, and every year the hope of recovering the little captive\nbecame more faint. She, in the mean time, continued to wind herself more\nand more closely around the heart of her Indian brother. Nothing could\nexceed the consideration and affection with which she was treated, not\nonly by himself, but by his mother, the Old Queen. All their stock of\nbrooches and wampum was employed in the decoration of her person. The\nprincipal seat and the most delicate viands were invariably reserved for\nher, and no efforts were spared to promote her happiness, and to render\nher forgetful of her former home and kindred.",
        "Thus, though she had beheld, with a feeling almost amounting to despair,\nthe departure of her parents and dear little brother, and had for a long\ntime resisted every attempt at consolation, preferring even death to a\nlife of separation from all she loved, yet time, as it ever does,\nbrought its soothing balm, and she at length grew contented and happy.",
        "From her activity and the energy of her character, qualities for which\nshe was remarkable to the latest period of her life, the name was given\nher of The Ship under full sail.",
        "The only drawback to the happiness of the little prisoner, aside from\nher longings after her own dear home, was the enmity she encountered\nfrom the wife of the Big White Man. This woman, from the day of her\narrival at the village, and adoption into the family as a sister, had\nconceived for her the greatest animosity, which, at first, she had the\nprudence to conceal from the observation of her husband.",
        "It was perhaps natural that a wife should give way to some feelings of\njealousy at seeing her own place in the heart of her husband usurped by\nthe child of their enemy, the American. But these feelings were\naggravated by a bad and vindictive temper, and by the indifference with\nwhich her husband listened to her complaints and murmurings.",
        "As she had no children of her own to engage her attention, her mind was\nthe more engrossed and inflamed with her fancied wrongs, and with\ndevising means for their redress. An opportunity of attempting the\nlatter was not long wanting.",
        "During the absence of the Big White Man upon some war-party or\nhunting-excursion, his little sister was taken ill with fever and ague.\nShe was nursed with the utmost tenderness by the Old Queen; and the wife\nof the chief, to lull suspicion, and thereby accomplish her purpose,\nwas likewise unwearied in her assiduities to the little favorite.",
        "One afternoon, during the temporary absence of the Old Queen, her\ndaughter-in-law entered the lodge with a bowl of something she had\nprepared, and, stooping down to the mat on which the child lay, said, in\nan affectionate accent,–",
        "“Drink, my sister, I have brought you that which will drive this fever\nfar from you.”",
        "On raising her head to reply, the little girl perceived a pair of eyes\npeeping through a crevice in the lodge, and fixed upon her with a very\npeculiar and significant expression. With the quick perception acquired\npartly from nature and partly from her intercourse with this people, she\nreplied, faintly,–",
        "“Set it down, my sister. When this fit of the fever has passed, I will\ndrink your medicine.”",
        "The squaw, too cautious to use importunity, busied herself about in the\nlodge for a short time, then withdrew to another, near at hand.\nMeantime, the bright eyes continued peering through the opening, until\nthey had watched their object fairly out of sight; then a low voice, the\nvoice of a young friend and playfellow, spoke:",
        "“Do not drink that which your brother’s wife has brought you. She hates\nyou, and is only waiting an opportunity to rid herself of you. I have\nwatched her all the morning, and have seen her gathering the most deadly\nroots and herbs. I knew for whom they were intended, and came hither to\nwarn you.”",
        "“Take the bowl,” said the little invalid, “and carry it to my mother’s\nlodge.”",
        "This was accordingly done. The contents of the bowl were found to\nconsist principally of a decoction of the root of the May-apple, the\nmost deadly poison known among the Indians.",
        "It is not in the power of language to describe the indignation that\npervaded the little community when this discovery was made known. The\nsquaws ran to and fro, as is their custom when excited, each vying with\nthe other in heaping invectives upon the culprit. No further punishment\nwas, however, for the present inflicted upon her, but, the first burst\nof rage over, she was treated with silent abhorrence.",
        "The little patient was removed to the lodge of the Old Queen, and\nstrictly guarded, while her enemy was left to wander in silence and\nsolitude about the fields and woods, until the return of her husband\nshould determine her punishment.",
        "In a few days, the excursion being over, the Big White Man and his party\nreturned to the village. Contrary to the usual custom of savages, he did\nnot, in his first transport at learning the attempt on the life of his\nlittle sister, take summary vengeance on the offender. He contented\nhimself with banishing her from his lodge, never to return, and\ncondemning her to hoe corn in a distant part of the large field or\ninclosure which served the whole community for a garden.",
        "Although she would still show her vindictive disposition whenever, by\nchance, the little girl with her companions wandered into that vicinity,\nby striking at her with her hoe, or by some other spiteful\nmanifestation, yet she was either too well watched, or stood too much in\nawe of her former husband, to repeat the attempt upon his sister’s life.",
        "Four years had now elapsed since the capture of little Nelly. Her heart\nwas by nature warm and affectionate, so that the unbounded tenderness of\nthose she dwelt among had called forth a corresponding feeling in her\nheart. She regarded the chief and his mother with love and reverence,\nand had so completely learned their language and customs as almost to\nhave forgotten her own.",
        "So identified had she become with the tribe, that the remembrance of her\nhome and family had nearly faded from her memory; all but her\nmother–her mother, whom she had loved with a strength of affection\nnatural to her warm and ardent character, and to whom her heart still\nclung with a fondness that no time or change could destroy.",
        "The peace of 1783 between Great Britain and the United States now took\nplace. A general pacification of the Indian tribes was the consequence,\nand fresh hopes were renewed in the bosoms of Mr. and Mrs. Lytle.",
        "They removed with their family to Fort Niagara, near which, on the\nAmerican side, was the Great Council-Fire of the Senecas. Colonel\nJohnson readily undertook a fresh negotiation with the chief, but, in\norder to make sure every chance of success, he again proceeded in person\nto the village of the Big White Man.",
        "His visit was most opportune. It was the “Feast of the Green Corn,” when\nhe arrived among them. This observance, which corresponds so strikingly\nwith the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles that, together with other customs,\nit has led many to believe the Indian nations the descendants of the\nlost ten tribes of Israel, made it a season of general joy and\nfestivity. All other occupations were suspended to give place to social\nenjoyment in the open air or in arbors formed of the green branches of\nthe trees. Every one appeared in his gala-dress. That of the little\nadopted child consisted of a petticoat of blue broadcloth, bordered with\ngay-colored ribbons; a sack or upper garment of black silk, ornamented\nwith three rows of silver brooches, the centre ones from the throat to\nthe hem being of large size, and those from the shoulders down being no\nlarger than a shilling-piece, and set as closely as possible. Around\nher neck were innumerable strings of white and purple wampum–an Indian\nornament manufactured from the inner surface of the muscle-shell. Her\nhair was clubbed behind and loaded with beads of various colors.\nLeggings of scarlet cloth, and moccasins of deer-skin embroidered with\nporcupine-quills, completed her costume.",
        "Colonel Johnson was received with all the consideration due to his\nposition, and to the long friendship that had subsisted between him and\nthe tribe.",
        "Observing that the hilarity of the festival had warmed and opened all\nhearts, he took occasion in an interview with the chief to expatiate\nupon the parental affection which had led the father and mother of his\nlittle sister to give up their friends and home, and come hundreds of\nmiles away, in the single hope of sometimes looking upon and embracing\nher. The heart of the chief softened as he listened to this\nrepresentation, and he was induced to promise that at the Grand Council\nsoon to be held at Fort Niagara, on the British side of the river, he\nwould attend, bringing his little sister with him.",
        "He exacted a promise, however, from Colonel Johnson, that not only no\neffort should be made to reclaim the child, but that even no proposition\nto part with her should be offered him.",
        "The time at length arrived when, her heart bounding with joy, little\nNelly was placed on horseback to accompany her Indian brother to the\nGreat Council of the Senecas. She had promised him that she would never\nleave him without his permission, and he relied confidently on her word\nthus given.",
        "As the chiefs and warriors arrived in successive bands to meet their\nFather, the agent, at the council-fire, how did the anxious hearts of\nthe parents beat with alternate hope and fear! The officers of the fort\nhad kindly given them quarters for the time being, and the ladies, whose\nsympathies were strongly excited, had accompanied the mother to the\nplace of council, and joined in her longing watch for the first\nappearance of the band from the Alleghany River.",
        "At length they were discerned, emerging from the forest on the opposite\nor American side. Boats were sent across by the commanding officer, to\nbring the chief and his party. The father and mother, attended by all\nthe officers and ladies, stood upon the grassy bank awaiting their\napproach. They had seen at a glance that the little captive was with\nthem.",
        "When about to enter the boat, the chief said to some of his young men,\n\"Stand here with the horses, and wait until I return.”",
        "He was told that the horses should be ferried across and taken care of.",
        "“No,” said he; “let them wait.”",
        "He held his darling by the hand until the river was passed–until the\nboat touched the bank–until the child sprang forward into the arms of\nthe mother from whom she had been so long separated.",
        "When the chief witnessed that outburst of affection, he could withstand\nno longer.",
        "“She shall go,” said he. “The mother must have her child again. I will\ngo back alone.”",
        "With one silent gesture of farewell he turned and stepped on board the\nboat. No arguments or entreaties could induce him to remain at the\ncouncil, but, having gained the other side of the Niagara, he mounted\nhis horse, and with his young men was soon lost in the depths of the\nforest.",
        "After a sojourn of a few weeks at Niagara, Mr. Lytle, dreading lest the\nresolution of the Big White Man should give way, and measures be taken\nto deprive him once more of his child, came to the determination of\nagain changing his place of abode. He therefore took the first\nopportunity of crossing Lake Erie with his family, and settled himself\nin the neighborhood of Detroit, where he continued afterwards to reside.",
        "Little Nelly saw her friend the chief no more, but she never forgot\nhim. To the day of her death she remembered with tenderness and\ngratitude her brother the Big White Man, and her friends and playfellows\namong the Senecas.",
        "At the age of fourteen the heroine of the foregoing story married\nColonel McKillip, a British officer. This gentleman was killed near Fort\nDefiance, as it was afterwards called, at the Miami Rapids, in 1794. A\ndetachment of British troops had been sent down from Detroit to take\npossession of this post. General Wayne was then on a campaign against\nthe Indians, and the British Government thought proper to make a few\ndemonstrations in behalf of their allies. Having gone out with a party\nto reconnoitre, Colonel McKillip was returning to his post after dark,\nwhen he was fired upon and killed by one of his own sentinels. Mrs. Helm\nwas the daughter of this marriage.",
        "During the widowhood of Mrs. McKillip, she resided with her parents, at\nGrosse Pointe, eight miles above Detroit, and it was during this period\nthat an event occurred which, from the melancholy and mysterious\ncircumstances attending it, was always dwelt upon by her with peculiar\ninterest.",
        "Her second brother, Thomas Lytle, was, from his amiable and affectionate\ncharacter, the most dearly beloved by her of all the numerous family\ncircle. He was paying his addresses to a young lady who resided at the\nriver Trench,[43] as it was then called, now the river Thames, a stream\nemptying into Lake St. Clair about twenty miles above Detroit. In\nvisiting this young lady, it was his custom to cross the Detroit River\nby the ferry with his horse, and then proceed by land to the river\nTrench, which was, at some seasons of the year, a fordable stream.",
        "On a fine forenoon, late in the spring, he had taken leave of his mother\nand sister for one of these periodical visits, which were usually of two\nor three days’ duration.",
        "After dinner, as his sister was sitting at work by an open window which\nlooked upon a little side inclosure filled with fruit-trees, she was\nstartled by observing some object opposite the window, between her and\nthe light. She raised her eyes and saw her brother Thomas. He was\nwithout his horse, and carried his saddle upon his shoulders.",
        "Surprised that she had not heard the gate opening for his entrance, and\nalso at his singular appearance, laden in that manner, she addressed\nhim, and inquired what had happened, and why he had returned so soon. He\nmade her no reply, but looked earnestly in her face, as he moved slowly\nalong the paved walk that led to the stables.",
        "She waited a few moments, expecting he would reappear to give an account\nof himself and his adventures, but at length, growing impatient at his\ndelay, she put down her work and went towards the rear of the house to\nfind him.",
        "The first person she met was her mother. “Have you seen Thomas?” she\ninquired.",
        "“Thomas! He has gone to the river Trench.”",
        "“No, he has returned–I saw him pass the window not fifteen minutes\nsince.”",
        "“Then he will be in presently.”",
        "His sister, however, could not wait. She proceeded to the stables, she\nsearched in all directions. No Thomas–no horse–no saddle. She made\ninquiry of the domestics. No one had seen him. She then returned and\ntold her mother what had happened.",
        "“You must have fallen asleep and dreamed it,” said her mother.",
        "“No, indeed! I was wide awake–I spoke to him, and he gave me no answer,\nbut such a look!”",
        "All the afternoon she felt an uneasiness she could not reason herself\nout of.",
        "The next morning came a messenger from the river Trench with dismal\ntidings.",
        "The bodies of the young man and his horse had been found drowned a short\ndistance below the ford of the river.",
        "It appeared that, on arriving at the bank of the river, he found it\nswollen beyond its usual depth by the recent rains. It being necessary\nto swim the stream with his horse, he had taken off his clothes and made\nthem into a packet which he fastened upon his shoulders. It was supposed\nthat the strength of the rapid torrent displaced the bundle, which thus\nserved to draw his head under water and keep it there, without the power\nof raising it. All this was gathered from the position and appearance of\nthe bodies when found.",
        "From the time at which he had been seen passing a house which stood near\nthe stream, on his way to the ford, it was evident that he must have\nmet his fate at the very moment his sister saw, or thought she saw him,\npassing before her.",
        "I could not but suggest the inquiry, when these sad particulars were\nnarrated to me,–",
        "“Mother, is it not possible this might have been a dream?”",
        "“A dream? No, indeed, my child. I was perfectly wide awake–as much so\nas I am at this moment. I am not superstitious. I have never believed in\nghosts or witches, but nothing can ever persuade me that this was not a\nwarning sent from God, to prepare me for my brother’s death.”",
        "And those who knew her rational good sense–her freedom from fancies or\nfears, and the calm self-possession that never deserted her under the\nmost trying circumstances–would almost be won to view the matter in the\nlight she did.",
        "The order for the evacuation of Port Dearborn, and the removal of the\ntroops to Fort Howard (Green Bay), had now been received. The family\ncircle was to be broken up. Our mother, our sister Mrs. Helm, and her\nlittle son, were to return with us to Fort Winnebago; the other members\nof the family, except Robert, were to move with the command to Green\nBay.",
        "The schooner Napoleon was to be sent from Detroit to convey the troops\nwith their goods and chattels to their destined post. Our immediate\nparty was to make the journey by land–we were to choose, however, a\nshorter and pleasanter route than the one we had taken in coming hither.\nMy husband, with his Frenchmen, Petaille Grignon and Simon Lecuyer, had\narrived, and all hands were now busily occupied with the necessary\npreparations for breaking up and removal.",
        "I should be doing injustice to the hospitable settlers of Hickory Creek\nwere I to pass by without notice an entertainment with which they\nhonored our Chicago beaux about this time. The merry-making was to be a\nball, and the five single gentlemen of Chicago were invited. Mr. Dole,\nwho was a new-comer, declined; Lieutenant Foster was on duty, but he did\nwhat was still better than accepting the invitation, he loaned his\nbeautiful horse to Medard Beaubien, who with Robert Kinzie and Gholson\nKercheval promised himself much fun in eclipsing the beaux and creating\na sensation among the belles of Hickory Creek.",
        "Chicago was then, as now, looked upon as the City par excellence. Its\nfew inhabitants were supposed to have seen something of the world, and\nit is to be inferred that the arrival of the smart and dashing young men\nwas an event looked forward to with more satisfaction by the fair of the\nlittle settlement than by the swains whose rivals they might become.",
        "The day arrived, and the gentlemen set off in high spirits. They took\ncare to be in good season, for the dancing was to commence at two\no’clock in the afternoon. They were well mounted, each priding himself\nupon the animal he rode, and they wore their best suits, as became city\ngallants who were bent on cutting out their less fashionable neighbors\nand breaking the hearts of the admiring country damsels.",
        "When they arrived at the place appointed, they were received with great\npoliteness–their steeds were taken care of, and a dinner was provided\nthem, after which they were ushered into the dancing-hall.",
        "All the beauty of the neighboring precincts was assembled. The ladies\nwere for the most part white, or what passed for such, with an\noccasional dash of copper color. There was no lack of bombazet gowns and\nlarge white pocket-handkerchiefs, perfumed with oil of cinnamon; and as\nthey took their places in long rows on the puncheon floor, they were a\nmerry and a happy company.",
        "But the city gentlemen grew more and more gallant–the girls more and\nmore delighted with their attentions–the country swains, alas! more and\nmore scowling and jealous. In vain they pigeon-winged and\ndouble-shuffled–in vain they nearly dislocated hips and shoulders at\n\"hoe corn and dig potatoes\"–they had the mortification to perceive that\nthe smart young sprigs from Chicago had their “pick and choose” among\ntheir very sweethearts, and that they themselves were fairly danced off\nthe ground.",
        "The revelry lasted until daylight, and it was now time to think of\nreturning. There was no one ready with obliging politeness to bring them\ntheir horses from the stable.",
        "“Poor fellows!” said one of the party, with a compassionate sort of\nlaugh, “they could not stand it. They have gone home to bed!”",
        "“Serves them right,” said another; “they’d better not ask us down among\ntheir girls again!”",
        "They groped their way to the stable and went in. There were some animals\nstanding at the manger, but evidently not their horses. What could they\nbe? Had the rogues been trying to cheat them, by putting these strange\nnondescripts into their place?",
        "They led them forth into the gray of the morning, and then–such a trio\nas met their gaze!",
        "There were the original bodies, it is true, but where were their manes\nand tails? A scrubby, pickety ridge along the neck, and a bare stump\nprojecting behind, were all that remained of the flowing honors with\nwhich they had come gallivanting down to “bear away the bell” at\nHickory Creek, or, in the emphatic language of the country, “to take the\nrag off the bush.”",
        "Gholson sat down on a log and cried outright. Medard took the matter\nmore philosophically–the horse was none of his–it was Lieutenant\nFoster’s.",
        "Robert characteristically looked around to see whom he could knock down\non the occasion; but there was no one visible on whom to wreak their\nvengeance.",
        "The bumpkins had stolen away, and, in some safe, quiet nook, were snugly\nenjoying their triumph, and doubtless the deceitful fair ones were by\nthis time at their sides, sharing their mirth and exultation.",
        "The unlucky gallants mounted their steeds, and set their faces homeward.\nNever was there a more crestfallen and sorry-looking cavalcade. The poor\nhorses seemed to realize that they had met the same treatment as the\nmessengers of King David at the hands of the evil-disposed Hanun. They\nhung their heads, and evidently wished that they could have “tarried at\nJericho” for a season. Unfortunately, there was in those days no back\nway by which they could steal in, unobserved. Across the prairie, in\nview of the whole community, must their approach be made; and to add to\ntheir confusion, in the rarity of stirring events, it was the custom of\nthe whole settlement to turn out and welcome the arrival of any\nnew-comer.",
        "As hasty a retreat as possible was beaten, amid the shouts, the jeers,\nand the condolences of their acquaintances; and it is on record that\nthese three young gentlemen were in no hurry to accept, at any future\ntime, an invitation to partake of the festivities of Hickory Creek.",
        "In due time the Napoleon made her appearance. (Alas that this great\nname should be used in the feminine gender!) As there was at this period\nno harbor, vessels anchored outside the bar, or tongue of land which\nformed the left bank of the river, and the lading and unlading were\ncarried on by boats, pulling in and out, through the mouth of the river,\nsome distance below.",
        "Of course it always was a matter of great importance to get a vessel\nloaded as quickly as possible, that she might be ready to take advantage\nof the first fair wind, and be off from such an exposed and hazardous\nanchoring-ground.",
        "For this reason we had lived packed up for many days, intending only\nto see our friends safe on board, and then commence our own journey back\nto Fort Winnebago.",
        "Our heavy articles of furniture, trunks, etc. had been sent on board the\nNapoleon, to be brought round to us by way of Fox River. We had retained\nonly such few necessaries as could be conveniently carried on a\npack-horse, and in a light dearborn wagon lately brought by Mr.\nKercheval from Detroit (the first luxury of the kind ever seen on the\nprairies), and which my husband had purchased as an agreeable mode of\nconveyance for his mother and little nephew.",
        "It was a matter requiring no small amount of time and labor to\ntransport, in the slow method described, the effects of so many families\nof officers and soldiers, with the various etceteras incident to a total\nchange and removal. It was all, however, happily\naccomplished–everything, even to the last article, sent on\nboard–nothing remaining on shore but the passengers, whose turn it\nwould be next.",
        "It was a moment of great relief; for Captain Hinckley had been in a\nfever and a fuss many hours, predicting a change of weather, and\nmurmuring at what he thought the unnecessary amount of boat-loads to be\ntaken on board.",
        "Those who had leisure to be looking out towards the schooner, which had\ncontinued anchored about half a mile out in the lake, had, at this\ncrisis, the satisfaction to see her hoist sail and leave her station for\nthe open lake; those who were a little later could just discern her\nbearing away to a distance, as if she had got all on board that she had\nany idea of taking. Here we were, and here we might remain a week or\nmore, if it so pleased Captain Hinckley and the schooner Napoleon, and\nthe good east wind which was blowing with all its might.",
        "There was plenty of provisions to be obtained, so the fear of starvation\nwas not the trouble; but how were the cooking and the table to be\nprovided for? Various expedients were resorted to. Mrs. Engle, in her\nquarters above-stairs, ate her breakfast off a shingle with her\nhusband’s jack-knife, and when she had finished, sent them down to\nLieutenant Foster for his accommodation.",
        "We were at the old mansion on the north side, and the news soon flew up\nthe river that the Napoleon had gone off with “the plunder” and left the\npeople behind. It was not long before we were supplied by Mrs. Portier\n(our kind Victoire) with dishes, knives, forks, and all the other\nconveniences which our mess-basket failed to supply.",
        "This state of things lasted a couple of days, and then, early one fine\nmorning, the gratifying intelligence spread like wild-fire that the\nNapoleon was at anchor out beyond the bar.",
        "There was no unnecessary delay this time, and at an early hour in the\nafternoon we had taken leave of our dear friends, and they were sailing\naway from Chicago.[44]",
        "A great part of the command, with the cattle belonging to the officers\nand soldiers, had, a day or two previous to the time of our departure,\nset out on their march by land to Green Bay, via Fort Winnebago.\nLieutenant Foster, under whose charge they were, had lingered behind\nthat he might have the pleasure of joining our party, and we, in turn,\nhad delayed in order to see the other members of our family safely on\nboard the Napoleon. But now, all things being ready, we set our faces\nonce more homeward.",
        "We took with us a little bound-girl, Josette, a bright, pretty child\nof ten years of age, a daughter of Ouilmette, a Frenchman who had lived\nhere at the time of the Massacre, and of a Pottowattamie mother. She had\nbeen at the St. Joseph’s mission-school, under Mr. McCoy, and she was\nnow full of delight at the prospect of a journey all the way to the\nPortage with Monsieur and Madame John.",
        "We had also a negro boy, Harry, brought a year before from Kentucky, by\nMr. Kercheval. In the transfer at that time from a slave State to a free\none, Harry’s position became somewhat changed–he could be no more than\nan indentured servant. He was about to become a member of Dr. Wolcott’s\nhousehold, and it was necessary for him to choose a guardian. All this\nwas explained to him on his being brought into the parlor, where the\nfamily were assembled. My husband was then a young man, on a visit to\nhis home. “Now, Harry,” it was said to him, “you must choose your\nguardian;” and the natural expectation was that Harry would select the\nperson of his acquaintance of the greatest age and dignity. But, rolling\nround his great eyes, and hanging his head on one side, he said,–",
        "“I’ll have Master John for my guardian.”",
        "From that day forward Harry felt as if he belonged, in a measure, to\nMaster John, and at the breaking-up of the family in Chicago he was,\nnaturally, transferred to our establishment.",
        "There were three ladies of our travelling party–our mother, our sister\nMrs. Helm, and myself. To guard against the burning effect of the sun\nand the prairie winds upon our faces, I had, during some of the last\ndays of my visit, prepared for each of us a mask of brown linen, with\nthe eyes, nose, and mouth fitted to our features; and, to enhance their\nhideousness, I had worked eyebrows, eyelashes, and a circle around the\nopening for the mouth, in black silk. Gathered in plaits under the chin,\nand with strings to confine them above and below, they furnished a\ncomplete protection against the sun and wind, though nothing can be\nimagined more frightful than the appearance we presented when fully\nequipped. It was who should be called the ugliest.",
        "We left amid the good wishes and laughter of our few remaining\nacquaintances. Our wagon had been provided with a pair of excellent\ntravelling horses, and, sister Margaret and myself being accommodated\nwith the best pacers the country could afford, we set off in high\nspirits towards the Aux Plaines–our old friend, Billy Caldwell (the\nSau-ga-nash), with our brother Robert, and Gholson Kercheval,\naccompanying us to that point of our journey.",
        "There was no one at Barney Lawton’s when we reached there, save a\nFrenchman and a small number of Indians. My sister and I dismounted, and\nentered the dwelling, the door of which stood open. Two Indians were\nseated on the floor, smoking. They raised their eyes as we appeared, and\nnever shall I forget the expression of wonder and horror depicted on the\ncountenances of both. Their lips relaxed until the pipe of one fell upon\nthe floor. Their eyes seemed starting from their heads, and raising\ntheir outspread hands, as if to wave us from them, they slowly\nejaculated, ’Manitou!” (a spirit.)",
        "As we raised our masks, and, smiling, came forward to shake hands with\nthem, they sprang to their feet and fairly uttered a cry of delight at\nthe sight of our familiar faces.",
        "“Bon-jour, bon-jour, Maman!” was their salutation, and they instantly\nplunged out of doors to relate to their companions what had happened.",
        "Our afternoon’s ride was over a prairie stretching away to the northeast\nNo living creature was to be seen upon its broad expanse, but flying and\ncircling over our heads were innumerable flocks of curlews,",
        "“Screaming their wild notes to the listening waste.”",
        "Their peculiar, shrill cry of “crack, crack, crack–rackety, rackety,\nrackety,” repeated from the throats of dozens, as they sometimes stooped\nquite close to our ears, became at length almost unbearable. It seemed\nas if they had lost their senses in the excitement of so unusual and\nsplendid a cortége in their hitherto desolate domain.",
        "The accelerated pace of our horses, as we approached a beautiful,\nwooded knoll, warned us that this was to be our place of repose for the\nnight. These animals seem to know by instinct a favorable\nencamping-ground, and this was one of the most lovely imaginable.",
        "The trees, which near the lake had, owing to the coldness and tardiness\nof the season, presented the pale-yellow appearance of unfledged\ngoslings, were here bursting into full leaf. The ground around was\ncarpeted with flowers–we could not bear to have them crushed by the\nfelling of a tree and the pitching of our tent among them. The birds\nsent forth their sweetest notes in the warm, lingering sunlight, and the\nopening buds of the young hickory and sassafras filled the air with\nperfume.",
        "Nothing could be more perfect than our enjoyment of this sylvan and\nbeautiful retreat[45] after our ride in the glowing sun. The children\nwere in ecstasies. They delighted to find ways of making themselves\nuseful–to pile up the saddles–to break boughs for the fire–to fill\nthe little kettles with water for Petaille and Lecuyer, the Frenchmen,\nwho were preparing our supper.",
        "Their amusement at the awkward movements of the horses after they were\nspancelled knew no bounds. To our little nephew Edwin everything was\nnew, and Josette, who had already made more than one horseback journey\nto St. Joseph, manifested all the pride of an old traveller in\nexplaining to him whatever was novel or unaccountable.",
        "They were not the last to spring up at the call “how! how!” on the\nfollowing morning.",
        "The fire was replenished, the preparations for breakfast commenced, and\nthe Frenchmen dispatched to bring up the horses in readiness for an\nearly start.",
        "Harry and Josette played their parts, under our direction, in preparing\nthe simple meal, and we soon seated ourselves, each with cup and knife,\naround the table-mat. The meal was over, but no men, no horses\nappeared. When another half-hour had passed, my husband took Harry and\ncommenced exploring in search of the missing ones.",
        "The day wore on, and first one and then another would make his\nappearance to report progress. Petaille and Lecuyer at length brought\ntwo of the horses, but the others could nowhere be found. In time, Mr.\nKinzie and Harry returned, wet to their knees by the dew upon the long\nprairie-grass, but with no tidings. Again the men were dispatched after\nhaving broken their fast, but returned unsuccessful as before.",
        "The morning had been passed by our party at the encampment in\nspeculating upon the missing animals. Could they have been stolen by the\nIndians? Hardly: these people seldom committed robberies in time of\npeace–never upon our family, whom they regarded as their best friends.\nThe horses would doubtless be found. They had probably been carelessly\nfastened the preceding evening, and had therefore been able to stray\nfarther than was their wont.",
        "A council was held, at which it was decided to send Grignon back to\nChicago to get some fresh horses from Gholson Kercheval, and return as\nspeedily as possible. If on his return our encampment were deserted, he\nmight conclude we had found the horses and proceeded to Fox River, where\nhe would doubtless overtake us.",
        "He had not been gone more than an hour before, slowly hopping out of a\npoint of woods to the north of us (a spot which each of the seekers\naverred he had explored over and over again), and making directly for\nthe place where we were, appeared the vexatious animals. They came up\nas demurely as if nothing had happened, and seemed rather surprised to\nbe received with a hearty scolding, instead of being patted and caressed\nas usual.",
        "It was the work of a very short half-hour to strike and pack the tent,\nstow away the mats and kettles, saddle the horses, and mount for our\njourney.",
        "“Whoever pleases may take my place in the carriage,” said our mother. “I\nhave travelled so many years on horseback, that I find any other mode of\nconveyance too fatiguing.”",
        "So, spite of her sixty years, she mounted sister Margaret’s pacer with\nthe activity of a girl of sixteen.",
        "Lieutenant Foster had left us early in the morning, feeling it necessary\nto rejoin his command, and now, having seen us ready to set off, with a\nserene sky above us, and all things “right and tight” for the journey,\nour friend the Sau-ga-nash took leave of us, and retraced his steps\ntowards Chicago.",
        "We pursued our way through a lovely country of alternate glade and\nforest, until we reached the Fox River. The current ran clear and\nrippling along, and, as we descended the steep bank to the water, the\nquestion, so natural to a traveller in an unknown region, presented\nitself, “Is it fordable?”",
        "Petaille, to whom the ground was familiar, had not yet made his\nappearance Lecuyer was quite ignorant upon the subject. The troops had\nevidently preceded us by this very trail. True, but they were on\nhorseback–the difficulty was, could we get the carriage through? It\nmust be remembered that the doubt was not about the depth of the water,\nbut about the hardness of the bottom of the stream.",
        "It was agreed that two or three of the equestrians should make the\ntrial first. My mother, Lecuyer, and myself advanced cautiously across\nto the opposite bank, each choosing a different point for leaving the\nwater, in order to find the firmest spot. The bottom was hard and firm\nuntil we came near the shore; then it yielded a little. With one step,\nhowever, we were each on dry ground.",
        "“Est-il beau?” called my husband, who was driving.",
        "“Oui, monsieur.”",
        "“Yes, John, come just here, it is perfectly good.”",
        "“No, no–go a little farther down. See the white gravel just there–it\nwill be firmer still, there.”",
        "Such were the contradictory directions given. He chose the latter, and\nwhen it wanted but one step more to the bank, down sunk both horses,\nuntil little more than their backs were visible.",
        "The white gravel proved to be a bed of treacherous yellow clay, which,\ngleaming through the water, had caused so unfortunate a deception.",
        "With frantic struggles, for they were nearly suffocated with mud and\nwater, the horses made desperate efforts to free themselves from the\nharness. My husband sprang out upon the pole. “Some one give me a\nknife,” he cried. I was back in the water in a moment, and, approaching\nas near as I dared, handed him mine from the scabbard around my neck.",
        "“Whatever you do, do not cut the traces,” cried his mother.",
        "He severed some of the side-straps, when, just as he had reached the\nextremity of the pole, and was stretching forward to separate the\nhead-couplings, one of the horses gave a furious plunge, which caused\nhis fellow to rear, and throw himself nearly backwards. My husband was\nbetween them. For a moment we thought he was gone–trampled down by the\nexcited animals; but he presently showed himself, nearly obscured by the\nmud and water. With the agility of a cat, Harry, who was near him, now\nsprang forward on the pole, and in an instant, with his sharp jack-knife\nwhich he had ready, divided the straps that confined their heads.",
        "The horses were at this moment lying floating on the water–one\napparently dead, the other as if gasping out his last breath. But hardly\ndid they become sensible of the release of their heads from bondage,\nthan they made, simultaneously, another furious effort to free\nthemselves from the pole, to which they were still attached by the\nneck-strap.",
        "Failing in this, they tried another expedient, and, by a few judicious\ntwists and turns, succeeded in wrenching the pole asunder, and finally\ncarried it off in triumph across the river again, and up the bank, where\nthey stood waiting to decide what were the next steps to be taken.",
        "Here was a predicament! A few hours before, we had thought ourselves\nuncomfortable enough, because some of our horses were missing. Now, a\ngreater evil had befallen us. The wagon was in the river, the harness\ncut to pieces, and, what was worse, carried off in the most independent\nmanner, by Tom and his companion; the pole was twisted to fragments, and\nthere was not so much as a stick on our side of the river with which to\nreplace it.",
        "At this moment, a whoop from the opposite bank, echoed by two or three\nhearty ones from our party, announced the reappearance of Petaille\nGrignon. He dismounted and took charge of the horses, who were resting\nthemselves after their fatigues under a shady tree, and by this time\nLecuyer had crossed the river, and now joined him in bringing back the\ndelinquents.",
        "In the mean time we had been doing our best to minister to our sister\nMargaret. She, with her little son Edwin, had been in the wagon at the\ntime of the accident, and it had been a work of some difficulty to get\nthem out and bring them on horseback to shore. The effect of the\nagitation and excitement was to throw her into a fit of the ague, and\nshe now lay blue and trembling among the long grass of the little\nprairie which extended along the bank. The tent, which had been packed\nin the rear of the wagon, was too much saturated with mud and water to\nadmit of its being used as a shelter; it could only be stretched in the\nsun to dry. We opened an umbrella over our poor sister’s head, and now\nbegan a discussion of ways and means to repair damages. The first thing\nwas to cut a new pole for the wagon, and for this, the master and men\nmust recross the river and choose an iron-tree out of the forest.",
        "Then, for the harness. With provident care, a little box had been placed\nunder the seat of the wagon, containing an awl, waxed ends, and various\nother little conveniences exactly suited to an emergency like the\npresent.",
        "It was question and answer, like Cock Robin:",
        "“Who can mend the harness?”",
        "“I can, for I learned when I was a young girl to make shoes as an\naccomplishment, and I can surely now, as a matter of usefulness and\nduty, put all those wet, dirty pieces of leather together.”",
        "So we all seated ourselves on the grass, under the shade of the only two\numbrellas we could muster.",
        "I stitched away diligently, blistering my hands, I must own, in no small\ndegree.",
        "A suitable young tree had been brought, and the hatchets, without which\none never travels in the woods, were busy fashioning it into shape, when\na peculiar hissing noise was heard, and instantly the cry,–",
        "“Un serpent sonnette! A rattlesnake!”",
        "All sprang to their feet, even the poor, shaking invalid, just in time\nto see the reptile glide past within three inches of my mother’s feet,\nwhile the men assailed the spot it had left with whips, missiles, and\nwhatever would help along the commotion.",
        "This little incident proved an excellent remedy for the ague. One\nexcitement drives away another, and by means of this (upon the\nhomoeopathic principle) sister Margaret was so much improved that by the\ntime all the mischiefs were repaired, she was ready to take her place in\nthe cavalcade, as bright and cheerful as the rest of us.",
        "So great had been the delay occasioned by all these untoward\ncircumstances, that our afternoon’s ride was but a short one, bringing\nus no farther than the shores of a beautiful sheet of water, now known\nas Crystal Lake. Its clear surface was covered with loons, and Poules\nd’Eau, a species of rail; with which, at certain seasons, this region\nabounds.",
        "The Indians have the genius of Aesop for depicting animal life and\ncharacter, and there is among them a fable or legend illustrative of\nevery peculiarity in the personal appearance, habits, or dispositions of\neach variety of the animal creation.",
        "The back of the little rail is very concave, or hollow. The Indians tell\nus that it became so in the following manner:–",
        "STORY OF THE LITTLE RAIL, OR Poule d’Eau\nThere is supposed, by most of the Northwestern tribes, to exist an\ninvisible being, corresponding to the “Genie” of Oriental story. Without\nbeing exactly the father of evil, Nan-nee-bo-zho is a spirit whose\noffice it is to punish what is amiss. He is represented, too, as\nconstantly occupied in entrapping and making examples of all the\nanimals that come in his way.",
        "One pleasant evening, as he walked along the banks of a lake, he saw a\nflock of ducks, sailing and enjoying themselves on the blue waters. He\ncalled to them:",
        "“Ho! come with me into my lodge, and I will teach you to dance!” Some of\nthe ducks said among themselves, “It is Nan-nee-bo-zho; let us not go.\"\nOthers were of a contrary opinion, and, his words being fair, and his\nvoice insinuating, a few turned their faces towards the land–all the\nrest soon followed, and, with many pleasant quackings, trooped after\nhim, and entered his lodge.",
        "When there, he first took an Indian sack, with a wide mouth, which he\ntied by the strings around his neck, so that it would hang over his\nshoulders, leaving the mouth unclosed. Then, placing himself in the\ncentre of the lodge, he ranged the ducks in a circle around him.",
        "“Now,” said he, “you must all shut your eyes tight; whoever opens his\neyes at all, something dreadful will happen to him. I will take my\nIndian flute and play upon it, and you will, at the word I shall give,\nopen your eyes, and commence dancing, as you see me do.”",
        "The ducks obeyed, shutting their eyes tight, and keeping time to the\nmusic by stepping from one foot to the other, all impatient for the\ndancing to begin.",
        "Presently a sound was heard like a smothered “quack,” but the ducks did\nnot dare to open their eyes.",
        "Again, and again, the sound of the flute would be interrupted, and a\ngurgling cry of “qu-a-a-ck” be heard. There was one little duck, much\nsmaller than the rest, who, at this juncture, could not resist the\ntemptation to open one eye, cautiously. She saw Nan-nee-bo-zho, as he\nplayed his flute, holding it with one hand, stoop a little at intervals\nand seize the duck nearest him, which he throttled and stuffed into the\nbag on his shoulders. So, edging a little out of the circle, and getting\nnearer the door, which had been left partly open, to admit the light,\nshe cried out,–",
        "“Open your eyes–Nan-nee-bo-zho is choking you all and putting you into\nhis bag!”",
        "With that she flew, but Nan-nee-bo-zho pounced upon her. His hand\ngrasped her back, yet, with desperate force, she released herself and\ngained the open air. Her companions flew, quacking and screaming, after\nher. Some escaped, and some fell victims to the sprite.",
        "The little duck had saved her life, but she had lost her beauty. She\never after retained the attitude she had been forced into in her moment\nof danger–her back pressed down in the centre, and her head and neck\nunnaturally stretched forward into the air.",
        "The third day of our journey rose brilliantly clear, like the two\npreceding ones, and we shaped our course more to the north than we had\nhitherto done, in the direction of Big-foot Lake, now known by the\nsomewhat hackneyed appellation, Lake of Geneva.",
        "Our journey this day was without mishaps or disasters of any kind. The\nair was balmy, the foliage of the forests fresh and fragrant, the little\nbrooks clear and sparkling–everything in nature spoke the praises of\nthe beneficent Creator.",
        "It is in scenes like this, far removed from the bustle, the strife, and\nthe sin of civilized life, that we most fully realize the presence of\nthe great Author of the Universe. Here can the mind most fully adore his\nmajesty and goodness, for here only is the command obeyed, “Let all the\nearth keep silence before Him!”",
        "It cannot escape observation that the deepest and most solemn devotion\nis in the hearts of those who, shut out from the worship of God in\ntemples made with hands, are led to commune with him amid the boundless\nmagnificence that his own power has framed.",
        "This day was not wholly without incident. As we stopped for our\nnoon-tide refreshment, and dismounting threw ourselves on the fresh\nherbage just at the verge of a pleasant thicket, we were startled by a\ntender bleating near us, and presently, breaking its way through the\nlow branches, there came upon us a sweet little dappled fawn, evidently\nin search of its mother. It did not seem in the least frightened at the\nsight of us. As poor Selkirk might have been parodied,–",
        "  It was so unacquainted with man,\n  Its tameness was charming to us.",
        "But the vociferous delight of the children soon drove it bounding again\ninto the woods, and all hopes of catching it for a pet were at once at\nan end.",
        "We had travelled well this day, and were beginning to feel somewhat\nfatigued, when, just before sunset, we came upon a ridge, overlooking\none of the loveliest little dells imaginable. It was an oak opening, and\nbrowsing under the shade of the tall trees which were scattered around\nwere the cattle and horses of the soldiers, who had got thus far on\ntheir journey. Two or three white tents were pitched in the bottom of\nthe valley, beside a clear stream. The camp-fires were already lighted,\nand the men, singly or in groups, were busied in their various\npreparations for their own comfort, or that of their animals.",
        "Lieutenant Foster came forward with great delight to welcome our\narrival, and accepted without hesitation an invitation to join our mess\nagain, as long as we should be together.",
        "We soon found a pleasant encamping-ground, far enough removed from the\nother party to secure us against all inconvenience, and our supper\nhaving received the addition of a kettle of fine fresh milk, kindly\nbrought us by Mrs. Gardiner, the hospital matron, who with her little\ncovered cart formed no unimportant feature in the military group, we\npartook of our evening meal with much hilarity and enjoyment.",
        "If people are ever companionable, it is when thrown together under\ncircumstances like the present. There has always been sufficient\nincident through the day to furnish themes for discourse, and subjects\nof merriment, as long as the company feel disposed for conversation,\nwhich is, truth to tell, not an unconscionable length of time after\ntheir supper is over.",
        "The poor Lieutenant looked grave enough when we set out in advance of\nhim the next morning. None of his party were acquainted with the road;\nbut, after giving him directions both general and particular, Mr. Kinzie\npromised to blaze a tree, or set up a chip for a guide, at every\nplace which appeared more than usually doubtful.",
        "We now found ourselves in a much more diversified country than any we\nhad hitherto travelled. Gently swelling hills, lovely valleys, and\nbright sparkling streams were the features of the landscape. But there\nwas little animate life. Now and then a shout from the leader of the\nparty (for, according to custom, we travelled Indian file) would call\nour attention to a herd of deer “loping,” as the Westerners say,\nthrough the forest; or an additional spur would be given to the horses\non the appearance of some small dark object, far distant on the trail\nbefore us. But the game invariably contrived to disappear before we\ncould reach it, and it was out of the question to leave the beaten track\nfor a regular hunt.",
        "Soon after mid-day, we descended a long, sloping knoll, and by a sudden\nturn came full in view of the beautiful sheet of water denominated\nGros-pied by the French, Maunk-suck by the natives, and by ourselves\nBig-foot, from the chief whose village overlooked its waters. Bold,\nswelling hills jutted forward into the clear blue expanse, or retreated\nslightly to afford a green, level nook, as a resting-place for the\ndwelling of man. On the nearer shore stretched a bright, gravelly beach,\nacross which coursed here and there a pure, sparkling rivulet to join\nthe larger sheet of water.",
        "On a rising ground at the foot of one of the bold bluffs in the middle\ndistance, a collection of neat wigwams formed, with their surrounding\ngardens, no unpleasant feature in the picture.",
        "A shout of delight burst involuntarily from the whole party, as this\ncharming landscape met our view. “It was like the Hudson, only less\nbold–no, it was like the lake of the Forest Cantons, in the picture of\nthe Chapel of William Tell! What could be imagined more enchanting? Oh I\nif our friends at the East could but enjoy it with us!”",
        "We paused long to admire, and then spurred on, skirting the head of the\nlake, and were soon ascending the broad platform on which stood the\nvillage of Maunk-suck, or Big-foot.",
        "The inhabitants, who had witnessed our approach from a distance, were\nall assembled in front of their wigwams to greet us, if friends–if\notherwise, whatever the occasion should demand. It was the first time\nsuch a spectacle had ever presented itself to their wondering eyes.\nTheir salutations were not less cordial than we expected.\n\"Shaw-nee-aw-kee” and his mother, who was known throughout the tribe by\nthe touching appellation “Our friend’s wife,” were welcomed most kindly,\nand an animated conversation commenced, which I could understand only so\nfar as it was conveyed by gestures; so I amused myself by taking a\nminute survey of all that met my view.",
        "The chief was a large, raw-boned, ugly Indian, with a countenance\nbloated by intemperance, and with a sinister, unpleasant expression. He\nhad a gay-colored handkerchief upon his head, and was otherwise attired\nin his best, in compliment to the strangers.",
        "It was to this chief that Chambly, or, as he is now called,\nShaw-bee-nay, Billy Caldwell, and Robinson were dispatched, by Dr.\nWolcott, their Agent, during the Winnebago war, in 1821, to use their\nearnest endeavors to prevent this chief and his band from joining the\nhostile Indians. With some difficulty they succeeded, and were thus the\nmeans, doubtless, of saving the lives of all the settlers who lived\nexposed upon the frontier.",
        "Among the various groups of his people, there was none attracted my\nattention so forcibly as a young man of handsome face, and a figure that\nwas striking even where all were fine and symmetrical. He too had a gay\nhandkerchief on his head, a shirt of the brightest lemon-colored calico,\nan abundance of silver ornaments, and, what gave his dress a most\nfanciful appearance, one legging of blue and the other of bright\nscarlet. I was not ignorant that this peculiar feature in his toilet\nindicated a heart suffering from the tender passion. The flute, which\nhe carried in his hand, added confirmation to the fact, while the\njoyous, animated expression of his countenance showed with equal\nplainness that he was not a despairing lover.",
        "I could have imagined him to have recently returned from the chase,\nladen with booty, with which he had, as is the custom, entered the lodge\nof the fair one, and thrown his burden at the feet of her parents, with\nan indifferent, superb sort of air, as much as to say, “Here is some\nmeat–it is a mere trifle, but it will show you what you might expect\nwith me for a son-in-law.” I could not doubt that the damsel had stepped\nforward and gathered it up, in token that she accepted the offering, and\nthe donor along with it. There was nothing in the appearance or manner\nof any of the maidens by whom we were surrounded, to denote which was\nthe happy fair, neither, although I peered anxiously into all their\ncountenances, could I there detect any blush of consciousness; so I was\nobliged to content myself with selecting the youngest and prettiest of\nthe group, and go on weaving my romance to my own satisfaction.",
        "The village stood encircled by an amphitheatre of hills, so precipitous,\nand with gorges so steep and narrow, that it seemed almost impossible to\nscale them, even on horseback; how, then, could we hope to accomplish\nthe ascent of the four-wheeled carriage? This was the point now under\ndiscussion between my husband and the Pottowattamies. There was no\nalternative but to make the effort, selecting the pass that the\ninhabitants pointed out as the most practicable. Petaille went first,\nand I followed on my favorite Jerry. It was such a scramble as is not\noften taken,–almost perpendicularly, through what seemed the dry bed of\na torrent, now filled with loose stones, and scarcely affording one\nsecure foothold from the bottom to the summit! I clang fast to the\nmane, literally at times clasping Jerry around his neck, and, amid the\nencouraging shouts and cheers of those below, we at length arrived\nsafely, though nearly breathless, on the pinnacle, and sat looking down,\nto view the success of the next party.",
        "The horses had been taken from the carriage, the luggage it contained\nbeing placed upon the shoulders of some of the young Indians, to be\ntoted up the steep. Ropes were now attached to its sides, and a\nregular bevy of our red friends, headed by our two Frenchmen, placed to\nman them. Two or three more took their places in the rear, to hold the\nvehicle and keep it from slipping backwards–then the labor commenced.\nSuch a pulling! such a shouting! such a clapping of hands by the\nspectators of both sexes! such a stentorian word of command or\nencouragement from the bourgeois! Now and then there would be a slight\nhalt, a wavering, as if carriage and men were about to tumble backwards\ninto the plain below; but no–they would recover themselves, and after\nincredible efforts they too safely gained the table-land above. In\nprocess of time all were landed there, and, having remunerated our\nfriends to their satisfaction, the goods and chattels were collected,\nthe wagon repacked, and we set off for our encampment at Turtle Creek.",
        "The exertions and excitement of our laborious ascent, together with the\nincreasing heat of the sun, made this afternoon’s ride more\nuncomfortable than anything we had previously felt. We were truly\nrejoiced when the whoop of our guide, and the sight of a few scattered\nlodges, gave notice that we had reached our encamping-ground. We chose a\nbeautiful sequestered spot by the side of a clear, sparkling stream,\nand, having dismounted and seen that our horses were made comfortable,\nmy husband, after giving his directions to his men, led me to a retired\nspot where I could lay aside my hat and mask and bathe my flushed face\nand aching head in the cool, refreshing waters. Never had I felt\nanything so grateful, so delicious. I sat down, and leaned my head\nagainst one of the tall, overshadowing trees, and was almost dreaming,\nwhen summoned to partake of our evening meal.",
        "The Indians had brought us, as a present, some fine brook trout, which\nour Frenchmen had prepared in the most tempting fashion, and before the\nbright moon rose and we were ready for oar rest, all headache and\nfatigue had alike disappeared.",
        "One of the most charming features of this mode of travelling is the\njoyous, vocal life of the forest at early dawn, when all the feathered\ntribe come forth to pay their cheerful salutations to the opening day.",
        "The rapid, chattering flourish of the bob-o’-link, the soft whistle of\nthe thrush, the tender coo of the wood-dove, the deep, warbling bass of\nthe grouse, the drumming of the partridge, the melodious trill of the\nlark, the gay carol of the robin, the friendly, familiar call of the\nduck and the teal, resound from tree and knoll and lowland, prompting\nthe expressive exclamation of the simple half-breed,–",
        "“Voilà la forêt qui parle!\"[46]",
        "It seems as if man must involuntarily raise his voice, to take part in\nthe general chorus–the mating song of praise.",
        "Birds and flowers, and the soft balmy airs of morning! Must it not have\nbeen in a scene like this that Milton’s Adam poured out his beautiful\nhymn of adoration,–",
        "“These are thy glorious works, Parent of Good”?",
        "This day we were journeying in hopes to reach, at an early hour, that\nbroad expanse of the Rock River which here forms the Kosh-ko-nong. The\nappellation of this water, rendered doubly affecting by the subsequent\nfate of its people, imports ’the lake we live on.”",
        "Our road for the early part of the day led through forests so thick and\ntangled that Grignon and Lecuyer were often obliged to go in advance as\npioneers with their axes, to cut away the obstructing shrubs and\nbranches. It was slow work, and at times quite discouraging, but we were\nthrough with it at last, and then we came into a country of altogether a\ndifferent description,–low prairies, intersected with deep, narrow\nstreams like canals, the passage of which, either by horses or\ncarriages, was often a matter of delay and even difficulty.",
        "Several times in the course of the forenoon the horses were to be taken\nfrom the carriage and the latter pulled and pushed across the deep\nnarrow channels as best it might.",
        "The wooded banks of the Kosh-ko-nong were never welcomed with greater\ndelight than by us when they at length broke upon our sight. A ride of\nfive or six miles through the beautiful oak openings brought us to\nMan-Eater’s village, a collection of neat bark wigwams, with extensive\nfields on each side of corn, beans, and squashes, recently planted, but\nalready giving promise of a fine crop. In front was the broad blue lake,\nthe shores of which, to the south, were open and marshy, but near the\nvillage, and stretching far away to the north, were bordered by fine\nlofty trees. The village was built but a short distance below the point\nwhere the Rock River opens into the lake, and during a conversation\nbetween our party and the Indians at the village, an arrangement was\nmade with them to take us across at a spot about half a mile above.",
        "After a short halt, we again took up our line of march through the\nwoods, along the bank of the river.",
        "A number of the Winnebagoes (for we had been among our own people since\nleaving Gros-pied Lake) set out for the appointed place by water,\npaddling their canoes, of which they had selected the largest and\nstrongest.",
        "Arrived at the spot indicated, we dismounted, and the men commenced the\ntask of unsaddling and unloading. We were soon placed in the canoes, and\npaddled across to the opposite bank. Next, the horses were swum\nacross–after them was to come the carriage. Two long wooden canoes were\nsecurely lashed together side by side, and being of sufficient width to\nadmit of the carriage standing within them, the passage was commenced.\nAgain and again the tottering barks would sway from side to side, and a\ncry or a shout would arise from our party on shore, as the whole mass\nseemed about to plunge sideways into the water, but it would presently\nrecover itself, and at length, after various deviations from the\nperpendicular, it reached the shore in safety.",
        "We now hoped that our troubles were at an end, and that we had nothing\nto do but to mount and trot on as fast as possible to Fort Winnebago.\nBut no. Half a mile farther on was a formidable swamp, of no great width\nit is true, but with a depth of from two to three feet of mud and water.\nIt was a question whether, with the carriage, we could get through it at\nall. Several of the Indians accompanied us to this place, partly to give\nus their aid and counsel, and partly to enjoy the fun of the spectacle.",
        "On reaching the swamp, we were disposed to laugh at the formidable\nrepresentations which had been made to us. We saw only a strip of what\nseemed rather low land, covered with tall, dry rushes.",
        "It is true the ground looked a little wet, but there seemed nothing to\njustify all the apprehensions that had been excited. Great was my\nsurprise, then, to see my husband, who had been a few minutes absent,\nreturn to our circle attired in his duck trousers, and without shoes or\nstockings.",
        "“What are you going to do?” inquired I.",
        "“Carry you through the swamp on my shoulders. Come, Petaille, you are\nthe strongest–you are to carry Madame Kinzie, and To-shun-nuck there\n(pointing to a tall, stout Winnebago), he will take Madame Helm.”",
        "“Wait a moment,” said I, and, seating myself on the grass, I\ndeliberately took off my own boots and stockings.",
        "“What is that for?” they all asked.",
        "“Because I do not wish to ride with wet feet all the rest of the day.”",
        "“No danger of that,” said they, and no one followed my example.",
        "By the time they were in the midst of the swamp, however, they found my\nprecaution had been by no means useless. The water through which our\nbearers had to pass was of such a depth that no efforts of the ladies\nwere sufficient to keep their feet above the surface; and I had the\nsatisfaction of feeling that my burden upon my husband’s shoulders was\nmuch less, from my being able to keep my first position instead of\nchanging constantly to avoid a contact with the water.",
        "The laugh was quite on my side when I resumed my equipment and mounted,\ndry-shod, into my saddle.",
        "It will be perceived that journeying in the woods is, in some degree, a\nderanger of ceremony and formality; that it necessarily restricts us\nsomewhat in our conventionalities. The only remedy is, to make ourselves\namends by a double share when we return to the civilized walks of life.",
        "By dint of much pulling, shouting, encouraging, and threatening, the\nhorses at length dragged the carriage through the difficult pass, and\nour red friends were left to return to their village, with, doubtless, a\nvery exaggerated and amusing account of all that they had seen and\nassisted in.",
        "We had not forgotten our promise to Lieutenant Foster to put up a\n\"guide-board” of some sort, for his accommodation in following us. We\ntherefore, upon several occasions, carried with us from the woods a few\npieces, of three or four feet in length, which we planted at certain\npoints, with a transverse stick through a cleft in the top, thus marking\nthe direction he and his party were to take.",
        "We therefore felt sure that, although a few days later, he would find\nour trail, and avail himself of the same assistance as we had, in\ngetting through the difficulties of the way.",
        "Our encamping-ground, this night, was to be not far distant from the\nFour Lakes. We were greatly fatigued with the heat and exercise of the\nday, and most anxiously did we look out for the clumps of willows and\nalders which were to mark the spot where water would be found. We felt\nhardly equal to pushing on quite to the bank of the nearest lake.\nIndeed, it would have taken us too much off our direct course.",
        "When we, at a late hour, came upon a spot fit for our purpose, we\nexchanged mutual congratulations that this was to be our last night upon\nthe road. The next day we should be at Winnebago!",
        "Our journey had been most delightful–a continued scene of exhilaration\nand enjoyment; for the various mishaps, although for the moment they had\nperplexed, yet, in the end, had but added to our amusement. Still, with\nthe inconstancy of human nature, we were pleased to exchange its\nexcitement for the quiet repose of home.",
        "Our next morning’s ride was of a more tranquil character than any that\nhad preceded it; for at an early hour we entered upon what was known as\nthe “Twenty-mile Prairie,\"–and I may be permitted to observe that the\nmiles are wonderfully long on the prairies. Our passage over this was,\nexcept the absence of the sand, like crossing the desert. Mile after\nmile of unbroken expanse–not a tree–not a living object except\nourselves.",
        "The sun, as if to make himself amends for his two months’ seclusion,\nshone forth with redoubled brilliancy. There is no such thing as\ncarrying an umbrella on horseback, though those in the wagon were able\nto avail themselves of such a shelter.",
        "Our mother’s energies had sustained her in the saddle until this day,\nbut she was now fairly obliged to give in, and yield her place on little\nBrunet to sister Margaret.",
        "Thus we went on, one little knoll rising beyond another, from the summit\nof each of which, in succession, we hoped to descry the distant woods,\nwhich were to us as the promised land.",
        "“Take courage,” were the cheering words, often repeated; “very soon you\nwill begin to see the timber.”",
        "Another hour would pass heavily by.",
        "“Now, when we reach the rising ground just ahead, look sharp.”",
        "We would look sharp–nothing but the same unvarying landscape.",
        "There were not even streams to allay the feverish thirst occasioned by\nfatigue and impatience.",
        "At length a whoop from Shaw-nee-aw-kee broke the silence in which we\nwere pursuing our way.",
        "“Le voilà!” (There it is!)",
        "Our less practised eye could not at first discern the faint blue strip\nedging the horizon, but it grew and grew upon our vision, and fatigue\nand all discomfort proportionably disappeared.",
        "We were in fine spirits by the time we reached “Hastings’s Woods,” a\nnoble forest, watered by a clear, sparkling stream.",
        "Grateful as was the refreshment of the green foliage and the cooling\nwaters, we did not allow ourselves to forget that the day was wearing\non, and that we must, if possible, complete our journey before sunset;\nso we soon braced up our minds to continue our route, although we would\ngladly have lingered another hour.",
        "The marsh of Duck Creek was, thanks to the heat of the past week, in a\nvery different state from what it had been a few months previous, when I\nhad been so unfortunately submerged in its icy waters.",
        "We passed it without difficulty, and soon found ourselves upon the banks\nof the creek.",
        "The stream, at this point, was supposed to be always fordable; and even\nwere it not so, that to the majority of our party would have been a\nmatter of little moment. To the ladies, however, the subject seemed to\ndemand consideration.",
        "“This water looks very deep–are you sure we can cross it on horseback?”",
        "“Oh, yes! Petaille, go before, and let us see how the water is.”",
        "Petaille obeyed. He was mounted on a horse like a giraffe, and,\nextending his feet horizontally, he certainly managed to pass through\nthe stream without much of a wetting.",
        "It seemed certain that the water would come into the wagon, but that was\nof the less consequence as, in case of the worst, the passengers could\nmount upon the seats.",
        "My horse, Jerry, was above the medium height, so that I soon passed\nover, with no inconvenience but that of being obliged to disengage my\nfeet from the stirrups and tuck them up snugly against the mane of the\nhorse.",
        "Sister Margaret was still upon Brunet. She was advised to change him for\none of the taller horses, but while the matter was under debate, it was\nsettled by the perverse little wretch taking to the water most\nunceremoniously, in obedience to the example of the other animals.",
        "He was soon beyond his depth, and we were at once alarmed and diverted\nat seeing his rider, with surprising adroitness, draw her feet from the\nstirrups and perch herself upon the top of the saddle, where she held\nher position, and navigated her little refractory steed safely to land.",
        "This was the last of our adventures. A pleasant ride of four miles\nbrought us to the Fort, just as the sun was throwing his last beams over\nthe glowing landscape; and on reaching the ferry we were at once\nconducted, by the friends who were awaiting us, to the hospitable roof\nof Major Twiggs.",
        "The companies of the First Infantry, which had hitherto been stationed\nat Fort Winnebago, had before our arrival received orders to move on to\nthe Mississippi as soon as relieved by a portion of the Fifth, now at\nFort Howard.",
        "As many of the officers of the latter regiment were married, we had\nreason to expect that all the quarters at the post would be put in\nrequisition. For this reason, although strongly pressed by Major Twiggs\nto take up our residence again in the Fort until he should go on\nfurlough, we thought it best to establish ourselves at once at “the\nAgency.”",
        "It seemed laughable to give so grand a name to so very insignificant a\nconcern. We had been promised, by the heads of department at Washington,\na comfortable dwelling so soon as there should be an appropriation by\nCongress sufficient to cover any extra expense in the Indian Department.\nIt was evident that Congress had a great spite at us, for it had delayed\nfor two sessions attending to our accommodation. There was nothing to be\ndone, therefore, but to make ourselves comfortable with the best means\nin our power.",
        "The old log barracks, which had been built for the officers and soldiers\non the first establishment of the post, two years previous, had been\nremoved by our French engagés and put up again upon the little hill\nopposite the Fort. To these some additions were now made in the shape\nof dairy, stables, smoke-house, etc., constructed of tamarack logs\nbrought from the neighboring swamp. The whole presented a very rough and\nprimitive appearance.",
        "The main building consisted of a range of four rooms, no two of which\ncommunicated with each other, but each opened by a door into the outward\nair. A small window cut through the logs in front and rear, gave light\nto the apartment. An immense clay chimney for every two rooms, occupied\none side of each, and the ceiling overhead was composed of a few rough\nboards laid upon the transverse logs that supported the roof.",
        "It was surprising how soon a comfortable, homelike air was given to the\nold dilapidated rooms, by a few Indian mats spread upon the floor, the\npiano and other furniture ranged in their appropriate places, and even a\nfew pictures hung against the logs. The latter, alas! had soon to be\ndisplaced, for with the first heavy shower the rain found entrance\nthrough sundry crevices, and we saw ourselves obliged to put aside,\ncarefully, everything that could be injured by the moisture. We made\nlight of these evils, however–packed away our carpets and superfluous\nfurniture upon the boards above, which we dignified with the name of\nattic, and contentedly resolved to await the time when Government should\ncondescend to remember us. The greatest inconvenience I experienced, was\nfrom the necessity of wearing my straw bonnet throughout the day, as I\njourneyed from bedroom to parlor, and from parlor to kitchen. I became\nso accustomed to it that I even sometimes forgot to remove it when I sat\ndown to table, or to my quiet occupations with my mother and sister.",
        "Permission was, however, in time, received to build a house for the\nblacksmith–that is, the person kept in pay by the Government at this\nstation to mend the guns, traps, etc. of the Indians.",
        "It happened most fortunately for us that Monsieur Isidore Morrin was a\nbachelor, and quite satisfied to continue boarding with his friend Louis\nFrum, dit Manaigre, so that when the new house was fairly commenced we\nplanned it and hurried it forward entirely on our own account.",
        "It was not very magnificent, it is true, consisting of but a parlor and\ntwo bedrooms on the ground-floor, and two low chambers under the roof,\nwith a kitchen in the rear; but compared with the rambling old\nstable-like building we now inhabited, it seemed quite a palace.",
        "Before it was completed, Mr. Kinzie was notified that the money for the\nannual Indian payment was awaiting his arrival in Detroit to take it in\ncharge and superintend its transportation to the Portage; and he was\nobliged to set off at once to fulfil this part of his duty.",
        "The workmen who had been brought from the Mississippi to erect the main\nbuilding, were fully competent to carry on their work without an\noverseer; but the kitchen was to be the task of the Frenchmen, and the\nquestion was, how could it be executed in the absence of the\nbourgeois?",
        "“You will have to content yourselves in the old quarters until my\nreturn,” said my husband, “and then we will soon have things in order.\"\nHis journey was to be a long and tedious one, for the operations of\nGovernment were not carried on by railroad and telegraph in those days.",
        "After his departure I said to the men, “Come, you have all your logs cut\nand hauled–the squaws have brought the bark for the roof–what is to\nprevent our finishing the house and getting all moved and settled to\nsurprise Monsieur John on his return?”",
        "“Ah! to be sure, Madame John,” said Plante, who was always the\nspokesman, “provided the one who plants a green bough on the chimney-top\nis to have a treat.”",
        "“Certainly. All hands fall to work, and see who will win the treat.”",
        "Upon the strength of such an inducement to the one who should put the\nfinishing stroke to the building, Plante, Pillon, and Manaigre, whom the\nwaggish Plante persisted in calling “mon nègre,” whenever he felt\nhimself out of the reach of the other’s arm, all went vigorously to\nwork.",
        "Building a log house is a somewhat curious process. First, as will be\nconceived, the logs are laid one upon another and jointed at the\ncorners, until the walls have reached the required height. The chimney\nis formed by four poles of the proper length, interlaced with a\nwicker-work of small branches. A hole or pit is dug, near at hand, and,\nwith a mixture of clay and water, a sort of mortar is formed. Large\nwisps of hay are filled with this thick substance, and fashioned with\nthe hands into what are technically called ’clay cats,” and these are\nfilled in among the frame-work of the chimney until not a chink is left.\nThe whole is then covered with a smooth coating of the wet clay, which\nis denominated “plastering.”",
        "Between the logs which compose the walls of the building, small bits of\nwood are driven, quite near together; this is called “chinking,” and\nafter it is done, clay cats are introduced, and smoothed over with the\nplaster. When all is dry, both walls and chimney are whitewashed, and\npresent a comfortable and tidy appearance.",
        "The roof is formed by laying upon the transverse logs thick sheets of\nbark. Around the chimney, for greater security against the rain, we took\ncare to have placed a few layers of the palisades that had been left\nwhen Mr. Peach, an odd little itinerant genius, had fenced in our\ngarden, the pride and wonder of the surrounding settlement and wigwams.",
        "While all these matters were in progress, we received frequent visits\nfrom our Indian friends. First and foremost among them was “the young\nDandy,” Four-Legs.",
        "One fine morning he made his appearance, accompanied by two squaws, whom\nhe introduced as his wives. He could speak a little Chippewa, and by\nthis means he and our mother contrived to keep up something of a\nconversation. He was dressed in all his finery, brooches, wampum, fan,\nlooking-glass and all. The paint upon his face and chest showed that he\nhad devoted no small time to the labors of his toilet.",
        "He took a chair, as he had seen done at Washington, and made signs to\nhis women to sit down upon the floor.",
        "The custom of taking two wives is not very general among the Indians.\nThey seem to have the sagacity to perceive that the fewer they have to\nmanage, the more complete is the peace and quiet of the wigwam.",
        "Nevertheless, it sometimes happens that a husband takes a foolish fancy\nfor a second squaw, and in that case he uses all his cunning and\neloquence to reconcile the first to receiving a new inmate in the lodge.\nOf course it is a matter that must be managed adroitly, in order that\nharmony may be preserved.",
        "“My dear, your health is not very good; it is time you should have some\nrest. You have worked very hard, and it grieves me that you should have\nto labor any longer. Let me get you some nice young squaw to wait upon\nyou, that you may live at ease all the rest of your life.”",
        "The first wife consents; indeed, she has no option. If she is of a\njealous, vindictive disposition, what a life the new-comer leads! The\nold one maintains all her rights of dowager and duenna, and the\nhusband’s tenderness is hardly a compensation for all the evils the\nyoung rival is made to suffer.",
        "It was on Sunday morning that this visit of the Dandy was made to us. We\nwere all seated quietly, engaged in reading. Four-Legs inquired of my\nmother, why we were so occupied, and why everything around us was so\nstill.",
        "My mother explained to him our observance of the day of rest–that we\ndevoted it to worshipping and serving the Great Spirit, as he had\ncommanded in his Holy Word.",
        "Four-Legs gave a nod of approbation. That was very right, he said–he\nwas glad to see us doing our duty–he was very religious himself, and he\nliked to see others so. He always took care that his squaws attended to\ntheir duties,–not reading, perhaps, but such as the Great Spirit liked,\nand such as he thought proper and becoming.",
        "He seemed to have no fancy for listening to any explanation of our\npoints of difference. The impression among the Winnebagoes “that if the\nGreat Spirit had wished them different from what they are, he would have\nmade them so,” seems too strong to yield to either argument or\npersuasion.",
        "Sometimes those who are desirous of appearing somewhat civilized will\nlisten quietly to all that is advanced on the subject of Christianity,\nthen, coolly saying, “Yes, we believe that too,” will change the\nconversation to other subjects.",
        "As a general thing, they do not appear to perceive that there is\nanything to be gained by adopting the religion and the customs of the\nwhites. “Look at them,” they say, “always toiling and striving–always\nwearing a brow of care–shut up in houses–afraid of the wind and the\nrain–suffering when they are deprived of the comforts of life! We, on\nthe contrary, live a life of freedom and happiness. We hunt and fish,\nand pass our time pleasantly in the open woods and prairies. If we are\nhungry, we take some game; or, if we do not find that, we can go\nwithout. If our enemies trouble us, we can kill them, and there is no\nmore said about it. What should we gain by changing ourselves into white\nmen?\"[47]",
        "Christian missionaries, with all their efforts to convert them, had at\nthis day made little progress in enlightening their minds upon the\ndoctrines of the Gospel. Mr. Mazzuchelli, a Roman Catholic priest,\naccompanied by Miss Elizabeth Grignon as interpreter, made a missionary\nvisit to the Portage during our residence there, and, after some\ninstruction from him, about forty consented to be baptized. Christian\nnames were given to them, with which they seemed much pleased; and not\nless so with the little plated crucifixes which each received, and which\nthe women wore about their necks. These they seemed to regard with a\ndevotional feeling; but I was not sufficiently acquainted with their\nlanguage to gather from them whether they understood the doctrine the\nsymbol was designed to convey. Certain it is, they expressed no wish to\nlearn our language, in order that they might gain a fuller knowledge of\nthe Saviour, nor any solicitude to be taught more about him than they\nhad received during the missionary’s short visit.",
        "One woman, to whom the name of Charlotte had been given, signified a\ndesire to learn the domestic ways of the whites, and asked of me as a\nfavor through Madame Paquette that she might be permitted to come on\n\"washing-day,” and learn of my servants our way of managing the\nbusiness. A tub was given her, and my woman instructed her, by signs and\nexample, how she was to manage. As I was not a little curious to observe\nhow things went on, I proceeded after a time to the kitchen where they\nall were. Charlotte was at her tub, scouring and rubbing with all her\nmight at her little crucifix. Two other squaws sat upon the floor near\nher, watching the operation.",
        "“That is the work she has been at for the last half-hour,” said Josette,\nin a tone of great impatience. ’She’ll never learn to wash.”",
        "Charlotte, however, soon fell diligently to work, and really seemed as\nif she would tear her arms off, with her violent exertions.",
        "After a time, supposing that she must feel a good deal fatigued and\nexhausted with the unaccustomed labor, I did what it was at that day\nvery much the fashion to do,–what, at home, I had always seen done on\nwashing-day,–what, in short, I imagine was then a general custom among\nhousekeepers. I went to the dining-room closet, intending to give\nCharlotte a glass of wine or brandy and water. My “cupboard” proved to\nbe in the state of the luckless “Mother Hubbard’s\"–nothing of the kind\ncould I find but a bottle of orange shrub.",
        "Of this I poured out a wineglassful, and, carrying it out, offered it to\nthe woman. She took it with an expression of great pleasure; but, in\ncarrying it to her lips, she stopped short, and exclaiming, “Whiskey!\"\nimmediately returned it to me. I would still have pressed it upon her;\nfor, in my inexperience, I really believed it was a cordial she needed;\nbut, pointing to her crucifix, she shook her head and returned to her\nwork.",
        "I received this as a lesson more powerful than twenty sermons. It was\nthe first time in my life that I had ever seen spirituous liquors\nrejected upon a religious principle, and it made an impression upon me\nthat I never forgot.",
        "Among the women of the tribe with whom we early became acquainted, our\ngreatest favorite was a daughter of one of the Day-kau-rays. This\nfamily, as I have elsewhere said, boasted in some remote generation a\ncross of the French blood, and this fact might account for the fair\ncomplexion and soft curling hair which distinguished our friend. She had\na noble forehead, full, expressive eyes, and fine teeth. Unlike the\nwomen of her people, she had not grown brown and haggard with advancing\nyears. Indeed, with the exception of one feature, she might be called\nbeautiful.",
        "She had many years before married a Mus-qua-kee, or Fox Indian, and,\naccording to the custom among all the tribes, the husband came home to\nthe wife’s family, and lived among the Winnebagoes.",
        "It is this custom, so exactly the reverse of civilized ways, that makes\nthe birth of a daughter a subject of peculiar rejoicing in an Indian\nfamily. “She will bring another hunter to our lodge,” is the style of\nmutual congratulation.",
        "The Mus-qua-kee continued, for some few years, to live among his wife’s\nrelations; but, as no children blessed their union, he at length became\ntired of his new friends, and longed to return to his own people. He\ntried, for a time, to persuade his wife to leave her home, and accompany\nhim to the Mississippi, on the banks of which the Sauks and Foxes lived,\nbut in vain. She could not resolve to make the sacrifice.",
        "One day, after many fruitless efforts to persuade her, he flew into a\nviolent passion.",
        "“Then, if you will not go with me,” said he, “I will leave you; but you\nshall never be the wife of any other man–I will mark you!”",
        "Saying this, he flew upon her, and bit off the end of her nose. This,\nthe usual punishment for conjugal infidelity, is the greatest disgrace a\nwoman can receive–it bars her forever from again entering the pale of\nmatrimony. The wretch fled to his own people; but his revenge fell short\nof its aim. Day-kau-ray was too well known and too universally respected\nto suffer opprobrium in any member of his family. This bright, loving\ncreature in particular, won all hearts upon a first acquaintance–she\ncertainly did ours, from the outset.",
        "She suffered much from rheumatism, and a remedy we gave her soon\nafforded her almost entire relief. Her gratitude knew no bounds.\nNotwithstanding that from long suffering she had become partially\ncrippled, she would walk all the way from the Barribault, a distance of\nten miles, as often as once in two or three weeks, to visit us. Then, to\nsit and gaze at us, to laugh with childish glee at everything new or\nstrange that we employed ourselves about–to pat and stroke us every\ntime we came near her–sometimes to raise our hand or arm and kiss\nit–these were her demonstrations of affection. And we loved her in\nreturn. It was always a joyful announcement when, looking out over the\nPortage road, somebody called out, “The Cut-Nose is coming!” In time,\nhowever, we learned to call her by her baptismal name of Elizabeth, for\nshe, too, was one of Mr. Mazzuchelli’s converts.",
        "She came one day, accompanied by a half-grown boy, carrying a young fawn\nshe had brought me as a present. I was delighted with the pretty\ncreature–with its soft eyes and dappled coat; but having often heard\nthe simile, “as wild as a fawn,” I did not anticipate much success in\ntaming it. To my great surprise, it soon learned to follow me like a\ndog. Wherever I went, there Fan was sure to be. At breakfast, she would\nlie down at my feet, under the table. One of her first tokens of\naffection was to gnaw off all the trimming from my black silk apron, as\nshe lay pretending to caress and fondle me. Nor was this her only style\nof mischief.",
        "One day we heard a great rattling among the crockery in the kitchen. We\nran to see what was the matter, and found that Miss Fan had made her way\nto a shelf of the dresser, about two feet from the ground, and was\nendeavoring to find a comfortable place to lie down, among the plates\nand dishes. I soon observed that it was the shelter of the shelf above\nher head that was the great attraction, and that she was in the habit of\nseeking out a place of repose under a chair, or something approaching to\nan “umbrageous bower.” So after this I took care, as the hour for her\nmorning nap approached, to open a large green parasol, and set it on the\nmatting in the corner–then when I called “Fan, Fan,” she would come and\nnestle under it, and soon fall fast asleep.",
        "One morning Fan was missing. In vain we called and sought her in the\ngarden–in the enclosure for the cattle–at the houses of the\nFrenchmen–along the hill towards Paquette’s–no Fan was to be found. We\nthought she had asserted her own wild nature and sped away to the woods.",
        "It was a hot forenoon, and the doors were all open. About dinner-time,\nin rushed Fan, panting violently, and threw herself upon her side, where\nshe lay with her feet outstretched, her mouth foaming, and exhibiting\nall the signs of mortal agony. We tried to give her water, to soothe\nher, if perhaps it might be fright that so affected her; but in a few\nminutes, with a gasp and a spasm, she breathed her last. Whether she had\nbeen chased by the greyhounds, or whether she had eaten some poisonous\nweed, which, occasioning her suffering, had driven her to her best\nfriends for aid, we never knew; but we lost our pretty pet, and many\nwere the tears shed for her.",
        "Very shortly after the departure of my husband, we received a visit from\n\"the White Crow,” the “Little Priest,” and several others of the\nprincipal chiefs of the Bock River Indians. They seemed greatly\ndisappointed at learning that their Father was from home, even though\nhis errand was to get “the silver.” We sent for Paquette, who\ninterpreted for us the object of their visit.",
        "They had come to inform us that the Sauk chief Black Hawk and his band,\nwho, in compliance with a former treaty, had removed some time previous\nto the west of the Mississippi, had now returned to their old homes and\nhunting-grounds, and expressed a determination not to relinquish them,\nbut to drive off the white settlers who had begun to occupy them.",
        "The latter, in fact, the chief had already done, and having, as it was\nsaid, induced some of the Pottowattamies to join him, there was reason\nto fear that he might persuade some of the Winnebagoes to follow their\nexample.",
        "These chiefs had come to counsel with their Father, and to assure him\nthat they should do all in their power to keep their young men quiet.\nThey had heard that troops were being raised down among the whites in\nIllinois, and they had hopes that their people would be wise enough to\nkeep out of difficulty. Furthermore, they begged that their Father, on\nhis return, would see that the soldiers did not meddle with them, so\nlong as they remained quiet and behaved in a friendly manner.",
        "White Crow seemed particularly anxious to impress it upon me, that if\nany danger should arise in Shaw-nee-aw-kee’s absence, he should come\nwith his people to protect me and my family. I relied upon his\nassurances, for he had ever shown himself an upright and honorable\nIndian.",
        "Notwithstanding this, the thoughts of Indian troubles so near us, in the\nabsence of our guardian and protector, occasioned us many an anxious\nmoment, and it was not until we learned of the peaceable retreat of the\nSauks and Foxes west of the Mississippi, that we were able wholly to lay\naside our fears.",
        "We were now called to part with our friends, Major Twiggs and his\nfamily, which we did with heartfelt regret. He gave me a few parting\nwords about our old acquaintance, Krissman.",
        "“When I went into the barracks the other day,” said he, “about the time\nthe men were taking their dinner, I noticed a great six-foot soldier\nstanding against the window-frame, crying and blubbering. ’Halloo,’ said\nI, ’what on earth does this mean?’",
        "“’Why, that fellow there,’ said Krissman (for it was he), ’has scrowged\nme out of my place!’ A pretty soldier your protége will make, madam!\"\nadded the Major.",
        "I never heard more of my hero. Whether he went to exhibit his prowess\nagainst the Seminoles and Mexicans, or whether he returned to till the\nfertile soil of his native German Flats and blow his favorite boatman’s\nhorn, must be left for some future historian to tell.",
        "There is one more character to be disposed of–Louisa. An opportunity\noffering in the spring, the Major placed her under the charge of a\nperson going to Buffalo, that she might be returned to her parents. In\ncompliment to the new acquaintances she had formed, she shortened her\nskirts, mounted a pair of scarlet leggings embroidered with\nporcupine-quills, and took her leave of military life, having deposited\nwith the gentleman who took charge of her sixty dollars, for safe\nkeeping, which she remarked “she had saved up, out of her wages at a\ndollar a week, through the winter.”",
        "A very short time after we were settled in our new home at the Agency,\nwe attempted the commencement of a little Sunday-school. Edwin, Harry\nand Josette were our most reliable scholars, but besides them there were\nthe two little Manaigres, Thérèse Paquette, and her mother’s\nhalf-sister, Florence Courville, a pretty young girl of fifteen. None of\nthese girls had even learned their letters. They spoke only French, or\nrather the Canadian patois, and it was exceedingly difficult to give\nthem at once the sound of the words, and their signification, which they\nwere careful to inquire. Besides this, there was the task of correcting\nthe false ideas, and remedying the ignorance and superstition which\npresented so formidable an obstacle to rational improvement. We did our\nbest, however, and had the satisfaction of seeing them, after a time,\nmaking really respectable progress with their spelling-book, and, what\nwas still more encouraging, acquiring a degree of light and knowledge in\nregard to better things.",
        "In process of time, however, Florence was often absent from her class.\n\"Her sister,” she said, “could not always spare her. She wanted her to\nkeep house while she herself went over oil Sunday to visit her friends\nthe Roys, who lived on the Wisconsin.”",
        "We reasoned with Madame Paquette on the subject. “Could she not spare\nFlorence on some hour of the day? We would gladly teach her on a\nweek-day, for she seemed anxious to learn, but we had always been told\nthat for that there was no time.”",
        "“Well–she would see. Madame Alum (Helm) and Madame John were so kind!”",
        "There was no improvement, however, in regularity. After a time Manaigre\nwas induced to send his children to Mr. Cadle’s mission-school at Green\nBay. Thérèse accompanied them, and very soon Florence discontinued her\nattendance altogether.",
        "We were obliged, from that time forward, to confine our instructions to\nour own domestic circle.",
        "Before we had any right to look for my husband’s return, I one day\nreceived a message inviting me to come up to the new house. We all went\nin a body, for we had purposely stayed away a few days, expecting this\nsummons, of which we anticipated the meaning.",
        "Plante, in full glee, was seated astride of a small keg on the roof,\nclose beside the kitchen chimney, on the very summit of which he had\nplanted a green bough. To this he held fast with one hand, while he\nexultingly waved the other and called out,–",
        "“Eh ban, Madame John! à cette heure, pour le régal!“",
        "“Yes, Plante, you are entitled to a treat, and I hope you will not enjoy\nit the less that Pillon and Manaigre are to share it with you.”",
        "A suitable gratification made them quite contented with their\n”bourgeoise,” against whom Plante had sometimes been inclined to\ngrumble, “because,” as he said, “she had him called up too early in the\nmorning.” He might have added, because, too, she could not understand\nthe philosophy of his coming in to work in his own garden, under the\nplea that it was too rainy to work in Monsieur John’s.",
        "It was with no ordinary feelings of satisfaction that we quitted the old\nlog tenement and took possession of our new dwelling, small and\ninsignificant though it was.",
        "I was only too happy to enjoy the luxury of a real bedchamber, in place\nof the parlor floor which I had occupied as such for more than two\nmonths. It is true that our culinary arrangements were still upon no\ngreatly improved plan. The clay chimney was not of sufficient strength\nto hold the trammel and pot-hooks, which at that day had not been\nsuperseded by the cooking-stove and kitchen-range. Our fire was made as\nin the olden time, with vast logs behind, and smaller sticks in front,\nlaid across upon the andirons or dogs. Upon these sticks were placed\nsuch of the cooking-utensils as could not be accommodated on the hearth;\nbut woe to the dinner or the supper, if through a little want of care or\nscrutiny one treacherous piece was suffered to burn away. Down would\ncome the whole arrangement–kettles, saucepans, burning brands, and\ncinders, in one almost inextricable mass. How often this happened under\nthe supervision of Harry or little Josette, while the mistress was\nplaying lady to some visitor in the parlor, “’twere vain to tell.”",
        "Then, spite of Monsieur Plante’s palisades round the chimney, in a hard\nshower the rain would come pelting down, and, the hearth unfortunately\nsloping a little the wrong way, the fire would become extinguished;\nwhile, the bark on the roof failing to do its duty, we were now and then\nso completely deluged, that there was no resource but to catch up the\nbreakfast or dinner and tuck it under the table until better times–that\nis, till fair weather came again. In spite of all these little adverse\noccurrences, however, we enjoyed our new quarters exceedingly.",
        "Our garden was well furnished with vegetables, and even the\ncurrant-bushes which we had brought from Chicago with us, tied in a\nbundle at the back of the carriage, had produced us some fruit.",
        "The Indian women were very constant in their visits and their presents.\nSometimes it was venison–sometimes ducks or pigeons–whortleberries,\nwild plums, or cranberries, according to the season–neat pretty mats\nfor the floor or the table–wooden bowls or ladles, fancy work of\ndeer-skin or porcupine-quills. These they would bring in and throw at my\nfeet. If through inattention I failed to appear pleased, to raise the\narticles from the floor and lay them carefully aside, a look of\nmortification and the observation, “Our mother hates our gifts,” showed\nhow much their feelings were wounded. It was always expected that a\npresent would be received graciously, and returned with something twice\nits value.",
        "Meantime, week after week wore on, and still was the return of “the\nmaster” delayed.",
        "The rare arrival of a schooner at Green Bay, in which to take passage\nfor Detroit, made it always a matter of uncertainty what length of time\nwould be necessary for a journey across the lakes and back–so that it\nwas not until the last of August that he again reached his home. Great\nwas his surprise to find us so nicely moved and settled; and under his\nactive supervision the evils of which we had had to complain were soon\nremedied.",
        "My husband had met at Fort Gratiot, and brought with him, my young\nbrother Julian, whom my parents were sending, at our request, to reside\nwith us. Edwin was overjoyed to have a companion once more, for he had\nhitherto been very solitary. The boys soon had enough to occupy their\nattention, as, in obedience to a summons sent to the different villages,\nthe Indians very shortly came flocking in to the payment.",
        "There was among their number, this year, one whom I had never before\nseen–the mother of the elder Day-kau-ray. No one could tell her age,\nbut all agreed that she must have seen upwards of a hundred winters. Her\neyes dimmed, and almost white with age–her face dark and withered, like\na baked apple–her voice tremulous and feeble, except when raised in\nfury to reprove her graceless grandsons, who were fond of playing her\nall sorts of mischievous tricks, indicated the very great age she must\nhave attained.",
        "She usually went upon all-fours, not having strength to hold herself\nerect. On the day of the payment, having received her portion, which she\ncarefully hid in the corner of her blanket, she came crawling along and\nseated herself on the door-step, to count her treasure.",
        "My sister and I were watching her movements from the open window.",
        "Presently, just as she had, unobserved, as she thought, spread out her\nsilver before her, two of her descendants came suddenly upon her. At\nfirst they seemed begging for a share, but she repulsed them with angry\ngestures, when one of them made a sudden swoop, and possessed himself of\na handful.",
        "She tried to rise, to pursue him, but was unable to do more than clutch\nthe remainder and utter the most unearthly screams of rage. At this\ninstant the boys raised their eyes and perceived us regarding them. They\nburst into a laugh, and with a sort of mocking gesture they threw her\nthe half-dollars, and ran back to the pay-ground.",
        "In spite of their vexatious tricks, she seemed very fond of them, and\nnever failed to beg something of her Father, that she might bestow upon\nthem.",
        "She crept into the parlor one morning, then straightening herself up,\nand supporting herself by the frame of the door, she cried, in a most\npiteous tone,–\"Shaw-nee-aw-kee! Wau-tshob-ee-rah Thsoonsh-koo-nee-noh!\"\n(Silver-man, I have no looking-glass.) My husband, smiling and taking up\nthe same little tone, cried, in return,–",
        "“Do you wish to look at yourself, mother?”",
        "The idea seemed to her so irresistibly comic that she laughed until she\nwas fairly obliged to seat herself upon the floor and give way to her\nenjoyment. She then owned that it was for one of the boys that she\nwanted the little mirror. When her Father had given it to her, she found\nthat she had “no comb,” then that she had “no knife,” then that she had\n\"no calico shawl,” until it ended, as it generally did, by\nShaw-nee-aw-kee paying pretty dearly for his joke.",
        "When the Indians arrived and when they departed, my sense of “woman’s\nrights” was often greatly outraged. The master of the family, as a\ngeneral thing, came leisurely bearing his gun and perhaps a lance in his\nhand; the woman, with the mats and poles of her lodge upon her\nshoulders, her pappoose, if she had one, her kettles, sacks of corn, and\nwild rice, and, not unfrequently, the household dog perched on the top\nof all. If there is a horse or pony in the list of family possessions,\nthe man rides, the squaw trudges after.",
        "This unequal division of labor is the result of no want of kind,\naffectionate feeling on the part of the husband. It is rather the\ninstinct of the sex to assert their superiority of position and\nimportance, when a proper occasion offers. When out of the reach of\nobservation, and in no danger of compromising his own dignity, the\nhusband is willing enough to relieve his spouse from the burden that\ncustom imposes on her, by sharing her labors and hardships.",
        "The payment had not passed without its appropriate number of\ncomplimentary and medicine dances. The latter take place only at rare\nintervals–the former whenever an occasion demanding a manifestation of\nrespect and courtesy presents itself.",
        "It is the custom to ask permission of the person to be complimented, to\ndance for him. This granted, preparation is made by painting the face\nelaborately, and marking the person, which is usually bare about the\nchest and shoulders, after the most approved pattern. All the ornaments\nthat can be mustered are added to the hair, or headdress. Happy is he\nwho, in virtue of having taken one or more scalps, is entitled to\nproclaim it by a corresponding number of eagle’s feathers.",
        "The less fortunate make a substitute of the feathers of the wild turkey,\nor, better still, of the first unlucky “rooster” that falls in their\nway. My poor fowls, during the time of payment, were always thoroughly\nplucked.",
        "When their preparations are completed, the dancers assemble at some\nconvenient place, whence they come marching to the spot appointed,\naccompanied by the music of the Indian drum and shee-shee-qua or rattle.\nThey range themselves in a circle and dance with violent contortions and\ngesticulations, some of them graceful, others only energetic, the\nsquaws, who stand a little apart and mingle their discordant voices with\nthe music of the instruments, rarely participating in the dance.\nOccasionally, however, when excited by the general gaiety, a few of them\nwill form a circle outside and perform a sort of ungraceful, up-and-down\nmovement, which has no merit, save the perfect time which is kept, and\nfor which the Indians seem, without exception, to possess a natural ear.\nThe dance finished, which is only when the strength of the dancers is\nquite exhausted, a quantity of presents are brought and placed in the\nmiddle of the circle, by order of the party complimented. An equitable\ndistribution is made by one of their number; and, the object of all this\ndisplay having been accomplished, they retire.",
        "The medicine dance is carried on chiefly to celebrate the skill of the\n\"Medicine-man” in curing diseases. This functionary belongs to a\nfraternity who are supposed to add to their other powers some skill in\ninterpreting the will of the Great Spirit in regard to the conduct of\nhis people. He occasionally makes offerings and sacrifices which are\nregarded as propitiatory. In this sense, the term “priest” may be deemed\napplicable to him. He is also a “prophet” in so far as he is, in a\nlimited degree, an instructor; but he does not claim to possess the gift\nof foretelling future events.",
        "A person is selected to join the fraternity of the “Medicine-man” by\nthose already initiated, chiefly on account of some skill or sagacity\nthat has been observed in him. Sometimes it happens that a person who\nhas had a severe illness which has yielded to the prescriptions of one\nof the members, is considered a proper object of choice from a sort of\nclaim thus established.",
        "When he is about to be initiated, a great feast is made, of course at\nthe expense of the candidate, for in simple as in civilized life the\nsame principle of politics holds good, “honors must be paid for.” An\nanimal is killed and dressed, of which the people at large\npartake–there are dances and songs and speeches in abundance. Then the\nchief Medicine-man takes the candidate and privately instructs him in\nall the ceremonies and knowledge necessary to make him an accomplished\nmember of the fraternity. Sometimes the new member selected is still a\nchild. In that case he is taken by the Medicine-man so soon as he\nreaches a proper age, and qualified by instruction and example to become\na creditable member of the fraternity.",
        "Among the Winnebagoes there seems a considerable belief in magic. Each\nMedicine-man has a bag or sack, in which is supposed to be inclosed some\nanimal, to whom, in the course of their pow-wows, he addresses\nhimself, crying to him in the note common to his imagined species. And\nthe people seem to be persuaded that the answers which are announced are\nreally communications, in this form, from the Great Spirit.",
        "The Indians appear to have no idea of a retribution beyond this life.\nThey have a strong appreciation of the great fundamental virtues of\nnatural religion–the worship of the Great Spirit, brotherly love,\nparental affection, honesty, temperance, and chastity. Any infringement\nof the laws of the Great Spirit, by a departure from these virtues, they\nbelieve will excite his anger and draw down punishment. These are their\nprinciples. That their practice evinces more and more a departure from\nthem, under the debasing influences of a proximity to the whites, is a\nmelancholy truth, which no one will admit with so much sorrow as those\nwho lived among them, and esteemed them, before this signal change had\ntaken place.",
        "One of the first improvements that suggested itself about our new\ndwelling, was the removal of some very unsightly pickets surrounding two\nor three Indian graves, on the esplanade in front of the house. Such,\nhowever, is the reverence in which these burial-places are held, that we\nfelt we must approach the subject with great delicacy and consideration.",
        "My husband at length ventured to propose to Mrs. “Pawnee Blanc,” the\nnearest surviving relative of the person interred, to replace the\npickets with a neat wooden platform.",
        "The idea pleased her much, for, through her intimacy in Paquette’s\nfamily, she had acquired something of a taste for civilization.\nAccordingly, a little platform about a foot in height, properly finished\nwith a moulding around the edge, was substituted for the worn and\nblackened pickets; and it was touching to witness the mournful\nsatisfaction with which two or three old crones would come regularly\nevery evening at sunset, to sit and gossip over the ashes of their\ndeparted relatives.",
        "On the fine moonlight nights, too, there might often be seen a group\nsitting there, and enjoying what is to them a solemn hour, for they\nentertain the poetic belief that “the moon was made to give light to the\ndead.”",
        "The reverence of the Indians for the memory of their departed friends,\nand their dutiful attention in visiting and making offerings to the\nGreat Spirit, over their last resting-places, is an example worthy of\nimitation among their more enlightened brethren. Not so, however, with\nsome of their customs in relation to the dead.",
        "The news of the decease of one of their number is a signal for a general\nmourning and lamentation; it is also in some instances, I am sorry to\nsay, when the means and appliances can be found, the apology for a\ngeneral carouse.",
        "The relatives weep and howl for grief–the friends and acquaintance bear\nthem company through sympathy. A few of their number are deputed to wait\nupon their Father, to inform him of the event, and to beg some presents\n\"to help them,” as they express it, “dry up their tears.”",
        "We received such a visit one morning, not long after the payment was\nconcluded.",
        "A drunken little Indian, named, by the French people around, “Old\nBoilvin,” from his resemblance to an Indian Agent of that name at\nPrairie du Chien, was the person on account of whose death the\napplication was made. “He had been fishing,” they said, “on the shores\nof one of the little lakes near the Portage, and, having taken a little\ntoo much ’whiskee,’ had fallen into the water and been drowned.\"\nNothing of him had been found but his blanket on the bank, so there\ncould be no funeral ceremonies, but his friends were prepared to make a\ngreat lamentation about him.",
        "Their Father presented them with tobacco, knives, calico, and\nlooking-glasses, in proportion to what he thought might be their\nreasonable grief at the loss of such a worthless vagabond, and they\ndeparted.",
        "There was no difficulty, notwithstanding the stringent prohibitions on\nthe subject, in procuring a keg of whiskey from some of the traders who\nyet remained. Armed with that and their other treasures, they assembled\nat an appointed spot, not far from the scene of the catastrophe, and,\nsitting down with the keg in their midst, they commenced their\naffliction. The more they drank, the more clamorous became their grief,\nand the faster flowed their tears.",
        "In the midst of these demonstrations, a little figure, bent and\nstaggering, covered with mud and all in disorder, with a countenance\nfull of wonder and sympathy, approached them, and began,–",
        "“Why? what? what? Who’s dead?”",
        "“Who’s dead?” repeated they, looking up in astonishment. “Why, you’re\ndead! you were drowned in Swan Lake! Did not we find your blanket there?\nCome, sit down and help us mourn.”",
        "The old man did not wait for a second invitation. He took his seat and\ncried and drank with the rest, weeping and lamenting as bitterly as any\nof them, and the strange scene was continued as long as they had power\nto articulate, or any portion of the whiskey was left.",
        "The Indians, of whatever tribe, are exceedingly fond of narrating or\nlistening to tales and stories, whether historical or fictitious. They\nhave their professed storytellers, like the Oriental nations, and these\ngo about, from village to village, collecting an admiring and attentive\naudience, however oft-told and familiar the matter they recite.",
        "It is in this way that their traditions are preserved and handed down\nunimpaired from generation to generation. Their knowledge of the\ngeography of their country is wonderfully exact. I have seen an Indian\nsit in his lodge, and draw a map, in the ashes, of the Northwestern\nStates, not of their statistical but their geographical features, lakes,\nrivers, and mountains, with the greatest accuracy, giving their relative\ndistances, by days’ journeys, without hesitation, and even extending his\ndrawings and explanations as far as Kentucky and Tennessee.",
        "Of biography they preserve not only the leading events in the life of\nthe person, but his features, appearance, and bearing, his manners, and\nwhatever little trait or peculiarity characterized him.",
        "The women are more fond of fiction, and some of their stories have a\nstrange mingling of humor and pathos. I give the two which follow as\nspecimens. The Indian names contained in them are in the Ottawa or\n\"Courte-Oreilles\" language, but the same tales are current in all the\ndifferent tongues and dialects.",
        "STORY OF THE RED FOX.",
        "This is an animal to which many peculiarities are attributed. He is said\nto resemble the jackal in his habit of molesting the graves of the dead,\nand the Indians have a superstitious dread of hearing his bark at night,\nbelieving that it forebodes calamity and death. They say, too, that he\nwas originally of one uniform reddish-brown color, but that his legs\nbecame black in the manner related in the story.",
        "There was a chief of a certain village who had a beautiful daughter. He\nresolved upon one occasion to make a feast and invite all the animals.\nWhen the invitation was brought to the red fox, he inquired, “What are\nyou going to have for supper?”",
        "“Mee-dau-mee-nau-bo,” was the reply. (This is a porridge made of\nparched corn, slightly cracked.)",
        "The fox turned up his little sharp nose. “No, I thank you,” said he; “I\ncan get plenty of that at home.”",
        "The messenger returned to the chief, and reported the contemptuous\nrefusal of the fox.",
        "“Go back to him,” said the chief, “and tell him we are going to have a\nnice fresh body,[48] and we will have it cooked in the most delicate\nmanner possible.”",
        "Pleased with the prospect of such a treat, the fox gave a very hearty\nassent to the second invitation.",
        "The hour arrived, and he set off for the lodge of the chief to attend\nthe feast. The company were all prepared for him, for they made common\ncause with their friend who had been insulted. As the fox entered, the\nguest next the door, with great courtesy, rose from his place, and\nbegged the new-comer to be seated. Immediately the person next him also\nrose, and insisted that the fox should occupy his place, as it was still\nnearer the fire–the post of honor. Then the third, with many\nexpressions of civility, pressed him to exchange with him; and thus,\nwith many ceremonious flourishes, he was passed along the circle, always\napproaching the fire, where a huge cauldron stood, in which the good\ncheer was still cooking. The fox was by no means unwilling to occupy the\nhighest place in the assembly, and, besides, he was anxious to take a\npeep into the kettle, for he had his suspicions that he might be\ndisappointed of the delicacies he had been expecting.",
        "So, by degrees, he was ushered nearer and nearer the great blazing\nfire, until by a dexterous push and shove he was hoisted into the\nseething kettle.",
        "His feet were dreadfully scalded, but he leaped out, and ran home to his\nlodge, howling and crying with pain. His grandmother, with whom,\naccording to the custom of animals, he lived, demanded of him an account\nof the affair. When he had faithfully related all the circumstances\n(for, unlike the civilized animals, he did not think of telling his\ngrandmother a story), she reproved him very strongly.",
        "“You have committed two great faults,” said she. “In the first place,\nyou were very rude to the chief who was so kind as to invite you, and by\nreturning insult for civility you made yourself enemies who were\ndetermined to punish you. In the next place, it was very unbecoming in\nyou to be so forward to take the place of honor. Had you been contented\nmodestly to keep your seat near the door, you would have escaped the\nmisfortune that has befallen you.”",
        "All this was not very consolatory to the poor fox, who continued to\nwhine and cry most piteously, while his grandmother, having finished her\nlecture, proceeded to bind up his wounds. Great virtue is supposed to be\nadded to all medical prescriptions and applications by a little dancing;\nso, the dressing having been applied, the grandmother fell to dancing\nwith all her might, round and round in the lodge.",
        "When she was nearly exhausted, the fox said, “Grandmother, take off the\nbandages and see if my legs are healed.”",
        "She did as he requested, but no–the burns were still fresh. She danced\nand danced again. Now and then, as he grew impatient, she would remove\nthe coverings to observe the effect of the remedies. At length, towards\nmorning, she looked, and, to be sure, the burns were quite healed. “But,\noh!” cried she, “your legs are as black as a coal! They were so badly\nburned that they will never return to their color!”",
        "The poor fox, who, like many another brave, was vain of his legs, fell\ninto a transport of lamentation.",
        "“Oh! my legs! My pretty red legs! What shall I do? The young girls will\nall despise me. I shall never dare to show myself among them again!”",
        "He cried and sobbed until his grandmother, fatigued with her exercise,\nfell asleep. By this time he had decided upon his plan of revenge.",
        "He rose and stole softly out of his lodge, and, pursuing his way rapidly\ntowards the village of the chief, he turned his face in the direction of\nthe principal lodge and barked. When the inhabitants heard this sound in\nthe stillness of the night, their hearts trembled. They knew that it\nforeboded sorrow and trouble to some one of their number.",
        "A very short time elapsed before the beautiful daughter of the chief\nfell sick, and she grew rapidly worse and worse, spite of medicines,\ncharms, and dances. At length she died. The fox had not intended to\nbring misfortune on the village in this shape, for he loved the\nbeautiful daughter of the chief, so he kept in his lodge and mourned and\nfretted for her death.",
        "Preparations were made for a magnificent funeral, but the friends of the\ndeceased were in great perplexity. “If we bury her in the earth,” said\nthey, “the fox will come and disturb her remains. He has barked her to\ndeath, and he will be glad to come and finish his work of revenge.”",
        "They took counsel together, and determined to hang her body high in a\ntree as a place of sepulture. They thought the fox would go groping\nabout in the earth, and not lift up his eyes to the branches above his\nhead.",
        "But the grandmother had been at the funeral, and she returned and told\nthe fox all that had been done.",
        "“Now, my son,” said she, “listen to me. Do not meddle with the remains\nof the chief’s daughter. You have done mischief enough already. Leave\nher in peace.”",
        "As soon as the grandmother was asleep at night, the fox rambled forth.\nHe soon found the place he sought, and came and sat under the tree where\nthe young girl had been placed. He gazed and gazed at her all the\nlivelong night, and she appeared as beautiful as when in life. But when\nthe day dawned, and the light enabled him to see more clearly, then he\nobserved that decay was doing its work–that instead of a beautiful she\npresented only a loathsome appearance.",
        "He went home sad and afflicted, and passed all the day mourning in his\nlodge.",
        "“Have you disturbed the remains of the chief’s beautiful daughter?” was\nhis parent’s anxious question.",
        "“No, grandmother,\"–and he uttered not another word.",
        "Thus it went on for many days and nights. The fox always took care to\nquit his watch at the early dawn of day, for he knew that her friends\nwould suspect him, and come betimes to see if all was right.",
        "At length he perceived that, gradually, the young girl looked less and\nless hideous in the morning light, and that she by degrees resumed the\nappearance she had presented in life, so that in process of time her\nbeauty and look of health quite returned to her.",
        "One day he said, “Grandmother, give me my pipe, that I may take a\nsmoke.”",
        "“Ah!” cried she, “you begin to be comforted. You have never smoked\nsince the death of the chief’s beautiful daughter. Have you heard some\ngood news?”",
        "“Never you mind,” said he; “bring the pipe.”",
        "He sat down and smoked, and smoked. After a time he said, “Grandmother,\nsweep your lodge and put it all in order, for this day you will receive\na visit from your daughter-in-law.”",
        "The grandmother did as she was desired. She swept her lodge, and\narranged it with all the taste she possessed, and then both sat down to\nawait the visit.",
        "“When you hear a sound at the door,” said the fox, “you must give the\nsalutation, and say, Come in.”",
        "When they had been thus seated for a time, the grandmother heard a\nfaint, rustling sound. She looked towards the door. To her surprise, the\nmat which usually hung as a curtain was rolled up, and the door was\nopen.",
        "“Peen-tee-geen n’dau-nis!\"[49] cried she.",
        "Something like a faint, faint shadow appeared to glide in. It took\ngradually a more distinct outline. As she looked and looked, she began\nto discern the form and features of the chief’s beautiful daughter, but\nit was long before she appeared like a reality, and took her place in\nthe lodge like a thing of flesh and blood.",
        "They kept the matter hid very close, for they would not for the world\nthat the father or friends of the bride should know what had happened.\nSoon, however, it began to be rumored about that the chief’s beautiful\ndaughter had returned to life, and was living in the Red Fox’s lodge.\nHow it ever became known was a mystery, for, of course, the grandmother\nnever spoke of it.",
        "Be that as it may, the news created great excitement in the village.\n\"This must never be,” said they all. “He barked her to death once, and\nwho knows what he may do next time?”",
        "The father took at once a decided part. “The Red Fox is not worthy of my\ndaughter,” he said. “I had promised her to the Hart, the finest and most\nelegant among the animals. Now that she has returned to life, I shall\nkeep my word.”",
        "So the friends all went in a body to the lodge of the Red Fox. The\nbridegroom, the bride, and the grandmother made all the resistance\npossible, but they were overpowered by numbers, and, the Hart having\nremained conveniently waiting on the outside where there was no danger,\nthe beautiful daughter of the chief was placed upon his back, and he\ncoursed away through the forest to carry her to his own home. When he\narrived at the door of his lodge, however, he turned his head, but no\nbride was in the place where he expected to see her. He had thought his\nburden very light from the beginning, but that he supposed was natural\nto spirits returned from the dead. He never imagined she had at the\noutset glided from her seat, and in the midst of the tumult slipped\nback, unobserved, to her chosen husband.",
        "One or two attempts were made by the friends, after this, to repossess\nthemselves of the young creature, but all without success. Then they\nsaid, “Let her remain where she is. It is true the Red Fox occasioned\nher death, but by his watchfulness and care he caressed her into life\nagain; therefore she rightfully belongs to him.” So the Red Fox and his\nbeautiful bride lived long together in great peace and happiness.",
        "There was a young man named Shee-shee-banze (the Little Duck) paddling\nhis canoe along the shore of the lake.",
        "Two girls came down to the edge of the water, and, seeing him, the elder\nsaid to the younger, “Let us call to him to take us a sail.”",
        "It must be remarked that in all Indian stories where two or more sisters\nare the dramatis personae, the elder is invariably represented as\nsilly, ridiculous, and disgusting–the younger, as wise and beautiful.",
        "In the present case the younger remonstrated. “Oh, no,” said she, “let\nus not do such a thing. What will he think of us?”",
        "But the other persevered, and called to him, “Ho! come and take us into\nyour canoe.” The young man obeyed, and, approaching the shore, he took\nthem with him into the canoe.",
        "“Who are you?” asked the elder sister.",
        "“I am Way-gee-mar-kin,” replied he, “the great chief.”",
        "This Way-gee-mar-kin was something of a fairy, for when surrounded by\nhis followers, and wishing to confer favors on them, he had a habit of\ncoughing slightly, when there would fly forth from his mouth quantities\nof silver brooches, ear-bobs, and other ornaments, for which it was the\ncustom of his people to scramble, each striving, as in more civilized\nlife, to get more than his share.",
        "Accordingly, the elder sister said, “If you are Way-gee-mar-kin, let us\nsee you cough.”",
        "Shee-shee-banze had a few of these silver ornaments which he had got by\nscrambling, and which he kept stowed away in the sides of his mouth in\ncase of emergency. So he gave some spasmodic coughs and brought forth a\nfew, which the girl eagerly seized.",
        "After a time, as they paddled along, a fine noble elk came forth from\nthe forest, and approached the water to drink.",
        "“What is that?” asked the spokeswoman; for the younger sister sat silent\nand modest all the time.",
        "“It is my dog that I hunt with.”",
        "“Call him to us, that I may see him.”",
        "Shee-shee-banze called, but the elk turned and fled into the woods.",
        "“He does not seem to obey you, however.”",
        "“No; it is because you inspire him with disgust, and therefore he flies\nfrom you.”",
        "Soon a bear made his appearance by the water’s edge.",
        "“What is that?”",
        "“One of my servants.”",
        "Again he was requested to call him, and, as the call was disregarded,\nthe same reason as before was assigned.",
        "Their excursion was at length ended. There had been a little magic in\nit, for although the young girls had supposed themselves to be in a\ncanoe, there was, in reality, no canoe at all. They only imagined it to\nhave been so.",
        "Now, Shee-shee-banze lived with his grandmother, and to her lodge he\nconducted his young friends.",
        "They stood outside while he went in.",
        "“Grandmother,” said he, “I have brought you two young girls, who will be\nyour daughters-in-law. Invite them into your lodge.”",
        "Upon this, the old woman called, “Ho! come in,” and they entered. They\nwere made welcome and treated to the best of everything.",
        "In the mean time, the real Way-gee-mar-kin, the great chief, made\npreparations for a grand feast. When he was sending his messenger out\nwith the invitations, he said to him, “Be very particular to bid\nShee-shee-banze to the feast, for, as he is the smallest and meanest\nperson in the tribe, you must use double ceremony with him, or he will\nbe apt to think himself slighted.”",
        "Shee-shee-banze was sitting in his lodge with his new friends, when the\nmessenger arrived.",
        "“Ho! Shee-shee-banze,” cried he, “you are invited to a great feast that\nWay-gee-mar-kin is to give to-night, to all his subjects.”",
        "But Shee-shee-banze took no notice of the invitation. He only whistled,\nand pretended not to hear. The messenger repeated his words, then,\nfinding that no attention was paid to them, he went his way.",
        "The young girls looked at each other, during the scene, greatly\nastonished. At length the elder spoke.",
        "“What does this mean?” said she. “Why does he call you Shee-shee-banze,\nand invite you to visit Way-gee-mar-kin?”",
        "“Oh,” said Shee-shee-banze, “it is one of my followers that always likes\nto be a little impudent. I am obliged to put up with it sometimes, but\nyou observed that I treated him with silent contempt.”",
        "The messenger returned to the chief, and reported the manner in which\nthe invitation had been received.",
        "“Oh,” said the good-natured chief, “it is because he feels that he is\npoor and insignificant. Go back again–call him by my name, and make a\nflourishing speech to him.”",
        "The messenger fulfilled his mission as he was bid.",
        "“Way-gee-mar-kin,” said he, pompously, “a great feast is to be given\nto-night, and I am sent most respectfully to solicit the honor of your\ncompany!”",
        "“Did I not tell you?” said Shee-shee-banze to the maidens Then, nodding\nwith careless condescension, he added, “Tell them I’ll come.”",
        "At night, Shee-shee-banze dressed himself in his very best paint,\nfeathers, and ornaments–but before his departure he took his\ngrandmother aside.",
        "“Be sure,” said he, “that you watch these young people closely until I\ncome back. Shut up your lodge tight, tight. Let no one come in or go\nout, and, above all things, do not go to sleep.”",
        "These orders given, he went his way.",
        "The grandmother tried her best to keep awake, but finding herself\ngrowing more and more sleepy, as the night wore on, she took a strong\ncord and laced across the mat which hung before the entrance to the\nlodge, as the Indians lace up the mouths of their bags, then, having\nseen all things secure and the girls quiet in bed, she lay down and soon\nfell into a comfortable sleep.",
        "The young girls, in the mean while, were dying with curiosity to know\nwhat had become of Shee-shee-banze, and as soon as they were sure the\nold lady was asleep, they prepared to follow him and see what was going\non. Fearing, however, that the grandmother might awake and discover\ntheir absence, they took two logs of wood, and, putting them under the\nblanket, so disposed them as to present the appearance of persons\nsleeping quietly. They then cut the cords that fastened the door, and,\nguided by the sounds of the music, the dancing, and the merry-making,\nthey soon found their way to the dwelling of Way-gee-mar-kin.",
        "When they entered, they saw the chief seated on a throne, surrounded by\nlight and splendor. Everything was joy and amusement. Crowds of\ncourtiers were in the apartment, all dressed in the most brilliant\narray. The strangers looked around for their friend Shee-shee-banze, but\nhe was nowhere to be seen.",
        "Now and then the chief would cough, when a shower of silver ornaments\nand precious things would fly in all directions, and instantly a\nscramble would commence among the company, to gather them up and\nappropriate them.",
        "As they thus rushed forward, the brides-elect saw their poor little\nfriend crowded up into a corner, where nobody took any notice of him,\nexcept to push him aside, or step on him whenever he was in the way. He\nuttered piteous little squeaks as one and another would thus maltreat\nhim, but he was too busy taking care of himself to perceive that those\nwhom he had left snug at home in the lodge were witnesses of all that\nwas going on.",
        "At length the signal was given for the company to retire, all but the\ntwo young damsels, upon whom Way-gee-mar-kin had set his eye, and to\nwhom he had sent, by one of his assistants, great offers to induce them\nto remain with him and become his wives.",
        "Poor Shee-shee-banze returned to his lodge, but what was his\nconsternation to find the door open!",
        "“Ho! grandmother,” cried he, “is this the way you keep watch?”",
        "The old woman started up. “There are my daughters-in-law,” said she,\npointing to the two logs of wood. Shee-shee-banze threw himself on the\nground between them. His back was broken by coming so violently in\ncontact with them, but that he did not mind–he thought only of revenge,\nand the recovery of his sweethearts.",
        "He waited but to get some powerful poison and prepare it, and then he\nstole softly back to the wigwam of Way-gee-mar-kin. All was silent, and\nhe crept in without making the slightest noise. There lay the chief,\nwith a young girl on each side of him.",
        "They were all sound asleep, the chief lying on his back, with his mouth\nwide open. Before he was aware of it, the poison was down his throat,\nand Shee-shee-banze had retreated quietly to his own lodge.",
        "The next morning the cry went through the village that Way-gee-mar-kin\nhad been found dead in his bed. Of course it was attributed to\nover-indulgence at the feast. All was grief and lamentation. “Let us go\nand tell poor Shee-shee-banze,” said one, “he was so fond of\nWay-gee-mar-kin.”",
        "They found him sitting on a bank, fishing. He had been up at peep of\nday, to make preparation for receiving the intelligence.",
        "He had caught two or three fish, and, extracting their bladders, had\nfilled them with blood, and tied them under his arm. When the friends of\nWay-gee-mar-kin saw him, they called out to him,–",
        "“Oh! Shee-shee-banze–your friend, Way-gee-mar-kin, is dead!”",
        "With a gesture of despair, Shee-shee-banze drew his knife and plunged\nit–not into his heart, but into the bladders filled with blood that he\nhad prepared. As he fell, apparently lifeless, to the ground, the\nmessengers began to reproach themselves: “Oh! why did we tell him so\nsuddenly? We might have known he would not survive it. Poor\nShee-shee-banze! he loved Way-gee-mar-kin so.”",
        "To their great surprise, the day after the funeral, Shee-shee-banze came\nwalking towards the wigwam of the dead chief. As he walked, he sang, or\nrather chaunted to a monotonous strain,[50] the following:–",
        "  “Way-gee-mar-kin is dead, is dead,\n  I know who killed him.\n  I guess it was I–I guess it was I.”",
        "All the village was aroused. Everybody flew in pursuit of the murderer,\nbut he evaded them, and escaped to a place of safety.",
        "Soon after, he again made his appearance, mincing as he walked, and\nsinging to the same strain as before,–",
        "  “If you wish to take and punish me,\n  Let the widows come and catch me.”",
        "It seemed a good idea, and the young women were recommended to go and\nentice the culprit into the village, so that the friends of the deceased\ncould lay hold of him.",
        "They went forth on their errand. Shee-shee-banze would suffer them to\napproach, then he would dance off a little–now he would allow them to\ncome quite near; anon he would retreat a little before them, all the\ntime singing,",
        "“Come, pretty widows, come and catch me.”",
        "Thus he decoyed them on, occasionally using honeyed words and flattering\nspeeches, until he had gained their consent to return with him to his\nlodge, and take up their abode with him.",
        "The friends of the murdered chief were scandalized at such inconstancy,\nand resolved to punish all three, as soon as they could catch them.",
        "They surrounded his lodge with cries and threatenings, but\nShee-shee-banze and his two brides had contrived to elude their\nvigilance and gain his canoe, which lay in the river, close at hand.",
        "Hardly were they on board when their escape was discovered. The whole\ntroop flew after them. Some plunged into the stream, and seized the\ncanoe. In the struggle it was upset, but immediately on touching the\nwater, whether from the magical properties of the canoe, or the\nnecromantic skill of the grandmother, they were transformed into ducks,\nand flew quacking away.",
        "Since that time the water-fowl of this species are always found in\ncompanies of three–two females and a male.",
        "The Canard de France, or Mallard, and the Brancheuse, or Wood Duck,\nare of different habits from the foregoing, flying in pairs. Indeed, the\nconstancy of the latter is said to be so great that if he loses his mate\nhe never takes another partner, but goes mourning to the end of his\ndays.",
        "The payment over, and the Indians dispersed, we prepared ourselves to\nsettle down quietly in our little home. But now a new source of\ndisturbance arose.",
        "My husband’s accounts of disbursements as Agent of the Winnebagoes,\nwhich he had forwarded to the Department at Washington, had failed to\nreach there, of which he received due notice–that is to say, such a\nnotice as could reach us by the circuitous and uncertain mode of\nconveyance by which intercourse with the Eastern world was then kept up.\nIf the vouchers for the former expenditures, together with the recent\npayment of $15,000 annuity money, should not be forthcoming, it might\nplace him in a very awkward position; he therefore decided to go at once\nto Washington, and be the bearer himself of his duplicate accounts.",
        "“Should you like to go and see your father and mother,” said he to me,\none morning, “and show them how the West agrees with you?”",
        "It was a most joyful suggestion after a year’s separation, and in a few\ndays all things were in readiness for our departure.",
        "There was visiting us, at that time, Miss Brush, of Detroit, who had\ncome from Green Bay with Mr. and Mrs. Whitney and Miss Frances Henshaw,\non an excursion to the Mississippi. Our little India-rubber house had\ncontrived to expand itself for the accommodation of the whole party\nduring the very pleasant visit they made us.",
        "The arrival of two young ladies had been, as may be imagined, quite a\ngodsend to the unmarried lieutenants, and when, tired of the journey, or\nintimidated by the snow, which fell eight inches on the 4th of October,\nMiss Brush determined to give up the remainder of her excursion, and\naccept our pressing invitation to remain with us until the return of her\nfriends, we were looked upon as public benefactors. She was now to\naccompany us to Green Bay, and possibly to Detroit.",
        "Our voyage down the river was without incident, and we reached Green Bay\njust as all the place was astir in the expectation of the arrival of one\nof Mr. Newbery’s schooners. This important event was the subject of\ninterest to the whole community, from Fort Howard to “Dickenson’s.” To\nsome its arrival would bring friends, to some supplies–to the ladies,\nthe fashions, to the gentlemen, the news, for it was the happy bearer of\nthe mails, not for that place alone, but for all the “upper country.”",
        "In a few days the vessel arrived. She brought a mail for Fort Winnebago,\nit being only in the winter season that letters were carried by land to\nthat place, via Niles’s Settlement and Chicago.",
        "In virtue of his office as Postmaster, my husband opened the mail-bag,\nand took possession of his own letters. One informed him of the\nsatisfactory appearance at the Department of the missing accounts, but\noh! sad disappointment, another brought the news that my parents had\ngone to Kentucky for the winter–not to any city or accessible place,\nbut “up the Sandy,” and over among the mountains of Virginia, hunting up\nold land-claims belonging to my grandfather’s estate.",
        "It was vain to hope to follow them. We might hardly expect to find them\nduring the short period we could be absent from home–not even were we\nto receive the lucid directions once given my father by an old settler\nduring his explorations through that wild region.",
        "“You must go up Tug,” said the man, “and down Troublesome, and fall\nover on to Kingdom-come.\"[51]",
        "We did not think it advisable to undertake such an expedition, and\ntherefore made up our minds to retrace our steps to Fort Winnebago.",
        "No boats were in readiness to ascend the river. Our old friend Hamilton\npromised to have one in preparation at once, but time passed by, and no\nboat was made ready.",
        "It was now the beginning of November. We were passing our time very\npleasantly with the Irwins and Whitneys, and at the residence of\nColonel Stambaugh, the Indian Agent, but still this delay was\ninconvenient and vexatious.",
        "I suggested undertaking the journey on horseback. “No, indeed,” was the\nanswer I invariably received. “No mortal woman has ever gone that road,\nunless it was some native on foot, nor ever could.”",
        "“But suppose we set out in the boat and get frozen in on the way. We can\nneither pass the winter there, nor possibly find our way to a human\nhabitation. We have had one similar experience already. Is it not better\nto take it for granted that I can do what you and others of your sex\nhave done?”",
        "Dr. Finley, the post-surgeon at Fort Howard, on hearing the matter\ndebated, offered me immediately his favorite horse Charlie. “He is very\nsure-footed,” the doctor alleged, “and capital in a marsh or troublesome\nstream.”",
        "By land, then, it was decided to go; and as soon as our old Menomonee\nfriend “Wish-tay-yun,” who was as good a guide by land as by water,\ncould be summoned, we set off, leaving our trunks to be forwarded by\nHamilton whenever it should please him to carry out his intention of\nsending up his boat.",
        "We waited until a late hour on the morning of our departure for our\nfellow-travellers, Mr. Wing, of Monroe, and Dr. Philleo, of Galena; but,\nfinding they did not join us, we resolved to lose no time, confident\nthat we should all meet at the Kakalin in the course of the evening.",
        "After crossing the river at what is now Depere, and entering the wild,\nunsettled country on the west of the river, we found a succession of\nwooded hills, separated by ravines so narrow and steep that it seemed\nimpossible that any animals but mules or goats could make their way\namong them.",
        "Wish-tay-yun took the lead. The horse he rode was accustomed to the\ncountry, and well trained to this style of road. As for Charlie, he was\nperfectly admirable. When he came to a precipitous descent, he would set\nforward his forefeet, and slide down on his haunches in the most\nscientific manner, while my only mode of preserving my balance was to\nhold fast by the bridle and lay myself braced almost flat against his\nback. Then our position would suddenly change, and we would be scaling\nthe opposite bank, at the imminent risk of falling backward into the\nravine below.",
        "It was amusing to see Wish-tay-yun, as he scrambled on ahead, now and\nthen turning partly round to see how I fared. And when, panting and\nlaughing, I at length reached the summit, he would throw up his hands,\nand shout, with the utmost glee, “Mamma Manitou!” (My mother is a\nspirit.)",
        "Our old acquaintances, the Grignons, seemed much surprised that I should\nhave ventured on such a journey. They had never undertaken it, although\nthey had lived so long at the Kakalin; but then there was no reason why\nthey should have done so. They could always command a canoe or a boat\nwhen they wished to visit “the Bay.”",
        "As we had anticipated, our gentlemen joined us at supper. “They had\ndelayed to take dinner with Colonel Stambaugh–had had a delightful\ngallop up from: the Bay–had seen no ravines, nor anything but fine\nsmooth roads–might have been asleep, but, if so, were not conscious of\nit.” This was the account they gave of themselves, to our no small\namusement.",
        "From the Kakalin to the Butte des Morts, where lived a man named Knaggs,\nwas our next day’s stage. The country was rough and wild, much like that\nwe had passed through the spring before, in going from Hamilton’s\ndiggings to Kellogg’s Grove, but we were fortunate in having\nWish-tay-yun, rather than “Uncle Billy,” for our guide, so that we could\nmake our way with some degree of moderation.",
        "We had travelled but forty miles when we reached Knaggs’s, yet I was\nboth cold and fatigued, so that the cosy little room in which we found\nMrs. Knaggs, and the bright fire, were most cheering objects; and, as we\nhad only broken our fast since morning with a few crackers we carried in\nour pockets, I must own we did ample justice to her nice coffee and\ncakes, not to mention venison-steaks and bear’s meat, the latter of\nwhich I had never before tasted.",
        "Our supper over, we looked about for a place of repose. The room in\nwhich we had taken our meal was of small dimensions, just sufficient to\naccommodate a bed, a table placed against the wall, and the few chairs\non which we sat. There was no room for any kind of a “shakedown.”",
        "“Where can you put us for the night?” inquired my husband of Mr. Knaggs,\nwhen he made his appearance.",
        "“Why, there is no place that I know of, unless you can camp down in the\nold building outside.”",
        "We went to look at it. It consisted of one room, bare and dirty. A huge\nchimney, in which a few brands were burning, occupied nearly one side of\nthe apartment. Against another was built a rickety sort of bunk. This\nwas the only vestige of furniture to be seen. The floor was thickly\ncovered with mud and dirt, in the midst of which, near the fire, was\nseated an old Indian with a pan of boiled corn on his lap, which he was\nscooping up with both hands and devouring with the utmost voracity.",
        "We soon discovered that he was blind. On hearing footsteps and voices,\nhe instinctively gathered his dish of food close to him, and began some\nmorose grumblings; but when he was told that it was “Shaw-nee-aw-kee\"\nwho was addressing him, his features relaxed into a more agreeable\nexpression, and be even held forth his dish and invited us to share its\ncontents.",
        "“But are we to stay here?” I asked. “Can we not sleep out-of-doors?”",
        "“We have no tent,” replied my husband, “and the weather is too cold to\nrisk the exposure without one.”",
        "“I could sit in a chair all night, by the fire.”",
        "“Then you would not be able to ride to Bellefontaine to-morrow.”",
        "There was no alternative. The only thing Mr. Knaggs could furnish in the\nshape of bedding was a small bear-skin. The bunk was a trifle less\nfilthy than the floor; so upon its boards we spread first the skin, then\nour saddle-blankets, and, with a pair of saddle-bags for a bolster, I\nwrapped myself in my cloak, and resigned myself to my distasteful\naccommodations.",
        "The change of position from that I had occupied through the day,\nprobably brought some rest, but sleep I could not. Even on a softer and\nmore agreeable couch, the snoring of the old Indian and two or three\ncompanions who had joined him, and his frequent querulous exclamations\nas he felt himself encroached upon in the darkness, would have\neffectually banished slumber from my eyes.",
        "It was a relief to rise with early morning and prepare for the journey\nof the day. Where our fellow-travellers had bestowed themselves I knew\nnot, but they evidently had fared no better than we. They were in fine\nspirits, however, and we cheerfully took our breakfast and were ferried\nover the river to continue on the trail from that point to\nBellefontaine, twelve miles distant from Fort Winnebago.",
        "The great “bug-bear” of this road, Ma-zhee-gaw-gaw Swamp, was the next\nthing to be encountered. We reached it about nine o’clock. It spread\nbefore us, a vast expanse of morass, about half a mile in width, and of\nlength interminable, partly covered with water, with black knobs rising\nhere and there above the surface, affording a precarious foothold for\nthe animals in crossing it. Where the water was not, there lay in place\nof it a bed of black oozy mud, which looked as if it might give way\nunder the foot, and let it, at each step, sink to an unknown depth.",
        "This we were now to traverse. All three of the gentlemen went in advance\nof me, each hoping, as he said, to select the surest and firmest path\nfor me to follow. One and another would call, “Here, madam, come this\nway!” “This is the best path, wifie; follow me,” but often Charlie knew\nbetter than either, and selected a path according to his own judgment,\nwhich proved the best of the whole.",
        "On he went, picking his way so slowly and cautiously, now pausing on one\nlittle hillock, now on another, and anon turning aside to avoid a patch\nof mud which seemed more than usually suspicious, that all the company\nhad got some little distance ahead of me. On raising my eyes, which had\nbeen kept pretty closely on my horse’s footsteps, I saw my husband on\nfoot, striving to lead his horse by the bridle from a difficult position\ninto which he had got, Mr. Wing and his great white floundering animal\nlying sideways in the mud, the rider using all his efforts to extricate\nhimself from the stirrups, and Dr. Philleo standing at a little distance\nfrom his steed, who was doing his best to rise up from a deep bog into\nwhich he had pitched himself. It was a formidable sight! They all called\nout with one accord,–",
        "“Oh, do not come this way!”",
        "“Indeed,” cried I, “I have no thought of it. Charlie and I know better.\"\nAnd, trusting to the sagacious creature, he picked his way carefully\nalong, and carried me safely past the dismounted company. I could not\nrefrain from a little triumphant flourish with my whip, as I looked back\nupon them and watched their progress to their saddles once more.",
        "Three hours had we been thus unpleasantly engaged, and yet we were not\nover the “Slough of Despond.” At length we drew near its farthest verge.\nHere ran a deep stream some five or six feet in width. The gentlemen, as\nthey reached it, dismounted, and began debating what was to be done.",
        "“Jump off, jump off, madam,” cried Mr. Wing, and “Jump off, jump off,\"\nechoed Dr. Philleo; “we are just consulting how we are to get you\nacross.”",
        "“What do you think about it?” asked my husband.",
        "“Charlie will show you,” replied I. “Come, Charlie.” And as I raised his\nbridle quickly, with a pat on his neck and an encouraging chirp, he\nbounded over the stream as lightly as a deer, and landed me safe on\nterra firma.",
        "Poor Mr. Wing had fared the worst of the company; the clumsy animal he\nrode seeming to be of opinion when he got into a difficulty that he had\nnothing to do but to lie down and resign himself to his fate; while his\nrider, not being particularly light and agile, was generally undermost,\nand half imbedded in the mire before he had quite made up his mind as to\nhis course of action.",
        "It was therefore a wise movement in him, when he reached the little\nstream, to plunge into it and wade across, thus washing out, as much as\npossible, the traces of the morning’s adventures from himself and his\nsteed; and the other gentlemen, having no alternative, concluded to\nfollow his example.",
        "We did not halt long on the rising ground beyond the morass, for we had\na long stretch before us to Bellefontaine, forty-five miles, and those\nnone of the shortest.",
        "Our horses travelled admirably the whole afternoon, Charlie keeping a\ncanter all the way; but it was growing dark, and there were no signs of\nthe landmarks which were to indicate our near approach to the desired\nhaven.",
        "“Can we not stop and rest for a few moments under one of the trees?\"\ninquired I, for I was almost exhausted with fatigue, and, to add to our\ndiscomfort, a cold, November rain was pouring upon us.",
        "“If it were possible, we would,” was the reply; “but see how dark it is\ngrowing. If we should lose our way, it would be worse than being wet and\ntired.”",
        "So we kept on. Just at dark we crossed a clear stream. “That,” said my\nhusband, “is, I think, two miles from Bellefontaine. Cheer up–we shall\nsoon be there.” Quite encouraged, we pursued our way more cheerfully.\nMile after mile we passed, but still no light gleamed friendly through\nthe trees.",
        "“We have certainly travelled more than six miles now,” said I.",
        "“Yes–that could not have been the two-mile creek.”",
        "It was eight o’clock when we reached Bellefontaine. We were ushered into\na large room made cheerful by a huge blazing fire. Mr. Wing and Dr.\nPhilleo had arrived before us, and there were other travellers, on their\nway from the Mississippi. I was received with great kindness and\nvolubility by the immense hostess, “la grosse Américaine,” as she was\ncalled, and she soon installed me in the arm-chair, in the warmest\ncorner, and in due time set an excellent supper before us.",
        "But her hospitality did not extend to giving up her only bed for my\naccommodation. She spread all the things she could muster on the hard\nfloor before the fire, and did what she could to make me comfortable;\nthen, observing my husband’s solicitude lest I might feel ill from the\neffects of the fatigue and rain, she remarked, in tones of admiring\nsympathy, “How kind your companion is to you!\"–an expression which,\nas it was then new to us, amused us not a little.",
        "Our travelling companions started early in the morning for the Fort,\nwhich was but twelve miles distant, and they were so kind as to take\ncharge of a note to our friends at home, requesting them to send Plante\nwith the carriage to take us the rest of the distance.",
        "We reached the Portage in safety; and thus ended the first journey by\nland that any white woman had made from Green Bay to Fort Winnebago. I\nfelt not a little raised in my own esteem when my husband informed me\nthat the distance I had the previous day travelled, from Knaggs’s to\nBellefontaine, was sixty-two miles!",
        "A few weeks after our return, my husband took his mother to Prairie du\nChien for the benefit of medical advice from Dr. Beaumont, of the U.S.\nArmy. The journey was made in a large open boat down the Wisconsin\nRiver, and it was proposed to take this opportunity to bring back a good\nsupply of corn for the winter’s use of both men and cattle.",
        "The ice formed in the river, however, so early, that after starting\nwith his load he was obliged to return with it to the Prairie, and wait\nuntil the thick winter’s ice enabled him to make a second journey and\nbring it up in sleighs–with so great an expense of time, labor, and\nexposure were the necessaries of life conveyed from one point to another\nthrough that wild and desolate region!",
        "The arrival of my brother Arthur from Kentucky, by way of the\nMississippi, in the latter part of April, brought us the uncomfortable\nintelligence of new troubles with the Sauks and Foxes. Black Hawk had,\nwith the flower of his nation, recrossed the Mississippi, once more to\ntake possession of their old homes and corn-fields.[52]",
        "It was not long before our own Indians came flocking in, to confirm the\ntidings, and to assure us of their intention to remain faithful friends\nto the Americans. We soon heard of the arrival of the Illinois Rangers\nin the Rock River country, also of the progress of the regular force\nunder General Atkinson, in pursuit of the hostile Indians, who, by the\nreports, were always able to elude their vigilance. It not being their\ncustom to stop and give battle, the Sauks soon scattered themselves\nthrough the country, trusting to some lucky accident (and such arrived,\nalas! only too often) to enable them to fall upon their enemies\nunexpectedly.",
        "The experience of the pursuing army was, for the most part, to make\ntheir way, by toilsome and fatiguing marches, to the spot where they\nimagined the Sauks would be waiting to receive them, and then to\ndiscover that the rogues had scampered off to quite a different part of\nthe country.",
        "Wherever these latter went, their course was marked by the most\natrocious barbarities, though the worst had not, at this time, reached\nour ears. We were only assured that they were down in the neighborhood\nof the Rock River and Kishwaukee, and that they lost no opportunity of\nfalling upon the defenceless inhabitants and cruelly murdering them.",
        "As soon as it became certain that the Sauks and Foxes would not pursue\nthe same course they had on the previous year, that is, retreat\npeaceably across the Mississippi, Mr. Kinzie resolved to hold a council\nwith all the principal chiefs of the Winnebagoes who were accessible at\nthis time. He knew that the Sauks would use every effort to induce their\nneighbors to join them, and that there existed in the breasts of too\nmany of the young savages a desire to distinguish themselves by “taking\nsome white scalps.” They did not love the Americans–why should they? By\nthem they had been gradually dispossessed of the broad and beautiful\ndomains of their forefathers, and hunted from place to place, and the\nonly equivalent they had received in exchange had been a few thousands\nannually in silver and presents, together with the pernicious example,\nthe debasing influence, and the positive ill treatment of too many of\nthe new settlers upon their lands.",
        "With all these facts in view, therefore, their Father felt that the\nutmost watchfulness was necessary, and that the strongest arguments must\nbe brought forward, to preserve the young men of the Winnebagoes in\ntheir allegiance to the Americans. Of the older members he felt quite\nsure. About fifty lodges had come at the commencement of the\ndisturbances and encamped around our dwelling, saying that if the Sauks\nattacked us it must be after killing them; and, knowing them well, we\nhad perfect confidence in their assurances.",
        "But their vicinity, while it gave us a feeling of protection, likewise\nfurnished us with a channel of the most exciting and agitating daily\ncommunications. As the theatre of operations approached nearer and\nnearer, intelligence was brought in by their runners–now, that “Captain\nBarney’s head had been recognized in the Sauk camp, where it had been\nbrought the day previous,” next, that “the Sauks were carrying\nLieutenant Beall’s head on a pole in front of them as they marched to\nmeet the whites.” Sometimes it was a story which we afterwards found to\nbe unhappily true, as that of the murder of their Agent, M. St Vrain, at\nKellogg’s Grove, by the Sauks themselves, who ought to have protected\nhim.",
        "It was after the news of this last occurrence that the appointed council\nwith the Winnebagoes was to be held at the Four Lakes, thirty-five miles\ndistant from Fort Winnebago.",
        "In vain we pleaded and remonstrated against such an exposure. “It was\nhis duty to assemble his people and talk to them,” my husband said, “and\nhe must run the risk, if there were any. He had perfect confidence in\nthe Winnebagoes. The enemy, by all he could learn, were now far distant\nfrom the Four Lakes–probably at Kosh-ko-nong. He would set off early in\nthe morning with Paquette, bold his council, and return to us the same\nevening.”",
        "It were useless to attempt to describe our feelings during that long and\ndreary day. When night arrived, the cry of a drunken Indian, or even the\nbarking of a dog, would fill our hearts with terror.",
        "As we sat, at a late hour, at the open window, listening to every sound,\nwith what joy did we at length distinguish the tramp of horses! We knew\nit to be Griffin and Jerry ascending the hill, and a cheerful shout soon\nannounced that all was well. My husband and his interpreter had ridden\nseventy miles that day, besides holding a long “talk” with the Indians.",
        "The Winnebagoes in council had promised to use their utmost endeavors to\npreserve peace and good order among their young men. They informed their\nFather that the bands on the Rock River, with the exception of\nWin-no-sheek’s, were all determined to remain friendly and keep aloof\nfrom the Sauks. To that end, they were abandoning their villages and\ncorn-fields and moving north, that their Great Father, the President,\nmight not feel dissatisfied with them. With regard to Win-no-sheek and\nhis people, they professed themselves unable to answer.",
        "Time went on, and brought with it stories of fresh outrages. Among these\nwere the murders of Auberry, Green, and Force, at Blue Mound, and the\nattack on Apple Fort. The tidings of the latter were brought by old\nCrély,[53] the father of Mrs. Paquette, who rode express from Galena,\nand who averred that he once passed a bush behind which the Sauks were\nhiding, but that his horse smelt the sweet-scented grass with which they\nalways adorn their persons when on a war-party, and set out on such a\ngallop that he never stopped until he arrived at the Portage.",
        "Another bearer of news was a young gentleman named Follett, whose eyes\nhad become so protruded and set from keeping an anxious look-out for the\nenemy, that it was many days after his arrival at a place of safety\nbefore they resumed their accustomed limits and expression.",
        "Among other rumors which at this time reached us, was one that an attack\nupon Fort Winnebago was in contemplation among the Sauks. That this was\nin no state of defence the Indians very well knew. All the effective\nmen had been withdrawn, upon a requisition from General Atkinson, to\njoin him at his newly-built fort at Kosh-ko-nong.",
        "Fort Winnebago was not picketed in; there were no defences to the\nbarracks or officers’ quarters, except slight panelled doors and\nVenetian blinds–nothing that would long resist the blows of clubs or\nhatchets. There was no artillery, and the Commissary’s store was without\nthe bounds of the Fort, under the hill.",
        "Mr. Kinzie had, from the first, called the attention of the officers to\nthe insecurity of their position in case of danger, but he generally\nreceived a scoffing answer.",
        "“Never fear,” they would say; “the Sauks are not coming here to attack\nus.”",
        "One afternoon we were over on a visit to some ladies in the garrison,\nand, several officers being present, the conversation, as usual, turned\nupon the present position of affairs.",
        "“Do you not think it wiser,” inquired I of a blustering young officer,\n\"to be prepared against possible danger?”",
        "“Not against these fellows,” replied he, contemptuously.",
        "“I do not think I would even take the trouble to fasten the blinds to my\nquarters.”",
        "“At least,” said I, “if you some night find a tomahawk raised to cleave\nyour skull, you will have the consolation of remembering that you have\nnot been one of those foolish fellows who keep on the safe side.”",
        "He seemed a little nettled at this, and still more so when sister\nMargaret observed,–",
        "“For my part, I am of Governor Cass’s opinion. He was at Chicago during\nthe Winnebago war. We were all preparing to move into the fort on the\nfirst alarm. Some were for being brave and delaying, like our friends\nhere. ’Come, come,’ said the Governor, ’hurry into the fort as fast as\npossible–there is no merit in being brave with the Indians. It is the\nheight of folly to stay and meet danger which you may by prudence\navoid.’”",
        "In a few days our friends waked up to the conviction that something must\nbe done at once The first step was to forbid any Winnebago coming within\nthe garrison, lest they should find out what they had known as well as\nourselves for three months past–namely, the feebleness of the means of\nresistance. The next was to send fatigue-parties into the woods, under\nthe protection of a guard, to cut pickets for inclosing the garrison.",
        "There was every reason to believe that the enemy were not very far\ndistant, and that their object in coming north was to break a way into\nthe Chippewa country, where they would find a place of security among\ntheir friends and allies. The story that our Indian runners brought in\nmost frequently was, that the Sauks were determined to fall upon the\nwhites at the Portage and Fort, and massacre all, except the families of\nthe Agent and Interpreter.",
        "Plante and Pillon with their families had departed at the first word of\ndanger. There only remained with us Manaigre, whose wife was a\nhalf-Winnebago, Isidore Morrin, and the blacksmiths from Sugar\nCreek–Mâtâ and Turcotte.",
        "At night we were all regularly armed and our posts assigned us. After\nevery means had been taken to make the house secure, the orders were\ngiven. Sister Margaret and I, in case of attack, were to mount with the\nchildren to the rooms above, while my husband and his men were to make\ngood their defence as long as possible against the enemy. Since I had\nshown my sportsmanship by bringing down accidentally a blackbird on the\nwing, I felt as if I could do some execution with my little pistols,\nwhich were regularly placed beside my pillow at night; and I was fully\nresolved to use them, if necessity required. I do not remember to have\nfelt the slightest compunction at the idea of taking the lives of two\nSauks, as I had no doubt I should do; and this explains to me what I had\nbefore often wondered at, the indifference, namely, of the soldier on\nthe field of battle to the destruction of human life Had I been called\nupon, however, to use my weapons effectually, I should no doubt have\nlooked back upon it with horror.",
        "Surrounded as we were by Indian lodges, which seldom became perfectly\nquiet, and excited as our nerves had become by all that we were daily in\nthe habit of hearing, we rarely slept very soundly. One night, after we\nhad as much as possible composed ourselves, we were startled at a late\nhour by a tap upon the window at the head of our bed, and a call of\n\"Chon! Chon!\"[54] (John! John!)",
        "“Tshah-ko-zhah?” (What is it?)",
        "It was Hoo-wau-ne-kah, the Little Elk. He spoke rapidly, and in a tone\nof great agitation. I could not understand him, and I lay trembling, and\ndreading to hear his errand interpreted. Now and then I could\ndistinguish the words Sau-kee (Sauks) and Shoonk-hat-tay-rah (horse),\nand they were not very reassuring.",
        "The trouble, I soon learned, was this. A fresh trail had been observed\nnear the Petit Rocher, on the Wisconsin, and the people at the villages\non the Barribault were in a state of great alarm, fearing it might be\nthe Sauks. There was the appearance of a hundred or more horses having\npassed by this trail. Hoo-wau-ne-kah had been dispatched at once to\ntell their Father, and to ask his advice.",
        "After listening to all he had to communicate, his Father told him the\ntrail was undoubtedly that of General Henry’s troops, who were said to\nhave come north, looking for the enemy; that as the marks of the horses’\nhoofs showed them, by this report, to have been shod, that was\nsufficient proof that it was not the trail of the Sauks. He thought that\nthe people at the villages need not feel any uneasiness.",
        "“Very well, Father,” replied Hoo-wau-ne-kah; “I will go back and tell my\npeople what you say. They will believe you, for you always tell them the\ntruth. You are not like us Indians, who sometimes deceive each other.\"\nSo saying, he returned to his friends, much comforted.",
        "The completion of the picketing and other defences, together with the\narrival of a detachment of troops from Fort Howard under Lieutenant\nHunter, at our fort, now seemed to render the latter the place of\ngreatest safety. We therefore regularly, every evening immediately\nbefore dusk, took up our line of march for the opposite side of the\nriver, and repaired to quarters that had been assigned us within the\ngarrison, leaving our own house and chattels to the care of the\nFrenchmen and our friends the Winnebagoes.",
        "It was on one of these days that we were sitting at the windows which\nlooked out over the Portage–indeed, we seldom sat anywhere else, our\nalmost sole occupation being to look abroad and see what was coming\nnext–when a loud, long, shrill whoop from a distance gave notice of\nsomething to be heard. “The news-halloo! what could it portend? What\nwere we about to hear?” By gazing intently towards the farthest\nextremity of the road, we could perceive a moving body of horsemen,\nwhich, as they approached, we saw to be Indians. They were in full\ncostume. Scarlet streamers fluttered at the ends of their lances–their\narms glittered in the sun. Presently, as they drew nearer, their paint\nand feathers and brooches became visible. There were fifty or more\nwarriors. They passed the road which turns to the Fort, and rode\ndirectly up the hill leading to the Agency. Shaw-nee-aw-kee was absent.\nThe Interpreter had been sent for on the first distant appearance of the\nstrangers, but had not yet arrived. The party, having ascended the hill,\nhalted near the blacksmith’s shop, but did not dismount.",
        "Our hearts trembled–it must surely be the enemy. At this moment my\nhusband appeared from the direction of the Interpreter’s house. We\ncalled to entreat him to stop, but he walked along towards the\nnew-comers.",
        "To our infinite joy, we saw the chief of the party dismount, and all the\nothers following his example and approaching to shake hands.",
        "A space was soon cleared around the leader and my husband, when the\nformer commenced an oration, flourishing his sword and using much\nviolent gesticulation. It was the first time I had seen an Indian armed\nwith that weapon, and I dreaded to perceive it in such hands. Sometimes\nhe appeared as if he were about to take off the head of his auditor at a\nblow; and our hearts sank as we remembered the stratagems at Mackinac\nand Detroit in former days. At length the speech was concluded, another\nshaking of hands took place, and we saw my husband leading the way to\nhis storehouse, from which some of his men presently brought tobacco and\npipes and laid them at the feet of the chief.",
        "Our suspense was soon relieved by being informed that the strangers were\nMan-Eater, the principal chief of the Rock River Indians, who had come\nwith his band to “hold a talk” and bring information.",
        "These Indians were under the special care of Mr. Henry Gratiot, and his\nefforts had been most judicious and unremitting in preserving the good\nfeeling of this the most dangerous portion of the Winnebagoes.",
        "The intelligence that Man-Eater, who was a most noble Indian in\nappearance and character, brought us, confirmed that already received,\nnamely, that the Sauks were gradually drawing north, towards the\nPortage, although he evidently did not know exactly their whereabouts.",
        "There was, soon after they had taken leave, an arrival of another party\nof Winnebagoes, and these requested permission to dance for their\nFather.",
        "The compliment having been accepted, they assembled, as usual, on the\nesplanade in front of the house. My sister, the children, and myself\nstationed ourselves at the open windows, according to custom, and my\nhusband sat on the broad step before the door, which opened from the\nouter air directly into the parlor where we were.",
        "The performance commenced, and as the dancers proceeded, following each\nother round and round in the progress of the dance, my sister, Mrs.\nHelm, remarked to me, “Look at that small, dark Indian, with the green\nboughs on his person–that is a Sauk! They always mark themselves in\nthis manner with white clay, and ornament themselves with leaves when\nthey dance!” In truth, I had never seen this costume among our own\nIndians, and as I gazed at this one with green chaplets round his head\nand his legs, and even his gun wreathed in the same manner, while his\nbody displayed no paint except the white transverse streaks with which\nit was covered, I saw that he was, indeed, a stranger. Without owing\nanything to the exaggeration of fear, his countenance was truly\nferocious.",
        "He held his gun in his hand, and every time the course of the dance\nbrought him directly in front of where we sat, he would turn his gaze\nfull upon us, and club his weapon before him with what we interpreted\ninto an air of defiance. We sat as still as death, for we knew it would\nnot be wise to exhibit any appearance of fear; but my sister remarked,\nin a low tone, “I have always thought that I was to lose my life by the\nhands of the Indians. This is the third Indian war I have gone through,\nand now, I suppose, it will be the last.”",
        "It was the only time I ever saw her lose her self-possession. She was\nalways remarkably calm and resolute, but now I could see that she\ntrembled. Still we sat there–there was a sort of fascination as our\nimaginations became more and more excited. Presently some rain-drops\nbegan to fall. The Indians continued their dance for a few minutes\nlonger, then, with whoopings and shoutings, they rushed simultaneously\ntowards the house. We fled into my apartment and closed the door, which\nmy sister at first held fast, but she presently came and seated herself\nby me on the bed, for she saw that I could not compose myself. Of all\nforms of death, that by the hands of savages is the most difficult to\nface calmly; and I fully believed that our hour was come.",
        "There was no interruption to the dance, which the Indians carried on in\nthe parlor, leaping and yelling as if they would bring down the roof\nover our heads. In vain we tried to persuade my husband and the\nchildren, through a crevice of the door, to come and join us. The\nlatter, feeling no danger, were too much delighted with the exhibition\nto leave it, and the former only came for a moment to reassure me, and\nthen judged it wisest to return, and manifest his satisfaction at the\ncompliment by his presence. He made light of our fears, and would not\nadmit that the object of our suspicions was in fact a Sauk, but only\nsome young Winnebago, who had, as is sometimes the custom, imitated them\nin costume and appearance.",
        "It may have been “good fun” to him to return to his village and tell how\nhe frightened “the white squaws.” Such a trick would not be unnatural in\na white youth, and perhaps, since human nature is everywhere the same,\nit might not be out of the way in an Indian.",
        "The danger had now become so imminent that my husband determined to send\nhis family to Fort Howard, a point which was believed to be far out of\nthe range of the enemy. It was in vain that I pleaded to be permitted to\nremain; he was firm.",
        "“I must not leave my post,” said he, “while there is any danger. My\ndeparture would perhaps be the signal for an immediate alliance of the\nWinnebagoes with the Sauks. I am certain that as long as I am here my\npresence will act as a restraint upon them. You wish to remain and share\nmy dangers! Your doing so would expose us both to certain destruction in\ncase of attack By the aid of my friends in both tribes, I could hope to\npreserve my own life if I were alone; but surrounded by my family, that\nwould be impossible–we should all fall victims together. My duty\nplainly is, to send you to a place of safety.”",
        "An opportunity for doing this soon occurred. Paquette, the Interpreter,\nwho was likewise an agent of the American Fur Company, had occasion to\nsend a boat-load of furs to Green Bay, on their way to Mackinac. Mr.\nKinzie, having seen it as comfortably fitted up as an open boat of that\ndescription could be, with a tent-cloth fastened on a frame-work of\nhoop-poles over the centre and lined with a dark-green blanket, and\nhaving placed on board an abundant store of provisions and other\ncomforts, committed us to the joint care of my brother Arthur and our\nfaithful blacksmith, Mâtâ.",
        "This latter was a tall, gaunt Frenchman, with a freckled face, a\nprofusion of crisp, sandy hair, and an inveterate propensity to speak\nEnglish. His knowledge of the language was somewhat limited, and he\nburlesqued it by adding an s to almost every word, and giving out each\nphrase with a jerk.",
        "“Davids,” he was wont to say to the little yellow fiddler, after an\nevening’s frolic at the Interpreter’s, “Davids, clear away the tables\nand the glasses, and play fishes-hornspikes.”[55] He was a kind,\naffectionate creature, and his devotion to “Monsieur Johns” and “Madame\nJohns” knew no bounds.",
        "Besides these two protectors, three trusty Indians, the chief of whom\nwas called Old Smoker, were engaged to escort our party. The crew of\nthe boat consisted entirely of French engagés in the service of the Fur\nCompany. They were six gay-hearted, merry fellows, lightening their\nlabor with their pipe and their songs, in which latter they would have\nesteemed it a great compliment to be joined by the ladies who listened\nto them; but our hearts, alas! were now too heavy to participate in\ntheir enjoyment.",
        "The Fourth of July, the day on which we left our home, was a gloomy one\nindeed to those who departed and to the one left behind. Who knew if we\nshould ever meet again? The experience which some of the circle had had\nin Indian warfare was such as to justify the saddest forebodings. There\nwas not even the consolation of a certainty that this step would secure\nour safety. The Sauks might, possibly, be on the other side of us, and\nthe route we were taking might perhaps, though not probably, carry us\ninto their very midst. It was no wonder, then, that our leave-taking was\na solemn one–a parting which all felt might be for this world.",
        "Not all, however; for the gay, cheerful Frenchmen laughed and sang and\ncracked their jokes, and “assured Monsieur John that they would take\nMadame John and Madame Alum safe to the bay, spite of Sauks or wind or\nweather.”",
        "Thus we set out on our journey. For many miles the Fort was in sight, as\nthe course of the river alternately approached and receded from its\nwalls, and it was not until nearly mid-day that we caught the last\nglimpse of our home.",
        "At the noon-tide meal, or pipe, of the voyageurs, an alarming discovery\nwas made: no bread had been put on board for the crew! How this\noversight had occurred, no one could tell. One was certain that a large\nquantity had been brought from the garrison-bakery for their use that\nvery morning–another had even seen the sacks of loaves standing in\nPaquette’s kitchen. Be that as it may, there we were, many miles on our\njourney, and with no provisions for the six Frenchmen, except some\nsalted pork, a few beans, and some onions. A consultation was held in\nthis emergency. Should they return to the Portage for supplies? The\nsame danger that made their departure necessary, still existed, and the\nutmost dispatch had been enjoined upon them. We found upon examination\nthat the store of bread and crackers with which our party had been\nprovided was far-beyond what we could possibly require, and we thought\nit would be sufficient to allow of rations to the Frenchmen until we\nshould reach Powell’s, at the Butte des Morts, the day but one\nfollowing, where we should undoubtedly be able to procure a fresh\nsupply.",
        "This decided on, we proceeded on our journey, always in profound\nsilence, for a song or a loud laugh was now strictly prohibited until we\nshould have passed the utmost limits of country where the enemy might\npossibly be. We had been warned beforehand that a certain point, where\nthe low marshy meadows, through which the river had hitherto run, rises\ninto a more firm and elevated country, was the border of the Menomonee\nterritory, and the spot where the Sauks, if they had fled north of the\nWisconsin towards the Chippewa country, would be most likely to be\nencountered.",
        "As we received intimation on the forenoon of the second day that we were\ndrawing near this spot, I must confess that “we held our breath for\nawe.”",
        "The three Winnebagoes were in the bow of the boat. Old Smoker, the\nchief, squatted upon his feet on the bench of the foremost rowers. We\nlooked at him. He was gazing intently in the direction of the wooded\npoint we were approaching. Our eyes followed his, and we saw three\nIndians step forward and stand upon the bank. We said in a low voice to\neach other, “If they are Sauks, we are lost, for the whole body must be\nin that thicket.” The boat continued to approach; not a word was spoken;\nthe dip of the paddle, and perhaps the beating hearts of some, were the\nonly sounds that broke the stillness. Again we looked at the chief. His\nnostrils were dilated–his eyes almost glaring.",
        "Suddenly, with a bound, he sprang to his feet and uttered his long,\nshrill whoop.",
        "“Hoh! hoh! hoh! Neechee (friend) Muh-no-mo-nee!“",
        "All was now joy and gladness. Every one was forward to shake hands with\nthe strangers as soon as we could reach them, in token of our\nsatisfaction that they were Menomonees and not Sauks, of the latter of\nwhom, by the way, they could give us no intelligence.",
        "By noon of that day we considered ourselves to be out of the region of\ndanger. Still, caution was deemed necessary, and when at the mid-day\npipe the boat was pushed ashore under a beautiful overhanging bank,\ncrowned with a thick wood, the usual vigilance was somewhat relaxed, and\nthe young people, under the escort of Arthur and Mâtâ, were permitted to\nroam about a little, in the vicinity of the boat.",
        "They soon came back, with the report that the woods were “alive with\npigeons,\"–they could almost knock them down with sticks; and earnestly\ndid they plead to be allowed to shoot at least enough for supper. But\nno–the enemy might be nearer than we imagined–the firing of a gun\nwould betray our whereabouts–it was most prudent to give no notice to\nfriend or foe. So, very reluctantly, they were compelled to return to\nthe boat without their game.",
        "The next morning brought us to Powell’s, at the Butte des Morts. Sad\nwere the faces of the poor Frenchmen at learning that not a loaf of\nbread was to be had. Our own store, too, was by this time quite\nexhausted. The only substitute we could obtain was a bag of dark\nlooking, bitter flour. With this provision for our whole party, we were\nforced to be contented, and we left the Hillock of the Dead, feeling\nthat it had been indeed the grave of our hopes.",
        "By dint of good rowing, our crew soon brought us to the spot where the\nriver enters that beautiful sheet of water, Winnebago Lake. Though there\nwas but little wind when we reached the lake, the Frenchmen hoisted\ntheir sail, in hopes to save themselves the labor of rowing across; but\nin vain did they whistle, with all the force of their lungs–in vain did\nthey supplicate La Vierge, with a comical mixture of fun and\nreverence. As a last resource, it was at length suggested by some one\nthat their only chance lay in propitiating the goddess of the winds with\nan offering of some cast-off garment.",
        "Application was made all round by Guardapié, the chief spokesman of the\ncrew. Alas! not one of the poor voyageurs could boast a spare article. A\nfew old rags were at length rummaged out of the little receptacle of\nfood, clothing, and dirt in the bow of the boat, and cast into the waves\nFor a moment all flattered themselves that the experiment had been\nsuccessful–the sail fluttered, swelled a little, and then flapped idly\ndown against the mast. The party were in despair, until, after a\nwhispered consultation together, Julian and Edwin stepped forward as\nmessengers of mercy. In a trice they divested themselves of jacket and\nvest and made a proffer of their next garment to aid in raising the\nwind.",
        "At first there seemed a doubt in the minds of the boatmen whether they\nought to accept so magnificent an offer; but finding, on giving them a\npreparatory shake, that the value of the contribution was less than they\nhad imagined, they, with many shouts and much laughter, consigned them\nto the waves. To the great delight and astonishment of the boys, a\nbreeze at this moment sprang up, which carried the little vessel\nbeautifully over the waters for about half the distance to Garlic\nIsland. By this time the charm was exhausted, nor was it found possible\nto renew it by a repetition of similar offerings. All expedients were\ntried without success, and, with sundry rather disrespectful reflections\nupon the lady whose aid they had invoked, the Frenchmen were compelled\nto betake themselves to their oars, until they reached the island.",
        "Two or three canoes of Winnebagoes arrived at the same moment, and their\nowners immediately stepped forward with an offering of some sturgeon\nwhich they had caught in the lake. As this promised to be an agreeable\nvariety to the noon-tide meal (at least for the Frenchmen), it was\ndecided to stop and kindle a fire for the purpose of cooking it. We took\nadvantage of this interval to recommend to the boys a stroll to the\nopposite side of the island, where the clear, shallow water and pebbly\nbeach offered temptation to a refreshing bath. While they availed\nthemselves of this, under the supervision of Harry, the black boy, we\namused ourselves with gathering the fine red raspberries with which the\nisland abounded.",
        "Our enjoyment was cut short, however, by discovering that the whole\nplace, vines, shrubs, and even, apparently, the earth itself, was\ninfested with myriads of the wood-tick, a little insect, that, having\nfastened to the skin, penetrates into the very flesh, causing a swelling\nand irritation exceeding painful, and even dangerous. The alarm was\nsounded, to bring the boys back in all haste to the open and more\nfrequented part of the island. But we soon found we had not left our\ntormentors behind. Throughout the day we continued to be sensible of\ntheir proximity. From the effects of their attacks we were not relieved\nfor several succeeding days; those which had succeeded in burying\nthemselves in the flesh having to be removed with the point of a\npenknife or a large needle. After partaking of our dinner, we stepped on\nboard our boat, and, the wind having risen, we were carried by the\nbreeze to the farther verge of the lake, and into the entrance of the\nriver, or, as it was called, the Winnebago Rapids.",
        "On the point of land to the right stood a collection of neat bark\nwigwams–this was Four-Legs’ village.",
        "It was an exciting and somewhat hazardous passage down the rapids and\nover the Grand Chûte, a fall of several feet; but it was safely passed,\nand at the approach of evening the boat reached the settlement of the\nWaubanakees at the head of the Little Chûte. These are the Stockbridge\nor Brothertown Indians, the remains of the old Mohicans, who had, a few\nyears before, emigrated from Oneida County, in the State of New York, to\na tract granted them by the United States, on the fertile banks of the\nFox River. They had already cleared extensive openings in the forest,\nand built some substantial and comfortable houses near the banks of the\nriver, which were here quite high, and covered for the most part with\ngigantic trees.",
        "It was determined to ask hospitality of these people, to the extent of\nborrowing a corner of their fire to boil our tea-kettle, and bake the\nshort-cake which had been now, for nearly two days, our substitute for\nbread. Its manufacture had been a subject of much merriment. The\ningredients, consisting of Powell’s black flour, some salt, and a little\nbutter, were mixed in the tin box which had held our meat. This was then\nreversed, and, having been properly cleansed, supplied the place of a\ndough-board. The vinegar-bottle served the office of rolling-pin, and a\nshallow tin dish formed the appliance for baking. The Waubanakees were\nso good as to lend us an iron bake-kettle, and superintend the cooking\nof our cake after Harry had carried it up to their dwelling.",
        "So kind and hospitable did they show themselves, that the crew of the\nboat took the resolution of asking a lodging on shore, by way of relief\nafter their crowded quarters in the boat for the last three nights.\nArthur and Mâtâ soon adopted the same idea, and we were invited to\nfollow their example, with the assurance that the houses were extremely\nneat and orderly.",
        "We preferred, however, as it was a fine night, and all things were so\ncomfortably arranged in the boat, to remain on board, keeping Edwin and\nJosette with us.",
        "The boat was tightly moored, for the little Chûte was just below, and if\nour craft should break loose in the rapid current, and drift down over\nthe falls, it would be a very serious matter. As an additional\nprecaution, one man was left on board to keep all things safe and in\norder, and, these arrangements having been made, the others ascended the\nbank, and took up their night’s lodgings in the Waubanakee cabins.",
        "It was a beautiful, calm, moonlight night, the air just sufficiently\nwarm to be agreeable, while the gentle murmur of the rapids and of the\nfall, at no great distance, soon lulled our party to repose. How long we\nhad slumbered we knew not, when we were aroused by a rushing wind. It\nbent the poles supporting the awning, snapped them, and, another gust\nsucceeding, tent and blanket were carried away on the blast down the\nstream. The moonlight was gone, but a flash of lightning showed them\nsailing away like a spectre in the distance.",
        "The storm increased in violence. The rain began to pour in torrents, and\nthe thunder and lightning to succeed each other in fearful rapidity. My\nsister sprang to waken the Frenchman. “Get up, Vitelle, quick,” cried\nshe, in French, “run up the bank for Mâtâ and Mr. Arthur–tell them to\ncome and get us instantly.”",
        "The man made her no reply, but fell upon his knees, invoking the Virgin\nmost vociferously.",
        "“Do not wait for the Virgin, but go as quickly as possible. Do you not\nsee we shall all be killed?”",
        "“Oh! not for the world, madame, not for the world,” said Vitelle,\nburying his head in a pack of furs, “would I go up that bank in this\nstorm.” And here he began crying most lustily to all the saints in the\ncalendar.",
        "It Was indeed awful. The roaring of the thunder and the flashing of the\nlightning around us were like the continued discharge of a park of\nartillery. I with some difficulty drew forth my cloak, and enveloped\nmyself and Josette–sister Margaret did the same with Edwin.",
        "“Oh I madame,” said the poor little girl, her teeth chattering with cold\nand fright, “won’t we be drowned?”",
        "“Very well,” said my sister to the Frenchman, “you see that Madame John\nis at the last agony–if you will not go for help I must, and Monsieur\nJohn must know that you left his wife to perish.”",
        "This was too much for Vitelle. “If I must, I must,” said he, and with a\ndesperate bound he leaped on shore and sped up the hill with might and\nmain.",
        "In a few minutes, though it seemed ages to us, a whole posse came flying\ndown the hill. The incessant lightning made all things appear as in the\nglare of day. Mâtâ’s curly hair fairly stood on end, and his eyes rolled\nwith ghastly astonishment at the spectacle.",
        "“Oh, my God, Madame Johns! what would Monsieur Johns say, to see you\nnows?” exclaimed he, as he seized me in his arms and bore me up the\nhill. Arthur followed with sister Margaret, and two others with Edwin\nand Josette. Nobody carried Vitelle, for he had taken care not to risk\nhis precious life by venturing again to the boat.",
        "On arriving at the cabin where Arthur and Mâtâ had been lodged, a fire\nwas, with some difficulty, kindled, and our trunks having been brought\nup from the boat, we were at length able to exchange our drenched\ngarments, and those of the children, for others more comfortable, after\nwhich we laid ourselves upon the clean but homely bed, and slept until\ndaylight.",
        "As it was necessary to ascertain what degree of damage the cargo of furs\nhad sustained, an early start was proposed. Apparently, the inhabitants\nof the cottages had become weary in well-doing, for they declined\npreparing breakfast for us, although we assured them they should be well\ncompensated for their trouble. We, consequently, saw ourselves compelled\nto depart with very slender prospects of a morning meal.",
        "When we reached the boat, what a scene presented itself! Bedclothes,\ncloaks, trunks, mess-basket, packs of furs, all bearing the marks of a\ncomplete deluge! The boat ankle-deep in water–literally no place on\nboard where we could either stand or sit. After some bailing out, and an\nattempt at disposing some of the packs of furs which had suffered least\nfrom the flood, so as to form a sort of divan in the centre of the boat,\nnothing better seemed to offer than to re-embark, and endure what could\nnot be cured.",
        "Our position was not an enviable one. Wherever a foot or hand was\nplaced, the water gushed up, with a bubbling sound, and, oh! the state\nof the bandboxes and work-baskets! Breakfast there was none, for on\nexamining the mess-basket everything it contained was found mingled in\none undistinguishable mass. Tea, pepper, salt, short-cake, all floating\ntogether–it was a hopeless case.",
        "But this was not the worst. As the fervid July sun rose higher in the\nheavens, the steam which exhaled from every object on board was nearly\nsuffocating. The boat was old–the packs of skins were old–their\nvicinity in a dry day had been anything but agreeable–now it was\nintolerable. There was no retreating from it, however; so we encouraged\nthe children to arm themselves with patience, for the short time that\nyet remained of our voyage.",
        "Seated on our odoriferous couch, beneath the shade of a single umbrella,\nto protect our whole party from the scorching sun, we glided wearily\ndown the stream, through that long, tedious day. As we passed\nsuccessively the Kakalin, the Rapids, Dickenson’s, the Agency, with what\nlonging eyes did we gaze at human habitations, where others were\nenjoying the shelter of a roof and the comforts of food–and how eagerly\ndid we count the hours which must elapse before we could reach Port\nHoward!",
        "There were no songs from the poor Frenchmen this day. Music and fasting\ndo not go well together. At length we stopped at Shanty-town, where the\nboat was to be unloaded. All hands fell to work to transfer the cargo to\nthe warehouse of the Fur Company, which stood near the landing. It was\nnot a long operation, for all worked heartily. This being accomplished,\nthe voyageurs, one and all, prepared to take their leave. In vain Mâtâ\nstormed and raved–in vain Arthur remonstrated.",
        "“No,” they said, “they had brought the boat and cargo to the\nwarehouse–that was all of their job.” And they turned to go.",
        "“Guardapié,” said I, “do you intend to leave us here?”",
        "“Bien, madame! it is the place we always stop at.”",
        "“Does Monsieur John pay you for bringing his family down?”",
        "“Oh, yes, Monsieur John has given us an order on the sutler, at the\nFort down below.”",
        "“To be paid when you deliver us safe at the Fort down below. It seems I\nshall be there before you, and I shall arrange that matter. Monsieur\nJohn never dreamed that this would be your conduct.”",
        "The Frenchmen consulted together, and the result was that Guardapié with\ntwo others jumped into the boat, took their oars, and rather sulkily\nrowed us the remaining two miles to Fort Howard.",
        "We soon learned that a great panic prevailed at Green Bay on account of\nthe Sauks. The people seemed to have possessed themselves with the idea\nthat the enemy would visit this place on their way to Canada to put\nthemselves under the protection of the British Government. How they were\nto get there from this point–whether they were to stop and fabricate\nthemselves bark canoes for the purpose, or whether they were to charter\none of Mr. Newbery’s schooners for the trip, the good people did not\nseem fully to have made up their minds. One thing is certain, a portion\nof the citizens were nearly frightened to death, and were fully\nconvinced that there was no safety for them but within the walls of the\nold dilapidated fort, from which nearly all the troops had been\nwithdrawn and sent to Fort Winnebago some time previous.",
        "Their fears were greatly aggravated by a report, brought by some\ntraveller, that he had slept at night on the very spot where the Sauks\nbreakfasted the next morning. Now, as the Sauks were known to be reduced\nto very short commons, there was every reason to suppose that if the man\nhad waited half an hour longer they would have eaten him; so he was\nconsidered to have made a wonderful escape.",
        "Our immediate friends and acquaintances were far from joining in these\nfears. The utter improbability of such a movement was obvious to all who\nconsidered the nature of the country to be traversed, and the efficient\nand numerous body of whites by whom they must be opposed on their\nentrance into that neighborhood. There were some, however, who could not\nbe persuaded that there was any security but in flight, and eagerly was\nthe arrival of the “Mariner” looked for, as the anxiety grew more and\nmore intense.",
        "The “Mariner” appeared at last. It was early in the morning. In one hour\nfrom the time of her arrival the fearful news she brought had spread the\nwhole length of the settlement–\"the cholera was in this country! It was\nin Detroit–it was among the troops who were on their way to the seat of\nwar! Whole companies had died of it in the river St. Clair, and the\nsurvivors had been put on shore at Port Gratiot, to save their lives as\nbest they might!” We were shut in between the savage foe on one hand and\nthe pestilence on the other!",
        "To those who had friends at the East the news was most appalling. It\nseemed to unman every one who heard it. An officer who had exhibited the\nmost distinguished prowess in the battle-field, and also in some private\nenterprises demanding unequalled courage and daring, was the first to\nbring us the news. When he had communicated it, he laid his head\nagainst the window-sill and wept like a child.",
        "Those who must perforce rejoin friends near and dear, left the Bay in\nthe “Mariner;” all others considered their present home the safest; and\nso it proved, for the dreadful scourge did not visit Green Bay that\nseason.",
        "The weather was intensely hot, and the mosquitoes so thick that we did\nnot pretend to walk on the parade after sunset, unless armed with two\nfans, or green branches to keep constantly in motion, in order to\ndisperse them. This, by the way, was the surest method of attracting\nthem. We had somehow forgotten the apathetic indifference which had\noften excited our wonder in Old Smoker, as we had observed him calmly\nsitting and allowing his naked arms and person to become literally\ngray with the tormenting insects. Then he would quietly wipe off a\nhandful, the blood following the movement of the hand over his skin, and\nstoically wait for an occasion to repeat the movement. It is said that\nthe mosquito, if undisturbed until he has taken his fill, leaves a much\nless inflamed bite than if brushed away in the midst of his feast.",
        "By day, the air was at this season filled with what is called the Green\nBay fly, a species of dragon-fly, with which the outer walls of the\nhouses are at times so covered that their color is hardly\ndistinguishable. Their existence is very ephemeral, scarcely lasting\nmore than a day. Their dead bodies are seen adhering to the walls and\nwindows within, and they fall without in such numbers that after a high\nwind has gathered them into rows along the sides of the quarters, one\nmay walk through them and toss them up with their feet like the dry\nleaves in autumn.",
        "As we walked across the parade, our attention was sometimes called to a\ntapping upon the bars of the dungeon in which a criminal was\nconfined–it was the murderer of Lieutenant Foster.",
        "It may be remembered that this amiable young officer had been our\ntravelling companion in our journey from Chicago the preceding year.\nSome months after his arrival at Port Howard, he had occasion to order a\nsoldier of his company, named Doyle, into confinement for intoxication.\nThe man, a few days afterwards, prevailed on the sergeant of the guard\nto escort him to Lieutenant Foster’s quarters on the plea that he wished\nto speak to him. He ascended the stairs to the young officer’s room,\nwhile the sergeant and another soldier remained at the foot, near the\ndoor.",
        "Doyle entered, and, addressing Lieutenant Foster, said, “Will you please\ntell me, lieutenant, what I am confined for?”",
        "“No, sir,” replied the officer; “you know your offence well enough;\nreturn to your place of confinement.”",
        "The man ran down-stairs, wrenched the gun from the sergeant’s hand, and,\nrushing back, discharged it at the heart of Lieutenant Foster.",
        "He turned to go to his inner apartment, but exclaiming, “Ah me!” he fell\ndead before the entrance.",
        "Doyle, having been tried by a civil court, was now under sentence,\nawaiting his execution. He was a hardened villain, never exhibiting the\nslightest compunction for his crime.",
        "The commanding officer, Major Clark, sent to him one day to inquire if\nhe wanted anything for his comfort.",
        "“If the Major pleased,” he replied, “he should like to have a light and\na copy of Byron’s Works.”",
        "Some fears were entertained that he would contrive to make way with\nhimself before the day of execution, and, to guard against it, he was\ndeprived of everything that could furnish him a weapon. His food was\nserved to him in a wooden bowl, lest a bit of broken crockery might he\nused as a means of self destruction.",
        "One morning he sent a little package to the commanding officer as a\npresent. It contained a strong rope, fabricated from strips of his\nblanket, that he had carefully separated, and with a large stout spike\nat the end of it. The message accompanying it was, “He wished Major\nClark to see that if he chose to put an end to himself, he could find\nmeans to do it in spite of him.”",
        "And this hardened frame of mind continued to the last. When he was led\nout for execution, in passing beyond the gate, he observed a quantity of\nlumber recently collected for the construction of a new Company’s\nwarehouse.",
        "“Ah, captain, what are you going to build here?” inquired he of Captain\nScott, who attended him.",
        "“Doyle,” replied his captain, “you have but a few moments to live–- you\nhad better employ your thoughts about something else.”",
        "“It is for that very reason, captain,” said he, “that I am inquiring–as\nmy time is short, I wish to gain all the information I can while it\nlasts.”",
        "We were not suffered to remain long in suspense in regard to the friends\nwe had left behind. In less than two weeks Old Smoker again made his\nappearance. He was the bearer of letters from my husband, informing me\nthat General Dodge was then with him at Port Winnebago, that Generals\nHenry and Alexander were likewise at the Fort, and that as soon as they\nhad recruited their men and horses, which were pretty well worn out with\nscouring the country after Black Hawk, they would march again in pursuit\nof him towards the head-waters of the Rock River, where they had every\nreason, from information lately brought in by the Winnebagoes, to\nbelieve he would be found.",
        "As he charged us to lay aside all uneasiness on his account, and\nmoreover held forth the hope of soon coming or sending for us, our minds\nbecame more tranquil.",
        "Not long after this, I was told one morning that ’a lady” wished to\nsee me at the front door. I obeyed the summons, and, to my surprise, was\ngreeted by my friend Madame Four-Legs. After much demonstration of joy\nat seeing me, such as putting her two hands together over her forehead\nand then parting them in a waving kind of gesture, laughing, and patting\nme on my arms, she drew from her bosom a letter from my husband, of\nwhich she was the bearer. It was to this effect–\"Generals Dodge and\nHenry left here a few days since, accompanied by Paquette; they met the\nSauks near the Wisconsin, on the 21st. A battle ensued, in which upwards\nof fifty of the enemy were killed–our loss was one killed, and eight\nwounded. The citizens are well pleased that all this has been\naccomplished without any aid from Old White Beaver.[56] The war must\nbe near its close, for the militia and regulars together will soon\nfinish the remaining handful of fugitives.”",
        "The arrival of Lieutenant Hunter, who had obtained leave of absence in\norder to escort us, soon put all things in train for our return to Fort\nWinnebago. No Mackinac boat was to be had, but in lieu of it a Durham\nboat was procured. This is of a description longer and shallower than\nthe other, with no convenience for rigging up an awning, or shelter of\nany kind, over the centre; but its size was better fitted to accommodate\nour party, which consisted, besides our own family, of Lieutenant and\nMrs. Hunter, the wife of another officer now stationed at Port\nWinnebago, and our cousin, Miss Forsyth. We made up our minds, as will\nbe supposed, to pretty close quarters.",
        "Our crew was composed partly of Frenchmen and partly of soldiers, and,\nall things being in readiness, we set off one fine bright morning in the\nlatter part of July.",
        "Our second day’s alternate rowing and poling brought us to the Grande\nChûte early in the afternoon.",
        "Here, it is the custom to disembark at the foot of the rapids, and,\nascending the high bank, walk around the fall, while the men pull the\nboat up through the foaming waters.",
        "Most of our party had already stepped on shore, when a sudden thought\nseized one of the ladies and myself.",
        "“Let us stay in the boat,” said we, “and be pulled up the Chûte.” The\nrest of the company went on, while we sat and watched with great\ninterest the preparations the men were making. They were soon overboard\nin the water, and, attaching a strong rope to the bow of the boat, all\nlent their aid in pulling as they marched slowly along with their heavy\nload. The cargo, consisting only of our trunks and stores, which were of\nno very considerable weight, had not been removed.",
        "We went on, now and then getting a tremendous bump against a hidden\nrock, and frequently splashed by a shower of foam as the waves roared\nand boiled around us.",
        "The men kept as close as possible to the high, precipitous bank, where\nthe water was smoothest. At the head of the cordel was a merry\nsimpleton of a Frenchman, who was constantly turning his head to grin\nwith delight at our evident enjoyment and excitement.",
        "We were indeed in high glee. “Is not this charming?” cried one. “I only\nwish––”",
        "The wish, whatever it was, was cut short by a shout and a crash. “Have\na care, Robineau! Mind where you are taking the boat!” was the cry, but\nit came too late. More occupied with the ladies than with his duty, the\nleader had guided us into the midst of a sharp, projecting tree that\nhung from the bank. The first tug ripped out the side of the boat, which\nimmediately began to fill with water.",
        "My companion and I jumped upon the nearest rocks that showed their heads\nabove the foam. Our screams and the shouts of the men brought Lieutenant\nHunter and some Indians, who were above on the bank, dashing down to our\nrescue. They carried us in their arms to land, while the men worked\nlustily at fishing up the contents of the boat, now thoroughly saturated\nwith water.",
        "We scrambled up the high bank, in a miserable plight, to join in the\ngeneral lamentation over the probable consequences of the accident.",
        "“Oh! my husband’s new uniform!” cried one, and “Oh! the miniatures in\nthe bottom of my trunk!” sighed another–while, “Oh! the silk dresses,\nand the ribbons, and the finery!” formed the general chorus.",
        "No one thought of the provisions, although we had observed, in our\nprogress to shore, the barrel of bread and the tub of ice, which\nLieutenant Hunter had providently brought for our refreshment, sailing\naway on the dancing waves. Among the boxes brought to land, and “toted\"\nup the steep bank, was one containing some loaves of sugar and packages\nof tea, which I had bought for our winter’s supply from the sutler at\nthe post. The young Indian who was the bearer of it set it upon the\nground, and soon called my attention to a thick, white stream that was\noozing from the corners. I made signs for him to taste it. He dipped his\nfinger in it, and exclaimed with delight to his companions, when he\nperceived what it was. I then pointed to his hatchet, and motioned him\nto open the box. He did not require a second invitation–it was soon\nbacked to pieces.",
        "Then, as I beckoned up all the rest of the youngsters who were looking\non, full of wonder, such a scrambling and shouting with delight\nsucceeded as put us all, particularly the boys, into fits of laughter.\nBowls, dippers, hands, everything that could contain even the smallest\nquantity, were put in requisition. The squaws were most active. Those\nwho could do no better took the stoutest fragments of the blue paper in\nwhich the sugar had been enveloped, and in a trice nothing remained but\nthe wet, yellow bundles of tea, and the fragments of the splintered box\nwhich had contained it.",
        "By this time fires had been made, and the articles from the trunks were\nsoon seen covering every shrub and bush in the vicinity. Fortunately,\nthe box containing the new uniform had been piled high above the others,\nin the centre of the boat, and had received but little damage; but sad\nwas the condition of the wardrobes in general.",
        "Not a white article was to be seen. All was mottled; blue, green, red,\nand black intermingling in streaks, and dripping from ends and corners.",
        "To add to the trouble, the rain began to fall, as rain is apt to do, at\nan inconvenient moment, and soon the half-dried garments had to be\ngathered out of the smoke and huddled away in a most discouraging\ncondition.",
        "The tent was pitched, wet as it was, and the blankets, wrung out of the\nwater, and partially dried, were spread upon the ground for our\naccommodation at night.",
        "A Hamburg cheese, which had been a part of my stores, was voted to me\nfor a pillow, and, after a supper the best part of which was a portion\nof one of the wet loaves which had remained in a barrel too tightly\nwedged to drift away, we betook ourselves to our repose.",
        "The next morning rose hot and sultry. The mosquitoes, which the rain\nhad kept at bay through the night, now began to make themselves amends,\nand to torment us unmercifully.",
        "After our most uncomfortable and unpalatable breakfast, the first\nquestion for consideration was, what we were to do with ourselves. Our\nboat lay submerged at the foot of the hill, half-way up the rapids. The\nnearest habitation among the Waubanakees was some miles distant, and\nthis there was no means of reaching but by an Indian canoe, if some of\nour present friends and neighbors would be so obliging as to bring one\nfor our use. Even then it was doubtful if boats could be found\nsufficient to convey all our numerous party back to Green Bay.",
        "In the midst of these perplexing consultations a whoop was heard from\nbeyond the hill, which here sloped away to the north, at the head of the\nrapids.",
        "“There is John! that is certainly his voice!” cried more than one of the\ncompany.",
        "It was, indeed, my husband, and in a moment he was among us. Never was\narrival more opportune, more evidently providential.",
        "Not having learned our plans (for the unsettled state of the country had\nprevented our sending him word), he had come provided with a boat, to\ntake us back to Fort Winnebago.",
        "Our drying operations, which we had recommenced this morning, were soon\ncut short. Everything was shuffled away in the most expeditious manner\npossible, and in an incredibly short time we were transferred to the\nother boat, which lay quietly above the Chûte, and were pulling away\ntowards Winnebago Lake.",
        "We had resolved to go only so far as the vicinity of the lake, where the\nbreeze would render the mosquitoes less intolerable, and then to stop\nand make one more attempt at drying our clothing. Accordingly, when we\nreached a beautiful high bank near the Little Butte, we stopped for that\npurpose again, unpacked our trunks, and soon every bush and twig was\nfluttering with the spoils of the cruel waves.",
        "Hardly had we thus disposed of the last rag or ribbon when the tramp of\nhorses was heard, followed by loud shouts and cheers ringing through the\nforest.",
        "A company of about twenty-five horsemen, with banners flying, veils\nfluttering from their hats, and arms glittering in the sun, rode into\nour midst, and, amid greetings and roars of laughter, inquired into the\nnature and reasons of our singular state of confusion.",
        "They were Colonel Stambough and Alexander Irwin, of Green Bay, with a\ncompany of young volunteers, and followed by a whooping band of\nMenomonees, all bound for the seat of war. We comforted them with the\nassurance that the victories were by this time all won and the scalps\ntaken; but, expressing the hope that there were yet a few laurels to be\nearned, they bade us adieu, and rapidly pursued their march.",
        "We crossed Lake Winnebago by the clear, beautiful light of a summer\nmoon. The soft air was just enough to swell the sail, and thus save the\nmen their labor at the oar.",
        "The witchery of the hour was not, however, sufficient to induce us to\nforego our repose after the heat and annoyances of the day–we therefore\ndisposed ourselves betimes, to be packed away in the centre of the boat.\nHow it was accomplished no one of the numerous company could tell. If\nany accident had occurred to disturb our arrangement, I am sure it would\nhave been a Chinese puzzle to put us back again in our places. The men\non the outside had much the best of it, and we rather envied those who\nwere off watch, their ability to snore and change position as the humor\ntook them.",
        "We reached Powell’s just in time to have gone ashore and prepare our\nbreakfast had we had wherewithal to prepare it. We had hoped to be able\nto procure some supplies here, for hitherto we had been living on the\nremains of my husband’s ample stock. That was now so nearly exhausted\nthat when we found the mess-basket could not be replenished at this\nplace we began to talk of putting ourselves on allowance.",
        "The wet bread, of which there had remained an ample store, had, as may\nbe readily imagined, soon fermented under the influence of a July sun.\nThe tea, too, notwithstanding our careful efforts at drying it on\nnewspapers and pieces of board, ere long became musty and unfit for use.\nThere was, literally, nothing left, except the salted meat and a few\ncrackers, hardly sufficient for the present day.",
        "The men were therefore urged to make all the speed possible, that we\nmight reach Gleason’s, at Lake Puckaway, in good season on the following\nday.",
        "At evening, when we stopped to take our tea at a beautiful little\nopening among the trees, we found our old enemies, the mosquitoes, worse\nthan ever. It was necessary to put on our cloaks and gloves, and tie our\nveils close around our throats, only venturing to introduce a cracker or\na cup of tea under this protection in the most stealthy manner.",
        "The men rowed well, and brought us to Gleason’s about eleven o’clock the\nnext day. We were greeted with the most enthusiastic demonstrations by\nmy old friend La Grosse Américaine, who had removed here from\nBellefontaine.",
        "“Oh, Mrs. Armstrong,” cried we, “get us some breakfast–we are\nfamishing!”",
        "At that instant who should appear but our faithful Mâtâ, driving the old\ncalèche in which we were in the habit of making our little excursions in\nthe neighborhood of the Port. He had ridden over, hoping to meet us, in\nthe idea that some of us would prefer this method of reaching our home.",
        "With provident thoughtfulness, he had brought tea, roasted coffee, fresh\nbutter, eggs, etc., lest we should be short of such luxuries in that\nadvanced stage of our journey.",
        "His “Good-morning, Madame Johns! How do you dos?” was a pleasant and\nwelcome sound.",
        "We could not wait for our breakfast, but gathered round La Grosse\nAméricaine like a parcel of children while she cut and spread slices of\nbread-and-butter for us.",
        "After our regular meal was finished, it was decided that sister Margaret\nshould take Josette, and return with Mâtâ to open the house and make it\nready for our reception. It had been the head-quarters of militia,\nIndians, and stragglers of various descriptions during our absence, and\nwe could easily imagine that a little “misrule and unreason” might have\nhad sway for that period.",
        "We had yet seventy-two miles, by the devious winding course of the\nriver, over first the beautiful waters of Lac de Boeuf, and then through\nthe low, marshy lands that spread away to the Portage. An attempt was\nmade on the part of one of the gentlemen to create a little excitement\namong the ladies as we approached the spot where it had been supposed\nthe Sauks might pass on their way to the Chippewa country.",
        "“Who knows,” said he, gravely, “but they may be lurking in this\nneighborhood yet? If so, we shall probably have some signal. We must be\non the alert!”",
        "Some of the ladies began to turn pale and look about them. After an\ninterval of perfect silence, a low, prolonged whistle was heard. There\nwas so much agitation, and even actual terror, that the mischievous\nauthor of the trick was obliged to confess at once, and receive a hearty\nscolding for the pain he had caused.",
        "Just before sunset of the second day from Gleason’s we reached our home.\nEvery thing was radiant with neatness and good order. With the\nefficient aid of our good Manaigre and his wife, the house had been\nwhitewashed from the roof to the door-sill, a thorough scrubbing and\ncleansing effected, the carpets unpacked and spread upon the floors, the\nfurniture arranged, and, though last not least, a noble supper smoked\nupon the board by the time we had made, once more, a civilized toilet.",
        "Many of our friends from the Fort were there to greet us, and a more\nhappy or thankful party has seldom been assembled.",
        "The war was now considered at an end. The news of the battle of the Bad\nAxe, where the regulars, the militia, and the steamboat Warrior\ncombined, had made a final end of the remaining handful of Sauks, had\nreached us and restored tranquillity to the hearts and homes of the\nfrontier settlers.",
        "It may seem wonderful that an enemy so few in number and so\ninsignificant in resources could have created such a panic, and\nrequired so vast an amount of opposing force to subdue them. The\ndifficulty had been simply in never knowing where to find them, either\nto attack or guard against them. Probably at the outset every military\nman thought and felt like the noble old veteran General Brady. “Give me\ntwo infantry companies mounted,” said he, “and I will engage to whip the\nSauks out of the country in one week!”",
        "True, but to whip the enemy you must first meet him; and in order to\npursue effectually and catch the Indians, a peculiar training is\nnecessary–a training which, at that day, few, even of the frontier\nmilitia, could boast.",
        "In some portions of this campaign there was another difficulty,–the\nwant of concert between the two branches of the service. The regular\ntroops looked with contempt upon the unprofessional movements of the\nmilitia; the militia railed at the dilatory and useless formalities of\nthe regulars. Each avowed the conviction that matters could be much\nbetter conducted without the other, and the militia, being prompt to\nact, sometimes took matters into their own hands, and brought on defeat\nand disgrace, as in the affair of “Stillman’s Run.”",
        "The feeling of contempt which the army officers entertained for the\nmilitia, extended itself to their subordinates and dependants. After the\nvisit of the Ranger officers to Fort Winnebago, before the battle of the\nWisconsin, the officer of the mess where they had been entertained\ncalled up his servant one day to inquire into the sutler’s accounts, He\nwas the same little “Yellow David” who had formerly appertained to\nCaptain Harney.",
        "“David,” said the young gentleman, “I see three bottles of cologne-water\ncharged in the month’s account of the mess at the sutler’s. What does\nthat mean?”",
        "“If you please, lieutenant,” said David, respectfully, “it was to\nsweeten up the dining-room and quarters after them milish’ officers were\nhere visiting.”",
        "Black Hawk and a few of his warriors had escaped to the north, where\nthey were shortly after captured by the One-eyed Day-kau-ray and his\nparty, and brought prisoners to General Street at Prairie du Chien. The\nwomen and children of the band had been put in canoes and sent down the\nMississippi, in hopes of being permitted to cross and reach the rest of\nthat tribe.",
        "The canoes had been tied together, and many of them were upset, and the\nchildren drowned, their mothers being too weak and exhausted to rescue\nthem. The survivors were taken prisoners, and, starving and miserable,\nwere brought to Prairie du Chien. Our mother was at the Port at the time\nof their arrival. She described their condition as wretched and reduced\nbeyond anything she had ever witnessed. One woman who spoke a little\nChippewa gave her an account of the sufferings and hardships they had\nendured–it was truly appalling.",
        "After having eaten such of the horses as could be spared, they had\nsubsisted on acorns, elm-bark, or even grass. Many had died of\nstarvation, and their bodies were found lying in their trail by the\npursuing whites. This poor woman had lost her husband in battle, and all\nher children by the upsetting of the canoe in which they were, and her\nonly wish now was, to go and join them. Poor Indians! who can wonder\nthat they do not love the whites?",
        "But a very short time had we been quietly at home when a summons came to\nmy husband to collect the principal chiefs of the Winnebagoes and meet\nGeneral Scott and Governor Reynolds at Rock Island, where it was\nproposed to bold a treaty for the purchase of all the lands east and\nsouth of the Wisconsin. Messengers were accordingly sent to collect the\nprincipal men, and, accompanied by as many as chose to report\nthemselves, he set off on his journey.",
        "He had been gone about two weeks, and I was beginning to count the days\nwhich must elapse before I could reasonably expect his return, when, one\nafternoon, I went over to pay a visit to my sister at the Fort. As I\npassed into the large hall of one range of quarters, Lieutenant Lacy\ncame suddenly in from the opposite direction, and, almost without\nstopping, cried,–",
        "“Bad news, madam! Have you heard it?”",
        "“No. What is it?”",
        "“The cholera has broken out at Rock Island, and they are dying by five\nhundred a day. Dr. Finley has just arrived with the news.” So saying, he\nvanished, without stopping to answer a question.",
        "The cholera at Rock Island, and my husband there! I flew to the other\ndoor of the hall, which looked out upon the parade-ground. A sentinel\nwas walking near. “Soldier,” cried I, “will you run to the young\nofficers’ quarters and ask Dr. Finley to come here for a moment?”",
        "The man shook his head–he was not allowed to leave his post.",
        "Presently Mrs. Lacy’s servant-girl appeared from a door under the steps.\nShe was a worthless creature, but where help was so scarce ladies\ncould not afford to keep a scrupulous tariff of moral qualification.",
        "“Oh! Catharine,” said I, “will you run over and ask Dr. Finley to come\nhere a moment? I must hear what news he has brought from Rock Island.\"\nShe put on a modest look, and said,–",
        "“I do not like to go to the young officers’ quarters.”",
        "I was indignant at her hypocrisy, but I was also wild with impatience,\nwhen to my great joy Dr. Finley made his appearance.",
        "“Where is my husband?” cried I.",
        "“On his way home, madam, safe and sound. He will probably be here\nto-morrow.” He then gave me an account of the ravages the cholera was\nmaking among the troops, which were indeed severe, although less so than\nrumor had at first proclaimed.",
        "Notwithstanding the doctor’s assurance of his safety, my husband was\nseized with cholera on his journey. By the kind care of Paquette and the\nplentiful use of chicken-broth which the poor woman at whose cabin he\nstopped administered to him, he soon recovered, and reached his home in\nsafety, having taken Prairie du Chien in his route and brought his\nmother with him again to her home.",
        "The Indians had consented to the sale of their beautiful domain. Indeed,\nthere is no alternative in such cases. If they persist in retaining\nthem, and become surrounded and hemmed in by the white settlers, their\nsituation is more deplorable than if they surrendered their homes\naltogether. This they are aware of, and therefore, as a general thing,\nthey give up their lands at the proposal of Government, and only take\ncare to make the best bargain they can for themselves. In this instance\nthey were to receive as an equivalent a tract of land[57] extending to\nthe interior of Iowa, and an additional sum of ten thousand dollars\nannually.",
        "One of the stipulations of the treaty was, the surrender by the\nWinnebagoes of certain individuals of their tribe accused of having\nparticipated with the Sauks in some of the murders on the frontier, in\norder that they might be tried by our laws, and acquitted or punished as\nthe case might be.",
        "Wau-kaun-kah (the Little Snake) voluntarily gave himself as a hostage\nuntil the delivery of the suspected persons. He was accordingly received\nby the Agent, and marched over and placed in confinement at the Fort\nuntil the seven accused should appear to redeem him.",
        "It was a work of some little time on the part of the nation to persuade\nthese suspected individuals to place themselves in the hands of the\nwhites, that they might receive justice according to the laws of the\nlatter. The trial of Red Bird, and his languishing death in prison, were\nstill fresh in their memories, and it needed a good deal of resolution,\nas well as a strong conviction of conscious innocence, to brace them up\nto such a step.",
        "It had to be brought about by arguments and persuasions, for the nation\nwould never have resorted to force to compel the fulfilment of their\nstipulation.",
        "In the mean time a solemn talk was held with the principal chiefs\nassembled at the Agency. A great part of the nation were in the\nimmediate neighborhood, in obedience to a notice sent by Governor\nPorter, who, in virtue of his office of Governor of Michigan Territory,\nwas also Superintendent of the Northwest Division of the Indians.\nInstead of calling upon the Agent to take charge of the annuity money,\nas had heretofore been the custom, the Governor had announced his\nintention of bringing it himself to Fort Winnebago and being present at\nthe payment. The time appointed had now arrived, and with it the main\nbody of the Winnebagoes.",
        "Such of the Indians as had not attended the treaty at Rock Island and\nbeen instrumental in the cession of their country, were loud in their\ncondemnation of the step, and their lamentations over it. Foremost among\nthese was Wild-Cat, the Falstaff of Garlic Island and its vicinity. It\nwas little wonder that he should shed bitter tears, as he did, over the\nloss of his beautiful home on the blue waters of Winnebago Lake.",
        "“If he had not been accidentally stopped,” he said, “on his way to the\ntreaty, and detained until it was too late, he would never, never have\npermitted the bargain.”",
        "His Father, who knew that a desperate frolic, into which Wild-Cat had\nbeen enticed by the way, was the cause of his failing to accompany his\ncountrymen to Rock Island, replied, gravely,–",
        "“That he had heard of the chief’s misfortune on this occasion. How that,\nin ascending the Fox River, a couple of kegs of whiskey had come\nfloating down the stream, which, running foul of his canoe with great\nforce, had injured it to such a degree that he had been obliged to stop\nseveral days at the Mee-kan, to repair damages.”",
        "The shouts of laughter which greeted this explanation were so contagious\nthat poor Wild-Cat himself was compelled to join in it, and treat his\nmisfortune as a joke.",
        "The suspected Indians having engaged the services of Judge Doty to\ndefend them on their future trial, notice was at length given that on a\ncertain day they would be brought to the Portage and surrendered to\ntheir Father, to be by him transferred to the keeping of the military\nofficer appointed to receive them.",
        "It was joyful news to poor Wau-kaun-kah, that the day of his release was\nat hand. Every time that we had been within the walls of the Fort we had\nbeen saluted by a call from him, as he kept his station at the\nguard-room window:",
        "“Do you hear anything of those Indians? When are they coming, that I may\nbe let out?”",
        "We had endeavored to lighten his confinement by seeing that he was well\nsupplied with food, and his Father and Paquette had paid him occasional\nvisits; but, notwithstanding these attentions and the kindness he had\nreceived at the Fort, his confinement was inexpressibly irksome.",
        "On the morning of a bright autumnal day the authorities were notified\nthat the chiefs of the nation would present themselves at the Agency to\ndeliver the suspected persons as prisoners to the Americans.",
        "At the hour of ten o’clock, as we looked out over the Portage road, we\ncould descry a moving concourse of people, in which brilliant color,\nglittering arms, and, as they approached still nearer, certain white\nobjects of unusual appearance could be distinguished.",
        "General Dodge, Major Plympton, and one or two other officers took their\nseats with Mr. Kinzie on the platform in front of the door of our\nmansion to receive them, while we stationed ourselves at the window\nwhere we could both see and hear.",
        "The procession wound up the hill, and approached, marching slowly\ntowards us. It was a grand and solemn sight. First came some of the\nprincipal chiefs in their most brilliant array. Next, the prisoners, all\nhabited in white cotton, in token of their innocence, with girdles round\ntheir waists. The music of the drum and the shee-shee-qua accompanied\ntheir death-song, which they were chaunting. They wore no paint, no\nornaments–their countenances were grave and thoughtful. It might well\nbe a serious moment to them, for they knew but little of the customs of\nthe whites, and that little was not such as to inspire cheerfulness.\nOnly their Father’s assurance that they should receive strict justice,\nwould probably have induced them to comply with the engagements of the\nnation in this manner.",
        "The remainder of the procession was made up of a long train of\nWinnebagoes, all decked out in their holiday garb.",
        "The chiefs approached and shook hands with the gentlemen, who stood\nready to receive their greeting. Then the prisoners came forward, and\nwent through the same salutation with the officers. When they offered\ntheir hands to their Father, he declined.",
        "“No,” said he. “You have come here accused of great crimes–of having\nassisted in taking the lives of some of the defenceless settlers. When\nyou have been tried by the laws of the land, and been proved innocent,\nthen your Father will give you his hand.”",
        "They looked still more serious at this address, as if they thought it\nindicated that their Father, too, believed them guilty, and stepping\nback a little, they seated themselves, without speaking, in a row upon\nthe ground, facing their Father and the officers. The other Indians all\ntook seats in a circle around them, except the one-eyed chief,\nKau-ray-kau-say-kah (the White Crow), who had been deputed to deliver\nthe prisoners to the Agent.",
        "He made a speech in which he set forth that, “although asserting their\ninnocence of the charges preferred against them, his countrymen were\nquite willing to be tried by the laws of white men. He hoped they would\nnot be detained long, but that the matter would be investigated soon,\nand that they would come out of it clear and white.”",
        "In reply he was assured that all things would be conducted fairly and\nimpartially, exactly as if the accused were white men, and the hope was\nadded that they would be found to have been good and true citizens, and\npeaceful children of their Great Father, the President.",
        "When this was over, White Crow requested permission to transfer the\nmedal he had received as a mark of friendship from the President, to his\nson, who stood beside him, and who had been chosen by the nation to fill\nhis place as chief, an office he was desirous of resigning. The\nspeeches made upon this occasion, as interpreted by Paquette, the modest\ndemeanor of the young man, and the dignified yet feeling manner of the\nfather throughout, made the whole ceremony highly impressive; and when\nthe latter took the medal from his neck and hung it around that of his\nson, addressing him a few appropriate words, I think no one could have\nwitnessed the scene unmoved.",
        "I had watched the countenances of the prisoners as they sat on the\nground before me, while all these ceremonies were going forward. With\none exception they were open, calm, and expressive of conscious\ninnocence. Of that one I could not but admit there might be reasonable\ndoubts. One was remarkably fine-looking–another was a boy of certainly\nnot more than seventeen, and during the transfer of the medal he looked\nfrom one to the other, and listened to what was uttered by the speakers,\nwith an air and expression of even childlike interest and satisfaction.",
        "Our hearts felt sad for them as, the ceremonies finished, they were\nconducted by a file of soldiers and committed to the dungeon of the\nguard-house until such time as they should be summoned to attend the\ncourt appointed to try their cause.",
        "The Indians did not disperse after the ceremonies of the surrender had\nbeen gone through. They continued still in the vicinity of the Portage,\nin the constant expectation of the arrival of the annuity money, which\nthey had been summoned there to receive. But the time for setting out\non his journey to bring it was postponed by Governor Porter from week to\nweek. Had he foreseen all the evils this delay was to occasion, he\nwould, possibly, have been more prompt in fulfilling his appointment.",
        "Many causes conspired to make an early payment desirable. In the first\nplace, the Winnebagoes, having been driven from their homes by their\nanxiety to avoid all appearance of fraternizing with the Sauks, had made\nthis year no gardens nor corn-fields They had, therefore, no provisions\non hand, either for present use or for their winter’s consumption,\nexcept their scanty supplies of wild rice. While this was disappearing\nduring their protracted detention at the Portage, they were running the\nrisk of leaving themselves quite unprovided with food, in case of a bad\nhunting-season during the winter and spring.",
        "In the next place, the rations which the Agent had been accustomed, by\nthe permission of Government, to deal out occasionally to them, were now\ncut off by a scarcity in the Commissary’s department. The frequent\nlevies of the militia during the summer campaign, and the reinforcement\nof the garrison by the troops from Port Howard, had drawn so largely on\nthe stores at this post that there was necessity for the most rigid\neconomy in the issuing of supplies.",
        "Foreseeing this state of things, Mr. Kinzie, as soon as the war was at\nan end, commissioned Mr. Kercheval, then sutler at Fort Howard, to\nprocure him a couple of boat-loads of corn, to be distributed among the\nIndians. Unfortunately, there was no corn to be obtained from Michigan;\nit was necessary to bring it from Ohio, and by the time it at length\nreached Green Bay (for in those days business was never done in a hurry)\nthe navigation of the Fox River had closed, and it was detained there,\nto be brought up the following spring.",
        "As day after day wore on and “the silver” did not make its appearance,\nthe Indians were advised by their Father to disperse to their\nhunting-grounds to procure food, with the promise that they should be\nsummoned immediately on the arrival of Governor Porter; and this advice\nthey followed.",
        "While they had been in our neighborhood, they had more than once asked\npermission to dance the scalp-dance, before our door. This is the most\nfrightful, heart-curdling exhibition that can possibly be imagined. The\nscalps are stretched on little hoops, or frames, and carried on the end\nof slender poles. These are brandished about in the course of the dance,\nwith cries, shouts, and furious gestures. The women, who commence as\nspectators, becoming excited with the scene and the music which their\nown discordant notes help to make more deafening, rush in, seize the\nscalps from the hands of the owners, and toss them frantically about,\nwith the screams and yells of demons. I have seen as many as forty or\nfifty scalps figuring in one dance. Upon one occasion one was borne by\nan Indian who approached quite near me, and I shuddered as I observed\nthe long, fair hair, evidently that of a woman. Another Indian had the\nskin of a human hand, stretched and prepared with as much care as if it\nhad been some costly jewel. When these dances occurred, as they\nsometimes did, by moonlight, they were peculiarly horrid and revolting.",
        "Amid so many events of a painful character there were not wanting\noccasionally some that bordered on the ludicrous.",
        "One evening, while sitting at tea, we were alarmed by the sound of guns\nfiring in the direction of the Wisconsin. All started up, and prepared,\ninstinctively, for flight to the garrison. As we left the house we found\nthe whole bluff and the meadow below in commotion,–Indians running with\ntheir guns and spears across their shoulders to the scene of\nalarm–squaws and children standing in front of their lodges and looking\nanxiously in the direction of the unusual and unaccountable\nsounds–groups of French and half-breeds, like ourselves, fleeing to\ngain the bridge and place themselves within the pickets so lately\nerected.",
        "As one company of Indians passed us hurriedly, some weapon carelessly\ncarried hit one of our party on the side of the head. “Oh!” shrieked\nshe, “I am killed! an Indian has tomahawked me!” and she was only\nreassured by finding she could still run as fast as the best of us.",
        "When we reached the parade-ground, within the Fort, we could not help\nlaughing at the grotesque appearance we presented. Some without hats or\nshawls–others with packages of valuables hastily secured at the\nmoment–one with her piece of bread-and-butter in hand, which she had\nnot had the presence of mind to lay aside when she took to flight.",
        "The alarm was, in the end, found to have proceeded from a party of\nWinnebagoes from one of the Barribault villages, who, being about to\nleave their home for a period, were going through the ceremony of\nburying the scalps which they and their fathers had taken.",
        "Like the military funerals among civilized nations, their solemnities\nwere closed on this occasion by the discharge of several volleys over\nthe grave of their trophies.",
        "At length, about the beginning of November, two months after the time\nappointed, Governor Porter, accompanied by Major Forsyth and Mr.\nKercheval, arrived with the annuity money. The Indians were again\nassembled, the payment was made, and having supplied themselves with a\nlarger quantity of ammunition than usual,–for they saw the necessity of\na good hunt to remedy past and present deficiencies,–they set off for\ntheir wintering grounds.",
        "We were, ourselves, about changing our quarters, to our no small\nsatisfaction. Notwithstanding the Indian disturbances, the new Agency\nHouse (permission to build which had, after much delay, been accorded by\nGovernment) had been going steadily on, and soon after the departure of\nthe Governor and his party, we took possession of it.",
        "We had been settled but a few weeks, when one morning Lieutenant Davies\nappeared just as we were sitting down to breakfast, with a face full of\nconsternation. ’The Indian prisoners had escaped from the black-hole!\nThe commanding officer, Colonel Cutler, had sent for Mr. Kinzie to come\nover to the Fort and counsel with him what was to be done.”",
        "The prisoners had probably commenced their operations very soon after\nbeing placed in the black-hole, a dungeon in the basement of the\nguard-house. They observed that their meals were brought regularly,\nthree times a day, and that in the intervals they were left entirely to\nthemselves. With their knives they commenced excavating an opening, the\nearth from which, as it was withdrawn, they spread about on the floor of\ntheir prison. A blanket was placed over the hole, and one of the company\nwas always seated upon it, before the regular time for the soldier who\nhad charge of them to make his appearance. When the periodical visit was\nmade, the Indians were always observed to be seated, smoking in the most\norderly and quiet manner. There was never anything in their appearance\nto excite suspicion.",
        "The prisoners had never read the memoirs of Baron Trenck, but they had\nwatched the proceedings of the badgers; so, profiting by their example,\nthey worked on, shaping the opening spirally, until, in about six weeks,\nthey came out to the open air beyond the walls of the Fort.",
        "That they might be as little encumbered as possible in their flight,\nthey left their blankets behind them, and although it was bitter\nDecember weather, they took to the woods and prairies with only their\ncalico shirts and leggings for covering. We can readily believe that\nhope and exultation kept them comfortably warm until they reached an\nasylum among their friends.",
        "It would be compromising our own reputation as loyal and patriotic\ncitizens to tell of the secret rejoicing this news occasioned us.",
        "The question now was, how to get the fugitives back again. The Agent\ncould promise no more than that he would communicate with the chiefs,\nand represent the wishes of the officers that the prisoners should once\nmore surrender themselves, and thus free those who had had the charge of\nthem from the imputation of carelessness, which the Government would be\nvery likely to throw upon them.",
        "When, according to their custom, many of the chiefs assembled at the\nAgency on New-Year’s Day, their Father laid the subject before them.",
        "The Indians replied, that if they saw the young men they would tell\nthem what the officers would like to have them do. They could,\nthemselves, do nothing in the matter. They had fulfilled their\nengagement by bringing them once and putting them in the hands of the\nofficers. The Government had had them in its power once and could not\nkeep them–it must now go and catch them itself.",
        "The Government, having had some experience the past summer in “catching\nIndians,” wisely concluded to drop the matter.",
        "About this time another event occurred which occasioned no small\nexcitement in our little community. Robineau, the striker from the\nblacksmith establishment at Sugar Creek, near the Four Lakes, arrived\none very cold day at the Agency. He had come to procure medical aid for\nMâtâ’s eldest daughter, Sophy, who, while sliding on the lake, had\nfallen on the ice and been badly hurt. Her father was absent, having\ngone to Prairie du Chien to place his youngest daughter at school. Two\nor three days had elapsed since the accident had happened; a high fever\nhad set in, and the poor girl was in a state of great suffering; it had\ntherefore been thought best to send Robineau to us for advice and aid,\nleaving Turcotte and a friendly Indian woman from a neighboring lodge to\ntake charge of poor Sophy.",
        "The commanding officer did not think it prudent, when the subject was\nlaid before him, to permit the surgeon to leave the post, but he very\ncheerfully granted leave of absence to Currie, the hospital steward, a\nyoung man who possessed some knowledge of medicine and surgery.",
        "As it was important that Sophy should have an experienced nurse, we\nprocured the services of Madame Bellaire, the wife of the Frenchman who\nwas generally employed as express to Chicago; and, as an aid and\ncompanion, Agathe, a daughter of Day-kau-ray, who lived in Paquette’s\nfamily, was added to the party.",
        "Of Agathe I shall have more to say hereafter.",
        "The weather was excessively cold when Robineau, Currie, and the two\nwomen set out for Sugar Creek, a distance of about forty miles. We had\nprovided them with a good store of rice, crackers, tea, and sugar, for\nthe invalid, all of which, with their provisions for the way, were\npacked on the horse Robineau had ridden to the Portage. It was expected\nthey would reach their place of destination on the second day.",
        "What, then, was our surprise to see Turcotte make his appearance on the\nfourth day after their departure, to inquire why Robineau had not\nreturned with aid for poor Sophy! There was but one solution of the\nmystery. Robineau had guided them as ill as he had guided the boat at\nthe Grande Chûte the summer before, and, although he could not shipwreck\nthem, he had undoubtedly lost them in the woods or prairies. One comfort\nwas, that they could not well starve, for the rice and crackers would\nfurnish them with several days’ provisions, and with Agathe, who must be\naccustomed to this kind of life, they could not fail in time of finding\nIndians, and being brought back to the Portage.",
        "Still, day after day went on and we received no tidings of them.\nTurcotte returned to Sugar Creek with comforts and prescriptions for\nSophy, and Colonel Cutler sent out a party to hunt for the missing ones,\namong whom poor Currie, from his delicate constitution, was the object\nof our greatest commiseration.",
        "As the snow fell and the winds howled, we could employ ourselves about\nnothing but walking from window to window, watching, in hopes of seeing\nsome one appear in the distance. No Indians were at hand whom we could\ndispatch upon the search, and by the tenth day we had almost given up in\ndespair.",
        "It was then that the joyful news was suddenly brought us, “They are\nfound! They are at the Fort!” A party of soldiers who had been exploring\nhad encountered them at Hastings’s Woods, twelve miles distant, slowly\nand feebly making their way back to the Portage. They knew they were on\nthe right track, but had hardly strength to pursue it.",
        "Exhausted with cold and hunger, for their provisions had given out two\ndays before, they had thought seriously of killing the horse and eating\nhim. Nothing but Currie’s inability to proceed on foot, and the dread of\nbeing compelled to leave him in the woods to perish, had deterred them.",
        "Agathe had from the first been convinced that they were on the wrong\ntrack, but Robineau, with his usual obstinacy, persevered in keeping it\nuntil it brought them to the Rock River, when he was obliged to\nacknowledge his error, and they commenced retracing their steps.",
        "Agathe, according to the custom of her people, had carried her hatchet\nwith her, and thus they had always had a fire at night, and boughs to\nshelter them from the storms; otherwise they must inevitably have\nperished.",
        "There were two circumstances which aroused in us a stronger feeling even\nthan that of sympathy. The first was, the miserable Robineau’s having\ndemanded of Currie, first, all his money, and afterwards his watch, as a\ncondition of his bringing the party back into the right path, which he\naverred he knew perfectly well.",
        "The second was, Bellaire’s giving his kind, excellent wife a hearty\nflogging “for going off,” as he said, “on such a fool’s errand.”",
        "The latter culprit was out of our jurisdiction, but Mons. Robineau was\ndischarged on the spot, and warned that he might think himself happy to\nescape a legal process for swindling.",
        "I am happy to say that Sophy Mâtâ, in whose behalf all these sufferings\nhad been endured, was quite recovered by the time her father returned\nfrom the Prairie.",
        "Agathe was the daughter of an Indian who was distinguished by the name\nof Rascal Day-kau-ray. Whether he merited the appellation must be\ndetermined hereafter. He was brother to the grand old chief of that\nname, but as unlike him as it is possible for those of the same blood to\nbe.",
        "The Day-kau-rays were a very handsome family, and this daughter was\nremarkable for her fine personal endowments. A tall, well-developed\nform, a round, sweet face, and that peculiarly soft, melodious voice\nwhich belongs to the women of her people, would have attracted the\nattention of a stranger, while the pensive expression of her countenance\nirresistibly drew the hearts of all towards her, and prompted the wish\nto know more of her history. As I received it from her friend, Mrs.\nPaquette, it was indeed a touching one.",
        "A young officer at the Fort had seen her, and had set, I will not say\nhis heart–it may be doubted if he had one–but his mind upon her. He\napplied to Paquette to negotiate what he called a marriage with her. I\nam sorry to say that Paquette was induced to enter into this scheme. He\nknew full well the sin of making false representations to the family of\nAgathe, and he knew the misery he was about to bring upon her.",
        "The poor girl had been betrothed to a young man of her own people, and,\nas is generally the case, the attachment on both sides was very strong.\nAmong these simple people, who have few subjects of thought or\nspeculation beyond the interests of their daily life, their affections\nand their animosities form the warp and woof of their character. All\ntheir feelings are intense, from being concentrated on so few objects.\nFamily relations, particularly with the women, engross the whole amount\nof their sensibilities.",
        "The marriage connection is a sacred and indissoluble tie. I have read,\nin a recent report to the Historical Society of Wisconsin, that, in\nformer times, a temporary marriage between a white man and a Menomonee\nwoman was no uncommon occurrence, and that such an arrangement brought\nno scandal, I am afraid that if such eases were investigated, a good\ndeal of deceit and misrepresentation would be found to have been added\nto the other sins of the transaction; and that the woman would be found\nto have been a victim, instead of a willing participant, in such a\nconnection.",
        "At all events, no system of this kind exists among the Winnebagoes. The\nstrictest sense of female propriety is a distinguishing trait among\nthem. A woman who transgresses it is said to have “forgotten herself,\"\nand is sure to be cast off and “forgotten” by her friends.",
        "The marriage proposed between the young officer and the daughter of\nDay-kau-ray, was understood as intended to be true and lasting. The\nfather would not have exposed himself to the contempt of his whole\nnation by selling his daughter to become the mistress of any man. The\nDay-kau-rays, as I have elsewhere said, were not a little proud of a\nremote cross of French blood which mingled with the aboriginal stream in\ntheir veins, and probably in acceding to the proposed connection the\nfather of Agathe was as much influenced by what he considered the honor\nto be derived as by the amount of valuable presents which accompanied\nthe overtures made to him.",
        "Be that as it may, the poor girl was torn from her lover, and\ntransferred from her father’s lodge to the quarters of the young\nofficer.",
        "There were no ladies in the garrison at that time. Had there been, such\na step would hardly have been ventured. Far away in the wilderness, shut\nout from the salutary influences of religious and social cultivation,\nwhat wonder that the moral sense sometimes becomes blinded, and that the\nchoice is made, “Evil, be thou my good!”",
        "The first step in wrong was followed by one still more aggravated in\ncruelty. The young officer left the post, as he said, on furlough, but\nhe never returned. The news came after a time that he was married, and\nwhen he again joined his regiment it was at another post.",
        "There was a natural feeling in the strength of the “woe pronounced\nagainst him” by more tongues than one. “He will never,” said my\ninformant, “dare show himself in this country again! Not an Indian who\nknows the Day-kau-rays but would take his life if he should meet him!”",
        "Every tie was broken for poor Agathe but that which bound her to her\ninfant. She never returned to her father’s lodge, for she felt that,\nbeing deserted, she was dishonored. Her sole ambition seemed to be to\nbring up her child like those of the whites. She attired it in the\ncostume of the French children, with a dress of bright calico, and a cap\nof the same, trimmed with narrow black lace. It was a fine child, and\nthe only time I ever saw a smile cross her face was when it was\ncommended and caressed by some member of our family.",
        "Even this, her only source of happiness, poor Agathe was called upon to\nresign. During our absence at Green Bay, while the Sauks were in the\nneighborhood, the child was taken violently ill. The house at\nPaquette’s, which was the mother’s home, was thronged with Indians, and\nof course there was much noise and disturbance. My husband had a place\nprepared for her under our roof, where she could be more quiet, and\nreceive the attendance of the post physician. It was all in\nvain–nothing could save the little creature’s life. The bitter agony of\nthe mother, as she hung over the only treasure she possessed on earth,\nwas described to me as truly heart-rending. When compelled to part with\nit, it seemed almost more than nature could bear. There were friends,\nnot of her own nation or color, who strove to comfort her. Did the\nfather ever send a thought or an inquiry after the fate of his child, or\nof the young being whose life he had rendered dark and desolate? We will\nhope that he did–that he repented and asked pardon from above for the\nevil he had wrought.",
        "Agathe had been baptized by M. Mazzuchelli. Perhaps she may have\nacquired some religious knowledge which could bring her consolation in\nher sorrows, and compensate her for the hopes and joys so early blasted.",
        "She came, some months after the death of her child, in company with\nseveral of the half-breed women of the neighborhood, to pay me a visit\nof respect and congratulation on the advent of the young\nShaw-nee-aw-kee. When she looked at her “little brother,” as he was\ncalled, and took his soft, tiny hand within her own, the tears stood in\nher eyes, and she spoke some little words of tenderness, which showed\nthat her heart was full. I could scarcely refrain from mingling my tears\nwith hers, as I thought on all the sorrow and desolation that one man’s\nselfishness had occasioned.",
        "Early in February, 1833, my husband and Lieutenant Hunter, in company\nwith one or two others, set off on a journey to Chicago. That place had\nbecome so much of a town (it contained perhaps fifty inhabitants) that\nit was necessary for the proprietors of “Kinzie’s Addition” to lay out\nlots and open streets through their property. All this was accomplished\nduring the visit in question.",
        "While they were upon the ground with a surveyor, the attention of my\nhusband was drawn towards a very bright-looking boy in Indian costume,\nwho went hopping along by the side of the assistant that carried the\nchain, mimicking him as in the course of his operations he cried,\n\"Stick!” “stuck!” He inquired who the lad was, and, to his surprise,\nlearned that he was the brother of the old family servants Victoire,\nGenevieve, and Baptiste. Tomah, for that was his name, had never been\narrayed in civilized costume; he was in blanket and leggings, and had\nalways lived in a wigwam. My husband inquired if he would like to go to\nFort Winnebago with him and learn to be a white boy. The idea pleased\nhim much, and, his mother having given her sanction to the arrangement,\nhe was packed in a wagon, with the two gentlemen and their travelling\ngear, when they set forth on their return-journey.",
        "Tomah had been equipped in jacket and trousers, with the other articles\nof apparel necessary to his new sphere and character. They were near the\nAux Plaines, and approaching the residence of Glode (Claude)\nLaframboise, where Tomah knew he should meet acquaintances. He asked\nleave to get out of the wagon and walk a little way. When the gentlemen\nnext saw him he was in full Pottowattamie costume: although it was\nbitter winter weather, he had put on his uncomfortable native garb\nrather than show himself to his old friends in a state of\ntransformation.",
        "On his arrival at Fort Winnebago, our first care was to furnish him\nwith a complete wardrobe, which, having been placed in a box in his\nsleeping-apartment, was put under his charge. Words cannot express his\ndelight as the valuable possessions were confided to him. Every spare\nmoment was devoted to their contemplation. Now and then Tomah would be\nmissing. He was invariably found seated by the side of his little trunk,\nfolding and refolding his clothes, laying them now lengthwise, now\ncrosswise, the happiest of mortals.",
        "Our next step was to teach him to be useful. Such little offices were\nassigned to him at first as might be supposed not altogether new to him,\nbut we soon observed that when there was anything in the shape of work,\nTomah slipped off to bed, even if it were before he had taken his\nsupper. Some fish were given him one evening to scale; it was just at\ndark; but Tom, according to custom, retired at once to bed.",
        "The cook came to inquire what was to be done. I was under the necessity\nof calling in my husband’s aid as interpreter. He sent for Tomah. When\nhe came into the parlor Mr. Kinzie said to him, in Pottowattamie,–",
        "“There are some fish, Tomah, in the kitchen, and we want you to scale\nthem.”",
        "“Now?” exclaimed Tom, with an expression of amazement. “It is very\nlate.”",
        "A young lady, Miss Rolette, who was visiting us, and who understood the\nlanguage, could not refrain from bursting into a laugh at the simplicity\nwith which the words were uttered, and we joined her in sympathy, at\nwhich Tom looked a little indignant; but when he understood that it was\nthe white custom to scale the fish at night, and put salt and pepper\non them, he was soon reconciled to do his duty in the matter.",
        "His next office was to lay the table. There was a best service of\nchina, which was only used when we had company, and a best set of\nteaspoons, which I kept in the drawer of a bureau in my own room\nabove-stairs. I Was in the habit of keeping this drawer locked, and\nputting the key under a small clock on the mantel-piece. The first time\nthat I had shown Tomah how to arrange matters for visitors, I had\nbrought the silver and put it on the table myself.",
        "Soon after, we were to have company to tea again, and I explained to\nTomah that the best china must be used. What was my surprise, on going\nthrough the dining-room a short time after, to see not only the new\nchina, but the “company silver” also, on the table! I requested our\nmother, who could speak with him, to inquire into the matter.",
        "Tomah said, very coolly, “He got the silver where it was kept.”",
        "“Did he find the drawer open?”",
        "“No–he opened it with a key.”",
        "“Was the key in the drawer?”",
        "“No–it was under that thing on the shelf.”",
        "“How did he know it was kept there?”",
        "This was what Mr. Tomah declined telling. We could never ascertain\nwhether he had watched my movements at any time. No one had ever seen\nhim in that part of the house, and yet scarcely an article could be\nmentioned of which Tomah did not know the whereabouts. If any one was\npuzzled to find a thing, it was always,–",
        "“Ask Tomah–he will tell you.” And so in fact he did.",
        "He was a subject of much amusement to the young officers. We were to\nhave a tea-party one evening–all the families and young officers from\nthe Fort. To make Tomah’s appearance as professional as possible, we\nmade him a white apron with long sleeves to put on while he was helping\nMary and Josette to carry round tea–for I must acknowledge that Tomah’s\nclothes were not kept in as nice order out of the trunk as in it.",
        "Tom was delighted with his new costume, as well as with the new\nemployment. He acquitted himself to perfection, for he had never any\ndifficulty in imitating what he saw another do. After tea we had some\nmusic. As I was standing by the piano, at which one of the ladies was\nseated, Lieutenant Vancleve said to me, in a low tone,–",
        "“Look behind you a moment.”",
        "I turned. There sat Tom between two of the company, as stately as\npossible, with his white apron smoothed down, and his hands clasped\nbefore him, listening to the music, and on the best possible terms with\nhimself and all around him. Julian and Edwin were hardly able to\nrestrain their merriment, but they were afraid to do or say anything\nthat would cause him to move before the company had had a full enjoyment\nof the scene. It was voted unanimously that Tomah should be permitted to\nremain and enjoy the pleasures of society for one evening; but, with\ncharacteristic restlessness, he got tired as soon as the music was over,\nand unceremoniously took his leave of the company.",
        "What we had long anticipated of the sufferings of the Indians began to\nmanifest itself as the spring drew on. Its extent was first brought to\nour knowledge by those who came in little parties begging for food.",
        "As long as it was possible to issue occasional rations their Father\ncontinued to do so, but the supplies in the Commissary Department were\nnow so much reduced that Colonel Cutler did not feel justified in\nauthorizing anything beyond a scanty relief, and this only in extreme\ncases.",
        "We had ourselves throughout the winter used the greatest economy with\nour own stores, that we might not exhaust our slender stock of flour and\nmeal before it could be replenished from “below.” We had even purchased\nsome sour flour which had been condemned by the commissary, and had\ncontrived, by a plentiful use of saleratus and a due proportion of\npotatoes, to make of it a very palatable kind of bread. But as we had\ncontinued to give to party after party, when they would come to us to\nrepresent their famishing condition, the time at length arrived when we\nhad nothing to give.",
        "The half-breed families of the neighborhood, who had, like ourselves,\ncontinued to share with the needy as long as their own stock lasted,\nwere now obliged, of necessity, to refuse further assistance. These\nwomen often came to lament with us over the sad accounts that were\nbrought from the wintering grounds. It had been a very open winter. The\nsnow had scarcely been enough at any time to permit the Indians to track\nthe deer; in fact, all the game had been driven off by the troops and\nwar-parties scouring the country through the preceding summer.",
        "We heard of their dying by companies from mere inanition, and lying\nstretched in the road to the Portage, whither they were striving to drag\ntheir exhausted frames. Soup made of the bark of the slippery elm, or\nstewed acorns, were the only food that many had subsisted on for weeks.",
        "We had for a long time received our own food by daily rations from the\ngarrison, for things had got to such a pass that there was no\npossibility of obtaining a barrel of flour at a time. After our meals\nwere finished I always went into the pantry, and collecting carefully\nevery remaining particle of food set it aside, to be given to some of\nthe wretched applicants by whom we were constantly thronged.",
        "One day as I was thus employed, a face appeared at the window with which\nI had once been familiar. It was the pretty daughter of the elder\nDay-kau-ray. She had formerly visited us often, watching with great\ninterest our employments–our sewing, our weeding and cultivating the\ngarden, or our reading. Of the latter, I had many times endeavored to\ngive her some idea, showing her the plates in the Family Bible, and\ndoing my best to explain them to her, but of late I had quite lost sight\nof her. Now, how changed, how wan she looked! As I addressed her with my\nordinary phrase, ’Tshah-ko-zhah?” (What is it?) she gave a sigh that\nwas almost a sob. She did not beg, but her countenance spoke volumes.",
        "I took my dish and handed it to her, expecting to see her devour the\ncontents eagerly; but no–she took it, and, making signs that she would\nsoon return, walked away. When she brought it back, I was almost sure\nshe had not tasted a morsel herself.",
        "Oh! the boats–the boats with the corn! Why did they not come? We both\nwrote and sent to hasten them, but, alas! everything and everybody moved\nso slowly in those unenterprising times! We could only feel sure that\nthey would come when they were ready, and not a moment before.",
        "We were soon obliged to keep both doors and windows fast, to shut out\nthe sight of misery we could not relieve. If a door were opened for the\nadmission of a member of the family, some wretched mother would rush in,\ngrasp the hand of my infant, and, placing that of her famishing child\nwithin it, tell us, pleadingly, that he was imploring “his little\nbrother” for food. The stoutest man could not have beheld with dry eyes\nthe heart-rending spectacle which often presented itself. It was in vain\nthat we screened the lower portion of our windows with curtains. They\nwould climb up on the outside, and tier upon tier of gaunt, wretched\nfaces would peer in above, to watch us, and see if indeed we were as ill\nprovided as we represented ourselves.",
        "The noble old Day-kau-ray came one day, from the Barribault, to apprise\nus of the state of his village. More than forty of his people, he said,\nhad now been for many days without food, save bark and roots. My husband\naccompanied him to the commanding officer to tell his story and\nascertain if any amount of food could be obtained from that quarter. The\nresult was, the promise of a small allowance of flour, sufficient to\nalleviate the cravings of his own family.",
        "When this was explained to the chief, he turned away. “No,” he said,\n\"if his people could not be relieved, he and his family would starve\nwith them!” And he refused, for those nearest and dearest to him, the\nproffered succor, until all could share alike.",
        "The announcement, at length, that “the boats were in sight,” was a\nthrilling and most joyful sound.",
        "Hundreds of poor creatures were assembled on the bank, watching their\narrival. Oh! how torturing was their slow approach, by the winding\ncourse of the river, through the extended prairie! As the first boat\ntouched the land, we, who were gazing on the scene with anxiety and\nimpatience only equalled by that of the sufferers, could scarcely\nrefrain from laughing, to see old Wild-Cat, who had somewhat fallen off\nin his huge amount of flesh, seize “the Washington Woman” in his arms\nand hug and dance with her in the ecstasy of his delight.",
        "Their Father made a sign to them all to fall to work with their\nhatchets, which they had long held ready, and in an incredibly short\ntime barrel after barrel of corn was broken open and emptied, while even\nthe little children possessed themselves of pans and kettles full, and\nhastened to the fires that were blazing around to parch and cook that\nwhich they had seized.",
        "From this time forward, there was no more destitution. The present\nabundance was immediately followed by the arrival of supplies for the\nCommissary’s Department; and, refreshed and invigorated, our poor\nchildren departed once more to their villages, to make ready their crops\nfor the ensuing season.",
        "In the course of the spring, we received a visit from the Rev. Mr. Kent\nand Mrs. Kent, of Galena. This event is memorable, as being the first\noccasion on which the gospel, according to the Protestant faith, was\npreached at Fort Winnebago. The large parlor of the hospital was fitted\nup for the service, and gladly did we each say to the other, “Let us go\nto the house of the Lord!”",
        "For nearly three years had we lived here without the blessing of a\npublic service of praise and thanksgiving. We regarded this commencement\nas an omen of better times, and our little “sewing-society” worked with\nrenewed industry, to raise a fund Which might be available hereafter in\nsecuring the permanent services of a missionary.",
        "Not long after this, on a fine spring morning, as we were seated at\nbreakfast, a party of Indians entered the parlor, and came to the door\nof the room where we were. Two of them passed through, and went out upon\na small portico–the third remained standing in the door-way at which he\nhad at first appeared. He was nearly opposite me, and as I raised my\neyes, spite of his change of dress, and the paint with which he was\ncovered, I at once recognized him.",
        "I continued to pour the coffee, and, as I did so, I remarked to my\nhusband, “The one behind you, with whom you are speaking, is one of the\nescaped prisoners.”",
        "Without turning his head, Mr. Kinzie continued to listen to all the\ndirections they were giving him about the repairing of their guns,\ntraps, etc., which they wished to leave with the blacksmith. As they\nwent on, he carelessly turned towards the parlor door, and replied to\nthe one speaking to him. When he again addressed me, it was to say,–",

        "Contrary to his usual custom, their Father did not ask their names, but\nwrote their directions, which he tied to their different implements, and\nthen bade them go and deliver them themselves to M. Morrin.",
        "The rest of our circle were greatly pleased at the young fellow’s\naudacity, and we quite longed to tell the officers that we could have\ncaught one of their fugitives for them, if we had had a mind.",
        "The time had now come when we began to think seriously of leaving our\npleasant home, and taking up our residence at Detroit, while making\narrangements for a permanent settlement at Chicago.",
        "This intelligence, when communicated to our Winnebago children, brought\nforth great lamentations and demonstrations of regret. From the\nsurrounding country they came flocking in, to inquire into the truth of\nthe tidings they had heard, and to petition earnestly that we would\ncontinue to live and die among them.",
        "Among them all, no one seemed so overwhelmed with affliction as\nElizabeth, our poor Cut-Nose. When we first told her of our intention,\nshe sat for hours in the same spot, wiping away the tears that would\nfind their way down her cheeks, with the corner of the chintz shawl she\nwore pinned across her bosom.",

        "And having taken an extra glass on the occasion, he wept like an infant.",
        "It was with sad hearts that on the morning of the 1st of July, 1888, we\nbade adieu to the long cortége which followed us to the boat, now\nwaiting to convey us to Green Bay, where we were to meet Governor Porter\nand Mr. Brush, and proceed, under their escort, to Detroit.",
        "When they had completed their tender farewells, they turned to accompany\ntheir father across the Portage, on his route to Chicago, and long\nafter, we could see them winding along the road, and hear their loud\nlamentations at a parting which they foresaw would be forever.",
        "As I have given throughout the Narrative of the Sauk War the impressions\nwe received from our own observation, or from information furnished us\nat the time, I think it but justice to Black Hawk and his party to\ninsert, by way of Appendix, the following account, preserved among the\nmanuscript records of the late Thomas Forsyth, Esq., of St. Louis, who,\nafter residing among the Indians many years as a trader, was, until the\nyear 1830, the Agent of the Sauks and Foxes. The manuscript was written\nin 1832, while Black Hawk and his compatriots were in prison at\nJefferson Barracks.",
        "“The United States troops under the command of Major Stoddard arrived\nhere[58] and took possession of this country in the month of February,\n1804. In the spring of that year, a white person (a man or boy) was\nkilled in Cuivre Settlement, by a Sauk Indian Some time in the summer\nfollowing, a party of United States troops were sent up to the Sauk\nvillage on Rocky Biver, and a demand made of the Sauk chiefs for the\nmurderer. The Sauk chiefs did not hesitate a moment, but delivered him\nup to the commander of the troops, who brought him down and delivered\nhim over to the civil authority in this place (St. Louis).",
        "“Some time in the ensuing autumn some Sauk and Fox Indians came to this\nplace, and had a conversation with General Harrison (then Governor of\nIndiana Territory, and acting Governor of this State, then Territory of\nLouisiana) on the subject of liberating their relative, then in prison\nat this place for the above-mentioned murder.",
        "“Quash-quame, a Sauk chief, who was the head man of this party, has\nrepeatedly said, ’Mr. Pierre Chouteau, Sen., came several times to my\ncamp, offering that if I would sell the lands on the east side of the\nMississippi River, Governor Harrison would liberate my relation (meaning\nthe Sauk Indian then in prison as above related), to which I at last\nagreed, and sold the lands from the mouth of the Illinois River up the\nMississippi River as high as the mouth of Rocky River (now Rock River),\nand east to the ridge that divides the waters of the Mississippi and\nIllinois Rivers; but I never sold any more lands.’ Quash-quame also said\nto Governor Edwards, Governor Clarke, and Mr. Auguste Chouteau,\nCommissioners appointed to treat with the Chippewas, Ottawas, and\nPottowattamies of Illinois River, in the summer of 1816, for lands on\nthe west side of Illinois River,–",
        "“’You white men may put on paper what you please, but again I tell you,\nI never sold any lands higher up the Mississippi than the mouth of Rocky\nRiver.’",
        "“In the treaty first mentioned, the line commences opposite to the mouth\nof Gasconade River, and running in a direct line to the head-waters of\nJefferson[59] River, thence down that river to the Mississippi\nRiver–thence up the Mississippi River to the mouth of the Ouisconsin\nRiver–thence up that river thirty-six miles–thence in a direct line to\na little lake in Fox River of Illinois, down Fox River to Illinois\nRiver, down Illinois River to its mouth–thence down the Mississippi\nRiver to the mouth of Missouri River–thence up that river to the place\nof beginning. See treaty dated at St. Louis, 4th November, 1804.",
        "“The Sauk and Fox nations were never consulted, nor had any hand in this\ntreaty, nor knew anything about it. It was made and signed by two Sauk\nchiefs, one Fox chief and one warrior.",
        "“When the annuities were delivered to the Sauk and Fox nations of\nIndians, according to the treaty above referred to (amounting to $1000\nper annum), the Indians always thought they were presents (as the\nannuity for the first twenty years was always paid in goods, sent on\nfrom Georgetown, District of Columbia, and poor articles of merchandise\nthey were, very often damaged and not suitable for Indians), until I, as\ntheir Agent, convinced them of the contrary, in the summer of 1818. When\nthe Indians heard that the goods delivered to them were annuities for\nland sold by them to the United States, they were astonished, and\nrefused to accept of the goods, denying that they ever sold the lands as\nstated by me, their Agent. The Black Hawk in particular, who was present\nat the time, made a great noise about this land, and would never receive\nany part of the annuities from that time forward. He always denied the\nauthority of Quash-quame and others to sell any part of their lands, and\ntold the Indians not to receive any presents or annuities from any\nAmerican–otherwise their lands would be claimed at some future day.",
        "“As the United States do insist, and retain the lands according to the\ntreaty of November 4, 1804, why do they not fulfil their part of that\ntreaty as equity demands?",
        "“The Sauk and Fox nations are allowed, according to that treaty, ’to\nlive and hunt on the lands so ceded, as long as the aforesaid lands\nbelong to the United States.’ In the spring of the year 1827, about\ntwelve or fifteen families of squatters arrived and took possession of\nthe Sauk village, near the mouth of the Rocky River. They immediately\ncommenced destroying the Indians’ bark boats. Some were burned, others\nwere torn to pieces, and when the Indians arrived at the village, and\nfound fault with the destruction of their property, they were beaten and\nabused by the squatters.",
        "“The Indians made complaint to me, as their Agent. I wrote to General\nClarke,[60] stating to him from time to time what happened, and giving a\nminute detail of everything that passed between the whites (squatters)\nand the Indians.",
        "“The squatters insisted that the Indians should be removed from their\nvillage, saying that as soon as the land was brought into market they\n(the squatters) would buy it all. It became needless for me to show them\nthe treaty, and the right the Indians had to remain on their lands. They\ntried every method to annoy the Indians, by shooting their dogs,\nclaiming their horses, complaining that the Indians’ horses broke into\ntheir corn-fields–selling them whiskey for the most trifling articles,\ncontrary to the wishes and request of the chiefs, particularly the Black\nHawk, who both solicited and threatened them on the subject, but all to\nno purpose.",
        "“The President directed those lands to be sold at the Land Office, in\nSpringfield, Illinois. Accordingly, when the time came that they were to\nbe offered for sale (in the autumn of 1828), there were about twenty\nfamilies of squatters at, and in the vicinity of, the old Sauk village,\nmost of whom attended the sale, and but one of them could purchase a\nquarter-section (if we except George Davenport, a trader who resides in\nRocky Island). Therefore, all the land not sold, still belonged to the\nUnited States, and the Indians had still a right, by treaty, to hunt and\nlive on those lands. This right, however, was not allowed them–they\nmust move off.",
        "“In 1830, the principal chiefs, and others of the Sauk and Fox Indians\nwho resided at the old village, near Rocky River, acquainted me that\nthey would remove to their village on Ihoway River. These chiefs advised\nme to write to General Clarke, Superintendent of Indian Affairs at this\nplace (St. Louis), to send up a few militia–that the Black Hawk and his\nfollowers would then see that everything was in earnest, and they would\nremove to the west side of the Mississippi, to their own lands.",
        "“The letter, as requested by the chiefs, was written and sent by me to\nGeneral Clarke, but he did not think proper to answer it–therefore\neverything remained as formerly, and, as a matter of course, the Black\nHawk and his party thought the whole matter of removing from the old\nvillage had blown over.",
        "“In the spring of 1831, the Black Hawk and his party were augmented by\nmany Indians from Ihoway River. This augmentation of forces made the\nBlack Hawk very proud, and he supposed nothing would be done about\nremoving him and his party.",
        "“General Gaines visited the Black Hawk and his party this season, with a\nforce of regulars and militia, and compelled them to remove to the west\nside of the Mississippi River, on their own lands.",
        "“When the Black Hawk and party recrossed to the east side of the\nMississippi River in 1832, they numbered three hundred and sixty-eight\nmen. They were hampered with many women and children, and had no\nintention to make war. When attacked by General Stillman’s detachment,\nthey defended themselves like men; and I would ask, who would not do\nso, likewise? Thus the war commenced.",
        "“The Indians had been defeated, dispersed, and some of the principal\nchiefs are now in prison and in chains, at Jefferson Barracks....",
        "“It is very well known, by all who know the Black Hawk, that he has\nalways been considered a friend to the whites. Often has he taken into\nhis lodge the wearied white man, given him good food to eat, and a good\nblanket to sleep on before the fire. Many a good meal has the Prophetgiven to people travelling past his village, and very many stray horses\nhas he recovered from the Indians and restored to their rightful owners,\nwithout asking any recompense whatever....",
        "“What right have we to tell any people, ’You shall not cross the\nMississippi River on any pretext whatever’? When the Sauk and Fox\nIndians wish to cross the Mississippi, to visit their relations among\nthe Pottowattamies of Fox River, Illinois, they are prevented by us,\nbecause we have the power!”",
        "I omit the old gentleman’s occasional comments upon the powers that\ndictated, and the forces which carried on, the warfare of this unhappy\nsummer. There is every reason to believe that had his suggestions been\nlistened to, and had he continued the Agent of the Sauks and Foxes, a\nsad record might have been spared,–we should assuredly not have been\ncalled to chronicle the untimely fate of his successor, the unfortunate\nM. St. Vrain, who, a comparative stranger to his people, was murdered by\nthem, in their exasperated fury, at Kellogg’s Grove, soon after the\ncommencement of the campaign.",
        "It seems appropriate to notice in this place the subsequent appearance\nbefore the public of one of the personages casually mentioned in the\nforegoing narrative.",
        "In the autumn of 1864 we saw advertised for exhibition at Wood’s Museum,\nChicago, “The most remarkable instance of longevity on record–the\nvenerable Joseph Crély, born on the 13th of September, 1726, and having\nconsequently reached, at this date, the age of ONE HUNDRED AND\nTHIRTY-NINE YEARS!” Sundry particulars followed of his life and history,\nand, above all, of his recollections.",
        "“Well done for old Crély!” said my husband, when he had gone through the\nlong array. “Come, let us go over to Wood’s Museum and renew our\nacquaintance with the venerable gentleman.”",
        "I did not need a second invitation, for I was curious to witness the\nwonders which the whirligig of time had wrought with our old employé.",
        "We chose an early hour for our visit, that we might pay our respects to\nboth him and the granddaughter who had him in charge, unembarrassed by\nthe presence of strangers.",
        "In a large room on the second floor of the building, among cages of\nbirds and animals, some stuffed, others still living, we perceived,\nseated by a window, a figure clad in bright cashmere dressing-gown and\ngay tasselled cap, tranquilly smoking a tah-nee-hoo-rah, or long Indian\npipe. His form was upright, his face florid, and less changed than might\nhave been expected by the thirty-one years that had elapsed since we had\nlast seen him. He was alone, and my husband addressed him at first in\nEnglish:–",
        "“Good-morning, M. Crély. Do you remember me?”",
        "He shook his head emphatically. “Je ne comprends pas. Je ne me\nressouviens de rien–je suis vieux, vieux–le treize Septembre, mil sept\ncent vingt-six, je suis né. Non, non,” with a few gentle shakes of the\nhead, “je ne puis rappeler rien–je suis vieux, vieux.\"[61]",
        "My husband changed his inquiries to the patois which Crély could not\nfeign not to comprehend.",
        "“Where is your granddaughter? I am acquainted with her, and would like\nto speak with her.”",
        "The old man sprang up with the greatest alacrity, and, running to a door\nin the wooden partition which cut off a corner of the room and thus\nfurnished an apartment for the ancient phenomenon, he rapped vigorously,\nand called, in accents quite unlike his former feeble, drawling tones,–",
        "“Thérèse, Thérèse–il y a icite un monsieur qui voudrait vous voir.\"[62]",
        "The granddaughter presently made her appearance. She looked shyly at my\nhusband from under her brows.",
        "“Do you know me, Thérèse?” he asked.",
        "“Yes, sir. It is Mr. Kinzie.”",
        "“And do you know me also?” I said, approaching. She looked at me and\nshook her head.",
        "“No, I do not,” she replied.",
        "“What, Thérèse! Have you forgotten Madame John, who taught you to\nread–you and all the little girls at the Portage?”",
        "“Oh, my heavens, Mrs. Kinzie!–but you have changed so!”",
        "“Yes, Thérèse, I have grown old in all these years; but I have not grown\nold quite so fast as your grandpapa here.”",
        "There was a flash in her eye that told she felt my meaning. She hung\nher head without speaking, while the color deepened over her\ncountenance.",
        "“Now,” said I, in French, to the grandfather, “you remember me–”",
        "He interrupted me with a protest, “Non, non–je ne puis rappeler\nrien–je suis vieux, vieux–le treize Septembre, mil sept cent\nvingt-six, je suis né à Detroit.”",
        "“And you recollect,” I went on, not heeding his formula, “how I came to\nthe Portage a bride, and lived in the old cabins that the soldiers had\noccupied–”",
        "“Eh b’an! oui–oui–”",
        "“And how you helped make the garden for me–and how Plante and Manaigre\nfinished the new house so nicely while Monsieur John was away for the\nsilver–and how there was a feast after it was completed–”",
        "“Ah! oui, oui–pour le sûr.”",
        "“And where are all our people now?” I asked, turning to Thérèse. “Louis\nFrum dit Manaigre–is he living?”",
        "“Oh, Madame Kinzie! You remember that–Manaigre having two names?”",
        "“Yes, Thérèse–I remember everything connected with those old times at\nthe Portage. Who among our people there are living?”",
        "“Only Manaigre is left,” she said.",
        "“Mais, mais, Thérèse,” interposed the old man, “Manaigre’s daughter\nGeneviève is living.” It was a comfort to find our visit of such\nmiraculous benefit to his memory.",
        "“And the Puans–are any of them left?” I asked.",
        "“Not more than ten or twelve, I think–” Again her grandfather promptly\ncontradicted her:–",
        "“Mais, mais, je compte b’an qu’il y en a quinze ou seize, Thérèse;” and\nhe went quite glibly over the names of such of his red friends as still\nhovered around their old home in that vicinity.",
        "He was in the full tide of gay reminiscence, touching upon experiences\nand adventures of long ago, and recalling Indian and half-breed\nacquaintances of former days, when footsteps approached, and the\nentrance of eager, curious visitors suddenly reminded him of his\nappointed rôle. It was marvellous how instantaneously he subsided into\nthe superannuated driveller who was to bear away the bell from Old Parr\nand all the Emperor Alexander’s far-sought fossils.",
        "“Je suis vieux, vieux–l’an mil sept cent vingt-six–le treize\nSeptembre, à Detroit–- je ne puis rappeler rien.”",
        "Not another phrase could “all the King’s armies, or all the King’s men,\"\nhave extorted from him.",
        "So we left him to the admiring comments of the new-comers. I think it\nshould be added, in extenuation of what would otherwise seem a gross\nimposture, that his granddaughter was really ignorant of Crély’s exact\nage–that he, being ever a gasconading fellow, was quite ready to\npersonate that certain Joseph Crély whose name appears on the baptismal\nrecords of the Church in Detroit of the year 1726. He was, moreover,\npleased with the idea of being gaily dressed and going on a tour to see\nthe world, and doubtless rejoiced, also, in the prospect of relieving\nhis poor granddaughter of a part of the burden of his maintenance. He\nwas probably at this time about ninety-five years of age. There are\nthose that knew him from 1830, who maintain that his age was a few years\nless; but I take the estimate of Mr. Kinzie and H.L. Dousman, of Prairie\ndu Chien, who set him down, in 1864, at about the age I have assigned to\nhim.",
