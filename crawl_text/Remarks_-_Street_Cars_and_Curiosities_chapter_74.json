        "There is an institution in Boston which the Pilgrim Fathers did not\noriginate. That is the street car. There is a street car parade all day\non Washington street, and a red-light procession most of the night.",
        "People told me that I could get into a car and go anywhere I wanted to. I\ntried it. There was a point in Boston, I learned, where there were some\nmore relics that I hadn’t seen. Parties told me where I could find some\nmore fragments of the Mayflower, and an old chair in which Josiah Quincy\nhad sat down to think. There were also a few more low price flint-lock\nguns and tomahawks that no man who visited Boston could afford to miss.\nBesides, there was said to be the lock that used to be on the door of a\nroom in which General Washington had a good notion to write his farewell\naddress. All these things were in the collection which I started out to\nfind, and there were others, also.",
        "For instance, there was a specimen of the lightning that Franklin caught\nin his demijohn out of the sky, and still in a good state of preservation;\nalso some more clothes in which he was baptized, more swords of Bunker\nHill, and a little shirt which John Hancock put on as soon as he was born.\nHancock was a perfect gentleman from his birth, and it is said that the\nfirst thing he did was to excuse himself for a moment and then put on this\nshirt. His manners were certainly very agreeable, and he was very much\npolished.",
        "I heard, too, that there was an acorn from the tree in which Benedict\nArnold had his nest while he was hatching treason. I did not believe it,\nbut I had an idea I could readily discover the fraud if I could only see\nthe acorn, for I am a great historian and researcher from away back. I was\ntold that in this collection there was a suspender button shed by Patrick\nHenry during his memorable speech in which he raised up to his full height\non his hind feet and permitted the war to come in italics, also in SMALL\nCAPS and in LARGE CAPS!!! with three astonishers on the end.",
        "So I wanted to find this place, and as I had plenty of means I decided to\nride in a street car. Therefore, I aimed my panic price cane at the driver\nof a cream-colored car with a blue stomach, and remarked, “Hi, there!\"\nBefore I go any further, and in order to avoid ambiguity, let me say that\nit was the car that had the blue stomach. He (the driver) twisted the\nbrake and I went inside, clear to the further end, and sat down by the\nside of a young woman who filled the whole car with sunshine. I was so\nhappy that I gave the conductor half a dollar and told him to keep the\nchange. If by chance she sees this, I hope she still remembers me. Pretty\nsoon a very fat woman came into the car and aimed for our quarter. She\nevidently intended to squat between this fair girl and myself. But ah,\nthought I to myself in a low tone of voice, I will fool thee. So I shoved\nmy person along in the seat toward the sweet girl of the Bay State. The\ncorpulent party, whose name I did not learn, had in the meantime backed up\nto where she had detected a slight vacancy, and where I had seen fit to\nplace myself. At that moment she heaved a sigh of relief, and, assisted by\nthe motion of the car, which just then turned a corner, she sat down in my\nlap and nestled in my bosom like a tired baby elephant.",
        "Dear reader, if I were to tell you that the crystal of my watch was picked\nout from under my shoulder blades the next day, you would not believe it,\nwould you? I will not strain your faith in me by making the statement, but\nthat was the heaviest woman I ever held.",
        "While all this was going on I lost track of my location. The car began to\nsquirm around all over Boston, and finally the conductor came back and\nwanted more money. I said no, I would get off and try a dark red car with\na green stomach for a while. So I did I rode on that till I had seen a\ngreat deal of new scenery, and then I asked the conductor if he passed\nNumber Clankety Clank, Blank street. He said he did not, but if I would go\ndown two blocks further and take a maroon car with a plaid stomach it\nwould take me to the corner of “What-do-you-call-it and What’s-his-name\nstreets,” where, if I took a seal brown car with squshed huckleberry\ntrimmings it would take me to where I wanted to go. So I tried it. I do\nnot know just where I missed my train, but when I found the seal brown car\nwith scrunched huckleberry trimmings it was going the other way, and as it\nwas late I went into a cafe and refreshed myself. When I came out I\ndiscovered that it was too late to see the collection, even if I could\nfind it, for at 6 o’clock they take the relics in and put them into a\nrefrigerator till morning.",
        "I was now weary and somewhat disappointed, so I desired to get back to my\nheadquarters, wherein I could rest and where I could lock myself up in my\nroom, so no prize fat woman could enter. I hailed one of those sawed-off\nlandaus, consisting of two wheels, one door behind, and a bill for two\nbits. I told the college graduate on the box where I wanted to go, gave\nhim a quarter and got in. I sat down and heaved a chaste sigh. The sigh\nwas only half hove when the herdic backed up to my destination, which was\nabout 300 feet from where I got in, as the crow flies.",
        "When I go to Boston again, I am going in charge of the police.",
        "The street railway system of Boston is remarkably perfect. Fifty cars pass\na given point on Washington street in an hour, and yet there are no\nblockades. You can take one of those cars, if you are a stranger, and you\ncan get so mixed up that you will never get back, and all for five cents.\nI felt a good deal like the man who was full and who stepped on a man who\nwas not full. The sober man was mad, and yelled out: “See here; condemn\nit, can’t you look where you’re walking?” “Betcher life,” says the\ninebriate, “but trouble is to walk where I’m lookin’.”",
