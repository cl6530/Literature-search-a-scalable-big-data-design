        "The Shee an Gannon was born in the morning, named at noon, and went\nin the evening to ask his daughter of the king of Erin.",
        "“I will give you my daughter in marriage,” said the king of Erin;\n“you won’t get her, though, unless you go and bring me back the\ntidings that I want, and tell me what it is that put a stop to the\nlaughing of the Gruagach Gaire, who before this laughed always, and\nlaughed so loud that the whole world heard him. There are twelve\niron spikes out here in the garden behind my castle. On eleven of\nthe spikes are the heads of kings’ sons who came seeking my\ndaughter in marriage, and all of them went away to get the knowledge\nI wanted. Not one was able to get it and tell me what stopped the\nGruagach Gaire from laughing. I took the heads off them all when\nthey came back without the tidings for which they went, and I’m\ngreatly in dread that your head’ll be on the twelfth spike, for I’ll\ndo the same to you that I did to the eleven kings’ sons unless you\ntell what put a stop to the laughing of the Gruagach.”",
        "The Shee an Gannon made no answer, but left the king and pushed away\nto know could he find why the Gruagach was silent.",
        "He took a glen at a step, a hill at a leap, and travelled all day\ntill evening. Then he came to a house. The master of the house asked\nhim what sort was he, and he said: “A young man looking for hire.”",
        "“Well,” said the master of the house, “I was going tomorrow to look\nfor a man to mind my cows. If you’ll work for me, you’ll have a good\nplace, the best food a man could have to eat in this world, and a\nsoft bed to lie on.”",
        "The Shee an Gannon took service, and ate his supper. Then the master\nof the house said: “I am the Gruagach Gaire; now that you are my man\nand have eaten your supper, you’ll have a bed of silk to sleep on.”",
        "Next morning after breakfast the Gruagach said to the Shee an\nGannon: “Go out now and loosen my five golden cows and my bull\nwithout horns, and drive them to pasture; but when you have them out\non the grass, be careful you don’t let them go near the land of the\ngiant.”",
        "The new cowboy drove the cattle to pasture, and when near the land\nof the giant, he saw it was covered with woods and surrounded by a\nhigh wall. He went up, put his back against the wall, and threw in a\ngreat stretch of it; then he went inside and threw out another great\nstretch of the wall, and put the five golden cows and the bull\nwithout horns on the land of the giant.",
        "Then he climbed a tree, ate the sweet apples himself, and threw the\nsour ones down to the cattle of the Gruagach Gaire.",
        "Soon a great crashing was heard in the woods,–the noise of young\ntrees bending, and old trees breaking. The cowboy looked around and\nsaw a five-headed giant pushing through the trees; and soon he was\nbefore him.",
        "“Poor miserable creature!” said the giant; “but weren’t you impudent\nto come to my land and trouble me in this way? You’re too big for\none bite, and too small for two. I don’t know what to do but tear\nyou to pieces.”",
        "“You nasty brute,” said the cowboy, coming down to him from the\ntree, “’tis little I care for you;” and then they went at each\nother. So great was the noise between them that there was nothing in\nthe world but what was looking on and listening to the combat.",
        "They fought till late in the afternoon, when the giant was getting\nthe upper hand; and then the cowboy thought that if the giant should\nkill him, his father and mother would never find him or set eyes on\nhim again, and he would never get the daughter of the king of Erin.\nThe heart in his body grew strong at this thought. He sprang on the\ngiant, and with the first squeeze and thrust he put him to his knees\nin the hard ground, with the second thrust to his waist, and with\nthe third to his shoulders.",
        "“I have you at last; you’re done for now!”, said the cowboy. Then he\ntook out his knife, cut the five heads off the giant, and when he\nhad them off he cut out the tongues and threw the heads over the\nwall.",
        "Then he put the tongues in his pocket and drove home the cattle.\nThat evening the Gruagach couldn’t find vessels enough in all his\nplace to hold the milk of the five golden cows.",
        "But when the cowboy was on the way home with the cattle, the son of\nthe king of Tisean came and took the giant’s heads and claimed the\nprincess in marriage when the Gruagach Gaire should laugh.",
        "After supper the cowboy would give no talk to his master, but kept\nhis mind to himself, and went to the bed of silk to sleep.",
        "On the morning the cowboy rose before his master, and the first\nwords he said to the Gruagach were:",
        "“What keeps you from laughing, you who used to laugh so loud that\nthe whole world heard you?”",
        "“I’m sorry,” said the Gruagach, “that the daughter of the king of\nErin sent you here.”",
        "“If you don’t tell me of your own will, I’ll make you tell me,” said\nthe cowboy; and he put a face on himself that was terrible to look\nat, and running through the house like a madman, could find nothing\nthat would give pain enough to the Gruagach but some ropes made of\nuntanned sheepskin hanging on the wall.",
        "He took these down, caught the Gruagach, fastened him by the three\nsmalls, and tied him so that his little toes were whispering to his\nears. When he was in this state the Gruagach said: “I’ll tell you\nwhat stopped my laughing if you set me free.”",
        "So the cowboy unbound him, the two sat down together, and the\nGruagach said:–",
        "“I lived in this castle here with my twelve sons. We ate, drank,\nplayed cards, and enjoyed ourselves, till one day when my sons and I\nwere playing, a slender brown hare came rushing in, jumped on to the\nhearth, tossed up the ashes to the rafters and ran away.",
        "“On another day he came again; but if he did, we were ready for him,\nmy twelve sons and myself. As soon as he tossed up the ashes and ran\noff, we made after him, and followed him till nightfall, when he\nwent into a glen. We saw a light before us. I ran on, and came to a\nhouse with a great apartment, where there was a man named Yellow\nFace with twelve daughters, and the hare was tied to the side of the\nroom near the women.",
        "“There was a large pot over the fire in the room, and a great stork\nboiling in the pot. The man of the house said to me: ’There are\nbundles of rushes at the end of the room, go there and sit down with\nyour men!’",
        "“He went into the next room and brought out two pikes, one of wood,\nthe other of iron, and asked me which of the pikes would I take. I\nsaid, ’I’ll take the iron one;’ for I thought in my heart that if an\nattack should come on me, I could defend myself better with the iron\nthan the wooden pike.",
        "“Yellow Face gave me the iron pike, and the first chance of taking\nwhat I could out of the pot on the point of the pike. I got but a\nsmall piece of the stork, and the man of the house took all the rest\non his wooden pike. We had to fast that night; and when the man and\nhis twelve daughters ate the flesh of the stork, they hurled the\nbare bones in the faces of my sons and myself. We had to stop all\nnight that way, beaten on the faces by the bones of the stork.",
        "“Next morning, when we were going away, the man of the house asked\nme to stay a while; and going into the next room, he brought out\ntwelve loops of iron and one of wood, and said to me: ’Put the heads\nof your twelve sons into the iron loops, or your own head into the\nwooden one;’ and I said: ’I’ll put the twelve heads of my sons in\nthe iron loops, and keep my own out of the wooden one.’",
        "“He put the iron loops on the necks of my twelve sons, and put the\nwooden one on his own neck. Then he snapped the loops one after\nanother, till he took the heads off my twelve sons and threw the\nheads and bodies out of the house; but he did nothing to hurt his\nown neck.",
        "“When he had killed my sons he took hold of me and stripped the skin\nand flesh from the small of my back down, and when he had done that\nhe took the skin of a black sheep that had been hanging on the wall\nfor seven years and clapped it on my body in place of my own flesh\nand skin; and the sheepskin grew on me, and every year since then I\nshear myself, and every bit of wool I use for the stockings that I\nwear I clip off my own back.”",
        "When he had said this, the Gruagach showed the cowboy his back\ncovered with thick black wool.",
        "After what he had seen and heard, the cowboy said: “I know now why\nyou don’t laugh, and small blame to you. But does that hare come\nhere still?”",
        "“He does indeed,” said the Gruagach.",
        "Both went to the table to play, and they were not long playing cards\nwhen the hare ran in; and before they could stop him he was out\nagain.",
        "But the cowboy made after the hare, and the Gruagach after the\ncowboy, and they ran as fast as ever their legs could carry them\ntill nightfall; and when the hare was entering the castle where the\ntwelve sons of the Gruagach were killed, the cowboy caught him by\nthe two hind legs and dashed out his brains against the wall; and\nthe skull of the hare was knocked into the chief room of the castle,\nand fell at the feet of the master of the place.",
        "“Who has dared to interfere with my fighting pet?” screamed Yellow\nFace.",
        "“I,” said the cowboy; “and if your pet had had manners, he might be\nalive now.”",
        "The cowboy and the Gruagach stood by the fire. A stork was boiling\nin the pot, as when the Gruagach came the first time. The master of\nthe house went into the next room and brought out an iron and a\nwooden pike, and asked the cowboy which would he choose.",
        "“I’ll take the wooden one,” said the cowboy; “and you may keep the\niron one for yourself.”",
        "So he took the wooden one; and going to the pot, brought out on the\npike all the stork except a small bite, and he and the Gruagach fell\nto eating, and they were eating the flesh of the stork all night.\nThe cowboy and the Gruagach were at home in the place that time.",
        "In the morning the master of the house went into the next room, took\ndown the twelve iron loops with a wooden one, brought them out, and\nasked the cowboy which would he take, the twelve iron or the one\nwooden loop.",
        "“What could I do with the twelve iron ones for myself or my master?\nI’ll take the wooden one.”",
        "He put it on, and taking the twelve iron loops, put them on the\nnecks of the twelve daughters of the house, then snapped the twelve\nheads off them, and turning to their father, said: “I’ll do the same\nthing to you unless you bring the twelve sons of my master to life,\nand make them as well and strong as when you took their heads.”",
        "The master of the house went out and brought the twelve to life\nagain; and when the Gruagach saw all his sons alive and as well as\never, he let a laugh out of himself, and all the Eastern world heard\nthe laugh.",
        "Then the cowboy said to the Gruagach: “It’s a bad thing you have\ndone to me, for the daughter of the king of Erin will be married the\nday after your laugh is heard.”",
        "“Oh! then we must be there in time,” said the Gruagach; and they all\nmade away from the place as fast as ever they could, the cowboy, the\nGruagach, and his twelve sons.",
        "They hurried on; and when within three miles of the king’s castle\nthere was such a throng of people that no one could go a step ahead.\n“We must clear a road through this,” said the cowboy.",
        "“We must indeed,” said the Gruagach; and at it they went, threw the\npeople some on one side and some on the other, and soon they had an\nopening for themselves to the king’s castle.",
        "As they went in, the daughter of the king of Erin and the son of the\nking of Tisean were on their knees just going to be married. The\ncowboy drew his hand on the bride-groom, and gave a blow that sent\nhim spinning till he stopped under a table at the other side of the\nroom.",
        "“What scoundrel struck that blow?” asked the king of Erin.",
        "“It was I,” said the cowboy.",
        "“What reason had you to strike the man who won my daughter?”",
        "“It was I who won your daughter, not he; and if you don’t believe\nme, the Gruagach Gaire is here himself. He’ll tell you the whole\nstory from beginning to end, and show you the tongues of the giant.”",
        "So the Gruagach came up and told the king the whole story, how the\nShee an Gannon had become his cowboy, had guarded the five golden\ncows and the bull without horns, cut off the heads of the five-\nheaded giant, killed the wizard hare, and brought his own twelve\nsons to life. “And then,” said the Gruagach, “he is the only man in\nthe whole world I have ever told why I stopped laughing, and the\nonly one who has ever seen my fleece of wool.”",
        "When the king of Erin heard what the Gruagach said, and saw the\ntongues of the giant fitted in the head, he made the Shee an Gannon\nkneel down by his daughter, and they were married on the spot.",
        "Then the son of the king of Tisean was thrown into prison, and the\nnext day they put down a great fire, and the deceiver was burned to\nashes.",
        "The wedding lasted nine days, and the last day was better than the\nfirst.",
