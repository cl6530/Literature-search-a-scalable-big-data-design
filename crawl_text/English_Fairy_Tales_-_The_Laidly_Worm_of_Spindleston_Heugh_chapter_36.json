        "In Bamborough Castle once lived a king who had a fair wife and two\nchildren, a son named Childe Wynd and a daughter named Margaret.\nChilde Wynd went forth to seek his fortune, and soon after he had gone\nthe queen his mother died. The king mourned her long and faithfully,\nbut one day while he was hunting he came across a lady of great\nbeauty, and became so much in love with her that he determined to\nmarry her. So he sent word home that he was going to bring a new queen\nto Bamborough Castle.",
        "Princess Margaret was not very glad to hear of her mother’s place\nbeing taken, but she did not repine but did her father’s bidding. And\nat the appointed day came down to the castle gate with the keys all\nready to hand over to her stepmother. Soon the procession drew near,\nand the new queen came towards Princess Margaret who bowed low and\nhanded her the keys of the castle. She stood there with blushing\ncheeks and eye on ground, and said: “O welcome, father dear, to your\nhalls and bowers, and welcome to you my new mother, for all that’s\nhere is yours,” and again she offered the keys. One of the king’s\nknights who had escorted the new queen, cried out in admiration:\n“Surely this northern Princess is the loveliest of her kind.” At that\nthe new queen flushed up and cried out: “At least your courtesy might\nhave excepted me,” and then she muttered below her breath: “I’ll soon\nput an end to her beauty.”",
        "That same night the queen, who was a noted witch, stole down to a\nlonely dungeon wherein she did her magic and with spells three times\nthree, and with passes nine times nine she cast Princess Margaret\nunder her spell. And this was her spell:",
        "  I weird ye to be a Laidly Worm,\n    And borrowed shall ye never be,\n  Until Childe Wynd, the King’s own son\n    Come to the Heugh and thrice kiss thee;\n  Until the world comes to an end,\n    Borrowed shall ye never be.",
        "So Lady Margaret went to bed a beauteous maiden, and rose up a Laidly\nWorm. And when her maidens came in to dress her in the morning they\nfound coiled up on the bed a dreadful dragon, which uncoiled itself\nand came towards them. But they ran away shrieking, and the Laidly\nWorm crawled and crept, and crept and crawled till it reached the\nHeugh or rock of the Spindlestone, round which it coiled itself, and\nlay there basking with its terrible snout in the air.",
        "Soon the country round about had reason to know of the Laidly Worm of\nSpindleston Heugh. For hunger drove the monster out from its cave and\nit used to devour everything it could come across. So at last they\nwent to a mighty warlock and asked him what they should do. Then he\nconsulted his works and his familiar, and told them: “The Laidly Worm\nis really the Princess Margaret and it is hunger that drives her forth\nto do such deeds. Put aside for her seven kine, and each day as the\nsun goes down, carry every drop of milk they yield to the stone trough\nat the foot of the Heugh, and the Laidly Worm will trouble the country\nno longer. But if ye would that she be borrowed to her natural shape,\nand that she who bespelled her be rightly punished, send over the seas\nfor her brother, Childe Wynd.”",
        "All was done as the warlock advised, the Laidly Worm lived on the milk\nof the seven kine, and the country was troubled no longer. But when\nChilde Wynd heard the news, he swore a mighty oath to rescue his\nsister and revenge her on her cruel stepmother. And three-and-thirty\nof his men took the oath with him. Then they set to work and built a\nlong ship, and its keel they made of the rowan tree. And when all was\nready, they out with their oars and pulled sheer for Bamborough Keep.",
        "But as they got near the keep, the stepmother felt by her magic power\nthat something was being wrought against her, so she summoned her\nfamiliar imps and said: “Childe Wynd is coming over the seas; he must\nnever land. Raise storms, or bore the hull, but nohow must he touch\nshore.” Then the imps went forth to meet Childe Wynd’s ship, but when\nthey got near, they found they had no power over the ship, for its\nkeel was made of the rowan tree. So back they came to the queen witch,\nwho knew not what to do. She ordered her men-at-arms to resist Childe\nWynd if he should land near them, and by her spells she caused the\nLaidly Worm to wait by the entrance of the harbour.",
        "As the ship came near, the Worm unfolded its coils, and dipping into\nthe sea, caught hold of the ship of Childe Wynd, and banged it off the\nshore. Three times Childe Wynd urged his men on to row bravely and\nstrong, but each time the Laidly Worm kept it off the shore. Then\nChilde Wynd ordered the ship to be put about, and the witch-queen\nthought he had given up the attempt. But instead of that, he only\nrounded the next point and landed safe and sound in Budle Creek, and\nthen, with sword drawn and bow bent, rushed up followed by his men, to\nfight the terrible Worm that had kept him from landing.",
        "But the moment Childe Wynd had landed, the witch-queen’s power over\nthe Laidly Worm had gone, and she went back to her bower all alone,\nnot an imp, nor a man-at-arms to help her, for she knew her hour was\ncome. So when Childe Wynd came rushing up to the Laidly Worm it made\nno attempt to stop him or hurt him, but just as he was going to raise\nhis sword to slay it, the voice of his own sister Margaret came from\nits jaws saying:",
        "  “O, quit your sword, unbend your bow,\n    And give me kisses three;\n  For though I am a poisonous worm,\n    No harm I’ll do to thee.”",
        "Childe Wynd stayed his hand, but he did not know what to think if some\nwitchery were not in it. Then said the Laidly Worm again:",
        "  “O, quit your sword, unbend your bow,\n    And give me kisses three,\n  If I’m not won ere set of sun,\n    Won never shall I be.”",
        "Then Childe Wynd went up to the Laidly Worm and kissed it once; but no\nchange came over it. Then Childe Wynd kissed it once more; but yet no\nchange came over it. For a third time he kissed the loathsome thing,\nand with a hiss and a roar the Laidly Worm reared back and before\nChilde Wynd stood his sister Margaret. He wrapped his cloak about her,\nand then went up to the castle with her. When he reached the keep, he\nwent off to the witch queen’s bower, and when he saw her, he touched\nher with a twig of a rowan tree. No sooner had he touched her than she\nshrivelled up and shrivelled up, till she became a huge ugly toad,\nwith bold staring eyes and a horrible hiss. She croaked and she\nhissed, and then hopped away down the castle steps, and Childe Wynd\ntook his father’s place as king, and they all lived happy afterwards.",
        "But to this day, the loathsome toad is seen at times, haunting the\nneighbourhood of Bamborough Keep, and the wicked witch-queen is a\nLaidly Toad.",
