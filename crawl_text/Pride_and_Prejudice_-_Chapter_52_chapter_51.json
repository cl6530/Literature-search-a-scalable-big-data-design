        "Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her\nletter as soon as she possibly could.  She was no sooner in\npossession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where\nshe was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of\nthe benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the\nletter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.",
        "“Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.",
        "“My Dear Niece,",
        "“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\nmorning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing\nwill not comprise what I have to tell you.  I must confess\nmyself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from\nyou.  Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let\nyou know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary\non your side.  If you do not choose to understand me, forgive\nmy impertinence.  Your uncle is as much surprised as I am–and\nnothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would\nhave allowed him to act as he has done.  But if you are really\ninnocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.",
        "“On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a\nmost unexpected visitor.  Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him\nseveral hours.  It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was\nnot so dreadfully racked as your’s seems to have been.  He came to\ntell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and\nMr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both;\nWickham repeatedly, Lydia once.  From what I can collect, he left\nDerbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the\nresolution of hunting for them.  The motive professed was his\nconviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham’s worthlessness\nhad not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young\nwoman of character to love or confide in him.  He generously imputed\nthe whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before\nthought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world.\nHis character was to speak for itself.  He called it, therefore, his\nduty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been\nbrought on by himself.  If he had another motive, I am sure it would\nnever disgrace him.  He had been some days in town, before he was able\nto discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\nmore than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for\nhis resolving to follow us.",
        "“There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago\ngoverness to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some\ncause of disapprobation, though he did not say what.  She then took a\nlarge house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by\nletting lodgings.  This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately\nacquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as\nsoon as he got to town.  But it was two or three days before he could\nget from her what he wanted.  She would not betray her trust, I\nsuppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where\nher friend was to be found.  Wickham indeed had gone to her on their\nfirst arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into\nher house, they would have taken up their abode with her.  At length,\nhowever, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction.  They were\nin –– street.  He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing\nLydia.  His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to\npersuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to\nher friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\noffering his assistance, as far as it would go.  But he found Lydia\nabsolutely resolved on remaining where she was.  She cared for none of\nher friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving\nWickham.  She was sure they should be married some time or other, and\nit did not much signify when.  Since such were her feelings, it only\nremained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his\nvery first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been\nhis design.  He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on\naccount of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and\nscrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia’s flight on her\nown folly alone.  He meant to resign his commission immediately; and\nas to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it.\nHe must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should\nhave nothing to live on.",
        "“Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.\nThough Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been\nable to do something for him, and his situation must have been\nbenefited by marriage.  But he found, in reply to this question, that\nWickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his\nfortune by marriage in some other country.  Under such circumstances,\nhowever, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of\nimmediate relief.",
        "“They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.\nWickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length\nwas reduced to be reasonable.",
        "“Every thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to\nmake your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\nstreet the evening before I came home.  But Mr. Gardiner could not be\nseen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was\nstill with him, but would quit town the next morning.  He did not\njudge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as\nyour uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the\ndeparture of the former.  He did not leave his name, and till the next\nday it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.",
        "“On Saturday he came again.  Your father was gone, your uncle at home,\nand, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.",
        "“They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too.  It was not all\nsettled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to\nLongbourn.  But our visitor was very obstinate.  I fancy, Lizzy, that\nobstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all.  He has been\naccused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one.\nNothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure\n(and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it),\nyour uncle would most readily have settled the whole.",
        "“They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either\nthe gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.  But at last your\nuncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use\nto his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable\ncredit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really\nbelieve your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it\nrequired an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers,\nand give the praise where it was due.  But, Lizzy, this must go no\nfarther than yourself, or Jane at most.",
        "“You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young\npeople.  His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to\nconsiderably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition\nto her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased.  The reason\nwhy all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given\nabove.  It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper\nconsideration, that Wickham’s character had been so misunderstood, and\nconsequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.  Perhaps\nthere was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or\nanybody’s reserve, can be answerable for the event.  But in spite of\nall this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured\nthat your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him\ncredit for another interest in the affair.",
        "“When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who\nwere still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be\nin London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters\nwere then to receive the last finish.",
        "“I believe I have now told you every thing.  It is a relation which you\ntell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not\nafford you any displeasure.  Lydia came to us; and Wickham had\nconstant admission to the house.  He was exactly what he had been,\nwhen I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little\nI was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had\nnot perceived, by Jane’s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on\ncoming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now\ntell you can give you no fresh pain.  I talked to her repeatedly in\nthe most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of\nwhat she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her\nfamily.  If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did\nnot listen.  I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my\ndear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.",
        "“Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,\nattended the wedding.  He dined with us the next day, and was to leave\ntown again on Wednesday or Thursday.  Will you be very angry with me,\nmy dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never\nbold enough to say before) how much I like him.  His behaviour to us\nhas, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\nHis understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a\nlittle more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife\nmay teach him.  I thought him very sly;–he hardly ever mentioned your\nname.  But slyness seems the fashion.",
        "“Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not\npunish me so far as to exclude me from P.  I shall never be quite\nhappy till I have been all round the park.  A low phaeton, with a nice\nlittle pair of ponies, would be the very thing.",
        "“But I must write no more.  The children have been wanting me this half\nhour.",
        "“Yours, very sincerely,",
        "“M. Gardiner.”",
        "The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter\nof spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether\npleasure or pain bore the greatest share.  The vague and\nunsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what\nMr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister’s match,\nwhich she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness\ntoo great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\njust, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their\ngreatest extent to be true!  He had followed them purposely to\ntown, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification\nattendant on such a research; in which supplication had been\nnecessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and\nwhere he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with,\npersuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished\nto avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\npronounce.  He had done all this for a girl whom he could\nneither regard nor esteem.  Her heart did whisper that he had\ndone it for her.  But it was a hope shortly checked by other\nconsiderations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was\ninsufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her\n–for a woman who had already refused him–as able to overcome\na sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with\nWickham.  Brother-in-law of Wickham!  Every kind of pride must\nrevolt from the connection.  He had, to be sure, done much.\nShe was ashamed to think how much.  But he had given a reason\nfor his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of\nbelief.  It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong;\nhe had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and\nthough she would not place herself as his principal inducement,\nshe could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her\nmight assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind\nmust be materially concerned.  It was painful, exceedingly\npainful, to know that they were under obligations to a person\nwho could never receive a return.  They owed the restoration of\nLydia, her character, every thing, to him.  Oh! how heartily\ndid she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever\nencouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.\nFor herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.  Proud\nthat in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get\nthe better of himself.  She read over her aunt’s commendation\nof him again and again.  It was hardly enough; but it pleased\nher.  She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with\nregret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had\nbeen persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between\nMr. Darcy and herself.",
        "She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some\none’s approach; and before she could strike into another path,\nshe was overtaken by Wickham.",
        "“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\"\nsaid he, as he joined her.",
        "“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not\nfollow that the interruption must be unwelcome.”",
        "“I should be sorry indeed, if it were.  We were always good\nfriends; and now we are better.”",
        "“True.  Are the others coming out?”",
        "“I do not know.  Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the\ncarriage to Meryton.  And so, my dear sister, I find, from\nour uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.”",
        "She replied in the affirmative.",
        "“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would\nbe too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to\nNewcastle.  And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?  Poor\nReynolds, she was always very fond of me.  But of course she\ndid not mention my name to you.”",
        "“Yes, she did.”",
        "“And what did she say?”",
        "“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had\n–not turned out well.  At such a distance as that, you\nknow, things are strangely misrepresented.”",
        "“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips.  Elizabeth hoped she\nhad silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:",
        "“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.  We passed\neach other several times.  I wonder what he can be doing\nthere.”",
        "“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said\nElizabeth.  “It must be something particular, to take him there\nat this time of year.”",
        "“Undoubtedly.  Did you see him while you were at Lambton?\nI thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.”",
        "“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”",
        "“And do you like her?”",
        "“Very much.”",
        "“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within\nthis year or two.  When I last saw her, she was not very\npromising.  I am very glad you liked her.  I hope she will turn\nout well.”",
        "“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”",
        "“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”",
        "“I do not recollect that we did.”",
        "“I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have\nhad.  A most delightful place!–Excellent Parsonage House!\nIt would have suited me in every respect.”",
        "“How should you have liked making sermons?”",
        "“Exceedingly well.  I should have considered it as part of my\nduty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.  One ought\nnot to repine;–but, to be sure, it would have been such a\nthing for me!  The quiet, the retirement of such a life would\nhave answered all my ideas of happiness!  But it was not to be.\nDid you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were\nin Kent?”",
        "“I have heard from authority, which I thought as good,\nthat it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the\npresent patron.”",
        "“You have.  Yes, there was something in that; I told you so\nfrom the first, you may remember.”",
        "“I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making\nwas not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that\nyou actually declared your resolution of never taking orders,\nand that the business had been compromised accordingly.”",
        "“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation.  You may\nremember what I told you on that point, when first we talked\nof it.”",
        "They were now almost at the door of the house, for she\nhad walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her\nsister’s sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with\na good-humoured smile:",
        "“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.\nDo not let us quarrel about the past.  In future, I hope we\nshall be always of one mind.”",
        "She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry,\nthough he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.",
