        "The little room where the new Pope sat reading was a model of\nsimplicity. Its walls were whitewashed, its roof unpolished rafters, and\nits floor beaten mud. A square table stood in the centre, with a chair\nbeside it; a cold brazier laid for lighting, stood in the wide hearth; a\nbookshelf against the wall held a dozen volumes. There were three doors,\none leading to the private oratory, one to the ante-room, and the third\nto the little paved court. The south windows were shuttered, but through\nthe ill-fitting hinges streamed knife-blades of fiery light from the hot\nEastern day outside.",
        "It was the time of the mid-day siesta, and except for the brisk scything\nof the cicade from the hill-slope behind the house, all was in deep\nsilence.",
        "The Pope, who had dined an hour before, had hardly shifted His attitude\nin all that time, so intent was He upon His reading. For the while, all\nwas put away, His own memory of those last three months, the bitter\nanxiety, the intolerable load of responsibility. The book He held was a\ncheap reprint of the famous biography of Julian Felsenburgh, issued a\nmonth before, and He was now drawing to an end.",
        "It was a terse, well-written book, composed by an unknown hand, and some\neven suspected it to be the disguised work of Felsenburgh himself. More,\nhowever, considered that it was written at least with Felsenburgh’s\nconsent by one of that small body of intimates whom he had admitted to\nhis society–that body which under him now conducted the affairs of West\nand East. From certain indications in the book it had been argued that\nits actual writer was a Westerner.",
        "The main body of the work dealt with his life, or rather with those two\nor three years known to the world, from his rapid rise in American\npolitics and his mediation in the East down to the event of five months\nago, when in swift succession he had been hailed Messiah in Damascus,\nhad been formally adored in London, and finally elected by an\nextraordinary majority to the Tribuniciate of the two Americas.",
        "The Pope had read rapidly through these objective facts, for He knew\nthem well enough already, and was now studying with close attention the\nsummary of his character, or rather, as the author rather sententiously\nexplained, the summary of his self-manifestation to the world. He read\nthe description of his two main characteristics, his grasp upon words\nand facts; “words, the daughters of earth, were wedded in this man to\nfacts, the sons of heaven, and Superman was their offspring.” His minor\ncharacteristics, too, were noticed, his appetite for literature, his\nastonishing memory, his linguistic powers. He possessed, it appeared,\nboth the telescopic and the microscopic eye–he discerned world-wide\ntendencies and movements on the one hand; he had a passionate capacity\nfor detail on the other. Various anecdotes illustrated these remarks,\nand a number of terse aphorisms of his were recorded. “No man forgives,\"\nhe said; “he only understands.” “It needs supreme faith to renounce a\ntranscendent God.” “A man who believes in himself is almost capable of\nbelieving in his neighbour.” Here was a sentence that to the Pope’s mind\nwas significant of that sublime egotism that is alone capable of\nconfronting the Christian spirit: and again, “To forgive a wrong is to\ncondone a crime,” and “The strong man is accessible to no one, but all\nare accessible to him.”",
        "There was a certain pompousness in this array of remarks, but it lay, as\nthe Pope saw very well, not in the speaker but in the scribe. To him who\nhad seen the speaker it was plain how they had been uttered–with no\npontifical solemnity, but whirled out in a fiery stream of eloquence, or\nspoken with that strangely moving simplicity that had constituted his\nfirst assault on London. It was possible to hate Felsenburgh, and to\nfear him; but never to be amused at him.",
        "But plainly the supreme pleasure of the writer was to trace the analogy\nbetween his hero and nature. In both there was the same apparent\ncontradictoriness–the combination of utter tenderness and utter\nruthlessness. “The power that heals wounds also inflicts them: that\nclothes the dungheap with sweet growths and grasses, breaks, too, into\nfire and earthquake; that causes the partridge to die for her young,\nalso makes the shrike with his living larder.” So, too, with\nFelsenburgh; He who had wept over the Fall of Rome, a month later had\nspoken of extermination as an instrument that even now might be\njudicially used in the service of humanity. Only it must be used with\ndeliberation, not with passion.",
        "The utterance had aroused extraordinary interest, since it seemed so\nparadoxical from one who preached peace and toleration; and argument\nhad broken out all over the world. But beyond enforcing the dispersal of\nthe Irish Catholics, and the execution of a few individuals, so far that\nutterance had not been acted upon. Yet the world seemed as a whole to\nhave accepted it, and even now to be waiting for its fulfilment.",
        "As the biographer pointed out, the world enclosed in physical nature\nshould welcome one who followed its precepts, one who was indeed the\nfirst to introduce deliberately and confessedly into human affairs such\nlaws as those of the Survival of the Fittest and the immorality of\nforgiveness. If there was mystery in the one, there was mystery in the\nother, and both must be accepted if man was to develop.",
        "And the secret of this, it seemed, lay in His personality. To see Him\nwas to believe in Him, or rather to accept Him as inevitably true. “We\ndo not explain nature or escape from it by sentimental regrets: the bare\ncries like a child, the wounded stag weeps great tears, the robin kills\nhis parents; life exists only on condition of death; and these things\nhappen however we may weave theories that explain nothing. Life must be\naccepted on those terms; we cannot be wrong if we follow nature; rather\nto accept them is to find peace–our great mother only reveals her\nsecrets to those who take her as she is.” So, too, with Felsenburgh. “It\nis not for us to discriminate: His personality is of a kind that does\nnot admit it. He is complete and sufficing for those who trust Him and\nare willing to suffer; an hostile and hateful enigma to those who are\nnot. We must prepare ourselves for the logical outcome of this doctrine.\nSentimentality must not be permitted to dominate reason.”",
        "Finally, then, the writer showed how to this Man belonged properly all\nthose titles hitherto lavished upon imagined Supreme Beings. It was in\npreparation for Him that these types came into the realms of thought and\ninfluenced men’s lives.",
        "He was the Creator, for it was reserved for Him to bring into being\nthe perfect life of union to which all the world had hitherto groaned in\nvain; it was in His own image and likeness that He had made man.",
        "Yet He was the Redeemer too, for that likeness had in one sense always\nunderlain the tumult of mistake and conflict. He had brought man out of\ndarkness and the shadow of death, guiding their feet into the way of\npeace. He was the Saviour for the same reason–the Son of Man, for\nHe alone was perfectly human; He was the Absolute, for He was the\ncontent of Ideals; the Eternal, for He had lain always in nature’s\npotentiality and secured by His being the continuity of that order; the\nInfinite, for all finite things fell short of Him who was more than\ntheir sum.",
        "He was Alpha, then, and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first\nand the last. He was Dominus et Deus noster (as Domitian had been, the\nPope reflected). He was as simple and as complex as life itself–simple\nin its essence, complex in its activities.",
        "And last of all, the supreme proof of His mission lay in the immortal\nnature of His message. There was no more to be added to what He had\nbrought to light–for in Him all diverging lines at last found their\norigin and their end. As to whether or no He would prove to be\npersonally immortal was an wholly irrelevant thought; it would be indeed\nfitting if through His means the vital principle should disclose its\nlast secret; but no more than fitting. Already His spirit was in the\nworld; the individual was no more separate from his fellows; death no\nmore than a wrinkle that came and went across the inviolable sea. For\nman had learned at last that the race was all and self was nothing; the\ncell had discovered the unity of the body; even, the greatest thinkers\ndeclared, the consciousness of the individual had yielded the title of\nPersonality to the corporate mass of man–and the restlessness of the\nunit had sunk into the peace of a common Humanity, for nothing but this\ncould explain the cessation of party strife and national\ncompetition–and this, above all, had been the work of Felsenburgh.",
        "“_Behold I am with you always,” quoted the writer in a passionate\nperoration, ’even now in the consummation of the world; and, the\nComforter is come unto you. I am the Door–the Way, the Truth and the\nLife–the Bread of Life and the Water of Life. My name is Wonderful, the\nPrince of Peace, the Father Everlasting. It is I who am the Desire of\nall nations, the fairest among the children of men–and of my Kingdom\nthere shall be no end.”",
        "The Pope laid down the book, and leaned back, closing his eyes.",
