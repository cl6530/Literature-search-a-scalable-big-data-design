        "One of my plans for the rainy season was to go to RUSTIC Farm which is\nin Thanem, a small village near Valpoi in the remote north-eastern\ndistrict of Sattari, so that I could gain some experience in farming.\nRUSTIC Farm holds a special attraction for me because I was born when\nmy parents lived on this farm and we stayed there till I was three\nyears old. Although I have no real recollection of that period, we have\nmany photographs of my baby days on the farm and many stories that my\nparents tell us of those times. We still visit the place at least once\na year and also maintain contact with several of the villagers who\nworked then on the farm. Yesu, our domestic help for the past 16 years\ncomes from that area. In 1985 RUSTIC Farm was sold to the present\nowners Shyam and Ujwala Achrekar. I had intended to stay with them for\na month and learn about farming first-hand. Unfortunately due to some\npersonal difficulties they could not have me visit them. It is one of\nthe few regrets I had during my one-year sabbatical. As things worked\nout, however, I was able to learn a few basics about farming in my own\nvillage at Parra.",
        "My neighbours, the Kandolkars, are a peasant family and during the\nrains they take to farming their own fields. They also do ploughing\nwork for others. Guru, the eldest son, has a fine pair of bullocks for\nthe purpose. It so happened that Guru was doing some masonry work at\nour house and I was chatting with him about my sabbatical when he\ncasually asked me whether I would like to come ploughing with him. I\njumped at the offer even as he seemed a bit surprised that I had so\nreadily agreed. Next morning I was woken up early and we set out for\nthe fields which are quite close to our homes.",
        "Holding the plough may appear a simple task but believe me it is not so\nand calls for quite a lot of skill and stamina. The trick is to keep\nthe plough in the centre and avoid cutting the hoofs of the animals at\nthe same time. One needs to put the right amount of pressure on the\nhandle as the plough should neither be too deep nor too shallow in the\nsoil. Also one has to constantly keep one’s eye on the bullocks to\ndirect them to turn around at the end of the field and to lift the\nplough when it reaches a bund. Lastly (and this is most important) the\nbullocks must recognise you or else they won’t take orders from you.",
        "The bullocks knew Guru very well but I was a stranger so Guru made me\nkeep shouting cries of “heeree heeree” which is how they get the\nanimals to move-so that they would at least begin to recognise my\nvoice. Although I went ploughing with Guru for several days in a row,\nhe never let me plough on my own because getting the right balance was\nstill very difficult for me and if any of the bullocks got hurt due to\nmy inexperience he would have to give the animal at least 15 days’ rest\nwhich would cost him heavily in earnings.",
        "After the ploughing is done the ground has to be levelled for seeding.\nThis is also done by the bullocks who drag a wooden piece shaped like a\nbroad fork across the field. This I was allowed to do on my own and I\nenjoyed it thoroughly. It was like having a nice ride, standing on the\nwooden leveller while the bullocks went up and down the field.",
        "I also tried my hand at spraying seeds and later fertilizer, on the\nfields. Sometimes I did a bit of weeding, to while away the time\nin-between ploughing. On some days when we were ploughing it used to\nrain heavily and I enjoyed working in the rain with all the other\nfarmers. After ploughing we would be treated to hot tea and bread or\npao baji by the owner of the field.",
        "I recall how surprised the owners of the fields we had ploughed would\nbe on seeing me sitting with the other workers-dirty with mud like\nthem-because naturally, they recognised me, since I am from the same\nvillage. One lady, in fact, thought I was playing truant. She told me\nshe was going to inform my mother where I was that Sunday morning. She\nthought that I ought to have been in church attending Mass instead.",
        "The field work was a good experience and one which I cherish. I helped\nGuru plough about half a dozen fields and even now when the rainy\nseason approaches I remember that experience with warmth and pleasure.",
