        "The story of American ships and sailors is an epic of blue water\nwhich seems singularly remote, almost unreal, to the later\ngenerations. A people with a native genius for seafaring won and\nheld a brilliant supremacy through two centuries and then forsook\nthis heritage of theirs. The period of achievement was no more\nextraordinary than was its swift declension. A maritime race\nwhose topsails flecked every ocean, whose captains courageous\nfrom father to son had fought with pike and cannonade to defend\nthe freedom of the seas, turned inland to seek a different\ndestiny and took no more thought for the tall ships and rich\ncargoes which had earned so much renown for its flag.",
        "Vanished fleets and brave memories--a chronicle of America which\nhad written its closing chapters before the Civil War! There will\nbe other Yankee merchantmen in times to come, but never days like\nthose when skippers sailed on seas uncharted in quest of ports\nmysterious and unknown.",
        "The Pilgrim Fathers, driven to the northward of their intended\ndestination in Virginia, landed on the shore of Cape Cod not so\nmuch to clear the forest and till the soil as to establish a\nfishing settlement. Like the other Englishmen who long before\n1620 had steered across to harvest the cod on the Grand Bank,\nthey expected to wrest a livelihood mostly from salt water. The\nconvincing argument in favor of Plymouth was that it offered a\ngood harbor for boats and was “a place of profitable fishing.\"\nBoth pious and amphibious were these pioneers whom the wilderness\nand the red Indian confined to the water’s edge, where they were\nsoon building ships to trade corn for beaver skins with the\nKennebec colony.",
        "Even more energetic in taking profit from the sea were the\nPuritans who came to Massachusetts Bay in 1629, bringing\ncarpenters and shipbuilders with them to hew the pine and oak so\nclose at hand into keelsons, frames, and planking. Two years\nlater, Governor John Winthrop launched his thirty-ton sloop\nBlessing of the Bay, and sent her to open “friendly commercial\nrelations” with the Dutch of Manhattan. Brisk though the traffic\nwas in furs and wampum, these mariners of Boston and Salem were\nnot content to voyage coastwise. Offshore fishing made skilled,\nadventurous seamen of them, and what they caught with hook and\nline, when dried and salted, was readily exchanged for other\nmerchandise in Bermuda, Barbados, and Europe.",
        "A vessel was a community venture, and the custom still survives\nin the ancient ports of the Maine coast where the shapely wooden\nschooners are fashioned. The blacksmith, the rigger, the calker,\ntook their pay in shares. They became part owners, as did\nlikewise the merchant who supplied stores and material; and when\nthe ship was afloat, the master, the mates, and even the seamen,\nwere allowed cargo space for commodities which they might buy and\nsell to their own advantage. Thus early they learned to trade as\nshrewdly as they navigated, and every voyage directly concerned a\nwhole neighborhood.",
        "This kind of enterprise was peculiar to New England because other\nresources were lacking. To the westward the French were more\ninterested in exploring the rivers leading to the region of the\nGreat Lakes and in finding fabulous rewards in furs. The Dutch on\nthe Hudson were similarly engaged by means of the western trails\nto the country of the Iroquois, while the planters of Virginia\nhad discovered an easy opulence in the tobacco crop, with slave\nlabor to toil for them, and they were not compelled to turn to\nthe hardships and the hazards of the sea. The New Englander,\nhampered by an unfriendly climate, hard put to it to grow\nsufficient food, with land immensely difficult to clear, was\nbetween the devil and the deep sea, and he sagaciously chose the\nlatter. Elsewhere in the colonies the forest was an enemy to be\ndestroyed with infinite pains. The New England pioneer regarded\nit with favor as the stuff with which to make stout ships and\nstep the straight masts in them.",
        "And so it befell that the seventeenth century had not run its\ncourse before New England was hardily afloat on every Atlantic\ntrade route, causing Sir Josiah Child, British merchant and\neconomist, to lament in 1668 that in his opinion nothing was\n\"more prejudicial and in prospect more dangerous to any mother\nkingdom than the increase of shipping in her colonies,\nplantations, or provinces.”",
        "This absorbing business of building wooden vessels was scattered\nin almost every bay and river of the indented coast from Nova\nScotia to Buzzard’s Bay and the sheltered waters of Long Island\nSound. It was not restricted, as now, to well-equipped yards with\ncrews of trained artisans. Hard by the huddled hamlet of log\nhouses was the row of keel-blocks sloping to the tide. In winter\nweather too rough for fishing, when the little farms lay idle,\nthis Yankee Jack-of-all-trades plied his axe and adze to shape\nthe timbers, and it was a routine task to peg together a sloop, a\nketch, or a brig, mere cockleshells, in which to fare forth to\nLondon, or Cadiz, or the Windward Islands--some of them not much\nlarger and far less seaworthy than the lifeboat which hangs at a\nliner’s davits. Pinching poverty forced him to dispense with the\nornate, top-heavy cabins and forecastles of the foreign\nmerchantmen, while invention, bred of necessity, molded finer\nlines and less clumsy models to weather the risks of a stormy\ncoast and channels beset with shoals and ledges. The square-rig\ndid well enough for deepwater voyages, but it was an awkward,\nlubberly contrivance for working along shore, and the colonial\nYankee therefore evolved the schooner with her flat fore-and-aft\nsails which enabled her to beat to windward and which required\nfewer men in the handling.",
        "Dimly but unmistakably these canny seafarers in their rude\nbeginnings foreshadowed the creation of a merchant marine which\nshould one day comprise the noblest, swiftest ships driven by the\nwind and the finest sailors that ever trod a deck. Even then\nthese early vessels were conspicuously efficient, carrying\nsmaller crews than the Dutch or English, paring expenses to a\ncloser margin, daring to go wherever commerce beckoned in order\nto gain a dollar at peril of their skins.",
        "By the end of the seventeenth century more than a thousand\nvessels were registered as built in the New England colonies, and\nSalem already displayed the peculiar talent for maritime\nadventure which was to make her the most illustrious port of the\nNew World. The first of her line of shipping merchants was Philip\nEnglish, who was sailing his own ketch Speedwell in 1676 and so\nrapidly advanced his fortunes that in a few years he was the\nrichest man on the coast, with twenty-one vessels which traded\ncoastwise with Virginia and offshore with Bilbao, Barbados, St.\nChristopher’s, and France. Very devout were his bills of lading,\nflavored in this manner: “Twenty hogsheads of salt, shipped by\nthe Grace of God in the good sloop called the Mayflower . . . .\nand by God’s Grace bound to Virginia or Merriland.”",
        "No less devout were the merchants who ordered their skippers to\ncross to the coast of Guinea and fill the hold with negroes to be\nsold in the West Indies before returning with sugar and molasses\nto Boston or Rhode Island. The slave-trade flourished from the\nvery birth of commerce in Puritan New England and its golden\ngains and exotic voyages allured high-hearted lads from farm and\ncounter. In 1640 the ship Desire, built at Marblehead, returned\nfrom the West Indies and “brought some cotton and tobacco and\nnegroes, etc. from thence.” Earlier than this the Dutch of\nManhattan had employed black labor, and it was provided that the\nIncorporated West India Company should “allot to each Patroon\ntwelve black men and women out of the Prizes in which Negroes\nshould be found.”",
        "It was in the South, however, that this kind of labor was most\nneeded and, as the trade increased, Virginia and the Carolinas\nbecame the most lucrative markets. Newport and Bristol drove a\nroaring traffic in “rum and niggers,” with a hundred sail to be\nfound in the infamous Middle Passage. The master of one of these\nRhode Island slavers, writing home from Guinea in 1736, portrayed\nthe congestion of the trade in this wise: “For never was there so\nmuch Rum on the Coast at one time before. Not ye like of ye\nFrench ships was never seen before, for ye whole coast is full of\nthem. For my part I can give no guess when I shall get away, for\nI purchast but 27 slaves since I have been here, for slaves is\nvery scarce. We have had nineteen Sail of us at one time in ye\nRoad, so that ships that used to carry pryme slaves off is now\nforced to take any that comes. Here is seven sail of us Rum men\nthat are ready to devour one another, for our case is desprit.”",
        "Two hundred years of wickedness unspeakable and human torture\nbeyond all computation, justified by Christian men and sanctioned\nby governments, at length rending the nation asunder in civil war\nand bequeathing a problem still unsolved--all this followed in\nthe wake of those first voyages in search of labor which could be\nbought and sold as merchandise. It belonged to the dark ages with\npiracy and witchcraft, better forgotten than recalled, save for\nits potent influence in schooling brave seamen and building\nfaster ships for peace and war.",
        "These colonial seamen, in truth, fought for survival amid dangers\nso manifold as to make their hardihood astounding. It was not\nmerely a matter of small vessels with a few men and boys daring\ndistant voyages and the mischances of foundering or stranding,\nbut of facing an incessant plague of privateers, French and\nSpanish, Dutch and English, or a swarm of freebooters under no\nflag at all. Coasts were unlighted, charts few and unreliable,\nand the instruments of navigation almost as crude as in the days\nof Columbus. Even the savage Indian, not content with lurking in\nambush, went afloat to wreak mischief, and the records of the\nFirst Church of Salem contain this quaint entry under date of\nJuly 25, 1677: “The Lord having given a Commission to the Indians\nto take no less than 13 of the Fishing Ketches of Salem and\nCaptivate the men . . . it struck a great consternation into all\nthe people here. The Pastor moved on the Lord’s Day, and the\nwhole people readily consented, to keep the Lecture Day following\nas a Fast Day, which was accordingly done . . . . The Lord was\npleased to send in some of the Ketches on the Fast Day which was\nlooked on as a gracious smile of Providence. Also there had been\n19 wounded men sent into Salem a little while before; also a\nKetch sent out from Salem as a man-of-war to recover the rest of\nthe Ketches. The Lord give them Good Success.”",
        "To encounter a pirate craft was an episode almost commonplace and\noften more sordid than picturesque. Many of these sea rogues were\nthieves with small stomach for cutlasses and slaughter. They were\nof the sort that overtook Captain John Shattuck sailing home from\nJamaica in 1718 when he reported his capture by one Captain\nCharles Vain, “a Pyrat” of 12 guns and 120 men who took him to\nCrooked Island, plundered him of various articles, stripped the\nbrig, abused the crew, and finally let him go. In the same year\nthe seamen of the Hopewell related that near Hispaniola they met\nwith pirates who robbed and ill-treated them and carried off\ntheir mate because they had no navigator.",
        "Ned Low, a gentleman rover of considerable notoriety, stooped to\nfilch the stores and gear from a fleet of fourteen poor fishermen\nof Cape Sable. He had a sense of dramatic values, however, and\nfrequently brandished his pistols on deck, besides which, as set\ndown by one of his prisoners, “he had a young child in Boston for\nwhom he entertained such tenderness that on every lucid interval\nfrom drinking and revelling, I have seen him sit down and weep\nplentifully.”",
        "A more satisfying figure was Thomas Pounds, who was taken by the\nsloop Mary, sent after him from Boston in 1689. He was discovered\nin Vineyard Sound, and the two vessels fought a gallant action,\nthe pirate flying a red flag and refusing to strike. Captain\nSamuel Pease of the Mary was mortally wounded, while Pounds, this\nproper pirate, strode his quarter-deck and waved his naked sword,\ncrying, “Come on board, ye dogs, and I will strike YOU\npresently.” This invitation was promptly accepted by the stout\nseamen from Boston, who thereupon swarmed over the bulwark and\ndrove all hands below, preserving Thomas Pounds to be hanged in\npublic.",
        "In 1703 John Quelch, a man of resource, hoisted what he called\n\"Old Roger” over the Charles--a brigantine which had been\nequipped as a privateer to cruise against the French of Acadia.\nThis curious flag of his was described as displaying a skeleton\nwith an hour-glass in one hand and “a dart in the heart with\nthree drops of blood proceeding from it in the other.” Quelch led\na mutiny, tossed the skipper overboard, and sailed for Brazil,\ncapturing several merchantmen on the way and looting them of rum,\nsilks, sugar, gold dust, and munitions. Rashly he came sailing\nback to Marblehead, primed with a plausible yarn, but his men\ntalked too much when drunk and all hands were jailed. Upon the\ngallows Quelch behaved exceedingly well, “pulling off his hat and\nbowing to the spectators,” while the somber Puritan merchants in\nthe crowd were, many of them, quietly dealing in the merchandise\nfetched home by pirates who were lucky enough to steer clear of\nthe law.",
        "This was a shady industry in which New York took the more active\npart, sending out supplies to the horde of pirates who ravaged\nthe waters of the Far East and made their haven at Madagascar,\nand disposing of the booty received in exchange. Governor\nFletcher had dirtied his hands by protecting this commerce and,\nas a result, Lord Bellomont was named to succeed him. Said\nWilliam III, “I send you, my Lord, to New York, because an honest\nand intrepid man is wanted to put these abuses down, and because\nI believe you to be such a man.”",
        "Such were the circumstances in which Captain William Kidd,\nrespectable master mariner in the merchant service, was employed\nby Lord Bellomont, royal Governor of New York, New Hampshire, and\nMassachusetts, to command an armed ship and harry the pirates of\nthe West Indies and Madagascar. Strangest of all the sea tales of\ncolonial history is that of Captain Kidd and his cruise in the\nAdventure-Galley. His name is reddened with crimes never\ncommitted, his grisly phantom has stalked through the legends\nand literature of piracy, and the Kidd tradition still has magic\nto set treasure-seekers exploring almost every beach, cove, and\nheadland from Halifax to the Gulf of Mexico. Yet if truth were\ntold, he never cut a throat or made a victim walk the plank. He\nwas tried and hanged for the trivial offense of breaking the head\nof a mutinous gunner of his own crew with a wooden bucket. It was\neven a matter of grave legal doubt whether he had committed one\nsingle piratical act. His trial in London was a farce. In the\ncase of the captured ships he alleged that they were sailing\nunder French passes, and he protested that his privateering\ncommission justified him, and this contention was not disproven.\nThe suspicion is not wanting that he was condemned as a scapegoat\nbecause certain noblemen of England had subscribed the capital to\noutfit his cruise, expecting to win rich dividends in gold\ncaptured from the pirates he was sent to attack. Against these\nmen a political outcry was raised, and as a result Captain Kidd\nwas sacrificed. He was a seaman who had earned honorable\ndistinction in earlier years, and fate has played his memory a\nshabby trick.",
        "It was otherwise with Blackbeard, most flamboyant of all colonial\npirates, who filled the stage with swaggering success, chewing\nwine-glasses in his cabin, burning sulphur to make his ship seem\nmore like hell, and industriously scourging the whole Atlantic\ncoast. Charleston lived in terror of him until Lieutenant\nMaynard, in a small sloop, laid him alongside in a\nhammer-and-tongs engagement and cut off the head of Blackbeard to\ndangle from the bowsprit as a trophy.",
        "Of this rudely adventurous era, it would be hard to find a seaman\nmore typical than the redoubtable Sir William Phips who became\nthe first royal Governor of the Massachusetts Colony in 1692.\nBorn on a frontier farm of the Maine coast while many of the\nPilgrim fathers were living, “his faithful mother,” wrote Cotton\nMather, “had no less than twenty-six children, whereof twenty-one\nwere sons; but equivalent to them all was William, one of the\nyoungest, whom, his father dying, was left young with his mother,\nand with her he lived, keeping ye sheep in Ye Wilderness until he\nwas eighteen years old.” Then he apprenticed himself to a\nneighboring shipwright who was building sloops and pinnaces and,\nhaving learned the trade, set out for Boston. As a ship-carpenter\nhe plied his trade, spent his wages in the taverns of the\nwaterside and there picked up wondrous yarns of the silver-laden\ngalleons of Spain which had shivered their timbers on the reefs\nof the Bahama Passage or gone down in the hurricanes that beset\nthose southerly seas. Meantime he had married a wealthy widow\nwhose property enabled him to go treasure-hunting on the Spanish\nmain. From his first voyage thither in a small vessel he escaped\nwith his life and barely enough treasure to pay the cost of the\nexpedition.",
        "In no wise daunted he laid his plans to search for a richly\nladened galleon which was said to have been wrecked half a\ncentury before off the coast of Hispaniola. Since his own funds\nwere not sufficient for this exploit, he betook himself to\nEngland to enlist the aid of the Government. With bulldog\npersistence he besieged the court of James II for a whole year,\nthis rough-and-ready New England shipmaster, until he was given a\nroyal frigate for his purpose. He failed to fish up more silver\nfrom the sands but, nothing daunted, he persuaded other patrons\nto outfit him with a small merchantman, the James and Mary, in\nwhich he sailed for the coast of Hispaniola. This time he found\nhis galleon and thirty-two tons of silver. “Besides that\nincredible treasure of plate, thus fetched up from seven or eight\nfathoms under water, there were vast riches of Gold, and Pearls,\nand Jewels . . . . All that a Spanish frigot was to be enriched\nwithal.”",
        "Up the Thames sailed the lucky little merchantman in the year of\n1687, with three hundred thousand pounds sterling as her\nfreightage of treasure. Captain Phips made honest division with\nhis backers and, because men of his integrity were not over\nplentiful in England after the Restoration, King James knighted\nhim. He sailed home to Boston, “a man of strong and sturdy\nframe,” as Hawthorne fancied him, “whose face had been roughened\nby northern tempests and blackened by the burning sun of the West\nIndies . . . . He wears an immense periwig flowing down over his\nshoulders . . . . His red, rough hands which have done many a\ngood day’s work with the hammer and adze are half-covered by the\ndelicate lace rues at the wrist.” But he carried with him the\nmanners of the forecastle, a man hasty and unlettered but\nsuperbly brave and honest. Even after he had become Governor he\nthrashed the captain of the Nonesuch frigate of the royal navy,\nand used his fists on the Collector of the Port after cursing him\nwith tremendous gusto. Such behavior in a Governor was too\nstrenuous, and Sir William Phips was summoned to England, where\nhe died while waiting his restoration to office and royal favor.\nFailing both, he dreamed of still another treasure voyage, “for\nit was his purpose, upon his dismission from his Government once\nmore to have gone upon his old Fishing-Trade, upon a mighty shelf\nof rock and banks of sand that lie where he had informed\nhimself.”",
        "The wars of England with France and Spain spread turmoil upon the\nhigh seas during the greater part of the eighteenth century. Yet\nwith an immense tenacity of purpose, these briny forefathers\nincreased their trade and multiplied their ships in the face of\nevery manner of adversity. The surprising fact is that most of\nthem were not driven ashore to earn their bread. What Daniel\nWebster said of them at a later day was true from the beginning:\n\"It is not, sir, by protection and bounties, but by unwearied\nexertion, by extreme economy, by that manly and resolute spirit\nwhich relies on itself to protect itself. These causes alone\nenable American ships still to keep the element and show the flag\nof their country in distant seas.”",
        "What was likely to befall a shipmaster in the turbulent\neighteenth century may be inferred from the misfortunes of\nCaptain Michael Driver of Salem. In 1759 he was in command of the\nschooner Three Brothers, bound to the West Indies on his lawful\nbusiness. Jogging along with a cargo of fish and lumber, he was\ntaken by a privateer under British colors and sent into Antigua\nas a prize. Unable to regain either his schooner or his two\nthousand dollar cargo, he sadly took passage for home. Another\nowner gave him employment and he set sail in the schooner Betsy\nfor Guadaloupe. During this voyage, poor man, he was captured and\ncarried into port by a French privateer. On the suggestion that\nhe might ransom his vessel on payment of four thousand livres, he\ndeparted for Boston in hope of finding the money, leaving behind\nthree of his sailors as hostages.",
        "Cash in hand for the ransom, the long-suffering Captain Michael\nDriver turned southward again, now in the schooner Mary, and he\nflew a flag of truce to indicate his errand. This meant nothing\nto the ruffian who commanded the English privateer Revenge. He\nviolently seized the innocent Mary and sent her into New\nProvidence. Here Captain Driver made lawful protest before the\nauthorities, and was set at liberty with vessel and cargo--an act\nof justice quite unusual in the Admiralty Court of the Bahamas.",
        "Unmolested, the harassed skipper managed to gain Cape Francois\nand rescue his three seamen and his schooner in exchange for the\nransom money. As he was about to depart homeward bound, a French\nfrigate snatched him and his crew out of their vessel and threw\nthem ashore at Santiago, where for two months they existed as\nragged beachcombers until by some judicial twist the schooner was\nreturned to them. They worked her home and presented their long\nlist of grievances to the colonial Government of Massachusetts,\nwhich duly forwarded them--and that was the end of it. Three\nyears had been spent in this catalogue of misadventures, and\nCaptain Driver, his owners, and his men were helpless against\nsuch intolerable aggression. They and their kind were a prey to\nevery scurvy rascal who misused a privateering commission to fill\nhis own pockets.",
        "Stoutly resolved to sail and trade as they pleased, these\nundaunted Americans, nevertheless, increased their business on\nblue water until shortly before the Revolution the New England\nfleet alone numbered six hundred sail. Its captains felt at home\nin Surinam and the Canaries. They trimmed their yards in the\nreaches of the Mediterranean and the North Sea or bargained\nthriftily in the Levant. The whalers of Nantucket, in their\napple-bowed barks, explored and hunted in distant seas, and the\nsmoke of their try-pots darkened the waters of Baffin Bay,\nGuinea, and Brazil. It was they who inspired Edmund Burke’s\nfamiliar eulogy: “No sea but is vexed by their fisheries. No\nclimate that is not a witness to their toils. Neither the\nperseverance of Holland nor the activity of France, nor the\ndexterous and firm sagacity of England ever carried this most\nperilous mode of hardy industry to the extent to which it has\nbeen pushed by this recent people--a people who are still, as it\nwere, but in the gristle and not yet hardened into the bone of\nmanhood.”",
        "In 1762, seventy-eight whalers cleared from American ports, of\nwhich more than half were from Nantucket. Eight years later there\nwere one hundred and twenty-five whalers out of Nantucket which\ntook 14,331 barrels of oil valued at $358,200. In size these\nvessels averaged no more than ninety tons, a fishing smack of\ntoday, and yet they battered their way half around the watery\nglobe and comfortably supported six thousand people who dwelt on\na sandy island unfit for farming and having no other industries.\nEvery Nantucket lad sailed for his “lay” or share of the catch\nand aspired to command eventually a whaler of his own.",
        "Whaler, merchantman, and slaver were training a host of\nincomparable seamen destined to harry the commerce of England\nunder the new-born Stars and Stripes, and now, in 1775, on the\nbrink of actual war, Parliament flung a final provocation and\naroused the furious enmity of the fishermen who thronged the\nGrand Bank. Lord North proposed to forbid the colonies to export\nfish to those foreign markets in which every seacoast village was\nvitally concerned, and he also contemplated driving the fishing\nfleets from their haunts off Newfoundland. This was to rob six\nthousand sturdy men of a livelihood afloat and to spread ruin\namong the busy ports, such as Marblehead and Gloucester, from\nwhich sailed hundreds of pinks, snows, and schooners. This\nmeasure became law notwithstanding the protests of twenty-one\npeers of the realm who declared: “We dissent because the attempt\nto coerce by famine the whole body of the inhabitants of great\nand populous provinces is without example in the history of this,\nor perhaps, of any civilized nation.”",
        "The sailormen bothered their heads very little about taxation\nwithout representation but whetted their anger with grudges more\nrobust. They had been beggared and bullied and shot at from the\nBay of Biscay to Barbados, and no sooner was the Continental\nCongress ready to issue privateering commissions and letters of\nmarque than for them it was up anchor and away to bag a\nBritisher. Scarcely had a shipmaster signaled his arrival with a\ndeep freight of logwood, molasses, or sugar than he received\norders to discharge with all speed and clear his decks for\nmounting heavier batteries and slinging the hammocks of a hundred\neager privateersmen who had signed articles in the tavern\nrendezvous. The timbered warehouses were filled with long-toms\nand nine-pounders, muskets, blunderbusses, pistols, cutlases,\nboarding-pikes, hand grenades, tomahawks, grape, canister, and\ndoubleheaded shot.",
        "In the narrow, gabled streets of Salem, Boston, New York, and\nBaltimore, crowds trooped after the fifes and drums with a\nstrapping recruiting officer to enroll “all gentlemen seamen and\nable-bodied landsmen who had a mind to distinguish themselves in\nthe glorious cause of their country and make their fortunes.\"\nMany a ship’s company was mustered between noon and sunset,\nincluding men who had served in armed merchantmen and who in\ntimes of nominal peace had fought the marauders of Europe or\nwhipped the corsairs of Barbary in the Strait of Gibraltar. Never\nwas a race of seamen so admirably fitted for the daring trade of\nprivateering as the crews of these tall sloops, topsail\nschooners, and smart square-riggers, their sides checkered with\ngun-ports, and ready to drive to sea like hawks.",
        "In some instances the assurance of these hardy men was both\nabsurd and sublime. Ramshackle boats with twenty or thirty men\naboard, mounting one or two old guns, sallied out in the\nexpectation of gold and glory, only to be captured by the first\nBritish cruiser that chanced to sight them. A few even sailed\nwith no cannon at all, confident of taking them out of the first\nprize overhauled by laying alongside--and so in some cases they\nactually did.",
        "The privateersmen of the Revolution played a larger part in\nwinning the war than has been commonly recognized. This fact,\nhowever, was clearly perceived by Englishmen of that era, as “The\nLondon Spectator” candidly admitted: “The books at Lloyds will\nrecount it, and the rate of assurances at that time will prove\nwhat their diminutive strength was able to effect in the face of\nour navy, and that when nearly one hundred pennants were flying\non our coast. Were we able to prevent their going in and out, or\nstop them from taking our trade and our storeships even in sight\nof our garrisons? Besides, were they not in the English and Irish\nChannels, picking up our homeward bound trade, sending their\nprizes into French and Spanish ports to the great terror of our\nmerchants and shipowners?”",
        "The naval forces of the Thirteen Colonies were pitifully feeble\nin comparison with the mighty fleets of the enemy whose flaming\nbroadsides upheld the ancient doctrine that “the Monarchs of\nGreat Britain have a peculiar and Sovereign authority upon the\nOcean . . . from the Laws of God and of Nature, besides an\nuninterrupted Fruition of it for so many Ages past as that its\nBeginnings cannot be traced out.\"*",
        "* “The Seaman’s Vade-Mecum.” London, 1744.",
        "In 1776 only thirty-one Continental cruisers of all classes were\nin commission, and this number was swiftly diminished by capture\nand blockade until in 1782 no more than seven ships flew the flag\nof the American Navy. On the other hand, at the close of 1777,\none hundred and seventy-four private armed vessels had been\ncommissioned, mounting two thousand guns and carrying nine\nthousand men. During this brief period of the war they took as\nprizes 733 British merchantmen and inflicted losses of more than\ntwo million pounds sterling. Over ten thousand seamen were made\nprisoners at a time when England sorely needed them for drafting\ninto her navy. To lose them was a far more serious matter than\nfor General Washington to capture as many Hessian mercenaries who\ncould be replaced by purchase.",
        "In some respects privateering as waged a century and more ago was\na sordid, unlovely business, the ruling motive being rather a\ngreed of gain than an ardent love of country. Shares in lucky\nships were bought and sold in the gambling spirit of a stock\nexchange. Fortunes were won and lost regardless of the public\nservice. It became almost impossible to recruit men for the navy\nbecause they preferred the chance of booty in a privateer. For\ninstance, the State of Massachusetts bought a twenty-gun ship,\nthe Protector, as a contribution to the naval strength, and one\nof her crew, Ebenezer Fox, wrote of the effort to enlist\nsufficient men: “The recruiting business went on slowly, however,\nbut at length upwards of three hundred men were carried, dragged,\nand driven abroad; of all ages, kinds, and descriptions; in all\nthe various stages of intoxication from that of sober tipsiness\nto beastly drunkenness; with the uproar and clamor that may be\nmore easily imagined than described. Such a motley group has\nnever been seen since Falstaff’s ragged regiment paraded the\nstreets of Coventry.”",
        "There was nothing of glory to boast of in fetching into port some\nlittle Nova Scotia coasting schooner with a cargo of deals and\npotatoes, whose master was also the owner and who lost the\nsavings of a lifetime because he lacked the men and guns to\ndefend his property against spoliation. The war was no concern of\nhis, and he was the victim of a system now obsolete among\ncivilized nations, a relic of a barbarous and piratical age whose\nspirit has been revived and gloried in recently only by the\nGovernment of the German Empire. The chief fault of the\nprivateersman was that he sailed and fought for his own gain, but\nhe was never guilty of sinking ships with passengers and crew\naboard, and very often he played the gentleman in gallant style.\nNothing could have seemed to him more abhorrent and incredible\nthan a kind of warfare which should drown women and children\nbecause they had embarked under an enemy’s flag.",
        "Extraordinary as were the successes of the Yankee privateers, it\nwas a game of give-and-take, a weapon which cut both ways, and\nthe temptation is to extol their audacious achievements while\nglossing over the heavy losses which their own merchant marine\nsuffered. The weakness of privateering was that it was wholly\noffensive and could not, like a strong navy, protect its own\ncommerce from depredation. While the Americans were capturing\nover seven hundred British vessels during the first two years of\nthe war, as many as nine hundred American ships were taken or\nsunk by the enemy, a rate of destruction which fairly swept the\nStars and Stripes from the tracks of ocean commerce. As prizes\nthese vessels were sold at Liverpool and London for an average\namount of two thousand pounds each and the loss to the American\nowners was, of course, ever so much larger.",
        "The fact remains, nevertheless--and it is a brilliant page of\nhistory to recall--that in an inchoate nation without a navy,\nwith blockading squadrons sealing most of its ports, with ragged\narmies on land which retreated oftener than they fought, private\narmed ships dealt the maritime prestige of Great Britain a far\ndeadlier blow than the Dutch, French, and Spanish were able to\ninflict. In England, there resulted actual distress, even lack of\nfood, because these intrepid seamen could not be driven away from\nher own coasts and continued to snatch their prizes from under\nthe guns of British forts and fleets. The plight of the West\nIndia Colonies was even worse, as witness this letter from a\nmerchant of Grenada: “We are happy if we can get anything for\nmoney by reason of the quantity of vessels taken by the\nAmericans. A fleet of vessels came from Ireland a few days ago.\nFrom sixty vessels that departed from Ireland not above\ntwenty-five arrived in this and neighboring islands, the others,\nit is thought, being all taken by American privateers. God knows,\nif this American war continues much longer, we shall all die of\nhunger.”",
        "On both sides, by far the greater number of captures was made\nduring the earlier period of the war which cleared the seas of\nthe smaller, slower, and unarmed vessels. As the war progressed\nand the profits flowed in, swifter and larger ships were built\nfor the special business of privateering until the game resembled\nactual naval warfare. Whereas, at first, craft of ten guns with\nforty or fifty men had been considered adequate for the service,\nthree or four years later ships were afloat with a score of heavy\ncannon and a trained crew of a hundred and fifty or two hundred\nmen, ready to engage a sloop of war or to stand up to the enemy’s\nlargest privateers. In those days single ship actions, now almost\nforgotten in naval tactics, were fought with illustrious skill\nand courage, and commanders won victories worthy of comparison\nwith deeds distinguished in the annals of the American Navy.",
        "Salem was the foremost privateering port of the Revolution, and\nfrom this pleasant harbor, long since deserted by ships and\nsailormen, there filled away past Cape Ann one hundred and\nfifty-eight vessels of all sizes to scan the horizon for British\ntopsails. They accounted for four hundred prizes, or half the\nwhole number to the credit of American arms afloat. This\npreeminence was due partly to freedom from a close blockade and\npartly to a seafaring population which was born and bred to its\ntrade and knew no other. Besides the crews of Salem merchantmen,\nprivateering enlisted the idle fishermen of ports nearby and the\nmariners of Boston whose commerce had been snuffed out by the\nBritish occupation. Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Charleston sent\nsome splendid armed ships to sea but not with the impetuous rush\nnor in anything like the numbers enrolled by this gray old town\nwhose fame was unique.",
        "For the most part, the records of all these brave ships and the\nthousands of men who sailed and sweated and fought in them are\ndim and scanty, no more than routine entries in dusty log-books\nwhich read like this: “Filled away in pursuit of a second sail in\nthe N. W. At 4.30 she hoisted English colors and commenced firing\nher stern guns. At 5.90 took in the steering sails, at the same\ntime she fired a broadside. We opened a fire from our larboard\nbattery and at 5.30 she struck her colors. Got out the boats and\nboarded her. She proved to be the British brig Acorn from\nLiverpool to Rio Janeiro, mounting fourteen cannon.\"* But now and\nthen one finds in these old sea-journals an entry more intimate\nand human, such as the complaint of the master of the privateer\nScorpion, cruising in 1778 and never a prize in sight. “This Book\nI made to keep the Accounts of my Voyage but God knows beste what\nthat will be, for I am at this time very Impashent but I hope\nsoon there will be a Change to ease my Trubled Mind. On this Day\nI was Chaced by Two Ships of War which I tuck to be Enemies, but\ncoming on thick Weather I have lost site of them and so conclude\nmyself escaped which is a small good Fortune in the midste of my\nDiscouragements.\"** A burst of gusty laughter still echoes along\nthe crowded deck of the letter-of-marque schooner Success, whose\nmaster, Captain Philip Thrash, inserted this diverting comment in\nhis humdrum record of the day’s work: “At one half past 8\ndiscovered a sail ahead. Tacked ship. At 9 tacked ship again and\npast just to Leeward of the Sail which appeared to be a damn’d\nComical Boat, by G-d.”",

        "There are a few figures of the time and place which stand out,\nfull-length, in vivid colors against a background that satisfies\nthe desire of romance and thrillingly conveys the spirit of the\ntime and the place. Such a one was Captain Jonathan Haraden,\nSalem privateersman, who captured one thousand British cannon\nafloat and is worthy to be ranked as one of the ablest\nsea-fighters of his generation. He was a merchant mariner, a\nmaster at the outbreak of the Revolution, who had followed the\nsea since boyhood. But it was more to his taste to command the\nSalem ship General Pickering of 180 tons which was fitted out\nunder a letter of marque in the spring of 1780. She carried\nfourteen six-pounders and forty-five men and boys, nothing very\nformidable, when Captain Haraden sailed for Bilbao with a cargo\nof sugar. During the voyage, before his crew had been hammered\ninto shape, he beat off a British privateer of twenty guns and\nsafely tacked into the Bay of Biscay.",
        "There he sighted another hostile privateer, the Golden Eagle,\nlarger than his own ship. Instead of shifting his course to avoid\nher, Haraden clapped on sail and steered alongside after\nnightfall, roaring through his trumpet: “What ship is this? An\nAmerican frigate, sir. Strike, or I’ll sink you with a\nbroadside.”",
        "Dazed by this unexpected summons in the gloom, the master of the\nGolden Eagle promptly surrendered, and a prize crew was thrown\naboard with orders to follow the Pickering into Bilbao. While\njust outside that Spanish harbor, a strange sail was descried and\nagain Jonathan Haraden cleared for action. The vessel turned out\nto be the Achilles, one of the most powerful privateers out of\nLondon, with forty guns and a hundred and fifty men, or almost\nthrice the fighting strength of the little Pickering. She was, in\nfact, more like a sloop of war. Before Captain Haraden could haul\nwithin gunshot to protect his prize, it had been recaptured by\nthe Achilles, which then maneuvered to engage the Pickering.",
        "Darkness intervened, but Jonathan Haraden had no idea of escaping\nunder cover of it. He was waiting for the morning breeze and a\nchance to fight it out to a finish. He was a handsome man with an\nair of serene composure and a touch of the theatrical such as\nNelson displayed in his great moments. Having prepared his ship\nfor battle, he slept soundly until dawn and then dressed with\nfastidious care to stroll on deck, where he beheld the Achilles\nbearing down on him with her crew at quarters.",
        "His own men were clustered behind their open ports, matches\nlighted, tackles and breechings cast off, crowbars, handspikes,\nand sponge-staves in place, gunners stripped to the waist,\npowder-boys ready for the word like sprinters on the mark.\nForty-five of them against a hundred and fifty, and Captain\nHaraden, debonair, unruffled, walking to and fro with a leisurely\ndemeanor, remarking that although the Achilles appeared to be\nsuperior in force, “he had no doubt they would beat her if they\nwere firm and steady and did not throw away their fire.”",
        "It was, indeed, a memorable sea-picture, the sturdy Pickering\nriding deep with her burden of sugar and seeming smaller than she\nreally was, the Achilles towering like a frigate, and all Bilbao\nturned out to watch the duel, shore and headlands crowded with\nspectators, the blue harbor-mouth gay with an immense flotilla of\nfishing boats and pleasure craft. The stake for which Haraden\nfought was to retake the Golden Eagle prize and to gain his port.\nHis seamanship was flawless. Vastly outnumbered if it should come\nto boarding, he handled his vessel so as to avoid the Achilles\nwhile he poured the broadsides into her. After two hours the\nLondon privateer emerged from the smoke which had obscured the\ncombat and put out to sea in flight, hulled through and through,\nwhile a farewell flight of crowbars, with which the guns of the\nPickering had been crammed to the muzzle, ripped through her\nsails and rigging.",
        "Haraden hoisted canvas and drove in chase, but the Achilles had\nthe heels of him “with a mainsail as large as a ship of the\nline,” and reluctantly he wore ship and, with the Golden Eagle\nagain in his possession, he sailed to an anchorage in Bilbao\nharbor. The Spanish populace welcomed him with tremendous\nenthusiasm. He was carried through the streets in a holiday\nprocession and was the hero of banquets and public receptions.",
        "Such a man was bound to be the idol of his sailors and one of\nthem quite plausibly related that “so great was the confidence he\ninspired that if he but looked at a sail through his glass and\ntold the helmsman to steer for her, the observation went\nround,’If she is an enemy, she is ours.’”",
        "It was in this same General Pickering, no longer sugar-laden but\nin cruising trim, that Jonathan Haraden accomplished a feat which\nPaul Jones might have been proud to claim. There lifted above the\nsky-line three armed merchantmen sailing in company from Halifax\nto New York, a brig of fourteen guns, a ship of sixteen guns, a\nsloop of twelve guns. When they flew signals and formed in line,\nthe ship alone appeared to outmatch the Pickering, but Haraden,\nin that lordly manner of his, assured his men that “he had no\ndoubt whatever that if they would do their duty he would quickly\ncapture the three vessels.” Here was performance very much out of\nthe ordinary, naval strategy of an exceptionally high order, and\nyet it is dismissed by the only witness who took the trouble to\nmention it in these few, casual words: “This he did with great\nease by going alongside of each of them, one after the other.”",
        "One more story of this master sea-rover of the Revolution, sailor\nand gentleman, who served his country so much more brilliantly\nthan many a landsman lauded in the written histories of the war.\nWhile in the Pickering he attacked a heavily armed royal mail\npacket bound to England from the West Indies, one of the largest\nmerchant vessels of her day and equipped to defend herself\nagainst privateers. A tough antagonist and a hard nut to crack!\nThey battered each other like two pugilists for four hours and\neven then the decision was still in the balance. Then Haraden\nsheered off to mend his damaged gear and splintered hull before\nclosing in again.",
        "He then discovered that all his powder had been shot away\nexcepting one last charge. Instead of calling it a drawn battle,\nhe rammed home this last shot in the locker, and ran down to\nwindward of the packet, so close that he could shout across to\nthe other quarter-deck: “I will give you five minutes to haul\ndown your colors. If they are not down at the end of that time, I\nwill fire into you and sink you, so help me God.”",
        "It was the bluff magnificent--courage cold-blooded and\ncalculating. The adversary was still unbeaten. Haraden stood with\nwatch in hand and sonorously counted off the minutes. It was the\nstronger will and not the heavier metal that won the day. To be\nshattered by fresh broadsides at pistol-range was too much for\nthe nerves of the gallant English skipper whose decks were\nalready like a slaughterhouse. One by one, Haraden shouted the\nminutes and his gunners blew their matches. At “four” the red\nensign came fluttering down and the mail packet was a prize of\nwar.",
        "Another merchant seaman of this muster-roll of patriots was Silas\nTalbot, who took to salt water as a cabin boy at the age of\ntwelve and was a prosperous shipmaster at twenty-one with savings\ninvested in a house of his own in Providence. Enlisting under\nWashington, he was made a captain of infantry and was soon\npromoted, but he was restless ashore and glad to obtain an odd\nassignment. As Colonel Talbot he selected sixty infantry\nvolunteers, most of them seamen by trade, and led them aboard the\nsmall sloop Argo in May, 1779, to punish the New York Tories who\nwere equipping privateers against their own countrymen and\nworking great mischief in Long Island Sound. So serious was the\nsituation that General Gates found it almost impossible to obtain\nfood supplies for the northern department of the Continental\narmy.",
        "Silas Talbot and his nautical infantrymen promptly fell in with\nthe New York privateer Lively, a fair match for him, and as\npromptly sent her into port. He then ran offshore and picked up\nand carried into Boston two English privateers headed for New\nYork with large cargoes of merchandise from the West Indies. But\nhe was particularly anxious to square accounts with a renegade\nCaptain Hazard who made Newport his base and had captured many\nAmerican vessels with the stout brig King George, using her for\n\"the base purpose of plundering his old neighbors and friends.”",
        "On his second cruise in the Argo, young Silas Talbot encountered\nthe perfidious King George to the southward of Long Island and\nriddled her with one broadside after another, first hailing\nCaptain Hazard by name and cursing him in double-shotted phrases\nfor the traitorous swab that he was. Then the seagoing infantry\nscrambled over the bulwarks and tumbled the Tories down their own\nhatches without losing a man. A prize crew with the humiliated\nKing George made for New London, where there was much cheering in\nthe port, and “even the women, both young and old, expressed the\ngreatest joy.”",
        "With no very heavy fighting, Talbot had captured five vessels and\nwas keen to show what his crew could do against mettlesome\nfoemen. He found them at last well out to sea in a large ship\nwhich seemed eager to engage him. Only a few hundred feet apart\nthrough a long afternoon, they briskly and cheerily belabored\neach other with grape and solid shot. Talbot’s speaking-trumpet\nwas shot out of his hand, the tails of his coat were shorn off,\nand all the officers and men stationed with him on the\nquarter-deck were killed or wounded.",
        "His crew reported that the Argo was in a sinking condition, with\nthe water flooding the gun-deck, but he told them to lower a man\nor two in the bight of a line and they pluckily plugged the holes\nfrom overside. There was a lusty huzza when the Englishman’s\nmainmast crashed to the deck and this finished the affair. Silas\nTalbot found that he had trounced the privateer Dragon, of twice\nhis own tonnage and with the advantage in both guns and men.",
        "While his crew was patching the Argo and pumping the water from\nher hold, the lookout yelled that another sail was making for\nthem. Without hesitation Talbot somehow got this absurdly\nimpudent one-masted craft of his under way and told those of his\nsixty men who survived to prepare for a second tussle.\nFortunately another Yankee privateer joined the chase and\ntogether they subdued the armed brig Hannah. When the Argo safely\nconvoyed the two prizes into New Bedford, “all who beheld her\nwere astonished that a vessel of her diminutive size could suffer\nso much and yet get safely to port.”",
        "Men fought and slew each other in those rude and distant days\nwith a certain courtesy, with a fine, punctilious regard for the\netiquette of the bloody game. There was the Scotch skipper of the\nBetsy, a privateer, whom Silas Talbot hailed as follows, before\nthey opened fire:",
        "“You must now haul down those British colors, my friend.”",
        "“Notwithstanding I find you an enemy, as I suspected,” was the\ndignified reply, “yet, sir, I shall let them hang a little bit\nlonger,--with your permission,--so fire away, Flanagan.”",
        "During another of her cruises the Argo pursued an artfully\ndisguised ship of the line which could have blown her to kingdom\ncome with a broadside of thirty guns. The little Argo was\nactually becalmed within short range, but her company got out the\nsweeps and rowed her some distance before darkness and a favoring\nslant of wind carried them clear. In the summer of 1780, Captain\nSilas Talbot, again a mariner by title, was given the private\ncruiser General Washington with one hundred and twenty men, but\nhe was less fortunate with her than when afloat in the tiny Argo\nwith his sixty Continentals. Off Sandy Hook he ran into the\nBritish fleet under Admiral Arbuthnot and, being outsailed in a\ngale of wind, he was forced to lower his flag to the great\nseventy-four Culloden. After a year in English prisons he was\nreleased and made his way home, serving no more in the war but\nhaving the honor to command the immortal frigate Constitution in\n1799 as a captain in the American Navy.",
        "In several notable instances the privateersmen tried conclusions\nwith ships that flew the royal ensign, and got the better of\nthem. The hero of an uncommonly brilliant action of this sort was\nCaptain George Geddes of Philadelphia, who was entrusted with the\nCongress, a noble privateer of twenty-four guns and two hundred\nmen. Several of the smaller British cruisers had been sending\nparties ashore to plunder estates along the southern shores, and\none of them, the sloop of war Savage, had even raided\nWashington’s home at Mount Vernon. Later she shifted to the coast\nof Georgia in quest of loot and was unlucky enough to fall\nathwart Captain Geddes in the Congress.",
        "The privateer was the more formidable ship and faster on the\nwind, forcing Captain Sterling of the Savage to accept the\nchallenge. Disabled aloft very early in the fight, Captain Geddes\nwas unable to choose his position, for which reason they\nliterally battled hand-to-hand, hulls grinding against each\nother, the gunners scorched by the flashes of the cannon in the\nports of the opposing ship, with scarcely room to ply the\nrammers, and the sailors throwing missiles from the decks, hand\ngrenades, cold shot, scraps of iron, belaying-pins.",
        "As the vessels lay interlocked, the Savage was partly dismasted\nand Captain Geddes, leaping upon the forecastle head, told the\nboarders to follow him. Before they could swing their cutlases\nand dash over the hammock-nettings, the British boatswain waved\nhis cap and yelled that the Savage had surrendered. Captain\nSterling was dead, eight others were killed, and twenty-four\nwounded. The American loss was about the same. Captain Geddes,\nhowever, was unable to save his prize because a British frigate\nswooped down and took them both into Charleston.",
        "When peace came in 1783, it was independence dearly bought by\nland and sea, and no small part of the price was the loss of a\nthousand merchant ships which would see their home ports no more.\nOther misfortunes added to the toll of destruction. The great\nfishing fleets which had been the chief occupation of coastwise\nNew England were almost obliterated and their crews were\nscattered. Many of the men had changed their allegiance and were\nsailing out of Halifax, and others were impressed into British\nmen-of-war or returned broken in health from long confinement in\nBritish prisons. The ocean was empty of the stanch schooners\nwhich had raced home with lee rails awash to cheer waiting wives\nand sweethearts.",
        "The fate of Nantucket and its whalers was even more tragic. This\ncolony on its lonely island amid the shoals was helpless against\nraids by sea, and its ships and storehouses were destroyed\nwithout mercy. Many vessels in distant waters were captured\nbefore they were even aware that a state of war existed. Of a\nfleet numbering a hundred and fifty sail, one hundred and\nthirty-four were taken by the enemy and Nantucket whaling\nsuffered almost total extinction. These seamen, thus robbed of\ntheir livelihood, fought nobly for their country’s cause. Theirs\nwas not the breed to sulk or whine in port. Twelve hundred of\nthem were killed or made prisoners during the Revolution. They\nwere to be found in the Army and Navy and behind the guns of\nprivateers. There were twenty-five Nantucket whalemen in the crew\nof the Ranger when Paul Jones steered her across the Atlantic on\nthat famous cruise which inspired the old forecastle song that\nbegins",
        "    ’Tis of the gallant Yankee ship\n    That flew the Stripes and Stars,\n    And the whistling wind from the west nor’west\n    Blew through her pitch pine spars.\n    With her starboard tacks aboard, my boys,\n    She hung upon the gale.\n    On an autumn night we raised the light\n    Off the Old Head of Kinsale.",
        "Pitiful as was the situation of Nantucket, with its only industry\nwiped out and two hundred widows among the eight hundred families\nleft on the island, the aftermath of war seemed almost as ruinous\nalong the whole Atlantic coast. More ships could be built and\nthere were thousands of adventurous sailors to man them, but\nwhere were the markets for the product of the farms and mills and\nplantations? The ports of Europe had been so long closed to\nAmerican shipping that little demand was left for American goods.\nTo the Government of England the people of the Republic were no\nlonger fellow-countrymen but foreigners. As such they were\nsubject to the Navigation Acts, and no cargoes could be sent to\nthat kingdom unless in British vessels. The flourishing trade\nwith the West Indies was made impossible for the same reason, a\nspecial Order in Council aiming at one fell stroke to “put an end\nto the building and increase of American vessels” and to finish\nthe careers of three hundred West Indiamen already afloat. In the\nislands themselves the results were appalling. Fifteen thousand\nslaves died of starvation because the American traders were\ncompelled to cease bringing them dried fish and corn during\nseasons in which their own crops were destroyed by hurricanes.",
        "In 1776, one-third of the seagoing merchant marine of Great\nBritain had been bought or built to order in America because\nlumber was cheaper and wages were lower. This lucrative business\nwas killed by a law which denied Englishmen the privilege of\npurchasing ships built in American yards. So narrow and bitter\nwas this commercial enmity, so ardent this desire to banish the\nStars and Stripes from blue water, that Lord Sheffield in 1784\nadvised Parliament that the pirates of Algiers and Tripoli really\nbenefited English commerce by preying on the shipping of weaker\nnations. “It is not probable that the American States will have a\nvery free trade in the Mediterranean,” said he. “It will not be\nto the interest of any of the great maritime Powers to protect\nthem from the Barbary States. If they know their interests, they\nwill not encourage the Americans to be carriers. That the Barbary\nStates are advantageous to maritime Powers is certain.”",
        "Denied the normal ebb and flow of trade and commerce and with the\nimports from England far exceeding the value of the merchandise\nexported thence, the United States, already impoverished, was\ndrained of its money, and a currency of dollars, guineas, joes,\nand moidores grew scarcer day by day. There was no help in a\ngovernment which consisted of States united only in name.\nCongress comprised a handful of respectable gentlemen who had\nlittle power and less responsibility, quarreling among themselves\nfor lack of better employment. Retaliation against England by\nmeans of legislation was utterly impossible. Each State looked\nafter its commerce in its own peculiar fashion and the devil\nmight take the hindmost. Their rivalries and jealousies were like\nthose of petty kingdoms. If one State should close her ports is\nto English ships, the others would welcome them in order to\ndivert the trade, with no feeling of national pride or federal\ncooperation.",
        "The Articles of Confederation had empowered Congress to make\ntreaties of commerce, but only such as did not restrain the\nlegislative power of any State from laying imposts and regulating\nexports and imports. If a foreign power imposed heavy duties upon\nAmerican shipping, it was for the individual States and not for\nCongress to say whether the vessels of the offending nation\nshould be allowed free entrance to the ports of the United\nStates: It was folly to suppose, ran the common opinion, that if\nSouth Carolina should bar her ports to Spain because rice and\nindigo were excluded from the Spanish colonies, New Hampshire,\nwhich furnished masts and lumber for the Spanish Navy, ought to\ndo the same. The idea of turning the whole matter over to\nCongress was considered preposterous by many intelligent\nAmericans.",
        "In these thirteen States were nearly three and a quarter million\npeople hemmed in a long and narrow strip between the sea and an\nunexplored wilderness in which the Indians were an ever present\nperil. The Southern States, including Maryland, prosperous\nagricultural regions, contained almost one-half the English-\nspeaking population of America. As colonies, they had found the\nOld World eager for their rice, tobacco, indigo, and tar, and\nslavery was the means of labor so firmly established that\none-fifth of the inhabitants were black. By contrast, the\nNorthern States were still concerned with commerce as the very\nlifeblood of their existence. New England had not dreamed of the\nmillions of spindles which should hum on the banks of her rivers\nand lure her young men and women from the farms to the clamorous\nfactory towns. The city of New York had not yet outgrown its\ntraffic in furs and its magnificent commercial destiny was still\nunrevealed. It was a considerable seaport but not yet a gateway.\nFrom Sandy Hook, however, to the stormy headlands of Maine, it\nwas a matter of life and death that ships should freely come and\ngo with cargoes to exchange. All other resources were trifling in\ncomparison.",
        "In such compelling circumstances as these, necessity became the\nmother of achievement. There is nothing finer in American history\nthan the dogged fortitude and high-hearted endeavor with which\nthe merchant seamen returned to their work after the Revolution\nand sought and found new markets for their wares. It was then\nthat Salem played that conspicuous part which was, for a\ngeneration, to overshadow the activities of all other American\nseaports. Six thousand privateersmen had signed articles in her\ntaverns, as many as the total population of the town, and they\nfilled it with a spirit of enterprise and daring. Not for them\nthe stupid monotony of voyages coastwise if more hazardous\nventures beckoned and there were havens and islands unvexed by\ntrade where bold men might win profit and perhaps fight for life\nand cargo.",
        "Now there dwelt in Salem one of the great men of his time, Elias\nHasket Derby, the first American millionaire, and very much more\nthan this. He was a shipping merchant with a vision and with the\nhard-headed sagacity to make his dreams come true. His was a\nnotable seafaring family, to begin with. His father, Captain\nRichard Derby, born in 1712, had dispatched his small vessels to\nthe West Indies and Virginia and with the returns from these\nvoyages he had loaded assorted cargoes for Spain and Madeira and\nhad the proceeds remitted in bills of exchange to London or in\nwine, salt, fruit, oil, lead, and handkerchiefs to America.\nRichard Derby’s vessels had eluded or banged away at the\nprivateers during the French War from 1756 to 1763, mounting from\neight to twelve guns, “with four cannon below decks for close\nquarters.” Of such a temper was this old sea-dog who led the\nmilitia and defiantly halted General Gage’s regulars at the North\nRiver bridge in Salem, two full months before the skirmish at\nLexington. Eight of the nineteen cannon which it was proposed to\nseize from the patriots had been taken from the ships of Captain\nRichard Derby and stored in his warehouse for the use of the\nProvincial Congress.",
        "It was Richard’s son, Captain John Derby, who carried to England\nin the swift schooner Quero the first news of the affair at\nLexington, ahead of the King’s messenger. A sensational arrival,\nif ever there was one! This Salem shipmaster, cracking on sail\nlike a proper son of his sire, making the passage in twenty-nine\ndays and handsomely beating the lubberly Royal Express Packet\nSukey which left Boston four days sooner, and startling the\nBritish nation with the tidings which meant the loss of an\nAmerican empire! A singular coincidence was that this same\nCaptain John Derby should have been the first mariner to inform\nthe United States that peace had come, when he arrived from\nFrance in 1783 with the message that a treaty had been signed.",
        "Elias Hasket Derby was another son of Richard. When his manifold\nenergies were crippled by the war, he diverted his ability and\nabundant resources into privateering. He was interested in at\nleast eighty of the privateers out of Salem, invariably\nsubscribing for such shares as might not be taken up by his\nfellow-townsmen. He soon perceived that many of these craft were\nwretchedly unfit for the purpose and were easily captured or\nwrecked. It was characteristic of his genius that he should\nestablish shipyards of his own, turn his attention to naval\narchitecture, and begin to build a class of vessels vastly\nsuperior in size, model, and speed to any previously launched in\nthe colonies. They were designed to meet the small cruiser of the\nBritish Navy on even terms and were remarkably successful, both\nin enriching their owner and in defying the enemy.",
        "At the end of the war Elias Hasket Derby discovered that these\nfine ships were too large and costly to ply up and down the\ncoast. Instead of bewailing his hard lot, he resolved to send\nthem to the other side of the globe. At a time when the British\nand the Dutch East India companies insolently claimed a monopoly\nof the trade of the Orient, when American merchant seamen had\nnever ventured beyond the two Atlantics, this was a conception\nwhich made of commerce a surpassing romance and heralded the\ngolden era of the nation’s life upon the sea.",
        "His Grand Turk of three hundred tons was promptly fitted out for\na pioneering voyage as far as the Cape of Good Hope. Salem knew\nher as “the great ship” and yet her hull was not quite one\nhundred feet long. Safely Captain Jonathan Ingersoll took her out\nover the long road, his navigating equipment consisting of a few\nerroneous maps and charts, a sextant, and Guthrie’s Geographical\nGrammar. In Table Bay he sold his cargo of provisions and then\nvisited the coast of Guinea to dispose of his rum for ivory and\ngold dust but brought not a single slave back, Mr. Derby having\ndeclared that “he would rather sink the whole capital employed\nthan directly or indirectly be concerned in so infamous a\ntrade\"--an unusual point of view for a shipping merchant of New\nEngland in 1784!",
        "Derby ships were first to go to Mauritius, then called the Isle\nof France, first at Calcutta, and among the earliest to swing at\nanchor off Canton. When Elias Hasket Derby decided to invade this\nrich East India commerce, he sent his eldest son, Elias Hasket,\nJr., to England and the Continent after a course at Harvard. The\nyoung man became a linguist and made a thorough study of English\nand French methods of trade. Having laid this foundation for the\nventure, the son was now sent to India, where he lived for three\nyears in the interests of his house, building up a trade almost\nfabulously profitable.",
        "How fortunes were won in those stirring days may be discerned\nfrom the record of young Derby’s ventures while in the Orient. In\n1788 the proceeds of one cargo enabled him to buy a ship and a\nbrigantine in the Isle of France. These two vessels he sent to\nBombay to load with cotton. Two other ships of his fleet, the\nAstrea and Light Horse, were filled at Calcutta and Rangoon and\nordered to Salem. It was found, when the profits of these\ntransactions were reckoned, that the little squadron had earned\n$100,000 above all outlay.",
        "To carry on such a business as this enlisted many men and\nindustries. While the larger ships were making their distant\nvoyages, the brigs and schooners were gathering cargoes for\nthem, crossing to Gothenburg and St. Petersburg for iron, duck,\nand hemp, to France, Spain, and Madeira for wine and lead, to the\nFrench West Indies for molasses to be turned into rum, to New\nYork, Philadelphia, and Richmond for flour, provisions, and\ntobacco. These shipments were assembled in the warehouses on\nDerby Wharf and paid for the teas, coffees, pepper, muslin,\nsilks, and ivory which the ships from the Far East were fetching\nhome. In fourteen years the Derby ships made one hundred and\ntwenty-five voyages to Europe and far eastern ports and out of\nthe thirty-five vessels engaged only one was lost at sea.",
        "It was in 1785 when the Grand Turk, on a second voyage, brought\nback a cargo of silks, teas, and nankeens from Batavia and China,\nthat “The Independent Chronicle” of London, unconsciously\nhumorous, was moved to affirm that “the Americans have given up\nall thought of a China trade which can never be carried on to\nadvantage without some settlement in the East Indies.”",
        "As soon as these new sea-trails had been furrowed by the keels of\nElias Hasket Derby, other Salem merchants were quick to follow in\na rivalry which left no sea unexplored for virgin markets and\nwhich ransacked every nook and corner of barbarism which had a\nshore. Vessels slipped their cables and sailed away by night for\nsome secret destination with whose savage potentate trade\nrelations had been established. It might be Captain Jonathan\nCarnes who, while at the port of Bencoolen in 1793, heard that\npepper grew wild on the northern coast of Sumatra. He whispered\nthe word to the Salem owner, who sent him back in the schooner\nRajah with only four guns and ten men. Eighteen months later,\nJonathan Carnes returned to Salem with a cargo of pepper in bulk,\nthe first direct importation, and cleared seven hundred per cent\non the voyage. When he made ready to go again, keeping his\nbusiness strictly to himself, other owners tracked him clear to\nBencoolen, but there he vanished in the Rajah, and his secret with\nhim, until he reappeared with another precious cargo of pepper.\nWhen, at length, he shared this trade with other vessels, it\nmeant that Salem controlled the pepper market of Sumatra and for\nmany years supplied a large part of the world’s demand.",
        "And so it happened that in the spicy warehouses that overlooked\nSalem Harbor there came to be stored hemp from Luzon, gum copal\nfrom Zanzibar, palm oil from Africa, coffee from Arabia, tallow\nfrom Madagascar, whale oil from the Antarctic, hides and wool\nfrom the Rio de la Plata, nutmeg and cloves from Malaysia. Such\nmerchandise had been bought or bartered for by shipmasters who\nwere much more than mere navigators. They had to be shrewd\nmerchants on their own accounts, for the success or failure of a\nvoyage was mostly in their hands. Carefully trained and highly\nintelligent men, they attained command in the early twenties and\nwere able to retire, after a few years more afloat, to own ships\nand exchange the quarterdeck for the counting-room, and the cabin\nfor the solid mansion and lawn on Derby Street. Every\nopportunity, indeed, was offered them to advance their own\nfortunes. They sailed not for wages but for handsome commissions\nand privileges--in the Derby ships, five per cent of a cargo\noutward bound, two and a half per cent of the freightage home,\nfive per cent profit on goods bought and sold between foreign\nports, and five per cent of the cargo space for their own use.",
        "Such was the system which persuaded the pick and flower of young\nAmerican manhood to choose the sea as the most advantageous\ncareer possible. There was the Crowninshield family, for example,\nwith five brothers all in command of ships before they were old\nenough to vote and at one time all five away from Salem, each in\nhis own vessel and three of them in the East India trade. “When\nlittle boys,” to quote from the memoirs of Benjamin\nCrowninshield, “they were all sent to a common school and about\ntheir eleventh year began their first particular study which\nshould develop them as sailors and ship captains. These boys\nstudied their navigation as little chaps of twelve years old and\nwere required to thoroughly master the subject before being sent\nto sea . . . . As soon as the art of navigation was mastered, the\nyoungsters were sent to sea, sometimes as common sailors but\ncommonly as ship’s clerks, in which position they were able to\nlearn everything about the management of a ship without actually\nbeing a common sailor.”",
        "This was the practice in families of solid station and social\nrank, for to be a shipmaster was to follow the profession of a\ngentleman. Yet the bright lad who entered by way of the\nforecastle also played for high stakes. Soon promoted to the\nberth of mate, he was granted cargo space for his own adventures\nin merchandise and a share of the profits. In these days the\nyouth of twenty-one is likely to be a college undergraduate,\nrated too callow and unfit to be intrusted with the smallest\nbusiness responsibilities and tolerantly regarded as unable to\ntake care of himself. It provokes both a smile and a glow of\npride, therefore, to recall those seasoned striplings and what\nthey did.",
        "No unusual instance was that of Nathaniel Silsbee, later United\nStates Senator from Massachusetts, who took command of the new\nship Benjamin in the year 1792, laden with a costly cargo from\nSalem for the Cape of Good Hope and India, “with such\ninstructions,” says he, “as left the management of the voyage\nvery much to my own discretion. Neither myself nor the chief\nmate, Mr. Charles Derby, had attained the age of twenty-one years\nwhen we left home. I was not then twenty.” This reminded him to\nspeak of his own family. Of the three Silsbee brothers, “each of\nus obtained the command of vessels and the consignment of their\ncargoes before attaining the age of twenty years, viz., myself at\nthe age of eighteen and a half, my brother William at nineteen\nand a half, and my brother Zachariah before he was twenty years\nold. Each and all of us left off going to sea before reaching the\nage of twenty-nine years.”",
        "How resourcefully these children of the sea could handle affairs\nwas shown in this voyage of the Benjamin. While in the Indian\nOcean young Silsbee fell in with a frigate which gave him news of\nthe beginning of war between England and France. He shifted his\ncourse for Mauritius and there sold the cargo for a dazzling\nprice in paper dollars, which he turned into Spanish silver. An\nembargo detained him for six months, during which this currency\nincreased to three times the value of the paper money. He gave up\nthe voyage to Calcutta, sold the Spanish dollars and loaded with\ncoffee and spices for Salem. At the Cape of Good Hope, however,\nhe discovered that he could earn a pretty penny by sending his\ncargo home in other ships and loading the Benjamin again for\nMauritius. When, at length, he arrived in Salem harbor, after\nnineteen months away, his enterprises had reaped a hundred per\ncent for Elias Hasket Derby and his own share was the snug little\nfortune of four thousand dollars. Part of this he, of course,\ninvested at sea, and at twenty-two he was part owner of the\nBetsy, East Indiaman, and on the road to independence.",
        "As second mate in the Benjamin had sailed Richard Cleveland,\nanother matured mariner of nineteen, who crowded into one life an\nOdyssey of adventure noteworthy even in that era and who had the\nknack of writing about it with rare skill and spirit. In 1797,\nwhen twenty-three years old, he was master of the bark Enterprise\nbound from Salem to Mocha for coffee. The voyage was abandoned at\nHavre and he sent the mate home with the ship, deciding to remain\nabroad and gamble for himself with the chances of the sea. In\nFrance he bought on credit a “cutter-sloop” of forty-three tons,\nno larger than the yachts whose owners think it venturesome to\ntake them off soundings in summer cruises. In this little box of\na craft he planned to carry a cargo of merchandise to the Cape of\nGood Hope and thence to Mauritius.",
        "His crew included two men, a black cook, and a brace of boys who\nwere hastily shipped at Havre. “Fortunately they were all so much\nin debt as not to want any time to spend their advance, but were\nready at the instant, and with this motley crew, (who, for aught\nI knew, were robbers or pirates) I put to sea.” The only sailor\nof the lot was a Nantucket lad who was made mate and had to be\ntaught the rudiments of navigation while at sea. Of the others he\nhad this to say, in his lighthearted manner:",
        "“The first of my fore-mast hands is a great, surly, crabbed,\nraw-boned, ignorant Prussian who is so timid aloft that the mate\nhas frequently been obliged to do his duty there. I believe him\nto be more of a soldier than a sailor, though he has often\nassured me that he has been a boatswain’s mate of a Dutch\nIndiaman, which I do not believe as he hardly knows how to put\ntwo ends of a rope together .... My cook . . . a good-natured\nnegro and a tolerable cook, so unused to a vessel that in the\nsmoothest weather he cannot walk fore and aft without holding\nonto something with both hands. This fear proceeds from the fact\nthat he is so tall and slim that if he should get a cant it might\nbe fatal to him. I did not think America could furnish such a\nspecimen of the negro race . . . nor did I ever see such a\nsimpleton. It is impossible to teach him anything and . . . he\ncan hardly tell the main-halliards from the mainstay.",
        "“Next is an English boy of seventeen years old, who from having\nlately had the small-pox is feeble and almost blind, a miserable\nobject, but pity for his misfortunes induces me to make his duty\nas easy as possible. Finally I have a little ugly French boy, the\nvery image of a baboon, who from having served for some time on\ndifferent privateers has all the tricks of a veteran man-of-war’s\nman, though only thirteen years old, and by having been in an\nEnglish prison, has learned enough of the language to be a\nproficient in swearing.”",
        "With these human scrapings for a ship’s company, the cutter\nCaroline was three months on her solitary way as far as the Cape\nof Good Hope, where the inhabitants “could not disguise their\nastonishment at the size of the vessel, the boyish appearance of\nthe master and mate, and the queer and unique characters of the\ntwo men and boy who composed the crew.” The English officials\nthought it strange indeed, suspecting some scheme of French spies\nor smuggled dispatches, but Richard Cleveland’s petition to the\nGovernor, Lord McCartney, ingenuously patterned after certain\nletters addressed to noblemen as found in an old magazine aboard\nhis vessel, won the day for him and he was permitted to sell the\ncutter and her cargo, having changed his mind about proceeding\nfarther.",
        "Taking passage to Batavia, he looked about for another venture\nbut found nothing to his liking and wandered on to Canton, where\nhe was attracted by the prospect of a voyage to the northwest\ncoast of America to buy furs from the Indians. In a cutter no\nlarger than the Caroline he risked all his cash and credit,\nstocking her with $20,000 worth of assorted merchandise for\nbarter, and put out across the Pacific, “having on board\ntwenty-one persons, consisting, except two Americans, of English,\nIrish, Swedes and French, but principally the first, who were\nrunaways from the men-of-war and Indiamen, and two from a Botany\nBay ship who had made their escape, for we were obliged to take\nsuch as we could get, served to complete a list of as\naccomplished villains as ever disgraced any country.”",
        "After a month of weary, drenching hardship off the China coast,\nthis crew of cutthroats mutinied. With a loyal handful, including\nthe black cook, Cleveland locked up the provisions, mounted two\nfour-pounders on the quarterdeck, rammed them full of grape-shot,\nand fetched up the flint-lock muskets and pistols from the cabin.\nThe mutineers were then informed that if they poked their heads\nabove the hatches he would blow them overboard. Losing enthusiasm\nand weakened by hunger, they asked to be set ashore; so the\nskipper marooned the lot. For two days the cutter lay offshore\nwhile a truce was argued, the upshot being that four of the\nrascals gave in and the others were left behind.",
        "Fifty days more of it and, washed by icy seas, racked and\nstorm-beaten, the vessel made Norfolk Sound. So small was the\ncrew, so imminent the danger that the Indians might take her by\nboarding, that screens of hides were rigged along the bulwarks to\nhide the deck from view. Stranded and getting clear, warding off\nattacks, Captain Richard Cleveland stayed two months on the\nwilderness coast of Oregon, trading one musket for eight prime\nsea-otter skins until there was no more room below. Sixty\nthousand dollars was the value of the venture when he sailed for\nChina by way of the Sandwich Islands, forty thousand of profit,\nand he was twenty-five years old with the zest for roving\nundiminished.",
        "He next appeared in Calcutta, buying a twenty-five-ton pilot boat\nunder the Danish flag for a fling at Mauritius and a speculation\nin prizes brought in by French privateers. Finding none in port,\nhe loaded seven thousand bags of coffee in a ship for Copenhagen\nand conveyed as a passenger a kindred spirit, young Nathaniel\nShaler, whom he took into partnership. At Hamburg these two\nbought a fast brig, the Lelia Byrd, to try their fortune on the\nwest coast of South America, and recruited a third partner, a\nboyish Polish nobleman, Count de Rousillon, who had been an aide\nto Kosciusko. Three seafaring musketeers, true gentlemen rovers,\nall under thirty, sailing out to beard the viceroys of Spain!",
        "From Valparaiso, where other American ships were detained and\nrobbed, they adroitly escaped and steered north to Mexico and\nCalifornia. At San Diego they fought their way out of the harbor,\nsilencing the Spanish fort with their six guns. Then to Canton\nwith furs, and Richard Cleveland went home at thirty years of age\nafter seven years’ absence and voyaging twice around the world,\nhaving wrested success from almost every imaginable danger and\nobstacle, with $70,000 to make him a rich man in his own town. He\nwas neither more nor less than an American sailor of the kind\nthat made the old merchant marine magnificent.",
        "It was true romance, also, when the first American shipmasters\nset foot in mysterious Japan, a half century before Perry’s\nsquadron shattered the immemorial isolation of the land of the\nShoguns and the Samurai. Only the Dutch had been permitted to\nhold any foreign intercourse whatever with this hermit nation and\nfor two centuries they had maintained their singular commercial\nmonopoly at a price measured in terms of the deepest degradation\nof dignity and respect. The few Dutch merchants suffered to\nreside in Japan were restricted to a small island in Nagasaki\nharbor, leaving it only once in four years when the Resident, or\nchief agent, journeyed to Yeddo to offer gifts and most humble\nobeisance to the Shogun, “creeping forward on his hands and feet,\nand falling on his knees, bowed his head to the ground, and\nretired again in absolute silence, crawling exactly like a crab,\"\nsaid one of these pilgrims who added: “We may not keep Sundays or\nfast days, or allow our spiritual hymns or prayers to be heard;\nnever mention the name of Christ. Besides these things, we have\nto submit to other insulting imputations which are always painful\nto a noble heart. The reason which impels the Dutch to bear all\nthese sufferings so patiently is simply the love of gain.”",
        "In return for these humiliations the Dutch East India Company was\npermitted to send one or two ships a year from Batavia to Japan\nand to export copper, silk, gold, camphor, porcelain, bronze, and\nrare woods. The American ship Franklin arrived at Batavia in 1799\nand Captain James Devereux of Salem learned that a charter was\noffered for one of these annual voyages. After a deal of Yankee\ndickering with the hard-headed Dutchmen, a bargain was struck and\nthe Franklin sailed for Nagasaki with cloves, chintz, sugar, tin,\nblack pepper, sapan wood, and elephants’ teeth. The instructions\nwere elaborate and punctilious, salutes to be fired right and\nleft, nine guns for the Emperor’s guard while passing in,\nthirteen guns at the anchorage; all books on board to be sealed\nup in a cask, Bibles in particular, and turned over to the\nJapanese officials, all firearms sent ashore, ship dressed with\ncolors whenever the “Commissaries of the Chief” graciously came\naboard, and a carpet on deck for them to sit upon.",
        "Two years later, the Margaret of Salem made the same sort of a\nvoyage, and in both instances the supercargoes, one of whom\nhappened to be a younger brother of Captain Richard Cleveland,\nwrote journals of the extraordinary episode. For these mariners\nalone was the curtain lifted which concealed the feudal Japan\nfrom the eyes of the civilized world. Alert and curious, these\nYankee traders explored the narrow streets of Nagasaki, visited\ntemples, were handsomely entertained by officers and merchants,\nand exchanged their wares in the marketplace. They were as much\nat home, no doubt, as when buying piculs of pepper from a rajah\nof Qualah Battoo, or dining with an elderly mandarin of Cochin\nChina. It was not too much to say that “the profuse stores of\nknowledge brought by every ship’s crew, together with unheard of\ncuriosities from every savage shore, gave the community of Salem\na rare alertness of intellect.”",
        "It was a Salem bark, the Lydia, that first displayed the American\nflag to the natives of Guam in 1801. She was chartered by the\nSpanish government of Manila to carry to the Marianne Islands, as\nthose dots on the chart of the Pacific were then called, the new\nGovernor, his family, his suite, and his luggage. First Mate\nWilliam Haswell kept a diary in a most conscientious fashion, and\nhere and there one gleans an item with a humor of its own. “Now\nhaving to pass through dangerous straits,” he observes, “we went\nto work to make boarding nettings and to get our arms in the best\norder, but had we been attacked we should have been taken with\nease. Between Panay and Negros all the passengers were in the\ngreatest confusion for fear of being taken  and put to death in\nthe dark and not have time to say their prayers.”",
        "The decks were in confusion most of the time, what with the\nGovernor, his lady, three children, two servant girls and twelve\nmen servants, a friar and his servant, a judge and two servants,\nnot to mention some small hogs, two sheep, an ox, and a goat to\nfeed the passengers who were too dainty for sea provender. The\nfriar was an interesting character. A great pity that the worthy\nmate of the Lydia should not have been more explicit! It\nintrigues the reader of his manuscript diary to be told that “the\nFriar was praying night and day but it would not bring a fair\nwind. His behavior was so bad that we were forced to send him to\nCoventry, or in other words, no one would speak to him.”",
        "The Spanish governors of Guam had in operation an economic system\nwhich compelled the admiration of this thrifty Yankee mate. The\nnatives wore very few clothes, he concluded, because the Governor\nwas the only shopkeeper and he insisted on a profit of at least\neight hundred per cent. There was a native militia regiment of a\nthousand men who were paid ten dollars a year. With this cash\nthey bought Bengal goods, cottons, Chinese pans, pots, knives,\nand hoes at the Governor’s store, so that “all this money never\nleft the Governor’s hands. It was fetched to him by the galleons\nin passing, and when he was relieved he carried it with him to\nManila, often to the amount of eighty or ninety thousand\ndollars.” A glimpse of high finance without a flaw!",
        "There is pathos, simple and moving, in the stories of shipwreck\nand stranding on hostile or desert coasts. These disasters were\nfar more frequent then than now, because navigation was partly\nguesswork and ships were very small. Among these tragedies was\nthat of the Commerce, bound from Boston to Bombay in 1793. The\ncaptain lost his bearings and thought he was off Malabar when the\nship piled up on the beach in the night. The nearest port was\nMuscat and the crew took to the boats in the hope of reaching it.\nStormy weather drove them ashore where armed Arabs on camels\nstripped them of clothes and stores and left them to die among\nthe sand dunes.",
        "On foot they trudged day after day in the direction of Muscat,\nand how they suffered and what they endured was told by one of\nthe survivors, young Daniel Saunders. Soon they began to drop out\nand die in their tracks in the manner of “Benjamin Williams,\nWilliam Leghorn, and Thomas Barnard whose bodies were exposed\nnaked to the scorching sun and finding their strength and spirits\nquite exhausted they lay down expecting nothing but death for\nrelief.” The next to be left behind was Mr. Robert Williams,\nmerchant and part owner, “and we therefore with reluctance\nabandoned him to the mercy of God, suffering ourselves all the\nhorrors that fill the mind at the approach of death.” Near the\nbeach and a forlorn little oasis, they stumbled across Charles\nLapham, who had become separated from them. He had been without\nwater for five days “and after many efforts he got upon his feet\nand endeavored to walk. Seeing him in so wretched a condition I\ncould not but sympathize enough with him in his torments to go\nback with him” toward water two miles away, “which both my other\ncompanions refused to do. Accordingly they walked forward while I\nwent back a considerable distance with Lapham until, his strength\nfailing him, he suddenly fell on the ground, nor was he able to\nrise again or even speak to me. Finding it vain to stay with him,\nI covered him with sprays and leaves which I tore from an\nadjacent tree, it being the last friendly office I could do him.”",
        "Eight living skeletons left of eighteen strong seamen tottered\ninto Muscat and were cared for by the English consul. Daniel\nSaunders worked his passage to England, was picked up by a\npress-gang, escaped, and so returned to Salem. It was the fate of\nJuba Hill, the black cook from Boston, to be detained among the\nArabs as a slave. It is worth noting that a black sea-cook\nfigured in many of these tales of daring and disaster, and among\nthem was the heroic and amazing figure of one Peter Jackson who\nbelonged in the brig Ceres. While running down the river from\nCalcutta she was thrown on her beam ends and Peter, perhaps\ndumping garbage over the rail, took a header. Among the things\ntossed to him as he floated away was a sail-boom on which he was\nswiftly carried out of sight by the turbid current. All on board\nconcluded that Peter Jackson had been eaten by sharks or\ncrocodiles and it was so reported when they arrived home. An\nadministrator was appointed for his goods and chattels and he was\nofficially deceased in the eyes of the law. A year or so later\nthis unconquerable sea-cook appeared in the streets of Salem,\ngrinning a welcome to former shipmates who fled from him in\nterror as a ghostly visitation. He had floated twelve hours on\nhis sail-boom, it seemed, fighting off the sharks with his feet;\nand finally drifting ashore. “He had hard work to do away with\nthe impressions of being dead,” runs the old account, “but\nsucceeded and was allowed the rights and privileges of the\nliving.”",
        "The community of interests in these voyages of long ago included\nnot only the ship’s company but also the townspeople, even the\nboys and girls, who entrusted their little private speculations\nor “adventures” to the captain. It was a custom which flourished\nwell into the nineteenth century. These memoranda are sprinkled\nthrough the account books of the East Indiamen out of Salem and\nBoston. It might be Miss Harriet Elkins who requested the master\nof the Messenger “please to purchase at Calcutta two net beads\nwith draperies; if at Batavia or any spice market, nutmegs or\nmace; or if at Canton, two Canton shawls of the enclosed colors\nat $5 per shawl. Enclosed is $10.”",
        "Again, it might be Mr. John R. Tucker who ventured in the same\nship one hundred Spanish dollars to be invested in coffee and\nsugar, or Captain Nathaniel West who risked in the Astrea fifteen\nboxes of spermaceti candles and a pipe of Teneriffe wine. It is\ninteresting to discover what was done with Mr. Tucker’s hundred\nSpanish dollars, as invested for him by the skipper of the\nMessenger at Batavia and duly accounted for. Ten bags of coffee\nwere bought for $83.30, the extra expenses of duty, boat-hire,\nand sacking bringing the total outlay to $90.19. The coffee was\nsold at Antwerp on the way home for $183.75, and Mr. Tucker’s\nhandsome profit on the adventure was therefore $93.56, or more\nthan one hundred per cent.",
        "It was all a grand adventure, in fact, and the word was aptly\nchosen to fit this ocean trade. The merchant freighted his ship\nand sent her out to vanish from his ken for months and months of\nwaiting, with the greater part of his savings, perhaps, in goods\nand specie beneath her hatches. No cable messages kept him in\ntouch with her nor were there frequent letters from the master.\nNot until her signal was displayed by the fluttering flags of the\nheadland station at the harbor mouth could he know whether he had\ngained or lost a fortune. The spirit of such merchants was\nadmirably typified in the last venture of Elias Hasket Derby in\n1798, when unofficial war existed between the United States and\nFrance.",
        "American ships were everywhere seeking refuge from the privateers\nunder the tricolor, which fairly ran amuck in the routes of\ntrade. For this reason it meant a rich reward to land a cargo\nabroad. The ship Mount Vernon, commanded by Captain Elias Hasket\nDerby, Jr., was laden with sugar and coffee for Mediterranean\nports, and was prepared for trouble, with twenty guns mounted and\nfifty men to handle them. A smart ship and a powerful one, she\nraced across to Cape Saint Vincent in sixteen days, which was\nclipper speed. She ran into a French fleet of sixty sail,\nexchanged broadsides with the nearest, and showed her stern to\nthe others.",
        "“We arrived at 12 o’clock [wrote Captain Derby from Gibraltar]\npopping at Frenchmen all the forenoon. At 10 A.M. off Algeciras\nPoint we were seriously attacked by a large latineer who had on\nboard more than one hundred men. He came so near our broadside as\nto allow our six-pound grape to do execution handsomely. We then\nbore away and gave him our stern guns in a cool and deliberate\nmanner, doing apparently great execution. Our bars having cut his\nsails considerably, he was thrown into confusion, struck both his\nensign and his pennant. I was then puzzled to know what to do\nwith so many men; our ship was running large with all her\nsteering sails out, so that we could not immediately bring her to\nthe wind, and we were directly off Algeciras Point from whence I\nhad reason to fear she might receive assistance, and my port\nGibraltar in full view. These were circumstances that induced me\nto give up the gratification of bringing him in. It was, however,\na satisfaction to flog the rascal in full view of the English\nfleet who were to leeward.”",
        "Soon after the Revolution the spirit of commercial exploration\nbegan to stir in other ports than Salem. Out from New York sailed\nthe ship Empress of China in 1784 for the first direct voyage to\nCanton, to make the acquaintance of a vast nation absolutely\nunknown to the people of the United States, nor had one in a\nmillion of the industrious and highly civilized Chinese ever so\nmuch as heard the name of the little community of barbarians who\ndwelt on the western shore of the North Atlantic. The oriental\ndignitaries in their silken robes graciously welcomed the\nforeign ship with the strange flag and showed a lively interest\nin the map spread upon the cabin table, offering every facility\nto promote this new market for their silks and teas. After an\nabsence of fifteen months the Empress of China returned to her\nhome port and her pilgrimage aroused so much attention that the\nreport of the supercargo, Samuel Shaw, was read in Congress.",
        "Surpassing this achievement was that of Captain Stewart Dean, who\nvery shortly afterward had his fling at the China trade in an\neighty-ton sloop built at Albany. He was a stout-hearted old\nprivateersman of the Revolution whom nothing could dismay, and in\nthis tiny Experiment of his he won merited fame as one of the\nAmerican pioneers of blue water. Fifteen men and boys sailed with\nhim, drilled and disciplined as if the sloop were a frigate, and\nwhen the Experiment hauled into the stream, of Battery Park, New\nYork, “martial music and the boatswain’s whistle were heard on\nboard with all the pomp and circumstance of war.” Typhoons and\nMalay proas, Chinese pirates and unknown shoals, had no terrors\nfor Stewart Dean. He saw Canton for himself, found a cargo, and\ndrove home again in a four months’ passage, which was better than\nmany a clipper could do at a much later day. Smallest and bravest\nof the first Yankee East Indiamen, this taut sloop, with the\nboatswain’s pipe trilling cheerily and all hands ready with\ncutlases and pikes to repel boarders, was by no means the least\nimportant vessel that ever passed in by Sandy Hook.",
        "In the beginnings of this picturesque relation with the Far East,\nBoston lagged behind Salem, but her merchants, too, awoke to the\nopportunity and so successfully that for generations there were\nno more conspicuous names and shipping-houses in the China trade\nthan those of Russell, Perkins, and Forbes. The first attempt was\nvery ambitious and rather luckless. The largest merchantman ever\nbuilt at that time in the United States was launched at Quincy in\n1789 to rival the towering ships of the British East India\nCompany. This Massachusetts created a sensation. Her departure\nwas a national event. She embodied the dreams of Captain Randall\nand of the Samuel Shaw who had gone as supercargo in the Empress\nof China. They formed a partnership and were able to find the\nnecessary capital.",
        "This six-hundred-ton ship loomed huge in the ayes of the crowds\nwhich visited her. She was in fact no larger than such\nfour-masted coasting schooners as claw around Hatteras with\ndeck-loads of Georgia pine or fill with coal for down East, and\nmanage it comfortably with seven or eight men for a crew. The\nMassachusetts, however, sailed in 411 the old-fashioned state and\ndignity of a master, four mates, a purser, surgeon, carpenter,\ngunner, four quartermasters, three midshipmen, a cooper, two\ncooks, a steward, and fifty seamen. The second officer was Amasa\nDelano, a man even more remarkable than the ship, who wandered\nfar and wide and wrote a fascinating book about his voyages, a\nclassic of its kind, the memoirs of an American merchant mariner\nof a breed long since extinct.",
        "While the Massachusetts was fitting out at Boston, one small\nannoyance ruffled the auspicious undertaking. Three different\ncrews were signed before a full complement could be persuaded to\ntarry in the forecastle. The trouble was caused by a\nfortune-teller of Lynn, Moll Pitcher by name, who predicted\ndisaster for the ship. Now every honest sailor knows that certain\nsuperstitions are gospel fact, such as the bad luck brought by a\ncross-eyed Finn, a black cat, or going to sea on Friday, and\nthese eighteenth century shellbacks must not be too severely\nchided for deserting while they had the chance. As it turned out,\nthe voyage did have a sorry ending and death overtook an\nastonishingly large number of the ship’s people.",
        "Though she had been designed and built by master craftsmen of New\nEngland who knew their trade surpassingly well, it was discovered\nwhen the ship arrived at Canton that her timbers were already\nrotting. They were of white oak which had been put into her green\ninstead of properly seasoned. This blunder wrecked the hopes of\nher owners. To cap it, the cargo of masts and spars had also been\nstowed while wet and covered with mud and ice, and the hatches\nhad been battened. As a result the air became so foul with decay\nthat several hundred barrels of beef were spoiled. To repair the\nship was beyond the means of Captain Randall and Samuel Shaw, and\nreluctantly they sold her to the Danish East India Company at a\nheavy loss. Nothing could have been more unexpected than to find\nthat, for once, the experienced shipbuilders had been guilty of a\nmiscalculation.",
        "The crew scattered, and perhaps the prediction of the\nfortune-teller of Lynn followed their roving courses, for when\nCaptain Amasa Delano tried to trace them a few years later, he\njotted down such obituaries as these on the list of names:",
        " “John Harris. A slave in Algiers at last accounts.\n  Roger Dyer. Died and thrown overboard off Cape Horn.\n  William Williams. Lost overboard off Japan.\n  James Crowley. Murdered by the Chinese near Macao.\n  John Johnson. Died on board an English Indiaman.\n  Seth Stowell. Was drowned at Whampoa in 1790.\n  Jeremiah Chace. Died with the small-pox at Whampoa in 1791.\n  Humphrey Chadburn. Shot and died at Whampoa in 1791.\n  Samuel Tripe. Drowned off Java Head in 1790.\n  James Stackpole. Murdered by the Chinese.\n  Nicholas Nicholson. Died with the leprosy at Macao.\n  William Murphy. Killed by Chinese pirates.\n  Larry Conner. Killed at sea.”",
        "There were more of these gruesome items--so many of them that it\nappears as though no more than a handful of this stalwart crew\nsurvived the Massachusetts by a dozen years. Incredible as it\nsounds, Captain Delano’s roster accounted for fifty of them as\ndead while he was still in the prime of life, and most of them\nhad been snuffed out by violence. As for his own career, it was\novercast by no such unlucky star, and he passed unscathed through\nall the hazards and vicissitudes that could be encountered in\nthat rugged and heroic era of endeavor. Set adrift in Canton when\nthe Massachusetts was sold, he promptly turned his hand to\nrepairing a large Danish ship which had been wrecked by storm,\nand he virtually rebuilt her to the great satisfaction of the\nowners.",
        "Thence, with money in his pocket, young Delano went to Macao,\nwhere he fell in with Commodore John McClure of the English Navy,\nwho was in command of an expedition setting out to explore a part\nof the South Seas, including the Pelew Islands, New Guinea, New\nHolland, and the Spice Islands. The Englishman liked this\nresourceful Yankee seaman and did him the honor to say, recalls\nDelano, “that he considered I should be a very useful man to him\nas a seaman, an officer, or a shipbuilder; and if it was\nagreeable to me to go on board the Panther with him, I should\nreceive the some pay and emoluments with his lieutenants and\nastronomers.” A signal honor it was at a time when no love was\nlost between British and American seafarers who had so recently\nfought each other afloat.",
        "And so Amasa Delano embarked as a lieutenant of the Bombay\nMarine, to explore tropic harbors and goons until then unmapped\nand to parley with dusky kings. Commodore McClure, diplomatic and\nhumane, had almost no trouble with the untutored islanders,\nexcept on the coast of New Guinea, where the Panther was attacked\nby a swarm of canoes and the surgeon was killed. It was a\nspirited little affair, four-foot arrows pelting like hail across\nthe deck, a cannon hurling grapeshot from the taffrail, Amasa\nDelano hit in the chest and pulling out the arrow to jump to his\nduty again.",
        "Only a few years earlier the mutineers of the Bounty had\nestablished themselves on Pitcairn Island, and Delano was able to\ncompile the first complete narrative of this extraordinary\ncolony, which governed itself in the light of the primitive\nChristian virtues. There was profound wisdom in the comment of\nAmasa Delano: “While the present natural, simple, and\naffectionate character prevails among these descendants of the\nmutineers, they will be delightful to our minds, they will be\namiable and acceptable in the sight of God, and they will be\nuseful and happy among themselves. Let it be our fervent prayer\nthat neither canting and hypocritical emissaries from schools of\nartificial theology on the one hand, nor sensual and licentious\ncrews and adventurers on the other, may ever enter the charming\nvillage of Pitcairn to give disease to the minds or the bodies of\nthe unsuspecting inhabitants.”",
        "Two years of this intensely romantic existence, and Delano\nstarted homeward. But there was a chance of profit at Mauritius,\nand there he bought a tremendous East Indiaman of fourteen\nhundred tons as a joint venture with a Captain Stewart and put a\ncrew of a hundred and fifty men on board. She had been brought in\nby a French privateer and Delano was moved to remark, with an\nindignation which was much in advance of his times: “Privateering\nis entirely at variance with the first principle of honorable\nwarfare . . . . This system of licensed robbery enables a wicked\nand mercenary man to insult and injure even neutral friends on\nthe ocean; and when he meets an honest sailor who may have all\nhis earnings on board his ship but who carries an enemy’s flag,\nhe plunders him of every cent and leaves him the poor consolation\nthat it is done according to law . . . . When the Malay subjects\nof Abba Thule cut down the cocoanut trees of an enemy, in the\nspirit of private revenge, he asked them why they acted in\nopposition to the principles on which they knew he always made\nand conducted a war. They answered, and let the reason make us\nhumble, ’The English do so.’”",
        "In his grand East Indiaman young Captain Delano traded on the\ncoast of India but soon came to grief. The enterprise had been\ntoo large for him to swing with what cash and credit he could\nmuster, and the ship was sold from under him to pay her debts.\nAgain on the beach, with one solitary gold moidore in his purse,\nhe found a friendly American skipper who offered him a passage to\nPhiladelphia, which he accepted with the pious reflection that,\nalthough his mind was wounded and mortified by the financial\ndisaster, his motives had been perfectly pure and honest. He\nnever saw his native land with so little pleasure as on this\nreturn to it, he assures us, and the shore on which he would have\nleaped with delight was covered with gloom and sadness.",
        "Now what makes it so well worth while to sketch in brief outline\nthe careers of one and another of these bygone shipmasters is\nthat they accurately reflected the genius and the temper of their\ngeneration. There was, in truth, no such word as failure in their\nlexicon. It is this quality that appeals to us beyond all else.\nThrown on their beam ends, they were presently planning something\nelse, eager to shake dice with destiny and with courage unbroken.\nIt was so with Amasa Delano, who promptly went to work “with what\nspirits I could revive within me. After a time they returned to\ntheir former elasticity.”",
        "He obtained a position as master builder in a shipyard, saved\nsome money, borrowed more, and with one of his brothers was soon\nblithely building a vessel of two hundred tons for a voyage into\nthe Pacific and to the northwest coast after seals. They sailed\nalong Patagonia and found much to interest them, dodged in and\nout of the ports of Chili and Peru, and incidentally recaptured a\nSpanish ship which was in the hands of the slaves who formed her\ncargo.",
        "This was all in the day’s work and happened at the island of\nSanta Maria, not far from Juan Fernandez, where Captain Delano’s\nPerseverance found the high-pooped Tryal in a desperate state.\nSpanish sailors who had survived the massacre were leaping\noverboard or scrambling up to the mastheads while the African\nsavages capered on deck and flourished their weapons. Captain\nDelano liked neither the Spaniard nor the slavetrade, but it was\nhis duty to help fellow seamen in distress; so he cleared for\naction and ordered two boats away to attend to the matter. The\nchief mate, Rufus Low, was in charge, and a gallant sailor he\nshowed himself. They had to climb the high sides of the Tryal and\ncarry, in hand-to-hand conflict, the barricades of water-casks\nand bales of matting which the slaves had built across the deck.\nThere was no hanging back, and even a mite of a midshipman from\nBoston pranced into it with his dirk. The negroes were well armed\nand fought ferociously. The mate was seriously wounded, four\nseamen were stabbed, the Spanish first mate had two musket balls\nin him, and a passenger was killed in the fray.",
        "Having driven the slaves below and battened them down, the\nAmerican party returned next morning to put the irons on them. A\nhorrid sight confronted them. Thirsting for vengeance, the\nSpanish sailors had spread-eagled several of the negroes to\nringbolts in the deck and were shaving the living flesh from them\nwith razor-edged boarding lances. Captain Delano thereupon\ndisarmed these brutes and locked them up in their turn, taking\npossession of the ship until he could restore order. The sequel\nwas that he received the august thanks of the Viceroy of Chili\nand a gold medal from His Catholic Majesty. As was the custom,\nthe guilty slaves, poor wretches, were condemned to be dragged to\nthe gibbet at the tails of mules, to be hanged, their bodies\nburned, and their heads stuck upon poles in the plaza.",
        "It was while in this Chilean port of Talcahuano that Amasa Delano\nheard the tale of the British whaler which had sailed just before\nhis arrival. He tells it so well that I am tempted to quote it as\na generous tribute to a sailor of a rival race. After all, they\nwere sprung from a common stock and blood was thicker than water.\nBesides, it is the sort of yarn that ought to be dragged to the\nlight of day from its musty burial between the covers of Delano’s\nrare and ancient “Voyages and Travels.”",
        "The whaler Betsy, it seems, went in and anchored under the guns\nof the forts to seek provisions and make repairs. The captain\nwent ashore to interview the officials, leaving word that no\nSpaniards should be allowed to come aboard because of the bad\nfeeling against the English. Three or four large boats filled\nwith troops presently veered alongside and were ordered to keep\nclear. This command was resented, and the troops opened fire,\nfollowed by the forts. Now for the deed of a man with his two\nfeet under him.",
        "“The chief officer of the Betsy whose name was Hudson, a man of\nextraordinary bravery, cut his cable and his ship swung the wrong\nway, with her head in shore, passing close to several Spanish\nships which, with every vessel in the harbor that could bring a\ngun to bear, together with three hundred soldiers in boats and on\nship’s decks and the two batteries, all kept up a constant fire\non him. The wind was light, nearly a calm. The shot flew so thick\nthat it was difficult for him to make sail, some part of the\nrigging being cut away every minute.",
        "“He kept his men at the guns, and when the ship swung her\nbroadside so as to bear upon any of the Spanish ships, he kept up\na fire at them. In this situation the brave fellow continued to\nlie for three-quarters of an hour before he got his topsails\nsheeted home. The action continued in this manner for near an\nhour and a half. He succeeded in getting the ship to sea,\nhowever, in defiance of all the force that could be brought\nagainst him. The ship was very much cut to pieces in sails,\nrigging, and hull; and a considerable number of men were killed\nand wounded on board.",
        "“Hudson kept flying from one part of the deck to the other during\nthe whole time of action, encouraging and threatening the men as\noccasion required. He kept a musket in his hand most part of the\ntime, firing when he could find the leisure. Some of the men came\naft and begged him to give up the ship, telling him they should\nall be killed--that the carpenter had all one side of him shot\naway--that one man was cut in halves with a double-headed shot as\nhe was going aloft to loose the foretopsail and the body had\nfallen on deck in two separate parts--that such a man was killed\nat his duty on the forecastle, and one more had been killed in\nthe maintop--that Sam, Jim, Jack, and Tom were wounded and that\nthey would do nothing more towards getting the ship out of the\nharbor.",
        "“His reply to them was, ’then you shall be sure to die, for if\nthey do not kill you I will, so sure as you persist in any such\ncowardly resolution,’ saying at the same time, ’OUT SHE GOES, OR\nDOWN SHE GOES.’”",
        "By this resolute and determined conduct he kept the men to their\nduty and succeeded in accomplishing one of the most daring\nenterprises perhaps ever attempted.",
        "An immortal phrase, this simple dictum of first mate Hudson of\nthe Betsy, “Out she goes, or down she goes,” and not unworthy of\nbeing mentioned in the same breath with Farragut’s “Damn the\ntorpedoes.”",
        "Joined by his brother Samuel in the schooner Pilgrim, which was\nused as a tender in the sealing trade, Amasa Delano frequented\nunfamiliar beaches until he had taken his toll of skins and was\nready to bear away for Canton to sell them. There were many\nYankee ships after seals in those early days, enduring more peril\nand privation than the whalemen, roving over the South Pacific\namong the rock-bound islands unknown to the merchant navigator.\nThe men sailed wholly on shares, a seaman receiving one per cent\nof the catch and the captain ten per cent, and they slaughtered\nthe seal by the million, driving them from the most favored\nhaunts within a few years. For instance, American ships first\nvisited Mas a Fuera in 1797, and Captain Delano estimated that\nduring the seven years following three million skins were taken\nto China from this island alone. He found as many as fourteen\nvessels there at one time, and he himself carried away one\nhundred thousand skins. It was a gold mine for profit while it\nlasted.",
        "There were three Delano brothers afloat in two vessels, and of\ntheir wanderings Amasa set down this epitome: “Almost the whole\nof our connections who were left behind had need of our\nassistance, and to look forward it was no more than a reasonable\ncalculation to make that our absence would not be less than three\nyears . . . together with the extraordinary uncertainty of the\nissue of the voyage, as we had nothing but our hands to depend\nupon to obtain a cargo which was only to be done through storms,\ndangers, and breakers, and taken from barren rocks in distant\nregions. But after a voyage of four years for one vessel and five\nfor the other, we were all permitted to return safe home to our\nfriends and not quite empty-handed. We had built both of the\nvessels we were in and navigated them two and three times around\nthe globe.” Each one of the brothers had been a master builder\nand rigger and a navigator of ships in every part of the world.",
        "By far the most important voyage undertaken by American\nmerchantmen during the decade of brilliant achievement following\nthe Revolution was that of Captain Robert Gray in the Columbia,\nwhich was the first ship to visit and explore the northwest coast\nand to lead the way for such adventurers as Richard Cleveland and\nAmasa Delano. On his second voyage in 1792, Captain Gray\ndiscovered the great river he christened Columbia and so gave to\nthe United States its valid title to that vast territory which\nLewis and Clark were to find after toiling over the mountains\nthirteen years later.",
        "When the first Congress under the new Federal Constitution\nassembled in 1789, a spirit of pride was manifested in the swift\nrecovery and the encouraging growth of the merchant marine,\ntogether with a concerted determination to promote and protect it\nby means of national legislation. The most imperative need was a\nseries of retaliatory measures to meet the burdensome navigation\nlaws of England, to give American ships a fair field and no\nfavors. The Atlantic trade was therefore stimulated by allowing a\nreduction of ten per cent of the customs duties on goods imported\nin vessels built and owned by American citizens. The East India\ntrade, which already employed forty New England ships, was\nfostered in like manner. Teas brought direct under the American\nflag paid an average duty of twelve cents a pound while teas in\nforeign bottoms were taxed twenty-seven cents. It was sturdy\nprotection, for on a cargo of one hundred thousand pounds of\nassorted teas from India or China, a British ship would pay\n$27,800 into the custom house and a Salem square-rigger only\n$10,980.",
        "The result was that the valuable direct trade with the Far East\nwas absolutely secured to the American flag. Not content with\nthis, Congress decreed a system of tonnage duties which permitted\nthe native owner to pay six cents per ton on his vessel while the\nforeigner laid down fifty cents as an entry fee for every ton his\nship measured, or thirty cents if he owned an American-built\nvessel. In 1794, Congress became even more energetic in defense\nof its mariners and increased the tariff rates on merchandise in\nforeign vessels. A nation at last united, jealous of its rights,\nresentful of indignities long suffered, and intelligently alive\nto its shipping as the chief bulwark of prosperity, struck back\nwith peaceful weapons and gained a victory of incalculable\nadvantage. Its Congress, no longer feeble and divided, laid the\nfoundations for American greatness upon the high seas which was\nto endure for more than a half century. Wars, embargoes, and\nconfiscations might interrupt but they could not seriously harm\nit.",
        "In the three years after 1789 the merchant shipping registered\nfor the foreign trade increased from 123,893 tons to 411,438\ntons, presaging a growth without parallel in the history of the\ncommercial world. Foreign ships were almost entirely driven out\nof American ports, and ninety-one per cent of imports and\neighty-six per cent of exports were conveyed in vessels built and\nmanned by Americans. Before Congress intervened, English\nmerchantmen had controlled three-fourths of our commerce\noverseas. When Thomas Jefferson, as Secretary of State, fought\ndown Southern opposition to a retaliatory shipping policy, he\nuttered a warning which his countrymen were to find still true\nand apt in the twentieth century: “If we have no seamen, our\nships will be useless, consequently our ship timber, iron, and\nhemp; our shipbuilding will be at an end; ship carpenters will go\nover to other nations; our young men have no call to the sea; our\nproducts, carried in foreign bottoms, will be saddled with\nwar-freight and insurance in time of war--and the history of the\nlast hundred years shows that the nation which is our carrier has\nthree years of war for every four years of peace.”",
        "The steady growth of an American merchant marine was interrupted\nonly once in the following decade. In the year 1793 war broke out\nbetween England and France. A decree of the National Convention\nof the French Republic granted neutral vessels the same rights as\nthose which flew the tricolor. This privilege reopened a rushing\ntrade with the West Indies, and hundreds of ships hastened from\nAmerican ports to Martinique, Guadeloupe, and St. Lucia.",
        "Like a thunderbolt came the tidings that England refused to look\nupon this trade with the French colonies as neutral and that her\ncruisers had been told to seize all vessels engaged in it and to\nsearch them for English-born seamen. This ruling was enforced\nwith such barbarous severity that it seemed as if the War for\nIndependence had been fought in vain. Without warning, unable to\nsave themselves, great fleets of Yankee merchantmen were\nliterally swept from the waters of the West Indies. At St.\nEustatius one hundred and thirty of them were condemned. The\njudges at Bermuda condemned eleven more. Crews and passengers\nwere flung ashore without food or clothing, were abused,\ninsulted, or perhaps impressed in British privateers. The ships\nwere lost to their owners. There was no appeal and no redress. At\nMartinique an English fleet and army captured St. Pierre in\nFebruary, 1794. Files of marines boarded every American ship in\nthe harbor, tore down the colors, and flung two hundred and fifty\nseamen into the foul holds of a prison hulk. There they were\nkept, half-dead with thirst and hunger while their vessels,\nuncared for, had stranded or sunk at their moorings. Scores of\noutrages as abominable as this were on record in the office of\nthe Secretary of State. Shipmasters were afraid to sail to the\nsouthward and, for lack of these markets for dried cod, the\nfishing schooners of Marblehead were idle.",
        "For a time a second war with England seemed imminent. An alarmed\nCongress passed laws to create a navy and to fortify the most\nimportant American harbors. President Washington recommended an\nembargo of thirty days, which Congress promptly voted and then\nextended for thirty more. It was a popular measure and strictly\nenforced by the mariners themselves. The mates and captains of\nthe brigs and snows in the Delaware River met and resolved not to\ngo to sea for another ten days, swearing to lie idle sooner than\nfeed the British robbers in the West Indies. It was in the midst\nof these demonstrations that Washington seized the one hope of\npeace and recommended a special mission to England.",
        "The treaty negotiated by John Jay in 1794 was received with an\noutburst of popular indignation. Jay was damned as a traitor,\nwhile the sailors of Portsmouth burned him in effigy. By way of\nan answer to the terms of the obnoxious treaty, a seafaring mob\nin Boston raided and burned the British privateer Speedwell,\nwhich had put into that port as a merchantman with her guns and\nmunitions hidden beneath a cargo of West India produce.",
        "The most that can be said of the commercial provisions of the\ntreaty is that they opened direct trade with the East Indies but\nat the price of complete freedom of trade for British shipping in\nAmerican ports. It must be said, too, that although the treaty\nfailed to clear away the gravest cause of hostility--the right of\nsearch and impressment--yet it served to postpone the actual\ndash, and during the years in which it was in force American\nshipping splendidly prospered, freed of most irksome handicaps.",
        "The quarrel with France had been brewing at the same time and for\nsimilar reasons. Neutral trade with England was under the ban,\nand the Yankee shipmaster was in danger of losing his vessel if\nhe sailed to or from a port under the British flag. It was out of\nthe frying-pan into the fire, and French privateers welcomed the\nexcuse to go marauding in the Atlantic and the Caribbean. What it\nmeant to fight off these greedy cutthroats is told in a newspaper\naccount of the engagement of Captain Richard Wheatland, who was\nhomeward bound to Salem in the ship Perseverance in 1799. He was\nin the Old Straits of Bahama when a fast schooner came up astern,\nshowing Spanish colors and carrying a tremendous press of canvas.\nUnable to run away from her, Captain Wheatland reported to his\nowners:",
        "“We took in steering sails, wore ship, hauled up our courses,\npiped all hands to quarters and prepared for action. The schooner\nimmediately took in sail, hoisted an English Union flag and\npassed under our lee at a considerable distance. We wore ship,\nshe did the same, and we passed each other within half a musket.\nA fellow hailed us in broken English and ordered the boat hoisted\nout and the captain to come aboard, which he refused. He again\nordered our boat out and enforced his orders with a menace that\nin case of refusal he would sink us, using at the same time the\nvilest and most infamous language it is possible to conceive of.\n. . . We hauled the ship to wind and as he passed poured a whole\nbroadside into him with great success. Sailing faster than we, he\nranged considerably ahead, tacked and again passed, giving us a\nbroadside and furious discharge of musketry, which he kept up\nincessantly until the latter part of the engagement. His musket\nballs reached us in every direction but his large shot either\nfell short or went considerably over us while our guns loaded\nwith round shot and square bars of iron were plied so briskly and\ndirected with such good judgment that before he got out of range\nwe had cut his mainsail and foretopsail all to rags and cleared\nhis decks so effectively that when he bore away from us there\nwere scarcely ten men to be seen. He then struck his English flag\nand hoisted the flag of The Terrible Republic and made off with\nall the sail he could carry, much disappointed, no doubt, at not\nbeing able to give us a fraternal embrace. We feel confidence\nthat we have rid the world of some infamous pests of society.”",
        "By this time, the United States was engaged in active hostilities\nwith France, although war had not been declared. The news of the\nindignities which American commissions had suffered at the hands\nof the French Directory had stirred the people to war pitch.\nStrong measures for national defense were taken, which stopped\nlittle short of war. The country rallied to the slogan, “Millions\nfor defense but not one cent for tribute,” and the merchants of\nthe seaports hastened to subscribe funds to build frigates to be\nloaned to the Government. Salem launched the famous Essex, ready\nfor sea six months after the keel was laid, at a cost of $75,000.\nHer two foremost merchants, Elias Hasket Derby and William Gray,\nled the list with ten thousand dollars each. The call sent out by\nthe master builder, Enos Briggs, rings with thrilling effect:",
        "“To Sons of Freedom! All true lovers of Liberty of your Country!\nStep forth and give your assistance in building the frigate to\noppose French insolence and piracy. Let every man in possession\nof a white oak tree be ambitious to be foremost in hurrying down\nthe timber to Salem where the noble structure is to be fabricated\nto maintain your rights upon the seas and make the name of\nAmerica respected among the nations of the world. Your largest\nand longest trees are wanted, and the arms of them for knees and\nrising timber. Four trees are wanted for the keel which\naltogether will measure 146 feet in length, and hew sixteen\ninches square.”",
        "This handsome frigate privately built by patriots of the republic\nilluminates the coastwise spirit and conditions of her time. She\nwas a Salem ship from keel to truck. Captain Jonathan Haraden,\nthe finest privateersman of the Revolution, made the rigging for\nthe mainmast at his ropewalk in Brown Street. Joseph Vincent\nfitted out the foremast and Thomas Briggs the mizzenmast in their\nlofts at the foot of the Common. When the huge hemp cables were\nready for the frigate, the workmen carried them to the shipyard\non their shoulders, the parade led by fife and drum. Her sails\nwere cut from duck woven in Daniel Rust’s factory in Broad Street\nand her iron work was forged by Salem shipsmiths. It was not\nsurprising that Captain Richard Derby was chosen to command the\nEssex, but he was abroad in a ship of his own and she sailed\nunder Captain Edward Preble of the Navy.",
        "The war cloud passed and the merchant argosies overflowed the\nwharves and havens of New England, which had ceased to monopolize\nthe business on blue water. New York had become a seaport with\nlong ranks of high-steeved bowsprits soaring above pleasant\nBattery Park and a forest of spars extending up the East River.\nIn 1790 more than two thousand ships, brigs, schooners, and\nsmaller craft had entered and cleared, and the merchants met in\nthe coffee-houses to discuss charters, bills-of-lading, and\nadventures. Sailors commanded thrice the wages of laborers\nashore. Shipyards were increasing and the builders could build as\nlarge and swift East Indiamen as those of which Boston and Salem\nboasted.",
        "Philadelphia had her Stephen Girard, whose wealth was earned in\nships, a man most remarkable and eccentric, whose career was one\nof the great maritime romances. Though his father was a\nprosperous merchant of Bordeaux engaged in the West India trade,\nhe was shifting for himself as a cabin-boy on his father’s ships\nwhen only fourteen years old. With no schooling, barely able to\nread and write, this urchin sailed between Bordeaux and the\nFrench West Indies for nine years, until he gained the rank of\nfirst mate. At the age of twenty-six he entered the port of\nPhiladelphia in command of a sloop which had narrowly escaped\ncapture by British frigates. There he took up his domicile and\nlaid the foundation of his fortune in small trading ventures to\nNew Orleans and Santo Domingo.",
        "In 1791 he began to build a fleet of beautiful ships for the\nChina and India trade, their names, Montesquieu, Helvetius,\nVoltaire, and Rousseau, revealing his ideas of religion and\nliberty. So successfully did he combine banking and shipping that\nin 1813 he was believed to be the wealthiest merchant in the\nUnited States. In that year one of his ships from China was\ncaptured off the Capes of the Delaware by a British privateer.\nHer cargo of teas, nankeens, and silks was worth half a million\ndollars to him but he succeeded in ransoming it on the spot by\ncounting out one hundred and eighty thousand Spanish milled\ndollars. No privateersman could resist such strategy as this.",
        "Alone in his old age, without a friend or relative to close his\neyes in death, Stephen Girard, once a penniless, ignorant French\ncabin-boy, bequeathed his millions to philanthropy, and the\nGirard College for orphan boys, in Philadelphia, is his monument.",
        "The Treaty of Amiens brought a little respite to Europe and a\npeaceful interlude for American shipmasters, but France and\nEngland came to grips again in 1803. For two years thereafter the\nUnited States was almost the only important neutral nation not\ninvolved in the welter of conflict on land and sea, and trade\neverywhere sought the protection of the Stars and Stripes.\nEngland had swept her own rivals, men-of-war and merchantmen,\nfrom the face of the waters. France and Holland ceased to carry\ncargoes beneath their own ensigns. Spain was afraid to send her\ngalleons to Mexico and Peru. All the Continental ports were\nbegging for American ships to transport their merchandise. It was\na maritime harvest unique and unexpected.",
        "Yankee skippers were dominating the sugar trade of Cuba and were\nrolling across the Atlantic with the coffee, hides, and indigo of\nVenezuela and Brazil. Their fleets crowded the roadsteads of\nManila and Batavia and packed the warehouses of Antwerp, Lisbon,\nand Hamburg. It was a situation which England could not tolerate\nwithout attempting to thwart an immense traffic which she\nconstrued as giving aid and comfort to her enemies. Under cover\nof the so-called Rule of 1756 British admiralty courts began to\ncondemn American vessels carrying products from enemies’ colonies\nto Europe, even when the voyage was broken by first entering an\nAmerican port. It was on record in September, 1805, that fifty\nAmerican ships had been condemned in England and as many more in\nthe British West Indies.",
        "This was a trifling disaster, however, compared with the huge\ncalamity which befell when Napoleon entered Berlin as a conqueror\nand proclaimed his paper blockade of the British Isles. There was\nno French navy to enforce it, but American vessels dared not sail\nfor England lest they be snapped up by French privateers. The\nBritish Government savagely retaliated with further prohibitions,\nand Napoleon countered in like manner until no sea was safe for a\nneutral ship and the United States was powerless to assert its\nrights. Thomas Jefferson as President used as a weapon the\nEmbargo of 1807, which was, at first, a popular measure, and\nwhich he justified in these pregnant sentences: “The whole world\nis thus laid under interdict by these two nations, and our own\nvessels, their cargoes, and crews, are to be taken by the one or\nthe other for whatever place they may be destined out of our\nlimits. If, therefore, on leaving our harbors we are certainly to\nlose them, is it not better as to vessels, cargoes, and seamen,\nto keep them at home?”",
        "A people proud, independent, and pugnacious, could not long\nsubmit to a measure of defense which was, in the final sense, an\nabject surrender to brute force. New England, which bore the\nbrunt of the embargo, was first to rebel against it. Sailors\nmarched through the streets clamoring for bread or loaded their\nvessels and fought their way to sea. In New York the streets of\nthe waterside were deserted, ships dismantled, countinghouses\nunoccupied, and warehouses empty. In one year foreign commerce\ndecreased in value from $108,000,000 to $22,000,000.",
        "After fifteen months Congress repealed the law, substituting a\nNon-Intercourse Act which suspended trade with Great Britain and\nFrance until their offending orders were repealed. All such\nmeasures were doomed to be futile. Words and documents, threats\nand arguments could not intimidate adversaries who paid heed to\nnothing else than broadsides from line-of-battle ships or the\ncharge of battalions. With other countries trade could now be\nopened. Hopefully the hundreds of American ships long pent-up in\nharbor winged it deep-laden for the Baltic, the North Sea, and\nthe Mediterranean. But few of them ever returned. Like a brigand,\nNapoleon lured them into a trap and closed it, advising the\nPrussian Government, which was under his heel: “Let the American\nships enter your ports. Seize them afterward. You shall deliver\nthe cargoes to me and I will take them in part payment of the\nPrussian war debt.”",
        "Similar orders were executed wherever his mailed fist reached,\nthe pretext being reprisal for the Non-Intercourse Act. More than\ntwo hundred American vessels were lost to their owners, a\nten-million-dollar robbery for which France paid an indemnity of\nfive millions after twenty years. It was the grand climax of the\nexploitation which American commerce had been compelled to endure\nthrough two centuries of tumult and bloodshed afloat. There\nlingers today in many a coastwise town an inherited dislike for\nFrance. It is a legacy of that far-off catastrophe which beggared\nmany a household and filled the streets with haggard, broken\nshipmasters.",
        "It was said of this virile merchant marine that it throve under\npillage and challenged confiscation. Statistics confirm this\nbrave paradox. In 1810, while Napoleon was doing his worst, the\ndeep-sea tonnage amounted to 981,019; and it is a singular fact\nthat in proportion to population this was to stand as the high\ntide of American foreign shipping until thirty-seven years later.\nIt ebbed during the War of 1812 but rose again with peace and a\nreal and lasting freedom of the seas.",
        "This second war with England was fought in behalf of merchant\nseamen and they played a nobly active part in it. The ruthless\nimpressment of seamen was the most conspicuous provocation, but\nit was only one of many. Two years before hostilities were openly\ndeclared, British frigates were virtually blockading the port of\nNew York, halting and searching ships as they pleased, making\nprizes of those with French destinations, stealing sailors to\nfill their crews, waging war in everything but name, and enjoying\nthe sport of it. A midshipman of one of them merrily related:\n\"Every morning at daybreak we set about arresting the progress of\nall the vessels we saw, firing off guns to the right and left to\nmake every ship that was running in heave to or wait until we had\nleisure to send a boat on board to see, in our lingo, what she\nwas made of. I have frequently known a dozen and sometimes a\ncouple of dozen ships lying a league or two off the port, losing\ntheir fair wind, their tide, and worse than all, their market for\nmany hours, sometimes the whole day, before our search was\ncompleted.”",
        "The right of a belligerent to search neutral vessels for\ncontraband of war or evidence of a forbidden destination was not\nthe issue at stake. This was a usage sanctioned by such\ninternational law as then existed. It was the alleged right to\nsearch for English seamen in neutral vessels that Great Britain\nexercised, not only on the high seas but even in territorial\nwaters, which the American Government refused to recognize. In\nvain the Government had endeavored to protect its sailors from\nimpressment by means of certificates of birth and citizenship.\nThese documents were jeered at by the English naval lieutenant\nand his boarding gang, who kidnapped from the forecastle such\nstalwart tars as pleased their fancy. The victim who sought to\ninform an American consul of his plight was lashed to the rigging\nand flogged by a boatswain’s mate. The files of the State\nDepartment, in 1807, had contained the names of six thousand\nAmerican sailors who were as much slaves and prisoners aboard\nBritish men-of-war as if they had been made captives by the Dey\nof Algiers. One of these incidents, occurring on the ship Betsy,\nCaptain Nathaniel Silsbee, while at Madras in 1795, will serve to\nshow how this brutal business was done.",
        "“I received a note early one morning from my chief mate that one\nof my sailors, Edward Hulen, a fellow townsman whom I had known\nfrom boyhood, had been impressed and taken on board of a British\nfrigate then being in port .... I immediately went on board my\nship and having there learned all the facts in the case,\nproceeded to the frigate, where I found Hulen and in his presence\nwas informed by the first lieutenant of the frigate that he had\ntaken Hulen from my ship under a peremptory order from his\ncommander to visit every American ship in port and take from each\nof them one or more of their seamen .... I then called upon\nCaptain Cook, who commanded the frigate, and sought first by all\nthe persuasive means that I was capable of using and ultimately\nby threats to appeal to the Government of the place to obtain\nHulen’s release, but in vain . . . . It remained for me only to\nrecommend Hulen to that protection of the lieutenant which a good\nseaman deserves, and to submit to the high-handed insult thus\noffered to the flag of my country which I had no means either of\npreventing or resisting.”",
        "After several years’ detention in the British Navy, Hulen\nreturned to Salem and lived to serve on board privateers in the\nsecond war with England.",
        "Several years’ detention! This was what it meant to be a pressed\nman, perhaps with wife and children at home who had no news of\nhim nor any wages to support them. At the time of the Nore Mutiny\nin 1797, there were ships in the British fleet whose men had not\nbeen paid off for eight, ten, twelve, and in one instance fifteen\nyears. These wooden walls of England were floating hells, and a\nseaman was far better off in jail. He was flogged if he sulked\nand again if he smiled flogged until the blood ran for a hundred\noffenses as trivial as these. His food was unspeakably bad and\noften years passed before he was allowed to set foot ashore.\nDecent men refused to volunteer and the ships were filled with\nthe human scum and refuse caught in the nets of the press-gangs\nof Liverpool, London, and Bristol.",
        "It is largely forgotten or unknown that this system of recruiting\nwas as intolerable in England as it was in the United States and\nas fiercely resented. Oppressive and unjust, it was nevertheless\nendured as the bulwark of England’s defense against her foes. It\nground under its heel the very people it protected and made them\nserfs in order to keep them free. No man of the common people who\nlived near the coast of England was safe from the ruffianly\npress-gangs nor any merchant ship that entered her ports. It was\nthe most cruel form of conscription ever devised. Mob violence\nopposed it again and again, and British East Indiamen fought the\nKing’s tenders sooner than be stripped of their crews and left\nhelpless. Feeling in America against impressment was never more\nhighly inflamed, even on the brink of the War of 1812, than it\nhad long been in England itself, although the latter country was\nunable to rise and throw it off. Here are the words, not of an\nangry American patriot but of a modern English historian writing\nof his own nation:* “To the people the impress was an axe laid at\nthe foot of the tree. There was here no question, as with trade,\nof the mere loss of hands who could be replaced. Attacking the\nfamily in the person of its natural supporter and protector, the\noctopus system of which the gangs were the tentacles, struck at\nthe very foundations of domestic life and brought to thousands of\nhouseholds a poverty as bitter and a grief as poignant as death.\n. . . The mutiny at the Nore brought the people face to face with\nthe appalling risks attendant on wholesale pressing while the war\nwith America, incurred for the sole purpose of upholding the\nright to press, taught them the lengths to which their rulers\nwere still prepared to go in order to enslave them.\"*",
        "* The Press Gang Afloat and Ashore, by J. R. Hutchinson.",
        "American privateering in 1812 was even bolder and more successful\nthan during the Revolution. It was the work of a race of merchant\nseamen who had found themselves, who were in the forefront of the\nworld’s trade and commerce, and who were equipped to challenge\nthe enemy’s pretensions to supremacy afloat. Once more there was\na mere shadow of a navy to protect them, but they had learned to\ntrust their own resources. They would send to sea fewer of the\nsmall craft, slow and poorly armed, and likely to meet disaster.\nThey were capable of manning what was, in fact, a private navy\ncomprised of fast and formidable cruisers. The intervening\ngeneration had advanced the art of building and handling ships\nbeyond all rivalry, and England grudgingly acknowledged their\nability. The year of 1812 was indeed but a little distance from\nthe resplendent modern era of the Atlantic packet and the Cape\nHorn clipper.",
        "Already these Yankee deep-water ships could be recognized afar by\ntheir lofty spars and snowy clouds of cotton duck beneath which\nthe slender hull was a thin black line. Far up to the gleaming\nroyals they carried sail in winds so strong that the lumbering\nEnglish East Indiamen were hove to or snugged down to reefed\ntopsails. It was not recklessness but better seamanship. The\ndeeds of the Yankee privateers of 1812 prove this assertion to\nthe hilt. Their total booty amounted to thirteen hundred prizes\ntaken over all the Seven Seas, with a loss to England of forty\nmillion dollars in ships and cargoes. There were, all told, more\nthan five hundred of them in commission, but New England no\nlonger monopolized this dashing trade. Instead of Salem it was\nBaltimore that furnished the largest fleet--fifty-eight vessels,\nmany of them the fast ships and schooners which were to make the\nport famous as the home of the Baltimore clipper model. All down\nthe coast, out of Norfolk, Wilmington, Charleston, Savannah, and\nNew Orleans, sallied the privateers to show that theirs was, in\ntruth, a seafaring nation ardently united in a common cause.",
        "Again and more vehemently the people of England raised their\nvoices in protest and lament, for these saucy sea-raiders fairly\nromped to and fro in the Channel, careless of pursuit, conducting\na blockade of their own until London was paying the famine price\nof fifty-eight dollars a barrel for flour, and it was publicly\ndeclared mortifying and distressing that “a horde of American\ncruisers should be allowed, unresisted and unmolested, to take,\nburn, or sink our own vessels in our own inlets and almost in\nsight of our own harbors.” It was Captain Thomas Boyle in the\nChasseur of Baltimore who impudently sent ashore his proclamation\nof a blockade of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,\nwhich he requested should be posted in Lloyd’s Coffee House.",
        "A wonderfully fine figure of a fighting seaman was this Captain\nBoyle, with an Irish sense of humor which led him to haunt the\nenemy’s coast and to make sport of the frigates which tried to\ncatch him. His Chasseur was considered one of the ablest\nprivateers of the war and the most beautiful vessel ever seen in\nBaltimore. A fleet and graceful schooner with a magical turn for\nspeed, she mounted sixteen long twelve-pounders and carried a\nhundred officers, seamen, and marines, and was never outsailed in\nfair winds or foul. “Out of sheer wantonness,” said an admirer,\n\"she sometimes affected to chase the enemy’s men-of-war of far\nsuperior force.” Once when surrounded by two frigates and two\nnaval brigs, she slipped through and was gone like a phantom.\nDuring his first cruise in the Chasseur, Captain Boyle captured\neighteen valuable merchantmen. It was such defiant rovers as he\nthat provoked the “Morning Chronicle” of London to splutter “that\nthe whole coast of Ireland from Wexford round by Cape Clear\nto Carrickfergus, should have been for above a month under the\nunresisted domination of a few petty fly-by-nights from the\nblockaded ports of the United States is a grievance equally\nintolerable and disgraceful.”",
        "This was when the schooner Syren had captured His Majesty’s\ncutter Landrail while crossing the Irish Sea with dispatches;\nwhen the Governor Tompkins burned fourteen English vessels in the\nEnglish Channel in quick succession; when the Harpy of Baltimore\ncruised for three months off the Irish and English coasts and in\nthe Bay of Biscay, and returned to Boston filled with spoils,\nincluding a half million dollars of money; when the Prince de\nNeuchatel hovered at her leisure in the Irish Channel and made\ncoasting trade impossible; and when the Young Wasp of\nPhiladelphia cruised for six months in those same waters.",
        "Two of the privateers mentioned were first-class fighting ships\nwhose engagements were as notable, in their way, as those of the\nAmerican frigates which made the war as illustrious by sea as it\nwas ignominious by land. While off Havana in 1815, Captain Boyle\nmet the schooner St. Lawrence of the British Navy, a fair match\nin men and guns. The Chasseur could easily have run away but\nstood up to it and shot the enemy to pieces in fifteen minutes.\nBrave and courteous were these two commanders, and Lieutenant\nGordon of the St. Lawrence gave his captor a letter which read,\nin part: “In the event of Captain Boyle’s becoming a prisoner of\nwar to any British cruiser I consider it a tribute justly due to\nhis humane and generous treatment of myself, the surviving\nofficers, and crew of His Majesty’s late schooner St. Lawrence,\nto state that his obliging attention and watchful solicitude to\npreserve our effects and render us comfortable during the short\ntime we were in his possession were such as justly entitle him to\nthe indulgence and respect of every British subject.”",
        "The Prince de Neuchatel had the honor of beating off the attack\nof a forty-gun British frigate--an exploit second only to that of\nthe General Armstrong in the harbor of Fayal. This privateer with\na foreign name hailed from New York and was so fortunate as to\ncapture for her owners three million dollars’ worth of British\nmerchandise. With Captain J. Ordronaux on the quarterdeck, she\nwas near Nantucket Shoals at noon on October 11, 1814, when a\nstrange sail was discovered. As this vessel promptly gave chase,\nCaptain Ordronaux guessed-and as events proved correctly--that\nshe must be a British frigate. She turned out to be the Endymion.\nThe privateer had in tow a prize which she was anxious to get\ninto port, but she was forced to cast off the hawser late in the\nafternoon and make every effort to escape.",
        "The breeze died with the sun and the vessels were close inshore.\nBecalmed, the privateer and the frigate anchored a quarter of a\nmile apart. Captain Ordronaux might have put his crew on the\nbeach in boats and abandoned his ship. This was the reasonable\ncourse, for, as he had sent in several prize crews, he was\nshort-handed and could muster no more than thirty-seven men and\nboys. The Endymion, on the other hand, had a complement of three\nhundred and fifty sailors and marines, and in size and fighting\npower she was in the class of the American frigates President and\nConstitution. Quite unreasonably, however, the master of the\nprivateer decided to await events.",
        "The unexpected occurred shortly after dusk when several boats\nloaded to the gunwales with a boarding party crept away from the\nfrigate. Five of them, with one hundred and twenty men, made a\nconcerted attack at different points, alongside and under the bow\nand stern. Captain Ordronaux had told his crew that he would blow\nup the ship with all hands before striking his colors, and they\nbelieved him implicitly. This was the hero who was described as\n\"a Jew by persuasion, a Frenchman by birth, an American for\nconvenience, and so diminutive in stature as to make him appear\nridiculous, in the eyes of others, even for him to enforce\nauthority among a hardy, weatherbeaten crew should they do aught\nagainst his will.” He was big enough, nevertheless, for this\nnight’s bloody work, and there was no doubt about his authority.\nWhile the British tried to climb over the bulwarks, his\nthirty-seven men and boys fought like raging devils, with knives,\npistols, cutlases, with their bare fists and their teeth. A few\nof the enemy gained the deck, but the privateersmen turned and\nkilled them. Others leaped aboard and were gradually driving the\nAmericans back, when the skipper ran to the hatch above the\npowder magazine, waving a lighted match and swearing to drop it\nin if his crew retreated one step further. Either way the issue\nseemed desperate. But again they took their skipper’s word for it\nand rallied for a bloody struggle which soon swept the decks.",
        "No more than twenty minutes had passed and the battle was won.\nThe enemy was begging for quarter. One boat had been sunk, three\nhad drifted away filled with dead and wounded, and the fifth was\ncaptured with thirty-six men in it of whom only eight were\nunhurt. The American loss was seven killed and twenty-four\nwounded, or thirty-one of her crew of thirty-seven. Yet they had\nnot given up the ship. The frigate Endymion concluded that once\nwas enough, and next morning the Prince de Neuchatel bore away\nfor Boston with a freshening breeze.",
        "Those were merchant seamen also who held the General Armstrong\nagainst a British squadron through that moonlit night in Fayal\nRoads, inflicting heavier losses than were suffered in any naval\naction of the war. It is a story Homeric, almost incredible in\nits details and so often repeated that it can be only touched\nupon in this brief chronicle. The leader was a kindly featured\nman who wore a tall hat, side-whiskers, and a tail coat. His\nportrait might easily have served for that of a New England\ndeacon of the old school. No trace of the swashbuckler in this\nCaptain Samuel Reid, who had been a thrifty, respected merchant\nskipper until offered the command of a privateer.",
        "Touching at the Azores for water and provisions in September,\n1814, he was trapped in port by the great seventy-four-gun ship\nof the line Plantagenet, the thirty-eight-gun frigate Rota, and\nthe warbrig Carnation. Though he was in neutral water, they paid\nno heed to this but determined to destroy a Yankee schooner which\nhad played havoc with their shipping. Four hundred men in twelve\nboats, with a howitzer in the bow of each boat, were sent against\nthe General Armstrong in one flotilla. But not a man of the four\nhundred gained her deck. Said an eyewitness: “The Americans\nfought with great firmness but more like bloodthirsty savages\nthan anything else. They rushed into the boats sword in hand and\nput every soul to death as far as came within their power. Some\nof the boats were left without a single man to row them, others\nwith three or four. The most that any one returned with was about\nten. Several boats floated ashore full of dead bodies . . . . For\nthree days after the battle we were employed in burying the dead\nthat washed on shore in the surf.”",
        "This tragedy cost the British squadron one hundred and twenty men\nin killed and one hundred and thirty in wounded, while Captain\nReid lost only two dead and had seven wounded. He was compelled\nto retreat ashore next day when the ships stood in to sink his\nschooner with their big guns, but the honors of war belonged to\nhim and well-earned were the popular tributes when he saw home\nagain, nor was there a word too much in the florid toast:\n\"Captain Reid--his valor has shed a blaze of renown upon the\ncharacter of our seamen, and won for himself a laurel of eternal\nbloom.”",
        "It is not to glorify war nor to rekindle an ancient feud that\nsuch episodes as these are recalled to mind. These men, and\nothers like them, did their duty as it came to them, and they\nwere sailors of whom the whole Anglo-Saxon race might be proud.\nIn the crisis they were Americans, not privateersmen in quest of\nplunder, and they would gladly die sooner than haul down the\nStars and Stripes. The England against which they fought was not\nthe England of today. Their honest grievances, inflicted by a\nGovernment too intent upon crushing Napoleon to be fair to\nneutrals, have long ago been obliterated. This War of 1812\ncleared the vision of the Mother Country and forever taught her\nGovernment that the people of the Republic were, in truth, free\nand independent.",
        "This lesson was driven home not only by the guns of the\nConstitution and the United States, but also by the hundreds of\nprivateers and the forty thousand able seamen who were eager to\nsail in them. They found no great place in naval history, but\nEngland knew their prowess and respected it. Every schoolboy is\nfamiliar with the duels of the Wasp and the Frolic, of the\nEnterprise and the Boxer; but how many people know what happened\nwhen the privateer Decatur met and whipped the Dominica of the\nBritish Navy to the southward of Bermuda?",
        "Captain Diron was the man who did it as he was cruising out of\nCharleston, South Carolina, in the summer of 1813. Sighting an\narmed schooner slightly heavier than his own vessel, he made for\nher and was unperturbed when the royal ensign streamed from her\ngaff. Clearing for action, he closed the hatches so that none of\nhis men could hide below. The two schooners fought in the veiling\nsmoke until the American could ram her bowsprit over the other’s\nstern and pour her whole crew aboard. In the confined space of\nthe deck, almost two hundred men and lads were slashing and\nstabbing and shooting amid yells and huzzas. Lieutenant Barrette,\nthe English commander, only twenty-five years old, was mortally\nhurt and every other officer, excepting the surgeon and one\nmidshipman, was killed or wounded. Two-thirds of the crew were\ndown but still they refused to surrender, and Captain Diron had\nto pull down the colors with his own hands. Better discipline and\nmarksmanship had won the day for him and his losses were\ncomparatively small.",
        "Men of his description were apt to think first of glory and let\nthe profits go hang, for there was no cargo to be looted in a\nKing’s ship. Other privateersmen, however, were not so valiant or\nquarrelsome, and there was many a one tied up in London River or\nthe Mersey which had been captured without very savage\nresistance. Yet on the whole it is fair to say that the private\narmed ships outfought and outsailed the enemy as impressively as\ndid the few frigates of the American Navy.",
        "There was a class of them which exemplified the rapid development\nof the merchant marine in a conspicuous manner--large commerce\ndestroyers too swift to be caught, too powerful to fear the\nsmaller cruisers. They were extremely profitable business\nventures, entrusted to the command of the most audacious and\nskillful masters that could be engaged. Of this type was the ship\nAmerica of Salem, owned by the Crowninshields, which made\ntwenty-six prizes and brought safely into port property which\nrealized more than a million dollars. Of this the owners and\nshareholders received six hundred thousand dollars as dividends.\nShe was a stately vessel, built for the East India trade, and was\ngenerally conceded to be the fastest privateer afloat. For this\nservice the upper deck was removed and the sides were filled in\nwith stout oak timber as an armored protection, and longer yards\nand royal masts gave her a huge area of sail. Her crew of one\nhundred and fifty men had the exacting organization of a\nman-of-war, including, it is interesting to note, three\nlieutenants, three mates, a sailingmaster, surgeon, purser,\ncaptain of marines, gunners, seven prize masters, armorer,\ndrummer, and a fifer. Discipline was severe, and flogging was the\npenalty for breaking the regulations.",
        "During her four cruises, the America swooped among the plodding\nmerchantmen like a falcon on a dovecote, the sight of her\nfrightening most of her prey into submission, with a brush now\nand then to exercise the crews of the twenty-two guns, and\nperhaps a man or two hit. Long after the war, Captain James\nChever, again a peaceful merchant mariner, met at Valparaiso, Sir\nJames Thompson, commander of the British frigate Dublin, which\nhad been fitted out in 1813 for the special purpose of chasing\nthe America. In the course of a cordial chat between the two\ncaptains the Briton remarked:",
        "“I was once almost within gun-shot of that infernal Yankee\nskimming-dish, just as night came on. By daylight she had\noutsailed the Dublin so devilish fast that she was no more than a\nspeck on the horizon. By the way, I wonder if you happen to know\nthe name of the beggar that was master of her.”",
        "“I’m the beggar,” chuckled Captain Chever, and they drank each\nother’s health on the strength of it.",
        "Although the Treaty of Ghent omitted mention of the impressment\nof sailors, which had been the burning issue of the war, there\nwere no more offenses of this kind. American seafarers were safe\nagainst kidnapping on their own decks, and they had won this\nsecurity by virtue of their own double-shotted guns. At the same\ntime England lifted the curse of the press-gang from her own\npeople, who refused longer to endure it.",
        "There seemed no reason why the two nations, having finally fought\ntheir differences to a finish, should not share the high seas in\npeaceful rivalry; but the irritating problems of protection and\nreciprocity survived to plague and hamper commerce. It was\ndifficult for England to overcome the habit of guarding her trade\nagainst foreign invasion. Agreeing with the United States to\nwaive all discriminating duties between the ports of the two\ncountries--this was as much as she was at that time willing to\nyield. She still insisted upon regulating the trade of her West\nIndies and Canada. American East Indiamen were to be limited to\ndirect voyages and could not bring cargoes to Europe. Though this\ndiscrimination angered Congress, to which it appeared as lopsided\nreciprocity, the old duties were nevertheless repealed; and then,\npresto! the British colonial policy of exclusion was enforced and\neighty thousand tons of American shipping became idle because the\nWest India market was closed.",
        "There followed several years of unhappy wrangling, a revival of\nthe old smuggling spirit, the risk of seizure and confiscations,\nand shipping merchants with long faces talking ruin. The theory\nof free trade versus protection was as debatable and opinions\nwere as conflicting then as now. Some were for retaliation,\nothers for conciliation; and meanwhile American shipmasters went\nabout their business, with no room for theories in their honest\nheads, and secured more and more of the world’s trade. Curiously\nenough, the cries of calamity in the United States were echoed\nacross the water, where the “London Times” lugubriously\nexclaimed: “The shipping interest, the cradle of our navy, is\nhalf ruined. Our commercial monopoly exists no longer; and\nthousands of our manufacturers are starving or seeking redemption\nin distant lands. We have closed the Western Indies against\nAmerica from feelings of commercial rivalry. Its active seamen\nhave already engrossed an important branch of our carrying trade\nto the Eastern Indies. Her starred flag is now conspicuous on\nevery sea and will soon defy our thunder.”",
        "It was not until 1849 that Great Britain threw overboard her long\ncatalogue of protective navigation laws which had been piling up\nsince the time of Cromwell, and declared for free trade afloat.\nMeanwhile the United States had drifted in the same direction,\nbarring foreign flags from its coastwise shipping but offering\nfull exemption from all discriminating duties and tonnage duties\nto every maritime nation which should respond in like manner.\nThis latter legislation was enacted in 1828 and definitely\nabandoned the doctrine of protection in so far as it applied to\nAmerican ships and sailors. For a generation thereafter, during\nwhich ocean rivalry was a battle royal of industry, enterprise,\nand skill, the United States was paramount and her merchant\nmarine attained its greatest successes.",
        "There is one school of modern economists who hold that the seeds\nof decay and downfall were planted by this adoption of free trade\nin 1828, while another faction of gentlemen quite as estimable\nand authoritative will quote facts and figures by the ream to\nprove that governmental policies had nothing whatever to do with\nthe case. These adversaries have written and are still writing\nmany volumes in which they almost invariably lose their tempers.\nPartisan politics befog the tariff issue afloat as well as\nashore, and one’s course is not easy to chart. It is\nindisputable, however, that so long as Yankee ships were better,\nfaster, and more economically managed, they won a commanding\nshare of the world’s trade. When they ceased to enjoy these\nqualities of superiority, they lost the trade and suffered for\nlack of protection to overcome the handicap.",
        "The War of 1812 was the dividing line between two eras of salt\nwater history. On the farther side lay the turbulent centuries of\nhazard and bloodshed and piracy, of little ships and indomitable\nseamen who pursued their voyages in the reek of gunpowder and of\nlegalized pillage by the stronger, and of merchant adventurers\nwho explored new markets wherever there was water enough to float\ntheir keels. They belonged to the rude and lusty youth of a world\nwhich lived by the sword and which gloried in action. Even into\nthe early years of the nineteenth century these mariners still\nsailed--Elizabethan in deed and spirit.",
        "On the hither side of 1812 were seas unvexed by the privateer and\nthe freebooter. The lateen-rigged corsairs had been banished from\ntheir lairs in the harbors of Algiers, and ships needed to show\nno broadsides of cannon in the Atlantic trade. For a time they\ncarried the old armament among the lawless islands of the Orient\nand off Spanish-American coasts where the vocation of piracy made\nits last stand, but the great trade routes of the globe were\npeaceful highways for the white-winged fleets of all nations. The\nAmerican seamen who had fought for the right to use the open sea\nwere now to display their prowess in another way and in a romance\nof achievement that was no less large and thrilling.",
        "It was on the stormy Atlantic, called by sailormen the Western\nOcean, that the packet ships won the first great contest for\nsupremacy and knew no rivals until the coming of the age of steam\nmade them obsolete. Their era antedated that of the clipper and\nwas wholly distinct. The Atlantic packet was the earliest liner:\nshe made regular sailings and carried freight and passengers\ninstead of trading on her owners’ account as was the ancient\ncustom. Not for her the tranquillity of tropic seas and the\nbreath of the Pacific trades, but an almost incessant battle with\nswinging surges and boisterous winds, for she was driven harder\nin all weathers and seasons than any other ships that sailed. In\nsuch battering service as this the lines of the clipper were too\nextremely fine, her spars too tall and slender. The packet was by\nno means slow and if the list of her record passages was superb,\nit was because they were accomplished by masters who would sooner\nlet a sail blow away than take it in and who raced each other\nevery inch of the way.",
        "They were small ships of three hundred to five hundred tons when\nthe famous Black Ball Line was started in 1816. From the first\nthey were the ablest vessels that could be built, full-bodied and\nstoutly rigged. They were the only regular means of communication\nbetween the United States and Europe and were entrusted with the\nmails, specie, government dispatches, and the lives of eminent\npersonages. Blow high, blow low, one of the Black Ball packets\nsailed from New York for Liverpool on the first and sixteenth of\nevery month. Other lines were soon competing--the Red Star and\nthe Swallow Tail out of New York, and fine ships from Boston and\nPhiladelphia. With the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 the\ncommercial greatness of New York was assured, and her Atlantic\npackets increased in size and numbers, averaging a thousand tons\neach in the zenith of their glory.",
        "England, frankly confessing herself beaten and unable to compete\nwith such ships as these, changed her attitude from hostility to\nopen admiration. She surrendered the Atlantic packet trade to\nAmerican enterprise, and British merchantmen sought their gains\nin other waters. The Navigation Laws still protected their\ncommerce in the Far East and they were content to jog at a more\nsedate gait than these weltering packets whose skippers were\nstriving for passages of a fortnight, with the forecastle doors\nnailed fast and the crew compelled to stay on deck from Sandy\nHook to Fastnet Rock.",
        "No blustering, rum-drinking tarpaulin was the captain who sailed\nthe Independence, the Ocean Queen, or the Dreadnought but a man\nvery careful of his manners and his dress, who had been selected\nfrom the most highly educated merchant service in the world. He\nwas attentive to the comfort of his passengers and was presumed\nto have no other duties on deck than to give the proper orders to\nhis first officer and work out his daily reckoning. It was an\nexacting, nerve-racking ordeal, however, demanding a sleepless\nvigilance, courage, and cool judgment of the first order. The\ncompensations were large. As a rule, he owned a share of the ship\nand received a percentage of the freights and passage money. His\nrank when ashore was more exalted than can be conveyed in mere\nwords. Any normal New York boy would sooner have been captain of\na Black Ball packet than President of the United States, and he\nknew by heart the roaring chantey",
        "    It is of a flash packet,\n      A packet of fame.\n    She is bound to New York\n      And the Dreadnought’s her name.\n    She is bound to the west’ard\n      Where the stormy winds blow.\n    Bound away to the west’ard,\n      Good Lord, let her go.",
        "There were never more than fifty of these ships afloat, a\ntrifling fraction of the American deep-water tonnage of that day,\nbut the laurels they won were immortal. Not only did the English\nmariner doff his hat to them, but a Parliamentary committee\nreported in 1837 that “the American ships frequenting the ports\nof England are stated by several witnesses to be superior to\nthose of a similar class among the ships of Great Britain, the\ncommanders and officers being generally considered to be more\ncompetent as seamen and navigators and more uniformly persons of\neducation than the commanders and officers of British ships of a\nsimilar size and class trading from England to America.”",
        "It was no longer a rivalry with the flags of other nations but an\nunceasing series of contests among the packets of the several\nlines, and their records aroused far more popular excitement than\nwhen the great steamers of this century were chipping off the\nminutes, at an enormous coal consumption, toward a five-day\npassage. Theirs were tests of real seamanship, and there were few\ndisasters. The packet captain scorned a towboat to haul him into\nthe stream if the wind served fair to set all plain sail as his\nship lay at her wharf. Driving her stern foremost, he braced his\nyards and swung her head to sea, clothing the masts with soaring\ncanvas amid the farewell cheers of the crowds which lined the\nwaterfront.",
        "A typical match race was sailed between the Black Ball liner\nColumbus, Captain De Peyster, and the Sheridan, Captain Russell,\nof the splendid Dramatic fleet, in 1837. The stake was $10,000 a\nside, put up by the owners and their friends. The crews were\npicked men who were promised a bonus of fifty dollars each for\nwinning. The ships sailed side by side in February, facing the\nwild winter passage, and the Columbus reached Liverpool in the\nremarkable time of sixteen days, two days ahead of the Sheridan.",
        "The crack packets were never able to reel off more than twelve or\nfourteen knots under the most favorable conditions, but they were\nkept going night and day, and some of them maintained their\nschedules almost with the regularity of the early steamers. The\nMontezuma, the Patrick Henry, and the Southampton crossed from\nNew York to Liverpool in fifteen days, and for years the\nIndependence held the record of fourteen days and six hours. It\nremained for the Dreadnought, Captain Samuel Samuels, in 1859, to\nset the mark for packet ships to Liverpool at thirteen days and\neight hours.",
        "Meanwhile the era of the matchless clipper had arrived and it was\none of these ships which achieved the fastest Atlantic passage\never made by a vessel under sail. The James Baines was built for\nEnglish owners to be used in the Australian trade. She was a full\nclipper of 2515 tons, twice the size of the ablest packets, and\nwas praised as “the most perfect sailing ship that ever entered\nthe river Mersey.” Bound out from Boston to Liverpool, she\nanchored after twelve days and six hours at sea.",
        "There was no lucky chance in this extraordinary voyage, for this\nclipper was the work of the greatest American builder, Donald\nMcKay, who at the same time designed the Lightning for the same\nowners. This clipper, sent across the Atlantic on her maiden\ntrip, left in her foaming wake a twenty-four hour run which no\nsteamer had even approached and which was not equaled by the\nfastest express steamers until twenty-five years later when the\ngreyhound Arizona ran eighteen knots in one hour on her trial\ntrip. This is a rather startling statement when one reflects that\nthe Arizona of the Guion line seems to a generation still living\na modern steamer and record-holder. It is even more impressive\nwhen coupled with the fact that, of the innumerable passenger\nsteamers traversing the seas today, only a few are capable of a\nspeed of more than eighteen knots.",
        "This clipper Lightning did her 436 sea miles in one day, or\neighteen and a half knots, better than twenty land miles an hour,\nand this is how the surpassing feat was entered in her log, or\nofficial journal: “March 1. Wind south. Strong gales; bore away\nfor the North Channel, carrying away the foretopsail and lost\njib; hove the log several times and found the ship going through\nthe water at the rate of 18 to 18 1/2 knots; lee rail under water\nand rigging slack. Distance run in twenty-four hours, 436 miles.\"\nThe passage was remarkably fast, thirteen days and nineteen and a\nhalf hours from Boston Light, but the spectacular feature was\nthis day’s work. It is a fitting memorial of the Yankee clipper,\nand, save only a cathedral, the loveliest, noblest fabric ever\nwrought by man’s handiwork.",
        "The clipper, however, was a stranger in the Atlantic and her\nchosen courses were elsewhere. The records made by the James\nBaines and the Lightning were no discredit to the stanch,\nunconquerable packet ships which, year in and year out, held\ntheir own with the steamer lines until just before the Civil War.\nIt was the boast of Captain Samuels that on her first voyage in\n1853 the Dreadnought reached Sandy Hook as the Cunarder Canada,\nwhich had left Liverpool a day ahead of her, was passing in by\nBoston Light. Twice she carried the latest news to Europe, and\nmany seasoned travelers preferred her to the mail steamers.",
        "The masters and officers who handled these ships with such\nmagnificent success were true-blue American seamen, inspired by\nthe finest traditions, successors of the privateersmen of 1812.\nThe forecastles, however, were filled with English, Irish, and\nScandinavians. American lads shunned these ships and, in fact,\nthe ambitious youngster of the coastwise towns began to cease\nfollowing the sea almost a century ago. It is sometimes forgotten\nthat the period during which the best American manhood sought a\nmaritime career lay between the Revolution and the War of 1812.\nThereafter the story became more and more one of American ships\nand less of American sailors, excepting on the quarter-deck.",
        "In later years the Yankee crews were to be found in the ports\nwhere the old customs survived, the long trading voyage, the\ncommunity of interest in cabin and forecastle, all friends and\nneighbors together, with opportunities for profit and\nadvancement. Such an instance was that of the Salem ship George,\nbuilt at Salem in 1814 and owned by the great merchant, Joseph\nPeabody. For twenty-two years she sailed in the East India trade,\nmaking twenty-one round voyages, with an astonishing regularity\nwhich would be creditable for a modern cargo tramp. Her sailors\nwere native-born, seldom more than twenty-one years old, and most\nof them were studying navigation. Forty-five of them became\nshipmasters, twenty of them chief mates, and six second mates.\nThis reliable George was, in short, a nautical training-school of\nthe best kind and any young seaman with the right stuff in him\nwas sure of advancement.",
        "Seven thousand sailors signed articles in the counting-room of\nJoseph Peabody and went to sea in his eighty ships which flew the\nhouse-flag in Calcutta, Canton, Sumatra, and the ports of Europe\nuntil 1844. These were mostly New England boys who followed in\nthe footsteps of their fathers because deep-water voyages were\nstill “adventures” and a career was possible under a system which\nwas both congenial and paternal. Brutal treatment was the rare\nexception. Flogging still survived in the merchant service and\nwas defended by captains otherwise humane, but a skipper, no\nmatter how short-tempered, would be unlikely to abuse a youth\nwhose parents might live on the same street with him and attend\nthe same church.",
        "The Atlantic packets brought a different order of things, which\nwas to be continued through the clipper era. Yankee sailors\nshowed no love for the cold and storms of the Western Ocean in\nthese foaming packets which were remorselessly driven for speed.\nThe masters therefore took what they could get. All the work of\nrigging, sail-making, scraping, painting, and keeping a ship in\nperfect repair was done in port instead of at sea, as was the\nhabit in the China and California clippers, and the lore and\ntraining of the real deep-water sailor became superfluous. The\ncrew of a packet made sail or took it in with the two-fisted\nmates to show them how.",
        "From these conditions was evolved the “Liverpool packet rat,\"\nhairy and wild and drunken, the prey of crimps and dive-keepers\nashore, brave and toughened to every hardship afloat, climbing\naloft in his red shirt, dungaree breeches, and sea-boots, with a\nsnow-squall whistling, the rigging sheathed with ice, and the old\nship burying her bows in the thundering combers. It was the\ndoctrine of his officers that he could not be ruled by anything\nshort of violence, and the man to tame and hammer him was the\n\"bucko” second mate, the test of whose fitness was that he could\nwhip his weight in wild cats. When he became unable to maintain\ndiscipline with fists and belaying-pins, he was deposed for a\nbetter man.",
        "Your seasoned packet rat sought the ship with a hard name by\nchoice. His chief ambition was to kick in the ribs or pound\nsenseless some invincible bucko mate. There was provocation\nenough on both sides. Officers had to take their ships to sea and\nstrain every nerve to make a safe and rapid passage with crews\nwhich were drunk and useless when herded aboard, half of them\ngreenhorns, perhaps, who could neither reef nor steer. Brutality\nwas the one argument able to enforce instant obedience among men\nwho respected nothing else. As a class the packet sailors became\nmore and more degraded because their life was intolerable to\ndecent men. It followed therefore that the quarterdeck employed\nincreasing severity, and, as the officer’s authority in this\nrespect was unchecked and unlimited, it was easy to mistake the\nharshest tyranny for wholesome discipline.",
        "Reenforcing the bucko mate was the tradition that the sailor was\na dog, a different human species from the landsman, without laws\nand usages to protect him. This was a tradition which, for\ncenturies, had been fostered in the naval service, and it\nsurvived among merchant sailors as an unhappy anachronism even\ninto the twentieth century, when an American Congress was\nreluctant to bestow upon a seaman the decencies of existence\nenjoyed by the poorest laborer ashore.",
        "It is in the nature of a paradox that the brilliant success of\nthe packet ships in dominating the North Atlantic trade should\nhave been a factor in the decline of the nation’s maritime\nprestige and resources. Through a period of forty years the pride\nand confidence in these ships, their builders, and the men who\nsailed them, was intense and universal. They were a superlative\nproduct of the American genius, which still displayed the\nenergies of a maritime race. On other oceans the situation was no\nless gratifying. American ships were the best and cheapest in the\nworld. The business held the confidence of investors and\ncommanded an abundance of capital. It was assumed, as late as\n1840, that the wooden sailing ship would continue to be the\nsupreme type of deep-water vessel because the United States\npossessed the greatest stores of timber, the most skillful\nbuilders and mechanics, and the ablest merchant navigators. No\nindustry was ever more efficiently organized and conducted.\nAmerican ships were most in demand and commanded the highest\nfreights. The tonnage in foreign trade increased to a maximum of\n904,476 in 1845. There was no doubt in the minds of the shrewdest\nmerchants and owners and builders of the time that Great Britain\nwould soon cease to be the mistress of the seas and must content\nherself with second place.",
        "It was not considered ominous when, in 1838, the Admiralty had\nrequested proposals for a steam service to America. This demand\nwas prompted by the voyages of the Sirius and Great Western,\nwooden-hulled sidewheelers which thrashed along at ten knots’\nspeed and crossed the Atlantic in fourteen to seventeen days.\nThis was a much faster rate than the average time of the Yankee\npackets, but America was unperturbed and showed no interest in\nsteam. In 1839 the British Government awarded an Atlantic mail\ncontract, with an annual subsidy of $425,000 to Samuel Cunard and\nhis associates, and thereby created the most famous of the\nAtlantic steamship companies.",
        "Four of these liners began running in 1840--an event which\nforetold the doom of the packet fleets, though the warning was\nalmost unheeded in New York and Boston. Four years later Enoch\nTrain was establishing a new packet line to Liverpool with the\nlargest, finest ships built up to that time, the Washington\nIrving, Anglo-American, Ocean Monarch, Anglo-Saxon, and Daniel\nWebster. Other prominent shipping houses were expanding their\nservice and were launching noble packets until 1853. Meanwhile\nthe Cunard steamers were increasing in size and speed, and the\nservice was no longer an experiment.",
        "American capital now began to awaken from its dreams, and Edward\nK. Collins, managing owner of the Dramatic line of packets,\ndetermined to challenge the Cunarders at their own game. Aided by\nthe Government to the extent of $385,000 a year as subsidy, he\nput afloat the four magnificent steamers, Atlantic, Pacific,\nBaltic, and Arctic, which were a day faster than the Cunarders in\ncrossing, and reduced the voyage to nine and ten days. The\nCollins line, so auspiciously begun in 1850, and promising to\ngive the United States the supremacy in steam which it had won\nunder sail, was singularly unfortunate and short-lived. The\nArctic and the Pacific were lost at sea, and Congress withdrew\nits financial support after five years. Deprived of this aid, Mr.\nCollins was unable to keep the enterprise afloat in competition\nwith the subsidized Cunard fleet. In this manner and with little\nfurther effort by American interests to compete for the prize,\nthe dominion of the Atlantic passed into British hands.",
        "The packet ships had held on too long. It had been a stirring\nepisode for the passengers to cheer in mid-ocean when the lofty\npyramids of canvas swept grandly by some wallowing steamer and\nleft her far astern, but in the fifties this gallant picture\nbecame less frequent, and a sooty banner of smoke on the horizon\nproclaimed the new era and the obliteration of all the rushing\nlife and beauty of the tall ship under sail. Slow to realize and\nacknowledge defeat, persisting after the steamers were capturing\nthe cabin passenger and express freight traffic, the American\nship-owners could not visualize this profound transformation.\nTheir majestic clippers still surpassed all rivals in the East\nIndia and China trade and were racing around the Horn, making new\nrecords for speed and winning fresh nautical triumphs for the\nStars and Stripes.",
        "This reluctance to change the industrial and commercial habits of\ngenerations of American shipowners was one of several causes for\nthe decadence which was hastened by the Civil War. For once the\nastute American was caught napping by his British cousin, who was\nswayed by no sentimental values and showed greater adaptability\nin adopting the iron steamer with the screw propeller as the\ninevitable successor of the wooden ship with arching topsails.",
        "The golden age of the American merchant marine was that of the\nsquare-rigged ship, intricate, capricious, and feminine in her\nbeauty, with forty nimble seamen in the forecastle, not that of\nthe metal trough with an engine in the middle and mechanics\nsweating in her depths. When the Atlantic packet was compelled to\nabdicate, it was the beginning of the end. After all, her master\nwas the fickle wind, for a slashing outward passage might be\nfollowed by weeks of beating home to the westward. Steadily\nforging ahead to the beat of her paddles or the thrash of her\nscrew, the steamer even of that day was far more dependable than\nthe sailing vessel. The Lightning clipper might run a hundred\nmiles farther in twenty-four hours than ever a steamer had done,\nbut she could not maintain this meteoric burst of speed. Upon the\nheaving surface of the Western Ocean there was enacted over again\nthe fable of the hare and the tortoise.",
        "Most of the famous chanteys were born in the packet service and\nshouted as working choruses by the tars of this Western Ocean\nbefore the chanteyman perched upon a capstan and led the refrain\nin the clipper trade. You will find their origin unmistakable in\nsuch lines as these:",
        "    As I was a-walking down Rotherhite Street,\n      ’Way, ho, blow the man down;\n    A pretty young creature I chanced for to meet,\n      Give me some time to blow the man down.\n    Soon we’ll be in London City,\n      Blow, boys, blow,\n    And see the gals all dressed so pretty,\n      Blow, my bully boys, blow.",
        "Haunting melodies, folk-song as truly as that of the plantation\nnegro, they vanished from the sea with a breed of men who, for\nall their faults, possessed the valor of the Viking and the\nfortitude of the Spartan. Outcasts ashore--which meant to them\nonly the dance halls of Cherry Street and the grog-shops of\nRatcliffe Road--they had virtues that were as great as their\nfailings. Across the intervening years, with a pathos\nindefinable, come the lovely strains of",
        "    Shenandoah, I’ll ne’er forget you,\n      Away, ye rolling river,\n      Till the day I die I’ll love you ever,\n    Ah, ha, we’re bound away.",
        "The American clipper ship was the result of an evolution which\ncan be traced back to the swift privateers which were built\nduring the War of 1812. In this type of vessel the shipyards of\nChesapeake Bay excelled and their handiwork was known as the\n\"Baltimore clipper,” the name suggested by the old English verb\nwhich Dryden uses to describe the flight of the falcon that\n\"clips it down the wind.” The essential difference between the\nclipper ship and other kinds of merchant craft was that speed and\nnot capacity became the chief consideration. This was a radical\ndeparture for large vessels, which in all maritime history had\nbeen designed with an eye to the number of tons they were able to\ncarry. More finely molded lines had hitherto been found only in\nthe much smaller French lugger, the Mediterranean galley, the\nAmerican schooner.",
        "To borrow the lines of these fleet and graceful models and apply\nthem to the design of a deepwater ship was a bold conception. It\nwas first attempted by Isaac McKim, a Baltimore merchant, who\nordered his builders in 1832 to reproduce as closely as possible\nthe superior sailing qualities of the renowned clipper brigs and\nschooners of their own port. The result was the Ann McKim, of\nnearly five hundred tons, the first Yankee clipper ship, and\ndistinguished as such by her long, easy water-lines, low\nfree-board, and raking stem. She was built and finished without\nregard to cost, copper-sheathed, the decks gleaming with\nbrasswork and mahogany fittings. But though she was a very fast\nand handsome ship and the pride of her owner, the Ann McKim could\nstow so little cargo that shipping men regarded her as\nunprofitable and swore by their full-bodied vessels a few years\nlonger.",
        "That the Ann McKim, however, influenced the ideas of the most\nprogressive builders is very probable, for she was later owned by\nthe New York firm of Howland and Aspinwall, who placed an order\nfor the first extremely sharp clipper ship of the era. This\nvessel, the Rainbow, was designed by John W. Griffeths, a marine\narchitect, who was a pioneer in that he studied shipbuilding as a\nscience instead of working by rule-of-thumb. The Rainbow, which\ncreated a sensation while on the stocks because of her concave or\nhollowed lines forward, which defied all tradition and practice,\nwas launched in 1845. She was a more radical innovation than the\nAnn McKim but a successful one, for on her second voyage to China\nthe Rainbow went out against the northeast monsoon in ninety-two\ndays and came home in eighty-eight, a record which few ships were\nable to better. Her commander, Captain John Land, declared her to\nbe the fastest ship in the world and there were none to dispute\nhim.",
        "Even the Rainbow however, was eclipsed when not long afterward\nHowland and Aspinwall, now converted to the clipper, ordered the\nSea Witch to be built for Captain Bob Waterman. Among all the\nsplendid skippers of the time he was the most dashing figure.\nAbout his briny memory cluster a hundred yarns, some of them\ntrue, others legendary. It has been argued that the speed of the\nclippers was due more to the men who commanded them than to their\nhulls and rigging, and to support the theory the career of\nCaptain Bob Waterman is quoted. He was first known to fame in the\nold Natchez, which was not a clipper at all and was even rated as\nslow while carrying cotton from New Orleans to New York. But\nCaptain Bob took this full-pooped old packet ship around the Horn\nand employed her in the China tea trade. The voyages which he\nmade in her were all fast, and he crowned them with the amazing\nrun of seventy-eight days from Canton to New York, just one day\nbehind the swiftest clipper passage ever sailed and which he\nhimself performed in the Sea Witch. Incredulous mariners simply\ncould not explain this feat of the Natchez and suggested that Bob\nWaterman must have brought the old hooker home by some new route\nof his own discovery.",
        "Captain Bob had won a reputation for discipline as the mate of a\nBlack Ball liner, a rough school, and he was not a mild man.\nAshore his personality was said to have been a most attractive\none, but there is no doubt that afloat he worked the very souls\nout of his sailors. The rumors that he frightfully abused them\nwere not current, however, until he took the Sea Witch and showed\nthe world the fastest ship under canvas. Low in the water, with\nblack hull and gilded figurehead, she seemed too small to support\nher prodigious cloud of sail. For her there were to be no\nleisurely voyages with Captain Bob Waterman on the quarter-deck.\nHome from Canton she sped in seventy-seven days and then in\nseventy-nine--records which were never surpassed.",
        "With what consummate skill and daring this master mariner drove\nhis ship and how the race of hardy sailors to which he belonged\ncompared with those of other nations may be descried in the log\nof another of them, Captain Philip Dumaresq, homeward bound from\nChina in 1849 in the clipper Great Britain. Three weeks out from\nJava Head she had overtaken and passed seven ships heading the\nsame way, and then she began to rush by them in one gale after\nanother. Her log records her exploits in such entries as these:\n\"Passed a ship under double reefs, we with our royals and\nstuddingsails set . . . . Passed a ship laying-to under a\nclose-reefed maintopsail . . . . Split all three topsails and had\nto heave to . . . . Seven vessels in sight and we outsail all of\nthem . . . . Under double-reefed topsails passed several vessels\nhove-to.” Much the same record might be read in the log of the\nmedium clipper Florence--and it is the same story of carrying\nsail superbly on a ship which had been built to stand up under\nit: “Passed two barks under reefed courses and close-reefed\ntopsails standing the same way, we with royals and topgallant\nstudding-sails,” or “Passed a ship under topsails, we with our\nroyals set.” For eleven weeks “the topsail halliards were started\nonly once, to take in a single reef for a few hours.” It is not\nsurprising, therefore, to learn that, seventeen days out from\nShanghai, the Florence exchanged signals with the English ship\nJohn Hagerman, which had sailed thirteen days before her.",
        "Two notable events in the history of the nineteenth century\noccurred within the same year, 1849, to open new fields of trade\nto the Yankee clipper. One of these was the repeal of the British\nNavigation Laws which had given English ships a monopoly of the\ntrade between London and the British East Indies, and the other\nwas the discovery of gold in California. After centuries of pomp\nand power, the great East India Company had been deprived of its\nlast exclusive rights afloat in 1833. Its ponderous,\nfrigate-built merchantmen ceased to dominate the British commerce\nwith China and India and were sold or broken up. All British\nships were now free to engage in this trade, but the spirit and\ncustoms of the old regime still strongly survived. Flying the\nhouse-flags of private owners, the East Indiamen and China tea\nships were still built and manned like frigates, slow,\ncomfortable, snugging down for the night under reduced sail.\nThere was no competition to arouse them until the last barrier of\nthe Navigation Laws was let down and they had to meet the Yankee\nclipper with the tea trade as the huge stake.",
        "Then at last it was farewell to the gallant old Indianian and her\nornate, dignified prestige. With a sigh the London Times\nconfessed: “We must run a race with our gigantic and unshackled\nrival. We must set our long-practised skill, our steady industry,\nand our dogged determination against his youth, ingenuity, and\nardor. Let our shipbuilders and employers take warning in time.\nThere will always be an abundant supply of vessels good enough\nand fast enough for short voyages. But we want fast vessels for\nthe long voyages which otherwise will fall into American hands.”",
        "Before English merchants could prepare themselves for these new\nconditions, the American clipper Oriental was loading in 1850 at\nHong Kong with tea for the London market. Because of her\nreputation for speed, she received freightage of six pounds\nsterling per ton while British ships rode at anchor with empty\nholds or were glad to sail at three pounds ten per ton. Captain\nTheodore Palmer delivered his sixteen hundred tons of tea in the\nWest India Docks, London, after a crack passage of ninety-one\ndays which had never been equaled. His clipper earned $48,000, or\ntwo-thirds of what it had cost to build her. Her arrival in\nLondon created a profound impression. The port had seen nothing\nlike her for power and speed; her skysail yards soared far above\nthe other shipping; the cut of her snowy canvas was faultless;\nall clumsy, needless tophamper had been done away with; and she\nappeared to be the last word in design and construction, as lean\nand fine and spirited as a race-horse in training.",
        "This new competition dismayed British shipping until it could\nrally and fight with similar weapons The technical journal, Naval\nScience, acknowledged that the tea trade of the London markets\nhad passed almost out of the hands of the English ship-owner, and\nthat British vessels, well-manned and well-found, were known to\nlie for weeks in the harbor of Foo-chow, waiting for a cargo and\nseeing American clippers come in, load, and sail immediately with\nfull cargoes at a higher freight than they could command. Even\nthe Government viewed the loss of trade with concern and sent\nadmiralty draftsmen to copy the lines of the Oriental and\nChallenge while they were in drydock.",
        "British clippers were soon afloat, somewhat different in model\nfrom the Yankee ships, but very fast and able, and racing them in\nthe tea trade until the Civil War. With them it was often nip and\ntuck, as in the contest between the English Lord of the Isles and\nthe American clipper bark Maury in 1856. The prize was a premium\nof one pound per ton for the first ship to reach London with tea\nof the new crop. The Lord of the Isles finished loading and\nsailed four days ahead of the Maury, and after thirteen thousand\nmiles of ocean they passed Gravesend within ten minutes of each\nother. The British skipper, having the smartest tug and getting\nhis ship first into dock, won the honors. In a similar race\nbetween the American Sea Serpent and the English Crest of the\nWave, both ships arrived off the Isle of Wight on the same day.\nIt was a notable fact that the Lord of the Isles was the first\ntea clipper built of iron at a date when the use of this stubborn\nmaterial was not yet thought of by the men who constructed the\nsplendid wooden ships of America.",
        "For the peculiar requirements of the tea trade, English maritime\ntalent was quick to perfect a clipper type which, smaller than\nthe great Yankee skysail-yarder, was nevertheless most admirable\nfor its beauty and performance. On both sides of the Atlantic\npartizans hotly championed their respective fleets. In 1852 the\nAmerican Navigation Club, organized by Boston merchants and\nowners, challenged the shipbuilders of Great Britain to race from\na port in England to a port in China and return, for a stake of\n$50,000 a side, ships to be not under eight hundred nor over\ntwelve hundred tons American register. The challenge was aimed at\nthe Stornaway and the Chrysolite, the two clippers that were\nknown to be the fastest ships under the British flag. Though this\nsporting defiance caused lively discussion, nothing came of it,\nand it was with a spirit even keener that Sampson and Tappan of\nBoston offered to match their Nightingale for the same amount\nagainst any clipper afloat, British or American.",
        "In spite of the fact that Yankee enterprise had set the pace in\nthe tea trade, within a few years after 1850 England had so\nsuccessfully mastered the art of building these smaller clippers\nthat the honors were fairly divided. The American owners were\ndiverting their energies to the more lucrative trade in larger\nships sailing around the Horn to San Francisco, a long road\nwhich, as a coastwise voyage, was forbidden to foreign vessels\nunder the navigation laws. After the Civil War the fastest tea\nclippers flew the British flag and into the seventies they\nsurvived the competition of steam, racing among themselves for\nthe premiums awarded to the quickest dispatch. No more of these\nbeautiful vessels were launched after 1869, and one by one they\nvanished into other trades, overtaken by the same fate which had\nbefallen the Atlantic packet and conquered by the cargo steamers\nwhich filed through the Suez Canal.",
        "Until 1848 San Francisco had been a drowsy little Mexican\ntrading-post, a huddle of adobe huts and sheds where American\nships collected hides--vividly described in Two Years Before the\nMast--or a whaler called for wood and water. During the year\npreceding the frenzied migration of the modern Argonauts, only\ntwo merchant ships, one bark and one brig, sailed in through the\nGolden Gate. In the twelve months following, 775 vessels cleared\nfrom Atlantic ports for San Francisco, besides the rush from\nother countries, and nearly fifty thousand passengers scrambled\nashore to dig for gold. Crews deserted their ships, leaving them\nunable to go to sea again for lack of men, and in consequence a\nhundred of them were used as storehouses, hotels, and hospitals,\nor else rotted at their moorings. Sailors by hundreds jumped from\nthe forecastle without waiting to stow the sails or receive their\nwages. Though offered as much as two hundred dollars a month to\nsign again, they jeered at the notion. Of this great fleet at San\nFrancisco in 1849, it was a lucky ship that ever left the harbor\nagain.",
        "It seemed as if the whole world were bound to California and\nalmost overnight there was created the wildest, most extravagant\ndemand for transportation known to history. A clipper costing\n$70,000 could pay for herself in one voyage, with freights at\nsixty dollars a ton. This gold stampede might last but a little\nwhile. To take instant advantage of it was the thing. The fastest\nships, and as many of them as could be built, would skim the\ncream of it. This explains the brief and illustrious era of the\nCalifornia clipper, one hundred and sixty of which were launched\nfrom 1850 to 1854. The shipyards of New York and Boston were\ncrowded with them, and they graced the keel blocks of the\nhistoric old ports of New England--Medford, Mystic, Newburyport,\nPortsmouth, Portland, Rockland, and Bath--wherever the timber and\nthe shipwrights could be assembled.",
        "Until that time there had been few ships afloat as large as a\nthousand tons. These were of a new type, rapidly increased to\nfifteen hundred, two thousand tons, and over. They presented new\nand difficult problems in spars and rigging able to withstand the\nstrain of immense areas of canvas which climbed two hundred feet\nto the skysail pole and which, with lower studdingsails set,\nspread one hundred and sixty feet from boom-end to boom-end.\nThere had to be the strength to battle with the furious tempests\nof Cape Horn and at the same time the driving power to sweep\nbefore the sweet and steadfast tradewinds. Such a queenly clipper\nwas the Flying Cloud, the achievement of that master builder,\nDonald McKay, which sailed from New York to San Francisco in\neighty-nine days, with Captain Josiah Creesy in command. This\nrecord was never lowered and was equaled only twice--by the\nFlying Cloud herself and by the Andrew Jackson nine years later.\nIt was during this memorable voyage that the Flying Cloud sailed\n1256 miles in four days while steering to the northward under\ntopgallantsails after rounding Cape Horn. This was a rate of\nspeed which, if sustained, would have carried her from New York\nto Queenstown in eight days and seventeen hours. This speedy\npassage was made in 1851, and only two years earlier the record\nfor the same voyage of fifteen thousand miles had been one\nhundred and twenty days, by the clipper Memnon.",
        "Donald McKay now resolved to build a ship larger and faster than\nthe Flying Cloud, and his genius neared perfection in the\nSovereign of the Seas, of 2421 tons register, which exceeded in\nsize all merchant vessels afloat. This Titan of the clipper fleet\nwas commanded by Donald’s brother, Captain Lauchlan McKay, with a\ncrew of one hundred and five men and boys. During her only voyage\nto San Francisco she was partly dismasted, but Lauchlan McKay\nrigged her anew at sea in fourteen days and still made port in\none hundred and three days, a record for the season of the year.",
        "It was while running home from Honolulu in 1853 that the\nSovereign of the Seas realized the hopes of her builder. In\neleven days she sailed 3562 miles, with four days logged for a\ntotal of 1478 knots. Making allowance for the longitudes and\ndifference in time, this was an average daily run of 378 sea\nmiles or 435 land miles. Using the same comparison, the distance\nfrom Sandy Hook to Queenstown would have been covered in seven\ndays and nine hours. Figures are arid reading, perhaps, but these\nare wet by the spray and swept by the salt winds of romance.\nDuring one of these four days the Sovereign of the Seas reeled\noff 424 nautical miles, during which her average speed was\nseventeen and two-thirds knots and at times reached nineteen and\ntwenty. The only sailing ship which ever exceeded this day’s work\nwas the Lightning, built later by the same Donald McKay, which\nran 436 knots in the Atlantic passage already referred to. The\nSovereign of the Seas could also boast of a sensational feat upon\nthe Western Ocean, for between New York and Liverpool she\noutsailed the Cunard liner Canada by 325 miles in five days.",
        "It is curiously interesting to notice that the California clipper\nera is almost generally ignored by the foremost English writers\nof maritime history. For one thing, it was a trade in which their\nown ships were not directly concerned, and partizan bias is apt\nto color the views of the best of us when national prestige is\ninvolved. American historians themselves have dispensed with many\nunpleasant facts when engaged with the War of 1812. With regard\nto the speed of clipper ships, however, involving a rivalry far\nmore thrilling and important than all the races ever sailed for\nthe America’s cup, the evidence is available in concrete form.",
        "Lindsay’s “History of Merchant Shipping” is the most elaborate\nEnglish work of the kind. Heavily ballasted with facts and rather\ndull reading for the most part, it kindles with enthusiasm when\neulogizing the Thermopylae and the Sir Launcelot, composite\nclippers of wood and iron, afloat in 1870, which it declares to\nbe “the fastest sailing ships that ever traversed the ocean.\"\nThis fairly presents the issue which a true-blooded Yankee has no\nright to evade. The greatest distance sailed by the Sir Launcelot\nin twenty-four hours between China and London was 354 knots,\ncompared with the 424 miles of the Sovereign of the Seas and the\n436 miles of the Lightning. Her best sustained run was one of\nseven days for an average of a trifle more than 300 miles a day.\nAgainst this is to be recorded the performance of the Sovereign\nof the Seas, 3562 miles in eleven days, at the rate of 324 miles\nevery twenty-four hours, and her wonderful four-day run of 1478\nmiles, an average of 378 miles.",
        "The Thermopylae achieved her reputation in a passage of\nsixty-three days from London to Melbourne--a record which was\nnever beaten. Her fastest day’s sailing was 330 miles, or not\nquite sixteen knots an hour. In six days she traversed 1748\nmiles, an average of 291 miles a day. In this Australian trade\nthe American clippers made little effort to compete. Those\nengaged in it were mostly built for English owners and sailed by\nBritish skippers, who could not reasonably be expected to get the\nmost out of these loftily sparred Yankee ships, which were much\nlarger than their own vessels of the same type. The Lightning\nshowed what she could do from Melbourne to Liverpool by making\nthe passage in sixty-three’ days, with 3722 miles in ten\nconsecutive days and one day’s sprint of 412 miles.",
        "In the China tea trade the Thermopylae drove home from Foo-chow\nin ninety-one days, which was equaled by the Sir Launcelot. The\nAmerican Witch of the Wave had a ninety-day voyage to her credit,\nand the Comet ran from Liverpool to Shanghai in eighty-four days.\nLuck was a larger factor on this route than in the California or\nAustralian trade because of the fitful uncertainty of the\nmonsoons, and as a test of speed it was rather unsatisfactory. In\na very fair-minded and expert summary, Captain Arthur H. Clark,*\nin his youth an officer on Yankee clippers, has discussed this\nquestion of rival speed and power under sail--a question which\nstill absorbs those who love the sea. His conclusion is that in\nordinary weather at sea, when great power to carry sail was not\nrequired, the British tea clippers were extremely fast vessels,\nchiefly on account of their narrow beam. Under these conditions\nthey were perhaps as fast as the American clippers of the same\nclass, such as the Sea Witch, White Squall, Northern Light, and\nSword-Fish. But if speed is to be reckoned by the maximum\nperformance of a ship under the most favorable conditions, then\nthe British tea clippers were certainly no match for the larger\nAmerican ships such as the Flying Cloud, Sovereign of the Seas,\nHurricane, Trade Wind, Typhoon, Flying Fish, Challenge, and Red\nJacket. The greater breadth of the American ships in proportion\nto their length meant power to carry canvas and increased\nbuoyancy which enabled them, with their sharper ends, to be\ndriven in strong gales and heavy seas at much greater speed than\nthe British clippers. The latter were seldom of more than one\nthousand tons’ register and combined in a superlative degree the\ngood qualities of merchant ships.",
        "* “The Clipper Ship Era.” N.Y., 1910.",
        "It was the California trade, brief and crowded and fevered, which\nsaw the roaring days of the Yankee clipper and which was familiar\nwith racing surpassing in thrill and intensity that of the packet\nships of the Western Ocean. In 1851, for instance, the Raven, Sea\nWitch, and Typhoon sailed for San Francisco within the same week.\nThey crossed the Equator a day apart and stood away to the\nsouthward for three thousand miles of the southeast trades and\nthe piping westerly winds which prevailed farther south. At fifty\ndegrees south latitude the Raven and the Sea Witch were abeam of\neach other with the Typhoon only two days astern.",
        "Now they stripped for the tussle to windward around Cape Horn,\nsending down studdingsail booms and skysail yards, making all\nsecure with extra lashings, plunging into the incessant head seas\nof the desolate ocean, fighting it out tack for tack, reefing\ntopsails and shaking them out again, the vigilant commanders\ngoing below only to change their clothes, the exhausted seamen\nstubbornly, heroically handling with frozen, bleeding fingers the\nicy sheets and canvas. A fortnight of this inferno and the Sea\nWitch and the Raven gained the Pacific, still within sight of\neach other, and the Typhoon only one day behind. Then they swept\nnorthward, blown by the booming tradewinds, spreading\nstuddingsails, skysails, and above them, like mere handkerchiefs,\nthe water-sails and ring-tails. Again the three clippers crossed\nthe Equator. Close-hauled on the starboard tack, their bowsprits\nwere pointed for the last stage of the journey to the Golden\nGate. The Typhoon now overhauled her rivals and was the first to\nsignal her arrival, but the victory was earned by the Raven,\nwhich had set her departure from Boston Light while the others\nhad sailed from New York. The Typhoon and the Raven were only a\nday apart, with the Sea Witch five days behind the leader.",
        "Clipper ship crews included men of many nations. In the average\nforecastle there would be two or three Americans, a majority of\nEnglish and Norwegians, and perhaps a few Portuguese and\nItalians. The hardiest seamen, and the most unmanageable, were\nthe Liverpool packet rats who were lured from their accustomed\nhaunts to join the clippers by the magical call of the\ngold-diggings. There were not enough deep-water sailors to man\nhalf the ships that were built in these few years, and the crimps\nand boarding-house runners decoyed or flung aboard on sailing day\nas many men as were demanded, and any drunken, broken landlubber\nwas good enough to be shipped as an able seaman. They were things\nof rags and tatters--their only luggage a bottle of whiskey.",
        "The mates were thankful if they could muster enough real sailors\nto work the ship to sea and then began the stern process of\nwhipping the wastrels and incompetents into shape for the perils\nand emergencies of the long voyage. That these great clippers\nwere brought safely to port is a shining tribute to the masterful\nskill of their officers. While many of them were humane and just,\nwith all their severity, the stories of savage abuse which are\ntold of some are shocking in the extreme. The defense was that it\nwas either mutiny or club the men under. Better treatment might\nhave persuaded better men to sail. Certain it is that life in the\nforecastle of a clipper was even more intolerable to the\nself-respecting American youth than it had previously been aboard\nthe Atlantic packet.",
        "When Captain Bob Waterman arrived at San Francisco in the\nChallenge clipper in 1851, a mob tried very earnestly to find and\nhang him and his officers because of the harrowing stories told\nby his sailors. That he had shot several of them from the yards\nwith his pistol to make the others move faster was one count in\nthe indictment. For his part, Captain Waterman asserted that a\nmore desperate crew of ruffians had never sailed out of New York\nand that only two of them were Americans. They were mutinous from\nthe start, half of them blacklegs of the vilest type who swore to\nget the upper hand of him. His mates, boatswain, and carpenter\nhad broken open their chests and boxes and had removed a\ncollection of slung-shots, knuckle-dusters, bowie-knives, and\npistols. Off Rio Janeiro they had tried to kill the chief mate,\nand Captain Waterman had been compelled to jump in and stretch\ntwo of them dead with an iron belaying-pin. Off Cape Horn three\nsailors fell from aloft and were lost. This accounted for the\ncasualties.",
        "The truth of such episodes as these was difficult to fathom.\nCaptain Waterman demanded a legal investigation, but nothing came\nof his request and he was commended by his owners for his skill\nand courage in bringing the ship to port without losing a spar or\na sail. It was a skipper of this old school who blandly\nmaintained the doctrine that if you wanted the men to love you,\nyou must starve them and knock them down. The fact is proven by\nscores of cases that the discipline of the American clipper was\nboth famously efficient and notoriously cruel. It was not until\nlong after American sailors had ceased to exist that adequate\nlegislation was enacted to provide that they should be treated as\nhuman beings afloat and ashore. Other days and other customs! It\nis perhaps unkind to judge these vanished master-mariners too\nharshly, for we cannot comprehend the crises which continually\nbeset them in their command.",
        "No more extreme clipper ships were built after 1854. The\nCalifornia frenzy had subsided and speed in carrying merchandise\nwas no longer so essential; besides, the passenger traffic was\nseeking the Isthmian route. What were called medium clippers\nenjoyed a profitable trade for many years later, and one of them,\nthe Andrew Jackson, was never outsailed for the record from New\nYork to San Francisco. This splendid type of ship was to be found\non every sea, for the United States was still a commanding factor\nin the maritime activities of South America, India, China,\nEurope, and Australia. In 1851 its merchant tonnage rivaled that\nof England and was everywhere competing with it.",
        "The effects of the financial panic of 1857 and the aftermath of\nbusiness depression were particularly disastrous to American\nships. Freights were so low as to yield no profit, and the finest\nclippers went begging for charters. The yards ceased to launch\nnew tonnage. British builders had made such rapid progress in\ndesign and construction that the days of Yankee preference in the\nChina trade had passed. The Stars and Stripes floated over ships\nwaiting idle in Manila Bay, at Shanghai, Hong-Kong, and Calcutta.\nThe tide of commerce had slackened abroad as well as at home and\nthe surplus of deep-water tonnage was world-wide.",
        "In earlier generations afloat, the American spirit had displayed\namazing recuperative powers. The havoc of the Revolution had been\nunable to check it, and its vigor and aggressive enterprise had\nnever been more notable than after the blows dealt by the\nEmbargo, the French Spoliations, and the War of 1812. The\nconditions of trade and the temper of the people were now so\nchanged that this mighty industry, aforetime so robust and\nresilient, was unable to recover from such shocks as the panic of\n1857 and the Civil War. Yet it had previously survived and\ntriumphed over calamities far more severe. The destruction\nwrought by Confederate cruisers was trifling compared with the\nwork of the British and French privateers when the nation was\nvery small and weak.",
        "The American spirit had ceased to concern itself with the sea as\nthe vital and dominant element. The footsteps of the young men no\nlonger turned toward the wharf and the waterside and the tiers of\ntall ships outward bound. They were aspiring to conquer an inland\nempire of prairie and mountain and desert, impelled by the same\npioneering and adventurous ardor which had burned in their\nseafaring sires. Steam had vanquished sail--an epochal event in a\nthousand years of maritime history--but the nation did not care\nenough to accept this situation as a new challenge or to continue\nthe ancient struggle for supremacy upon the sea. England did\ncare, because it was life or death to the little, sea-girt\nisland, but as soon as the United States ceased to be a strip of\nAtlantic seaboard and the panorama, of a continent was unrolled\nto settlement, it was foreordained that the maritime habit of\nthought and action should lose its virility in America. All great\nseafaring races, English, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Dutch, have\ntaken to salt water because there was lack of space, food, or\nwork ashore, and their strong young men craved opportunities.\nLike the Pilgrim Fathers and their fishing shallops they had\nnowhere else to go.",
        "When the Flying Cloud and the clippers of her kind--taut, serene,\nimmaculate--were sailing through the lonely spaces of the South\nAtlantic and the Pacific, they sighted now and then the stumpy,\nslatternly rig and greasy hull of a New Bedford whaler, perhaps\nrolling to the weight of a huge carcass alongside. With a poor\nopinion of the seamanship of these wandering barks, the clipper\ncrews rolled out, among their favorite chanteys:",
        "    Oh, poor Reuben Ranzo,\n    Ranzo, boys, O Ranzo,\n    Oh, Ranzo was no sailor,\n    So they shipped him aboard a whaler,\n    Ranzo, boys, O Ranzo.",
        "This was crass, intolerant prejudice. The whaling ship was\ncareless of appearances, it is true, and had the air of an ocean\nvagabond; but there were other duties more important than\nholystoning decks, scraping spars, and trimming the yards to a\nhair. On a voyage of two or three years, moreover, there was\nalways plenty of time tomorrow. Brave and resourceful seamen were\nthese New England adventurers and deep-sea hunters who made\nnautical history after their own fashion. They flourished coeval\nwith the merchant marine in its prime, and they passed from the\nsea at about the same time and for similar reasons. Modernity\ndispensed with their services, and young men found elsewhere more\nprofitable and easier employment.",
        "The great days of Nantucket as a whaling port were passed before\nthe Revolution wiped out her ships and killed or scattered her\nsailors. It was later discovered that larger ships were more\neconomical, and Nantucket harbor bar was too shoal to admit their\npassage. For this reason New Bedford became the scene of the\nforemost activity, and Nantucket thereafter played a minor part,\nalthough her barks went cruising on to the end of the chapter and\nher old whaling families were true to strain. As explorers the\nwhalemen rambled into every nook and corner of the Pacific before\nmerchant vessels had found their way thither. They discovered\nuncharted islands and cheerfully fought savages or suffered\ndireful shipwreck. The chase led them into Arctic regions where\ntheir stout barks were nipped like eggshells among the grinding\nfloes, or else far to the southward where they broiled in tropic\ncalms. The New Bedford lad was as keen to go a-whaling as was his\ncounterpart in Boston or New York to be the dandy mate of a\nCalifornia clipper, and true was the song:",

        "Yankee whaling reached its high tide in 1857 when the New Bedford\nfleet alone numbered 329 sail and those owned in other ports of\nBuzzard’s Bay swelled the total to 426 vessels, besides thirty\nmore hailing from New London and Sag Harbor. In this year the\nvalue of the catch was more than ten million dollars. The old\ncustom of sailing on shares or “lays” instead of wages was never\nchanged. It was win or lose for all hands--now a handsome fortune\nor again an empty hold and pockets likewise. There was Captain\nW.T. Walker of New Bedford who, in 1847, bought for a song a ship\nso old that she was about to be broken up for junk and no\ninsurance broker would look at her. In this rotten relic he\nshipped a crew and went sailing in the Pacific. Miraculously\nkeeping afloat, this Envoy of his was filled to the hatches with\noil and bones, twice running, before she returned to her home\nport; and she earned $138,450 on a total investment of eight\nthousand dollars.",
        "The ship Sarah of Nantucket, after a three years’ cruise, brought\nback 3497 barrels of sperm oil which sold for $89,000, and the\nWilliam Hamilton of New Bedford set another high mark by stowing\n4181 barrels of a value of $109,269. The Pioneer of New London,\nCaptain Ebenezer Morgan, was away only a year and stocked a cargo\nof oil and whalebone which sold for $150,060. Most of the profits\nof prosperous voyages were taken as the owners’ share, and the\nincomes of the captain and crew were so niggardly as to make one\nwonder why they persisted in a calling so perilous, arduous, and\npoorly paid. During the best years of whaling, when the ships\nwere averaging $16,000 for a voyage, the master received an\neighteenth, or about nine hundred dollars a year. The highly\nskilled hands, such as the boat-steerers and harpooners, had a\nlay of only one seventy-fifth, or perhaps a little more than two\nhundred dollars cash as the reward of a voyage which netted the\nowner at least fifty per cent on his investment. Occasionally\nthey fared better than this and sometimes worse. The answer to\nthe riddle is that they liked the life and had always the\ngambling spirit which hopes for a lucky turn of the cards.",
        "The countless episodes of fragile boats smashed to kindling by\nfighting whales, of the attack renewed with harpoon and lance, of\nships actually rammed and sunk, would fill a volume by themselves\nand have been stirringly narrated in many a one.

The curious fact\nis that his products commanded higher prices in 1907 than fifty\nyears before, but the number of his ships rapidly decreased.\nWhales were becoming scarce, and New England capital preferred\nother forms of investment.

The souls of their sailors have fled to Fiddler’s\nGreen, where all dead mariners go.

        "One thinks of the old merchant marine in terms of the clipper\nship and distant ports. The coasting trade has been overlooked in\nsong and story; yet, since the year 1859, its fleets have always\nbeen larger and more important than the American deep-water\ncommerce nor have decay and misfortune overtaken them. It is a\ntraffic which flourished from the beginning, ingeniously adapting\nitself to new conditions, unchecked by war, and surviving with\nsplendid vigor, under steam and sail, in this modern era.",

In no Hall of Fame will you find the name of\nCaptain Andrew Robinson of Gloucester, but he was nevertheless an\nillustrious benefactor and deserves a place among the most useful\nAmericans. His invention was the Yankee schooner of fore-and-aft\nrig, and he gave to this type of vessel its name.* Seaworthy,\nfast, and easily handled, adapted for use in the early eighteenth\ncentury when inland transportation was almost impossible, the\nschooner carried on trade between the colonies and was an\nimportant factor in the growth of the fisheries.",
        "* It is said that as the odd two-master slid gracefully into the\nwater, a spectator exclaimed: “See how she scoons!” “Aye,\"\nanswered Captain Robinson, “a SCHOONER let her be!” This\nlaunching took place in 1718 or 1714.",
        "Before the Revolution the first New England schooners were\nbeating up to the Grand Bank of Newfoundland after cod and\nhalibut. They were of no more than fifty tons’ burden, too small\nfor their task but manned by fishermen of surpassing hardihood.\nMarblehead was then the foremost fishing port with two hundred\nbrigs and schooners on the offshore banks. But to Gloucester\nbelongs the glory of sending the first schooner to the Grand\nBank.* From these two rock-bound harbors went thousands of\ntrained seamen to man the privateers and the ships of the\nContinental navy, slinging their hammocks on the gun-decks beside\nthe whalemen of Nantucket. These fishermen and coastwise sailors\nfought on the land as well and followed the drums of Washington’s\narmies until the final scene at Yorktown. Gloucester and\nMarblehead were filled with widows and orphans, and half their\nmen-folk were dead or missing.",
        "* Marvin’s “American Merchant Marine,” p. 287.",
        "The fishing-trade soon prospered again, and the men of the old\nports tenaciously clung to the sea even when the great migration\nflowed westward to people the wilderness and found a new American\nempire. They were fishermen from father to son, bound together in\nan intimate community of interests, a race of pure native or\nEnglish stock, deserving this tribute which was paid to them in\nCongress: “Every person on board our fishing vessels has an\ninterest in common with his associates; their reward depends upon\ntheir industry and enterprise. Much caution is observed in the\nselection of the crews of our fishing vessels; it often happens\nthat every individual is connected by blood and the strongest\nties of friendship; our fishermen are remarkable for their\nsobriety and good conduct, and they rank with the most skillful\nnavigators.”",
        "Fishing and the coastwise merchant trade were closely linked.\nSchooners loaded dried cod as well as lumber for southern ports\nand carried back naval stores and other southern products.\nWell-to-do fishermen owned trading vessels and sent out\ntheir ventures, the sailors shifting from one forecastle to the\nother. With a taste for an easier life than the stormy, freezing\nBanks, the young Gloucesterman would sign on for a voyage to\nPernambuco or Havana and so be fired with ambition to become a\nmate or master and take to deep water after a while. In this way\nwas maintained a school of seamanship which furnished the most\nintelligent and efficient officers of the merchant marine. For\ngenerations they were mostly recruited from the old fishing and\nshipping ports of New England until the term “Yankee shipmaster\"\nhad a meaning peculiarly its own.",
        "Seafaring has undergone so many revolutionary changes and old\ndays and ways are so nearly obliterated that it is singular to\nfind the sailing vessel still employed in great numbers, even\nthough the gasolene motor is being installed to kick her along in\nspells of calm weather. The Gloucester fishing schooner, perfect\nof her type, stanch, fleet, and powerful, still drives homeward\nfrom the Banks under a tall press of canvas, and her crew still\ndivide the earnings, share and share, as did their forefathers a\nhundred and fifty years ago. But the old New England strain of\nblood no longer predominates, and Portuguese, Scandinavians, and\nNova Scotia “Bluenoses” bunk with the lads of Gloucester stock.\nYet they are alike for courage, hardihood, and mastery of the\nsea, and the traditions of the calling are undimmed.",
        "There was a time before the Civil War when Congress jealously\nprotected the fisheries by means of a bounty system and\nlegislation aimed against our Canadian neighbors. The fishing\nfleets were regarded as a source of national wealth and the\nnursery of prime seamen for the navy and merchant marine. In 1858\nthe bounty system was abandoned, however, and the fishermen were\nleft to shift for themselves, earning small profits at peril of\ntheir lives and preferring to follow the sea because they knew no\nother profession. In spite of this loss of assistance from the\nGovernment, the tonnage engaged in deep-sea fisheries was never\nso great as in the second year of the Civil War. Four years later\nthe industry had shrunk one-half; and it has never recovered its\nearly importance*",
        "* In 1882, the tonnage amounted to 193,459; in 1866, to 89,336.",
        "The coastwise merchant trade, on the other hand, has been\njealously guarded against competition and otherwise fostered ever\nsince 1789, when the first discriminatory tonnage tax was\nenforced. The Embargo Act of 1808 prohibited domestic commerce to\nforeign flags, and this edict was renewed in the American\nNavigation Act of 1817. It remained a firmly established doctrine\nof maritime policy until the Great War compelled its suspension\nas an emergency measure. The theories of protection and free\ntrade have been bitterly debated for generations, but in this\ninstance the practice was eminently successful and the results\nwere vastly impressive. Deepwater shipping dwindled and died, but\nthe increase in coastwise sailing was consistent. It rose to five\nmillion tons early in this century and makes the United States\nstill one of the foremost maritime powers in respect to saltwater\nactivity.",
        "To speak of this deep-water shipping as trade coastwise is\nmisleading, in a way. The words convey an impression of dodging\nfrom port to port for short distances, whereas many of the\nvoyages are longer than those of the foreign routes in European\nwaters. It is farther by sea from Boston to Philadelphia than\nfrom Plymouth, England, to Bordeaux. A schooner making the run\nfrom Portland to Savannah lays more knots over her stern than a\ntramp bound out from England to Lisbon. It is a shorter voyage\nfrom Cardiff to Algiers than an American skipper pricks off on\nhis chart when he takes his steamer from New York to New Orleans\nor Galveston. This coastwise trade may lack the romance of the\nold school of the square-rigged ship in the Roaring Forties, but\nit has always been the more perilous and exacting. Its seamen\nsuffer hardships unknown elsewhere, for they have to endure\nwinters of intense cold and heavy gales and they are always in\nrisk of stranding or being driven ashore.",
        "The story of these hardy men is interwoven, for the most part,\nwith the development of the schooner in size and power. This\ngraceful craft, so peculiar to its own coast and people, was\nbuilt for utility and possessed a simple beauty of its own when\nunder full sail. The schooners were at first very small because\nit was believed that large fore-and-aft sails could not be\nhandled with safety. They were difficult to reef or lower in a\nblow until it was discovered that three masts instead of two made\nthe task much easier. For many years the three-masted schooner\nwas the most popular kind of American merchant vessel. They\nclustered in every Atlantic port and were built in the yards of\nNew England, New York, New Jersey, and Virginia,--built by the\nmile, as the saying was, and sawed off in lengths to suit the\nowners’ pleasure. They carried the coal, ice, lumber of the whole\nseaboard and were so economical of man-power that they earned\ndividends where steamers or square-rigged ships would not have\npaid for themselves.",
        "As soon as a small steam-engine was employed to hoist the sails,\nit became possible to launch much larger schooners and to operate\nthem at a marvelously low cost. Rapidly the four-master gained\nfavor, and then came the five- and six-masted vessels, gigantic\nships of their kind. Instead of the hundred-ton schooner of a\ncentury ago, Hampton Roads and Boston Harbor saw these great\ncargo carriers which could stow under hatches four and five\nthousand tons of coal, and whose masts soared a hundred and fifty\nfeet above the deck. Square-rigged ships of the same capacity\nwould have required crews of a hundred men, but these schooners\nwere comfortably handled by a company of fifteen all told, only\nten of whom were in the forecastle. There was no need of sweating\nand hauling at braces and halliards. The steam-winch undertook all\nthis toil. The tremendous sails, stretching a hundred feet from\nboom to gaff could not have been managed otherwise. Even for\ntrimming sheets or setting topsails, it was necessary merely to\ntake a turn or two around the drum of the winch engine and turn\nthe steam valve. The big schooner was the last word in cheap,\nefficient transportation by water. In her own sphere of activity\nshe was as notable an achievement as the Western Ocean packet or\nthe Cape Horn clipper.",
        "The masters who sailed these extraordinary vessels also changed\nand had to learn a new kind of seamanship. They must be very\ncompetent men, for the tests of their skill and readiness were\nreally greater than those demanded of the deepwater skipper. They\ndrove these great schooners alongshore winter and summer; across\nNantucket Shoals and around Cape Cod, and their salvation\ndepended on shortening sail ahead of the gale. Let the wind once\nblow and the sea get up, and it was almost impossible to strip\nthe canvas off an unwieldy six-master. The captain’s chief fear\nwas of being blown offshore, of having his vessel run away with\nhim! Unlike the deep-water man, he preferred running in toward\nthe beach and letting go his anchors. There he would ride out the\nstorm and hoist sail when the weather moderated.",
        "These were American shipmasters of the old breed, raised in\nschooners as a rule, and adapting themselves to modern\nconditions. They sailed for nominal wages and primage, or five\nper cent of the gross freight paid the vessel. Before the Great\nWar in Europe, freights were low and the schooner skippers earned\nscanty incomes. Then came a world shortage of tonnage and\nimmediately coastwise freights soared skyward. The big schooners\nof the Palmer fleet began to reap fabulous dividends and their\nmasters shared in the unexpected opulence. Besides their primage\nthey owned shares in their vessels, a thirty-second or so, and\npresently their settlement at the end of a voyage coastwise\namounted to an income of a thousand dollars a month. They earned\nthis money, and the managing owners cheerfully paid them, for\nthere had been lean years and uncomplaining service and the\nsailor had proved himself worthy of his hire. So tempting was the\nforeign war trade, that a fleet of them was sent across the\nAtlantic until the American Government barred them from the war\nzone as too easy a prey for submarine attack. They therefore\nreturned to the old coastwise route or loaded for South American\nports--singularly interesting ships because they were the last\nbold venture of the old American maritime spirit, a challenge to\nthe Age of Steam.",
        "No more of these huge, towering schooners have been built in the\nlast dozen years. Steam colliers and barges have won the fight\nbecause time is now more valuable than cheapness of\ntransportation. The schooner might bowl down to Norfolk from\nBoston or Portland in four days and be threshing about for two\nweeks in head winds on the return voyage.",
        "The small schooner appeared to be doomed somewhat earlier. She\nhad ceased to be profitable in competition with the larger, more\nmodern fore-and-after, but these battered, veteran craft died\nhard. They harked back to a simpler age, to the era of the\nstage-coach and the spinning-wheel, to the little shipyards that\nwere to be found on every bay and inlet of New England. They were\nstill owned and sailed by men who ashore were friends and\nneighbors. Even now you may find during your summer wanderings\nsome stumpy, weatherworn two-master running on for shelter\novernight, which has plied up and down the coast for fifty or\nsixty years, now leaking like a basket and too frail for winter\nvoyages. It was in a craft very much like this that your rude\nancestors went privateering against the British. Indeed, the\nlittle schooner Polly, which fought briskly in the War of 1812,\nis still afloat and loading cargoes in New England ports.",
        "These little coasters, surviving long after the stately merchant\nmarine had vanished from blue water, have enjoyed a slant of\nfavoring fortune in recent years. They, too, have been in demand,\nand once again there is money to spare for paint and cordage and\ncalking. They have been granted a new lease of life and may be\nfound moored at the wharfs, beached on the marine railways, or\nanchored in the stream, eagerly awaiting their turn to refit. It\nis a matter of vital concern that the freight on spruce boards\nfrom Bangor to New York has increased to five dollars a thousand\nfeet. Many of these craft belong to grandfatherly skippers who\ndared not venture past Cape Cod in December, lest the venerable\nMatilda Emerson or the valetudinarian Joshua R. Coggswell should\nopen up and founder in a blow. During the winter storms these\nskippers used to hug the kitchen stove in bleak farmhouses until\nspring came and they could put to sea again. The rigor of\ncircumstances, however, forced others to seek for trade the whole\nyear through. In a recent winter fifty-seven schooners were lost\non the New England coast, most of which were unfit for anything\nbut summer breezes. As by a miracle, others have been able to\nrenew their youth, to replace spongy planking and rotten stems,\nand to deck themselves out in white canvas and fresh paint!",
        "The captains of these craft foregather in the ship-chandler’s\nshops, where the floor is strewn with sawdust, the armchairs are\ncapacious, and the environment harmonizes with the tales that are\ntold. It is an informal club of coastwise skippers and the old\nenergy begins to show itself once more. They move with a brisker\ngait than when times were so hard and they went begging for\ncharters at any terms. A sinewy patriarch stumps to a window,\nflourishes his arm at an ancient two-master, and booms out:",
        "“That vessel of mine is as sound as a nut, I tell ye. She ain’t\nas big as some, but I’d like nothin’ better than to fill her full\nof suthin’ for the west coast of Africy, same as the Horace M.\nBickford that cleared t’other day, stocked for SIXTY THOUSAND\nDOLLARS.”",
        "“Huh, you’d get lost out o’ sight of land, John,” is the cruel\nretort, “and that old shoe-box of yours ’ud be scared to death\nwithout a harbor to run into every time the sun clouded over.\nExpect to navigate to Africy with an alarm-clock and a\nsoundin’-lead, I presume.”",
        "“Mebbe I’d better let well enough alone,” replies the old man.\n\"Africy don’t seem as neighborly as Phippsburg and Machiasport.\nI’ll chance it as far as Philadelphy next voyage and I guess the\nold woman can buy a new dress.”",
        "The activity and the reawakening of the old shipyards, their\nslips all filled with the frames of wooden vessels for the\nforeign trade, is like a revival of the old merchant marine, a\nreincarnation of ghostly memories. In mellowed dignity the square\nwhite houses beneath the New England elms recall to mind the\nmariners who dwelt therein. It seems as if their shipyards also\nbelonged to the past; but the summer visitor finds a fresh\nattraction in watching the new schooners rise from the stocks,\nand the gay pageant of launching them, every mast ablaze with\nbunting, draws crowds to the water-front. And as a business\nventure, with somewhat of the tang of old-fashioned romance, the\ncasual stranger is now and then tempted to purchase a\nsixty-fourth “piece” of a splendid Yankee four-master and keep in\ntouch with its roving fortunes. The shipping reports of the daily\nnewspaper prove more fascinating than the ticker tape, and the\ntidings of a successful voyage thrill one with a sense of\npersonal gratification. For the sea has not lost its magic and\nits mystery, and those who go down to it in ships must still\nbattle against elemental odds--still carry on the noble and\nenduring traditions of the Old Merchant Marine.",
