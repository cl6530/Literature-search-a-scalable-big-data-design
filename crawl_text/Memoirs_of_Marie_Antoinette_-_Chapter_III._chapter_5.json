        "A superb pavilion had been prepared upon the frontier near Kehl.  It\nconsisted of a vast salon, connected with two apartments, one of which\nwas assigned to the lords and ladies of the Court of Vienna, and the\nother to the suite of the Dauphiness, composed of the Comtesse de\nNoailles, her lady of honour; the Duchesse de Cosse, her dame d’atours;\nfour ladies of the palace; the Comte de Saulx-Tavannes, chevalier\nd’honneur; the Comte de Tesse, first equerry; the Bishop of Chartres,\nfirst almoner; the officers of the Body Guard, and the equerries.",
        "When the Dauphiness had been entirely undressed, in order that she might\nretain nothing belonging to a foreign Court (an etiquette always observed\non such an occasion), the doors were opened; the young Princess came\nforward, looking round for the Comtesse de Noailles; then, rushing into\nher arms, she implored her, with tears in her eyes, and with heartfelt\nsincerity, to be her guide and support.",
        "While doing justice to the virtues of the Comtesse de Noailles, those\nsincerely attached to the Queen have always considered it as one of her\nearliest misfortunes not to have found, in the person of her adviser,\na woman indulgent, enlightened, and administering good advice with that\namiability which disposes young persons to follow it.  The Comtesse de\nNoailles had nothing agreeable in her appearance; her demeanour was stiff\nand her mien severe.  She was perfect mistress of etiquette; but she\nwearied the young Princess with it, without making her sensible of its\nimportance.  It would have been sufficient to represent to the Dauphiness\nthat in France her dignity depended much upon customs not necessary at\nVienna to secure the respect and love of the good and submissive\nAustrians for the imperial family; but the Dauphiness was perpetually\ntormented by the remonstrances of the Comtesse de Noailles, and at the\nsame time was led by the Abbe de Vermond to ridicule both the lessons\nupon etiquette and her who gave them.  She preferred raillery to\nargument, and nicknamed the Comtesse de Noailles Madame l’Etiquette.",
        "The fetes which were given at Versailles on the marriage of the Dauphin\nwere very splendid.  The Dauphiness arrived there at the hour for her\ntoilet, having slept at La Muette, where Louis XV. had been to receive\nher; and where that Prince, blinded by a feeling unworthy of a sovereign\nand the father of a family, caused the young Princess, the royal family,\nand the ladies of the Court, to sit down to supper with Madame du Barry.",
        "The Dauphiness was hurt at this conduct; she spoke of it openly enough to\nthose with whom she was intimate, but she knew how to conceal her\ndissatisfaction in public, and her behaviour showed no signs of it.",
        "She was received at Versailles in an apartment on the ground floor, under\nthat of the late Queen, which was not ready for her until six months\nafter her marriage.",
        "The Dauphiness, then fifteen years of age, beaming with freshness,\nappeared to all eyes more than beautiful.  Her walk partook at once of\nthe dignity of the Princesses of her house, and of the grace of the\nFrench; her eyes were mild, her smile amiable.  When she went to chapel,\nas soon as she had taken the first few steps in the long gallery, she\ndiscerned, all the way to its extremity, those persons whom she ought to\nsalute with the consideration due to their rank; those on whom she should\nbestow an inclination of the head; and lastly, those who were to be\nsatisfied with a smile, calculated to console them for not being entitled\nto greater honours.",
        "Louis XV. was enchanted with the young Dauphiness; all his conversation\nwas about her graces, her vivacity, and the aptness of her repartees.\nShe was yet more successful with the royal family when they beheld her\nshorn of the splendour of the diamonds with which she had been adorned\nduring the first days of her marriage.  When clothed in a light dress of\ngauze or taffety she was compared to the Venus dei Medici, and the\nAtalanta of the Marly Gardens.  Poets sang her charms; painters attempted\nto copy her features.  One artist’s fancy led him to place the portrait\nof Marie Antoinette in the heart of a full-blown rose.  His ingenious\nidea was rewarded by Louis XV.",
        "The King continued to talk only of the Dauphiness; and Madame du Barry\nill-naturedly endeavoured to damp his enthusiasm.  Whenever Marie\nAntoinette was the topic, she pointed out the irregularity of her\nfeatures, criticised the ’bons mots’ quoted as hers, and rallied the King\nupon his prepossession in her favour.  Madame du Barry was affronted at\nnot receiving from the Dauphiness those attentions to which she thought\nherself entitled; she did not conceal her vexation from the King; she was\nafraid that the grace and cheerfulness of the young Princess would make\nthe domestic circle of the royal family more agreeable to the old\nsovereign, and that he would escape her chains; at the same time, hatred\nto the Choiseul party contributed powerfully to excite the enmity of the\nfavourite.",
        "The fall of that minister took place in November, 1770, six months after\nhis long influence in the Council had brought about the alliance with the\nHouse of Austria and the arrival of Marie Antoinette at the Court of\nFrance.  The Princess, young, frank, volatile, and inexperienced, found\nherself without any other guide than the Abbe de Vermond, in a Court\nruled by the enemy of the minister who had brought her there, and in the\nmidst of people who hated Austria, and detested any alliance with the\nimperial house.",
        "The Duc d’Aiguillon, the Duc de La Vauguyon, the Marechal de Richelieu,\nthe Rohans, and other considerable families, who had made use of Madame\ndu Barry to overthrow the Duke, could not flatter themselves,\nnotwithstanding their powerful intrigues, with a hope of being able to\nbreak off an alliance solemnly announced, and involving such high\npolitical interests.  They therefore changed their mode of attack, and it\nwill be seen how the conduct of the Dauphin served as a basis for their\nhopes.",
        "The Dauphiness continually gave proofs of both sense and feeling.\nSometimes she even suffered herself to be carried away by those\ntransports of compassionate kindness which are not to be controlled by\nthe customs which rank establishes.",
        "In consequence of the fire in the Place Louis XV., which occurred at the\ntime of the nuptial entertainments, the Dauphin and Dauphiness sent\ntheir, whole income for the year to the relief of the unfortunate\nfamilies who lost their relatives on that disastrous day.",
        "This was one of those ostentatious acts of generosity which are dictated\nby the policy of princes, at least as much as by their compassion; but\nthe grief of Marie Antoinette was profound, and lasted several days;\nnothing could console her for the loss of so many innocent victims; she\nspoke of it, weeping, to her ladies, one of whom, thinking, no doubt, to\ndivert her mind, told her that a great number of thieves had been found\namong the bodies, and that their pockets were filled with watches and\nother valuables.  “They have at least been well punished,” added the\nperson who related these particulars.  “Oh, no, no, madame!” replied the\nDauphiness; “they died by the side of honest people.”",
        "The Dauphiness had brought from Vienna a considerable number of white\ndiamonds; the King added to them the gift of the diamonds and pearls of\nthe late Dauphiness, and also put into her hands a collar of pearls, of a\nsingle row, the smallest of which was as large as a filbert, and which\nhad been brought into France by Anne of Austria, and appropriated by that\nPrincess to the use of the Queens and Dauphinesses of France.",
        "The three Princesses, daughters of Louis XV., joined in making her\nmagnificent presents.  Madame Adelaide at the same time gave the young\nPrincess a key to the private corridors of the Chateau, by means of\nwhich, without any suite, and without being perceived, she could get to\nthe apartments of her aunts, and see them in private.  The Dauphiness,\non receiving the key, told them, with infinite grace, that if they had\nmeant to make her appreciate the superb presents they were kind enough to\nbestow upon her, they should not at the same time have offered her one of\nsuch inestimable value; since to that key she should be indebted for an\nintimacy and advice unspeakably precious at her age.  She did, indeed,\nmake use of it very frequently; but Madame Victoire alone permitted her,\nso long as she continued Dauphiness, to visit her familiarly.  Madame\nAdelaide could not overcome her prejudices against Austrian princesses,\nand was wearied with the somewhat petulant gaiety of the Dauphiness.\nMadame Victoire was concerned at this, feeling that their society and\ncounsel would have been highly useful to a young person otherwise likely\nto meet with none but sycophants.  She endeavoured, therefore, to induce\nher to take pleasure in the society of the Marquise de Durfort, her lady\nof honour and favourite.  Several agreeable entertainments took place at\nthe house of this lady, but the Comtesse de Noailles and the Abbe de\nVermond soon opposed these meetings.",
        "A circumstance which happened in hunting, near the village of Acheres,\nin the forest of Fontainebleau, afforded the young Princess an\nopportunity of displaying her respect for old age, and her compassion for\nmisfortune.  An aged peasant was wounded by the stag; the Dauphiness\njumped out of her calash, placed the peasant, with his wife and children,\nin it, had the family taken back to their cottage, and bestowed upon them\nevery attention and every necessary assistance.  Her heart was always\nopen to the feelings of compassion, and the recollection of her rank\nnever restrained her sensibility.  Several persons in her service entered\nher room one evening, expecting to find nobody there but the officer in\nwaiting; they perceived the young Princess seated by the side of this\nman, who was advanced in years; she had placed near him a bowl full of\nwater, was stanching the blood which issued from a wound he had received\nin his hand with her handkerchief, which she had torn up to bind it, and\nwas fulfilling towards him all the duties of a pious sister of charity.\nThe old man, affected even to tears, out of respect allowed his august\nmistress to act as she thought proper.  He had hurt himself in\nendeavouring to move a rather heavy piece of furniture at the Princess’s\nrequest.",
        "In the month of July, 1770, an unfortunate occurrence that took place in\na family which the Dauphiness honoured with her favour contributed again\nto show not only her sensibility but also the benevolence of her\ndisposition.  One of her women in waiting had a son who was an officer in\nthe gens d’armes of the guard; this young man thought himself affronted\nby a clerk in the War Department, and imprudently sent him a challenge;\nhe killed his adversary in the forest of Compiegne.  The family of the\nyoung man who was killed, being in possession of the challenge, demanded\njustice.  The King, distressed on account of several duels which had\nrecently taken place, had unfortunately declared that he would show no\nmercy on the first event of that kind which could be proved; the culprit\nwas therefore arrested.  His mother, in the deepest grief, hastened to\nthrow herself at the feet of the Dauphiness, the Dauphin, and the young\nPrincesses.  After an hour’s supplication they obtained from the King the\nfavour so much desired.  On the next day a lady of rank, while\ncongratulating the Dauphiness, had the malice to add that the mother had\nneglected no means of success on the occasion, having solicited not only\nthe royal family, but even Madame du Barry.  The Dauphiness replied that\nthe fact justified the favourable opinion she had formed of the worthy\nwoman; that the heart of a mother should hesitate at nothing for the\nsalvation of her son; and that in her place, if she had thought it would\nbe serviceable, she would have thrown herself at the feet of Zamor.",
        "     [A little Indian who carried the Comtesse du Barry’s train.  Louis\n     XV.  often amused himself with the little marmoset, and jestingly\n     made him Governor of Louveciennes; he received an annual income of\n     3,000 francs.]",
        "Some time after the marriage entertainments the Dauphiness made her entry\ninto Paris, and was received with transports of joy.  After dining in the\nKing’s apartment at the Tuileries, she was forced, by the reiterated\nshouts of the multitude, with whom the garden was filled, to present\nherself upon the balcony fronting the principal walk.  On seeing such a\ncrowd of heads with their eyes fixed upon her, she exclaimed, “Grand-\nDieu! what a concourse!\"–\"Madame,” said the old Duc de Brissac, the\nGovernor of Paris, “I may tell you, without fear of offending the\nDauphin, that they are so many lovers.”  2 The Dauphin took no umbrage at\neither acclamations or marks of homage of which the Dauphiness was the\nobject.  The most mortifying indifference, a coldness which frequently\ndegenerated into rudeness, were the sole feelings which the young Prince\nthen manifested towards her.  Not all her charms could gain even upon his\nsenses.  This estrangement, which lasted a long time, was said to be the\nwork of the Duc de La Vauguyon.",
        "The Dauphiness, in fact, had no sincere friends at Court except the Duc\nde Choiseul and his party.  Will it be credited that the plans laid\nagainst Marie Antoinette went so far as divorce?  I have been assured of\nit by persons holding high situations at Court, and many circumstances\ntend to confirm the opinion.  On the journey to Fontainebleau, in the\nyear of the marriage, the inspectors of public buildings were gained over\nto manage so that the apartment intended for the Dauphin, communicating\nwith that of the Dauphiness, should not be finished, and a room at the\nextremity of the building was temporarily assigned to him.  The\nDauphiness, aware that this was the result of intrigue, had the courage\nto complain of it to Louis XV., who, after severe reprimands, gave orders\nso positive that within the week the apartment was ready.  Every method\nwas tried to continue or augment the indifference which the Dauphin long\nmanifested towards his youthful spouse.  She was deeply hurt at it, but\nshe never suffered herself to utter the slightest complaint on the\nsubject.  Inattention to, even contempt for, the charms which she heard\nextolled on all sides, nothing induced her to break silence; and some\ntears, which would involuntarily burst from her eyes, were the sole\nsymptoms of her inward sufferings discoverable by those in her service.",
        "Once only, when tired out with the misplaced remonstrances of an old lady\nattached to her person, who wished to dissuade her from riding on\nhorseback, under the impression that it would prevent her producing heirs\nto the crown, “Mademoiselle,” said she, “in God’s name, leave me in\npeace; be assured that I can put no heir in danger.”",
        "The Dauphiness found at the Court of Louis XV., besides the three\nPrincesses, the King’s daughters, the Princes also, brothers of the\nDauphin, who were receiving their education, and Clotilde and Elisabeth,\nstill in the care of Madame de Marsan, governess of the children of\nFrance.  The elder of the two latter Princesses, in 1777, married the\nPrince of Piedmont, afterwards King of Sardinia.  This Princess was in\nher infancy, so extremely large that the people nicknamed her ’gros\nMadame.’",
        "     [Madame Clotilde of France, a sister of the King, was\n     extraordinarily fat for her height and age.  One of her playfellows,\n     having been indiscreet enough even in her presence to make use of\n     the nickname given to her, received a severe reprimand from the\n     Comtesse de Marsan, who hinted to her that she would do well in not\n     making her appearance again before the Princess.  Madame Clotilde\n     sent for her the next day: “My governess,” said she, “has done her\n     duty, and I will do mine; come and see me as usual, and think no\n     more of a piece of inadvertence, which I myself have forgotten.\"\n     This Princess, so heavy in body, possessed the most agreeable and\n     playful wit.  Her affability and grace rendered her dear to all who\n     came near her.–NOTE BY THE EDITOR]",
        "The second Princess was the pious Elisabeth, the victim of her respect\nand tender attachment for the King, her brother.  She was still scarcely\nout of her leading-strings at the period of the Dauphin’s marriage.  The\nDauphiness showed her marked preference.  The governess, who sought to\nadvance the Princess to whom nature had been least favourable, was\noffended at the Dauphiness’s partiality for Madame Elisabeth, and by her\ninjudicious complaints weakened the friendship which yet subsisted\nbetween Madame Clotilde and Marie Antoinette.  There even arose some\ndegree of rivalry on the subject of education; and that which the Empress\nMaria Theresa bestowed on her daughters was talked of openly and\nunfavourably enough.  The Abbe de Vermond thought himself affronted,\ntook a part in the quarrel, and added his complaints and jokes to those\nof the Dauphiness on the criticisms of the governess; he even indulged\nhimself in his turn in reflections on the tuition of Madame Clotilde.\nEverything becomes known at Court.  Madame de Marsan was informed of all\nthat had been said in the Dauphiness’s circle, and was very angry with\nher on account of it.",
        "From that moment a centre of intrigue, or rather gossip, against Marie\nAntoinette was established round Madame de Marsan’s fireside; her most\ntrifling actions were there construed ill; her gaiety, and the harmless\namusements in which she sometimes indulged in her own apartments with the\nmore youthful ladies of her train, and even with the women in her\nservice, were stigmatised as criminal.  Prince Louis de Rohan, sent\nthrough the influence of this clique ambassador to Vienna, was the echo\nthere of these unmerited comments, and threw himself into a series of\nculpable accusations which he proffered under the guise of zeal.  He\nceaselessly represented the young Dauphiness as alienating all hearts by\nlevities unsuitable to the dignity of the French Court.  The Princess\nfrequently received from the Court of Vienna remonstrances, of the origin\nof which she could not long remain in ignorance.  From this period must\nbe dated that aversion which she never ceased to manifest for the Prince\nde Rohan.",
        "About the same time the Dauphiness received information of a letter\nwritten by Prince Louis to the Duc d’Aiguillon, in which the ambassador\nexpressed himself in very free language respecting the intentions of\nMaria Theresa with relation to the partition of Poland.  This letter of\nPrince Louis had been read at the Comtesse du Barry’s; the levity of the\nambassador’s correspondence wounded the feelings and the dignity of the\nDauphiness at Versailles, while at Vienna the representations which he\nmade to Maria Theresa against the young Princess terminated in rendering\nthe motives of his incessant complaints suspected by the Empress.",
        "Maria Theresa at length determined on sending her private secretary,\nBaron de Neni, to Versailles, with directions to observe the conduct of\nthe Dauphiness with attention, and form a just estimate of the opinion of\nthe Court and of Paris with regard to that Princess.  The Baron de Neni,\nafter having devoted sufficient time and intelligence to the subject,\nundeceived his sovereign as to the exaggerations of the French\nambassador; and the Empress had no difficulty in detecting, among the\ncalumnies which he had conveyed to her under the specious excuse of\nanxiety for her august daughter, proofs of the enmity of a, party which\nhad never approved of the alliance of the House of Bourbon with her own.",
        "At this period the Dauphiness, though unable to obtain any influence over\nthe heart of her husband, dreading Louis XV., and justly mistrusting\neverything connected with Madame du Barry and the Duc d’Aiguillon, had\nnot deserved the slightest reproach for that sort of levity which hatred\nand her misfortunes afterwards construed into crime.  The Empress,\nconvinced of the innocence of Marie Antoinette, directed the Baron de\nNeni to solicit the recall of the Prince de Rohan, and to inform the\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of all the motives which made her require\nit; but the House of Rohan interposed between its protege and the\nAustrian envoy, and an evasive answer merely was given.",
        "It was not until two months after the death of Louis XV.  that the Court\nof Vienna obtained his recall.  The avowed grounds for requiring it were,\nfirst, the public gallantries of Prince Louis with some ladies of the\nCourt and others; secondly, his surliness and haughtiness towards other\nforeign ministers, which would have had more serious consequences,\nespecially with the ministers of England and Denmark, if the Empress\nherself had not interfered; thirdly, his contempt for religion in a\ncountry where it was particularly necessary to show respect for it.\nHe had been seen frequently to dress himself in clothes of different\ncolours, assuming the hunting uniforms of various noblemen whom he\nvisited, with so much audacity that one day in particular, during the\nFete-Dieu, he and all his legation, in green uniforms laced with gold,\nbroke through a procession which impeded them, in order to make their way\nto a hunting party at the Prince de Paar’s; and fourthly, the immense\ndebts contracted by him and his people, which were tardily and only in\npart discharged.",
        "The succeeding marriages of the Comte de Provence and the Comte d’Artois\nwith two daughters of the King of Sardinia procured society for the\nDauphiness more suitable to her age, and altered her mode of life.",
        "A pair of tolerably fine eyes drew forth, in favour of the Comtesse de\nProvence, upon her arrival at Versailles, the only praises which could\nreasonably be bestowed upon her.  The Comtesse d’Artois, though not\ndeformed, was very small; she had a fine complexion; her face, tolerably\npleasing, was not remarkable for anything except the extreme length of\nthe nose.  But being good and generous, she was beloved by those about\nher, and even possessed some influence so long as she was the only\nPrincess who had produced heirs to the crown.",
        "From this time the closest intimacy subsisted between the three young\nfamilies.  They took their meals together, except on those days when they\ndined in public.  This manner of living en famille continued until the\nQueen sometimes indulged herself in going to dine with the Duchesse de\nPolignac, when she was governess; but the evening meetings at supper were\nnever interrupted; they took place at the house of the Comtesse de\nProvence.  Madame Elisabeth made one of the party when she had finished\nher education, and sometimes Mesdames, the King’s aunts, were invited.\nThe custom, which had no precedent at Court, was the work of Marie\nAntoinette, and she maintained it with the utmost perseverance.",
        "The Court of Versailles saw no change in point of etiquette during the\nreign of Louis XV.  Play took place at the house of the Dauphiness, as\nbeing the first lady of the State.  It had, from the death of Queen Maria\nLeczinska to the marriage of the Dauphin, been held at the abode of\nMadame Adelade.  This removal, the result of an order of precedence not\nto be violated, was not the less displeasing to Madame Adelaide, who\nestablished a separate party for play in her apartments, and scarcely\never went to that which not only the Court in general, but also the royal\nfamily, were expected to attend.  The full-dress visits to the King on\nhis ’debotter’ were continued.  High mass was attended daily.  The\nairings of the Princesses were nothing more than rapid races in berlins,\nduring which they were accompanied by Body Guards, equerries, and pages\non horseback.  They galloped for some leagues from Versailles.  Calashes\nwere used only in hunting.",
        "The young Princesses were desirous to infuse animation into their circle\nof associates by something useful as well as pleasant.  They adopted the\nplan of learning and performing all the best plays of the French theatre.\nThe Dauphin was the only spectator.  The three Princesses, the two\nbrothers of the King, and Messieurs Campan, father and son, were the sole\nperformers, but they endeavoured to keep this amusement as secret as an\naffair of State; they dreaded the censure of Mesdames, and they had no\ndoubt that Louis XV. would forbid such pastimes if he knew of them.  They\nselected for their performance a cabinet in the entresol which nobody had\noccasion to enter.",
        "A kind of proscenium, which could be taken down and shut up in a closet,\nformed the whole theatre.  The Comte de Provence always knew his part\nwith imperturbable accuracy; the Comte d’Artois knew his tolerably well,\nand recited elegantly; the Princesses acted badly.  The Dauphiness\nacquitted herself in some characters with discrimination and feeling.\nThe chief pleasure of this amusement consisted in all the costumes being\nelegant and accurate.  The Dauphin entered into the spirit of these\ndiversions, and laughed heartily at the comic characters as they came on\nthe scene; from these amusements may be dated his discontinuance of the\ntimid manner of his youth, and his taking pleasure in the society of the\nDauphiness.",
        "It was not till a long time afterwards that I learnt these particulars,\nM. Campan having kept the secret; but an unforeseen event had well-nigh\nexposed the whole mystery.  One day the Queen desired M. Campan to go\ndown into her closet to fetch something that she had forgotten; he was\ndressed for the character of Crispin, and was rouged.  A private\nstaircase led direct to the entresol through the dressing-room.  M.\nCampan fancied he heard some noise, and remained still, behind the door,\nwhich was shut.  A servant belonging to the wardrobe, who was, in fact,\non the staircase, had also heard some noise, and, either from fear or\ncuriosity, he suddenly opened the door; the figure of Crispin frightened\nhim so that he fell down backwards, shouting with his might, “Help!\nhelp!”  My father-in-law raised him up, made him recognise his voice,\nand laid upon him an injunction of silence as to what he had seen.\nHe felt himself, however, bound to inform the Dauphiness of what had\nhappened, and she was afraid that a similar occurrence might betray their\namusements.  They were therefore discontinued.",
        "The Princess occupied her time in her own apartment in the study of music\nand the parts in plays which she had to learn; the latter exercise, at\nleast, produced the beneficial effect of strengthening her memory and\nfamiliarising her with the French language.",
        "While Louis XV.  reigned, the enemies of Marie Antoinette made no attempt\nto change public opinion with regard to her.  She was always popular with\nthe French people in general, and particularly with the inhabitants of\nParis, who went on every opportunity to Versailles, the majority of them\nattracted solely by the pleasure of seeing her.  The courtiers did not\nfully enter into the popular enthusiasm which the Dauphiness had\ninspired; the disgrace of the Duc de Choiseul had removed her real\nsupport from her; and the party which had the ascendency at Court since\nthe exile of that minister was, politically, as much opposed to her\nfamily as to herself.  The Dauphiness was therefore surrounded by enemies\nat Versailles.",
        "Nevertheless everybody appeared outwardly desirous to please her; for the\nage of Louis XV., and the apathetic character of the Dauphin,\nsufficiently warned courtiers of the important part reserved for the\nPrincess during the following reign, in case the Dauphin should become\nattached to her.",
