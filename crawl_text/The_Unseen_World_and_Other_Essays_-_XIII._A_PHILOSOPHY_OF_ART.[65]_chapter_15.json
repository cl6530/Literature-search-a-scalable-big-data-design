        "[65] The Philosophy of Art. By H. Taine. New York: Leypoldt &;\nHolt. 1867.",
        "We are glad of a chance to introduce to our readers one of the\nworks of a great writer. Though not yet[66] widely known in this\ncountry, M. Taine has obtained a very high reputation in Europe.\nHe is still quite a young man, but is nevertheless the author of\nnineteen goodly volumes, witty, acute, and learned; and already\nhe is often ranked with Renan, Littre, and Sainte-Beuve, the\ngreatest living French writers.",
        "[66] That is, in 1868.",
        "Hippolyte Adolphe Taine was born at Vouziers, among the grand\nforests of Ardennes, in 1828, and is therefore about forty years\nold. His family was simple in habits and tastes, and entertained\na steadfast belief in culture, along with the possession of a\nfair amount of it. His grandfather was sub-prefect at Rocroi, in\n1814 and 1815, under the first restoration of the Bourbons. His\nfather, a lawyer by profession, was the first instructor of his\nson, and taught him Latin, and from an uncle, who had been in\nAmerica, he learned English, while still a mere child. Having\ngone to Paris with his mother in 1842, he began his studies at\nthe College Bourbon and in 1848 was promoted to the ecole\nNormale. Weiss, About, and Prevost-Paradol were his\ncontemporaries at this institution. At that time great liberty\nwas enjoyed in regard to the order and the details of the\nexercises; so that Taine, with his surprising rapidity, would do\nin one week the work laid out for a month, and would spend the\nremainder of the time in private reading. In 1851 he left\ncollege, and after two or three unsatisfactory attempts at\nteaching, in Paris and in the provinces, he settled down at Paris\nas a private student. He gave himself the very best elementary\npreparation which a literary man can have,—a thorough course in\nmathematics and the physical sciences. His studies in anatomy and\nphysiology were especially elaborate and minute. He attended the\nSchool of Medicine as regularly as if he expected to make his\ndaily bread in the profession. In this way, when at the age of\ntwenty-five he began to write books, M. Taine was a really\neducated man; and his books show it. The day is past when a man\ncould write securely, with a knowledge of the classics alone. We\ndoubt if a philosophical critic is perfectly educated for his\ntask, unless he can read, for instance, Donaldson’s “New\nCratylus” on the one hand, and Rokitansky’s “Pathological\nAnatomy” on the other, for the sheer pleasure of the thing. At\nany rate, it was an education of this sort which M. Taine, at the\noutset of his literary career, had secured. By this solid\ndiscipline of mathematics, chemistry, and medicine, M. Taine\nbecame that which above all things he now is,—a man possessed of\na central philosophy, of an exact, categorical, well-defined\nsystem, which accompanies and supports him in his most distant\nliterary excursions. He does not keep throwing out ideas at\nrandom, like too many literary critics, but attaches all his\ncriticisms to a common fundamental principle; in short, he is not\na dilettante, but a savant.",
        "His treatise on La Fontaine, in 1853, attracted much attention,\nboth the style and the matter being singularly fresh and\noriginal. He has since republished it, with alterations which\nserve to show that he can be docile toward intelligent\ncriticisms. About the same time he prepared for the French\nAcademy his work upon the historian Livy, which was crowned in\n1855. Suffering then from overwork, he was obliged to make a\nshort journey to the Pyrenees, which he has since described in a\ncharming little volume, illustrated by Dore.",
        "His subsequent works are a treatise on the French philosophers of\nthe present century, in which the vapid charlatanism of M. Cousin\nis satisfactorily dealt with; a history of English literature in\nfive volumes; a humorous book on Paris; three volumes upon the\ngeneral theory of art; and two volumes of travels in Italy;\nbesides a considerable collection of historical and critical\nessays. We think that several of these works would be interesting\nto the American public, and might profitably be translated.",
        "Some three or four years ago, M. Taine was appointed Professor in\nthe ecole des Beaux Arts, and we suppose his journey to Italy\nmust have been undertaken partly with a view to qualify himself\nfor his new position. He visited the four cities which may be\nconsidered the artistic centres of Italy,—Rome, Naples,\nFlorence, and Venice,—and a large part of his account of his\njourney is taken up with descriptions and criticisms of pictures,\nstatues, and buildings.",
        "This is a department of criticism which, we may as well frankly\nacknowledge, is far better appreciated on the continent of Europe\nthan in England or America. Over the English race there passed,\nabout two centuries ago, a deluge of Puritanism, which for a time\nalmost drowned out its artistic tastes and propensities. The\nPuritan movement, in proportion to its success, was nearly as\ndestructive to art in the West, as Mohammedanism had long before\nbeen in the East. In its intense and one-sided regard for\nmorality, Puritanism not only relegated the love for beauty to an\ninferior place, but contemned and spat upon it, as something\nsinful and degrading. Hence, the utter architectural impotence\nwhich characterizes the Americans and the modern English; and\nhence the bewildered ignorant way in which we ordinarily\ncontemplate pictures and statues. For two centuries we have been\nremoved from an artistic environment, and consequently can with\ndifficulty enter into the feelings of those who have all this\ntime been nurtured in love for art, and belief in art for its own\nsake. These peculiarities, as Mr. Mill has ably pointed out, have\nentered deep into our ethnic character. Even in pure morals there\nis a radical difference between the Englishman and the inhabitant\nof the continent of Europe. The Englishman follows virtue from a\nsense of duty, the Frenchman from an emotional aspiration toward\nthe beautiful The one admires a noble action because it is right,\nthe other because it is attractive. And this difference underlies\nthe moral judgments upon men and events which are to be found\nrespectively in English and in continental literature. By keeping\nit constantly in view, we shall be enabled to understand many\nthings which might otherwise surprise us in the writings of\nFrench authors.",
        "We are now slowly outgrowing the extravagances of Puritanism. It\nhas given us an earnestness and sobriety of character, to which\nmuch of our real greatness is owing, both here and in the mother\ncountry. It has made us stronger and steadier, but it has at the\nsame time narrowed us in many respects, and rendered our lives\nincomplete. This incompleteness, entailed by Puritanism, we are\ngradually getting rid of; and we are learning to admire and\nrespect many things upon which Puritanism set its mark of\ncontempt. We are beginning, for instance, to recognize the\ntranscendent merits of that great civilizing agency, the drama;\nwe no longer think it necessary that our temples for worshipping\nGod should be constructed like hideous barracks; we are gradually\npermitting our choirs to discard the droning and sentimental\nmodern “psalm-tune” for the inspiring harmonies of Beethoven and\nMozart; and we admit the classical picture and the undraped\nstatue to a high place in our esteem. Yet with all this it will\nprobably be some time before genuine art ceases to be an exotic\namong us, and becomes a plant of unhindered native growth. It\nwill be some time before we cease to regard pictures and statues\nas a higher species of upholstery, and place them in the same\ncategory with poems and dramas, duly reverencing them as\nauthentic revelations of the beauty which is to be found in\nnature. It will be some time before we realize that art is a\nthing to be studied, as well as literature, and before we can be\nquite reconciled to the familiar way in which a Frenchman quotes\na picture as we would quote a poem or novel.",
        "Artistic genius, as M. Taine has shown, is something which will\ndevelop itself only under peculiar social circumstances; and,\ntherefore, if we have not art, we can perhaps only wait for it,\ntrusting that when the time comes it will arise among us. But\nwithout originating, we may at least intelligently appreciate.\nThe nature of a work of art, and the mode in which it is\nproduced, are subjects well worthy of careful study. Architecture\nand music, poetry, painting and sculpture, have in times past\nconstituted a vast portion of human activity; and without knowing\nsomething of the philosophy of art, we need not hope to\nunderstand thoroughly the philosophy of history.",
        "In entering upon the study of art in general, one may find many\nsuggestive hints in the little books of M. Taine, reprinted from\nthe lectures which he has been delivering at the ecole des Beaux\nArts. The first, on the Philosophy of Art, designated at the head\nof this paper, is already accessible to the American reader; and\ntranslations of the others are probably soon to follow. We shall\nfor the present give a mere synopsis of M. Taine’s general views.",
        "And first it must be determined what a work of art is. Leaving\nfor a while music and architecture out of consideration, it will\nbe admitted that poetry, painting, and sculpture have one obvious\ncharacter in common: they are arts of IMITATION. This, says\nTaine, appears at first sight to be their essential character. It\nwould appear that their great object is to IMITATE as closely as\npossible. It is obvious that a statue is intended to imitate a\nliving man, that a picture is designed to represent real persons\nin real attitudes, or the interior of a house, or a landscape,\nsuch as it exists in nature. And it is no less clear that a novel\nor drama endeavours to represent with accuracy real characters,\nactions, and words, giving as precise and faithful an image of\nthem as possible. And when the imitation is incomplete, we say to\nthe painter, “Your people are too largely proportioned, and the\ncolour of your trees is false\"; we tell the sculptor that his leg\nor arm is incorrectly modelled; and we say to the dramatist,\n“Never has a man felt or thought as your hero is supposed to have\nfelt and thought.”",
        "This truth, moreover, is seen. both in the careers of individual\nartists, and in the general history of art. According to Taine,\nthe life of an artist may generally be divided into two parts. In\nthe first period, that of natural growth, he studies nature\nanxiously and minutely, he keeps the objects themselves before\nhis eyes, and strives to represent them with scrupulous fidelity.\nBut when the time for mental growth ends, as it does with every\nman, and the crystallization of ideas and impressions commences,\nthen the mind of the artist is no longer so susceptible to new\nimpressions from without. He begins to nourish himself from his\nown substance. He abandons the living model, and with recipes\nwhich he has gathered in the course of his experience, he\nproceeds to construct a drama or novel, a picture or statue. Now,\nthe first period, says Taine, is that of genuine art; the second\nis that of mannerism. Our author cites the case of Michael\nAngelo, a man who was one of the most colossal embodiments of\nphysical and mental energy that the world has ever seen. In\nMichael Angelo’s case, the period of growth, of genuine art, may\nbe said to have lasted until after his sixtieth year. But look,\nsays Taine, at the works which he executed in his old age;\nconsider the Conversion of St. Paul, and the Last Judgment,\npainted when he was nearly seventy. Even those who are not\nconnoisseurs can see that these frescos are painted by rule, that\nthe artist, having stocked his memory with a certain set of\nforms, is making use of them to fill out his tableau; that he\nwantonly multiplies queer attitudes and ingenious\nforeshortenings; that the lively invention, the grand outburst of\nfeeling, the perfect truth, by which his earlier works are\ndistinguished, have disappeared; and that, if he is still\nsuperior to all others, he is nevertheless inferior to himself.\nThe careers of Scott, of Goethe, and of Voltaire will furnish\nparallel examples. In every school of art, too, the flourishing\nperiod is followed by one of decline; and in every case the\ndecline is due to a failure to imitate the living models. In\npainting, we have the exaggerated foreshorteners and\nmuscle-makers who copied Michael Angelo; the lovers of theatrical\ndecorations who succeeded Titian and Giorgione and the degenerate\nboudoir-painters who followed Claucle and Poussin. In literature,\nwe have the versifiers, epigrammatists, and rhetors of the Latin\ndecadence; the sensual and declamatory dramatists who represent\nthe last stages of old English comedy; and the makers of sonnets\nand madrigals, or conceited euphemists of the Gongora school, in\nthe decline of Italian and Spanish poetry. Briefly it may be\nsaid, that the masters copy nature and the pupils copy the\nmasters. In this way are explained the constantly recurring\nphenomena of decline in art, and thus, also, it is seen that art\nis perfect in proportion as it successfully imitates nature.",
        "But we are not to conclude that absolute imitation is the sole\nand entire object of art. Were this the case, the finest works\nwould be those which most minutely correspond to their external\nprototypes. In sculpture, a mould taken from the living features\nis that which gives the most faithful representation of the\nmodel; but a well-moulded bust is far from being equal to a good\nstatue. Photography is in many respects more accurate than\npainting; but no one would rank a photograph, however exquisitely\nexecuted, with an original picture. And finally, if exact\nimitation were the supreme object of art, the best tragedy, the\nbest comedy, and the best drama would be a stenographic report of\nthe proceedings in a court of justice, in a family gathering, in\na popular meeting, in the Rump Congress. Even the works of\nartists are not rated in proportion to their minute exactness.\nNeither in painting nor in any other art do we give the\nprecedence to that which deceives the eye simply. Every one\nremembers how Zeuxis was said to have painted grapes so\nfaithfully that the birds came and pecked at them; and how,\nParrhasios, his rival, surpassed even this feat by painting a\ncurtain so natural in its appearance that Zeuxis asked him to\npull it aside and show the picture behind it. All this is not\nart, but mere knack and trickery. Perhaps no painter was ever so\nminute as Denner. It used to take him four years to make one\nportrait. He would omit nothing,—neither the bluish lines made\nby the veins under the skin, nor the little black points\nscattered over the nose, nor the bright spots in the eye where\nneighbouring objects are reflected; the head seems to start out\nfrom the canvas, it is so like flesh and blood. Yet who cares for\nDenner’s portraits? And who would not give ten times as much for\none which Van Dyck or Tintoretto might have painted in a few\nhours? So in the churches of Naples and Spain we find statues\ncoloured and draped, saints clothed in real coats, with their\nskin yellow and bloodless, their hands bleeding, and their feet\nbruised; and beside them Madonnas in royal habiliments, in gala\ndresses of lustrous silk, adorned with diadems, precious\nnecklaces, bright ribbons, and elegant laces, with their cheeks\nrosy, their eyes brilliant, their eyelashes sweeping. And by this\nexcess of literal imitation, there is awakened a feeling, not of\npleasure, but always of repugnance, often of disgust, and\nsometimes of horror So in literature, the ancient Greek theatre,\nand the best Spanish and English dramatists, alter on purpose the\nnatural current of human speech, and make their characters talk\nunder all the restraints of rhyme and rhythm. But we pronounce\nthis departure from literal truth a merit and not a defect. We\nconsider Goethe’s second “Iphigenie,” written in verse, far\npreferable to the first one written in prose; nay, it is the\nrhythm or metre itself which communicates to the work its\nincomparable beauty. In a review of Longfellow’s “Dante,\"\npublished last year, we argued this very point in one of its\nspecial applications; the artist must copy his original, but he\nmust not copy it too literally.",
        "What then must he copy? He must copy, says Taine, the mutual\nrelations and interdependences of the parts of his model. And\nmore than this, he must render the essential characteristic of\nthe object—that characteristic upon which all the minor\nqualities depend—as salient and conspicuous as possible. He must\nput into the background the traits which conceal it, and bring\ninto the foreground the traits which manifest it. If he is\nsculpturing a group like the Laocoon, he must strike upon the\nsupreme moment, that in which the whole tragedy reveals itself,\nand he must pass over those insignificant details of position and\nmovement which serve only to distract our attention and weaken\nour emotions by dividing them. If he is writing a drama, he must\nnot attempt to give us the complete biography of his character;\nhe must depict only those situations which stand in direct\nsubordination to the grand climax or denoument. As a final\nresult, therefore. Taine concludes that a work of art is a\nconcrete representation of the relations existing between the\nparts of an object, with the intent to bring the essential or\ndominating character thereof into prominence.",
        "We should overrun our limits if we were to follow out the\nadmirable discussion in which M. Taine extends this definition to\narchitecture and music. These closely allied arts are\ndistinguished from poetry, painting, and sculpture, by appealing\nfar less directly to the intelligence, and far more exclusively\nto the emotions. Yet these arts likewise aim, by bringing into\nprominence certain relations of symmetry in form as perceived by\nthe eye, or in aerial vibrations as perceived by the ear, to\nexcite in us the states of feeling with which these species of\nsymmetry are by subtle laws of association connected. They, too,\nimitate, not literally, but under the guidance of a predominating\nsentiment or emotion, relations which really exist among the\nphenomena of nature. And here, too, we estimate excellence, not\nin proportion to the direct, but to the indirect imitation. A\nGothic cathedral is not, as has been supposed, directly imitated\nfrom the towering vegetation of Northern forests; but it may well\nbe the expression of the dim sentiment of an unseen,\nall-pervading Power, generated by centuries of primeval life amid\nsuch forests. So the sounds which in a symphony of Beethoven are\nwoven into a web of such amazing complexity may exist in\ndifferent combinations in nature; but when a musician steps out\nof his way to imitate the crowing of cocks or the roar of the\ntempest, we regard his achievement merely as a graceful conceit.\nArt is, therefore, an imitation of nature; but it is an\nintellectual and not a mechanical imitation; and the performances\nof the camera and the music-box are not to be classed with those\nof the violinist’s bow or the sculptor’s chisel.",
        "And lastly, in distinguishing art from science, Taine remarks,\nthat in disengaging from their complexity the, causes which are\nat work in nature, and the fundamental laws according to which\nthey work, science describes them in abstract formulas conveyed\nin technical language. But art reveals these operative causes and\nthese dominant laws, not in arid definitions, inaccessible to\nmost people, intelligible only to specially instructed men, but\nin a concrete symbol, addressing itself not only to the\nunderstanding, but still more to the sentiments of the ordinary\nman. Art has, therefore, this peculiarity, that it is at once\nelevated and popular, that it manifests that which is often most\nrecondite, and that it manifests it to all.",
        "Having determined what a work of art is, our author goes on to\nstudy the social conditions under which works of art are\nproduced; and he concludes that the general character of a work\nof art is determined by the state of intellect and morals in the\nsociety in which it is executed. There is, in fact, a sort of\nmoral temperature which acts upon mental development much as\nphysical temperature acts upon organic development. The condition\nof society does not produce the artist’s talent; but it assists\nor checks its efforts to display itself; it decides whether or\nnot it shall be successful And it exerts a “natural selection\"\nbetween different kinds of talents, stimulating some and starving\nothers. To make this perfectly clear, we will cite at some length\nTaine’s brilliant illustration.",
        "The case chosen for illustration is a very simple one,—that of a\nstate of society in which one of the predominant feelings is\nmelancholy. This is not an arbitrary supposition, for such a time\nhas occurred more than once in human history; in Asia, in the\nsixth century before Christ, and especially in Europe, from the\nfourth to the tenth centuries of our era. To produce such a state\nof feeling, five or six generations of decadence, accompanied\nwith diminution of population, foreign invasions, famines,\npestilences, and increasing difficulty in procuring the\nnecessaries of life, are amply sufficient. It then happens that\nmen lose courage and hope, and consider life an evil. Now,\nadmitting that among the artists who live in such a time, there\nare likely to be the same relative numbers of melancholy, joyous,\nor indifferent temperaments as at other times, let us see how\nthey will be affected by reigning circumstances.",
        "Let us first remember, says Taine, that the evils which depress\nthe public will also depress the artist. His risks are no less\nthan those of less gifted people. He is liable to suffer from\nplague or famine, to be ruined by unfair taxation or\nconscription, or to see his children massacred and his wife led\ninto captivity by barbarians. And if these ills do not reach him\npersonally, he must at least behold those around him affected by\nthem. In this way, if he is joyous by temperament, he must\ninevitably become less joyous; if he is melancholy, he must\nbecome more melancholy.",
        "Secondly, having been reared among melancholy contemporaries, his\neducation will have exerted upon him a corresponding influence.\nThe prevailing religious doctrine, accommodated to the state of\naffairs, will tell him that the earth is a place of exile, life\nan evil, gayety a snare, and his most profitable occupation will\nbe to get ready to die. Philosophy, constructing its system of\nmorals in conformity to the existing phenomena of decadence, will\ntell him that he had better never have been born. Daily\nconversation will inform him of horrible events, of the\ndevastation of a province, the sack of a town by the Goths, the\noppression of the neighbouring peasants by the imperial\ntax-collectors, or the civil war that has just burst out between\nhalf a dozen pretenders to the throne. As he travels about, he\nbeholds signs of mourning and despair, crowds of beggars, people\ndying of hunger, a broken bridge which no one is mending, an\nabandoned suburb which is going to ruin, fields choked with\nweeds, the blackened walls of burned houses. Such sights and\nimpressions, repeated from childhood to old age (and we must\nremember that this has actually been the state of things in what\nare now the fairest parts of the globe), cannot fail to deepen\nwhatever elements of melancholy there may be already in the\nartist’s disposition.",
        "The operation of all these causes will be enhanced by that very\npeculiarity of the artist which constitutes his talent. For,\naccording to the definitions above given, that which makes him an\nartist is his capacity for seizing upon the essential\ncharacteristics and the salient traits of surrounding objects and\nevents. Other men see things in part fragmentarily; he catches\nthe spirit of the ensemble. And in this way he will very likely\nexaggerate in his works the general average of contemporary\nfeeling.",
        "Lastly, our author reminds us that a man who writes or paints\ndoes not remain alone before his easel or his writing-desk. He\ngoes out, looks about him, receives suggestions from friends,\nfrom rivals, from books, and works of art whenever accessible,\nand hears the criticisms of the public upon his own productions\nand those of his contemporaries. In order to succeed, he must not\nonly satisfy to some extent the popular taste, but he must feel\nthat the public is in sympathy with him. If in this period of\nsocial decadence and gloom he endeavours to represent gay,\nbrilliant, or triumphant ideas, he will find himself left to his\nown resources; and, as Taine rightly says, the power of an\nisolated man is always insignificant. His work will be likely to\nbe mediocre. If he attempts to write like Rabelais or paint like\nRubens, he will get neither assistance nor sympathy from a public\nwhich prefers the pictures of Rembrandt, the melodies of Chopin,\nand the poetry of Heine.",
        "Having thus explained his position by this extreme instance,\nsignified for the sake of clearness, Taine goes on to apply such\ngeneral considerations to four historic epochs, taken in all\ntheir complexity. He discusses the aspect presented by art in\nancient Greece, in the feudal and Catholic Middle Ages, in the\ncentralized monarchies of the seventeenth century, and in the\nscientific, industrial democracy in which we now live. Out of\nthese we shall select, as perhaps the simplest, the case of\nancient Greece, still following our author closely, though\nnecessarily omitting many interesting details.",
        "The ancient Greeks, observes Taine, understood life in a new and\noriginal manner. Their energies were neither absorbed by a great\nreligious conception, as in the case of the Hindus and Egyptians,\nnor by a vast social organization, as in the case of the\nAssyrians and Persians, nor by a purely industrial and commercial\nregime, as in the case of the Phoenicians and Carthaginians.\nInstead of a theocracy or a rigid system of castes, instead of a\nmonarchy with a hierarchy of civil officials, the men of this\nrace invented a peculiar institution, the City, each city giving\nrise to others like itself, and from colony to colony reproducing\nitself indefinitely. A single Greek city, for instance, Miletos,\nproduced three hundred other cities, colonizing with them the\nentire coast of the Black Sea. Each city was substantially\nself-ruling; and the idea of a coalescence of several cities into\na nation was one which the Greek mind rarely conceived, and never\nwas able to put into operation.",
        "In these cities, labour was for the most part carried on by\nslaves. In Athens there were four or five for each citizen, and\nin places like Korinth and Aigina the slave population is said to\nhave numbered four or five hundred thousand. Besides, the Greek\ncitizen had little need of personal service. He lived out of\ndoors, and, like most Southern people, was comparatively\nabstemious in his habits. His dinners were slight, his clothing\nwas simple, his house was scantily furnished, being intended\nchiefly for a den to sleep in.",
        "Serving neither king nor priest, the citizen was free and\nsovereign in his own city. He elected his own magistrates, and\nmight himself serve as city-ruler, as juror, or as judge.\nRepresentation was unknown. Legislation was carried on by all the\ncitizens assembled in mass. Therefore politics and war were the\nsole or chief employments of the citizen. War, indeed, came in\nfor no slight share of his attention. For society was not so well\nprotected as in these modern days. Most of these Greek cities,\nscattered over the coasts of the Aigeian, the Black Sea, and the\nMediterranean, were surrounded by tribes of barbarians,\nScythians, Gauls Spaniards, and Africans. The citizen must\ntherefore keep on his guard, like the Englishman of to-day in New\nZealand, or like the inhabitant of a Massachusetts town in tho\nseventeenth century. Otherwise Gauls Samnites, or Bithynians, as\nsavage as North American Indians, would be sure to encamp upon\nthe blackened ruins of his town. Moreover, the Greek cities had\ntheir quarrels with each other, and their laws of war were very\nbarbarous. A conquered city was liable to be razed to the ground,\nits male inhabitants put to the sword, its women sold as slaves.\nUnder such circumstances, according to Taine’s happy expression,\na citizen must be a politician and warrior, on pain of death. And\nnot only fear, but ambition also tended to make him so. For each\ncity strove to subject or to humiliate its neighbours, to acquire\ntribute, or to exact homage from its rivals. Thus the citizen\npassed his life in the public square, discussing alliances,\ntreaties, and constitutions, hearing speeches, or speaking\nhimself, and finally going aboard of his ship to fight his\nneighbour Greeks, or to sail against Egypt or Persia.",
        "War (and politics as subsidiary to it) was then the chief pursuit\nof life. But as there was no organized industry, so there were no\nmachines of warfare. All fighting was done hand to hand.\nTherefore, the great thing in preparing for war was not to\ntransform the soldiers into precisely-acting automata, as in a\nmodern army, but to make each separate soldier as vigorous and\nactive as possible. The leading object of Greek education was to\nmake men physically perfect. In this respect, Sparta may be taken\nas the typical Greek community, for nowhere else was physical\ndevelopment so entirely made the great end of social life. In\nthese matters Sparta was always regarded by the other cities as\ntaking the lead,—as having attained the ideal after which all\nalike were striving. Now Sparta, situated in the midst of a\nnumerous conquered population of Messenians and Helots, was\npartly a great gymnasium and partly a perpetual camp. Her\ncitizens were always in training. The entire social constitution\nof Sparta was shaped with a view to the breeding and bringing up\nof a strong and beautiful race. Feeble or ill-formed infants were\nput to death. The age at which citizens might marry was\nprescribed by law; and the State paired off men and women as the\nmodern breeder pairs off horses, with a sole view to the\nexcellence of the off-spring. A wife was not a helpmate, but a\nbearer of athletes. Women boxed, wrestled, and raced; a\ncircumstance referred to in the following passage of\nAristophanes, as rendered by Mr. Felton:—",
        "The young men lived together, like soldiers in a camp. They ate\nout-of-doors, at a public table. Their fare was as simple as that\nof a modern university boat-crew before a race. They slept in the\nopen air, and spent their waking hours in wrestling, boxing,\nrunning races, throwing quoits, and engaging in mock battles.\nThis was the way in which the Spartans lived; and though no other\ncity carried this discipline to such an extent, yet in all a very\nlarge portion of the citizen’s life was spent in making himself\nhardy and robust.",
        "The ideal man, in the eyes of a Greek, was, therefore not the\ncontemplative or delicately susceptible thinker but the naked\nathlete, with firm flesh and swelling muscles. Most of their\nbarbarian neighbours were ashamed to be seen undressed, but the\nGreeks seem to have felt little embarrassment in appearing naked\nin public. Their gymnastic habits entirely transformed their\nsense of shame. Their Olympic and other public games were a\ntriumphant display of naked physical perfection. Young men of the\nnoblest families and from the farthest Greek colonies came to\nthem, and wrestled and ran, undraped, before countless multitudes\nof admiring spectators. Note, too, as significant, that the Greek\nera began with the Olympic games, and that time was reckoned by\nthe intervals between them; as well as the fact that the grandest\nlyric poetry of antiquity was written in celebration of these\ngymnastic contests. The victor in the foot-race gave his name to\nthe current Olympiad; and on reaching home, was received by his\nfellow-citizens as if he had been a general returning from a\nsuccessful campaign. To be the most beautiful man in Greece was\nin the eyes of a Greek the height of human felicity; and with the\nGreeks, beauty necessarily included strength. So ardently did\nthis gifted people admire corporeal perfection that they actually\nworshipped it. According to Herodotos, a young Sicilian was\ndeified on account of his beauty, and after his death altars were\nraised to him. The vast intellectual power of Plato and Sokrates\ndid not prevent them from sharing this universal enthusiasm.\nPoets like Sophokles, and statesmen like Alexander, thought it\nnot beneath their dignity to engage publicly in gymnastic sports.",
        "Their conceptions of divinity were framed in accordance with\nthese general habits. Though sometimes, as in the case of\nHephaistos, the exigencies of the particular myth required the\ndeity to be physically imperfect, yet ordinarily the Greek god\nwas simply an immortal man, complete in strength and beauty. The\ndeity was not invested with the human form as a mere symbol. They\ncould conceive no loftier way of representing him. The grandest\nstatue, expressing most adequately the calmness of absolutely\nunfettered strength, might well, in their eyes, be a veritable\nportrait of divinity. To a Greek, beauty of form was a\nconsecrated thing. More than once a culprit got off with his life\nbecause it would have been thought sacrilegious to put an end to\nsuch a symmetrical creature. And for a similar reason, the\nGreeks, though perhaps not more humane than the Europeans of the\nMiddle Ages, rarely allowed the human body to be mutilated or\ntortured. The condemned criminal must be marred as little as\npossible; and he was, therefore, quietly poisoned, instead of\nbeing hung, beheaded, or broken on the wheel.",
        "Is not the unapproachable excellence of Greek statuary—that art\nnever since equalled, and most likely, from the absence of the\nneedful social stimulus, destined never to be equalled—already\nsufficiently explained? Consider, says our author, the nature of\nthe Greek sculptor’s preparation. These men have observed the\nhuman body naked and in movement, in the bath and the gymnasium,\nin sacred dances and public games. They have noted those forms\nand attitudes in which are revealed vigour, health, and activity.\nAnd during three or four hundred years they have thus modified,\ncorrected and developed their notions of corporeal beauty. There\nis, therefore, nothing surprising in the fact that Greek\nsculpture finally arrived at the ideal model, the perfect type,\nas it was, of the human body. Our highest notions of physical\nbeauty, down to the present day, have been bequeathed to us by\nthe Greeks. The earliest modern sculptors who abandoned the bony,\nhideous, starveling figures of the monkish Middle Ages, learned\ntheir first lessons in better things from Greek bas-reliefs. And\nif, to-day, forgetting our half-developed bodies, inefficiently\nnourished, because of our excessive brain-work, and with their\nmuscles weak and flabby from want of strenuous exercise, we wish\nto contemplate the human form in its grandest perfection, we must\ngo to Hellenic art for our models.",
        "The Greeks were, in the highest sense of the word, an\nintellectual race; but they never allowed the mind to tyrannize\nover the body. Spiritual perfection, accompanied by corporeal\nfeebleness, was the invention of asceticism; and the Greeks were\nnever ascetics. Diogenes might scorn superfluous luxuries, but if\nhe ever rolled and tumbled his tub about as Rabelais says he did,\nit is clear that the victory of spirit over body formed no part\nof his theory of things. Such an idea would have been\nincomprehensible to a Greek in Plato’s time. Their consciences\nwere not over active. They were not burdened with a sense of\nsinfulness. Their aspirations were decidedly finite; and they\nbelieved in securing the maximum completeness of this terrestrial\nlife. Consequently they never set the physical below the\nintellectual. To return to our author, they never, in their\nstatues, subordinated symmetry to expression, the body to the\nhead. They were interested not only in the prominence of the\nbrows, the width of the forehead, and the curvature of the lips,\nbut quite as much in the massiveness of the chest, the\ncompactness of the thighs, and the solidity of the arms and legs.\nNot only the face, but the whole body, had for them its\nphysiognomy. They left picturesqueness to the painter, and\ndramatic fervour to the poet; and keeping strictly before their\neyes the narrow but exalted problem of representing the beauty of\nsymmetry, they filled their sanctuaries and public places with\nthose grand motionless people of brass, gold, ivory, copper, and\nmarble, in whom humanity recognizes its highest artistic types.\nStatuary was the central art of Greece. No other art was so\npopular, or so completely expressed the national life. The number\nof statues was enormous. In later days, when Rome had spoiled the\nGreek world of its treasures, the Imperial City possessed a\npopulation of statues almost equal in number to its population of\nhuman beings. And at the present day, after all the destructive\naccidents of so many intervening centuries, it is estimated that\nmore than sixty thousand statues have been obtained from Rome and\nits suburbs alone.",
        "In citing this admirable exposition as a specimen of M. Taine’s\nmethod of dealing with his subject, we have refrained from\ndisturbing the pellucid current of thought by criticisms of our\nown. We think the foregoing explanation correct enough, so far as\nit goes, though it deals with the merest rudiments of the\nsubject, and really does nothing toward elucidating the deeper\nmysteries of artistic production. For this there is needed a\nprofounder psychology than M. Taine’s. But whether his theory of\nart be adequate or not, there can be but one opinion as to the\nbrilliant eloquence with which it is set forth.",
