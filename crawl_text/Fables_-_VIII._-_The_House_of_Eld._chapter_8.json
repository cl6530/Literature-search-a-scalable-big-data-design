        "So soon as the child began to speak, the gyve was riveted; and the \nboys and girls limped about their play like convicts.  Doubtless it \nwas more pitiable to see and more painful to bear in youth; but \neven the grown folk, besides being very unhandy on their feet, were \noften sick with ulcers.",
        "About the time when Jack was ten years old, many strangers began to \njourney through that country.  These he beheld going lightly by on \nthe long roads, and the thing amazed him.  “I wonder how it comes,” \nhe asked, “that all these strangers are so quick afoot, and we must \ndrag about our fetter?”",
        "“My dear boy,” said his uncle, the catechist, “do not complain \nabout your fetter, for it is the only thing that makes life worth \nliving.  None are happy, none are good, none are respectable, that \nare not gyved like us.  And I must tell you, besides, it is very \ndangerous talk.  If you grumble of your iron, you will have no \nluck; if ever you take it off, you will be instantly smitten by a \nthunderbolt.”",
        "“Are there no thunderbolts for these strangers?” asked Jack.",
        "“Jupiter is longsuffering to the benighted,” returned the \ncatechist.",
        "“Upon my word, I could wish I had been less fortunate,” said Jack.  \n“For if I had been born benighted, I might now be going free; and \nit cannot be denied the iron is inconvenient, and the ulcer hurts.”",
        "“Ah!” cried his uncle, “do not envy the heathen!  Theirs is a sad \nlot!  Ah, poor souls, if they but knew the joys of being fettered!  \nPoor souls, my heart yearns for them.  But the truth is they are \nvile, odious, insolent, ill-conditioned, stinking brutes, not truly \nhuman - for what is a man without a fetter? - and you cannot be too \nparticular not to touch or speak with them.”",
        "After this talk, the child would never pass one of the unfettered \non the road but what he spat at him and called him names, which was \nthe practice of the children in that part.",
        "It chanced one day, when he was fifteen, he went into the woods, \nand the ulcer pained him.  It was a fair day, with a blue sky; all \nthe birds were singing; but Jack nursed his foot.  Presently, \nanother song began; it sounded like the singing of a person, only \nfar more gay; at the same time there was a beating on the earth.  \nJack put aside the leaves; and there was a lad of his own village, \nleaping, and dancing and singing to himself in a green dell; and on \nthe grass beside him lay the dancer’s iron.",
        "“Oh!” cried Jack, “you have your fetter off!”",
        "“For God’s sake, don’t tell your uncle!” cried the lad.",
        "“If you fear my uncle,” returned Jack “why do you not fear the \nthunderbolt”?",
        "“That is only an old wives’ tale,” said the other.  “It is only \ntold to children.  Scores of us come here among the woods and dance \nfor nights together, and are none the worse.”",
        "This put Jack in a thousand new thoughts.  He was a grave lad; he \nhad no mind to dance himself; he wore his fetter manfully, and \ntended his ulcer without complaint.  But he loved the less to be \ndeceived or to see others cheated.  He began to lie in wait for \nheathen travellers, at covert parts of the road, and in the dusk of \nthe day, so that he might speak with them unseen; and these were \ngreatly taken with their wayside questioner, and told him things of \nweight.  The wearing of gyves (they said) was no command of \nJupiter’s.  It was the contrivance of a white-faced thing, a \nsorcerer, that dwelt in that country in the Wood of Eld.  He was \none like Glaucus that could change his shape, yet he could be \nalways told; for when he was crossed, he gobbled like a turkey.  He \nhad three lives; but the third smiting would make an end of him \nindeed; and with that his house of sorcery would vanish, the gyves \nfall, and the villagers take hands and dance like children.",
        "“And in your country?” Jack would ask.",
        "But at this the travellers, with one accord, would put him off; \nuntil Jack began to suppose there was no land entirely happy.  Or, \nif there were, it must be one that kept its folk at home; which was \nnatural enough.",
        "But the case of the gyves weighed upon him.  The sight of the \nchildren limping stuck in his eyes; the groans of such as dressed \ntheir ulcers haunted him.  And it came at last in his mind that he \nwas born to free them.",
        "There was in that village a sword of heavenly forgery, beaten upon \nVulcan’s anvil.  It was never used but in the temple, and then the \nflat of it only; and it hung on a nail by the catechist’s chimney.  \nEarly one night, Jack rose, and took the sword, and was gone out of \nthe house and the village in the darkness.",
        "All night he walked at a venture; and when day came, he met \nstrangers going to the fields.  Then he asked after the Wood of Eld \nand the house of sorcery; and one said north, and one south; until \nJack saw that they deceived him.  So then, when he asked his way of \nany man, he showed the bright sword naked; and at that the gyve on \nthe man’s ankle rang, and answered in his stead; and the word was \nstill STRAIGHT ON.  But the man, when his gyve spoke, spat and \nstruck at Jack, and threw stones at him as he went away; so that \nhis head was broken.",
        "So he came to that wood, and entered in, and he was aware of a \nhouse in a low place, where funguses grew, and the trees met, and \nthe steaming of the marsh arose about it like a smoke.  It was a \nfine house, and a very rambling; some parts of it were ancient like \nthe hills, and some but of yesterday, and none finished; and all \nthe ends of it were open, so that you could go in from every side.  \nYet it was in good repair, and all the chimneys smoked.",
        "Jack went in through the gable; and there was one room after \nanother, all bare, but all furnished in part, so that a man could \ndwell there; and in each there was a fire burning, where a man \ncould warm himself, and a table spread where he might eat.  But \nJack saw nowhere any living creature; only the bodies of some \nstuffed.",
        "“This is a hospitable house,” said Jack; “but the ground must be \nquaggy underneath, for at every step the building quakes.”",
        "He had gone some time in the house, when he began to be hungry.  \nThen he looked at the food, and at first he was afraid; but he \nbared the sword, and by the shining of the sword, it seemed the \nfood was honest.  So he took the courage to sit down and eat, and \nhe was refreshed in mind and body.",
        "“This is strange,” thought he, “that in the house of sorcery there \nshould be food so wholesome.”",
        "As he was yet eating, there came into that room the appearance of \nhis uncle, and Jack was afraid because he had taken the sword.  But \nhis uncle was never more kind, and sat down to meat with him, and \npraised him because he had taken the sword.  Never had these two \nbeen more pleasantly together, and Jack was full of love to the \nman.",
        "“It was very well done,” said his uncle, “to take the sword and \ncome yourself into the House of Eld; a good thought and a brave \ndeed.  But now you are satisfied; and we may go home to dinner arm \nin arm.”",
        "“Oh, dear, no!” said Jack.  “I am not satisfied yet.”",
        "“How!” cried his uncle.  “Are you not warmed by the fire?  Does not \nthis food sustain you?”",
        "“I see the food to be wholesome,” said Jack; “and still it is no \nproof that a man should wear a gyve on his right leg.”",
        "Now at this the appearance of his uncle gobbled like a turkey.",
        "“Jupiter!” cried Jack, “is this the sorcerer?”",
        "His hand held back and his heart failed him for the love he bore \nhis uncle; but he heaved up the sword and smote the appearance on \nthe head; and it cried out aloud with the voice of his uncle; and \nfell to the ground; and a little bloodless white thing fled from \nthe room.",
        "The cry rang in Jack’s ears, and his knees smote together, and \nconscience cried upon him; and yet he was strengthened, and there \nwoke in his bones the lust of that enchanter’s blood.  “If the \ngyves are to fall,” said he, “I must go through with this, and when \nI get home I shall find my uncle dancing.”",
        "So he went on after the bloodless thing.  In the way, he met the \nappearance of his father; and his father was incensed, and railed \nupon him, and called to him upon his duty, and bade him be home, \nwhile there was yet time.  “For you can still,” said he, “be home \nby sunset; and then all will be forgiven.”",
        "“God knows,” said Jack, “I fear your anger; but yet your anger does \nnot prove that a man should wear a gyve on his right leg.”",
        "And at that the appearance of his father gobbled like a turkey.",
        "“Ah, heaven,” cried Jack, “the sorcerer again!”",
        "The blood ran backward in his body and his joints rebelled against \nhim for the love he bore his father; but he heaved up the sword, \nand plunged it in the heart of the appearance; and the appearance \ncried out aloud with the voice of his father; and fell to the \nground; and a little bloodless white thing fled from the room.",
        "The cry rang in Jack’s ears, and his soul was darkened; but now \nrage came to him.  “I have done what I dare not think upon,” said \nhe.  “I will go to an end with it, or perish.  And when I get home, \nI pray God this may be a dream, and I may find my father dancing.”",
        "So he went on after the bloodless thing that had escaped; and in \nthe way he met the appearance of his mother, and she wept.  “What \nhave you done?” she cried.  “What is this that you have done?  Oh, \ncome home (where you may be by bedtime) ere you do more ill to me \nand mine; for it is enough to smite my brother and your father.”",
        "“Dear mother, it is not these that I have smitten,” said Jack; “it \nwas but the enchanter in their shape.  And even if I had, it would \nnot prove that a man should wear a gyve on his right leg.”",
        "And at this the appearance gobbled like a turkey.",
        "He never knew how he did that; but he swung the sword on the one \nside, and clove the appearance through the midst; and it cried out \naloud with the voice of his mother; and fell to the ground; and \nwith the fall of it, the house was gone from over Jack’s head, and \nhe stood alone in the woods, and the gyve was loosened from his \nleg.",
        "“Well,” said he, “the enchanter is now dead, and the fetter gone.”  \nBut the cries rang in his soul, and the day was like night to him.  \n“This has been a sore business,” said he.  “Let me get forth out of \nthe wood, and see the good that I have done to others.”",
        "He thought to leave the fetter where it lay, but when he turned to \ngo, his mind was otherwise.  So he stooped and put the gyve in his \nbosom; and the rough iron galled him as he went, and his bosom \nbled.",
        "Now when he was forth of the wood upon the highway, he met folk \nreturning from the field; and those he met had no fetter on the \nright leg, but, behold! they had one upon the left.  Jack asked \nthem what it signified; and they said, “that was the new wear, for \nthe old was found to be a superstition”.  Then he looked at them \nnearly; and there was a new ulcer on the left ankle, and the old \none on the right was not yet healed.",
        "“Now, may God forgive me!” cried Jack.  “I would I were well home.”",
        "And when he was home, there lay his uncle smitten on the head, and \nhis father pierced through the heart, and his mother cloven through \nthe midst.  And he sat in the lone house and wept beside the \nbodies.",
