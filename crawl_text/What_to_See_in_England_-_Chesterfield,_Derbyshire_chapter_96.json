        "Chesterfield, now the second largest town in its own county, was at the\ntime of the Doomsday survey merely a bailiwick to Newbold, which at the\npresent time has dwindled down to a small hamlet to the west of the\nparish. In the middle of the thirteenth century a battle was fought here\nbetween the Earl of Derby and Prince Henry, nephew of Henry III., in\nwhich the Earl was defeated and taken prisoner. It was also the scene of\na fierce engagement during the civil wars of Charles I., in which the\nEarl of Newcastle routed the Parliamentary forces in 1643.",
        "The great feature of interest in Chesterfield is the parish church of\nAll Saints, with its extraordinary twisted spire 230 feet in height.\nThis “crooked” spire, which leans over to the south-west, has been the\nobject of much discussion amongst antiquaries, as to whether it was\ndesigned in such a fashion, or whether the present state of affairs has\nbeen brought about by a warping of the timber frame under the outside\ncovering of lead. The latter seems the more feasible theory.",
        "There was a church at Chesterfield in the eleventh century, but the\npresent structure is mainly of the fourteenth century, with later\nadditions. In the interior there are several features of interest, among\nthem being the screen separating the transept from the chancel. This is\ncarved with a set of mysterious figures, supposed to be emblematical of\nthe crucifixion.",
        "There are many extremely fine and interesting monuments in the church,\nespecially two belonging to the Foljambe family. At the east end is a\nvery good modern stained-glass window, erected as a memorial to a former\nvicar, the late Archdeacon Hill.",
        "In the neighbourhood of Chesterfield there are a number of interesting\nplaces, notably the fine old churches at Old Brampton and Wingerworth,\nand a small disused chapel with a Norman doorway at Newbold.",

        "With its strangely-distorted spire, probably due to the unequal\nshrinking of its timbers.]",
