        "Three well-known writers, Professor Max Muller, Professor Mivart,\nand Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace have lately maintained that though the\ntheory of descent with modification accounts for the development of\nall vegetable life, and of all animals lower than man, yet that man\ncannot—not at least in respect of the whole of his nature—be held\nto have descended from any animal lower than himself, inasmuch as\nnone lower than man possesses even the germs of language.  Reason,\nit is contended—more especially by Professor Max Muller in his\n“Science of Thought,” to which I propose confining our attention\nthis evening—is so inseparably connected with language, that the\ntwo are in point of fact identical; hence it is argued that, as the\nlower animals have no germs of language, they can have no germs of\nreason, and the inference is drawn that man cannot be conceived as\nhaving derived his own reasoning powers and command of language\nthrough descent from beings in which no germ of either can be found.\nThe relations therefore between thought and language, interesting in\nthemselves, acquire additional importance from the fact of their\nhaving become the battle-ground between those who say that the\ntheory of descent breaks down with man, and those who maintain that\nwe are descended from some ape-like ancestor long since extinct.",
        "The contention of those who refuse to admit man unreservedly into\nthe scheme of evolution is comparatively recent.  The great\npropounders of evolution, Buffon, Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck—not to\nmention a score of others who wrote at the close of the last and\nearly part of this present century—had no qualms about admitting\nman into their system.  They have been followed in this respect by\nthe late Mr. Charles Darwin, and by the greatly more influential\npart of our modern biologists, who hold that whatever loss of\ndignity we may incur through being proved to be of humble origin, is\ncompensated by the credit we may claim for having advanced ourselves\nto such a high pitch of civilisation; this bids us expect still\nfurther progress, and glorifies our descendants more than it abases\nour ancestors.  But to whichever view we may incline on sentimental\ngrounds the fact remains that, while Charles Darwin declared\nlanguage to form no impassable barrier between man and the lower\nanimals, Professor Max Muller calls it the Rubicon which no brute\ndare cross, and deduces hence the conclusion that man cannot have\ndescended from an unknown but certainly speechless ape.",
        "It may perhaps be expected that I should begin a lecture on the\nrelations between thought and language with some definition of both\nthese things; but thought, as Sir William Grove said of motion, is a\nphenomenon “so obvious to simple apprehension, that to define it\nwould make it more obscure.” {17}  Definitions are useful where\nthings are new to us, but they are superfluous about those that are\nalready familiar, and mischievous, so far as they are possible at\nall, in respect of all those things that enter so profoundly and\nintimately into our being that in them we must either live or bear\nno life.  To vivisect the more vital processes of thought is to\nsuspend, if not to destroy them; for thought can think about\neverything more healthily and easily than about itself.  It is like\nits instrument the brain, which knows nothing of any injuries\ninflicted upon itself.  As regards what is new to us, a definition\nwill sometimes dilute a difficulty, and help us to swallow that\nwhich might choke us undiluted; but to define when we have once well\nswallowed is to unsettle, rather than settle, our digestion.\nDefinitions, again, are like steps cut in a steep slope of ice, or\nshells thrown on to a greasy pavement; they give us foothold, and\nenable us to advance, but when we are at our journey’s end we want\nthem no longer.  Again, they are useful as mental fluxes, and as\nhelping us to fuse new ideas with our older ones.  They present us\nwith some tags and ends of ideas that we have already mastered, on\nto which we can hitch our new ones; but to multiply them in respect\nof such a matter as thought, is like scratching the bite of a gnat;\nthe more we scratch the more we want to scratch; the more we define\nthe more we shall have to go on defining the words we have used in\nour definitions, and shall end by setting up a serious mental raw in\nthe place of a small uneasiness that was after all quite endurable.\nWe know too well what thought is, to be able to know that we know\nit, and I am persuaded there is no one in this room but understands\nwhat is meant by thought and thinking well enough for all the\npurposes of this discussion.  Whoever does not know this without\nwords will not learn it for all the words and definitions that are\nlaid before him.  The more, indeed, he hears, the more confused he\nwill become.  I shall, therefore, merely premise that I use the word\n“thought” in the same sense as that in which it is generally used by\npeople who say that they think this or that.  At any rate, it will\nbe enough if I take Professor Max Muller’s own definition, and say\nthat its essence consists in a bringing together of mental images\nand ideas with deductions therefrom, and with a corresponding power\nof detaching them from one another.  Hobbes, the Professor tells us,\nmaintained this long ago, when he said that all our thinking\nconsists of addition and subtraction—that is to say, in bringing\nideas together, and in detaching them from one another.",
        "Turning from thought to language, we observe that the word is\nderived from the French langue, or tongue.  Strictly, therefore, it\nmeans tonguage.  This, however, takes account of but a very small\npart of the ideas that underlie the word.  It does, indeed, seize a\nfamiliar and important detail of everyday speech, though it may be\ndoubted whether the tongue has more to do with speaking than lips,\nteeth and throat have, but it makes no attempt at grasping and\nexpressing the essential characteristic of speech.  Anything done\nwith the tongue, even though it involve no speaking at all, is\ntonguage; eating oranges is as much tonguage as speech is.  The\nword, therefore, though it tells us in part how speech is effected,\nreveals nothing of that ulterior meaning which is nevertheless\ninseparable from any right use of the words either “speech” or\n“language.”  It presents us with what is indeed a very frequent\nadjunct of conversation, but the use of written characters, or the\nfinger-speech of deaf mutes, is enough to show that the word\n“language” omits all reference to the most essential characteristics\nof the idea, which in practice it nevertheless very sufficiently\npresents to us.  I hope presently to make it clear to you how and\nwhy it should do so.  The word is incomplete in the first place,\nbecause it omits all reference to the ideas which words, speech or\nlanguage are intended to convey, and there can be no true word\nwithout its actually or potentially conveying an idea.  Secondly, it\nmakes no allusion to the person or persons to whom the ideas are to\nbe conveyed.  Language is not language unless it not only expresses\nfairly definite and coherent ideas, but unless it also conveys these\nideas to some other living intelligent being, either man or brute,\nthat can understand them.  We may speak to a dog or horse, but not\nto a stone.  If we make pretence of doing so we are in reality only\ntalking to ourselves.  The person or animal spoken to is half the\nbattle—a half, moreover, which is essential to there being any\nbattle at all.  It takes two people to say a thing—a sayee as well\nas a sayer.  The one is as essential to any true saying as the\nother.  A. may have spoken, but if B. has not heard, there has been\nnothing said, and he must speak again.  True, the belief on A.’s\npart that he had a bona fide sayee in B., saves his speech qua him,\nbut it has been barren and left no fertile issue.  It has failed to\nfulfil the conditions of true speech, which involve not only that A.\nshould speak, but also that B. should hear.  True, again, we often\nspeak of loose, incoherent, indefinite language; but by doing so we\nimply, and rightly, that we are calling that language which is not\ntrue language at all.  People, again, sometimes talk to themselves\nwithout intending that any other person should hear them, but this\nis not well done, and does harm to those who practise it.  It is\nabnormal, whereas our concern is with normal and essential\ncharacteristics; we may, therefore, neglect both delirious\nbabblings, and the cases in which a person is regarding him or\nherself, as it were, from outside, and treating himself as though he\nwere some one else.",
        "Inquiring, then, what are the essentials, the presence of which\nconstitutes language, while their absence negatives it altogether,\nwe find that Professor Max Muller restricts them to the use of\ngrammatical articulate words that we can write or speak, and denies\nthat anything can be called language unless it can be written or\nspoken in articulate words and sentences.  He also denies that we\ncan think at all unless we do so in words; that is to say, in\nsentences with verbs and nouns.  Indeed he goes so far as to say\nupon his title-page that there can be no reason—which I imagine\ncomes to much the same thing as thought—without language, and no\nlanguage without reason.",
        "Against the assertion that there can be no true language without\nreason I have nothing to say.  But when the Professor says that\nthere can be no reason, or thought, without language, his opponents\ncontend, as it seems to me, with greater force, that thought, though\ninfinitely aided, extended and rendered definite through the\ninvention of words, nevertheless existed so fully as to deserve no\nother name thousands, if not millions of years before words had\nentered into it at all.  Words, they say, are a comparatively recent\ninvention, for the fuller expression of something that was already\nin existence.",
        "Children, they urge, are often evidently thinking and reasoning,\nthough they can neither think nor speak in words.  If you ask me to\ndefine reason, I answer as before that this can no more be done than\nthought, truth or motion can be defined.  Who has answered the\nquestion, “What is truth?”  Man cannot see God and live.  We cannot\ngo so far back upon ourselves as to undermine our own foundations;\nif we try to do we topple over, and lose that very reason about\nwhich we vainly try to reason.  If we let the foundations be, we\nknow well enough that they are there, and we can build upon them in\nall security.  We cannot, then, define reason nor crib, cabin and\nconfine it within a thus-far-shalt-thou-go-and-no-further.  Who can\ndefine heat or cold, or night or day?  Yet, so long as we hold fast\nby current consent, our chances of error for want of better\ndefinition are so small that no sensible person will consider them.\nIn like manner, if we hold by current consent or common sense, which\nis the same thing, about reason, we shall not find the want of an\nacademic definition hinder us from a reasonable conclusion.  What\nnurse or mother will doubt that her infant child can reason within\nthe limits of its own experience, long before it can formulate its\nreason in articulately worded thought?  If the development of any\ngiven animal is, as our opponents themselves admit, an epitome of\nthe history of its whole anterior development, surely the fact that\nspeech is an accomplishment acquired after birth so artificially\nthat children who have gone wild in the woods lose it if they have\never learned it, points to the conclusion that man’s ancestors only\nlearned to express themselves in articulate language at a\ncomparatively recent period.  Granted that they learn to think and\nreason continually the more and more fully for having done so, will\ncommon sense permit us to suppose that they could neither think nor\nreason at all till they could convey their ideas in words?",
        "I will return later to the reason of the lower animals, but will now\ndeal with the question what it is that constitutes language in the\nmost comprehensive sense that can be properly attached to it.  I\nhave said already that language to be language at all must not only\nconvey fairly definite coherent ideas, but must also convey them to\nanother living being.  Whenever two living beings have conveyed and\nreceived ideas, there has been language, whether looks or gestures\nor words spoken or written have been the vehicle by means of which\nthe ideas have travelled.  Some ideas crawl, some run, some fly; and\nin this case words are the wings they fly with, but they are only\nthe wings of thought or of ideas, they are not the thought or ideas\nthemselves, nor yet, as Professor Max Muller would have it,\ninseparably connected with them.  Last summer I was at an inn in\nSicily, where there was a deaf and dumb waiter; he had been born so,\nand could neither write nor read.  What had he to do with words or\nwords with him?  Are we to say, then, that this most active, amiable\nand intelligent fellow could neither think nor reason?  One day I\nhad had my dinner and had left the hotel.  A friend came in, and the\nwaiter saw him look for me in the place I generally occupied.  He\ninstantly came up to my friend, and moved his two forefingers in a\nway that suggested two people going about together, this meant “your\nfriend\"; he then moved his forefingers horizontally across his eyes,\nthis meant, “who wears divided spectacles\"; he made two fierce marks\nover the sockets of his eyes, this meant, “with the heavy eyebrows\";\nhe pulled his chin, and then touched his white shirt, to say that my\nbeard was white.  Having thus identified me as a friend of the\nperson he was speaking to, and as having a white beard, heavy\neyebrows, and wearing divided spectacles, he made a munching\nmovement with his jaws to say that I had had my dinner; and finally,\nby making two fingers imitate walking on the table, he explained\nthat I had gone away.  My friend, however, wanted to know how long I\nhad been gone, so he pulled out his watch and looked inquiringly.\nThe man at once slapped himself on the back, and held up the five\nfingers of one hand, to say it was five minutes ago.  All this was\ndone as rapidly as though it had been said in words; and my friend,\nwho knew the man well, understood without a moment’s hesitation.\nAre we to say that this man had no thought, nor reason, nor\nlanguage, merely because he had not a single word of any kind in his\nhead, which I am assured he had not; for, as I have said, he could\nnot speak with his fingers?  Is it possible to deny that a dialogue-\n-an intelligent conversation—had passed between the two men?  And\nif conversation, then surely it is technical and pedantic to deny\nthat all the essential elements of language were present.  The signs\nand tokens used by this poor fellow were as rude an instrument of\nexpression, in comparison with ordinary language, as going on one’s\nhands and knees is in comparison with walking, or as walking\ncompared with going by train; but it is as great an abuse of words\nto limit the word “language” to mere words written or spoken, as it\nwould be to limit the idea of a locomotive to a railway engine.\nThis may indeed pass in ordinary conversation, where so much must be\nsuppressed if talk is to be got through at all, but it is\nintolerable when we are inquiring about the relations between\nthought and words.  To do so is to let words become as it were the\nmasters of thought, on the ground that the fact of their being only\nits servants and appendages is so obvious that it is generally\nallowed to go without saying.",
        "If all that Professor Max Muller means to say is, that no animal but\nman commands an articulate language, with verbs and nouns, or is\never likely to command one (and I question whether in reality he\nmeans much more than this), no one will differ from him.  No dog or\nelephant has one word for bread, another for meat, and another for\nwater.  Yet, when we watch a cat or dog dreaming, as they often\nevidently do, can we doubt that the dream is accompanied by a mental\nimage of the thing that is dreamed of, much like what we experience\nin dreams ourselves, and much doubtless like the mental images which\nmust have passed through the mind of my deaf and dumb waiter?  If\nthey have mental images in sleep, can we doubt that waking, also,\nthey picture things before their mind’s eyes, and see them much as\nwe do—too vaguely indeed to admit of our thinking that we actually\nsee the objects themselves, but definitely enough for us to be able\nto recognise the idea or object of which we are thinking, and to\nconnect it with any other idea, object, or sign that we may think\nappropriate?",
        "Here we have touched on the second essential element of language.\nWe laid it down, that its essence lay in the communication of an\nidea from one intelligent being to another; but no ideas can be\ncommunicated at all except by the aid of conventions to which both\nparties have agreed to attach an identical meaning.  The agreement\nmay be very informal, and may pass so unconsciously from one\ngeneration to another that its existence can only be recognised by\nthe aid of much introspection, but it will be always there.  A\nsayer, a sayee, and a convention, no matter what, agreed upon\nbetween them as inseparably attached to the idea which it is\nintended to convey—these comprise all the essentials of language.\nWhere these are present there is language; where any of them are\nwanting there is no language.  It is not necessary for the sayee to\nbe able to speak and become a sayer.  If he comprehends the sayer—\nthat is to say, if he attaches the same meaning to a certain symbol\nas the sayer does—if he is a party to the bargain whereby it is\nagreed upon by both that any given symbol shall be attached\ninvariably to a certain idea, so that in virtue of the principle of\nassociated ideas the symbol shall never be present without\nimmediately carrying the idea along with it, then all the essentials\nof language are complied with, and there has been true speech though\nnever a word was spoken.",
        "The lower animals, therefore, many of them, possess a part of our\nown language, though they cannot speak it, and hence do not possess\nit so fully as we do.  They cannot say “bread,” “meat,” or “water,\"\nbut there are many that readily learn what ideas they ought to\nattach to these symbols when they are presented to them.  It is idle\nto say that a cat does not know what the cat’s-meat man means when\nhe says “meat.”  The cat knows just as well, neither better nor\nworse than the cat’s-meat man does, and a great deal better than I\nmyself understand much that is said by some very clever people at\nOxford or Cambridge.  There is more true employment of language,\nmore bona fide currency of speech, between a sayer and a sayee who\nunderstand each other, though neither of them can speak a word, than\nbetween a sayer who can speak with the tongues of men and of angels\nwithout being clear about his own meaning, and a sayee who can\nhimself utter the same words, but who is only in imperfect agreement\nwith the sayer as to the ideas which the words or symbols that he\nutters are intended to convey.  The nature of the symbols counts for\nnothing; the gist of the matter is in the perfect harmony between\nsayer and sayee as to the significance that is to be associated with\nthem.",
        "Professor Max Muller admits that we share with the lower animals\nwhat he calls an emotional language, and continues that we may call\ntheir interjections and imitations language if we like, as we speak\nof the language of the eyes or the eloquence of mute nature, but he\nwarns us against mistaking metaphor for fact.  It is indeed mere\nmetaphor to talk of the eloquence of mute nature, or the language of\nwinds and waves.  There is no intercommunion of mind with mind by\nmeans of a covenanted symbol; but it is only an apparent, not a\nreal, metaphor to say that two pairs of eyes have spoken when they\nhave signalled to one another something which they both understand.\nA schoolboy at home for the holidays wants another plate of pudding,\nand does not like to apply officially for more.  He catches the\nservant’s eye and looks at the pudding; the servant understands,\ntakes his plate without a word, and gets him some.  Is it metaphor\nto say that the boy asked the servant to do this, or is it not\nrather pedantry to insist on the letter of a bond and deny its\nspirit, by denying that language passed, on the ground that the\nsymbols covenanted upon and assented to by both were uttered and\nreceived by eyes and not by mouth and ears?  When the lady drank to\nthe gentleman only with her eyes, and he pledged with his, was there\nno conversation because there was neither noun nor verb?  Eyes are\nverbs, and glasses of wine are good nouns enough as between those\nwho understand one another.  Whether the ideas underlying them are\nexpressed and conveyed by eyeage or by tonguage is a detail that\nmatters nothing.",
        "But everything we say is metaphorical if we choose to be captious.\nScratch the simplest expressions, and you will find the metaphor.\nWritten words are handage, inkage and paperage; it is only by\nmetaphor, or substitution and transposition of ideas, that we can\ncall them language.  They are indeed potential language, and the\nsymbols employed presuppose nouns, verbs, and the other parts of\nspeech; but for the most part it is in what we read between the\nlines that the profounder meaning of any letter is conveyed.  There\nare words unwritten and untranslatable into any nouns that are\nnevertheless felt as above, about and underneath the gross material\nsymbols that lie scrawled upon the paper; and the deeper the feeling\nwith which anything is written the more pregnant will it be of\nmeaning which can be conveyed securely enough, but which loses\nrather than gains if it is squeezed into a sentence, and limited by\nthe parts of speech.  The language is not in the words but in the\nheart-to-heartness of the thing, which is helped by words, but is\nnearer and farther than they.  A correspondent wrote to me once,\nmany years ago, “If I could think to you without words you would\nunderstand me better.”  But surely in this he was thinking to me,\nand without words, and I did understand him better . . .  So it is\nnot by the words that I am too presumptuously venturing to speak to-\nnight that your opinions will be formed or modified.  They will be\nformed or modified, if either, by something that you will feel, but\nwhich I have not spoken, to the full as much as by anything that I\nhave actually uttered.  You may say that this borders on mysticism.\nPerhaps it does, but their really is some mysticism in nature.",
        "To return, however, to terra firma.  I believe I am right in saying\nthat the essence of language lies in the intentional conveyance of\nideas from one living being to another through the instrumentality\nof arbitrary tokens or symbols agreed upon, and understood by both\nas being associated with the particular ideas in question.  The\nnature of the symbol chosen is a matter of indifference; it may be\nanything that appeals to human senses, and is not too hot or too\nheavy; the essence of the matter lies in a mutual covenant that\nwhatever it is it shall stand invariably for the same thing, or\nnearly so.",
        "We shall see this more easily if we observe the differences between\nwritten and spoken language.  The written word “stone,” and the\nspoken word, are each of them symbols arrived at in the first\ninstance arbitrarily.  They are neither of them more like the other\nthan they are to the idea of a stone which rises before our minds,\nwhen we either see or hear the word, or than this idea again is like\nthe actual stone itself, but nevertheless the spoken symbol and the\nwritten one each alike convey with certainty the combination of\nideas to which we have agreed to attach them.",
        "The written symbol is formed with the hand, appeals to the eye,\nleaves a material trace as long as paper and ink last, can travel as\nfar as paper and ink can travel, and can be imprinted on eye after\neye practically ad infinitum both as regards time and space.",
        "The spoken symbol is formed by means of various organs in or about\nthe mouth, appeals to the ear, not the eye, perishes instantly\nwithout material trace, and if it lives at all does so only in the\nminds of those who heard it.  The range of its action is no wider\nthan that within which a voice can be heard; and every time a fresh\nimpression is wanted the type must be set up anew.",
        "The written symbol extends infinitely, as regards time and space,\nthe range within which one mind can communicate with another; it\ngives the writer’s mind a life limited by the duration of ink,\npaper, and readers, as against that of his flesh and blood body.  On\nthe other hand, it takes longer to learn the rules so as to be able\nto apply them with ease and security, and even then they cannot be\napplied so quickly and easily as those attaching to spoken symbols.\nMoreover, the spoken symbol admits of a hundred quick and subtle\nadjuncts by way of action, tone and expression, so that no one will\nuse written symbols unless either for the special advantages of\npermanence and travelling power, or because he is incapacitated from\nusing spoken ones.  This, however, is hardly to the point; the point\nis that these two conventional combinations of symbols, that are as\nunlike one another as the Hallelujah Chorus is to St. Paul’s\nCathedral, are the one as much language as the other; and we\ntherefore inquire what this very patent fact reveals to us about the\nmore essential characteristics of language itself.  What is the\ncommon bond that unites these two classes of symbols that seem at\nfirst sight to have nothing in common, and makes the one raise the\nidea of language in our minds as readily as the other?  The bond\nlies in the fact that both are a set of conventional tokens or\nsymbols, agreed upon between the parties to whom they appeal as\nbeing attached invariably to the same ideas, and because they are\nbeing made as a means of communion between one mind and another,—\nfor a memorandum made for a person’s own later use is nothing but a\ncommunication from an earlier mind to a later and modified one; it\nis therefore in reality a communication from one mind to another as\nmuch as though it had been addressed to another person.",
        "We see, therefore, that the nature of the outward and visible sign\nto which the inward and spiritual idea of language is attached does\nnot matter.  It may be the firing of a gun; it may be an old\nsemaphore telegraph; it may be the movements of a needle; a look, a\ngesture, the breaking of a twig by an Indian to tell some one that\nhe has passed that way:  a twig broken designedly with this end in\nview is a letter addressed to whomsoever it may concern, as much as\nthough it had been written out in full on bark or paper.  It does\nnot matter one straw what it is, provided it is agreed upon in\nconcert, and stuck to.  Just as the lowest forms of life\nnevertheless present us with all the essential characteristics of\nlivingness, and are as much alive in their own humble way as the\nmost highly developed organisms, so the rudest intentional and\neffectual communication between two minds through the\ninstrumentality of a concerted symbol is as much language as the\nmost finished oratory of Mr. Gladstone.  I demur therefore to the\nassertion that the lower animals have no language, inasmuch as they\ncannot themselves articulate a grammatical sentence.  I do not\nindeed pretend that when the cat calls upon the tiles it uses what\nit consciously and introspectively recognises as language; it says\nwhat it has to say without introspection, and in the ordinary course\nof business, as one of the common forms of courtship.  It no more\nknows that it has been using language than M. Jourdain knew he had\nbeen speaking prose, but M. Jourdain’s knowing or not knowing was\nneither here nor there.",
        "Anything which can be made to hitch on invariably to a definite idea\nthat can carry some distance—say an inch at the least, and which\ncan be repeated at pleasure, can be pressed into the service of\nlanguage.  Mrs. Bentley, wife of the famous Dr. Bentley of Trinity\nCollege, Cambridge, used to send her snuff-box to the college\nbuttery when she wanted beer, instead of a written order.  If the\nsnuff-box came the beer was sent, but if there was no snuff-box\nthere was no beer.  Wherein did the snuff-box differ more from a\nwritten order, than a written order differs from a spoken one?  The\nsnuff-box was for the time being language.  It sounds strange to say\nthat one might take a pinch of snuff out of a sentence, but if the\nservant had helped him or herself to a pinch while carrying it to\nthe buttery this is what would have been done; for if a snuff-box\ncan say “Send me a quart of beer,” so efficiently that the beer is\nsent, it is impossible to say that it is not a bona fide sentence.\nAs for the recipient of the message, the butler did not probably\ntranslate the snuff-box into articulate nouns and verbs; as soon as\nhe saw it he just went down into the cellar and drew the beer, and\nif he thought at all, it was probably about something else.  Yet he\nmust have been thinking without words, or he would have drawn too\nmuch beer or too little, or have spilt it in the bringing it up, and\nwe may be sure that he did none of these things.",
        "You will, of course, observe that if Mrs. Bentley had sent the\nsnuff-box to the buttery of St. John’s College instead of Trinity,\nit would not have been language, for there would have been no\ncovenant between sayer and sayee as to what the symbol should\nrepresent, there would have been no previously established\nassociation of ideas in the mind of the butler of St. John’s between\nbeer and snuff-box; the connection was artificial, arbitrary, and by\nno means one of those in respect of which an impromptu bargain might\nbe proposed by the very symbol itself, and assented to without\nprevious formality by the person to whom it was presented.  More\nbriefly, the butler of St. John’s would not have been able to\nunderstand and read it aright.  It would have been a dead letter to\nhim—a snuff-box and not a letter; whereas to the butler of Trinity\nit was a letter and not a snuff-box.",
        "You will also note that it was only at the moment when he was\nlooking at it and accepting it as a message that it flashed forth\nfrom snuff-box-hood into the light and life of living utterance.  As\nsoon as it had kindled the butler into sending a single quart of\nbeer, its force was spent until Mrs. Bentley threw her soul into it\nagain and charged it anew by wanting more beer, and sending it down\naccordingly.",
        "Again, take the ring which the Earl of Essex sent to Queen\nElizabeth, but which the queen did not receive.  This was intended\nas a sentence, but failed to become effectual language because the\nsensible material symbol never reached those sentient organs which\nit was intended to affect.  A book, again, however full of excellent\nwords it may be, is not language when it is merely standing on a\nbookshelf.  It speaks to no one, unless when being actually read, or\nquoted from by an act of memory.  It is potential language as a\nlucifer-match is potential fire, but it is no more language till it\nis in contact with a recipient mind, than a match is fire till it is\nstruck, and is being consumed.",
        "A piece of music, again, without any words at all, or a song with\nwords that have nothing in the world to do with the ideas which it\nis nevertheless made to convey, is often very effectual language.\nMuch lying, and all irony depends on tampering with covenanted\nsymbols, and making those that are usually associated with one set\nof ideas convey by a sleight of mind others of a different nature.\nThat is why irony is intolerably fatiguing unless very sparingly\nused.  Take the song which Blondel sang under the window of King\nRichard’s prison.  There was not one syllable in it to say that\nBlondel was there, and was going to help the king to get out of\nprison.  It was about some silly love affair, but it was a letter\nall the same, and the king made language of what would otherwise\nhave been no language, by guessing the meaning, that is to say by\nperceiving that he was expected to enter then and there into a new\ncovenant as to the meaning of the symbols that were presented to\nhim, understanding what this covenant was to be, and acquiescing in\nit.",
        "On the other hand, no ingenuity can torture language into being a\nfit word to use in connection with either sounds or any other\nsymbols that have not been intended to convey a meaning, or again in\nconnection with either sounds or symbols in respect of which there\nhas been no covenant between sayer and sayee.  When we hear people\nspeaking a foreign language—we will say Welsh—we feel that though\nthey are no doubt using what is very good language as between\nthemselves, there is no language whatever as far as we are\nconcerned.  We call it lingo, not language.  The Chinese letters on\na tea-chest might as well not be there, for all that they say to us,\nthough the Chinese find them very much to the purpose.  They are a\ncovenant to which we have been no parties—to which our intelligence\nhas affixed no signature.",
        "We have already seen that it is in virtue of such an understood\ncovenant that symbols so unlike one another as the written word\n“stone” and the spoken word alike at once raise the idea of a stone\nin our minds.  See how the same holds good as regards the different\nlanguages that pass current in different nations.  The letters p, i,\ne, r, r, e convey the idea of a stone to a Frenchman as readily as\ns, t, o, n, e do to ourselves.  And why? because that is the\ncovenant that has been struck between those who speak and those who\nare spoken to.  Our “stone” conveys no idea to a Frenchman, nor his\n“pierre” to us, unless we have done what is commonly called\nacquiring one another’s language.  To acquire a foreign language is\nonly to learn and adhere to the covenants in respect of symbols\nwhich the nation in question has adopted and adheres to.",
        "Till we have done this we neither of us know the rules, so to speak,\nof the game that the other is playing, and cannot, therefore, play\ntogether; but the convention being once known and assented to, it\ndoes not matter whether we raise the idea of a stone by the word\n“lapis,” or by “lithos,” “pietra,” “pierre,” “stein,” “stane” or\n“stone\"; we may choose what symbols written or spoken we choose, and\none set, unless they are of unwieldy length will do as well as\nanother, if we can get other people to choose the same and stick to\nthem; it is the accepting and sticking to them that matters, not the\nsymbols.  The whole power of spoken language is vested in the\ninvariableness with which certain symbols are associated with\ncertain ideas.  If we are strict in always connecting the same\nsymbols with the same ideas, we speak well, keep our meaning clear\nto ourselves, and convey it readily and accurately to any one who is\nalso fairly strict.  If, on the other hand, we use the same\ncombination of symbols for one thing one day and for another the\nnext, we abuse our symbols instead of using them, and those who\nindulge in slovenly habits in this respect ere long lose the power\nalike of thinking and of expressing themselves correctly.  The\nsymbols, however, in the first instance, may be anything in the wide\nworld that we have a fancy for.  They have no more to do with the\nideas they serve to convey than money has with the things that it\nserves to buy.",
        "The principle of association, as every one knows, involves that\nwhenever two things have been associated sufficiently together, the\nsuggestion of one of them to the mind shall immediately raise a\nsuggestion of the other.  It is in virtue of this principle that\nlanguage, as we so call it, exists at all, for the essence of\nlanguage consists, as I have said perhaps already too often, in the\nfixity with which certain ideas are invariably connected with\ncertain symbols.  But this being so, it is hard to see how we can\ndeny that the lower animals possess the germs of a highly rude and\nunspecialised, but still true language, unless we also deny that\nthey have any ideas at all; and this I gather is what Professor Max\nMuller in a quiet way rather wishes to do.  Thus he says, “It is\neasy enough to show that animals communicate, but this is a fact\nwhich has never been doubted.  Dogs who growl and bark leave no\ndoubt in the minds of other dogs or cats, or even of man, of what\nthey mean, but growling and barking are not language, nor do they\neven contain the elements of language.” {18}",
        "I observe the Professor says that animals communicate without saying\nwhat it is that they communicate.  I believe this to have been\nbecause if he said that the lower animals communicate their ideas,\nthis would be to admit that they have ideas; if so, and if, as they\npresent every appearance of doing, they can remember, reflect upon,\nmodify these ideas according to modified surroundings, and\ninterchange them with one another, how is it possible to deny them\nthe germs of thought, language, and reason—not to say a good deal\nmore than the germs?  It seems to me that not knowing what else to\nsay that animals communicated if it was not ideas, and not knowing\nwhat mess he might not get into if he admitted that they had ideas\nat all, he thought it safer to omit his accusative case altogether.",
        "That growling and barking cannot be called a very highly specialised\nlanguage goes without saying; they are, however, so much diversified\nin character, according to circumstances, that they place a\nconsiderable number of symbols at an animal’s command, and he\ninvariably attaches the same symbol to the same idea.  A cat never\npurrs when she is angry, nor spits when she is pleased.  When she\nrubs her head against any one affectionately it is her symbol for\nsaying that she is very fond of him, and she expects, and usually\nfinds that it will be understood.  If she sees her mistress raise\nher hand as though to pretend to strike her, she knows that it is\nthe symbol her mistress invariably attaches to the idea of sending\nher away, and as such she accepts it.  Granted that the symbols in\nuse among the lower animals are fewer and less highly differentiated\nthan in the case of any known human language, and therefore that\nanimal language is incomparably less subtle and less capable of\nexpressing delicate shades of meaning than our own, these\ndifferences are nevertheless only those that exist between highly\ndeveloped and inchoate language; they do not involve those that\ndistinguish language from no language.  They are the differences\nbetween the undifferentiated protoplasm of the amoeba and our own\ncomplex organisation; they are not the differences between life and\nno life.  In animal language as much as in human there is a mind\nintentionally making use of a symbol accepted by another mind as\ninvariably attached to a certain idea, in order to produce that idea\nin the mind which it is desired to affect—more briefly, there is a\nsayer, a sayee, and a covenanted symbol designedly applied.  Our own\nspeech is vertebrated and articulated by means of nouns, verbs, and\nthe rules of grammar.  A dog’s speech is invertebrate, but I do not\nsee how it is possible to deny that it possesses all the essential\nelements of language.",
        "I have said nothing about Professor R. L. Garner’s researches into\nthe language of apes, because they have not yet been so far verified\nand accepted as to make it safe to rely upon them; but when he lays\nit down that all voluntary sounds are the products of thought, and\nthat, if they convey a meaning to another, they perform the\nfunctions of human speech, he says what I believe will commend\nitself to any unsophisticated mind.  I could have wished, however,\nthat he had not limited himself to sounds, and should have preferred\nhis saying what I doubt not he would readily accept—I mean, that\nall symbols or tokens of whatever kind, if voluntarily adopted as\nsuch, are the products of thought, and perform the functions of\nhuman speech; but I cannot too often remind you that nothing can be\nconsidered as fulfilling the conditions of language, except a\nvoluntary application of a recognised token in order to convey a\nmore or less definite meaning, with the intention doubtless of thus\npurchasing as it were some other desired meaning and consequent\nsensation.  It is astonishing how closely in this respect money and\nwords resemble one another.  Money indeed may be considered as the\nmost universal and expressive of all languages.  For gold and silver\ncoins are no more money when not in the actual process of being\nvoluntarily used in purchase, than words not so in use are language.\nPounds, shillings and pence are recognised covenanted tokens, the\noutward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual purchasing\npower, but till in actual use they are only potential money, as the\nsymbols of language, whatever they may be, are only potential\nlanguage till they are passing between two minds.  It is the power\nand will to apply the symbols that alone gives life to money, and as\nlong as these are in abeyance the money is in abeyance also; the\ncoins may be safe in one’s pocket, but they are as dead as a log\ntill they begin to burn in it, and so are our words till they begin\nto burn within us.",
        "The real question, however, as to the substantial underlying\nidentity between the language of the lower animals and our own,\nturns upon that other question whether or no, in spite of an\nimmeasurable difference of degree, the thought and reason of man and\nof the lower animals is essentially the same.  No one will expect a\ndog to master and express the varied ideas that are incessantly\narising in connection with human affairs.  He is a pauper as against\na millionaire.  To ask him to do so would be like giving a street-\nboy sixpence and telling him to go and buy himself a founder’s share\nin the New River Company.  He would not even know what was meant,\nand even if he did it would take several millions of sixpences to\nbuy one.  It is astonishing what a clever workman will do with very\nmodest tools, or again how far a thrifty housewife will make a very\nsmall sum of money go, or again in like manner how many ideas an\nintelligent brute can receive and convey with its very limited\nvocabulary; but no one will pretend that a dog’s intelligence can\never reach the level of a man’s.  What we do maintain is that,\nwithin its own limited range, it is of the same essential character\nas our own, and that though a dog’s ideas in respect of human\naffairs are both vague and narrow, yet in respect of canine affairs\nthey are precise enough and extensive enough to deserve no other\nname than thought or reason.  We hold moreover that they communicate\ntheir ideas in essentially the same manner as we do—that is to say,\nby the instrumentality of a code of symbols attached to certain\nstates of mind and material objects, in the first instance\narbitrarily, but so persistently, that the presentation of the\nsymbol immediately carries with it the idea which it is intended to\nconvey.  Animals can thus receive and impart ideas on all that most\nconcerns them.  As my great namesake said some two hundred years\nago, they know “what’s what, and that’s as high as metaphysic wit\ncan fly.”  And they not only know what’s what themselves, but can\nimpart to one another any new what’s-whatness that they may have\nacquired, for they are notoriously able to instruct and correct one\nanother.",
        "Against this Professor Max Muller contends that we can know nothing\nof what goes on in the mind of any lower animal, inasmuch as we are\nnot lower animals ourselves.  “We can imagine anything we like about\nwhat passes in the mind of an animal,” he writes, “we can know\nabsolutely nothing.” {19}  It is something to have it in evidence\nthat he conceives animals as having a mind at all, but it is not\neasy to see how they can be supposed to have a mind, without being\nable to acquire ideas, and having acquired, to read, mark, learn,\nand inwardly digest them.  Surely the mistake of requiring too much\nevidence is hardly less great than that of being contented with too\nlittle.  We, too, are animals, and can no more refuse to infer\nreason from certain visible actions in their case than we can in our\nown.  If Professor Max Muller’s plea were allowed, we should have to\ndeny our right to infer confidently what passes in the mind of any\none not ourselves, inasmuch as we are not that person.  We never,\nindeed, can obtain irrefragable certainty about this or any other\nmatter, but we can be sure enough in many cases to warrant our\nstaking all that is most precious to us on the soundness of our\nopinion.  Moreover, if the Professor denies our right to infer that\nanimals reason, on the ground that we are not animals enough\nourselves to be able to form an opinion, with what right does he\ninfer so confidently himself that they do not reason?  And how, if\nthey present every one of those appearances which we are accustomed\nto connect with the communication of an idea from one mind to\nanother, can we deny that they have a language of their own, though\nit is one which in most cases we can neither speak nor understand?\nHow can we say that a sentinel rook, when it sees a man with a gun\nand warns the other rooks by a concerted note which they all show\nthat they understand by immediately taking flight, should not be\ncredited both with reason and the germs of language?",
        "After all, a professor, whether of philology, psychology, biology,\nor any other ology, is hardly the kind of person to whom we should\nappeal on such an elementary question as that of animal intelligence\nand language.  We might as well ask a botanist to tell us whether\ngrass grows, or a meteorologist to tell us if it has left off\nraining.  If it is necessary to appeal to any one, I should prefer\nthe opinion of an intelligent gamekeeper to that of any professor,\nhowever learned.  The keepers, again, at the Zoological Gardens,\nhave exceptional opportunities for studying the minds of animals—\nmodified, indeed, by captivity, but still minds of animals.  Grooms,\nagain, and dog-fanciers, are to the full as able to form an\nintelligent opinion on the reason and language of animals as any\nUniversity Professor, and so are cats’-meat men.  I have repeatedly\nasked gamekeepers and keepers at the Zoological Gardens whether\nanimals could reason and converse with one another, and have always\nfound myself regarded somewhat contemptuously for having even asked\nthe question.  I once said to a friend, in the hearing of a keeper\nat the Zoological Gardens, that the penguin was very stupid.  The\nman was furious, and jumped upon me at once.  “He’s not stupid at\nall,” said he; “he’s very intelligent.”",
        "Who has not seen a cat, when it wishes to go out, raise its fore\npaws on to the handle of the door, or as near as it can get, and\nlook round, evidently asking some one to turn it for her?  Is it\nreasonable to deny that a reasoning process is going on in the cat’s\nmind, whereby she connects her wish with the steps necessary for its\nfulfilment, and also with certain invariable symbols which she knows\nher master or mistress will interpret?  Once, in company with a\nfriend, I watched a cat playing with a house-fly in the window of a\nground-floor room.  We were in the street, while the cat was inside.\nWhen we came up to the window she gave us one searching look, and,\nhaving satisfied herself that we had nothing for her, went on with\nher game.  She knew all about the glass in the window, and was sure\nwe could do nothing to molest her, so she treated us with absolute\ncontempt, never even looking at us again.",
        "The game was this.  She was to catch the fly and roll it round and\nround under her paw along the window-sill, but so gently as not to\ninjure it nor prevent it from being able to fly again when she had\ndone rolling it.  It was very early spring, and flies were scarce,\nin fact there was not another in the whole window.  She knew that if\nshe crippled this one, it would not be able to amuse her further,\nand that she would not readily get another instead, and she liked\nthe feel of it under her paw.  It was soft and living, and the\nquivering of its wings tickled the ball of her foot in a manner that\nshe found particularly grateful; so she rolled it gently along the\nwhole length of the window-sill.  It then became the fly’s turn.  He\nwas to get up and fly about in the window, so as to recover himself\na little; then she was to catch him again, and roll him softly all\nalong the window-sill, as she had done before.",
        "It was plain that the cat knew the rules of her game perfectly well,\nand enjoyed it keenly.  It was equally plain that the fly could not\nmake head or tail of what it was all about.  If it had been able to\ndo so it would have gone to play in the upper part of the window,\nwhere the cat could not reach it.  Perhaps it was always hoping to\nget through the glass, and escape that way; anyhow, it kept pretty\nmuch to the same pane, no matter how often it was rolled.  At last,\nhowever, the fly, for some reason or another, did not reappear on\nthe pane, and the cat began looking everywhere to find it.  Her\nannoyance when she failed to do so was extreme.  It was not only\nthat she had lost her fly, but that she could not conceive how she\nshould have ever come to do so.  Presently she noted a small knot in\nthe woodwork of the sill, and it flashed upon her that she had\naccidentally killed the fly, and that this was its dead body.  She\ntried to move it gently with her paw, but it was no use, and for the\ntime she satisfied herself that the knot and the fly had nothing to\ndo with one another.  Every now and then, however, she returned to\nit as though it were the only thing she could think of, and she\nwould try it again.  She seemed to say she was certain there had\nbeen no knot there before—she must have seen it if there had been;\nand yet, the fly could hardly have got jammed so firmly into the\nwood.  She was puzzled and irritated beyond measure, and kept\nlooking in the same place again and again, just as we do when we\nhave mislaid something.  She was rapidly losing temper and dignity\nwhen suddenly we saw the fly reappear from under the cat’s stomach\nand make for the window-pane, at the very moment when the cat\nherself was exclaiming for the fiftieth time that she wondered where\nthat stupid fly ever could have got to.  No man who has been hunting\ntwenty minutes for his spectacles could be more delighted when he\nsuddenly finds them on his own forehead.  “So that’s where you\nwere,” we seemed to hear her say, as she proceeded to catch it, and\nagain began rolling it very softly without hurting it, under her\npaw.  My friend and I both noticed that the cat, in spite of her\nperplexity, never so much as hinted that we were the culprits.  The\nquestion whether anything outside the window could do her good or\nharm had long since been settled by her in the negative, and she was\nnot going to reopen it; she simply cut us dead, and though her\nannoyance was so great that she was manifestly ready to lay the\nblame on anybody or anything with or without reason, and though she\nmust have perfectly well known that we were watching the whole\naffair with amusement, she never either asked us if we had happened\nto see such a thing as a fly go down our way lately, or accused us\nof having taken it from her—both of which ideas she would, I am\nconfident, have been very well able to convey to us if she had been\nso minded.",
        "Now what are thought and reason if the processes that were going\nthrough this cat’s mind were not both one and the other?  It would\nbe childish to suppose that the cat thought in words of its own, or\nin anything like words.  Its thinking was probably conducted through\nthe instrumentality of a series of mental images.  We so habitually\nthink in words ourselves that we find it difficult to realise\nthought without words at all; our difficulty, however, in imagining\nthe particular manner in which the cat thinks has nothing to do with\nthe matter.  We must answer the question whether she thinks or no,\nnot according to our own ease or difficulty in understanding the\nparticular manner of her thinking, but according as her action does\nor does not appear to be of the same character as other action that\nwe commonly call thoughtful.  To say that the cat is not\nintelligent, merely on the ground that we cannot ourselves fathom\nher intelligence—this, as I have elsewhere said, is to make\nintelligence mean the power of being understood, rather than the\npower of understanding.  This nevertheless is what, for all our\nboasted intelligence, we generally do.  The more we can understand\nan animal’s ways, the more intelligent we call it, and the less we\ncan understand these, the more stupid do we declare it to be.  As\nfor plants—whose punctuality and attention to all the details and\nroutine of their somewhat restricted lines of business is as obvious\nas it is beyond all praise—we understand the working of their minds\nso little that by common consent we declare them to have no\nintelligence at all.",
        "Before concluding I should wish to deal a little more fully with\nProfessor Max Muller’s contention that there can be no reason\nwithout language, and no language without reason.  Surely when two\npractised pugilists are fighting, parrying each other’s blows, and\nwatching keenly for an unguarded point, they are thinking and\nreasoning very subtly the whole time, without doing so in words.\nThe machination of their thoughts, as well as its expression, is\nactual—I mean, effectuated and expressed by action and deed, not\nwords.  They are unaware of any logical sequence of thought that\nthey could follow in words as passing through their minds at all.\nThey may perhaps think consciously in words now and again, but such\nthought will be intermittent, and the main part of the fighting will\nbe done without any internal concomitance of articulated phrases.\nYet we cannot doubt that their action, however much we may\ndisapprove of it, is guided by intelligence and reason; nor should\nwe doubt that a reasoning process of the same character goes on in\nthe minds of two dogs or fighting-cocks when they are striving to\nmaster their opponents.",
        "Do we think in words, again, when we wind up our watches, put on our\nclothes, or eat our breakfasts?  If we do, it is generally about\nsomething else.  We do these things almost as much without the help\nof words as we wink or yawn, or perform any of those other actions\nthat we call reflex, as it would almost seem because they are done\nwithout reflection.  They are not, however, the less reasonable\nbecause wordless.",
        "Even when we think we are thinking in words, we do so only in half\nmeasure.  A running accompaniment of words no doubt frequently\nattends our thoughts; but, unless we are writing or speaking, this\naccompaniment is of the vaguest and most fitful kind, as we often\nfind out when we try to write down or say what we are thinking\nabout, though we have a fairly definite notion of it, or fancy that\nwe have one, all the time.  The thought is not steadily and\ncoherently governed by and moulded in words, nor does it steadily\ngovern them.  Words and thought interact upon and help one another,\nas any other mechanical appliances interact on and help the\ninvention that first hit upon them; but reason or thought, for the\nmost part, flies along over the heads of words, working its own\nmysterious way in paths that are beyond our ken, though whether some\nof our departmental personalities are as unconscious of what is\npassing, as that central government is which we alone dub with the\nname of “we” or “us,” is a point on which I will not now touch.",
        "I cannot think, then, that Professor Max Muller’s contention that\nthought and language are identical—and he has repeatedly affirmed\nthis—will ever be generally accepted.  Thought is no more identical\nwith language than feeling is identical with the nervous system.\nTrue, we can no more feel without a nervous system than we can\ndiscern certain minute organisms without a microscope.  Destroy the\nnervous system, and we destroy feeling.  Destroy the microscope, and\nwe can no longer see the animalcules; but our sight of the\nanimalcules is not the microscope, though it is effectuated by means\nof the microscope, and our feeling is not the nervous system, though\nthe nervous system is the instrument that enables us to feel.",
        "The nervous system is a device which living beings have gradually\nperfected—I believe I may say quite truly—through the will and\npower which they have derived from a fountain-head, the existence of\nwhich we can infer, but which we can never apprehend.  By the help\nof this device, and in proportion as they have perfected it, living\nbeings feel ever with greater definiteness, and hence formulate\ntheir feelings in thought with more and more precision.  The higher\nevolution of thought has reacted on the nervous system, and the\nconsequent higher evolution of the nervous system has again reacted\nupon thought.  These things are as power and desire, or supply and\ndemand, each one of which is continually outstripping, and being in\nturn outstripped by the other; but, in spite of their close\nconnection and interaction, power is not desire, nor demand supply.\nLanguage is a device evolved sometimes by leaps and bounds, and\nsometimes exceedingly slowly, whereby we help ourselves alike to\ngreater ease, precision, and complexity of thought, and also to more\nconvenient interchange of thought among ourselves.  Thought found\nrude expression, which gradually among other forms assumed that of\nwords.  These reacted upon thought, and thought again on them, but\nthought is no more identical with words than words are with the\nseparate letters of which they are composed.",
        "To sum up, then, and to conclude.  I would ask you to see the\nconnection between words and ideas, as in the first instance\narbitrary.  No doubt in some cases an imitation of the cry of some\nbird or wild beast would suggest the name that should be attached to\nit; occasionally the sound of an operation such as grinding may have\ninfluenced the choice of the letters g, r, as the root of many words\nthat denote a grinding, grating, grasping, crushing, action; but I\nunderstand that the number of words due to direct imitation is\ncomparatively few in number, and that they have been mainly coined\nas the result of connections so far-fetched and fanciful as to\namount practically to no connection at all.  Once chosen, however,\nthey were adhered to for a considerable time among the dwellers in\nany given place, so as to become acknowledged as the vulgar tongue,\nand raise readily in the mind of the inhabitants of that place the\nideas with which they had been artificially associated.",
        "As regards our being able to think and reason without words, the\nDuke of Argyll has put the matter as soundly as I have yet seen it\nstated.  “It seems to me,” he wrote, “quite certain that we can and\ndo constantly think of things without thinking of any sound or word\nas designating them.  Language seems to me to be necessary for the\nprogress of thought, but not at all for the mere act of thinking.\nIt is a product of thought, an expression of it, a vehicle for the\ncommunication of it, and an embodiment which is essential to its\ngrowth and continuity; but it seems to me altogether erroneous to\nregard it as an inseparable part of cogitation.”",
        "The following passages, again, are quoted from Sir William Hamilton\nin Professor Max Muller’s own book, with so much approval as to lead\none to suppose that the differences between himself and his\nopponents are in reality less than he believes them to be:-",
        "“Language,” says Sir W. Hamilton, “is the attribution of signs to\nour cognitions of things.  But as a cognition must have already been\nthere before it could receive a sign, consequently that knowledge\nwhich is denoted by the formation and application of a word must\nhave preceded the symbol that denotes it.  A sign, however, is\nnecessary to give stability to our intellectual progress—to\nestablish each step in our advance as a new starting-point for our\nadvance to another beyond.  A country may be overrun by an armed\nhost, but it is only conquered by the establishment of fortresses.\nWords are the fortresses of thought.  They enable us to realise our\ndominion over what we have already overrun in thought; to make every\nintellectual conquest the base of operations for others still\nbeyond.”",
        "“This,” says Professor Max Muller, “is a most happy illustration,\"\nand he proceeds to quote the following, also from Sir William\nHamilton, which he declares to be even happier still.",
        "“You have all heard,” says Sir William Hamilton, “of the process of\ntunnelling through a sandbank.  In this operation it is impossible\nto succeed unless every foot, nay, almost every inch of our progress\nbe secured by an arch of masonry before we attempt the excavation of\nanother.  Now language is to the mind precisely what the arch is to\nthe tunnel.  The power of thinking and the power of excavation are\nnot dependent on the words in the one case or on the mason-work in\nthe other; but without these subsidiaries neither could be carried\non beyond its rudimentary commencement.  Though, therefore, we allow\nthat every movement forward in language must be determined by an\nantecedent movement forward in thought, still, unless thought be\naccompanied at each point of its evolutions by a corresponding\nevolution of language, its further development is arrested.”",
        "Man has evolved an articulate language, whereas the lower animals\nseem to be without one.  Man, therefore, has far outstripped them in\nreasoning faculty as well as in power of expression.  This, however,\ndoes not bar the communications which the lower animals make to one\nanother from possessing all the essential characteristics of\nlanguage, and as a matter of fact, wherever we can follow them we\nfind such communications effectuated by the aid of arbitrary symbols\ncovenanted upon by the living beings that wish to communicate, and\npersistently associated with certain corresponding feelings, states\nof mind, or material objects.  Human language is nothing more than\nthis in principle, however much further the principle has been\ncarried in our own case than in that of the lower animals.",
        "This being admitted, we should infer that the thought or reason on\nwhich the language of men and animals is alike founded differs as\nbetween men and brutes in degree but not in kind.  More than this\ncannot be claimed on behalf of the lower animals, even by their most\nenthusiastic admirer.",
