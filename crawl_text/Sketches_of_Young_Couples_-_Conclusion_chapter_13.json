        "We have taken for the subjects of the foregoing moral essays,\ntwelve samples of married couples, carefully selected from a large\nstock on hand, open to the inspection of all comers.  These samples\nare intended for the benefit of the rising generation of both\nsexes, and, for their more easy and pleasant information, have been\nseparately ticketed and labelled in the manner they have seen.",
        "We have purposely excluded from consideration the couple in which\nthe lady reigns paramount and supreme, holding such cases to be of\na very unnatural kind, and like hideous births and other monstrous\ndeformities, only to be discreetly and sparingly exhibited.",
        "And here our self-imposed task would have ended, but that to those\nyoung ladies and gentlemen who are yet revolving singly round the\nchurch, awaiting the advent of that time when the mysterious laws\nof attraction shall draw them towards it in couples, we are\ndesirous of addressing a few last words.",
        "Before marriage and afterwards, let them learn to centre all their\nhopes of real and lasting happiness in their own fireside; let them\ncherish the faith that in home, and all the English virtues which\nthe love of home engenders, lies the only true source of domestic\nfelicity; let them believe that round the household gods,\ncontentment and tranquillity cluster in their gentlest and most\ngraceful forms; and that many weary hunters of happiness through\nthe noisy world, have learnt this truth too late, and found a\ncheerful spirit and a quiet mind only at home at last.",
        "How much may depend on the education of daughters and the conduct\nof mothers; how much of the brightest part of our old national\ncharacter may be perpetuated by their wisdom or frittered away by\ntheir folly - how much of it may have been lost already, and how\nmuch more in danger of vanishing every day - are questions too\nweighty for discussion here, but well deserving a little serious\nconsideration from all young couples nevertheless.",
        "To that one young couple on whose bright destiny the thoughts of\nnations are fixed, may the youth of England look, and not in vain,\nfor an example.  From that one young couple, blessed and favoured\nas they are, may they learn that even the glare and glitter of a\ncourt, the splendour of a palace, and the pomp and glory of a\nthrone, yield in their power of conferring happiness, to domestic\nworth and virtue.  From that one young couple may they learn that\nthe crown of a great empire, costly and jewelled though it be,\ngives place in the estimation of a Queen to the plain gold ring\nthat links her woman’s nature to that of tens of thousands of her\nhumble subjects, and guards in her woman’s heart one secret store\nof tenderness, whose proudest boast shall be that it knows no\nRoyalty save Nature’s own, and no pride of birth but being the\nchild of heaven!",
        "So shall the highest young couple in the land for once hear the\ntruth, when men throw up their caps, and cry with loving shouts -",
        "God bless them.",
