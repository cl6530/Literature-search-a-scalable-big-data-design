        "To the student of feminine psychology there is no more curious and\ncomplex problem than the one that meets us in the life of the\ngifted French writer best known to the world as George Sand.",
        "To analyze this woman simply as a writer would in itself be a\nlong, difficult task. She wrote voluminously, with a fluid rather\nthan a fluent pen. She scandalized her contemporaries by her\ntheories, and by the way in which she applied them in her novels.\nHer fiction made her, in the history of French literature, second\nonly to Victor Hugo. She might even challenge Hugo, because where\nhe depicts strange and monstrous figures, exaggerated beyond the\nlimits of actual life, George Sand portrays living men and women,\nwhose instincts and desires she understands, and whom she makes us\nsee precisely as if we were admitted to their intimacy.",
        "But George Sand puzzles us most by peculiarities which it is\ndifficult for us to reconcile. She seemed to have no sense of\nchastity whatever; yet, on the other hand, she was not grossly\nsensual. She possessed the maternal instinct to a high degree, and\nliked better to be a mother than a mistress to the men whose love\nshe sought. For she did seek men’s love, frankly and shamelessly,\nonly to tire of it. In many cases she seems to have been swayed by\nvanity, and by a love of conquest, rather than by passion. She had\nalso a spiritual, imaginative side to her nature, and she could be\na far better comrade than anything more intimate.",
        "The name given to this strange genius at birth was Amantine Lucile\nAurore Dupin. The circumstances of her ancestry and birth were\nquite unusual. Her father was a lieutenant in the French army. His\ngrandmother had been the natural daughter of Marshal Saxe, who was\nhimself the illegitimate son of Augustus the Strong of Poland and\nof the bewitching Countess of Konigsmarck. This was a curious\npedigree. It meant strength of character, eroticism, stubbornness,\nimagination, courage, and recklessness.",
        "Her father complicated the matter by marrying suddenly a Parisian\nof the lower classes, a bird-fancier named Sophie Delaborde. His\ndaughter, who was born in 1804, used afterward to boast that on\none side she was sprung from kings and nobles, while on the other\nshe was a daughter of the people, able, therefore, to understand\nthe sentiments of the aristocracy and of the children of the soil,\nor even of the gutter.",
        "She was fond of telling, also, of the omen which attended on her\nbirth. Her father and mother were at a country dance in the house\nof a fellow officer of Dupin’s. Suddenly Mme. Dupin left the room.\nNothing was thought of this, and the dance went on. In less than\nan hour, Dupin was called aside and told that his wife had just\ngiven birth to a child. It was the child’s aunt who brought the\nnews, with the joyous comment:",
        "“She will be lucky, for she was born among the roses and to the\nsound of music.”",
        "This was at the time of the Napoleonic wars. Lieutenant Dupin was\non the staff of Prince Murat, and little Aurore, as she was\ncalled, at the age of three accompanied the army, as did her\nmother. The child was adopted by one of those hard-fighting,\nveteran regiments. The rough old sergeants nursed her and petted\nher. Even the prince took notice of her; and to please him she\nwore the green uniform of a hussar.",
        "But all this soon passed, and she was presently sent to live with\nher grandmother at the estate now intimately associated with her\nname–Nohant, in the valley of the Indre, in the midst of a rich\ncountry, a love for which she then drank in so deeply that nothing\nin her later life could lessen it. She was always the friend of\nthe peasant and of the country-folk in general.",
        "At Nohant she was given over to her grand-mother, to be reared in\na strangely desultory sort of fashion, doing and reading and\nstudying those things which could best develop her native gifts.\nHer father had great influence over her, teaching her a thousand\nthings without seeming to teach her anything. Of him George Sand\nherself has written:",
        "Character is a matter of heredity. If any one desires to know me,\nhe must know my father.",
        "Her father, however, was killed by a fall from a horse; and then\nthe child grew up almost without any formal education. A tutor,\nwho also managed the estate; believed with Rousseau that the young\nshould be reared according to their own preferences. Therefore,\nAurore read poems and childish stories; she gained a smattering of\nLatin, and she was devoted to music and the elements of natural\nscience. For the rest of the time she rambled with the country\nchildren, learned their games, and became a sort of leader in\neverything they did.",
        "Her only sorrow was the fact that her mother was excluded from\nNohant. The aristocratic old grandmother would not allow under her\nroof her son’s low-born wife; but she was devoted to her little\ngrandchild. The girl showed a wonderful degree of sensibility.",
        "This life was adapted to her nature. She fed her imagination in a\nperfectly healthy fashion; and, living so much out of doors, she\nacquired that sound physique which she retained all through her\nlife.",
        "When she was thirteen, her grandmother sent the girl to a convent\nschool in Paris. One might suppose that the sudden change from the\nopen woods and fields to the primness of a religious home would\nhave been a great shock to her, and that with her disposition she\nmight have broken out into wild ways that would have shocked the\nnuns. But, here, as elsewhere, she showed her wonderful\nadaptability. It even seemed as if she were likely to become what\nthe French call a devote. She gave herself up to mythical\nthoughts, and expressed a desire of taking the veil. Her\nconfessor, however, was a keen student of human nature, and he\nperceived that she was too young to decide upon the renunciation\nof earthly things. Moreover, her grandmother, who had no intention\nthat Aurore should become a nun, hastened to Paris and carried her\nback to Nohant.",
        "The girl was now sixteen, and her complicated nature began to make\nitself apparent. There was no one to control her, because her\ngrandmother was confined to her own room. And so Aurore Dupin, now\nin superb health, rushed into every sort of diversion with all the\nzest of youth. She read voraciously–religion, poetry, philosophy.\nShe was an excellent musician, playing the piano and the harp.\nOnce, in a spirit of unconscious egotism, she wrote to her\nconfessor:",
        "Do you think that my philosophical studies are compatible with\nChristian humility?",
        "The shrewd ecclesiastic answered, with a touch of wholesome irony:",
        "I doubt, my daughter, whether your philosophical studies are\nprofound enough to warrant intellectual pride.",
        "This stung the girl, and led her to think a little less of her own\nabilities; but perhaps it made her books distasteful to her. For a\nwhile she seems to have almost forgotten her sex. She began to\ndress as a boy, and took to smoking large quantities of tobacco.\nHer natural brother, who was an officer in the army, came down to\nNohant and taught her to ride–to ride like a boy, seated astride.\nShe went about without any chaperon, and flirted with the young\nmen of the neighborhood. The prim manners of the place made her\nsubject to a certain amount of scandal, and the village priest\nchided her in language that was far from tactful. In return she\nrefused any longer to attend his church.",
        "Thus she was living when her grandmother died, in 1821, leaving to\nAurore her entire fortune of five hundred thousand francs. As the\ngirl was still but seventeen, she was placed under the\nguardianship of the nearest relative on her father’s side–a\ngentleman of rank. When the will was read, Aurore’s mother made a\nviolent protest, and caused a most unpleasant scene.",
        "“I am the natural guardian of my child,” she cried. “No one can\ntake away my rights!”",
        "The young girl well understood that this was really the parting of\nthe ways. If she turned toward her uncle, she would be forever\nclassed among the aristocracy. If she chose her mother, who,\nthough married, was essentially a grisette, then she must live\nwith grisettes, and find her friends among the friends who visited\nher mother. She could not belong to both worlds. She must decide\nonce for all whether she would be a woman of rank or a woman\nentirely separated from the circle that had been her father’s.",
        "One must respect the girl for making the choice she did.\nUnderstanding the situation absolutely, she chose her mother; and\nperhaps one would not have had her do otherwise. Yet in the long\nrun it was bound to be a mistake. Aurore was clever, refined, well\nread, and had had the training of a fashionable convent school.\nThe mother was ignorant and coarse, as was inevitable, with one\nwho before her marriage had been half shop-girl and half\ncourtesan. The two could not live long together, and hence it was\nnot unnatural that Aurore Dupin should marry, to enter upon a new\ncareer.",
        "Her fortune was a fairly large one for the times, and yet not\nlarge enough to attract men who were quite her equals. Presently,\nhowever, it brought to her a sort of country squire, named Casimir\nDudevant. He was the illegitimate son of the Baron Dudevant. He\nhad been in the army, and had studied law; but he possessed no\nintellectual tastes. He was outwardly eligible; but he was of a\ncoarse type–a man who, with passing years, would be likely to\ntake to drink and vicious amusements, and in serious life cared\nonly for his cattle, his horses, and his hunting. He had, however,\na sort of jollity about him which appealed to this girl of\neighteen; and so a marriage was arranged. Aurore Dupin became his\nwife in 1822, and he secured the control of her fortune.",
        "The first few years after her marriage were not unhappy. She had a\nson, Maurice Dudevant, and a daughter, Solange, and she loved them\nboth. But it was impossible that she should continue vegetating\nmentally upon a farm with a husband who was a fool, a drunkard,\nand a miser. He deteriorated; his wife grew more and more clever.\nDudevant resented this. It made him uncomfortable. Other persons\nspoke of her talk as brilliant. He bluntly told her that it was\nsilly, and that she must stop it. When she did not stop it, he\nboxed her ears. This caused a breach between the pair which was\nnever healed. Dudevant drank more and more heavily, and jeered at\nhis wife because she was “always looking for noon at fourteen\no’clock.” He had always flirted with the country girls; but now he\nopenly consorted with his wife’s chambermaid.",
        "Mme. Dudevant, on her side, would have nothing more to do with\nthis rustic rake. She formed what she called a platonic\nfriendship–and it was really so–with a certain M. de Seze, who\nwas advocate-general at Bordeaux. With him this clever woman could\ntalk without being called silly, and he took sincere pleasure in\nher company. He might, in fact, have gone much further, had not\nboth of them been in an impossible situation.",
        "Aurore Dudevant really believed that she was swayed by a pure and\nmystic passion. De Seze, on the other hand, believed this mystic\npassion to be genuine love. Coming to visit her at Nohant, he was\nrevolted by the clownish husband with whom she lived. It gave him\nan esthetic shock to see that she had borne children to this boor.\nTherefore he shrank back from her, and in time their relation\nfaded into nothingness.",
        "It happened, soon after, that she found a packet in her husband’s\ndesk, marked “Not to be opened until after my death.” She wrote of\nthis in her correspondence:",
        "I had not the patience to wait till widowhood. No one can be sure\nof surviving anybody. I assumed that my husband had died, and I\nwas very glad to learn what he thought of me while he was alive.\nSince the package was addressed to me, it was not dishonorable for\nme to open it.",
        "And so she opened it. It proved to be his will, but containing, as\na preamble, his curses on her, expressions of contempt, and all\nthe vulgar outpouring of an evil temper and angry passion. She\nwent to her husband as he was opening a bottle, and flung the\ndocument upon the table. He cowered at her glance, at her\nfirmness, and at her cold hatred. He grumbled and argued and\nentreated; but all that his wife would say in answer was:",
        "“I must have an allowance. I am going to Paris, and my children\nare to remain here.”",
        "At last he yielded, and she went at once to Paris, taking her\ndaughter with her, and having the promise of fifteen hundred\nfrancs a year out of the half-million that was hers by right.",
        "In Paris she developed into a thorough-paced Bohemian. She tried\nto make a living in sundry hopeless ways, and at last she took to\nliterature. She was living in a garret, with little to eat, and\nsometimes without a fire in winter. She had some friends who\nhelped her as well as they could, but though she was attached to\nthe Figaro, her earnings for the first month amounted to only\nfifteen francs.",
        "Nevertheless, she would not despair. The editors and publishers\nmight turn the cold shoulder to her, but she would not give up her\nambitions. She went down into the Latin Quarter, and there shook\noff the proprieties of life. She assumed the garb of a man, and\nwith her quick perception she came to know the left bank of the\nSeine just as she had known the country-side at Nohant or the\nlittle world at her convent school. She never expected again to\nsee any woman of her own rank in life. Her mother’s influence\nbecame strong in her. She wrote:",
        "The proprieties are the guiding principle of people without soul\nand virtue. The good opinion of the world is a prostitute who\ngives herself to the highest bidder.",
        "She still pursued her trade of journalism, calling herself a\n“newspaper mechanic,” sitting all day in the office of the Figaro\nand writing whatever was demanded, while at night she would prowl\nin the streets haunting the cafes, continuing to dress like a man,\ndrinking sour wine, and smoking cheap cigars.",
        "One of her companions in this sort of hand-to-mouth journalism was\na young student and writer named Jules Sandeau, a man seven years\nyounger than his comrade. He was at that time as indigent as she,\nand their hardships, shared in common, brought them very close\ntogether. He was clever, boyish, and sensitive, and it was not\nlong before he had fallen at her feet and kissed her knees,\nbegging that she would requite the love he felt for her. According\nto herself, she resisted him for six months, and then at last she\nyielded. The two made their home together, and for a while were\nwonderfully happy. Their work and their diversions they enjoyed in\ncommon, and now for the first time she experienced emotions which\nin all probability she had never known before.",
        "Probably not very much importance is to be given to the earlier\nflirtations of George Sand, though she herself never tried to stop\nthe mouth of scandal. Even before she left her husband, she was\ncredited with having four lovers; but all she said, when the\nreport was brought to her, was this: “Four lovers are none too\nmany for one with such lively passions as mine.”",
        "This very frankness makes it likely that she enjoyed shocking her\nprim neighbors at Nohant. But if she only played at love-making\nthen, she now gave herself up to it with entire abandonment,\nintoxicated, fascinated, satisfied. She herself wrote:",
        "How I wish I could impart to you this sense of the intensity and\njoyousness of life that I have in my veins. To live! How sweet it\nis, and how good, in spite of annoyances, husbands, debts,\nrelations, scandal-mongers, sufferings, and irritations! To live!\nIt is intoxicating! To love, and to be loved! It is happiness! It\nis heaven!",
        "In collaboration with Jules Sandeau, she wrote a novel called Rose\net Blanche. The two lovers were uncertain what name to place upon\nthe title-page, but finally they hit upon the pseudonym of Jules\nSand. The book succeeded; but thereafter each of them wrote\nseparately, Jules Sandeau using his own name, and Mme. Dudevant\nstyling herself George Sand, a name by which she was to be\nillustrious ever after.",
        "As a novelist, she had found her real vocation. She was not yet\nwell known, but she was on the verge of fame. As soon as she had\nwritten Indiana and Valentine, George Sand had secured a place in\nthe world of letters. The magazine which still exists as the Revue\ndes Deux Mondes gave her a retaining fee of four thousand francs a\nyear, and many other publications begged her to write serial\nstories for them.",
        "The vein which ran through all her stories was new and piquant. As\nwas said of her:",
        "In George Sand, whenever a lady wishes to change her lover, God is\nalways there to make the transfer easy.",
        "In other words, she preached free love in the name of religion.\nThis was not a new doctrine with her. After the first break with\nher husband, she had made up her mind about certain matters, and\nwrote:",
        "One is no more justified in claiming the ownership of a soul than\nin claiming the ownership of a slave.",
        "According to her, the ties between a man and a woman are sacred\nonly when they are sanctified by love; and she distinguished\nbetween love and passion in this epigram:",
        "Love seeks to give, while passion seeks to take.",
        "At this time, George Sand was in her twenty-seventh year. She was\nnot beautiful, though there was something about her which\nattracted observation. Of middle height, she was fairly slender.\nHer eyes were somewhat projecting, and her mouth was almost sullen\nwhen in repose. Her manners were peculiar, combining boldness with\ntimidity. Her address was almost as familiar as a man’s, so that\nit was easy to be acquainted with her; yet a certain haughtiness\nand a touch of aristocratic pride made it plain that she had drawn\na line which none must pass without her wish. When she was deeply\nstirred, however, she burst forth into an extraordinary vivacity,\nshowing a nature richly endowed and eager to yield its treasures.",
        "The existence which she now led was a curious one. She still\nvisited her husband at Nohant, so that she might see her son, and\nsometimes, when M. Dudevant came to town, he called upon her in\nthe apartments which she shared with Jules Sandeau. He had\naccepted the situation, and with his crudeness and lack of feeling\nhe seemed to think it, if not natural, at least diverting. At any\nrate, so long as he could retain her half-million francs, he was\nnot the man to make trouble about his former wife’s arrangements.",
        "Meanwhile, there began to be perceptible the very slightest rift\nwithin the lute of her romance. Was her love for Sandeau really\nlove, or was it only passion? In his absence, at any rate, the old\nobsession still continued. Here we see, first of all, intense\npleasure shading off into a sort of maternal fondness. She sends\nSandeau adoring letters. She is afraid that his delicate appetite\nis not properly satisfied.",
        "Yet, again, there are times when she feels that he is irritating\nand ill. Those who knew them said that her nature was too\npassionate and her love was too exacting for him. One of her\nletters seems to make this plain. She writes that she feels\nuneasy, and even frightfully remorseful, at seeing Sandeau “pine\naway.” She knows, she avows, that she is killing him, that her\ncaresses are a poison, and her love a consuming fire.",
        "It is an appalling thought, and Jules will not understand it. He\nlaughs at it; and when, in the midst of his transports of delight,\nthe idea comes to me and makes my blood run cold, he tells me that\nhere is the death that he would like to die. At such moments he\npromises whatever I make him promise.",
        "This letter throws a clear light upon the nature of George Sand’s\ntemperament. It will be found all through her career, not only\nthat she sought to inspire passion, but that she strove to gratify\nit after fashions of her own. One little passage from a\ndescription of her written by the younger Dumas will perhaps make\nthis phase of her character more intelligible, without going\nfurther than is strictly necessary:",
        "Mme. Sand has little hands without any bones, soft and plump. She\nis by destiny a woman of excessive curiosity, always disappointed,\nalways deceived in her incessant investigation, but she is not\nfundamentally ardent. In vain would she like to be so, but she\ndoes not find it possible. Her physical nature utterly refuses.",
        "The reader will find in all that has now been said the true\nexplanation of George Sand. Abounding with life, but incapable of\nlong stretches of ardent love, she became a woman who sought\nconquests everywhere without giving in return more than her\ntemperament made it possible for her to do. She loved Sandeau as\nmuch as she ever loved any man; and yet she left him with a sense\nthat she had never become wholly his. Perhaps this is the reason\nwhy their romance came to an end abruptly, and not altogether\nfittingly.",
        "She had been spending a short time at Nohant, and came to Paris\nwithout announcement. She intended to surprise her lover, and she\nsurely did so. She found him in the apartment that had been\ntheirs, with his arms about an attractive laundry-girl. Thus\nclosed what was probably the only true romance in the life of\nGeorge Sand. Afterward she had many lovers, but to no one did she\nso nearly become a true mate.",
        "As it was, she ended her association with Sandeau, and each\npursued a separate path to fame. Sandeau afterward became a well-\nknown novelist and dramatist. He was, in fact, the first writer of\nfiction who was admitted to the French Academy. The woman to whom\nhe had been unfaithful became greater still, because her fame was\nnot only national, but cosmopolitan.",
        "For a time after her deception by Sandeau, she felt absolutely\ndevoid of all emotions. She shunned men, and sought the friendship\nof Marie Dorval, a clever actress who was destined afterward to\nbreak the heart of Alfred de Vigny. The two went down into the\ncountry; and there George Sand wrote hour after hour, sitting by\nher fireside, and showing herself a tender mother to her little\ndaughter Solange.",
        "This life lasted for a while, but it was not the sort of life that\nwould now content her. She had many visitors from Paris, among\nthem Sainte-Beuve, the critic, who brought with him Prosper\nMerimee, then unknown, but later famous as master of revels to the\nthird Napoleon and as the author of Carmen. Merimee had a certain\nfascination of manner, and the predatory instincts of George Sand\nwere again aroused. One day, when she felt bored and desperate,\nMerimee paid his court to her, and she listened to him. This is\none of the most remarkable of her intimacies, since it began,\ncontinued, and ended all in the space of a single week. When\nMerimee left Nohant, he was destined never again to see George\nSand, except long afterward at a dinner-party, where the two\nstared at each other sharply, but did not speak. This affair,\nhowever, made it plain that she could not long remain at Nohant,\nand that she pined for Paris.",
        "Returning thither, she is said to have set her cap at Victor Hugo,\nwho was, however, too much in love with himself to care for any\none, especially a woman who was his literary rival. She is said\nfor a time to have been allied with Gustave Planche, a dramatic\ncritic; but she always denied this, and her denial may be taken as\nquite truthful. Soon, however, she was to begin an episode which\nhas been more famous than any other in her curious history, for\nshe met Alfred de Musset, then a youth of twenty-three, but\nalready well known for his poems and his plays.",
        "Musset was of noble birth. He would probably have been better for\na plebeian strain, since there was in him a touch of the\ndegenerate. His mother’s father had published a humanitarian poem\non cats. His great-uncle had written a peculiar novel. Young\nAlfred was nervous, delicate, slightly epileptic, and it is\ncertain that he was given to dissipation, which so far had\naffected his health only by making him hysterical. He was an\nexceedingly handsome youth, with exquisite manners, “dreamy rather\nthan dazzling eyes, dilated nostrils, and vermilion lips half\nopened.” Such was he when George Sand, then seven years his\nsenior, met him.",
        "There is something which, to the Anglo-Saxon mind, seems far more\nabsurd than pathetic about the events which presently took place.\nA woman like George Sand at thirty was practically twice the age\nof this nervous boy of twenty-three, who had as yet seen little of\nthe world. At first she seemed to realize the fact herself; but\nher vanity led her to begin an intrigue, which must have been\nalmost wholly without excitement on her part, but which to him,\nfor a time, was everything in the world.",
        "Experimenting, as usual, after the fashion described by Dumas, she\nwent with De Musset for a “honeymoon” to Fontainebleau. But they\ncould not stay there forever, and presently they decided upon a\njourney to Italy. Before they went, however, they thought it\nnecessary to get formal permission from Alfred’s mother!",
        "Naturally enough, Mme. de Musset refused consent. She had read\nGeorge Sand’s romances, and had asked scornfully:",
        "“Has the woman never in her life met a gentleman?”",
        "She accepted the relations between them, but that she should be\nasked to sanction this sort of affair was rather too much, even\nfor a French mother who has become accustomed to many strange\nthings. Then there was a curious happening. At nine o’clock at\nnight, George Sand took a cab and drove to the house of Mme. de\nMusset, to whom she sent up a message that a lady wished to see\nher. Mme. de Musset came down, and, finding a woman alone in a\ncarriage, she entered it. Then George Sand burst forth in a\ntorrent of sentimental eloquence. She overpowered her lover’s\nmother, promised to take great care of the delicate youth, and\nfinally drove away to meet Alfred at the coach-yard.",
        "They started off in the mist, their coach being the thirteenth to\nleave the yard; but the two lovers were in a merry mood, and\nenjoyed themselves all the way from Paris to Marseilles. By\nsteamer they went to Leghorn; and finally, in January, 1834, they\ntook an apartment in a hotel at Venice. What had happened that\ntheir arrival in Venice should be the beginning of a quarrel, no\none knows. George Sand has told the story, and Paul de Musset–\nAlfred’s brother–has told the story, but each of them has\ndoubtless omitted a large part of the truth.",
        "It is likely that on their long journey each had learned too much\nof the other. Thus, Paul de Musset says that George Sand made\nherself outrageous by her conversation, telling every one of her\nmother’s adventures in the army of Italy, including her relations\nwith the general-in-chief. She also declared that she herself was\nborn within a month of her parents’ wedding-day. Very likely she\ndid say all these things, whether they were true or not. She had\nset herself to wage war against conventional society, and she did\neverything to shock it.",
        "On the other hand, Alfred de Musset fell ill after having lost ten\nthousand francs in a gambling-house. George Sand was not fond of\npersons who were ill. She herself was working like a horse,\nwriting from eight to thirteen hours a day. When Musset collapsed\nshe sent for a handsome young Italian doctor named Pagello, with\nwhom she had struck up a casual acquaintance. He finally cured\nMusset, but he also cured George Sand of any love for Musset.",
        "Before long she and Pagello were on their way back to Paris,\nleaving the poor, fevered, whimpering poet to bite his nails and\nthink unutterable things. But he ought to have known George Sand.\nAfter that, everybody knew her. They knew just how much she cared\nwhen she professed to care, and when she acted as she acted with\nPagello no earlier lover had any one but himself to blame.",
        "Only sentimentalists can take this story seriously. To them it has\na sort of morbid interest. They like to picture Musset raving and\nshouting in his delirium, and then, to read how George Sand sat on\nPagello’s knees, kissing him and drinking out of the same cup. But\nto the healthy mind the whole story is repulsive–from George\nSand’s appeal to Mme. de Musset down to the very end, when Pagello\ncame to Paris, where his broken French excited a polite ridicule.",
        "There was a touch of genuine sentiment about the affair with Jules\nSandeau; but after that, one can only see in George Sand a half-\nlibidinous grisette, such as her mother was before her, with a\nperfect willingness to experiment in every form of lawless love.\nAs for Musset, whose heart she was supposed to have broken, within\na year he was dangling after the famous singer, Mme. Malibran, and\nwriting poems to her which advertised their intrigue.",
        "After this episode with Pagello, it cannot be said that the life\nof George Sand was edifying in any respect, because no one can\nassume that she was sincere. She had loved Jules Sandeau as much\nas she could love any one, but all the rest of her intrigues and\naffinities were in the nature of experiments. She even took back\nAlfred de Musset, although they could never again regard each\nother without suspicion. George Sand cut off all her hair and gave\nit to Musset, so eager was she to keep him as a matter of\nconquest; but he was tired of her, and even this theatrical trick\nwas of no avail.",
        "She proceeded to other less known and less humiliating adventures.\nShe tried to fascinate the artist Delacroix. She set her cap at\nFranz Liszt, who rather astonished her by saying that only God was\nworthy to be loved. She expressed a yearning for the affections of\nthe elder Dumas; but that good-natured giant laughed at her, and\nin fact gave her some sound advice, and let her smoke\nunsentimentally in his study. She was a good deal taken with a\nnoisy demagogue named Michel, a lawyer at Bourges, who on one\noccasion shut her up in her room and harangued her on sociology\nuntil she was as weary of his talk as of his wooden shoes, his\nshapeless greatcoat, his spectacles, and his skull-cap, Balzac\nfelt her fascination, but cared nothing for her, since his love\nwas given to Mme. Hanska.",
        "In the meanwhile, she was paying visits to her husband at Nohant,\nwhere she wrangled with him over money matters, and where he would\nonce have shot her had the guests present not interfered. She\nsecured her dowry by litigation, so that she was well off, even\nwithout her literary earnings. These were by no means so large as\none would think from her popularity and from the number of books\nshe wrote. It is estimated that her whole gains amounted to about\na million francs, extending over a period of forty-five years. It\nis just half the amount that Trollope earned in about the same\nperiod, and justifies his remark–\"adequate, but not splendid.”",
        "One of those brief and strange intimacies that marked the career\nof George Sand came about in a curious way. Octave Feuillet, a man\nof aristocratic birth, had set himself to write novels which\nportrayed the cynicism and hardness of the upper classes in\nFrance. One of these novels, Sibylle, excited the anger of George\nSand. She had not known Feuillet before; yet now she sought him\nout, at first in order to berate him for his book, but in the end\nto add him to her variegated string of lovers.",
        "It has been said of Feuillet that he was a sort of “domesticated\nMusset.” At any rate, he was far less sensitive than Musset, and\nGeorge Sand was about seventeen years his senior. They parted\nafter a short time, she going her way as a writer of novels that\nwere very different from her earlier ones, while Feuillet grew\nmore and more cynical and even stern, as he lashed the abnormal,\nneuropathic men and women about him.",
        "The last great emotional crisis in George Sand’s life was that\nwhich centers around her relations with Frederic Chopin. Chopin\nwas the greatest genius who ever loved her. It is rather odd that\nhe loved her. She had known him for two years, and had not\nseriously thought of him, though there is a story that when she\nfirst met him she kissed him before he had even been presented to\nher. She waited two years, and in those two years she had three\nlovers. Then at last she once more met Chopin, when he was in a\nstate of melancholy, because a Polish girl had proved unfaithful\nto him.",
        "It was the psychological moment; for this other woman, who was a\ndevourer of hearts, found him at a piano, improvising a\nlamentation. George Sand stood beside him, listening. When he\nfinished and looked up at her, their eyes met. She bent down\nwithout a word and kissed him on the lips.",
        "What was she like when he saw her then? Grenier has described her\nin these words:",
        "She was short and stout, but her face attracted all my attention,\nthe eyes especially. They were wonderful eyes–a little too close\ntogether, it may be, large, with full eyelids, and black, very\nblack, but by no means lustrous; they reminded me of unpolished\nmarble, or rather of velvet, and this gave a strange, dull, even\ncold expression to her countenance. Her fine eyebrows and these\ngreat placid eyes gave her an air of strength and dignity which\nwas not borne out by the lower part of her face. Her nose was\nrather thick and not over shapely. Her mouth was also rather\ncoarse, and her chin small. She spoke with great simplicity, and\nher manners were very quiet.",
        "Such as she was, she attached herself to Chopin for eight years.\nAt first they traveled together very quietly to Majorca; and\nthere, just as Musset had fallen ill at Venice, Chopin became\nfeverish and an invalid. “Chopin coughs most gracefully,” George\nSand wrote of him, and again:",
        "Chopin is the most inconstant of men. There is nothing permanent\nabout him but his cough.",
        "It is not surprising if her nerves sometimes gave way. Acting as\nsick nurse, writing herself with rheumatic fingers, robbed by\nevery one about her, and viewed with suspicion by the peasants\nbecause she did not go to church, she may be perhaps excused for\nher sharp words when, in fact, her deeds were kind.",
        "Afterward, with Chopin, she returned to Paris, and the two lived\nopenly together for seven years longer. An immense literature has\ngrown around the subject of their relations. To this literature\nGeorge Sand herself contributed very largely. Chopin never wrote a\nword; but what he failed to do, his friends and pupils did\nunsparingly.",
        "Probably the truth is somewhat as one might expect. During the\nfirst period of fascination, George Sand was to Chopin what she\nhad been to Sandeau and to Musset; and with her strange and subtle\nways, she had undermined his health. But afterward that sort of\nlove died out, and was succeeded by something like friendship. At\nany rate, this woman showed, as she had shown to others, a vast\nmaternal kindness. She writes to him finally as “your old woman,\"\nand she does wonders in the way of nursing and care.",
        "But in 1847 came a break between the two. Whatever the mystery of\nit may be, it turns upon what Chopin said of Sand:",
        "“I have never cursed any one, but now I am so weary of life that I\nam near cursing her. Yet she suffers, too, and more, because she\ngrows older as she grows more wicked.”",
        "In 1848, Chopin gave his last concert in Paris, and in 1849 he\ndied. According to some, he was the victim of a Messalina.\nAccording to others, it was only “Messalina” that had kept him\nalive so long.",
        "However, with his death came a change in the nature of George\nSand. Emotionally, she was an extinct volcano. Intellectually, she\nwas at her very best. She no longer tore passions into tatters,\nbut wrote naturally, simply, stories of country life and tales for\nchildren. In one of her books she has given an enduring picture of\nthe Franco-Prussian War. There are many rather pleasant\ndescriptions of her then, living at Nohant, where she made a\ncurious figure, bustling about in ill-fitting costumes, and\nsmoking interminable cigarettes.",
        "She had lived much, and she had drunk deep of life, when she died\nin 1876. One might believe her to have been only a woman of\nperpetual liaisons. Externally she was this, and yet what did\nBalzac, that great master of human psychology, write of her in the\nintimacy of a private correspondence?",
        "She is a female bachelor. She is an artist. She is generous. She\nis devoted. She is chaste. Her dominant characteristics are those\nof a man, and therefore, she is not to be regarded as a woman. She\nis an excellent mother, adored by her children. Morally, she is\nlike a lad of twenty; for in her heart of hearts, she is more than\nchaste–she is a prude. It is only in externals that she comports\nherself as a Bohemian. All her follies are titles to glory in the\neyes of those whose souls are noble.",
        "A curious verdict this! Her love-life seems almost that of neither\nman nor woman, but of an animal. Yet whether she was in reality\nresponsible for what she did, when we consider her strange\nheredity, her wretched marriage, the disillusions of her early\nlife–who shall sit in judgment on her, since who knows all?",
