        "Tommy Grimes was sometimes a good boy, and sometimes a bad boy; and\nwhen he was a bad boy, he was a very bad boy. Now his mother used to\nsay to him: “Tommy, Tommy, be a good boy, and don’t go out of the\nstreet, or else Mr. Miacca will take you.” But still when he was a bad\nboy he would go out of the street; and one day, sure enough, he had\nscarcely got round the corner, when Mr. Miacca did catch him and\npopped him into a bag upside down, and took him off to his house.",
        "When Mr. Miacca got Tommy inside, he pulled him out of the bag and set\nhim down, and felt his arms and legs. “You’re rather tough,” says he;\n“but you’re all I’ve got for supper, and you’ll not taste bad boiled.\nBut body o’ me, I’ve forgot the herbs, and it’s bitter you’ll taste\nwithout herbs. Sally! Here, I say, Sally!” and he called Mrs. Miacca.",
        "So Mrs. Miacca came out of another room and said: “What d’ye want, my\ndear?”",
        "“Oh, here’s a little boy for supper,” said Mr. Miacca, “and I’ve\nforgot the herbs. Mind him, will ye, while I go for them.”",
        "“All right, my love,” says Mrs. Miacca, and off he goes.",
        "Then Tommy Grimes said to Mrs. Miacca: “Does Mr. Miacca always have\nlittle boys for supper?”",
        "“Mostly, my dear,” said Mrs. Miacca, “if little boys are bad enough,\nand get in his way.”",
        "“And don’t you have anything else but boy-meat? No pudding?” asked\nTommy.",
        "“Ah, I loves pudding,” says Mrs. Miacca. “But it’s not often the likes\nof me gets pudding.”",
        "“Why, my mother is making a pudding this very day,” said Tommy\nGrimes, “and I am sure she’d give you some, if I ask her. Shall I run\nand get some?”",
        "“Now, that’s a thoughtful boy,” said Mrs. Miacca, “only don’t be long\nand be sure to be back for supper.”",
        "So off Tommy pelters, and right glad he was to get off so cheap; and\nfor many a long day he was as good as good could be, and never went\nround the corner of the street. But he couldn’t always be good; and\none day he went round the corner, and as luck would have it, he hadn’t\nscarcely got round it when Mr. Miacca grabbed him up, popped him in\nhis bag, and took him home.",
        "When he got him there, Mr. Miacca dropped him out; and when he saw\nhim, he said: “Ah, you’re the youngster what served me and my missus\nthat shabby trick, leaving us without any supper. Well, you shan’t do\nit again. I’ll watch over you myself. Here, get under the sofa, and\nI’ll set on it and watch the pot boil for you.”",
        "So poor Tommy Grimes had to creep under the sofa, and Mr. Miacca sat\non it and waited for the pot to boil. And they waited, and they\nwaited, but still the pot didn’t boil, till at last Mr. Miacca got\ntired of waiting, and he said: “Here, you under there, I’m not going\nto wait any longer; put out your leg, and I’ll stop your giving us the\nslip.”",
        "So Tommy put out a leg, and Mr. Miacca got a chopper, and chopped it\noff, and pops it in the pot.",
        "Suddenly he calls out: “Sally, my dear, Sally!” and nobody answered.\nSo he went into the next room to look out for Mrs. Miacca, and while\nhe was there, Tommy crept out from under the sofa and ran out of the\ndoor. For it was a leg of the sofa that he had put out.",
        "So Tommy Grimes ran home, and he never went round the corner again\ntill he was old enough to go alone.",
