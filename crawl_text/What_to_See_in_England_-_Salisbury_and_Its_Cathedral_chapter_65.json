        "Salisbury Cathedral is, in the opinion of many, the finest of all the\nEnglish cathedrals, and it certainly has many claims to be considered\nso. The vast building was completed within fifty years, and is therefore\npractically in one style throughout, an advantage not shared by any\nother cathedral in the kingdom. Its situation, too, is unique, standing\nas it does in the fine old close, entirely separated from any other\nbuildings, and with its grey walls and buttresses rising sheer up from\nsuch velvety turf as is seen in England alone. The tower and spire are\nperhaps the most beautiful in this country.",
        "Passing into the close by the gate at the end of the High Street, one\nreaches the west front, which is very rich in effect, with its tiers of\ncanopied statues and wonderfully proportioned windows. Through the\nbeautiful north porch one passes into the nave, which, though\nexceedingly beautiful, has a certain air of coldness owing to the\nabsence of stained glass. It seems hardly credible that this beautiful\nglass, the making of which is now a lost art, was deliberately destroyed\nat the end of the eighteenth century by the so-called “architect” James\nWyatt. In addition to this, “Wyatt swept away screens, chapels, and\nporches, desecrated and destroyed the tombs of warriors and prelates;\nobliterated ancient paintings, flung stained glass by cartloads into the\ncity ditch, and razed to the ground the beautiful old campanile which\nstood opposite the north porch.”",
        "The Lady Chapel of the cathedral is one of the most beautiful in the\nkingdom.",
        "Although the cathedral is the great glory of Salisbury, there are plenty\nof interesting mediaeval buildings in the city. In the close itself are\nthe King’s House and the King’s Wardrobe, both old gabled houses of\ngreat beauty. St. Thomas’s and St. Edmund’s are the two most interesting\nchurches in the city.",
        "About 2 miles north of Salisbury is a group of pretty cottages on the\nAvon, forming the village of Milston. Here, on May 1, 1672, Joseph\nAddison was born in the old rectory, now unfortunately pulled down. His\nfather, Lancelot Addison, was rector of the parish.",

        "The spire is one of the most graceful in the world, and the whole\nbuilding, commenced in 1220, was completed within fifty years.]",
