        "We are taught that “God hath made of one blood all nations of men to\ndwell on the face of the earth,” and when we say mutual relief and\nassistance is a leading office in our affiliation, and that\nOdd-Fellowship is systematically endeavoring to improve and elevate the\ncharacter of man, to imbue him with a proper conception of his\ncapabilities for good, to enlighten his mind, to enlarge the sphere of\nhis affections and to redeem him from the thralldom of ignorance and\nprejudice, and teach him to recognize the fatherhood of God and the\nbrotherhood of men, we have epitomized the objects, purposes and basic\nprinciples of our order.  Odd-Fellowship is broad and comprehensive.\nIt is founded upon that eternal principle which teaches that all the\nworld is one family and all mankind are brothers.  Unheralded and\nunsung, it was born and went forth, a breath of love, a sweet song that\nhas filled thousands of hearts with joy and gladness.  To the rich and\nthe poor, the old and the young, at all times, comes the rich, sweet\nmelody of this song of humanity to comfort and to cheer.  For eighty\nyears the light of Odd-Fellowship has burned before the world, a beacon\nto the lost, a comfort to the wanderer and a protection to the\nthoughtless.  Eighty years of work for humanity’s sake; eighty years\ndevoted to teaching men to love mankind; eighty years of earnest labor,\nconsecrated by friendship, cemented with love and beautified by truth.\nIn ancient times men sought glory and renown in gladiatorial combat,\nthough the victor’s laurel was wet with human blood.  In modern times\nmen seek the plaudits of the world by achievements for human good, and\nby striving to elevate and ennoble men.  Looking back through nineteen\ncenturies we behold a cross, and on it the crucified Christ, with\nnail-pierced hands, and wounded, bleeding side, but whose heart was so\nfull of love and pity that even in His dying agonies He had compassion\nupon His persecutors, and cried out, “Father, forgive them, for they\nknow not what they do.”",
        "That event was the dividing line between the ancient and the modern\nera; between the rule of “brute force” and the “mild dominion of love\nand charity.”  The mission of Odd-Fellowship, like that of the lowly\nNazarene, is to replace the rule of might with the gentle influence of\nlove, and to teach a universal fraternity in the family of man.  To\nmeet and satisfy and better keep alive the nobler elements of man’s\nnature.  Many orders have been instituted, but none can challenge\ngreater admiration from men, or deserve more blessings from heaven,\nthan the Independent Order of Odd-Fellows.  Looking back along the\npathway of the century behind us we behold the wrecks of many orders.\nThe morning of their life was beautiful and full of glorious promise,\nbut the evening came and they had perished.  Rich costumes, impressive\nceremonies, beautiful degrees and magnificent effects, all lie buried\nand forgotten.  It was not because their founders lacked energy or\nenthusiasm, not because their members were less susceptible to the\nbeauty and poetry of tradition and ceremony, but because success and\nperpetuity come not from human effort, but are the outgrowth of a\nlife-giving principle.  The sculptor fashions from the marble a form of\nsurpassing loveliness, its lines are those of grace and beauty.  We\nstand before it charmed, whispering our admiration, but the impression\non the heart is only passing.  The poet sings of home, of mother and of\nlove; the meter may be faulty and the words may charm not, but the\nsentiment is true and touches our hearts.  The experience it recites is\ncommon to humanity, and wherever its sweet tones are heard it softens\nmen’s natures and makes them better, truer and nobler.  Who among us\nwould be willing to exchange the influence of the immortal song “Home\nSweet Home,” or be willing to forget the Christian’s “Nearer My God to\nThee,” for all the inanimate beauty of art?  One charms the eye, the\nother touches and calls to life the best and sweetest emotions of the\nhuman heart.  So it is with fraternal societies.  Flashing swords,\nglittering helmets, jeweled regalias and beautiful degrees may touch\nthe vanity and excite the admiration, but to win the heart we must\nsatisfy its longings, feed its hopes and lift it above the narrowness\nand selfishness of its daily experience.  Odd-Fellowship strives to\ntouch the heart and better feelings, rather than feed the vanity of man\nor arouse his admiration for gorgeous displays.  Its work is an\nexemplification of the living, practical Christianity of today.  In\nalmost every state in this fair land of ours can be found Odd-Fellows’\nhomes, within whose walls the orphan is no longer motherless.  For each\nand every little one within these homes, one million Odd-Fellows feel a\nfather’s love and pledge a parent’s care.",
        "Add to all this great work the little deeds of love, the little acts of\nkindness that make life beautiful; add kind words of cheer and friendly\nhelp and tender consolation, and add again the benefit of union, the\nstrength that comes from hearts united in God’s work among mankind, and\nyou have caught a glimpse of the life-giving principle that has made\nOdd-Fellowship one of the grandest fraternal and beneficiary\ninstitutions the world has ever known.  The work it has done can not be\nfully estimated until the record is read in the bright light of\neternity.  In that glad day the tears that have been wiped away will\nbecome jewels in somebody’s crown, and the sobs that have been hushed\nwill be heard again in hosannas of welcome.",
        "Onward! is the ringing, pregnant watchword of the world.  The vast,\ncomplicated, ponderous machinery of life is kept in motion by tireless\nand irresistible forces.  The multiform and magnificent affairs of men\nand of nations are all impelled forward with an energy and a velocity\nas wonderful as glorious to behold.",
        "Not retrogressive, but progressive–not enervating, but energizing–not\nephemeral, but substantial–not from bad to worse, but from the\nimperfect to the consummate, are the characteristics by which are so\nprominently distinguished the tidal waves of the world’s progress today.",
        "Activity and achievement came with creation, and constitute an\ninflexible, irrepealable law of the universe.  In stir and push we have\nlight and life, but in idleness, and superstitious clinging to\nfossilized ideas and bygones, we have demoralization, decay and death.",
        "Fortunately for the world, and agreeably with infinite design, man\nplods his way in harmony with the law alluded to.  Not all men, but the\ngreat masses of them, wherever “The true light shineth,” especially\nwhen accompanied by rays and helps from one of the noblest and grandest\nof confraternities our world has known, “The Independent Order of\nOdd-Fellows.”  When the huge planet which we call our world had been\ntossed into being from the furnace fires of Omnipotence, and the\nmaternal lullaby began to gather force on hill top and in valley, the\ndiscovery was naturally enough made that association and co-operation\nwere preferable to isolation and unrelieved dependence; and from that\nhour forward, this principle has been interwoven into the very\nframework of human society.  The purpose has been the elevation and\nimprovement of mankind.  For, though the first product was pronounced\n“good,” it quickly degenerated; and there came an emphasized demand for\nreform.",
