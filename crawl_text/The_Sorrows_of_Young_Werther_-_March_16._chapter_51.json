        "Everything conspires against me. I met Miss B— walking to-day.\nI could not help joining her; and, when we were at a little distance\nfrom her companions, I expressed my sense of her altered manner\ntoward me. “O Werther!” she said, in a tone of emotion, “you, who\nknow my heart, how could you so ill interpret my distress? What\ndid I not suffer for you, from the moment you entered the room!\nI foresaw it all, a hundred times was I on the point of mentioning\nit to you. I knew that the S—s and T—s, with their husbands,\nwould quit the room, rather than remain in your company. I knew\nthat the count would not break with them: and now so much is said\nabout it.” “How!” I exclaimed, and endeavoured to conceal my\nemotion; for all that Adelin had mentioned to me yesterday recurred\nto me painfully at that moment. “Oh, how much it has already cost\nme!” said this amiable girl, while her eyes filled with tears. I\ncould scarcely contain myself, and was ready to throw myself at\nher feet. “Explain yourself!” I cried. Tears flowed down her\ncheeks. I became quite frantic. She wiped them away, without\nattempting to conceal them. “You know my aunt,” she continued;\n“she was present: and in what light does she consider the affair!\nLast night, and this morning, Werther, I was compelled to listen\nto a lecture upon my, acquaintance with you. I have been obliged\nto hear you condemned and depreciated; and I could not — I dared\nnot — say much in your defence.”",
        "Every word she uttered was a dagger to my heart. She did not feel\nwhat a mercy it would have been to conceal everything from me.\nShe told me, in addition, all the impertinence that would be further\ncirculated, and how the malicious would triumph; how they would\nrejoice over the punishment of my pride, over my humiliation for\nthat want of esteem for others with which I had often been reproached.\nTo hear all this, Wilhelm, uttered by her in a voice of the most\nsincere sympathy, awakened all my passions; and I am still in a\nstate of extreme excitement. I wish I could find a man to jeer\nme about this event. I would sacrifice him to my resentment. The\nsight of his blood might possibly be a relief to my fury. A hundred\ntimes have I seized a dagger, to give ease to this oppressed heart.\nNaturalists tell of a noble race of horses that instinctively open\na vein with their teeth, when heated and exhausted by a long course,\nin order to breathe more freely. I am often tempted to open a\nvein, to procure for myself everlasting liberty.",
