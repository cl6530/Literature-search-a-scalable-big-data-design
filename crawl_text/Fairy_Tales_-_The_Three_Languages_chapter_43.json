        "An aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he\nwas stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: ’Hark you,\nmy son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go\nfrom hence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who\nshall see what he can do with you.’ The youth was sent into a strange\ntown, and remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this\ntime, he came home again, and his father asked: ’Now, my son, what\nhave you learnt?’ ’Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they\nbark.’ ’Lord have mercy on us!’ cried the father; ’is that all you\nhave learnt? I will send you into another town, to another master.’\nThe youth was taken thither, and stayed a year with this master\nlikewise. When he came back the father again asked: ’My son, what have\nyou learnt?’ He answered: ’Father, I have learnt what the birds say.’\nThen the father fell into a rage and said: ’Oh, you lost man, you have\nspent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to\nappear before my eyes? I will send you to a third master, but if you\nlearn nothing this time also, I will no longer be your father.’ The\nyouth remained a whole year with the third master also, and when he\ncame home again, and his father inquired: ’My son, what have you\nlearnt?’ he answered: ’Dear father, I have this year learnt what the\nfrogs croak.’ Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang\nup, called his people thither, and said: ’This man is no longer my\nson, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into the\nforest, and kill him.’ They took him forth, but when they should have\nkilled him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go, and they\ncut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry them to\nthe old man as a token.",
        "The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he\nbegged for a night’s lodging. ’Yes,’ said the lord of the castle, ’if\nyou will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I\nwarn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild\ndogs, which bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man\nhas to be given to them, whom they at once devour.’ The whole district\nwas in sorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do\nanything to stop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said:\n’Just let me go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I\ncan throw to them; they will do nothing to harm me.’ As he himself\nwould have it so, they gave him some food for the wild animals, and\nled him down to the tower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark\nat him, but wagged their tails quite amicably around him, ate what he\nset before them, and did not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning,\nto the astonishment of everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed,\nand said to the lord of the castle: ’The dogs have revealed to me, in\ntheir own language, why they dwell there, and bring evil on the land.\nThey are bewitched, and are obliged to watch over a great treasure\nwhich is below in the tower, and they can have no rest until it is\ntaken away, and I have likewise learnt, from their discourse, how that\nis to be done.’ Then all who heard this rejoiced, and the lord of the\ncastle said he would adopt him as a son if he accomplished it\nsuccessfully. He went down again, and as he knew what he had to do, he\ndid it thoroughly, and brought a chest full of gold out with him. The\nhowling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more; they had\ndisappeared, and the country was freed from the trouble.",
        "After some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome.\nOn the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were\nsitting croaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of\nwhat they were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he\narrived in Rome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great\ndoubt among the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his\nsuccessor. They at length agreed that the person should be chosen as\npope who should be distinguished by some divine and miraculous token.\nAnd just as that was decided on, the young count entered into the\nchurch, and suddenly two snow-white doves flew on his shoulders and\nremained sitting there. The ecclesiastics recognized therein the token\nfrom above, and asked him on the spot if he would be pope. He was\nundecided, and knew not if he were worthy of this, but the doves\ncounselled him to do it, and at length he said yes. Then was he\nanointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled what he had heard\nfrom the frogs on his way, which had so affected him, that he was to\nbe his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and did not know\none word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his shoulders,\nand said it all in his ear.",
