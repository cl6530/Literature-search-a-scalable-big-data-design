        "Christianity in the last three chapters has been considered on its\nnegative side as involving a conflict against temptation. But the\nChristian ideal is positive rather than negative. We have only to\nthink for a moment of the character and life of Christ in order to\nrealize how ludicrously impoverished a conception of the Gospel\nrighteousness is that which regards it as exhausted by the meticulous\navoidance of sin. “Christian purity,” it has been said, “is not a\nsnowy abstinence but a white-hot passion of life towards GOD.” The\nsame might be said of other Christian virtues. Positively regarded,\nthe Christian ideal of life means sonship towards GOD and citizenship\nin His Kingdom.",
        "The precise signification of the phrase, “Kingdom of GOD,” or “Kingdom\nof Heaven,” in the language of the New Testament has been the theme of\ncontroversy and discussion among scholars. It is impossible to enter\nhere into the technicalities of the dispute. Broadly speaking, it may\nbe laid down without much fear of contradiction that the Kingdom of\nGOD means the effectual realization, in every department of human life\nand upon a universal scale, of the sovereignty of GOD as Christ\nreveals Him. It is the vision of the goal of human history. It is\nmeant to be a leading motive and inspiration of Christian life.",
        "    “I will not cease from mental strife,\n     Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,\n     Till we have built Jerusalem\n     In England’s green and pleasant land.”",
        "It is quite true that, according to the thought of the New Testament\nwriters, the mystic Jerusalem is not a city built by mortal men upon\nthis earth, but something which is wholly the gift of GOD, a city not\nmade with hands, descending from GOD out of heaven. The Kingdom of GOD\nin its fulness is no product of human striving. It is the achievement\nof a Divine purpose, the manifestation in the end of the days of the\ncompleted mystery of the Divine Will.",
        "Nevertheless it is the mission of the Church to prepare the way of the\nKingdom, and it is for Christian men to live as sons of the Divine\nKingdom even now, that is, as men in whose hearts and lives GOD and\nnone other is enthroned as King and Lord. This means that everything\nthat is good in human life is to be redeemed by being offered to GOD,\nand that everything that is vile and evil is to be eliminated and cast\nout. “The Son of Man shall send forth His messengers, and they shall\ngather out of His Kingdom all things that offend.” “There shall in no\nwise enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh\nabomination, or maketh a lie.” “The Kingdom of GOD is righteousness\nand peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.”",
        "The ideal of the Christian life, therefore, is something infinitely\nricher and more positive than the merely negative morality of the Ten\nCommandments. It is the ideal of the Divine Kingdom. It is a positive\ndevotion to the will of GOD. It means co-operation with the Divine\nwill and purpose, a will and a purpose which, by the patient operation\nof the Divine Spirit, is in the course of world-history slowly but\nsurely being worked out, amid all the immediate chaos and welter of\nevents, to its goal in the revelation of the Jerusalem which is from\nabove. That is why the Christian is bidden to pray continually, “Thy\nKingdom come, Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.”",
        "If a man does not want the Divine Kingdom, or does not believe in it,\nhe ought not to pray for it. If he does want it and pray for it, he\nought also to work for it. And though no man may fully understand it,\nyet if a man is to pray for it and work for it at all, he needs to\nhave at least some partial understanding of what it means. It is worth\nwhile, therefore, instead of dismissing the idea as a vague dream or\nan empty phrase, to try and fill it with some measure of positive\nmeaning for us men here and now. What is the will of GOD for humanity?\nAnd what is meant by preparing the way of the Lord? Some things at\nleast we may say are certainly included in the will of GOD, and some\nthings are as certainly excluded.",
        "“It is not the will of your Father which is in heaven that one of\nthese little ones should perish.” A Christian Church which took\nseriously its vocation to go before the Lord and to prepare His ways\nwould be effectively and vigorously concerned with problems so prosaic\nas the rate of infantile mortality and the allied questions of housing\nand sanitation, with the insistence that the conditions of life among\nthe poorer classes of the community shall be such as make decent\nliving possible, and with the provision of a minimum of leisure and of\ngenuine opportunities of liberal education for all who have the will\nand the capacity to profit by them. The combined ignorance and apathy\nof the people of England with regard to questions of education, which\nhas made possible the shelving of Mr. Fisher’s Education Bill in\ndeference to the opposition of vested interests, is little to the\ncredit of the Christian Church in these islands, and grievously\ndisappointing to those who had hoped at last for a real instalment of\nconstructive reform. [Footnote: It is now stated that the Bill is to\nbe reintroduced and passed, with certain modifications. It is to be\nhoped that the modifications will not be such as to destroy its\neffectiveness as an instrument of real reform. It remains true that\nthe Bill was imperilled by the apathy and ignorance of the rank and\nfile of Churchmen and Christians generally, though it is fair to say\nthat the Bishops demonstrated unanimously in its favour.]",
        "A system of education, moreover, which was truly Christian, would\nprovide not merely for the training of mind and body, and for\ninstruction–on the basis of some inter-denominational modus vivendi\nyet to be achieved–in morality and religion. It would secure equally\nfor the children of all classes opportunities for the training of the\naesthetic faculties, for the cultivation of art and imagination, for\nthe filling of life with colour and variety and movement. The\nintolerable ugliness of the domestic architecture of our cities and\ntowns is a totally unnecessary offence to GOD and man; and the\ndrabness and monotony of the life of huge masses of the population,\nwho find in the rival attractions of the gin-palace and the cinema the\nonly means of distraction at present open to them–this also is\nsomething which cannot possibly be regarded as being in accordance\nwith the will of GOD. The redemption of society from all that at\npresent makes human life sordid or hideous is a real part of what the\nideal of the Kingdom means. It is a part of the task laid upon the\nChristian Church in preparing the way of the Lord and making straight\nHis paths.",
        "Included also in the will of GOD for humanity is the evangelization of\nthe world, the perfecting of the Church, the bringing of all nations\nand races into a spiritual unity in Christ Jesus. Christianity claims\nby its very nature to be the absolute religion: the climax and\nfulfilment of the whole process of man’s religious quest: the\nsynthetic and unifying truth, in which whatever is true and positive\nand permanently valuable in the religious systems of the non-Christian\nworld is gathered up and made complete. Of Christ it has been written\nthat “How many soever be the promises of GOD, in Him is the yea.” In\nChrist is the fulfilment of the unconscious prophecies of the\nreligions of the heathen world, nor is there any true solution of the\nproblems of comparative religion except this. The Christian Church is\nin principle and of necessity missionary, and apart from the\nvitalizing breath of the missionary spirit the life of the Church\nlanguishes and dies.",
        "But the true spirit and method of Christian missions is not a narrow\nproselytism. There are indeed things in many of the lower religions of\nthe world which are dark and evil. There are regions of the earth\nwhich are full of base and cruel and degrading superstitions, immoral\nrites and practices against which the Church of Christ can only set\nits face, and with which it can make no terms. These are works of the\ndevil which the Son of GOD was manifested to destroy. But there is\nmuch in the higher religious thought of paganism which Christ comes\nnot to destroy but to fulfil, and Christianity can fulfil and\ninterpret to the higher religions of paganism just that which is\ntruest and most positive in their own spiritual message. Conversely,\nit is probable that there are in Christianity itself elements which\nwill only be fully interpreted and understood when the spiritual\ngenius of nations at present pagan has made its proper contribution to\nChristian thought. For our own sake as well as for theirs it is\nimportant that the nations should be evangelized and brought to a\nknowledge of the truth. When we say the Lord’s Prayer we are praying,\namong other things, for the success of Christian Missions.",
        "And if Christianity contains within itself the true solution of the\nproblem of comparative religion, it contains also, in germ and\npotentiality, the solution of the problems of race and caste, and of\nthe international problem also. Not until men have learnt the secret\nof brotherhood in Christ will the white and the coloured races treat\none another as brothers. Not until the nations, as nations, are\ngenuinely Christian and have learnt, in their dealings one with\nanother, to manifest the spirit of unselfishness and love, will the\nday be in sight when they shall beat their swords into ploughshares\nand be content to learn war no more. This too, if the Gospel means\nanything at all, is part of the will of GOD for the human race. It is\npart of what is involved in the prayer, “Thy will be done in earth, as\nit is in heaven.” It is an integral and vitally important element in\nthe Christian hope of the Kingdom.",
        "The redemption of society, the evangelization of the world, the\nbringing together into the corporate wholeness of a world-wide\nCatholic Church of the fragmentary Christianity of the existing\nmultitude of sects, the elimination of war from the earth, and the\nbreaking down, as the result of a conscious realization of human unity\nin Christ, of the dividing barriers of colour and race and caste-all\nthese are essential elements in the Christian vision. The man of the\nworld may, and probably will, pronounce each and all of them to be\nchimerical, the baseless fabric of a dream. He will find no thoughtful\nman who is genuinely Christian to agree with him.",
        "For these things are, quite certainly, part of the will of GOD for\nhumanity. They are involved of necessity in any effectual realization\nin human life of the sovereignty of the Father who is revealed in\nChrist. And because GOD is GOD, the goal, for the Christian man, is\nwithin the horizon-\"The Kingdom of heaven is at hand.” In any case, be\nthe goal near or be it far off, it is as a citizen of that Kingdom,\nand of none other, that the Christian man will set himself to live. He\nwill enthrone GOD in his own heart as King and Lord, and will hold\nfast the heavenly vision which it has been given to him to see.",
        "“As we look out into the future,” says a modern writer,[Footnote: The\nRev. W. Temple, in an address delivered at Liverpool on “Problems of\nSociety” in 1912, and published by the Student Christian Movement in\nChrist and, Human Need.] “we seem to see a great army drawn from\nevery nation under heaven, from every social class, from every section\nof Christ’s Church, pledged to one thing and to one thing only-the\nestablishment of Christ’s Kingdom upon earth by His method of\nsacrifice and the application of His principle of brotherhood to every\nphase of human life. And as they labour there takes shape a world much\nlike our own, and yet how different! Still individuals and\ncommunities, but the individual always serving the community and the\ncommunity protecting the individual: still city and country life, with\nall their manifold pursuits, but no leading into captivity and no\ncomplaining in our streets: still Eastern and Western, but no grasping\nworldliness in the West, no deadening pessimism in the East: still\nricher and poorer, but no thoughtless luxury, no grinding destitution:\nstill sorrow, but no bitterness: still failure, but no oppression:\nstill priest and people, yet both alike unitedly presenting before the\nEternal Father the one unceasing sacrifice for human life in body\nbroken and blood shed: still Church and World, yet both together\ncelebrating unintermittently the one Divine Service, which is the\nservice of mankind. And in that climax of a vision, which, if we are\nfaithful, shall be prophecy, what is it that has happened?",
