        "When Charles Whitney heard Arthur was about to be married, he offered him\na place on the office staff of the Ranger-Whitney Company at fifteen\nhundred a year. “It is less than you deserve on your record,” he wrote,\n“but there is no vacancy just now, and you shall go up rapidly. I take\nthis opportunity to say that I regard your father’s will as the finest\nact of the finest man I ever knew, and that your conduct, since he left\nus, is a vindication of his wisdom. America has gone stark mad on the\nsubject of money. The day is not far distant when it has got to decide\nwhether property shall rule work or work shall rule property. Your father\nwas a courageous pioneer. All right-thinking men honor him.”",
        "This, a fortnight after his return from Europe, from marrying Janet to\nAristide, Viscount Brunais. He had yielded to his secret\nsnobbishness–Matilda thought it was her diplomacy–and had given Janet a\ndowry so extravagant that when old Saint Berthè heard the figures, he\ntook advantage of the fact that only the family lawyer was present to\npermit a gleam of nature to show through his mask of elegant indifference\nto the “coarse side of life.” Whitney had the American good sense to\ndespise his wife, his daughter, and himself for the transaction. For\nyears furious had been his protestations to his family, to his\nacquaintances, and to himself against “society,” and especially against\nthe incursions of that “worm-eaten titled crowd from the other side.” So\noften had he repeated those protests that certain phrases had become\nfixedly part of his conversation, to make the most noise when he was\nviolently agitated, as do the dead leaves of a long-withered but still\nfirmly attached bough. Thus he was regarded in Chicago as an American of\nthe old type; but being human, his strength had not been strong enough to\nresist the taint in the atmosphere he had breathed ever since he began to\nbe very rich and to keep the company of the pretentious. His originally\nsound constitution had been gradually undermined, just as “doing like\neverybody else\"–that is, everybody in his set of pirates disguised under\nmerchant flag and with a few deceptive bales of goods piled on deck–had\nundermined his originally sound business honor.",
        "Arthur answered, thanking him for the offered position, but declining it.\n“What you say about my work,” he wrote, “encourages me to ask a favor. I\nwish to be transferred from one mechanical department to another until I\nhave made the round. Then, perhaps, I may venture to ask you to renew\nyour offer.”",
        "Whitney showed this to Ross. “Now, there’s the sort of son I’d be proud\nof!” he exclaimed.",
        "Ross lifted his eyebrows. “Really!” said he. “Why?”",
        "“Because he’s a man,” retorted his father, with obvious intent of\nsatirical contrast. “Because within a year or two he’ll know the business\nfrom end to end–as his father did–as I do.”",
        "“And what good will that do him?” inquired Ross, with fine irony. “You\nknow it isn’t in the manufacturing end that the money’s made nowadays. We\ncan hire hundreds of good men to manufacture for us. I should say he’d be\nwiser were he trying to get a practical education.”",
        "“Practical!”",
        "“Precisely. Studying how to stab competitors in the back and establish\nmonopoly. As a manager, he may some day rise to ten or fifteen thousand a\nyear–unless managers’ salaries go down, as it’s likely they will. As a\nfinancier, he might rise to–to our class.”",
        "Whitney grunted, the frown of his brows and the smile on his sardonic\nmouth contradicting each other. He could not but be pleased by the\nshrewdness of his son’s criticism of his own half-sincere,\nhalf-hypocritical tribute to virtues that were on the wane; but at the\nsame time he did not like such frank expression of cynical truth from a\nson of his. Also, he at the bottom still had some of the squeamishness\nthat was born into him and trained into him in early youth; he did not\nlike to be forced squarely to face the fact that real business had been\nrelegated to the less able or less honest, while the big rewards of\nriches and respect were for the sly and stealthy. Enforcing what Ross had\nsaid, there came into his mind the reflection that he himself had just\nbribed through the Legislature, for a comparatively trifling sum, a law\nthat would swell his fortune and income within the next five years more\nthan would a lifetime of devotion to business.",
        "He would have been irritated far more deeply had he known that Arthur\nwas as well aware of the change from the old order as was Ross, and that\ndeliberately and on principle he was refusing to adapt himself to the\nnew order, the new conditions of “success.” When Arthur’s manliness\nfirst asserted itself, there was perhaps as much of vanity as of pride\nin his acceptance of the consequences of Hiram’s will. But to an\nintelligent man any environment, except one of inaction or futile\naction, soon becomes interesting; the coming of Madelene was all that\nwas needed to raise his interest to enthusiasm. He soon understood his\nfellow-workers as few of them understood themselves. Every human group,\nof whatever size or kind, is apt to think its characteristics peculiar\nto itself, when in fact they are as universal as human nature, and the\nmodifications due to the group’s environment are insignificant matters\nof mere surface. Nationality, trade, class no more affect the oneness of\nmankind than do the ocean’s surface variations of color or weather\naffect its unchangeable chemistry. Waugh, who had risen from the ranks,\nHowells, who had begun as shipping clerk, despised those above whom they\nhad risen, regarded as the peculiar weaknesses of the working classes\nsuch universal failings as prejudice, short-sightedness, and shirking.\nThey lost no opportunity to show their lack of sympathy with the class\nfrom which they had sprung and to which they still belonged in reality,\ntheir devotion to the class plutocratic to which they aspired. Arthur,\nin losing the narrowness of the class from which he had been ejected,\nlost all class narrowness. The graduates from the top have the best\nchance to graduate into the wide, wide world of human brotherhood. By an\nartificial process–by compulsion, vanity, reason, love–he became what\nMadelene was by nature. She was one of those rare human beings born with\na just and clear sense of proportion. It was thus impossible for her to\nexaggerate into importance the trivial differences of mental stature.\nShe saw that they were no greater than the differences of men’s physical\nstature, if men be compared with mountains or any other just measure of\nthe vast scale on which the universe is constructed. And so it came\nnaturally to her to appreciate that the vital differences among men are\nmatters of character and usefulness, just as among things they are\nmatters of beauty and use.",
        "Arthur’s close friend was now Laurent Tague, a young cooper–huge,\ndeep-chested, tawny, slow of body and swift of mind. They had been\nfriends as boys at school. When Arthur came home from Exeter from his\nfirst long vacation, their friendship had been renewed after a fashion,\nthen had ended abruptly in a quarrel and a pitched battle, from which\nneither had emerged victor, both leaving the battle ground exhausted and\nanguished by a humiliating sense of defeat. From that time Laurent had\nbeen a “damned mucker” to Arthur, Arthur a “stuck-up smart Alec” to\nLaurent. The renewal of the friendship dated from the accident to\nArthur’s hand; it rapidly developed as he lost the sense of patronizing\nLaurent, and as Laurent for his part lost the suspicion that Arthur was\nsecretly patronizing him. Then Arthur discovered that Lorry had, several\nyears before, sent for a catalogue of the University of Michigan, had\nselected a course leading to the B.S. degree, had bought the necessary\ntext-books, had studied as men work only at that which they love for its\nown sake and not for any advantage to be got from it. His father, a\ncaptain of volunteers in the Civil War, was killed in the Wilderness; his\nmother was a washerwoman. His father’s father–Jean Montague, the first\nblacksmith of Saint X–had shortened the family name. In those early,\nnakedly practical days, long names and difficult names, such as naturally\ndevelop among peoples of leisure, were ruthlessly taken to the chopping\nblock by a people among whom a man’s name was nothing in itself, was\nsimply a convenience for designating him. Everybody called Jean Montague\n“Jim Tague,” and pronounced the Tague in one syllable; when he finally\nacquiesced in the sensible, popular decision, from which he could not\nwell appeal, his very children were unaware that they were Montagues.",
        "Arthur told Lorry of his engagement to Madelene an hour after he told his\nmother–he and Lorry were heading a barrel as they talked. This supreme\nproof of friendship moved Laurent to give proof of appreciation. That\nevening he and Arthur took a walk to the top of Reservoir Hill, to see\nthe sun set and the moon rise. It was under the softening and expanding\ninfluence of the big, yellow moon upon the hills and valleys and ghostly\nriver that Laurent told his secret–a secret that in the mere telling,\nand still more in itself, was to have a profound influence upon the\npersons of this narrative.",
        "“When I was at school,” he began, “you may remember I used to carry the\nwashing to and fro for mother.”",
        "“Yes,” said Arthur. He remembered how he liked to slip away from home and\nhelp Lorry with the big baskets.",
        "“Well, one of the places I used to go to was old Preston Wilmot’s;\nthey had a little money left in those days and used to hire mother now\nand then.”",
        "“So the Wilmots owe her, too,” said Arthur, with a laugh. The\nuniversal indebtedness of the most aristocratic family in Saint X was\nthe town joke.",
        "Lorry smiled. “Yes, but she don’t know it,” he replied. “I used to do all\nher collecting for her. When the Wilmots quit paying, I paid for ’em–out\nof money I made at odd jobs. I paid for ’em for over two years. Then, one\nevening–Estelle Wilmot\"–Lorry paused before this name, lingered on it,\npaused after it–\"said to me–she waylaid me at the back gate–I always\nhad to go in and out by the alley way–no wash by the front gate for\nthem! Anyhow, she stopped me and said–all red and nervous–’You\nmustn’t come for the wash any more.’",
        "“’Why not?’ says I. ’Is the family complaining?’",
        "“’No,’ says she, ’but we owe you for two years.’",
        "“’What makes you think that?’ said I, astonished and pretty badly scared\nfor the minute.",
        "“’I’ve kept account,’ she said. And she was fiery red. ’I keep a list of\nall we owe, so as to have it when we’re able to pay.’”",
        "“What a woman she is!” exclaimed Arthur. “I suppose she’s putting by out\nof the profits of that little millinery store of hers to pay off the\nfamily debts. I hear she’s doing well.”",
        "“A smashing business,” replied Lorry, in a tone that made Arthur glance\nquickly at him. “But, as I was saying, I being a young fool and\nfrightened out of my wits, said to her: ’You don’t owe mother a cent,\nMiss Estelle. It’s all been settled–except a few weeks lately. I’m\ncollectin’, and I ought to know.’",
        "“I ain’t much of a hand at lying, and she saw straight through me. I\nguess what was going on in her head helped her, for she looked as if she\nwas about to faint. ’It’s mighty little for me to do, to get to see you,’\nI went on. ’It’s my only chance. Your people would never let me in at the\nfront gate. And seeing you is the only thing I care about.’ Then I set\ndown the washbasket and, being desperate, took courage and looked\nstraight at her. ’And,’ said I, ’I’ve noticed that for the last year you\nalways make a point of being on hand to give me the wash.’”",
        "Somehow a lump came in Arthur’s throat just then. He gave his\nHercules-like friend a tremendous clap on the knee. “Good for you,\nLorry!” he cried. ’That was the talk!”",
        "“It was,” replied Lorry. “Well, she got red again, where she had been\nwhite as a dogwood blossom, and she hung her head. ’You don’t deny it, do\nyou?’ said I. She didn’t make any answer. ’It wasn’t altogether to ask me\nhow I was getting on with my college course, was it, Miss Estelle?’ And\nshe said ’No’ so low that I had to guess at it.”",
        "Lorry suspended his story. He and Arthur sat looking at the moon.\nFinally Arthur asked, rather huskily, “Is that the end, Lorry?”",
        "Lorry’s keen, indolent face lit up with an absent and tender smile. “That\nwas the end of the beginning,” replied he.",
        "Arthur thrilled and resisted a feminine instinct to put his arm round his\nfriend. “I don’t know which of you is the luckier,” he said.",
        "Lorry laughed. “You’re always envying me my good disposition,” he went\non. “Now, I’ve given away the secret of it. Who isn’t happy when he’s got\nwhat he wants–heaven without the bother of dying first? I drop into her\nstore two evenings a week to see her. I can’t stay long or people would\ntalk. Then I see her now and again–other places. We have to be\ncareful–mighty careful.”",
        "“You must have been,” said Arthur. “I never heard a hint of this; and if\nanyone suspected, the whole town would be talking.”",
        "“I guess the fact that she’s a Wilmot has helped us. Who’d ever suspect a\nWilmot of such a thing?”",
        "“Why not?” said Arthur. “She couldn’t do better.”",
        "Lorry looked amused. “What’d you have said a few months ago, Ranger?”",
        "“But my father was a workingman.”",
        "“That was a long time ago,” Lorry reminded him. “That was when America\nused to be American. Anyhow, she and I don’t care, except about the\nmother. You know the old lady isn’t strong, especially the last year or\nso. It wouldn’t exactly improve her health to know there was anything\nbetween her daughter and a washerwoman’s son, a plain workingman at that.\nWe–Estelle and I–don’t want to be responsible for any harm to her.\nSo–we’re waiting.”",
        "“But there’s the old gentleman, and Arden–and Verbena!”",
        "Lorry’s cheerfulness was not ruffled by this marshaling of the full and\nformidable Wilmot array. “It’d be a pleasure to Estelle to give them a\nshock, especially Verbena. Did you ever see Verbena’s hands?”",
        "“I don’t think so,” replied Arthur; “but, of course, I’ve heard of\nthem.”",
        "“Did you know she wouldn’t even take hold of a knob to open a door, for\nfear of stretching them?”",
        "“She is a lady, sure.”",
        "“Well, Estelle’s not, thank God!” exclaimed Lorry. “She says one of her\ngrandmothers was the daughter of a fellow who kept a kind of pawn shop,\nand that she’s a case of atavism.”",
        "“But, Lorry,” said Arthur, letting his train of thought come to the\nsurface, “this ought to rouse your ambition. You could get anywhere you\nliked. To win her, I should think you’d exert yourself at the factory as\nyou did at home when you were going through Ann Arbor.”",
        "“To win her–perhaps I would,” replied Lorry. “But, you see, I’ve won\nher. I’m satisfied with my position. I make enough for us two to live on\nas well as any sensible person’d care to live. I’ve got four thousand\ndollars put by, and I’m insured for ten thousand, and mother’s got twelve\nthousand at interest that she saved out of the washing. I like to live.\nThey made me assistant foreman once, but I was no good at it. I couldn’t\n’speed’ the men. It seemed to me they got a small enough part of what\nthey earned, no matter how little they worked. Did you ever think, it\ntakes one of us only about a day to make enough barrels to pay his week’s\nwages, and that he has to donate the other five days’ work for the\nprivilege of being allowed to live? If I rose I’d be living off those\nfive days of stolen labor. Somehow I don’t fancy doing it. So I do my ten\nhours a day, and have evenings and Sundays for the things I like.”",
        "“Doesn’t Estelle try to spur you on?”",
        "“She used to, but she soon came round to my point of view. She saw what I\nmeant, and she hasn’t, any more than I, the fancy for stealing time from\nbeing somebody, to use it in making fools think and say you’re somebody,\nwhen you ain’t.”",
        "“It’d be a queer world if everybody were like you.”",
        "“It’d be a queer world if everybody were like any particular person,\"\nretorted Lorry.",
        "Arthur’s mind continually returned to this story, to revolve it, to\nfind some new suggestion as to what was stupid or savage or silly in the\npresent social system, as to what would be the social system of\nto-morrow, which is to to-day’s as to-day’s is to yesterday’s; for Lorry\nand Dr. Schulze and Madelene and his own awakened mind had lifted him\nout of the silly current notion that mankind is never going to grow any\nmore, but will wear its present suit of social clothes forever, will\nalways creep and totter and lisp, will never learn to walk and to talk.\nHe was in the habit of passing Estelle’s shop twice each day–early in\nthe morning, when she was opening, again when the day’s business was\nover; and he had often fancied he could see in her evening expression\nhow the tide of trade had gone. Now, he thought he could tell whether it\nwas to be one of Lorry’s evenings or not. He understood why she had so\neagerly taken up Henrietta Hastings’s suggestion, made probably with no\nidea that anything would come of it–Henrietta was full of schemes,\nevolved not for action, but simply to pass the time and to cause talk in\nthe town. Estelle’s shop became to him vastly different from a mere\nplace for buying and selling; and presently he was looking on the other\nside, the human side, of all the shops and businesses and material\nactivities, great and small. Just as a knowledge of botany makes every\nstep taken in the country an advance through thronging miracles, so his\nnew knowledge was transforming surroundings he had thought commonplace\ninto a garden of wonders. “How poor and tedious the life I marked out\nfor myself at college was,” he was presently thinking, “in comparison\nwith this life of realities!” He saw that Lorry, instead of being\nwithout ambitions, was inspired by the highest ambitions. “A good son, a\ngood lover, a good workman,” thought Arthur. “What more can a man be, or\naspire to be?” Before his mind’s eyes there was, clear as light, vivid\nas life, the master workman–his father. And for the first time Arthur\nwelcomed that vision, felt that he could look into Hiram’s grave, kind\neyes without flinching and without the slightest inward reservation of\nblame or reproach.",
        "It was some time before the bearing of the case of Lorry and Estelle\nupon the case of Arthur and Madelene occurred to him. Once he saw this he\ncould think of nothing else. He got Lorry’s permission to tell Madelene;\nand when she had the whole story he said, “You see its message to us?”",
        "And Madelene’s softly shining eyes showed that she did, even before her\nlips had the chance to say, “We certainly have no respectable excuse\nfor waiting.”",
        "“As soon as mother gets the office done,” suggested Arthur.",
        "On the morning after the wedding, at a quarter before seven, Arthur and\nMadelene came down the drive together to the new little house by the\ngate. And very handsome and well matched they seemed as they stood before\nher office and gazed at the sign: “Madelene Ranger, M.D.” She unlocked\nand opened the door; he followed her in. When, a moment later, he\nreappeared and went swinging down the street to his work, his expression\nwould have made you like him–and envy him. And at the window watching\nhim was Madelene. There were tears in her fine eyes, and her bosom was\nheaving in a storm of emotion. She was saying, “It almost seems wicked to\nfeel as happy as I do.”",
