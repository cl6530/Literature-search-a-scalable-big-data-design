        "\n...  Somewhere behind a screen a clock began wheezing, as though\noppressed by something, as though someone were strangling it.  After an\nunnaturally prolonged wheezing there followed a shrill, nasty, and as it\nwere unexpectedly rapid, chime—as though someone were suddenly\njumping forward.  It struck two.  I woke up, though I had indeed not been\nasleep but lying half-conscious.",
        "It was almost completely dark in the narrow, cramped, low-pitched\nroom, cumbered up with an enormous wardrobe and piles of cardboard\nboxes and all sorts of frippery and litter.  The candle end that had been\nburning on the table was going out and gave a faint flicker from time to\ntime.  In a few minutes there would be complete darkness.",
        "I was not long in coming to myself; everything came back to my mind\nat once, without an effort, as though it had been in ambush to pounce\nupon me again.  And, indeed, even while I was unconscious a point\nseemed continually to remain in my memory unforgotten, and round it\nmy dreams moved drearily.  But strange to say, everything that had\nhappened to me in that day seemed to me now, on waking, to be in the\nfar, far away past, as though I had long, long ago lived all that down.",
        "My head was full of fumes.  Something seemed to be hovering over\nme, rousing me, exciting me, and making me restless.  Misery and spite\nseemed surging up in me again and seeking an outlet.  Suddenly I saw\nbeside me two wide open eyes scrutinising me curiously and persistently. \nThe look in those eyes was coldly detached, sullen, as it were utterly\nremote; it weighed upon me.",
        "A grim idea came into my brain and passed all over my body, as a\nhorrible sensation, such as one feels when one goes into a damp and\nmouldy cellar.  There was something unnatural in those two eyes,\nbeginning to look at me only now.  I recalled, too, that during those two\nhours I had not said a single word to this creature, and had, in fact,\nconsidered it utterly superfluous; in fact, the silence had for some reason\ngratified me.  Now I suddenly realised vividly the hideous idea—\nrevolting as a spider—of vice, which, without love, grossly and shamelessly\nbegins with that in which true love finds its consummation.  For a long time\nwe gazed at each other like that, but she did not drop her eyes before mine\nand her expression did not change, so that at last I felt uncomfortable.",
        "“What is your name?” I asked abruptly, to put an end to it.",
        "“Liza,” she answered almost in a whisper, but somehow far from\ngraciously, and she turned her eyes away.",
        "I was silent.",
        "“What weather!  The snow ... it’s disgusting!” I said, almost to myself,\nputting my arm under my head despondently, and gazing at the ceiling.",
        "She made no answer.  This was horrible.",
        "“Have you always lived in Petersburg?” I asked a minute later, almost\nangrily, turning my head slightly towards her.",
        "“No.”",
        "“Where do you come from?”",
        "“From Riga,” she answered reluctantly.",
        "“Are you a German?”",
        "“No, Russian.”",
        "“Have you been here long?”",
        "“Where?”",
        "“In this house?”",
        "“A fortnight.”",
        "She spoke more and more jerkily.  The candle went out; I could no\nlonger distinguish her face.",
        "“Have you a father and mother?”",
        "“Yes ... no ... I have.”",
        "“Where are they?”",
        "“There ... in Riga.”",
        "“What are they?”",
        "“Oh, nothing.”",
        "“Nothing?  Why, what class are they?”",
        "“Tradespeople.”",
        "“Have you always lived with them?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“How old are you?”",
        "“Twenty.\"\n“Why did you leave them?”",
        "“Oh, for no reason.”",
        "That answer meant “Let me alone; I feel sick, sad.”",
        "We were silent.",
        "God knows why I did not go away.  I felt myself more and more sick and\ndreary.  The images of the previous day began of themselves, apart from\nmy will, flitting through my memory in confusion.  I suddenly recalled\nsomething I had seen that morning when, full of anxious thoughts, I was\nhurrying to the office.",
        "“I saw them carrying a coffin out yesterday and they nearly dropped\nit,” I suddenly said aloud, not that I desired to open the conversation, but\nas it were by accident.",
        "“A coffin?”",
        "“Yes, in the Haymarket; they were bringing it up out of a cellar.”",
        "“From a cellar?”",
        "“Not from a cellar, but a basement.  Oh, you know ... down below ... from\na house of ill-fame.  It was filthy all round ...  Egg-shells, litter ...\na stench.  It was loathsome.”",
        "Silence.",
        "“A nasty day to be buried,” I began, simply to avoid being silent.",
        "“Nasty, in what way?”",
        "“The snow, the wet.”  (I yawned.)",
        "“It makes no difference,” she said suddenly, after a brief silence.",
        "“No, it’s horrid.”  (I yawned again).  “The gravediggers must have sworn\nat getting drenched by the snow.  And there must have been water in the grave.”",
        "“Why water in the grave?” she asked, with a sort of curiosity, but\nspeaking even more harshly and abruptly than before. ",
        "I suddenly began to feel provoked.",
        "“Why, there must have been water at the bottom a foot deep.  You can’t\ndig a dry grave in Volkovo Cemetery.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Why?  Why, the place is waterlogged.  It’s a regular marsh.  So they\nbury them in water.  I’ve seen it myself ... many times.”",
        "(I had never seen it once, indeed I had never been in Volkovo, and had\nonly heard stories of it.)",
        "“Do you mean to say, you don’t mind how you die?”",
        "“But why should I die?” she answered, as though defending herself.",
        "“Why, some day you will die, and you will die just the same as that\ndead woman.  She was ... a girl like you.  She died of consumption.”",
        "“A wench would have died in hospital ...”  (She knows all about it\nalready: she said “wench,” not “girl.”)",
        "“She was in debt to her madam,” I retorted, more and more provoked\nby the discussion; “and went on earning money for her up to the end,\nthough she was in consumption.  Some sledge-drivers standing by were\ntalking about her to some soldiers and telling them so.  No doubt they\nknew her.  They were laughing.  They were going to meet in a pot-house\nto drink to her memory.”",
        "A great deal of this was my invention.  Silence followed, profound\nsilence.  She did not stir.",
        "“And is it better to die in a hospital?”",
        "“Isn’t it just the same?  Besides, why should I die?” she added irritably.",
        "“If not now, a little later.”",
        "“Why a little later?”",
        "“Why, indeed?  Now you are young, pretty, fresh, you fetch a high\nprice.  But after another year of this life you will be very different—you\nwill go off.”",
        "“In a year?”",
        "“Anyway, in a year you will be worth less,” I continued malignantly. \n“You will go from here to something lower, another house; a year later—\nto a third, lower and lower, and in seven years you will come to a\nbasement in the Haymarket.  That will be if you were lucky.  But it would\nbe much worse if you got some disease, consumption, say ... and caught\na chill, or something or other.  It’s not easy to get over an illness in your\nway of life.  If you catch anything you may not get rid of it.  And so you\nwould die.”",
        "“Oh, well, then I shall die,” she answered, quite vindictively, and she\nmade a quick movement.",
        "“But one is sorry.”",
        "“Sorry for whom?”",
        "“Sorry for life.\"\nSilence.",
        "“Have you been engaged to be married?  Eh?”",
        "“What’s that to you?”",
        "“Oh, I am not cross-examining you.  It’s nothing to me.  Why are you\nso cross?  Of course you may have had your own troubles.  What is it to\nme?  It’s simply that I felt sorry.”",
        "“Sorry for whom?”",
        "“Sorry for you.”",
        "“No need,” she whispered hardly audibly, and again made a faint movement.",
        "That incensed me at once.  What!  I was so gentle with her, and she ....",
        "“Why, do you think that you are on the right path?”",
        "“I don’t think anything.”",
        "“That’s what’s wrong, that you don’t think.  Realise it while there is still\ntime.  There still is time.  You are still young, good-looking; you might\nlove, be married, be happy ....”",
        "“Not all married women are happy,” she snapped out in the rude\nabrupt tone she had used at first.",
        "“Not all, of course, but anyway it is much better than the life here. \nInfinitely better.  Besides, with love one can live even without happiness. \nEven in sorrow life is sweet; life is sweet, however one lives.  But here what\nis there but ... foulness?  Phew!”",
        "I turned away with disgust; I was no longer reasoning coldly.  I began to\nfeel myself what I was saying and warmed to the subject.  I was already\nlonging to expound the cherished ideas I had brooded over in my corner. \nSomething suddenly flared up in me.  An object had appeared before me.",
        "“Never mind my being here, I am not an example for you.  I am,\nperhaps, worse than you are.  I was drunk when I came here, though,” I\nhastened, however, to say in self-defence.  “Besides, a man is no example\nfor a woman.  It’s a different thing.  I may degrade and defile myself, but I\nam not anyone’s slave.  I come and go, and that’s an end of it.  I shake it off,\nand I am a different man.  But you are a slave from the start.  Yes, a slave!\nYou give up everything, your whole freedom.  If you want to break your\nchains afterwards, you won’t be able to; you will be more and more fast in\nthe snares.  It is an accursed bondage.  I know it.  I won’t speak of anything\nelse, maybe you won’t understand, but tell me: no doubt you are in debt\nto your madam?  There, you see,” I added, though she made no answer,\nbut only listened in silence, entirely absorbed, “that’s a bondage for you!\nYou will never buy your freedom.  They will see to that.  It’s like selling\nyour soul to the devil ....  And besides ... perhaps, I too, am just as\nunlucky—how do you know—and wallow in the mud on purpose, out of\nmisery?  You know, men take to drink from grief; well, maybe I am here\nfrom grief.  Come, tell me, what is there good here?  Here you and I ...\ncame together ... just now and did not say one word to one another all\nthe time, and it was only afterwards you began staring at me like a wild\ncreature, and I at you.  Is that loving?  Is that how one human being\nshould meet another?  It’s hideous, that’s what it is!”",
        "“Yes!” she assented sharply and hurriedly.",
        "I was positively astounded by the promptitude of this “Yes.”  So the\nsame thought may have been straying through her mind when she was\nstaring at me just before.  So she, too, was capable of certain thoughts?\n“Damn it all, this was interesting, this was a point of likeness!” I thought,\nalmost rubbing my hands.  And indeed it’s easy to turn a young soul\nlike that!",
        "It was the exercise of my power that attracted me most.",
        "She turned her head nearer to me, and it seemed to me in the darkness\nthat she propped herself on her arm.  Perhaps she was scrutinising me. \nHow I regretted that I could not see her eyes.  I heard her deep breathing.",
        "“Why have you come here?” I asked her, with a note of authority\nalready in my voice.",
        "“Oh, I don’t know.”",
        "“But how nice it would be to be living in your father’s house!  It’s warm\nand free; you have a home of your own.”",
        "“But what if it’s worse than this?”",
        "“I must take the right tone,” flashed through my mind.  “I may not get\nfar with sentimentality.”  But it was only a momentary thought.  I swear\nshe really did interest me.  Besides, I was exhausted and moody.  And\ncunning so easily goes hand-in-hand with feeling.",
        "“Who denies it!” I hastened to answer.  “Anything may happen.  I am\nconvinced that someone has wronged you, and that you are more sinned\nagainst than sinning.  Of course, I know nothing of your story, but it’s not\nlikely a girl like you has come here of her own inclination ....”",
        "“A girl like me?” she whispered, hardly audibly; but I heard it.",
        "Damn it all, I was flattering her.  That was horrid.  But perhaps it was a\ngood thing ....  She was silent.",
        "“See, Liza, I will tell you about myself.  If I had had a home from\nchildhood, I shouldn’t be what I am now.  I often think that.  However bad\nit may be at home, anyway they are your father and mother, and not\nenemies, strangers.  Once a year at least, they’ll show their love of you. \nAnyway, you know you are at home.  I grew up without a home; and\nperhaps that’s why I’ve turned so ... unfeeling.”",
        "I waited again.  “Perhaps she doesn’t understand,” I thought, “and,\nindeed, it is absurd—it’s moralising.”",
        "“If I were a father and had a daughter, I believe I should love my\ndaughter more than my sons, really,” I began indirectly, as though talking\nof something else, to distract her attention.  I must confess I blushed.",
        "“Why so?” she asked.",
        "Ah!  so she was listening!",
        "“I don’t know, Liza.  I knew a father who was a stern, austere man, but\nused to go down on his knees to his daughter, used to kiss her hands, her\nfeet, he couldn’t make enough of her, really.  When she danced at parties\nhe used to stand for five hours at a stretch, gazing at her.  He was mad over\nher: I understand that!  She would fall asleep tired at night, and he would\nwake to kiss her in her sleep and make the sign of the cross over her.  He\nwould go about in a dirty old coat, he was stingy to everyone else, but\nwould spend his last penny for her, giving her expensive presents, and it\nwas his greatest delight when she was pleased with what he gave her. \nFathers always love their daughters more than the mothers do.  Some girls\nlive happily at home!  And I believe I should never let my daughters marry.”",
        "“What next?” she said, with a faint smile.",
        "“I should be jealous, I really should.  To think that she should kiss\nanyone else!  That she should love a stranger more than her father!  It’s\npainful to imagine it.  Of course, that’s all nonsense, of course every\nfather would be reasonable at last.  But I believe before I should let her\nmarry, I should worry myself to death; I should find fault with all her\nsuitors.  But I should end by letting her marry whom she herself loved. \nThe one whom the daughter loves always seems the worst to the father,\nyou know.  That is always so.  So many family troubles come from that.”",
        "“Some are glad to sell their daughters, rather than marrying\nthem honourably.”",
        "Ah, so that was it!",
        "“Such a thing, Liza, happens in those accursed families in which\nthere is neither love nor God,” I retorted warmly, “and where there is no\nlove, there is no sense either.  There are such families, it’s true, but I am\nnot speaking of them.  You must have seen wickedness in your own\nfamily, if you talk like that.  Truly, you must have been unlucky.  H’m! ...\nthat sort of thing mostly comes about through poverty.”",
        "“And is it any better with the gentry?  Even among the poor, honest\npeople who live happily?”",
        "“H’m ... yes.  Perhaps.  Another thing, Liza, man is fond of reckoning\nup his troubles, but does not count his joys.  If he counted them up as he\nought, he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it. \nAnd what if all goes well with the family, if the blessing of God is upon it,\nif the husband is a good one, loves you, cherishes you, never leaves you!\nThere is happiness in such a family!  Even sometimes there is happiness\nin the midst of sorrow; and indeed sorrow is everywhere.  If you marry YOU\nWILL FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF.  But think of the first years of married life with\none you love: what happiness, what happiness there sometimes is in it!\nAnd indeed it’s the ordinary thing.  In those early days even quarrels with\none’s husband end happily.  Some women get up quarrels with their\nhusbands just because they love them.  Indeed, I knew a woman like that:\nshe seemed to say that because she loved him, she would torment him\nand make him feel it.  You know that you may torment a man on purpose\nthrough love.  Women are particularly given to that, thinking to themselves\n’I will love him so, I will make so much of him afterwards, that it’s\nno sin to torment him a little now.’ And all in the  house rejoice in the\nsight of you, and you are happy and gay and peaceful and honourable ....\nThen there are some women who are jealous.  If he went off\nanywhere—I knew one such woman, she couldn’t restrain herself, but\nwould jump up at night and run off on the sly to find out where he was,\nwhether he was with some other woman.  That’s a pity.  And the woman\nknows herself it’s wrong, and her heart fails her and she suffers, but she\nloves—it’s all through love.  And how sweet it is to make up after quarrels,\nto own herself in the wrong or to forgive him!  And they both are so happy\nall at once—as though they had met anew, been married over again; as\nthough their love had begun afresh.  And no one, no one should know\nwhat passes between husband and wife if they love one another.  And\nwhatever quarrels there may be between them they ought not to call in\ntheir own mother to judge between them and tell tales of one another. \nThey are their own judges.  Love is a holy mystery and ought to be hidden\nfrom all other eyes, whatever happens.  That makes it holier and better. \nThey respect one another more, and much is built on respect.  And if\nonce there has been love, if they have been married for love, why should\nlove pass away?  Surely one can keep it!  It is rare that one cannot keep it. \nAnd if the husband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last?\nThe first phase of married love will pass, it is true, but then there will\ncome a love that is better still.  Then there will be the union of souls, they\nwill have everything in common, there will be no secrets between them. \nAnd once they have children, the most difficult times will seem to them\nhappy, so long as there is love and courage.  Even toil will be a joy, you\nmay deny yourself bread for your children and even that will be a joy,\nThey will love you for it afterwards; so you are laying by for your future. \nAs the children grow up you feel that you are an example, a support for\nthem; that even after you die your children will always keep your\nthoughts and feelings, because they have received them from you, they\nwill take on your semblance and likeness.  So you see this is a great duty. \nHow can it fail to draw the father and mother nearer?  People say it’s a trial\nto have children.  Who says that?  It is heavenly happiness!  Are you fond of\nlittle children, Liza?  I am awfully fond of them.  You know—a little rosy\nbaby boy at your bosom, and what husband’s heart is not touched, seeing\nhis wife nursing his child!  A plump little rosy baby, sprawling and\nsnuggling, chubby little hands and feet, clean tiny little nails, so tiny that\nit makes one laugh to look at them; eyes that look as if they understand\neverything.  And while it sucks it clutches at your bosom with its little\nhand, plays.  When its father comes up, the child tears itself away from the\nbosom, flings itself back, looks at its father, laughs, as though it were\nfearfully funny, and falls to sucking again.  Or it will bite its mother’s\nbreast when its little teeth are coming, while it looks sideways at her with\nits little eyes as though to say, ’Look, I am biting!’ Is not all that happiness\nwhen they are the three together, husband, wife and child?  One can\nforgive a great deal for the sake of such moments.  Yes, Liza, one must first\nlearn to live oneself before one blames others!”",
        "“It’s by pictures, pictures like that one must get at you,” I thought to\nmyself, though I did speak with real feeling, and all at once I flushed\ncrimson.  “What if she were suddenly to burst out laughing, what should I\ndo then?” That idea drove me to fury.  Towards the end of my speech I\nreally was excited, and now my vanity was somehow wounded.  The\nsilence continued.  I almost nudged her.",
        "“Why are you—” she began and stopped.  But I understood: there\nwas a quiver of something different in her voice, not abrupt, harsh and\nunyielding as before, but something soft and shamefaced, so shamefaced\nthat I suddenly felt ashamed and guilty.",
        "“What?” I asked, with tender curiosity.",
        "“Why, you ...”",
        "“What?”",
        "“Why, you ... speak somehow like a book,” she said, and again there\nwas a note of irony in her voice.",
        "That remark sent a pang to my heart.  It was not what I was expecting.",
        "I did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony,\nthat this is usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people\nwhen the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded, and\nthat their pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment\nand shrink from giving expression to their feelings before you.  I ought\nto have guessed the truth from the timidity with which she had repeatedly\napproached her sarcasm, only bringing herself to utter it at last\nwith an effort.  But I did not guess, and an evil feeling took possession\nof me.",
        "“Wait a bit!” I thought.",
