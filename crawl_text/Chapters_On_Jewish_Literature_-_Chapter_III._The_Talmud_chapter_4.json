        "     The Amoraim compile the Palestinian Talmud and the Babylonian\n     Talmud.–Representative Amoraim:\n       I (220-280) Palestine–Jochanan, Simon, Joshua, Simlai;\n          Babylonia–Rab and Samuel.\n      II (280-320) Palestine–Ami, Assi, Abbahu, Chiya;\n          Babylonia–Huna and Zeira.\n     III (320-380) Babylonia–Rabba, Abayi, Rava.\n      IV (380-430) Babylonia–Ashi (first compilation of the\n          Babylonian Talmud).\n       V and VI (430-500) Babylonia–Rabina (completion of the\n          Babylonian Talmud).",
        "The Talmud, or Gemara (\"Doctrine,” or “Completion”), was a natural\ndevelopment of the Mishnah. The Talmud contains, indeed, many elements\nas old as the Mishnah, some even older. But, considered as a whole, the\nTalmud is a commentary on the work of the Tannaim. It is written, not in\nHebrew, as the Mishnah is, but in a popular Aramaic. There are two\ndistinct works to which the title Talmud is applied; the one is the\nJerusalem Talmud (completed about the year 370 C.E.), the other the\nBabylonian (completed a century later). At first, as we have seen, the\nRabbinical schools were founded on Jewish soil. But Palestine did not\ncontinue to offer a friendly welcome. Under the more tolerant rulers of\nBabylonia or Persia, Jewish learning found a refuge from the harshness\nexperienced under those of the Holy Land. The Babylonian Jewish schools\nin Nehardea, Sura, and Pumbeditha rapidly surpassed the Palestinian in\nreputation, and in the year 350 C.E., owing to natural decay, the\nPalestinian schools closed.",
        "The Talmud is accordingly not one work, but two, the one the literary\nproduct of the Palestinian, the other, of the Babylonian Amoraim. The\nlatter is the larger, the more studied, the better preserved, and to it\nattention will here be mainly confined. The Talmud is not a book, it is\na literature. It contains a legal code, a system of ethics, a body of\nritual customs, poetical passages, prayers, histories, facts of science\nand medicine, and fancies of folk-lore.",
        "The Amoraim were what their name implies, “Expounders,” or\n“Discoursers\"; but their expositions were often original contributions\nto literature. Their work extends over the long interval between 200 and\n500 C.E. The Amoraim naturally were men of various character and\ncondition. Some were possessed of much material wealth, others were\nexcessively poor. But few of them were professional men of letters. Like\nthe Tannaim, the Amoraim were often artisans, field-laborers, or\nphysicians, whose heart was certainly in literature, but whose hand was\nturned to the practical affairs of life. The men who stood highest\nsocially, the Princes of the Captivity in Babylonia and the Patriarchs\nin Palestine, were not always those vested with the highest authority.\nSome of the Amoraim, again, were merely receptive, the medium through\nwhich tradition was handed on; others were creative as well. To put the\nsame fact in Rabbinical metaphor, some were Sinais of learning, others\ntore up mountains, and ground them together in keen and critical\ndialectics.",
        "The oldest of the Amoraim, Chanina, the son of Chama, of Sepphoris\n(180-260), was such a firm mountain of ancient learning. On the other\nhand, Jochanan, the son of Napacha (199-279), of dazzling physical\nbeauty, had a more original mind. His personal charms conveyed to him\nperhaps a sense of the artistic; to him the Greek language was a\ndelight, “an ornament of women.” Simon, the son of Lakish (200-275),\nhardy of muscle and of intellect, started life as a professional\nathlete. A later Rabbi, Zeira, was equally noted for his feeble,\nunprepossessing figure and his nimble, ingenious mind. Another\ncontemporary of Jochanan, Joshua, the son of Levi, is the hero of many\nlegends. He was so tender to the poor that he declared his conviction\nthat the Messiah would arise among the beggars and cripples of Rome.\nSimlai, who was born in Palestine, and migrated to Nehardea in\nBabylonia, was more of a poet than a lawyer. His love was for the\nethical and poetic elements of the Talmud, the Hagadah, as this aspect\nof the Rabbinical literature was called in contradistinction to the\nHalachah, or legal elements. Simlai entered into frequent discussions\nwith the Christian Fathers on subjects of Biblical exegesis.",
        "The centre of interest now changes to Babylonia. Here, in the year 219,\nAbba Areka, or Rab (175-247), founded the Sura academy, which continued\nto flourish for nearly eight centuries. He and his great contemporary\nSamuel (180-257) enjoy with Jochanan the honor of supplying the leading\nmaterials of which the Talmud consists. Samuel laid down a rule which,\nbased on an utterance of the prophet Jeremiah, enabled Jews to live and\nserve in non-Jewish countries. “The law of the land is law,” said\nSamuel. But he lived in the realms of the stars as well as in the\nstreets of his city. Samuel was an astronomer, and he is reported to\nhave boasted with truth, that “he was as familiar with the paths of the\nstars as with the streets of Nehardea.” He arranged the Jewish Calendar,\nhis work in this direction being perfected by Hillel II in the fourth\ncentury. Like Simlai, Rab and Samuel had heathen and Christian friends.\nOrigen and Jerome read the Scriptures under the guidance of Jews. The\nheathen philosopher Porphyry wrote a commentary on the Book of Daniel.\nSo, too, Abbahu, who lived in Palestine a little later on, frequented\nthe society of cultivated Romans, and had his family taught Greek.\nAbbahu was a manufacturer of veils for women’s wear, for, like many\nAmoraim, he scorned to make learning a means of living, Abbahu’s modesty\nwith regard to his own merits shows that a Rabbi was not necessarily\narrogant in pride of knowledge! Once Abbahu’s lecture was besieged by a\ngreat crowd, but the audience of his colleague Chiya was scanty. “Thy\nteaching,” said Abbahu to Chiya, “is a rare jewel, of which only an\nexpert can judge; mine is tinsel, which attracts every ignorant eye.”",
        "It was Rab, however, who was the real popularizer of Jewish learning. He\narranged courses of lectures for the people as well as for scholars.\nRab’s successor as head of the Sura school, Huna (212-297), completed\nRab’s work in making Babylonia the chief centre of Jewish learning. Huna\ntilled his own fields for a living, and might often be met going home\nwith his spade over his shoulder. It was men like this who built up the\nJewish tradition. Huna’s predecessor, however, had wider experience of\nlife, for Rab had been a student in Palestine, and was in touch with the\nJews of many parts. From Rab’s time onwards, learning became the\nproperty of the whole people, and the Talmud, besides being the\nliterature of the Jewish universities, may be called the book of the\nmasses. It contains, not only the legal and ethical results of the\ninvestigations of the learned, but also the wisdom and superstition of\nthe masses. The Talmud is not exactly a national literature, but it was\na unique bond between the scattered Jews, an unparallelled spiritual and\nliterary instrument for maintaining the identity of Judaism amid the\nmany tribulations to which the Jews were subjected.",
        "The Talmud owed much to many minds. Externally it was influenced by the\nnations with which the Jews came into contact. From the inside, the\ninfluences at work were equally various. Jochanan, Rab, and Samuel in\nthe third century prepared the material out of which the Talmud was\nfinally built. The actual building was done by scholars in the fourth\ncentury. Rabba, the son of Nachmani (270-330), Abayi (280-338), and Rava\n(299-352) gave the finishing touches to the method of the Talmud. Rabba\nwas a man of the people; he was a clear thinker, and loved to attract\nall comers by an apt anecdote. Rava had a superior sense of his own\ndignity, and rather neglected the needs of the ordinary man of his day.\nAbayi was more of the type of the average Rabbi, acute, genial,\nself-denying. Under the impulse of men of the most various gifts of mind\nand heart, the Talmud was gradually constructed, but two names are\nprominently associated with its actual compilation. These were Ashi\n(352-427) and Rabina (died 499). Ashi combined massive learning with\nkeen logical ingenuity. He needed both for the task to which he devoted\nhalf a century of his life. He possessed a vast memory, in which the\naccumulated tradition of six centuries was stored, and he was gifted\nwith the mental orderliness which empowered him to deal with this\nbewildering mass of materials.",
        "It is hardly possible that after the compilation of the Talmud it\nremained an oral book, though it must be remembered that memory played a\nmuch greater part in earlier centuries than it does now. At all events,\nAshi, and after him Rabina, performed the great work of systematizing\nthe Rabbinical literature at a turning-point in the world’s history. The\nMishnah had been begun at a moment when the Roman empire was at its\ngreatest vigor and glory; the Talmud was completed at the time when the\nRoman empire was in its decay. That the Jews were saved from similar\ndisintegration, was due very largely to the Talmud. The Talmud is thus\none of the great books of the world. Despite its faults, its excessive\ncasuistry, its lack of style and form, its stupendous mass of detailed\nlaws and restrictions, it is nevertheless a great book in and for\nitself. It is impossible to consider it further here in its religious\naspects. But something must be said in the next chapter of that side of\nthe Rabbinical literature known as the Midrash.",
