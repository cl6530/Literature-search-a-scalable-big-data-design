        "Boys delight in men who have had adventures, and when they are\nprivileged to read of such exploits in thrilling story form, that is the\n\"seventh heaven” for them. Such a “boys’ man” was Jack London, whose\nwhole life was one of stirring action on land and sea. Gifted as a story\nteller, he wrote books almost without end. Some of them, “The Call of\nthe Wild,” “The Sea Wolf” and “White Fang,” have already been recognized\nas fine books for boys. Others, volumes of short stories, contain many\nof like interest, possessing the same qualities that have made the other\nand longer stories so acceptable as juveniles.",
        "Effort has been made by the editor to bring together in one volume a\nnumber of such stories, not for the reason alone that there might be\nanother Jack London book for boys, but also in order to add to our\njuvenile literature a volume likely “to be chewed and digested,” as\nBacon says, a book worthy “to be read whole, and with diligence and\nattention.” For my belief is that boys read altogether too few of such\nbooks. Or perhaps it would be more correct to say, have too few\nopportunities to read such books, because so often we fail to see how\nquick in their reading their minds are to grasp the more difficult, and\nhow keen and competent their conscience to draw the right conclusion\nwhen situations are presented wherein men err so grievously.",
        "It is hoped the stories presented will serve to exercise both the boy’s\nmind and conscience; that seeing and feeling life and nature as Jack\nLondon saw and felt it–the best and the worst in human nature, with the\nInfinite always near and from whom there is no escape–seeing and\nfeeling such things boys will develop the emotional muscles of the\nspirit, have opened up new windows to their imaginations, and withal add\nsome line or color to their life’s ideals.",

        "She had delayed, because of the dew-wet grass, in order to put on her\novershoes, and when she emerged from the house found her waiting husband\nabsorbed in the wonder of a bursting almond-bud. She sent a questing\nglance across the tall grass and in and out among the orchard trees.",
        "“Where’s Wolf?” she asked.",
        "“He was here a moment ago.” Walt Irvine drew himself away with a jerk\nfrom the metaphysics and poetry of the organic miracle of blossom, and\nsurveyed the landscape. “He was running a rabbit the last I saw of him.”",
        "“Wolf! Wolf! Here, Wolf!” she called, as they left the clearing and took\nthe trail that led down through the waxen-belled manzanita jungle to\nthe county road.",
        "Irvine thrust between his lips the little finger of each hand and lent\nto her efforts a shrill whistling.",
        "She covered her ears hastily and made a wry grimace.",
        "“My! for a poet, delicately attuned and all the rest of it, you can make\nunlovely noises. My eardrums are pierced. You outwhistle––”",
        "“Orpheus.”",
        "“I was about to say a street-arab,” she concluded severely.",
        "“Poesy does not prevent one from being practical–at least it doesn’t\nprevent me. Mine is no futility of genius that can’t sell gems to the\nmagazines.”",
        "He assumed a mock extravagance, and went on:",
        "“I am no attic singer, no ballroom warbler. And why? Because I am\npractical. Mine is no squalor of song that cannot transmute itself, with\nproper exchange value, into a flower-crowned cottage, a sweet\nmountain-meadow, a grove of redwoods, an orchard of thirty-seven trees,\none long row of blackberries and two short rows of strawberries, to say\nnothing of a quarter of a mile of gurgling brook.”",
        "“Oh, that all your song-transmutations were as successful!” she laughed.",
        "“Name one that wasn’t.”",
        "“Those two beautiful sonnets that you transmuted into the cow that was\naccounted the worst milker in the township.”",
        "“She was beautiful––” he began.",
        "“But she didn’t give milk,” Madge interrupted.",
        "“But she was beautiful, now, wasn’t she?” he insisted.",
        "“And here’s where beauty and utility fall out,” was her reply. “And\nthere’s the Wolf!”",
        "From the thicket-covered hillside came a crashing of underbrush, and\nthen, forty feet above them, on the edge of the sheer wall of rock,\nappeared a wolf’s head and shoulders. His braced forepaws dislodged a\npebble, and with sharp-pricked ears and peering eyes he watched the fall\nof the pebble till it struck at their feet. Then he transferred his gaze\nand with open mouth laughed down at them.",
        "“You Wolf, you!” and “You blessed Wolf!” the man and woman called out to\nhim. The ears flattened back and down at the sound, and the head seemed\nto snuggle under the caress of an invisible hand.",
        "They watched him scramble backward into the thicket, then proceeded on\ntheir way. Several minutes later, rounding a turn in the trail where the\ndescent was less precipitous, he joined them in the midst of a miniature\navalanche of pebbles and loose soil. He was not demonstrative. A pat and\na rub around the ears from the man, and a more prolonged caressing from\nthe woman, and he was away down the trail in front of them, gliding\neffortlessly over the ground in true wolf fashion.",
        "In build and coat and brush he was a huge timber-wolf; but the lie was\ngiven to his wolf-hood by his color and marking. There the dog\nunmistakably advertised itself. No wolf was ever colored like him. He\nwas brown, deep brown, red-brown, an orgy of browns. Back and shoulders\nwere a warm brown that paled on the sides and underneath to a yellow\nthat was dingy because of the brown that lingered in it. The white of\nthe throat and paws and the spots over the eyes was dirty because of the\npersistent and ineradicable brown, while the eyes themselves were twin\ntopazes, golden and brown.",
        "The man and woman loved the dog very much; perhaps this was because it\nhad been such a task to win his love. It had been no easy matter when he\nfirst drifted in mysteriously out of nowhere to their little mountain\ncottage. Footsore and famished, he had killed a rabbit under their very\nnoses and under their very windows, and then crawled away and slept by\nthe spring at the foot of the blackberry bushes. When Walt Irvine went\ndown to inspect the intruder, he was snarled at for his pains, and Madge\nlikewise was snarled at when she went down to present, as a\npeace-offering, a large pan of bread and milk.",
        "A most unsociable dog he proved to be, resenting all their advances,\nrefusing to let them lay hands on him, menacing them with bared fangs\nand bristling hair. Nevertheless he remained, sleeping and resting by\nthe spring, and eating the food they gave him after they set it down at\na safe distance and retreated. His wretched physical condition explained\nwhy he lingered; and when he had recuperated, after several days’\nsojourn, he disappeared.",
        "And this would have been the end of him, so far as Irvine and his wife\nwere concerned, had not Irvine at that particular time been called away\ninto the northern part of the state. Biding along on the train, near to\nthe line between California and Oregon, he chanced to look out of the\nwindow and saw his unsociable guest sliding along the wagon road, brown\nand wolfish, tired yet tireless, dust-covered and soiled with two\nhundred miles of travel.",
        "Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet. He got off the train at the\nnext station, bought a piece of meat at a butcher shop, and captured the\nvagrant on the outskirts of the town. The return trip was made in the\nbaggage car, and so Wolf came a second time to the mountain cottage.\nHere he was tied up for a week and made love to by the man and woman.\nBut it was very circumspect love-making. Remote and alien as a traveller\nfrom another planet, he snarled down their soft-spoken love-words. He\nnever barked. In all the time they had him he was never known to bark.",
        "To win him became a problem. Irvine liked problems. He had a metal plate\nmade, on which was stamped: “Return to Walt Irvine, Glen Ellen, Sonoma\nCounty, California.” This was riveted to a collar and strapped about the\ndog’s neck. Then he was turned loose, and promptly He disappeared. A\nday later came a telegram from Mendocino County. In twenty hours he had\nmade over a hundred miles to the north, and was still going when\ncaptured.",
        "He came back by Wells Fargo Express, was tied up three days, and was\nloosed on the fourth and lost. This time he gained southern Oregon\nbefore he was caught and returned. Always, as soon as he received his\nliberty, he fled away, and always he fled north. He was possessed of an\nobsession that drove him north. The homing instinct, Irvine called it,\nafter he had expended the selling price of a sonnet in getting the\nanimal back from northern Oregon.",
        "Another time the brown wanderer succeeded in traversing half the length\nof California, all of Oregon, and most of Washington, before he was\npicked up and returned “Collect.” A remarkable thing was the speed with\nwhich he traveled. Fed up and rested, as soon as he was loosed he\ndevoted all his energy to getting over the ground. On the first day’s\nrun he was known to cover as high as a hundred and fifty miles, and\nafter that he would average a hundred miles a day until caught. He\nalways arrived back lean and hungry and savage, and always departed\nfresh and vigorous, cleaving his way northward in response to some\nprompting of his being that no one could understand.",
        "But at last, after a futile year of flight, he accepted the inevitable\nand elected to remain at the cottage where first he had killed the\nrabbit and slept by the spring. Even after that, a long time elapsed\nbefore the man and woman succeeded in patting him. It was a great\nvictory, for they alone were allowed to put hands on him. He was\nfastidiously exclusive, and no guest at the cottage ever succeeded in\nmaking up to him. A low growl greeted such approach; if any one had the\nhardihood to come nearer, the lips lifted, the naked fangs appeared, and\nthe growl became a snarl–a snarl so terrible and malignant that it awed\nthe stoutest of them, as it likewise awed the farmers’ dogs that knew\nordinary dog snarling, but had never seen wolf snarling before.",
        "He was without antecedents. His history began with Walt and Madge. He\nhad come up from the south, but never a clew did they get of the owner\nfrom whom he had evidently fled. Mrs. Johnson, their nearest neighbor\nand the one who supplied them with milk, proclaimed him a Klondike dog.\nHer brother was burrowing for frozen pay-streaks in that far country,\nand so she constituted herself an authority on the subject.",
        "But they did not dispute her. There were the tips of Wolf’s ears,\nobviously so severely frozen at some time that they would never quite\nheal again. Besides, he looked like the photographs of the Alaskan dogs\nthey saw published in magazines and newspapers. They often speculated\nover his past, and tried to conjure up (from what they had read and\nheard) what his northland life had been. That the northland still drew\nhim, they knew; for at night they sometimes heard him crying softly; and\nwhen the north wind blew and the bite of frost was in the air, a great\nrestlessness would come upon him and he would lift a mournful lament\nwhich they knew to be the long wolf-howl. Yet he never barked. No\nprovocation was great enough to draw from him that canine cry.",
        "Long discussion they had, during the time of winning him, as to whose\ndog he was. Each claimed him, and each proclaimed loudly any expression\nof affection made by him. But the man had the better of it at first,\nchiefly because he was a man. It was patent that Wolf had had no\nexperience with women. He did not understand women. Madge’s skirts were\nsomething he never quite accepted. The swish of them was enough to set\nhim a-bristle with suspicion, and on a windy day she could not approach\nhim at all.",
        "On the other hand, it was Madge who fed him; also it was she who ruled\nthe kitchen, and it was by her favor, and her favor alone, that he was\npermitted to come within that sacred precinct. It was because of these\nthings that she bade fair to overcome the handicap of her garments. Then\nit was that Walt put forth special effort, making it a practice to have\nWolf lie at his feet while he wrote, and, between petting and talking,\nlosing much time from his work. Walt won in the end, and his victory was\nmost probably due to the fact that he was a man, though Madge averred\nthat they would have had another quarter of a mile of gurgling brook,\nand at least two west winds sighing through their redwoods, had Walt\nproperly devoted his energies to song-transmutation and left Wolf alone\nto exercise a natural taste and an unbiased judgment.",
        "“It’s about time I heard from those triolets,” Walt said, after a\nsilence of five minutes, during which they had swung steadily down the\ntrail. “There’ll be a check at the post office, I know, and we’ll\ntransmute it into beautiful buckwheat flour, a gallon of maple syrup,\nand a new pair of overshoes for you.”",
        "“And into beautiful milk from Mrs. Johnson’s beautiful cow,” Madge\nadded. “To-morrow’s the first of the month, you know.”",
        "Walt scowled unconsciously; then his face brightened, and he clapped his\nhand to his breast pocket.",
        "“Never mind. I have here a nice, beautiful, new cow, the best milker in\nCalifornia.”",
        "“When did you write it?” she demanded eagerly. Then, reproachfully, “And\nyou never showed it to me.”",
        "“I saved it to read to you on the way to the post office, in a spot\nremarkably like this one,” he answered, indicating, with a wave of his\nhand, a dry log on which to sit.",
        "A tiny stream flowed out of a dense fern-brake, slipped down a\nmossy-lipped stone, and ran across the path at their feet. From the\nvalley arose the mellow song of meadow larks, while about them, in and\nout, through sunshine and shadow, fluttered great yellow butterflies.",
        "Up from below came another sound that broke in upon Walt reading softly\nfrom his manuscript. It was a crunching of heavy feet, punctuated now\nand again by the clattering of a displaced stone. As Walt finished and\nlooked to his wife for approval, a man came into view around the turn of\nthe trail. He was bareheaded and sweaty. With a handkerchief in one hand\nhe mopped his face, while in the other hand he carried a new hat and a\nwilted starched collar which he had removed from his neck. He was a\nwell-built man, and his muscles seemed on the point of bursting out of\nthe painfully new and ready-made black clothes he wore.",
        "“Warm day,” Walt greeted him. Walt believed in country democracy, and\nnever missed an opportunity to practice it.",
        "The man paused and nodded.",
        "“I guess I ain’t used much to the warm,” he vouchsafed half\napologetically. “I’m more accustomed to zero weather.”",
        "“You don’t find any of that in this country,” Walt laughed.",
        "“Should say not,” the man answered. “An’ I ain’t here a-lookin’ for it\nneither. I’m tryin’ to find my sister. Mebbe you know where she lives.\nHer name’s Johnson, Mrs. William Johnson.”",
        "“You’re not her Klondike brother!” Madge cried, her eyes bright with\ninterest, “about whom we’ve heard so much?”",
        "“Yes’m, that’s me,” he answered modestly. “My name’s Miller, Skiff\nMiller. I just thought I’d s’prise her.”",
        "“You are on the right track then. Only you’ve come by the footpath.\"\nMadge stood up to direct him, pointing up the canyon a quarter of a\nmile. “You see that blasted redwood! Take the little trail turning off\nto the right. It’s the short cut to her house. You can’t miss it.”",
        "“Yes’m, thank you, ma’am,” he said.",
        "He made tentative efforts to go, but seemed awkwardly rooted to the\nspot. He was gazing at her with an open admiration of which he was quite\nunconscious, and which was drowning, along with him, in the rising sea\nof embarrassment in which he floundered.",
        "“We’d like to hear you tell about the Klondike,” Madge said. “Mayn’t we\ncome over some day while you are at your sister’s! Or, better yet,\nwon’t you come over and have dinner with us?”",
        "“Yes’m, thank you, ma’am,” he mumbled mechanically. Then he caught\nhimself up and added: “I ain’t stoppin’ long. I got to be pullin’ north\nagain. I go out on to-night’s train. You see, I’ve got a mail contract\nwith the government.”",
        "When Madge had said that it was too bad, he made another futile effort\nto go. But he could not take his eyes from her face. He forgot his\nembarrassment in his admiration, and it was her turn to flush and feel\nuncomfortable.",
        "It was at this juncture, when Walt had just decided it was time for him\nto be saying something to relieve the strain, that Wolf, who had been\naway nosing through the brush, trotted wolf-like into view.",
        "Skiff Miller’s abstraction disappeared. The pretty woman before him\npassed out of his field of vision. He had eyes only for the dog, and a\ngreat wonder came into his face.",
        "“Well, I’ll be hanged!” he enunciated slowly and solemnly.",
        "He sat down ponderingly on the log, leaving Madge standing. At the sound\nof his voice, Wolf’s ears had flattened down, then his mouth had opened\nin a laugh. He trotted slowly up to the stranger and first smelled his\nhands, then licked them with his tongue.",
        "Skiff Miller patted the dog’s head, and slowly and solemnly repeated,\n\"Well, I’ll be hanged!”",
        "“Excuse me, ma’am,” he said the next moment, “I was just s’prised some,\nthat was all.”",
        "“We’re surprised, too,” she answered lightly. “We never saw Wolf make up\nto a stranger before.”",
        "“Is that what you call him–Wolf?” the man asked.",
        "Madge nodded. “But I can’t understand his friendliness toward\nyou–unless it’s because you’re from the Klondike. He’s a Klondike dog,\nyou know.”",
        "“Yes’m,” Miller said absently. He lifted one of Wolf’s forelegs and\nexamined the footpads, pressing them and denting them with his thumb.\n\"Kind of soft,” he remarked. “He ain’t been on trail for a long time.”",
        "“I say,” Walt broke in, “it is remarkable the way he lets you handle\nhim.”",
        "Skiff Miller arose, no longer awkward with admiration of Madge, and in\na sharp, businesslike manner asked, “How long have you had him?”",
        "But just then the dog, squirming and rubbing against the newcomer’s\nlegs, opened his mouth and barked. It was an explosive bark, brief and\njoyous, but a bark.",
        "“That’s a new one on me,” Skiff Miller remarked.",
        "Walt and Madge stared at each other. The miracle had happened. Wolf had\nbarked.",
        "“It’s the first time he ever barked,” Madge said.",
        "“First time I ever heard him, too,” Miller volunteered.",
        "Madge smiled at him. The man was evidently a humorist.",
        "“Of course,” she said, “since you have only seen him for five minutes.”",
        "Skiff Miller looked at her sharply, seeking in her face the guile her\nwords had led him to suspect.",
        "“I thought you understood,” he said slowly. “I thought you’d tumbled to\nit from his makin’ up to me. He’s my dog. His name ain’t Wolf. It’s\nBrown.”",
        "“Oh, Walt!” was Madge’s instinctive cry to her husband.",
        "Walt was on the defensive at once.",
        "“How do you know he’s your dog?” he demanded.",
        "“Because he is,” was the reply.",
        "“Mere assertion,” Walt said sharply.",
        "In his slow and pondering way, Skiff Miller looked at him, then asked,\nwith a nod of his head toward Madge:",
        "“How d’you know she’s your wife? You just say, ’Because she is,’ and\nI’ll say it’s mere assertion. The dog’s mine. I bred ’m an’ raised ’m,\nan’ I guess I ought to know. Look here. I’ll prove it to you.”",
        "Skiff Miller turned to the dog. “Brown!” His voice rang out sharply, and\nat the sound the dog’s ears flattened down as to a caress. “Gee!” The\ndog made a swinging turn to the right. “Now mush-on!” And the dog ceased\nhis swing abruptly and started straight ahead, halting obediently at\ncommand.",
        "“I can do it with whistles,” Skiff Miller said proudly. “He was my lead\ndog.”",
        "“But you are not going to take him away with you?” Madge asked\ntremulously.",
        "The man nodded.",
        "“Back into that awful Klondike world of suffering?”",
        "He nodded and added: “Oh, it ain’t so bad as all that. Look at me.\nPretty healthy specimen, ain’t I!”",
        "“But the dogs! The terrible hardship, the heart-breaking toil, the\nstarvation, the frost! Oh, I’ve read about it and I know.”",
        "“I nearly ate him once, over on Little Fish River,” Miller volunteered\ngrimly. “If I hadn’t got a moose that day was all that saved ’m.”",
        "“I’d have died first!” Madge cried.",
        "“Things is different down here,” Miller explained. “You don’t have to\neat dogs. You think different just about the time you’re all in. You’ve\nnever been all in, so you don’t know anything about it.”",
        "“That’s the very point,” she argued warmly. “Dogs are not eaten in\nCalifornia. Why not leave him here? He is happy. He’ll never want for\nfood–you know that. He’ll never suffer from cold and hardship. Here all\nis softness and gentleness. Neither the human nor nature is savage. He\nwill never know a whip-lash again. And as for the weather–why, it\nnever snows here.”",
        "“But it’s all-fired hot in summer, beggin’ your pardon,” Skiff Miller\nlaughed.",
        "“But you do not answer,” Madge continued passionately. “What have you to\noffer him in that northland life?”",
        "“Grub, when I’ve got it, and that’s most of the time,” came the answer.",
        "“And the rest of the time?”",
        "“No grub.”",
        "“And the work?”",
        "“Yes, plenty of work,” Miller blurted out impatiently. “Work without\nend, an’ famine, an’ frost, an’ all the rest of the miseries–that’s\nwhat he’ll get when he comes with me. But he likes it. He is used to it.\nHe knows that life. He was born to it an’ brought up to it. An’ you\ndon’t know anything about it. You don’t know what you’re talking about.\nThat’s where the dog belongs, and that’s where he’ll be happiest.”",
        "“The dog doesn’t go,” Walt announced in a determined voice. “So there is\nno need of further discussion.”",
        "“What’s that?” Skiff Miller demanded, big brows lowering and an\nobstinate flush of blood reddening his forehead.",
        "“I said the dog doesn’t go, and that settles it. I don’t believe he’s\nyour dog. You may have seen him sometime. You may even sometime have\ndriven him for his owner. But his obeying the ordinary driving commands\nof the Alaskan trail is no demonstration that he is yours. Any dog in\nAlaska would obey you as he obeyed. Besides, he is undoubtedly a\nvaluable dog, as dogs go in Alaska, and that is sufficient explanation\nof your desire to get possession of him. Anyway, you’ve got to prove\nproperty.”",
        "Skiff Miller, cool and collected, the obstinate flush a trifle deeper on\nhis forehead, his huge muscles bulging under the black cloth of his\ncoat, carefully looked the poet up and down as though measuring the\nstrength of his slenderness.",
        "The Klondiker’s face took on a contemptuous expression as he said\nfinally: “I reckon there’s nothin’ in sight to prevent me takin’ the dog\nright here an’ now.”",
        "Walt’s face reddened, and the striking-muscles of his arms and shoulders\nseemed to stiffen and grow tense. His wife fluttered apprehensively\ninto the breach.",
        "“Maybe Mr. Miller is right,” she said. “I am afraid that he is. Wolf\ndoes seem to know him, and certainly he answers to the name of ’Brown.’\nHe made friends with him instantly, and you know that’s something he\nnever did with anybody before. Besides, look at the way he barked. He\nwas just bursting with joy. Joy over what? Without doubt at finding Mr.\nMiller.”",
        "Walt’s striking-muscles relaxed, and his shoulders seemed to droop with\nhopelessness.",
        "“I guess you’re right, Madge,” he said. “Wolf isn’t Wolf, but Brown, and\nhe must belong to Mr. Miller.”",
        "“Perhaps Mr. Miller will sell him,” she suggested. “We can buy him.”",
        "Skiff Miller shook his head, no longer belligerent, but kindly, quick to\nbe generous in response to generousness.",
        "“I had five dogs,” he said, casting about for the easiest way to temper\nhis refusal. “He was the leader. They was the crack team of Alaska.\nNothin’ could touch ’em. In 1898 I refused five thousand dollars for the\nbunch. Dogs was high, then, anyway; but that wasn’t what made the fancy\nprice. It was the team itself. Brown was the best in the team. That\nwinter I refused twelve hundred for ’m. I didn’t sell ’m then, an’ I\nain’t a-sellin’ ’m now. Besides, I think a mighty lot of that dog. I’ve\nbeen lookin’ for ’m for three years. It made me fair sick when I found\nhe’d been stole–not the value of him, but the–well, I liked ’m so,\nthat’s all. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I seen ’m just now. I\nthought I was dreamin’. It was too good to be true. Why, I was his\nnurse. I put ’m to bed, snug every night. His mother died, and I brought\n’m up on condensed milk at two dollars a can when I couldn’t afford it\nin my own coffee. He never knew any mother but me. He used to suck my\nfinger regular, the darn little pup–that finger right there!”",
        "And Skiff Miller, too overwrought for speech, held up a forefinger for\nthem to see.",
        "“That very finger,” he managed to articulate, as though it somehow\nclinched the proof of ownership and the bond of affection.",
        "He was still gazing at his extended finger when Madge began to speak.",
        "“But the dog,” she said. “You haven’t considered the dog.”",
        "Skiff Miller looked puzzled.",
        "“Have you thought about him?” she asked.",
        "“Don’t know what you’re drivin’ at,” was the response.",
        "“Maybe the dog has some choice in the matter,” Madge went on. “Maybe he\nhas his likes and desires. You have not considered him. You give him no\nchoice. It has never entered your mind that possibly he might prefer\nCalifornia to Alaska. You consider only what you like. You do with him\nas you would with a sack of potatoes or a bale of hay.”",
        "This was a new way of looking at it, and Miller was visibly impressed as\nhe debated it in his mind. Madge took advantage of his indecision.",
        "“If you really love him, what would be happiness to him would be your\nhappiness also,” she urged.",
        "Skiff Miller continued to debate with himself, and Madge stole a glance\nof exultation to her husband, who looked back warm approval.",
        "“What do you think?” the Klondiker suddenly demanded.",
        "It was her turn to be puzzled. “What do you mean?” she asked.",
        "“D’ye think he’d sooner stay in California!”",
        "She nodded her head with positiveness. “I am sure of it.”",
        "Skiff Miller again debated with himself, though this time aloud, at the\nsame time running his gaze in a judicial way over the mooted animal.",
        "“He was a good worker. He’s done a heap of work for me. He never loafed\non me, an’ he was a joe-dandy at hammerin’ a raw team into shape. He’s\ngot a head on him. He can do everything but talk. He knows what you say\nto him. Look at ’m now. He knows we’re talkin’ about him.”",
        "The dog was lying at Skiff Miller’s feet, head close down on paws, ears\nerect and listening, and eyes that were quick and eager to follow the\nsound of speech as it fell from the lips of first one and then the\nother.",
        "“An’ there’s a lot of work in ’m yet. He’s good for years to come. An’ I\ndo like him.”",
        "Once or twice after that Skiff Miller opened his mouth and closed it\nagain without speaking. Finally he said:",
        "“I’ll tell you what I’ll do. Your remarks, ma’am, has some weight in\nthem. The dog’s worked hard, and maybe he’s earned a soft berth an’ has\ngot a right to choose. Anyway, we’ll leave it up to him. Whatever he\nsays, goes. You people stay right here settin’ down. I’ll say good-by\nand walk off casual-like. If he wants to stay, he can stay. If he wants\nto come with me, let ’m come. I won’t call ’m to come an’ don’t you call\n’m to come back.”",
        "He looked with sudden suspicion at Madge, and added, “Only you must play\nfair. No persuadin’ after my back is turned.”",
        "“We’ll play fair,” Madge began, but Skiff Miller broke in on her\nassurances.",
        "“I know the ways of women,” he announced. “Their hearts is soft. When\ntheir hearts is touched they’re likely to stack the cards, look at the\nbottom of the deck, an’ lie–beggin’ your pardon, ma’am. I’m only\ndiscoursin’ about women in general.”",
        "“I don’t know how to thank you,” Madge quavered.",
        "“I don’t see as you’ve got any call to thank me,” he replied. “Brown\nain’t decided yet. Now you won’t mind if I go away slow! It’s no more’n\nfair, seein’ I’ll be out of sight inside a hundred yards.”",
        "Madge agreed, and added, “And I promise you faithfully that we won’t do\nanything to influence him.”",
        "“Well, then, I might as well he gettin’ along,” Skiff Miller said in the\nordinary tones of one departing.",
        "At this change in his voice, Wolf lifted his head quickly, and still\nmore quickly got to his feet when the man and woman shook hands. He\nsprang up on his hind legs, resting his fore paws on her hip and at the\nsame time licking Skiff Miller’s hand. When the latter shook hands with\nWalt, Wolf repeated his act, resting his weight on Walt and licking both\nmen’s hands.",
        "“It ain’t no picnic, I can tell you that,” were the Klondiker’s last\nwords, as he turned and went slowly up the trail.",
        "For the distance of twenty feet Wolf watched him go, himself all\neagerness and expectancy, as though waiting for the man to turn and\nretrace his steps. Then, with a quick low whine, Wolf sprang after him,\novertook him, caught his hand between his teeth with reluctant\ntenderness, and strove gently to make him pause.",
        "Failing in this, Wolf raced back to where Walt Irvine sat, catching his\ncoat sleeve in his teeth and trying vainly to drag him after the\nretreating man.",
        "Wolf’s perturbation began to wax. He desired ubiquity. He wanted to be\nin two places at the same time, with the old master and the new, and\nsteadily the distance between them was increasing. He sprang about\nexcitedly, making short nervous leaps and twists, now toward one, now\ntoward the other, in painful indecision, not knowing his own mind,\ndesiring both and unable to choose, uttering quick sharp whines and\nbeginning to pant.",
        "He sat down abruptly on his haunches, thrusting his nose upward, the\nmouth opening and closing with jerking movements, each time opening\nwider. These jerking movements were in unison with the recurrent spasms\nthat attacked the throat, each spasm severer and more intense than the\npreceding one. And in accord with jerks and spasms the larynx began to\nvibrate, at first silently, accompanied by the rush of air expelled from\nthe lungs, then sounding a low, deep note, the lowest in the register of\nthe human ear. All this was the nervous and muscular preliminary to\nhowling.",
        "But just as the howl was on the verge of bursting from the full throat,\nthe wide-opened mouth was closed, the paroxysms ceased, and he looked\nlong and steadily at the retreating man. Suddenly Wolf turned his head,\nand over his shoulder just as steadily regarded Walt. The appeal was\nunanswered. Not a word nor a sign did the dog receive, no suggestion and\nno clew as to what his conduct should be.",
        "A glance ahead to where the old master was nearing the curve of the\ntrail excited him again. He sprang to his feet with a whine, and then,\nstruck by a new idea, turned his attention to Madge. Hitherto he had\nignored her, but now, both masters failing him, she alone was left. He\nwent over to her and snuggled his head in her lap, nudging her arm with\nhis nose–an old trick of his when begging for favors. He backed away\nfrom her and began writhing and twisting playfully, curvetting and\nprancing, half rearing and striking his forepaws to the earth,\nstruggling with all his body, from the wheedling eyes and flattening\nears to the wagging tail, to express the thought that was in him and\nthat was denied him utterance.",
        "This, too, he soon abandoned. He was depressed by the coldness of these\nhumans who had never been cold before. No response could he draw from\nthem, no help could he get. They did not consider him. They were as\ndead.",
        "He turned and silently gazed after the old master. Skiff Miller was\nrounding the curve. In a moment he would be gone from view. Yet he never\nturned his head, plodding straight onward, slowly and methodically, as\nthough possessed of no interest in what was occurring behind his back.",
        "And in this fashion he went out of view. Wolf waited for him to\nreappear. He waited a long minute, silently, quietly, without movement,\nas though turned to stone–withal stone quick with eagerness and desire.\nHe barked once, and waited. Then he turned and trotted back to Walt\nIrvine. He sniffed his hand and dropped down heavily at his feet,\nwatching the trail where it curved emptily from view.",
        "The tiny stream slipping down the mossy-lipped stone seemed suddenly to\nincrease the volume of its gurgling noise. Save for the meadow larks,\nthere was no other sound. The great yellow butterflies drifted silently\nthrough the sunshine and lost themselves in the drowsy shadows. Madge\ngazed triumphantly at her husband.",
        "A few minutes later Wolf got upon his feet. Decision and deliberation\nmarked his movements. He did not glance at the man and woman. His eyes\nwere fixed up the trail. He had made up his mind. They knew it. And they\nknew, so far as they were concerned, that the ordeal had just begun.",
        "He broke into a trot, and Madge’s lips pursed, forming an avenue for the\ncaressing sound that it was the will of her to send forth. But the\ncaressing sound was not made. She was impelled to look at her husband,\nand she saw the sternness with which he watched her. The pursed lips\nrelaxed, and she sighed inaudibly.",
        "Wolf’s trot broke into a run. Wider and wider were the leaps he made.\nNot once did he turn his head, his wolf’s brush standing out straight\nbehind him. He cut sharply across the curve of the trail and was gone.",
        "I don’t think much of Stephen Mackaye any more, though I used to swear\nby him. I know that in those days I loved him more than my own brother.\nIf ever I meet Stephen Mackaye again, I shall not be responsible for my\nactions. It passes beyond me that a man with whom I shared food and\nblanket, and with whom I mushed over the Chilcoot Trail, should turn out\nthe way he did. I always sized Steve up as a square man, a kindly\ncomrade, without an iota of anything vindictive or malicious in his\nnature. I shall never trust my judgment in men again. Why, I nursed that\nman through typhoid fever; we starved together on the headwaters of the\nStewart; and he saved my life on the Little Salmon. And now, after the\nyears we were together, all I can say of Stephen Mackaye is that he is\nthe meanest man I ever knew.",
        "We started for the Klondike in the fall rush of 1897, and we started too\nlate to get over Chilcoot Pass before the freeze-up. We packed our\noutfit on our backs part way over, when the snow began to fly, and then\nwe had to buy dogs in order to sled it the rest of the way. That was how\nwe came to get that Spot. Dogs were high, and we paid one hundred and\nten dollars for him. He looked worth it. I say looked, because he was\none of the finest appearing dogs I ever saw. He weighed sixty pounds,\nand he had all the lines of a good sled animal. We never could make out\nhis breed. He wasn’t husky, nor Malemute, nor Hudson Bay; he looked like\nall of them and he didn’t look like any of them; and on top of it all he\nhad some of the white man’s dog in him, for on one side, in the thick of\nthe mixed yellow-brown-red-and-dirty-white that was his prevailing\ncolor, there was a spot of coal-black as big as a water-bucket. That was\nwhy we called him Spot.",
        "He was a good looker all right. When he was in condition his muscles\nstood out in bunches all over him. And he was the strongest looking\nbrute I ever saw in Alaska, also the most intelligent looking. To run\nyour eyes over him, you’d think he could outpull three dogs of his own\nweight. Maybe he could, but I never saw it. His intelligence didn’t run\nthat way. He could steal and forage to perfection; he had an instinct\nthat was positively grewsome for divining when work was to be done and\nfor making a sneak accordingly; and for getting lost and not staying\nlost he was nothing short of inspired. But when it came to work, the way\nthat intelligence dribbled out of him and left him a mere clot of\nwobbling, stupid jelly would make your heart bleed.",
        "There are times when I think it wasn’t stupidity. Maybe, like some men I\nknow, he was too wise to work. I shouldn’t wonder if he put it all over\nus with that intelligence of his. Maybe he figured it all out and\ndecided that a licking now and again and no work was a whole lot better\nthan work all the time and no licking. He was intelligent enough for\nsuch a computation. I tell you, I’ve sat and looked into that dog’s eyes\ntill the shivers ran up and down my spine and the marrow crawled like\nyeast, what of the intelligence I saw shining out. I can’t express\nmyself about that intelligence. It is beyond mere words. I saw it,\nthat’s all. At times it was like gazing into a human soul, to look into\nhis eyes; and what I saw there frightened me and started all sorts of\nideas in my own mind of reincarnation and all the rest. I tell you I\nsensed something big in that brute’s eyes; there was a message there,\nbut I wasn’t big enough myself to catch it. Whatever it was (I know I’m\nmaking a fool of myself)–whatever it was, it baffled me. I can’t give\nan inkling of what I saw in that brute’s eyes; it wasn’t light, it\nwasn’t color; it was something that moved, away back, when the eyes\nthemselves weren’t moving. And I guess I didn’t see it move, either; I\nonly sensed that it moved. It was an expression,–that’s what it\nwas,–and I got an impression of it. No; it was different from a mere\nexpression; it was more than that. I don’t know what it was, but it gave\nme a feeling of kinship just the same. Oh, no, not sentimental kinship.\nIt was, rather, a kinship of equality. Those eyes never pleaded like a\ndeer’s eyes. They challenged. No, it wasn’t defiance. It was just a calm\nassumption of equality. And I don’t think it was deliberate. My belief\nis that it was unconscious on his part. It was there because it was\nthere, and it couldn’t help shining out. No, I don’t mean shine. It\ndidn’t shine; it moved. I know I’m talking rot, but if you’d looked\ninto that animal’s eyes the way I have, you’d understand. Steve was\naffected the same way I was. Why, I tried to kill that Spot once–he was\nno good for anything; and I fell down on it. I led him out into the\nbrush, and he came along slow and unwilling. He knew what was going on.\nI stopped in a likely place, put my foot on the rope, and pulled my big\nColt’s. And that dog sat down and looked at me. I tell you he didn’t\nplead. He just looked. And I saw all kinds of incomprehensible things\nmoving, yes, moving, in those eyes of his. I didn’t really see them\nmove; I thought I saw them, for, as I said before, I guess I only sensed\nthem. And I want to tell you right now that it got beyond me. It was\nlike killing a man, a conscious, brave man who looked calmly into your\ngun as much as to say, “Who’s afraid?” Then, too, the message seemed so\nnear that, instead of pulling the trigger quick, I stopped to see if I\ncould catch the message. There it was, right before me, glimmering all\naround in those eyes of his. And then it was too late. I got scared. I\nwas trembly all over, and my stomach generated a nervous palpitation\nthat made me seasick. I just sat down and looked at that dog, and he\nlooked at me, till I thought I was going crazy. Do you want to know what\nI did? I threw down the gun and ran back to camp with the fear of God in\nmy heart. Steve laughed at me. But I notice that Steve led Spot into the\nwoods, a week later, for the same purpose, and that Steve came back\nalone, and a little later Spot drifted back, too.",
        "At any rate, Spot wouldn’t work. We paid a hundred and ten dollars for\nhim from the bottom of our sack, and he wouldn’t work. He wouldn’t even\ntighten the traces. Steve spoke to him the first time we put him in\nharness, and he sort of shivered, that was all. Not an ounce on the\ntraces. He just stood still and wobbled, like so much jelly. Steve\ntouched him with the whip. He yelped, but not an ounce. Steve touched\nhim again, a bit harder, and he howled–the regular long wolf howl. Then\nSteve got mad and gave him half a dozen, and I came on the run from the\ntent. I told Steve he was brutal with the animal, and we had some\nwords–the first we’d ever had. He threw the whip down in the snow, and\nwalked away mad. I picked it up and went to it. That Spot trembled and\nwobbled and cowered before ever I swung the lash, and with the first\nbite of it he howled like a lost soul. Next he lay down in the snow. I\nstarted the rest of the dogs, and they dragged him along while I threw\nthe whip into him. He rolled over on his back and bumped along, his four\nlegs waving in the air, himself howling as though he was going through a\nsausage machine. Steve came back and laughed at me, and I apologized for\nwhat I’d said.",
        "There was no getting any work out of that Spot; and to make up for it,\nhe was the biggest pig-glutton of a dog I ever saw. On top of that, he\nwas the cleverest thief. There was no circumventing him. Many a\nbreakfast we went without our bacon because Spot had been there first.\nAnd it was because of him that we nearly starved to death up the\nStewart. He figured out the way to break into our meat-cache, and what\nhe didn’t eat, the rest of the team did. But he was impartial. He stole\nfrom every body. He was a restless dog always very busy snooping around\nor going somewhere. And there was never a camp within five miles that he\ndidn’t raid. The worst of it was that they always came back on us to pay\nhis board bill, which was just, being the law of the land; but it was\nmighty hard on us, especially that first winter on the Chilcoot, when we\nwere busted, paying for whole hams and sides of bacon that we never ate.\nHe could fight, too, that Spot. He could do anything but work. He never\npulled a pound, but he was the boss of the whole team. The way he made\nthose dogs stand around was an education. He bullied them, and there was\nalways one or more of them fresh-marked with his fangs. But he was more\nthan a bully. He wasn’t afraid of anything that walked on four legs; and\nI’ve seen him march, single-handed, into a strange team, without any\nprovocation whatever, and put the kibosh on the whole outfit. Did I\nsay he could eat? I caught him eating the whip once. That’s straight. He\nstarted in at the lash, and when I caught him he was down to the handle,\nand still going.",
        "But he was a good looker. At the end of the first week we sold him for\nseventy-five dollars to the Mounted Police. They had experienced\ndog-drivers, and we knew that by the time he’d covered the six hundred\nmiles to Dawson he’d be a good sled-dog. I say we knew, for we were\njust getting acquainted with that Spot. A little later we were not brash\nenough to know anything where he was concerned. A week later we woke up\nin the morning to the dangdest dog-fight we’d ever heard. It was that\nSpot came back and knocking the team into shape. We ate a pretty\ndepressing breakfast, I can tell you; but cheered up two hours afterward\nwhen we sold him to an official courier, bound in to Dawson with\ngovernment despatches. That Spot was only three days in coming back,\nand, as usual, celebrated his arrival with a rough-house.",
        "We spent the winter and spring, after our own outfit was across the\npass, freighting other people’s outfits; and we made a fat stake. Also,\nwe made money out of Spot. If we sold him once, we sold him twenty\ntimes. He always came back, and no one asked for their money. We didn’t\nwant the money. We’d have paid handsomely for any one to take him off\nour hands for keeps. We had to get rid of him, and we couldn’t give him\naway, for that would have been suspicious. But he was such a fine looker\nthat we never had any difficulty in selling him. “Unbroke,” we’d say,\nand they’d pay any old price for him. We sold him as low as twenty-five\ndollars, and once we got a hundred and fifty for him. That particular\nparty returned him in person, refused to take his money back, and the\nway he abused us was something awful. He said it was cheap at the price\nto tell us what he thought of us; and we felt he was so justified that\nwe never talked back. But to this day I’ve never quite regained all the\nold self-respect that was mine before that man talked to me.",
        "When the ice cleared out of the lakes and river, we put our outfit in a\nLake Bennett boat and started for Dawson. We had a good team of dogs,\nand of course we piled them on top the outfit. That Spot was\nalong–there was no losing him; and a dozen times, the first day, he\nknocked one or another of the dogs overboard in the course of fighting\nwith them. It was close quarters, and he didn’t like being crowded.",
        "“What that dog needs is space,” Steve said the second day. “Let’s\nmaroon him.”",
        "We did, running the boat in at Caribou Crossing for him to jump ashore.\nTwo of the other dogs, good dogs, followed him; and we lost two whole\ndays trying to find them. We never saw those two dogs again; but the\nquietness and relief we enjoyed made us decide, like the man who refused\nhis hundred and fifty, that it was cheap at the price. For the first\ntime in months Steve and I laughed and whistled and sang. We were as\nhappy as clams. The dark days were over. The nightmare had been lifted.\nThat Spot was gone.",
        "Three weeks later, one morning, Steve and I were standing on the\nriver-bank at Dawson. A small boat was just arriving from Lake Bennett.\nI saw Steve give a start, and heard him say something that was not nice\nand that was not under his breath. Then I looked; and there, in the bow\nof the boat, with ears pricked up, sat Spot. Steve and I sneaked\nimmediately, like beaten curs, like cowards, like absconders from\njustice. It was this last that the lieutenant of police thought when he\nsaw us sneaking. He surmised that there was law-officers in the boat\nwho were after us. He didn’t wait to find out, but kept us in sight,\nand in the M. & M. saloon got us in a corner. We had a merry time\nexplaining, for we refused to go back to the boat and meet Spot; and\nfinally he held us under guard of another policeman while he went to the\nboat. After we got clear of him, we started for the cabin, and when we\narrived, there was that Spot sitting on the stoop waiting for us. Now\nhow did he know we lived there? There were forty thousand people in\nDawson that summer, and how did he savve our cabin out of all the\ncabins? How did he know we were in Dawson, anyway? I leave it to you.\nBut don’t forget what I have said about his intelligence and that\nimmortal something I have seen glimmering in his eyes.",
        "There was no getting rid of him any more. There were too many people in\nDawson who had bought him up on Chilcoot, and the story got around. Half\na dozen times we put him on board steamboats going down the Yukon; but\nhe merely went ashore at the first landing and trotted back up the bank.\nWe couldn’t sell him, we couldn’t kill him (both Steve and I had tried),\nand nobody else was able to kill him. He bore a charmed life. I’ve seen\nhim go down in a dog-fight on the main street with fifty dogs on top of\nhim, and when they were separated, he’d appear on all his four legs,\nunharmed, while two of the dogs that had been on top of him would be\nlying dead.",
        "I saw him steal a chunk of moose meat from Major Dinwiddie’s cache so\nheavy that he could just keep one jump ahead of Mrs. Dinwiddie’s squaw\ncook, who was after him with an axe. As he went up the hill, after the\nsquaw gave up, Major Dinwiddie himself came out and pumped his\nWinchester into the landscape. He emptied his magazine twice, and never\ntouched that Spot. Then a policeman came along and arrested him for\ndischarging firearms inside the city limits. Major Dinwiddie paid his\nfine, and Steve and I paid him for the moose meat at the rate of a\ndollar a pound, bones and all. That was what he paid for it. Meat was\nhigh that year.",
        "I am only telling what I saw with my own eyes. And now I’ll tell you\nsomething also. I saw that Spot fall through a water-hole. The ice was\nthree and a half feet thick, and the current sucked him under like a\nstraw. Three hundred yards below was the big water-hole used by the\nhospital. Spot crawled out of the hospital water-hole, licked off the\nwater, bit out the ice that had formed between his toes, trotted up the\nbank, and whipped a big Newfoundland belonging to the Gold Commissioner.",
        "In the fall of 1898, Steve and I poled up the Yukon on the last water,\nbound for Stewart River. We took the dogs along, all except Spot. We\nfigured we’d been feeding him long enough. He’d cost us more time and\ntrouble and money and grub than we’d got by selling him on the\nChilcoot–especially grub. So Steve and I tied him down in the cabin and\npulled our freight. We camped that night at the mouth of Indian River,\nand Steve and I were pretty facetious over having shaken him. Steve was\na funny fellow, and I was just sitting up in the blankets and laughing\nwhen a tornado hit camp. The way that Spot walked into those dogs and\ngave them what-for was hair-raising. Now how did he get loose? It’s up\nto you. I haven’t any theory. And how did he get across the Klondike\nRiver? That’s another facer. And anyway, how did he know we had gone up\nthe Yukon? You see, we went by water, and he couldn’t smell our tracks.\nSteve and I began to get superstitious about that dog. He got on our\nnerves, too; and, between you and me, we were just a mite afraid of him.",
        "The freeze-up came on when we were at the mouth of Henderson Creek, and\nwe traded him off for two sacks of flour to an outfit that was bound up\nWhite River after copper. Now that whole outfit was lost. Never trace\nnor hide nor hair of men, dogs, sleds, or anything was ever found. They\ndropped clean out of sight. It became one of the mysteries of the\ncountry. Steve and I plugged away up the Stewart, and six weeks\nafterward that Spot crawled into camp. He was a perambulating skeleton,\nand could just drag along; but he got there. And what I want to know is\nwho told him we were up the Stewart? We could have gone a thousand other\nplaces. How did he know? You tell me, and I’ll tell you.",
        "No losing him. At the Mayo he started a row with an Indian dog. The buck\nwho owned the dog took a swing at Spot with an axe, missed him, and\nkilled his own dog. Talk about magic and turning bullets aside–I, for\none, consider it a blamed sight harder to turn an axe aside with a big\nbuck at the other end of it. And I saw him do it with my own eyes. That\nbuck didn’t want to kill his own dog. You’ve got to show me.",
        "I told you about Spot breaking into our meat-cache. It was nearly the\ndeath of us. There wasn’t any more meat to be killed and meat was all we\nhad to live on. The moose had gone back several hundred miles and the\nIndians with them. There we were. Spring was on and we had to wait for\nthe river to break. We got pretty thin before we decided to eat the\ndogs, and we decided to eat Spot first. Do you know what that dog did?\nHe sneaked. Now how did he know our minds were made up to eat him? We\nsat up nights laying for him, but he never came back, and we ate the\nother dogs. We ate the whole team.",
        "And now for the sequel. You know what it is when a big river breaks up\nand a few billion tons of ice go out, jamming and milling and grinding.\nJust in the thick of it, when the Stewart went out, rumbling and\nroaring, we sighted Spot out in the middle. He’d got caught as he was\ntrying to cross up above somewhere. Steve and I yelled and shouted and\nran up and down the bank, tossing our hats in the air. Sometimes we’d\nstop and hug each other, we were that boisterous, for we saw Spot’s\nfinish. He didn’t have a chance in a million. He didn’t have any chance\nat all. After the ice-run, we got into a canoe and paddled down to the\nYukon, and down the Yukon to Dawson, stopping to feed up for a week at\nthe cabins at the mouth of Henderson Creek. And as we came in to the\nbank at Dawson, there sat that Spot, waiting for us, his ears pricked\nup, his tail wagging, his mouth smiling, extending a hearty welcome to\nus. Now how did he get out of that ice? How did he know we were coming\nto Dawson, to the very hour and minute, to be out there on the bank\nwaiting for us?",
        "The more I think of that Spot, the more I am convinced that there are\nthings in this world that go beyond science. On no scientific grounds\ncan that Spot be explained. It’s psychic phenomena, or mysticism, or\nsomething of that sort, I guess, with a lot of Theosophy thrown in. The\nKlondike is a good country. I might have been there yet, and become a\nmillionaire, if it hadn’t been for Spot. He got on my nerves. I stood\nhim for two years all together, and then I guess my stamina broke. It\nwas the summer of 1899 when I pulled out. I didn’t say anything to\nSteve. I just sneaked. But I fixed it up all right. I wrote Steve a\nnote, and enclosed a package of “rough-on-rats,” telling him what to do\nwith it. I was worn down to skin and bone by that Spot, and I was that\nnervous that I’d jump and look around when there wasn’t anybody within\nhailing distance. But it was astonishing the way I recuperated when I\ngot quit of him. I got back twenty pounds before I arrived in San\nFrancisco, and by the time I’d crossed the ferry to Oakland I was my old\nself again, so that even my wife looked in vain for any change in me.",
        "Steve wrote to me once, and his letter seemed irritated. He took it kind\nof hard because I’d left him with Spot. Also, he said he’d used the\n\"rough-on-rats,” per directions, and that there was nothing doing. A\nyear went by. I was back in the office and prospering in all ways–even\ngetting a bit fat. And then Steve arrived. He didn’t look me up. I read\nhis name in the steamer list, and wondered why. But I didn’t wonder\nlong. I got up one morning and found that Spot chained to the gatepost\nand holding up the milkman. Steve went north to Seattle, I learned, that\nvery morning. I didn’t put on any more weight. My wife made me buy him a\ncollar and tag, and within an hour he showed his gratitude by killing\nher pet Persian cat. There is no getting rid of that Spot. He will be\nwith me until I die, for he’ll never die. My appetite is not so good\nsince he arrived, and my wife says I am looking peaked. Last night that\nSpot got into Mr. Harvey’s hen-house (Harvey is my next door neighbor)\nand killed nineteen of his fancy-bred chickens. I shall have to pay for\nthem. My neighbors on the other side quarreled with my wife and then\nmoved out. Spot was the cause of it. And that is why I am disappointed\nin Stephen Mackaye. I had no idea he was so mean a man.",
        "All lines had been cast off, and the Seattle No. 4 was pulling slowly\nout from the shore. Her decks were piled high with freight and baggage,\nand swarmed with a heterogeneous company of Indians, dogs, and\ndog-mushers, prospectors, traders, and homeward-bound gold-seekers. A\ngoodly portion of Dawson was lined up on the bank, saying good-by. As\nthe gang-plank came in and the steamer nosed into the stream, the clamor\nof farewell became deafening. Also, in that eleventh moment, everybody\nbegan to remember final farewell messages and to shout them back and\nforth across the widening stretch of water. Louis Bondell, curling his\nyellow mustache with one hand and languidly waving the other hand to his\nfriends on shore, suddenly remembered something and sprang to the rail.",
        "“Oh, Fred!” he bawled. “Oh, Fred!”",
        "The “Fred” desired thrust a strapping pair of shoulders through the\nforefront of the crowd on the bank and tried to catch Louis Bondell’s\nmessage. The latter grew red in the face with vain vociferation. Still\nthe water widened between steamboat and shore.",
        "“Hey you, Captain Scott!” he yelled at the pilot-house. “Stop the boat!”",
        "The gongs clanged, and the big stern wheel reversed, then stopped. All\nhands on steamboat and on bank took advantage of this respite to\nexchange final, new, and imperative farewells. More futile than ever was\nLouis Bondell’s effort to make himself heard. The Seattle No. 4 lost\nway and drifted down-stream, and Captain Scott had to go ahead and\nreverse a second time. His head disappeared inside the pilot-house,\ncoming into view a moment later behind a big megaphone.",
        "Now Captain Scott had a remarkable voice, and the “Shut up!” he\nlaunched at the crowd on deck and on shore could have been heard at the\ntop of Moosehide Mountain and as far as Klondike City. This official\nremonstrance from the pilot-house spread a film of silence over the\ntumult.",
        "“Now, what do you want to say?” Captain Scott demanded.",
        "“Tell Fred Churchill–he’s on the bank there–tell him to go to\nMacdonald. It’s in his safe–a small gripsack of mine. Tell him to get\nit and bring it out when he comes.”",
        "In the silence Captain Scott bellowed the message ashore through the\nmegaphone:–",
        "“You, Fred Churchill, go to Macdonald–in his safe–small\ngripsack–belongs to Louis Bondell–important! Bring it out when you\ncome! Got it?”",
        "Churchill waved his hand in token that he had got it. In truth, had\nMacdonald, half a mile away, opened his window, he’d have got it, too.\nThe tumult of farewell rose again, the gongs clanged, and the Seattle\nNo. 4 went ahead, swung out into the stream, turned on her heel, and\nheaded down the Yukon, Bondell and Churchill waving farewell and mutual\naffection to the last.",
        "That was in midsummer. In the fall of the year, the W.H. Willisstarted up the Yukon with two hundred homeward-bound pilgrims on board.\nAmong them was Churchill. In his stateroom, in the middle of a\nclothes-bag, was Louis Bondell’s grip. It was a small, stout leather\naffair, and its weight of forty pounds always made Churchill nervous\nwhen he wandered too far from it. The man in the adjoining stateroom had\na treasure of gold-dust hidden similarly in a clothes-bag, and the pair\nof them ultimately arranged to stand watch and watch. While one went\ndown to eat, the other kept an eye on the two stateroom doors. When\nChurchill wanted to take a hand at whist, the other man mounted guard,\nand when the other man wanted to relax his soul, Churchill read\nfour-months’-old newspapers on a camp stool between the two doors.",
        "There were signs of an early winter, and the question that was discussed\nfrom dawn till dark, and far into the dark, was whether they would get\nout before the freeze-up or be compelled to abandon the steamboat and\ntramp out over the ice. There were irritating delays. Twice the engines\nbroke down and had to be tinkered up, and each time there were snow\nflurries to warn them of the imminence of winter. Nine times the W.H.\nWillis essayed to ascend the Five-Finger Rapids with her impaired\nmachinery, and when she succeeded, she was four days behind her very\nliberal schedule. The question that then arose was whether or not the\nsteamboat Flora would wait for her above the Box Cañon. The stretch of\nwater between the head of the Box Cañon and the foot of the White Horse\nRapids was unnavigable for steamboats and passengers were transshipped\nat that point, walking around the rapids from one steamboat to the\nother. There were no telephones in the country, hence no way of\ninforming the waiting Flora that the Willis was four days late, but\ncoming.",
        "When the W.H. Willis pulled into White Horse, it was learned that the\nFlora had waited three days over the limit, and had departed only a\nfew hours before. Also, it was learned that she would tie up at Tagish\nPost till nine o’clock, Sunday morning. It was then four o’clock\nSaturday afternoon. The pilgrims called a meeting. On board was a large\nPeterborough canoe, consigned to the police post at the head of Lake\nBennett. They agreed to be responsible for it and to deliver it. Next,\nthey called for volunteers. Two men were needed to make a race for the\nFlora. A score of men volunteered on the instant. Among them was\nChurchill, such being his nature that he volunteered before he thought\nof Bondell’s gripsack. When this thought came to him, he began to hope\nthat he would not be selected; but a man who had made a name as captain\nof a college football eleven, as a president of an athletic club, as a\ndog-musher and a stampeder in the Yukon, and, moreover, who possessed\nsuch shoulders as he, had no right to avoid the honor. It was thrust\nupon him and upon a gigantic German, Nick Antonsen.",
        "While a crowd of the pilgrims, the canoe on their shoulders, started on\na trot over the portage, Churchill ran to his stateroom. He turned the\ncontents of the clothes-bag on the floor and caught up the grip with the\nintention of intrusting it to the man next door. Then the thought smote\nhim that it was not his grip, and that he had no right to let it out of\nhis own possession. So he dashed ashore with it and ran up the portage,\nchanging it often from one hand to the other, and wondering if it really\ndid not weigh more than forty pounds.",
        "It was half-past four in the afternoon when the two men started. The\ncurrent of the Thirty Mile River was so strong that rarely could they\nuse the paddles. It was out on one bank with a tow-line over the\nshoulders stumbling over the rocks, forcing a way through the\nunderbrush, slipping at times and falling into the water, wading often\nup to the knees and waist; and then, when an insurmountable bluff was\nencountered, it was into the canoe, out paddles, and a wild and losing\ndash across the current to the other bank, in paddles, over the side,\nand out tow-line again. It was exhausting work. Antonsen toiled like the\ngiant he was, uncomplaining, persistent, but driven to his utmost by the\npowerful body and indomitable brain of Churchill. They never paused for\nrest. It was go, go, and keep on going. A crisp wind blew down the\nriver, freezing their hands and making it imperative, from time to time,\nto beat the blood back into the numb fingers. As night came on, they\nwere compelled to trust to luck. They fell repeatedly on the untraveled\nbanks and tore their clothing to shreds in the underbrush they could not\nsee. Both men were badly scratched and bleeding. A dozen times, in their\nwild dashes from bank to bank, they struck snags and were capsized. The\nfirst time this happened, Churchill dived and groped in three feet of\nwater for the gripsack. He lost half an hour in recovering it, and after\nthat it was carried securely lashed to the canoe. As long as the canoe\nfloated it was safe. Antonsen jeered at the grip, and toward morning\nbegan to abuse it; but Churchill vouchsafed no explanations.",
        "Their delays and mischances were endless. On one swift bend, around\nwhich poured a healthy young rapid, they lost two hours, making a score\nof attempts and capsizing twice. At this point, on both banks, were\nprecipitous bluffs, rising out of deep water, and along which they could\nneither tow nor pole, while they could not gain with the paddles against\nthe current. At each attempt they strained to the utmost with the\npaddles, and each time, with hearts nigh to bursting from the effort,\nthey were played out and swept back. They succeeded finally by an\naccident. In the swiftest current, near the end of another failure, a\nfreak of the current sheered the canoe out of Churchill’s control and\nflung it against the bluff. Churchill made a blind leap at the bluff and\nlanded in a crevice. Holding on with one hand, he held the swamped canoe\nwith the other till Antonsen dragged himself out of the water. Then they\npulled the canoe out and rested. A fresh start at this crucial point\ntook them by. They landed on the bank above and plunged immediately\nashore and into the brush with the tow-line.",
        "Daylight found them far below Tagish Post. At nine o ’clock Sunday\nmorning they could hear the Flora whistling her departure. And when,\nat ten o’clock, they dragged themselves in to the Post, they could just\nbarely see the Flora’s smoke far to the southward. It was a pair of\nworn-out tatterdemalions that Captain Jones of the Mounted Police\nwelcomed and fed, and he afterward averred that they possessed two of\nthe most tremendous appetites he had ever observed. They lay down and\nslept in their wet rags by the stove. At the end of two hours Churchill\ngot up, carried Bondell’s grip, which he had used for a pillow, down to\nthe canoe, kicked Antonsen awake, and started in pursuit of the Flora.",
        "“There’s no telling what might happen–machinery break down or\nsomething,” was his reply to Captain Jones’s expostulations. “I’m going\nto catch that steamer and send her back for the boys.”",
        "Tagish Lake was white with a fall gale that blew in their teeth. Big,\nswinging seas rushed upon the canoe, compelling one man to bail and\nleaving one man to paddle. Headway could not be made. They ran along the\nshallow shore and went overboard, one man ahead on the tow-line, the\nother shoving on the canoe. They fought the gale up to their waists in\nthe icy water, often up to their necks, often over their heads and\nburied by the big, crested waves. There was no rest, never a moment’s\npause from the cheerless, heart-breaking battle. That night, at the head\nof Tagish Lake, in the thick of a driving snow-squall, they overhauled\nthe Flora. Antonsen. “You go back to White Horse, and snored.\n[Transcriber’s note: The above is evidently a printer’s error.]\nChurchill looked like a wild man. His clothes barely clung to him. His\nface was iced up and swollen from the protracted effort of twenty-four\nhours, while his hands were so swollen that he could not close the\nfingers. As for his feet, it was an agony to stand upon them.",
        "The captain of the Flora was loath to go back to White Horse.\nChurchill was persistent and imperative; the captain was stubborn. He\npointed out finally that nothing was to be gained by going back, because\nthe only ocean steamer at Dyea, the Athenian, was to sail on Tuesday\nmorning, and that he could not make the back trip to White Horse and\nbring up the stranded pilgrims in time to make the connection.",
        "“What time does the Athenian sail?” Churchill demanded.",
        "“Seven o’clock, Tuesday morning.”",
        "“All right,” Churchill said, at the same time kicking a tattoo on the\nribs of the snoring Antonsen. “You go back to White Horse. We’ll go\nahead and hold the Athenian.”",
        "Antonsen, stupid with sleep, not yet clothed in his waking mind, was\nbundled into the canoe, and did not realize what had happened till he\nwas drenched with the icy spray of a big sea, and heard Churchill\nsnarling at him through the darkness:–",
        "“Paddle, can’t you! Do you want to be swamped?”",
        "Daylight found them at Caribou Crossing, the wind dying down, and\nAntonsen too far gone to dip a paddle. Churchill grounded the canoe on a\nquiet beach, where they slept. He took the precaution of twisting his\narm under the weight of his head. Every few minutes the pain of the pent\ncirculation aroused him, whereupon he would look at his watch and twist\nthe other arm under his head. At the end of two hours he fought with\nAntonsen to rouse him. Then they started. Lake Bennett, thirty miles in\nlength, was like a mill-pond; but, halfway across, a gale from the south\nsmote them and turned the water white. Hour after hour they repeated the\nstruggle on Tagish, over the side, pulling and shoving on the canoe, up\nto their waists and necks, and over their heads, in the icy water;\ntoward the last the good-natured giant played completely out. Churchill\ndrove him mercilessly; but when he pitched forward and bade fair to\ndrown in three feet of water, the other dragged him into the canoe.\nAfter that, Churchill fought on alone, arriving at the police post at\nthe head of Bennett in the early afternoon. He tried to help Antonsen\nout of the canoe, but failed. He listened to the exhausted man’s heavy\nbreathing, and envied him when he thought of what he himself had yet to\nundergo. Antonsen could lie there and sleep; but he, behind time, must\ngo on over mighty Chilcoot and down to the sea. The real struggle lay\nbefore him, and he almost regretted the strength that resided in his\nframe because of the torment it could inflict upon that frame.",
        "Churchill pulled the canoe up on the beach, seized Bondell’s grip, and\nstarted on a limping dog-trot for the police post.",
        "“There’s a canoe down there, consigned to you from Dawson,” he hurled at\nthe officer who answered his knock. “And there’s a man in it pretty near\ndead. Nothing serious; only played out. Take care of him. I’ve got to\nrush. Good-by. Want to catch the Athenian.”",
        "A mile portage connected Lake Bennett and Lake Linderman, and his last\nwords he flung back after him as he resumed the trot. It was a very\npainful trot, but he clenched his teeth and kept on, forgetting his pain\nmost of the time in the fervent heat with which he regarded the\ngripsack. It was a severe handicap. He swung it from one hand to the\nother, and back again. He tucked it under his arm. He threw one hand\nover the opposite shoulder, and the bag bumped and pounded on his back\nas he ran along. He could scarcely hold it in his bruised and swollen\nfingers, and several times he dropped it. Once, in changing from one\nhand to the other, it escaped his clutch and fell in front of him,\ntripped him up, and threw him violently to the ground.",
        "At the far end of the portage he bought an old set of pack-straps for a\ndollar, and in them he swung the grip. Also, he chartered a launch to\nrun him the six miles to the upper end of Lake Linderman, where he\narrived at four in the afternoon. The Athenian was to sail from Dyea\nnext morning at seven. Dyea was twenty-eight miles away, and between\ntowered Chilcoot. He sat down to adjust his foot-gear for the long\nclimb, and woke up. He had dozed the instant he sat down, though he had\nnot slept thirty seconds. He was afraid his next doze might be longer,\nso he finished fixing his foot-gear standing up. Even then he was\noverpowered for a fleeting moment. He experienced the flash of\nunconsciousness; becoming aware of it, in midair, as his relaxed body\nwas sinking to the ground and as he caught himself together, he\nstiffened his muscles with a spasmodic wrench, and escaped the fall. The\nsudden jerk back to consciousness left him sick and trembling. He beat\nhis head with the heel of his hand, knocking wakefulness into the numb\nbrain.",
        "Jack Burns’s pack-train was starting back light for Crater Lake, and\nChurchill was invited to a mule. Burns wanted to put the gripsack on\nanother animal, but Churchill held on to it, carrying it on his\nsaddle-pommel. But he dozed, and the grip persisted in dropping off the\npommel, one side or the other, each time wakening him with a sickening\nstart. Then, in the early darkness, Churchill’s mule brushed him against\na projecting branch that laid his cheek open. To cap it, the mule\nblundered off the trail and fell, throwing rider and gripsack out upon\nthe rocks. After that, Churchill walked, or stumbled, rather, over the\napology for a trail, leading the mule. Stray and awful odors, drifting\nfrom each side the trail, told of the horses that had died in the rush\nfor gold. But he did not mind. He was too sleepy. By the time Long Lake\nwas reached, however, he had recovered from his sleepiness; and at Deep\nLake he resigned the gripsack to Burns. But thereafter, by the light of\nthe dim stars, he kept his eyes on Burns. There were not going to be any\naccidents with that bag.",
        "At Crater Lake the pack-train went into camp, and Churchill, slinging\nthe grip on his back, started the steep climb for the summit. For the\nfirst time, on that precipitous wall, he realized how tired he was. He\ncrept and crawled like a crab, burdened by the weight of his limbs. A\ndistinct and painful effort of will was required each time he lifted a\nfoot. An hallucination came to him that he was shod with lead, like a\ndeep-sea diver, and it was all he could do to resist the desire to reach\ndown and feel the lead. As for Bondell’s gripsack, it was inconceivable\nthat forty pounds could weigh so much. It pressed him down like a\nmountain, and he looked back with unbelief to the year before, when he\nhad climbed that same pass with a hundred and fifty pounds on his back,\nIf those loads had weighed a hundred and fifty pounds, then Bondell’s\ngrip weighed five hundred.",
        "The first rise of the divide from Crater Lake was across a small\nglacier. Here was a well-defined trail. But above the glacier, which was\nalso above timber-line, was naught but a chaos of naked rock and\nenormous boulders. There was no way of seeing the trail in the darkness,\nand he blundered on, paying thrice the ordinary exertion for all that he\naccomplished. He won the summit in the thick of howling wind and driving\nsnow, providentially stumbling upon a small, deserted tent, into which\nhe crawled. There he found and bolted some ancient fried potatoes and\nhalf a dozen raw eggs.",
        "When the snow ceased and the wind eased down, he began the almost\nimpossible descent. There was no trail, and he stumbled and blundered,\noften finding himself, at the last moment, on the edge of rocky walls\nand steep slopes the depth of which he had no way of judging. Part way\ndown, the stars clouded over again, and in the consequent obscurity he\nslipped and rolled and slid for a hundred feet, landing bruised and\nbleeding on the bottom of a large shallow hole. From all about him arose\nthe stench of dead horses. The hole was handy to the trail, and the\npackers had made a practice of tumbling into it their broken and dying\nanimals. The stench overpowered him, making him deathly sick, and as in\na nightmare he scrambled out. Halfway up, he recollected Bondell’s\ngripsack. It had fallen into the hole with him; the pack-strap had\nevidently broken, and he had forgotten it. Back he went into the\npestilential charnel-pit, where he crawled around on hands and knees and\ngroped for half an hour. Altogether he encountered and counted seventeen\ndead horses (and one horse still alive that he shot with his revolver)\nbefore he found Bondell’s grip. Looking back upon a life that had not\nbeen without valor and achievement, he unhesitatingly declared to\nhimself that this return after the grip was the most heroic act he had\never performed. So heroic was it that he was twice on the verge of\nfainting before he crawled out of the hole.",
        "By the time he had descended to the Scales, the steep pitch of Chilcoot\nwas past, and the way became easier. Not that it was an easy way,\nhowever, in the best of places; but it became a really possible trail,\nalong which he could have made good time if he had not been worn out, if\nhe had had light with which to pick his steps, and if it had not been\nfor Bondell’s gripsack. To him, in his exhausted condition, it was the\nlast straw. Having barely strength to carry himself along, the\nadditional weight of the grip was sufficient to throw him nearly every\ntime he tripped or stumbled. And when he escaped tripping, branches\nreached out in the darkness, hooked the grip between his shoulders, and\nheld him back.",
        "His mind was made up that if he missed the Athenian it would be the\nfault of the gripsack. In fact, only two things remained in his\nconsciousness–Bondell’s grip and the steamer. He knew only those two\nthings, and they became identified, in a way, with some stern mission\nupon which he had journeyed and toiled for centuries. He walked and\nstruggled on as in a dream. A part of the dream was his arrival at Sheep\nCamp. He stumbled into a saloon, slid his shoulders out of the straps,\nand started to deposit the grip at his feet. But it slipped from his\nfingers and struck the floor with a heavy thud that was not unnoticed by\ntwo men who were just leaving. Churchill drank a glass of whiskey, told\nthe barkeeper to call him in ten minutes, and sat down, his feet on the\ngrip, his head on his knees.",
        "So badly did his misused body stiffen, that when he was called it\nrequired another ten minutes and a second glass of whiskey to unbend his\njoints and limber up the muscles.",
        "“Hey! not that way!” the barkeeper shouted, and then went after him and\nstarted him through the darkness toward Canyon City. Some little husk of\ninner consciousness told Churchill that the direction was right, and,\nstill as in a dream, he took the canyon trail. He did not know what\nwarned him, but after what seemed several centuries of travelling, he\nsensed danger and drew his revolver. Still in the dream, he saw two men\nstep out and heard them halt him. His revolver went off four times, and\nhe saw the flashes and heard the explosions of their revolvers. Also, he\nwas aware that he had been hit in the thigh. He saw one man go down,\nand, as the other came for him, he smashed him a straight blow with the\nheavy revolver full in the face. Then he turned and ran. He came from\nthe dream shortly afterward, to find himself plunging down the trail at\na limping lope. His first thought was for the gripsack. It was still on\nhis back. He was convinced that what had happened was a dream till he\nfelt for his revolver and found it gone. Next he became aware of a sharp\nstinging of his thigh, and after investigating, he found his hand warm\nwith blood. It was a superficial wound, but it was incontestable. He\nbecame wider awake, and kept up the lumbering run to Canyon City.",
        "He found a man, with a team of horses and a wagon, who got out of bed\nand harnessed up for twenty dollars. Churchill crawled in on the\nwagon-bed and slept, the gripsack still on his back. It was a rough\nride, over water-washed boulders down the Dyea Valley; but he roused\nonly when the wagon hit the highest places. Any altitude of his body\nabove the wagon-bed of less than a foot did not faze him. The last mile\nwas smooth going, and he slept soundly.",
        "He came to in the gray dawn, the driver shaking him savagely and howling\ninto his ear that the Athenian was gone. Churchill looked blankly at\nthe deserted harbor.",
        "“There’s a smoke over at Skaguay,” the man said.",
        "Churchill’s eyes were too swollen to see that far, but he said: “It’s\nshe. Get me a boat.”",
        "The driver was obliging, and found a skiff and a man to row it for ten\ndollars, payment in advance. Churchill paid, and was helped into the\nskiff. It was beyond him to get in by himself. It was six miles to\nSkaguay, and he had a blissful thought of sleeping those six miles. But\nthe man did not know how to row, and Churchill took the oars and toiled\nfor a few more centuries. He never knew six longer and more excruciating\nmiles. A snappy little breeze blew up the inlet and held him back. He\nhad a gone feeling at the pit of the stomach, and suffered from\nfaintness and numbness. At his command, the man took the bailer and\nthrew salt water into his face.",
        "The Athenian’s anchor was up-and-down when they came alongside, and\nChurchill was at the end of his last remnant of strength.",
        "“Stop her! Stop her!” he shouted hoarsely. “Important message! Stop\nher!”",
        "Then he dropped his chin on his chest and slept. “When half a dozen men\nstarted to carry him up the gang-plank, he awoke, reached for the grip,\nand clung to it like a drowning man. On deck he became a center of\nhorror and curiosity. The clothing in which he had left White Horse was\nrepresented by a few rags, and he was as frayed as his clothing. He had\ntraveled for fifty-five hours at the top notch of endurance. He had\nslept six hours in that time, and he was twenty pounds lighter than when\nhe started. Face and hands and body were scratched and bruised, and he\ncould scarcely see. He tried to stand up, but failed, sprawling out on\nthe deck, hanging on to the gripsack, and delivering his message.",
        "“Now, put me to bed,” he finished; “I’ll eat when I wake up.”",
        "They did him honor, carrying him down in his rags and dirt and\ndepositing him and Bondell’s grip in the bridal chamber, which was the\nbiggest and most luxurious stateroom in the ship. Twice he slept the\nclock around, and he had bathed and shaved and eaten and was leaning\nover the rail smoking a cigar when the two hundred pilgrims from White\nHorse came alongside.",
        "By the time the Athenian arrived in Seattle, Churchill had fully\nrecuperated, and he went ashore with Bondell’s grip in his hand. He\nfelt proud of that grip. To him it stood for achievement and integrity\nand trust. “I’ve delivered the goods,” was the way he expressed these\nvarious high terms to himself. It was early in the evening, and he went\nstraight to Bondell’s home. Louis Bondell was glad to see him, shaking\nhands with both hands at the same time and dragging him into the house.",
        "“Oh, thanks, old man; it was good of you to bring it out,” Bondell said\nwhen he received the gripsack.",
        "He tossed it carelessly upon a couch, and Churchill noted with an\nappreciative eye the rebound of its weight from the springs. Bondell was\nvolleying him with questions.",
        "“How did you make out? How’re the boys! What became of Bill Smithers? Is\nDel Bishop still with Pierce? Did he sell my dogs? How did Sulphur\nBottom show up? You’re looking fine. What steamer did you come out on?”",
        "To all of which Churchill gave answer, till half an hour had gone by and\nthe first lull in the conversation had arrived.",
        "“Hadn’t you better take a look at it?” he suggested, nodding his head at\nthe gripsack.",
        "“Oh, it’s all right,” Bondell answered. “Did Mitchell’s dump turn out\nas much as he expected?”",
        "“I think you’d better look at it,” Churchill insisted. “When I deliver a\nthing, I want to be satisfied that it’s all right. There’s always the\nchance that somebody might have got into it when I was asleep, or\nsomething.”",
        "“It’s nothing important, old man,” Bondell answered, with a laugh.",
        "“Nothing important,” Churchill echoed in a faint, small voice. Then he\nspoke with decision: “Louis, what’s in that bag? I want to know.”",
        "Louis looked at him curiously, then left the room and returned with a\nbunch of keys. He inserted his hand and drew out a heavy .44 Colt’s\nrevolver. Next came out a few boxes of ammunition for the revolver and\nseveral boxes of Winchester cartridges.",
        "Churchill took the gripsack and looked into it. Then he turned it upside\ndown and shook it gently.",
        "“The gun’s all rusted,” Bondell said. “Must have been out in the rain.”",
        "“Yes,” Churchill answered. “Too bad it got wet. I guess I was a bit\ncareless.”",
        "He got up and went outside. Ten minutes later Louis Bondell went out\nand found him on the steps, sitting down, elbows on knees and chin on\nhands, gazing steadfastly out into the darkness.",
        "It was the green heart of the canyon, where the walls swerved back from\nthe rigid plan and relieved their harshness of line by making a little\nsheltered nook and filling it to the brim with sweetness and roundness\nand softness. Here all things rested. Even the narrow stream ceased its\nturbulent down-rush long enough to form a quiet pool. Knee-deep in the\nwater, with drooping head and half-shut eyes, drowsed a red-coated,\nmany-antlered buck.",
        "On one side, beginning at the very lip of the pool, was a tiny meadow, a\ncool, resilient surface of green that extended to the base of the\nfrowning wall. Beyond the pool a gentle slope of earth ran up and up to\nmeet the opposing wall. Fine grass covered the slope–grass that was\nspangled with flowers, with here and there patches of color, orange and\npurple and golden. Below, the canyon was shut in. There was no view.\nThe walls leaned together abruptly and the canyon ended in a chaos of\nrocks, moss-covered and hidden by a green screen of vines and creepers\nand boughs of trees. Up the canyon rose far hills and peaks, the big\nfoothills, pine-covered and remote. And far beyond, like clouds upon the\nborder of the sky, towered minarets of white, where the Sierra’s eternal\nsnows flashed austerely the blazes of the sun.",
        "There was no dust in the canyon. The leaves and flowers were clean and\nvirginal. The grass was young velvet. Over the pool three cottonwoods\nsent their snowy fluffs fluttering down the quiet air. On the slope the\nblossoms of the wine-wooded manzanita filled the air with springtime\nodors, while the leaves, wise with experience, were already beginning\ntheir vertical twist against the coming aridity of summer. In the open\nspaces on the slope, beyond the farthest shadow-reach of the manzanita,\npoised the mariposa lilies, like so many flights of jewelled moths\nsuddenly arrested and on the verge of trembling into flight again. Here\nand there that woods harlequin, the madrone, permitting itself to be\ncaught in the act of changing its pea-green trunk to madder-red,\nbreathed its fragrance into the air from great clusters of waxen bells.\nCreamy white were these bells, shaped like lilies-of-the-valley, with\nthe sweetness of perfume that is of the springtime.",
        "There was not a sigh of wind. The air was drowsy with its weight of\nperfume. It was a sweetness that would have been cloying had the air\nbeen heavy and humid. But the air was sharp and thin. It was as\nstarlight transmuted into atmosphere, shot through and warmed by\nsunshine, and flower-drenched with sweetness.",
        "An occasional butterfly drifted in and out through the patches of light\nand shade. And from all about rose the low and sleepy hum of mountain\nbees–feasting Sybarites that jostled one another good-naturedly at the\nboard, nor found time for rough discourtesy. So quietly did the little\nstream drip and ripple its way through the canyon that it spoke only in\nfaint and occasional gurgles. The voice of the stream was as a drowsy\nwhisper, ever interrupted by dozings and silences, ever lifted again in\nthe awakenings.",
        "The motion of all things was a drifting in the heart of the canyon.\nSunshine and butterflies drifted in and out among the trees. The hum of\nthe bees and the whisper of the stream were a drifting of sound. And the\ndrifting sound and drifting color seemed to weave together in the making\nof a delicate and intangible fabric which was the spirit of the place.\nIt was a spirit of peace that was not of death, but of smooth-pulsing\nlife, of quietude that was not silence, of movement that was not action,\nof repose that was quick with existence without being violent with\nstruggle and travail. The spirit of the place was the spirit of the\npeace of the living, somnolent with the easement and content of\nprosperity, and undisturbed by rumors of far wars.",
        "The red-coated, many-antlered buck acknowledged the lordship of the\nspirit of the place and dozed knee-deep in the cool, shaded pool. There\nseemed no flies to vex him and he was languid with rest. Sometimes his\nears moved when the stream awoke and whispered; but they moved lazily,\nwith foreknowledge that it was merely the stream grown garrulous at\ndiscovery that it had slept.",
        "But there came a time when the buck’s ears lifted and tensed with swift\neagerness for sound. His head was turned down the canyon. His\nsensitive, quivering nostrils scented the air. His eyes could not\npierce the green screen through which the stream rippled away, but to\nhis ears came the voice of a man. It was a steady, monotonous, singsong\nvoice. Once the buck heard the harsh clash of metal upon rock. At the\nsound he snorted with a sudden start that jerked him through the air\nfrom water to meadow, and his feet sank into the young velvet, while he\npricked his ears and again scented the air. Then he stole across the\ntiny meadow, pausing once and again to listen, and faded away out of the\ncanyon like a wraith, soft-footed and without sound.",
        "The clash of steel-shod soles against the rocks began to be heard, and\nthe man’s voice grew louder. It was raised in a sort of chant and became\ndistinct with nearness, so that the words could be heard:",
        "   “Tu’n around an’ tu’n yo’ face\n   Untoe them sweet hills of grace\n     (D’ pow’rs of sin yo’ am scornin’!).\n   Look about an’ look aroun’\n   Fling yo’ sin-pack on d’ groun’\n     (Yo’ will meet wid d’ Lord in d’ mornin’!).”",
        "’A sound of scrambling accompanied the song, and the spirit of the place\nfled away on the heels of the red-coated buck. The green screen was\nburst asunder, and a man peered out at the meadow and the pool and the\nsloping side-hill. He was a deliberate sort of man. He took in the scene\nwith one embracing glance, then ran his eyes over the details to verify\nthe general impression. Then, and not until then, did he open his mouth\nin vivid and solemn approval:",
        "“Smoke of life an’ snakes of purgatory! Will you just look at that! Wood\nan’ water an’ grass an’ a side-hill! A pocket-hunter’s delight an’ a\ncayuse’s paradise! Cool green for tired eyes! Pink pills for pale people\nain’t in it. A secret pasture for prospectors and a resting-place for\ntired burros. It’s just booful!”",
        "He was a sandy-complexioned man in whose face geniality and humor seemed\nthe salient characteristics. It was a mobile face, quick-changing to\ninward mood and thought. Thinking was in him a visible process. Ideas\nchased across his face like wind-flaws across the surface of a lake. His\nhair, sparse and unkempt of growth, was as indeterminate and colorless\nas his complexion. It would seem that all the color of his frame had\ngone into his eyes, for they were startlingly blue. Also, they were\nlaughing and merry eyes, within them much of the naiveté and wonder of\nthe child; and yet, in an unassertive way, they contained much of calm\nself-reliance and strength of purpose founded upon self-experience and\nexperience of the world.",
        "From out the screen of vines and creepers he flung ahead of him a\nminer’s pick and shovel and gold-pan. Then he crawled out himself into\nthe open. He was clad in faded overalls and black cotton shirt, with\nhobnailed brogans on his feet, and on his head a hat whose shapelessness\nand stains advertised the rough usage of wind and rain and sun and\ncamp-smoke. He stood erect, seeing wide-eyed the secrecy of the scene\nand sensuously inhaling the warm, sweet breath of the canyon-garden\nthrough nostrils that dilated and quivered with delight. His eyes\nnarrowed to laughing slits of blue, his face wreathed itself in joy, and\nhis mouth curled in a smile as he cried aloud:",
        "“Jumping dandelions and happy hollyhocks, but that smells good to me!\nTalk about your attar o’ roses an’ cologne factories! They ain’t in it!”",
        "He had the habit of soliloquy. His quick-changing facial expressions\nmight tell every thought and mood, but the tongue, perforce, ran hard\nafter, repeating, like a second Boswell.",
        "The man lay down on the lip of the pool and drank long and deep of its\nwater. “Tastes good to me,” he murmured, lifting his head and gazing\nacross the pool at the side-hill, while he wiped his mouth with the back\nof his hand. The side-hill attracted his attention. Still lying on his\nstomach, he studied the hill formation long and carefully. It was a\npractised eye that traveled up the slope to the crumbling canyon-wall\nand back and down again to the edge of the pool. He scrambled to his\nfeet and favored the side-hill with a second survey.",
        "“Looks good to me,” he concluded, picking up his pick and shovel and\ngold-pan.",
        "He crossed the stream below the pool, stepping agilely from stone to\nstone. Where the side-hill touched the water he dug up a shovelful of\ndirt and put it into the gold-pan. He squatted down, holding the pan in\nhis two hands, and partly immersing it in the stream. Then he imparted\nto the pan a deft circular motion that sent the water sluicing in and\nout through the dirt and gravel. The larger and the lighter particles\nworked to the surface, and these, by a skilful dipping movement of the\npan, he spilled out and over the edge. Occasionally, to expedite\nmatters, he rested the pan and with his fingers raked out the large\npebbles and pieces of rock.",
        "The contents of the pan diminished rapidly until only fine dirt and the\nsmallest bits of gravel remained. At this stage he began to work very\ndeliberately and carefully. It was fine washing, and he washed fine and\nfiner, with a keen scrutiny and delicate and fastidious touch. At last\nthe pan seemed empty of everything but water; but with a quick\nsemi-circular flirt that sent the water flying over the shallow rim into\nthe stream, he disclosed a layer of black sand on the bottom of the pan.\nSo thin was this layer that it was like a streak of paint. He examined\nit closely. In the midst of it was a tiny golden speck. He dribbled a\nlittle water in over the depressed edge of the pan. With a quick flirt\nhe sent the water sluicing across the bottom, turning the grains of\nblack sand over and over. A second tiny golden speck rewarded his\neffort.",
        "The washing had now become very fine–fine beyond all need of ordinary\nplacer-mining. He worked the black sand, a small portion at a time, up\nthe shallow rim of the pan. Each small portion he examined sharply, so\nthat his eyes saw every grain of it before he allowed it to slide over\nthe edge and away. Jealously, bit by bit, he let the black sand slip\naway. A golden speck, no larger than a pin-point, appeared on the rim,\nand by his manipulation of the water it returned to the bottom of the\npan. And in such fashion another speck was disclosed, and another. Great\nwas his care of them. Like a shepherd he herded his flock of golden\nspecks so that not one should be lost. At last, of the pan of dirt\nnothing remained but his golden herd. He counted it, and then, after all\nhis labor, sent it flying out of the pan with one final swirl of water.",
        "But his blue eyes were shining with desire as he rose to his feet.\n\"Seven,” he muttered aloud, asserting the sum of the specks for which he\nhad toiled so hard and which he had so wantonly thrown away. “Seven,” he\nrepeated, with the emphasis of one trying to impress a number on his\nmemory.",
        "He stood still a long while, surveying the hillside. In his eyes was a\ncuriosity, new-aroused and burning. There was an exultance about his\nbearing and a keenness like that of a hunting animal catching the fresh\nscent of game.",
        "He moved down the stream a few steps and took a second panful of dirt.",
        "Again came the careful washing, the jealous herding of the golden\nspecks, and the wantonness with which he sent them flying into the\nstream.",
        "“Five,” he muttered, and repeated, “five.”",
        "He could not forbear another survey of the hill before filling the pan\nfarther down the stream. His golden herds diminished. “Four, three, two,\ntwo, one,” were his memory tabulations as he moved down the stream. When\nbut one speck of gold rewarded his washing, he stopped and built a fire\nof dry twigs. Into this he thrust the gold-pan and burned it till it was\nblue-black. He held up the pan and examined it critically. Then he\nnodded approbation. Against such a color-background he could defy the\ntiniest yellow speck to elude him.",
        "Still moving down the stream, he panned again. A single speck was his\nreward. A third pan contained no gold at all. Not satisfied with this,\nhe panned three times again, taking his shovels of dirt within a foot of\none another. Each pan proved empty of gold, and the fact, instead of\ndiscouraging him, seemed to give him satisfaction. His elation increased\nwith each barren washing, until he arose, exclaiming jubilantly:",
        "“If it ain’t the real thing, may God knock off my head with sour\napples!”",
        "Returning to where he had started operations, he began to pan up the\nstream. At first his golden herds increased–increased prodigiously.\n\"Fourteen, eighteen, twenty-one, twenty-six,” ran his memory\ntabulations. Just above the pool he struck his richest pan–thirty-five\ncolors.",
        "“Almost enough to save,” he remarked regretfully as he allowed the water\nto sweep them away.",
        "The sun climbed to the top of the sky. The man worked on. Pan by pan, he\nwent up the stream, the tally of results steadily decreasing.",
        "“It’s just booful, the way it peters out,” he exulted when a shovelful\nof dirt contained no more than a single speck of gold. And when no\nspecks at all were found in several pans, he straightened up and favored\nthe hillside with a confident glance.",
        "“Ah, ha! Mr. Pocket!” he cried out, as though to an auditor hidden\nsomewhere above him beneath the surface of the slope. “Ah, ha! Mr.\nPocket! I’m a-comin’, I’m a-comin’, an’ I’m shorely gwine to get yer!\nYou heah me, Mr. Pocket? I’m gwine to get yer as shore as punkins ain’t\ncauliflowers!”",
        "He turned and flung a measuring glance at the sun poised above him in\nthe azure of the cloudless sky. Then he went down the canyon, following\nthe line of shovel-holes he had made in filling the pans. He crossed the\nstream below the pool and disappeared through the green screen. There\nwas little opportunity for the spirit of the place to return with its\nquietude and repose, for the man’s voice, raised in ragtime song, still\ndominated the canyon with possession.",
        "After a time, with a greater clashing of steel-shod feet on rock, he\nreturned. The green screen was tremendously agitated. It surged back and\nforth in the throes of a struggle. There was a loud grating and clanging\nof metal. The man’s voice leaped to a higher pitch and was sharp with\nimperativeness. A large body plunged and panted. There was a snapping\nand ripping and rending, and amid a shower of falling leaves a horse\nburst through the screen. On its back was a pack, and from this trailed\nbroken vines and torn creepers. The animal gazed with astonished eyes at\nthe scene into which it had been precipitated, then dropped its head to\nthe grass and began contentedly to graze. A second horse scrambled into\nview, slipping once on the mossy rocks and regaining equilibrium when\nits hoofs sank into the yielding surface of the meadow. It was\nriderless, though on its back was a high-horned Mexican saddle, scarred\nand discolored by long usage.",
        "The man brought up the rear. He threw off pack and saddle, with an eye\nto camp location, and gave the animals their freedom to graze. He\nunpacked his food and got out frying-pan and coffee-pot. He gathered an\narmful of dry wood, and with a few stones made a place for his fire.",
        "“My!” he said, “but I’ve got an appetite. I could scoff iron-filings an’\nhorseshoe nails an’ thank you kindly, ma’am, for a second helpin’.”",
        "He straightened up, and, while he reached for matches in the pocket of\nhis overalls, his eyes traveled across the pool to the side-hill. His\nfingers had clutched the match-box, but they relaxed their hold and the\nhand came out empty. The man wavered perceptibly. He looked at his\npreparations for cooking and he looked at the hill.",
        "“Guess I’ll take another whack at her,” he concluded, starting to cross\nthe stream.",
        "“They ain’t no sense in it, I know,” he mumbled apologetically. “But\nkeepin’ grub back an hour ain’t go in’ to hurt none, I reckon.”",
        "A few feet back from his first line of test-pans he started a second\nline. The sun dropped down the western sky, the shadows lengthened, but\nthe man worked on. He began a third line of test-pans. He was\ncross-cutting the hillside, line by line, as he ascended. The center of\neach line produced the richest pans, while the ends came where no colors\nshowed in the pan. And as he ascended the hillside the lines grew\nperceptibly shorter. The regularity with which their length diminished\nserved to indicate that somewhere up the slope the last line would be so\nshort as to have scarcely length at all, and that beyond could come\nonly a point. The design was growing into an inverted “V.” The\nconverging sides of this “V” marked the boundaries of the gold-bearing\ndirt.",
        "The apex of the “V” was evidently the man’s goal. Often he ran his eye\nalong the converging sides and on up the hill, trying to divine the\napex, the point where the gold-bearing dirt must cease. Here resided\n\"Mr. Pocket\"–for so the man familiarly addressed the imaginary point\nabove him on the slope, crying out:",
        "“Come down out o’ that, Mr. Pocket! Be right smart an’ agreeable, an’\ncome down!”",
        "“All right,” he would add later, in a voice resigned to determination.\n\"All right, Mr. Pocket. It’s plain to me I got to come right up an’\nsnatch you out bald-headed. An’ I’ll do it! I’ll do it!” he would\nthreaten still later.",
        "Each pan he carried down to the water to wash, and as he went higher up\nthe hill the pans grew richer, until he began to save the gold in an\nempty baking powder can which he carried carelessly in his hip-pocket.\nSo engrossed was he in his toil that he did not notice the long twilight\nof oncoming night. It was not until he tried vainly to see the gold\ncolors in the bottom of the pan that he realized the passage of time.\nHe straightened up abruptly. An expression of whimsical wonderment and\nawe overspread his face as he drawled:",
        "“Gosh darn my buttons! if I didn’t plumb forget dinner!”",
        "He stumbled across the stream in the darkness and lighted his\nlong-delayed fire. Flapjacks and bacon and warmed-over beans constituted\nhis supper. Then he smoked a pipe by the smouldering coals, listening to\nthe night noises and watching the moonlight stream through the canyon.\nAfter that he unrolled his bed, took off his heavy shoes, and pulled the\nblankets up to his chin. His face showed white in the moonlight, like\nthe face of a corpse. But it was a corpse that knew its resurrection,\nfor the man rose suddenly on one elbow and gazed across at his hillside.",
        "“Good night, Mr. Pocket,” he called sleepily. “Goodnight.”",
        "He slept through the early gray of morning until the direct rays of the\nsun smote his closed eyelids, when he awoke with a start and looked\nabout him until he had established the continuity of his existence and\nidentified his present self with the days previously lived.",
        "To dress, he had merely to buckle on his shoes. He glanced at his\nfireplace and at his hillside, wavered, but fought down the temptation\nand started the fire.",
        "“Keep yer shirt on, Bill; keep yer shirt on,” he admonished himself.\n\"What’s the good of rushin’? No use in gettin’ all het up an’ sweaty.\nMr. Pocket’ll wait for you. He ain’t a-runnin’ away before you can get\nyour breakfast. Now, what you want, Bill, is something fresh in yer bill\no’ fare. So it’s up to you to go an’ get it.”",
        "He cut a short pole at the water’s edge and drew from one of his pockets\na bit of line and a draggled fly that had once been a royal coachman.",
        "“Mebbe they’ll bite in the early morning,” he muttered, as he made his\nfirst cast into the pool. And a moment later he was gleefully crying:\n\"What’d I tell you, eh? What’d I tell you?”",
        "He had no reel, nor any inclination to waste time, and by main strength,\nand swiftly, he drew out of the water a flashing ten-inch trout. Three\nmore, caught in rapid succession, furnished his breakfast. When he came\nto the stepping-stones on his way to his hillside, he was struck by a\nsudden thought, and paused.",
        "“I’d just better take a hike down-stream a ways,” he said. “There’s no\ntellin’ who may be snoopin’ around.”",
        "But he crossed over on the stones, and with a “I really oughter take\nthat hike,” the need of the precaution passed out of his mind and he\nfell to work.",
        "At nightfall he straightened up. The small of his back was stiff from\nstooping toil, and as he put his hand behind him to soothe the\nprotesting muscles, he said:",
        "“Now what d’ye think of that? I clean forgot my dinner again! If I don’t\nwatch out, I’ll sure be degeneratin’ into a two-meal-a-day crank.”",
        "“Pockets is the hangedest things I ever see for makin’ a man\nabsent-minded,” he communed that night, as he crawled into his blankets.\nNor did he forget to call up the hillside, “Good night, Mr. Pocket! Good\nnight!”",
        "Rising with the sun, and snatching a hasty breakfast, he was early at\nwork. A fever seemed to be growing in him, nor did the increasing\nrichness of the test-pans allay this fever. There was a flush in his\ncheek other than that made by the heat of the sun, and he was oblivious\nto fatigue and the passage of time. When he filled a pan with dirt, he\nran down the hill to wash it; nor could he forbear running up the hill\nagain, panting and stumbling profanely, to refill the pan.",
        "He was now a hundred yards from the water, and the inverted “V” was\nassuming definite proportions. The width of the pay-dirt steadily\ndecreased, and the man extended in his mind’s eye the sides of the “V\"\nto their meeting place far up the hill. This was his goal, the apex of\nthe “V,” and he panned many times to locate it.",
        "“Just about two yards above that manzanita bush an’ a yard to the\nright,” he finally concluded.",
        "Then the temptation seized him. “As plain as the nose on your face,” he\nsaid, as he abandoned his laborious cross-cutting and climbed to the\nindicated apex. He filled a pan and carried it down the hill to wash. It\ncontained no trace of gold. He dug deep, and he dug shallow, filling\nand washing a dozen pans, and was unrewarded even by the tiniest golden\nspeck. He was enraged at having yielded to the temptation, and berated\nhimself blasphemously and pridelessly. Then he went down the hill and\ntook up the cross-cutting.",
        "“Slow an’ certain, Bill; slow an’ certain,” he crooned. “Short-cuts to\nfortune ain’t in your line, an’ it’s about time you know it. Get wise,\nBill; get wise. Slow an’ certain’s the only hand you can play; so go to\nit, an’ keep to it, too.”",
        "As the cross-cuts decreased, showing that the sides of the “V” were\nconverging, the depth of the “V” increased. The gold-trace was dipping\ninto the hill. It was only at thirty inches beneath the surface that he\ncould get colors in his pan. The dirt he found at twenty-five inches\nfrom the surface, and at thirty-five inches yielded barren pans. At the\nbase of the “V,” by the water’s edge, he had found the gold colors at\nthe grass roots. The higher he went up the hill, the deeper the gold\ndipped. To dig a hole three feet deep in order to get one test-pan was a\ntask of no mean magnitude; while between the man and the apex intervened\nan untold number of such holes to be dug. “An’ there’s no tellin’ how\nmuch deeper it’ll pitch,” he sighed, in a moment’s pause, while his\nfingers soothed his aching back.",
        "Feverish with desire, with aching back and stiffening muscles, with pick\nand shovel gouging and mauling the soft brown earth, the man toiled up\nthe hill. Before him was the smooth slope, spangled with flowers and\nmade sweet with their breath. Behind him was devastation. It looked like\nsome terrible eruption breaking out on the smooth skin of the hill. His\nslow progress was like that of a slug, befouling beauty with a monstrous\ntrail.",
        "Though the dipping gold-trace increased the man’s work, he found\nconsolation in the increasing richness of the pans. Twenty cents, thirty\ncents, fifty cents, sixty cents, were the values of the gold found in\nthe pans, and at nightfall he washed his banner pan, which gave him a\ndollar’s worth of gold-dust from a shovelful of dirt.",
        "“I’ll just bet it’s my luck to have some inquisitive one come buttin’ in\nhere on my pasture,” he mumbled sleepily that night as he pulled the\nblankets up to his chin.",
        "Suddenly he sat upright. “Bill!” he called sharply. “Now, listen to me,\nBill; d’ye hear! It’s up to you, to-morrow mornin’, to mosey round an’\nsee what you can see. Understand? To-morrow morning, an’ don’t you\nforget it!”",
        "He yawned and glanced across at his side-hill. “Good night, Mr. Pocket,\"\nhe called.",
        "In the morning he stole a march on the sun, for he had finished\nbreakfast when its first rays caught him, and he was climbing the wall\nof the canyon where it crumbled away and gave footing. From the outlook\nat the top he found himself in the midst of loneliness. As far as he\ncould see, chain after chain of mountains heaved themselves into his\nvision. To the east his eyes, leaping the miles between range and range\nand between many ranges, brought up at last against the white-peaked\nSierras–the main crest, where the backbone of the Western world reared\nitself against the sky. To the north and south he could see more\ndistinctly the cross-systems that broke through the main trend of the\nsea of mountains. To the west the ranges fell away, one behind the\nother, diminishing and fading into the gentle foothills that, in turn,\ndescended into the great valley which he could not see.",
        "And in all that mighty sweep of earth he saw no sign of man nor of the\nhandiwork of man–save only the torn bosom of the hillside at his feet.\nThe man looked long and carefully. Once, far down his own canyon, he\nthought he saw in the air a faint hint of smoke. He looked again and\ndecided that it was the purple haze of the hills made dark by a\nconvolution of the canyon wall at its back.",
        "“Hey, you, Mr. Pocket!” he called down into the canyon. “Stand out from\nunder! I’m a-comin’, Mr. Pocket! I’m a-comin’!”",
        "The heavy brogans on the man’s feet made him appear clumsy-footed, but\nhe swung down from the giddy height as lightly and airily as a mountain\ngoat. A rock, turning under his foot on the edge of the precipice, did\nnot disconcert him. He seemed to know the precise time required for the\nturn to culminate in disaster, and in the meantime he utilized the false\nfooting itself for the momentary earth-contact necessary to carry him on\ninto safety. Where the earth sloped so steeply that it was impossible to\nstand for a second upright, the man did not hesitate. His foot pressed\nthe impossible surface for but a fraction of the fatal second and gave\nhim the bound that carried him onward. Again, where even the fraction\nof a second’s footing was out of the question, he would swing his body\npast by a moment’s hand-grip on a jutting knob of rock, a crevice, or a\nprecariously rooted shrub. At last, with a wild leap and yell, he\nexchanged the face of the wall for an earth-slide and finished the\ndescent in the midst of several tons of sliding earth and gravel.",
        "His first pan of the morning washed out over two dollars in coarse gold.\nIt was from the centre of the “V.” To either side the diminution in the\nvalues of the pans was swift. His lines of cross-cutting holes were\ngrowing very short. The converging sides of the inverted “V” were only a\nfew yards apart. Their meeting-point was only a few yards above him. But\nthe pay-streak was dipping deeper and deeper into the earth. By early\nafternoon he was sinking the test-holes five feet before the pans could\nshow the gold-trace.",
        "For that matter, the gold-trace had become something more than a trace;\nit was a placer mine in itself, and the man resolved to come back after\nhe had found the pocket and work over the ground. But the increasing\nrichness of the pans began to worry him. By late afternoon the worth of\nthe pans had grown to three and four dollars. The man scratched his head\nperplexedly and looked a few feet up the hill at the manzanita bush that\nmarked approximately the apex of the “V.” He nodded his head and said\noracularly:",
        "“It’s one o’ two things, Bill: one o’ two things. Either Mr. Pocket’s\nspilled himself all out an’ down the hill, or else Mr. Pocket’s so rich\nyou maybe won’t be able to carry him all away with you. And that’d be an\nawful shame, wouldn’t it, now?” He chuckled at contemplation of so\npleasant a dilemma.",
        "Nightfall found him by the edge of the stream, his eyes wrestling with\nthe gathering darkness over the washing of a five-dollar pan.",
        "“Wisht I had an electric light to go on working,” he said.",
        "He found sleep difficult that night. Many times he composed himself and\nclosed his eyes for slumber to overtake him; but his blood pounded with\ntoo strong desire, and as many times his eyes opened and he murmured\nwearily, “Wisht it was sun-up.”",
        "Sleep came to him in the end, but his eyes were open with the first\npaling of the stars, and the gray of dawn caught him with breakfast\nfinished and climbing the hillside in the direction of the secret\nabiding-place of Mr. Pocket.",
        "The first cross-cut the man made, there was space for only three holes,\nso narrow had become the pay-streak and so close was he to the\nfountainhead of the golden stream he had been following for four days.",
        "“Be ca’m, Bill; be ca’m,” he admonished himself, as he broke ground for\nthe final hole where the sides of the “V” had at last come together in a\npoint.",
        "“I’ve got the almighty cinch on you, Mr. Pocket, an’ you can’t lose me,\"\nhe said many times as he sank the hole deeper and deeper.",
        "Four feet, five feet, six feet, he dug his way down into the earth. The\ndigging grew harder. His pick grated on broken rock. He examined the\nrock. “Rotten quartz,” was his conclusion as, with the shovel, he\ncleared the bottom of the hole of loose dirt. He attacked the crumbling\nquartz with the pick, bursting the disintegrating rock asunder with\nevery stroke.",
        "He thrust his shovel into the loose mass. His eye caught a gleam of\nyellow. He dropped the shovel and squatted suddenly on his heels. As a\nfarmer rubs the clinging earth from fresh-dug potatoes, so the man, a\npiece of rotten quartz held in both hands, rubbed the dirt away.",
        "“Sufferin’ Sardanopolis!” he cried. “Lumps an’ chunks of it! Lumps an’\nchunks of it!”",
        "It was only half rock he held in his hand. The other half was virgin\ngold. He dropped it into his pan and examined another piece. Little\nyellow was to be seen, but with his strong fingers he crumbled the\nrotten quartz away till both hands were filled with glowing yellow. He\nrubbed the dirt away from fragment after fragment, tossing them into the\ngold-pan. It was a treasure-hole. So much had the quartz rotted away\nthat there was less of it than there was of gold. Now and again he found\na piece to which no rock clung–a piece that was all gold. A chunk,\nwhere the pick had laid open the heart of the gold, glittered like a\nhandful of yellow jewels, and he cocked his head at it and slowly turned\nit around and over to observe the rich play of the light upon it.",
        "“Talk about yer Too Much Gold diggin’s!” the man snorted contemptuously.\n\"Why, this diggin’ ’d make it look like thirty cents. This diggin’ is\nAll Gold. An’ right here an’ now I name this yere canyon ’All Gold\nCanyon,’ b’ gosh!”",
        "Still squatting on his heels, he continued examining the fragments and\ntossing them into the pan. Suddenly there came to him a premonition of\ndanger. It seemed a shadow had fallen upon him. But there was no shadow.\nHis heart had given a great jump up into his throat and was choking him.\nThen his blood slowly chilled and he felt the sweat of his shirt cold\nagainst his flesh.",
        "He did not spring up nor look around. He did not move. He was\nconsidering the nature of the premonition he had received, trying to\nlocate the source of the mysterious force that had warned him, striving\nto sense the imperative presence of the unseen thing that threatened\nhim. There is an aura of things hostile, made manifest by messengers too\nrefined for the senses to know; and this aura he felt, but knew not how\nhe felt it. His was the feeling as when a cloud passes over the sun. It\nseemed that between him and life had passed something dark and\nsmothering and menacing; a gloom, as it were, that swallowed up life and\nmade for death–his death.",
        "Every force of his being impelled him to spring up and confront the\nunseen danger, but his soul dominated the panic, and he remained\nsquatting on his heels, in his hands a chunk of gold. He did not dare to\nlook around, but he knew by now that there was something behind him and\nabove him. He made believe to be interested in the gold in his hand. He\nexamined it critically, turned it over and over, and rubbed the dirt\nfrom it. And all the time he knew that something behind him was looking\nat the gold over his shoulder.",
        "Still feigning interest in the chunk of gold in his hand, he listened\nintently and he heard the breathing of the thing behind him. His eyes\nsearched the ground in front of him for a weapon, but they saw only the\nuprooted gold, worthless to him now in his extremity. There was his\npick, a handy weapon on occasion; but this was not such an occasion. The\nman realized his predicament. He was in a narrow hole that was seven\nfeet deep. His head did not come to the surface of the ground. He was in\na trap.",
        "He remained squatting on his heels. He was quite cool and collected; but\nhis mind, considering every factor, showed him only his helplessness.\nHe continued rubbing the dirt from the quartz fragments and throwing the\ngold into the pan. There was nothing else for him to do. Yet he knew\nthat he would have to rise up, sooner or later, and face the danger that\nbreathed at his back. The minutes passed, and with the passage of each\nminute he knew that by so much he was nearer the time when he must stand\nup, or else–and his wet shirt went cold against his flesh again at the\nthought–or else he might receive death as he stooped there over his\ntreasure.",
        "Still he squatted on his heels, rubbing dirt from gold and debating in\njust what manner he should rise up. He might rise up with a rush and\nclaw his way out of the hole to meet whatever threatened on the even\nfooting above ground. Or he might rise up slowly and carelessly, and\nfeign casually to discover the thing that breathed at his back. His\ninstinct and every fighting fibre of his body favored the mad, clawing\nrush to the surface. His intellect, and the craft thereof, favored the\nslow and cautious meeting with the thing that menaced and which he could\nnot see. And while he debated, a loud, crashing noise burst on his ear.\nAt the same instant he received a stunning blow on the left side of the\nback, and from the point of impact felt a rush of flame through his\nflesh. He sprang up in the air, but halfway to his feet collapsed. His\nbody crumpled in like a leaf withered in sudden heat, and he came down,\nhis chest across his pan of gold, his face in the dirt and rock, his\nlegs tangled and twisted because of the restricted space at the bottom\nof the hole. His legs twitched convulsively several times. His body was\nshaken as with a mighty ague. There was a slow expansion of the lungs,\naccompanied by a deep sigh. Then the air was slowly, very slowly,\nexhaled, and his body as slowly flattened itself down into inertness.",
        "Above, revolver in hand, a man was peering down over the edge of the\nhole. He peered for a long time at the prone and motionless body beneath\nhim. After a while the stranger sat down on the edge of the hole so that\nhe could see into it, and rested the revolver on his knee. Reaching his\nhand into a pocket, he drew out a wisp of brown paper. Into this he\ndropped a few crumbs of tobacco. The combination became a cigarette,\nbrown and squat, with the ends turned in. Not once did he take his eyes\nfrom the body at the bottom of the hole. He lighted the cigarette and\ndrew its smoke into his lungs with a caressing intake of the breath. He\nsmoked slowly. Once the cigarette went out and he relighted it. And all\nthe while he studied the body beneath him.",
        "In the end he tossed the cigarette stub away and rose to his feet. He\nmoved to the edge of the hole. Spanning it, a hand resting on each edge,\nand with the revolver still in the right hand, he muscled his body down\ninto the hole. While his feet were yet a yard from the bottom he\nreleased his hands and dropped down.",
        "At the instant his feet struck bottom he saw the pocket-miner’s arm leap\nout, and his own legs knew a swift, jerking grip that overthrew him. In\nthe nature of the jump his revolver hand was above his head. Swiftly as\nthe grip had flashed about his legs, just as swiftly he brought the\nrevolver down. He was still in the air, his fall in process of\ncompletion, when he pulled the trigger. The explosion was deafening in\nthe confined space. The smoke filled the hole so that he could see\nnothing. He struck the bottom on his back, and like a cat’s the\npocket-miner’s body was on top of him. Even as the miner’s body passed\non top, the stranger crooked in his right arm to fire; and even in that\ninstant the miner, with a quick thrust of elbow, struck his wrist. The\nmuzzle was thrown up and the bullet thudded into the dirt of the side of\nthe hole.",
        "The next instant the stranger felt the miner’s hand grip his wrist. The\nstruggle was now for the revolver. Each man strove to turn it against\nthe other’s body. The smoke in the hole was clearing. The stranger,\nlying on his back, was beginning to see dimly. But suddenly he was\nblinded by a handful of dirt deliberately flung into his eyes by his\nantagonist. In that moment of shock his grip on the revolver was broken.\nIn the next moment he felt a smashing darkness descend upon his brain,\nand in the midst of the darkness even the darkness ceased.",
        "But the pocket-miner fired again and again, until the revolver was\nempty. Then he tossed it from him and, breathing heavily, sat down on\nthe dead man’s legs.",
        "The miner was sobbing and struggling for breath. “Measly skunk!” he\npanted; “a-campin’ on my trail an’ lettin’ me do the work, an’ then\nshootin’ me in the back!”",
        "He was half crying from anger and exhaustion. He peered at the face of\nthe dead man. It was sprinkled with loose dirt and gravel, and it was\ndifficult to distinguish the features.",
        "“Never laid eyes on him before,” the miner concluded his scrutiny. “Just\na common an’ ordinary thief, hang him! An’ he shot me in the back! He\nshot me in the back!”",
        "He opened his shirt and felt himself, front and back, on his left side.",
        "“Went clean through, and no harm done!” he cried jubilantly. “I’ll bet\nhe aimed all right all right; but he drew the gun over when he pulled\nthe trigger–the cur! But I fixed ’m! Oh, I fixed ’m!”",
        "His fingers were investigating the bullet-hole in his side, and a shade\nof regret passed over his face. “It’s goin’ to be stiffer’n hell,” he\nsaid. “An’ it’s up to me to get mended an’ get out o’here.”",
        "He crawled out of the hole and went down the hill to his camp. Half an\nhour later he returned, leading his pack-horse. His open shirt\ndisclosed the rude bandages with which he had dressed his wound. He was\nslow and awkward with his left-hand movements, but that did not prevent\nhis using the arm.",
        "The bight of the pack-rope under the dead man’s shoulders enabled him to\nheave the body out of the hole. Then he set to work gathering up his\ngold. He worked steadily for several hours, pausing often to rest his\nstiffening shoulder and to exclaim:",
        "“He shot me in the back, the measly skunk! He shot me in the back!”",
        "When his treasure was quite cleaned up and wrapped securely into a\nnumber of blanket-covered parcels, he made an estimate of its value.",
        "“Four hundred pounds, or I’m a Hottentot,” he concluded. “Say two\nhundred in quartz an’ dirt–that leaves two hundred pounds of gold.\nBill! Wake up! Two hundred pounds of gold! Forty thousand dollars! An’\nit’s yourn–all yourn!”",
        "He scratched his head delightedly and his fingers blundered into an\nunfamiliar groove. They quested along it for several inches. It was a\ncrease through his scalp where the second bullet had ploughed.",
        "He walked angrily over to the dead man.",
        "“You would, would you!” he bullied. “You would, eh? Well, I fixed you\ngood an’ plenty, an’ I’ll give you decent burial, too. That’s more’n\nyou’d have done for me.”",
        "He dragged the body to the edge of the hole and toppled it in. It struck\nthe bottom with a dull crash, on its side, the face twisted up to the\nlight. The miner peered down at it.",
        "“An’ you shot me in the back!” he said accusingly.",
        "With pick and shovel he filled the hole. Then he loaded the gold on his\nhorse. It was too great a load for the animal, and when he had gained\nhis camp he transferred part of it to his saddle-horse. Even so, he was\ncompelled to abandon a portion of his outfit–pick and shovel and\ngold-pan, extra food and cooking utensils, and divers odds and ends.",
        "The sun was at the zenith when the man forced the horses at the screen\nof vines and creepers. To climb the huge boulders the animals were\ncompelled to uprear and struggle blindly through the tangled mass of\nvegetation. Once the saddle-horse fell heavily and the man removed the\npack to get the animal on its feet. After it started on its way again\nthe man thrust his head out from among the leaves and peered up at the\nhillside.",
        "“The measly skunk!” he said, and disappeared.",
        "There was a ripping and tearing of vines and boughs. The trees surged\nback and forth, marking the passage of the animals through the midst of\nthem. There was a clashing of steel-shod hoofs on stone, and now and\nagain a sharp cry of command. Then the voice of the man was raised in\nsong:–",
        "   “Tu’n around an’ tu’n yo’ face\n   Untoe them sweet hills of grace\n     (D’ pow’rs of sin yo’ am scornin’!).\n   Look about an’ look aroun’\n   Fling yo’ sin-pack on d’ groun’\n     (Yo’-will meet wid d’ Lord in d’ mornin’!).”",
        "The song grew faint and fainter, and through the silence crept back the\nspirit of the place. The stream once more drowsed and whispered; the hum\nof the mountain bees rose sleepily. Down through the perfume-weighted\nair fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods. The butterflies\ndrifted in and out among the trees, and over all blazed the quiet\nsunshine. Only remained the hoof-marks in the meadow and the torn\nhillside to mark the boisterous trail of the life that had broken the\npeace of the place and passed on.",
        "Keesh lived long ago on the rim of the polar sea, was head man of his\nvillage through many and prosperous years, and died full of honors with\nhis name on the lips of men. So long ago did he live that only the old\nmen remember his name, his name and the tale, which they got from the\nold men before them, and which the old men to come will tell to their\nchildren and their children’s children down to the end of time. And the\nwinter darkness, when the north gales make their long sweep across the\nice-pack, and the air is filled with flying white, and no man may\nventure forth, is the chosen time for the telling of how Keesh, from the\npoorest igloo in the village, rose to power and place over them all.",
        "He was a bright boy, so the tale runs, healthy and strong, and he had\nseen thirteen suns, in their way of reckoning time. For each winter the\nsun leaves the land in darkness, and the next year a new sun returns so\nthat they may be warm again and look upon one another’s faces. The\nfather of Keesh had been a very brave man, but he had met his death in a\ntime of famine, when he sought to save the lives of his people by taking\nthe life of a great polar bear. In his eagerness he came to close\ngrapples with the bear, and his bones were crushed; but the bear had\nmuch meat on him and the people were saved. Keesh was his only son, and\nafter that Keesh lived alone with his mother. But the people are prone\nto forget, and they forgot the deed of his father; and he being but a\nboy, and his mother only a woman, they, too, were swiftly forgotten, and\nere long came to live in the meanest of all the igloos.",
        "It was at a council, one night, in the big igloo of Klosh-Kwan, the\nchief, that Keesh showed the blood that ran in his veins and the manhood\nthat stiffened his back. With the dignity of an elder, he rose to his\nfeet, and waited for silence amid the babble of voices.",
        "“It is true that meat be apportioned me and mine,” he said. “But it is\nofttimes old and tough, this meat, and, moreover, it has an unusual\nquantity of bones.”",
        "The hunters, grizzled and gray, and lusty and young, were aghast. The\nlike had never been known before. A child, that talked like a grown man,\nand said harsh things to their very faces!",
        "But steadily and with seriousness, Keesh went on. “For that I know my\nfather, Bok, was a great hunter, I speak these words. It is said that\nBok brought home more meat than any of the two best hunters, that with\nhis own hands he attended to the division of it, that with his own eyes\nhe saw to it that the least old woman and the least old man received\nfair share.”",
        "“Na! Na!” the men cried. “Put the child out!” “Send him off to bed!” “He\nis no man that he should talk to men and gray-beards!”",
        "He waited calmly till the uproar died down.",
        "“Thou hast a wife, Ugh-Gluk,” he said, “and for her dost thou speak. And\nthou, too, Massuk, a mother also, and for them dost thou speak. My\nmother has no one, save me; wherefore I speak. As I say, though Bok be\ndead because he hunted over-keenly, it is just that I, who am his son,\nand that Ikeega, who is my mother and was his wife, should have meat in\nplenty so long as there be meat in plenty in the tribe. I, Keesh, the\nson of Bok, have spoken.”",
        "He sat down, his ears keenly alert to the flood of protest and\nindignation his words had created.",
        "“That a boy should speak in council!” old Ugh-Gluk was mumbling.",
        "“Shall the babes in arms tell us men the things we shall do?” Massuk\ndemanded in a loud voice. “Am I a man that I should be made a mock by\nevery child that cries for meat?”",
        "The anger boiled a white heat. They ordered him to bed, threatened that\nhe should have no meat at all, and promised him sore beatings for his\npresumption. Keesh’s eyes began to flash, and the blood to pound darkly\nunder his skin. In the midst of the abuse he sprang to his feet.",
        "“Hear me, ye men!” he cried. “Never shall I speak in the council again,\nnever again till the men come to me and say, ’It is well, Keesh, that\nthou shouldst speak, it is well and it is our wish.’ Take this now, ye\nmen, for my last word. Bok, my father, was a great hunter. I too, his\nson, shall go and hunt the meat that I eat. And be it known, now, that\nthe division of that which I kill shall be fair. And no widow nor weak\none shall cry in the night because there is no meat, when the strong men\nare groaning in great pain for that they have eaten overmuch. And in the\ndays to come there shall be shame upon the strong men who have eaten\novermuch. I, Keesh, have said it!”",
        "Jeers and scornful laughter followed him out of the igloo, but his jaw\nwas set and he went his way, looking neither to right nor left.",
        "The next day he went forth along the shoreline where the ice and the\nland met together. Those who saw him go noted that he carried his bow,\nwith a goodly supply of bone-barbed arrows, and that across his shoulder\nwas his father’s big hunting-spear. And there was laughter, and much\ntalk, at the event. It was an unprecedented occurrence. Never did boys\nof his tender age go forth to hunt, much less to hunt alone. Also were\nthere shaking of heads and prophetic mutterings, and the women looked\npityingly at Ikeega, and her face was grave and sad.",
        "“He will be back ere long,” they said cheeringly.",
        "“Let him go; it will teach him a lesson,” the hunters said. “And he will\ncome back shortly, and he will be meek and soft of speech in the days to\nfollow.”",
        "But a day passed, and a second, and on the third a wild gale blew, and\nthere was no Keesh. Ikeega tore her hair and put soot of the seal-oil on\nher face in token of her grief; and the women assailed the men with\nbitter words in that they had mistreated the boy and sent him to his\ndeath; and the men made no answer, preparing to go in search of the body\nwhen the storm abated.",
        "Early next morning, however, Keesh strode into the village. But he came\nnot shamefacedly. Across his shoulders he bore a burden of fresh-killed\nmeat. And there was importance in his step and arrogance in his speech.",
        "“Go, ye men, with the dogs and sledges, and take my trail for the better\npart of a day’s travel,” he said. “There is much meat on the ice–a\nshe-bear and two half-grown cubs.”",
        "Ikeega was overcome with joy, but he received her demonstrations in\nmanlike fashion, saying: “Come, Ikeega, let us eat. And after that I\nshall sleep, for I am weary.”",
        "And he passed into their igloo and ate profoundly, and after that\nslept for twenty running hours.",
        "There was much doubt at first, much doubt and discussion. The killing of\na polar bear is very dangerous, but thrice dangerous is it, and three\ntimes thrice, to kill a mother bear with her cubs. The men could not\nbring themselves to believe that the boy Keesh, single-handed, had\naccomplished so great a marvel. But the women spoke of the fresh-killed\nmeat he had brought on his back, and this was an overwhelming argument\nagainst their unbelief. So they finally departed, grumbling greatly that\nin all probability, if the thing were so, he had neglected to cut up the\ncarcasses. Now in the north it is very necessary that this should be\ndone as soon as a kill is made. If not, the meat freezes so solidly as\nto turn the edge of the sharpest knife, and a three-hundred-pound bear,\nfrozen stiff, is no easy thing to put upon a sled and haul over the\nrough ice. But arrived at the spot, they found not only the kill which\nthey had doubted, but that Keesh had quartered the beasts in true hunter\nfashion, and removed the entrails.",
        "Thus began the mystery of Keesh, a mystery that deepened and deepened\nwith the passing of the days. His very next trip he killed a young bear,\nnearly full-grown, and on the trip following, a large male bear and his\nmate. He was ordinarily gone from three to four days, though it was\nnothing unusual for him to stay away a week at a time on the ice-field.\nAlways he declined company on these expeditions, and the people\nmarveled. “How does he do it?” they demanded of one another. “Never does\nhe take a dog with him, and dogs are of such great help, too.”",
        "“Why dost thou hunt only bear?” Klosh-Kwan once ventured to ask.",
        "And Keesh made fitting answer. “It is well known that there is more meat\non the bear,” he said.",
        "But there was also talk of witchcraft in the village. “He hunts with\nevil spirits,” some of the people contended, “wherefore his hunting is\nrewarded. How else can it be, save that he hunts with evil spirits?”",
        "“Mayhap they be not evil, but good, these spirits,” others said. “It is\nknown that his father was a mighty hunter. May not his father hunt with\nhim so that he may attain excellence and patience and understanding? Who\nknows?”",
        "None the less, his success continued, and the less skilful hunters were\noften kept busy hauling in his meat. And in the division of it he was\njust. As his father had done before him, he saw to it that the least old\nwoman and the last old man received a fair portion, keeping no more for\nhimself than his needs required. And because of this, and of his merit\nas a hunter, he was looked upon with respect, and even awe; and there\nwas talk of making him chief after old Klosh-Kwan. Because of the things\nhe had done, they looked for him to appear again in the council, but he\nnever came, and they were ashamed to ask.",
        "“I am minded to build me an igloo,” he said one day to Klosh-Kwan and\na number of the hunters. “It shall be a large igloo, wherein Ikeega\nand I can dwell in comfort.”",
        "“Ay,” they nodded gravely.",
        "“But I have no time. By business is hunting, and it takes all my time.\nSo it is but just that the men and women of the village who eat my meat\nshould build me my igloo.”",
        "And the igloo was built accordingly, on a generous scale which\nexceeded even the dwelling of Klosh-Kwan. Keesh and his mother moved\ninto it, and it was the first prosperity she had enjoyed since the death\nof Bok. Nor was material prosperity alone hers, for, because of her\nwonderful son and the position he had given her, she came to be looked\nupon as the first woman in all the village; and the women were given to\nvisiting her, to asking her advice, and to quoting her wisdom when\narguments arose among themselves or with the men.",
        "But it was the mystery of Keesh’s marvelous hunting that took chief\nplace in all their minds. And one day Ugh-Gluk taxed him with witchcraft\nto his face.",
        "“It is charged,” Ugh-Gluk said ominously, “that thou dealest with evil\nspirits, wherefore thy hunting is rewarded.”",
        "“Is not the meat good?” Keesh made answer. “Has one in the village yet\nto fall sick from the eating of it! How dost thou know that witchcraft\nbe concerned? Or dost thou guess, in the dark, merely because of the\nenvy that consumes thee?”",
        "And Ugh-Gluk withdrew discomfited, the women laughing at him as he\nwalked away. But in the council one night, after long deliberation, it\nwas determined to put spies on his track when he went forth to hunt, so\nthat his methods might be learned. So, on his next trip, Bim and Bawn,\ntwo young men, and of hunters the craftiest, followed after him, taking\ncare not to be seen. After five days they returned, their eyes bulging\nand their tongues a-tremble to tell what they had seen. The council was\nhastily called in Klosh-Kwan’s dwelling, and Bim took up the tale.",
        "“Brothers! As commanded, we journeyed on the trail of Keesh, and\ncunningly we journeyed, so that he might not know. And midway of the\nfirst day he picked up with a great he-bear. It was a very great bear.”",
        "“None greater,” Bawn corroborated, and went on himself. “Yet was the\nbear not inclined to fight, for he turned away and made off slowly over\nthe ice. This we saw from the rocks of the shore, and the bear came\ntoward us, and after him came Keesh, very much unafraid. And he shouted\nharsh words after the bear, and waved his arms about, and made much\nnoise. Then did the bear grow angry, and rise up on his hind legs, and\ngrowl. But Keesh walked right up to the bear.”",
        "“Ay,” Bim continued the story. “Right up to the bear Keesh walked. And\nthe bear took after him, and Keesh ran away. But as he ran he dropped a\nlittle round ball on the ice. And the bear stopped and smelled of it,\nand then swallowed it up. And Keesh continued to run away and drop\nlittle round balls, and the bear continued to swallow them up.”",
        "Exclamations and cries of doubt were being made, and Ugh-Gluk expressed\nopen unbelief.",
        "“With our own eyes we saw it,” Bim affirmed.",
        "And Bawn–\"Ay, with our own eyes. And this continued until the bear\nstood suddenly upright and cried aloud in pain, and thrashed his\nforepaws madly about. And Keesh continued to make off over the ice to a\nsafe distance. But the bear gave him no notice, being occupied with the\nmisfortune the little round balls had wrought within him.”",
        "“Ay, within him,” Bim interrupted. “For he did claw at himself, and\nleap about over the ice like a playful puppy, save from the way he\ngrowled and squealed it was plain it was not play but pain. Never did I\nsee such a sight!”",
        "“Nay, never was such a sight seen,” Bawn took up the strain. “And\nfurthermore, it was such a large bear.”",
        "“Witchcraft,” Ugh-Gluk suggested.",
        "“I know not,” Bawn replied. “I tell only of what my eyes beheld. And\nafter a while the bear grew weak and tired, for he was very heavy and he\nhad jumped about with exceeding violence, and he went off along the\nshore-ice, shaking his head slowly from side to side and sitting down\never and again to squeal and cry. And Keesh followed after the bear, and\nwe followed after Keesh, and for that day and three days more we\nfollowed. The bear grew weak, and never ceased crying from his pain.”",
        "“It was a charm!” Ugh-Gluk exclaimed. “Surely it was a charm!”",
        "“It may well be.”",
        "And Bim relieved Bawn. “The bear wandered, now this way and now that,\ndoubling back and forth and crossing his trail in circles, so that at\nthe end he was near where Keesh had first come upon him. By this time he\nwas quite sick, the bear, and could crawl no farther, so Keesh came up\nclose and speared him to death.”",
        "“And then?” Klosh-Kwan demanded.",
        "“Then we left Keesh skinning the bear, and came running that the news of\nthe killing might be told.”",
        "And in the afternoon of that day the women hauled in the meat of the\nbear while the men sat in council assembled. When Keesh arrived a\nmessenger was sent to him, bidding him come to the council. But he sent\nreply, saying that he was hungry and tired; also that his igloo was\nlarge and comfortable and could hold many men.",
        "And curiosity was so strong on the men that the whole council,\nKlosh-Kwan to the fore, rose up and went to the igloo of Keesh. He was\neating, but he received them with respect and seated them according to\ntheir rank. Ikeega was proud and embarrassed by turns, but Keesh was\nquite composed.",
        "Klosh-Kwan recited the information brought by Bim and Bawn, and at its\nclose said in a stern voice: “So explanation is wanted, O Keesh, of thy\nmanner of hunting. Is there witchcraft in it?”",
        "Keesh looked up and smiled. “Nay, O Klosh-Kwan. It is not for a boy to\nknow aught of witches, and of witches I know nothing. I have but devised\na means whereby I may kill the ice-bear with ease, that is all. It be\nheadcraft, not witchcraft.”",
        "“And may any man?”",
        "“Any man.”",
        "There was a long silence. The men looked in one another’s faces, and\nKeesh went on eating.",
        "“And ... and ... and wilt thou tell us, O Keesh?” Klosh-Kwan finally\nasked in a tremulous voice.",
        "“Yea, I will tell thee.” Keesh finished sucking a marrow-bone and rose\nto his feet. “It is quite simple. Behold!”",
        "He picked up a thin strip of whalebone and showed it to them. The ends\nwere sharp as needle-points. The strip he coiled carefully, till it\ndisappeared in his hand. Then, suddenly releasing it, it sprang straight\nagain. He picked up a piece of blubber.",
        "“So,” he said, “one takes a small chunk of blubber, thus, and thus makes\nit hollow. Then into the hollow goes the whalebone, so, tightly coiled,\nand another piece of blubber is fitted over the whalebone. After that it\nis put outside where it freezes into a little round ball. The bear\nswallows the little round ball, the blubber melts, the whalebone with\nits sharp ends stands out straight, the bear gets sick, and when the\nbear is very sick, why, you kill him with a spear. It is quite simple.”",
        "And Ugh-Gluk said “Oh!” and Klosh-Kwan said “Ah!” And each said\nsomething after his own manner, and all understood.",
        "And this is the story of Keesh, who lived long ago on the rim of the\npolar sea. Because he exercised headcraft and not witchcraft, he rose\nfrom the meanest igloo to be head man of his village, and through all\nthe years that he lived, it is related, his tribe was prosperous, and\nneither widow nor weak one cried aloud in the night because there was no\nmeat.",
        "“A Bidarka, is it not so! Look! a bidarka, and one man who drives\nclumsily with a paddle!”",
        "Old Bask-Wah-Wan rose to her knees, trembling with weakness and\neagerness, and gazed out over the sea.",
        "“Nam-Bok was ever clumsy at the paddle,” she maundered reminiscently,\nshading the sun from her eyes and staring across the silver-spilled\nwater. “Nam-Bok was ever clumsy. I remember....”",
        "But the women and children laughed loudly, and there was a gentle\nmockery in their laughter, and her voice dwindled till her lips moved\nwithout sound.",
        "Koogah lifted his grizzled head from his bone-carving and followed the\npath of her eyes. Except when wide yawns took it off its course, a\nbidarka was heading in for the beach. Its occupant was paddling with\nmore strength than dexterity, and made his approach along the zigzag\nline of most resistance. Koogah’s head dropped to his work again, and on\nthe ivory tusk between his knees he scratched the dorsal fin of a fish\nthe like of which never swam in the sea.",
        "“It is doubtless the man from the next village,” he said finally, “come\nto consult with me about the marking of things on bone. And the man is a\nclumsy man. He will never know how.”",
        "“It is Nam-Bok,” old Bask-Wah-Wan repeated. “Should I not know my son!\"\nshe demanded shrilly. “I say, and I say again, it is Nam-Bok.”",
        "“And so thou hast said these many summers,” one of the women chided\nsoftly. “Ever when the ice passed out of the sea hast thou sat and\nwatched through the long day, saying at each chance canoe, ’This is\nNam-Bok.’ Nam-Bok is dead, O Bask-Wah-Wan, and the dead do not come\nback. It cannot be that the dead come back.”",
        "“Nam-Bok!” the old woman cried, so loud and clear that the whole\nvillage was startled and looked at her.",
        "She struggled to her feet and tottered down the sand. She stumbled over\na baby lying in the sun, and the mother hushed its crying and hurled\nharsh words after the old woman, who took no notice. The children ran\ndown the beach in advance of her, and as the man in the bidarka drew\ncloser, nearly capsizing with one of his ill-directed strokes, the women\nfollowed. Koogah dropped his walrus tusk and went also, leaning heavily\nupon his staff, and after him loitered the men in twos and threes.",
        "The bidarka turned broadside and the ripple of surf threatened to swamp\nit, only a naked boy ran into the water and pulled the bow high up on\nthe sand. The man stood up and sent a questing glance along the line of\nvillagers. A rainbow sweater, dirty and the worse for wear, clung\nloosely to his broad shoulders, and a red cotton handkerchief was\nknotted in sailor fashion about his throat. A fisherman’s tam-o’-shanter\non his close-clipped head, and dungaree trousers and heavy brogans\ncompleted his outfit.",
        "But he was none the less a striking personage to these simple\nfisherfolk of the great Yukon Delta, who, all their lives, had stared\nout on Bering Sea and in that time seen but two white men,–the census\nenumerator and a lost Jesuit priest. They were a poor people, with\nneither gold in the ground nor valuable furs in hand, so the whites had\npassed them afar. Also, the Yukon, through the thousands of years, had\nshoaled that portion of the sea with the detritus of Alaska till vessels\ngrounded out of sight of land. So the sodden coast, with its long inside\nreaches and huge mud-land archipelagoes, was avoided by the ships of\nmen, and the fisherfolk knew not that such things were.",
        "Koogah, the Bone-Scratcher, retreated backward in sudden haste, tripping\nover his staff and falling to the ground. “Nam-Bok!” he cried, as he\nscrambled wildly for footing. “Nam-Bok, who was blown off to sea, come\nback!”",
        "The men and women shrank away, and the children scuttled off between\ntheir legs. Only Opee-Kwan was brave, as befitted the head man of the\nvillage. He strode forward and gazed long and earnestly at the newcomer.",
        "“It is Nam-Bok,” he said at last, and at the conviction in his voice\nthe women wailed apprehensively and drew farther away.",
        "The lips of the stranger moved indecisively, and his brown throat\nwrithed and wrestled with unspoken words.",
        "“La, la, it is Nam-Bok,” Bask-Wah-Wan croaked, peering up into his face.\n\"Ever did I say Nam-Bok would come back.”",
        "“Ay, it is Nam-Bok come back.” This time it was Nam-Bok himself who\nspoke, putting a leg over the side of the bidarka and standing with one\nfoot afloat and one ashore. Again his throat writhed and wrestled as he\ngrappled after forgotten words. And when the words came forth they were\nstrange of sound and a spluttering of the lips accompanied the\ngutturals. “Greetings, O brothers,” he said, “brothers of old time\nbefore I went away with the off-shore wind.”",
        "He stepped out with both feet on the sand, and Opee-Kwan waved him back.",
        "“Thou art dead, Nam-Bok,” he said.",
        "Nam-Bok laughed. “I am fat.”",
        "“Dead men are not fat,” Opee-Kwan confessed. “Thou hast fared well, but\nit is strange. No man may mate with the off-shore wind and come back on\nthe heels of the years.”",
        "“I have come back,” Nam-Bok answered simply.",
        "“Mayhap thou art a shadow, then, a passing shadow of the Nam-Bok that\nwas. Shadows come back.”",
        "“I am hungry. Shadows do not eat.”",
        "But Opee-Kwan doubted, and brushed his hand across his brow in sore\npuzzlement. Nam-Bok was likewise puzzled, and as he looked up and down\nthe line found no welcome in the eyes of the fisherfolk. The men and\nwomen whispered together. The children stole timidly back among their\nelders, and bristling dogs fawned up to him and sniffed suspiciously.",
        "“I bore thee, Nam-Bok, and I gave thee suck when thou wast little,\"\nBask-Wah-Wan whimpered, drawing closer; “and shadow though thou be, or\nno shadow, I will give thee to eat now.”",
        "Nam-Bok made to come to her, but a growl of fear and menace warned him\nback. He said something angrily in a strange tongue, and added, “No\nshadow am I, but a man.”",
        "“Who may know concerning the things of mystery?” Opee-Kwan demanded,\nhalf of himself and half of his tribespeople. “We are, and in a breath\nwe are not. If the man may become shadow, may not the shadow become man?\nNam-Bok was, but is not. This we know, but we do not know if this be\nNam-Bok or the shadow of Nam-Bok.”",
        "Nam-Bok cleared his throat and made answer. “In the old time long ago,\nthy father’s father, Opee-Kwan, went away and came back on the heels of\nthe years. Nor was a place by the fire denied him. It is said ...” He\npaused significantly, and they hung on his utterance. “It is said,” he\nrepeated, driving his point home with deliberation, “that Sipsip, his\nklooch, bore him two sons after he came back.”",
        "“But he had no doings with the off-shore wind,” Opee-Kwan retorted. “He\nwent away into the heart of the land, and it is in the nature of things\nthat a man may go on and on into the land.”",
        "“And likewise the sea. But that is neither here nor there. It is said\n... that thy father’s father told strange tales of the things he saw.”",
        "“Ay, strange tales he told.”",
        "“I, too, have strange tales to tell,” Nam-Bok stated insidiously. And,\nas they wavered, “And presents likewise.”",
        "He pulled from the bidarka a shawl, marvelous of texture and color, and\nflung it about his mother’s shoulders. The women voiced a collective\nsigh of admiration, and old Bask-Wah-Wan ruffled the gay material and\npatted it and crooned in childish joy.",
        "“He has tales to tell,” Koogah muttered. “And presents,” a woman\nseconded.",
        "And Opee-Kwan knew that his people were eager, and further, he was aware\nhimself of an itching curiosity concerning those untold tales. “The\nfishing has been good,” he said judiciously, “and we have oil in plenty.\nSo come, Nam-Bok, let us feast.”",
        "Two of the men hoisted the bidarka on their shoulders and carried it up\nto the fire. Nam-Bok walked by the side of Opee-Kwan, and the villagers\nfollowed after, save those of the women who lingered a moment to lay\ncaressing fingers on the shawl.",
        "There was little talk while the feast went on, though many and curious\nwere the glances stolen at the son of Bask-Wah-Wan. This embarrassed\nhim–not because he was modest of spirit, however, but for the fact\nthat the stench of the seal-oil had robbed him of his appetite, and that\nhe keenly desired to conceal his feelings on the subject.",
        "“Eat; thou art hungry,” Opee-Kwan commanded, and Nam-Bok shut both his\neyes and shoved his fist into the big pot of putrid fish.",
        "“La la, be not ashamed. The seal were many this year, and strong men are\never hungry.” And Bask-Wah-Wan sopped a particularly offensive chunk of\nsalmon into the oil and passed it fondly and dripping to her son.",
        "In despair, when premonitory symptoms warned him that his stomach was\nnot so strong as of old, he filled his pipe and struck up a smoke. The\npeople fed on noisily and watched. Few of them could boast of intimate\nacquaintance with the precious weed, though now and again small\nquantities and abominable qualities were obtained in trade from the\nEskimos to the northward. Koogah, sitting next to him, indicated that he\nwas not averse to taking a draw, and between two mouthfuls, with the oil\nthick on his lips, sucked away at the amber stem. And thereupon Nam-Bok\nheld his stomach with a shaky hand and declined the proffered return.\nKoogah could keep the pipe, he said, for he had intended so to honor him\nfrom the first. And the people licked their fingers and approved of his\nliberality.",
        "Opee-Kwan rose to his feet. “And now, O Nam-Bok, the feast is ended, and\nwe would listen concerning the strange things you have seen.”",
        "The fisherfolk applauded with their hands, and gathering about them\ntheir work, prepared to listen. The men were busy fashioning spears and\ncarving on ivory, while the women scraped the fat from the hides of the\nhair seal and made them pliable or sewed muclucs with threads of sinew.\nNam-Bok’s eyes roved over the scene, but there was not the charm about\nit that his recollection had warranted him to expect. During the years\nof his wandering he had looked forward to just this scene, and now that\nit had come he was disappointed. It was a bare and meagre life, he\ndeemed, and not to be compared to the one to which he had become used.\nStill, he would open their eyes a bit, and his own eyes sparkled at the\nthought.",
        "“Brothers,” he began, with the smug complacency of a man about to relate\nthe big things he has done, “it was late summer of many summers back,\nwith much such weather as this promises to be, when I went away. You all\nremember the day, when the gulls flew low, and the wind blew strong from\nthe land, and I could not hold my bidarka against it. I tied the\ncovering of the bidarka about me so that no water could get in, and all\nof the night I fought with the storm. And in the morning there was no\nland,–only the sea,–and the off-shore wind held me close in its arms\nand bore me along. Three such nights whitened into dawn and showed me no\nland, and the off-shore wind would not let me go.",
        "“And when the fourth day came, I was as a madman. I could not dip my\npaddle for want of food; and my head went round and round, what of the\nthirst that was upon me. But the sea was no longer angry, and the soft\nsouth wind was blowing, and as I looked about me I saw a sight that made\nme think I was indeed mad.”",
        "Nam-Bok paused to pick away a sliver of salmon lodged between his teeth,\nand the men and women, with idle hands and heads craned forward, waited.",
        "“It was a canoe, a big canoe. If all the canoes I have ever seen were\nmade into one canoe, it would not be so large.”",
        "There were exclamations of doubt, and Koogah, whose years were many,\nshook his head.",
        "“If each bidarka were as a grain of sand,” Nam-Bok defiantly continued,\n\"and if there were as many bidarkas as there be grains of sand in this\nbeach, still would they not make so big a canoe as this I saw on the\nmorning of the fourth day. It was a very big canoe, and it was called a\nschooner. I saw this thing of wonder, this great schooner, coming\nafter me, and on it I saw men––”",
        "“Hold, O Nam-Bok!” Opee-Kwan broke in. “What manner of men were\nthey?–big men?”",
        "“Nay, mere men like you and me.”",
        "“Did the big canoe come fast?”",
        "“Ay.”",
        "“The sides were tall, the men short.” Opee-Kwan stated the premises with\nconviction. “And did these men dip with long paddles?”",
        "Nam-Bok grinned. “There were no paddles,” he said.",
        "Mouths remained open, and a long silence dropped down. Ope-Kwan\nborrowed Koogah’s pipe for a couple of contemplative sucks. One of the\nyounger women giggled nervously and drew upon herself angry eyes.",
        "“There were no paddles?” Opee-Kwan asked softly, returning the pipe.",
        "“The south wind was behind,” Nam-Bok explained.",
        "“But the wind drift is slow.”",
        "“The schooner had wings–thus.” He sketched a diagram of masts and sails\nin the sand, and the men crowded around and studied it. The wind was\nblowing briskly, and for more graphic elucidation he seized the corners\nof his mother’s shawl and spread them out till it bellied like a sail.\nBask Wah-Wan scolded and struggled, but was blown down the breach for a\nscore of feet and left breathless and stranded in a heap of driftwood.\nThe men uttered sage grunts of comprehension, but Koogah suddenly tossed\nback his hoary head.",
        "“Ho! Ho!” he laughed. “A foolish thing, this big canoe! A most foolish\nthing! The plaything of the wind! Wheresoever the wind goes, it goes\ntoo. No man who journeys therein may name the landing beach, for always\nhe goes with the wind, and the wind goes everywhere, but no man knows\nwhere.”",
        "“It is so,” Opee-Kwan supplemented gravely. “With the wind the going is\neasy, but against the wind a man striveth hard; and for that they had no\npaddles these men on the big canoe did not strive at all.”",
        "“Small need to strive,” Nam-Bok cried angrily. “The schooner went\nlikewise against the wind.”",
        "“And what said you made the sch–sch–schooner go?” Koogah asked,\ntripping craftily over the strange word.",
        "“The wind,” was the impatient response.",
        "“Then the wind made the sch–sch–schooner go against the wind.” Old\nKoogah dropped an open leer to Opee-Kwan, and, the laughter growing\naround him, continued: “The wind blows from the south and blows the\nschooner south. The wind blows against the wind. The wind blows one way\nand the other at the same time. It is very simple. We understand,\nNam-Bok. We clearly understand.”",
        "“Thou art a fool!”",
        "“Truth falls from thy lips,” Koogah answered meekly. “I was over-long\nin understanding, and the thing was simple.”",
        "But Nam-Bok’s face was dark, and he said rapid words which they had\nnever heard before. Bone-scratching and skin-scraping were resumed, but\nhe shut his lips tightly on the tongue that could not be believed.",
        "“This sch–sch–schooner,” Koogah imperturbably asked; “it was made of a\nbig tree?”",
        "“It was made of many trees,” Nam-Bok snapped shortly. “It was very big.”",
        "He lapsed into sullen silence again, and Opee-Kwan nudged Koogah, who\nshook his head with slow amazement and murmured, “It is very strange.”",
        "Nam-Bok took the bait. “That is nothing,” he said airily; “you should\nsee the steamer. As the grain of sand is to the bidarka, as the\nbidarka is to the schooner, so the schooner is to the steamer. Further,\nthe steamer is made of iron. It is all iron.”",
        "“Nay, nay, Nam-Bok,” cried the head man; “how can that be? Always iron\ngoes to the bottom. For behold, I received an iron knife in trade from\nthe head man of the next village, and yesterday the iron knife slipped\nfrom my fingers and went down, down, into the sea. To all things there\nbe law. Never was there one thing outside the law. This we know. And,\nmoreover, we know that things of a kind have the one law, and that all\niron has the one law. So unsay thy words, Nam-Bok, that we may yet honor\nthee.”",
        "“It is so,” Nam-Bok persisted. “The steamer is all iron and does not\nsink.”",
        "“Nay, nay; this cannot be.”",
        "“With my own eyes I saw it.”",
        "“It is not in the nature of things.”",
        "“But tell me, Nam-Bok,” Koogah interrupted, for fear the tale would go\nno farther, “tell me the manner of these men in finding their way across\nthe sea when there is no land by which to steer.”",
        "“The sun points out the path.”",
        "“But how?”",
        "“At midday the head man of the schooner takes a thing through which his\neye looks at the sun, and then he makes the sun climb down out of the\nsky to the edge of the earth.”",
        "“Now this be evil medicine!” cried Opee-Kwan, aghast at the sacrilege.\nThe men held up their hands in horror, and the women moaned. “This be\nevil medicine. It is not good to misdirect the great sun which drives\naway the night and gives us the seal, the salmon, and warm weather.”",
        "“What if it be evil medicine?” Nam-Bok demanded truculently. “I, too,\nhave looked through the thing at the sun and made the sun climb down out\nof the sky.”",
        "Those who were nearest drew away from him hurriedly, and a woman covered\nthe face of a child at her breast so that his eye might not fall upon\nit.",
        "“But on the morning of the fourth day, O Nam-Bok,” Koogah suggested; “on\nthe morning of the fourth day when the sch–sch–schooner came after\nthee?”",
        "“I had little strength left in me and could not run away. So I was taken\non board and water was poured down my throat and good food given me.\nTwice, my brothers, you have seen a white man. These men were all white\nand as many as have I fingers and toes. And when I saw they were full of\nkindness, I took heart, and I resolved to bring away with me report of\nall that I saw. And they taught me the work they did, and gave me good\nfood and a place to sleep.",
        "“And day after day we went over the sea, and each day the head man drew\nthe sun down out of the sky and made it tell where we were. And when the\nwaves were kind, we hunted the fur seal and I marvelled much, for always\ndid they fling the meat and the fat away and save only the skin.”",
        "Opee-Kwan’s mouth was twitching violently, and he was about to make\ndenunciation of such waste when Koogah kicked him to be still.",
        "“After a weary time, when the sun was gone and the bite of the frost\ncome into the air, the head man pointed the nose of the schooner south.\nSouth and east we traveled for days upon days, with never the land in\nsight, and we were near to the village from which hailed the men––”",
        "“How did they know they were near?” Opee-Kwan, unable to contain himself\nlonger, demanded. “There was no land to see.”",
        "Nam-Bok glowered on him wrathfully. “Did I not say the head man brought\nthe sun down out of the sky?”",
        "Koogah interposed, and Nam-Bok went on. “As I say, when we were near to\nthat village a great storm blew up, and in the night we were helpless\nand knew not where we were––”",
        "“Thou hast just said the head man knew––”",
        "“Oh, peace, Opee-Kwan. Thou art a fool and cannot understand. As I say,\nwe were helpless in the night, when I heard, above the roar of the\nstorm, the sound of the sea on the beach. And next we struck with a\nmighty crash and I was in the water, swimming. It was a rock-bound\ncoast, with one patch of beach in many miles, and the law was that I\nshould dig my hands into the sand and draw myself clear of the surf. The\nother men must have pounded against the rocks, for none of them came\nashore but the head man, and him I knew only by the ring on his finger.",
        "“When day came, there being nothing of the schooner, I turned my face to\nthe land and journeyed into it that I might get food and look upon the\nfaces of the people. And when I came to a house I was taken in and given\nto eat, for I had learned their speech, and the white men are ever\nkindly. And it was a house bigger than all the houses built by us and\nour fathers before us.”",
        "“It was a mighty house,” Koogah said, masking his unbelief with wonder.",
        "“And many trees went into the making of such a house,” Opee-Kwan added,\ntaking the cue.",
        "“That is nothing.” Nam-Bok shrugged his shoulders in belittling fashion.\n\"As our houses are to that house, so that house was to the houses I was\nyet to see.”",
        "“And they are not big men?”",
        "“Nay; mere men like you and me,” Nam-Bok answered. “I had cut a stick\nthat I might walk in comfort, and remembering that I was to bring report\nto you, my brothers, I cut a notch in the stick for each person who\nlived in that house. And I stayed there many days, and worked, for which\nthey gave me money–a thing of which you know nothing, but which is\nvery good.",
        "“And one day I departed from that place to go farther into the land. And\nas I walked I met many people, and I cut smaller notches in the stick,\nthat there might be room for all. Then I came upon a strange thing. On\nthe ground before me was a bar of iron, as big in thickness as my arm,\nand a long step away was another bar of iron––”",
        "“Then wert thou a rich man,” Opee-Kwan asserted; “for iron be worth more\nthan anything else in the world. It would have made many knives.”",
        "“Nay, it was not mine.”",
        "“It was a find, and a find be lawful.”",
        "“Not so; the white men had placed it there. And further, these bars were\nso long that no man could carry them away–so long that as far as I\ncould see there was no end to them.”",
        "“Nam-Bok, that is very much iron,” Opee-Kwan cautioned.",
        "“Ay, it was hard to believe with my own eyes upon it; but I could not\ngainsay my eyes. And as I looked I heard ...” He turned abruptly upon\nthe head man. “Opee-Kwan, thou hast heard the sea-lion bellow in his\nanger. Make it plain in thy mind of as many sea-lions as there be waves\nto the sea, and make it plain that all these sea-lions be made into one\nsea-lion, and as that one sea-lion would bellow so bellowed the thing I\nheard.”",
        "The fisherfolk cried aloud in astonishment, and Opee-Kwan’s jaw lowered\nand remained lowered.",
        "“And in the distance I saw a monster like unto a thousand whales. It was\none-eyed, and vomited smoke, and it snorted with exceeding loudness. I\nwas afraid and ran with shaking legs along the path between the bars.\nBut it came with speed of the wind, this monster, and I leaped the iron\nbars with its breath hot on my face ...”",
        "Opee-Kwan gained control of his jaw again. “And–and then, O Nam-Bok?”",
        "“Then it came by on the bars, and harmed me not; and when my legs could\nhold me up again it was gone from sight. And it is a very common thing\nin that country. Even the women and children are not afraid. Men make\nthem to do work, these monsters.”",
        "“As we make our dogs do work?” Koogah asked, with sceptic twinkle in his\neye.",
        "“Ay, as we make our dogs do work.”",
        "“And how do they breed these–these things?” Opee-Kwan questioned.",
        "“They breed not at all. Men fashion them cunningly of iron, and feed\nthem with stone, and give them water to drink. The stone becomes fire,\nand the water becomes steam, and the steam of the water is the breath of\ntheir nostrils, and–”",
        "“There, there, O Nam-Bok,” Opee-Kwan interrupted. “Tell us of other\nwonders. We grow tired of this which we may not understand.”",
        "“You do not understand?” Nam-Bok asked despairingly.",
        "“Nay, we do not understand,” the men and women wailed back. “We cannot\nunderstand.”",
        "Nam-Bok thought of a combined harvester, and of the machines wherein\nvisions of living men were to be seen, and of the machines from which\ncame the voices of men, and he knew his people could never understand.",
        "“Dare I say I rode this iron monster through the land?” he asked\nbitterly.",
        "Opee-Kwan threw up his hands, palms outward, in open incredulity. “Say\non; say anything. We listen.”",
        "“Then did I ride the iron monster, for which I gave money–”",
        "“Thou saidst it was fed with stone.”",
        "“And likewise, thou fool, I said money was a thing of which you know\nnothing. As I say, I rode the monster through the land, and through\nmany villages, until I came to a big village on a salt arm of the sea.\nAnd the houses shoved their roofs among the stars in the sky, and the\nclouds drifted by them, and everywhere was much smoke. And the roar of\nthat village was like the roar of the sea in storm, and the people were\nso many that I flung away my stick and no longer remembered the notches\nupon it.”",
        "“Hadst thou made small notches,” Koogah reproved, “thou mightst have\nbrought report.”",
        "Nam-Bok whirled upon him in anger. “Had I made small notches! Listen,\nKoogah, thou scratcher of bone! If I had made small notches neither the\nstick, nor twenty sticks, could have borne them–nay, not all the\ndriftwood of all the beaches between this village and the next. And if\nall of you, the women and children as well, were twenty times as many,\nand if you had twenty hands each, and in each hand a stick and a knife,\nstill the notches could not be cut for the people I saw, so many were\nthey and so fast did they come and go.”",
        "“There cannot be so many people in all the world,” Opee-Kwan objected,\nfor he was stunned and his mind could not grasp such magnitude of\nnumbers.",
        "“What dost thou know of all the world and how large it is?” Nam-Bok\ndemanded.",
        "“But there cannot be so many people in one place.”",
        "“Who art thou to say what can be and what cannot be?”",
        "“It stands to reason there cannot be so many people in one place. Their\ncanoes would clutter the sea till there was no room. And they could\nempty the sea each day of its fish, and they would not all be fed.”",
        "“So it would seem,” Nam-Bok made final answer; “yet it was so. With my\nown eyes I saw, and flung my stick away.” He yawned heavily and rose to\nhis feet. “I have paddled far. The day has been long, and I am tired.\nNow I will sleep, and to-morrow we will have further talk upon the\nthings I have seen.”",
        "Bask-Wah-Wan, hobbling fearfully in advance, proud indeed, yet awed by\nher wonderful son, led him to her igloo and stowed him away among the\ngreasy, ill-smelling furs. But the men lingered by the fire, and a\ncouncil was held wherein was there much whispering and low-voiced\ndiscussion.",
        "An hour passed, and a second, and Nam-Bok slept, and the talk went on.\nThe evening sun dipped toward the northwest, and at eleven at night was\nnearly due north. Then it was that the head man and the bone-scratcher\nseparated themselves from the council and aroused Nam-Bok. He blinked up\ninto their faces and turned on his side to sleep again. Opee-Kwan\ngripped him by the arm and kindly but firmly shook his senses back into\nhim.",
        "“Come, Nam-Bok, arise!” he commanded. “It be time.”",
        "“Another feast!” Nam-Bok cried. “Nay, I am not hungry. Go on with the\neating and let me sleep.”",
        "“Time to be gone!” Koogah thundered.",
        "But Opee-Kwan spoke more softly. “Thou wast bidarka-mate with me when we\nwere boys,” he said. “Together we first chased the seal and drew the\nsalmon from the traps. And thou didst drag me back to life, Nam-Bok,\nwhen the sea closed over me and I was sucked down to the black rocks.\nTogether we hungered and bore the chill of the frost, and together we\ncrawled beneath the one fur and lay close to each other. And because of\nthese things, and the kindness in which I stood to thee, it grieves me\nsore that thou shouldst return such a remarkable liar. We cannot\nunderstand, and our heads be dizzy with the things thou hast spoken. It\nis not good, and there has been much talk in the council. Wherefore we\nsend thee away, that our heads may remain clear and strong and be not\ntroubled by the unaccountable things.”",
        "“These things thou speakest of be shadows,” Koogah took up the strain.\n\"From the shadow-world thou hast brought them, and to the shadow-world\nthou must return them. Thy bidarka be ready, and the tribespeople wait.\nThey may not sleep until thou art gone.”",
        "Nam-Bok was perplexed, but hearkened to the voice of the head man.",
        "“If thou art Nam-Bok,” Opee-Kwan was saying, “thou art a fearful and\nmost wonderful liar; if thou art the shadow of Nam-Bok, then thou\nspeakest of shadows, concerning which it is not good that living men\nhave knowledge. This great village thou hast spoken of we deem the\nvillage of shadows. Therein flutter the souls of the dead; for the dead\nbe many and the living few. The dead do not come back. Never have the\ndead come back–save thou with thy wonder-tales. It is not meet that the\ndead come back, and should we permit it, great trouble may be our\nportion.”",
        "Nam-Bok knew his people well and was aware that the voice of the council\nwas supreme. So he allowed himself to be led down to the water’s edge,\nwhere he was put aboard his bidarka and a paddle thrust into his hand. A\nstray wildfowl honked somewhere to seaward, and the surf broke limply\nand hollowly on the sand. A dim twilight brooded over land and water,\nand in the north the sun smouldered, vague and troubled, and draped\nabout with blood-red mists. The gulls were flying low. The off-shore\nwind blew keen and chill, and the black-massed clouds behind it gave\npromise of bitter weather.",
        "“Out of the sea thou earnest,” Opee-Kwan chanted oracularly, “and back\ninto the sea thou goest. Thus is balance achieved and all things brought\nto law.”",
        "Bask-Wah-Wan limped to the froth-mark and cried, “I bless thee,\nNam-Bok, for that thou remembered me.”",
        "But Koogah, shoving Nam-Bok clear or the beach, tore the shawl from her\nshoulders and flung it into the bidarka.",
        "“It is cold in the long nights,” she wailed; “and the frost is prone to\nnip old bones.”",
        "“The thing is a shadow,” the bone-scratcher answered, “and shadows\ncannot keep thee warm.”",
        "Nam-Bok stood up that his voice might carry. “O Bask-Wah-Wan, mother\nthat bore me!” he called. “Listen to the words of Nam-Bok, thy son.\nThere be room in his bidarka for two, and he would that thou earnest\nwith him. For his journey is to where there are fish and oil in plenty.\nThere the frost comes not, and life is easy, and the things of iron do\nthe work of men. Wilt thou come, O Bask-Wah-Wan?”",
        "She debated a moment, while the bidarka drifted swiftly from her, then\nraised her voice to a quavering treble. “I am old, Nam-Bok, and soon I\nshall pass down among the shadows. But I have no wish to go before my\ntime. I am old, Nam-Bok, and I am afraid.”",
        "A shaft of light shot across the dim-lit sea and wrapped boat and man\nin a splendor of red and gold. Then a hush fell upon the fisherfolk, and\nonly was heard the moan of the off-shore wind and the cries of the gulls\nflying low in the air.",
        "“I’m not wanting to dictate to you, lad,” Charley said, “but I’m very\nmuch against your making a last raid. You’ve gone safely through rough\ntimes with rough men, and it would be a shame to have something happen\nto you at the very end.”",
        "“But how can I get out of making a last raid?” I demanded, with the\ncocksureness of youth. “There always has to be a last, you know, to\nanything.”",
        "Charley crossed his legs, leaned back, and considered the problem. “Very\ntrue. But why not call the capture of Demetrios Contos the last? You’re\nback from it safe and sound and hearty, for all your good wetting,\nand–and––” His voice broke and he could not speak for a moment. “And\nI could never forgive myself if anything happened to you now.”",
        "I laughed at Charley’s fears while I gave in to the claims of his\naffection, and agreed to consider the last raid already performed. We\nhad been together for two years, and now I was leaving the fish patrol\nin order to go back and finish my education. I had earned and saved\nmoney to put me through three years at the high school, and though the\nbeginning of the term was several months away, I intended doing a lot of\nstudying for the entrance examinations.",
        "My belongings were packed snugly in a sea-chest, and I was all ready to\nbuy my ticket and ride down on the train to Oakland, when Neil\nPartington arrived in Benicia. The Reindeer was needed immediately for\nwork far down on the Lower Bay, and Neil said he intended to run\nstraight for Oakland. As that was his home and as I was to live with his\nfamily while going to school, he saw no reason, he said, why I should\nnot put my chest aboard and come along.",
        "So the chest went aboard, and in the middle of the afternoon we hoisted\nthe Reindeer’s big mainsail and cast off. It was tantalizing fall\nweather. The sea-breeze, which had blown steadily all summer, was gone,\nand in its place were capricious winds and murky skies which made the\ntime of arriving anywhere extremely problematical. We started on the\nfirst of the ebb, and as we slipped down the Carquinez Straits, I looked\nmy last for some time upon Benicia and the bight at Turner’s Shipyard,\nwhere we had besieged the Lancashire Queen, and had captured Big Alec,\nthe King of the Greeks. And at the mouth of the Straits I looked with\nnot a little interest upon the spot where a few days before I should\nhave drowned but for the good that was in the nature of Demetrios\nContos.",
        "A great wall of fog advanced across San Pablo Bay to meet us, and in a\nfew minutes the Reindeer was running blindly through the damp\nobscurity. Charley, who was steering, seemed to have an instinct for\nthat kind of work. How he did it, he himself confessed that he did not\nknow; but he had a way of calculating winds, currents, distance, time,\ndrift, and sailing speed that was truly marvellous.",
        "“It looks as though it were lifting,” Neil Partington said, a couple of\nhours after we had entered the fog. “Where do you say we are, Charley?”",
        "Charley looked at his watch. “Six o’clock, and three hours more of\nebb,” he remarked casually.",
        "“But where do you say we are!” Neil insisted.",
        "Charley pondered a moment, and then answered, “The tide has edged us\nover a bit out of our course, but if the fog lifts right now, as it is\ngoing to lift, you’ll find we’re not more than a thousand miles off\nMcNear’s Landing.”",
        "“You might be a little more definite by a few miles, anyway,” Neil\ngrumbled, showing by his tone that he disagreed.",
        "“All right, then,” Charley said, conclusively, “not less than a quarter\nof a mile, nor more than a half.”",
        "The wind freshened with a couple of little puffs, and the fog thinned\nperceptibly.",
        "“McNear’s is right off there,” Charley said, pointing directly into the\nfog on our weather beam.",
        "The three of us were peering intently in that direction, when the\nReindeer struck with a dull crash and came to a standstill. We ran\nforward, and found her bowsprit entangled in the tanned rigging of a\nshort, chunky mast. She had collided, head on, with a Chinese junk\nlying at anchor.",
        "At the moment we arrived forward, five Chinese, like so many bees, came\nswarming out of the little ’tween-decks cabin, the sleep still in their\neyes.",
        "Leading them came a big, muscular man, conspicuous for his pock-marked\nface and the yellow silk handkerchief swathed about his head. It was\nYellow Handkerchief, the Chinaman whom we had arrested for illegal\nshrimp-fishing the year before, and who, at that time, had nearly sunk\nthe Reindeer, as he had nearly sunk it now by violating the rules of\nnavigation.",
        "“What d’ye mean, you yellow-faced heathen, lying here in a fairway\nwithout a horn a-going?” Charley cried hotly.",
        "“Mean?” Neil calmly answered. “Just take a look–that’s what he means.”",
        "Our eyes followed the direction indicated by Neil’s finger, and we saw\nthe open amidships of the junk, half filled, as we found on closer\nexamination, with fresh-caught shrimps. Mingled with the shrimps were\nmyriads of small fish, from a quarter of an inch upward in size. Yellow\nHandkerchief had lifted the trap-net at high-water slack, and, taking\nadvantage of the concealment offered by the fog, had boldly been lying\nby, waiting to lift the net again at low-water slack.",
        "“Well,” Neil hummed and hawed, “in all my varied and extensive\nexperience as a fish patrolman, I must say this is the easiest capture I\never made. What’ll we do with them, Charley?”",
        "“Tow the junk into San Rafael, of course,” came the answer. Charley\nturned to me. “You stand by the junk, lad, and I’ll pass you a towing\nline. If the wind doesn’t fail us, we’ll make the creek before the tide\ngets too low, sleep at San Rafael, and arrive in Oakland to-morrow by\nmidday.”",
        "So saying, Charley and Neil returned to the Reindeer and got under\nway, the junk towing astern. I went aft and took charge of the prize,\nsteering by means of an antiquated tiller and a rudder with large,\ndiamond-shaped holes, through which the water rushed back and forth.",
        "By now the last of the fog had vanished, and Charley’s estimate of our\nposition was confirmed by the sight of McNear’s Landing a short\nhalf-mile away, following: along the west shore, we rounded Point Pedro\nin plain view of the Chinese shrimp villages, and a great to-do was\nraised when they saw one of their junks towing behind the familiar fish\npatrol sloop.",
        "The wind, coming off the land, was rather puffy and uncertain, and it\nwould have been more to our advantage had it been stronger. San Rafael\nCreek, up which we had to go to reach the town and turn over our\nprisoners to the authorities, ran through wide-stretching marshes, and\nwas difficult to navigate on a falling tide, while at low tide it was\nimpossible to navigate at all. So, with the tide already half-ebbed, it\nwas necessary for us to make time. This the heavy junk prevented,\nlumbering along behind and holding the Reindeer back by just so much\ndead weight.",
        "“Tell those coolies to get up that sail,” Charley finally called to me.\n\"We don’t want to hang up on the mud flats for the rest of the night.”",
        "I repeated the order to Yellow Handkerchief, who mumbled it huskily to\nhis men. He was suffering from a bad cold, which doubled him up in\nconvulsive coughing spells and made his eyes heavy and bloodshot. This\nmade him more evil-looking than ever, and when he glared viciously at\nme I remembered with a shiver the close shave I had had with him at the\ntime of his previous arrest.",
        "His crew sullenly tailed on to the halyards, and the strange, outlandish\nsail, lateen in rig and dyed a warm brown, rose in the air. We were\nsailing on the wind, and when Yellow Handkerchief flattened down the\nsheet the junk forged ahead and the tow-line went slack. Fast as the\nReindeer could sail, the junk outsailed her; and to avoid running her\ndown I hauled a little closer on the wind. But the junk likewise\noutpointed, and in a couple of minutes I was abreast of the Reindeerand to windward. The tow-line had now tautened, at right angles to the\ntwo boats, and the predicament was laughable.",
        "“Cast off!” I shouted.",
        "Charley hesitated.",
        "“It’s all right,” I added. “Nothing can happen. We’ll make the creek on\nthis tack, and you’ll be right behind me all the way up to San Rafael.”",
        "At this Charley cast off, and Yellow Handkerchief sent one of his men\nforward to haul in the line. In the gathering darkness I could just\nmake out the mouth of San Rafael Creek, and by the time we entered it I\ncould barely see its banks. The Reindeer was fully five minutes\nastern, and we continued to leave her astern as we beat up the narrow,\nwinding channel. With Charley behind us, it seemed I had little to fear\nfrom my five prisoners; but the darkness prevented my keeping a sharp\neye on them, so I transferred my revolver from my trousers pocket to the\nside pocket of my coat, where I could more quickly put my hand on it.",
        "Yellow Handkerchief was the one I feared, and that he knew it and made\nuse of it, subsequent events will show. He was sitting a few feet away\nfrom me, on what then happened to be the weather side of the junk. I\ncould scarcely see the outlines of his form, but I soon became convinced\nthat he was slowly, very slowly, edging closer to me. I watched him\ncarefully. Steering with my left hand, I slipped my right into my pocket\nand got hold of the revolver.",
        "I saw him shift along for a couple of inches, and I was just about to\norder him back–the words were trembling on the tip of my tongue–when\nI was struck with great force by a heavy figure that had leaped through\nthe air upon me from the lee side. It was one of the crew. He pinioned\nmy right arm so that I could not withdraw my hand from my pocket, and at\nthe same time clapped his other hand over my mouth. Of course, I could\nhave struggled away from him and freed my hand or gotten my mouth clear\nso that I might cry an alarm, but in a trice Yellow Handkerchief was on\ntop of me.",
        "I struggled around to no purpose in the bottom of the junk, while my\nlegs and arms were tied and my mouth securely bound in what I afterward\nfound to be a cotton shirt. Then I was left lying in the bottom. Yellow\nHandkerchief took the tiller, issuing his orders in whispers; and from\nour position at the time, and from the alteration of the sail, which I\ncould dimly make out above me as a blot against the stars, I knew the\njunk was being headed into the mouth of a small slough which emptied at\nthat point into San Rafael Creek.",
        "In a couple of minutes we ran softly alongside the bank, and the sail\nwas silently lowered. The Chinese kept very quiet. Yellow Handkerchief\nsat down in the bottom alongside of me, and I could feel him straining\nto repress his raspy, hacking cough. Possibly seven or eight minutes\nlater I heard Charley’s voice as the Reindeer went past the mouth of\nthe slough.",
        "“I can’t tell you how relieved I am,” I could plainly hear him saying to\nNeil, “that the lad has finished with the fish patrol without accident.”",
        "Here Neil said something which I could not catch, and then Charley’s\nvoice went on:",
        "“The youngster takes naturally to the water, and if when he finishes\nhigh school he takes a course in navigation and goes deep sea, I see no\nreason why he shouldn’t rise to be master of the finest and biggest ship\nafloat.”",
        "It was all very flattering to me, but lying there, bound and gagged by\nmy own prisoners, with the voices growing faint and fainter as the\nReindeer slipped on through the darkness toward San Rafael, I must say\nI was not in quite the proper situation to enjoy my smiling future. With\nthe Reindeer went my last hope. What was to happen next I could not\nimagine, for the Chinese were a different race from mine and from what\nI knew I was confident that fair play was no part of their make-up.",
        "After waiting a few minutes longer, the crew hoisted the lateen sail,\nand Yellow Handkerchief steered down toward the mouth of San Rafael\nCreek. The tide was getting lower, and he had difficulty in escaping the\nmud-banks. I was hoping he would run aground, but he succeeded in making\nthe bay without accident.",
        "As we passed out of the creek a noisy discussion arose, which I knew\nrelated to me. Yellow Handkerchief was vehement, but the other four as\nvehemently opposed him. It was very evident that he advocated doing away\nwith me and that they were afraid of the consequences. I was familiar\nenough with the Chinese character to know that fear alone restrained\nthem. But what plan they offered in place of Yellow Handkerchief’s\nmurderous one, I could not make out.",
        "My feelings, as my fate hung in the balance, may be guessed. The\ndiscussion developed into a quarrel, in the midst of which Yellow\nHandkerchief unshipped the heavy tiller and sprang toward me. But his\nfour companions threw themselves between, and a clumsy struggle took\nplace for possession of the tiller. In the end Yellow Handkerchief was\novercome, and sullenly returned to the steering, while they soundly\nberated him for his rashness.",
        "Not long after, the sail was run down and the junk slowly urged forward\nby means of the sweeps. I felt it ground gently on the soft mud. Three\nof the Chinese–they all wore long sea-boots–got over the side, and the\nother two passed me across the rail. With Yellow Handkerchief at my legs\nand his two companions at my shoulders, they began to flounder along\nthrough the mud. After some time their feet struck firmer footing, and I\nknew they were carrying me up some beach. The location of this beach was\nnot doubtful in my mind. It could be none other than one of the Marin\nIslands, a group of rocky islets which lay off the Marin County shore.",
        "When they reached the firm sand that marked high tide, I was dropped,\nand none too gently. Yellow Handkerchief kicked me spitefully in the\nribs, and then the trio floundered back through the mud to the junk. A\nmoment later I heard the sail go up and slat in the wind as they drew\nin the sheet. Then silence fell, and I was left to my own devices for\ngetting free.",
        "I remembered having seen tricksters writhe and squirm out of ropes with\nwhich they were bound, but though I writhed and squirmed like a good\nfellow, the knots remained as hard as ever, and there was no appreciable\nslack. In the course of my squirming, however, I rolled over upon a heap\nof clam-shells–the remains, evidently, of some yachting party’s\nclam-bake. This gave me an idea. My hands were tied behind my back; and,\nclutching a shell in them, I rolled over and over, up the beach, till I\ncame to the rocks I knew to be there.",
        "Rolling around and searching, I finally discovered a narrow crevice,\ninto which I shoved the shell. The edge of it was sharp, and across the\nsharp edge I proceeded to saw the rope that bound my wrists. The edge of\nthe shell was also brittle, and I broke it by bearing too heavily upon\nit. Then I rolled back to the heap and returned with as many shells as I\ncould carry in both hands. I broke many shells, cut my hands a number of\ntimes, and got cramps in my legs from my strained position and my\nexertions.",
        "While I was suffering from the cramps, and resting, I heard a familiar\nhalloo drift across the water. It was Charley, searching for me. The gag\nin my mouth prevented me from replying, and I could only lie there,\nhelplessly fuming, while he rowed past the island and his voice slowly\nlost itself in the distance.",
        "I returned to the sawing process, and at the end of half an hour\nsucceeded in severing the rope. The rest was easy. My hands once free,\nit was a matter of minutes to loosen my legs and to take the gag out of\nmy mouth. I ran around the island to make sure it was an island and\nnot by any chance a portion of the mainland. An island it certainly was,\none of the Marin group, fringed with a sandy beach and surrounded by a\nsea of mud. Nothing remained but to wait till daylight and to keep warm;\nfor it was a cold, raw night for California, with just enough wind to\npierce the skin and cause one to shiver.",
        "To keep up the circulation, I ran around the island a dozen times or so,\nand clambered across its rocky backbone as many times more–all of which\nwas of greater service to me, as I afterward discovered, than merely to\nwarm me up. In the midst of this exercise I wondered if I had lost\nanything out of my pockets while rolling over and over in the sand. A\nsearch showed the absence of my revolver and pocket-knife. The first\nYellow Handkerchief had taken; but the knife had been lost in the sand.",
        "I was hunting for it when the sound of rowlocks came to my ears. At\nfirst, of course, I thought of Charley; but on second thought I knew\nCharley would be calling out as he rowed along. A sudden premonition of\ndanger seized me. The Marin Islands are lonely places; chance visitors\nin the dead of night are hardly to be expected. What if it were Yellow\nHandkerchief? The sound made by the rowlocks grew more distinct. I\ncrouched in the sand and listened intently. The boat, which I judged a\nsmall skiff from the quick stroke of the oars, was landing in the mud\nabout fifty yards up the beach. I heard a raspy, hacking cough, and my\nheart stood still. It was Yellow Handkerchief. Not to be robbed of his\nrevenge by his more cautious companions, he had stolen away from the\nvillage and come back alone.",
        "I did some swift thinking. I was unarmed and helpless on a tiny islet,\nand a yellow barbarian, whom I had reason to fear, was coming after me.\nAny place was safer than the island, and I turned instinctively to the\nwater, or rather to the mud. As he began to flounder ashore through the\nmud, I started to flounder out into it, going over the same course which\nthe Chinese had taken in landing me and in returning to the junk.",
        "Yellow Handkerchief, believing me to be lying tightly bound, exercised\nno care, but came ashore noisily. This helped me, for, under the shield\nof his noise and making no more myself than necessary, I managed to\ncover fifty feet by the time he had made the beach. Here I lay down in\nthe mud. It was cold and clammy, and made me shiver, but I did not care\nto stand up and run the risk of being discovered by his sharp eyes.",
        "He walked down the beach straight to where he had left me lying, and I\nhad a fleeting feeling of regret at not being able to see his surprise\nwhen he did not find me. But it was a very fleeting regret, for my teeth\nwere chattering with the cold.",
        "What his movements were after that I had largely to deduce from the\nfacts of the situation, for I could scarcely see him in the dim\nstarlight. But I was sure that the first thing he did was to make the\ncircuit of the beach to learn if landings had been made by other boats.\nThis he would have known at once by the tracks through the mud.",
        "Convinced that no boat had removed me from the island, he next started\nto find out what had become of me. Beginning at the pile of clam-shells,\nhe lighted matches to trace my tracks in the sand. At such times I could\nsee his villainous face plainly, and, when the sulphur from the matches\nirritated his lungs, between the raspy cough that followed and the\nclammy mud in which I was lying, I confess I shivered harder than ever.",
        "The multiplicity of my footprints puzzled him. Then the idea that I\nmight be out in the mud must have struck him, for he waded out a few\nyards in my direction, and, stooping, with his eyes searched the dim\nsurface long and carefully. He could not have been more than fifteen\nfeet from me, and had he lighted a match he would surely have discovered\nme.",
        "He returned to the beach and clambered about over the rocky backbone,\nagain hunting for me with lighted matches. The closeness of the shave\nimpelled me to further flight. Not daring to wade upright, on account of\nthe noise made by floundering and by the suck of the mud, I remained\nlying down in the mud and propelled myself over its surface by means of\nmy hands. Still keeping the trail made by the Chinese in going from and\nto the junk, I held on until I reached the water. Into this I waded to a\ndepth of three feet, and then I turned off to the side on a line\nparallel with the beach.",
        "The thought came to me of going toward Yellow Handkerchief’s skiff and\nescaping in it, but at that very moment he returned to the beach, and,\nas though fearing the very thing I had in mind, he slushed out through\nthe mud to assure himself that the skiff was safe. This turned me in the\nopposite direction. Half swimming, half wading, with my head just out of\nwater and avoiding splashing, I succeeded in putting about a hundred\nfeet between myself and the spot where the Chinese had begun to wade\nashore from the junk. I drew myself out on the mud and remained lying\nflat.",
        "Again Yellow Handkerchief returned to the beach and made a search of\nthe island, and again he returned to the heap of clam-shells. I knew\nwhat was running in his mind as well as he did himself. No one could\nleave or land without making tracks in the mud. The only tracks to be\nseen were those leading from his skiff and from where the junk had been.\nI was not on the island. I must have left it by one or the other of\nthose two tracks. He had just been over the one to his skiff, and was\ncertain I had not left that way. Therefore I could have left the island\nonly by going over the tracks of the junk landing. This he proceeded to\nverify by wading out over them himself, lighting matches as he came\nalong.",
        "When he arrived at the point where I had first lain, I knew, by the\nmatches he burned and the time he took, that he had discovered the marks\nleft by my body. These he followed straight to the water and into it,\nbut in three feet of water he could no longer see them. On the other\nhand, as the tide was still falling, he could easily make out the\nimpression made by the junk’s bow, and could have likewise made out the\nimpression of any other boat if it had landed at that particular spot.\nBut there was no such mark; and I knew that he was absolutely convinced\nthat I was hiding somewhere in the mud.",
        "But to hunt on a dark night for a boy in a sea of mud would be like\nhunting for a needle in a haystack, and he did not attempt it. Instead\nhe went back to the beach and prowled around for some time. I was hoping\nhe would give me up and go, for by this time I was suffering severely\nfrom the cold. At last he waded out to his skiff and rowed away. What if\nthis departure of Yellow Handkerchief’s were a sham? What if he had done\nit merely to entice me ashore?",
        "The more I thought of it the more certain I became that he had made a\nlittle too much noise with his oars as he rowed away. So I remained,\nlying in the mud and shivering. I shivered till the muscles of the small\nof my back ached and pained me as badly as the cold, and I had need of\nall my self-control to force myself to remain in my miserable situation.",
        "It was well that I did, however, for, possibly an hour later, I thought\nI could make out something moving on the beach. I watched intently, but\nmy ears were rewarded first, by a raspy cough I knew only too well.\nYellow Handkerchief had sneaked back, landed on the other side of the\nisland, and crept around to surprise me if I had returned.",
        "After that, though hours passed without sign of him, I was afraid to\nreturn to the island at all. On the other hand, I was almost equally\nafraid that I should die of the exposure I was undergoing. I had never\ndreamed one could suffer so. I grew so cold and numb, finally, that I\nceased to shiver. But my muscles and bones began to ache in a way that\nwas agony. The tide had long since begun to rise and, foot by foot, it\ndrove me in toward the beach. High water came at three o’clock, and at\nthree o’clock I drew myself up on the beach, more dead than alive, and\ntoo helpless to have offered any resistance had Yellow Handkerchief\nswooped down upon me.",
        "But no Yellow Handkerchief appeared. He had given me up and gone back to\nPoint Pedro. Nevertheless, I was in a deplorable, not to say a\ndangerous, condition. I could not stand upon my feet, much less walk. My\nclammy, muddy garments clung to me like sheets of ice. I thought I\nshould never get them off. So numb and lifeless were my fingers, and so\nweak was I that it seemed to take an hour to get off my shoes. I had not\nthe strength to break the porpoise-hide laces, and the knots defied me.\nI repeatedly beat my hands upon the rocks to get some sort of life into\nthem. Sometimes I felt sure I was going to die.",
        "But in the end,–after several centuries, it seemed to me,–I got off\nthe last of my clothes. The water was now close at hand, and I crawled\npainfully into it and washed the mud from my naked body. Still, I could\nnot get on my feet and walk and I was afraid to lie still. Nothing\nremained but to crawl weakly, like a snail, and at the cost of constant\npain, up and down the sand. I kept this up as long as possible, but as\nthe east paled with the coming of dawn I began to succumb. The sky grew\nrosy-red, and the golden rim of the sun, showing above the horizon,\nfound me lying helpless and motionless among the clam-shells.",
        "As in a dream, I saw the familiar mainsail of the Reindeer as she\nslipped out of San Rafael Creek on a light puff of morning air. This\ndream was very much broken. There are intervals I can never recollect on\nlooking back over it. Three things, however, I distinctly remember: the\nfirst sight of the Reindeer’s mainsail; her lying at anchor a few\nhundred feet away and a small boat leaving her side; and the cabin stove\nroaring red-hot, myself swathed all over with blankets, except on the\nchest and shoulders, which Charley was pounding and mauling\nunmercifully, and my mouth and throat burning with the coffee which Neil\nPartington was pouring down a trifle too hot.",
        "But burn or no burn, I tell you it felt good. By the time we arrived in\nOakland I was as limber and strong as ever,–though Charley and Neil\nPartington were afraid I was going to have pneumonia, and Mrs.\nPartington, for my first six months of school, kept an anxious eye upon\nme to discover the first symptoms of consumption.",
        "Time flies. It seems but yesterday that I was a lad of sixteen on the\nfish patrol. Yet I know that I arrived this very morning from China,\nwith a quick passage to my credit, and master of the barkentine\nHarvester. And I know that to-morrow morning I shall run over to\nOakland to see Neil Partington and his wife and family, and later on up\nto Benicia to see Charley Le Grant and talk over old times. No; I shall\nnot go to Benicia, now that I think about it. I expect to be a highly\ninterested party to a wedding, shortly to take place. Her name is Alice\nPartington, and, since Charley has promised to be best man, he will have\nto come down to Oakland instead.",
        "Whatever you do, make westing! make westing!–Sailing directions for Cape Horn.",
        "For seven weeks the Mary Rogers had been between 50° south in the\nAtlantic and 50° south in the Pacific, which meant that for seven weeks\nshe had been struggling to round Cape Horn. For seven weeks she had been\neither in dirt, or close to dirt, save once, and then, following upon\nsix days of excessive dirt, which she had ridden out under the shelter\nof the redoubtable Terra Del Fuego coast, she had almost gone ashore\nduring a heavy swell in the dead calm that had suddenly fallen. For\nseven weeks she had wrestled with the Cape Horn gray-beards, and in\nreturn been buffeted and smashed by them. She was a wooden ship, and her\nceaseless straining had opened her seams, so that twice a day the watch\ntook its turn at the pumps.",
        "The Mary Rogers was strained, the crew was strained, and big Dan\nCullen, master, was likewise strained. Perhaps he was strained most of\nall, for upon him rested the responsibility of that titanic struggle. He\nslept most of the time in his clothes, though he rarely slept. He\nhaunted the deck at night, a great, burly, robust ghost, black with the\nsunburn of thirty years of sea and hairy as an orang-utan. He, in turn,\nwas haunted by one thought of action, a sailing direction for the Horn:\nWhatever you do, make westing! make westing! It was an obsession. He\nthought of nothing else, except, at times, to blaspheme God for sending\nsuch bitter weather.",
        "Make westing! He hugged the Horn, and a dozen times lay hove to with\nthe iron Cape bearing east-by-north, or north-north-east, a score of\nmiles away. And each time the eternal west wind smote him back and he\nmade easting. He fought gale after gale, south to 64°, inside the\nantarctic drift-ice, and pledged his immortal soul to the Powers of\nDarkness for a bit of westing, for a slant to take him around. And he\nmade easting. In despair, he had tried to make the passage through the\nStraits of Le Maire. Halfway through, the wind hauled to the north ’ard\nof northwest, the glass dropped to 28.88, and he turned and ran before a\ngale of cyclonic fury, missing, by a hair’s breadth, piling up the Mary\nRogers on the black-toothed rocks. Twice he had made west to the Diego\nRamirez Rocks, one of the times saved between two snow-squalls by\nsighting the gravestones of ships a quarter of a mile dead ahead.",
        "Blow! Captain Dan Cullen instanced all his thirty years at sea to prove\nthat never had it blown so before. The Mary Rogers was hove to at the\ntime he gave the evidence, and, to clinch it, inside half an hour the\nMary Rogers was hove down to the hatches. Her new main-topsail and\nbrand new spencer were blown away like tissue paper; and five sails,\nfurled and fast under double gaskets, were blown loose and stripped from\nthe yards. And before morning the Mary Rogers was hove down twice\nagain, and holes were knocked in her bulwarks to ease her decks from\nthe weight of ocean that pressed her down.",
        "On an average of once a week Captain Dan Cullen caught glimpses of the\nsun. Once, for ten minutes, the sun shone at midday, and ten minutes\nafterward a new gale was piping up, both watches were shortening sail,\nand all was buried in the obscurity of a driving snow-squall. For a\nfortnight, once, Captain Dan Cullen was without a meridian or a\nchronometer sight. Rarely did he know his position within half a degree,\nexcept when in sight of land; for sun and stars remained hidden behind\nthe sky, and it was so gloomy that even at the best the horizons were\npoor for accurate observations. A gray gloom shrouded the world. The\nclouds were gray; the great driving seas were leaden gray gloom shrouded\nthe world. The clouds were gray; the great driving seas were leadening;\neven the occasional albatrosses were gray, while the snow-flurries were\nnot white, but gray, under the sombre pall of the heavens.",
        "Life on board the Mary Rogers was gray,–gray and gloomy. The faces of\nthe sailors were blue-gray; they were afflicted with sea-cuts and\nsea-boils, and suffered exquisitely. They were shadows of men. For\nseven weeks, in the forecastle or on deck, they had not known what it\nwas to be dry. They had forgotten what it was to sleep out a watch, and\nall watches it was, “All hands on deck!” They caught snatches of\nagonized sleep, and they slept in their oilskins ready for the\neverlasting call. So weak and worn were they that it took both watches\nto do the work of one. That was why both watches were on deck so much of\nthe time. And no shadow of a man could shirk duty. Nothing less than a\nbroken leg could enable a man to knock off work; and there were two\nsuch, who had been mauled and pulped by the seas that broke aboard.",
        "One other man who was the shadow of a man was George Dorety. He was the\nonly passenger on board, a friend of the firm, and he had elected to\nmake the voyage for his health. But seven weeks of Cape Horn had not\nbettered his health. He gasped and panted in his bunk through the long,\nheaving nights; and when on deck he was so bundled up for warmth that he\nresembled a peripatetic old-clothes shop. At midday, eating at the cabin\ntable in a gloom so deep that the swinging sea-lamps burned always, he\nlooked as blue-gray as the sickest, saddest man for’ard. Nor did gazing\nacross the table at Captain Dan Cullen have any cheering effect upon\nhim. Captain Cullen chewed and scowled and kept silent. The scowls were\nfor God, and with every chew he reiterated the sole thought of his\nexistence, which was make westing. He was a big, hairy brute, and the\nsight of him was not stimulating to the other’s appetite. He looked upon\nGeorge Dorety as a Jonah, and told him so, once each meal, savagely\ntransferring the scowl from God to the passenger and back again.",
        "Nor did the mate prove a first aid to a languid appetite. Joshua Higgins\nby name, a seaman by profession and pull, but a pot-wolloper by\ncapacity, he was a loose-jointed, sniffling creature, heartless and\nselfish and cowardly, without a soul, in fear of his life of Dan Cullen,\nand a bully over the sailors, who knew that behind the mate was Captain\nCullen, the lawgiver and compeller, the driver and the destroyer, the\nincarnation of a dozen bucko mates. In that wild weather at the southern\nend of the earth, Joshua Higgins ceased washing. His grimy face usually\nrobbed George Dorety of what little appetite he managed to accumulate.\nOrdinarily this lavatorial dereliction would have caught Captain\nCullen’s eye and vocabulary, but in the present his mind was filled with\nmaking westing, to the exclusion of all other things not contributory\nthereto. Whether the mate’s face was clean or dirty had no bearing upon\nwesting. Later on, when 50° south in the Pacific had been reached,\nJoshua Higgins would wash his face very abruptly. In the meantime, at\nthe cabin table, where gray twilight alternated with lamplight while the\nlamps were being filled, George Dorety sat between the two men, one a\ntiger and the other a hyena, and wondered why God had made them. The\nsecond mate, Matthew Turner, was a true sailor and a man, but George\nDorety did not have the solace of his company, for he ate by himself,\nsolitary, when they had finished.",
        "On Saturday morning, July 24, George Dorety awoke to a feeling of life\nand headlong movement. On deck he found the Mary Rogers running off\nbefore a howling southeaster. Nothing was set but the lower topsails and\nthe foresail. It was all she could stand, yet she was making fourteen\nknots, as Mr. Turner shouted in Dorety’s ear when he came on deck. And\nit was all westing. She was going around the Horn at last ... if the\nwind held. Mr. Turner looked happy. The end of the struggle was in\nsight. But Captain Cullen did not look happy. He scowled at Dorety in\npassing. Captain Cullen did not want God to know that he was pleased\nwith that wind. He had a conception of a malicious God, and believed in\nhis secret soul that if God knew it was a desirable wind, God would\npromptly efface it and send a snorter from the west. So he walked softly\nbefore God, smothering his joy down under scowls and muttered curses,\nand, so, fooling God, for God was the only thing in the universe of\nwhich Dan Cullen was afraid.",
        "All Saturday and Saturday night the Mary Rogers raced her westing.\nPersistently she logged her fourteen knots, so that by Sunday morning\nshe had covered three hundred and fifty miles. If the wind held, she\nwould make around. If it failed, and the snorter came from anywhere\nbetween southwest and north, back the Mary Rogers would be hurled and\nbe no better off than she had been seven weeks before. And on Sunday\nmorning the wind was failing. The big sea was going down and running\nsmooth. Both watches were on deck setting sail after sail as fast as the\nship could stand it. And now Captain Cullen went around brazenly before\nGod, smoking a big cigar, smiling jubilantly, as if the failing wind\ndelighted him, while down underneath he was raging against God for\ntaking the life out of the blessed wind. Make westing! So he would, if\nGod would only leave him alone. Secretly, he pledged himself anew to the\nPowers of Darkness, if they would let him make westing. He pledged\nhimself so easily because he did not believe in the Powers of Darkness.\nHe really believed only in God, though he did not know it. And in his\ninverted theology God was really the Prince of Darkness. Captain Cullen\nwas a devil-worshipper, but he called the devil by another name, that\nwas all.",
        "At midday, after calling eight bells, Captain Cullen ordered the royals\non. The men went aloft faster than they had gone in weeks. Not alone\nwere they nimble because of the westing, but a benignant sun was shining\ndown and limbering their stiff bodies. George Dorety stood aft, near\nCaptain Cullen, less bundled in clothes than usual, soaking in the\ngrateful warmth as he watched the scene. Swiftly and abruptly the\nincident occurred. There was a cry from the foreroyal-yard of “Man\noverboard!” Somebody threw a life buoy over the side, and at the same\ninstant the second mate’s voice came aft, ringing and peremptory:–",
        "“Hard down your helm!”",
        "The man at the wheel never moved a spoke. He knew better, for Captain\nDan Cullen was standing alongside of him. He wanted to move a spoke, to\nmove all the spokes, to grind the wheel down, hard down, for his comrade\ndrowning in the sea. He glanced at Captain Dan Cullen, and Captain Dan\nCullen gave no sign.",
        "“Down! Hard down!” the second mate roared, as he sprang aft.",
        "But he ceased springing and commanding, and stood still, when he saw Dan\nCullen by the wheel. And big Dan Cullen puffed at his cigar and said\nnothing. Astern, and going astern fast, could be seen the sailor. He had\ncaught the life buoy and was clinging to it. Nobody spoke. Nobody moved.\nThe men aloft clung to the royal yards and watched with terror stricken\nfaces. And the Mary Rogers raced on, making her westing. A long,\nsilent minute passed.",
        "“Who was it!” Captain Cullen demanded.",
        "“Mops, sir,” eagerly answered the sailor at the wheel.",
        "Mops topped a wave astern and disappeared temporarily in the trough. It\nwas a large wave, but it was no graybeard. A small boat could live\neasily in such a sea, and in such a sea the Mary Rogers could easily\ncome to. But she could not come to and make westing at the same time.",
        "For the first time in all his years, George Dorety was seeing a real\ndrama of life and death–a sordid little drama in which the scales\nbalanced an unknown sailor named Mops against a few miles of longitude.\nAt first he had watched the man astern, but now he watched big Dan\nCullen, hairy and black, vested with power of life and death, smoking a\ncigar.",
        "Captain Dan Cullen smoked another long, silent minute. Then he removed\nthe cigar from his mouth. He glanced aloft at the spars of the Mary\nRogers, and overside at the sea.",
        "“Sheet home the royals!” he cried.",
        "Fifteen minutes later they sat at table, in the cabin, with food served\nbefore them. On one side of George Dorety sat Dan Cullen, the tiger, on\nthe other side, Joshua Higgins, the hyena. Nobody spoke. On deck the men\nwere sheeting home the skysails. George Dorety could hear their cries,\nwhile a persistent vision haunted him of a man called Mops, alive and\nwell, clinging to a life buoy miles astern in that lonely ocean. He\nglanced at Captain Cullen, and experienced a feeling of nausea, for the\nman was eating his food with relish, almost bolting it.",
        "“Captain Cullen,” Dorety said, “you are in command of this ship, and it\nis not proper for me to comment now upon what you do. But I wish to say\none thing. There is a hereafter, and yours will be a hot one.”",
        "Captain Cullen did not even scowl. In his voice was regret as he\nsaid:–\"It was blowing a living gale. It was impossible to save the\nman.”",
        "“He fell from the royal-yard,” Dorety cried hotly. “You were setting the\nroyals at the time. Fifteen minutes afterward you were setting the\nskysails.”",
        "“It was a living gale, wasn’t it, Mr. Higgins?” Captain Cullen said,\nturning to the mate.",
        "“If you’d brought her to, it’d have taken the sticks out of her,” was\nthe mate’s answer. “You did the proper thing, Captain Cullen. The man\nhadn’t a ghost of a show.”",
        "George Dorety made no answer, and to the meal’s end no one spoke. After\nthat, Dorety had his meals served in his stateroom. Captain Cullen\nscowled at him no longer, though no speech was exchanged between them,\nwhile the Mary Rogers sped north toward warmer latitudes. At the end\nof the week, Dan Cullen cornered Dorety on deck.",
        "“What are you going to do when we get to Frisco?” he demanded bluntly.",
        "“I am going to swear out a warrant for your arrest,” Dorety answered\nquietly. “I am going to charge you with murder, and I am going to see\nyou hanged for it.”",
        "“You’re almighty sure of yourself,” Captain Cullen sneered, turning on\nhis heel.",
        "A second week passed, and one morning found George Dorety standing in\nthe coach-house companionway at the for’ard end of the long poop, taking\nhis first gaze around the deck. The Mary Rogers was reaching\nfull-and-by, in a stiff breeze. Every sail was set and drawing,\nincluding the staysails. Captain Cullen strolled for’ard along the poop.\nHe strolled carelessly, glancing at the passenger out of the corner of\nhis eye. Dorety was looking the other way, standing with head and\nshoulders outside the companionway, and only the back of his head was to\nbe seen. Captain Cullen, with swift eye, embraced the mainstaysail-block\nand the head and estimated the distance. He glanced about him. Nobody\nwas looking. Aft, Joshua Higgins, pacing up and down, had just turned\nhis back and was going the other way. Captain Cullen bent over suddenly\nand cast the staysail-sheet off from its pin. The heavy block hurtled\nthrough the air, smashing Dorety’s head like an egg-shell and hurtling\non and back and forth as the staysail whipped and slatted in the wind.\nJoshua Higgins turned around to see what had carried away, and met the\nfull blast of the vilest portion of Captain Cullen’s profanity.",
        "“I made the sheet fast myself,” whimpered the mate in the first lull,\n\"with an extra turn to make sure. I remember it distinctly.”",
        "“Made fast?” the captain snarled back, for the benefit of the watch as\nit struggled to capture the flying sail before it tore to ribbons. “You\ncouldn’t make your grandmother fast, you useless scullion. If you made\nthat sheet fast with an extra turn, why didn’t it stay fast? That’s what\nI want to know. Why didn’t it stay fast?”",
        "The mate whined inarticulately.",
        "“Oh, shut up!” was the final word of Captain Cullen.",
        "Half an hour later he was as surprised as any when the body of George\nDorety was found inside the companionway on the floor. In the afternoon,\nalone in his room, he doctored up the log.",
        "“Ordinary seaman, Karl Brun,” he wrote, “lost overboard from\nforeroyal-yard in a gale of wind. Was running at the time, and for the\nsafety of the ship did not dare come up to the wind. Nor could a boat\nhave lived in the sea that was running.”",
        "On another page, he wrote:–",
        "“Had often warned Mr. Dorety about the danger he ran because of his\ncarelessness on deck. I told him, once, that some day he would get his\nhead knocked off by a block. A carelessly fastened mainstaysail sheet\nwas the cause of the accident, which was deeply to be regretted because\nMr. Dorety was a favorite with all of us.”",
        "Captain Dan Cullen read over his literary effort with admiration,\nblotted the page, and closed the log. He lighted a cigar and stared\nbefore him. He felt the Mary Rogers lift, and heel, and surge along,\nand knew that she was making nine knots. A smile of satisfaction slowly\ndawned on his black and hairy face. Well, anyway, he had made his\nwesting and fooled God.",
        "I met him first in a hurricane; and though we had gone through the\nhurricane on the same schooner, it was not until the schooner had gone\nto pieces under us that I first laid eyes on him. Without doubt I had\nseen him with the rest of the kanaka crew on board, but I had not\nconsciously been aware of his existence, for the Petite Jeanne was\nrather overcrowded. In addition to her eight or ten kanaka seamen, her\nwhite captain, mate, and supercargo, and her six cabin passengers, she\nsailed from Rangiroa with something like eighty-five deck\npassengers–Paumotans and Tahitians, men, women, and children each with\na trade box, to say nothing of sleeping-mats, blankets, and\nclothes-bundles.",
        "The pearling season in the Paumotus was over, and all hands were\nreturning to Tahiti. The six of us cabin passengers were pearl-buyers.\nTwo were Americans, one was Ah Choon (the whitest Chinese I have ever\nknown), one was a German, one was a Polish Jew, and I completed the half\ndozen.",
        "It had been a prosperous season. Not one of us had cause for complaint,\nnor one of the eighty-five deck passengers either. All had done well,\nand all were looking forward to a rest-off and a good time in Papeete.",
        "Of course, the Petite Jeanne was overloaded. She was only seventy\ntons, and she had no right to carry a tithe of the mob she had on board.\nBeneath her hatches she was crammed and jammed with pearl-shell and\ncopra. Even the trade room was packed full of shell. It was a miracle\nthat the sailors could work her. There was no moving about the decks.\nThey simply climbed back and forth along the rails.",
        "In the night-time they walked upon the sleepers, who carpeted the deck,\nI’ll swear, two deep. Oh! and there were pigs and chickens on deck, and\nsacks of yams, while every conceivable place was festooned with strings\nof drinking cocoanuts and bunches of bananas. On both sides, between the\nfore and main shrouds, guys had been stretched, just low enough for the\nforeboom to swing clear; and from each of these guys at least fifty\nbunches of bananas were suspended.",
        "It promised to be a messy passage, even if we did make it in the two or\nthree days that would have been required if the southeast trades had\nbeen blowing fresh. But they weren’t blowing fresh. After the first five\nhours the trade died away in a dozen or so gasping fans. The calm\ncontinued all that night and the next day–one of those glaring, glassy\ncalms, when the very thought of opening one’s eyes to look at it is\nsufficient to cause a headache.",
        "The second day a man died–an Easter Islander, one of the best divers\nthat season in the lagoon. Smallpox–that is what it was; though how\nsmallpox could come on board, when there had been no known cases ashore\nwhen we left Rangiroa, is beyond me. There it was, though–smallpox, a\nman dead, and three others down on their backs.",
        "There was nothing to be done. We could not segregate the sick, nor could\nwe care for them. We were packed like sardines. There was nothing to do\nbut rot or die–that is, there was nothing to do after the night that\nfollowed the first death. On that night, the mate, the supercargo, the\nPolish Jew, and four native divers sneaked away in the large whale-boat.\nThey were never heard of again. In the morning the captain promptly\nscuttled the remaining boats, and there we were.",
        "That day there were two deaths; the following day three; then it jumped\nto eight. It was curious to see how we took it. The natives, for\ninstance, fell into a condition of dumb, stolid fear. The\ncaptain–Oudouse, his name was, a Frenchman–became very nervous and\nvoluble. He actually got the twitches. He was a large, fleshy man,\nweighing at least two hundred pounds, and he quickly became a faithful\nrepresentation of a quivering jelly-mountain of fat.",
        "The German, the two Americans, and myself bought up all the Scotch\nwhiskey, and proceeded to stay drunk. The theory was beautiful–namely,\nif we kept ourselves soaked in alcohol, every smallpox germ that came\ninto contact with us would immediately be scorched to a cinder. And the\ntheory worked, though I must confess that neither Captain Oudouse nor Ah\nChoon were attacked by the disease either. The Frenchman did not drink\nat all, while Ah Choon restricted himself to one drink daily.",
        "It was a pretty time. The sun, going into northern declination, was\nstraight overhead. There was no wind, except for frequent squalls, which\nblew fiercely for from five minutes to half an hour, and wound up by\ndeluging us with rain. After each squall, the awful sun would come out,\ndrawing clouds of steam from the soaked decks.",
        "The steam was not nice. It was the vapor of death, freighted with\nmillions and millions of germs. We always took another drink when we saw\nit going up from the dead and dying, and usually we took two or three\nmore drinks, mixing them exceptionally stiff. Also, we made it a rule to\ntake an additional several each time they hove the dead over to the\nsharks that swarmed about us.",
        "We had a week of it, and then the whiskey gave out. It is just as well,\nor I shouldn’t be alive now. It took a sober man to pull through what\nfollowed, as you will see when I mention the little fact that only two\nmen did pull through. The other man was the heathen–at least, that was\nwhat I heard Captain Oudouse call him at the moment I first became\naware of the heathen’s existence. But to come back.",
        "It was at the end of the week, with the whiskey gone, and the\npearl-buyers sober, that I happened to glance at the barometer that hung\nin the cabin companionway. Its normal register in the Paumotus was\n29.90, and it was quite customary to see it vacillate between 29.85 and\n30.00, or even 30.05; but to see it as I saw it, down to 29.62, was\nsufficient to sober the most drunken pearl-buyer that ever incinerated\nsmallpox microbes in Scotch whiskey.",
        "I called Captain Oudouse’s attention to it, only to be informed that he\nhad watched it going down for several hours. There was little to do, but\nthat little he did very well, considering the circumstances. He took off\nthe light sails, shortened right down to storm canvas, spread\nlife-lines, and waited for the wind. His mistake lay in what he did\nafter the wind came. He hove to on the port tack, which was the right\nthing to do south of the Equator, if–and there was the rub–if one\nwere not in the direct path of the hurricane.",
        "We were in the direct path. I could see that by the steady increase of\nthe wind and the equally steady fall of the barometer. I wanted him to\nturn and run with the wind on the port quarter until the barometer\nceased falling, and then to heave to. We argued till he was reduced to\nhysteria, but budge he would not. The worst of it was that I could not\nget the rest of the pearl-buyers to back me up. Who was I, anyway, to\nknow more about the sea and its ways than a properly qualified captain?\nwas what was in their minds, I knew.",
        "Of course the sea rose with the wind frightfully; and I shall never\nforget the first three seas the Petite Jeanne shipped. She had fallen\noff, as vessels do at times when hove to, and the first sea made a clean\nbreach. The life-lines were only for the strong and well, and little\ngood were they even for them when the women and children, the bananas\nand cocoanuts, the pigs and trade boxes, the sick and the dying, were\nswept along in a solid, screeching, groaning mass.",
        "The second sea filled the Petite Jeanne’s decks flush with the rails;\nand, as her stern sank down and her bow tossed skyward, all the\nmiserable dunnage of life and luggage poured aft. It was a human\ntorrent. They came head-first, feet-first, sidewise, rolling over and\nover, twisting, squirming, writhing, and crumpling up. Now and again one\ncaught a grip on a stanchion or a rope; but the weight of the bodies\nbehind tore such grips loose.",
        "One man I noticed fetch up, head on and square on, with the\nstarboard-bitt. His head cracked like an egg. I saw what was coming,\nsprang on top of the cabin, and from there into the mainsail itself. Ah\nChoon and one of the Americans tried to follow me, but I was one jump\nahead of them. The American was swept away and over the stern like a\npiece of chaff. Ah Choon caught a spoke of the wheel, and swung in\nbehind it. But a strapping Raratonga vahine (woman)–she must have\nweighed two hundred and fifty–brought up against him, and got an arm\naround his neck. He clutched the kanaka steersman with his other hand;\nand just at that moment the schooner flung down to starboard.",
        "The rush of bodies and sea that was coming along the port runway between\nthe cabin and the rail turned abruptly and poured to starboard. Away\nthey went–vahine, Ah Choon, and steersman: and I swear I saw Ah Choon\ngrin at me with philosophic resignation as he cleared the rail and went\nunder.",
        "The third sea–the biggest of the three–did not do so much damage. By\nthe time it arrived nearly everybody was in the rigging. On deck perhaps\na dozen gasping, half-drowned, and half-stunned wretches were rolling\nabout or attempting to crawl into safety. They went by the board, as did\nthe wreckage of the two remaining boats. The other pearl-buyers and\nmyself, between seas, managed to get about fifteen women and children\ninto the cabin, and battened down. Little good it did the poor creatures\nin the end.",
        "Wind? Out of all my experience I could not have believed it possible for\nthe wind to blow as it did. There is no describing it. How can one\ndescribe a nightmare? It was the same way with that wind. It tore the\nclothes off our bodies. I say tore them off, and I mean it. I am not\nasking you to believe it. I am merely telling something that I saw and\nfelt. There are times when I do not believe it myself. I went through\nit, and that is enough. One could not face that wind and live. It was a\nmonstrous thing, and the most monstrous thing about it was that it\nincreased and continued to increase.",
        "Imagine countless millions and billions of tons of sand. Imagine this\nsand tearing along at ninety, a hundred, a hundred and twenty, or any\nother number of miles per hour. Imagine, further, this sand to be\ninvisible, impalpable, yet to retain all the weight and density of sand.\nDo all this, and you may get a vague inkling of what that wind was like.",
        "Perhaps sand is not the right comparison. Consider it mud, invisible,\nimpalpable, but heavy as mud. Nay, it goes beyond that. Consider every\nmolecule of air to be a mud-bank in itself. Then try to imagine the\nmultitudinous impact of mud-banks. No; it is beyond me. Language may be\nadequate to express the ordinary conditions of life, but it cannot\npossibly express any of the conditions of so enormous a blast of wind.\nIt would have been better had I stuck by my original intention of not\nattempting a description.",
        "I will say this much: The sea, which had risen at first, was beaten down\nby that wind. More: it seemed as if the whole ocean had been sucked up\nin the maw of the hurricane, and hurled on through that portion of\nspace which previously had been occupied by the air.",
        "Of course, our canvas had gone long before. But Captain Oudouse had on\nthe Petite Jeanne something I had never before seen on a South Sea\nschooner–a sea-anchor. It was a conical canvas bag, the mouth of which\nwas kept open by a huge hoop of iron. The sea-anchor was bridled\nsomething like a kite, so that it bit into the water as a kite bites\ninto the air, but with a difference. The sea-anchor remained just under\nthe surface of the ocean in a perpendicular position. A long line, in\nturn, connected it with the schooner. As a result, the Petite Jeannerode bow on to the wind and to what sea there was.",
        "The situation really would have been favorable had we not been in the\npath of the storm. True, the wind itself tore our canvas out of the\ngaskets, jerked out our topmasts, and made a raffle of our running-gear,\nbut still we would have come through nicely had we not been square in\nfront of the advancing storm-centre. That was what fixed us. I was in a\nstate of stunned, numbed, paralyzed collapse from enduring the impact\nof the wind, and I think I was just about ready to give up and die when\nthe centre smote us. The blow we received was an absolute lull. There\nwas not a breath of air. The effect on one was sickening.",
        "Remember that for hours we had been at terrific muscular tension,\nwithstanding the awful pressure of that wind. And then, suddenly, the\npressure was removed. I know that I felt as though I was about to\nexpand, to fly apart in all directions. It seemed as if every atom\ncomposing my body was repelling every other atom and was on the verge of\nrushing off irresistibly into space. But that lasted only for a moment.\nDestruction was upon us.",
        "In the absence of the wind and pressure the sea rose. It jumped, it\nleaped, it soared straight toward the clouds. Remember, from every point\nof the compass that inconceivable wind was blowing in toward the centre\nof calm. The result was that the seas sprang up from every point of the\ncompass. There was no wind to check them. They popped up like corks\nreleased from the bottom of a pail of water. There was no system to\nthem, no stability. They were hollow, maniacal seas. They were eighty\nfeet high at the least. They were not seas at all. They resembled no sea\na man had ever seen.",
        "They were splashes, monstrous splashes–that is all. Splashes that were\neighty feet high. Eighty! They were more than eighty. They went over our\nmastheads. They were spouts, explosions. They were drunken. They fell\nanywhere, anyhow. They jostled one another; they collided. They rushed\ntogether and collapsed upon one another, or fell apart like a thousand\nwaterfalls all at once. It was no ocean any man had ever dreamed of,\nthat hurricane centre. It was confusion thrice confounded. It was\nanarchy. It was a hell-pit of sea-water gone mad.",
        "The Petite Jeanne? I don’t know. The heathen told me afterward that he\ndid not know. She was literally torn apart, ripped wide open, beaten\ninto a pulp, smashed into kindling wood, annihilated. When I came to I\nwas in the water, swimming automatically, though I was about two-thirds\ndrowned. How I got there I had no recollection. I remembered seeing the\nPetite Jeanne fly to pieces at what must have been the instant that my\nown consciousness was buffetted out of me. But there I was, with\nnothing to do but make the best of it, and in that best there was little\npromise. The wind was blowing again, the sea was much smaller and more\nregular, and I knew that I had passed through the centre. Fortunately,\nthere were no sharks about. The hurricane had dissipated the ravenous\nhorde that had surrounded the death ship and fed off the dead.",
        "It was about midday when the Petite Jeanne went to pieces, and it must\nhave been two hours afterward when I picked up with one of her\nhatch-covers. Thick rain was driving at the time; and it was the merest\nchance that flung me and the hatch-cover together. A short length of\nline was trailing from the rope handle; and I knew that I was good for a\nday, at least, if the sharks did not return. Three hours later, possibly\na little longer, sticking close to the cover, and, with closed eyes,\nconcentrating my whole soul upon the task of breathing in enough air to\nkeep me going and at the same time of avoiding breathing in enough water\nto drown me, it seemed to me that I heard voices. The rain had ceased,\nand wind and sea were easing marvellously. Not twenty feet away from me\non another hatch-cover, were Captain Oudouse and the heathen. They were\nfighting over the possession of the cover–at least, the Frenchman was.",
        "“Paien noir!” I heard him scream, and at the same time I saw him kick\nthe kanaka.",
        "Now, Captain Oudouse had lost all his clothes, except his shoes, and\nthey were heavy brogans. It was a cruel blow, for it caught the heathen\non the mouth and the point of the chin, half stunning him. I looked for\nhim to retaliate, but he contented himself with swimming about forlornly\na safe ten feet away. Whenever a fling of the sea threw him closer, the\nFrenchman, hanging on with his hands, kicked out at him with both feet.\nAlso, at the moment of delivering each kick, he called the kanaka a\nblack heathen.",
        "“For two centimes I’d come over there and drown you, you white beast!” I\nyelled.",
        "The only reason I did not go was that I felt too tired. The very thought\nof the effort to swim over was nauseating. So I called to the kanaka to\ncome to me, and proceeded to share the hatch-cover with him. Otoo, he\ntold me his name was (pronounced o-to-o); also, he told me that he was\na native of Bora Bora, the most westerly of the Society Group. As I\nlearned afterward, he had got the hatch-cover first, and, after some\ntime, encountering Captain Oudouse, had offered to share it with him,\nand had been kicked off for his pains.",
        "And that was how Otoo and I first came together. He was no fighter. He\nwas all sweetness and gentleness, a love-creature, though he stood\nnearly six feet tall and was muscled like a gladiator. He was no\nfighter, but he was also no coward. He had the heart of a lion; and in\nthe years that followed I have seen him run risks that I would never\ndream of taking. What I mean is that while he was no fighter, and while\nhe always avoided precipitating a row, he never ran away from trouble\nwhen it started. And it was “’Ware shoal!” when once Otoo went into\naction. I shall never forget what he did to Bill King. It occurred in\nGerman Samoa. Bill King was hailed the champion heavyweight of the\nAmerican Navy. He was a big brute of a man, a veritable gorilla, one of\nthose hard-hitting, rough-housing chaps, and clever with his fists as\nwell. He picked the quarrel, and he kicked Otoo twice and struck him\nonce before Otoo felt it to be necessary to fight. I don’t think it\nlasted four minutes, at the end of which time Bill King was the unhappy\npossessor of four broken ribs, a broken forearm, and a dislocated\nshoulder-blade. Otoo knew nothing of scientific boxing. He was merely a\nmanhandler; and Bill King was something like three months in recovering\nfrom the bit of manhandling he received that afternoon on Apia beach.",
        "But I am running ahead of my yarn. We shared the hatch-cover between us.\nWe took turn and turn about, one lying flat on the cover and resting,\nwhile the other, submerged to the neck, merely held on with his hands.\nFor two days and nights, spell and spell, on the cover and in the water,\nwe drifted over the ocean. Toward the last I was delirious most of the\ntime; and there were times, too, when I heard Otoo babbling and raving\nin his native tongue. Our continuous immersion prevented us from dying\nof thirst, though the sea-water and the sunshine gave us the prettiest\nimaginable combination of salt pickle and sunburn.",
        "In the end, Otoo saved my life; for I came to lying on the beach twenty\nfeet from the water, sheltered from the sun by a couple of cocoanut\nleaves. No one but Otoo could have dragged me there and stuck up the\nleaves for shade. He was lying beside me. I went off again; and the next\ntime I came round, it was cool and starry night, and Otoo was pressing a\ndrinking cocoanut to my lips.",
        "We were the sole survivors of the Petite Jeanne. Captain Oudouse must\nhave succumbed to exhaustion, for several days later his hatch-cover\ndrifted ashore without him. Otoo and I lived with the natives of the\natoll for a week, when we were rescued by a French cruiser and taken to\nTahiti. In the meantime, however, we had performed the ceremony of\nexchanging names. In the South Seas such a ceremony binds two men closer\ntogether than blood-brothership. The initiative had been mine; and Otoo\nwas rapturously delighted when I suggested it.",
        "“It is well,” he said, in Tahitian. “For we have been mates together for\ntwo days on the lips of Death.”",
        "“But Death stuttered.” I smiled.",
        "“It was a brave deed you did, master,” he replied, “and Death was not\nvile enough to speak.”",
        "“Why do you ’master’ me?” I demanded, with a show of hurt feelings. “We\nhave exchanged names. To you I am Otoo. To me you are Charley. And\nbetween you and me, forever and forever, you shall be Charley, and I\nshall be Otoo. It is the way of the custom. And when we die, if it does\nhappen that we live again somewhere beyond the stars and the sky, still\nshall you be Charley to me, and I Otoo to you.”",
        "“Yes, master,” he answered, his eyes luminous and soft with joy.",
        "“There you go!” I cried indignantly.",
        "“What does it matter what my lips utter?” he argued. “They are only my\nlips. But I shall think Otoo always. Whenever I think of myself, I shall\nthink of you. Whenever men call me by name, I shall think of you. And\nbeyond the sky and beyond the stars, always and forever, you shall be\nOtoo to me. Is it well, master?”",
        "I hid my smile, and answered that it was well.",
        "We parted at Papeete. I remained ashore to recuperate; and he went on\nin a cutter to his own island, Bora Bora. Six weeks later he was back. I\nwas surprised, for he had told me of his wife, and said that he was\nreturning to her, and would give over sailing on far voyages.",
        "“Where do you go, master?” he asked after our first greetings.",
        "I shrugged my shoulders. It was a hard question.",
        "“All the world,” was my answer–\"all the world, all the sea, and all the\nislands that are in the sea.”",
        "“I will go with you,” he said simply. “My wife is dead.”",
        "I never had a brother; but from what I have seen of other men’s\nbrothers, I doubt if any man ever had a brother that was to him what\nOtoo was to me. He was brother and father and mother as well. And this I\nknow: I lived a straighter and better man because of Otoo. I cared\nlittle for other men, but I had to live straight in Otoo’s eyes. Because\nof him I dared not tarnish myself. He made me his ideal, compounding me,\nI fear, chiefly out of his own love and worship; and there were times\nwhen I stood close to the steep pitch of Hades, and would have taken\nthe plunge had not the thought of Otoo restrained me. His pride in me\nentered into me, until it became one of the major rules in my personal\ncode to do nothing that would diminish that pride of his.",
        "Naturally, I did not learn right away what his feelings were toward me.\nHe never criticised, never censured; and slowly the exalted place I held\nin his eyes dawned upon me, and slowly I grew to comprehend the hurt I\ncould inflict upon him by being anything less than my best.",
        "For seventeen years we were together; for seventeen years he was at my\nshoulder, watching while I slept, nursing me through fever and\nwounds–ay, and receiving wounds in fighting for me. He signed on the\nsame ships with me; and together we ranged the Pacific from Hawaii to\nSydney Head, and from Torres Straits to the Galapagos. We blackbirded\nfrom the New Hebrides and the Line Islands over to the westward clear\nthrough the Louisades, New Britain, New Ireland, and New Hanover. We\nwere wrecked three times–in the Gilberts, in the Santa Cruz group, and\nin the Fijis. And we traded and salved wherever a dollar promised in\nthe way of pearl and pearl-shell, copra, beche-de-mer, hawkbill\nturtle-shell, and stranded wrecks.",
        "It began in Papeete, immediately after his announcement that he was\ngoing with me over all the sea, and the islands in the midst thereof.\nThere was a club in those days in Papeete, where the pearlers, traders,\ncaptains, and riffraff of South Sea adventurers foregathered. The play\nran high, and the drink ran high; and I am very much afraid that I kept\nlater hours than were becoming or proper. No matter what the hour was\nwhen I left the club, there was Otoo waiting to see me safely home.",
        "At first I smiled; next I chided him. Then I told him flatly that I\nstood in need of no wet-nursing. After that I did not see him when I\ncame out of the club. Quite by accident, a week or so later, I\ndiscovered that he still saw me home, lurking across the street among\nthe shadows of the mango-trees. What could I do? I know what I did do.",
        "Insensibly I began to keep better hours. On wet and stormy nights, in\nthe thick of the folly and the fun, the thought would persist in coming\nto me of Otoo keeping his dreary vigil under the dripping mangoes.\nTruly, he had made a better man of me. Yet he was not strait-laced. And\nhe knew nothing of common Christian morality. All the people on Bora\nBora were Christians; but he was a heathen, the only unbeliever on the\nisland, a gross materialist, who believed that when he died he was dead.\nHe believed merely in fair play and square dealing. Petty meanness, in\nhis code, was almost as serious as wanton homicide; and I do believe\nthat he respected a murderer more than a man given to small practices.",
        "Otoo had my welfare always at heart. He thought ahead for me, weighed my\nplans, and took a greater interest in them than I did myself. At first,\nwhen I was unaware of this interest of his in my affairs, he had to\ndivine my intentions, as, for instance, at Papeete, when I contemplated\ngoing partners with a knavish fellow-countryman on a guano venture. I\ndid not know he was a knave. Nor did any white man in Papeete. Neither\ndid Otoo know, but he saw how thick we were getting, and found out for\nme, and without my asking him. Native sailors from the ends of the seas\nknock about on the beach in Tahiti; and Otoo, suspicious merely, went\namong them till he had gathered sufficient data to justify his\nsuspicions. Oh, it was a nice history, that of Randolph Waters. I\ncouldn’t believe it when Otoo first narrated it; but when I sheeted it\nhome to Waters he gave in without a murmur, and got away on the first\nsteamer to Aukland.",
        "At first, I am free to confess, I couldn’t help resenting Otoo’s poking\nhis nose into my business. But I knew that he was wholly unselfish; and\nsoon I had to acknowledge his wisdom and discretion. He had his eyes\nopen always to my main chance, and he was both keen-sighted and\nfar-sighted. In time he became my counsellor, until he knew more of my\nbusiness than I did myself. He really had my interest at heart more than\nI did. Mine was the magnificent carelessness of youth, for I preferred\nromance to dollars, and adventure to a comfortable billet with all night\nin. So it was well that I had some one to look out for me. I know that\nif it had not been for Otoo, I should not be here to-day.",
        "Of numerous instances, let me give one. I had had some experience in\nblackbirding before I went pearling in the Paumotus. Otoo and I were in\nSamoa–we really were on the beach and hard aground–when my chance came\nto go as recruiter on a blackbird brig. Otoo signed on before the mast;\nand for the next half-dozen years, in as many ships, we knocked about\nthe wildest portions of Melanesia. Otoo saw to it that he always pulled\nstroke-oar in my boat. Our custom in recruiting labor was to land the\nrecruiter on the beach. The covering boat always lay on its oars several\nhundred feet off shore, while the recruiter’s boat, also lying on its\noars, kept afloat on the edge of the beach. When I landed with my\ntrade-goods, leaving my steering sweep apeak, Otoo left his stroke\nposition and came into the stern-sheets, where a Winchester lay ready to\nhand under a flap of canvas. The boat’s crew was also armed, the Sniders\nconcealed under canvas flaps that ran the length of the gunwales. While\nI was busy arguing and persuading the woolly-headed cannibals to come\nand labor on the Queensland plantations Otoo kept watch. And often and\noften his low voice warned me of suspicious actions and impending\ntreachery. Sometimes it was the quick shot from his rifle, knocking a\nsavage over, that was the first warning I received. And in my rush to\nthe boat his hand was always there to jerk me flying aboard. Once, I\nremember, on Santa Anna, the boat grounded just as the trouble began.\nThe covering boat was dashing to our assistance, but the several score\nof savages would have wiped us out before it arrived. Otoo took a flying\nleap ashore, dug both hands into the trade-goods, and scattered tobacco,\nbeads, tomahawks, knives, and calicoes in all directions.",
        "This was too much for the woolly-heads. While they scrambled for the\ntreasures, the boat was shoved clear, and we were aboard and forty feet\naway. And I got thirty recruits off that very beach in the next four\nhours.",
        "The particular instance I have in mind was on Malaita, the most savage\nisland in the easterly Solomons. The natives had been remarkably\nfriendly; and how were we to know that the whole village had been taking\nup a collection for over two years with which to buy a white man’s head?\nThe beggars are all head-hunters, and they especially esteem a white\nman’s head. The fellow who captured the head would receive the whole\ncollection. As I say, they appeared very friendly; and on this day I\nwas fully a hundred yards down the beach from the boat. Otoo had\ncautioned me; and, as usual when I did not heed him, I came to grief.",
        "The first I knew, a cloud of spears sailed out of the mangrove swamp at\nme. At least a dozen were sticking into me. I started to run, but\ntripped over one that was fast in my calf, and went down. The\nwoolly-heads made a run for me, each with a long-handled, fantail\ntomahawk with which to hack off my head. They were so eager for the\nprize that they got in one another’s way. In the confusion, I avoided\nseveral hacks by throwing myself right and left on the sand.",
        "Then Otoo arrived–Otoo the manhandler. In some way he had got hold of a\nheavy war club, and at close quarters it was a far more efficient weapon\nthan a rifle. He was right in the thick of them, so that they could not\nspear him, while their tomahawks seemed worse than useless. He was\nfighting for me, and he was in a true Berserker rage. The way he handled\nthat club was amazing. Their skulls squashed like overripe oranges. It\nwas not until he had driven them back, picked me up in his arms, and\nstarted to run, that he received his first wounds. He arrived in the\nboat with four spear thrusts, got his Winchester, and with it got a man\nfor every shot. Then we pulled aboard the schooner and doctored up.",
        "Seventeen years we were together. He made me. I should to-day be a\nsupercargo, a recruiter, or a memory, if it had not been for him.",
        "“You spend your money, and you go out and get more,” he said one day.\n\"It is easy to get money now. But when you get old, your money will be\nspent, and you will not be able to go out and get more. I know, master.\nI have studied the way of white men. On the beaches are many old men who\nwere young once, and who could get money just like you. Now they are\nold, and they have nothing, and they wait about for the young men like\nyou to come ashore and buy drinks for them.",
        "“The black boy is a slave on the plantations. He gets twenty dollars a\nyear. He works hard. The overseer does not work hard. He rides a horse\nand watches the black boy work. He gets twelve hundred dollars a year. I\nam a sailor on the schooner. I get fifteen dollars a month. That is\nbecause I am a good sailor. I work hard. The captain has a double\nawning, and drinks beer out of long bottles. I have never seen him haul\na rope or pull an oar. He gets one hundred and fifty dollars a month. I\nam a sailor. He is a navigator. Master, I think it would be very good\nfor you to know navigation.”",
        "Otoo spurred me on to it. He sailed with me as second mate on my first\nschooner, and he was far prouder of my command than I was myself. Later\non it was:",
        "“The captain is well paid, master; but the ship is in his keeping, and\nhe is never free from the burden. It is the owner who is better\npaid–the owner who sits ashore with many servants and turns his money\nover.”",
        "“True, but a schooner costs five thousand dollars–an old schooner at\nthat,” I objected. “I should be an old man before I saved five thousand\ndollars.”",
        "“There be short ways for white men to make money,” he went on, pointing\nashore at the cocoanut-fringed beach.",
        "We were in the Solomons at the time, picking up a cargo of ivory-nuts\nalong the east coast of Guadalcanar.",
        "“Between this river mouth and the next it is two miles,” he said. “The\nflat land runs far back. It is worth nothing now. Next year–who\nknows?–or the year after, men will pay much money for that land. The\nanchorage is good. Big steamers can lie close up. You can buy the land\nfour miles deep from the old chief for ten thousand sticks of tobacco,\nten bottles of square-face, and a Snider, which will cost you, maybe,\none hundred dollars. Then you place the deed with the commissioner; and\nthe next year, or the year after, you sell and become the owner of a\nship.”",
        "I followed his lead, and his words came true, though in three years,\ninstead of two. Next came the grasslands deal on Guadalcanar–twenty\nthousand acres, on a governmental nine hundred and ninety-nine years’\nlease at a nominal sum. I owned the lease for precisely ninety days,\nwhen I sold it to a company for half a fortune. Always it was Otoo who\nlooked ahead and saw the opportunity. He was responsible for the salving\nof the Doncaster–bought in at auction for a hundred pounds, and\nclearing three thousand after every expense was paid. He led me into the\nSavaii plantation and the cocoa venture on Upolu.",
        "We did not go seafaring so much as in the old days. I was too well off.\nI married, and my standard of living rose; but Otoo remained the same\nold-time Otoo, moving about the house or trailing through the office,\nhis wooden pipe in his mouth, a shilling undershirt on his back, and a\nfour-shilling lava-lava about his loins. I could not get him to spend\nmoney. There was no way of repaying him except with love, and God knows\nhe got that in full measure from all of us. The children worshipped him;\nand if he had been spoilable, my wife would surely have been his\nundoing.",
        "The children! He really was the one who showed them the way of their\nfeet in the world practical. He began by teaching them to walk. He sat\nup with them when they were sick. One by one, when they were scarcely\ntoddlers, he took them down to the lagoon, and made them into\namphibians. He taught them more than I ever knew of the habits of fish\nand the ways of catching them. In the bush it was the same thing. At\nseven, Tom knew more woodcraft than I ever dreamed existed. At six, Mary\nwent over the Sliding Rock without a quiver, and I have seen strong men\nbalk at that feat. And when Frank had just turned six he could bring up\nshillings from the bottom in three fathoms.",
        "“My people in Bora Bora do not like heathen–they are all Christians;\nand I do not like Bora Bora Christians,” he said one day, when I, with\nthe idea of getting him to spend some of the money that was rightfully\nhis, had been trying to persuade him to make a visit to his own island\nin one of our schooners–a special voyage which I had hoped to make a\nrecord breaker in the matter of prodigal expense.",
        "I say one of our schooners, though legally at the time they belonged\nto me. I struggled long with him to enter into partnership.",
        "“We have been partners from the day the Petite Jeanne went down,” he\nsaid at last. “But if your heart so wishes, then shall we become\npartners by the law. I have no work to do, yet are my expenses large. I\ndrink and eat and smoke in plenty–it costs much, I know. I do not pay\nfor the playing of billiards, for I play on your table; but still the\nmoney goes. Fishing on the reef is only a rich man’s pleasure. It is\nshocking, the cost of hooks and cotton line. Yes; it is necessary that\nwe be partners by the law. I need the money. I shall get it from the\nhead clerk in the office.”",
        "So the papers were made out and recorded. A year later I was compelled\nto complain.",
        "“Charley,” said I, “you are a wicked old fraud, a miserly skinflint, a\nmiserable land-crab. Behold, your share for the year in all our\npartnership has been thousands of dollars. The head clerk has given me\nthis paper. It says that in the year you have drawn just eighty-seven\ndollars and twenty cents.”",
        "“Is there any owing me?” he asked anxiously.",
        "“I tell you thousands and thousands,” I answered.",
        "His face brightened, as with an immense relief.",
        "“It is well,” he said. “See that the head clerk keeps good account of\nit. When I want it, I shall want it, and there must not be a cent\nmissing.",
        "“If there is,” he added fiercely, after a pause, “it must come out of\nthe clerk’s wages.”",
        "And all the time, as I afterward learned, his will, drawn up by\nCarruthers, and making me sole beneficiary, lay in the American consul’s\nsafe.",
        "But the end came, as the end must come to all human associations. It\noccurred in the Solomons, where our wildest work had been done in the\nwild young days, and where we were once more–principally on a holiday,\nincidentally to look after our holdings on Florida Island and to look\nover the pearling possibilities of the Mboli Pass. We were lying at\nSavo, having run in to trade for curios.",
        "Now, Savo is alive with sharks. The custom of the woolly-heads of\nburying their dead in the sea did not tend to discourage the sharks from\nmaking the adjacent waters a hang-out. It was my luck to be coming\naboard in a tiny, overloaded, native canoe, when the thing capsized.\nThere were four woolly-heads and myself in it, or, rather, hanging to\nit. The schooner was a hundred yards away. I was just hailing for a boat\nwhen one of the woolly-heads began to scream. Holding on to the end of\nthe canoe, both he and that portion of the canoe were dragged under\nseveral times. Then he loosed his clutch and disappeared. A shark had\ngot him.",
        "The three remaining savages tried to climb out of the water upon the\nbottom of the canoe. I yelled and struck at the nearest with my fist,\nbut it was no use. They were in a blind funk. The canoe could barely\nhave supported one of them. Under the three it upended and rolled\nsidewise, throwing them back into the water.",
        "I abandoned the canoe and started to swim toward the schooner, expecting\nto be picked up by the boat before I got there. One of the savages\nelected to come with me, and we swam along silently, side by side, now\nand again putting our faces into the water and peering about for sharks.\nThe screams of the man who stayed by the canoe informed us that he was\ntaken. I was peering into the water when I saw a big shark pass directly\nbeneath me. He was fully sixteen feet in length. I saw the whole thing.\nHe got the woolly-head by the middle, and away he went, the poor devil,\nhead, shoulders, and arms out of water all the time, screeching in a\nheartrending way. He was carried along in this fashion for several\nhundred feet, when he was dragged beneath the surface.",
        "I swam doggedly on, hoping that that was the last unattached shark. But\nthere was another. Whether it was the one that had attacked the natives\nearlier, or whether it was one that had made a good meal elsewhere, I do\nnot know. At any rate, he was not in such haste as the others. I could\nnot swim so rapidly now, for a large part of my effort was devoted to\nkeeping track of him. I was watching him when he made his first attack.\nBy good luck I got both hands on his nose, and, though his momentum\nnearly shoved me under, I managed to keep him off. He veered clear, and\nbegan circling about again. A second time I escaped him by the same\nmaneuver. The third rush was a miss on both sides. He sheered at the\nmoment my hands should have landed on his nose, but his sandpaper hide\n(I had on a sleeveless undershirt) scraped the skin off one arm from\nelbow to shoulder.",
        "By this time I was played out, and gave up hope. The schooner was still\ntwo hundred feet away. My face was in the water, and I was watching him\nmaneuver for another attempt, when I saw a brown body pass between us.\nIt was Otoo.",
        "“Swim for the schooner, master!” he said. And he spoke gayly, as though\nthe affair was a mere lark. “I know sharks. The shark is my brother.”",
        "I obeyed, swimming slowly on, while Otoo swam about me, keeping always\nbetween me and the shark, foiling his rushes and encouraging me.",
        "“The davit tackle carried away, and they are rigging the falls,” he\nexplained, a minute or so later, and then went under to head off another\nattack.",
        "By the time the schooner was thirty feet away I was about done for. I\ncould scarcely move. They were heaving lines at us from on board, but\nthey continually fell short. The shark, finding that it was receiving no\nhurt, had become bolder. Several times it nearly got me, but each time\nOtoo was there just the moment before it was too late. Of course, Otoo\ncould have saved himself any time. But he stuck by me.",
        "“Good-bye, Charley! I’m finished!” I just managed to gasp.",
        "I knew that the end had come, and that the next moment I should throw\nup my hands and go down.",
        "But Otoo laughed in my face, saying:",
        "“I will show you a new trick. I will make that shark feel sick!”",
        "He dropped in behind me, where the shark was preparing to come at me.",
        "“A little more to the left!” he next called out. “There is a line there\non the water. To the left, master–to the left!”",
        "I changed my course and struck out blindly. I was by that time barely\nconscious. As my hand closed on the line I heard an exclamation from on\nboard. I turned and looked. There was no sign of Otoo. The next instant\nhe broke surface. Both hands were off at the wrist, the stumps spouting\nblood.",
        "“Otoo!” he called softly. And I could see in his gaze the love that\nthrilled in his voice.",
        "Then, and then only, at the very last of all our years, he called me by\nthat name.",
        "“Good-by, Otoo!” he called.",
        "Then he was dragged under, and I was hauled aboard, where I fainted in\nthe captain’s arms.",
        "And so passed Otoo, who saved me and made me a man, and who saved me in\nthe end. We met in the maw of a hurricane, and parted in the maw of a\nshark, with seventeen intervening years of comradeship, the like of\nwhich I dare to assert has never befallen two men, the one brown and the\nother white. If Jehovah be from His high place watching every sparrow\nfall, not least in His kingdom shall be Otoo, the one heathen of Bora\nBora.",
        "He lay on his back. So heavy was his sleep that the stamp of hoofs and\ncries of the drivers from the bridge that crossed the creek did not\nrouse him. Wagon after wagon, loaded high with grapes, passed the bridge\non the way up the valley to the winery, and the coming of each wagon was\nlike the explosion of sound and commotion in the lazy quiet of the\nafternoon.",
        "But the man was undisturbed. His head had slipped from the folded\nnewspaper, and the straggling, unkempt hair was matted with the foxtails\nand burrs of the dry grass on which it lay. He was not a pretty sight.\nHis mouth was open, disclosing a gap in the upper row where several\nteeth at some time had been knocked out. He breathed stertorously, at\ntimes grunting and moaning with the pain of his sleep. Also, he was very\nrestless, tossing his arms about, making jerky, half-convulsive\nmovements, and at times rolling his head from side to side in the burrs.\nThis restlessness seemed occasioned partly by some internal discomfort,\nand partly by the sun that streamed down on his face and by the flies\nthat buzzed and lighted and crawled upon the nose and cheeks and\neyelids. There was no other place for them to crawl, for the rest of the\nface was covered with matted beard, slightly grizzled, but greatly\ndirt-stained and weather-discolored.",
        "The cheek-bones were blotched with the blood congested by the debauch\nthat was evidently being slept off. This, too, accounted for the\npersistence with which the flies clustered around the mouth, lured by\nthe alcohol-laden exhalations. He was a powerfully built man,\nthick-necked, broad-shouldered, with sinewy wrists and toil-distorted\nhands. Yet the distortion was not due to recent toil, nor were the\ncallouses other than ancient that showed under the dirt of the one palm\nupturned. From time to time this hand clenched tightly and\nspasmodically into a fist, large, heavy-boned and wicked-looking.",
        "The man lay in the dry grass of a tiny glade that ran down to the\ntree-fringed bank of the stream. On either side of the glade was a\nfence, of the old stake-and-rider type, though little of it was to be\nseen, so thickly was it overgrown by wild blackberry bushes, scrubby\noaks and young madrono trees. In the rear, a gate through a low paling\nfence led to a snug, squat bungalow, built in the California Spanish\nstyle and seeming to have been compounded directly from the landscape of\nwhich it was so justly a part. Neat and trim and modestly sweet was the\nbungalow, redolent of comfort and repose, telling with quiet certitude\nof some one that knew, and that had sought and found.",
        "Through the gate and into the glade came as dainty a little maiden as\never stepped out of an illustration made especially to show how dainty\nlittle maidens may be. Eight years she might have been, and, possibly, a\ntrifle more, or less. Her little waist and little black-stockinged\ncalves showed how delicately fragile she was; but the fragility was of\nmould only. There was no hint of anemia in the clear, healthy\ncomplexion nor in the quick, tripping step. She was a little, delicious\nblond, with hair spun of gossamer gold and wide blue eyes that were but\nslightly veiled by the long lashes. Her expression was of sweetness and\nhappiness; it belonged by right to any face that sheltered in the\nbungalow.",
        "She carried a child’s parasol, which she was careful not to tear against\nthe scrubby branches and bramble bushes as she sought for wild poppies\nalong the edge of the fence. They were late poppies, a third generation,\nwhich had been unable to resist the call of the warm October sun.",
        "Having gathered along one fence, she turned to cross to the opposite\nfence. Midway in the glade she came upon the tramp. Her startle was\nmerely a startle. There was no fear in it. She stood and looked long and\ncuriously at the forbidding spectacle, and was about to turn back when\nthe sleeper moved restlessly and rolled his hand among the burrs. She\nnoted the sun on his face, and the buzzing flies; her face grew\nsolicitous, and for a moment she debated with herself. Then she tiptoed\nto his side, interposed the parasol between him and the sun, and\nbrushed away the flies. After a time, for greater ease, she sat down\nbeside him.",
        "An hour passed, during which she occasionally shifted the parasol from\none tired hand to the other. At first the sleeper had been restless,\nbut, shielded from the flies and the sun, his breathing became gentler\nand his movements ceased. Several times, however, he really frightened\nher. The first was the worst, coming abruptly and without warning.\n\"Christ! How deep! How deep!” the man murmured from some profound of\ndream. The parasol was agitated; but the little girl controlled herself\nand continued her self-appointed ministrations.",
        "Another time it was a gritting of teeth, as of some intolerable agony.\nSo terribly did the teeth crunch and grind together that it seemed they\nmust crush into fragments. A little later he suddenly stiffened out. The\nhands clenched and the face set with the savage resolution of the dream.\nThe eyelids trembled from the shock of the fantasy, seemed about to\nopen, but did not. Instead, the lips muttered:",
        "“No; no! And once more no. I won’t peach.” The lips paused, then went\non. “You might as well tie me up, warden, and cut me to pieces. That’s\nall you can get outa me–blood. That’s all any of you-uns has ever got\nouta me in this hole.”",
        "After this outburst the man slept gently on, while the little girl still\nheld the parasol aloft and looked down with a great wonder at the\nfrowsy, unkempt creature, trying to reconcile it with the little part of\nlife that she knew. To her ears came the cries of men, the stamp of\nhoofs on the bridge, and the creak and groan of wagons heavy laden. It\nwas a breathless California Indian summer day. Light fleeces of cloud\ndrifted in the azure sky, but to the west heavy cloud banks threatened\nwith rain. A bee droned lazily by. From farther thickets came the calls\nof quail, and from the fields the songs of meadow larks. And oblivious\nto it all slept Ross Shanklin–Ross Shanklin, the tramp and outcast,\nex-convict 4379, the bitter and unbreakable one who had defied all\nkeepers and survived all brutalities.",
        "Texas-born, of the old pioneer stock that was always tough and stubborn,\nhe had been unfortunate. At seventeen years of age he had been\napprehended for horse stealing. Also, he had been convicted of stealing\nseven horses which he had not stolen, and he had been sentenced to\nfourteen years’ imprisonment. This was severe under any circumstances,\nbut with him it had been especially severe, because there had been no\nprior convictions against him. The sentiment of the people who believed\nhim guilty had been that two years was adequate punishment for the\nyouth, but the county attorney, paid according to the convictions he\nsecured, had made seven charges against him and earned seven fees. Which\ngoes to show that the county attorney valued twelve years of Ross\nShanklin’s life at less than a few dollars.",
        "Young Ross Shanklin had toiled terribly in jail; he had escaped, more\nthan once; and he had been caught and sent back to toil in other and\nvarious jails. He had been triced up and lashed till he fainted had been\nrevived and lashed again. He had been in the dungeon ninety days at a\ntime. He had experienced the torment of the straightjacket. He knew what\nthe humming bird was. He had been farmed out as a chattel by the state\nto the contractors. He had been trailed through swamps by bloodhounds.\nTwice he had been shot. For six years on end he had cut a cord and a\nhalf of wood each day in a convict lumber camp. Sick or well, he had cut\nthat cord and a half or paid for it under a whip-lash knotted and\npickled.",
        "And Ross Shanklin had not sweetened under the treatment. He had sneered,\nand raved, and defied. He had seen convicts, after the guards had\nmanhandled them, crippled in body for life, or left to maunder in mind\nto the end of their days. He had seen convicts, even his own cell mate,\ngoaded to murder by their keepers, go to the gallows reviling God. He\nhad been in a break in which eleven of his kind were shot down. He had\nbeen through a mutiny, where, in the prison yard, with gatling guns\ntrained upon them, three hundred convicts had been disciplined with pick\nhandles wielded by brawny guards.",
        "He had known every infamy of human cruelty, and through it all he had\nnever been broken. He had resented and fought to the last, until,\nembittered and bestial, the day came when he was discharged. Five\ndollars were given him in payment for the years of his labor and the\nflower of his manhood. And he had worked little in the years that\nfollowed. Work he hated and despised. He tramped, begged and stole,\nlied or threatened as the case might warrant, and drank to besottedness\nwhenever he got the chance.",
        "The little girl was looking at him when he awoke. Like a wild animal,\nall of him was awake the instant he opened his eyes. The first he saw\nwas the parasol, strangely obtruded between him and the sky. He did not\nstart nor move, though his whole body seemed slightly to tense. His eyes\nfollowed down the parasol handle to the tight-clutched little fingers,\nand along the arm to the child’s face. Straight and unblinking he looked\ninto her eyes, and she, returning the look, was chilled and frightened\nby his glittering eyes, cold and harsh, withal bloodshot, and with no\nhint in them of the warm humanness she had been accustomed to see and\nfeel in human eyes. They were the true prison eyes–the eyes of a man\nwho had learned to talk little, who had forgotten almost how to talk.",
        "“Hello,” he said finally, making no effort to change his position. “What\ngame are you up to!”",
        "His voice was gruff and husky, and at first it had been harsh; but it\nhad softened queerly in a feeble attempt at forgotten kindliness.",
        "“How do you do?” she said. “I’m not playing. The sun was on your face,\nand mamma says one oughtn’t to sleep in the sun.”",
        "The sweet clearness of her child’s voice was pleasant to him, and he\nwondered why he had never noticed it in children’s voices before. He sat\nup slowly and stared at her. He felt that he ought to say something, but\nspeech with him was a reluctant thing.",
        "“I hope you slept well,” she said gravely.",
        "“I sure did,” he answered, never taking his eyes from her, amazed at the\nfairness and delicacy of her. “How long was you holdin’ that contraption\nup over me?”",
        "“O-oh,” she debated with herself, “a long, long time. I thought you\nwould never wake up.”",
        "“And I thought you was a fairy when I first seen you.”",
        "He felt elated at his contribution to the conversation.",
        "“No, not a fairy,” she smiled.",
        "He thrilled in a strange, numb way at the immaculate whiteness of her\nsmall even teeth.",
        "“I was just the good Samaritan,” she added.",
        "“I reckon I never heard of that party.”",
        "He was cudgelling his brains to keep the conversation going. Never\nhaving been at close quarters with a child since he was man-grown, he\nfound it difficult.",
        "“What a funny man not to know about the good Samaritan. Don’t you\nremember? A certain man went down to Jericho––”",
        "“I reckon I’ve been there,” he interrupted.",
        "“I knew you were a traveler!” she cried, clapping her hands. “Maybe you\nsaw the exact spot.”",
        "“What spot?”",
        "“Why, where he fell among thieves and was left half dead. And then the\ngood Samaritan went to him, and bound up his wounds, and poured in oil\nand wine–was that olive oil, do you think?”",
        "He shook his head slowly.",
        "“I reckon you got me there. Olive oil is something the dagoes cooks\nwith. I never heard of it for busted heads.”",
        "She considered his statement for a moment.",
        "“Well,” she announced, “we use olive oil in our cooking, so we must be\ndagoes. I never knew what they were before. I thought it was slang.”",
        "“And the Samaritan dumped oil on his head,” the tramp muttered\nreminiscently. “Seems to me I recollect a sky pilot sayin’ something\nabout that old gent. D’ye know, I’ve been looking for him off ’n on all\nmy life, and never scared up hide nor hair of him. They ain’t no more\nSamaritans.”",
        "“Wasn’t I one!” she asked quickly.",
        "He looked at her steadily, with a great curiosity and wonder. Her ear,\nby a movement exposed to the sun, was transparent. It seemed he could\nalmost see through it. He was amazed at the delicacy of her coloring, at\nthe blue of her eyes, at the dazzle of the sun-touched golden hair. And\nhe was astounded by her fragility. It came to him that she was easily\nbroken. His eye went quickly from his huge, gnarled paw to her tiny hand\nin which it seemed to him he could almost see the blood circulate. He\nknew the power in his muscles, and he knew the tricks and turns by which\nmen use their bodies to ill-treat men. In fact, he knew little else, and\nhis mind for the time ran in its customary channel. It was his way of\nmeasuring the beautiful strangeness of her. He calculated a grip, and\nnot a strong one, that could grind her little fingers to pulp. He\nthought of fist blows he had given to men’s heads, and received on his\nown head, and felt that the least of them could shatter hers like an\negg-shell. He scanned her little shoulders and slim waist, and knew in\nall certitude that with his two hands he could rend her to pieces.",
        "“Wasn’t I one?” she insisted again.",
        "He came back to himself with a shock–or away from himself, as the case\nhappened. He was loath that the conversation should cease.",
        "“What?” he answered. “Oh, yes; you bet you was a Samaritan, even if you\ndidn’t have no olive oil.” He remembered what his mind had been dwelling\non, and asked, “But ain’t you afraid?”",
        "“Of ... of me?” he added lamely.",
        "She laughed merrily.",
        "“Mamma says never to be afraid of anything. She says that if you’re\ngood, and you think good of other people, they’ll be good, too.”",
        "“And you was thinkin’ good of me when you kept the sun off,” he\nmarveled.",
        "“But it’s hard to think good of bees and nasty crawly things,” she\nconfessed.",
        "“But there’s men that is nasty and crawly things,” he argued.",
        "“Mamma says no. She says there’s good in everyone.",
        "“I bet you she locks the house up tight at night just the same,” he\nproclaimed triumphantly.",
        "“But she doesn’t. Mamma isn’t afraid of anything. That’s why she lets me\nplay out here alone when I want. Why, we had a robber once. Mamma got\nright up and found him. And what do you think! He was only a poor hungry\nman. And she got him plenty to eat from the pantry, and afterward she\ngot him work to do.”",
        "Ross Shanklin was stunned. The vista shown him of human nature was\nunthinkable. It had been his lot to live in a world of suspicion and\nhatred, of evil-believing and evil-doing. It had been his experience,\nslouching along village streets at nightfall, to see little children,\nscreaming with fear, run from him to their mothers. He had even seen\ngrown women shrink aside from him as he passed along the sidewalk.",
        "He was aroused by the girl clapping her hands as she cried out:",
        "“I know what you are! You’re an open air crank. That’s why you were\nsleeping here in the grass.”",
        "He felt a grim desire to laugh, but repressed it.",
        "“And that’s what tramps are–open air cranks,” she continued. “I often\nwondered. Mamma believes in the open air. I sleep on the porch at night.\nSo does she. This is our land. You must have climbed the fence. Mamma\nlets me when I put on my climbers–they’re bloomers, you know. But you\nought to be told something. A person doesn’t know when they snore\nbecause they’re asleep. But you do worse than that. You grit your teeth.\nThat’s bad. Whenever you are going to sleep you must think to yourself,\n’I won’t grit my teeth, I won’t grit my teeth,’ over and over, just like\nthat, and by and by you’ll get out of the habit.",
        "“All bad things are habits. And so are all good things. And it depends\non us what kind our habits are going to be. I used to pucker my\neyebrows–wrinkle them all up, but mamma said I must overcome that\nhabit. She said that when my eyebrows were wrinkled it was an\nadvertisement that my brain was wrinkled inside, and that it wasn’t good\nto have wrinkles in the brain. And then she smoothed my eyebrows with\nher hand and said I must always think smooth–smooth inside, and\nsmooth outside. And do you know, it was easy. I haven’t wrinkled my\nbrows for ever so long. I’ve heard about filling teeth by thinking. But\nI don’t believe that. Neither does mamma.”",
        "She paused rather out of breath. Nor did he speak. Her flow of talk had\nbeen too much for him. Also, sleeping drunkenly, with open mouth, had\nmade him very thirsty. But, rather than lose one precious moment, he\nendured the torment of his scorching throat and mouth. He licked his dry\nlips and struggled for speech.",
        "“What is your name?” he managed at last.",
        "“Joan.”",
        "She looked her own question at him, and it was not necessary to voice\nit.",
        "“Mine is Ross Shanklin,” he volunteered, for the first time in forgotten\nyears giving his real name.",
        "“I suppose you’ve traveled a lot.”",
        "“I sure have, but not as much as I might have wanted to.”",
        "“Papa always wanted to travel, but he was too busy at the office. He\nnever could get much time. He went to Europe once with mamma. That was\nbefore I was born. It takes money to travel.”",
        "Ross Shanklin did not know whether to agree with this statement or not.",
        "“But it doesn’t cost tramps much for expenses,” she took the thought\naway from him. “Is that why you tramp?”",
        "He nodded and licked his lips.",
        "“Mamma says it’s too bad that men must tramp to look for work. But\nthere’s lots of work now in the country. All the farmers in the valley\nare trying to get men. Have you been working?”",
        "He shook his head, angry with himself that he should feel shame at the\nconfession when his savage reasoning told him he was right in despising\nwork. But this was followed by another thought. This beautiful little\ncreature was some man’s child. She was one of the rewards of work.",
        "“I wish I had a little girl like you,” he blurted out, stirred by a\nsudden consciousness of passion for paternity. “I’d work my hands off. I\n... I’d do anything.”",
        "She considered his case with fitting gravity.",
        "“Then you aren’t married?”",
        "“Nobody would have me.”",
        "“Yes, they would, if ...”",
        "She did not turn up her nose, but she favored his dirt and rags with a\nlook of disapprobation he could not mistake.",
        "“Go on,” he half-shouted. “Shoot it into me. If I was washed–if I wore\ngood clothes–if I was respectable–if I had a job and worked\nregular–if I wasn’t what I am.”",
        "To each statement she nodded.",
        "“Well, I ain’t that kind,” he rushed on. “I’m no good. I’m a tramp. I\ndon’t want to work, that’s what. And I like dirt.”",
        "Her face was eloquent with reproach as she said, “Then you were only\nmaking believe when you wished you had a little girl like me?”",
        "This left him speechless, for he knew, in all the depths of his\nnew-found passion, that that was just what he did want.",
        "With ready tact, noting his discomfort, she sought to change the\nsubject.",
        "“What do you think of God?” she asked. “I ain’t never met him. What do\nyou think about him?”",
        "His reply was evidently angry, and she was frank in her disapproval.",
        "“You are very strange,” she said. “You get angry so easily. I never saw\nanybody before that got angry about God, or work, or being clean.”",
        "“He never done anything for me,” he muttered resentfully. He cast back\nin quick review of the long years of toil in the convict camps and\nmines. “And work never done anything for me neither.”",
        "An embarrassing silence fell.",
        "He looked at her, numb and hungry with the stir of the father-love,\nsorry for his ill temper, puzzling his brain for something to say. She\nwas looking off and away at the clouds, and he devoured her with his\neyes. He reached out stealthily and rested one grimy hand on the very\nedge of her little dress. It seemed to him that she was the most\nwonderful thing in the world. The quail still called from the coverts,\nand the harvest sounds seemed abruptly to become very loud. A great\nloneliness oppressed him.",
        "“I’m ... I’m no good,” he murmured huskily and repentantly.",
        "But, beyond a glance from her blue eyes, she took no notice. The silence\nwas more embarrassing than ever. He felt that he could give the world\njust to touch with his lips that hem of her dress where his hand rested.\nBut he was afraid of frightening her. He fought to find something to\nsay, licking his parched lips and vainly attempting to articulate\nsomething, anything.",
        "“This ain’t Sonoma Valley,” he declared finally. “This is fairy land,\nand you’re a fairy. Mebbe I’m asleep and dreaming. I don’t know. You and\nme don’t know how to talk together, because, you see, you’re a fairy and\ndon’t know nothing but good things, and I’m a man from the bad, wicked\nworld.”",
        "Having achieved this much, he was left gasping for ideas like a stranded\nfish.",
        "“And you’re going to tell me about the bad, wicked world,” she cried,\nclapping her hands. “I’m just dying to know.”",
        "He looked at her, startled, remembering the wreckage of womanhood he\nhad encountered on the sunken ways of life. She was no fairy. She was\nflesh and blood, and the possibilities of wreckage were in her as they\nhad been in him even when he lay at his mother’s breast. And there was\nin her eagerness to know.",
        "“Nope,” he said lightly, “this man from the bad, wicked world ain’t\ngoing to tell you nothing of the kind. He’s going to tell you of the\ngood things in that world. He’s going to tell you how he loved hosses\nwhen he was a shaver, and about the first hoss he straddled, and the\nfirst hoss he owned. Hosses ain’t like men. They’re better. They’re\nclean–clean all the way through and back again. And, little fairy, I\nwant to tell you one thing–there sure ain’t nothing in the world like\nwhen you’re settin’ a tired hoss at the end of a long day, and when you\njust speak, and that tired animal lifts under you willing and hustles\nalong. Hosses! They’re my long suit. I sure dote on hosses. Yep. I used\nto be a cowboy once.”",
        "She clapped her hands in the way that tore so delightfully to his heart,\nand her eyes were dancing, as she exclaimed:",
        "“A Texas cowboy! I always wanted to see one! I heard papa say once that\ncowboys are bow-legged. Are you?”",
        "“I sure was a Texas cowboy,” he answered. “But it was a long time ago.\nAnd I’m sure bow-legged. You see, you can’t ride much when you’re young\nand soft without getting the legs bent some. Why, I was only a\nthree-year-old when I begun. He was a three-year-old, too, fresh-broken.\nI led him up alongside the fence, dumb to the top rail, and dropped on.\nHe was a pinto, and a real devil at bucking, but I could do anything\nwith him. I reckon he knowed I was only a little shaver. Some hosses\nknows lots more ’n’ you think.”",
        "For half an hour Ross Shanklin rambled on with his horse reminiscences,\nnever unconscious for a moment of the supreme joy that was his through\nthe touch of his hand on the hem of her dress. The sun dropped slowly\ninto the cloud bank, the quail called more insistently, and empty wagon\nafter empty wagon rumbled back across the bridge. Then came a woman’s\nvoice.",
        "“Joan! Joan!” it called. “Where are you, dear?”",
        "The little girl answered, and Ross Shanklin saw a woman, clad in a\nsoft, clinging gown, come through the gate from the bungalow. She was a\nslender, graceful woman, and to his charmed eyes she seemed rather to\nfloat along than walk like ordinary flesh and blood.",
        "“What have you been doing all afternoon?” the woman asked, as she came\nup.",
        "“Talking, mamma,” the little girl replied. “I’ve had a very interesting\ntime.”",
        "Ross Shanklin scrambled to his feet and stood watchfully and awkwardly.\nThe little girl took the mother’s hand, and she, in turn, looked at him\nfrankly and pleasantly, with a recognition of his humanness that was a\nnew thing to him. In his mind ran the thought: the woman who ain’t\nafraid. Not a hint was there of the timidity he was accustomed to\nseeing in women’s eyes. And he was quite aware, and never more so, of\nhis bleary-eyed, forbidding appearance.",
        "“How do you do?” she greeted him sweetly and naturally.",
        "“How do you do, ma’am,” he responded, unpleasantly conscious of the\nhuskiness and rawness of his voice.",
        "“And did you have an interesting time, too!” she smiled.",
        "“Yes, ma’am. I sure did. I was just telling your little girl about\nbosses.”",
        "“He was a cowboy, once, mamma,” she cried.",
        "The mother smiled her acknowledgment to him, and looked fondly down at\nthe little girl. The thought that came into Ross Shanklin’s mind was the\nawfulness of the crime if any one should harm either of the wonderful\npair. This was followed by the wish that some terrible danger should\nthreaten, so that he could fight, as he well knew how, with all his\nstrength and life, to defend them.",
        "“You’ll have to come along, dear,” the mother said. “It’s growing late.\"\nShe looked at Ross Shanklin hesitantly. “Would you care to have\nsomething to eat?”",
        "“No, ma’am, thanking you kindly just the same. I ... I ain’t hungry.”",
        "“Then say good-bye, Joan,” she counselled.",
        "“Good-bye.” The little girl held out her hand, and her eyes lighted\nroguishly. “Good-bye, Mr. Man from the bad, wicked world.”",
        "To him, the touch of her hand as he pressed it in his was the capstone\nof the whole adventure.",
        "“Good-bye, little fairy,” he mumbled. “I reckon I got to be pullin’\nalong.”",
        "But he did not pull along. He stood staring after his vision until it\nvanished through the gate. The day seemed suddenly empty. He looked\nabout him irresolutely, then climbed the fence, crossed the bridge, and\nslouched along the road. He was in a dream. He did not note his feet nor\nthe way they led him. At times he stumbled in the dust-filled ruts.",
        "A mile farther on, he aroused at the crossroads. Before him stood the\nsaloon. He came to a stop and stared at it, licking his lips. He sank\nhis hand into his pants pocket and fumbled a solitary dime. “God!” he\nmuttered. “God!” Then, with dragging, reluctant feet, went on along the\nroad.",
        "He came to a big farm. He knew it must be big, because of the bigness of\nthe house and the size and number of the barns and outbuildings. On the\nporch, in shirt sleeves, smoking a cigar, keen-eyed and middle-aged, was\nthe farmer.",
        "“What’s the chance for a job!” Ross Shanklin asked.",
        "The keen eyes scarcely glanced at him.",
        "“A dollar a day and grub,” was the answer.",
        "Ross Shanklin swallowed and braced himself.",
        "“I’ll pick grapes all right, or anything. But what’s the chance for a\nsteady job? You’ve got a big ranch here. I know hosses. I was born on\none. I can drive team, ride, plough, break, do anything that anybody\never done with hosses.”",
        "The other looked him over with an appraising, incredulous eye.",
        "“You don’t look it,” was the judgment.",
        "“I know I don’t. Give me a chance. That’s all. I’ll prove it.”",
        "The farmer considered, casting an anxious glance at the cloud bank into\nwhich the sun had sunk.",
        "“I’m short a teamster, and I’ll give you the chance to make good. Go and\nget supper with the hands.”",
        "Ross Shanklin’s voice was very husky, and he spoke with an effort.",
        "“All right. I’ll make good. Where can I get a drink of water and wash\nup?”",
        "He strolled to the corner and glanced up and down the intersecting\nstreet, but saw nothing save the oases of light shed by the street lamps\nat the successive crossings. Then he strolled back the way he had come.\nHe was a shadow of a man sliding noiselessly and without undue movement\nthrough the semi darkness. Also he was very alert, like a wild animal in\nthe jungle, keenly perceptive and receptive. The movement of another in\nthe darkness about him would need to have been more shadowy than he to\nhave escaped him.",
        "In addition to the running advertisement of the state of affairs carried\nto him by his senses, he had a subtler perception, a feel, of the\natmosphere around him. He knew that the house in front of which he\npaused for a moment, contained children. Yet by no willed effort of\nperception did he have this knowledge. For that matter, he was not even\naware that he knew, so occult was the impression. Yet, did a moment\narise in which action, in relation to that house, were imperative, he\nwould have acted on the assumption that it contained children. He was\nnot aware of all that he knew about the neighborhood.",
        "In the same way, he knew not how, he knew that no danger threatened in\nthe footfalls that came up the cross street. Before he saw the walker,\nhe knew him for a belated pedestrian hurrying home. The walker came into\nview at the crossing and disappeared on up the street. The man that\nwatched, noted a light that flared up in the window of a house on the\ncorner, and as it died down he knew it for an expiring match. This was\nconscious identification of familiar phenomena, and through his mind\nflitted the thought, “Wanted to know what time.” In another house one\nroom was lighted. The light burned dimly and steadily, and he had the\nfeel that it was a sick room.",
        "He was especially interested in a house across the street in the middle\nof the block. To this house he paid most attention. No matter what way\nhe looked, nor what way he walked, his looks and his steps always\nreturned to it. Except for an open window above the porch, there was\nnothing unusual about the house. Nothing came in nor out. Nothing\nhappened. There were no lighted windows, nor had lights appeared and\ndisappeared in any of the windows. Yet it was the central point of his\nconsideration. He rallied to it each time after a divination of the\nstate of the neighborhood.",
        "Despite his feel of things, he was not confident. He was supremely\nconscious of the precariousness of his situation. Though unperturbed by\nthe footfalls of the chance pedestrian, he was as keyed up and sensitive\nand ready to be startled as any timorous deer. He was aware of the\npossibility of other intelligences prowling about in the\ndarkness–intelligences similar to his own in movement, perception, and\ndivination.",
        "Far down the street he caught a glimpse of something that moved. And he\nknew it was no late home-goer, but menace and danger. He whistled twice\nto the house across the street, then faded away shadow-like to the\ncorner and around the corner. Here he paused and looked about him\ncarefully. Reassured, he peered back around the corner and studied the\nobject that moved and that was coming nearer. He had divined aright. It\nwas a policeman.",
        "The man went down the cross street to the next corner, from the shelter\nof which he watched the corner he had just left. He saw the policeman\npass by, going straight on up the street. He paralleled the policeman’s\ncourse, and from the next corner again watched him go by; then he\nreturned the way he had come. He whistled once to the house across the\nstreet, and after a time whistled once again. There was reassurance in\nthe whistle, just as there had been warning in the previous double\nwhistle.",
        "He saw a dark bulk outline itself on the roof of the porch and slowly\ndescend a pillar. Then it came down the steps, passed through the small\niron gate, and went down the sidewalk, taking on the form of a man. He\nthat watched kept on his own side the street and moved on abreast to the\ncorner, where he crossed over and joined the other. He was quite small\nalongside the man he accosted.",
        "“How’d you make out, Matt?” he asked.",
        "The other grunted indistinctly, and walked on in silence a few steps.",
        "“I reckon I landed the goods,” he said.",
        "Jim chuckled in the darkness, and waited for further information. The\nblocks passed by; under their feet, and he grew impatient.",
        "“Well, how about them goods?” he asked. “What kind of a haul did you\nmake, anyway?”",
        "“I was too busy to figger it out, but it’s fat. I can tell you that\nmuch, Jim, it’s fat. I don’t dast to think how fat it is. Wait till we\nget to the room.”",
        "Jim looked at him keenly under the street lamp of the next crossing, and\nsaw that his face was a trifle grim and that he carried his left arm\npeculiarly.",
        "“What’s the matter with your arm?” he demanded.",
        "“The little cuss bit me. Hope I don’t get hydrophoby. Folks gets\nhydrophoby from man-bite sometimes, don’t they?”",
        "“Gave you a fight, eh!” Jim asked encouragingly.",
        "The other grunted.",
        "“You’re certainly bard to get information from,” Jim burst out\nirritably. “Tell us about it. You ain’t goin’ to lose money just\na-tellin’ a guy.”",
        "“I guess I choked him some,” came the answer. Then, by way of\nexplanation, “He woke up on me.”",
        "“You did it neat. I never heard a sound.”",
        "“Jim,” the other said with seriousness, “it’s a hangin’ matter. I fixed\n’m. I had to. He woke up on me. You an’ me’s got to do some layin’ low\nfor a spell.”",
        "Jim gave a low whistle of comprehension.",
        "“Did you hear me whistle!” he asked suddenly.",
        "“Sure. I was all done. I was just comin’ out.”",
        "“It was a bull. But he wasn’t on a little bit. Went right by an’ kept\na-paddin’ the hoof outa sight. Then I came back an’ gave you the\nwhistle. What made you take so long after that?”",
        "“I was waitin’ to make sure,” Matt explained.",
        "“I was mighty glad when I heard you whistle again. It’s hard work\nwaitin’. I just sat there an’ thought an’ thought ... oh, all kinds of\nthings. It’s remarkable what a fellow’ll think about. And then there\nwas a darn cat that kept movin’ around the house an’ botherin’ me with\nits noises.”",
        "“An’ it’s fat!” Jim exclaimed irrelevantly and with joy.",
        "“I’m sure tellin’ you, Jim, it’s fat. I’m plum’ anxious for another look\nat ’em.”",
        "Unconsciously the two men quickened their pace. Yet they did not relax\nfrom their caution. Twice they changed their course in order to avoid\npolicemen, and they made very sure that they were not observed when they\ndived into the dark hallway of a cheap rooming house down town.",
        "Not until they had gained their own room on the top floor, did they\nscratch a match. While Jim lighted a lamp, Matt locked the door and\nthrew the bolts into place. As he turned, he noticed that his partner\nwas waiting expectantly. Matt smiled to himself at the other’s\neagerness.",
        "“Them search-lights is all right,” he said, drawing forth a small pocket\nelectric lamp and examining it. “But we got to get a new battery. It’s\nrunnin’ pretty weak. I thought once or twice it’d leave me in the dark.\nFunny arrangements in that house. I near got lost. His room was on the\nleft, an’ that fooled me some.”",
        "“I told you it was on the left,” Jim interrupted.",
        "“You told me it was on the right,” Matt went on. “I guess I know what\nyou told me, an’ there’s the map you drew.”",
        "Fumbling in his vest pocket, he drew out a folded slip of paper. As he\nunfolded it, Jim bent over and looked.",
        "“I did make a mistake,” he confessed.",
        "“You sure did. It got me guessin’ some for a while.”",
        "“But it don’t matter now,” Jim cried. “Let’s see what you got.”",
        "“It does matter,” Matt retorted. “It matters a lot ... to me. I’ve got\nto run all the risk. I put my head in the trap while you stay on the\nstreet. You got to get on to yourself an’ be more careful. All right,\nI’ll show you.”",
        "He dipped loosely into his trousers pocket and brought out a handful of\nsmall diamonds. He spilled them out in a blazing stream on the greasy\ntable. Jim let out a great oath.",
        "“That’s nothing,” Matt said with triumphant complacence. “I ain’t begun\nyet.”",
        "From one pocket after another he continued bringing forth the spoil.\nThere were many diamonds wrapped in chamois skin that were larger than\nthose in the first handful. From one pocket he brought out a handful of\nvery small cut gems.",
        "“Sun dust,” he remarked, as he spilled them on the table in a space by\nthemselves.",
        "Jim examined them.",
        "“Just the same, they retail for a couple of dollars each,” he said. “Is\nthat all?”",
        "“Ain’t it enough?” the other demanded in an aggrieved tone.",
        "“Sure it is,” Jim answered with unqualified approval. “Better’n I\nexpected. I wouldn’t take a cent less than ten thousan’ for the bunch.”",
        "“Ten thousan’,” Matt sneered. “They’re worth twic’t that, an’ I don’t\nknow anything about joolery, either. Look at that big boy!”",
        "He picked it out from the sparkling heap and held it near to the lamp\nwith the air of an expert, weighing and judging.",
        "“Worth a thousan’ all by its lonely,” was Jim’s quicker judgment.",
        "“A thousan’ your grandmother,” was Matt’s scornful rejoinder. “You\ncouldn’t buy it for three.”",
        "“Wake me up! I’m dreamin’!” The sparkle of the gems was in Jim’s eyes,\nand he began sorting out the larger diamonds and examining them. “We’re\nrich men, Matt–we’ll be regular swells.”",
        "“It’ll take years to get rid of ’em,” was Matt’s more practical thought.",
        "“But think how we’ll live! Nothin’ to do but spend the money an’ go on\ngettin’ rid of ’em.”",
        "Matt’s eyes were beginning to sparkle, though sombrely, as his\nphlegmatic nature woke up.",
        "“I told you I didn’t dast think how fat it was,” he murmured in a low\nvoice.",
        "“What a killin’! What a killin’!” was the other’s more ecstatic\nutterance.",
        "“I almost forgot,” Matt said, thrusting his hand into his inside coat\npocket.",
        "A string of large pearls emerged from wrappings of tissue paper and\nchamois skin. Jim scarcely glanced at them.",
        "“They’re worth money,” he said, and returned to the diamonds.",
        "A silence fell on the two men. Jim played with the gems, running them\nthrough his fingers, sorting them into piles, and spreading them out\nflat and wide. He was a slender, weazened man, nervous, irritable,\nhigh-strung, and anaemic–a typical child of the gutter, with\nunbeautiful twisted features, small eyes, with face and mouth\nperpetually and feverishly hungry, brutish in a catlike way, stamped to\nthe core with degeneracy.",
        "Matt did not finger the diamonds. He sat with chin on hands and elbows\non table, blinking heavily at the blazing array. He was in every way a\ncontrast to the other. No city had bred him. He was heavy muscled and\nhairy, gorilla-like in strength and aspect. For him there was no unseen\nworld. His eyes were full and wide apart, and there seemed in them a\ncertain bold brotherliness. They inspired confidence. But a closer\ninspection would have shown that his eyes were just a trifle too full,\njust a shade too wide apart. He exceeded, spilled over the limits of\nnormality, and his features told lies about the man beneath.",
        "“The bunch is worth fifty thousan’,” Jim remarked suddenly.",
        "“A hundred thousan’,” Matt said.",
        "The silence returned and endured a long time, to be broken again by Jim.",
        "“What in blazes was he doin’ with ’em all at the house?–that’s what I\nwant to know. I’d a-thought he’d kept ’em in the safe down at the\nstore.”",
        "Matt had just been considering the vision of the throttled man as he had\nlast looked upon him in the dim light of the electric lantern; but he\ndid not start at the mention of him.",
        "“There’s no tellin’,” he answered. “He might a-been getting ready to\nchuck his pardner. He might a-pulled out in the mornin’ for parts\nunknown, if we hadn’t happened along. I guess there’s just as many\nthieves among honest men as there is among thieves. You read about such\nthings in the papers, Jim. Pardners is always knifin’ each other.”",
        "A queer, nervous look came in the other’s eyes. Matt did not betray that\nhe noted it, though he said:–",
        "“What was you thinkin’ about, Jim!”",
        "Jim was a trifle awkward for the moment.",
        "“Nothin’,” he answered. “Only I was thinkin’ just how funny it was–all\nthem jools at his house. What made you ask?”",
        "“Nothin’. I was just wonderin’, that was all.”",
        "The silence settled down, broken by an occasional low and nervous giggle\non the part of Jim. He was overcome by the spread of gems. It was not\nthat he felt their beauty. He was unaware that they were beautiful in\nthemselves. But in them his swift imagination visioned the joys of life\nthey would buy, and all the desires and appetites of his diseased mind\nand sickly flesh were tickled by the promise they extended. He builded\nwondrous, orgy-haunted castles out of their brilliant fires, and was\nappalled at what he builded. Then it was that he giggled. It was all too\nimpossible to be real. And yet there they blazed on the table before\nhim, fanning the flame of the lust of him, and he giggled again.",
        "“I guess we might as well count ’em,” Matt said suddenly, tearing\nhimself away from his own visions. “You watch me an’ see that it’s\nsquare, because you an’ me has got to be on the square, Jim.\nUnderstand?”",
        "Jim did not like this, and betrayed it in his eyes, while Matt did not\nlike what he saw in his partner’s eyes.",
        "“Understand!” Matt repeated, almost menacingly.",
        "“Ain’t we always been square?” the other replied, on the defensive, what\nof the treachery already whispering in him.",
        "“It don’t cost nothin’, bein’ square in hard times,” Matt retorted.\n\"It’s bein’ square in prosperity that counts. When we ain’t got nothin’,\nwe can’t help bein’ square. We’re prosperous now, an’ we’ve got to be\nbusiness men–honest business men. Understand?”",
        "“That’s the talk for me,” Jim approved, but deep down in the meagre soul\nof him,–and in spite of him,–wanton and lawless thoughts were stirring\nlike chained beasts.",
        "Matt stepped to the food shelf behind the two-burner kerosene cooking\nstove. He emptied the tea from a paper bag, and from a second bag\nemptied some red peppers. Returning to the table with the bags, he put\ninto them the two sizes of small diamonds. Then he counted the large\ngems and wrapped them in their tissue paper and chamois skin.",
        "“Hundred an’ forty-seven good-sized ones,” was his inventory; “twenty\nreal big ones; two big boys and one whopper; an’ a couple of fistfuls of\nteeny ones an’ dust.”",
        "He looked at Jim.",
        "“Correct,” was the response.",
        "He wrote the count out on a slip of memorandum paper, and made a copy of\nit, giving one slip to his partner and retaining the other.",
        "“Just for reference,” he said.",
        "Again he had recourse to the food shelf, where he emptied the sugar from\na large paper bag. Into this he thrust the diamonds, large and small,\nwrapped it up in a bandana handkerchief, and stowed it away under his\npillow. Then he sat down on the edge of the bed and took off his shoes.",
        "“An’ you think they’re worth a hundred thousan’?” Jim asked, pausing and\nlooking up from the unlacing of his shoe.",
        "“Sure,” was the answer. “I seen a dancer down in Arizona once, with some\nbig sparklers on her. They wasn’t real. She said if they was she\nwouldn’t be dancin’. Said they’d be worth all of fifty thousan’, an’\nshe didn’t have a dozen of ’em all told.”",
        "“Who’d work for a livin’?” Jim triumphantly demanded. “Pick an’ shovel\nwork!” he sneered. “Work like a dog all my life, an’ save all my wages,\nan’ I wouldn’t have half as much as we got to-night.”",
        "“Dish washin’s about your measure, an’ you couldn’t get more’n twenty a\nmonth an’ board. Your figgers is ’way off, but your point is well taken.\nLet them that likes it, work. I rode range for thirty a month when I was\nyoung an’ foolish. Well, I’m older, an’ I ain’t ridin’ range.”",
        "He got into bed on one side. Jim put out the light and followed him in\non the other side.",
        "“How’s your arm feel?” Jim queried amiably.",
        "Such concern was unusual, and Matt noted it, and replied:–",
        "“I guess there’s no danger of hydrophoby. What made you ask?”",
        "Jim felt in himself a guilty stir, and under his breath he cursed the\nother’s way of asking disagreeable questions; but aloud he answered:\n\"Nothin’, only you seemed scared of it at first. What are you goin’ to\ndo with your share, Matt?”",
        "“Buy a cattle ranch in Arizona an’ set down an’ pay other men to ride\nrange for me. There’s some several I’d like to see askin’ a job from me,\nblast them! An’ now you shut your face, Jim. It’ll be some time before I\nbuy that ranch. Just now I’m goin’ to sleep.”",
        "But Jim lay long awake, nervous and twitching, rolling about restlessly\nand rolling himself wide awake every time he dozed. The diamonds still\nblazed under his eyelids, and the fire of them hurt. Matt, in spite of\nhis heavy nature, slept lightly, like a wild animal alert in its sleep;\nand Jim noticed, every time he moved, that his partner’s body moved\nsufficiently to show that it had received the impression and that it was\ntrembling on the verge of awakening. For that matter, Jim did not know\nwhether or not, frequently, the other was awake. Once, quietly,\nbetokening complete consciousness, Matt said to him: “Aw, go to sleep,\nJim. Don’t worry about them jools. They’ll keep.” And Jim had thought\nthat at that particular moment Matt had been surely asleep.",
        "In the late morning Matt was awake with Jim’s first movement, and\nthereafter he awoke and dozed with him until midday, when they got up\ntogether and began dressing.",
        "“I’m goin’ out to get a paper an’ some bread,” Matt said. “You boil the\ncoffee.”",
        "As Jim listened, unconsciously his gaze left Matt’s face and roved to\nthe pillow, beneath which was the bundle wrapped in the bandana\nhandkerchief. On the instant Matt’s face became like a wild beast’s.",
        "“Look here, Jim,” he snarled. “You’ve got to play square. If you do me\ndirt, I’ll fix you. Understand? I’d eat you, Jim. You know that. I’d\nbite right into your throat an’ eat you like that much beefsteak.”",
        "His sunburned skin was black with the surge of blood in it, and his\ntobacco-stained teeth were exposed by the snarling lips. Jim shivered\nand involuntarily cowered. There was death in the man he looked at. Only\nthe night before that black-faced man had killed another with his hands,\nand it had not hurt his sleep. And in his own heart Jim was aware of a\nsneaking guilt, of a train of thought that merited all that was\nthreatened.",
        "Matt passed out, leaving him still shivering. Then a hatred twisted his\nown face, and he softly hurled savage threats at the door. He remembered\nthe jewels, and hastened to the bed, feeling under the pillow for the\nbandana bundle. He crushed it with his fingers to make certain that it\nstill contained the diamonds. Assured that Matt had not carried them\naway, he looked toward the kerosene stove with a guilty start. Then he\nhurriedly lighted it, filled the coffee pot at the sink, and put it over\nthe flame.",
        "The coffee was boiling when Matt returned, and while the latter cut the\nbread and put a slice of butter on the table, Jim poured out the coffee.\nIt was not until he sat down and had taken a few sips of the coffee,\nthat Matt pulled out the morning paper from his pocket.",
        "“We was way off,” he said. “I told you I didn’t dast figger out how fat\nit was. Look at that.”",
        "He pointed to the head lines on the first page. “SWIFT NEMESIS ON\nBUJANNOFF’S TRACK,” they read. “MURDERED IN HIS SLEEP AFTER ROBBING HIS\nPARTNER.”",
        "“There you have it!” Matt cried. “He robbed his partner–robbed him\nlike a dirty thief.”",
        "“Half a million of jewels missin’,” Jim read aloud. He put the paper\ndown and stared at Matt.",
        "“That’s what I told you,” the latter said. “What in thunder do we know\nabout jools? Half a million!–an’ the best I could figger it was a\nhundred thousan’. Go on an’ read the rest of it.”",
        "They read on silently, their heads side by side, the untouched coffee\ngrowing cold; and ever and anon one or the other burst forth with some\nsalient printed fact.",
        "“I’d like to seen Metzner’s face when he opened the safe at the store\nthis mornin’,” Jim gloated.",
        "“He hit the high places right away for Bujannoff’s house,” Matt\nexplained. “Go on an’ read.”",
        "“Was to have sailed last night at ten on the Sajoda for the South\nSeas–steamship delayed by extra freight––”",
        "“That’s why we caught ’m in bed,” Matt interrupted. “It was just\nluck–like pickin’ a fifty-to-one winner.”",
        "“Sajoda sailed at six this mornin’––”",
        "“He didn’t catch her,” Matt said. “I saw his alarm clock was set at\nfive. That’d given ’m plenty of time ... only I come along an’ put the\nkibosh on his time. Go on.”",
        "“Adolph Metzner in despair–the famous Haythorne pearl\nnecklace–magnificently assorted pearls–valued by experts at from fifty\nto seventy thousan’ dollars.”",
        "Jim broke off to say solemnly, “Those oyster-eggs worth all that money!”",
        "He licked his lips and added, “They was beauties an’ no mistake.”",
        "“Big Brazilian gem,” he read on. “Eighty thousan’ dollars–many valuable\ngems of the first water–several thousan’ small diamonds well worth\nforty thousan’.”",
        "“What you don’t know about jools is worth knowin’,” Matt smiled good\nhumoredly.",
        "“Theory of the sleuths,” Jim read. “Thieves must have known–cleverly\nkept watch on Bujannoff’s actions–must have learned his plan and\ntrailed him to his house with the fruits of his robbery–”",
        "“Clever–” Matt broke out. “That’s the way reputations is made ... in\nthe noos-papers. How’d we know he was robbin’ his pardner?”",
        "“Anyway, we’ve got the goods,” Jim grinned. “Let’s look at ’em again.”",
        "He assured himself that the door was locked and bolted, while Matt\nbrought out the bundle in the bandana and opened it on the table.",
        "“Ain’t they beauties, though!” Jim exclaimed at sight of the pearls; and\nfor a time he had eyes only for them. “Accordin’ to the experts, worth\nfrom fifty to seventy thousan’ dollars.”",
        "“An’ women like them things,” Matt commented. “An’ they’ll do everything\nto get ’em–sell themselves, commit murder, anything.”",
        "“Just like you an’ me.”",
        "“Not on your life,” Matt retorted. “I’ll commit murder for ’em, but not\nfor their own sakes, but for the sake of what they’ll get me. That’s the\ndifference. Women want the jools for themselves, an’ I want the jools\nfor the women an’ such things they’ll get me.”",
        "“Lucky that men an’ women don’t want the same things,” Jim remarked.",
        "“That’s what makes commerce,” Matt agreed; “people wantin’ different\nthings.”",
        "In the middle of the afternoon Jim went out to buy food. While he was\ngone, Matt cleared the table of the jewels, wrapping them up as before\nand putting them under the pillow. Then he lighted the kerosene stove\nand started to boil water for the coffee. A few minutes later, Jim\nreturned.",
        "“Most surprising,” he remarked. “Streets, an’ stores, an’ people just\nlike they always was. Nothin’ changed. An’ me walkin’ along through it\nall a millionnaire. Nobody looked at me an’ guessed it”",
        "Matt grunted unsympathetically. He had little comprehension of the\nlighter whims and fancies of his partner’s imagination.",
        "“Did you get a porterhouse?” he demanded.",
        "“Sure, an’ an inch thick. It’s a peach. Look at it.”",
        "He unwrapped the steak and held it up for the other’s inspection. Then\nhe made the coffee and set the table, while Matt fried the steak.",
        "“Don’t put on too much of them red peppers,” Jim warned. “I ain’t used\nto your Mexican cookin’. You always season too hot.”",
        "Matt grunted a laugh and went on with his cooking. Jim poured out the\ncoffee, but first, into the nicked china cup, he emptied a powder he had\ncarried in his vest pocket wrapped in a rice-paper. He had turned his\nback for the moment on his partner, but he did not dare to glance around\nat him. Matt placed a newspaper on the table, and on the newspaper set\nthe hot frying pan. He cut the steak in half, and served Jim and\nhimself.",
        "“Eat her while she’s hot,” he counselled, and with knife and fork set\nthe example.",
        "“She’s a dandy,” was Jim’s judgment, after his first mouthful. “But I\ntell you one thing straight. I’m never goin’ to visit you on that\nArizona ranch, so you needn’t ask me.”",
        "“What’s the matter now?” Matt asked.",
        "“The Mexican cookin’ on your ranch’d be too much for me. If I’ve got\nblue blazes a-comin’ in the next life, I’m not goin’ to torment my\ninsides in this one!”",
        "He smiled, expelled his breath forcibly to cool his burning mouth, drank\nsome coffee, and went on eating the steak.",
        "“What do you think about the next life anyway, Matt?” he asked a little\nlater, while secretly he wondered why the other had not yet touched his\ncoffee.",
        "“Ain’t no next life,” Matt answered, pausing from the steak to take his\nfirst sip of coffee. “Nor heaven nor hell, nor nothin’. You get all\nthat’s comin’ right here in this life.”",
        "“An’ afterward?” Jim queried out of his morbid curiosity, for he knew\nthat he looked upon a man that was soon to die. “An’ afterward?” he\nrepeated.",
        "“Did you ever see a man two weeks dead?” the other asked.",
        "Jim shook his head.",
        "“Well, I have. He was like this beefsteak you an’ me is eatin’. It was\nonce steer cavortin’ over the landscape. But now it’s just meat. That’s\nall, just meat. An’ that’s what you an’ me an’ all people come\nto–meat.”",
        "Matt gulped down the whole cup of coffee, and refilled the cup.",
        "“Are you scared to die?” he asked.",
        "Jim shook his head. “What’s the use? I don’t die anyway. I pass on an’\nlive again–”",
        "“To go stealin’, an’ lyin’, an’ snivellin’ through another life, an’ go\non that way forever an’ ever an’ ever?” Matt sneered.",
        "“Maybe I’ll improve,” Jim suggested hopefully. “Maybe stealin’ won’t be\nnecessary in the life to come.”",
        "He ceased abruptly, and stared straight before him, a frightened\nexpression on his face.",
        "“What’s the matter!” Matt demanded.",
        "“Nothin’. I was just wonderin’\"–Jim returned to himself with an\neffort–\"about this dyin’, that was all.”",
        "But he could not shake off the fright that had startled him. It was as\nif an unseen thing of gloom had passed him by, casting upon him the\nintangible shadow of its presence. He was aware of a feeling of\nforeboding. Something ominous was about to happen. Calamity hovered in\nthe air. He gazed fixedly across the table at the other man. He could\nnot understand. Was it that he had blundered and poisoned himself? No,\nMatt had the nicked cup, and he had certainly put the poison in the\nnicked cup.",
        "It was all his own imagination, was his next thought. It had played him\ntricks before. Fool! Of course it was. Of course something was about to\nhappen, but it was about to happen to Matt. Had not Matt drunk the\nwhole cup of coffee?",
        "Jim brightened up and finished his steak, sopping bread in the gravy\nwhen the meat was gone.",
        "“When I was a kid–” he began, but broke off abruptly.",
        "Again the unseen thing of gloom had fluttered, and his being was vibrant\nwith premonition of impending misfortune. He felt a disruptive influence\nat work in the flesh of him, and in all his muscles there was a seeming\nthat they were about to begin to twitch. He sat back suddenly, and as\nsuddenly leaned forward with his elbows on the table. A tremor ran dimly\nthrough the muscles of his body. It was like the first rustling of\nleaves before the oncoming of wind. He clenched his teeth. It came\nagain, a spasmodic tensing of his muscles. He knew panic at the revolt\nwithin his being. His muscles no longer recognized his mastery over\nthem. Again they spasmodically tensed, despite the will of him, for he\nhad willed that they should not tense. This was revolution within\nhimself, this was anarchy; and the terror of impotence rushed up in him\nas his flesh gripped and seemed to seize him in a clutch, chills running\nup and down his back and sweat starting on his brow. He glanced about\nthe room, and all the details of it smote him with a strange sense of\nfamiliarity. It was as though he had just returned from a long journey.\nHe looked across the table at his partner. Matt was watching him and\nsmiling. An expression of horror spread over Jim’s face.",
        "“Matt!” he screamed. “You ain’t doped me?”",
        "Matt smiled and continued to watch him. In the paroxysm that followed,\nJim did not become unconscious. His muscles tensed and twitched and\nknotted, hurting him and crushing him in their savage grip. And in the\nmidst of it all, it came to him that Matt was acting queerly. He was\ntraveling the same road. The smile had gone from his face, and there was\non it an intense expression, as if he were listening to some inner tale\nof himself and trying to divine the message. Matt got up and walked\nacross the room and back again, then sat down.",
        "“You did this, Jim,” he said quietly.",
        "“But I didn’t think you’d try to fix me,” Jim answered reproachfully.",
        "“Oh, I fixed you all right,” Matt said, with teeth close together and\nshivering body. “What did you give me?”",
        "“Strychnine.”",
        "“Same as I gave you,” Matt volunteered. “It’s some mess, ain’t it!”",
        "“You’re lyin’, Matt,” Jim pleaded. “You ain’t doped me, have you?”",
        "“I sure did, Jim; an’ I didn’t overdose you, neither. I cooked it in as\nneat as you please in your half the porterhouse.–Hold on! Where’re you\ngoin’?”",
        "Jim had made a dash for the door, and was throwing back the bolts. Matt\nsprang in between and shoved him away.",
        "“Drug store,” Jim panted. “Drug store.”",
        "“No you don’t. You’ll stay right here. There ain’t goin’ to be any\nrunnin’ out an’ makin’ a poison play on the street–not with all them\njools reposin’ under the pillow. Savve? Even if you didn’t die, you’d be\nin the hands of the police with a lot of explanations comin’. Emetics is\nthe stuff for poison. I’m just as bad bit as you, an’ I’m goin’ to take\na emetic. That’s all they’d give you at a drug store, anyway.”",
        "He thrust Jim back into the middle of the room and shot the bolts into\nplace. As he went across the floor to the food shelf, he passed one hand\nover his brow and flung off the beaded sweat. It spattered audibly on\nthe floor. Jim watched agonizedly as Matt got the mustard can and a cup\nand ran for the sink. He stirred a cupful of mustard and water and drank\nit down. Jim had followed him and was reaching with trembling hands for\nthe empty cup. Again Matt shoved him away. As he mixed a second cupful,\nhe demanded:",
        "“D’you think one cup’ll do for me? You can wait till I’m done.”",
        "Jim started to totter toward the door, but Matt checked him.",
        "“If you monkey with that door, I’ll twist your neck. Savve? You can take\nyours when I’m done. An’ if it saves you, I’ll twist your neck, anyway.\nYou ain’t got no chance, nohow. I told you many times what you’d get if\nyou did me dirt.”",
        "“But you did me dirt, too,” Jim articulated with an effort.",
        "Matt was drinking the second cupful, and did not answer. The sweat had\ngot into Jim’s eyes, and he could scarcely see his way to the table,\nwhere he got a cup for himself. But Matt was mixing a third cupful, and,\nas before, thrust him away.",
        "“I told you to wait till I was done,” Matt growled. “Get outa my way.”",
        "And Jim supported his twitching body by holding on to the sink, the\nwhile he yearned toward the yellowish concoction that stood for life. It\nwas by sheer will that he stood and clung to the sink. His flesh strove\nto double him up and bring him to the floor. Matt drank the third\ncupful, and with difficulty managed to get to a chair and sit down. His\nfirst paroxysm was passing. The spasms that afflicted him were dying\naway. This good effect he ascribed to the mustard and water. He was\nsafe, at any rate. He wiped the sweat from his face, and, in the\ninterval of calm, found room for curiosity. He looked at his partner.",
        "A spasm had shaken the mustard can out of Jim’s hands, and the contents\nwere spilled upon the floor. He stooped to scoop some of the mustard\ninto the cup, and the succeeding spasm doubled him up on the floor. Matt\nsmiled.",
        "“Stay with it,” he encouraged. “It’s the stuff all right. It’s fixed me\nup.”",
        "Jim heard him and turned toward him with a stricken face, twisted with\nsuffering and pleading. Spasm now followed spasm till he was in\nconvulsions, rolling on the floor and yellowing his face and hair in the\nmustard.",
        "Matt laughed hoarsely at the sight, but the laugh broke midway. A tremor\nhad run through his body. A new paroxysm was beginning. He arose and\nstaggered across to the sink, where, with probing forefinger, he vainly\nstrove to assist the action of the emetic. In the end, he clung to the\nsink as Jim had clung, filled with the horror of going down to the\nfloor.",
        "The other’s paroxysm had passed, and he sat up, weak and fainting, too\nweak to rise, his forehead dripping, his lips flecked with a foam made\nyellow by the mustard in which he had rolled. He rubbed his eyes with\nhis knuckles, and groans that were like whines came from his throat.",
        "“What are you snifflin’ about!” Matt demanded out of his agony. “All you\ngot to do is die. An’ when you die you’re dead.”",
        "“I ... ain’t ... snifflin’ ... it’s ... the ... mustard ... stingin’\n... my ... eyes,” Jim panted with desperate slowness.",
        "It was his last successful attempt at speech. Thereafter he babbled\nincoherently, pawing the air with shaking arms till a fresh convulsion\nstretched him on the floor.",
        "Matt struggled back to the chair, and, doubled up on it, with his arms\nclasped about his knees, he fought with his disintegrating flesh. He\ncame out of the convulsion cool and weak. He looked to see how it went\nwith the other, and saw him lying motionless.",
        "He tried to soliloquize, to be facetious, to have his last grim laugh at\nlife, but his lips made only incoherent sounds. The thought came to him\nthat the emetic had failed, and that nothing remained but the drug\nstore. He looked toward the door and drew himself to his feet. There he\nsaved himself from falling by clutching the chair. Another paroxysm had\nbegun. And in the midst of the paroxysm, with his body and all the parts\nof it flying apart and writhing and twisting back again into knots, he\nclung to the chair and shoved it before him across the floor. The last\nshreds of his will were leaving him when he gained the door. He turned\nthe key and shot back one bolt. He fumbled for the second bolt, but\nfailed. Then he leaned his weight against the door and slid down gently\nto the floor.",
        "In the morning calm of Korea, when its peace and tranquility truly\nmerited its ancient name, “Cho-sen,” there lived a politician by name Yi\nChin Ho. He was a man of parts, and–who shall say?–perhaps in no wise\nworse than politicians the world over. But, unlike his brethren in other\nlands, Yi Chin Ho was in jail. Not that he had inadvertently diverted to\nhimself public moneys, but that he had inadvertently diverted too much.\nExcess is to be deplored in all things, even in grafting, and Yi Chin\nHo’s excess had brought him to most deplorable straits.",
        "Ten thousand strings of cash he owed the government, and he lay in\nprison under sentence of death. There was one advantage to the\nsituation–he had plenty of time in which to think. And he thought well.\nThen called he the jailer to him.",
        "“Most worthy man, you see before you one most wretched,” he began. “Yet\nall will be well with me if you will but let me go free for one short\nhour this night. And all will be well with you, for I shall see to your\nadvancement through the years, and you shall come at length to the\ndirectorship of all the prisons of Cho-sen.”",
        "“How now?” demanded the jailer. “What foolishness is this? One short\nhour, and you but waiting for your head to be chopped off! And I, with\nan aged and much-to-be-respected mother, not to say anything of a wife\nand several children of tender years! Out upon you for the scoundrel\nthat you are!”",
        "“From the Sacred City to the ends of all the Eight Coasts there is no\nplace for me to hide,” Yi Chin Ho made reply. “I am a man of wisdom, but\nof what worth my wisdom here in prison? Were I free, well I know I could\nseek out and obtain the money wherewith to repay the government. I know\nof a nose that will save me from all my difficulties.”",
        "“A nose!” cried the jailer.",
        "“A nose,” said Yi Chin Ho. “A remarkable nose, if I may say so, a most\nremarkable nose.”",
        "The jailer threw up his hands despairingly. “Ah, what a wag you are,\nwhat a wag,” he laughed. “To think that that very admirable wit of yours\nmust go the way of the chopping-block!”",
        "And so saying, he turned and went away. But in the end, being a man soft\nof head and heart, when the night was well along he permitted Yi Chin Ho\nto go.",
        "Straight he went to the Governor, catching him alone and arousing him\nfrom his sleep.",
        "“Yi Chin Ho, or I’m no Governor!” cried the Governor. “What do you here\nwho should be in prison waiting on the chopping-block!”",
        "“I pray your excellency to listen to me,” said Yi Chin Ho, squatting on\nhis hams by the bedside and lighting his pipe from the fire-box. “A dead\nman is without value. It is true, I am as a dead man, without value to\nthe government, to your excellency, or to myself. But if, so to say,\nyour excellency were to give me my freedom–”",
        "“Impossible!” cried the Governor. “Besides, you are condemned to death.”",
        "“Your excellency well knows that if I can repay the ten thousand strings\nof cash, the government will pardon me,” Yi Chin Ho went on. “So, as I\nsay, if your excellency were to give me my freedom for a few days, being\na man of understanding, I should then repay the government and be in\nposition to be of service to your excellency. I should be in position to\nbe of very great service to your excellency.”",
        "“Have you a plan whereby you hope to obtain this money?” asked the\nGovernor.",
        "“I have,” said Yi Chin Ho.",
        "“Then come with it to me to-morrow night; I would now sleep,” said the\nGovernor, taking up his snore where it had been interrupted.",
        "On the following night, having again obtained leave of absence from the\njailer, Yi Chin Ho presented himself at the Governor’s bedside.",
        "“Is it you, Yi Chin Ho?” asked the Governor. “And have you the plan?”",
        "“It is I, your excellency,” answered Yi Chin Ho, “and the plan is here.”",
        "“Speak,” commanded the Governor.",
        "“The plan is here,” repeated Yi Chin Ho, “here in my hand.”",
        "The Governor sat up and opened his eyes, Yi Chin Ho proffered in his\nhand a sheet of paper. The Governor held it to the light.",
        "“Nothing but a nose,” said he.",
        "“A bit pinched, so, and so, your excellency,” said Yi Chin Ho.",
        "“Yes, a bit pinched here and there, as you say,” said the Governor.",
        "“Withal it is an exceeding corpulent nose, thus, and so, all in one\nplace, at the end,” proceeded Yi Chin Ho. “Your excellency would seek\nfar and wide and many a day for that nose and find it not.”",
        "“An unusual nose,” admitted the Governor.",
        "“There is a wart upon it,” said Yi Chin Ho.",
        "“A most unusual nose,” said the Governor. “Never have I seen the like.\nBut what do you with this nose, Yi Chin Ho!”",
        "“I seek it whereby to repay the money to the government,” said Yi Chin\nHo. “I seek it to be of service to your excellency, and I seek it to\nsave my own worthless head. Further, I seek your excellency’s seal upon\nthis picture of the nose.”",
        "And the Governor laughed and affixed the seal of state, and Yi Chin Ho\ndeparted. For a month and a day he traveled the King’s Road which leads\nto the shore of the Eastern Sea; and there, one night, at the gate of\nthe largest mansion of a wealthy city he knocked loudly for admittance.",
        "“None other than the master of the house will I see,” said he fiercely\nto the frightened servants. “I travel upon the King’s business.”",
        "Straightway was he led to an inner room, where the master of the house\nwas roused from his sleep and brought blinking before him.",
        "“You are Pak Chung Chang, head man of this city,” said Yi Chin Ho in\ntones that were all-accusing. “I am upon the King’s business.”",
        "Pak Chung Chang trembled. Well he knew the King’s business was ever a\nterrible business. His knees smote together, and he near fell to the\nfloor.",
        "“The hour is late,” he quavered. “Were it not well to––”",
        "“The King’s business never waits!” thundered Yi Chin Ho. “Come apart\nwith me, and swiftly. I have an affair of moment to discuss with you.",
        "“It is the King’s affair,” he added with even greater fierceness; so\nthat Pak Chung Chang’s silver pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers\nand clattered on the floor.",
        "“Know then,” said Yi Chin Ho, when they had gone apart, “that the King\nis troubled with an affliction, a very terrible affliction. In that he\nfailed to cure, the Court physician has had nothing else than his head\nchopped off. From all the Eight Provinces have the physicians come to\nwait upon the King. Wise consultation have they held, and they have\ndecided that for a remedy for the King’s affliction nothing else is\nrequired than a nose, a certain kind of nose, a very peculiar certain\nkind of nose.",
        "“Then by none other was I summoned than his excellency the prime\nminister himself. He put a paper into my hand. Upon this paper was the\nvery peculiar kind of nose drawn by the physicians of the Eight\nProvinces, with the seal of state upon it.",
        "“’Go,’ said his excellency the prime minister. ’Seek out this nose, for\nthe King’s affliction is sore. And wheresoever you find this nose upon\nthe face of a man, strike it off forthright and bring it in all haste to\nthe Court, for the King must be cured. Go, and come not back until your\nsearch is rewarded.’",
        "“And so I departed upon my quest,” said Yi Chin Ho. “I have sought out\nthe remotest corners of the kingdom; I have traveled the Eight\nHighways, searched the Eight Provinces, and sailed the seas of the Eight\nCoasts. And here I am.”",
        "With a great flourish he drew a paper from his girdle, unrolled it with\nmany snappings and cracklings, and thrust it before the face of Pak\nChung Chang. Upon the paper was the picture of the nose.",
        "Pak Chung Chang stared upon it with bulging eyes.",
        "“Never have I beheld such a nose,” he began.",
        "“There is a wart upon it,” said Yi Chin Ho.",
        "“Never have I beheld––” Pak Chung Chang began again.",
        "“Bring your father before me,” Yi Chin Ho interrupted sternly.",
        "“My ancient and very-much-to-be-respected ancestor sleeps,” said Pak\nChung Chang.",
        "“Why dissemble?” demanded Yi Chin Ho. “You know it is your father’s\nnose. Bring him before me that I may strike it off and be gone. Hurry,\nlest I make bad report of you.”",
        "“Mercy!” cried Pak Chung Chang, falling on his knees. “It is impossible!\nIt is impossible! You cannot strike off my father’s nose. He cannot go\ndown without his nose to the grave. He will become a laughter and a\nbyword, and all my days and nights will be filled with woe. O reflect!\nReport that you have seen no such nose in your travels. You, too, have a\nfather.”",
        "Pak Chung Chang clasped Yi Chin Ho’s knees and fell to weeping on his\nsandals.",
        "“My heart softens strangely at your tears,” said Yi Chin Ho. “I, too,\nknow filial piety and regard. But–” He hesitated, then added, as though\nthinking aloud, “It is as much as my head is worth.”",
        "“How much is your head worth?” asked Pak Chung Chang in a thin, small\nvoice.",
        "“A not remarkable head,” said Yi Chin Ho. “An absurdly unremarkable\nhead! but, such is my great foolishness, I value it at nothing less than\none hundred thousand strings of cash.”",
        "“So be it,” said Pak Chung Chang, rising to his feet.",
        "“I shall need horses to carry the treasure,” said Yi Chin Ho, “and men\nto guard it well as I journey through the mountains. There are robbers\nabroad in the land.”",
        "“There are robbers abroad in the land,” said Pak Chung Chang, sadly.\n\"But it shall be as you wish, so long as my ancient and\nvery-much-to-be-respected ancestor’s nose abide in its appointed\nplace.”",
        "“Say nothing to any man of this occurrence,” said Yi Chin Ho, “else will\nother and more loyal servants than I be sent to strike off your father’s\nnose.”",
        "And so Yi Chin Ho departed on his way through the mountains, blithe of\nheart and gay of song as he listened to the jingling bells of his\ntreasure-laden ponies.",
        "There is little more to tell. Yi Chin Ho prospered through the years. By\nhis efforts the jailer attained at length to the directorship of all the\nprisons of Cho-sen; the Governor ultimately betook himself to the Sacred\nCity to be prime minister to the King, while Yi Chin Ho became the\nKing’s boon companion and sat at table with him to the end of a round,\nfat life. But Pak Chung Chang fell into a melancholy, and ever after he\nshook his head sadly, with tears in his eyes, whenever he regarded the\nexpensive nose of his ancient and very-much-to-be-respected ancestor.",
