        "MADAME CAMPAN’S narrative breaking off abruptly at the time of the\npainful end met with by her sister, we have supplemented it by abridged\naccounts of the chief incidents in the tragedy which overwhelmed the\nroyal house she so faithfully served, taken from contemporary records and\nthe best historical authorities.",
        "                     The Royal Family in the Temple.",
        "The Assembly having, at the instance of the Commune of Paris, decreed\nthat the royal family should be immured in the Temple, they were removed\nthither from the Feuillans on the 13th of August, 1792, in the charge of\nPotion, Mayor of Paris, and Santerre, the commandant-general.  Twelve\nCommissioners of the general council were to keep constant watch at the\nTemple, which had been fortified by earthworks and garrisoned by\ndetachments of the National Guard, no person being allowed to enter\nwithout permission from the municipality.",
        "The Temple, formerly the headquarters of the Knights Templars in Paris,\nconsisted of two buildings,–the Palace, facing the Rue de Temple,\nusually occupied by one of the Princes of the blood; and the Tower,\nstanding behind the Palace.",
        "     [Clery gives a more minute description of this singular building:\n     “The small tower of the Temple in which the King was then confined\n     stood with its back against the great tower, without any interior\n     communication, and formed a long square, flanked by two turrets.  In\n     one of these turrets there was a narrow staircase that led from the\n     first floor to a gallery on the platform; in the other were small\n     rooms, answering to each story of the tower.  The body of the\n     building was four stories high.  The first consisted of an\n     antechamber, a dining-room, and a small room in the turret, where\n     there was a library containing from twelve to fifteen hundred\n     volumes.  The second story was divided nearly in the same manner.\n     The largest room was the Queen’s bedchamber, in which the Dauphin\n     also slept; the second, which was separated from the Queen’s by a\n     small antechamber almost without light, was occupied by Madame\n     Royale and Madame Elisabeth.  The King’s apartments were on the\n     third story.  He slept in the great room, and made a study of the\n     turret closet.  There was a kitchen separated from the King’s\n     chamber by a small dark room, which had been successively occupied\n     by M. de Chamilly and M. de Hue.  The fourth story was shut up; and\n     on the ground floor there were kitchens of which no use was made.\"\n     –\"Journal,” p. 96.]",
        "The Tower was a square building, with a round tower at each corner and a\nsmall turret on one side, usually called the Tourelle.  In the narrative\nof the Duchesse d’Angouleme she says that the soldiers who escorted the\nroyal prisoners wished to take the King alone to the Tower, and his\nfamily to the Palace of the Temple, but that on the way Manuel received\nan order to imprison them all in the Tower, where so little provision had\nbeen made for their reception that Madame Elisabeth slept in the kitchen.\nThe royal family were accompanied by the Princesse de Lamballe, Madame de\nTourzel and her daughter Pauline, Mesdames de Navarre, de Saint-Brice,\nThibaut, and Bazire, MM. de Hug and de Chamilly, and three men-servants–\nAn order from the Commune soon removed these devoted attendants, and M.\nde Hue alone was permitted to return.  “We all passed the day together,\"\nsays Madame Royale.  “My father taught my brother geography; my mother\nhistory, and to learn verses by heart; and my aunt gave him lessons in\narithmetic.  My father fortunately found a library which amused him, and\nmy mother worked tapestry .  .  .  .  We went every day to walk in the\ngarden, for the sake of my brother’s health, though the King was always\ninsulted by the guard.  On the Feast of Saint Louis ’Ca Ira’ was sung\nunder the walls of the Temple.  Manuel that evening brought my aunt a\nletter from her aunts at Rome.  It was the last the family received from\nwithout.  My father was no longer called King.  He was treated with no\nkind of respect; the officers always sat in his presence and never took\noff their hats.  They deprived him of his sword and searched his pockets\n.  .  .  .  Petion sent as gaoler the horrible man –[Rocher, a saddler\nby trade] who had broken open my father’s door on the 20th June, 1792,\nand who had been near assassinating him.  This man never left the Tower,\nand was indefatigable in endeavouring to torment him.  One time he would\nsing the ’Caramgnole,’ and a thousand other horrors, before us; again,\nknowing that my mother disliked the smoke of tobacco, he would puff it in\nher face, as well as in that of my father, as they happened to pass him.\nHe took care always to be in bed before we went to supper, because he\nknew that we must pass through his room.  My father suffered it all with\ngentleness, forgiving the man from the bottom of his heart.  My mother\nbore it with a dignity that frequently repressed his insolence.\"\nThe only occasion, Madame Royale adds, on which the Queen showed any\nimpatience at the conduct of the officials, was when a municipal officer\nwoke the Dauphin suddenly in the night to make certain that he was safe,\nas though the sight of the peacefully sleeping child would not have been\nin itself the best assurance.",
        "Clery, the valet de chambre of the Dauphin, having with difficulty\nobtained permission to resume his duties, entered the Temple on the 24th\nAugust, and for eight days shared with M. de Hue the personal attendance;\nbut on the 2d September De Hue was arrested, seals were placed on the\nlittle room he had occupied, and Clery passed the night in that of the\nKing.  On the following morning Manuel arrived, charged by the Commune to\ninform the King that De Hue would not be permitted to return, and to\noffer to send another person.  “I thank you,” answered the King.  “I will\nmanage with the valet de chambre of my son; and if the Council refuse I\nwill serve myself.  I am determined to do it.”  On the 3d September\nManual visited the Temple and assured the King that Madame de Lamballe\nand all the other prisoners who had been removed to La Force were well,\nand safely guarded.  “But at three o’clock,” says Madame Royale, “just\nafter dinner, and as the King was sitting down to ’tric trac’ with my\nmother (which he played for the purpose of having an opportunity of saying\na few words to her unheard by the keepers), the most horrid shouts were\nheard.  The officer who happened to be on guard in the room behaved well.\nHe shut the door and the window, and even drew the curtains to prevent\ntheir seeing anything; but outside the workmen and the gaoler Rocher\njoined the assassins and increased the tumult.  Several officers of the\nguard and the municipality now arrived, and on my father’s asking what\nwas the matter, a young officer replied, ’Well, since you will know,\nit is the head of Madame de Lamballe that they want to show you.’\nAt these words my mother was overcome with horror; it was the only\noccasion on which her firmness abandoned her.  The municipal officers\nwere very angry with the young man; but the King, with his usual\ngoodness, excused him, saying that it was his own fault, since he had\nquestioned the officer.  The noise lasted till five o’clock.  We learned\nthat the people had wished to force the door, and that the municipal\nofficers had been enabled to prevent it only by putting a tricoloured\nscarf across it, and allowing six of the murderers to march round our\nprison with the head of the Princess, leaving at the door her body, which\nthey would have dragged in also.”",
        "Clery was not so fortunate as to escape the frightful spectacle.  He had\ngone down to dine with Tison and his wife, employed as servants in the\nTemple, and says: “We were hardly seated when a head, on the end of a\npike, was presented at the window.  Tison’s wife gave a great cry; the\nassassins fancied they recognised the Queen’s voice, and responded by\nsavage laughter.  Under the idea that his Majesty was still at table,\nthey placed their dreadful trophy where it must be seen.  It was the head\nof the Princesse de Lamballe; although bleeding, it was not disfigured,\nand her light hair, still in curls, hung about the pike.”",
        "At length the immense mob that surrounded the Temple gradually withdrew,\n“to follow the head of the Princess de Lamballe to the Palais Royal.”",
        "     [The pike that bore the head was fixed before the Duc d’Orleans’s\n     window as he was going to dinner.  It is said that he looked at this\n     horrid sight without horror, went into the dining-room, sat down to\n     table, and helped his guests without saying a word.  His silence and\n     coolness left it doubtful whether the assassins, in presenting him\n     this bloody trophy, intended to offer him an insult or to pay him\n     homage.–DE MOLLEVILLE’S “Annals of the French Revolution,” vol.\n     vii., p.  398.]",
        "Meanwhile the royal family could scarcely believe that for the time their\nlives were saved.  “My aunt and I heard the drums beating to arms all\nnight,” says Madame Royale; “my unhappy mother did not even attempt to\nsleep.  We heard her sobs.”",
        "In the comparative tranquillity which followed the September massacres,\nthe royal family resumed the regular habits they had adopted on entering\nthe Temple.  “The King usually rose at six in the morning,” says Clery.\n“He shaved himself, and I dressed his hair; he then went to his reading-\nroom, which, being very small, the municipal officer on duty remained in\nthe bedchamber with the door open, that he might always keep the King in\nsight.  His Majesty continued praying on his knees for some time, and\nthen read till nine.  During that interval, after putting his chamber to\nrights and preparing the breakfast, I went down to the Queen, who never\nopened her door till I arrived, in order to prevent the municipal officer\nfrom going into her apartment.  At nine o’clock the Queen, the children,\nand Madame Elisabeth went up to the King’s chamber to breakfast.  At ten\nthe King and his family went down to the Queen’s chamber, and there\npassed the day.  He employed himself in educating his son, made him\nrecite passages from Corneille and Racine, gave him lessons in geography,\nand exercised him in colouring the maps.  The Queen, on her part, was\nemployed in the education of her daughter, and these different lessons\nlasted till eleven o’clock.  The remaining time till noon was passed in\nneedlework, knitting, or making tapestry.  At one o’clock, when the\nweather was fine, the royal family were conducted to the garden by four\nmunicipal officers and the commander of a legion of the National Guard.\nAs there were a number of workmen in the Temple employed in pulling down\nhouses and building new walls, they only allowed a part of the chestnut-\ntree walk for the promenade, in which I was allowed to share, and where I\nalso played with the young Prince at ball, quoits, or races.  At two we\nreturned to the Tower, where I served the dinner, at which time Santerre\nregularly came to the Temple, attended by two aides-de-camp.  The King\nsometimes spoke to him,–the Queen never.",
        "“After the meal the royal family came down into the Queen’s room, and\ntheir Majesties generally played a game of piquet or tric-trac.  At four\no’clock the King took a little repose, the Princesses round him, each\nwith a book .  .  .  .  When the King woke the conversation was resumed,\nand I gave writing lessons to his son, taking the copies, according to\nhis instructions, from the works of, Montesquieu and other celebrated\nauthors.  After the lesson I took the young Prince into Madame\nElisabeth’s room, where we played at ball, and battledore and\nshuttlecock.  In the evening the family sat round a table, while the\nQueen read to them from books of history, or other works proper to\ninstruct and amuse the children.  Madame Elisabeth took the book in her\nturn, and in this manner they read till eight o’clock.  After that I\nserved the supper of the young Prince, in which the royal family shared,\nand the King amused the children with charades out of a collection of\nFrench papers which he found in the library.  After the Dauphin had\nsupped, I undressed him, and the Queen heard him say his prayers.  At\nnine the King went to supper, and afterwards went for a moment to the\nQueen’s chamber, shook hands with her and his sister for the night,\nkissed his children, and then retired to the turret-room, where he sat\nreading till midnight.  The Queen and the Princesses locked themselves\nin, and one of the municipal officers remained in the little room which\nparted their chamber, where he passed the night; the other followed his\nMajesty.  In this manner was the time passed as long as the King remained\nin the small tower.”",
        "But even these harmless pursuits were too often made the means of further\ninsulting and thwarting the unfortunate family.  Commissary Le Clerc\ninterrupted the Prince’s writing lessons, proposing to substitute\nRepublican works for those from which the King selected his copies.\nA smith, who was present when the Queen was reading the history of France\nto her children, denounced her to the Commune for choosing the period\nwhen the Connstable de Bourbon took arms against France, and said she\nwished to inspire her son with unpatriotic feelings; a municipal officer\nasserted that the multiplication table the Prince was studying would\nafford a means of “speaking in cipher,” so arithmetic had to be\nabandoned.  Much the same occurred even with the needlework,\nthe Queen and Princess finished some chairbacks, which they wished to\nsend to the Duchesse de Tarente; but the officials considered that the\npatterns were hieroglyphics, intended for carrying on a correspondence,\nand ordered that none of the Princesses work should leave the Temple.\nThe short daily walk in the garden was also embittered by the rude\nbehaviour of the military and municipal gaolers; sometimes, however, it\nafforded an opportunity for marks of sympathy to be shown.  People would\nstation themselves at the windows of houses overlooking the Temple\ngardens, and evince by gestures their loyal affection, and some of the\nsentinels showed, even by tears, that their duty was painful to them.",
        "On the 21st September the National Convention was constituted, Petion\nbeing made president and Collot d’Herbois moving the “abolition of\nroyalty” amidst transports of applause.  That afternoon a municipal\nofficer attended by gendarmes a cheval, and followed by a crowd of\npeople, arrived at the Temple, and, after a flourish of trumpets,\nproclaimed the establishment of the French Republic.  The man, says\nClery, “had the voice of a Stentor.”  The royal family could distinctly\nhear the announcement of the King’s deposition.  “Hebert, so well known\nunder the title of Pere Duchesne, and Destournelles were on guard.  They\nwere sitting near the door, and turned to the King with meaning smiles.\nHe had a book in his hand, and went on reading without changing\ncountenance.  The Queen showed the same firmness.  The proclamation\nfinished, the trumpets sounded afresh.  I went to the window; the people\ntook me for Louis XVI. and I was overwhelmed with insults.”",
        "After the new decree the prisoners were treated with increased harshness.\nPens, paper, ink, and pencils were taken from them.  The King and Madame\nElisabeth gave up all, but the Queen and her daughter each concealed a\npencil.  “In the beginning of October,” says Madame Royale, “after my\nfather had supped, he was told to stop, that he was not to return to his\nformer apartments, and that he was to be separated from his family.  At\nthis dreadful sentence the Queen lost her usual courage.  We parted from\nhim with abundance of tears, though we expected to see him again in the\nmorning.",
        "     [At nine o’clock, says Clery, the King asked to be taken to his\n     family, but the municipal officers replied that they had “no orders\n     for that.”  Shortly afterwards a boy brought the King some bread and\n     a decanter of lemonade for his breakfast.  The King gave half the\n     bread to Clery, saying, “It seems they have forgotten your\n     breakfast; take this, the rest is enough for me.”  Clery refused,\n     but the King insisted.  “I could not contain my tears,” he adds;\n     “the King perceived them, and his own fell also.\"]",
        "They brought in our breakfast separately from his, however.  My mother\nwould take nothing.  The officers, alarmed at her silent and concentrated\nsorrow, allowed us to see the King, but at meal-times only, and on\ncondition that we should not speak low, nor in any foreign language, but\nloud and in ’good French.’  We went down, therefore, with the greatest\njoy to dine with my father.  In the evening, when my brother was in bed,\nmy mother and my aunt alternately sat with him or went with me to sup\nwith my father.  In the morning, after breakfast, we remained in the\nKing’s apartments while Clery dressed our hair, as he was no longer\nallowed to come to my mother’s room, and this arrangement gave us the\npleasure of spending a few moments more with my father.”",
        "     [When the first deputation from the Council of the Commune visited\n     the Temple, and formally inquired whether the King had any complaint\n     to make, he replied, “No; while he was permitted to remain with his\n     family he was happy.\"]",
        "The royal prisoners had no comfort except their affection for each other.\nAt that time even common necessaries were denied them.  Their small stock\nof linen had been lent them; by persons of the Court during the time they\nspent at the Feuillans.  The Princesses mended their clothes every day,\nand after the King had gone to bed Madame Elisabeth mended his.  “With\nmuch trouble,” says Clrry, “I procured some fresh linen for them.  But\nthe workwomen having marked it with crowned letters, the Princesses were\nordered to pick them out.”  The room in the great tower to which the King\nhad been removed contained only one bed, and no other article of\nfurniture.  A chair was brought on which Clery spent the first night;\npainters were still at work on the room, and the smell of the paint, he\nsays, was almost unbearable.  This room was afterwards furnished by\ncollecting from various parts of the Temple a chest of drawers, a small\nbureau, a few odd chairs, a chimney-glass, and a bed hung with green\ndamask, which had been used by the captain of the guard to the Comte\nd’Artois.  A room for the Queen was being prepared over that of the King,\nand she implored the workmen to finish it quickly, but it was not ready\nfor her occupation for some time, and when she was allowed to remove to\nit the Dauphin was taken from her and placed with his father.  When their\nMajesties met again in the great Tower, says Clery, there was little\nchange in the hours fixed for meals, reading, walking and the education\nof their children.  They were not allowed to have mass said in the\nTemple, and therefore commissioned Clery to get them the breviary in use\nin the diocese of Paris.  Among the books read by the King while in the\nTower were Hume’s “History of England” (in the original), Tasso, and the\n“De Imitatione Christi.”  The jealous suspicions of the municipal\nofficers led to the most absurd investigations; a draught-board was taken\nto pieces lest the squares should hide treasonable papers; macaroons were\nbroken in half to see that they did not contain letters; peaches were cut\nopen and the stones cracked; and Clery was compelled to drink the essence\nof soap prepared for shaving the King, under the pretence that it might\ncontain poison.",
        "In November the King and all the family had feverish colds, and Clery had\nan attack of rheumatic fever.  On the first day of his illness he got up\nand tried to dress his master, but the King, seeing how ill he was,\nordered him to lie down, and himself dressed the Dauphin.  The little\nPrince waited on Clery all day, and in the evening the King contrived to\napproach his bed, and said, in a low voice, “I should like to take care\nof you myself, but you know how we are watched.  Take courage; tomorrow\nyou shall see my doctor.”  Madame Elisabeth brought the valet cooling\ndraughts, of which she deprived herself; and after Clery was able to get\nup, the young Prince one night with great difficulty kept awake till\neleven o’clock in order to give him a box of lozenges when he went to\nmake the King’s bed.",
        "On 7th December a deputation from the Commune brought an order that the\nroyal family should be deprived of “knives, razors, scissors, penknives,\nand all other cutting instruments.”  The King gave up a knife, and took\nfrom a morocco case a pair of scissors and a penknife; and the officials\nthen searched the room, taking away the little toilet implements of gold\nand silver, and afterwards removing the Princesses’ working materials.\nReturning to the King’s room, they insisted upon seeing what remained in\nhis pocket-case.  “Are these toys which I have in my hand also cutting\ninstruments?”  asked the King, showing them a cork-screw, a turn-screw,\nand a steel for lighting.  These also were taken from him.  Shortly\nafterwards Madame Elisabeth was mending the King’s coat, and, having no\nscissors, was compelled to break the thread with her teeth.",
        "“What a contrast!” he exclaimed, looking at her tenderly.  “You wanted\nnothing in your pretty house at Montreuil.”",
        "“Ah, brother,” she answered, “how can I have any regret when I partake\nyour misfortunes?”",
        "The Queen had frequently to take on herself some of the humble duties of\na servant.  This was especially painful to Louis XVI. when the\nanniversary of some State festival brought the contrast between past and\npresent with unusual keenness before him.",
        "“Ah, Madame,” he once exclaimed, “what an employment for a Queen of\nFrance!  Could they see that at Vienna!  Who would have foreseen that,\nin uniting your lot to mine, you would have descended so low?”",
        "“And do you esteem as nothing,” she replied, “the glory of being the wife\nof one of the best and most persecuted of men?  Are not such misfortunes\nthe noblest honours?\"–[Alison’s “History of Europe,” vol. ii., p. 299.]",
        "Meanwhile the Assembly had decided that the King should be brought to\ntrial.  Nearly all parties, except the Girondists, no matter how bitterly\nopposed to each other, could agree in making him the scapegoat; and the\nfirst rumour of the approaching ordeal was conveyed to the Temple by\nClery’s wife, who, with a friend, had permission occasionally to visit\nhim.  “I did not know how to announce this terrible news to the King,” he\nsays; “but time was pressing, and be had forbidden my concealing anything\nfrom him.  In the evening, while undressing him, I gave him an account of\nall I had learnt, and added that there were only four days to concert\nsome plan of corresponding with the Queen.  The arrival of the municipal\nofficer would not allow me to say more.  Next morning, when the King\nrose, I could not get a moment for speaking with him.  He went up with\nhis son to breakfast with the Princesses, and I followed.  After\nbreakfast he talked long with the Queen, who, by a look full of trouble,\nmade me understand that they were discussing what I had told the King.\nDuring the day I found an opportunity of describing to Madame Elisabeth\nhow much it had cost me to augment the King’s distresses by informing him\nof his approaching trial.  She reassured me, saying that the King felt\nthis as a mark of attachment on my part, and added, ’That which most\ntroubles him is the fear of being separated from us.’  In the evening the\nKing told me how satisfied he was at having had warning that he was to\nappear before the Convention.  ’Continue,’ he said, ’to endeavour to find\nout something as to what they want to do with me.  Never fear distressing\nme.  I have agreed with my family not to seem pre-informed, in order not\nto compromise you.’”",
        "On the 11th December, at five o’clock in the morning, the prisoners heard\nthe generale beaten throughout Paris, and cavalry and cannon entered the\nTemple gardens.  At nine the King and the Dauphin went as usual to\nbreakfast with the Queen.  They were allowed to remain together for an\nhour, but constantly under the eyes of their republican guardians.  At\nlast they were obliged to part, doubtful whether they would ever see each\nother again.  The little Prince, who remained with his father, and was\nignorant of the new cause for anxiety, begged hard that the King would\nplay at ninepins with him as usual.  Twice the Dauphin could not get\nbeyond a certain number.  “Each time that I get up to sixteen,” he said,\nwith some vexation, “I lose the game.”  The King did not reply, but Clery\nfancied the words made a painful impression on him.",
        "At eleven, while the King was giving the Dauphin a reading lesson, two\nmunicipal officers entered and said they had come “to take young Louis to\nhis mother.”  The King inquired why, but was only told that such were the\norders of the Council.  At one o’clock the Mayor of Paris, Chambon,\naccompanied by Chaumette, Procureur de la Commune, Santerre, commandant\nof the National Guard, and others, arrived at the Temple and read a\ndecree to the King, which ordered that “Louis Capet” should be brought\nbefore the Convention.  “Capet is not my name,” he replied, “but that of\none of my ancestors.  I could have wished,” he added, “that you had left\nmy son with me during the last two hours.  But this treatment is\nconsistent with all I have experienced here.  I follow you, not because I\nrecognise the authority of the Convention, but because I can be compelled\nto obey it.”  He then followed the Mayor to a carriage which waited, with\na numerous escort, at the gate of the Temple.  The family left behind\nwere overwhelmed with grief and apprehension.  “It is impossible to\ndescribe the anxiety we suffered,” says Madame Royale.  “My mother used\nevery endeavour with the officer who guarded her to discover what was\npassing; it was the first time she had condescended to question any of\nthese men.  He would tell her nothing.”",
        "       Trial of the King.–Parting of the Royal Family.–Execution.",
        "The crowd was immense as, on the morning of the 11th December, 1792,\nLouis XVI. was driven slowly from the Temple to the Convention, escorted\nby cavalry, infantry, and artillery.  Paris looked like an armed camp:\nall the posts were doubled; the muster-roll of the National Guard was\ncalled over every hour; a picket of two hundred men watched in the court\nof each of the right sections; a reserve with cannon was stationed at the\nTuileries, and strong detachments patroled the streets and cleared the\nroad of all loiterers.  The trees that lined the boulevards, the doors\nand windows of the houses, were alive with gazers, and all eyes were\nfixed on the King.  He was much changed since his people last beheld him.\nThe beard he had been compelled to grow after his razors were taken from\nhim covered cheeks, lips, and chin with light-coloured hair, which\nconcealed the melancholy expression of his mouth; he had become thin, and\nhis garments hung loosely on him; but his manner was perfectly collected\nand calm, and he recognised and named to the Mayor the various quarters\nthrough which he passed.  On arriving at the Feuillans he was taken to a\nroom to await the orders of the Assembly.",
        "It was about half-past two when the King appeared at the bar.  The Mayor\nand Generaux Santerre and Wittengoff were at his side.  Profound silence\npervaded the Assembly.  All were touched by the King’s dignity and the\ncomposure of his looks under so great a reverse of fortune.  By nature he\nhad been formed rather to endure calamity with patience than to contend\nagainst it with energy.  The approach of death could not disturb his\nserenity.",
        "“Louis, you may be seated,” said Barere.  “Answer the questions that\nshall be put to you.”  The King seated himself and listened to the\nreading of the ’acte enonciatif’, article by article.  All the faults\nof the Court were there enumerated and imputed to Louis XVI. personally.\nHe was charged with the interruption of the sittings of the 20th of June,\n1789, with the Bed of Justice held on the 23d of the same month, the\naristocratic conspiracy thwarted by the insurrection of the 14th of July,\nthe entertainment of the Life Guards, the insults offered to the national\ncockade, the refusal to sanction the Declaration of Rights, as well as\nseveral constitutional articles; lastly, all the facts which indicated a\nnew conspiracy in October, and which were followed by the scenes of the\n5th and 6th; the speeches of reconciliation which had succeeded all these\nscenes, and which promised a change that was not sincere; the false oath\ntaken at the Federation of the 14th of July; the secret practices of\nTalon and Mirabeau to effect a counter-revolution; the money spent in\nbribing a great number of deputies; the assemblage of the “knights of\nthe dagger” on the 28th of February, 1791; the flight to Varennes; the\nfusilade of the Champ de Mars; the silence observed respecting the Treaty\nof Pilnitz; the delay in the promulgation of the decree which\nincorporated Avignon with France; the commotions at Nimes, Montauban,\nMende, and Jales; the continuance of their pay to the emigrant Life\nGuards and to the disbanded Constitutional Guard; the insufficiency of\nthe armies assembled on the frontiers; the refusal to sanction the decree\nfor the camp of twenty thousand men; the disarming of the fortresses; the\norganisation of secret societies in the interior of Paris; the review of\nthe Swiss and the garrison of the palace on the 10th August; the\nsummoning the Mayor to the Tuileries; and lastly, the effusion of blood\nwhich had resulted from these military dispositions.  After each article\nthe President paused, and said, “What have you to answer?”  The King, in\na firm voice, denied some of the facts, imputed others to his ministers,\nand always appealed to the constitution, from which he declared he had\nnever deviated.  His answers were very temperate, but on the charge, “You\nspilt the blood of the people on the 10th of August,” he exclaimed, with\nemphasis, “No, monsieur, no; it was not I.”",
        "All the papers on which the act of accusation was founded were then shown\nto the King, and he disavowed some of them and disputed the existence of\nthe iron chest; this produced a bad impression, and was worse than\nuseless, as the fact had been proved.",
        "     [A secret closet which the King had directed to be constructed in a\n     wall in the Tuileries.  The door was of iron, whence it was\n     afterwards known by the name of the iron chest.  See Thiers, and\n     Scott.]",
        "Throughout the examination the King showed great presence of mind.\nHe was careful in his answers never to implicate any members of the\nconstituent, and legislative Assemblies; many who then sat as his judges\ntrembled lest he should betray them.  The Jacobins beheld with dismay the\nprofound impression made on the Convention by the firm but mild demeanour\nof the sovereign.  The most violent of the party proposed that he should\nbe hanged that very night; a laugh as of demons followed the proposal\nfrom the benches of the Mountain, but the majority, composed of the\nGirondists and the neutrals, decided that he should be formally tried.",
        "After the examination  Santerre took the King by the arm and led him back\nto the waiting-room of the Convention, accompanied by Chambon and\nChaumette.  Mental agitation and the length of the proceedings had\nexhausted him, and he staggered from weakness.  Chaumette inquired if he\nwished for refreshment, but the King refused it.  A moment after, seeing\na grenadier of the escort offer the Procureur de la Commune half a small\nloaf, Louis XVI. approached and asked him, in a whisper, for a piece.",
        "“Ask aloud for what you want,” said Chaumette, retreating as though he\nfeared being suspected of pity.",
        "“I asked for a piece of your bread,” replied the King.",
        "“Divide it with me,” said Chaumette.  “It is a Spartan breakfast.  If I\nhad a root I would give you half.\"–[Lamartine’s “History of the\nGirondists,” edit.  1870, vol. ii., p. 313.]",
        "Soon after six in the evening the King returned to the Temple.  “He\nseemed tired,” says Clery, simply, “and his first wish was to be led to\nhis family.  The officers refused, on the plea that they had no orders.\nHe insisted that at least they should be informed of his return, and this\nwas promised him.  The King ordered me to ask for his supper at half-past\neight.  The intervening hours he employed in his usual reading,\nsurrounded by four municipals.  When I announced that supper was served,\nthe King asked the commissaries if his family could not come down.  They\nmade no reply.  ’But at least,’ the King said, ’my son will pass the\nnight in my room, his bed being here?’  The same silence.  After supper\nthe King again urged his wish to see his family.  They answered that they\nmust await the decision of the Convention.  While I was undressing him\nthe King said, ’I was far from expecting all the questions they put to\nme.’  He lay down with perfect calmness.  The order for my removal during\nthe night was not executed.”  On the King’s return to the Temple being\nknown, “my mother asked to see him instantly,” writes Madame Royale.\n“She made the same request even to Chambon, but received no answer.  My\nbrother passed the night with her; and as he had no bed, she gave him\nhers, and sat up all the night in such deep affliction that we were\nafraid to leave her; but she compelled my aunt and me to go to bed.  Next\nday she again asked to see my father, and to read the newspapers, that\nshe might learn the course of the trial.  She entreated that if she was\nto be denied this indulgence, his children, at least, might see him.  Her\nrequests were referred to the Commune.  The newspapers were refused; but\nmy brother and I were to be allowed to see my father on condition of\nbeing entirely separated from my mother.  My father replied that, great\nas his happiness was in seeing his children, the important business which\nthen occupied him would not allow of his attending altogether to his son,\nand that his daughter could not leave her mother.”",
        "     [During their last interview Madame Elisabeth had given Clery one of\n     her handkerchiefs, saying, “You shall keep it so long as my brother\n     continues well; if he becomes ill, send it to me among my nephew’s\n     things.\"]",
        "The Assembly having, after a violent debate, resolved that Louis XVI.\nshould have the aid of counsel, a deputation was sent to the Temple to\nask whom he would choose.  The King named Messieurs Target and Tronchet.\nThe former refused his services on the ground that he had discontinued\npractice since 1785; the latter complied at once with the King’s request;\nand while the Assembly was considering whom to, nominate in Target’s\nplace, the President received a letter from the venerable Malesherbes,",
        "     [Christian Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, an eminent French\n     statesman, son of the Chancellor of France, was born at Paris in\n     1721.  In 1750 he succeeded his father as President of the Court of\n     Aids, and was also made superintendent of the press.  On the\n     banishment of the Parliaments and the suppression of the Court of\n     Aids, Malesherbes was exiled to his country-seat.  In 1775 he was\n     appointed Minister of State.  On the decree of the Convention for\n     the King’s trial, he emerged from his retreat to become the\n     voluntary advocate of his sovereign.  Malesherbes was guillotined in\n     1794, and almost his whole family were extirpated by their merciless\n     persecutors.]",
        "then seventy years old, and “the most respected magistrate in France,” in\nthe course of which he said: “I have been twice called to be counsel for\nhim who was my master, in times when that duty was coveted by every one.\nI owe him the same service now that it is a duty which many people deem\ndangerous.  If I knew any possible means of acquainting him with my\ndesires, I should not take the liberty of addressing myself to you.\"\nOther citizens made similar proposals, but the King, being made\nacquainted with them by a deputation from the Commune, while expressing\nhis gratitude for all the offers, accepted only that of Malesherbes.",
        "     [The Citoyenne Olympia Degonges, calling herself a free and loyal\n     Republican without spot or blame, and declaring that the cold and\n     selfish cruelty of Target had inflamed her heroism and roused her\n     sensibility, asked permission to assist M, de Malesherbes in\n     defending the King.  The Assembly passed to the order of the day on\n     this request.–BERTRAND DE MOLLEVILLE, “Annals,” edit.  1802, vol,\n     viii., p. 254.]",
        "On 14th December M. Tronchet was allowed to confer with the King, and\nlater in the same day M. de Malesherbes was admitted to the Tower.  “The\nKing ran up to this worthy old man, whom he clasped in his arms,” said\nClery, “and the former minister melted into tears at the sight of his\nmaster.”",
        "     [According to M. de Hue, “The first time M. de Malesherbes entered\n     the Temple, the King clasped him in his arms and said, ’Ah, is it\n     you, my friend?  You fear not to endanger your own life to save\n     mine; but all will be useless.  They will bring me to the scaffold.\n     No matter; I shall gain my cause if I leave an unspotted memory\n     behind me.’\"]",
        "Another deputation brought the King the Act of Accusation and the\ndocuments relating to it, numbering more than a hundred, and taking from\nfour o’clock till midnight to read.  During this long process the King\nhad refreshments served to the deputies, taking nothing himself till they\nhad left, but considerately reproving Clery for not having supped.  From\nthe 14th to the 26th December the King saw his counsel and their\ncolleague M. de Size every day.  At this time a means of communication\nbetween the royal family and the King was devised: a man named Turgi, who\nhad been in the royal kitchen, and who contrived to obtain employment in\nthe Temple, when conveying the meals of the royal family to their\napartments, or articles he had purchased for them, managed to give Madame\nElisabeth news of the King.  Next day, the Princess, when Turgi was\nremoving the dinner, slipped into his hand a bit of paper on which she\nhad pricked with a pin a request for a word from her brother’s own hand.\nTurgi gave this paper to Clery, who conveyed it to the King the same\nevening; and he, being allowed writing materials while preparing his\ndefence, wrote Madame Elisabeth a short note.  An answer was conveyed in\na ball of cotton, which Turgi threw under Clery’s bed while passing the\ndoor of his room.  Letters were also passed between the Princess’s room\nand that of Clery, who lodged beneath her, by means of a string let down\nand drawn up at night.  This communication with his family was a great\ncomfort to the King, who, nevertheless, constantly cautioned his faithful\nservant.  “Take care,” he would say kindly, “you expose yourself too\nmuch.”",
        "     [The King’s natural benevolence was constantly shown while in the\n     Temple.  His own dreadful position never prevented him from sympathy\n     with the smaller troubles of others.  A servant in the Temple named\n     Marchand, the father of a family, was robbed of two hundred francs,\n     –his wages for two months.  The King observed his distress, asked\n     its cause, and gave Clery the amount to be handed to Marchand, with\n     a caution not to speak of it to any one, and, above all, not to\n     thank the King, lest it should injure him with his employers.]",
        "During his separation from his family the King refused to go into the\ngarden.  When it was proposed to him he said, “I cannot make up my mind\nto go out alone; the walk was agreeable to me only when I shared it with\nmy family.”  But he did not allow himself to dwell on painful\nreflections.  He talked freely to the municipals on guard, and surprised\nthem by his varied and practical knowledge of their trades, and his\ninterest in their domestic affairs.  On the 19th December the King’s\nbreakfast was served as usual; but, being a fast-day, he refused to take\nanything.  At dinner-time the King said to Clery, “Fourteen years ago you\nwere up earlier than you were to-day; it is the day my daughter was born-\n-today, her birthday,” he repeated, with tears, “and to be prevented from\nseeing her!”  Madame Royale had wished for a calendar; the King ordered\nClery to buy her the “Almanac of the Republic,” which had replaced the\n“Court Almanac,” and ran through it, marking with a pencil many names.",
        "“On Christmas Day,” Says Clery, “the King wrote his will.”",
        "     [Madame Royale says: “On the 26th December, St. Stephen’s Day, my\n     father made his will, because he expected to be assassinated that\n     day on his way to the bar of the Convention.  He went thither,\n     nevertheless, with his usual calmness.\"–\"Royal Memoirs,” p. 196.]",
        "On the 26th December, 1792, the King appeared a second time before the\nConvention.  M. de Seze, labouring night and day, had completed his\ndefence.  The King insisted on excluding from it all that was too\nrhetorical, and confining it to the mere discussion of essential points.",
        "     [When the pathetic peroration of M, de Seze was read to the King,\n     the evening before it was delivered to the Assembly, “I have to\n     request of you,” he said, “to make a painful sacrifice; strike out\n     of your pleading the peroration.  It is enough for me to appear\n     before such judges, and show my entire innocence; I will not move\n     their feelings.–\"LACRETELLE.]",
        "At half-past nine in the morning the whole armed force was in motion to\nconduct him from the Temple to the Feuillans, with the same precautions\nand in the same order as had been observed on the former occasion.\nRiding in the carriage of the Mayor, he conversed, on the way, with the\nsame composure as usual, and talked of Seneca, of Livy, of the hospitals.\nArrived at the Feuillans, he showed great anxiety for his defenders; he\nseated himself beside them in the Assembly, surveyed with great composure\nthe benches where his accusers and his judges sat, seemed to examine\ntheir faces with the view of discovering the impression produced by the\npleading of M. de Seze, and more than once conversed smilingly with\nTronchet and Malesherbes.  The Assembly received his defence in sullen\nsilence, but without any tokens of disapprobation.",
        "Being afterwards conducted to an adjoining room with his counsel, the\nKing showed great anxiety about M. de Seze, who seemed fatigued by the\nlong defence.  While riding back to the Temple he conversed with his\ncompanions with the same serenity as he had shown on leaving it.",
        "No sooner had the King left the hall of the Convention than a violent\ntumult arose there.  Some were for opening the discussion.  Others,\ncomplaining of the delays which postponed the decision of this process,\ndemanded the vote immediately, remarking that in every court, after the\naccused had been heard, the judges proceed to give their opinion.\nLanjuinais had from the commencement of the proceedings felt an\nindignation which his impetuous disposition no longer suffered him to\nrepress.  He darted to the tribune, and, amidst the cries excited by his\npresence, demanded the annulling of the proceedings altogether.\nHe exclaimed that the days of ferocious men were gone by, that the\nAssembly ought not to be so dishonoured as to be made to sit in judgment\non Louis XVI., that no authority in France had that right, and the\nAssembly in particular had no claim to it; that if it resolved to act as\na political body, it could do no more than take measures of safety\nagainst the ci-devant King; but that if it was acting as a court of\njustice it was overstepping all principles, for it was subjecting the\nvanquished to be tried by the conquerors, since most of the present\nmembers had declared themselves the conspirators of the 10th of August.\nAt the word “conspirators” a tremendous uproar arose on all aides.  Cries\nof “Order!\"–\"To the Abbaye!\"–\"Down with the Tribune!” were heard.\nLanjuinais strove in vain to justify the word “conspirators,” saying that\nhe meant it to be taken in a favourable sense, and that the 10th of\nAugust was a glorious conspiracy.  He concluded by declaring that he\nwould rather die a thousand deaths than condemn, contrary to all laws,\neven the most execrable of tyrants.",
        "A great number of speakers followed, and the confusion continually\nincreased.  The members, determined not to hear any more, mingled\ntogether, formed groups, abused and threatened one another.  After a\ntempest of an hour’s duration, tranquillity was at last restored; and the\nAssembly, adopting the opinion of those who demanded the discussion on\nthe trial of Louis XVI., declared that it was opened, and that it should\nbe continued, to the exclusion of all other business, till sentence\nshould be passed.",
        "The discussion was accordingly resumed on the 27th, and there was a\nconstant succession of speakers from the 28th to the 31st.  Vergniaud at\nlength ascended the tribune for the first time, and an extraordinary\neagerness was manifested to hear the Girondists express their sentiments\nby the lips of their greatest orator.",
        "The speech of Vergniaud produced a deep impression on all his hearers.\nRobespierre was thunderstruck by his earnest and, persuasive eloquence.\nVergniaud, however, had but shaken, not convinced, the Assembly, which\nwavered between the two parties.  Several members were successively\nheard, for and against the appeal to the people.  Brissot, Gensonne,\nPetion, supported it in their turn.  One speaker at length had a decisive\ninfluence on the question.  Barere, by his suppleness, and his cold and\nevasive eloquence, was the model and oracle of the centre.  He spoke at\ngreat length on the trial, reviewed it in all its bearings–of facts, of\nlaws, and of policy–and furnished all those weak minds, who only wanted\nspecious reasons for yielding, with motives for the condemnation of the\nKing.  From that moment the unfortunate King was condemned.  The\ndiscussion lasted till the 7th, and nobody would listen any longer to the\ncontinual repetition of the same facts and arguments.  It was therefore\ndeclared to be closed without opposition, but the proposal of a fresh\nadjournment excited a commotion among the most violent, and ended in a\ndecree which fixed the 14th of January for putting the questions to the\nvote.",
        "Meantime the King did not allow the torturing suspense to disturb his\noutward composure, or lessen his kindness to those around him.  On the\nmorning after his second appearance at the bar of the Convention, the\ncommissary Vincent, who had undertaken secretly to convey to the Queen\na copy of the King’s printed defence, asked for something which had\nbelonged to him, to treasure as a relic; the King took off his neck\nhandkerchief and gave it him; his gloves he bestowed on another\nmunicipal, who had made the same request.  “On January 1st,” says Clery,\n“I approached the King’s bed and asked permission to offer him my warmest\nprayers for the end of his misfortunes.  ’I accept your good wishes with\naffection,’ he replied, extending his hand to me.  As soon as he had\nrisen, he requested a municipal to go and inquire for his family, and\npresent them his good wishes for the new year.  The officers were moved\nby the tone in which these words, so heartrending considering the\nposition of the King, were pronounced .  .  .  .  The correspondence\nbetween their Majesties went on constantly.  The King being informed that\nMadame Royale was ill, was very uneasy for some days.  The Queen, after\nbegging earnestly, obtained permission for M. Brunnier, the medical\nattendant of the royal children, to come to the Temple.  This seemed to\nquiet him.”",
        "The nearer the moment which was to decide the King’s fate approached, the\ngreater became the agitation in, Paris.  “A report was circulated that\nthe atrocities of September were to be repeated there, and the prisoners\nand their relatives beset the deputies with supplications that they would\nsnatch them from destruction.  The Jacobins, on their part, alleged that\nconspiracies were hatching in all quarters to save Louis XVI.  from\npunishment, and to restore royalty.  Their anger, excited by delays and\nobstacles, assumed a more threatening aspect; and the two parties thus\nalarmed one another by supposing that each harboured sinister designs.”",
        "On the 14th of January the Convention called for the order of the day,\nbeing the final judgment of Louis XVI.",
        "“The sitting of the Convention which concluded the trial,” says Hazlitt,\n“lasted seventy-two hours.  It might naturally be supposed that silence,\nrestraint, a sort of religious awe, would have pervaded the scene.  On\nthe contrary, everything bore the marks of gaiety, dissipation, and the\nmost grotesque confusion.  The farther end of the hall was converted into\nboxes, where ladies, in a studied deshabille, swallowed ices, oranges,\nliqueurs, and received the salutations of the members who went and came,\nas on ordinary occasions.  Here the doorkeepers on the Mountain side\nopened and shut the boxes reserved for the mistresses of the Duc\nd’Orleans; and there, though every sound of approbation or disapprobation\nwas strictly forbidden, you heard the long and indignant ’Ha, ha’s!’ of\nthe mother-duchess, the patroness of the bands of female Jacobins,\nwhenever her ears were not loudly greeted with the welcome sounds of\ndeath.  The upper gallery, reserved for the people, was during the whole\ntrial constantly full of strangers of every description, drinking wine as\nin a tavern.",
        "“Bets were made as to the issue of the trial in all the neighbouring\ncoffee-houses.  Ennui, impatience, disgust sat on almost every\ncountenance.  The figures passing and repassing, rendered more ghastly by\nthe pallid lights, and who in a slow, sepulchral voice pronounced only\nthe word–Death; others calculating if they should have time to go to\ndinner before they gave their verdict; women pricking cards with pins in\norder to count the votes; some of the deputies fallen asleep, and only\nwaking up to give their sentence,–all this had the appearance rather of\na hideous dream than of a reality.”",
        "The Duc d’Orleans, when called on to give his vote for the death of his\nKing and relation, walked with a faltering step, and a face paler than\ndeath itself, to the appointed place, and there read these words:\n“Exclusively governed by my duty, and convinced that all those who have\nresisted the sovereignty of the people deserve death, my vote is for\ndeath!”  Important as the accession of the first Prince of the blood was\nto the Terrorist faction, his conduct in this instance was too obviously\nselfish and atrocious not to excite a general feeling of indignation; the\nagitation of the Assembly became extreme; it seemed as if by this single\nvote the fate of the monarch was irrevocably sealed.",
        "The President having examined the register, the result of the scrutiny\nwas proclaimed as follows",
        "     Against an appeal to the people........... 480\n     For an appeal to the people............... 283",
        "     Majority for final judgment............... 197",
        "The President having announced that he was about to declare the result of\nthe scrutiny, a profound silence ensued, and he then gave in the\nfollowing declaration: that, out of 719 votes, 366 were for DEATH, 319\nwere for imprisonment during the war, two for perpetual imprisonment,\neight for a suspension of the execution of the sentence of death until\nafter the expulsion of the family of the Bourbons, twenty-three were for\nnot putting him to death until the French territory was invaded by any\nforeign power, and one was for a sentence of death, but with power of\ncommutation of the punishment.",
        "After this enumeration the President took off his hat, and, lowering his\nvoice, said: “In consequence of this expression of opinion I declare that\nthe punishment pronounced by the National Convention against Louis Capet\nis DEATH!”",
        "Previous to the passing of the sentence the President announced on the\npart of the Foreign Minister the receipt of a letter from the Spanish\nMinister relative to that sentence.  The Convention, however, refused to\nhear it.  [It will be remembered that a similar remonstrance was\nforwarded by the English Government.]",
        "M. de Malesherbes, according to his promise to the King, went to the\nTemple at nine o’clock on the morning of the 17th?.",
        "     [Louis was fully prepared for his fate.  During the calling of the\n     votes he asked M. de Malesherbes, “Have you not met near the Temple\n     the White Lady?\"–” What do you mean?” replied he.  “Do you not\n     know,” resumed the King with a smile, “that when a prince of our\n     house is about to die, a female dressed in white is seen wandering\n     about the palace?  My friends,” added he to his defenders, “I am\n     about to depart before you for the land of the just, but there, at\n     least, we shall be reunited.”  In fact, his Majesty’s only\n     apprehension seemed to be for his family.–ALISON.]",
        "“All is lost,” he said to Clery.  “The King is condemned.”  The King, who\nsaw him arrive, rose to receive him.",
        "     [When M. de Malesherbes went to the Temple to announce the result of\n     the vote, he found Louis with his forehead resting on his hands, and\n     absorbed in a deep reverie.  Without inquiring concerning his fate,\n     he said: “For two hours I have been considering whether, during my\n     whole reign, I have voluntarily given any cause of complaint to my\n     subjects; and with perfect sincerity I declare that I deserve no\n     reproach at their hands, and that I have never formed a wish but for\n     their happiness.”  LACRETELLE.]",
        "M. de Malesherbes, choked by sobs, threw himself at his feet.  The King\nraised him up and affectionately embraced him.  When he could control his\nvoice, De Malesherbes informed the King of the decree sentencing him to\ndeath; he made no movement of surprise or emotion, but seemed only\naffected by the distress of his advocate, whom he tried to comfort.",
        "On the 20th of January, at two in the afternoon, Louis XVI. was awaiting\nhis advocates, when he heard the approach of a numerous party.  He\nstopped with dignity at the door of his apartment, apparently unmoved:\nGarat then told him sorrowfully that he was commissioned to communicate\nto him the decrees of the Convention.  Grouvelle, secretary of the\nExecutive Council, read them to him.  The first declared Louis XVI.\nguilty of treason against the general safety of the State; the second\ncondemned him to death; the third rejected any appeal to the people; and\nthe fourth and last ordered his execution in twenty-four hours.  Louis,\nlooking calmly round, took the paper from Grouvelle, and read Garat a\nletter, in which he demanded from the Convention three days to prepare\nfor death, a confessor to assist him in his last moments, liberty to see\nhis family, and permission for them to leave France.  Garat took the\nletter, promising to submit it immediately to the Convention.",
        "Louis XVI. then went back into his room with great composure, ordered his\ndinner, and ate as usual.  There were no knives on the table, and his\nattendants refused to let him have any.  “Do they think me so cowardly,\"\nhe exclaimed, “as to lay violent hands on myself?  I am innocent, and I\nam not afraid to die.”",
        "The Convention refused the delay, but granted some other demands which he\nhad made.  Garat sent for Edgeworth de Firmont, the ecclesiastic whom\nLouis XVI. had chosen, and took him in his own carriage to the Temple.\nM. Edgeworth, on being ushered into the presence of the King, would have\nthrown himself at his feet, but Louis instantly raised him, and both shed\ntears of emotion.  He then, with eager curiosity, asked various questions\nconcerning the clergy of France, several bishops, and particularly the\nArchbishop of Paris, requesting him to assure the latter that he died\nfaithfully attached to his communion.–The clock having struck eight, he\nrose, begged M. Edgeworth to wait, and retired with emotion, saying that\nhe was going to see his family.  The municipal officers, unwilling to\nlose sight of the King, even while with his family, had decided that he\nshould see them in the dining-room, which had a glass door, through which\nthey could watch all his motions without hearing what he said.  At half-\npast eight the door opened.  The Queen, holding the Dauphin by the hand,\nMadame Elisabeth, and Madame Royale rushed sobbing into the arms of Louis\nXVI.  The door was closed, and the municipal officers, Clery, and M.\nEdgeworth placed themselves behind it.  During the first moments, it was\nbut a scene of confusion and despair.  Cries and lamentations prevented\nthose who were on the watch from distinguishing anything.  At length the\nconversation became more calm, and the Princesses, still holding the King\nclasped in their arms, spoke with him in a low tone.  “He related his\ntrial to my mother,” says Madame Royale, “apologising for the wretches\nwho had condemned him.  He told her that he would not consent to any\nattempt to save him, which might excite disturbance in the country.\nHe then gave my brother some religious advice, and desired him, above\nall, to forgive those who caused his death; and he gave us his blessing.\nMy mother was very desirous that the whole family should pass the night\nwith my father, but he opposed this, observing to her that he much needed\nsome hours of repose and quiet.”  After a long conversation, interrupted\nby silence and grief, the King put an end to the painful meeting,\nagreeing to see his family again at eight the next morning.  “Do you\npromise that you will?”  earnestly inquired the Princesses.  “Yes, yes,\"\nsorrowfully replied the King.",
        "     [\"But when we were gone,” says his daughter, “he requested that we\n     might not be permitted to return, as our presence afflicted him too\n     much.\"]",
        "At this moment the Queen held him by one arm, Madame Elisabeth by the\nother, while Madame Royale clasped him round the waist, and the Dauphin\nstood before him, with one hand in that of his mother.  At the moment of\nretiring Madame Royale fainted; she was carried away, and the King\nreturned to M. Edgeworth deeply depressed by this painful interview.\nThe King retired to rest about midnight; M. Edgeworth threw himself upon\na bed, and Clery took his place near the pillow of his master.",
        "Next morning, the 21st of January, at five, the King awoke, called Clery,\nand dressed with great calmness.  He congratulated himself on having\nrecovered his strength by sleep.  Clery kindled a fire,, and moved a\nchest of drawers, out of which he formed an altar.  M. Edgeworth put on\nhis pontifical robes, and began to celebrate mass.  Clery waited on him,\nand the King listened, kneeling with the greatest devotion.  He then\nreceived the communion from the hands of M. Edgeworth, and after mass\nrose with new vigour, and awaited with composure the moment for going to\nthe scaffold.

The Convention, the\nCommune, the Executive Council, and the Jacobins were sitting.  At eight.\nin the morning, Santerre, with a deputation from the Commune, the\ndepartment, and the criminal tribunal, repaired to the Temple.

Tell the Queen,\n     my dear sister, and my children, that, although I promised to see\n     them again this morning, I have resolved to spare them the pang of\n     so cruel a separation.  Tell them how much it costs me to go away\n     without receiving their embraces once more!”  He wiped away some\n     tears, and then added, in the most mournful accents, “I charge you\n     to bear them my last farewell.\"–CLERY.]",
        "He then clasped his hand and thanked him for his services.  After this he\naddressed himself to one of the municipal officers, requesting him to\ntransmit his last will to the Commune.  This officer, who had formerly\nbeen a priest, and was named Jacques Roux, brutally replied that his\nbusiness was to conduct him to execution, and not to perform his\ncommissions.  Another person took charge of it, and Louis, turning\ntowards the party, gave with firmness the signal for starting.",

Edgeworth’s breviary the prayers for\npersons at the point of death; the two gendarmes were astonished at his\npiety and tranquil resignation.  The vehicle advanced slowly, and amidst\nuniversal silence.  At the Place de la Revolution an extensive space had\nbeen left vacant about the scaffold.  Around this space were planted\ncannon; the most violent of the Federalists were stationed about the\nscaffold; and the vile rabble, always ready to insult genius, virtue, and\nmisfortune, when a signal is given it to do so, crowded behind the ranks\nof the Federalists, and alone manifested some outward tokens of\nsatisfaction.",
        "At ten minutes past ten the carriage stopped.  Louis XVI., rising\nbriskly, stepped out into the Place.  Three executioners came up; he\nrefused their assistance, and took off his clothes himself.  But,\nperceiving that they were going to bind his hands, he made a movement of\nindignation, and seemed ready to resist.  M. Edgeworth gave him a last\nlook, and said, “Suffer this outrage, as a last resemblance to that God\nwho is about to be your reward.”  At these words the King suffered\nhimself to be bound and conducted to the scaffold.  All at once Louis\nhurriedly advanced to address the people.  “Frenchmen,” said he, in a\nfirm voice, “I die innocent of the crimes which are imputed to me; I\nforgive the authors of my death, and I pray that my blood may not fall\nupon France.”  He would have continued, but the drums were instantly\nordered to beat: their rolling drowned his voice; the executioners laid\nhold of him, and M. Edgeworth took his leave in these memorable words:\n“Son of Saint Louis, ascend to heaven!”  As soon as the blood flowed,\nfurious wretches dipped their pikes and handkerchiefs in it, then\ndispersed throughout Paris, shouting “Vive la Republique!  Vive la\nNation!”  and even went to the gates of the Temple to display brutal and\nfactious joy.",
        "     [The body of Louis was, immediately after the execution, removed to\n     the ancient cemetery of the Madeleine.  Large quantities of\n     quicklime were thrown into the grave, which occasioned so rapid a\n     decomposition that, when his remains were nought for in 1816, it was\n     with difficulty any part could be recovered.  Over the spot where he\n     was interred Napoleon commenced the splendid Temple of Glory, after\n     the battle of Jena; and the superb edifice was completed by the\n     Bourbons, and now forms the Church of the Madeleine, the most\n     beautiful structure in Paris.  Louis was executed on the same ground\n     where the Queen, Madame Elisabeth, and so many other noble victims\n     of the Revolution perished; where Robespierre and Danton afterwards\n     suffered; and where the Emperor Alexander and the allied sovereigns\n     took their station, when their victorious troops entered Paris in\n     1814!

        "On the morning of the King’s execution, according to the narrative of\nMadame Royale, his family rose at six: “The night before, my mother had\nscarcely strength enough to put my brother to bed; She threw herself,\ndressed as she was, on her own bed, where we heard her shivering with\ncold and grief all night long.  At a quarter-past six the door opened; we\nbelieved that we were sent for to the King, but it was only the officers\nlooking for a prayer-book for him.  We did not, however, abandon the hope\nof seeing him, till shouts of joy from the infuriated populace told us\nthat all was over.  In the afternoon my mother asked to see Clery, who\nprobably had some message for her; we hoped that seeing him would\noccasion a burst of grief which might relieve the state of silent and\nchoking agony in which we saw her.”  The request was refused, and the\nofficers who brought the refusal said Clery was in “a frightful state of\ndespair” at not being allowed to see the royal family; shortly afterwards\nhe was dismissed from the Temple.",
        "“We had now a little more freedom,” continues the Princess; “our guards\neven believed that we were about to be sent out of France; but nothing\ncould calm my mother’s agony; no hope could touch her heart, and life or\ndeath became indifferent to her.  Fortunately my own affliction increased\nmy illness so seriously that it distracted her thoughts .  .  .  .\nMy mother would go no more to the garden, because she must have passed\nthe door of what had been my father’s room, and that she could not bear.\nBut fearing lest want of air should prove injurious to my brother and me,\nabout the end of February she asked permission to walk on the leads of\nthe Tower, and it was granted.”",
        "The Council of the Commune, becoming aware of the interest which these\nsad promenades excited, and the sympathy with which they were observed\nfrom the neighbouring houses, ordered that the spaces between the\nbattlements should be filled up with shutters, which intercepted the\nview.  But while the rules for the Queen’s captivity were again made more\nstrict, some of the municipal commissioners tried slightly to alleviate\nit, and by means of M. de Hue, who was at liberty in Paris, and the\nfaithful Turgi, who remained in the Tower, some communications passed\nbetween the royal family and their friends.  The wife of Tison, who\nwaited on the Queen, suspected and finally denounced these more lenient\nguardians,–[Toulan, Lepitre, Vincent, Bruno, and others.]–who were\nexecuted, the royal prisoners being subjected to a close examination.",
        "“On the 20th of April,” says Madame Royale, “my mother and I had just\ngone to bed when Hebert arrived with several municipals.  We got up\nhastily, and these men read us a decree of the Commune directing that we\nshould be searched.  My poor brother was asleep; they tore him from his\nbed under the pretext of examining it.  My mother took him up, shivering\nwith cold.  All they took was a shopkeeper’s card which my mother had\nhappened to keep, a stick of sealing-wax from my aunt, and from me ’une\nsacre coeur de Jesus’ and a prayer for the welfare of France.  The search\nlasted from half-past ten at night till four o’clock in the morning.”",
        "The next visit of the officials was to Madame Elisabeth alone; they found\nin her room a hat which the King had worn during his imprisonment, and\nwhich she had begged him to give her as a souvenir.  They took it from\nher in spite of her entreaties.  “It was suspicious,” said the cruel and\ncontemptible tyrants.",
        "The Dauphin became ill with fever, and it was long before his mother,\nwho watched by him night and day, could obtain medicine or advice for\nhim.  When Thierry was at last allowed to see him his treatment relieved\nthe most violent symptoms, but, says Madame Royale, “his health was never\nreestablished.  Want of air and exercise did him great mischief, as well\nas the kind of life which this poor child led, who at eight years of age\npassed his days amidst the tears of his friends, and in constant anxiety\nand agony.”",
        "While the Dauphin’s health was causing his family such alarm, they were\ndeprived of the services of Tison’s wife, who became ill, and finally\ninsane, and was removed to the Hotel Dieu, where her ravings were\nreported to the Assembly and made the ground of accusations against the\nroyal prisoners.",
        "     [This woman, troubled by remorse, lost her reason, threw herself at\n     the feet of the Queen, implored her pardon, and disturbed the Temple\n     for many days with the sight and the noise of her madness.  The\n     Princesses, forgetting the denunciations of this unfortunate being,\n     in consideration of her repentance and insanity, watched over her by\n     turns, and deprived themselves of their own food to relieve her.–\n     LAMARTINE, “History of the Girondists,” vol. iii., p.140.]",
        "No woman took her place, and the Princesses themselves made their beds,\nswept their rooms, and waited upon the Queen.",
        "Far worse punishments than menial work were prepared for them.  On 3d\nJuly a decree of the Convention ordered that the Dauphin should be\nseparated from his family and “placed in the most secure apartment of the\nTower.”  As soon as he heard this decree pronounced, says his sister, “he\nthrew himself into my mother’s arms, and with violent cries entreated not\nto be parted from her.  My mother would not let her son go, and she\nactually defended against the efforts of the officers the bed in which\nshe had placed him.  The men threatened to call up the guard and use\nviolence.  My mother exclaimed that they had better kill her than tear\nher child from her.  At last they threatened our lives, and my mother’s\nmaternal tenderness forced her to the sacrifice.  My aunt and I dressed\nthe child, for my poor mother had no longer strength for anything.\nNevertheless, when he was dressed, she took him up in her arms and\ndelivered him herself to the officers, bathing him with her tears,\nforeseeing that she was never to behold him again.  The poor little\nfellow embraced us all tenderly, and was carried away in a flood of\ntears.  My mother’s horror was extreme when she heard that Simon, a\nshoemaker by trade, whom she had seen as a municipal officer in the\nTemple, was the person to whom her child was confided .  .  .  .  The\nofficers now no longer remained in my mother’s apartment; they only came\nthree times a day to bring our meals and examine the bolts and bars of\nour windows; we were locked up together night and day.  We often went up\nto the Tower, because my brother went, too, from the other side.  The\nonly pleasure my mother enjoyed was seeing him through a crevice as he\npassed at a distance.  She would watch for hours together to see him as\nhe passed.  It was her only hope, her only thought.”",
        "The Queen was soon deprived even of this melancholy consolation.  On 1st\nAugust, 1793, it was resolved that she should be tried.  Robespierre\nopposed the measure, but Barere roused into action that deep-rooted\nhatred of the Queen which not even the sacrifice of her life availed to\neradicate.  “Why do the enemies of the Republic still hope for success?\"\nhe asked.  “Is it because we have too long forgotten the crimes of the\nAustrian?  The children of Louis the Conspirator are hostages for the\nRepublic .  .  .but behind them lurks a woman who has been the cause of\nall the disasters of France.”",
        "At two o’clock on the morning of the following day, the municipal\nofficers “awoke us,” says Madame Royale, “to read to my mother the decree\nof the Convention, which ordered her removal to the Conciergerie,",

My aunt and I immediately asked to be\nallowed to accompany my mother, but this favour was refused us.  All the\ntime my mother was making up a bundle of clothes to take with her, these\nofficers never left her.  She was even obliged to dress herself before\nthem, and they asked for her pockets, taking away the trifles they\ncontained.  She embraced me, charging me to keep up my spirits and my\ncourage, to take tender care of my aunt, and obey her as a second mother.\nShe then threw herself into my aunt’s arms, and recommended her children\nto her care; my aunt replied to her in a whisper, and she was then\nhurried away.

Marie\nAntoinette had been separated from her sister, her daughter, and her Son,\nby virtue of a decree which ordered the trial and exile of the last\nmembers of the family of the Bourbons.  She had been removed to the\nConciergerie, and there, alone in a narrow prison, she was reduced to\nwhat was strictly necessary, like the other prisoners.  The imprudence of\na devoted friend had rendered her situation still more irksome.\nMichonnis, a member of the municipality, in whom she had excited a warm\ninterest, was desirous of introducing to her a person who, he said,\nwished to see her out of curiosity.  This man, a courageous emigrant,\nthrew to her a carnation, in which was enclosed a slip of very fine paper\nwith these words: “Your friends are ready,\"–false hope, and equally\ndangerous for her who received it, and for him who gave it!  Michonnis\nand the emigrant were detected and forthwith apprehended; and the\nvigilance exercised in regard to the unfortunate prisoner became from\nthat day more rigorous than ever.",
        "     [The Queen was lodged in a room called the council chamber, which\n     was considered as the moat unwholesome apartment in the Conciergerie\n     on account of its dampness and the bad smells by which it was\n     continually affected.  Under pretence of giving her a person to wait\n     upon her they placed near her a spy,–a man of a horrible\n     countenance and hollow, sepulchral voice.  This wretch, whose name\n     was Barassin, was a robber and murderer by profession.  Such was the\n     chosen attendant on the Queen of France!  A few days before her\n     trial this wretch was removed and a gendarme placed in her chamber,\n     who watched over her night and day, and from whom she was not\n     separated, even when in bed, but by a ragged curtain.  In this\n     melancholy abode Marie Antoinette had no other dress than an old\n     black gown, stockings with holes, which she was forced to mend every\n     day; and she was entirely destitute of shoes.–DU  BROCA.]",
        "Gendarmes were to mount guard incessantly at the door of her prison, and\nthey were expressly forbidden to answer anything that she might say to\nthem.",
        "That wretch Hebert, the deputy of Chaumette, and editor of the disgusting\npaper Pere Duchesne, a writer of the party of which Vincent, Ronsin,\nVarlet, and Leclerc were the leaders–Hebert had made it his particular\nbusiness to torment the unfortunate remnant of the dethroned family.\nHe asserted that the family of the tyrant ought not to be better treated\nthan any sans-culotte family; and he had caused a resolution to be passed\nby which the sort of luxury in which the prisoners in the Temple were\nmaintained was to be suppressed.  They were no longer to be allowed\neither poultry or pastry; they were reduced to one sort of aliment for\nbreakfast, and to soup or broth and a single dish for dinner, to two\ndishes for supper, and half a bottle of wine apiece.  Tallow candles were\nto be furnished instead of wag, pewter instead of silver plate, and delft\nware instead of porcelain.  The wood and water carriers alone were\npermitted to enter their room, and that only accompanied by two\ncommissioners.  Their food was to be introduced to them by means of a\nturning box.  The numerous establishment was reduced to a cook and an\nassistant, two men-servants, and a woman-servant to attend to the linen.",
        "As soon as this resolution was passed, Hebert had repaired to the Temple\nand inhumanly taken away from the unfortunate prisoners even the most\ntrifling articles to which they attached a high value.  Eighty Louis\nwhich Madame Elisabeth had in reserve, and which she had received from\nMadame de Lamballe, were also taken away.  No one is more dangerous, more\ncruel, than the man without acquirements, without education, clothed with\na recent authority.  If, above all, he possess a base nature, if, like\nHebert, who was check-taker at the door of a theatre, and embezzled money\nout of the receipts, he be destitute of natural morality, and if he leap\nall at once from the mud of his condition into power, he is as mean as he\nis atrocious.  Such was Hebert in his conduct at the Temple.  He did not\nconfine himself to the annoyances which we have mentioned.  He and some\nothers conceived the idea of separating the young Prince from his aunt\nand sister.  A shoemaker named Simon and his wife were the instructors to\nwhom it was deemed right to consign him for the purpose of giving him a\nsans-cullotte education.  Simon and his wife were shut up in the Temple,\nand, becoming prisoners with the unfortunate child, were directed to\nbring him up in their own way.  Their food was better than that of the\nPrincesses, and they shared the table of the municipal commissioners who\nwere on duty.  Simon was permitted to go down, accompanied by two\ncommissioners, to the court of the Temple, for the purpose of giving the\nDauphin a little exercise.",
        "Hebert conceived the infamous idea of wringing from this boy revelations\nto criminate his unhappy mother.  Whether this wretch imputed to the\nchild false revelations, or abused his, tender age and his condition to\nextort from him what admissions soever he pleased, he obtained a\nrevolting deposition; and as the youth of the Prince did not admit of his\nbeing brought before the tribunal, Hebert appeared and detailed the\ninfamous particulars which he had himself either dictated or invented.",
        "It was on the 14th of October that Marie Antoinette appeared before her\njudges.  Dragged before the sanguinary tribunal by inexorable\nrevolutionary vengeance, she appeared there without any chance of\nacquittal, for it was not to obtain her acquittal that the Jacobins had\nbrought her before it.  It was necessary, however, to make some charges.\nFouquier therefore collected the rumours current among the populace ever\nsince the arrival of the Princess in France, and, in the act of\naccusation, he charged her with having plundered the exchequer, first for\nher pleasures, and afterwards in order to transmit money to her brother,\nthe Emperor.  He insisted on the scenes of the 5th and 6th of October,\nand on the dinners of the Life Guards, alleging that she had at that\nperiod framed a plot, which obliged the people to go to Versailles to\nfrustrate it.  He afterwards accused her of having governed her husband,\ninterfered in the choice of ministers, conducted the intrigues with the\ndeputies gained by the Court, prepared the journey to Varennes, provoked\nthe war, and transmitted to the enemy’s generals all our plans of\ncampaign.  He further accused her of having prepared a new conspiracy on\nthe 10th of August, of having on that day caused the people to be fired\nupon, having induced her husband to defend himself by taxing him with\ncowardice; lastly, of having never ceased to plot and correspond with\nforeigners since her captivity in the Temple, and of having there treated\nher young son as King.  We here observe how, on the terrible day of long-\ndeferred vengeance, when subjects at length break forth and strike such\nof their princes as have not deserved the blow, everything is distorted\nand converted into crime.  We see how the profusion and fondness for\npleasure, so natural to a young princess, how her attachment to her\nnative country, her influence over her husband, her regrets, always more\nindiscreet in a woman than a man, nay, even her bolder courage, appeared\nto their inflamed or malignant imaginations.",
        "It was necessary to produce witnesses.  Lecointre, deputy of Versailles,\nwho had seen what had passed on the 5th and 6th of October, Hebert, who\nhad frequently visited the Temple, various clerks in the ministerial\noffices, and several domestic servants of the old Court were summoned..\nAdmiral d’Estaing, formerly commandant of the guard of Versailles;\nManuel, the ex-procureur of the Commune; Latour-du-Pin, minister of war\nin 1789; the venerable Bailly, who, it was said, had been, with La\nFayette, an accomplice in the journey to Varennes; lastly, Valaze one of\nthe Girondists destined to the scaffold, were taken from their prisons\nand compelled to give evidence.",
        "No precise fact was elicited.  Some had seen the Queen in high spirits\nwhen the Life Guards testified their attachment; others had seen her\nvexed and dejected while being conducted to Paris, or brought back from\nVarennes; these had been present at splendid festivities which must have\ncost enormous sums; those had heard it said in the ministerial offices\nthat the Queen was adverse to the sanction of the decrees.  An ancient\nwaiting-woman of the Queen had heard the Duc de Coigny say, in 1788, that\nthe Emperor had already received two hundred millions from France to make\nwar upon the Turks.",
        "The cynical Hebert, being brought before the unfortunate Queen, dared at\nlength to prefer the charges wrung from the young Prince.  He said that\nCharles Capet had given Simon an account of the journey to Varennes, and\nmentioned La Fayette and Bailly as having cooperated in it.  He then\nadded that this boy was addicted to odious and very premature vices for\nhis age; that he had been surprised by Simon, who, on questioning him,\nlearned that he derived from his mother the vices in which he indulged.\nHebert said that it was no doubt the intention of Marie Antoinette, by\nweakening thus, early the physical constitution of her son, to secure to\nherself the means of ruling him in case he should ever ascend the throne.\nThe rumours which had been whispered for twenty years by a malicious\nCourt had given the people a most unfavourable opinion of the morals of\nthe Queen.  That audience, however, though wholly Jacobin, was disgusted\nat the accusations of Hebert.",
        "     [Can there be a more infernal invention than that made against the.\n     Queen by Hdbert,-namely, that she had had an improper intimacy with\n     her own son?  He made use of this sublime idea of which he boasted\n     in order to prejudice the women against the Queen, and to prevent\n     her execution from exciting pity.  It had, however, no other effect\n     than that of disgusting all parties.–PRUDHOMME.]",

Urged a new to explain herself, she\nsaid, with extraordinary emotion, “I thought that human nature would\nexcuse me from answering such an imputation, but I appeal from it to the\nheart of every mother here present.”  This noble and simple reply\naffected all who heard it.",
        "In the depositions of the witnesses, however, all was not so bitter for\nMarie Antoinette.  The brave D’Estaing, whose enemy she had been, would\nnot say anything to inculpate her, and spoke only of the courage which\nshe had shown on the 5th and 6th of October, and of the noble resolution\nwhich she had expressed, to die beside her husband rather than fly.\nManuel, in spite of his enmity to the Court during the time of the\nLegislative Assembly, declared that he could not say anything against the\naccused.  When the venerable Bailly was brought forward, who formerly so\noften predicted to the Court the calamities which its imprudence must\nproduce, he appeared painfully affected; and when he was asked if he knew\nthe wife of Capet, “Yes,” said he, bowing respectfully, “I have known\nMadame.”  He declared that he knew nothing, and maintained that the\ndeclarations extorted from the young Prince relative to the journey to\nVarennes were false.  In recompense for his deposition he was assailed\nwith outrageous reproaches, from which he might judge what fate would\nsoon be awarded to himself.",
        "In all the evidence there appeared but two serious facts, attested by\nLatour-du-Pin and Valaze, who deposed to them because they could not help\nit.  Latour-du-Pin declared that Marie Antoinette had applied to him for\nan accurate statement of the armies while he was minister of war.\nValaze, always cold, but respectful towards misfortune, would not say\nanything to criminate the accused; yet he could not help declaring that,\nas a member of the commission of twenty-four, being charged with his\ncolleagues to examine the papers found at the house of Septeuil,\ntreasurer of the civil list, he had seen bonds for various sums signed\nAntoinette, which was very natural; but he added that he had also seen a\nletter in which the minister requested the King to transmit to the Queen\nthe copy of the plan of campaign which he had in his hands.  The most\nunfavourable construction was immediately put upon these two facts, the\napplication for a statement of the armies, and the communication of the\nplan of campaign; and it was concluded that they could not be wanted for\nany other purpose than to be sent to the enemy, for it was not supposed\nthat a young princess should turn her attention, merely for her own\nsatisfaction, to matters of administration and military, plans.  After\nthese depositions, several others were received respecting the expenses\nof the Court, the influence of the Queen in public affairs, the scene of\nthe 10th of August, and what had passed in the Temple; and the most vague\nrumours and most trivial circumstances were eagerly caught at as proofs.",

When led out to\n     execution, she was dressed in white; she had cut off her hair with\n     her own hands.

        "The two Princesses left in the Temple were now almost inconsolable; they\nspent days and nights in tears, whose only alleviation was that they were\nshed together.  “The company of my aunt, whom I loved so tenderly,” said\nMadame Royale, “was a great comfort to me.  But alas!  all that I loved\nwas perishing around me, and I was soon to lose her also .  .  .  .  In\nthe beginning of September I had an illness caused solely by my anxiety\nabout my mother; I never heard a drum beat that I did not expect another\n3d of September.\"–[when the head of the Princesse de Lamballe was\ncarried to the Temple.]",
        "In the course of the month the rigour of their captivity was much\nincreased.  The Commune ordered that they should only have one room; that\nTison (who had done the heaviest of the household work for them, and\nsince the kindness they showed to his insane wife had occasionally given\nthem tidings of the Dauphin) should be imprisoned in the turret; that\nthey should be supplied with only the barest necessaries; and that no one\nshould enter their room save to carry water and firewood.  Their quantity\nof firing was reduced, and they were not allowed candles.  They were also\nforbidden to go on the leads, and their large sheets were taken away,\n“lest–notwithstanding the gratings!–they should escape from the\nwindows.”",
        "On 8th October, 1793, Madame Royale was ordered to go downstairs, that\nshe might be interrogated by some municipal officers.  “My aunt, who was\ngreatly affected, would have followed, but they stopped her.  She asked\nwhether I should be permitted to come up again; Chaumette assured her\nthat I should.  ’You may trust,’ said he, ’the word of an honest\nrepublican.  She shall return.’  I soon found myself in my brother’s\nroom, whom I embraced tenderly; but we were torn asunder, and I was\nobliged to go into another room.–[This was the last time the brother and\nsister met] .  .  .  Chaumette then questioned me about a thousand\nshocking things of which they accused my mother and aunt; I was so\nindignant at hearing such horrors that, terrified as I was, I could not\nhelp exclaiming that they were infamous falsehoods.",
        "“But in spite of my tears they still pressed their questions.  There were\nsome things which I did not comprehend, but of which I understood enough\nto make me weep with indignation and horror .  .  .  .  They then asked\nme about Varennes, and other things.  I answered as well as I could\nwithout implicating anybody.  I had always heard my parents say that it\nwere better to die than to implicate anybody.”  When the examination was\nover the Princess begged to be allowed to join her mother, but Chaumette\nsaid he could not obtain permission for her to do so.  She was then\ncautioned to say nothing about her examination to her aunt, who was next\nto appear before them.  Madame Elisabeth, her niece declares, “replied\nwith still more contempt to their shocking questions.”",
        "The only intimation of the Queen’s fate which her daughter and her\nsister-in-law were allowed to receive was through hearing her sentence\ncried by the newsman.  But “we could not persuade ourselves that she was\ndead,” writes Madame Royale.  “A hope, so natural to the unfortunate,\npersuaded us that she must have been saved.  For eighteen months I\nremained in this cruel suspense.  We learnt also by the cries of the\nnewsman the death of the Duc d’Orleans.",
        "     [The Duo d’Orleans, the early and interested propagator of the\n     Revolution, was its next victim.  Billaud Varennes said in the\n     Convention: “The time has come when all the conspirators should be\n     known and struck.  I demand that we no longer pass over in silence a\n     man whom we seem to have forgotten, despite the numerous facts\n     against him.  I demand that D’ORLEANS be sent to the Revolutionary\n     Tribunal.”  The Convention, once his hireling adulators, unanimously\n     supported the proposal.  In vain he alleged his having been\n     accessory to the disorders of 5th October, his support of the revolt\n     on 10th August, 1792, his vote against the King on 17th January,\n     1793.  His condemnation was pronounced.  He then asked only for a\n     delay of twenty-four hours, and had a repast carefully prepared, on\n     which he feasted with avidity.  When led out for execution he gazed\n     with a smile on the Palais Royal, the scene of his former orgies.\n     He was detained for a quarter of an hour before that palace by the\n     order of Robespierre, who had asked his daughter’s hand, and\n     promised in return to excite a tumult in which the Duke’s life\n     should be saved.  Depraved though he was, he would not consent to\n     such a sacrifice, and he met his fate with stoical fortitude.–\n     ALLISON, vol. iii., p. 172.]",
        "It was the only piece of news that reached us during the whole winter.”",
        "The severity with which the prisoners were treated was carried into every\ndetail of their life.  The officers who guarded them took away their\nchessmen and cards because some of them were named kings and queens, and\nall the books with coats of arms on them; they refused to get ointment\nfor a gathering on Madame Elisabeth’s arm; they, would not allow her to\nmake a herb-tea which she thought would strengthen her niece; they\ndeclined to supply fish or eggs on fast-days or during Lent, bringing\nonly coarse fat meat, and brutally replying to all remonstances, “None\nbut fools believe in that stuff nowadays.”  Madame Elisabeth never made\nthe officials another request, but reserved some of the bread and cafe-\nau-fait from her breakfast for her second meal.  The time during which\nshe could be thus tormented was growing short.",
        "On 9th May, 1794, as the Princesses were going to bed, the outside bolts\nof the door were unfastened and a loud knocking was heard.  “When my aunt\nwas dressed,” says Madame Royale, “she opened the door, and they said to\nher, ’Citoyenne, come down.’–’And my niece?’–’We shall take care of her\nafterwards.’ She embraced me, and to calm my agitation promised to\nreturn.  ’No, citoyenne,’ said the men, ’bring your bonnet; you shall not\nreturn.’  They overwhelmed her with abuse, but she bore it patiently,\nembracing me, and exhorting me to trust in Heaven, and never to forget\nthe last commands of my father and mother.”",
        "Madame Elisabeth was then taken to the Conciergerie, where she was\ninterrogated by the vice-president at midnight,’ and then allowed to take\nsome hours rest on the bed on which Marie Antoinette had slept for the\nlast time.  In the morning she was brought before the tribunal, with\ntwenty-four other prisoners, of varying ages and both sexes, some of whom\nhad once been frequently seen at Court.",

        "She was sentenced to death, and showed neither surprise nor grief.  “I am\nready to die,” she said, “happy in the prospect of rejoining in a better\nworld those whom I loved on earth.”",
        "On being taken to the room where those condemned to suffer at the same\ntime as herself were assembled, she spoke to them with so much piety and\nresignation that they were encouraged by her example to show calmness and\ncourage like her own.  The women, on leaving the cart, begged to embrace\nher, and she said some words of comfort to each in turn as they mounted\nthe scaffold, which she was not allowed to ascend till all her companions\nhad been executed before her eyes.",
        "     [Madame Elisabeth was one of those rare personages only seen at\n     distant intervals during the course of ages; she set an example of\n     steadfast piety in the palace of kings, she lived amid her family\n     the favourite of all and the admiration of the world ....  When I\n     went to Versailles Madame Elisabeth was twenty-two years of age.\n     Her plump figure and pretty pink colour must have attracted notice,\n     and her air of calmness and contentment even more than her beauty.\n     She was fond of billiards, and her elegance and courage in riding\n     were remarkable.  But she never allowed these amusements to\n     interfere with her religious observances.  At that time her wish to\n     take the veil at St. Cyr was much talked of, but the King was too\n     fond of his sister to endure the separation.  There were also\n     rumours of a marriage between Madame Elisabeth and the Emperor\n     Joseph.  The Queen was sincerely attached to her brother, and loved\n     her sister-in-law most tenderly; she ardently desired this marriage\n     as a means of raising the Princess to one of the first thrones in\n     Europe, and as a possible means of turning the Emperor from his\n     innovations.  She had been very carefully educated, had talent in\n     music and painting, spoke Italian and a little Latin, and understood\n     mathematics....  Her last moments were worthy of her courage and\n     virtue.–D’HEZECQUES’s “Recollections,” pp. 72-75.]",
        "“It is impossible to imagine my distress at finding myself separated from\nmy aunt,” says Madame Royale.  “Since I had been able to appreciate her\nmerits, I saw in her nothing but religion, gentleness, meekness, modesty,\nand a devoted attachment to her family; she sacrificed her life for them,\nsince nothing could persuade her to leave the King and Queen.  I never\ncan be sufficiently grateful to her for her goodness to me, which ended\nonly with her life.  She looked on me as her child, and I honoured and\nloved her as a second mother.  I was thought to be very like her in\ncountenance, and I feel conscious that I have something of her character.\nWould to God I might imitate her virtues, and hope that I may hereafter\ndeserve to meet her, as well as my dear parents, in the bosom of our\nCreator, where I cannot doubt that they enjoy the reward of their\nvirtuous lives and meritorious deaths.”",
        "Madame Royale vainly begged to be allowed to rejoin her mother or her\naunt, or at least to know their fate.  The municipal officers would tell\nher nothing, and rudely refused her request to have a woman placed with\nher.  “I asked nothing but what seemed indispensable, though it was often\nharshly refused,” she says.  “But I at least could keep myself clean.  I\nhad soap and water, and carefully swept out my room every day.  I had no\nlight, but in the long days I did not feel this privation much .  .  .  .\nI had some religious works and travels, which I had read over and over.\nI had also some knitting, ’qui m’ennuyait beaucoup’.”  Once, she\nbelieves, Robespierre visited her prison:",

        "But however hard Madame Royale’s lot might be, that of the Dauphin was\ninfinitely harder.  Though only eight years old when he entered the\nTemple, he was by nature and education extremely precocious; “his memory\nretained everything, and his sensitiveness comprehended everything.”  His\nfeatures “recalled the somewhat effeminate look of Louis XV., and the\nAustrian hauteur of Maria Theresa; his blue eyes, aquiline nose, elevated\nnostrils, well-defined mouth, pouting lips, chestnut hair parted in the\nmiddle and falling in thick curls on his shoulders, resembled his mother\nbefore her years of tears and torture.  All the beauty of his race, by\nboth descents, seemed to reappear in him.\"–[Lamartine]–  For some time\nthe care of his parents preserved his health and cheerfulness even in the\nTemple; but his constitution was weakened by the fever recorded by his\nsister, and his gaolers were determined that he should never regain\nstrength.",

        "“No.”",
        "“Poison him?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“What, then?”",

        "For such a purpose they could not have chosen their instruments better.\n“Simon and his wife, cut off all those fair locks that had been his\nyouthful glory and his mother’s pride.  This worthy pair stripped him of\nthe mourning he wore for his father; and as they did so, they called it\n’playing at the game of the spoiled king.’  They alternately induced him\nto commit excesses, and then half starved him.  They beat him\nmercilessly; nor was the treatment by night less brutal than that by day.\nAs soon as the weary boy had sunk into his first profound sleep, they\nwould loudly call him by name, ’Capet!  Capet!’ Startled, nervous, bathed\nin perspiration, or sometimes trembling with cold, he would spring up,\nrush through the dark, and present himself at Simon’s bedside, murmuring,\ntremblingly, ’I am here, citizen.’–’Come nearer; let me feel you.’\nHe would approach the bed as he was ordered, although he knew the\ntreatment that awaited him.  Simon would buffet him on the head, or kick\nhim away, adding the remark, ’Get to bed again, wolfs cub; I only wanted\nto know that you were safe.’  On one of these occasions, when the child\nhad fallen half stunned upon his own miserable couch, and lay there\ngroaning and faint with pain, Simon roared out with a laugh, ’Suppose you\nwere king, Capet, what would you do to me?’ The child thought of his\nfather’s dying words, and said, ’I would forgive you.’\"–[THIERS]",
        "The change in the young Prince’s mode of life, and the cruelties and\ncaprices to which he was subjected, soon made him fall ill, says his\nsister.  “Simon forced him to eat to excess, and to drink large\nquantities of wine, which he detested .  .  .  .  He grew extremely fat\nwithout increasing in height or strength.”  His aunt and sister, deprived\nof the pleasure of tending him, had the pain of hearing his childish\nvoice raised in the abominable songs his gaolers taught him.  The\nbrutality of Simon “depraved at once the body and soul of his pupil.  He\ncalled him the young wolf of the Temple.  He treated him as the young of\nwild animals are treated when taken from the mother and reduced to\ncaptivity,–at once intimidated by blows and enervated by taming.  He\npunished for sensibility; he rewarded meanness; he encouraged vice; he\nmade the child wait on him at table, sometimes striking him on the face\nwith a knotted towel, sometimes raising the poker and threatening to\nstrike him with it.”",
        "     [Simon left the Temple to become a municipal officer.  He was\n     involved in the overthrow of Robespierre, and guillotined the day\n     after him, 29th July, 1794.]",
        "Yet when Simon was removed the poor young Prince’s condition became even\nworse.  His horrible loneliness induced an apathetic stupor to which any\nsuffering would have been preferable.  “He passed his days without any\nkind of occupation; they did not allow him light in the evening.  His\nkeepers never approached him but to give him food;” and on the rare\noccasions when they took him to the platform of the Tower, he was unable\nor unwilling to move about.  When, in November, 1794, a commissary named\nGomin arrived at the Temple, disposed to treat the little prisoner with\nkindness, it was too late.  “He took extreme care of my brother,” says\nMadame Royale.  “For a long time the unhappy child had been shut up in\ndarkness, and he was dying of fright.  He was very grateful for the\nattentions of Gomin, and became much attached to him.”  But his physical\ncondition was alarming, and, owing to Gomin’s representations, a\ncommission was instituted to examine him.  “The commissioners appointed\nwere Harmond, Mathieu, and Reverchon, who visited ’Louis Charles,’ as he\nwas now called, in the month of February, 1795.  They found the young\nPrince seated at a square deal table, at which he was playing with some\ndirty cards, making card houses and the like,–the materials having been\nfurnished him, probably, that they might figure in the report as\nevidences of indulgence.  He did not look up from the table as the\ncommissioners entered.  He was in a slate-coloured dress, bareheaded; the\nroom was reported as clean, the bed in good condition, the linen fresh;\nhis clothes were also reported as new; but, in spite of all these\nassertions, it is well known that his bed had not been made for months,\nthat he had not left his room, nor was permitted to leave it, for any\npurpose whatever, that it was consequently uninhabitable, and that he was\ncovered with vermin and with sores.  The swellings at his knees alone\nwere sufficient to disable him from walking.  One of the commissioners\napproached the young Prince respectfully.  The latter did not raise his\nhead.  Harmond in a kind voice begged him to speak to them.  The eyes of\nthe boy remained fixed on the table before him.  They told him of the\nkindly intentions of the Government, of their hopes that he would yet be\nhappy, and their desire that he would speak unreservedly to the medical\nman that was to visit him.  He seemed to listen with profound attention,\nbut not a single word passed his lips.  It was an heroic principle that\nimpelled that poor young heart to maintain the silence of a mute in\npresence of these men.  He remembered too well the days when three other\ncommissaries waited on him, regaled him with pastry and wine, and\nobtained from him that hellish accusation against the mother that he\nloved.  He had learnt by some means the import of the act, so far as it\nwas an injury to his mother.  He now dreaded seeing again three\ncommissaries, hearing again kind words, and being treated again with fine\npromises.  Dumb as death itself he sat before them, and remained\nmotionless as stone, and as mute.” [THIERS]",
        "His disease now made rapid progress, and Gomin and Lasne, superintendents\nof the Temple, thinking it necessary to inform the Government of the\nmelancholy condition of their prisoner, wrote on the register: “Little\nCapet is unwell.”  No notice was taken of this account, which was renewed\nnext day in more urgent terms: “Little Capet is dangerously ill.”  Still\nthere was no word from beyond the walls.  “We must knock harder,” said\nthe keepers to each other, and they added, “It is feared he will not\nlive,” to the words “dangerously ill.”  At length, on Wednesday, 6th May,\n1795, three days after the first report, the authorities appointed M.\nDesault to give the invalid the assistance of his art.  After having\nwritten down his name on the register he was admitted to see the Prince.\nHe made a long and very attentive examination of the unfortunate child,\nasked him many questions without being able to obtain an answer, and\ncontented himself with prescribing a decoction of hops, to be taken by\nspoonfuls every half-hour, from six o’clock in the morning till eight in\nthe evening.  On the first day the Prince steadily refused to take it.\nIn vain Gomin several times drank off a glass of the potion in his\npresence; his example proved as ineffectual as his words.  Next day Lasne\nrenewed his solicitations.  “Monsieur knows very well that I desire\nnothing but the good of his health, and he distresses me deeply by thus\nrefusing to take what might contribute to it.  I entreat him as a favour\nnot to give me this cause of grief.”  And as Lasne, while speaking, began\nto taste the potion in a glass, the child took what he offered him out of\nhis hands.  “You have, then, taken an oath that I should drink it,” said\nhe, firmly; “well, give it me, I will drink it.”  From that moment he\nconformed with docility to whatever was required of him, but the policy\nof the Commune had attained its object; help had been withheld till it\nwas almost a mockery to supply it.",
        "The Prince’s weakness was excessive; his keepers could scarcely drag him\nto the, top of the Tower; walking hurt his tender feet, and at every step\nhe stopped to press the arm of Lasne with both hands upon his breast.  At\nlast he suffered so much that it was no longer possible for him to walk,\nand his keeper carried him about, sometimes on the platform, and\nsometimes in the little tower, where the royal family had lived at first.\nBut the slight improvement to his health occasioned by the change of air\nscarcely compensated for the pain which his fatigue gave him.  On the\nbattlement of the platform nearest the left turret, the rain had, by\nperseverance through ages, hollowed out a kind of basin.  The water that\nfell remained there for several days; and as, during the spring of 1795,\nstorms were of frequent occurrence, this little sheet of water was kept\nconstantly supplied.  Whenever the child was brought out upon the\nplatform, he saw a little troop of sparrows, which used to come to drink\nand bathe in this reservoir.  At first they flew away at his approach,\nbut from being accustomed to see him walking quietly there every day,\nthey at last grew more familiar, and did not spread their wings for\nflight till he came up close to them.  They were always the same, he knew\nthem by sight, and perhaps like himself they were inhabitants of that\nancient pile.  He called them his birds; and his first action, when the\ndoor into the terrace was opened, was to look towards that side,–and\nthe sparrows were always there.  He delighted in their chirping, and he\nmust have envied them their wings.",
        "Though so little could be done to alleviate his sufferings, a moral\nimprovement was taking place in him.  He was touched by the lively\ninterest displayed by his physician, who never failed to visit him at\nnine o’clock every morning.  He seemed pleased with the attention paid\nhim, and ended by placing entire confidence in M. Desault.  Gratitude\nloosened his tongue; brutality and insult had failed to extort a murmur,\nbut kind treatment restored his speech he had no words for anger, but he\nfound them to express his thanks.  M. Desault prolonged his visits as\nlong as the officers of the municipality would permit.  When they\nannounced the close of the visit, the child, unwilling to beg them to\nallow a longer time, held back M. Desault by the skirt of his coat.\nSuddenly M. Desault’s visits ceased.  Several days passed and nothing was\nheard of him.  The keepers wondered at his absence, and the poor little\ninvalid was much distressed at it.  The commissary on duty (M. Benoist)\nsuggested that it would be proper to send to the physician’s house to\nmake inquiries as to the cause of so long an absence.  Gomin and Larne\nhad not yet ventured to follow this advice, when next day M. Benoist was\nrelieved by M. Bidault, who, hearing M. Desault’s name mentioned as he\ncame in, immediately said, “You must not expect to see him any more; he\ndied yesterday.”",
        "M. Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de l’Humanite, was next\ndirected to attend the prisoner, and in June he found him in so alarming\na state that he at once asked for a coadjutor, fearing to undertake the\nresponsibility alone.  The physician–sent for form’s sake to attend the\ndying child, as an advocate is given by law to a criminal condemned\nbeforehand–blamed the officers of the municipality for not having\nremoved the blind, which obstructed the light, and the numerous bolts,\nthe noise of which never failed to remind the victim of his captivity.\nThat sound, which always caused him an involuntary shudder, disturbed him\nin the last mournful scene of his unparalleled tortures.  M. Pelletan\nsaid authoritatively to the municipal on duty, “If you will not take\nthese bolts and casings away at once, at least you can make no objection\nto our carrying the child into another room, for I suppose we are sent\nhere to take charge of him.”  The Prince, being disturbed by these words,\nspoken as they were with great animation, made a sign to the physician to\ncome nearer.  “Speak lower, I beg of you,” said he; “I am afraid they\nwill hear you up-stairs, and I should be very sorry for them to know that\nI am ill, as it would give them much uneasiness.”",
        "At first the change to a cheerful and airy room revived the Prince and\ngave him evident pleasure, but the improvement did not last.  Next day M.\nPelletan learned that the Government had acceded to his request for a\ncolleague.  M. Dumangin, head physician of the Hospice de l’Unite, made\nhis appearance at his house on the morning of Sunday, 7th June, with the\nofficial despatch sent him by the committee of public safety.  They\nrepaired together immediately to the Tower.  On their arrival they heard\nthat the child, whose weakness was excessive, had had a fainting fit,\nwhich had occasioned fears to be entertained that his end was\napproaching.  He had revived a little, however, when the physicians went\nup at about nine o’clock.  Unable to contend with increasing exhaustion,\nthey perceived there was no longer any hope of prolonging an existence\nworn out by so much suffering, and that all their art could effect would\nbe to soften the last stage of this lamentable disease.  While standing\nby the Prince’s bed, Gomin noticed that he was quietly crying, and asked\nhim.  kindly what was the matter.  “I am always alone,” he said.  “My\ndear mother remains in the other tower.”  Night came,–his last night,–\nwhich the regulations of the prison condemned him to pass once more in\nsolitude, with suffering, his old companion, only at his side.  This\ntime, however, death, too, stood at his pillow.  When Gomin went up to\nthe child’s room on the morning of 8th June, he said, seeing him calm,\nmotionless, and mute:",
        "“I hope you are not in pain just now?”",
        "“Oh, yes, I am still in pain, but not nearly so much,–the music is so\nbeautiful!”",
        "Now there was no music to be heard, either in the Tower or anywhere near.",
        "Gomin, astonished, said to him, “From what direction do you hear this\nmusic?”",
        "“From above!”",
        "“Have you heard it long?”",
        "“Since you knelt down.  Do you not hear it?  Listen!  Listen!”  And the\nchild, with a nervous motion, raised his faltering hand, as he opened his\nlarge eyes illuminated by delight.  His poor keeper, unwilling to destroy\nthis last sweet illusion, appeared to listen also.",
        "After a few minutes of attention the child again started, and cried out,\nin intense rapture, “Amongst all the voices I have distinguished that of\nmy mother!”",
        "These were almost his last words.  At a quarter past two he died, Lasne\nonly being in the room.  at the time.  Lasne acquainted Gomin and Damont,\nthe commissary on duty, with the event, and they repaired to the chamber\nof death.  The poor little royal corpse was carried from the room into\nthat where he had suffered so long,–where for two years he had never\nceased to suffer.  From this apartment the father had gone to the\nscaffold, and thence the son must pass to the burial-ground.  The remains\nwere laid out on the bed, and the doors of the apartment were set open,–\ndoors which had remained closed ever since the Revolution had seized on a\nchild, then full of vigour and grace and life and health!",
        "At eight o’clock next morning (9th June) four members of the committee of\ngeneral safety came to the Tower to make sure that the Prince was really\ndead.  When they were admitted to the death-chamber by Lasne and Damont\nthey affected the greatest indifference.  “The event is not of the least\nimportance,” they repeated, several times over; “the police commissary of\nthe section will come and receive the declaration of the decease; he will\nacknowledge it, and proceed to the interment without any ceremony; and\nthe committee will give the necessary directions.”  As they withdrew,\nsome officers of the Temple guard asked to see the remains of little\nCapet.  Damont having observed that the guard would not permit the bier\nto pass without its being opened, the deputies decided that the officers\nand non-commissioned officers of the guard going off duty, together with\nthose coming on, should be all invited to assure themselves of the\nchild’s death.  All having assembled in the room where the body lay, he\nasked them if they recognised it as that of the ex-Dauphin, son of the\nlast King of France.  Those who had seen the young Prince at the\nTuileries, or at the Temple (and most of them had), bore witness to its\nbeing the body of Louis XVII.  When they were come down into the council-\nroom, Darlot drew up the minutes of this attestation, which was signed by\na score of persons.  These minutes were inserted in the journal of the\nTemple tower, which was afterwards deposited in the office of the\nMinister of the Interior.",
        "During this visit the surgeons entrusted with the autopsy arrived at the\nouter gate of the Temple.  These were Dumangin, head physician of the\nHospice de l’Unite; Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de\nl’Humanite; Jeanroy, professor in the medical schools of Paris; and\nLaasus, professor of legal medicine at the Ecole de Sante of Paris.\nThe last two were selected by Dumangin and Pelletan because of the former\nconnection of M. Lassus with Mesdames de France, and of M. Jeanroy with\nthe House of Lorraine, which gave a peculiar weight to their signatures.\nGomin received them in the council-room, and detained them until the\nNational Guard, descending from the second floor, entered to sign the\nminutes prepared by Darlot.  This done, Lasne, Darlot, and Bouquet went\nup again with the surgeons, and introduced them into the apartment of\nLouis XVII., whom they at first examined as he lay on his death-bed; but\nM. Jeanroy observing that the dim light of this room was but little\nfavourable to the accomplishment of their mission, the commissaries\nprepared a table in the first room, near the window, on which the corpse\nwas laid, and the surgeons began their melancholy operation.",
        "At seven o’clock the police commissary ordered the body to be taken up,\nand that they should proceed to the cemetery.  It was the season of the\nlongest days, and therefore the interment did not take place in secrecy\nand at night, as some misinformed narrators have said or written; it took\nplace in broad daylight, and attracted a great concourse of people before\nthe gates of the Temple palace.  One of the municipals wished to have the\ncoffin carried out secretly by the door opening into the chapel\nenclosure; but M. Duaser, police commiasary, who was specially entrusted\nwith the arrangement of the ceremony, opposed this indecorous measure,\nand the procession passed out through the great gate.  The crowd that was\npressing round was kept back, and compelled to keep a line, by a\ntricoloured ribbon, held at short distances by gendarmes.  Compassion and\nsorrow were impressed on every countenance.",
        "A small detachment of the troops of the line from the garrison of Paris,\nsent by the authorities, was waiting to serve as an escort.  The bier,\nstill covered with the pall, was carried on a litter on the shoulders of\nfour men, who relieved each other two at a time; it was preceded by six\nor eight men, headed by a sergeant.  The procession was accompanied a\nlong way by the crowd, and a great number of persona followed it even to\nthe cemetery.  The name of “Little Capet,” and the more popular title of\nDauphin, spread from lip to lip, with exclamations of pity and\ncompassion.  The funeral entered the cemetery of Ste. Marguerite, not by\nthe church, as some accounts assert, but by the old gate of the cemetery.\nThe interment was made in the corner, on the left, at a distance of eight\nor nine feet from the enclosure wall, and at an equal distance from a\nsmall house, which subsequently served as a school.  The grave was filled\nup,–no mound marked its place, and not even a trace remained of the\ninterment!  Not till then did the commissaries of police and the\nmunicipality withdraw, and enter the house opposite the church to draw up\nthe declaration of interment.  It was nearly nine o’clock, and still\ndaylight.",

        "The last person to hear of the sad events in the Temple was the one for\nwhom they had the deepest and most painful interest.  After her brother’s\ndeath the captivity of Madame Royale was much lightened.  She was allowed\nto walk in the Temple gardens, and to receive visits from some ladies of\nthe old Court, and from Madame de Chantereine, who at last, after several\ntimes evading her questions, ventured cautiously to tell her of the\ndeaths of her mother, aunt, and brother.  Madame Royale wept bitterly,\nbut had much difficulty in expressing her feelings.  “She spoke so\nconfusedly,” says Madame de la Ramiere in a letter to Madame de Verneuil,\n“that it was difficult to understand her.  It took her more than a\nmonth’s reading aloud, with careful study of pronunciation, to make\nherself intelligible,–so much had she lost the power of expression.\"\nShe was dressed with plainness amounting to poverty, and her hands were\ndisfigured by exposure to cold and by the menial work she had been so\nlong accustomed to do for herself, and which it was difficult to persuade\nher to leave off.  When urged to accept the services of an attendant, she\nreplied, with a sad prevision of the vicissitudes of her future life,\nthat she did not like to form a habit which she might have again to\nabandon.  She suffered herself, however, to be persuaded gradually to\nmodify her recluse and ascetic habits.  It was well she did so, as a\npreparation for the great changes about to follow.",
        "Nine days after the death of her brother, the city of Orleans interceded\nfor the daughter of Louis XVI., and sent deputies to the Convention to\npray for her deliverance and restoration to her family.  Names followed\nthis example; and Charette, on the part of the Vendeans, demanded, as a\ncondition of the pacification of La Vendee, that the Princess should be\nallowed to join her relations.  At length the Convention decreed that\nMadame Royale should be exchanged with Austria for the representatives\nand ministers whom Dumouriez had given up to the Prince of Cobourg,–\nDrouet, Semonville, Maret, and other prisoners of importance.  At\nmidnight on 19th December, 1795, which was her birthday, the Princess was\nreleased from prison, the Minister of the Interior, M. Benezech, to avoid\nattracting public attention and possible disturbance, conducting her on\nfoot from the Temple to a neighbouring street, where his carriage awaited\nher.  She made it her particular request that Gomin, who had been so\ndevoted to her brother, should be the commissary appointed to accompany\nher to the frontier; Madame de Soucy, formerly under-governess to the\nchildren of France, was also in attendance; and the Princess took with\nher a dog named Coco, which had belonged to Louis XVI.",
        "     [The mention of the little dog taken from the Temple by Madame\n     Royale reminds me how fond all the family were of these creatures.\n     Each Princess kept a different kind.  Mesdames had beautiful\n     spaniels; little grayhounds were preferred by Madame Elisabeth.\n     Louis XVI. was the only one of all his family who had no dogs in his\n     room.  I remember one day waiting in the great gallery for the\n     King’s retiring, when he entered with all his family and the whole\n     pack, who were escorting him.  All at once all the dogs began to\n     bark, one louder than another, and ran away, passing like ghosts\n     along those great dark rooms, which rang with their hoarse cries.\n     The Princesses shouting, calling them, running everywhere after\n     them, completed a ridiculous spectacle, which made those august\n     persons very merry.–D’HEZECQUES, p. 49.]",
        "She was frequently recognised on her way through France, and always with\nmarks of pleasure and respect.",
        "It might have been supposed that the Princess would rejoice to leave\nbehind her the country which had been the scene of so many horrors and\nsuch bitter suffering.  But it was her birthplace, and it held the graves\nof all she loved; and as she crossed the frontier she said to those\naround her, “I leave France with regret, for I shall never cease to\nconsider it my country.”  She arrived in Vienna on 9th January, 1796, and\nher first care was to attend a memorial service for her murdered\nrelatives.  After many weeks of close retirement she occasionally began\nto appear in public, and people looked with interest at the pale, grave,\nslender girl of seventeen, dressed in the deepest mourning, over whose\nyoung head such terrible storms had swept.  The Emperor wished her to\nmarry the Archduke Charles of Austria, but her father and mother had,\neven in the cradle, destined her hand for her cousin, the Duc\nd’Angouleme, son of the Comte d’Artois, and the memory of their lightest\nwish was law to her.",
        "Her quiet determination entailed anger and opposition amounting to\npersecution.  Every effort was made to alienate her from her French\nrelations.  She was urged to claim Provence, which had become her own if\nLouis XVIII.  was to be considered King of France.  A pressure of opinion\nwas brought to bear upon her which might well have overawed so young a\ngirl.  “I was sent for to the Emperor’s cabinet,” she writes, “where I\nfound the imperial family assembled.  The ministers and chief imperial\ncounsellors were also present .  .  .  .  When the Emperor invited me to\nexpress my opinion, I answered that to be able to treat fittingly of such\ninterests I thought, I ought to be surrounded not only by my mother’s\nrelatives, but also by those of my father .  .  .  .  Besides, I said,\nI was above all things French, and in entire subjection to the laws of\nFrance, which had rendered me alternately the subject of the King my\nfather, the King my brother, and the King my uncle, and that I would\nyield obedience to the latter, whatever might be his commands.  This\ndeclaration appeared very much to dissatisfy all who were present, and\nwhen they observed that I was not to be shaken, they declared that my\nright being independent of my will, my resistance would not be the\nslightest obstacle to the measures they might deem it necessary to adopt\nfor the preservation of my interests.”",
        "In their anxiety to make a German princess of Marie Therese, her imperial\nrelations suppressed her French title as much as possible.  When, with\nsome difficulty, the Duc de Grammont succeeded in obtaining an audience\nof her, and used the familiar form of address, she smiled faintly, and\nbade him beware.  “Call me Madame de Bretagne, or de Bourgogne, or de\nLorraine,” she said, “for here I am so identified with these provinces\n–[which the Emperor wished her to claim from her uncle Louis XVIII.]–\nthat I shall end in believing in my own transformation.”  After these\ndiscussions she was so closely watched, and so many restraints were\nimposed upon her, that she was scarcely less a prisoner than in the old\ndays of the Temple, though her cage was this time gilded.  Rescue,\nhowever, was at hand.",
        "In 1798 Louis XVIII. accepted a refuge offered to him at Mittau by the\nCzar Paul, who had promised that he would grant his guest’s first\nrequest, whatever it might be.  Louis begged the Czar to use his\ninfluence with the Court of Vienna to allow his niece to join him.\n“Monsieur, my brother,” was Paul’s answer, “Madame Royale shall be\nrestored to you, or I shall cease to be Paul I.”  Next morning the Czar\ndespatched a courier to Vienna with a demand for the Princess, so\nenergetically worded that refusal must have been followed by war.\nAccordingly, in May, 1799, Madame Royale was allowed to leave the capital\nwhich she had found so uncongenial an asylum.",

He was a gentleman, and brave as became one.  He had not\n     the “gentlemanly vices” of his brother, and was all the better for\n     it.  He was ill educated, but had natural good sense, and would have\n     passed for having more than that had he cared to put forth\n     pretensions.

        "and de Berri, were awaiting her, attended by the Abbe Edgeworth, as chief\necclesiastic, and a little Court of refugee nobles and officers.  With\nthem were two men of humbler position, who must have been even more\nwelcome to Madame Royale,–De Malden, who had acted as courier to Louis\nXVI. during the flight to Varennes, and Turgi, who had waited on the\nPrincesses in the Temple.  It was a sad meeting, though so long anxiously\ndesired, and it was followed on 10th June, 1799, by an equally sad\nwedding,–exiles, pensioners on the bounty of the Russian monarch,\nfulfilling an engagement founded, not on personal preference, but on\nfamily policy and reverence for the wishes of the dead, the bride and\nbridegroom had small cause for rejoicing.  During the eighteen months of\ntranquil seclusion which followed her marriage, the favourite occupation\nof the Duchess was visiting and relieving the poor.  In January, 1801,\nthe Czar Paul, in compliance with the demand of Napoleon, who was just\nthen the object of his capricious enthusiasm, ordered the French royal\nfamily to leave Mittau.  Their wanderings commenced on the 21st, a day of\nbitter memories; and the young Duchess led the King to his carriage\nthrough a crowd of men, women, and children, whose tears and blessings\nattended them on their way.",
        "     [The Queen was too ill to travel.  The Duc d’Angouleme took another\n     route to join a body of French gentlemen in arms for the Legitimist\n     cause.]",
        "The exiles asked permission from the King of Prussia to settle in his\ndominions, and while awaiting his answer at Munich they were painfully\nsurprised by the entrance of five old soldiers of noble birth, part of\nthe body-guard they had left behind at Mittau, relying on the protection\nof Paul.  The “mad Czar” had decreed their immediate expulsion, and,\npenniless and almost starving, they made their way to Louis XVIII.  All\nthe money the royal family possessed was bestowed on these faithful\nservants, who came to them in detachments for relief, and then the\nDuchess offered her diamonds to the Danish consul for an advance of two\nthousand ducats, saying she pledged her property “that in our common\ndistress it may be rendered of real use to my uncle, his faithful\nservants, and myself.”  The Duchess’s consistent and unselfish kindness\nprocured her from the King, and those about him who knew her best, the\nname of “our angel.”",
        "Warsaw was for a brief time the resting-place of the wanderers, but there\nthey were disturbed in 1803 by Napoleon’s attempt to threaten and bribe\nLouis XVIII. into abdication.  It was suggested that refusal might bring\nupon them expulsion from Prussia.  “We are accustomed to suffering,” was\nthe King’s answer, “and we do not dread poverty.  I would, trusting in\nGod, seek another asylum.”  In 1808, after many changes of scene, this\nasylum was sought in England, Gosfield Hall, Essex, being placed at their\ndisposal by the Marquis of Buckingham.  From Gosfield, the King moved to\nHartwell Hall, a fine old Elizabethan mansion rented from Sir George Lee\nfor L 500 a year.  A yearly grant of L 24,000 was made to the exiled\nfamily by the British Government, out of which a hundred and forty\npersons were supported, the royal dinner-party generally numbering two\ndozen.",
        "At Hartwell, as in her other homes, the Duchess was most popular amongst\nthe poor.  In general society she was cold and reserved, and she disliked\nthe notice of strangers.  In March, 1814, the royalist successes at\nBordeaux paved the way for the restoration of royalty in France, and\namidst general sympathy and congratulation, with the Prince Regent\nhimself to wish them good fortune, the King, the Duchess, and their suite\nleft Hartwell in April, 1814.  The return to France was as triumphant as\na somewhat half-hearted and doubtful enthusiasm could make it, and most\nof such cordiality as there was fell to the share of the Duchess.  As she\npassed to Notre-Dame in May, 1814, on entering Paris, she was\nvociferously greeted.  The feeling of loyalty, however, was not much\nlonger-lived than the applause by which it was expressed; the Duchess had\nscarcely effected one of the strongest wishes of her heart,–the\nidentification of what remained of her parents’ bodies, and the\nmagnificent ceremony with which they were removed from the cemetery of\nthe Madeleine to the Abbey of St. Denis,–when the escape of Napoleon\nfrom Elba in February,1815, scattered the royal family and their\nfollowers like chaff before the wind.  The Duc d’Angouleme, compelled to\ncapitulate at Toulouse, sailed from Cette in a Swedish vessel.  The Comte\nd’Artois, the Duc de Berri, and the Prince de Conde withdrew beyond the\nfrontier.  The King fled from the capital.  The Duchesse d’Angouleme,\nthen at Bordeaux celebrating the anniversary of the Proclamation of Louis\nXVIII., alone of all her family made any stand against the general panic.\nDay after day she mounted her horse and reviewed the National Guard.  She\nmade personal and even passionate appeals to the officers and men,\nstanding firm, and prevailing on a handful of soldiers to remain by her,\neven when the imperialist troops were on the other side of the river and\ntheir cannon were directed against the square where the Duchess was\nreviewing her scanty followers.",
        "     [\"It was the Duchesse d’Angouleme who saved you,” said the gallant\n     General Clauzel, after these events, to a royalist volunteer;\n     “I could not bring myself to order such a woman to be fired upon,\n     at the moment when she was providing material for the noblest page\n     in her history.\"–\"Fillia Dolorosa,” vol. vii., p. 131.]",
        "With pain and difficulty she was convinced that resistance was vain;\nNapoleon’s banner soon floated over Bordeaux; the Duchess issued a\nfarewell proclamation to her “brave Bordelais,” and on the 1st April,\n1815, she started for Pouillac, whence she embarked for Spain.  During a\nbrief visit to England she heard that the reign of a hundred days was\nover, and the 27th of July, 1815, saw her second triumphal return to the\nTuileries.  She did not take up her abode there with any wish for State\nceremonies or Court gaieties.  Her life was as secluded as her position\nwould allow.  Her favourite retreat was the Pavilion, which had been\ninhabited by her mother, and in her little oratory she collected relics\nof her family, over which on the anniversaries of their deaths she wept\nand prayed.  In her daily drives through Paris she scrupulously avoided\nthe spot on which they had suffered; and the memory of the past seemed to\nrule all her sad and self-denying life, both in what she did and what she\nrefrained from doing.",
        "     [She was so methodical and economical, though liberal in her\n     charities, that one of her regular evening occupations was to tear\n     off the seals from the letters she had received during the day, in\n     order that the wax might be melted down and sold; the produce made\n     one poor family “passing rich with forty pounds a year.\"–See “Filia\n     Dolorosa,” vol. ii., p. 239.]",
        "Her somewhat austere goodness was not of a nature to make her popular.\nThe few who really understood her loved her, but the majority of her\npleasure-seeking subjects regarded her either with ridicule or dread.\nShe is said to have taken no part in politics, and to have exerted no\ninfluence in public affairs, but her sympathies were well known, and “the\nvery word liberty made her shudder;” like Madame Roland, she had seen “so\nmany crimes perpetrated under that name.”",
        "The claims of three pretended Dauphins–Hervagault, the son of the tailor\nof St. Lo; Bruneau, son of the shoemaker of Vergin; and Naundorf or\nNorndorff, the watchmaker somewhat troubled her peace, but never for a\nmoment obtained her sanction.  Of the many other pseudo-Dauphins (said to\nnumber a dozen and a half) not even the names remain.  In February,1820,\na fresh tragedy befell the royal family in the assassination of the Duc\nde Berri, brother-in-law of the Duchesse d’Angouleme, as he was seeing\nhis wife into her carriage at the door of the Opera-house.  He was\ncarried into the theatre, and there the dying Prince and his wife were\njoined by the Duchess, who remained till he breathed his last, and was\npresent when he, too, was laid in the Abbey of St. Denis.  She was\npresent also when his son, the Duc de Bordeaux, was born, and hoped that\nshe saw in him a guarantee for the stability of royalty in France.  In\nSeptember, 1824, she stood by the death-bed of Louis XVIII., and\nthenceforward her chief occupation was directing the education of the\nlittle Duc de Bordeaux, who generally resided with her at Villeneuve\nl’Etang, her country house near St.  Cloud.  Thence she went in July,\n1830, to the Baths of Vichy, stopping at Dijon on her way to Paris, and\nvisiting the theatre on the evening of the 27th.  She was received with\n“a roar of execrations and seditious cries,” and knew only too well what\nthey signified.  She instantly left the theatre and proceeded to Tonnere,\nwhere she received news of the rising in Paris, and, quitting the town by\nnight, was driven to Joigny with three attendants.  Soon after leaving\nthat place it was thought more prudent that the party should separate and\nproceed on foot, and the Duchess and M. de Foucigny, disguised as\npeasants, entered Versailles arm-in-arm, to obtain tidings of the King.\nThe Duchess found him at Rambouillet with her husband, the Dauphin, and\nthe King met her with a request for “pardon,” being fully conscious, too\nlate, that his unwise decrees and his headlong flight had destroyed the\nlast hopes of his family.  The act of abdication followed, by which the\nprospect of royalty passed from the Dauphin and his wife, as well as from\nCharles X.–Henri V. being proclaimed King, and the Duc d’Orleans (who\nrefused to take the boy monarch under his personal protection)\nlieutenant-general of the kingdom.",
        "Then began the Duchess’s third expatriation.  At Cherbourg the royal\nfamily, accompanied by the little King without a kingdom, embarked in the\n’Great Britain’, which stood out to sea.  The Duchess, remaining on deck\nfor a last look at the coast of France, noticed a brig which kept, she\nthought, suspiciously near them.",
        "“Who commands that vessel?” she inquired.",
        "“Captain Thibault.”",
        "And what are his orders?”",
        "“To fire into and sink the vessels in which we sail, should any attempt\nbe made to return to France.”",
        "Such was the farewell of their subjects to the House of Bourbon.  The\nfugitives landed at Weymouth; the Duchesse d’Angouleme under the title of\nComtesse de Marne, the Duchesse de Berri as Comtesse de Rosny, and her\nson, Henri de Bordeaux, as Comte de Chambord, the title he retained till\nhis death, originally taken from the estate presented to him in infancy\nby his enthusiastic people.  Holyrood, with its royal and gloomy\nassociations, was their appointed dwelling.  The Duc and Duchesse\nd’Angouleme, and the daughter of the Duc de Berri, travelled thither by\nland, the King and the young Comte de Chambord by sea.  “I prefer my\nroute to that of my sister,” observed the latter, “because I shall see the\ncoast of France again, and she will not.”",
        "The French Government soon complained that at Holyrood the exiles were\nstill too near their native land, and accordingly, in 1832, Charles X.,\nwith his son and grandson, left Scotland for Hamburg, while the Duchesse\nd’Angouleme and her niece repaired to Vienna.  The family were reunited\nat Prague in 1833, where the birthday of the Comte de Chambord was\ncelebrated with some pomp and rejoicing, many Legitimists flocking\nthither to congratulate him on attaining the age of thirteen, which the\nold law of monarchical France had fixed as the majority of her princes.\nThree years later the wanderings of the unfortunate family recommenced;\nthe Emperor Francis II. was dead, and his successor, Ferdinand, must\nvisit Prague to be crowned, and Charles X. feared that the presence of a\ndiscrowned monarch might be embarrassing on such an occasion.  Illness\nand sorrow attended the exiles on their new journey, and a few months\nafter they were established in the Chateau of Graffenburg at Goritz,\nCharles X. died of cholera, in his eightieth year.  At Goritz, also, on\nthe 31st May, 1844, the Duchesse d’Angouleme, who had sat beside so many\ndeath-beds, watched over that of her husband.  Theirs had not been a\nmarriage of affection in youth, but they respected each other’s virtues,\nand to a great extent shared each other’s tastes; banishment and\nsuffering had united them very closely, and of late years they had been\nalmost inseparable,–walking, riding, and reading together.  When the\nDuchesse d’Angouleme had seen her husband laid by his father’s side in\nthe vault of the Franciscan convent, she, accompanied by her nephew and\nniece, removed to Frohsdorf, where they spent seven tranquil years.  Here\nshe was addressed as “Queen” by her household for the first time in her\nlife, but she herself always recognised Henri, Comte de Chambord, as her\nsovereign.  The Duchess lived to see the overthrow of Louis Philippe, the\nusurper of the inheritance of her family.  Her last attempt to exert\nherself was a characteristic one.  She tried to rise from a sick-bed in\norder to attend the memorial service held for her mother, Marie\nAntoinette, on the 16th October, the anniversary of her execution.  But\nher strength was not equal to the task; on the 19th she expired, with her\nhand in that of the Comte de Chambord, and on 28th October, 1851, Marie\nTherese Charlotte, Duchesse d’Angouleme, was buried in the Franciscan\nconvent.",

        "“In the spring of 1814 a ceremony took place in Paris at which I was\npresent because there was nothing in it that could be mortifying to a\nFrench heart.  The death of Louis XVI.  had long been admitted to be one\nof the most serious misfortunes of the Revolution.  The Emperor Napoleon\nnever spoke of that sovereign but in terms of the highest respect, and\nalways prefixed the epithet unfortunate to his name.  The ceremony to\nwhich I allude was proposed by the Emperor of Russia and the King of\nPrussia.  It consisted of a kind of expiation and purification of the\nspot on which Louis XVI. and his Queen were beheaded.  I went to see the\nceremony, and I had a place at a window in the Hotel of Madame de\nRemusat, next to the Hotel de Crillon, and what was termed the Hotel de\nCourlande.",
        "“The expiation took place on the 10th of April.  The weather was\nextremely fine and warm for the season.  The Emperor of Russia and King\nof Prussia, accompanied by Prince Schwartzenberg, took their station at\nthe entrance of the Rue Royale; the King of Prussia being on the right of\nthe Emperor Alexander, and Prince Schwartzenberg on his left.  There was\na long parade, during which the Russian, Prussian and Austrian military\nbands vied with each other in playing the air, ’Vive Henri IV.!’\nThe cavalry defiled past, and then withdrew into the Champs Elysees;\nbut the infantry ranged themselves round an altar which was raised in the\nmiddle of the Place, and which was elevated on a platform having twelve\nor fifteen steps.  The Emperor of Russia alighted from his horse, and,\nfollowed by the King of Prussia, the Grand Duke Constantine, Lord\nCathcart, and Prince Schwartzenberg, advanced to the altar.  When the\nEmperor had nearly reached the altar the “Te Deum” commenced.  At the\nmoment of the benediction, the sovereigns and persons who accompanied\nthem, as well as the twenty-five thousand troops who covered the Place,\nall knelt down.  The Greek priest presented the cross to the Emperor\nAlexander, who kissed it; his example was followed by the individuals who\naccompanied him, though they were not of the Greek faith.  On rising, the\nGrand Duke Constantine took off his hat, and immediately salvoes of\nartillery were heard.”",
