        "There was once upon a time a good man who had two children: a girl by\na first wife, and a boy by the second. The girl was as white as milk,\nand her lips were like cherries. Her hair was like golden silk, and it\nhung to the ground. Her brother loved her dearly, but her wicked\nstepmother hated her. “Child,” said the stepmother one day, “go to the\ngrocer’s shop and buy me a pound of candles.” She gave her the money;\nand the little girl went, bought the candles, and started on her\nreturn. There was a stile to cross. She put down the candles whilst\nshe got over the stile. Up came a dog and ran off with the candles.",
        "She went back to the grocer’s, and she got a second bunch. She came to\nthe stile, set down the candles, and proceeded to climb over. Up came\nthe dog and ran off with the candles.",
        "She went again to the grocer’s, and she got a third bunch; and just\nthe same happened. Then she came to her stepmother crying, for she had\nspent all the money and had lost three bunches of candles.",
        "The stepmother was angry, but she pretended not to mind the loss. She\nsaid to the child: “Come, lay your head on my lap that I may comb your\nhair.” So the little one laid her head in the woman’s lap, who\nproceeded to comb the yellow silken hair. And when she combed the hair\nfell over her knees, and rolled right down to the ground.",
        "Then the stepmother hated her more for the beauty of her hair; so she\nsaid to her, “I cannot part your hair on my knee, fetch a billet of\nwood.” So she fetched it. Then said the stepmother, “I cannot part\nyour hair with a comb, fetch me an axe.” So she fetched it.",
        "“Now,” said the wicked woman, “lay your head down on the billet whilst\nI part your hair.”",
        "Well! she laid down her little golden head without fear; and whist!\ndown came the axe, and it was off. So the mother wiped the axe and\nlaughed.",
        "Then she took the heart and liver of the little girl, and she stewed\nthem and brought them into the house for supper. The husband tasted\nthem and shook his head. He said they tasted very strangely. She gave\nsome to the little boy, but he would not eat. She tried to force him,\nbut he refused, and ran out into the garden, and took up his little\nsister, and put her in a box, and buried the box under a rose-tree;\nand every day he went to the tree and wept, till his tears ran down on\nthe box.",
        "One day the rose-tree flowered. It was spring, and there among the\nflowers was a white bird; and it sang, and sang, and sang like an\nangel out of heaven. Away it flew, and it went to a cobbler’s shop,\nand perched itself on a tree hard by; and thus it sang,",
        "  “My wicked mother slew me,\n  My dear father ate me,\n  My little brother whom I love\n  Sits below, and I sing above\n    Stick, stock, stone dead.”",
        "“Sing again that beautiful song,” asked the shoemaker. “If you will\nfirst give me those little red shoes you are making.” The cobbler gave\nthe shoes, and the bird sang the song; then flew to a tree in front of\na watchmaker’s, and sang:",
        "  “My wicked mother slew me,\n  My dear father ate me,\n  My little brother whom I love\n  Sits below, and I sing above\n    Stick, stock, stone dead.”",
        "“Oh, the beautiful song! sing it again, sweet bird,” asked the\nwatchmaker. “If you will give me first that gold watch and chain in\nyour hand.” The jeweller gave the watch and chain. The bird took it in\none foot, the shoes in the other, and, after having repeated the song,\nflew away to where three millers were picking a millstone. The bird\nperched on a tree and sang:",
        "  “My wicked mother slew me,\n  My dear father ate me,\n  My little brother whom I love\n  Sits below, and I sing above\n    Stick!”",
        "Then one of the men put down his tool and looked up from his work,",
        "  “Stock!”",
        "Then the second miller’s man laid aside his tool and looked up,",
        "  “Stone!”",
        "Then the third miller’s man laid down his tool and looked up,",
        "  “Dead!”",
        "Then all three cried out with one voice: “Oh, what a beautiful song!\nSing it, sweet bird, again.” “If you will put the millstone round my\nneck,” said the bird. The men did what the bird wanted and away to the\ntree it flew with the millstone round its neck, the red shoes in one\nfoot, and the gold watch and chain in the other. It sang the song and\nthen flew home. It rattled the millstone against the eaves of the\nhouse, and the stepmother said: “It thunders.” Then the little boy ran\nout to see the thunder, and down dropped the red shoes at his feet. It\nrattled the millstone against the eaves of the house once more, and\nthe stepmother said again: “It thunders.” Then the father ran out and\ndown fell the chain about his neck.",
        "In ran father and son, laughing and saying, “See, what fine things the\nthunder has brought us!” Then the bird rattled the millstone against\nthe eaves of the house a third time; and the stepmother said: “It\nthunders again, perhaps the thunder has brought something for me,” and\nshe ran out; but the moment she stepped outside the door, down fell\nthe millstone on her head; and so she died.",
