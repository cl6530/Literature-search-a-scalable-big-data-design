        "No one would have believed in the last years of the\nnineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly\nand closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as\nmortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their\nvarious concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps\nalmost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scru-\ntinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a\ndrop of water.  With infinite complacency men went to and\nfro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their\nassurance of their empire over matter.  It is possible that the\ninfusoria under the microscope do the same.  No one gave\na thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human\ndanger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life\nupon them as impossible or improbable.  It is curious to recall\nsome of the mental habits of those departed days.  At most\nterrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars,\nperhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a mis-\nsionary enterprise.  Yet across the gulf of space, minds that\nare to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish,\nintellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this\nearth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their\nplans against us.  And early in the twentieth century came\nthe great disillusionment.",
        "The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, re-\nvolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles,\nand the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half\nof that received by this world.  It must be, if the nebular\nhypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long\nbefore this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface\nmust have begun its course.  The fact that it is scarcely\none seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated\nits cooling to the temperature at which life could begin.  It\nhas air and water and all that is necessary for the support of\nanimated existence.",
        "Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no\nwriter, up to the very end of the nineteenth century, ex-\npressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed\nthere far, or indeed at all, beyond its earthly level.  Nor was\nit generally understood that since Mars is older than our earth,\nwith scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter\nfrom the sun, it necessarily follows that it is not only more\ndistant from time’s beginning but nearer its end.",
        "The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet\nhas already gone far indeed with our neighbour.  Its physical\ncondition is still largely a mystery, but we know now that\neven in its equatorial region the midday temperature barely\napproaches that of our coldest winter.  Its air is much more\nattenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until they cover\nbut a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change huge\nsnowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically\ninundate its temperate zones.  That last stage of exhaustion,\nwhich to us is still incredibly remote, has become a present-\nday problem for the inhabitants of Mars.  The immediate\npressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged\ntheir powers, and hardened their hearts.  And looking across\nspace with instruments, and intelligences such as we have\nscarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only\n35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope,\nour own warmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with\nwater, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility, with\nglimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches\nof populous country and narrow, navy-crowded seas.",
        "And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must\nbe to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys\nand lemurs to us.  The intellectual side of man already admits\nthat life is an incessant struggle for existence, and it would\nseem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars.\nTheir world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still\ncrowded with life, but crowded only with what they regard\nas inferior animals.  To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their\nonly escape from the destruction that, generation after gener-\nation, creeps upon them.",
        "And before we judge of them too harshly we must remem-\nber what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has\nwrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison\nand the dodo, but upon its inferior races.  The Tasmanians,\nin spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of\nexistence in a war of extermination waged by European immi-\ngrants, in the space of fifty years.  Are we such apostles of\nmercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same\nspirit?",
        "The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with\namazing subtlety--their mathematical learning is evidently\nfar in excess of ours--and to have carried out their prepara-\ntions with a well-nigh perfect unanimity.  Had our instru-\nments permitted it, we might have seen the gathering trouble\nfar back in the nineteenth century.  Men like Schiaparelli\nwatched the red planet--it is odd, by-the-bye, that for count-\nless centuries Mars has been the star of war--but failed to\ninterpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they\nmapped so well.  All that time the Martians must have been\ngetting ready.",
        "During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on\nthe illuminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory,\nthen by Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers.  English\nreaders heard of it first in the issue of NATURE dated August 2.\nI am inclined to think that this blaze may have been the\ncasting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk into their planet,\nfrom which their shots were fired at us.  Peculiar markings, as\nyet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak\nduring the next two oppositions.",
        "The storm burst upon us six years ago now.  As Mars\napproached opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the\nastronomical exchange palpitating with the amazing intelli-\ngence of a huge outbreak of incandescent gas upon the planet.\nIt had occurred towards midnight of the twelfth; and the\nspectroscope, to which he had at once resorted, indicated a\nmass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an\nenormous velocity towards this earth.  This jet of fire had\nbecome invisible about a quarter past twelve.  He compared\nit to a colossal puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted\nout of the planet, “as flaming gases rushed out of a gun.”",
        "A singularly appropriate phrase it proved.  Yet the next day\nthere was nothing of this in the papers except a little note in\nthe DAILY TELEGRAPH, and the world went in ignorance of one\nof the gravest dangers that ever threatened the human race.\nI might not have heard of the eruption at all had I not met\nOgilvy, the well-known astronomer, at Ottershaw.  He was\nimmensely excited at the news, and in the excess of his feel-\nings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a\nscrutiny of the red planet.",
        "In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember\nthat vigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory,\nthe shadowed lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor\nin the corner, the steady ticking of the clockwork of the tele-\nscope, the little slit in the roof--an oblong profundity with\nthe stardust streaked across it.  Ogilvy moved about, invisible\nbut audible.  Looking through the telescope, one saw a circle\nof deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the\nfield.  It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and\nstill, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightly\nflattened from the perfect round.  But so little it was, so\nsilvery warm--a pin’s-head of light!  It was as if it quivered,\nbut really this was the telescope vibrating with the activity\nof the clockwork that kept the planet in view.",
        "As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller\nand to advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye\nwas tired.  Forty millions of miles it was from us--more than\nforty millions of miles of void.  Few people realise the im-\nmensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe\nswims.",
        "Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of\nlight, three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around\nit was the unfathomable darkness of empty space.  You know\nhow that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night.  In a tele-\nscope it seems far profounder.  And invisible to me because\nit was so remote and small, flying swiftly and steadily towards\nme across that incredible distance, drawing nearer every min-\nute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were\nsending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and\ncalamity and death to the earth.  I never dreamed of it then\nas I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring\nmissile.",
        "That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from\nthe distant planet.  I saw it.  A reddish flash at the edge, the\nslightest projection of the outline just as the chronometer\nstruck midnight; and at that I told Ogilvy and he took my\nplace.  The night was warm and I was thirsty, and I went\nstretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark-\nness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy\nexclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.",
        "That night another invisible missile started on its way to\nthe earth from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four\nhours after the first one.  I remember how I sat on the table\nthere in the blackness, with patches of green and crimson\nswimming before my eyes.  I wished I had a light to smoke\nby, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I had\nseen and all that it would presently bring me.  Ogilvy watched\ntill one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and\nwalked over to his house.  Down below in the darkness were\nOttershaw and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people,\nsleeping in peace.",
        "He was full of speculation that night about the condition\nof Mars, and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having in-\nhabitants who were signalling us.  His idea was that meteorites\nmight be falling in a heavy shower upon the planet, or that\na huge volcanic explosion was in progress.  He pointed out\nto me how unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken\nthe same direction in the two adjacent planets.",
        "“The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a\nmillion to one,” he said.",
        "Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the\nnight after about midnight, and again the night after; and\nso for ten nights, a flame each night.  Why the shots ceased\nafter the tenth no one on earth has attempted to explain.\nIt may be the gases of the firing caused the Martians in-\nconvenience.  Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible through\na powerful telescope on earth as little grey, fluctuating\npatches, spread through the clearness of the planet’s atmos-\nphere and obscured its more familiar features.",
        "Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at\nlast, and popular notes appeared here, there, and everywhere\nconcerning the volcanoes upon Mars.  The seriocomic periodi-\ncal PUNCH, I remember, made a happy use of it in the\npolitical cartoon.  And, all unsuspected, those missiles the\nMartians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a\npace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of\nspace, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and nearer.  It\nseems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that, with\nthat swift fate hanging over us, men could go about their\npetty concerns as they did.  I remember how jubilant Markham\nwas at securing a new photograph of the planet for the\nillustrated paper he edited in those days.  People in these\nlatter times scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise\nof our nineteenth-century papers.  For my own part, I was\nmuch occupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy\nupon a series of papers discussing the probable developments\nof moral ideas as civilisation progressed.",
        "One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been\n10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife.  It\nwas starlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to\nher, and pointed out Mars, a bright dot of light creeping\nzenithward, towards which so many telescopes were pointed.\nIt was a warm night.  Coming home, a party of excursionists\nfrom Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing\nmusic.  There were lights in the upper windows of the houses\nas the people went to bed.  From the railway station in the\ndistance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and\nrumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance.  My\nwife pointed out to me the brightness of the red, green, and\nyellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the sky.\nIt seemed so safe and tranquil.",
