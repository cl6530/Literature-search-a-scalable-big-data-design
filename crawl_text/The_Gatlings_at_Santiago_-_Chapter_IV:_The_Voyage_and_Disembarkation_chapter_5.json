        "It seemed that the work had been accomplished none too soon, for on\nthe morning of June 7th orders came to the Cherokee to leave the slip\nand proceed down the bay. There were on board at this time, beside the\nlittle Gatling Gun Detachment, the 17th Infantry, under command of\nCol. Haskell, and a battalion of the 12th Infantry, under command of\nCol. Comba, who was the senior officer on board. The ship was\nfrightfully crowded. The berth deck and lower deck had been arranged\nfor the accommodation of the men by nailing rows of two 2x4 scantlings\njust far enough apart to leave room for a man to lie down, and\nfastening three tiers of bunks to these scantlings. The men were\npacked in these bunks like sardines in a box. The ventilation was\nconspicuous by its absence, the heat below deck was frightful and the\nmisery entailed by such accommodations was beyond description. But the\nmen were very cheerful, and, being allowed the privilege of the upper\ndeck, very little in the way of complaint was heard. Everybody was\nanxious to be off. The hope most frequently expressed was for a quick\npassage and a sharp, swift campaign. It was easily foreseen by the\nofficers on board the ship that a long sojourn on shipboard under such\nconditions would have a very bad effect on the men.",
        "The ship dropped down the bay to the quarantine station, starting\nabout noon, and there lay to, waiting, as was supposed, for the\nremainder of the fleet. Suddenly, about 8 p. m., one of the torpedo\ncruisers came tearing down the bay under full steam, and we heard the\nmessage sounded through the megaphone: “Return to port. Three Spanish\ncruisers within three hours’ sail of the offing.” It was a thrilling\nmoment. Officers and men were lounging, taking, as they supposed,\ntheir last view of the American shores, without a suspicion of present\ndanger, when they were rapidly brought to a realizing sense that “war\nis hell,” by a notice that the enemy was upon them. Whether they were\nin danger or not, the danger was deadly real and imminent to them at\nthe time.",
        "The Cherokee had been anchored pretty well inside. She immediately got\nup steam and went out to warn other vessels farther out in the offing,\nand then made safely for the harbor. Officers and men behaved with\nperfect coolness. It was hopeless to attempt to escape by concealment,\nso Col. Comba ordered out the band of the 17th Infantry and the good\nship fled up the bay, in momentary expectation of a smashing shot from\nthe enemy, to the strains of “There’ll be a hot time.” What little\nexcitement there was displayed itself in a feverish searching of the\nbay with field-glasses for signs of the enemy. The older officers,\nupon whom the responsibility was resting, sat upon the quarter-deck,\nsmoking their pipes and discussing the situation. The captains quietly\nmoved about, assigning stations to their companies, in case of attack,\nwith the view of trying the effect of the modern rifle upon the\narmored sides of a Spanish man-of-war, and two of the younger officers\ntook advantage of the catchy air which the band was playing to dance a\ntwo-step on the quarter-deck. So the evening wore away. The moon went\ndown. The myriad little stars came out, twinkling in the deep blue\nsky, and at last both officers and men, tired of looking for an enemy\nwho was never to appear, turned in for such sleep as they could get,\nleaving a small guard on deck to keep a lookout. When they awoke next\nmorning, the ship was in the deepest part of the nearest slip, moored\nfast by her guy-ropes to the dock. Thus ended the first engagement\nwith the enemy.",
        "From the 8th until the 13th, the Cherokee lay at anchor in the slip.\nShe was relieved on the 10th of about 200 men, thus slightly\nlightening her overcrowded condition. In the meantime, this\novercrowded condition of the ship had led to some discussion as to who\ncould best be moved on board some other ship, with some prospect that\nthe Gatling Gun Detachment might be disturbed. The situation was not\nat all satisfactory. With four guns, no mules, no harness, no\nauthority, and only twelve men, the Gatling Gun Detachment did not\nappear to be in a very fair way toward inflicting much damage upon the\nenemy. So on the 11th of June the detachment commander visited Gen.\nShafter at his headquarters, determined to bring the matter to an\nissue, definitely, one way or the other. This was the first time he\nhad met the general, and, under the circumstances, the manner of his\nreception appeared to be doubtful.",
        "Gen. Shafter is a big man. This is not noticed at first glance. He is\nabove the average height, but his corpulent figure does not indicate\nthat he is full five feet nine inches in height, because his girth is\nof like proportion. His hands are big; his arm is big; his head is\nbig. The occiput is especially full, and the width of head just over\nthe ears is noticeable. There is plenty of room for the organs of\ncombativeness. One would think he is probably a lover of children;\nduring this interview he patted the head of an inquisitive dog, which\nevidently belonged somewhere on board the flag-ship, and which strayed\ninto the room. His eyes are big, very full and very keen. As you enter\nhe says curtly, “Take a seat.” He waits, looking down, for you to\nstate your business, then suddenly fixes you with a piercing glance,\nand goes to the heart of the subject by one incisive sentence, which\nleaves no more to be said. This description is a general type of\nseveral interviews with him. On this occasion the general inquired\nconcerning the facts, looking keenly, searchingly, and meditatively at\nthe detachment commander. The machine gun man was “on trial.” Then the\ngeneral broke the silence by one short question, “What do you want?\"\nand the reply was in kind, “Twenty men, general, with the privilege of\nselecting them.” The general suggested the advisability of taking a\ncomplete organization; to which was replied, “That at this late hour\nin the expedition it is imperative to have selected men in order to\nperform the required duty; that men taken at random, as would be the\ncase in a complete organization such as a company, would not be likely\nto have the required characteristics.” The general tersely remarked,\n“You may have them. Make out your list, name any man in the corps that\nyou want, and hand the list to me. I will send the men to you.” The\ntrial was over, and the Machine Gun Detachment was a settled fact.",
        "Accordingly on the following day Special Orders No. 16 were issued, as\nfollows:",
        "Extract.",
        "“Headquarters 5th Army Corps,\n“On Board S. S. Seguransa,\n“Tampa Bay, Fla., June 11, 1898.",
        "“Special Orders, No. 16:",
        "“4. The following named enlisted men are detailed for duty with the\nGatling Gun Detachment, 5th Army Corps, and will report at once to 2d\nLieut. John H. Parker, 13th Infantry, commanding the detachment for\nduty:",
        "“9th Infantry: Sergeant Weigle.",
        "“12th Infantry: Privates Voelker, Company A; Anderson, Lauer, and\nTimberly, Company C; Prazak, Company E.",

        "“17th Infantry: Privates Merryman and Schulze, Company A; McDonald,\nCompany B; Elkins, Dellett, and McGoin, Company D; Click, Needle,\nShiffer, and Sine, Company E.",
        "“Each of the soldiers will report equipped as follows: Blanket-roll\ncomplete, haversack and contents, canteen, waist-belt of leather,\nhunting-knife, and revolver, and they will be rationed with ten days’\ntravel rations. Descriptive lists of these men will be sent to the\ncommanding officer of the detachment.",
        "“By command of Maj.-Gen. Shafter.",
        "“Official. J. D. Miley, E. J. McClernand,\n                 “Aide.    Asst. Adj.-Gen.”",
        "“Headquarters 5th Army Corps,\n“On Board S. S. Seguransa,\n“Tampa Bay, June 11, 1898.",
        "“Special Orders, No. 16:",
        "Extract.",
        "“5. 2d Lieut. John H. Parker, 13th Infantry, commanding the Gatling\nGun Detachment, 5th Army Corps, is authorized to make the usual\nrequisitions for supplies.",
        "“By command of Maj.-Gen. Shafter.",
        "“Official. J. D. Miley, E. J. McClernand,\n                 “Aide.    Asst. Adj.-Gen.”",
        "The organization was thus perfected by a single stroke of the\ngeneral’s pen on the 11th of June, theoretically; practically it was\nthe 14th of June before the details from the 12th and 17th Infantry\nreported, and when they did, instead of being equipped as directed,\nthey carried rifles with 100 rounds of ammunition.",
        "Serg. Weigle, of the 9th Infantry, who reported at the same time,\ncarried a revolver. On the 14th a wigwag message was received from the\n13th Infantry, inquiring whether the detail was desired to report at\nonce or not, to which the reply was sent that it was desired to report\nat the earliest possible moment. It did not report.",
        "The detachment was at once organized as well as possible for the trip\non board the transport, and the guns brought up from the hold of the\nship and mounted in such a way that they would be ready for instant\nuse. It was not known but that the detachment might have to\nparticipate in a naval engagement, and the value of machine guns in\nthe navy has long been demonstrated. At any rate, it was determined to\nbe ready to give a warm reception to any torpedo vessel which might\nattempt to attack the Cherokee. One object of getting the guns up was\nto give instruction to the new men who reported on the 14th. Sergt.\nWeigle was well instructed in the use of Gatling guns, but none of the\nother members of the detachment had ever received any instruction, and\nhad been selected rather on the ground of their superior intelligence\nand courage than on any special knowledge of machine guns. They were\ngiven a drill each day in loading and firing the piece, during the\ntime they remained on board the transport, when the weather permitted.",
        "The condition of the troops on board the transport was miserable. The\nfollowing extract from a letter written at that time will convey some\nidea of the crowded, ill-ventilated condition of the vessel:",
        "“We have now been on board the transport a week, and are getting into\na frame of mind suitable for desperate work. If you can imagine 1000\nmen crowded into space needed for 500, and then kept there without\nroom to stand or move or sit for seven days, under a tropical sun, in\nfoul holds utterly without ventilation (just imagine it!), endured\nwithout a single murmur or complaint, not stoically, but patiently and\nintelligently, while every officer on board is kicking as hard and as\noften as possible for the relief of his men, then you will have some\nidea of the situation. The men are very patient, but they know someone\nhas blundered. Talk about the heroism of the Light Brigade! It is\nnothing to the heroism that goes cheerfully and uncomplainingly into\nthe Black Hole of Calcutta (there is nothing else that will compare\nwith these transports), all because it is duty. When will the people\nappreciate the heroism of the Regular Army?”",
        "This was the actual condition of affairs on board the Cherokee\nup to the time of leaving port on the 14th of June, and it was\nmodified only by the hoisting of wind-sails, after we got under way.\nThese were not very efficient and there were only two of them, so very\nlittle relief was given to the overcrowded berth-deck. Most of the men\nspent their time on the upper deck, and one whole company was\nquartered there. At night, after 8 o’clock, Col. Comba authorized the\nmen to sleep on deck, and there was always a rush, when the ship’s\nbell struck the hour, for good places on the quarter-deck. The only\nthing that made the voyage endurable was the good weather which\nprevailed. This prevented seasickness, to a certain extent.",
        "The squadron reached Santiago de Cuba, and after tacking about for\nseveral days, either for the purpose of deceiving the enemy, or of\nwaiting a decision as to the landing-place, finally approached\nBaiquiri, which had been selected for the landing. The troops on the\nCherokee began to land on the 23d of June, the battalion of the\n12th Infantry going first. This was followed by the 17th Infantry, and\nupon its departure the captain of the Cherokee put to sea. The\nreason for this maneuver is not known. The orders issued by Gen.\nShafter in regard to the landing were that the Gatling Gun Detachment\nshould accompany Gen. Lawton’s Division. This movement of the\nCherokee completely blocked the landing of the Gatling guns. The\nship’s captain was finally induced to put back into the bay and speak\nto the Seguransa, and Gen. Shafter directed that the detachment should\nbe taken off the next morning.",
        "An effort was made, therefore, to obtain the use of a lighter which\nwas not at that time in use, but the Commissary Department refused to\nyield the boat, and it remained until 11 o’clock the next morning tied\nup to the wharf with half a load of commissaries on board before it\nbecame available, and then was seized by the Quartermaster’s\nDepartment. An effort was then made to obtain the use of three\npontoons, belonging to the Engineer Department, which had been drawn\nup to the shore and were of no use to anybody. The young engineer\nofficer in charge of these boats, a premature graduate of the class of\n’98, was “afraid the boats might get smashed in the surf,” and could\nnot consent without seeing Col. Derby. Col. Derby could not be found.",
        "A wigwag came from Gen. Shafter, asking whether the Gatling guns had\nbeen landed. The reply, “No; may I use pontoons?” was answered at\nonce, “Use pontoons, and get off immediately.” On returning to shore\nwith a party to work the pontoons, the party was stopped in the act of\nlaunching the first boat by Gen. Sumner, and ordered to proceed to the\nCherokee, take her out into the offing, and order another to take her\nplace to unload. Protesting against this action, and informing Gen.\nSumner of the urgent orders for the Gatling guns to disembark at once,\nthat officer inquired the opinion of the prematurely graduated\nengineer as to the practicability of using the pontoons, and this\nexperienced young man again expressed the fear that the boats might be\ninjured in the surf. To the detachment commander’s indignant\nexclamation, “What the h– were these boats made for, if they are not\nto be used and smashed?” Gen. Sumner responded by a peremptory order\nto warp the Cherokee out from the pier and send the other vessels in.\nThe order was obeyed, and all the circumstances reported to Gen.\nShafter the same evening, with the expression of the opinion that if\nthe general wanted the Gatling guns landed, he would have to attend to\nit personally, because the Gatling gun commander did not have\nsufficient rank to accomplish it in the face of all these obstacles.\nEarly on the morning of June 25th, therefore, Gen. Shafter sent\nperemptory orders to the lighter to lay alongside the Cherokee, take\nthe Gatling guns and detachment on board, and land them on the dock.\nThe transfer began at 8 o’clock in the morning, Gen. Shafter coming\nout in person in his steam launch to see that his order was executed.\nBy 11 o’clock the guns, carriages, 30,000 rounds of ammunition, four\nsets of double harness, and the detachment were on board the lighter.\nThis had been accomplished a mile outside in the offing, with the\nvessel rolling and pitching in the trough of the sea and on the crest\nof the gigantic rollers in so violent a manner that it was almost\nimpossible for men to stand on their feet, much less handle such heavy\nmaterial as guns and ammunition. The lighter was warped to the pier at\n11 o’clock, and the general tied his steam launch alongside to see\nthat it was not disturbed until the debarkation was completed. At 1\no’clock everything was ashore, and, in compliance with the general’s\ninstructions, the best mules in the corral were taken, and as they\nwere led away from the corral-gate, a fat, sleek, black streaked,\nlong-eared specimen, which had been selected for a saddle-mule, set up\na cheerful “Aw! hee haw! haw!” which produced a burst of laughter and\ncheering from the members of the detachment and the soldiers in the\nvicinity. It was a cheerful omen. These Missouri mules were capable of\npulling anything loose at both ends, and four experienced drivers had\nbeen selected from the detachment who were capable of riding anything\nthat walked on four feet, or driving anything from an Arab courser to\na pair of Shetland ponies.",
        "Priv. J. Shiffer had been selected as corral boss of the detachment.\nThe most picturesque figure, the most boyish member, and as brave a\nsoldier as ever shouldered a musket; broad of shoulder, stout of limb,\nfull of joke, as cheerful as a ray of sunlight, this man was the\nincarnation of courage and devotion. He loved a mule. He was proud of\nthe job. With the instinct of a true teamster, he had snapped up the\nbest pair of mules in the whole corral and was out before the\ndetachment commander had selected a single mule. This team was as\nblack as Shiffer’s shoes and as strong as a pair of elephants. They\nwere worked harder than any other team in the 5th Army Corps, and when\nthey were turned in to the quartermaster in August, they were as fat,\nas sleek, as strong, and as hardy as on the day they were taken from\nthe corral in Baiquiri. The other three teamsters were like unto the\nfirst. They were all handy men. They were as capable of fighting or\naiming a gun as of driving a team. Any one of the four could take a\nteam of mules up a mountain-side or down a vertical precipice in\nperfect safety. They could do the impossible with a team of mules, and\nthey had to do it before the detachment reached the firing-line. The\nsuccess of the battery was to depend to a very large degree upon the\ncoolness, good judgment, and perfect bravery of these four teamsters.",
        "It should be noted that the use of mules was an experiment. The\n“scientific” branch of service has always held that the proper animal\nto draw a field-piece is the horse. They expatiate with great delight\nupon the almost human intelligence and sagacity of that noble animal;\nupon his courage “when he snuffeth the battle afar,” and upon the\nundaunted spirit with which he rushes upon the enemy, and assists his\nmaster to work the destruction of his foes. The Artillery claims that\nmules are entirely too stubborn, too cowardly, and too hard to manage\nfor the purpose of their arm of the service. It was also an experiment\nto use two mules per gun. The Engineer Department had reported that\nthe road to the front was impassable for wheeled vehicles, and even\nthe general had apparently thought that four mules per gun would be\nnecessary. The necessity of economizing mules, and the opinion of the\ndetachment commander that two mules per gun would be sufficient, had\nled to the issue of that number. Those who despise the army mule for\nthe purposes of field artillery know very little of the capacity of\nthis equine product of Missouri when properly handled. It was\ndemonstrated that two mules can pull a Gatling gun with 10,000 rounds\nof ammunition, loaded down with rations and forage, where eight horses\nare required to draw a field-piece; and that mules are equally as easy\nto manage under fire as horses.",
        "The landing was completed and the detachment organized at 3 p. m.,\nhaving rations, forage, and ammunition complete. There was no tentage,\nexcept the shelter-halves which some of the men had brought with them.\nCapt. Henry Marcotte, retired, the correspondent of the Army and Navy\nJournal, requested permission to accompany the detachment, which was\ngranted, and soon all were en route for the front, entrusted with\nthe task of opening the way for wheeled transportation and of\ndemonstrating the practicability of the road for army wagons and field\nartillery.",
        "For the first mile the road was excellent. It lay through one of the\nmost fertile parts of the most fertile island in the world. A little\nstream trickling along the side of the road furnished plenty of water\nfor both men and animals. At the end of the mile the detachment found\na steep hill to descend. The Ordnance Department, which designed and\nbuilt the carriage for the Gatling guns, had never foreseen the\nnecessity for a brake, and it was therefore necessary to cut down\nbushes from the roadside and fasten the rear wheels by placing a stout\npole between the spokes and over the trail of the piece. This locked\nthe wheels, and the guns were thus enabled to slide down the steep\nhill without danger of a runaway. From this point the road became a\nnarrow defile. The rank jungle closed in upon the trail, the long\nbarbed leaves of the Spanish bayonet hung across and lacerated the\nlegs of the mules until the blood trickled down to the hoofs; the\nboughs of the trees hung down over it so that even the men on foot had\nto stoop to pass under them, and the tortuous path winding in and out\namid the dense tropical undergrowth made it impossible to see in\nplaces more than twenty-five or thirty yards ahead at a time.",
        "The advance guard, consisting of all the members of one gun crew, had\nbeen organized at once upon starting, and this guard moved along the\nroad about two hundred and fifty yards in advance of the detachment,\nscouting every path vigilantly to the right and left, and keeping a\nconstant, careful lookout to the front. Their orders were, in case of\nencountering the enemy, to scatter in the underbrush, open fire with\nmagazines, so as to produce the impression upon the enemy that there\nwas a large force, and then slowly fall back upon the battery. The\nplan was, upon the first alarm, to bring the two leading guns into\nbattery upon the road, with the fourth gun ready to be opened to\neither flank, while the gun crew of the third gun, which formed the\nadvance guard, were to act as infantry support to the battery. It was\nhoped that the enemy would follow the advance guard as it retreated,\nand it was believed that the Gatling gun battery could take care of\ntwo or three regiments of Spaniards without help if necessary.",
        "This form for the march had been adopted as the result of mature\nreflection. The general had offered a cavalry escort of two troops,\nand Gen. Sumner had rather urged the use of an escort, but it was\ndesired to demonstrate that a battery of machine guns, properly manned\nand equipped, is capable of independent action, and does not need the\nassistance of either arm of the service. In fact, the Gatling gun men\nwould have been rather pleased than not to have had a brush with the\nenemy without the assistance of either infantry or cavalry. But it was\nnot to be.",
        "The march was continued until darkness fell over the landscape, and\nthe battery arrived at a beautiful camping-place about one mile east\nof Siboney, where a break in the water-pipe near the railroad track\ngave an ample supply of excellent water, and a ruined plantation, now\novergrown with luxuriant sugar-cane, provided ample forage for the\nmules. The two troops of cavalry, which had been offered and refused\nas an escort, had reached this camping-place some time before, so that\nthe wearied members of the detachment found pleasant camp-fires\nalready throwing their weird lights and shadows over the drooping\nbranches of the royal palm.",
        "Here, in the midst of the jungle, they pitched their first camp in\nCuba. The condition of the mules was duly looked to, their shoulders\nwashed down with strong salty water, their feet carefully examined,\nand the animals then tethered to graze their fill on the succulent\nsugar-cane, after having had a bountiful supply of oats. Meantime the\ncamp cooks had a kettle full of coffee simmering, and canned roast\nbeef warming over the fire, and after a hearty meal the tired men\nstretched themselves upon the ground, with no canopy except the stars\nand only one sentinel over the camp, and slept more soundly than they\nhad on board the tossing Cherokee.",
