        "Oliver told them the explanation of the whole affair that evening at\nhome, leaning back in his chair, with one arm bandaged and in a sling.",
        "They had not been able to get near him at the time; the excitement in\nthe square had been too fierce; but a messenger had come to his wife\nwith the news that her husband was only slightly wounded, and was in the\nhands of the doctors.",
        "“He was a Catholic,” explained the drawn-faced Oliver. “He must have\ncome ready, for his repeater was found loaded. Well, there was no chance\nfor a priest this time.”",
        "Mabel nodded slowly: she had read of the man’s fate on the placards.",
        "“He was killed–trampled and strangled instantly,” said Oliver. “I did\nwhat I could: you saw me. But–well, I dare say it was more merciful.”",
        "“But you did what you could, my dear?” said the old lady, anxiously,\nfrom her corner.",
        "“I called out to them, mother, but they wouldn’t hear me.”",
        "Mabel leaned forward–-",
        "“Oliver, I know this sounds stupid of me; but–but I wish they had not\nkilled him.”",
        "Oliver smiled at her. He knew this tender trait in her.",
        "“It would have been more perfect if they had not,” she said. Then she\nbroke off and sat back.",
        "“Why did he shoot just then?” she asked.",
        "Oliver turned his eyes for an instant towards his mother, but she was\nknitting tranquilly.",
        "Then he answered with a curious deliberateness.",
        "“I said that Braithwaite had done more for the world by one speech than\nJesus and all His saints put together.” He was aware that the\nknitting-needles stopped for a second; then they went on again as\nbefore.",
        "“But he must have meant to do it anyhow,” continued Oliver.",
        "“How do they know he was a Catholic?” asked the girl again.",
        "“There was a rosary on him; and then he just had time to call on his\nGod.”",
        "“And nothing more is known?”",
        "“Nothing more. He was well dressed, though.”",
        "Oliver leaned back a little wearily and closed his eyes; his arm still\nthrobbed intolerably. But he was very happy at heart. It was true that\nhe had been wounded by a fanatic, but he was not sorry to bear pain in\nsuch a cause, and it was obvious that the sympathy of England was with\nhim. Mr. Phillips even now was busy in the next room, answering the\ntelegrams that poured in every moment. Caldecott, the Prime Minister,\nMaxwell, Snowford and a dozen others had wired instantly their\ncongratulations, and from every part of England streamed in message\nafter message. It was an immense stroke for the Communists; their\nspokesman had been assaulted during the discharge of his duty, speaking\nin defence of his principles; it was an incalculable gain for them, and\nloss for the Individualists, that confessors were not all on one side\nafter all. The huge electric placards over London had winked out the\nfacts in Esperanto as Oliver stepped into the train at twilight.",
        "“_Oliver Brand wounded.... Catholic assailant.... Indignation of the\ncountry.... Well-deserved fate of assassin.”",
        "He was pleased, too, that he honestly had done his best to save the man.\nEven in that moment of sudden and acute pain he had cried out for a fair\ntrial; but he had been too late. He had seen the starting eyes roll up\nin the crimson face, and the horrid grin come and go as the hands had\nclutched and torn at his throat. Then the face had vanished and a heavy\ntrampling began where it had disappeared. Oh! there was some passion and\nloyalty left in England!",
        "His mother got up presently and went out, still without a word; and\nMabel turned to him, laying a hand on his knee.",
        "“Are you too tired to talk, my dear?”",
        "He opened his eyes.",
        "“Of course not, my darling. What is it?”",
        "“What do you think will be the effect?”",
        "He raised himself a little, looking out as usual through the darkening\nwindows on to that astonishing view. Everywhere now lights were\nglowing, a sea of mellow moons just above the houses, and above the\nmysterious heavy blue of a summer evening.",
        "“The effect?” he said. “It can be nothing but good. It was time that\nsomething happened. My dear, I feel very downcast sometimes, as you\nknow. Well, I do not think I shall be again. I have been afraid\nsometimes that we were losing all our spirit, and that the old Tories\nwere partly right when they prophesied what Communism would do. But\nafter this–-”",
        "“Well?”",
        "“Well; we have shown that we can shed our blood too. It is in the nick\nof time, too, just at the crisis. I don’t want to exaggerate; it is only\na scratch–but it was so deliberate, and–and so dramatic. The poor\ndevil could not have chosen a worse moment. People won’t forget it.”",
        "Mabel’s eyes shone with pleasure.",
        "“You poor dear!” she said. “Are you in pain?”",
        "“Not much. Besides, Christ! what do I care? If only this infernal\nEastern affair would end!”",
        "He knew he was feverish and irritable, and made a great effort to drive\nit down.",
        "“Oh, my dear!” he went on, flushed a little. “If they would not be such\nheavy fools: they don’t understand; they don’t understand.”",
        "“Yes, Oliver?”",
        "“They don’t understand what a glorious thing it all is Humanity, Life,\nTruth at last, and the death of Folly! But haven’t I told them a hundred\ntimes?”",
        "She looked at him with kindling eyes. She loved to see him like this,\nhis confident, flushed face, the enthusiasm in his blue eyes; and the\nknowledge of his pain pricked her feeling with passion. She bent forward\nand kissed him suddenly.",
        "“My dear, I am so proud of you. Oh, Oliver!”",
        "He said nothing; but she could see what she loved to see, that response\nto her own heart; and so they sat in silence while the sky darkened yet\nmore, and the click of the writer in the next room told them that the\nworld was alive and that they had a share in its affairs.",
        "Oliver stirred presently.",
        "“Did you notice anything just now, sweetheart–when I said that about\nJesus Christ?”",
        "“She stopped knitting for a moment,” said the girl.",
        "He nodded.",
        "“You saw that too, then.... Mabel, do you think she is falling back?”",
        "“Oh! she is getting old,” said the girl lightly. “Of course she looks\nback a little.”",
        "“But you don’t think–it would be too awful!”",
        "She shook her head.",
        "“No, no, my dear; you’re excited and tired. It’s just a little\nsentiment.... Oliver, I don’t think I would say that kind of thing\nbefore her.”",
        "“But she hears it everywhere now.”",
        "“No, she doesn’t. Remember she hardly ever goes out. Besides, she hates\nit. After all, she was brought up a Catholic.”",
        "Oliver nodded, and lay back again, looking dreamily out.",
        "“Isn’t it astonishing the way in which suggestion lasts? She can’t get\nit out of her head, even after fifty years. Well, watch her, won’t\nyou?... By the way ...”",
        "“Yes?”",
        "“There’s a little more news from the East. They say Felsenburgh’s\nrunning the whole thing now. The Empire is sending him everywhere–\nTobolsk, Benares, Yakutsk–everywhere; and he’s been to Australia.”",
        "Mabel sat up briskly.",
        "“Isn’t that very hopeful?”",
        "“I suppose so. There’s no doubt that the Sufis are winning; but for how\nlong is another question. Besides, the troops don’t disperse.”",
        "“And Europe?”",
        "“Europe is arming as fast as possible. I hear we are to meet the Powers\nnext week at Paris. I must go.”",
        "“Your arm, my dear?”",
        "“My arm must get well. It will have to go with me, anyhow.”",
        "“Tell me some more.”",
        "“There is no more. But it is just as certain as it can be that this is\nthe crisis. If the East can be persuaded to hold its hand now, it will\nnever be likely to raise it again. It will mean free trade all over the\nworld, I suppose, and all that kind of thing. But if not–-”",
        "“Well?”",
        "“If not, there will be a catastrophe such as never has been even\nimagined. The whole human race will be at war, and either East or West\nwill be simply wiped out. These new Benninschein explosives will make\ncertain of that.”",
        "“But is it absolutely certain that the East has got them?”",
        "“Absolutely. Benninschein sold them simultaneously to East and West;\nthen he died, luckily for him.”",
        "Mabel had heard this kind of talk before, but her imagination simply\nrefused to grasp it. A duel of East and West under these new conditions\nwas an unthinkable thing. There had been no European war within living\nmemory, and the Eastern wars of the last century had been under the old\nconditions. Now, if tales were true, entire towns would be destroyed\nwith a single shell. The new conditions were unimaginable. Military\nexperts prophesied extravagantly, contradicting one another on vital\npoints; the whole procedure of war was a matter of theory; there were no\nprecedents with which to compare it. It was as if archers disputed as to\nthe results of cordite. Only one thing was certain–that the East had\nevery modern engine, and, as regards male population, half as much\nagain as the rest of the world put together; and the conclusion to be\ndrawn from these premisses was not reassuring to England.",
        "But imagination simply refused to speak. The daily papers had a short,\ncareful leading article every day, founded upon the scraps of news that\nstole out from the conferences on the other side of the world;\nFelsenburgh’s name appeared more frequently than ever: otherwise there\nseemed to be a kind of hush. Nothing suffered very much; trade went on;\nEuropean stocks were not appreciably lower than usual; men still built\nhouses, married wives, begat sons and daughters, did their business and\nwent to the theatre, for the mere reason that there was no good in\nanything else. They could neither save nor precipitate the situation; it\nwas on too large a scale. Occasionally people went mad–people who had\nsucceeded in goading their imagination to a height whence a glimpse of\nreality could be obtained; and there was a diffused atmosphere of\ntenseness. But that was all. Not many speeches were made on the subject;\nit had been found inadvisable. After all, there was nothing to do but to\nwait.",
