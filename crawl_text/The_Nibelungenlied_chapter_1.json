        "This translation of the Nibelungenlied is published with the simple\npurpose of placing one of the worldâ€™s great epic poems within the reach\nof English readers. Translations are at best but poor substitutes for\noriginals. A new translation of a poem implies also a criticism of those\nthat have preceded it. My apology for presenting this new English version\nof the Nibelungenlied is that none of those hitherto made has reproduced\nthe metrical form of the original. In the hope of making the outlines of\nthe poem clearer for the modern reader, I have endeavored to supply in\nthe Introduction a historical background by summing up the results of\ninvestigation into its origin and growth. The translation itself was\nbegun many years ago, when I studied the original under Zarncke in\nLeipzig.",
