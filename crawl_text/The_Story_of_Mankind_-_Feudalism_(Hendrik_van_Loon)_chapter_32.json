        "HOW CENTRAL EUROPE, ATTACKED FROM\nTHREE SIDES, BECAME AN ARMED CAMP\nAND WHY EUROPE WOULD HAVE PERISHED\nWITHOUT THOSE PROFESSIONAL\nSOLDIERS AND ADMINISTRATORS WHO\nWERE PART OF THE FEUDAL SYSTEM",
        "THE following, then, is the state of Europe in the year one\nthousand, when most people were so unhappy that they welcomed\nthe prophecy foretelling the approaching end of the\nworld and rushed to the monasteries, that the Day of Judgement\nmight find them engaged upon devout duties.",
        "At an unknown date, the Germanic tribes had left their old\nhome in Asia and had moved westward into Europe. By\nsheer pressure of numbers they had forced their way into the\nRoman Empire. They had destroyed the great western empire,\nbut the eastern part, being off the main route of the\ngreat migrations, had managed to survive and feebly continued\nthe traditions of Rome’s ancient glory.",
        "During the days of disorder which had followed, (the true\n“dark ages” of history, the sixth and seventh centuries of our\nera,) the German tribes had been persuaded to accept the\nChristian religion and had recognised the Bishop of Rome\nas the Pope or spiritual head of the world. In the ninth century,\nthe organising genius of Charlemagne had revived the\nRoman Empire and had united the greater part of western\nEurope into a single state. During the tenth century this\nempire had gone to pieces. The western part had become a\nseparate kingdom, France. The eastern half was known as the\nHoly Roman Empire of the German nation, and the rulers of\nthis federation of states then pretended that they were the\ndirect heirs of Caesar and Augustus.",
        "Unfortunately the power of the kings of France did not\nstretch beyond the moat of their royal residence, while the\nHoly Roman Emperor was openly defied by his powerful\nsubjects whenever it suited their fancy or their profit.",
        "To increase the misery of the masses of the people, the\ntriangle of western Europe (look at page 128, please) was for ever\nexposed to attacks from three sides. On the south lived the\never dangerous Mohammedans. The western coast was ravaged\nby the Northmen. The eastern frontier (defenceless except\nfor the short stretch of the Carpathian mountains) was at\nthe mercy of hordes of Huns, Hungarians, Slavs and Tartars.",
        "The peace of Rome was a thing of the remote past, a dream\nof the “Good Old Days” that were gone for ever. It was a\nquestion of “fight or die,” and quite naturally people preferred\nto fight. Forced by circumstances, Europe became an armed\ncamp and there was a demand for strong leadership. Both\nKing and Emperor were far away. The frontiersmen (and\nmost of Europe in the year 1000 was “frontier”) must help\nthemselves. They willingly submitted to the representatives\nof the king who were sent to administer the outlying districts,\nPROVIDED THEY COULD PROTECT THEM AGAINST THEIR ENEMIES.",
        "Soon central Europe was dotted with small principalities,\neach one ruled by a duke or a count or a baron or a bishop, as\nthe case might be, and organised as a fighting unit. These\ndukes and counts and barons had sworn to be faithful to the\nking who had given them their “feudum” (hence our word\n“feudal,”) in return for their loyal services and a certain\namount of taxes. But travel in those days was slow and the\nmeans of communication were exceedingly poor. The royal\nor imperial administrators therefore enjoyed great independence,\nand within the boundaries of their own province they\nassumed most of the rights which in truth belonged to the king.",
        "But you would make a mistake if you supposed that the\npeople of the eleventh century objected to this form of\ngovernment. They supported Feudalism because it was a very\npractical and necessary institution. Their Lord and Master\nusually lived in a big stone house erected on the top of a steep\nrock or built between deep moats, but within sight of his\nsubjects. In case of danger the subjects found shelter behind\nthe walls of the baronial stronghold. That is why they tried\nto live as near the castle as possible and it accounts for the\nmany European cities which began their career around a feudal\nfortress.",
        "But the knight of the early middle ages was much more\nthan a professional soldier. He was the civil servant of that\nday. He was the judge of his community and he was the\nchief of police. He caught the highwaymen and protected\nthe wandering pedlars who were the merchants of the eleventh\ncentury. He looked after the dikes so that the countryside\nshould not be flooded (just as the first noblemen had done\nin the valley of the Nile four thousand years before). He\nencouraged the Troubadours who wandered from place to place\ntelling the stories of the ancient heroes who had fought in the\ngreat wars of the migrations. Besides, he protected the churches\nand the monasteries within his territory, and although he could\nneither read nor write, (it was considered unmanly to know\nsuch things,) he employed a number of priests who kept his\naccounts and who registered the marriages and the births and\nthe deaths which occurred within the baronial or ducal domains.",
        "In the fifteenth century the kings once more became strong\nenough to exercise those powers which belonged to them because\nthey were “anointed of God.” Then the feudal knights lost\ntheir former independence. Reduced to the rank of country\nsquires, they no longer filled a need and soon they became a\nnuisance. But Europe would have perished without the “feudal\nsystem” of the dark ages. There were many bad knights\nas there are many bad people to-day. But generally speaking,\nthe rough-fisted barons of the twelfth and thirteenth century\nwere hard-working administrators who rendered a most useful\nservice to the cause of progress. During that era the noble\ntorch of learning and art which had illuminated the world of\nthe Egyptians and the Greeks and the Romans was burning\nvery low. Without the knights and their good friends, the\nmonks, civilisation would have been extinguished entirely, and\nthe human race would have been forced to begin once more\nwhere the cave-man had left off.",
