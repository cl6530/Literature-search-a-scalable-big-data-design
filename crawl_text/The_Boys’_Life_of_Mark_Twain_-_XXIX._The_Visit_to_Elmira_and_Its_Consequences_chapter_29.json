        "Samuel Clemens now decided to pay his long-deferred visit to the Langdon\nhome in Elmira.  Through Charlie Langdon he got the invitation renewed,\nand for a glorious week enjoyed the generous hospitality of the beautiful\nLangdon home and the society of fair Olivia Langdon–Livy, as they called\nher–realizing more and more that for him there could never be any other\nwoman in the world.  He spoke no word of this to her, but on the morning\nof the day when his visit would end he relieved himself to Charlie\nLangdon, much to the young man’s alarm.  Greatly as he admired Mark Twain\nhimself, he did not think him, or, indeed, any man, good enough for\n“Livy,” whom he considered little short of a saint.  Clemens was to take\na train that evening, but young Langdon said, when he recovered:",
        "“Look here, Clemens, there’s a train in half an hour.  I’ll help you\ncatch it.  Don’t wait until tonight; go now!”",
        "Mark Twain shook his head.",
        "“No, Charlie,” he said, in his gentle drawl.  “I want to enjoy your\nhospitality a little longer.  I promise to be circumspect, and I’ll go\nto-night.”",
        "That night after dinner, when it was time to take the train, a light two-\nseated wagon was at the gate.  Young Langdon and his guest took the back\nseat, which, for some reason, had not been locked in its place.  The\nhorse started with a quick forward spring, and the seat with its two\noccupants described a circle and landed with force on the cobbled street.",
        "Neither passenger was seriously hurt–only dazed a little for the moment.\nBut to Mark Twain there came a sudden inspiration.  Here was a chance to\nprolong his visit.  When the Langdon household gathered with\nrestoratives, he did not recover at once, and allowed himself to be\nsupported to an arm-chair for further remedies.  Livy Langdon showed\nespecial anxiety.",
        "He was not allowed to go, now, of course; he must stay until it was\ncertain that his recovery was complete.  Perhaps he had been internally\ninjured.  His visit was prolonged two weeks, two weeks of pure happiness,\nand when he went away he had fully resolved to win Livy Langdon for his\nwife.",
        "Mark Twain now went to Hartford to look after his book proofs, and there\nfor the first time met the Rev. Joseph H. Twichell, who would become his\nclosest friend.  The two men, so different in many ways, always had the\nfondest admiration for each other; each recognized in the other great\ncourage, humanity, and sympathy.  Clemens would gladly have remained in\nHartford that winter.  Twichell presented him to many congenial people,\nincluding Charles Dudley Warner, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and other writing\nfolk.  But flattering lecture offers were made him, and he could no\nlonger refuse.",
        "He called his new lecture “The Vandal Abroad,” it being chapters from the\nforthcoming book, and it was a great success everywhere.  His houses were\ncrowded; the newspapers were enthusiastic.  His delivery was described as\na “long, monotonous drawl, with fun invariably coming in at the end of a\nsentence–after a pause.”  He began to be recognized everywhere–to have\ngreat popularity.  People came out on the street to see him pass.",
        "Many of his lecture engagements were in central New York, no great\ndistance from Elmira.  He had a standing invitation to visit the Langdon\nhome, and went when he could.  His courtship, however, was not entirely\nsmooth.  Much as Mr. Langdon honored his gifts and admired him\npersonally, he feared that his daughter, who had known so little of life\nand the outside world, and the brilliant traveler, lecturer, author,\nmight not find happiness in marriage.  Many absurd stories have been told\nof Mark Twain’s first interview with Jervis Langdon on this subject, but\nthese are without foundation.  It was an earnest discussion on both\nsides, and left Samuel Clemens rather crestfallen, though not without\nhope.  More than once the subject was discussed between the two men that\nwinter as the lecturer came and went, his fame always growing.  In time\nthe Langdon household had grown to feel that he belonged to them.  It\nwould be only a step further to make him really one of the family.",
        "There was no positive engagement at first, for it was agreed between\nClemens and Jervis Langdon that letters should be sent by Mr. Langdon to\nthose who had known his would-be son-in-law earlier, with inquiries as to\nhis past conduct and general character.  It was a good while till answers\nto these came, and when they arrived Samuel Clemens was on hand to learn\nthe result.  Mr. Langdon had a rather solemn look when they were alone\ntogether.",
        "Clemens asked, “You’ve heard from those gentlemen out there?”",
        "“Yes, and from another gentlemen I wrote to concerning you.”",
        "“They don’t appear to have been very enthusiastic, from your manner.”",
        "“Well, yes, some of them were.”",
        "“I suppose I may ask what particular form their emotion took.”",
        "“Oh, yes, yes; they agree unanimously that you are a brilliant, able man-\n-a man with a future, and that you would make about the worst husband on\nrecord.”",
        "The applicant had a forlorn look.  “There is nothing very evasive about\nthat,” he said.",
        "Langdon reflected.",
        "“Haven’t you any other friend that you could suggest?”",
        "“Apparently none whose testimony would be valuable.”",
        "Jervis Langdon held out his hand.",
        "“You have at least one,” he said. “I believe in you.  I know you better\nthen they do.”",
        "The engagement of Samuel Langhorne Clemens and Olivia Lewis Langdon was\nratified next day, February 4, 1869.  To Jane Clemens her son wrote:\n“She is a little body, but she hasn’t her peer in Christendom.”",
