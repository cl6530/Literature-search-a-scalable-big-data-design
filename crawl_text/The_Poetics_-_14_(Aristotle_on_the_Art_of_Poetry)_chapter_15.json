        "\nThe tragic fear and pity may be aroused by the Spectacle; but they may\nalso be aroused by the very structure and incidents of the play—which\nis the better way and shows the better poet. The Plot in fact should\nbe so framed that, even without seeing the things take place, he who\nsimply hears the account of them shall be filled with horror and pity\nat the incidents; which is just the effect that the mere recital of\nthe story in Oedipus would have on one. To produce this same effect\nby means of the Spectacle is less artistic, and requires extraneous\naid.  Those, however, who make use of the Spectacle to put before us\nthat which is merely monstrous and not productive of fear, are wholly\nout of touch with Tragedy; not every kind of pleasure should be\nrequired of a tragedy, but only its own proper pleasure.",
        "The tragic pleasure is that of pity and fear, and the poet has to\nproduce it by a work of imitation; it is clear, therefore, that the\ncauses should be included in the incidents of his story. Let us see,\nthen, what kinds of incident strike one as horrible, or rather as\npiteous. In a deed of this description the parties must necessarily be\neither friends, or enemies, or indifferent to one another. Now when\nenemy does it on enemy, there is nothing to move us to pity either in\nhis doing or in his meditating the deed, except so far as the actual\npain of the sufferer is concerned; and the same is true when the\nparties are indifferent to one another. Whenever the tragic deed,\nhowever, is done within the family—when murder or the like is done or\nmeditated by brother on brother, by son on father, by mother on son,\nor son on mother—these are the situations the poet should seek after.\nThe traditional stories, accordingly, must be kept as they are, e.g.\nthe murder of Clytaemnestra by Orestes and of Eriphyle by Alcmeon. At\nthe same time even with these there is something left to the poet\nhimself; it is for him to devise the right way of treating them. Let\nus explain more clearly what we mean by ’the right way’. The deed of\nhorror may be done by the doer knowingly and consciously, as in the\nold poets, and in Medea’s murder of her children in Euripides. Or he\nmay do it, but in ignorance of his relationship, and discover that\nafterwards, as does the Oedipus in Sophocles. Here the deed is\noutside the play; but it may be within it, like the act of the Alcmeon\nin Astydamas, or that of the Telegonus in Ulysses Wounded. A third\npossibility is for one meditating some deadly injury to another, in\nignorance of his relationship, to make the discovery in time to draw\nback. These exhaust the possibilities, since the deed must necessarily\nbe either done or not done, and either knowingly or unknowingly.",
        "The worst situation is when the personage is with full knowledge on\nthe point of doing the deed, and leaves it undone. It is odious and\nalso (through the absence of suffering) untragic; hence it is that no\none is made to act thus except in some few instances, e.g. Haemon and\nCreon in Antigone. Next after this comes the actual perpetration of\nthe deed meditated. A better situation than that, however, is for the\ndeed to be done in ignorance, and the relationship discovered\nafterwards, since there is nothing odious in it, and the Discovery\nwill serve to astound us. But the best of all is the last; what we\nhave in Cresphontes, for example, where Merope, on the point of\nslaying her son, recognizes him in time; in Iphigenia, where sister\nand brother are in a like position; and in Helle, where the son\nrecognizes his mother, when on the point of giving her up to her\nenemy.",
        "This will explain why our tragedies are restricted (as we said just\nnow) to such a small number of families. It was accident rather than\nart that led the poets in quest of subjects to embody this kind of\nincident in their Plots. They are still obliged, accordingly, to have\nrecourse to the families in which such horrors have occurred.",
        "On the construction of the Plot, and the kind of Plot required for\nTragedy, enough has now been said.",
