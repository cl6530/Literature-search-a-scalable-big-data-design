        "Genealogy of the Princes of Wales",
        "The following is the generation of princes of South Wales:  Rhys,\nson of Gruffydd; Gruffydd, son of Rhys; Rhys, son of Tewdwr;\nTewdwr, son of Eineon; Eineon, son of Owen; Owen, son of Howel Dda,\nor Howel the Good; Howel, son of Cadell, son of Roderic the Great.\nThus the princes of South Wales derived their origin from Cadell,\nson of Roderic the Great.  The princes of North Wales descended\nfrom Mervin in this manner:  Llewelyn, son of Iorwerth; Iorwerth,\nson of Owen; Owen, son of Gruffydd; Gruffydd, son of Conan; Conan,\nson of Iago; Iago, son of Edoual; Edoual, son of Meyric; Meyric,\nson of Anarawt (Anandhrec); Anarawt, son of Mervin, son of Roderic\nthe Great.  Anarawt leaving no issue, the princes of Powys have\ntheir own particular descent.",
        "It is worthy of remark, that the Welsh bards and singers, or\nreciters, have the genealogies of the aforesaid princes, written in\nthe Welsh language, in their ancient and authentic books; and also\nretain them in their memory from Roderic the Great to B.M.; (8) and\nfrom thence to Sylvius, Ascanius, and AEneas; and from the latter\nproduce the genealogical series in a lineal descent, even to Adam.",
        "But as an account of such long and remote genealogies may appear to\nmany persons trifling rather than historical, we have purposely\nomitted them in our compendium.",
