        "In the heat of the glowing July afternoon, the room, with blinds\ncarefully closed, was full of a great calm. From the three windows,\nthrough the cracks of the old wooden shutters, came only a few\nscattered sunbeams which, in the midst of the obscurity, made a soft\nbrightness that bathed surrounding objects in a diffused and tender\nlight. It was cool here in comparison with the overpowering heat that\nwas felt outside, under the fierce rays of the sun that blazed upon\nthe front of the house.",
        "Standing before the press which faced the windows, Dr. Pascal was\nlooking for a paper that he had come in search of. With doors wide\nopen, this immense press of carved oak, adorned with strong and\nhandsome mountings of metal, dating from the last century, displayed\nwithin its capacious depths an extraordinary collection of papers and\nmanuscripts of all sorts, piled up in confusion and filling every\nshelf to overflowing. For more than thirty years the doctor had thrown\ninto it every page he wrote, from brief notes to the complete texts of\nhis great works on heredity. Thus it was that his searches here were\nnot always easy. He rummaged patiently among the papers, and when he\nat last found the one he was looking for, he smiled.",
        "For an instant longer he remained near the bookcase, reading the note\nby a golden sunbeam that came to him from the middle window. He\nhimself, in this dawnlike light, appeared, with his snow-white hair\nand beard, strong and vigorous; although he was near sixty, his color\nwas so fresh, his features were so finely cut, his eyes were still so\nclear, and he had so youthful an air that one might have taken him, in\nhis close-fitting, maroon velvet jacket, for a young man with powdered\nhair.",
        "“Here, Clotilde,” he said at last, “you will copy this note. Ramond\nwould never be able to decipher my diabolical writing.”",
        "And he crossed the room and laid the paper beside the young girl, who\nstood working at a high desk in the embrasure of the window to the\nright.",
        "“Very well, master,” she answered.",
        "She did not even turn round, so engrossed was her attention with the\npastel which she was at the moment rapidly sketching in with broad\nstrokes of the crayon. Near her in a vase bloomed a stalk of\nhollyhocks of a singular shade of violet, striped with yellow. But the\nprofile of her small round head, with its short, fair hair, was\nclearly distinguishable; an exquisite and serious profile, the\nstraight forehead contracted in a frown of attention, the eyes of an\nazure blue, the nose delicately molded, the chin firm. Her bent neck,\nespecially, of a milky whiteness, looked adorably youthful under the\ngold of the clustering curls. In her long black blouse she seemed very\ntall, with her slight figure, slender throat, and flexible form, the\nflexible slenderness of the divine figures of the Renaissance. In\nspite of her twenty-five years, she still retained a childlike air and\nlooked hardly eighteen.",
        "“And,” resumed the doctor, “you will arrange the press a little.\nNothing can be found there any longer.”",
        "“Very well, master,” she repeated, without raising her head;\n\"presently.”",
        "Pascal had turned round to seat himself at his desk, at the other end\nof the room, before the window to the left. It was a plain black\nwooden table, and was littered also with papers and pamphlets of all\nsorts. And silence again reigned in the peaceful semi-obscurity,\ncontrasting with the overpowering glare outside. The vast apartment, a\ndozen meters long and six wide, had, in addition to the press, only\ntwo bookcases, filled with books. Antique chairs of various kinds\nstood around in disorder, while for sole adornment, along the walls,\nhung with an old salon Empire paper of a rose pattern, were nailed\npastels of flowers of strange coloring dimly visible. The woodwork of\nthree folding-doors, the door opening on the hall and two others at\nopposite ends of the apartment, the one leading to the doctor’s room,\nthe other to that of the young girl, as well as the cornice of the\nsmoke-darkened ceiling, dated from the time of Louis XV.",
        "An hour passed without a sound, without a breath. Then Pascal, who, as\na diversion from his work, had opened a newspaper–Le Temps–which\nhad lain forgotten on the table, uttered a slight exclamation:",
        "“Why! your father has been appointed editor of the Epoque, the\nprosperous republican journal which has the publishing of the papers\nof the Tuileries.”",
        "This news must have been unexpected by him, for he laughed frankly, at\nonce pleased and saddened, and in an undertone he continued:",
        "“My word! If things had been invented, they could not have been finer.\nLife is a strange thing. This is a very interesting article.”",
        "Clotilde made no answer, as if her thoughts were a hundred leagues\naway from what her uncle was saying. And he did not speak again, but\ntaking his scissors after he had read the article, he cut it out and\npasted it on a sheet of paper, on which he made some marginal notes in\nhis large, irregular handwriting. Then he went back to the press to\nclassify this new document in it. But he was obliged to take a chair,\nthe shelf being so high that he could not reach it notwithstanding his\ntall stature.",
        "On this high shelf a whole series of enormous bundles of papers were\narranged in order, methodically classified. Here were papers of all\nsorts: sheets of manuscript, documents on stamped paper, articles cut\nout of newspapers, arranged in envelopes of strong blue paper, each of\nwhich bore on the outside a name written in large characters. One felt\nthat these documents were tenderly kept in view, taken out\ncontinually, and carefully replaced; for of the whole press, this\ncorner was the only one kept in order.",
        "When Pascal, mounted on the chair, had found the package he was\nlooking for, one of the bulkiest of the envelopes, on which was\nwritten the name “Saccard,” he added to it the new document, and then\nreplaced the whole under its corresponding alphabetical letter. A\nmoment later he had forgotten the subject, and was complacently\nstraightening a pile of papers that were falling down. And when he at\nlast jumped down off the chair, he said:",
        "“When you are arranging the press, Clotilde, don’t touch the packages\nat the top; do you hear?”",
        "“Very well, master,” she responded, for the third time, docilely.",
        "He laughed again, with the gaiety that was natural to him.",
        "“That is forbidden.”",
        "“I know it, master.”",
        "And he closed the press with a vigorous turn of the key, which he then\nthrew into a drawer of his writing table. The young girl was\nsufficiently acquainted with his researches to keep his manuscripts in\nsome degree of order; and he gladly employed her as his secretary; he\nmade her copy his notes when some confrere and friend, like Dr.\nRamond asked him to send him some document. But she was not a\nsavante; he simply forbade her to read what he deemed it useless\nthat she should know.",
        "At last, perceiving her so completely absorbed in her work, his\nattention was aroused.",
        "“What is the matter with you, that you don’t open your lips?” he said.\n\"Are you so taken up with the copying of those flowers that you can’t\nspeak?”",
        "This was another of the labors which he often intrusted to her–to\nmake drawings, aquarelles, and pastels, which he afterward used in his\nworks as plates. Thus, for the past five years he had been making some\ncurious experiments on a collection of hollyhocks; he had obtained a\nwhole series of new colorings by artificial fecundations. She made\nthese sorts of copies with extraordinary minuteness, an exactitude of\ndesign and of coloring so extreme that he marveled unceasingly at the\nconscientiousness of her work, and he often told her that she had a\n\"good, round, strong, clear little headpiece.”",
        "But, this time, when he approached her to look over her shoulder, he\nuttered a cry of comic fury.",
        "“There you are at your nonsense! Now you are off in the clouds again!\nWill you do me the favor to tear that up at once?”",
        "She straightened herself, her cheeks flushed, her eyes aglow with the\ndelight she took in her work, her slender fingers stained with the red\nand blue crayon that she had crushed.",
        "“Oh, master!”",
        "And in this “master,” so tender, so caressingly submissive, this term\nof complete abandonment by which she called him, in order to avoid\nusing the words godfather or uncle, which she thought silly, there\nwas, for the first time, a passionate accent of revolt, the\nrevindication of a being recovering possession of and asserting\nitself.",
        "For nearly two hours she had been zealously striving to produce an\nexact and faithful copy of the hollyhocks, and she had just thrown on\nanother sheet a whole bunch of imaginary flowers, of dream-flowers,\nextravagant and superb. She had, at times, these abrupt shiftings, a\nneed of breaking away in wild fancies in the midst of the most precise\nof reproductions. She satisfied it at once, falling always into this\nextraordinary efflorescence of such spirit and fancy that it never\nrepeated itself; creating roses, with bleeding hearts, weeping tears\nof sulphur, lilies like crystal urns, flowers without any known form,\neven, spreading out starry rays, with corollas floating like clouds.\nTo-day, on a groundwork dashed in with a few bold strokes of black\ncrayon, it was a rain of pale stars, a whole shower of infinitely soft\npetals; while, in a corner, an unknown bloom, a bud, chastely veiled,\nwas opening.",
        "“Another to nail there!” resumed the doctor, pointing to the wall, on\nwhich there was already a row of strangely curious pastels. “But what\nmay that represent, I ask you?”",
        "She remained very grave, drawing back a step, the better to\ncontemplate her work.",
        "“I know nothing about it; it is beautiful.”",
        "At this moment appeared Martine, the only servant, become the real\nmistress of the house, after nearly thirty years of service with the\ndoctor. Although she had passed her sixtieth year, she, too, still\nretained a youthful air as she went about, silent and active, in her\neternal black gown and white cap that gave her the look of a nun, with\nher small, white, calm face, and lusterless eyes, the light in which\nseemed to have been extinguished.",
        "Without speaking, she went and sat down on the floor before an\neasy-chair, through a rent in the old covering of which the hair was\nescaping, and drawing from her pocket a needle and a skein of worsted,\nshe set to work to mend it. For three days past she had been waiting\nfor an hour’s time to do this piece of mending, which haunted her.",
        "“While you are about it, Martine,” said Pascal jestingly, taking\nbetween both his hands the mutinous head of Clotilde, “sew me fast,\ntoo, this little noodle, which sometimes wanders off into the clouds.”",
        "Martine raised her pale eyes, and looked at her master with her\nhabitual air of adoration?”",
        "“Why does monsieur say that?”",
        "“Because, my good girl, in very truth, I believe it is you who have\nstuffed this good little round, clear, strong headpiece full of\nnotions of the other world, with all your devoutness.”",
        "The two women exchanged a glance of intelligence.",
        "“Oh, monsieur! religion has never done any harm to any one. And when\npeople have not the same ideas, it is certainly better not to talk\nabout them.”",
        "An embarrassed silence followed; this was the one difference of\nopinion which, at times, brought about disagreements among these three\nunited beings who led so restricted a life. Martine was only\ntwenty-nine, a year older than the doctor, when she entered his house,\nat the time when he made his debut as a physician at Plassans, in a\nbright little house of the new town. And thirteen years later, when\nSaccard, a brother of Pascal, sent him his daughter Clotilde, aged\nseven, after his wife’s death and at the moment when he was about to\nmarry again, it was she who brought up the child, taking it to church,\nand communicating to it a little of the devout flame with which she\nhad always burned; while the doctor, who had a broad mind, left them\nto their joy of believing, for he did not feel that he had the right\nto interdict to any one the happiness of faith; he contented himself\nlater on with watching over the young girl’s education and giving her\nclear and sound ideas about everything. For thirteen years, during\nwhich the three had lived this retired life at La Souleiade, a small\nproperty situated in the outskirts of the town, a quarter of an hour’s\nwalk from St. Saturnin, the cathedral, his life had flowed happily\nalong, occupied in secret great works, a little troubled, however, by\nan ever increasing uneasiness–the collision, more and more violent,\nevery day, between their beliefs.",
        "Pascal took a few turns gloomily up and down the room. Then, like a\nman who did not mince his words, he said:",
        "“See, my dear, all this phantasmagoria of mystery has turned your\npretty head. Your good God had no need of you; I should have kept you\nfor myself alone; and you would have been all the better for it.”",
        "But Clotilde, trembling with excitement, her clear eyes fixed boldly\nupon his, held her ground.",
        "“It is you, master, who would be all the better, if you did not shut\nyourself up in your eyes of flesh. That is another thing, why do you\nnot wish to see?”",
        "And Martine came to her assistance, in her own style.",
        "“Indeed, it is true, monsieur, that you, who are a saint, as I say\neverywhere, should accompany us to church. Assuredly, God will save\nyou. But at the bare idea that you should not go straight to paradise,\nI tremble all over.”",
        "He paused, for he had before him, in open revolt, those two whom he\nhad been accustomed to see submissive at his feet, with the tenderness\nof women won over by his gaiety and his goodness. Already he opened\nhis mouth, and was going to answer roughly, when the uselessness of\nthe discussion became apparent to him.",
        "“There! Let us have peace. I would do better to go and work. And above\nall, let no one interrupt me!”",
        "With hasty steps he gained his chamber, where he had installed a sort\nof laboratory, and shut himself up in it. The prohibition to enter it\nwas formal. It was here that he gave himself up to special\npreparations, of which he spoke to no one. Almost immediately the slow\nand regular sound of a pestle grinding in a mortar was heard.",
        "“Come,” said Clotilde, smiling, “there he is, at his devil’s cookery,\nas grandmother says.”",
        "And she tranquilly resumed her copying of the hollyhocks. She\ncompleted the drawing with mathematical precision, she found the exact\ntone of the violet petals, striped with yellow, even to the most\ndelicate discoloration of the shades.",
        "“Ah!” murmured Martine, after a moment, again seated on the ground,\nand occupied in mending the chair, “what a misfortune for a good man\nlike that to lose his soul wilfully. For there is no denying it; I\nhave known him now for thirty years, and in all that time he has never\nso much as spoken an unkind word to any one. A real heart of gold, who\nwould take the bit from his own mouth. And handsome, too, and always\nwell, and always gay, a real blessing! It is a murder that he does not\nwish to make his peace with the good God. We will force him to do it,\nmademoiselle, will we not?”",
        "Clotilde, surprised at hearing her speak so long at one time on the\nsubject, gave her word with a grave air.",
        "“Certainly, Martine, it is a promise. We will force him.”",
        "Silence reigned again, broken a moment afterward by the ringing of the\nbell attached to the street door below. It had been attached to the\ndoor so that they might have notice when any one entered the house,\ntoo vast for the three persons who inhabited it. The servant appeared\nsurprised, and grumbled a few words under her breath. Who could have\ncome in such heat as this? She rose, opened the door, and went and\nleaned over the balustrade; then she returned, saying:",
        "“It is Mme. Felicite.”",
        "Old Mme. Rougon entered briskly. In spite of her eighty years, she had\nmounted the stairs with the activity of a young girl; she was still\nthe brown, lean, shrill grasshopper of old. Dressed elegantly now in\nblack silk, she might still be taken, seen from behind, thanks to the\nslenderness of her figure, for some coquette, or some ambitious woman\nfollowing her favorite pursuit. Seen in front, her eyes still lighted\nup her withered visage with their fires, and she smiled with an\nengaging smile when she so desired.",
        "“What! is it you, grandmother?” cried Clotilde, going to meet her.\n\"Why, this sun is enough to bake one.”",
        "Felicite, kissing her on the forehead, laughed, saying:",
        "“Oh, the sun is my friend!”",
        "Then, moving with short, quick steps, she crossed the room, and turned\nthe fastening of one of the shutters.",
        "“Open the shutters a little! It is too gloomy to live in the dark in\nthis way. At my house I let the sun come in.”",
        "Through the opening a jet of hot light, a flood of dancing sparks\nentered. And under the sky, of the violet blue of a conflagration, the\nparched plain could be seen, stretching away in the distance, as if\nasleep or dead in the overpowering, furnace-like heat, while to the\nright, above the pink roofs, rose the belfry of St. Saturnin, a gilded\ntower with arises that, in the blinding light, looked like whitened\nbones.",
        "“Yes,” continued Felicite, “I think of going shortly to the Tulettes,\nand I wished to know if Charles were here, to take him with me. He is\nnot here–I see that–I will take him another day.”",
        "But while she gave this pretext for her visit, her ferret-like eyes\nwere making the tour of the apartment. Besides, she did not insist,\nspeaking immediately afterward of her son Pascal, on hearing the\nrhythmical noise of the pestle, which had not ceased in the adjoining\nchamber.",
        "“Ah! he is still at his devil’s cookery! Don’t disturb him, I have\nnothing to say to him.”",
        "Martine, who had resumed her work on the chair, shook her head, as if\nto say that she had no mind to disturb her master, and there was\nsilence again, while Clotilde wiped her fingers, stained with crayon,\non a cloth, and Felicite began to walk about the room with short\nsteps, looking around inquisitively.",
        "Old Mme. Rougon would soon be two years a widow. Her husband who had\ngrown so corpulent that he could no longer move, had succumbed to an\nattack of indigestion on the 3d of September, 1870, on the night of\nthe day on which he had learned of the catastrophe of Sedan. The ruin\nof the government of which he flattered himself with being one of the\nfounders, seemed to have crushed him. Thus, Felicite affected to\noccupy herself no longer with politics, living, thenceforward, like a\ndethroned queen, the only surviving power of a vanished world. No one\nwas unaware that the Rougons, in 1851, had saved Plassans from\nanarchy, by causing the coup d’etat of the 2d of December to triumph\nthere, and that, a few years later, they had won it again from the\nlegitimist and republican candidates, to give it to a Bonapartist\ndeputy. Up to the time of the war, the Empire had continued\nall-powerful in the town, so popular that it had obtained there at the\nplebiscite an overwhelming majority. But since the disasters the town\nhad become republican, the quarter St. Marc had returned to its secret\nroyalist intrigues, while the old quarter and the new town had sent to\nthe chamber a liberal representative, slightly tinged with Orleanism,\nand ready to take sides with the republic, if it should triumph. And,\ntherefore, it was that Felicite, like the intelligent woman she was,\nhad withdrawn her attention from politics, and consented to be nothing\nmore than the dethroned queen of a fallen government.",
        "But this was still an exalted position, surrounded by a melancholy\npoetry. For sixteen years she had reigned. The tradition of her two\nsalons, the yellow salon, in which the coup d’etat had matured,\nand the green salon, later the neutral ground on which the conquest\nof Plassans was completed, embellished itself with the reflection of\nthe vanished past, and was for her a glorious history. And besides,\nshe was very rich. Then, too, she had shown herself dignified in her\nfall, never uttering a regret or a complaint, parading, with her\neighty years, so long a succession of fierce appetites, of abominable\nmaneuvers, of inordinate gratifications, that she became august\nthrough them. Her only happiness, now, was to enjoy in peace her large\nfortune and her past royalty, and she had but one passion left–to\ndefend her past, to extend its fame, suppressing everything that might\ntarnish it later. Her pride, which lived on the double exploit of\nwhich the inhabitants still spoke, watched with jealous care, resolved\nto leave in existence only creditable documents, those traditions\nwhich caused her to be saluted like a fallen queen when she walked\nthrough the town.",
        "She went to the door of the chamber and listened to the persistent\nnoise of the pestle, which did not cease. Then, with an anxious brow,\nshe returned to Clotilde.",
        "“Good Heavens! What is he making? You know that he is doing himself\nthe greatest harm with his new drug. I was told, the other day, that\nhe came near killing one of his patients.”",
        "“Oh, grandmother!” cried the young girl.",
        "But she was now launched.",
        "“Yes, exactly. The good wives say many other things, besides! Why, go\nquestion them, in the faubourg! They will tell you that he grinds dead\nmen’s bones in infants’ blood.”",
        "This time, while even Martine protested, Clotilde, wounded in her\naffection, grew angry.",
        "“Oh, grandmother, do not repeat such abominations! Master has so great\na heart that he thinks only of making every one happy!”",
        "Then, when she saw that they were both angry, Felicite, comprehending\nthat she had gone too far, resumed her coaxing manner.",
        "“But, my kitten, it is not I who say those frightful things. I repeat\nto you the stupid reports they spread, so that you may comprehend that\nPascal is wrong to pay no heed to public opinion. He thinks he has\nfound a new remedy–nothing could be better! and I will even admit\nthat he will be able to cure everybody, as he hopes. Only, why affect\nthese mysterious ways; why not speak of the matter openly; why, above\nall, try it only on the rabble of the old quarter and of the country,\ninstead of, attempting among the well-to-do people of the town,\nstriking cures which would do him honor? No, my child, you see your\nuncle has never been able to act like other people.”",
        "She had assumed a grieved tone, lowering her voice, to display the\nsecret wound of her heart.",
        "“God be thanked! it is not men of worth who are wanting in our family;\nmy other sons have given me satisfaction enough. Is it not so? Your\nUncle Eugene rose high enough, minister for twelve years, almost\nemperor! And your father himself handled many a million, and had a\npart in many a one of the great works which have made Paris a new\ncity. Not to speak at all of your brother, Maxime, so rich, so\ndistinguished, nor of your cousin, Octave Mouret, one of the kings of\nthe new commerce, nor of our dear Abbe Mouret, who is a saint! Well,\nthen, why does Pascal, who might have followed in the footsteps of\nthem all, persist in living in his hole, like an eccentric old fool?”",
        "And as the young girl was again going to protest, she closed her\nmouth, with a caressing gesture of her hand.",
        "“No, no, let me finish. I know very well that Pascal is not a fool,\nthat he has written remarkable works, that his communications to the\nAcademy of Medicine have even won for him a reputation among\nsavants. But what does that count for, compared to what I have\ndreamed of for him? Yes, all the best practice of the town, a large\nfortune, the decoration–honors, in short, and a position worthy of\nthe family. My word! I used to say to him when he was a child: ’But\nwhere do you come from? You are not one of us!’ As for me, I have\nsacrificed everything for the family; I would let myself be hacked to\npieces, that the family might always be great and glorious!”",
        "She straightened her small figure, she seemed to grow tall with the\none passion that had formed the joy and pride of her life. But as she\nresumed her walk, she was startled by suddenly perceiving on the floor\nthe copy of the Temps, which the doctor had thrown there, after\ncutting out the article, to add it to the Saccard papers, and the\nlight from the open window, falling full upon the sheet, enlightened\nher, no doubt, for she suddenly stopped walking, and threw herself\ninto a chair, as if she at last knew what she had come to learn.",
        "“Your father has been appointed editor of the Epoque,” she said\nabruptly.",
        "“Yes,” answered Clotilde tranquilly, “master told me so; it was in the\npaper.”",
        "With an anxious and attentive expression, Felicite looked at her, for\nthis appointment of Saccard, this rallying to the republic, was\nsomething of vast significance. After the fall of the empire he had\ndared return to France, notwithstanding his condemnation as director\nof the Banque Universelle, the colossal fall of which had preceded\nthat of the government. New influences, some incredible intrigue must\nhave placed him on his feet again, for not only had he received his\npardon, but he was once more in a position to undertake affairs of\nconsiderable importance, launched into journalism, having his share\nagain of all the good things going. And the recollection came to her\nof the quarrels of other days between him and his brother Eugene\nRougon, whom he had so often compromised, and whom, by an ironical\nturn of events, he was perhaps going to protect, now that the former\nminister of the Empire was only a simple deputy, resigned to the\nsingle role of standing by his fallen master with the obstinacy with\nwhich his mother stood by her family. She still obeyed docilely the\norders of her eldest son, the genius, fallen though he was; but\nSaccard, whatever he might do, had also a part in her heart, from his\nindomitable determination to succeed, and she was also proud of\nMaxime, Clotilde’s brother, who had taken up his quarters again, after\nthe war, in his mansion in the Avenue of the Bois de Boulogne, where\nhe was consuming the fortune left him by his wife, Louise de Mareuil,\nbecome prudent, with the wisdom of a man struck in a vital part, and\ntrying to cheat the paralysis which threatened him.",
        "“Editor of the Epoque,” she repeated; “it is really the position of\na minister which your father has won. And I forgot to tell you, I have\nwritten again to your brother, to persuade him to come and see us.\nThat would divert him, it would do him good. Then, there is that\nchild, that poor Charles–”",
        "She did not continue. This was another of the wounds from which her\npride bled; a son whom Maxime had had when seventeen by a servant, and\nwho now, at the age of fifteen, weak of intellect, a half-idiot, lived\nat Plassans, going from the house of one to that of another, a burden\nto all.",
        "She remained silent a moment longer, waiting for some remark from\nClotilde, some transition by which she might come to the subject she\nwished to touch upon. When she saw that the young girl, occupied in\narranging the papers on her desk, was no longer listening, she came to\na sudden decision, after casting a glance at Martine, who continued\nmending the chair, as if she were deaf and dumb.",
        "“Your uncle cut the article out of the Temps, then?”",
        "Clotilde smiled calmly.",
        "“Yes, master put it away among his papers. Ah! how many notes he\nburies in there! Births, deaths, the smallest event in life,\neverything goes in there. And the genealogical tree is there also, our\nfamous genealogical tree, which he keeps up to date!”",
        "The eyes of old Mme. Rougon flamed. She looked fixedly at the young\ngirl.",
        "“You know them, those papers?”",
        "“Oh, no, grandmother; master has never spoken to me of them; and he\nhas forbidden me to touch them.”",
        "But she did not believe her.",
        "“Come! you have them under your hands, you must have read them.”",
        "Very simple, with her calm rectitude, Clotilde answered, smilingly\nagain.",
        "“No, when master forbids me to do anything, it is because he has his\nreasons, and I do not do it.”",
        "“Well, my child,” cried Felicite vehemently, dominated by her passion,\n\"you, whom Pascal loves tenderly, and whom he would listen to,\nperhaps, you ought to entreat him to burn all that, for if he should\nchance to die, and those frightful things which he has in there were\nto be found, we should all be dishonored!”",
        "Ah, those abominable papers! she saw them at night, in her nightmares,\nrevealing in letters of fire, the true histories, the physiological\nblemishes of the family, all that wrong side of her glory which she\nwould have wished to bury forever with the ancestors already dead! She\nknew how it was that the doctor had conceived the idea of collecting\nthese documents at the beginning of his great studies on heredity; how\nhe had found himself led to take his own family as an example, struck\nby the typical cases which he saw in it, and which helped to support\nlaws discovered by him. Was it not a perfectly natural field of\nobservation, close at hand and with which he was thoroughly familiar?\nAnd with the fine, careless justness of the scientist, he had been\naccumulating for the last thirty years the most private data,\ncollecting and classifying everything, raising this genealogical tree\nof the Rougon-Macquarts, of which the voluminous papers, crammed full\nof proofs, were only the commentary.",
        "“Ah, yes,” continued Mme. Rougon hotly, “to the fire, to the fire with\nall those papers that would tarnish our name!”",
        "And as the servant rose to leave the room, seeing the turn the\nconversation was taking, she stopped her by a quick gesture.",
        "“No, no, Martine; stay! You are not in the way, since you are now one\nof the family.”",
        "Then, in a hissing voice:",
        "“A collection of falsehoods, of gossip, all the lies that our enemies,\nenraged by our triumph, hurled against us in former days! Think a\nlittle of that, my child. Against all of us, against your father,\nagainst your mother, against your brother, all those horrors!”",
        "“But how do you know they are horrors, grandmother?”",
        "She was disconcerted for a moment.",
        "“Oh, well; I suspect it! Where is the family that has not had\nmisfortunes which might be injuriously interpreted? Thus, the mother\nof us all, that dear and venerable Aunt Dide, your great-grandmother,\nhas she not been for the past twenty-one years in the madhouse at the\nTulettes? If God has granted her the grace of allowing her to live to\nthe age of one hundred and four years, he has also cruelly afflicted\nher in depriving her of her reason. Certainly, there is no shame in\nthat; only, what exasperates me–what must not be–is that they should\nsay afterward that we are all mad. And, then, regarding your\ngrand-uncle Macquart, too, deplorable rumors have been spread. Macquart\nhad his faults in past days, I do not seek to defend him. But to-day, is\nhe not living very reputably on his little property at the Tulettes, two\nsteps away from our unhappy mother, over whom he watches like a good\nson? And listen! one last example. Your brother, Maxime, committed a\ngreat fault when he had by a servant that poor little Charles, and it is\ncertain, besides, that the unhappy child is of unsound mind. No matter.\nWill it please you if they tell you that your nephew is degenerate; that\nhe reproduces from four generations back, his great-great-grandmother\nthe dear woman to whom we sometimes take him, and with whom he likes so\nmuch to be? No! there is no longer any family possible, if people begin\nto lay bare everything–the nerves of this one, the muscles of that. It\nis enough to disgust one with living!”",
        "Clotilde, standing in her long black blouse, had listened to her\ngrandmother attentively. She had grown very serious; her arms hung by\nher sides, her eyes were fixed upon the ground. There was silence for\na moment; then she said slowly:",
        "“It is science, grandmother.”",
        "“Science!” cried Felicite, trotting about again. “A fine thing, their\nscience, that goes against all that is most sacred in the world! When\nthey shall have demolished everything they will have advanced greatly!\nThey kill respect, they kill the family, they kill the good God!”",
        "“Oh! don’t say that, madame!” interrupted Martine, in a grieved voice,\nher narrow devoutness wounded. “Do not say that M. Pascal kills the\ngood God!”",
        "“Yes, my poor girl, he kills him. And look you, it is a crime, from\nthe religious point of view, to let one’s self be damned in that way.\nYou do not love him, on my word of honor! No, you do not love him, you\ntwo who have the happiness of believing, since you do nothing to bring\nhim back to the right path. Ah! if I were in your place, I would split\nthat press open with a hatchet. I would make a famous bonfire with all\nthe insults to the good God which it contains!”",
        "She had planted herself before the immense press and was measuring it\nwith her fiery glance, as if to take it by assault, to sack it, to\ndestroy it, in spite of the withered and fragile thinness of her\neighty years. Then, with a gesture of ironical disdain:",
        "“If, even with his science, he could know everything!”",
        "Clotilde remained for a moment absorbed in thought, her gaze lost in\nvacancy. Then she said in an undertone, as if speaking to herself:",
        "“It is true, he cannot know everything. There is always something else\nbelow. That is what irritates me; that is what makes us quarrel: for I\ncannot, like him, put the mystery aside. I am troubled by it, so much\nso that I suffer cruelly. Below, what wills and acts in the shuddering\ndarkness, all the unknown forces–”",
        "Her voice had gradually become lower and now dropped to an indistinct\nmurmur.",
        "Then Martine, whose face for a moment past had worn a somber\nexpression, interrupted in her turn:",
        "“If it was true, however, mademoiselle, that monsieur would be damned\non account of those villainous papers, tell me, ought we to let it\nhappen? For my part, look you, if he were to tell me to throw myself\ndown from the terrace, I would shut my eyes and throw myself, because\nI know that he is always right. But for his salvation! Oh! if I could,\nI would work for that, in spite of him. In every way, yes! I would\nforce him; it is too cruel to me to think that he will not be in\nheaven with us.”",
        "“You are quite right, my girl,” said Felicite approvingly. “You, at\nleast, love your master in an intelligent fashion.”",
        "Between the two, Clotilde still seemed irresolute. In her, belief did\nnot bend to the strict rule of dogma; the religious sentiment did not\nmaterialize in the hope of a paradise, of a place of delights, where\nshe was to meet her own again. It was in her simply a need of a\nbeyond, a certainty that the vast world does not stop short at\nsensation, that there is a whole unknown world, besides, which must be\ntaken into account. But her grandmother, who was so old, this servant,\nwho was so devoted, shook her in her uneasy affection for her uncle.\nDid they not love him better, in a more enlightened and more upright\nfashion, they who desired him to be without a stain, freed from his\nmanias as a scientist, pure enough to be among the elect? Phrases of\ndevotional books recurred to her; the continual battle waged against\nthe spirit of evil; the glory of conversions effected after a violent\nstruggle. What if she set herself to this holy task; what if, after\nall, in spite of himself, she should be able to save him! And an\nexaltation gradually gained her spirit, naturally inclined to\nadventurous enterprises.",
        "“Certainly,” she said at last, “I should be very happy if he would not\npersist in his notion of heaping up all those scraps of paper, and if\nhe would come to church with us.”",
        "Seeing her about to yield, Mme. Rougon cried out that it was necessary\nto act, and Martine herself added the weight of all her real\nauthority. They both approached the young girl, and began to instruct\nher, lowering their voices as if they were engaged in a conspiracy,\nwhence was to result a miraculous benefit, a divine joy with which the\nwhole house would be perfumed. What a triumph if they reconciled the\ndoctor with God! and what sweetness, afterward, to live altogether in\nthe celestial communion of the same faith!",
        "“Well, then, what must I do?” asked Clotilde, vanquished, won over.",
        "But at this moment the doctor’s pestle was heard in the silence, with\nits continued rhythm. And the victorious Felicite, who was about to\nspeak, turned her head uneasily, and looked for a moment at the door\nof the adjoining chamber. Then, in an undertone, she said:",
        "“Do you know where the key of the press is?”",
        "Clotilde answered only with an artless gesture, that expressed all her\nrepugnance to betray her master in this way.",
        "“What a child you are! I swear to you that I will take nothing; I will\nnot even disturb anything. Only as we are alone and as Pascal never\nreappears before dinner, we might assure ourselves of what there is in\nthere, might we not? Oh! nothing but a glance, on my word of honor.”",
        "The young girl stood motionless, unwilling, still, to give her\nconsent.",
        "“And then, it may be that I am mistaken; no doubt there are none of\nthose bad things there that I have told you of.”",
        "This was decisive; she ran to take the key from the drawer, and she\nherself opened wide the press.",
        "“There, grandmother, the papers are up there.”",
        "Martine had gone, without a word, to station herself at the door of\nthe doctor’s chamber, her ear on the alert, listening to the pestle,\nwhile Felicite, as if riveted to the spot by emotion, regarded the\npapers. At last, there they were, those terrible documents, the\nnightmare that had poisoned her life! She saw them, she was going to\ntouch them, to carry them away! And she reached up, straining her\nlittle legs, in the eagerness of her desire.",
        "“It is too high, my kitten,” she said. “Help me; give them to me!”",
        "“Oh! not that, grandmother! Take a chair!”",
        "Felicite took a chair, and mounted slowly upon it. But she was still\ntoo short. By an extraordinary effort she raised herself, lengthening\nher stature until she was able to touch the envelopes of strong blue\npaper with the tips of her fingers; and her fingers traveled over\nthem, contracting nervously, scratching like claws. Suddenly there was\na crash–it was a geological specimen, a fragment of marble that had\nbeen on a lower shelf, and that she had just thrown down.",
        "Instantly the pestle stopped, and Martine said in a stifled voice:",
        "“Take care; here he comes!”",
        "But Felicite, grown desperate, did not hear, did not let go her hold\nwhen Pascal entered hastily. He had supposed that some accident had\nhappened, that some one had fallen, and he stood stupefied at what he\nsaw–his mother on the chair, her arm still in the air, while Martine\nhad withdrawn to one side, and Clotilde, very pale, stood waiting,\nwithout turning her head. When he comprehended the scene, he himself\nbecame as white as a sheet. A terrible anger arose within him.",
        "Old Mme. Rougon, however, troubled herself in no wise. When she saw\nthat the opportunity was lost, she descended from the chair, without\nmaking any illusion whatever to the task at which he had surprised\nher.",
        "“Oh, it is you! I do not wish to disturb you. I came to embrace\nClotilde. But here I have been talking for nearly two hours, and I\nmust run away at once. They will be expecting me at home; they won’t\nknow what has become of me at this hour. Good-by until Sunday.”",
        "She went away quite at her ease, after smiling at her son, who stood\nbefore her silent and respectful. It was an attitude that he had long\nsince adopted, to avoid an explanation which he felt must be cruel,\nand which he had always feared. He knew her, he was willing to pardon\nher everything, in his broad tolerance as a scientist, who made\nallowance for heredity, environment, and circumstances. And, then, was\nshe not his mother? That ought to have sufficed, for, in spite of the\nfrightful blows which his researches inflicted upon the family, he\npreserved a great affection for those belonging to him.",
        "When his mother was no longer there, his anger burst forth, and fell\nupon Clotilde. He had turned his eyes away from Martine, and fixed\nthem on the young girl, who did not turn hers away, however, with a\ncourage which accepted the responsibility of her act.",
        "“You! you!” he said at last.",
        "He seized her arm, and pressed it until she cried. But she continued\nto look him full in the face, without quailing before him, with the\nindomitable will of her individuality, of her selfhood. She was\nbeautiful and provoking, with her tall, slender figure, robed in its\nblack blouse; and her exquisite, youthful fairness, her straight\nforehead, her finely cut nose, her firm chin, took on something of a\nwarlike charm in her rebellion.",
        "“You, whom I have made, you who are my pupil, my friend, my other\nmind, to whom I have given a part of my heart and of my brain! Ah,\nyes! I should have kept you entirely for myself, and not have allowed\nyour stupid good God to take the best part of you!”",
        "“Oh, monsieur, you blaspheme!” cried Martine, who had approached him,\nin order to draw upon herself a part of his anger.",
        "But he did not even see her. Only Clotilde existed for him. And he was\nas if transfigured, stirred up by so great a passion that his handsome\nface, crowned by his white hair, framed by his white beard, flamed\nwith youthful passion, with an immense tenderness that had been\nwounded and exasperated.",
        "“You, you!” he repeated in a trembling voice.",
        "“Yes, I! Why then, master, should I not love you better than you love\nme? And why, if I believe you to be in peril, should I not try to save\nyou? You are greatly concerned about what I think; you would like well\nto make me think as you do!”",
        "She had never before defied him in this way.",
        "“But you are a little girl; you know nothing!”",
        "“No, I am a soul, and you know no more about souls than I do!”",
        "He released her arm, and waved his hand vaguely toward heaven, and\nthen a great silence fell–a silence full of grave meaning, of the\nuselessness of the discussion which he did not wish to enter upon.\nThrusting her aside rudely, he crossed over to the middle window and\nopened the blinds, for the sun was declining, and the room was growing\ndark. Then he returned.",
        "But she, feeling a need of air and space, went to the open window. The\nburning rain of sparks had ceased, and there fell now, from on high,\nonly the last shiver of the overheated and paling sky; and from the\nstill burning earth ascended warm odors, with the freer respiration of\nevening. At the foot of the terrace was the railroad, with the\noutlying dependencies of the station, of which the buildings were to\nbe seen in the distance; then, crossing the vast arid plain, a line of\ntrees marked the course of the Viorne, beyond which rose the hills of\nSainte-Marthe, red fields planted with olive trees, supported on\nterraces by walls of uncemented stones and crowned by somber pine\nwoods–broad amphitheaters, bare and desolate, corroded by the heats\nof summer, of the color of old baked brick, which this fringe of dark\nverdure, standing out against the background of the sky, bordered\nabove. To the left opened the gorges of the Seille, great yellow\nstones that had broken away from the soil, and lay in the midst of\nblood-colored fields, dominated by an immense band of rocks like the\nwall of a gigantic fortress; while to the right, at the very entrance\nto the valley through which flowed the Viorne, rose, one above\nanother, the discolored pink-tiled roofs of the town of Plassans, the\ncompact and confused mass of an old town, pierced by the tops of\nancient elms, and dominated by the high tower of St. Saturnin,\nsolitary and serene at this hour in the limpid gold of sunset.",
        "“Ah, my God!” said Clotilde slowly, “one must be arrogant, indeed, to\nimagine that one can take everything in one’s hand and know\neverything!”",
        "Pascal had just mounted on the chair to assure himself that not one of\nhis packages was missing. Then he took up the fragment of marble, and\nreplaced it on the shelf, and when he had again locked the press with\na vigorous turn of the hand, he put the key into his pocket.",
        "“Yes,” he replied; “try not to know everything, and above all, try not\nto bewilder your brain about what we do not know, what we shall\ndoubtless never know!”",
        "Martine again approached Clotilde, to lend her her support, to show\nher that they both had a common cause. And now the doctor perceived\nher, also, and felt that they were both united in the same desire for\nconquest. After years of secret attempts, it was at last open war; the\nsavant saw his household turn against his opinions, and menace them\nwith destruction. There is no worse torture than to have treason in\none’s own home, around one; to be trapped, dispossessed, crushed, by\nthose whom you love, and who love you!",
        "Suddenly this frightful idea presented itself to him.",
        "“And yet both of you love me!” he cried.",
        "He saw their eyes grow dim with tears; he was filled with an infinite\nsadness, on this tranquil close of a beautiful day. All his gaiety,\nall his kindness of heart, which came from his intense love of life,\nwere shaken by it.",
        "“Ah, my dear! and you, my poor girl,” he said, “you are doing this for\nmy happiness, are you not? But, alas, how unhappy we are going to be!”",
        "On the following morning Clotilde was awake at six o’clock. She had\ngone to bed angry with Pascal; they were at variance with each other.\nAnd her first feeling was one of uneasiness, of secret distress, an\ninstant need of making her peace, so that she might no longer have\nupon her heart the heavy weight that lay there now.",
        "Springing quickly out of bed, she went and half opened the shutters of\nboth windows. The sun, already high, sent his light across the chamber\nin two golden bars. Into this drowsy room that exhaled a sweet odor of\nyouth, the bright morning brought with it fresh, cheerful air; but the\nyoung girl went back and sat down on the edge of the bed in a\nthoughtful attitude, clad only in her scant nightdress, which made her\nlook still more slender, with her long tapering limbs, her strong,\nslender body, with its round throat, round neck, round and supple\narms; and her adorable neck and throat, of a milky whiteness, had the\nexquisite softness and smoothness of white satin. For a long time, at\nthe ungraceful age between twelve and eighteen, she had looked\nawkwardly tall, climbing trees like a boy. Then, from the ungainly\nhoyden had been evolved this charming, delicate and lovely creature.",
        "With absent gaze she sat looking at the walls of the chamber. Although\nLa Souleiade dated from the last century, it must have been\nrefurnished under the First Empire, for it was hung with an\nold-fashioned printed calico, with a pattern representing busts of the\nSphinx, and garlands of oak leaves. Originally of a bright red, this\ncalico had faded to a pink–an undecided pink, inclining to orange.\nThe curtains of the two windows and of the bed were still in\nexistence, but it had been necessary to clean them, and this had made\nthem still paler. And this faded purple, this dawnlike tint, so\ndelicately soft, was in truth exquisite. As for the bed, covered with\nthe same stuff, it had come down from so remote an antiquity that it\nhad been replaced by another bed found in an adjoining room; another\nEmpire bed, low and very broad, of massive mahogany, ornamented with\nbrasses, its four square pillars adorned also with busts of the\nSphinx, like those on the wall. The rest of the furniture matched,\nhowever–a press, with whole doors and pillars; a chest of drawers\nwith a marble top, surrounded by a railing; a tall and massive\ncheval-glass, a large lounge with straight feet, and seats with\nstraight, lyre-shaped backs. But a coverlet made of an old Louis XV.\nsilk skirt brightened the majestic bed, that occupied the middle of\nthe wall fronting the windows; a heap of cushions made the lounge\nsoft; and there were, besides, two etageres and a table also covered\nwith old flowered silk, at the further end of the room.",
        "Clotilde at last put on her stockings and slipped on a morning gown of\nwhite pique, and thrusting the tips of her feet into her gray canvas\nslippers, she ran into her dressing-room, a back room looking out on\nthe rear of the house. She had had it hung plainly with an ecrudrill with blue stripes, and it contained only furniture of varnished\npine–the toilette table, two presses, and two chairs. It revealed,\nhowever, a natural and delicate coquetry which was very feminine. This\nhad grown with her at the same time with her beauty. Headstrong and\nboyish though she still was at times, she had become a submissive and\naffectionate woman, desiring to be loved, above everything. The truth\nwas that she had grown up in freedom, without having learned anything\nmore than to read and write, having acquired by herself, later, while\nassisting her uncle, a vast fund of information. But there had been no\nplan settled upon between them. He had not wished to make her a\nprodigy; she had merely conceived a passion for natural history, which\nrevealed to her the mysteries of life. And she had kept her innocence\nunsullied like a fruit which no hand has touched, thanks, no doubt, to\nher unconscious and religious waiting for the coming of love–that\nprofound feminine feeling which made her reserve the gift of her whole\nbeing for the man whom she should love.",
        "She pushed back her hair and bathed her face; then, yielding to her\nimpatience, she again softly opened the door of her chamber and\nventured to cross the vast workroom, noiselessly and on tiptoe. The\nshutters were still closed, but she could see clearly enough not to\nstumble against the furniture. When she was at the other end before\nthe door of the doctor’s room, she bent forward, holding her breath.\nWas he already up? What could he be doing? She heard him plainly,\nwalking about with short steps, dressing himself, no doubt. She never\nentered this chamber in which he chose to hide certain labors; and\nwhich thus remained closed, like a tabernacle. One fear had taken\npossession of her; that of being discovered here by him if he should\nopen the door; and the agitation produced by the struggle between her\nrebellious pride and a desire to show her submission caused her to\ngrow hot and cold by turns, with sensations until now unknown to her.\nFor an instant her desire for reconciliation was so strong that she\nwas on the point of knocking. Then, as footsteps approached, she ran\nprecipitately away.",
        "Until eight o’clock Clotilde was agitated by an ever-increasing\nimpatience. At every instant she looked at the clock on the\nmantelpiece of her room; an Empire clock of gilded bronze,\nrepresenting Love leaning against a pillar, contemplating Time asleep.",
        "Eight was the hour at which she generally descended to the dining-room\nto breakfast with the doctor. And while waiting she made a careful\ntoilette, arranged her hair, and put on another morning gown of white\nmuslin with red spots. Then, having still a quarter of an hour on her\nhands, she satisfied an old desire and sat down to sew a piece of\nnarrow lace, an imitation of Chantilly, on her working blouse, that\nblack blouse which she had begun to find too boyish, not feminine\nenough. But on the stroke of eight she laid down her work, and went\ndownstairs quickly.",
        "“You are going to breakfast entirely alone,” said Martine tranquilly\nto her, when she entered the dining-room.",
        "“How is that?”",
        "“Yes, the doctor called me, and I passed him in his egg through the\nhalf-open door. There he is again, at his mortar and his filter. We\nwon’t see him now before noon.”",
        "Clotilde turned pale with disappointment. She drank her milk standing,\ntook her roll in her hand, and followed the servant into the kitchen.\nThere were on the ground floor, besides this kitchen and the\ndining-room, only an uninhabited room in which the potatoes were stored,\nand which had formerly been used as an office by the doctor, when he\nreceived his patients in his house–the desk and the armchair had years\nago been taken up to his chamber–and another small room, which opened\ninto the kitchen; the old servant’s room, scrupulously clean, and\nfurnished with a walnut chest of drawers and a bed like a nun’s with\nwhite hangings.",
        "“Do you think he has begun to make his liquor again?” asked Clotilde.",
        "“Well, it can be only that. You know that he thinks of neither eating\nnor drinking when that takes possession of him!”",
        "Then all the young girl’s vexation was exhaled in a low plaint:",
        "“Ah, my God! my God!”",
        "And while Martine went to make up her room, she took an umbrella from\nthe hall stand and went disconsolately to eat her roll in the garden,\nnot knowing now how she should occupy her time until midday.",
        "It was now almost seventeen years since Dr. Pascal, having resolved to\nleave his little house in the new town, had bought La Souleiade for\ntwenty thousand francs, in order to live there in seclusion, and also\nto give more space and more happiness to the little girl sent him by\nhis brother Saccard from Paris. This Souleiade, situated outside the\ntown gates on a plateau dominating the plain, was part of a large\nestate whose once vast grounds were reduced to less than two hectares\nin consequence of successive sales, without counting that the\nconstruction of the railroad had taken away the last arable fields.\nThe house itself had been half destroyed by a conflagration and only\none of the two buildings remained–a quadrangular wing “of four\nwalls,” as they say in Provence, with five front windows and roofed\nwith large pink tiles. And the doctor, who had bought it completely\nfurnished, had contented himself with repairing it and finishing the\nboundary walls, so as to be undisturbed in his house.",
        "Generally Clotilde loved this solitude passionately; this narrow\nkingdom which she could go over in ten minutes, and which still\nretained remnants of its past grandeur. But this morning she brought\nthere something like a nervous disquietude. She walked for a few\nmoments along the terrace, at the two extremities of which stood two\nsecular cypresses like two enormous funeral tapers, which could be\nseen three leagues off. The slope then descended to the railroad,\nwalls of uncemented stones supporting the red earth, in which the last\nvines were dead; and on these giant steps grew only rows of olive and\nalmond trees, with sickly foliage. The heat was already overpowering;\nshe saw the little lizards running about on the disjointed flags,\namong the hairy tufts of caper bushes.",
        "Then, as if irritated by the vast horizon, she crossed the orchard and\nthe kitchen garden, which Martine still persisted in cultivating in\nspite of her age, calling in a man only twice a week for the heavier\nlabors; and she ascended to a little pine wood on the right, all that\nremained of the superb pines which had formerly covered the plateau;\nbut, here, too, she was ill at ease; the pine needles crackled under\nher feet, a resinous, stifling odor descended from the branches. And\nwalking along the boundary wall past the entrance gate, which opened\non the road to Les Fenouilleres, three hundred meters from the first\nhouses of Plassans, she emerged at last on the threshing-yard; an\nimmense yard, fifteen meters in radius, which would of itself have\nsufficed to prove the former importance of the domain. Ah! this\nantique area, paved with small round stones, as in the days of the\nRomans; this species of vast esplanade, covered with short dry grass\nof the color of gold as with a thick woolen carpet; how joyously she\nhad played there in other days, running about, rolling on the grass,\nlying for hours on her back, watching the stars coming out one by one\nin the depths of the illimitable sky!",
        "She opened her umbrella again, and crossed the yard with slower steps.\nNow she was on the left of the terrace. She had made the tour of the\nestate, so that she had returned by the back of the house, through the\nclump of enormous plane trees that on this side cast a thick shade.\nThis was the side on which opened the two windows of the doctor’s\nroom. And she raised her eyes to them, for she had approached only in\nthe sudden hope of at last seeing him. But the windows remained\nclosed, and she was wounded by this as by an unkindness to herself.\nThen only did she perceive that she still held in her hand her roll,\nwhich she had forgotten to eat; and she plunged among the trees,\nbiting it impatiently with her fine young teeth.",
        "It was a delicious retreat, this old quincunx of plane trees, another\nremnant of the past splendor of La Souleiade. Under these giant trees,\nwith their monstrous trunks, there was only a dim light, a greenish\nlight, exquisitely cool, even on the hottest days of summer. Formerly\na French garden had been laid out here, of which only the box borders\nremained; bushes which had habituated themselves to the shade, no\ndoubt, for they grew vigorously, as tall as trees. And the charm of\nthis shady nook was a fountain, a simple leaden pipe fixed in the\nshaft of a column; whence flowed perpetually, even in the greatest\ndrought, a thread of water as thick as the little finger, which\nsupplied a large mossy basin, the greenish stones of which were\ncleaned only once in three or four years. When all the wells of the\nneighborhood were dry, La Souleiade still kept its spring, of which\nthe great plane trees were assuredly the secular children. Night and\nday for centuries past this slender thread of water, unvarying and\ncontinuous, had sung the same pure song with crystal sound.",
        "Clotilde, after wandering awhile among the bushes of box, which\nreached to her shoulder, went back to the house for a piece of\nembroidery, and returning with it, sat down at a stone table beside\nthe fountain. Some garden chairs had been placed around it, and they\noften took coffee here. And after this she affected not to look up\nagain from her work, as if she was completely absorbed in it. Now and\nthen, while seeming to look between the trunks of trees toward the\nsultry distance, toward the yard, on which the sun blazed fiercely and\nwhich glowed like a brazier, she stole a glance from under her long\nlashes up to the doctor’s windows. Nothing appeared, not a shadow. And\na feeling of sadness, of resentment, arose within her at this neglect,\nthis contempt in which he seemed to hold her after their quarrel of\nthe day before. She who had got up with so great a desire to make\npeace at once! He was in no hurry, however; he did not love her then,\nsince he could be satisfied to live at variance with her. And\ngradually a feeling of gloom took possession of her, her rebellious\nthoughts returned, and she resolved anew to yield in nothing.",
        "At eleven o’clock, before setting her breakfast on the fire, Martine\ncame to her for a moment, the eternal stocking in her hand which she\nwas always knitting even while walking, when she was not occupied in\nthe affairs of the house.",
        "“Do you know that he is still shut up there like a wolf in his hole,\nat his villainous cookery?”",
        "Clotilde shrugged her shoulders, without lifting her eyes from her\nembroidery.",
        "“And then, mademoiselle, if you only knew what they say! Mme. Felicite\nwas right yesterday when she said that it was really enough to make\none blush. They threw it in my face that he had killed old Boutin,\nthat poor old man, you know, who had the falling sickness and who died\non the road. To believe those women of the faubourg, every one into\nwhom he injects his remedy gets the true cholera from it, without\ncounting that they accuse him of having taken the devil into\npartnership.”",
        "A short silence followed. Then, as the young girl became more gloomy\nthan before, the servant resumed, moving her fingers still more\nrapidly:",
        "“As for me, I know nothing about the matter, but what he is making\nthere enrages me. And you, mademoiselle, do you approve of that\ncookery?”",
        "At last Clotilde raised her head quickly, yielding to the flood of\npassion that swept over her.",
        "“Listen; I wish to know no more about it than you do, but I think that\nhe is on a very dangerous path. He no longer loves us.”",
        "“Oh, yes, mademoiselle; he loves us.”",
        "“No, no; not as we love him. If he loved us, he would be here with us,\ninstead of endangering his soul and his happiness and ours, up there,\nin his desire to save everybody.”",
        "And the two women looked at each other for a moment with eyes burning\nwith affection, in their jealous anger. Then they resumed their work\nin silence, enveloped in shadow.",
        "Above, in his room, Dr. Pascal was working with the serenity of\nperfect joy. He had practised his profession for only about a dozen\nyears, from his return to Paris up to the time when he had retired to\nLa Souleiade. Satisfied with the hundred and odd thousand francs which\nhe had earned and which he had invested prudently, he devoted himself\nalmost exclusively to his favorite studies, retaining only a practise\namong friends, never refusing to go to the bedside of a patient but\nnever sending in his account. When he was paid he threw the money into\na drawer in his writing desk, regarding this as pocket-money for his\nexperiments and caprices, apart from his income which sufficed for his\nwants. And he laughed at the bad reputation for eccentricity which his\nway of life had gained him; he was happy only when in the midst of his\nresearches on the subjects for which he had a passion. It was matter\nfor surprise to many that this scientist, whose intellectual gifts had\nbeen spoiled by a too lively imagination, should have remained at\nPlassans, this out-of-the-way town where it seemed as if every\nrequirement for his studies must be wanting. But he explained very\nwell the advantages which he had discovered here; in the first place,\nan utterly peaceful retreat in which he might live the secluded life\nhe desired; then, an unsuspected field for continuous research in the\nlight of the facts of heredity, which was his passion, in this little\ntown where he knew every family and where he could follow the\nphenomena kept most secret, through two or three generations. And then\nhe was near the seashore; he went there almost every summer, to study\nthe swarming life that is born and propagates itself in the depths of\nthe vast waters. And there was finally, at the hospital in Plassans, a\ndissecting room to which he was almost the only visitor; a large,\nbright, quiet room, in which for more than twenty years every\nunclaimed body had passed under his scalpel. A modest man besides, of\na timidity that had long since become shyness, it had been sufficient\nfor him to maintain a correspondence with his old professors and his\nnew friends, concerning the very remarkable papers which he from time\nto time sent to the Academy of Medicine. He was altogether wanting in\nmilitant ambition.",
        "Ah, this heredity! what a subject of endless meditation it was for\nhim! The strangest, the most wonderful part of it all, was it not that\nthe resemblance between parents and children should not be perfect,\nmathematically exact? He had in the beginning made a genealogical tree\nof his family, logically traced, in which the influences from\ngeneration to generation were distributed equally–the father’s part\nand the mother’s part. But the living reality contradicted the theory\nalmost at every point. Heredity, instead of being resemblance, was an\neffort toward resemblance thwarted by circumstances and environment.\nAnd he had arrived at what he called the hypothesis of the abortion of\ncells. Life is only motion, and heredity being a communicated motion,\nit happened that the cells in their multiplication from one another\njostled one another, pressed one another, made room for themselves,\nputting forth, each one, the hereditary effort; so that if during this\nstruggle the weaker cells succumbed, considerable disturbances took\nplace, with the final result of organs totally different. Did not\nvariation, the constant invention of nature, which clashed with his\ntheories, come from this? Did not he himself differ from his parents\nonly in consequence of similar accidents, or even as the effect of\nlarvated heredity, in which he had for a time believed? For every\ngenealogical tree has roots which extend as far back into humanity as\nthe first man; one cannot proceed from a single ancestor; one may\nalways resemble a still older, unknown ancestor. He doubted atavism,\nhowever; it seemed to him, in spite of a remarkable example taken from\nhis own family, that resemblance at the end of two or three\ngenerations must disappear by reason of accidents, of interferences,\nof a thousand possible combinations. There was then a perpetual\nbecoming, a constant transformation in this communicated effort, this\ntransmitted power, this shock which breathes into matter the breath of\nlife, and which is life itself. And a multiplicity of questions\npresented themselves to him. Was there a physical and intellectual\nprogress through the ages? Did the brain grow with the growth of the\nsciences with which it occupied itself? Might one hope, in time, for a\nlarger sum of reason and of happiness? Then there were special\nproblems; one among others, the mystery of which had for a long time\nirritated him, that of sex; would science never be able to predict, or\nat least to explain the sex of the embryo being? He had written a very\ncurious paper crammed full of facts on this subject, but which left it\nin the end in the complete ignorance in which the most exhaustive\nresearches had left it. Doubtless the question of heredity fascinated\nhim as it did only because it remained obscure, vast, and\nunfathomable, like all the infant sciences where imagination holds\nsway. Finally, a long study which he had made on the heredity of\nphthisis revived in him the wavering faith of the healer, arousing in\nhim the noble and wild hope of regenerating humanity.",
        "In short, Dr. Pascal had only one belief–the belief in life. Life was\nthe only divine manifestation. Life was God, the grand motor, the soul\nof the universe. And life had no other instrument than heredity;\nheredity made the world; so that if its laws could be known and\ndirected, the world could be made to one’s will. In him, to whom\nsickness, suffering, and death had been a familiar sight, the militant\npity of the physician awoke. Ah! to have no more sickness, no more\nsuffering, as little death as possible! His dream ended in this\nthought–that universal happiness, the future community of perfection\nand of felicity, could be hastened by intervention, by giving health\nto all. When all should be healthy, strong, and intelligent, there\nwould be only a superior race, infinitely wise and happy. In India,\nwas not a Brahmin developed from a Soudra in seven generations, thus\nraising, experimentally, the lowest of beings to the highest type of\nhumanity? And as in his study of consumption he had arrived at the\nconclusion that it was not hereditary, but that every child of a\nconsumptive carried within him a degenerate soil in which consumption\ndeveloped with extraordinary facility at the slightest contagion, he\nhad come to think only of invigorating this soil impoverished by\nheredity; to give it the strength to resist the parasites, or rather\nthe destructive leaven, which he had suspected to exist in the\norganism, long before the microbe theory. To give strength–the whole\nproblem was there; and to give strength was also to give will, to\nenlarge the brain by fortifying the other organs.",
        "About this time the doctor, reading an old medical book of the\nfifteenth century, was greatly struck by a method of treating disease\ncalled signature. To cure a diseased organ, it was only necessary to\ntake from a sheep or an ox the corresponding organ in sound condition,\nboil it, and give the soup to the patient to drink. The theory was to\ncure like by like, and in diseases of the liver, especially, the old\nwork stated that the cures were numberless. This set the doctor’s\nvivid imagination working. Why not make the trial? If he wished to\nregenerate those enfeebled by hereditary influences, he had only to\ngive them the normal and healthy nerve substance. The method of the\nsoup, however, seemed to him childish, and he invented in its stead\nthat of grinding in a mortar the brain of a sheep, moistening it with\ndistilled water, and then decanting and filtering the liquor thus\nobtained. He tried this liquor then mixed with Malaga wine, on his\npatients, without obtaining any appreciable result. Suddenly, as he\nwas beginning to grow discouraged, he had an inspiration one day, when\nhe was giving a lady suffering from hepatic colics an injection of\nmorphine with the little syringe of Pravaz. What if he were to try\nhypodermic injections with his liquor? And as soon as he returned home\nhe tried the experiment on himself, making an injection in his side,\nwhich he repeated night and morning. The first doses, of a gram only,\nwere without effect. But having doubled, and then tripled the dose, he\nwas enchanted, one morning on getting up, to find that his limbs had\nall the vigor of twenty. He went on increasing the dose up to five\ngrams, and then his respiration became deeper, and above all he worked\nwith a clearness of mind, an ease, which he had not known for years. A\ngreat flood of happiness, of joy in living, inundated his being. From\nthis time, after he had had a syringe made at Paris capable of\ncontaining five grams, he was surprised at the happy results which he\nobtained with his patients, whom he had on their feet again in a few\ndays, full of energy and activity, as if endowed with new life. His\nmethod was still tentative and rude, and he divined in it all sorts of\ndangers, and especially, that of inducing embolism, if the liquor was\nnot perfectly pure. Then he suspected that the strength of his\npatients came in part from the fever his treatment produced in them.\nBut he was only a pioneer; the method would improve later. Was it not\nalready a miracle to make the ataxic walk, to bring consumptives back\nto life, as it were; even to give hours of lucidity to the insane? And\nat the thought of this discovery of the alchemy of the twentieth\ncentury, an immense hope opened up before him; he believed he had\ndiscovered the universal panacea, the elixir of life, which was to\ncombat human debility, the one real cause of every ill; a veritable\nscientific Fountain of Youth, which, in giving vigor, health, and will\nwould create an altogether new and superior humanity.",
        "This particular morning in his chamber, a room with a northern aspect\nand somewhat dark owing to the vicinity of the plane trees, furnished\nsimply with an iron bedstead, a mahogany writing desk, and a large\nwriting table, on which were a mortar and a microscope, he was\ncompleting with infinite care the preparation of a vial of his liquor.\nSince the day before, after pounding the nerve substance of a sheep in\ndistilled water, he had been decanting and filtering it. And he had at\nlast obtained a small bottle of a turbid, opaline liquid, irised by\nbluish gleams, which he regarded for a long time in the light as if he\nheld in his hand the regenerating blood and symbol of the world.",
        "But a few light knocks at the door and an urgent voice drew him from\nhis dream.",
        "“Why, what is the matter, monsieur? It is a quarter-past twelve; don’t\nyou intend to come to breakfast?”",
        "For downstairs breakfast had been waiting for some time past in the\nlarge, cool dining-room. The blinds were closed, with the exception of\none which had just been half opened. It was a cheerful room, with\npearl gray panels relieved by blue mouldings. The table, the\nsideboard, and the chairs must have formed part of the set of Empire\nfurniture in the bedrooms; and the old mahogany, of a deep red, stood\nout in strong relief against the light background. A hanging lamp of\npolished brass, always shining, gleamed like a sun; while on the four\nwalls bloomed four large bouquets in pastel, of gillyflowers,\ncarnations, hyacinths, and roses.",
        "Joyous, radiant, Dr. Pascal entered.",
        "“Ah, the deuce! I had forgotten! I wanted to finish. Look at this,\nquite fresh, and perfectly pure this time; something to work miracles\nwith!”",
        "And he showed the vial, which he had brought down in his enthusiasm.\nBut his eye fell on Clotilde standing erect and silent, with a serious\nair. The secret vexation caused by waiting had brought back all her\nhostility, and she, who had burned to throw herself on his neck in the\nmorning, remained motionless as if chilled and repelled by him.",
        "“Good!” he resumed, without losing anything of his gaiety, “we are\nstill at odds, it seems. That is something very ugly. So you don’t\nadmire my sorcerer’s liquor, which resuscitates the dead?”",
        "He seated himself at the table, and the young girl, sitting down\nopposite him, was obliged at last to answer:",
        "“You know well, master, that I admire everything belonging to you.\nOnly, my most ardent desire is that others also should admire you. And\nthere is the death of poor old Boutin–”",
        "“Oh!” he cried, without letting her finish, “an epileptic, who\nsuccumbed to a congestive attack! See! since you are in a bad humor,\nlet us talk no more about that–you would grieve me, and that would\nspoil my day.”",
        "There were soft boiled eggs, cutlets, and cream. Silence reigned for a\nfew moments, during which in spite of her ill-humor she ate heartily,\nwith a good appetite which she had not the coquetry to conceal. Then\nhe resumed, laughing:",
        "“What reassures me is to see that your stomach is in good order.\nMartine, hand mademoiselle the bread.”",
        "The servant waited on them as she was accustomed to do, watching them\neat, with her quiet air of familiarity.",
        "Sometimes she even chatted with them.",
        "“Monsieur,” she said, when she had cut the bread, “the butcher has\nbrought his bill. Is he to be paid?”",
        "He looked up at her in surprise.",
        "“Why do you ask me that?” he said. “Do you not always pay him without\nconsulting me?”",
        "It was, in effect, Martine who kept the purse. The amount deposited\nwith M. Grandguillot, notary at Plassans, produced a round sum of six\nthousand francs income. Every three months the fifteen hundred francs\nwere remitted to the servant, and she disposed of them to the best\ninterests of the house; bought and paid for everything with the\nstrictest economy, for she was of so saving a disposition that they\nbantered her about it continually. Clotilde, who spent very little,\nhad never thought of asking a separate purse for herself. As for the\ndoctor, he took what he required for his experiments and his pocket\nmoney from the three or four thousand francs which he still earned\nevery year, and which he kept lying in the drawer of his writing desk;\nso that there was quite a little treasure there in gold and bank\nbills, of which he never knew the exact amount.",
        "“Undoubtedly, monsieur, I pay, when it is I who have bought the\nthings; but this time the bill is so large on account of the brains\nwhich the butcher has furnished you–”",
        "The doctor interrupted her brusquely:",
        "“Ah, come! so you, too, are going to set yourself against me, are you?\nNo, no; both of you–that would be too much! Yesterday you pained me\ngreatly, and I was angry. But this must cease. I will not have the\nhouse turned into a hell. Two women against me, and they the only ones\nwho love me at all? Do you know, I would sooner quit the house at\nonce!”",
        "He did not speak angrily, he even smiled; but the disquietude of his\nheart was perceptible in the trembling of his voice. And he added with\nhis indulgent, cheerful air:",
        "“If you are afraid for the end of the month, my girl, tell the butcher\nto send my bill apart. And don’t fear; you are not going to be asked\nfor any of your money to settle it with; your sous may lie sleeping.”",
        "This was an allusion to Martine’s little personal fortune. In thirty\nyears, with four hundred francs wages she had earned twelve thousand\nfrancs, from which she had taken only what was strictly necessary for\nher wants; and increased, almost trebled, by the interest, her savings\namounted now to thirty thousand francs, which through a caprice, a\ndesire to have her money apart, she had not chosen to place with M.\nGrandguillot. They were elsewhere, safely invested in the funds.",
        "“Sous that lie sleeping are honest sous,” she said gravely. “But\nmonsieur is right; I will tell the butcher to send a bill apart, as\nall the brains are for monsieur’s cookery and not for mine.”",
        "This explanation brought a smile to the face of Clotilde, who was\nalways amused by the jests about Martine’s avarice; and the breakfast\nended more cheerfully. The doctor desired to take the coffee under the\nplane trees, saying that he felt the need of air after being shut up\nall the morning. The coffee was served then on the stone table beside\nthe fountain; and how pleasant it was there in the shade, listening to\nthe cool murmur of the water, while around, the pine wood, the court,\nthe whole place, were glowing in the early afternoon sun.",
        "The doctor had complacently brought with him the vial of nerve\nsubstance, which he looked at as it stood on the table.",
        "“So, then, mademoiselle,” he resumed, with an air of brusque\npleasantry, “you do not believe in my elixir of resurrection, and you\nbelieve in miracles!”",
        "“Master,” responded Clotilde, “I believe that we do not know\neverything.”",
        "He made a gesture of impatience.",
        "“But we must know everything. Understand then, obstinate little girl,\nthat not a single deviation from the invariable laws which govern the\nuniverse has ever been scientifically proved. Up to this day there has\nbeen no proof of the existence of any intelligence other than the\nhuman. I defy you to find any real will, any reasoning force, outside\nof life. And everything is there; there is in the world no other will\nthan this force which impels everything to life, to a life ever\nbroader and higher.”",
        "He rose with a wave of the hand, animated by so firm a faith that she\nregarded him in surprise, noticing how youthful he looked in spite of\nhis white hair.",
        "“Do you wish me to repeat my ’Credo’ for you, since you accuse me of\nnot wanting yours? I believe that the future of humanity is in the\nprogress of reason through science. I believe that the pursuit of\ntruth, through science, is the divine ideal which man should propose\nto himself. I believe that all is illusion and vanity outside the\ntreasure of truths slowly accumulated, and which will never again be\nlost. I believe that the sum of these truths, always increasing, will\nat last confer on man incalculable power and peace, if not happiness.\nYes, I believe in the final triumph of life.”",
        "And with a broader sweep of the hand that took in the vast horizon, as\nif calling on these burning plains in which fermented the saps of all\nexistences to bear him witness, he added:",
        "“But the continual miracle, my child, is life. Only open your eyes,\nand look.”",
        "She shook her head.",
        "“It is in vain that I open my eyes; I cannot see everything. It is\nyou, master, who are blind, since you do not wish to admit that there\nis beyond an unknown realm which you will never enter. Oh, I know you\nare too intelligent to be ignorant of that! Only you do not wish to\ntake it into account; you put the unknown aside, because it would\nembarrass you in your researches. It is in vain that you tell me to\nput aside the mysterious; to start from the known for the conquest of\nthe unknown. I cannot; the mysterious at once calls me back and\ndisturbs me.”",
        "He listened to her, smiling, glad to see her become animated, while he\nsmoothed her fair curls with his hand.",
        "“Yes, yes, I know you are like the rest; you do not wish to live\nwithout illusions and without lies. Well, there, there; we understand\neach other still, even so. Keep well; that is the half of wisdom and\nof happiness.”",
        "Then, changing the conversation:",
        "“Come, you will accompany me, notwithstanding, and help me in my round\nof miracles. This is Thursday, my visiting day. When the heat shall\nhave abated a little, we will go out together.”",
        "She refused at first, in order not to seem to yield; but she at last\nconsented, seeing the pain she gave him. She was accustomed to\naccompany him on his round of visits. They remained for some time\nlonger under the plane trees, until the doctor went upstairs to dress.\nWhen he came down again, correctly attired in a close-fitting coat and\nwearing a broad-brimmed silk hat, he spoke of harnessing Bonhomme, the\nhorse that for a quarter of a century had taken him on his visits\nthrough the streets and the environs of Plassans. But the poor old\nbeast was growing blind, and through gratitude for his past services\nand affection for himself they now rarely disturbed him. On this\nafternoon he was very drowsy, his gaze wandered, his legs were stiff\nwith rheumatism. So that the doctor and the young girl, when they went\nto the stable to see him, gave him a hearty kiss on either side of his\nnose, telling him to rest on a bundle of fresh hay which the servant\nhad brought. And they decided to walk.",
        "Clotilde, keeping on her spotted white muslin, merely tied on over her\ncurls a large straw hat adorned with a bunch of lilacs; and she looked\ncharming, with her large eyes and her complexion of milk-and-roses\nunder the shadow of its broad brim. When she went out thus on Pascal’s\narm, she tall, slender, and youthful, he radiant, his face\nilluminated, so to say, by the whiteness of his beard, with a vigor\nthat made him still lift her across the rivulets, people smiled as\nthey passed, and turned around to look at them again, they seemed so\ninnocent and so happy. On this day, as they left the road to Les\nFenouilleres to enter Plassans, a group of gossips stopped short in\ntheir talk. It reminded one of one of those ancient kings one sees in\npictures; one of those powerful and gentle kings who never grew old,\nresting his hand on the shoulder of a girl beautiful as the day, whose\ndocile and dazzling youth lends him its support.",
        "They were turning into the Cours Sauvair to gain the Rue de la Banne,\nwhen a tall, dark young man of about thirty stopped them.",
        "“Ah, master, you have forgotten me. I am still waiting for your notes\non consumption.”",
        "It was Dr. Ramond, a young physician, who had settled two years before\nat Plassans, where he was building up a fine practise. With a superb\nhead, in the brilliant prime of a gracious manhood, he was adored by\nthe women, but he had fortunately a great deal of good sense and a\ngreat deal of prudence.",
        "“Why, Ramond, good day! Not at all, my dear friend; I have not\nforgotten you. It is this little girl, to whom I gave the notes\nyesterday to copy, and who has not touched them yet.”",
        "The two young people shook hands with an air of cordial intimacy.",
        "“Good day, Mlle. Clotilde.”",
        "“Good day, M. Ramond.”",
        "During a gastric fever, happily mild, which the young girl had had the\npreceding year, Dr. Pascal had lost his head to the extent of\ndistrusting his own skill, and he had asked his young colleague to\nassist him–to reassure him. Thus it was that an intimacy, a sort of\ncomradeship, had sprung up among the three.",
        "“You shall have your notes to-morrow, I promise you,” she said,\nsmiling.",
        "Ramond walked on with them, however, until they reached the end of the\nRue de la Banne, at the entrance of the old quarter whither they were\ngoing. And there was in the manner in which he leaned, smiling, toward\nClotilde, the revelation of a secret love that had grown slowly,\nawaiting patiently the hour fixed for the most reasonable of\ndenouements. Besides, he listened with deference to Dr. Pascal,\nwhose works he admired greatly.",
        "“And it just happens, my dear friend, that I am going to Guiraude’s,\nthat woman, you know, whose husband, a tanner, died of consumption\nfive years ago. She has two children living–Sophie, a girl now going\non sixteen, whom I fortunately succeeded in having sent four years\nbefore her father’s death to a neighboring village, to one of her\naunts; and a son, Valentin, who has just completed his twenty-first\nyear, and whom his mother insisted on keeping with her through a blind\naffection, notwithstanding that I warned her of the dreadful results\nthat might ensue. Well, see if I am right in asserting that\nconsumption is not hereditary, but only that consumptive parents\ntransmit to their children a degenerate soil, in which the disease\ndevelops at the slightest contagion. Now, Valentin, who lived in daily\ncontact with his father, is consumptive, while Sophie, who grew up in\nthe open air, has superb health.”",
        "He added with a triumphant smile:",
        "“But that will not prevent me, perhaps, from saving Valentin, for he\nis visibly improved, and is growing fat since I have used my\ninjections with him. Ah, Ramond, you will come to them yet; you will\ncome to my injections!”",
        "The young physician shook hands with both of them, saying:",
        "“I don’t say no. You know that I am always with you.”",
        "When they were alone they quickened their steps and were soon in the\nRue Canquoin, one of the narrowest and darkest streets of the old\nquarter. Hot as was the sun, there reigned here the semi-obscurity and\nthe coolness of a cave. Here it was, on a ground floor, that Guiraude\nlived with her son Valentin. She opened the door herself. She was a\nthin, wasted-looking woman, who was herself affected with a slow\ndecomposition of the blood. From morning till night she crushed\nalmonds with the end of an ox-bone on a large paving stone, which she\nheld between her knees. This work was their only means of living, the\nson having been obliged to give up all labor. She smiled, however,\nto-day on seeing the doctor, for Valentin had just eaten a cutlet with\na good appetite, a thing which he had not done for months. Valentin, a\nsickly-looking young man, with scanty hair and beard and prominent\ncheek bones, on each of which was a bright red spot, while the rest of\nhis face was of a waxen hue, rose quickly to show how much more\nsprightly he felt! And Clotilde was touched by the reception given to\nPascal as a saviour, the awaited Messiah. These poor people pressed\nhis hands–they would like to have kissed his feet; looking at him\nwith eyes shining with gratitude. True, the disease was not yet cured:\nperhaps this was only the effect of the stimulus, perhaps what he felt\nwas only the excitement of fever. But was it not something to gain\ntime? He gave him another injection while Clotilde, standing before\nthe window, turned her back to them; and when they were leaving she\nsaw him lay twenty francs upon the table. This often happened to him,\nto pay his patients instead of being paid by them.",
        "He made three other visits in the old quarter, and then went to see a\nlady in the new town. When they found themselves in the street again,\nhe said:",
        "“Do you know that, if you were a courageous girl, we should walk to\nSeguiranne, to see Sophie at her aunt’s. That would give me pleasure.”",
        "The distance was scarcely three kilometers; that would be only a\npleasant walk in this delightful weather. And she agreed gaily, not\nsulky now, but pressing close to him, happy to hang on his arm. It was\nfive o’clock. The setting sun spread over the fields a great sheet of\ngold. But as soon as they left Plassans they were obliged to cross the\ncorner of the vast, arid plain, which extended to the right of the\nViorne. The new canal, whose irrigating waters were soon to transform\nthe face of the country parched with thirst, did not yet water this\nquarter, and red fields and yellow fields stretched away into the\ndistance under the melancholy and blighting glare of the sun, planted\nonly with puny almond trees and dwarf olives, constantly cut down and\npruned, whose branches twisted and writhed in attitudes of suffering\nand revolt. In the distance, on the bare hillsides, were to be seen\nonly like pale patches the country houses, flanked by the regulation\ncypress. The vast, barren expanse, however, with broad belts of\ndesolate fields of hard and distinct coloring, had classic lines of a\nsevere grandeur. And on the road the dust lay twenty centimeters\nthick, a dust like snow, that the slightest breath of wind raised in\nbroad, flying clouds, and that covered with white powder the fig trees\nand the brambles on either side.",
        "Clotilde, who amused herself like a child, listening to this dust\ncrackling under her little feet, wished to hold her parasol over\nPascal.",
        "“You have the sun in your eyes. Lean a little this way.”",
        "But at last he took possession of the parasol, to hold it himself.",
        "“It is you who do not hold it right; and then it tires you. Besides,\nwe are almost there now.”",
        "In the parched plain they could already perceive an island of verdure,\nan enormous clump of trees. This was La Seguiranne, the farm on which\nSophie had grown up in the house of her Aunt Dieudonne, the wife of\nthe cross old man. Wherever there was a spring, wherever there was a\nrivulet, this ardent soil broke out in rich vegetation; and then there\nwere walks bordered by trees, whose luxuriant foliage afforded a\ndelightful coolness and shade. Plane trees, chestnut trees, and young\nelms grew vigorously. They entered an avenue of magnificent green\noaks.",
        "As they approached the farm, a girl who was making hay in the meadow\ndropped her fork and ran toward them. It was Sophie, who had\nrecognized the doctor and the young lady, as she called Clotilde. She\nadored them, but she stood looking at them in confusion, unable to\nexpress the glad greeting with which her heart overflowed. She\nresembled her brother Valentin; she had his small stature, his\nprominent cheek bones, his pale hair; but in the country, far from the\ncontagion of the paternal environment, she had, it seemed, gained\nflesh; acquired with her robust limbs a firm step; her cheeks had\nfilled out, her hair had grown luxuriant. And she had fine eyes, which\nshone with health and gratitude. Her Aunt Dieudonne, who was making\nhay with her, had come toward them also, crying from afar jestingly,\nwith something of Provencal rudeness:",
        "“Ah, M. Pascal, we have no need of you here! There is no one sick!”",
        "The doctor, who had simply come in search of this fine spectacle of\nhealth, answered in the same tone:",
        "“I hope so, indeed. But that does not prevent this little girl here\nfrom owing you and me a fine taper!”",
        "“Well, that is the pure truth! And she knows it, M. Pascal. There is\nnot a day that she does not say that but for you she would be at this\ntime like her brother Valentin.”",
        "“Bah! We will save him, too. He is getting better, Valentin is. I have\njust been to see him.”",
        "Sophie seized the doctor’s hands; large tears stood in her eyes, and\nshe could only stammer:",
        "“Oh, M. Pascal!”",
        "How they loved him! And Clotilde felt her affection for him increase,\nseeing the affection of all these people for him. They remained\nchatting there for a few moments longer, in the salubrious shade of\nthe green oaks. Then they took the road back to Plassans, having still\nanother visit to make.",
        "This was to a tavern, that stood at the crossing of two roads and was\nwhite with the flying dust. A steam mill had recently been established\nopposite, utilizing the old buildings of Le Paradou, an estate dating\nfrom the last century, and Lafouasse, the tavern keeper, still carried\non his little business, thanks to the workmen at the mill and to the\npeasants who brought their corn to it. He had still for customers on\nSundays the few inhabitants of Les Artauds, a neighboring hamlet. But\nmisfortune had struck him; for the last three years he had been\ndragging himself about groaning with rheumatism, in which the doctor\nhad finally recognized the beginning of ataxia. But he had obstinately\nrefused to take a servant, persisting in waiting on his customers\nhimself, holding on by the furniture. So that once more firm on his\nfeet, after a dozen punctures, he already proclaimed his cure\neverywhere.",
        "He chanced to be just then at his door, and looked strong and\nvigorous, with his tall figure, fiery face, and fiery red hair.",
        "“I was waiting for you, M. Pascal. Do you know that I have been able\nto bottle two casks of wine without being tired!”",
        "Clotilde remained outside, sitting on a stone bench; while Pascal\nentered the room to give Lafouasse the injection. She could hear them\nspeaking, and the latter, who in spite of his stoutness was very\ncowardly in regard to pain, complained that the puncture hurt, adding,\nhowever, that after all a little suffering was a small price to pay\nfor good health. Then he declared he would be offended if the doctor\ndid not take a glass of something. The young lady would not affront\nhim by refusing to take some syrup. He carried a table outside, and\nthere was nothing for it but they must touch glasses with him.",
        "“To your health, M. Pascal, and to the health of all the poor devils\nto whom you give back a relish for their victuals!”",
        "Clotilde thought with a smile of the gossip of which Martine had\nspoken to her, of Father Boutin, whom they accused the doctor of\nhaving killed. He did not kill all his patients, then; his remedy\nworked real miracles, since he brought back to life the consumptive\nand the ataxic. And her faith in her master returned with the warm\naffection for him which welled up in her heart. When they left\nLafouasse, she was once more completely his; he could do what he\nwilled with her.",
        "But a few moments before, sitting on the stone bench looking at the\nsteam mill, a confused story had recurred to her mind; was it not here\nin these smoke-blackened buildings, to-day white with flour, that a\ndrama of love had once been enacted? And the story came back to her;\ndetails given by Martine; allusions made by the doctor himself; the\nwhole tragic love adventure of her cousin the Abbe Serge Mouret, then\nrector of Les Artauds, with an adorable young girl of a wild and\npassionate nature who lived at Le Paradou.",
        "Returning by the same road Clotilde stopped, and pointing to the vast,\nmelancholy expanse of stubble fields, cultivated plains, and fallow\nland, said:",
        "“Master, was there not once there a large garden? Did you not tell me\nsome story about it?”",
        "“Yes, yes; Le Paradou, an immense garden–woods, meadows, orchards,\nparterres, fountains, and brooks that flowed into the Viorne. A garden\nabandoned for an age; the garden of the Sleeping Beauty, returned to\nNature’s rule. And as you see they have cut down the woods, and\ncleared and leveled the ground, to divide it into lots, and sell it by\nauction. The springs themselves have dried up. There is nothing there\nnow but that fever-breeding marsh. Ah, when I pass by here, it makes\nmy heart ache!”",
        "She ventured to question him further:",
        "“But was it not in Le Paradou that my cousin Serge and your great\nfriend Albine fell in love with each other?”",
        "He had forgotten her presence. He went on talking, his gaze fixed on\nspace, lost in recollections of the past.",
        "“Albine, my God! I can see her now, in the sunny garden, like a great,\nfragrant bouquet, her head thrown back, her bosom swelling with joy,\nhappy in her flowers, with wild flowers braided among her blond\ntresses, fastened at her throat, on her corsage, around her slender,\nbare brown arms. And I can see her again, after she had asphyxiated\nherself; dead in the midst of her flowers; very white, sleeping with\nfolded hands, and a smile on her lips, on her couch of hyacinths and\ntuberoses. Dead for love; and how passionately Albine and Serge loved\neach other, in the great garden their tempter, in the bosom of Nature\ntheir accomplice! And what a flood of life swept away all false bonds,\nand what a triumph of life!”",
        "Clotilde, she too troubled by this passionate flow of murmured words,\ngazed at him intently. She had never ventured to speak to him of\nanother story that she had heard–the story of the one love of his\nlife–a love which he had cherished in secret for a lady now dead. It\nwas said that he had attended her for a long time without ever so much\nas venturing to kiss the tips of her fingers. Up to the present, up to\nnear sixty, study and his natural timidity had made him shun women.\nBut, notwithstanding, one felt that he was reserved for some great\npassion, with his feelings still fresh and ardent, in spite of his\nwhite hair.",
        "“And the girl that died, the girl they mourned,” she resumed, her\nvoice trembling, her cheeks scarlet, without knowing why. “Serge did\nnot love her, then, since he let her die?”",
        "Pascal started as though awakening from a dream, seeing her beside him\nin her youthful beauty, with her large, clear eyes shining under the\nshadow of her broad-brimmed hat. Something had happened; the same\nbreath of life had passed through them both; they did not take each\nother’s arms again. They walked side by side.",
        "“Ah, my dear, the world would be too beautiful, if men did not spoil\nit all! Albine is dead, and Serge is now rector of St. Eutrope, where\nhe lives with his sister Desiree, a worthy creature who has the good\nfortune to be half an idiot. He is a holy man; I have never said the\ncontrary. One may be an assassin and serve God.”",
        "And he went on speaking of the hard things of life, of the blackness\nand execrableness of humanity, without losing his gentle smile. He\nloved life; and the continuous work of life was a continual joy to him\nin spite of all the evil, all the misery, that it might contain. It\nmattered not how dreadful life might appear, it must be great and\ngood, since it was lived with so tenacious a will, for the purpose no\ndoubt of this will itself, and of the great work which it\nunconsciously accomplished. True, he was a scientist, a clear-sighted\nman; he did not believe in any idyllic humanity living in a world of\nperpetual peace; he saw, on the contrary, its woes and its vices; he\nhad laid them bare; he had examined them; he had catalogued them for\nthirty years past, but his passion for life, his admiration for the\nforces of life, sufficed to produce in him a perpetual gaiety, whence\nseemed to flow naturally his love for others, a fraternal compassion,\na sympathy, which were felt under the roughness of the anatomist and\nunder the affected impersonality of his studies.",
        "“Bah!” he ended, taking a last glance at the vast, melancholy plains.\n\"Le Paradou is no more. They have sacked it, defiled it, destroyed it;\nbut what does that matter! Vines will be planted, corn will spring up,\na whole growth of new crops; and people will still fall in love in\nvintages and harvests yet to come. Life is eternal; it is a perpetual\nrenewal of birth and growth.”",
        "He took her arm again and they returned to the town thus, arm in arm\nlike good friends, while the glow of the sunset was slowly fading away\nin a tranquil sea of violets and roses. And seeing them both pass\nagain, the ancient king, powerful and gentle, leaning against the\nshoulder of a charming and docile girl, supported by her youth, the\nwomen of the faubourg, sitting at their doors, looked after them with\na smile of tender emotion.",
        "At La Souleiade Martine was watching for them. She waved her hand to\nthem from afar. What! Were they not going to dine to-day? Then, when\nthey were near, she said:",
        "“Ah! you will have to wait a little while. I did not venture to put on\nmy leg of mutton yet.”",
        "They remained outside to enjoy the charm of the closing day. The pine\ngrove, wrapped in shadow, exhaled a balsamic resinous odor, and from\nthe yard, still heated, in which a last red gleam was dying away, a\nchillness arose. It was like an assuagement, a sigh of relief, a\nresting of surrounding Nature, of the puny almond trees, the twisted\nolives, under the paling sky, cloudless and serene; while at the back\nof the house the clump of plane trees was a mass of black and\nimpenetrable shadows, where the fountain was heard singing its eternal\ncrystal song.",
        "“Look!” said the doctor, “M. Bellombre has already dined, and he is\ntaking the air.”",
        "He pointed to a bench, on which a tall, thin old man of seventy was\nsitting, with a long face, furrowed with wrinkles, and large, staring\neyes, and very correctly attired in a close-fitting coat and cravat.",
        "“He is a wise man,” murmured Clotilde. “He is happy.”",
        "“He!” cried Pascal. “I should hope not!”",
        "He hated no one, and M. Bellombre, the old college professor, now\nretired, and living in his little house without any other company than\nthat of a gardener who was deaf and dumb and older than himself, was\nthe only person who had the power to exasperate him.",
        "“A fellow who has been afraid of life; think of that! afraid of life!\nYes, a hard and avaricious egotist! If he banished woman from his\nexistence, it was only through fear of having to pay for her shoes.\nAnd he has known only the children of others, who have made him suffer\n–hence his hatred of the child–that flesh made to be flogged. The\nfear of life, the fear of burdens and of duties, of annoyances and of\ncatastrophes! The fear of life, which makes us through dread of its\nsufferings refuse its joys. Ah! I tell you, this cowardliness enrages\nme; I cannot forgive it. We must live–live a complete life–live all\nour life. Better even suffering, suffering only, than such\nrenunciation–the death of all there is in us that is living and\nhuman!”",
        "M. Bellombre had risen, and was walking along one of the walks with\nslow, tranquil steps. Then, Clotilde, who had been watching him in\nsilence, at last said:",
        "“There is, however, the joy of renunciation. To renounce, not to live;\nto keep one’s self for the spiritual, has not this always been the\ngreat happiness of the saints?”",
        "“If they had not lived,” cried Pascal, “they could not now be saints.\nLet suffering come, and I will bless it, for it is perhaps the only\ngreat happiness!”",
        "But he felt that she rebelled against this; that he was going to lose\nher again. At the bottom of our anxiety about the beyond is the secret\nfear and hatred of life. So that he hastily assumed again his pleasant\nsmile, so affectionate and conciliating.",
        "“No, no! Enough for to-day; let us dispute no more; let us love each\nother dearly. And see! Martine is calling us, let us go in to dinner.”",
        "For a month this unpleasant state of affairs continued, every day\ngrowing worse, and Clotilde suffered especially at seeing that Pascal\nnow locked up everything. He had no longer the same tranquil\nconfidence in her as before, and this wounded her so deeply that, if\nshe had at any time found the press open, she would have thrown the\npapers into the fire as her grandmother Felicite had urged her to do.\nAnd the disagreements began again, so that they often remained without\nspeaking to each other for two days together.",
        "One morning, after one of these misunderstandings which had lasted\nsince the day before, Martine said as she was serving the breakfast:",
        "“Just now as I was crossing the Place de la Sous-Prefecture, I saw a\nstranger whom I thought I recognized going into Mme. Felicite’s house.\nYes, mademoiselle, I should not be surprised if it were your brother.”",
        "On the impulse of the moment, Pascal and Clotilde spoke.",
        "“Your brother! Did your grandmother expect him, then?”",
        "“No, I don’t think so, though she has been expecting him at any time\nfor the past six months, I know that she wrote to him again a week\nago.”",
        "They questioned Martine.",
        "“Indeed, monsieur, I cannot say; since I last saw M. Maxime four years\nago, when he stayed two hours with us on his way to Italy, he may\nperhaps have changed greatly–I thought, however, that I recognized\nhis back.”",
        "The conversation continued, Clotilde seeming to be glad of this event,\nwhich broke at last the oppressive silence between them, and Pascal\nended:",
        "“Well, if it is he, he will come to see us.”",
        "It was indeed Maxime. He had yielded, after months of refusal, to the\nurgent solicitations of old Mme. Rougon, who had still in this quarter\nan open family wound to heal. The trouble was an old one, and it grew\nworse every day.",
        "Fifteen years before, when he was seventeen, Maxime had had a child by\na servant whom he had seduced. His father Saccard, and his stepmother\nRenee–the latter vexed more especially at his unworthy choice–had\nacted in the matter with indulgence. The servant, Justine Megot,\nbelonged to one of the neighboring villages, and was a fair-haired\ngirl, also seventeen, gentle and docile; and they had sent her back to\nPlassans, with an allowance of twelve hundred francs a year, to bring\nup little Charles. Three years later she had married there a\nharness-maker of the faubourg, Frederic Thomas by name, a good workman\nand a sensible fellow, who was tempted by the allowance. For the rest\nher conduct was now most exemplary, she had grown fat, and she\nappeared to be cured of a cough that had threatened a hereditary\nmalady due to the alcoholic propensities of a long line of\nprogenitors. And two other children born of her marriage, a boy who\nwas now ten and a girl who was seven, both plump and rosy, enjoyed\nperfect health; so that she would have been the most respected and the\nhappiest of women, if it had not been for the trouble which Charles\ncaused in the household. Thomas, notwithstanding the allowance,\nexecrated this son of another man and gave him no peace, which made\nthe mother suffer in secret, being an uncomplaining and submissive\nwife. So that, although she adored him, she would willingly have given\nhim up to his father’s family.",
        "Charles, at fifteen, seemed scarcely twelve, and he had the infantine\nintelligence of a child of five, resembling in an extraordinary degree\nhis great-great-grandmother, Aunt Dide, the madwoman at the Tulettes.\nHe had the slender and delicate grace of one of those bloodless little\nkings with whom a race ends, crowned with their long, fair locks,\nlight as spun silk. His large, clear eyes were expressionless, and on\nhis disquieting beauty lay the shadow of death. And he had neither\nbrain nor heart–he was nothing but a vicious little dog, who rubbed\nhimself against people to be fondled. His great-grandmother Felicite,\nwon by this beauty, in which she affected to recognize her blood, had\nat first put him in a boarding school, taking charge of him, but he\nhad been expelled from it at the end of six months for misconduct.\nThree times she had changed his boarding school, and each time he had\nbeen expelled in disgrace. Then, as he neither would nor could learn\nanything, and as his health was declining rapidly, they kept him at\nhome, sending him from one to another of the family. Dr. Pascal, moved\nto pity, had tried to cure him, and had abandoned the hopeless task\nonly after he had kept him with him for nearly a year, fearing the\ncompanionship for Clotilde. And now, when Charles was not at his\nmother’s, where he scarcely ever lived at present, he was to be found\nat the house of Felicite, or that of some other relative, prettily\ndressed, laden with toys, living like the effeminate little dauphin of\nan ancient and fallen race.",
        "Old Mme. Rougon, however, suffered because of this bastard, and she\nhad planned to get him away from the gossiping tongues of Plassans, by\npersuading Maxime to take him and keep him with him in Paris. It would\nstill be an ugly story of the fallen family. But Maxime had for a long\ntime turned a deaf ear to her solicitations, in the fear which\ncontinually haunted him of spoiling his life. After the war, enriched\nby the death of his wife, he had come back to live prudently on his\nfortune in his mansion on the avenue of the Bois de Boulogne,\ntormented by the hereditary malady of which he was to die young,\nhaving gained from his precocious debauchery a salutary fear of\npleasure, resolved above all to shun emotions and responsibilities, so\nthat he might last as long as possible. Acute pains in the limbs,\nrheumatic he thought them, had been alarming him for some time past;\nhe saw himself in fancy already an invalid tied down to an easy-chair;\nand his father’s sudden return to France, the fresh activity which\nSaccard was putting forth, completed his disquietude. He knew well\nthis devourer of millions; he trembled at finding him again bustling\nabout him with his good-humored, malicious laugh. He felt that he was\nbeing watched, and he had the conviction that he would be cut up and\ndevoured if he should be for a single day at his mercy, rendered\nhelpless by the pains which were invading his limbs. And so great a\nfear of solitude had taken possession of him that he had now yielded\nto the idea of seeing his son again. If he found the boy gentle,\nintelligent, and healthy, why should he not take him to live with him?\nHe would thus have a companion, an heir, who would protect him against\nthe machinations of his father. Gradually he came to see himself, in\nhis selfish forethought, loved, petted, and protected; yet for all\nthat he might not have risked such a journey, if his physician had not\njust at that time sent him to the waters of St. Gervais. Thus, having\nto go only a few leagues out of his way, he had dropped in\nunexpectedly that morning on old Mme. Rougon, firmly resolved to take\nthe train again in the evening, after having questioned her and seen\nthe boy.",
        "At two o’clock Pascal and Clotilde were still beside the fountain\nunder the plane trees where they had taken their coffee, when Felicite\narrived with Maxime.",
        "“My dear, here’s a surprise! I have brought you your brother.”",
        "Startled, the young girl had risen, seeing this thin and sallow\nstranger, whom she scarcely recognized. Since their parting in 1854\nshe had seen him only twice, once at Paris and again at Plassans. Yet\nhis image, refined, elegant, and vivacious, had remained engraven on\nher mind; his face had grown hollow, his hair was streaked with silver\nthreads. But notwithstanding, she found in him still, with his\ndelicately handsome head, a languid grace, like that of a girl, even\nin his premature decrepitude.",
        "“How well you look!” he said simply, as he embraced his sister.",
        "“But,” she responded, “to be well one must live in the sunshine. Ah,\nhow happy it makes me to see you again!”",
        "Pascal, with the eye of the physician, had examined his nephew\ncritically. He embraced him in his turn.",
        "“Goodday, my boy. And she is right, mind you; one can be well only out\nin the sunshine–like the trees.”",
        "Felicite had gone hastily to the house. She returned, crying:",
        "“Charles is not here, then?”",
        "“No,” said Clotilde. “We went to see him yesterday. Uncle Macquart has\ntaken him, and he is to remain for a few days at the Tulettes.”",
        "Felicite was in despair. She had come only in the certainty of finding\nthe boy at Pascal’s. What was to be done now? The doctor, with his\ntranquil air, proposed to write to Uncle Macquart, who would bring him\nback in the morning. But when he learned that Maxime wished positively\nto go away again by the nine o’clock train, without remaining over\nnight, another idea occurred to him. He would send to the livery\nstable for a landau, and all four would go to see Charles at Uncle\nMacquart’s. It would even be a delightful drive. It was not quite\nthree leagues from Plassans to the Tulettes–an hour to go, and an\nhour to return, and they would still have almost two hours to remain\nthere, if they wished to be back by seven. Martine would get dinner,\nand Maxime would have time enough to dine and catch his train.",
        "But Felicite objected, visibly disquieted by this visit to Macquart.",
        "“Oh, no, indeed! If you think I am going down there in this frightful\nweather, you are mistaken. It is much simpler to send some one to\nbring Charles to us.”",
        "Pascal shook his head. Charles was not always to be brought back when\none wished. He was a boy without reason, who sometimes, if the whim\nseized him, would gallop off like an untamed animal. And old Mme.\nRougon, overruled and furious at having been unable to make any\npreparation, was at last obliged to yield, in the necessity in which\nshe found herself of leaving the matter to chance.",
        "“Well, be it as you wish, then! Good Heavens, how unfortunately things\nhave turned out!”",
        "Martine hurried away to order the landau, and before three o’clock had\nstruck the horses were on the Nice road, descending the declivity\nwhich slopes down to the bridge over the Viorne. Then they turned to\nthe left, and followed the wooded banks of the river for about two\nmiles. After this the road entered the gorges of the Seille, a narrow\npass between two giant walls of rock scorched by the ardent rays of\nthe summer sun. Pine trees pushed their way through the clefts; clumps\nof trees, scarcely thicker at the roots than tufts of grass, fringed\nthe crests and hung over the abyss. It was a chaos; a blasted\nlandscape, a mouth of hell, with its wild turns, its droppings of\nblood-colored earth sliding down from every cut, its desolate solitude\ninvaded only by the eagles’ flight.",
        "Felicite did not open her lips; her brain was at work, and she seemed\ncompletely absorbed in her thoughts. The atmosphere was oppressive,\nthe sun sent his burning rays from behind a veil of great livid\nclouds. Pascal was almost the only one who talked, in his passionate\nlove for this scorched land–a love which he endeavored to make his\nnephew share. But it was in vain that he uttered enthusiastic\nexclamations, in vain that he called his attention to the persistence\nof the olives, the fig trees, and the thorn bushes in pushing through\nthe rock; the life of the rock itself, that colossal and puissant\nframe of the earth, from which they could almost fancy they heard a\nsound of breathing arise. Maxime remained cold, filled with a secret\nanguish in presence of those blocks of savage majesty, whose mass\nseemed to crush him. And he preferred to turn his eyes toward his\nsister, who was seated in front of him. He was becoming more and more\ncharmed with her. She looked so healthy and so happy, with her pretty\nround head, with its straight, well-molded forehead. Now and then\ntheir glances met, and she gave him an affectionate smile which\nconsoled him.",
        "But the wildness of the gorge was beginning to soften, the two walls\nof rock to grow lower; they passed between two peaceful hills, with\ngentle slopes covered with thyme and lavender. It was the desert\nstill, there were still bare spaces, green or violet hued, from which\nthe faintest breeze brought a pungent perfume.",
        "Then abruptly, after a last turn they descended to the valley of the\nTulettes, which was refreshed by springs. In the distance stretched\nmeadows dotted by large trees. The village was seated midway on the\nslope, among olive trees, and the country house of Uncle Macquart\nstood a little apart on the left, full in view. The landau turned into\nthe road which led to the insane asylum, whose white walls they could\nsee before them in the distance.",
        "Felicite’s silence had grown somber, for she was not fond of\nexhibiting Uncle Macquart. Another whom the family would be well rid\nof the day when he should take his departure. For the credit of every\none he ought to have been sleeping long ago under the sod. But he\npersisted in living, he carried his eighty-three years well, like an\nold drunkard saturated with liquor, whom the alcohol seemed to\npreserve. At Plassans he had left a terrible reputation as a\ndo-nothing and a scoundrel, and the old men whispered the execrable\nstory of the corpses that lay between him and the Rougons, an act of\ntreachery in the troublous days of December, 1851, an ambuscade in\nwhich he had left comrades with their bellies ripped open, lying on\nthe bloody pavement. Later, when he had returned to France, he had\npreferred to the good place of which he had obtained the promise this\nlittle domain of the Tulettes, which Felicite had bought for him. And\nhe had lived comfortably here ever since; he had no longer any other\nambition than that of enlarging it, looking out once more for the good\nchances, and he had even found the means of obtaining a field which he\nhad long coveted, by making himself useful to his sister-in-law at the\ntime when the latter again reconquered Plassans from the legitimists–\nanother frightful story that was whispered also, of a madman secretly\nlet loose from the asylum, running in the night to avenge himself,\nsetting fire to his house in which four persons were burned. But these\nwere old stories and Macquart, settled down now, was no longer the\nredoubtable scoundrel who had made all the family tremble. He led a\nperfectly correct life; he was a wily diplomat, and he had retained\nnothing of his air of jeering at the world but his bantering smile.",
        "“Uncle is at home,” said Pascal, as they approached the house.",
        "This was one of those Provencal structures of a single story, with\ndiscolored tiles and four walls washed with a bright yellow. Before\nthe facade extended a narrow terrace shaded by ancient mulberry trees,\nwhose thick, gnarled branches drooped down, forming an arbor. It was\nhere that Uncle Macquart smoked his pipe in the cool shade, in summer.\nAnd on hearing the sound of the carriage, he came and stood at the\nedge of the terrace, straightening his tall form neatly clad in blue\ncloth, his head covered with the eternal fur cap which he wore from\none year’s end to the other.",
        "As soon as he recognized his visitors, he called out with a sneer:",
        "“Oh, here come some fine company! How kind of you; you are out for an\nairing.”",
        "But the presence of Maxime puzzled him. Who was he? Whom had he come\nto see? They mentioned his name to him, and he immediately cut short\nthe explanations they were adding, to enable him to straighten out the\ntangled skein of relationship.",
        "“The father of Charles–I know, I know! The son of my nephew Saccard,\npardi! the one who made a fine marriage, and whose wife died–”",
        "He stared at Maxime, seeming happy to find him already wrinkled at\nthirty-two, with his hair and beard sprinkled with snow.",
        "“Ah, well!” he added, “we are all growing old. But I, at least, have\nno great reason to complain. I am solid.”",
        "And he planted himself firmly on his legs with his air of ferocious\nmockery, while his fiery red face seemed to flame and burn. For a long\ntime past ordinary brandy had seemed to him like pure water; only\nspirits of 36 degrees tickled his blunted palate; and he took such\ndraughts of it that he was full of it–his flesh saturated with it–\nlike a sponge. He perspired alcohol. At the slightest breath whenever\nhe spoke, he exhaled from his mouth a vapor of alcohol.",
        "“Yes, truly; you are solid, uncle!” said Pascal, amazed. “And you have\ndone nothing to make you so; you have good reason to ridicule us. Only\nthere is one thing I am afraid of, look you, that some day in lighting\nyour pipe, you may set yourself on fire–like a bowl of punch.”",
        "Macquart, flattered, gave a sneering laugh.",
        "“Have your jest, have your jest, my boy! A glass of cognac is worth\nmore than all your filthy drugs. And you will all touch glasses with\nme, hey? So that it may be said truly that your uncle is a credit to\nyou all. As for me, I laugh at evil tongues. I have corn and olive\ntrees, I have almond trees and vines and land, like any bourgeois.\nIn summer I smoke my pipe under the shade of my mulberry trees; in\nwinter I go to smoke it against my wall, there in the sunshine. One\nhas no need to blush for an uncle like that, hey? Clotilde, I have\nsyrup, if you would like some. And you, Felicite, my dear, I know that\nyou prefer anisette. There is everything here, I tell you, there is\neverything here!”",
        "He waved his arm as if to take possession of the comforts he enjoyed,\nnow that from an old sinner he had become a hermit, while Felicite,\nwhom he had disturbed a moment before by the enumeration of his\nriches, did not take her eyes from his face, waiting to interrupt him.",
        "“Thank you, Macquart, we will take nothing; we are in a hurry. Where\nis Charles?”",
        "“Charles? Very good, presently! I understand, papa has come to see his\nboy. But that is not going to prevent you taking a glass.”",
        "And as they positively refused he became offended, and said, with his\nmalicious laugh:",
        "“Charles is not here; he is at the asylum with the old woman.”",
        "Then, taking Maxime to the end of the terrace, he pointed out to him\nthe great white buildings, whose inner gardens resembled prison yards.",
        "“Look, nephew, you see those three trees in front of you? Well, beyond\nthe one to the left, there is a fountain in a court. Follow the ground\nfloor, and the fifth window to the right is Aunt Dide’s. And that is\nwhere the boy is. Yes, I took him there a little while ago.”",
        "This was an indulgence of the directors. In the twenty years that she\nhad been in the asylum the old woman had not given a moment’s\nuneasiness to her keeper. Very quiet, very gentle, she passed the days\nmotionless in her easy-chair, looking straight before her; and as the\nboy liked to be with her, and as she herself seemed to take an\ninterest in him, they shut their eyes to this infraction of the rules\nand left him there sometimes for two or three hours at a time, busily\noccupied in cutting out pictures.",
        "But this new disappointment put the finishing stroke to Felicite’s\nill-humor; she grew angry when Macquart proposed that all five should\ngo in a body in search of the boy.",
        "“What an idea! Go you alone, and come back quickly. We have no time to\nlose.”",
        "Her suppressed rage seemed to amuse Uncle Macquart, and perceiving how\ndisagreeable his proposition was to her, he insisted, with his\nsneering laugh:",
        "“But, my children, we should at the same time have an opportunity of\nseeing the old mother; the mother of us all. There is no use in\ntalking; you know that we are all descended from her, and it would\nhardly be polite not to go wish her a good-day, when my grandnephew,\nwho has come from such a distance, has perhaps never before had a good\nlook at her. I’ll not disown her, may the devil take me if I do. To be\nsure she is mad, but all the same, old mothers who have passed their\nhundredth year are not often to be seen, and she well deserves that we\nshould show ourselves a little kind to her.”",
        "There was silence for a moment. A little shiver had run through every\none. And it was Clotilde, silent until now, who first declared in a\nvoice full of feeling:",
        "“You are right, uncle; we will all go.”",
        "Felicite herself was obliged to consent. They re-entered the landau,\nMacquart taking the seat beside the coachman. A feeling of disquietude\nhad given a sallow look to Maxime’s worn face; and during the short\ndrive he questioned Pascal concerning Charles with an air of paternal\ninterest, which concealed a growing anxiety. The doctor constrained by\nhis mother’s imperious glances, softened the truth. Well, the boy’s\nhealth was certainly not very robust; it was on that account, indeed,\nthat they were glad to leave him for weeks together in the country\nwith his uncle: but he had no definite disease. Pascal did not add\nthat he had for a moment cherished the dream of giving him a brain and\nmuscles by treating him with his hypodermic injections of nerve\nsubstance, but that he had always been met by the same difficulty; the\nslightest puncture brought on a hemorrhage which it was found\nnecessary to stop by compresses; there was a laxness of the tissues,\ndue to degeneracy; a bloody dew which exuded from the skin; he had\nespecially, bleedings at the nose so sudden and so violent that they\ndid not dare to leave him alone, fearing lest all the blood in his\nveins should flow out. And the doctor ended by saying that although\nthe boy’s intelligence had been sluggish, he still hoped that it would\ndevelop in an environment of quicker mental activity.",
        "They arrived at the asylum and Macquart, who had been listening to the\ndoctor, descended from his seat, saying:",
        "“He is a gentle little fellow, a very gentle little fellow! And then,\nhe is so beautiful–an angel!”",
        "Maxime, who was still pale, and who shivered in spite of the stifling\nheat, put no more questions. He looked at the vast buildings of the\nasylum, the wings of the various quarters separated by gardens, the\nmen’s quarters from those of the women, those of the harmless insane\nfrom those of the violent insane. A scrupulous cleanliness reigned\neverywhere, a gloomy silence–broken from time to time by footsteps\nand the noise of keys. Old Macquart knew all the keepers. Besides, the\ndoors were always to open to Dr. Pascal, who had been authorized to\nattend certain of the inmates. They followed a passage and entered a\ncourt; it was here–one of the chambers on the ground floor, a room\ncovered with a light carpet, furnished with a bed, a press, a table,\nan armchair, and two chairs. The nurse, who had orders never to quit\nher charge, happened just now to be absent, and the only occupants of\nthe room were the madwoman, sitting rigid in her armchair at one side\nof the table, and the boy, sitting on a chair on the opposite side,\nabsorbed in cutting out his pictures.",
        "“Go in, go in!” Macquart repeated. “Oh, there is no danger, she is\nvery gentle!”",
        "The grandmother, Adelaide Fouque, whom her grandchildren, a whole\nswarm of descendants, called by the pet name of Aunt Dide, did not\neven turn her head at the noise. In her youth hysterical troubles had\nunbalanced her mind. Of an ardent and passionate nature and subject to\nnervous attacks, she had yet reached the great age of eighty-three\nwhen a dreadful grief, a terrible moral shock, destroyed her reason.\nAt that time, twenty-one years before, her mind had ceased to act; it\nhad become suddenly weakened without the possibility of recovery. And\nnow, at the age of 104 years, she lived here as if forgotten by the\nworld, a quiet madwoman with an ossified brain, with whom insanity\nmight remain stationary for an indefinite length of time without\ncausing death. Old age had come, however, and had gradually atrophied\nher muscles. Her flesh was as if eaten away by age. The skin only\nremained on her bones, so that she had to be carried from her chair to\nher bed, for it had become impossible for her to walk or even to move.\nAnd yet she held herself erect against the back of her chair, a\nyellow, dried-up skeleton–like an ancient tree of which the bark only\nremains–with only her eyes still living in her thin, long visage, in\nwhich the wrinkles had been, so to say, worn away. She was looking\nfixedly at Charles.",
        "Clotilde approached her a little tremblingly.",
        "“Aunt Dide, it is we; we have come to see you. Don’t you know me,\nthen? Your little girl who comes sometimes to kiss you.”",
        "But the madwoman did not seem to hear. Her eyes remained fixed upon\nthe boy, who was finishing cutting out a picture–a purple king in a\ngolden mantle.",
        "“Come, mamma,” said Macquart, “don’t pretend to be stupid. You may\nvery well look at us. Here is a gentleman, a grandson of yours, who\nhas come from Paris expressly to see you.”",
        "At this voice Aunt Dide at last turned her head. Her clear,\nexpressionless eyes wandered slowly from one to another, then rested\nagain on Charles with the same fixed look as before.",
        "They all shivered, and no one spoke again.",
        "“Since the terrible shock she received,” explained Pascal in a low\nvoice, “she has been that way; all intelligence, all memory seem\nextinguished in her. For the most part she is silent; at times she\npours forth a flood of stammering and indistinct words. She laughs and\ncries without cause, she is a thing that nothing affects. And yet I\nshould not venture to say that the darkness of her mind is complete,\nthat no memories remain stored up in its depths. Ah! the poor old\nmother, how I pity her, if the light has not yet been finally\nextinguished. What can her thoughts have been for the last twenty-one\nyears, if she still remembers?”",
        "With a gesture he put this dreadful past which he knew from him. He\nsaw her again young, a tall, pale, slender girl with frightened eyes,\na widow, after fifteen months of married life with Rougon, the clumsy\ngardener whom she had chosen for a husband, throwing herself\nimmediately afterwards into the arms of the smuggler Macquart, whom\nshe loved with a wolfish love, and whom she did not even marry. She\nhad lived thus for fifteen years, with her three children, one the\nchild of her marriage, the other two illegitimate, a capricious and\ntumultuous existence, disappearing for weeks at a time, and returning\nall bruised, her arms black and blue. Then Macquart had been killed,\nshot down like a dog by a gendarme; and the first shock had\nparalyzed her, so that even then she retained nothing living but her\nwater-clear eyes in her livid face; and she shut herself up from the\nworld in the hut which her lover had left her, leading there for forty\nyears the dead existence of a nun, broken by terrible nervous attacks.\nBut the other shock was to finish her, to overthrow her reason, and\nPascal recalled the atrocious scene, for he had witnessed it–a poor\nchild whom the grandmother had taken to live with her, her grandson\nSilvere, the victim of family hatred and strife, whose head another\ngendarme shattered with a pistol shot, at the suppression of the\ninsurrectionary movement of 1851. She was always to be bespattered\nwith blood.",
        "Felicite, meanwhile, had approached Charles, who was so engrossed with\nhis pictures that all these people did not disturb him.",
        "“My darling, this gentleman is your father. Kiss him,” she said.",
        "And then they all occupied themselves with Charles. He was very\nprettily dressed in a jacket and short trousers of black velvet,\nbraided with gold cord. Pale as a lily, he resembled in truth one of\nthose king’s sons whose pictures he was cutting out, with his large,\nlight eyes and his shower of fair curls. But what especially struck\nthe attention at this moment was his resemblance to Aunt Dide; this\nresemblance which had overleaped three generations, which had passed\nfrom this withered centenarian’s countenance, from these dead features\nwasted by life, to this delicate child’s face that was also as if\nworn, aged, and wasted, through the wear of the race. Fronting each\nother, the imbecile child of a deathlike beauty seemed the last of the\nrace of which she, forgotten by the world, was the ancestress.",
        "Maxime bent over to press a kiss on the boy’s forehead; and a chill\nstruck to his heart–this very beauty disquieted him; his uneasiness\ngrew in this chamber of madness, whence, it seemed to him, breathed a\nsecret horror come from the far-off past.",
        "“How beautiful you are, my pet! Don’t you love me a little?”",
        "Charles looked at him without comprehending, and went back to his\nplay.",
        "But all were chilled. Without the set expression of her countenance\nchanging Aunt Dide wept, a flood of tears rolled from her living eyes\nover her dead cheeks. Her gaze fixed immovably upon the boy, she wept\nslowly, endlessly. A great thing had happened.",
        "And now an extraordinary emotion took possession of Pascal. He caught\nClotilde by the arm and pressed it hard, trying to make her\nunderstand. Before his eyes appeared the whole line, the legitimate\nbranch and the bastard branch, which had sprung from this trunk\nalready vitiated by neurosis. Five generations were there present–the\nRougons and the Macquarts, Adelaide Fouque at the root, then the\nscoundrelly old uncle, then himself, then Clotilde and Maxime, and\nlastly, Charles. Felicite occupied the place of her dead husband.\nThere was no link wanting; the chain of heredity, logical and\nimplacable, was unbroken. And what a world was evoked from the depths\nof the tragic cabin which breathed this horror that came from the\nfar-off past in such appalling shape that every one, notwithstanding\nthe oppressive heat, shivered.",
        "“What is it, master?” whispered Clotilde, trembling.",
        "“No, no, nothing!” murmured the doctor. “I will tell you later.”",
        "Macquart, who alone continued to sneer, scolded the old mother. What\nan idea was hers, to receive people with tears when they put\nthemselves out to come and make her a visit. It was scarcely polite.\nAnd then he turned to Maxime and Charles.",
        "“Well, nephew, you have seen your boy at last. Is it not true that he\nis pretty, and that he is a credit to you, after all?”",
        "Felicite hastened to interfere. Greatly dissatisfied with the turn\nwhich affairs were taking, she was now anxious only to get away.",
        "“He is certainly a handsome boy, and less backward than people think.\nJust see how skilful he is with his hands. And you will see when you\nhave brightened him up in Paris, in a different way from what we have\nbeen able to do at Plassans, eh?”",
        "“No doubt,” murmured Maxime. “I do not say no; I will think about it.”",
        "He seemed embarrassed for a moment, and then added:",
        "“You know I came only to see him. I cannot take him with me now as I\nam to spend a month at St. Gervais. But as soon as I return to Paris I\nwill think of it, I will write to you.”",
        "Then, taking out his watch, he cried:",
        "“The devil! Half-past five. You know that I would not miss the nine\no’clock train for anything in the world.”",
        "“Yes, yes, let us go,” said Felicite brusquely. “We have nothing more\nto do here.”",
        "Macquart, whom his sister-in-law’s anger seemed still to divert,\nendeavored to delay them with all sorts of stories. He told of the\ndays when Aunt Dide talked, and he affirmed that he had found her one\nmorning singing a romance of her youth. And then he had no need of the\ncarriage, he would take the boy back on foot, since they left him to\nhim.",
        "“Kiss your papa, my boy, for you know now that you see him, but you\ndon’t know whether you shall ever see him again or not.”",
        "With the same surprised and indifferent movement Charles raised his\nhead, and Maxime, troubled, pressed another kiss on his forehead.",
        "“Be very good and very pretty, my pet. And love me a little.”",
        "“Come, come, we have no time to lose,” repeated Felicite.",
        "But the keeper here re-entered the room. She was a stout, vigorous\ngirl, attached especially to the service of the madwoman. She carried\nher to and from her bed, night and morning; she fed her and took care\nof her like a child. And she at once entered into conversation with\nDr. Pascal, who questioned her. One of the doctor’s most cherished\ndreams was to cure the mad by his treatment of hypodermic injections.\nSince in their case it was the brain that was in danger, why should\nnot hypodermic injections of nerve substance give them strength and\nwill, repairing the breaches made in the organ? So that for a moment\nhe had dreamed of trying the treatment with the old mother; then he\nbegan to have scruples, he felt a sort of awe, without counting that\nmadness at that age was total, irreparable ruin. So that he had chosen\nanother subject–a hatter named Sarteur, who had been for a year past\nin the asylum, to which he had come himself to beg them to shut him up\nto prevent him from committing a crime. In his paroxysms, so strong an\nimpulse to kill seized him that he would have thrown himself upon the\nfirst passer-by. He was of small stature, very dark, with a retreating\nforehead, an aquiline face with a large nose and a very short chin,\nand his left cheek was noticeably larger than his right. And the\ndoctor had obtained miraculous results with this victim of emotional\ninsanity, who for a month past had had no attack. The nurse, indeed\nbeing questioned, answered that Sarteur had become quiet and was\ngrowing better every day.",
        "“Do you hear, Clotilde?” cried Pascal, enchanted. “I have not the time\nto see him this evening, but I will come again to-morrow. It is my\nvisiting day. Ah, if I only dared; if she were young still–”",
        "His eyes turned toward Aunt Dide. But Clotilde, whom his enthusiasm\nmade smile, said gently:",
        "“No, no, master, you cannot make life anew. There, come. We are the\nlast.”",
        "It was true; the others had already gone. Macquart, on the threshold,\nfollowed Felicite and Maxime with his mocking glance as they went\naway. Aunt Dide, the forgotten one, sat motionless, appalling in her\nleanness, her eyes again fixed upon Charles with his white, worn face\nframed in his royal locks.",
        "The drive back was full of constraint. In the heat which exhaled from\nthe earth, the landau rolled on heavily to the measured trot of the\nhorses. The stormy sky took on an ashen, copper-colored hue in the\ndeepening twilight. At first a few indifferent words were exchanged;\nbut from the moment in which they entered the gorges of the Seille all\nconversation ceased, as if they felt oppressed by the menacing walls\nof giant rock that seemed closing in upon them. Was not this the end\nof the earth, and were they not going to roll into the unknown, over\nthe edge of some abyss? An eagle soared by, uttering a shrill cry.",
        "Willows appeared again, and the carriage was rolling lightly along the\nbank of the Viorne, when Felicite began without transition, as if she\nwere resuming a conversation already commenced.",
        "“You have no refusal to fear from the mother. She loves Charles\ndearly, but she is a very sensible woman, and she understands\nperfectly that it is to the boy’s advantage that you should take him\nwith you. And I must tell you, too, that the poor boy is not very\nhappy with her, since, naturally, the husband prefers his own son and\ndaughter. For you ought to know everything.”",
        "And she went on in this strain, hoping, no doubt, to persuade Maxime\nand draw a formal promise from him. She talked until they reached\nPlassans. Then, suddenly, as the landau rolled over the pavement of\nthe faubourg, she said:",
        "“But look! there is his mother. That stout blond at the door there.”",
        "At the threshold of a harness-maker’s shop hung round with horse\ntrappings and halters, Justine sat, knitting a stocking, taking the\nair, while the little girl and boy were playing on the ground at her\nfeet. And behind them in the shadow of the shop was to be seen Thomas,\na stout, dark man, occupied in repairing a saddle.",
        "Maxime leaned forward without emotion, simply curious. He was greatly\nsurprised at sight of this robust woman of thirty-two, with so\nsensible and so commonplace an air, in whom there was not a trace of\nthe wild little girl with whom he had been in love when both of the\nsame age were entering their seventeenth year. Perhaps a pang shot\nthrough his heart to see her plump and tranquil and blooming, while he\nwas ill and already aged.",
        "“I should never have recognized her,” he said.",
        "And the landau, still rolling on, turned into the Rue de Rome. Justine\nhad disappeared; this vision of the past–a past so different from the\npresent–had sunk into the shadowy twilight, with Thomas, the\nchildren, and the shop.",
        "At La Souleiade the table was set; Martine had an eel from the Viorne,\na sauted rabbit, and a leg of mutton. Seven o’clock was striking,\nand they had plenty of time to dine quietly.",
        "“Don’t be uneasy,” said Dr. Pascal to his nephew. “We will accompany\nyou to the station; it is not ten minutes’ walk from here. As you left\nyour trunk, you have nothing to do but to get your ticket and jump on\nboard the train.”",
        "Then, meeting Clotilde in the vestibule, where she was hanging up her\nhat and her umbrella, he said to her in an undertone:",
        "“Do you know that I am uneasy about your brother?”",
        "“Why so?”",
        "“I have observed him attentively. I don’t like the way in which he\nwalks; and have you noticed what an anxious look he has at times? That\nhas never deceived me. In short, your brother is threatened with\nataxia.”",
        "“Ataxia!” she repeated turning very pale.",
        "A cruel image rose before her, that of a neighbor, a man still young,\nwhom for the past ten years she had seen driven about in a little\ncarriage by a servant. Was not this infirmity the worst of all ills,\nthe ax stroke that separates a living being from social and active\nlife?",
        "“But,” she murmured, “he complains only of rheumatism.”",
        "Pascal shrugged his shoulders; and putting a finger to his lip he went\ninto the dining-room, where Felicite and Maxime were seated.",
        "The dinner was very friendly. The sudden disquietude which had sprung\nup in Clotilde’s heart made her still more affectionate to her\nbrother, who sat beside her. She attended to his wants gayly, forcing\nhim to take the most delicate morsels. Twice she called back Martine,\nwho was passing the dishes too quickly. And Maxime was more and more\nenchanted by this sister, who was so good, so healthy, so sensible,\nwhose charm enveloped him like a caress. So greatly was he captivated\nby her that gradually a project, vague at first, took definite shape\nwithin him. Since little Charles, his son, terrified him so greatly\nwith his deathlike beauty, his royal air of sickly imbecility, why\nshould he not take his sister Clotilde to live with him? The idea of\nhaving a woman in his house alarmed him, indeed, for he was afraid of\nall women, having had too much experience of them in his youth; but\nthis one seemed to him truly maternal. And then, too, a good woman in\nhis house would make a change in it, which would be a desirable thing.\nHe would at least be left no longer at the mercy of his father, whom\nhe suspected of desiring his death so that he might get possession of\nhis money at once. His hatred and terror of his father decided him.",
        "“Don’t you think of marrying, then?” he asked, wishing to try the\nground.",
        "The young girl laughed.",
        "“Oh, there is no hurry,” she answered.",
        "Then, suddenly, looking at Pascal, who had raised his head, she added:",
        "“How can I tell? Oh, I shall never marry.”",
        "But Felicite protested. When she saw her so attached to the doctor,\nshe often wished for a marriage that would separate her from him, that\nwould leave her son alone in a deserted home, where she herself might\nbecome all powerful, mistress of everything. Therefore she appealed to\nhim. Was it not true that a woman ought to marry, that it was against\nnature to remain an old maid?",
        "And he gravely assented, without taking his eyes from Clotilde’s face.",
        "“Yes, yes, she must marry. She is too sensible not to marry.”",
        "“Bah!” interrupted Maxime, “would it be really sensible in her to\nmarry? In order to be unhappy, perhaps; there are so many ill-assorted\nmarriages!”",
        "And coming to a resolution, he added:",
        "“Don’t you know what you ought to do? Well, you ought to come and live\nwith me in Paris. I have thought the matter over. The idea of taking\ncharge of a child in my state of health terrifies me. Am I not a child\nmyself, an invalid who needs to be taken care of? You will take care\nof me; you will be with me, if I should end by losing the use of my\nlimbs.”",
        "There was a sound of tears in his voice, so great a pity did he feel\nfor himself. He saw himself, in fancy, sick; he saw his sister at his\nbedside, like a Sister of Charity; if she consented to remain\nunmarried he would willingly leave her his fortune, so that his father\nmight not have it. The dread which he had of solitude, the need in\nwhich he should perhaps stand of having a sick-nurse, made him very\npathetic.",
        "“It would be very kind on your part, and you should have no cause to\nrepent it.”",
        "Martine, who was serving the mutton, stopped short in surprise; and\nthe proposition caused the same surprise at the table. Felicite was\nthe first to approve, feeling that the girl’s departure would further\nher plans. She looked at Clotilde, who was still silent and stunned,\nas it were; while Dr. Pascal waited with a pale face.",
        "“Oh, brother, brother,” stammered the young girl, unable at first to\nthink of anything else to say.",
        "Then her grandmother cried:",
        "“Is that all you have to say? Why, the proposition your brother has\njust made you is a very advantageous one. If he is afraid of taking\nCharles now, why, you can go with him, and later on you can send for\nthe child. Come, come, that can be very well arranged. Your brother\nmakes an appeal to your heart. Is it not true, Pascal, that she owes\nhim a favorable answer?”",
        "The doctor, by an effort, recovered his self-possession. The chill\nthat had seized him made itself felt, however, in the slowness with\nwhich he spoke.",
        "“The offer, in effect, is very kind. Clotilde, as I said before, is\nvery sensible and she will accept it, if it is right that she should\ndo so.”",
        "The young girl, greatly agitated, rebelled at this.",
        "“Do you wish to send me away, then, master? Maxime is very good, and I\nthank him from the bottom of my heart. But to leave everything, my\nGod! To leave all that love me, all that I have loved until now!”",
        "She made a despairing gesture, indicating the place and the people,\ntaking in all La Souleiade.",
        "“But,” responded Pascal, looking at her fixedly, “what if Maxime\nshould need you, what if you had a duty to fulfil toward him?”",
        "Her eyes grew moist, and she remained for a moment trembling and\ndesperate; for she alone understood. The cruel vision again arose\nbefore her–Maxime, helpless, driven, about in a little carriage by a\nservant, like the neighbor whom she used to pity. Had she indeed any\nduty toward a brother who for fifteen years had been a stranger to\nher? Did not her duty lie where her heart was? Nevertheless, her\ndistress of mind continued; she still suffered in the struggle.",
        "“Listen, Maxime,” she said at last, “give me also time to reflect. I\nwill see. Be assured that I am very grateful to you. And if you should\none day really have need of me, well, I should no doubt decide to go.”",
        "This was all they could make her promise. Felicite, with her usual\nvehemence, exhausted all her efforts in vain, while the doctor now\naffected to say that she had given her word. Martine brought a cream,\nwithout thinking of hiding her joy. To take away mademoiselle! what an\nidea, in order that monsieur might die of grief at finding himself all\nalone. And the dinner was delayed, too, by this unexpected incident.\nThey were still at the dessert when half-past eight struck.",
        "Then Maxime grew restless, tapped the floor with his foot, and\ndeclared that he must go.",
        "At the station, whither they all accompanied him he kissed his sister\na last time, saying:",
        "“Remember!”",
        "“Don’t be afraid,” declared Felicite, “we are here to remind her of\nher promise.”",
        "The doctor smiled, and all three, as soon as the train was in motion,\nwaved their handkerchiefs.",
        "On this day, after accompanying the grandmother to her door, Dr.\nPascal and Clotilde returned peacefully to La Souleiade, and spent a\ndelightful evening there. The constraint of the past few weeks, the\nsecret antagonism which had separated them, seemed to have vanished.\nNever had it seemed so sweet to them to feel so united, inseparable.\nDoubtless it was only this first pang of uneasiness suffered by their\naffection, this threatened separation, the postponement of which\ndelighted them. It was for them like a return to health after an\nillness, a new hope of life. They remained for long time in the warm\nnight, under the plane trees, listening to the crystal murmur of the\nfountain. And they did not even speak, so profoundly did they enjoy\nthe happiness of being together.",
        "Ten days later the household had fallen back into its former state of\nunhappiness. Pascal and Clotilde remained entire afternoons without\nexchanging a word; and there were continual outbursts of ill-humor.\nEven Martine was constantly out of temper. The home of these three had\nagain become a hell.",
        "Then suddenly the condition of affairs was still further aggravated. A\nCapuchin monk of great sanctity, such as often pass through the towns\nof the South, came to Plassans to conduct a mission. The pulpit of St.\nSaturnin resounded with his bursts of eloquence. He was a sort of\napostle, a popular and fiery orator, a florid speaker, much given to\nthe use of metaphors. And he preached on the nothingness of modern\nscience with an extraordinary mystical exaltation, denying the reality\nof this world, and disclosing the unknown, the mysteries of the\nBeyond. All the devout women of the town were full of excitement about\nhis preaching.",
        "On the very first evening on which Clotilde, accompanied by Martine,\nattended the sermon, Pascal noticed her feverish excitement when she\nreturned. On the following day her excitement increased, and she\nreturned home later, having remained to pray for an hour in a dark\ncorner of a chapel. From this time she was never absent from the\nservices, returning languid, and with the luminous eyes of a seer; and\nthe Capuchin’s burning words haunted her; certain of his images\nstirred her to ecstasy. She grew irritable, and she seemed to have\nconceived a feeling of anger and contempt for every one and everything\naround her.",
        "Pascal, filled with uneasiness, determined to have an explanation with\nMartine. He came down early one morning as she was sweeping the\ndining-room.",
        "“You know that I leave you and Clotilde free to go to church, if that\npleases you,” he said. “I do not believe in oppressing any one’s\nconscience. But I do not wish that you should make her sick.”",
        "The servant, without stopping in her work, said in a low voice:",
        "“Perhaps the sick people are those who don’t think that they are\nsick.”",
        "She said this with such an air of conviction that he smiled.",
        "“Yes,” he returned; “I am the sick soul whose conversion you pray for;\nwhile both of you are in possession of health and of perfect wisdom.\nMartine, if you continue to torment me and to torment yourselves, as\nyou are doing, I shall grow angry.”",
        "He spoke in so furious and so harsh a voice that the servant stopped\nsuddenly in her sweeping, and looked him full in the face. An infinite\ntenderness, an immense desolation passed over the face of the old maid\ncloistered in his service. And tears filled her eyes and she hurried\nout of the room stammering:",
        "“Ah, monsieur, you do not love us.”",
        "Then Pascal, filled with an overwhelming sadness, gave up the contest.\nHis remorse increased for having shown so much tolerance, for not\nhaving exercised his authority as master, in directing Clotilde’s\neducation and bringing up. In his belief that trees grew straight if\nthey were not interfered with, he had allowed her to grow up in her\nown way, after teaching her merely to read and write. It was without\nany preconceived plan, while aiding him in making his researches and\ncorrecting his manuscripts, and simply by the force of circumstances,\nthat she had read everything and acquired a fondness for the natural\nsciences. How bitterly he now regretted his indifference! What a\npowerful impulse he might have given to this clear mind, so eager for\nknowledge, instead of allowing it to go astray, and waste itself in\nthat desire for the Beyond, which Grandmother Felicite and the good\nMartine favored. While he had occupied himself with facts, endeavoring\nto keep from going beyond the phenomenon, and succeeding in doing so,\nthrough his scientific discipline, he had seen her give all her\nthoughts to the unknown, the mysterious. It was with her an obsession,\nan instinctive curiosity which amounted to torture when she could not\nsatisfy it. There was in her a longing which nothing could appease, an\nirresistible call toward the unattainable, the unknowable. Even when\nshe was a child, and still more, later, when she grew up, she went\nstraight to the why and the how of things, she demanded ultimate\ncauses. If he showed her a flower, she asked why this flower produced\na seed, why this seed would germinate. Then, it would be the mystery\nof birth and death, and the unknown forces, and God, and all things.\nIn half a dozen questions she would drive him into a corner, obliging\nhim each time to acknowledge his fatal ignorance; and when he no\nlonger knew what to answer her, when he would get rid of her with a\ngesture of comic fury, she would give a gay laugh of triumph, and go\nto lose herself again in her dreams, in the limitless vision of all\nthat we do not know, and all that we may believe. Often she astounded\nhim by her explanations. Her mind, nourished on science, started from\nproved truths, but with such an impetus that she bounded at once\nstraight into the heaven of the legends. All sorts of mediators passed\nthere, angels and saints and supernatural inspirations, modifying\nmatter, endowing it with life; or, again, it was only one single\nforce, the soul of the world, working to fuse things and beings in a\nfinal kiss of love in fifty centuries more. She had calculated the\nnumber of them, she said.",
        "For the rest, Pascal had never before seen her so excited. For the\npast week, during which she had attended the Capuchin’s mission in the\ncathedral, she had spent the days visibly in the expectation of the\nsermon of the evening; and she went to hear it with the rapt\nexaltation of a girl who is going to her first rendezvous of love.\nThen, on the following day, everything about her declared her\ndetachment from the exterior life, from her accustomed existence, as\nif the visible world, the necessary actions of every moment, were but\na snare and a folly. She retired within herself in the vision of what\nwas not. Thus she had almost completely given up her habitual\noccupations, abandoning herself to a sort of unconquerable indolence,\nremaining for hours at a time with her hands in her lap, her gaze lost\nin vacancy, rapt in the contemplation of some far-off vision. Now she,\nwho had been so active, so early a riser, rose late, appearing barely\nin time for the second breakfast, and it could not have been at her\ntoilet that she spent these long hours, for she forgot her feminine\ncoquetry, and would come down with her hair scarcely combed,\nnegligently attired in a gown buttoned awry, but even thus adorable,\nthanks to her triumphant youth. The morning walks through La Souleiade\nthat she had been so fond of, the races from the top to the bottom of\nthe terraces planted with olive and almond trees, the visits to the\npine grove balmy with the odor of resin, the long sun baths in the hot\nthreshing yard, she indulged in no more; she preferred to remain shut\nup in her darkened room, from which not a movement was to be heard.\nThen, in the afternoon, in the work room, she would drag herself about\nlanguidly from chair to chair, doing nothing, tired and disgusted with\neverything that had formerly interested her.",
        "Pascal was obliged to renounce her assistance; a paper which he gave\nher to copy remained three days untouched on her desk. She no longer\nclassified anything; she would not have stooped down to pick up a\npaper from the floor. More than all, she abandoned the pastels, copies\nof flowers from nature that she had been making, to serve as plates to\na work on artificial fecundations. Some large red mallows, of a new\nand singular coloring, faded in their vase before she had finished\ncopying them. And yet for a whole afternoon she worked\nenthusiastically at a fantastic design of dream flowers, an\nextraordinary efflorescence blooming in the light of a miraculous sun,\na burst of golden spike-shaped rays in the center of large purple\ncorollas, resembling open hearts, whence shot, for pistils, a shower\nof stars, myriads of worlds streaming into the sky, like a milky way.",
        "“Ah, my poor girl,” said the doctor to her on this day, “how can you\nlose your time in such conceits! And I waiting for the copy of those\nmallows that you have left to die there. And you will make yourself\nill. There is no health, nor beauty, even, possible outside reality.”",
        "Often now she did not answer, intrenching herself behind her fierce\nconvictions, not wishing to dispute. But doubtless he had this time\ntouched her beliefs to the quick.",
        "“There is no reality,” she answered sharply.",
        "The doctor, amused by this bold philosophy from this big child,\nlaughed.",
        "“Yes, I know,” he said; “our senses are fallible. We know this world\nonly through our senses, consequently it is possible that the world\ndoes not exist. Let us open the door to madness, then; let us accept\nas possible the most absurd chimeras, let us live in the realm of\nnightmare, outside of laws and facts. For do you not see that there is\nno longer any law if you suppress nature, and that the only thing that\ngives life any interest is to believe in life, to love it, and to put\nall the forces of our intelligence to the better understanding of it?”",
        "She made a gesture of mingled indifference and bravado, and the\nconversation dropped. Now she was laying large strokes of blue crayon\non the pastel, bringing out its flaming splendor in strong relief on\nthe background of a clear summer night.",
        "But two days later, in consequence of a fresh discussion, matters went\nstill further amiss. In the evening, on leaving the table, Pascal went\nup to the study to write, while she remained out of doors, sitting on\nthe terrace. Hours passed by, and he was surprised and uneasy, when\nmidnight struck, that he had not yet heard her return to her room. She\nwould have had to pass through the study, and he was very certain that\nshe had not passed unnoticed by him. Going downstairs, he found that\nMartine was asleep; the vestibule door was not locked, and Clotilde\nmust have remained outside, oblivious of the flight of time. This\noften happened to her on these warm nights, but she had never before\nremained out so late.",
        "The doctor’s uneasiness increased when he perceived on the terrace the\nchair, now vacant, in which the young girl had been sitting. He had\nexpected to find her asleep in it. Since she was not there, why had\nshe not come in. Where could she have gone at such an hour? The night\nwas beautiful: a September night, still warm, with a wide sky whose\ndark, velvety expanse was studded with stars; and from the depths of\nthis moonless sky the stars shone so large and bright that they\nlighted the earth with a pale, mysterious radiance. He leaned over the\nbalustrade of the terrace, and examined the slope and the stone steps\nwhich led down to the railroad; but there was not a movement. He saw\nnothing but the round motionless tops of the little olive trees. The\nidea then occurred to him that she must certainly be under the plane\ntrees beside the fountain, whose murmuring waters made perpetual\ncoolness around. He hurried there, and found himself enveloped in such\nthick darkness that he, who knew every tree, was obliged to walk with\noutstretched hands to avoid stumbling. Then he groped his way through\nthe dark pine grove, still without meeting any one. And at last he\ncalled in a muffled voice:",
        "“Clotilde! Clotilde!”",
        "The darkness remained silent and impenetrable.",
        "“Clotilde! Clotilde!” he cried again, in a louder voice. Not a sound,\nnot a breath. The very echoes seemed asleep. His cry was drowned in\nthe infinitely soft lake of blue shadows. And then he called her with\nall the force of his lungs. He returned to the plane trees. He went\nback to the pine grove, beside himself with fright, scouring the\nentire domain. Then, suddenly, he found himself in the threshing yard.",
        "At this cool and tranquil hour, the immense yard, the vast circular\npaved court, slept too. It was so many years since grain had been\nthreshed here that grass had sprung up among the stones, quickly\nscorched a russet brown by the sun, resembling the long threads of a\nwoolen carpet. And, under the tufts of this feeble vegetation, the\nancient pavement did not cool during the whole summer, smoking from\nsunset, exhaling in the night the heat stored up from so many sultry\nnoons.",
        "The yard stretched around, bare and deserted, in the cooling\natmosphere, under the infinite calm of the sky, and Pascal was\ncrossing it to hurry to the orchard, when he almost fell over a form\nthat he had not before observed, extended at full length upon the\nground. He uttered a frightened cry.",
        "“What! Are you here?”",
        "Clotilde did not deign even to answer. She was lying on her back, her\nhands clasped under the back of her neck, her face turned toward the\nsky; and in her pale countenance, only her large shining eyes were\nvisible.",
        "“And here I have been tormenting myself and calling you for an hour\npast! Did you not hear me shouting?”",
        "She at last unclosed her lips.",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Then that is very senseless! Why did you not answer me?”",
        "But she fell back into her former silence, refusing all explanation,\nand with a stubborn brow kept her gaze fixed steadily on the sky.",
        "“There, come in and go to bed, naughty child. You will tell me\nto-morrow.”",
        "She did not stir, however; he begged her ten times over to go into the\nhouse, but she would not move. He ended by sitting down beside her on\nthe short grass, through which penetrated the warmth of the pavement\nbeneath.",
        "“But you cannot sleep out of doors. At least answer me. What are you\ndoing here?”",
        "“I am looking.”",
        "And from her large eyes, fixed and motionless, her gaze seemed to\nmount up among the stars. She seemed wholly absorbed in the\ncontemplation of the pure starry depths of the summer sky.",
        "“Ah, master!” she continued, in a low monotone; “how narrow and\nlimited is all that you know compared to what there is surely up\nthere. Yes, if I did not answer you it was because I was thinking of\nyou, and I was filled with grief. You must not think me bad.”",
        "In her voice there was a thrill of such tenderness that it moved him\nprofoundly. He stretched himself on the grass beside her, so that\ntheir elbows touched, and they went on talking.",
        "“I greatly fear, my dear, that your griefs are not rational. It gives\nyou pain to think of me. Why so?”",
        "“Oh, because of things that I should find it hard to explain to you; I\nam not a savante. You have taught me much, however, and I have\nlearned more myself, being with you. Besides, they are things that I\nfeel. Perhaps I might try to tell them to you, as we are all alone\nhere, and the night is so beautiful.”",
        "Her full heart overflowed, after hours of meditation, in the peaceful\nconfidence of the beautiful night. He did not speak, fearing to\ndisturb her, but awaited her confidences in silence.",
        "“When I was a little girl and you used to talk to me about science, it\nseemed to me that you were speaking to me of God, your words burned so\nwith faith and hope. Nothing seemed impossible to you. With science\nyou were going to penetrate the secret of the world, and make the\nperfect happiness of humanity a reality. According to you, we were\nprogressing with giant strides. Each day brought its discovery, its\ncertainty. Ten, fifty, a hundred years more, perhaps, and the heavens\nwould open and we should see truth face to face. Well, the years pass,\nand nothing opens, and truth recedes.”",
        "“You are an impatient girl,” he answered simply. “If ten centuries\nmore be necessary we must only wait for them to pass.”",
        "“It is true. I cannot wait. I need to know; I need to be happy at\nonce, and to know everything at once, and to be perfectly and forever\nhappy. Oh, that is what makes me suffer, not to be able to reach at a\nbound complete knowledge, not to be able to rest in perfect felicity,\nfreed from scruples and doubts. Is it living to advance with\ntortoiselike pace in the darkness, not to be able to enjoy an hour’s\ntranquillity, without trembling at the thought of the coming anguish?\nNo, no! All knowledge and all happiness in a single day? Science has\npromised them to us, and if she does not give them to us, then she\nfails in her engagements.”",
        "Then he, too, began to grow heated.",
        "“But what you are saying is folly, little girl. Science is not\nrevelation. It marches at its human pace, its very effort is its\nglory. And then it is not true that science has promised happiness.”",
        "She interrupted him hastily.",
        "“How, not true! Open your books up there, then. You know that I have\nread them. Do they not overflow with promises? To read them one would\nthink we were marching on to the conquest of earth and heaven. They\ndemolish everything, and they swear to replace everything–and that by\npure reason, with stability and wisdom. Doubtless I am like the\nchildren. When I am promised anything I wish that it shall be given me\nat once. My imagination sets to work, and the object must be very\nbeautiful to satisfy me. But it would have been easy not to have\npromised anything. And above all, at this hour, in view of my eager\nand painful longing, it would be very ill done to tell me that nothing\nhas been promised me.”",
        "He made a gesture, a simple gesture of protestation and impatience, in\nthe serene and silent night.",
        "“In any case,” she continued, “science has swept away all our past\nbeliefs. The earth is bare, the heavens are empty, and what do you\nwish that I should become, even if you acquit science of having\ninspired the hopes I have conceived? For I cannot live without belief\nand without happiness. On what solid ground shall I build my house\nwhen science shall have demolished the old world, and while she is\nwaiting to construct the new? All the ancient city has fallen to\npieces in this catastrophe of examination and analysis; and all that\nremains of it is a mad population vainly seeking a shelter among its\nruins, while anxiously looking for a solid and permanent refuge where\nthey may begin life anew. You must not be surprised, then, at our\ndiscouragement and our impatience. We can wait no longer. Since tardy\nscience has failed in her promises, we prefer to fall back on the old\nbeliefs, which for centuries have sufficed for the happiness of the\nworld.”",
        "“Ah! that is just it,” he responded in a low voice; “we are just at\nthe turning point, at the end of the century, fatigued and exhausted\nwith the appalling accumulation of knowledge which it has set moving.\nAnd it is the eternal need for falsehood, the eternal need for\nillusion which distracts humanity, and throws it back upon the\ndelusive charm of the unknown. Since we can never know all, what is\nthe use of trying to know more than we know already? Since the truth,\nwhen we have attained it, does not confer immediate and certain\nhappiness, why not be satisfied with ignorance, the darkened cradle in\nwhich humanity slept the deep sleep of infancy? Yes, this is the\naggressive return of the mysterious, it is the reaction against a\ncentury of experimental research. And this had to be; desertions were\nto be expected, since every need could not be satisfied at once. But\nthis is only a halt; the onward march will continue, up there, beyond\nour view, in the illimitable fields of space.”",
        "For a moment they remained silent, still motionless on their backs,\ntheir gaze lost among the myriads of worlds shining in the dark sky. A\nfalling star shot across the constellation of Cassiopeia, like a\nflaming arrow. And the luminous universe above turned slowly on its\naxis, in solemn splendor, while from the dark earth around them arose\nonly a faint breath, like the soft, warm breath of a sleeping woman.",
        "“Tell me,” he said, in his good-natured voice, “did your Capuchin turn\nyour head this evening, then?”",
        "“Yes,” she answered frankly; “he says from the pulpit things that\ndisturb me. He preaches against everything you have taught me, and it\nis as if the knowledge which I owe to you, transformed into a poison,\nwere consuming me. My God! What is going to become of me?”",
        "“My poor child! It is terrible that you should torture yourself in\nthis way! And yet I had been quite tranquil about you, for you have a\nwell-balanced mind–you have a good, little, round, clear, solid\nheadpiece, as I have often told you. You will soon calm down. But what\nconfusion in the brains of others, at the end of the century, if you,\nwho are so sane, are troubled! Have you not faith, then?”",
        "She answered only by a heavy sigh.",
        "“Assuredly, viewed from the standpoint of happiness, faith is a strong\nstaff for the traveler to lean upon, and the march becomes easy and\ntranquil when one is fortunate enough to possess it.”",
        "“Oh, I no longer know whether I believe or not!” she cried. “There are\ndays when I believe, and there are other days when I side with you and\nwith your books. It is you who have disturbed me; it is through you I\nsuffer. And perhaps all my suffering springs from this, from my revolt\nagainst you whom I love. No, no! tell me nothing; do not tell me that\nI shall soon calm down. At this moment that would only irritate me\nstill more. I know well that you deny the supernatural. The mysterious\nfor you is only the inexplicable. Even you concede that we shall never\nknow all; and therefore you consider that the only interest life can\nhave is the continual conquest over the unknown, the eternal effort to\nknow more. Ah, I know too much already to believe. You have already\nsucceeded but too well in shaking my faith, and there are times when\nit seems to me that this will kill me.”",
        "He took her hand that lay on the still warm grass, and pressed it\nhard.",
        "“No, no; it is life that frightens you, little girl. And how right you\nare in saying that happiness consists in continual effort. For from\nthis time forward tranquil ignorance is impossible. There is no halt\nto be looked for, no tranquillity in renunciation and wilful\nblindness. We must go on, go on in any case with life, which goes on\nalways. Everything that is proposed, a return to the past, to dead\nreligions, patched up religions arranged to suit new wants, is a\nsnare. Learn to know life, then; to love it, live it as it ought to be\nlived–that is the only wisdom.”",
        "But she shook off his hand angrily. And her voice trembled with\nvexation.",
        "“Life is horrible. How do you wish me to live it tranquil and happy?\nIt is a terrible light that your science throws upon the world. Your\nanalysis opens up all the wounds of humanity to display their horror.\nYou tell everything; you speak too plainly; you leave us nothing but\ndisgust for people and for things, without any possible consolation.”",
        "He interrupted her with a cry of ardent conviction.",
        "“We tell everything. Ah, yes; in order to know everything and to\nremedy everything!”",
        "Her anger rose, and she sat erect.",
        "“If even equality and justice existed in your nature–but you\nacknowledge it yourself, life is for the strongest, the weak\ninfallibly perishes because he is weak–there are no two beings equal,\neither in health, in beauty, or intelligence; everything is left to\nhaphazard meeting, to the chance of selection. And everything falls\ninto ruin, when grand and sacred justice ceases to exist.”",
        "“It is true,” he said, in an undertone, as if speaking to himself,\n\"there is no such thing as equality. No society based upon it could\ncontinue to exist. For centuries, men thought to remedy evil by\ncharacter. But that idea is being exploded, and now they propose\njustice. Is nature just? I think her logical, rather. Logic is perhaps\na natural and higher justice, going straight to the sum of the common\nlabor, to the grand final labor.”",
        "“Then it is justice,” she cried, “that crushes the individual for the\nhappiness of the race, that destroys an enfeebled species to fatten\nthe victorious species. No, no; that is crime. There is in that only\nfoulness and murder. He was right this evening in the church. The\nearth is corrupt, science only serves to show its rottenness. It is on\nhigh that we must all seek a refuge. Oh, master, I entreat you, let me\nsave myself, let me save you!”",
        "She burst into tears, and the sound of her sobs rose despairingly on\nthe stillness of the night. He tried in vain to soothe her, her voice\ndominated his.",
        "“Listen to me, master. You know that I love you, for you are\neverything to me. And it is you who are the cause of all my suffering.\nI can scarcely endure it when I think that we are not in accord, that\nwe should be separated forever if we were both to die to-morrow. Why\nwill you not believe?”",
        "He still tried to reason with her.",
        "“Come, don’t be foolish, my dear–”",
        "But she threw herself on her knees, she seized him by the hands, she\nclung to him with a feverish force. And she sobbed louder and louder,\nin such a clamor of despair that the dark fields afar off were\nstartled by it.",
        "“Listen to me, he said it in the church. You must change your life and\ndo penance; you must burn everything belonging to your past errors–\nyour books, your papers, your manuscripts. Make this sacrifice,\nmaster, I entreat it of you on my knees. And you will see the\ndelightful existence we shall lead together.”",
        "At last he rebelled.",
        "“No, this is too much. Be silent!”",
        "“If you listen to me, master, you will do what I wish. I assure you\nthat I am horribly unhappy, even in loving you as I love you. There is\nsomething wanting in our affection. So far it has been profound but\nunavailing, and I have an irresistible longing to fill it, oh, with\nall that is divine and eternal. What can be wanting to us but God?\nKneel down and pray with me!”",
        "With an abrupt movement he released himself, angry in his turn.",
        "“Be silent; you are talking nonsense. I have left you free, leave me\nfree.”",
        "“Master, master! it is our happiness that I desire! I will take you\nfar, far away. We will go to some solitude to live there in God!”",
        "“Be silent! No, never!”",
        "Then they remained for a moment confronting each other, mute and\nmenacing. Around them stretched La Souleiade in the deep silence of\nthe night, with the light shadows of its olive trees, the darkness of\nits pine and plane trees, in which the saddened voice of the fountain\nwas singing, and above their heads it seemed as if the spacious sky,\nstudded with stars, shuddered and grew pale, although the dawn was\nstill far off.",
        "Clotilde raised her arm as if to point to this infinite, shuddering\nsky; but with a quick gesture Pascal seized her hand and drew it down\ntoward the earth in his. And no word further was spoken; they were\nbeside themselves with rage and hate. The quarrel was fierce and\nbitter.",
        "She drew her hand away abruptly, and sprang backward, like some proud,\nuntamable animal, rearing; then she rushed quickly through the\ndarkness toward the house. He heard the patter of her little boots on\nthe stones of the yard, deadened afterward by the sand of the walk.\nHe, on his side, already grieved and uneasy, called her back in urgent\ntones. But she ran on without answering, without hearing. Alarmed, and\nwith a heavy heart, he hurried after her, and rounded the clump of\nplane trees just in time to see her rush into the house like a\nwhirlwind. He darted in after her, ran up the stairs, and struck\nagainst the door of her room, which she violently bolted. And here he\nstopped and grew calm, by a strong effort resisting the desire to cry\nout, to call her again, to break in the door so as to see her once\nmore, to convince her, to have her all to himself. For a moment he\nremained motionless, chilled by the deathlike silence of the room,\nfrom which not the faintest sound issued. Doubtless she had thrown\nherself on the bed, and was stifling her cries and her sobs in the\npillow. He determined at last to go downstairs again and close the\nhall door, and then he returned softly and listened, waiting for some\nsound of moaning. And day was breaking when he went disconsolately to\nbed, choking back his tears.",
        "Thenceforward it was war without mercy. Pascal felt himself spied\nupon, trapped, menaced. He was no longer master of his house; he had\nno longer any home. The enemy was always there, forcing him to be\nconstantly on his guard, to lock up everything. One after the other,\ntwo vials of nerve-substance which he had compounded were found in\nfragments, and he was obliged to barricade himself in his room, where\nhe could be heard pounding for days together, without showing himself\neven at mealtime. He no longer took Clotilde with him on his visiting\ndays, because she discouraged his patients by her attitude of\naggressive incredulity. But from the moment he left the house, the\ndoctor had only one desire–to return to it quickly, for he trembled\nlest he should find his locks forced, and his drawers rifled on his\nreturn. He no longer employed the young girl to classify and copy his\nnotes, for several of them had disappeared, as if they had been\ncarried away by the wind. He did not even venture to employ her to\ncorrect his proofs, having ascertained that she had cut out of an\narticle an entire passage, the sentiment of which offended her\nCatholic belief. And thus she remained idle, prowling about the rooms,\nand having an abundance of time to watch for an occasion which would\nput in her possession the key of the large press. This was her dream,\nthe plan which she revolved in her mind during her long silence, while\nher eyes shone and her hands burned with fever–to have the key, to\nopen the press, to take and burn everything in an auto da fe which\nwould be pleasing to God. A few pages of manuscript, forgotten by him\non a corner of the table, while he went to wash his hands and put on\nhis coat, had disappeared, leaving behind only a little heap of ashes\nin the fireplace. He could no longer leave a scrap of paper about. He\ncarried away everything; he hid everything. One evening, when he had\nremained late with a patient, as he was returning home in the dusk a\nwild terror seized him at the faubourg, at sight of a thick black\nsmoke rising up in clouds that darkened the heavens. Was it not La\nSouleiade that was burning down, set on fire by the bonfire made with\nhis papers? He ran toward the house, and was reassured only on seeing\nin a neighboring field a fire of roots burning slowly.",
        "But how terrible are the tortures of the scientist who feels himself\nmenaced in this way in the labors of his intellect! The discoveries\nwhich he has made, the writings which he has counted upon leaving\nbehind him, these are his pride, they are creatures of his blood–his\nchildren–and whoever destroys, whoever burns them, burns a part of\nhimself. Especially, in this perpetual lying in wait for the creatures\nof his brain, was Pascal tortured by the thought that the enemy was in\nhis house, installed in his very heart, and that he loved her in spite\nof everything, this creature whom he had made what she was. He was\nleft disarmed, without possible defense; not wishing to act, and\nhaving no other resources than to watch with vigilance. On all sides\nthe investment was closing around him. He fancied he felt the little\npilfering hands stealing into his pockets. He had no longer any\ntranquillity, even with the doors closed, for he feared that he was\nbeing robbed through the crevices.",
        "“But, unhappy child,” he cried one day, “I love but you in the world,\nand you are killing me! And yet you love me, too; you act in this way\nbecause you love me, and it is abominable. It would be better to have\ndone with it all at once, and throw ourselves into the river with a\nstone tied around our necks.”",
        "She did not answer, but her dauntless eyes said ardently that she\nwould willingly die on the instant, if it were with him.",
        "“And if I should suddenly die to-night, what would happen to-morrow?\nYou would empty the press, you would empty the drawers, you would make\na great heap of all my works and burn them! You would, would you not?\nDo you know that that would be a real murder, as much as if you\nassassinated some one? And what abominable cowardice, to kill the\nthoughts!”",
        "“No,” she said at last, in a low voice; “to kill evil, to prevent it\nfrom spreading and springing up again!”",
        "All their explanations only served to kindle anew their anger. And\nthey had terrible ones. And one evening, when old Mme. Rougon had\nchanced in on one of these quarrels, she remained alone with Pascal,\nafter Clotilde had fled to hide herself in her room. There was silence\nfor a moment. In spite of the heartbroken air which she had assumed, a\nwicked joy shone in the depths of her sparkling eyes.",
        "“But your unhappy house is a hell!” she cried at last.",
        "The doctor avoided an answer by a gesture. He had always felt that his\nmother backed the young girl, inflaming her religious faith, utilizing\nthis ferment of revolt to bring trouble into his house. He was not\ndeceived. He knew perfectly well that the two women had seen each\nother during the day, and that he owed to this meeting, to a skilful\nembittering of Clotilde’s mind, the frightful scene at which he still\ntrembled. Doubtless his mother had come to learn what mischief had\nbeen wrought, and to see if the denouement was not at last at hand.",
        "“Things cannot go on in this way,” she resumed. “Why do you not\nseparate since you can no longer agree. You ought to send her to her\nbrother Maxime. He wrote to me not long since asking her again.”",
        "He straightened himself, pale and determined.",
        "“To part angry with each other? Ah, no, no! that would be an eternal\nremorse, an incurable wound. If she must one day go away, I wish that\nwe may be able to love each other at a distance. But why go away?\nNeither of us complains of the other.”",
        "Felicite felt that she had been too hasty. Therefore she assumed her\nhypocritical, conciliating air.",
        "“Of course, if it pleases you both to quarrel, no one has anything to\nsay in the matter. Only, my poor friend, permit me, in that case, to\nsay that I think Clotilde is not altogether in the wrong. You force me\nto confess that I saw her a little while ago; yes, it is better that\nyou should know, notwithstanding my promise to be silent. Well, she is\nnot happy; she makes a great many complaints, and you may imagine that\nI scolded her and preached complete submission to her. But that does\nnot prevent me from being unable to understand you myself, and from\nthinking that you do everything you can to make yourself unhappy.”",
        "She sat down in a corner of the room, and obliged him to sit down with\nher, seeming delighted to have him here alone, at her mercy. She had\nalready, more than once before, tried to force him to an explanation\nin this way, but he had always avoided it. Although she had tortured\nhim for years past, and he knew her thoroughly, he yet remained a\ndeferential son, he had sworn never to abandon this stubbornly\nrespectful attitude. Thus, the moment she touched certain subjects, he\ntook refuge in absolute silence.",
        "“Come,” she continued; “I can understand that you should not wish to\nyield to Clotilde; but to me? How if I were to entreat you to make me\nthe sacrifice of all those abominable papers which are there in the\npress! Consider for an instant if you should die suddenly, and those\npapers should fall into strange hands. We should all be disgraced. You\nwould not wish that, would you? What is your object, then? Why do you\npersist in so dangerous a game? Promise me that you will burn them.”",
        "He remained silent for a time, but at last he answered:",
        "“Mother, I have already begged of you never to speak on that subject.\nI cannot do what you ask.”",
        "“But at least,” she cried, “give me a reason. Any one would think our\nfamily was as indifferent to you as that drove of oxen passing below\nthere. Yet you belong to it. Oh, I know you do all you can not to\nbelong to it! I myself am sometimes astonished at you. I ask myself\nwhere you can have come from. But for all that, it is very wicked of\nyou to run this risk, without stopping to think of the grief you are\ncausing to me, your mother. It is simply wicked.”",
        "He grew still paler, and yielding for an instant to his desire to\ndefend himself, in spite of his determination to keep silent, he said:",
        "“You are hard; you are wrong. I have always believed in the necessity,\nthe absolute efficacy of truth. It is true that I tell the truth about\nothers and about myself, and it is because I believe firmly that in\ntelling the truth I do the only good possible. In the first place,\nthose papers are not intended for the public; they are only personal\nnotes which it would be painful to me to part with. And then, I know\nwell that you would not burn only them–all my other works would also\nbe thrown into the fire. Would they not? And that is what I do not\nwish; do you understand? Never, while I live, shall a line of my\nwriting be destroyed here.”",
        "But he already regretted having said so much, for he saw that she was\nurging him, leading him on to the cruel explanation she desired.",
        "“Then finish, and tell me what it is that you reproach us with. Yes,\nme, for instance; what do you reproach me with? Not with having\nbrought you up with so much difficulty. Ah, fortune was slow to win!\nIf we enjoy a little happiness now, we have earned it hard. Since you\nhave seen everything, and since you put down everything in your\npapers, you can testify with truth that the family has rendered\ngreater services to others than it has ever received. On two\noccasions, but for us, Plassans would have been in a fine pickle. And\nit is perfectly natural that we should have reaped only ingratitude\nand envy, to the extent that even to-day the whole town would be\nenchanted with a scandal that should bespatter us with mud. You cannot\nwish that, and I am sure that you will do justice to the dignity of my\nattitude since the fall of the Empire, and the misfortunes from which\nFrance will no doubt never recover.”",
        "“Let France rest, mother,” he said, speaking again, for she had\ntouched the spot where she knew he was most sensitive. “France is\ntenacious of life, and I think she is going to astonish the world by\nthe rapidity of her convalescence. True, she has many elements of\ncorruption. I have not sought to hide them, I have rather, perhaps,\nexposed them to view. But you greatly misunderstand me if you imagine\nthat I believe in her final dissolution, because I point out her\nwounds and her lesions. I believe in the life which ceaselessly\neliminates hurtful substances, which makes new flesh to fill the holes\neaten away by gangrene, which infallibly advances toward health,\ntoward constant renovation, amid impurities and death.”",
        "He was growing excited, and he was conscious of it, and making an\nangry gesture, he spoke no more. His mother had recourse to tears, a\nfew little tears which came with difficulty, and which were quickly\ndried. And the fears which saddened her old age returned to her, and\nshe entreated him to make his peace with God, if only out of regard\nfor the family. Had she not given an example of courage ever since the\ndownfall of the Empire? Did not all Plassans, the quarter of St. Marc,\nthe old quarter and the new town, render homage to the noble attitude\nshe maintained in her fall? All she asked was to be helped; she\ndemanded from all her children an effort like her own. Thus she cited\nthe example of Eugene, the great man who had fallen from so lofty a\nheight, and who resigned himself to being a simple deputy, defending\nuntil his latest breath the fallen government from which he had\nderived his glory. She was also full of eulogies of Aristide, who had\nnever lost hope, who had reconquered, under the new government, an\nexalted position, in spite of the terrible and unjust catastrophe\nwhich had for a moment buried him under the ruins of the Union\nUniverselle. And would he, Pascal, hold himself aloof, would he do\nnothing that she might die in peace, in the joy of the final triumph\nof the Rougons, he who was so intelligent, so affectionate, so good?\nHe would go to mass, would he not, next Sunday? and he would burn all\nthose vile papers, only to think of which made her ill. She entreated,\ncommanded, threatened. But he no longer answered her, calm and\ninvincible in his attitude of perfect deference. He wished to have no\ndiscussion. He knew her too well either to hope to convince her or to\nventure to discuss the past with her.",
        "“Why!” she cried, when she saw that he was not to be moved, “you do\nnot belong to us. I have always said so. You are a disgrace to us.”",
        "He bent his head and said:",
        "“Mother, when you reflect you will forgive me.”",
        "On this day Felicite was beside herself with rage when she went away;\nand when she met Martine at the door of the house, in front of the\nplane trees, she unburdened her mind to her, without knowing that\nPascal, who had just gone into his room, heard all. She gave vent to\nher resentment, vowing, in spite of everything, that she would in the\nend succeed in obtaining possession of the papers and destroying them,\nsince he did not wish to make the sacrifice. But what turned the\ndoctor cold was the manner in which Martine, in a subdued voice,\nsoothed her. She was evidently her accomplice. She repeated that it\nwas necessary to wait; not to do anything hastily; that mademoiselle\nand she had taken a vow to get the better of monsieur, by not leaving\nhim an hour’s peace. They had sworn it. They would reconcile him with\nthe good God, because it was not possible that an upright man like\nmonsieur should remain without religion. And the voices of the two\nwomen became lower and lower, until they finally sank to a whisper, an\nindistinct murmur of gossiping and plotting, of which he caught only a\nword here and there; orders given, measures to be taken, an invasion\nof his personal liberty. When his mother at last departed, with her\nlight step and slender, youthful figure, he saw that she went away\nvery well satisfied.",
        "Then came a moment of weakness, of utter despair. Pascal dropped into\na chair, and asked himself what was the use of struggling, since the\nonly beings he loved allied themselves against him. Martine, who would\nhave thrown herself into the fire at a word from him, betraying him in\nthis way for his good! And Clotilde leagued with this servant,\nplotting with her against him in holes and corners, seeking her aid to\nset traps for him! Now he was indeed alone; he had around him only\ntraitresses, who poisoned the very air he breathed. But these two\nstill loved him. He might perhaps have succeeded in softening them,\nbut when he knew that his mother urged them on, he understood their\nfierce persistence, and he gave up the hope of winning them back. With\nthe timidity of a man who had spent his life in study, aloof from\nwomen, notwithstanding his secret passion, the thought that they were\nthere to oppose him, to attempt to bend him to their will, overwhelmed\nhim. He felt that some one of them was always behind him. Even when he\nshut himself up in his room, he fancied that they were on the other\nside of the wall; and he was constantly haunted by the idea that they\nwould rob him of his thought, if they could perceive it in his brain,\nbefore he should have formulated it.",
        "This was assuredly the period in his life in which Dr. Pascal was most\nunhappy. To live constantly on the defensive, as he was obliged to do,\ncrushed him, and it seemed to him as if the ground on which his house\nstood was no longer his, as if it was receding from beneath his feet.\nHe now regretted keenly that he had not married, and that he had no\nchildren. Had not he himself been afraid of life? And had he not been\nwell punished for his selfishness? This regret for not having children\nnow never left him. His eyes now filled with tears whenever he met on\nthe road bright-eyed little girls who smiled at him. True, Clotilde\nwas there, but his affection for her was of a different kind–crossed\nat present by storms–not a calm, infinitely sweet affection, like\nthat for a child with which he might have soothed his lacerated heart.\nAnd then, no doubt what he desired in his isolation, feeling that his\ndays were drawing to an end, was above all, continuance; in a child he\nwould survive, he would live forever. The more he suffered, the\ngreater the consolation he would have found in bequeathing this\nsuffering, in the faith which he still had in life. He considered\nhimself indemnified for the physiological defects of his family. But\neven the thought that heredity sometimes passes over a generation, and\nthat the disorders of his ancestors might reappear in a child of his\ndid not deter him; and this unknown child, in spite of the old corrupt\nstock, in spite of the long succession of execrable relations, he\ndesired ardently at certain times: as one desires unexpected gain,\nrare happiness, the stroke of fortune which is to console and enrich\nforever. In the shock which his other affections had received, his\nheart bled because it was too late.",
        "One sultry night toward the end of September, Pascal found himself\nunable to sleep. He opened one of the windows of his room; the sky was\ndark, some storm must be passing in the distance, for there was a\ncontinuous rumbling of thunder. He could distinguish vaguely the dark\nmass of the plane trees, which occasional flashes of lightning\ndetached, in a dull green, from the darkness. His soul was full of\nanguish; he lived over again the last unhappy days, days of fresh\nquarrels, of torture caused by acts of treachery, by suspicions, which\ngrew stronger every day, when a sudden recollection made him start. In\nhis fear of being robbed, he had finally adopted the plan of carrying\nthe key of the large press in his pocket. But this afternoon,\noppressed by the heat, he had taken off his jacket, and he remembered\nhaving seen Clotilde hang it up on a nail in the study. A sudden pang\nof terror shot through him, sharp and cold as a steel point; if she\nhad felt the key in the pocket she had stolen it. He hastened to\nsearch the jacket which he had a little before thrown upon a chair;\nthe key was not here. At this very moment he was being robbed; he had\nthe clear conviction of it. Two o’clock struck. He did not again dress\nhimself, but, remaining in his trousers only, with his bare feet\nthrust into slippers, his chest bare under his unfastened nightshirt,\nhe hastily pushed open the door, and rushed into the workroom, his\ncandle in his hand.",
        "“Ah! I knew it,” he cried. “Thief! Assassin!”",
        "It was true; Clotilde was there, undressed like himself, her bare feet\ncovered by canvas slippers, her legs bare, her arms bare, her\nshoulders bare, clad only in her chemise and a short skirt. Through\ncaution, she had not brought a candle. She had contented herself with\nopening one of the window shutters, and the continual lightning\nflashes of the storm which was passing southward in the dark sky,\nsufficed her, bathing everything in a livid phosphorescence. The old\npress, with its broad sides, was wide open. Already she had emptied\nthe top shelf, taking down the papers in armfuls, and throwing them on\nthe long table in the middle of the room, where they lay in a confused\nheap. And with feverish haste, fearing lest she should not have the\ntime to burn them, she was making them up into bundles, intending to\nhide them, and send them afterward to her grandmother, when the sudden\nflare of the candle, lighting up the room, caused her to stop short in\nan attitude of surprise and resistance.",
        "“You rob me; you assassinate me!” repeated Pascal furiously.",
        "She still held one of the bundles in her bare arms. He wished to take\nit away from her, but she pressed it to her with all her strength,\nobstinately resolved upon her work of destruction, without showing\nconfusion or repentance, like a combatant who has right upon his side.\nThen, madly, blindly, he threw himself upon her, and they struggled\ntogether. He clutched her bare flesh so that he hurt her.",
        "“Kill me!” she gasped. “Kill me, or I shall destroy everything!”",
        "He held her close to him, with so rough a grasp that she could\nscarcely breathe, crying:",
        "“When a child steals, it is punished!”",
        "A few drops of blood appeared and trickled down her rounded shoulder,\nwhere an abrasion had cut the delicate satin skin. And, on the\ninstant, seeing her so breathless, so divine, in her virginal slender\nheight, with her tapering limbs, her supple arms, her slim body with\nits slender, firm throat, he released her. By a last effort he tore\nthe package from her.",
        "“And you shall help me to put them all up there again, by Heaven! Come\nhere: begin by arranging them on the table. Obey me, do you hear?”",
        "“Yes, master!”",
        "She approached, and helped him to arrange the papers, subjugated,\ncrushed by this masculine grasp, which had entered into her flesh, as\nit were. The candle which flared up in the heavy night air, lighted\nthem; and the distant rolling of the thunder still continued, the\nwindow facing the storm seeming on fire.",
        "For an instant Pascal looked at the papers, the heap of which seemed\nenormous, lying thus in disorder on the long table that stood in the\nmiddle of the room. In the confusion several of the blue paper\nenvelopes had burst open, and their contents had fallen out–letters,\nnewspaper clippings, documents on stamped paper, and manuscript notes.",
        "He was already mechanically beginning to seek out the names written on\nthe envelopes in large characters, to classify the packages again,\nwhen, with an abrupt gesture, he emerged from the somber meditation\ninto which he had fallen. And turning to Clotilde who stood waiting,\npale, silent, and erect, he said:",
        "“Listen to me; I have always forbidden you to read these papers, and I\nknow that you have obeyed me. Yes, I had scruples of delicacy. It is\nnot that you are an ignorant girl, like so many others, for I have\nallowed you to learn everything concerning man and woman, which is\nassuredly bad only for bad natures. But to what end disclose to you\ntoo early these terrible truths of human life? I have therefore spared\nyou the history of our family, which is the history of every family,\nof all humanity; a great deal of evil and a great deal of good.”",
        "He paused as if to confirm himself in his resolution and then resumed\nquite calmly and with supreme energy:",
        "“You are twenty-five years old; you ought to know. And then the life\nwe are leading is no longer possible. You live and you make me live in\na constant nightmare, with your ecstatic dreams. I prefer to show you\nthe reality, however execrable it may be. Perhaps the blow which it\nwill inflict upon you will make of you the woman you ought to be. We\nwill classify these papers again together, and read them, and learn\nfrom them a terrible lesson of life!”",
        "Then, as she still continued motionless, he resumed:",
        "“Come, we must be able to see well. Light those other two candles\nthere.”",
        "He was seized by a desire for light, a flood of light; he would have\ndesired the blinding light of the sun; and thinking that the light of\nthe three candles was not sufficient, he went into his room for a pair\nof three-branched candelabra which were there. The nine candles were\nblazing, yet neither of them, in their disorder–he with his chest\nbare, she with her left shoulder stained with blood, her throat and\narms bare–saw the other. It was past two o’clock, but neither of them\nhad any consciousness of the hour; they were going to spend the night\nin this eager desire for knowledge, without feeling the need of sleep,\noutside time and space. The mutterings of the storm, which, through\nthe open window, they could see gathering, grew louder and louder.",
        "Clotilde had never before seen in Pascal’s eyes the feverish light\nwhich burned in them now. He had been overworking himself for some\ntime past, and his mental sufferings made him at times abrupt, in\nspite of his good-natured complacency. But it seemed as if an infinite\ntenderness, trembling with fraternal pity, awoke within him, now that\nhe was about to plunge into the painful truths of existence; and it\nwas something emanating from himself, something very great and very\ngood which was to render innocuous the terrible avalanche of facts\nwhich was impending. He was determined that he would reveal\neverything, since it was necessary that he should do so in order to\nremedy everything. Was not this an unanswerable, a final argument for\nevolution, the story of these beings who were so near to them? Such\nwas life, and it must be lived. Doubtless she would emerge from it\nlike the steel tempered by the fire, full of tolerance and courage.",
        "“They are setting you against me,” he resumed; “they are making you\ncommit abominable acts, and I wish to restore your conscience to you.\nWhen you know, you will judge and you will act. Come here, and read\nwith me.”",
        "She obeyed. But these papers, about which her grandmother had spoken\nso angrily, frightened her a little; while a curiosity that grew with\nevery moment awoke within her. And then, dominated though she was by\nthe virile authority which had just constrained and subjugated her,\nshe did not yet yield. But might she not listen to him, read with him?\nDid she not retain the right to refuse or to give herself afterward?\nHe spoke at last.",
        "“Will you come?”",
        "“Yes, master, I will.”",
        "He showed her first the genealogical tree of the Rougon-Macquarts. He\ndid not usually lock it in the press, but kept it in the desk in his\nroom, from which he had taken it when he went there for the\ncandelabra. For more than twenty years past he had kept it up to date,\ninscribing the births, deaths, marriages, and other important events\nthat had taken place in the family, making brief notes in each case,\nin accordance with his theory of heredity.",
        "It was a large sheet of paper, yellow with age, with folds cut by\nwear, on which was drawn boldly a symbolical tree, whose branches\nspread and subdivided into five rows of broad leaves; and each leaf\nbore a name, and contained, in minute handwriting, a biography, a\nhereditary case.",
        "A scientist’s joy took possession of the doctor at sight of this labor\nof twenty years, in which the laws of heredity established by him were\nso clearly and so completely applied.",
        "“Look, child! You know enough about the matter, you have copied enough\nof my notes to understand. Is it not beautiful? A document so\ncomplete, so conclusive, in which there is not a gap? It is like an\nexperiment made in the laboratory, a problem stated and solved on the\nblackboard. You see below, the trunk, the common stock, Aunt Dide;\nthen the three branches issuing from it, the legitimate branch, Pierre\nRougon, and the two illegitimate branches, Ursule Macquart and Antoine\nMacquart; then, new branches arise, and ramify, on one side, Maxime,\nClotilde, and Victor, the three children of Saccard, and Angelique,\nthe daughter of Sidonie Rougon; on the other, Pauline, the daughter of\nLisa Macquart, and Claude, Jacques, Etienne, and Anna, the four\nchildren of Gervaise, her sister; there, at the extremity, is Jean,\ntheir brother, and here in the middle, you see what I call the knot,\nthe legitimate issue and the illegitimate issue, uniting in Marthe\nRougon and her cousin Francois Mouret, to give rise to three new\nbranches, Octave, Serge, and Desiree Mouret; while there is also the\nissue of Ursule and the hatter Mouret; Silvere, whose tragic death you\nknow; Helene and her daughter Jean; finally, at the top are the latest\noffshoots, our poor Charles, your brother Maxime’s son, and two other\nchildren, who are dead, Jacques Louis, the son of Claude Lantier, and\nLouiset, the son of Anna Coupeau. In all five generations, a human\ntree which, for five springs already, five springtides of humanity,\nhas sent forth shoots, at the impulse of the sap of eternal life.”",
        "He became more and more animated, pointing out each case on the sheet\nof old yellow paper, as if it were an anatomical chart.",
        "“And as I have already said, everything is here. You see in direct\nheredity, the differentiations, that of the mother, Silvere, Lisa,\nDesiree, Jacques, Louiset, yourself; that of the father, Sidonie,\nFrancois, Gervaise, Octave, Jacques, Louis. Then there are the three\ncases of crossing: by conjugation, Ursule, Aristide, Anna, Victor; by\ndissemination, Maxime, Serge, Etienne; by fusion, Antoine, Eugene,\nClaude. I even noted a fourth case, a very remarkable one, an even\ncross, Pierre and Pauline; and varieties are established, the\ndifferentiation of the mother, for example, often accords with the\nphysical resemblance of the father; or, it is the contrary which takes\nplace, so that, in the crossing, the physical and mental predominance\nremains with one parent or the other, according to circumstances. Then\nhere is indirect heredity, that of the collateral branches. I have but\none well established example of this, the striking personal\nresemblance of Octave Mouret to his uncle Eugene Rougon. I have also\nbut one example of transmission by influence, Anna, the daughter of\nGervaise and Coupeau, who bore a striking resemblance, especially in\nher childhood, to Lantier, her mother’s first lover. But what I am\nvery rich in is in examples of reversion to the original stock–the\nthree finest cases, Marthe, Jeanne, and Charles, resembling Aunt Dide;\nthe resemblance thus passing over one, two, and three generations.\nThis is certainly exceptional, for I scarcely believe in atavism; it\nseems to me that the new elements brought by the partners, accidents,\nand the infinite variety of crossings must rapidly efface particular\ncharacteristics, so as to bring back the individual to the general\ntype. And there remains variation–Helene, Jean, Angelique. This is\nthe combination, the chemical mixture in which the physical and mental\ncharacteristics of the parents are blended, without any of their\ntraits seeming to reappear in the new being.”",
        "There was silence for a moment. Clotilde had listened to him with\nprofound attention, wishing to understand. And he remained absorbed in\nthought, his eyes still fixed on the tree, in the desire to judge his\nwork impartially. He then continued in a low tone, as if speaking to\nhimself:",
        "“Yes, that is as scientific as possible. I have placed there only the\nmembers of the family, and I had to give an equal part to the\npartners, to the fathers and mothers come from outside, whose blood\nhas mingled with ours, and therefore modified it. I had indeed made a\nmathematically exact tree, the father and the mother bequeathing\nthemselves, by halves, to the child, from generation to generation, so\nthat in Charles, for example, Aunt Dide’s part would have been only a\ntwelfth–which would be absurd, since the physical resemblance is\nthere complete. I have therefore thought it sufficient to indicate the\nelements come from elsewhere, taking into account marriages and the\nnew factor which each introduced. Ah! these sciences that are yet in\ntheir infancy, in which hypothesis speaks stammeringly, and\nimagination rules, these are the domain of the poet as much as of the\nscientist. Poets go as pioneers in the advance guard, and they often\ndiscover new countries, suggesting solutions. There is there a\nborderland which belongs to them, between the conquered, the\ndefinitive truth, and the unknown, whence the truth of to-morrow will\nbe torn. What an immense fresco there is to be painted, what a\nstupendous human tragedy, what a comedy there is to be written with\nheredity, which is the very genesis of families, of societies, and of\nthe world!”",
        "His eyes fixed on vacancy, he remained for a time lost in thought.\nThen, with an abrupt movement, he came back to the envelopes and,\npushing the tree aside, said:",
        "“We will take it up again presently; for, in order that you may\nunderstand now, it is necessary that events should pass in review\nbefore you, and that you should see in action all these actors\nticketed here, each one summed up in a brief note. I will call for the\nenvelopes, you will hand them to me one by one, and I will show you\nthe papers in each, and tell you their contents, before putting it\naway again up there on the shelf. I will not follow the alphabetical\norder, but the order of events themselves. I have long wished to make\nthis classification. Come, look for the names on the envelopes; Aunt\nDide first.”",
        "At this moment the edge of the storm which lighted up the sky caught\nLa Souleiade slantingly, and burst over the house in a deluge of rain.\nBut they did not even close the window. They heard neither the peals\nof thunder nor the ceaseless beating of the rain upon the roof. She\nhanded him the envelope bearing the name of Aunt Dide in large\ncharacters; and he took from it papers of all sorts, notes taken by\nhim long ago, which he proceeded to read.",
        "“Hand me Pierre Rougon. Hand me Ursule Macquart. Hand me Antoine\nMacquart.”",
        "Silently she obeyed him, her heart oppressed by a dreadful anguish at\nall she was hearing. And the envelopes were passed on, displayed their\ncontents, and were piled up again in the press.",
        "First was the foundress of the family, Adelaide Fouque, the tall,\ncrazy girl, the first nervous lesion giving rise to the legitimate\nbranch, Pierre Rougon, and to the two illegitimate branches, Ursule\nand Antoine Macquart, all that bourgeois and sanguinary tragedy,\nwith the coup d’etat of December, 1854, for a background, the\nRougons, Pierre and Felicite, preserving order at Plassans,\nbespattering with the blood of Silvere their rising fortunes, while\nAdelaide, grown old, the miserable Aunt Dide, was shut up in the\nTulettes, like a specter of expiation and of waiting.",
        "Then like a pack of hounds, the appetites were let loose. The supreme\nappetite of power in Eugene Rougon, the great man, the disdainful\ngenius of the family, free from base interests, loving power for its\nown sake, conquering Paris in old boots with the adventurers of the\ncoming Empire, rising from the legislative body to the senate, passing\nfrom the presidency of the council of state to the portfolio of\nminister; made by his party, a hungry crowd of followers, who at the\nsame time supported and devoured him; conquered for an instant by a\nwoman, the beautiful Clorinde, with whom he had been imbecile enough\nto fall in love, but having so strong a will, and burning with so\nvehement a desire to rule, that he won back power by giving the lie to\nhis whole life, marching to his triumphal sovereignty of vice emperor.",
        "With Aristide Saccard, appetite ran to low pleasures, the whole hot\nquarry of money, luxury, women–a devouring hunger which left him\nhomeless, at the time when millions were changing hands, when the\nwhirlwind of wild speculation was blowing through the city, tearing\ndown everywhere to construct anew, when princely fortunes were made,\nsquandered, and remade in six months; a greed of gold whose ever\nincreasing fury carried him away, causing him, almost before the body\nof his wife Angele was cold in death, to sell his name, in order to\nhave the first indispensable thousand francs, by marrying Renee. And\nit was Saccard, too, who, a few years later, put in motion the immense\nmoney-press of the Banque Universelle. Saccard, the never vanquished;\nSaccard, grown more powerful, risen to be the clever and daring grand\nfinancier, comprehending the fierce and civilizing role that money\nplays, fighting, winning, and losing battles on the Bourse, like\nNapoleon at Austerlitz and Waterloo; engulfing in disaster a world of\nmiserable people; sending forth into the unknown realms of crime his\nnatural son Victor, who disappeared, fleeing through the dark night,\nwhile he himself, under the impassable protection of unjust nature,\nwas loved by the adorable Mme. Caroline, no doubt in recompense of all\nthe evil he had done.",
        "Here a tall, spotless lily had bloomed in this compost, Sidonie\nRougon, the sycophant of her brother, the go-between in a hundred\nsuspicious affairs, giving birth to the pure and divine Angelique, the\nlittle embroiderer with fairylike fingers who worked into the gold of\nthe chasubles the dream of her Prince Charming, so happy among her\ncompanions the saints, so little made for the hard realities of life,\nthat she obtained the grace of dying of love, on the day of her\nmarriage, at the first kiss of Felicien de Hautecoeur, in the\ntriumphant peal of bells ringing for her splendid nuptials.",
        "The union of the two branches, the legitimate and the illegitimate,\ntook place then, Marthe Rougon espousing her cousin Francois Mouret, a\npeaceful household slowly disunited, ending in the direst catastrophes\n–a sad and gentle woman taken, made use of, and crushed in the vast\nmachine of war erected for the conquest of a city; her three children\ntorn from her, she herself leaving her heart in the rude grasp of the\nAbbe Faujas. And the Rougons saved Plassans a second time, while she\nwas dying in the glare of the conflagration in which her husband was\nbeing consumed, mad with long pent-up rage and the desire for revenge.",
        "Of the three children, Octave Mouret was the audacious conqueror, the\nclear intellect, resolved to demand from the women the sovereignty of\nParis, fallen at his debut into the midst of a corrupt bourgeoissociety, acquiring there a terrible sentimental education, passing\nfrom the capricious refusal of one woman to the unresisting\nabandonment of another, remaining, fortunately, active, laborious, and\ncombative, gradually emerging, and improved even, from the low\nplotting, the ceaseless ferment of a rotten society that could be\nheard already cracking to its foundations. And Octave Mouret,\nvictorious, revolutionized commerce; swallowed up the cautious little\nshops that carried on business in the old-fashioned way; established\nin the midst of feverish Paris the colossal palace of temptation,\nblazing with lights, overflowing with velvets, silks, and laces; won\nfortunes exploiting woman; lived in smiling scorn of woman until the\nday when a little girl, the avenger of her sex, the innocent and wise\nDenise, vanquished him and held him captive at her feet, groaning with\nanguish, until she did him the favor, she who was so poor, to marry\nhim in the midst of the apotheosis of his Louvre, under the golden\nshower of his receipts.",
        "There remained the two other children, Serge Mouret and Desiree\nMouret, the latter innocent and healthy, like some happy young animal;\nthe former refined and mystical, who was thrown into the priesthood by\na nervous malady hereditary in his family, and who lived again the\nstory of Adam, in the Eden of Le Paradou. He was born again to love\nAlbine, and to lose her, in the bosom of sublime nature, their\naccomplice; to be recovered, afterward by the Church, to war eternally\nwith life, striving to kill his manhood, throwing on the body of the\ndead Albine the handful of earth, as officiating priest, at the very\ntime when Desiree, the sister and friend of animals, was rejoicing in\nthe midst of the swarming life of her poultry yard.",
        "Further on there opened a calm glimpse of gentle and tragic life,\nHelene Mouret living peacefully with her little girl, Jeanne, on the\nheights of Passy, overlooking Paris, the bottomless, boundless human\nsea, in face of which was unrolled this page of love: the sudden\npassion of Helene for a stranger, a physician, brought one night by\nchance to the bedside of her daughter; the morbid jealousy of Jeanne–\nthe instinctive jealousy of a loving girl–disputing her mother with\nlove, her mother already so wasted by her unhappy passion that the\ndaughter died because of her fault; terrible price of one hour of\ndesire in the entire cold and discreet life of a woman, poor dead\nchild, lying alone in the silent cemetery, in face of eternal Paris.",
        "With Lisa Macquart began the illegitimate branch; appearing fresh and\nstrong in her, as she displayed her portly, prosperous figure, sitting\nat the door of her pork shop in a light colored apron, watching the\ncentral market, where the hunger of a people muttered, the age-long\nbattle of the Fat and the Lean, the lean Florent, her brother-in-law,\nexecrated, and set upon by the fat fishwomen and the fat shopwomen,\nand whom even the fat pork-seller herself, honest, but unforgiving,\ncaused to be arrested as a republican who had broken his ban,\nconvinced that she was laboring for the good digestion of all honest\npeople.",
        "From this mother sprang the sanest, the most human of girls, Pauline\nQuenu, the well-balanced, the reasonable, the virgin; who, knowing\neverything, accepted the joy of living in so ardent a love for others\nthat, in spite of the revolt of her youthful heart, she resigned to\nher friend her cousin and betrothed, Lazare, and afterward saved the\nchild of the disunited household, becoming its true mother; always\ntriumphant, always gay, notwithstanding her sacrificed and ruined\nlife, in her monotonous solitude, facing the great sea, in the midst\nof a little world of sufferers groaning with pain, but who did not\nwish to die.",
        "Then came Gervaise Macquart with her four children: bandy-legged,\npretty, and industrious Gervaise, whom her lover Lantier turned into\nthe street in the faubourg, where she met the zinc worker Coupeau, the\nskilful, steady workman whom she married, and with whom she lived so\nhappily at first, having three women working in her laundry, but\nafterward sinking with her husband, as was inevitable, to the\ndegradation of her surroundings. He, gradually conquered by alcohol,\nbrought by it to madness and death; she herself perverted, become a\nslattern, her moral ruin completed by the return of Lantier, living in\nthe tranquil ignominy of a household of three, thenceforward the\nwretched victim of want, her accomplice, to which she at last\nsuccumbed, dying one night of starvation.",
        "Her eldest son, Claude, had the unhappy genius of a great painter\nstruck with madness, the impotent madness of feeling within him the\nmasterpiece to which his fingers refused to give shape; a giant\nwrestler always defeated, a crucified martyr to his work, adoring\nwoman, sacrificing his wife Christine, so loving and for a time so\nbeloved, to the increate, divine woman of his visions, but whom his\npencil was unable to delineate in her nude perfection, possessed by a\ndevouring passion for producing, an insatiable longing to create, a\nlonging so torturing when it could not be satisfied, that he ended it\nby hanging himself.",
        "Jacques brought crime, the hereditary taint being transmuted in him\ninto an instinctive appetite for blood, the young and fresh blood from\nthe gashed throat of a woman, the first comer, the passer-by in the\nstreet: a horrible malady against which he struggled, but which took\npossession of him again in the course of his amour with the\nsubmissive and sensual Severine, whom a tragic story of assassination\ncaused to live in constant terror, and whom he stabbed one evening in\nan excess of frenzy, maddened by the sight of her white throat. Then\nthis savage human beast rushed among the trains filing past swiftly,\nand mounted the snorting engine of which he was the engineer, the\nbeloved engine which was one day to crush him to atoms, and then, left\nwithout a guide, to rush furiously off into space braving unknown\ndisasters.",
        "Etienne, in his turn driven out, arrived in the black country on a\nfreezing night in March, descended into the voracious pit, fell in\nlove with the melancholy Catherine, of whom a ruffian robbed him;\nlived with the miners their gloomy life of misery and base\npromiscuousness, until one day when hunger, prompting rebellion, sent\nacross the barren plain a howling mob of wretches who demanded bread,\ntearing down and burning as they went, under the menace of the guns of\nthe band that went off of themselves, a terrible convulsion announcing\nthe end of the world. The avenging blood of the Maheus was to rise up\nlater; of Alzire dead of starvation, Maheu killed by a bullet,\nZacharie killed by an explosion of fire-damp, Catherine under the\nground. La Maheude alone survived to weep her dead, descending again\ninto the mine to earn her thirty sons, while Etienne, the beaten chief\nof the band, haunted by the dread of future demands, went away on a\nwarm April morning, listening to the secret growth of the new world\nwhose germination was soon to dazzle the earth.",
        "Nana then became the avenger; the girl born among the social filth of\nthe faubourgs; the golden fly sprung from the rottenness below, that\nwas tolerated and concealed, carrying in the fluttering of its wings\nthe ferment of destruction, rising and contaminating the aristocracy,\npoisoning men only by alighting upon them, in the palaces through\nwhose windows it entered; the unconscious instrument of ruin and\ndeath–fierce flame of Vandeuvres, the melancholy fate of Foucarmont,\nlost in the Chinese waters, the disaster of Steiner, reduced to live\nas an honest man, the imbecility of La Faloise and the tragic ruin of\nthe Muffats, and the white corpse of Georges, watched by Philippe,\ncome out of prison the day before, when the air of the epoch was so\ncontaminated that she herself was infected, and died of malignant\nsmallpox, caught at the death-bed of her son Louiset, while Paris\npassed beneath her windows, intoxicated, possessed by the frenzy of\nwar, rushing to general ruin.",
        "Lastly comes Jean Macquart, the workman and soldier become again a\npeasant, fighting with the hard earth, which exacts that every grain\nof corn shall be purchased with a drop of sweat, fighting, above all,\nwith the country people, whom covetousness and the long and difficult\nbattle with the soil cause to burn with the desire, incessantly\nstimulated, of possession. Witness the Fouans, grown old, parting with\ntheir fields as if they were parting with their flesh; the Buteaus in\ntheir eager greed committing parricide, to hasten the inheritance of a\nfield of lucern; the stubborn Francoise dying from the stroke of a\nscythe, without speaking, rather than that a sod should go out of the\nfamily–all this drama of simple natures governed by instinct,\nscarcely emerged from primitive barbarism–all this human filth on the\ngreat earth, which alone remains immortal, the mother from whom they\nissue and to whom they return again, she whom they love even to crime,\nwho continually remakes life, for its unknown end, even with the\nmisery and the abomination of the beings she nourishes. And it was\nJean, too, who, become a widower and having enlisted again at the\nfirst rumor of war, brought the inexhaustible reserve, the stock of\neternal rejuvenation which the earth keeps; Jean, the humblest, the\nstaunchest soldier at the final downfall, swept along in the terrible\nand fatal storm which, from the frontier to Sedan, in sweeping away\nthe Empire, threatened to sweep away the country; always wise,\ncircumspect, firm in his hope, loving with fraternal affection his\ncomrade Maurice, the demented child of the people, the holocaust\ndoomed to expiation, weeping tears of blood when inexorable destiny\nchose himself to hew off this rotten limb, and after all had ended–\nthe continual defeats, the frightful civil war, the lost provinces,\nthe thousands of millions of francs to pay–taking up the march again,\nnotwithstanding, returning to the land which awaited him, to the great\nand difficult task of making a new France.",
        "Pascal paused; Clotilde had handed him all the packages, one by one,\nand he had gone over them all, laid bare the contents of all,\nclassified them anew, and placed them again on the top shelf of the\npress. He was out of breath, exhausted by his swift course through all\nthis humanity, while, without voice, without movement, the young girl,\nstunned by this overflowing torrent of life, waited still, incapable\nof thought or judgment. The rain still beat furiously upon the dark\nfields. The lightning had just struck a tree in the neighborhood, that\nhad split with a terrible crash. The candles flared up in the wind\nthat came in from the open window.",
        "“Ah!” he resumed, pointing to the papers again, “there is a world in\nitself, a society, a civilization, the whole of life is there, with\nits manifestations, good and bad, in the heat and labor of the forge\nwhich shapes everything. Yes, our family of itself would suffice as an\nexample to science, which will perhaps one day establish with\nmathematical exactness the laws governing the diseases of the blood\nand nerves that show themselves in a race, after a first organic\nlesion, and that determine, according to environment, the sentiments,\ndesires, and passions of each individual of that race, all the human,\nnatural and instinctive manifestations which take the names of virtues\nand vices. And it is also a historical document, it relates the story\nof the Second Empire, from the coup d’etat to Sedan; for our family\nspring from the people, they spread themselves through the whole of\ncontemporary society, invaded every place, impelled by their unbridled\nappetites, by that impulse, essentially modern, that eager desire that\nurges the lower classes to enjoyment, in their ascent through the\nsocial strata. We started, as I have said, from Plassans, and here we\nare now arrived once more at Plassans.”",
        "He paused again, and then resumed in a low, dreamy voice:",
        "“What an appalling mass stirred up! how many passions, how many joys,\nhow many sufferings crammed into this colossal heap of facts! There is\npure history: the Empire founded in blood, at first pleasure-loving\nand despotic, conquering rebellious cities, then gliding to a slow\ndisintegration, dissolving in blood–in such a sea of blood that the\nentire nation came near being swamped in it. There are social studies:\nwholesale and retail trade, prostitution, crime, land, money, the\nbourgeoisie, the people–that people who rot in the sewer of the\nfaubourgs, who rebel in the great industrial centers, all that\never-increasing growth of mighty socialism, big with the new century.\nThere are simple human studies: domestic pages, love stories, the\nstruggle of minds and hearts against unjust nature, the destruction of\nthose who cry out under their too difficult task, the cry of virtue\nimmolating itself, victorious over pain, There are fancies, flights of\nthe imagination beyond the real: vast gardens always in bloom,\ncathedrals with slender, exquisitely wrought spires, marvelous tales\ncome down from paradise, ideal affections remounting to heaven in a\nkiss. There is everything: the good and the bad, the vulgar and the\nsublime, flowers, mud, blood, laughter, the torrent of life itself,\nbearing humanity endlessly on!”",
        "He took up again the genealogical tree which had remained neglected on\nthe table, spread it out and began to go over it once more with his\nfinger, enumerating now the members of the family who were still\nliving: Eugene Rougon, a fallen majesty, who remained in the Chamber,\nthe witness, the impassible defender of the old world swept away at\nthe downfall of the Empire. Aristide Saccard, who, after having\nchanged his principles, had fallen upon his feet a republican, the\neditor of a great journal, on the way to make new millions, while his\nnatural son Victor, who had never reappeared, was living still in the\nshade, since he was not in the galleys, cast forth by the world into\nthe future, into the unknown, like a human beast foaming with the\nhereditary virus, who must communicate his malady with every bite he\ngives. Sidonie Rougon, who had for a time disappeared, weary of\ndisreputable affairs, had lately retired to a sort of religious house,\nwhere she was living in monastic austerity, the treasurer of the\nMarriage Fund, for aiding in the marriage of girls who were mothers.\nOctave Mouret, proprietor of the great establishment Au Bonheur des\nDames, whose colossal fortune still continued increasing, had had,\ntoward the end of the winter, a third child by his wife Denise Baudu,\nwhom he adored, although his mind was beginning to be deranged again.\nThe Abbe Mouret, cure at St. Eutrope, in the heart of a marshy gorge,\nlived there in great retirement, and very modestly, with his sister\nDesiree, refusing all advancement from his bishop, and waiting for\ndeath like a holy man, rejecting all medicines, although he was\nalready suffering from consumption in its first stage. Helene Mouret\nwas living very happily in seclusion with her second husband, M.\nRambaud, on the little estate which they owned near Marseilles, on the\nseashore; she had had no child by her second husband. Pauline Quenu\nwas still at Bonneville at the other extremity of France, in face of\nthe vast ocean, alone with little Paul, since the death of Uncle\nChanteau, having resolved never to marry, in order to devote herself\nentirely to the son of her cousin Lazare, who had become a widower and\nhad gone to America to make a fortune. Etienne Lantier, returning to\nParis after the strike at Montsou, had compromised himself later in\nthe insurrection of the Commune, whose principles he had defended with\nardor; he had been condemned to death, but his sentence being commuted\nwas transported and was now at Noumea. It was even said that he had\nmarried immediately on his arrival there, and that he had had a child,\nthe sex of which, however, was not known with certainty. Finally, Jean\nMacquart, who had received his discharge after the Bloody Week, had\nsettled at Valqueyras, near Plassans, where he had had the good\nfortune to marry a healthy girl, Melanie Vial, the daughter of a\nwell-to-do peasant, whose lands he farmed, and his wife had borne him\na son in May.",
        "“Yes, it is true,” he resumed, in a low voice; “races degenerate.\nThere is here a veritable exhaustion, rapid deterioration, as if our\nfamily, in their fury of enjoyment, in the gluttonous satisfaction of\ntheir appetites, had consumed themselves too quickly. Louiset, dead in\ninfancy; Jacques Louis, a half imbecile, carried off by a nervous\ndisease; Victor returned to the savage state, wandering about in who\nknows what dark places; our poor Charles, so beautiful and so frail;\nthese are the latest branches of the tree, the last pale offshoots\ninto which the puissant sap of the larger branches seems to have been\nunable to mount. The worm was in the trunk, it has ascended into the\nfruit, and is devouring it. But one must never despair; families are a\ncontinual growth. They go back beyond the common ancestor, into the\nunfathomable strata of the races that have lived, to the first being;\nand they will put forth new shoots without end, they will spread and\nramify to infinity, through future ages. Look at our tree; it counts\nonly five generations. It has not so much importance as a blade of\ngrass, even, in the human forest, vast and dark, of which the peoples\nare the great secular oaks. Think only of the immense roots which\nspread through the soil; think of the continual putting forth of new\nleaves above, which mingle with other leaves of the ever-rolling sea\nof treetops, at the fructifying, eternal breath of life. Well, hope\nlies there, in the daily reconstruction of the race by the new blood\nwhich comes from without. Each marriage brings other elements, good or\nbad, of which the effect is, however, to prevent certain and\nprogressive regeneration. Breaches are repaired, faults effaced, an\nequilibrium is inevitably re-established at the end of a few\ngenerations, and it is the average man that always results; vague\nhumanity, obstinately pursuing its mysterious labor, marching toward\nits unknown end.”",
        "He paused, and heaved a deep sigh.",
        "“Ah! our family, what is it going to become; in what being will it\nfinally end?”",
        "He continued, not now taking into account the survivors whom he had\njust named; having classified these, he knew what they were capable\nof, but he was full of keen curiosity regarding the children who were\nstill infants. He had written to a confrere in Noumea for precise\ninformation regarding the wife whom Etienne had lately married there,\nand the child which she had had, but he had heard nothing, and he\nfeared greatly that on that side the tree would remain incomplete. He\nwas more fully furnished with documents regarding the two children of\nOctave Mouret, with whom he continued to correspond; the little girl\nwas growing up puny and delicate, while the little boy, who strongly\nresembled his mother, had developed superbly, and was perfectly\nhealthy. His strongest hope, besides these, was in Jean’s children,\nthe eldest of whom was a magnificent boy, full of the youthful vigor\nof the races that go back to the soil to regenerate themselves. Pascal\noccasionally went to Valqueyras, and he returned happy from that\nfertile spot, where the father, quiet and rational, was always at his\nplow, the mother cheerful and simple, with her vigorous frame, capable\nof bearing a world. Who knew what sound branch was to spring from that\nside? Perhaps the wise and puissant of the future were to germinate\nthere. The worst of it, for the beauty of his tree, was that all these\nlittle boys and girls were still so young that he could not classify\nthem. And his voice grew tender as he spoke of this hope of the\nfuture, these fair-haired children, in the unavowed regret for his\ncelibacy.",
        "Still contemplating the tree spread out before him, he cried:",
        "“And yet it is complete, it is decisive. Look! I repeat to you that\nall hereditary cases are to be found there. To establish my theory, I\nhad only to base it on the collection of these facts. And indeed, the\nmarvelous thing is that there you can put your finger on the cause why\ncreatures born of the same stock can appear radically different,\nalthough they are only logical modifications of common ancestors. The\ntrunk explains the branches, and these explain the leaves. In your\nfather Saccard and your Uncle Eugene Rougon, so different in their\ntemperaments and their lives, it is the same impulse which made the\ninordinate appetites of the one and the towering ambition of the\nother. Angelique, that pure lily, is born from the disreputable\nSidonie, in the rapture which makes mystics or lovers, according to\nthe environment. The three children of the Mourets are born of the\nsame breath which makes of the clever Octave the dry goods merchant, a\nmillionaire; of the devout Serge, a poor country priest; of the\nimbecile Desiree, a beautiful and happy girl. But the example is still\nmore striking in the children of Gervaise; the neurosis passes down,\nand Nana sells herself; Etienne is a rebel; Jacques, a murderer;\nClaude, a genius; while Pauline, their cousin german, near by, is\nvictorious virtue–virtue which struggles and immolates itself. It is\nheredity, life itself which makes imbeciles, madmen, criminals and\ngreat men. Cells abort, others take their place, and we have a\nscoundrel or a madman instead of a man of genius, or simply an honest\nman. And humanity rolls on, bearing everything on its tide.”",
        "Then in a new shifting of his thought, growing still more animated, he\ncontinued:",
        "“And animals–the beast that suffers and that loves, which is the\nrough sketch, as it were, of man–all the animals our brothers, that\nlive our life, yes, I would have put them in the ark, I would give\nthem a place among our family, show them continually mingling with us,\ncompleting our existence. I have known cats whose presence was the\nmysterious charm of the household; dogs that were adored, whose death\nwas mourned, and left in the heart an inconsolable grief. I have known\ngoats, cows, and asses of very great importance, and whose personality\nplayed such a part that their history ought to be written. And there\nis our Bonhomme, our poor old horse, that has served us for a quarter\nof a century. Do you not think that he has mingled his life with ours,\nand that henceforth he is one of the family? We have modified him, as\nhe has influenced us a little; we shall end by being made in the same\nimage, and this is so true that now, when I see him, half blind, with\nwandering gaze, his legs stiff with rheumatism, I kiss him on both\ncheeks as if he were a poor old relation who had fallen to my charge.\nAh, animals, all creeping and crawling things, all creatures that\nlament, below man, how large a place in our sympathies it would be\nnecessary to give them in a history of life!”",
        "This was a last cry in which Pascal gave utterance to his passionate\ntenderness for all created beings. He had gradually become more and\nmore excited, and had so come to make this confession of his faith in\nthe continuous and victorious work of animated nature. And Clotilde,\nwho thus far had not spoken, pale from the catastrophe in which her\nplans had ended, at last opened her lips to ask:",
        "“Well, master, and what am I here?”",
        "She placed one of her slender fingers on the leaf of the tree on which\nshe saw her name written. He had always passed this leaf by. She\ninsisted.",
        "“Yes, I; what am I? Why have you not read me my envelope?”",
        "For a moment he remained silent, as if surprised at the question.",
        "“Why? For no reason. It is true, I have nothing to conceal from you.\nYou see what is written here? ’Clotilde, born in 1847. Selection of\nthe mother. Reversional heredity, with moral and physical predominance\nof the maternal grandfather.’ Nothing can be clearer. Your mother has\npredominated in you; you have her fine intelligence, and you have also\nsomething of her coquetry, at times of her indolence and of her\nsubmissiveness. Yes, you are very feminine, like her. Without your\nbeing aware of it, I would say that you love to be loved. Besides,\nyour mother was a great novel reader, an imaginative being who loved\nto spend whole days dreaming over a book; she doted on nursery tales,\nhad her fortune told by cards, consulted clairvoyants; and I have\nalways thought that your concern about spiritual matters, your anxiety\nabout the unknown, came from that source. But what completed your\ncharacter by giving you a dual nature, was the influence of your\ngrandfather, Commandant Sicardot. I knew him; he was not a genius, but\nhe had at least a great deal of uprightness and energy. Frankly, if it\nwere not for him, I do not believe that you would be worth much, for\nthe other influences are hardly good. He has given you the best part\nof your nature, combativeness, pride, and frankness.”",
        "She had listened to him with attention. She nodded slightly, to\nsignify that it was indeed so, that she was not offended, although her\nlips trembled visibly at these new details regarding her people and\nher mother.",
        "“Well,” she resumed, “and you, master?”",
        "This time he did not hesitate.",
        "“Oh, I!” he cried, “what is the use of speaking of me? I do not belong\nto the family. You see what is written here. ’Pascal, born in 1813.\nIndividual variation. Combination in which the physical and moral\ncharacters of the parents are blended, without any of their traits\nseeming to appear in the new being.’ My mother has told me often\nenough that I did not belong to it, that in truth she did not know\nwhere I could have come from.”",
        "Those words came from him like a cry of relief, of involuntary joy.",
        "“And the people make no mistake in the matter. Have you ever heard me\ncalled Pascal Rougon in the town? No; people always say simply Dr.\nPascal. It is because I stand apart. And it may not be very\naffectionate to feel so, but I am delighted at it, for there are in\ntruth inheritances too heavy to bear. It is of no use that I love them\nall. My heart beats none the less joyously when I feel myself another\nbeing, different from them, without any community with them. Not to be\nof them, my God! not to be of them! It is a breath of pure air; it is\nwhat gives me the courage to have them all here, to put them, in all\ntheir nakedness, in their envelopes, and still to find the courage to\nlive!”",
        "He stopped, and there was silence for a time. The rain had ceased, the\nstorm was passing away, the thunderclaps sounded more and more\ndistant, while from the refreshed fields, still dark, there came in\nthrough the open window a delicious odor of moist earth. In the calm\nair the candles were burning out with a tall, tranquil flame.",
        "“Ah!” said Clotilde simply, with a gesture of discouragement, “what\nare we to become finally?”",
        "She had declared it to herself one night, in the threshing yard; life\nwas horrible, how could one live peaceful and happy? It was a terrible\nlight that science threw on the world. Analysis searched every wound\nof humanity, in order to expose its horror. And now he had spoken\nstill more bluntly; he had increased the disgust which she had for\npersons and things, pitilessly dissecting her family. The muddy\ntorrent had rolled on before her for nearly three hours, and she had\nheard the most dreadful revelations, the harsh and terrible truth\nabout her people, her people who were so dear to her, whom it was her\nduty to love; her father grown powerful through pecuniary crimes; her\nbrother dissolute; her grandmother unscrupulous, covered with the\nblood of the just; the others almost all tainted, drunkards, ruffians,\nmurderers, the monstrous blossoming of the human tree.",
        "The blow had been so rude that she could not yet recover from it,\nstunned as she was by the revelation of her whole family history, made\nto her in this way at a stroke. And yet the lesson was rendered\ninnocuous, so to say, by something great and good, a breath of\nprofound humanity which had borne her through it. Nothing bad had come\nto her from it. She felt herself beaten by a sharp sea wind, the storm\nwind which strengthens and expands the lungs. He had revealed\neverything, speaking freely even of his mother, without judging her,\ncontinuing to preserve toward her his deferential attitude, as a\nscientist who does not judge events. To tell everything in order to\nknow everything, in order to remedy everything, was not this the cry\nwhich he had uttered on that beautiful summer night?",
        "And by the very excess of what he had just revealed to her, she\nremained shaken, blinded by this too strong light, but understanding\nhim at last, and confessing to herself that he was attempting in this\nan immense work. In spite of everything, it was a cry of health, of\nhope in the future. He spoke as a benefactor who, since heredity made\nthe world, wished to fix its laws, in order to control it, and to make\na new and happy world. Was there then only mud in this overflowing\nstream, whose sluices he had opened? How much gold had passed, mingled\nwith the grass and the flowers on its borders? Hundreds of beings were\nstill flying swiftly before her, and she was haunted by good and\ncharming faces, delicate girlish profiles, by the serene beauty of\nwomen. All passion bled there, hearts swelled with every tender\nrapture. They were numerous, the Jeannes, the Angeliques, the\nPaulines, the Marthes, the Gervaises, the Helenes. They and others,\neven those who were least good, even terrible men, the worst of the\nband, showed a brotherhood with humanity.",
        "And it was precisely this breath which she had felt pass, this broad\ncurrent of sympathy, that he had introduced naturally into his exact\nscientific lesson. He did not seem to be moved; he preserved the\nimpersonal and correct attitude of the demonstrator, but within him\nwhat tender suffering, what a fever of devotion, what a giving up of\nhis whole being to the happiness of others? His entire work,\nconstructed with such mathematical precision, was steeped in this\nfraternal suffering, even in its most cruel ironies. Had he not just\nspoken of the animals, like an elder brother of the wretched living\nbeings that suffer? Suffering exasperated him; his wrath was because\nof his too lofty dream, and he had become harsh only in his hatred of\nthe factitious and the transitory; dreaming of working, not for the\npolite society of a time, but for all humanity in the gravest hours of\nits history. Perhaps, even, it was this revolt against the vulgarity\nof the time which had made him throw himself, in bold defiance, into\ntheories and their application. And the work remained human,\noverflowing as it was with an infinite pity for beings and things.",
        "Besides, was it not life? There is no absolute evil. Most often a\nvirtue presents itself side by side with a defect. No man is bad to\nevery one, each man makes the happiness of some one; so that, when one\ndoes not view things from a single standpoint only, one recognizes in\nthe end the utility of every human being. Those who believe in God\nshould say to themselves that if their God does not strike the wicked\ndead, it is because he sees his work in its totality, and that he\ncannot descend to the individual. Labor ends to begin anew; the\nliving, as a whole, continue, in spite of everything, admirable in\ntheir courage and their industry; and love of life prevails over all.",
        "This giant labor of men, this obstinacy in living, is their excuse, is\nredemption. And then, from a great height the eye saw only this\ncontinual struggle, and a great deal of good, in spite of everything,\neven though there might be a great deal of evil. One shared the\ngeneral indulgence, one pardoned, one had only an infinite pity and an\nardent charity. The haven was surely there, waiting those who have\nlost faith in dogmas, who wish to understand the meaning of their\nlives, in the midst of the apparent iniquity of the world. One must\nlive for the effort of living, for the stone to be carried to the\ndistant and unknown work, and the only possible peace in the world is\nin the joy of making this effort.",
        "Another hour passed; the entire night had flown by in this terrible\nlesson of life, without either Pascal or Clotilde being conscious of\nwhere they were, or of the flight of time. And he, overworked for some\ntime past, and worn out by the life of suspicion and sadness which he\nhad been leading, started nervously, as if he had suddenly awakened.",
        "“Come, you know all; do you feel your heart strong, tempered by the\ntruth, full of pardon and of hope? Are you with me?”",
        "But, still stunned by the frightful moral shock which she had\nreceived, she too, started, bewildered. Her old beliefs had been so\ncompletely overthrown, so many new ideas were awakening within her,\nthat she did not dare to question herself, in order to find an answer.\nShe felt herself seized and carried away by the omnipotence of truth.\nShe endured it without being convinced.",
        "“Master,” she stammered, “master–”",
        "And they remained for a moment face to face, looking at each other.\nDay was breaking, a dawn of exquisite purity, far off in the vast,\nclear sky, washed by the storm. Not a cloud now stained the pale azure\ntinged with rose color. All the cheerful sounds of awakening life in\nthe rain-drenched fields came in through the window, while the\ncandles, burned down to the socket, paled in the growing light.",
        "“Answer; are you with me, altogether with me?”",
        "For a moment he thought she was going to throw herself on his neck and\nburst into tears. A sudden impulse seemed to impel her. But they saw\neach other in their semi-nudity. She, who had not noticed it before,\nwas now conscious that she was only half dressed, that her arms were\nbare, her shoulders bare, covered only by the scattered locks of her\nunbound hair, and on her right shoulder, near the armpit, on lowering\nher eyes, she perceived again the few drops of blood of the bruise\nwhich he had given her, when he had grasped her roughly, in struggling\nto master her. Then an extraordinary confusion took possession of her,\na certainty that she was going to be vanquished, as if by this grasp\nhe had become her master, and forever. This sensation was prolonged;\nshe was seized and drawn on, without the consent of her will, by an\nirresistible impulse to submit.",
        "Abruptly Clotilde straightened herself, struggling with herself,\nwishing to reflect and to recover herself. She pressed her bare arms\nagainst her naked throat. All the blood in her body rushed to her skin\nin a rosy blush of shame. Then, in her divine and slender grace, she\nturned to flee.",
        "“Master, master, let me go–I will see–”",
        "With the swiftness of alarmed maidenhood, she took refuge in her\nchamber, as she had done once before. He heard her lock the door\nhastily, with a double turn of the key. He remained alone, and he\nasked himself suddenly, seized by infinite discouragement and sadness,\nif he had done right in speaking, if the truth would germinate in this\ndear and adored creature, and bear one day a harvest of happiness.",
        "The days wore on. October began with magnificent weather–a sultry\nautumn in which the fervid heat of summer was prolonged, with a\ncloudless sky. Then the weather changed, fierce winds began to blow,\nand a last storm channeled gullies in the hillsides. And to the\nmelancholy household at La Souleiade the approach of winter seemed to\nhave brought an infinite sadness.",
        "It was a new hell. There were no more violent quarrels between Pascal\nand Clotilde. The doors were no longer slammed. Voices raised in\ndispute no longer obliged Martine to go continually upstairs to listen\noutside the door. They scarcely spoke to each other now; and not a\nsingle word had been exchanged between them regarding the midnight\nscene, although weeks had passed since it had taken place. He, through\nan inexplicable scruple, a strange delicacy of which he was not\nhimself conscious, did not wish to renew the conversation, and to\ndemand the answer which he expected–a promise of faith in him and of\nsubmission. She, after the great moral shock which had completely\ntransformed her, still reflected, hesitated, struggled, fighting\nagainst herself, putting off her decision in order not to surrender,\nin her instinctive rebelliousness. And the misunderstanding continued,\nin the midst of the mournful silence of the miserable house, where\nthere was no longer any happiness.",
        "During all this time Pascal suffered terribly, without making any\ncomplaint. He had sunk into a dull distrust, imagining that he was\nstill being watched, and that if they seemed to leave him at peace it\nwas only in order to concoct in secret the darkest plots. His\nuneasiness increased, even, and he expected every day some catastrophe\nto happen–the earth suddenly to open and swallow up his papers, La\nSouleiade itself to be razed to the ground, carried away bodily,\nscattered to the winds.",
        "The persecution against his thought, against his moral and\nintellectual life, in thus hiding itself, and so rendering him\nhelpless to defend himself, became so intolerable to him that he went\nto bed every night in a fever. He would often start and turn round\nsuddenly, thinking he was going to surprise the enemy behind him\nengaged in some piece of treachery, to find nothing there but the\nshadow of his own fears. At other times, seized by some suspicion, he\nwould remain on the watch for hours together, hidden, behind his\nblinds, or lying in wait in a passage; but not a soul stirred, he\nheard nothing but the violent beating of his heart. His fears kept him\nin a state of constant agitation; he never went to bed at night\nwithout visiting every room; he no longer slept, or, if he did, he\nwould waken with a start at the slightest noise, ready to defend\nhimself.",
        "And what still further aggravated Pascal’s sufferings was the\nconstant, the ever more bitter thought that the wound was inflicted\nupon him by the only creature he loved in the world, the adored\nClotilde, whom for twenty years he had seen grow in beauty and in\ngrace, whose life had hitherto bloomed like a beautiful flower,\nperfuming his. She, great God! for whom his heart was full of\naffection, whom he had never analyzed, she, who had become his joy,\nhis courage, his hope, in whose young life he lived over again. When\nshe passed by, with her delicate neck, so round, so fresh, he was\ninvigorated, bathed in health and joy, as at the coming of spring.",
        "His whole life, besides, explained this invasion, this subjugation of\nhis being by the young girl who had entered into his heart while she\nwas still a little child, and who, as she grew up, had gradually taken\npossession of the whole place. Since he had settled at Plassans, he\nhad led a blest existence, wrapped up in his books, far from women.\nThe only passion he was ever known to have had, was his love for the\nlady who had died, whose finger tips he had never kissed. He had not\nlived; he had within him a reserve of youthfulness, of vigor, whose\nsurging flood now clamored rebelliously at the menace of approaching\nage. He would have become attached to an animal, a stray dog that he\nhad chanced to pick up in the street, and that had licked his hand.\nAnd it was this child whom he loved, all at once become an adorable\nwoman, who now distracted him, who tortured him by her hostility.",
        "Pascal, so gay, so kind, now became insupportably gloomy and harsh. He\ngrew angry at the slightest word; he would push aside the astonished\nMartine, who would look up at him with the submissive eyes of a beaten\nanimal. From morning till night he went about the gloomy house,\ncarrying his misery about with him, with so forbidding a countenance\nthat no one ventured to speak to him.",
        "He never took Clotilde with him now on his visits, but went alone. And\nthus it was that he returned home one afternoon, his mind distracted\nbecause of an accident which had happened; having on his conscience,\nas a physician, the death of a man.",
        "He had gone to give a hypodermic injection to Lafouasse, the tavern\nkeeper, whose ataxia had within a short time made such rapid progress\nthat he regarded him as doomed. But, notwithstanding, Pascal still\nfought obstinately against the disease, continuing the treatment, and\nas ill luck would have it, on this day the little syringe had caught\nup at the bottom of the vial an impure particle, which had escaped the\nfilter. Immediately a drop of blood appeared; to complete his\nmisfortune, he had punctured a vein. He was at once alarmed, seeing\nthe tavern keeper turn pale and gasp for breath, while large drops of\ncold perspiration broke out upon his face. Then he understood; death\ncame as if by a stroke of lightning, the lips turning blue, the face\nblack. It was an embolism; he had nothing to blame but the\ninsufficiency of his preparations, his still rude method. No doubt\nLafouasse had been doomed. He could not, perhaps, have lived six\nmonths longer, and that in the midst of atrocious sufferings, but the\nbrutal fact of this terrible death was none the less there, and what\ndespairing regret, what rage against impotent and murderous science,\nand what a shock to his faith! He returned home, livid, and did not\nmake his appearance again until the following day, after having\nremained sixteen hours shut up in his room, lying in a semi-stupor on\nthe bed, across which he had thrown himself, dressed as he was.",
        "On the afternoon of this day Clotilde, who was sitting beside him in\nthe study, sewing, ventured to break the oppressive silence. She\nlooked up, and saw him turning over the leaves of a book wearily,\nsearching for some information which he was unable to find.",
        "“Master, are you ill? Why do you not tell me, if you are. I would take\ncare of you.”",
        "He kept his eyes bent upon the book, and muttered:",
        "“What does it matter to you whether I am ill or not? I need no one to\ntake care of me.”",
        "She resumed, in a conciliating voice:",
        "“If you have troubles, and can tell them to me, it would perhaps be a\nrelief to you to do so. Yesterday you came in looking so sad. You must\nnot allow yourself to be cast down in that way. I have spent a very\nanxious night. I came to your door three times to listen, tormented by\nthe idea that you were suffering.”",
        "Gently as she spoke, her words were like the cut of a whip. In his\nweak and nervous condition a sudden access of rage made him push away\nthe book and rise up trembling.",
        "“So you spy upon me, then. I cannot even retire to my room without\npeople coming to glue their ears to the walls. Yes, you listen even to\nthe beatings of my heart. You watch for my death, to pillage and burn\neverything here.”",
        "His voice rose and all his unjust suffering vented itself in\ncomplaints and threats.",
        "“I forbid you to occupy yourself about me. Is there nothing else that\nyou have to say to me? Have you reflected? Can you put your hand in\nmine loyally, and say to me that we are in accord?”",
        "She did not answer. She only continued to look at him with her large\nclear eyes, frankly declaring that she would not surrender yet, while\nhe, exasperated more and more by this attitude, lost all self-control.",
        "“Go away, go away,” he stammered, pointing to the door. “I do not wish\nyou to remain near me. I do not wish to have enemies near me. I do not\nwish you to remain near me to drive me mad!”",
        "She rose, very pale, and went at once out of the room, without looking\nbehind, carrying her work with her.",
        "During the month which followed, Pascal took refuge in furious and\nincessant work. He now remained obstinately, for whole days at a time,\nalone in the study, sometimes passing even the nights there, going\nover old documents, to revise all his works on heredity. It seemed as\nif a sort of frenzy had seized him to assure himself of the legitimacy\nof his hopes, to force science to give him the certainty that humanity\ncould be remade–made a higher, a healthy humanity. He no longer left\nthe house, he abandoned his patients even, and lived among his papers,\nwithout air or exercise. And after a month of this overwork, which\nexhausted him without appeasing his domestic torments, he fell into\nsuch a state of nervous exhaustion that illness, for some time latent,\ndeclared itself at last with alarming violence.",
        "Pascal, when he rose in the morning, felt worn out with fatigue,\nwearier and less refreshed than he had been on going to bed the night\nbefore. He constantly had pains all over his body; his limbs failed\nhim, after five minutes’ walk; the slightest exertion tired him; the\nleast movement caused him intense pain. At times the floor seemed\nsuddenly to sway beneath his feet. He had a constant buzzing in his\nears, flashes of light dazzled his eyes. He took a loathing for wine,\nhe had no longer any appetite, and his digestion was seriously\nimpaired. Then, in the midst of the apathy of his constantly\nincreasing idleness he would have sudden fits of aimless activity. The\nequilibrium was destroyed, he had at times outbreaks of nervous\nirritability, without any cause. The slightest emotion brought tears\nto his eyes. Finally, he would shut himself up in his room, and give\nway to paroxysms of despair so violent that he would sob for hours at\na time, without any immediate cause of grief, overwhelmed simply by\nthe immense sadness of things.",
        "In the early part of December Pascal had a severe attack of neuralgia.\nViolent pains in the bones of the skull made him feel at times as if\nhis head must split. Old Mme. Rougon, who had been informed of his\nillness, came to inquire after her son. But she went straight to the\nkitchen, wishing to have a talk with Martine first. The latter, with a\nheart-broken and terrified air, said to her that monsieur must\ncertainly be going mad; and she told her of his singular behavior, the\ncontinual tramping about in his room, the locking of all the drawers,\nthe rounds which he made from the top to the bottom of the house,\nuntil two o’clock in the morning. Tears filled her eyes and she at\nlast hazarded the opinion that monsieur must be possessed with a\ndevil, and that it would be well to notify the cure of St. Saturnin.",
        "“So good a man,” she said, “a man for whom one would let one’s self be\ncut in pieces! How unfortunate it is that one cannot get him to go to\nchurch, for that would certainly cure him at once.”",
        "Clotilde, who had heard her grandmother’s voice, entered at this\nmoment. She, too, wandered through the empty rooms, spending most of\nher time in the deserted apartment on the ground floor. She did not\nspeak, however, but only listened with her thoughtful and expectant\nair.",
        "“Ah, goodday! It is you, my dear. Martine tells me that Pascal is\npossessed with a devil. That is indeed my opinion also; only the devil\nis called pride. He thinks that he knows everything. He is Pope and\nEmperor in one, and naturally it exasperates him when people don’t\nagree with him.”",
        "She shrugged her shoulders with supreme disdain.",
        "“As for me, all that would only make me laugh if it were not so sad. A\nfellow who knows nothing about anything; who has always been wrapped\nup in his books; who has not lived. Put him in a drawing-room, and he\nwould know as little how to act as a new-born babe. And as for women,\nhe does not even know what they are.”",
        "Forgetting to whom she was speaking, a young girl and a servant, she\nlowered her voice, and said confidentially:",
        "“Well, one pays for being too sensible, too. Neither a wife nor a\nsweetheart nor anything. That is what has finally turned his brain.”",
        "Clotilde did not move. She only lowered her eyelids slowly over her\nlarge thoughtful eyes; then she raised them again, maintaining her\nimpenetrable countenance, unwilling, unable, perhaps, to give\nexpression to what was passing within her. This was no doubt all still\nconfused, a complete evolution, a great change which was taking place,\nand which she herself did not clearly understand.",
        "“He is upstairs, is he not?” resumed Felicite. “I have come to see\nhim, for this must end; it is too stupid.”",
        "And she went upstairs, while Martine returned to her saucepans, and\nClotilde went to wander again through the empty house.",
        "Upstairs in the study Pascal sat seemingly in a stupor, his face bent\nover a large open book. He could no longer read, the words danced\nbefore his eyes, conveying no meaning to his mind. But he persisted,\nfor it was death to him to lose his faculty for work, hitherto so\npowerful. His mother at once began to scold him, snatching the book\nfrom him, and flinging it upon a distant table, crying that when one\nwas sick one should take care of one’s self. He rose with a quick,\nangry movement, about to order her away as he had ordered Clotilde.\nThen, by a last effort of the will, he became again deferential.",
        "“Mother, you know that I have never wished to dispute with you. Leave\nme, I beg of you.”",
        "She did not heed him, but began instead to take him to task about his\ncontinual distrust. It was he himself who had given himself a fever,\nalways fancying that he was surrounded by enemies who were setting\ntraps for him, and watching him to rob him. Was there any common sense\nin imagining that people were persecuting him in that way? And then\nshe accused him of allowing his head to be turned by his discovery,\nhis famous remedy for curing every disease. That was as much as to\nthink himself equal to the good God; which only made it all the more\ncruel when he found out how mistaken he was. And she mentioned\nLafouasse, the man whom he had killed–naturally, she could understand\nthat that had not been very pleasant for him; indeed there was cause\nenough in it to make him take to his bed.",
        "Pascal, still controlling himself, very pale and with eyes cast on the\nground, contented himself with repeating:",
        "“Mother, leave me, I beg of you.”",
        "“No, I won’t leave you,” she cried with the impetuosity which was\nnatural to her, and which her great age had in no wise diminished. “I\nhave come precisely to stir you up a little, to rid you of this fever\nwhich is consuming you. No, this cannot continue. I don’t wish that we\nshould again become the talk of the whole town on your account. I wish\nyou to take care of yourself.”",
        "He shrugged his shoulders, and said in a low voice, as if speaking to\nhimself, with an uneasy look, half of conviction, half of doubt:",
        "“I am not ill.”",
        "But Felicite, beside herself, burst out, gesticulating violently:",
        "“Not ill! not ill! Truly, there is no one like a physician for not\nbeing able to see himself. Why, my poor boy, every one that comes near\nyou is shocked by your appearance. You are becoming insane through\npride and fear!”",
        "This time Pascal raised his head quickly, and looked her straight in\nthe eyes, while she continued:",
        "“This is what I had to tell you, since it seems that no one else would\nundertake the task. You are old enough to know what you ought to do.\nYou should make an effort to shake off all this; you should think of\nsomething else; you should not let a fixed idea take possession of\nyou, especially when you belong to a family like ours. You know it;\nhave sense, and take care of yourself.”",
        "He grew paler than before, looking fixedly at her still, as if he were\nsounding her, to know what there was of her in him. And he contented\nhimself with answering:",
        "“You are right, mother. I thank you.”",
        "When he was again alone, he dropped into his seat before the table,\nand tried once more to read his book. But he could not succeed, any\nmore than before, in fixing his attention sufficiently to understand\nthe words, whose letters mingled confusedly together before his eyes.\nAnd his mother’s words buzzed in his ears; a vague terror, which had\nsome time before sprung up within him, grew and took shape, haunting\nhim now as an immediate and clearly defined danger. He who two months\nbefore had boasted triumphantly of not belonging to the family, was he\nabout to receive the most terrible of contradictions? Ah, this\negotistic joy, this intense joy of not belonging to it, was it to give\nplace to the terrible anguish of being struck in his turn? Was he to\nhave the humiliation of seeing the taint revive in him? Was he to be\ndragged down to the horror of feeling himself in the clutches of the\nmonster of heredity? The sublime idea, the lofty certitude which he\nhad of abolishing suffering, of strengthening man’s will, of making a\nnew and a higher humanity, a healthy humanity, was assuredly only the\nbeginning of the monomania of vanity. And in his bitter complaint of\nbeing watched, in his desire to watch the enemies who, he thought,\nwere obstinately bent on his destruction, were easily to be recognized\nthe symptoms of the monomania of suspicion. So then all the diseases\nof the race were to end in this terrible case–madness within a brief\nspace, then general paralysis, and a dreadful death.",
        "From this day forth Pascal was as if possessed. The state of nervous\nexhaustion into which overwork and anxiety had thrown him left him an\nunresisting prey to this haunting fear of madness and death. All the\nmorbid sensations which he felt, his excessive fatigue on rising, the\nbuzzing in his ears, the flashes of light before his eyes, even his\nattacks of indigestion and his paroxysms of tears, were so many\ninfallible symptoms of the near insanity with which he believed\nhimself threatened. He had completely lost, in his own case, the keen\npower of diagnosis of the observant physician, and if he still\ncontinued to reason about it, it was only to confound and pervert\nsymptoms, under the influence of the moral and physical depression\ninto which he had fallen. He was no longer master of himself; he was\nmad, so to say, to convince himself hour by hour that he must become\nso.",
        "All the days of this pale December were spent by him in going deeper\nand deeper into his malady. Every morning he tried to escape from the\nhaunting subject, but he invariably ended by shutting himself in the\nstudy to take up again, in spite of himself, the tangled skein of the\nday before.",
        "The long study which he had made of heredity, his important\nresearches, his works, completed the poisoning of his peace,\nfurnishing him with ever renewed causes of disquietude. To the\nquestion which he put to himself continually as to his own hereditary\ncase, the documents were there to answer it by all possible\ncombinations. They were so numerous that he lost himself among them\nnow. If he had deceived himself, if he could not set himself apart, as\na remarkable case of variation, should he place himself under the head\nof reversional heredity, passing over one, two, or even three\ngenerations? Or was his case rather a manifestation of larvated\nheredity, which would bring anew proof to the support of his theory of\nthe germ plasm, or was it simply a singular case of hereditary\nresemblance, the sudden apparition of some unknown ancestor at the\nvery decline of life?",
        "From this moment he never rested, giving himself up completely to the\ninvestigation of his case, searching his notes, rereading his books.\nAnd he studied himself, watching the least of his sensations, to\ndeduce from them the facts on which he might judge himself. On the\ndays when his mind was most sluggish, or when he thought he\nexperienced particular phenomena of vision, he inclined to a\npredominance of the original nervous lesion; while, if he felt that\nhis limbs were affected, his feet heavy and painful, he imagined he\nwas suffering the indirect influence of some ancestor come from\noutside. Everything became confused, until at last he could recognize\nhimself no longer, in the midst of the imaginary troubles which\nagitated his disturbed organism. And every evening the conclusion was\nthe same, the same knell sounded in his brain–heredity, appalling\nheredity, the fear of becoming mad.",
        "In the early part of January Clotilde was an involuntary spectator of\na scene which wrung her heart. She was sitting before one of the\nwindows of the study, reading, concealed by the high back of her\nchair, when she saw Pascal, who had been shut up in his room since the\nday before, entering. He held open before his eyes with both hands a\nsheet of yellow paper, in which she recognized the genealogical tree.\nHe was so completely absorbed, his gaze was so fixed, that she might\nhave come forward without his observing her. He spread the tree upon\nthe table, continuing to look at it for a long time, with the\nterrified expression of interrogation which had become habitual to\nhim, which gradually changed to one of supplication, the tears\ncoursing down his cheeks.",
        "Why, great God! would not the tree answer him, and tell him what\nancestor he resembled, in order that he might inscribe his case on his\nown leaf, beside the others? If he was to become mad, why did not the\ntree tell him so clearly, which would have calmed him, for he believed\nthat his suffering came only from his uncertainty? Tears clouded his\nvision, yet still he looked, he exhausted himself in this longing to\nknow, in which his reason must finally give way.",
        "Clotilde hastily concealed herself as she saw him walk over to the\npress, which he opened wide. He seized the envelopes, threw them on\nthe table, and searched among them feverishly. It was the scene of the\nterrible night of the storm that was beginning over again, the gallop\nof nightmares, the procession of phantoms, rising at his call from\nthis heap of old papers. As they passed by, he addressed to each of\nthem a question, an ardent prayer, demanding the origin of his malady,\nhoping for a word, a whisper which should set his doubts at rest.\nFirst, it was only an indistinct murmur, then came words and fragments\nof phrases.",
        "“Is it you–is it you–is it you–oh, old mother, the mother of us\nall–who are to give me your madness? Is it you, inebriate uncle, old\nscoundrel of an uncle, whose drunkenness I am to pay for? Is it you,\nataxic nephew, or you, mystic nephew, or yet you, idiot niece, who are\nto reveal to me the truth, showing me one of the forms of the lesion\nfrom which I suffer? Or is it rather you, second cousin, who hanged\nyourself; or you, second cousin, who committed murder; or you, second\ncousin, who died of rottenness, whose tragic ends announce to me mine\n–death in a cell, the horrible decomposition of being?”",
        "And the gallop continued, they rose and passed by with the speed of\nthe wind. The papers became animate, incarnate, they jostled one\nanother, they trampled on one another, in a wild rush of suffering\nhumanity.",
        "“Ah, who will tell me, who will tell me, who will tell me?–Is it he\nwho died mad? he who was carried off by phthisis? he who was killed by\nparalysis? she whose constitutional feebleness caused her to die in\nearly youth?–Whose is the poison of which I am to die? What is it,\nhysteria, alcoholism, tuberculosis, scrofula? And what is it going to\nmake of me, an ataxic or a madman? A madman. Who was it said a madman?\nThey all say it–a madman, a madman, a madman!”",
        "Sobs choked Pascal. He let his dejected head fall among the papers, he\nwept endlessly, shaken by shuddering sobs. And Clotilde, seized by a\nsort of awe, feeling the presence of the fate which rules over races,\nleft the room softly, holding her breath; for she knew that it would\nmortify him exceedingly if he knew that she had been present.",
        "Long periods of prostration followed. January was very cold. But the\nsky remained wonderfully clear, a brilliant sun shone in the limpid\nblue; and at La Souleiade, the windows of the study facing south\nformed a sort of hothouse, preserving there a delightfully mild\ntemperature. They did not even light a fire, for the room was always\nfilled with a flood of sunshine, in which the flies that had survived\nthe winter flew about lazily. The only sound to be heard was the\nbuzzing of their wings. It was a close and drowsy warmth, like a\nbreath of spring that had lingered in the old house baked by the heat\nof summer.",
        "Pascal, still gloomy, dragged through the days there, and it was\nthere, too, that he overheard one day the closing words of a\nconversation which aggravated his suffering. As he never left his room\nnow before breakfast, Clotilde had received Dr. Ramond this morning in\nthe study, and they were talking there together in an undertone,\nsitting beside each other in the bright sunshine.",
        "It was the third visit which Ramond had made during the last week.\nPersonal reasons, the necessity, especially, of establishing\ndefinitely his position as a physician at Plassans, made it expedient\nfor him not to defer his marriage much longer: and he wished to obtain\nfrom Clotilde a decisive answer. On each of his former visits the\npresence of a third person had prevented him from speaking. As he\ndesired to receive her answer from herself directly he had resolved to\ndeclare himself to her in a frank conversation. Their intimate\nfriendship, and the discretion and good sense of both, justified him\nin taking this step. And he ended, smiling, looking into her eyes:",
        "“I assure you, Clotilde, that it is the most reasonable of\ndenouements. You know that I have loved you for a long time. I have\na profound affection and esteem for you. That alone might perhaps not\nbe sufficient, but, in addition, we understand each other perfectly,\nand we should be very happy together, I am convinced of it.”",
        "She did not cast down her eyes; she, too, looked at him frankly, with\na friendly smile. He was, in truth, very handsome, in his vigorous\nyoung manhood.",
        "“Why do you not marry Mlle. Leveque, the lawyer’s daughter?” she\nasked. “She is prettier and richer than I am, and I know that she\nwould gladly accept you. My dear friend, I fear that you are\ncommitting a folly in choosing me.”",
        "He did not grow impatient, seeming still convinced of the wisdom of\nhis determination.",
        "“But I do not love Mlle. Leveque, and I do love you. Besides, I have\nconsidered everything, and I repeat that I know very well what I am\nabout. Say yes; you can take no better course.”",
        "Then she grew very serious, and a shadow passed over her face, the\nshadow of those reflections, of those almost unconscious inward\nstruggles, which kept her silent for days at a time. She did not see\nclearly yet, she still struggled against herself, and she wished to\nwait.",
        "“Well, my friend, since you are really serious, do not ask me to give\nyou an answer to-day; grant me a few weeks longer. Master is indeed\nvery ill. I am greatly troubled about him; and you would not like to\nowe my consent to a hasty impulse. I assure you, for my part, that I\nhave a great deal of affection for you, but it would be wrong to\ndecide at this moment; the house is too unhappy. It is agreed, is it\nnot? I will not make you wait long.”",
        "And to change the conversation she added:",
        "“Yes, I am uneasy about master. I wished to see you, in order to tell\nyou so. The other day I surprised him weeping violently, and I am\ncertain the fear of becoming mad haunts him. The day before yesterday,\nwhen you were talking to him, I saw that you were examining him. Tell\nme frankly, what do you think of his condition? Is he in any danger?”",
        "“Not the slightest!” exclaimed Dr. Ramond. “His system is a little out\nof order, that is all. How can a man of his ability, who has made so\nclose a study of nervous diseases, deceive himself to such an extent?\nIt is discouraging, indeed, if the clearest and most vigorous minds\ncan go so far astray. In his case his own discovery of hypodermic\ninjections would be excellent. Why does he not use them with himself?”",
        "And as the young girl replied, with a despairing gesture, that he\nwould not listen to her, that he would not even allow her to speak to\nhim now, Ramond said:",
        "“Well, then, I will speak to him.”",
        "It was at this moment that Pascal came out of his room, attracted by\nthe sound of voices. But on seeing them both so close to each other,\nso animated, so youthful, and so handsome in the sunshine–clothed\nwith sunshine, as it were–he stood still in the doorway. He looked\nfixedly at them, and his pale face altered.",
        "Ramond had a moment before taken Clotilde’s hand, and he was holding\nit in his.",
        "“It is a promise, is it not? I should like the marriage to take place\nthis summer. You know how much I love you, and I shall eagerly await\nyour answer.”",
        "“Very well,” she answered. “Before a month all will be settled.”",
        "A sudden giddiness made Pascal stagger. Here now was this boy, his\nfriend, his pupil, who had introduced himself into his house to rob\nhim of his treasure! He ought to have expected this denouement, yet\nthe sudden news of a possible marriage surprised him, overwhelmed him\nlike an unforeseen catastrophe that had forever ruined his life. This\ngirl whom he had fashioned, whom he had believed his own, she would\nleave him, then, without regret, she would leave him to die alone in\nhis solitude. Only the day before she had made him suffer so intensely\nthat he had asked himself whether he should not part from her and send\nher to her brother, who was always writing for her. For an instant he\nhad even decided on this separation, for the good of both. Yet to find\nher here suddenly, with this man, to hear her promise to give him an\nanswer, to think that she would marry, that she would soon leave him,\nthis stabbed him to the heart.",
        "At the sound of his heavy step as he came forward, the two young\npeople turned round in some embarrassment.",
        "“Why, master, we were just talking about you,” said Ramond gaily.\n\"Yes, to be frank with you, we were conspiring. Come, why do you not\ntake care of yourself? There is nothing serious the matter with you;\nyou would be on your feet again in a fortnight if you did.”",
        "Pascal, who had dropped into a chair, continued to look at them. He\nhad still the power to control himself, and his countenance gave no\nevidence of the wound which he had just received. He would assuredly\ndie of it, and no one would suspect the malady which had carried him\noff. But it was a relief to him to be able to give vent to his\nfeelings, and he declared violently that he would not take even so\nmuch as a glass of tisane.",
        "“Take care of myself!” he cried; “what for? Is it not all over with my\nold carcass?”",
        "Ramond insisted, with a good-tempered smile.",
        "“You are sounder than any of us. This is a trifling disturbance, and\nyou know that you have the remedy in your own hands. Use your\nhypodermic injection.”",
        "Pascal did not allow him to finish. This filled the measure of his\nrage. He angrily asked if they wished him to kill himself, as he had\nkilled Lafouasse. His injections! A pretty invention, of which he had\ngood reason to be proud. He abjured medicine, and he swore that he\nwould never again go near a patient. When people were no longer good\nfor anything they ought to die; that would be the best thing for\neverybody. And that was what he was going to try to do, so as to have\ndone with it all.",
        "“Bah! bah!” said Ramond at last, resolving to take his leave, through\nfear of exciting him still further; “I will leave you with Clotilde; I\nam not at all uneasy, Clotilde will take care of you.”",
        "But Pascal had on this morning received the final blow. He took to his\nbed toward evening, and remained for two whole days without opening\nthe door of his room. It was in vain that Clotilde, at last becoming\nalarmed, knocked loudly at the door. There was no answer. Martine went\nin her turn and begged monsieur, through the keyhole, at least to tell\nher if he needed anything. A deathlike silence reigned; the room\nseemed to be empty.",
        "Then, on the morning of the third day, as the young girl by chance\nturned the knob, the door yielded; perhaps it had been unlocked for\nhours. And she might enter freely this room in which she had never set\nfoot: a large room, rendered cold by its northern exposure, in which\nshe saw a small iron bed without curtains, a shower bath in a corner,\na long black wooden table, a few chairs, and on the table, on the\nfloor, along the walls, an array of chemical apparatus, mortars,\nfurnaces, machines, instrument cases. Pascal, up and dressed, was\nsitting on the edge of his bed, in trying to arrange which he had\nexhausted himself.",
        "“Don’t you want me to nurse you, then?” she asked with anxious\ntenderness, without venturing to advance into the room.",
        "“Oh, you can come in,” he said with a dejected gesture. “I won’t beat\nyou. I have not the strength to do that now.”",
        "And from this day on he tolerated her about him, and allowed her to\nwait on him. But he had caprices still. He would not let her enter the\nroom when he was in bed, possessed by a sort of morbid shame; then he\nmade her send him Martine. But he seldom remained in bed, dragging\nhimself about from chair to chair, in his utter inability to do any\nkind of work. His malady continued to grow worse, until at last he was\nreduced to utter despair, tortured by sick headaches, and without the\nstrength, as he said, to put one foot before the other, convinced\nevery morning that he would spend the night at the Tulettes, a raving\nmaniac. He grew thin; his face, under its crown of white hair–which\nhe still cared for through a last remnant of vanity–acquired a look\nof suffering, of tragic beauty. And although he allowed himself to be\nwaited on, he refused roughly all remedies, in the distrust of\nmedicine into which he had fallen.",
        "Clotilde now devoted herself to him entirely. She gave up everything\nelse; at first she attended low mass, then she left off going to\nchurch altogether. In her impatience for some certain happiness, she\nfelt as if she were taking a step toward that end by thus devoting all\nher moments to the service of a beloved being whom she wished to see\nonce more well and happy. She made a complete sacrifice of herself,\nshe sought to find happiness in the happiness of another; and all this\nunconsciously, solely at the impulse of her woman’s heart, in the\nmidst of the crisis through which she was still passing, and which was\nmodifying her character profoundly, without her knowledge. She\nremained silent regarding the disagreement which separated them. The\nidea did not again occur to her to throw herself on his neck, crying\nthat she was his, that he might return to life, since she gave herself\nto him. In her thoughts she grieved to see him suffer; she was only an\naffectionate girl, who took care of him, as any female relative would\nhave done. And her attentions were very pure, very delicate, occupying\nher life so completely that her days now passed swiftly, exempt from\ntormenting thoughts of the Beyond, filled with the one wish of curing\nhim.",
        "But where she had a hard battle to fight was in prevailing upon him to\nuse his hypodermic injections upon himself. He flew into a passion,\ndisowned his discovery, and called himself an imbecile. She too cried\nout. It was she now who had faith in science, who grew indignant at\nseeing him doubt his own genius. He resisted for a long time; then\nyielding to the empire which she had acquired over him, he consented,\nsimply to avoid the affectionate dispute which she renewed with him\nevery morning. From the very first he experienced great relief from\nthe injections, although he refused to acknowledge it. His mind became\nclearer, and he gradually gained strength. Then she was exultant,\nfilled with enthusiastic pride in him. She vaunted his treatment, and\nbecame indignant because he did not admire himself, as an example of\nthe miracles which he was able to work. He smiled; he was now\nbeginning to see clearly into his own condition. Ramond had spoken\ntruly, his illness had been nothing but nervous exhaustion. Perhaps he\nwould get over it after all.",
        "“Ah, it is you who are curing me, little girl,” he would say, not\nwishing to confess his hopes. “Medicines, you see, act according to\nthe hand that gives them.”",
        "The convalescence was slow, lasting through the whole of February. The\nweather remained clear and cold; there was not a single day in which\nthe study was not flooded with warm, pale sunshine. There were hours\nof relapse, however, hours of the blackest melancholy, in which all\nthe patient’s terrors returned; when his guardian, disconsolate, was\nobliged to sit at the other end of the room, in order not to irritate\nhim still more. He despaired anew of his recovery. He became again\nbitter and aggressively ironical.",
        "It was on one of those bad days that Pascal, approaching a window, saw\nhis neighbor, M. Bellombre, the retired professor, making the round of\nhis garden to see if his fruit trees were well covered with blossoms.\nThe sight of the old man, so neat and so erect, with the fine\nplacidity of the egoist, on whom illness had apparently never laid\nhold, suddenly put Pascal beside himself.",
        "“Ah!” he growled, “there is one who will never overwork himself, who\nwill never endanger his health by worrying!”",
        "And he launched forth into an ironical eulogy on selfishness. To be\nalone in the world, not to have a friend, to have neither wife nor\nchild, what happiness! That hard-hearted miser, who for forty years\nhad had only other people’s children to cuff, who lived aloof from the\nworld, without even a dog, with a deaf and dumb gardener older than\nhimself, was he not an example of the greatest happiness possible on\nearth? Without a responsibility, without a duty, without an anxiety,\nother than that of taking care of his dear health! He was a wise man,\nhe would live a hundred years.",
        "“Ah, the fear of life! that is cowardice which is truly the best\nwisdom. To think that I should ever have regretted not having a child\nof my own! Has any one a right to bring miserable creatures into the\nworld? Bad heredity should be ended, life should be ended. The only\nhonest man is that old coward there!”",
        "M. Bellombre continued peacefully making the round of his pear trees\nin the March sunshine. He did not risk a too hasty movement; he\neconomized his fresh old age. If he met a stone in his path, he pushed\nit aside with the end of his cane, and then walked tranquilly on.",
        "“Look at him! Is he not well preserved; is he not handsome? Have not\nall the blessings of heaven been showered down upon him? He is the\nhappiest man I know.”",
        "Clotilde, who had listened in silence, suffered from the irony of\nPascal, the full bitterness of which she divined. She, who usually\ntook M. Bellombre’s part, felt a protest rise up within her. Tears\ncame to her eyes, and she answered simply in a low voice:",
        "“Yes; but he is not loved.”",
        "These words put a sudden end to the painful scene. Pascal, as if he\nhad received an electric shock, turned and looked at her. A sudden\nrush of tenderness brought tears to his eyes also, and he left the\nroom to keep from weeping.",
        "The days wore on in the midst of these alternations of good and bad\nhours. He recovered his strength but slowly, and what put him in\ndespair was that whenever he attempted to work he was seized by a\nprofuse perspiration. If he had persisted, he would assuredly have\nfainted. So long as he did not work he felt that his convalescence was\nmaking little progress. He began to take an interest again, however,\nin his accustomed investigations. He read over again the last pages\nthat he had written, and, with this reawakening of the scientist in\nhim, his former anxieties returned. At one time he fell into a state\nof such depression, that the house and all it contained ceased to\nexist for him. He might have been robbed, everything he possessed\nmight have been taken and destroyed, without his even being conscious\nof the disaster. Now he became again watchful, from time to time he\nwould feel his pocket, to assure himself that the key of the press was\nthere.",
        "But one morning when he had overslept himself, and did not leave his\nroom until eleven o’clock, he saw Clotilde in the study, quietly\noccupied in copying with great exactness in pastel a branch of\nflowering almond. She looked up, smiling; and taking a key that was\nlying beside her on the desk, she offered it to him, saying:",
        "“Here, master.”",
        "Surprised, not yet comprehending, he looked at the object which she\nheld toward him.",
        "“What is that?” he asked.",
        "“It is the key of the press, which you must have dropped from your\npocket yesterday, and which I picked up here this morning.”",
        "Pascal took it with extraordinary emotion. He looked at it, and then\nat Clotilde. Was it ended, then? She would persecute him no more. She\nwas no longer eager to rob everything, to burn everything. And seeing\nher still smiling, she also looking moved, an immense joy filled his\nheart.",
        "He caught her in his arms, crying:",
        "“Ah, little girl, if we might only not be too unhappy!”",
        "Then he opened a drawer of his table and threw the key into it, as he\nused to do formerly.",
        "From this time on he gained strength, and his convalescence progressed\nmore rapidly. Relapses were still possible, for he was still very\nweak. But he was able to write, and this made the days less heavy. The\nsun, too, shone more brightly, the study being so warm at times that\nit became necessary to half close the shutters. He refused to see\nvisitors, barely tolerated Martine, and had his mother told that he\nwas sleeping, when she came at long intervals to inquire for him. He\nwas happy only in this delightful solitude, nursed by the rebel, the\nenemy of yesterday, the docile pupil of to-day. They would often sit\ntogether in silence for a long time, without feeling any constraint.\nThey meditated, or lost themselves in infinitely sweet reveries.",
        "One day, however, Pascal seemed very grave. He was now convinced that\nhis illness had resulted from purely accidental causes, and that\nheredity had had no part in it. But this filled him none the less with\nhumility.",
        "“My God!” he murmured, “how insignificant we are! I who thought myself\nso strong, who was so proud of my sane reason! And here have I barely\nescaped being made insane by a little trouble and overwork!”",
        "He was silent, and sank again into thought. After a time his eyes\nbrightened, he had conquered himself. And in a moment of reason and\ncourage, he came to a resolution.",
        "“If I am getting better,” he said, “it is especially for your sake\nthat I am glad.”",
        "Clotilde, not understanding, looked up and said:",
        "“How is that?”",
        "“Yes, on account of your marriage. Now you will be able to fix the\nday.”",
        "She still seemed surprised.",
        "“Ah, true–my marriage!”",
        "“Shall we decide at once upon the second week in June?”",
        "“Yes, the second week in June; that will do very well.”",
        "They spoke no more; she fixed her eyes again on the piece of sewing on\nwhich she was engaged, while he, motionless, and with a grave face,\nsat looking into space.",
        "On this day, on arriving at La Souleiade, old Mme. Rougon perceived\nMartine in the kitchen garden, engaged in planting leeks; and, as she\nsometimes did, she went over to the servant to have a chat with her,\nand find out from her how things were going on, before entering the\nhouse.",
        "For some time past she had been in despair about what she called\nClotilde’s desertion. She felt truly that she would now never obtain\nthe documents through her. The girl was behaving disgracefully, she\nwas siding with Pascal, after all she had done for her; and she was\nbecoming perverted to such a degree that for a month past she had not\nbeen seen in Church. Thus she returned to her first idea, to get\nClotilde away and win her son over when, left alone, he should be\nweakened by solitude. Since she had not been able to persuade the girl\nto go live with her brother, she eagerly desired the marriage. She\nwould like to throw her into Dr. Ramond’s arms to-morrow, in her\nimpatience at so many delays. And she had come this afternoon with a\nfeverish desire to hurry on matters.",
        "“Good-day, Martine. How is every one here?”",
        "The servant, kneeling down, her hands full of clay, lifted up her pale\nface, protected against the sun by a handkerchief tied over her cap.",
        "“As usual, madame, pretty well.”",
        "They went on talking, Felicite treating her as a confidante, as a\ndevoted daughter, one of the family, to whom she could tell\neverything. She began by questioning her; she wished to know if Dr.\nRamond had come that morning. He had come, but they had talked only\nabout indifferent matters. This put her in despair, for she had seen\nthe doctor on the previous day, and he had unbosomed himself to her,\nchagrined at not having yet received a decisive answer, and eager now\nto obtain at least Clotilde’s promise. Things could not go on in this\nway, the young girl must be compelled to engage herself to him.",
        "“He has too much delicacy,” she cried. “I have told him so. I knew\nvery well that this morning, even, he would not venture to demand a\npositive answer. And I have come to interfere in the matter. We shall\nsee if I cannot oblige her to come to a decision.”",
        "Then, more calmly:",
        "“My son is on his feet now; he does not need her.”",
        "Martine, who was again stooping over the bed, planting her leeks,\nstraightened herself quickly.",
        "“Ah, that for sure!”",
        "And a flush passed over her face, worn by thirty years of service. For\na wound bled within her; for some time past the master scarcely\ntolerated her about him. During the whole time of his illness he had\nkept her at a distance, accepting her services less and less every\nday, and finally closing altogether to her the door of his room and of\nthe workroom. She had a vague consciousness of what was taking place,\nan instinctive jealousy tortured her, in her adoration of the master,\nwhose chattel she had been satisfied to be for so many years.",
        "“For sure, we have no need of mademoiselle. I am quite able to take\ncare of monsieur.”",
        "Then she, who was so discreet, spoke of her labors in the garden,\nsaying that she made time to cultivate the vegetables, so as to save a\nfew days’ wages of a man. True, the house was large, but when one was\nnot afraid of work, one could manage to do all there was to be done.\nAnd then, when mademoiselle should have left them, that would be\nalways one less to wait upon. And her eyes brightened unconsciously at\nthe thought of the great solitude, of the happy peace in which they\nshould live after this departure.",
        "“It would give me pain,” she said, lowering her voice, “for it would\ncertainly give monsieur a great deal. I would never have believed that\nI could be brought to wish for such a separation. Only, madame, I\nagree with you that it is necessary, for I am greatly afraid that\nmademoiselle will end by going to ruin here, and that there will be\nanother soul lost to the good God. Ah, it is very sad; my heart is so\nheavy about it sometimes that it is ready to burst.”",
        "“They are both upstairs, are they not?” said Felicite. “I will go up\nand see them, and I will undertake to oblige them to end the matter.”",
        "An hour later, when she came down again, she found Martine still on\nher knees on the soft earth, finishing her planting. Upstairs, from\nher first words, when she said that she had been talking with Dr.\nRamond, and that he had shown himself anxious to know his fate\nquickly, she saw that Dr. Pascal approved–he looked grave, he nodded\nhis head as if to say that this wish seemed to him very natural.\nClotilde, herself, ceasing to smile, seemed to listen to him with\ndeference. But she manifested some surprise. Why did they press her?\nMaster had fixed the marriage for the second week in June; she had,\nthen, two full months before her. Very soon she would speak about it\nwith Ramond. Marriage was so serious a matter that they might very\nwell give her time to reflect, and let her wait until the last moment\nto engage herself. And she said all this with her air of good sense,\nlike a person resolved on coming to a decision. And Felicite was\nobliged to content herself with the evident desire that both had that\nmatters should have the most reasonable conclusion.",
        "“Indeed I believe that it is settled,” ended Felicite. “He seems to\nplace no obstacle in the way, and she seems only to wish not to act\nhastily, like a girl who desires to examine her heart closely, before\nengaging herself for life. I will give her a week more for\nreflection.”",
        "Martine, sitting on her heels, was looking fixedly on the ground with\na clouded face.",
        "“Yes, yes,” she murmured, in a low voice, “mademoiselle has been\nreflecting a great deal of late. I am always meeting her in some\ncorner. You speak to her, and she does not answer you. That is the way\npeople are when they are breeding a disease, or when they have a\nsecret on their mind. There is something going on; she is no longer\nthe same, no longer the same.”",
        "And she took the dibble again and planted a leek, in her rage for\nwork; while old Mme. Rougon went away, somewhat tranquillized;\ncertain, she said, that the marriage would take place.",
        "Pascal, in effect, seemed to accept Clotilde’s marriage as a thing\nsettled, inevitable. He had not spoken with her about it again, the\nrare allusions which they made to it between themselves, in their\nhourly conversations, left them undisturbed; and it was simply as if\nthe two months which they still had to live together were to be\nwithout end, an eternity stretching beyond their view.",
        "She, especially, would look at him smiling, putting off to a future\nday troubles and decisions with a pretty vague gesture, as if to leave\neverything to beneficent life. He, now well and gaining strength\ndaily, grew melancholy only when he returned to the solitude of his\nchamber at night, after she had retired. He shuddered and turned cold\nat the thought that a time would come when he would be always alone.\nWas it the beginning of old age that made him shiver in this way? He\nseemed to see it stretching before him, like a shadowy region in which\nhe already began to feel all his energy melting away. And then the\nregret of having neither wife nor child filled him with\nrebelliousness, and wrung his heart with intolerable anguish.",
        "Ah, why had he not lived! There were times when he cursed science,\naccusing it of having taken from him the best part of his manhood. He\nhad let himself be devoured by work; work had consumed his brain,\nconsumed his heart, consumed his flesh. All this solitary, passionate\nlabor had produced only books, blackened paper, that would be\nscattered to the winds, whose cold leaves chilled his hands as he\nturned them over. And no living woman’s breast to lean upon, no\nchild’s warm locks to kiss! He had lived the cold, solitary life of a\nselfish scientist, and he would die in cold solitude. Was he indeed\ngoing to die thus? Would he never taste the happiness enjoyed by even\nthe common porters, by the carters who cracked their whips, passing by\nunder his windows? But he must hasten, if he would; soon, no doubt, it\nwould be too late. All his unemployed youth, all his pent-up desires,\nsurged tumultuously through his veins. He swore that he would yet\nlove, that he would live a new life, that he would drain the cup of\nevery passion that he had not yet tasted, before he should be an old\nman. He would knock at the doors, he would stop the passers-by, he\nwould scour the fields and town.",
        "On the following day, when he had taken his shower bath and left his\nroom, all his fever was calmed, the burning pictures had faded away,\nand he fell back into his natural timidity. Then, on the next night,\nthe fear of solitude drove sleep away as before, his blood kindled\nagain, and the same despair, the same rebelliousness, the same longing\nnot to die without having known family joys returned. He suffered a\ngreat deal in this crisis.",
        "During these feverish nights, with eyes wide open in the darkness, he\ndreamed always, over and over again the same dream. A girl would come\nalong the road, a girl of twenty, marvelously beautiful; and she would\nenter and kneel down before him in an attitude of submissive\nadoration, and he would marry her. She was one of those pilgrims of\nlove such as we find in ancient story, who have followed a star to\ncome and restore health and strength to some aged king, powerful and\ncovered with glory. He was the aged king, and she adored him, she\nwrought the miracle, with her twenty years, of bestowing on him a part\nof her youth. In her love he recovered his courage and his faith in\nlife.",
        "Ah, youth! he hungered fiercely for it. In his declining days this\npassionate longing for youth was like a revolt against approaching\nage, a desperate desire to turn back, to be young again, to begin life\nover again. And in this longing to begin life over again, there was\nnot only regret for the vanished joys of youth, the inestimable\ntreasure of dead hours, to which memory lent its charm; there was also\nthe determined will to enjoy, now, his health and strength, to lose\nnothing of the joy of loving! Ah, youth! how eagerly he would taste of\nits every pleasure, how eagerly he would drain every cup, before his\nteeth should fall out, before his limbs should grow feeble, before the\nblood should be chilled in his veins. A pang pierced his heart when he\nremembered himself, a slender youth of twenty, running and leaping\nagilely, vigorous and hardy as a young oak, his teeth glistening, his\nhair black and luxuriant. How he would cherish them, these gifts\nscorned before, if a miracle could restore them to him!",
        "And youthful womanhood, a young girl who might chance to pass by,\ndisturbed him, causing him profound emotion. This was often even\naltogether apart from the individual: the image, merely, of youth, the\nperfume and the dazzling freshness which emanated from it, bright\neyes, healthy lips, blooming cheeks, a delicate neck, above all,\nrounded and satin-smooth, shaded on the back with down; and youthful\nwomanhood always presented itself to him tall and slight, divinely\nslender in its chaste nudeness. His eyes, gazing into vacancy,\nfollowed the vision, his heart was steeped in infinite longing. There\nwas nothing good or desirable but youth; it was the flower of the\nworld, the only beauty, the only joy, the only true good, with health,\nwhich nature could bestow on man. Ah, to begin life over again, to be\nyoung again, to clasp in his embrace youthful womanhood!",
        "Pascal and Clotilde, now that the fine April days had come, covering\nthe fruit trees with blossoms, resumed their morning walks in La\nSouleiade. It was the first time that he had gone out since his\nillness, and she led him to the threshing yard, along the paths in the\npine wood, and back again to the terrace crossed by the two bars of\nshadows thrown by the secular cypresses. The sun had already warmed\nthe old flagstones there, and the wide horizon stretched out under a\ndazzling sky.",
        "One morning when Clotilde had been running, she returned to the house\nin such exuberant spirits and so full of pleasant excitement that she\nwent up to the workroom without taking off either her garden hat or\nthe lace scarf which she had tied around her neck.",
        "“Oh,” she said, “I am so warm! And how stupid I am, not to have taken\noff my things downstairs. I will go down again at once.”",
        "She had thrown the scarf on a chair on entering.",
        "But her feverish fingers became impatient when she tried to untie the\nstrings of her large straw hat.",
        "“There, now! I have fastened the knot. I cannot undo it, and you must\ncome to my assistance.”",
        "Pascal, happy and excited too by the pleasure of the walk, rejoiced to\nsee her so beautiful and so merry. He went over and stood in front of\nher.",
        "“Wait; hold up your chin. Oh, if you keep moving like that, how do you\nsuppose I can do it?”",
        "She laughed aloud. He could see the laughter swelling her throat, like\na wave of sound. His fingers became entangled under her chin, that\ndelicious part of the throat whose warm satin he involuntarily\ntouched. She had on a gown cut sloping in the neck, and through the\nopening he inhaled all the living perfume of the woman, the pure\nfragrance of her youth, warmed by the sunshine. All at once a vertigo\nseized him and he thought he was going to faint.",
        "“No, no! I cannot do it,” he said, “unless you keep still!”",
        "The blood throbbed in his temples, and his fingers trembled, while she\nleaned further back, unconsciously offering the temptation of her\nfresh girlish beauty. It was the vision of royal youth, the bright\neyes, the healthy lips, the blooming cheeks, above all, the delicate\nneck, satin-smooth and round, shaded on the back by down. And she\nseemed to him so delicately graceful, with her slender throat, in her\ndivine bloom!",
        "“There, it is done!” she cried.",
        "Without knowing how, he had untied the strings. The room whirled\nround, and then he saw her again, bareheaded now, with her starlike\nface, shaking back her golden curls laughingly. Then he was seized\nwith a fear that he would catch her in his arms and press mad kisses\non her bare neck, and arms, and throat. And he fled from the room,\ntaking with him the hat, which he had kept in his hand, saying:",
        "“I will hang it in the hall. Wait for me; I want to speak to Martine.”",
        "Once downstairs, he hurried to the abandoned room and locked himself\ninto it, trembling lest she should become uneasy and come down here to\nseek him. He looked wild and haggard, as if he had just committed a\ncrime. He spoke aloud, and he trembled as he gave utterance for the\nfirst time to the cry that he had always loved her madly,\npassionately. Yes, ever since she had grown into womanhood he had\nadored her. And he saw her clearly before him, as if a curtain had\nbeen suddenly torn aside, as she was when, from an awkward girl, she\nbecame a charming and lovely creature, with her long tapering limbs,\nher strong slender body, with its round throat, round neck, and round\nand supple arms. And it was monstrous, but it was true–he hungered\nfor all this with a devouring hunger, for this youth, this fresh,\nblooming, fragrant flesh.",
        "Then Pascal, dropping into a rickety chair, hid his face in his hands,\nas if to shut out the light of day, and burst into great sobs. Good\nGod! what was to become of him? A girl whom his brother had confided\nto him, whom he had brought up like a good father, and who was now–\nthis temptress of twenty-five–a woman in her supreme omnipotence! He\nfelt himself more defenseless, weaker than a child.",
        "And above this physical desire, he loved her also with an immense\ntenderness, enamored of her moral and intellectual being, of her\nright-mindedness, of her fine intelligence, so fearless and so clear.\nEven their discord, the disquietude about spiritual things by which\nshe was tortured, made her only all the more precious to him, as if\nshe were a being different from himself, in whom he found a little of\nthe infinity of things. She pleased him in her rebellions, when she\nheld her ground against him,–she was his companion and pupil; he saw\nher such as he had made her, with her great heart, her passionate\nfrankness, her triumphant reason. And she was always present with him;\nhe did not believe that he could exist where she was not; he had need\nof her breath; of the flutter of her skirts near him; of her\nthoughtfulness and affection, by which he felt himself constantly\nsurrounded; of her looks; of her smile; of her whole daily woman’s\nlife, which she had given him, which she would not have the cruelty to\ntake back from him again. At the thought that she was going away, that\nshe would not be always here, it seemed to him as if the heavens were\nabout to fall and crush him; as if the end of all things had come; as\nif he were about to be plunged in icy darkness. She alone existed in\nthe world, she alone was lofty and virtuous, intelligent and\nbeautiful, with a miraculous beauty. Why, then, since he adored her\nand since he was her master, did he not go upstairs and take her in\nhis arms and kiss her like an idol? They were both free, she was\nignorant of nothing, she was a woman in age. This would be happiness.",
        "Pascal, who had ceased to weep, rose, and would have walked to the\ndoor. But suddenly he dropped again into his chair, bursting into a\nfresh passion of sobs. No, no, it was abominable, it could not be! He\nfelt on his head the frost of his white hair; and he had a horror of\nhis age, of his fifty-nine years, when he thought of her twenty-five\nyears. His former chill fear again took possession of him, the\ncertainty that she had subjugated him, that he would be powerless\nagainst the daily temptation. And he saw her giving him the strings of\nher hat to untie; compelling him to lean over her to make some\ncorrection in her work; and he saw himself, too, blind, mad, devouring\nher neck with ardent kisses. His indignation against himself at this\nwas so great that he arose, now courageously, and had the strength to\ngo upstairs to the workroom, determined to conquer himself.",
        "Upstairs Clotilde had tranquilly resumed her drawing. She did not even\nlook around at his entrance, but contented herself with saying:",
        "“How long you have been! I was beginning to think that Martine must\nhave made a mistake of at least ten sous in her accounts.”",
        "This customary jest about the servant’s miserliness made him laugh.\nAnd he went and sat down quietly at his table. They did not speak\nagain until breakfast time. A great sweetness bathed him and calmed\nhim, now that he was near her. He ventured to look at her, and he was\ntouched by her delicate profile, by her serious, womanly air of\napplication. Had he been the prey of a nightmare, downstairs, then?\nWould he be able to conquer himself so easily?",
        "“Ah!” he cried, when Martine called them, “how hungry I am! You shall\nsee how I am going to make new muscle!”",
        "She went over to him, and took him by the arm, saying:",
        "“That’s right, master; you must be gay and strong!”",
        "But that night, when he was in his own room, the agony began again. At\nthe thought of losing her he was obliged to bury his face in the\npillow to stifle his cries. He pictured her to himself in the arms of\nanother, and all the tortures of jealousy racked his soul. Never could\nhe find the courage to consent to such a sacrifice. All sorts of plans\nclasped together in his seething brain; he would turn her from the\nmarriage, and keep her with him, without ever allowing her to suspect\nhis passion; he would take her away, and they would go from city to\ncity, occupying their minds with endless studies, in order to keep up\ntheir companionship as master and pupil; or even, if it should be\nnecessary, he would send her to her brother to nurse him, he would\nlose her forever rather than give her to a husband. And at each of\nthese resolutions he felt his heart, torn asunder, cry out with\nanguish in the imperious need of possessing her entirely. He was no\nlonger satisfied with her presence, he wished to keep her for himself,\nwith himself, as she appeared to him in her radiant beauty, in the\ndarkness of his chamber, with her unbound hair falling around her.",
        "His arms clasped the empty air, and he sprang out of bed, staggering\nlike a drunken man; and it was only in the darkness and silence of the\nworkroom that he awoke from this sudden fit of madness. Where, then,\nwas he going, great God? To knock at the door of this sleeping child?\nto break it in, perhaps, with a blow of his shoulder? The soft, pure\nrespiration, which he fancied he heard like a sacred wind in the midst\nof the profound silence, struck him on the face and turned him back.\nAnd he returned to his room and threw himself on his bed, in a passion\nof shame and wild despair.",
        "On the following day when he arose, Pascal, worn out by want of sleep,\nhad come to a decision. He took his daily shower bath, and he felt\nhimself stronger and saner. The resolution to which he had come was to\ncompel Clotilde to give her word. When she should have formally\npromised to marry Ramond, it seemed to him that this final solution\nwould calm him, would forbid his indulging in any false hopes. This\nwould be a barrier the more, an insurmountable barrier between her and\nhim. He would be from that moment armed against his desire, and if he\nstill suffered, it would be suffering only, without the horrible fear\nof becoming a dishonorable man.",
        "On this morning, when he told the young girl that she ought to delay\nno longer, that she owed a decisive answer to the worthy fellow who\nhad been awaiting it so long, she seemed at first astonished. She\nlooked straight into his eyes, but he had sufficient command over\nhimself not to show confusion; he insisted merely, with a slightly\ngrieved air, as if it distressed him to have to say these things to\nher. Finally, she smiled faintly and turned her head aside, saying:",
        "“Then, master, you wish me to leave you?”",
        "“My dear,” he answered evasively, “I assure you that this is becoming\nridiculous. Ramond will have the right to be angry.”",
        "She went over to her desk, to arrange some papers which were on it.\nThen, after a moment’s silence, she said:",
        "“It is odd; now you are siding with grandmother and Martine. They,\ntoo, are persecuting me to end this matter. I thought I had a few days\nmore. But, in truth, if you all three urge me–”",
        "She did not finish, and he did not press her to explain herself more\nclearly.",
        "“When do you wish me to tell Ramond to come, then?”",
        "“Why, he may come whenever he wishes; it does not displease me to see\nhim. But don’t trouble yourself. I will let him know that we will\nexpect him one of these afternoons.”",
        "On the following day the same scene began over again. Clotilde had\ntaken no step yet, and Pascal was now angry. He suffered martyrdom; he\nhad crises of anguish and rebelliousness when she was not present to\ncalm him by her smiling freshness. And he insisted, in emphatic\nlanguage, that she should behave seriously and not trifle any longer\nwith an honorable man who loved her.",
        "“The devil! Since the thing is decided, let us be done with it. I warn\nyou that I will send word to Ramond, and that he will be here\nto-morrow at three o’clock.”",
        "She listened in silence, her eyes fixed on the ground. Neither seemed\nto wish to touch upon the question as to whether the marriage had\nreally been decided on or not, and they took the standpoint that there\nhad been a previous decision, which was irrevocable. When she looked\nup again he trembled, for he felt a breath pass by; he thought she was\non the point of saying that she had questioned herself, and that she\nrefused this marriage. What would he have done, what would have become\nof him, good God! Already he was filled with an immense joy and a wild\nterror. But she looked at him with the discreet and affectionate smile\nwhich never now left her lips, and she answered with a submissive air:",
        "“As you please, master. Send him word to be here to-morrow at three\no’clock.”",
        "Pascal spent so dreadful a night that he rose late, saying, as an\nexcuse, that he had one of his old headaches. He found relief only\nunder the icy deluge of the shower bath. At ten o’clock he left the\nhouse, saying he would go himself to see Ramond; but he had another\nobject in going out–he had seen at a show in Plassans a corsage of\nold point d’Alencon; a marvel of beauty which lay there awaiting some\nlover’s generous folly, and the thought had come to him in the midst\nof the tortures of the night, to make a present of it to Clotilde, to\nadorn her wedding gown. This bitter idea of himself adorning her, of\nmaking her beautiful and fair for the gift of herself, touched his\nheart, exhausted by sacrifice. She knew the corsage, she had admired\nit with him one day wonderingly, wishing for it only to place it on\nthe shoulders of the Virgin at St. Saturnin, an antique Virgin adored\nby the faithful. The shopkeeper gave it to him in a little box which\nhe could conceal, and which he hid, on his return to the house, in the\nbottom of his writing-desk.",
        "At three o’clock Dr. Ramond presented himself, and he found Pascal and\nClotilde in the parlor, where they had been awaiting him with secret\nexcitement and a somewhat forced gaiety, avoiding any further allusion\nto his visit. They received him smilingly with exaggerated cordiality.",
        "“Why, you are perfectly well again, master!” said the young man. “You\nnever looked so strong.”",
        "Pascal shook his head.",
        "“Oh, oh, strong, perhaps! only the heart is no longer here.”",
        "This involuntary avowal made Clotilde start, and she looked from one\nto the other, as if, by the force of circumstances, she compared them\nwith each other–Ramond, with his smiling and superb face–the face of\nthe handsome physician adored by the women–his luxuriant black hair\nand beard, in all the splendor of his young manhood; and Pascal, with\nhis white hair and his white beard. This fleece of snow, still so\nabundant, retained the tragic beauty of the six months of torture that\nhe had just passed through. His sorrowful face had aged a little, only\nhis eyes remained still youthful; brown eyes, brilliant and limpid.\nBut at this moment all his features expressed so much gentleness, such\nexalted goodness, that Clotilde ended by letting her gaze rest upon\nhim with profound tenderness. There was silence for a moment and each\nheart thrilled.",
        "“Well, my children,” resumed Pascal heroically, “I think you have\nsomething to say to each other. I have something to do, too,\ndownstairs. I will come up again presently.”",
        "And he left the room, smiling back at them.",
        "And soon as they were alone, Clotilde went frankly straight over to\nRamond, with both hands outstretched. Taking his hands in hers, she\nheld them as she spoke.",
        "“Listen, my dear friend; I am going to give you a great grief. You\nmust not be too angry with me, for I assure you that I have a very\nprofound friendship for you.”",
        "He understood at once, and he turned very pale.",
        "“Clotilde give me no answer now, I beg of you; take more time, if you\nwish to reflect further.”",
        "“It is useless, my dear friend, my decision is made.”",
        "She looked at him with her fine, loyal look. She had not released his\nhands, in order that he might know that she was not excited, and that\nshe was his friend. And it was he who resumed, in a low voice:",
        "“Then you say no?”",
        "“I say no, and I assure you that it pains me greatly to say it. Ask me\nnothing; you will no doubt know later on.”",
        "He sat down, crushed by the emotion which he repressed like a strong\nand self-contained man, whose mental balance the greatest sufferings\ncannot disturb. Never before had any grief agitated him like this. He\nremained mute, while she, standing, continued:",
        "“And above all, my friend, do not believe that I have played the\ncoquette with you. If I have allowed you to hope, if I have made you\nwait so long for my answer, it was because I did not in very truth see\nclearly myself. You cannot imagine through what a crisis I have just\npassed–a veritable tempest of emotions, surrounded by darkness from\nout of which I have but just found my way.”",
        "He spoke at last.",
        "“Since it is your wish, I will ask you nothing. Besides, it is\nsufficient for you to answer one question. You do not love me,\nClotilde?”",
        "She did not hesitate, but said gravely, with an emotion which softened\nthe frankness of her answer:",
        "“It is true, I do not love you; I have only a very sincere affection\nfor you.”",
        "He rose, and stopped by a gesture the kind words which she would have\nadded.",
        "“It is ended; let us never speak of it again. I wished you to be\nhappy. Do not grieve for me. At this moment I feel as if the house had\njust fallen about me in ruins. But I must only extricate myself as\nbest I can.”",
        "A wave of color passed over his pale face, he gasped for air, he\ncrossed over to the window, then he walked back with a heavy step,\nseeking to recover his self-possession. He drew a long breath. In the\npainful silence which had fallen they heard Pascal coming upstairs\nnoisily, to announce his return.",
        "“I entreat you,” murmured Clotilde hurriedly, “to say nothing to\nmaster. He does not know my decision, and I wish to break it to him\nmyself, for he was bent upon this marriage.”",
        "Pascal stood still in the doorway. He was trembling and breathless, as\nif he had come upstairs too quickly. He still found strength to smile\nat them, saying:",
        "“Well, children, have you come to an understanding?”",
        "“Yes, undoubtedly,” responded Ramond, as agitated as himself.",
        "“Then it is all settled?”",
        "“Quite,” said Clotilde, who had been seized by a faintness.",
        "Pascal walked over to his work-table, supporting himself by the\nfurniture, and dropped into the chair beside it.",
        "“Ah, ah! you see the legs are not so strong after all. It is this old\ncarcass of a body. But the heart is strong. And I am very happy, my\nchildren, your happiness will make me well again.”",
        "But when Ramond, after a few minutes’ further conversation, had gone\naway, he seemed troubled at finding himself alone with the young girl,\nand he again asked her:",
        "“It is settled, quite settled; you swear it to me?”",
        "“Entirely settled.”",
        "After this he did not speak again. He nodded his head, as if to repeat\nthat he was delighted; that nothing could be better; that at last they\nwere all going to live in peace. He closed his eyes, feigning to drop\nasleep, as he sometimes did in the afternoon. But his heart beat\nviolently, and his closely shut eyelids held back the tears.",
        "That evening, at about ten o’clock, when Clotilde went downstairs for\na moment to give an order to Martine before she should have gone to\nbed, Pascal profited by the opportunity of being left alone, to go and\nlay the little box containing the lace corsage on the young girl’s\nbed. She came upstairs again, wished him the accustomed good-night,\nand he had been for at least twenty minutes in his own room, and was\nalready in his shirt sleeves, when a burst of gaiety sounded outside\nhis door. A little hand tapped, and a fresh voice cried, laughing:",
        "“Come, come and look!”",
        "He opened the door, unable to resist this appeal of youth, conquered\nby his joy.",
        "“Oh, come, come and see what a beautiful little bird has put on my\nbed!”",
        "And she drew him to her room, taking no refusal. She had lighted the\ntwo candles in it, and the antique, pleasant chamber, with its\nhangings of faded rose color, seemed transformed into a chapel; and on\nthe bed, like a sacred cloth offered to the adoration of the faithful,\nshe had spread the corsage of old point d’Alencon.",
        "“You would not believe it! Imagine, I did not see the box at first. I\nset things in order a little, as I do every evening. I undressed, and\nit was only when I was getting into bed that I noticed your present.\nAh, what a surprise! I was overwhelmed by it! I felt that I could\nnever wait for the morning, and I put on a skirt and ran to look for\nyou.”",
        "It was not until then that he perceived that she was only half\ndressed, as on the night of the storm, when he had surprised her\nstealing his papers. And she seemed divine, with her tall, girlish\nform, her tapering limbs, her supple arms, her slender body, with its\nsmall, firm throat.",
        "She took his hands and pressed them caressingly in her little ones.",
        "“How good you are; how I thank you! Such a marvel of beauty, so lovely\na present for me, who am nobody! And you remember that I had admired\nit, this antique relic of art. I said to you that only the Virgin of\nSt. Saturnin was worthy of wearing it on her shoulders. I am so happy!\noh, so happy! For it is true, I love beautiful things; I love them so\npassionately that at times I wish for impossibilities, gowns woven of\nsunbeams, impalpable veils made of the blue of heaven. How beautiful I\nam going to look! how beautiful I am going to look!”",
        "Radiant in her ecstatic gratitude, she drew close to him, still\nlooking at the corsage, and compelling him to admire it with her. Then\na sudden curiosity seized her.",
        "“But why did you make me this royal present?”",
        "Ever since she had come to seek him in her joyful excitement, Pascal\nhad been walking in a dream. He was moved to tears by this\naffectionate gratitude; he stood there, not feeling the terror which\nhe had dreaded, but seeming, on the contrary, to be filled with joy,\nas at the approach of a great and miraculous happiness. This chamber,\nwhich he never entered, had the religious sweetness of holy places\nthat satisfy all longings for the unattainable.",
        "His countenance, however, expressed surprise. And he answered:",
        "“Why, this present, my dear, is for your wedding gown.”",
        "She, in her turn, looked for a moment surprised as if she had not\nunderstood him. Then, with the sweet and singular smile which she had\nworn of late she said gayly:",
        "“Ah, true, my marriage!”",
        "Then she grew serious again, and said:",
        "“Then you want to get rid of me? It was in order to have me here no\nlonger that you were so bent upon marrying me. Do you still think me\nyour enemy, then?”",
        "He felt his tortures return, and he looked away from her, wishing to\nretain his courage.",
        "“My enemy, yes. Are you not so? We have suffered so much through each\nother these last days. It is better in truth that we should separate.\nAnd then I do not know what your thoughts are; you have never given me\nthe answer I have been waiting for.”",
        "She tried in vain to catch his glance, which he still kept turned\naway. She began to talk of the terrible night on which they had gone\ntogether through the papers. It was true, in the shock which her whole\nbeing had suffered, she had not yet told him whether she was with him\nor against him. He had a right to demand an answer.",
        "She again took his hands in hers, and forced him to look at her.",
        "“And it is because I am your enemy that you are sending me away? I am\nnot your enemy. I am your servant, your chattel, your property. Do you\nhear? I am with you and for you, for you alone!”",
        "His face grew radiant; an intense joy shone within his eyes.",
        "“Yes, I will wear this lace. It is for my wedding day, for I wish to\nbe beautiful, very beautiful for you. But do you not understand me,\nthen? You are my master; it is you I love.”",
        "“No, no! be silent; you will make me mad! You are betrothed to\nanother. You have given your word. All this madness is happily\nimpossible.”",
        "“The other! I have compared him with you, and I have chosen you. I\nhave dismissed him. He has gone away, and he will never return. There\nare only we two now, and it is you I love, and you love me. I know it,\nand I give myself to you.”",
        "He trembled violently. He had ceased to struggle, vanquished by the\nlonging of eternal love.",
        "The spacious chamber, with its antique furniture, warmed by youth, was\nas if filled with light. There was no longer either fear or suffering;\nthey were free. She gave herself to him knowingly, willingly, and he\naccepted the supreme gift like a priceless treasure which the strength\nof his love had won. Suddenly she murmured in his ear, in a caressing\nvoice, lingering tenderly on the words:",
        "“Master, oh, master, master!”",
        "And this word, which she used formerly as a matter of habit, at this\nhour acquired a profound significance, lengthening out and prolonging\nitself, as if it expressed the gift of her whole being. She uttered it\nwith grateful fervor, like a woman who accepts, and who surrenders\nherself. Was not the mystic vanquished, the real acknowledged, life\nglorified with love at last confessed and shared.",
        "“Master, master, this comes from far back. I must tell you; I must\nmake my confession. It is true that I went to church in order to be\nhappy. But I could not believe. I wished to understand too much; my\nreason rebelled against their dogmas; their paradise appeared to me an\nincredible puerility. But I believed that the world does not stop at\nsensation; that there is a whole unknown world, which must be taken\ninto account; and this, master, I believe still. It is the idea of the\nBeyond, which not even happiness, found at last upon your neck, will\nefface. But this longing for happiness, this longing to be happy at\nonce, to have some certainty–how I have suffered from it. If I went\nto church, it was because I missed something, and I went there to seek\nit. My anguish consisted in this irresistible need to satisfy my\nlonging. You remember what you used to call my eternal thirst for\nillusion and falsehood. One night, in the threshing yard, under the\ngreat starry sky, do you remember? I burst out against your science, I\nwas indignant because of the ruins with which it strews the earth, I\nturned my eyes away from the dreadful wounds which it exposes. And I\nwished, master, to take you to a solitude where we might both live in\nGod, far from the world, forgotten by it. Ah, what torture, to long,\nto struggle, and not to be satisfied!”",
        "Softly, without speaking, he kissed her on both eyes.",
        "“Then, master, do you remember again, there was the great moral shock\non the night of the storm, when you gave me that terrible lesson of\nlife, emptying out your envelopes before me. You had said to me\nalready: ’Know life, love it, live it as it ought to be lived.’ But\nwhat a vast, what a frightful flood, rolling ever onward toward a\nhuman sea, swelling it unceasingly for the unknown future! And,\nmaster, the silent work within me began then. There was born, in my\nheart and in my flesh, the bitter strength of the real. At first I was\nas if crushed, the blow was so rude. I could not recover myself. I\nkept silent, because I did not know clearly what to say. Then,\ngradually, the evolution was effected. I still had struggles, I still\nrebelled against confessing my defeat. But every day after this the\ntruth grew clearer within me, I knew well that you were my master, and\nthat there was no happiness for me outside of you, of your science and\nyour goodness. You were life itself, broad and tolerant life; saying\nall, accepting all, solely through the love of energy and effort,\nbelieving in the work of the world, placing the meaning of destiny in\nthe labor which we all accomplish with love, in our desperate\neagerness to live, to love, to live anew, to live always, in spite of\nall the abominations and miseries of life. Oh, to live, to live! This\nis the great task, the work that always goes on, and that will\ndoubtless one day be completed!”",
        "Silent still, he smiled radiantly, and kissed her on the mouth.",
        "“And, master, though I have always loved you, even from my earliest\nyouth, it was, I believe, on that terrible night that you marked me\nfor, and made me your own. You remember how you crushed me in your\ngrasp. It left a bruise, and a few drops of blood on my shoulder. Then\nyour being entered, as it were into mine. We struggled; you were the\nstronger, and from that time I have felt the need of a support. At\nfirst I thought myself humiliated; then I saw that it was but an\ninfinitely sweet submission. I always felt your power within me. A\ngesture of your hand in the distance thrilled me as though it had\ntouched me. I would have wished that you had seized me again in your\ngrasp, that you had crushed me in it, until my being had mingled with\nyours forever. And I was not blind; I knew well that your wish was the\nsame as mine, that the violence which had made me yours had made you\nmine; that you struggled with yourself not to seize me and hold me as\nI passed by you. To nurse you when you were ill was some slight\nsatisfaction. From that time, light began to break upon me, and I at\nlast understood. I went no more to church, I began to be happy near\nyou, you had become certainty and happiness. Do you remember that I\ncried to you, in the threshing yard, that something was wanting in our\naffection. There was a void in it which I longed to fill. What could\nbe wanting to us unless it were God? And it was God–love, and life.”",
        "Then came a period of idyllic happiness. Clotilde was the spring, the\ntardy rejuvenation that came to Pascal in his declining years. She\ncame, bringing to him, with her love, sunshine and flowers. Their\nrapture lifted them above the earth; and all this youth she bestowed\non him after his thirty years of toil, when he was already weary and\nworn probing the frightful wounds of humanity. He revived in the light\nof her great shining eyes, in the fragrance of her pure breath. He had\nfaith again in life, in health, in strength, in the eternal renewal of\nnature.",
        "On the morning after her avowal it was ten o’clock before Clotilde\nleft her room. In the middle of the workroom she suddenly came upon\nMartine and, in her radiant happiness, with a burst of joy that\ncarried everything before it, she rushed toward her, crying:",
        "“Martine, I am not going away! Master and I–we love each other.”",
        "The old servant staggered under the blow. Her poor worn face, nunlike\nunder its white cap and with its look of renunciation, grew white in\nthe keenness of her anguish. Without a word, she turned and fled for\nrefuge to her kitchen, where, leaning her elbows on her chopping-\ntable, and burying her face in her clasped hands, she burst into a\npassion of sobs.",
        "Clotilde, grieved and uneasy, followed her. And she tried to\ncomprehend and to console her.",
        "“Come, come, how foolish you are! What possesses you? Master and I\nwill love you all the same; we will always keep you with us. You are\nnot going to be unhappy because we love each other. On the contrary,\nthe house is going to be gay now from morning till night.”",
        "But Martine only sobbed all the more desperately.",
        "“Answer me, at least. Tell me why you are angry and why you cry. Does\nit not please you then to know that master is so happy, so happy! See,\nI will call master and he will make you answer.”",
        "At this threat the old servant suddenly rose and rushed into her own\nroom, which opened out of the kitchen, slamming the door behind her.\nIn vain the young girl called and knocked until she was tired; she\ncould obtain no answer. At last Pascal, attracted by the noise, came\ndownstairs, saying:",
        "“Why, what is the matter?”",
        "“Oh, it is that obstinate Martine! Only fancy, she began to cry when\nshe knew that we loved each other. And she has barricaded herself in\nthere, and she will not stir.”",
        "She did not stir, in fact. Pascal, in his turn, called and knocked. He\nscolded; he entreated. Then, one after the other, they began all over\nagain. Still there was no answer. A deathlike silence reigned in the\nlittle room. And he pictured it to himself, this little room,\nreligiously clean, with its walnut bureau, and its monastic bed\nfurnished with white hangings. No doubt the servant had thrown herself\nacross this bed, in which she had slept alone all her woman’s life,\nand was burying her face in the bolster to stifle her sobs.",
        "“Ah, so much the worse for her?” said Clotilde at last, in the egotism\nof her joy, “let her sulk!”",
        "Then throwing her arms around Pascal, and raising to his her charming\nface, still glowing with the ardor of self-surrender, she said:",
        "“Master, I will be your servant to-day.”",
        "He kissed her on the eyes with grateful emotion; and she at once set\nabout preparing the breakfast, turning the kitchen upside down. She\nhad put on an enormous white apron, and she looked charming, with her\nsleeves rolled up, showing her delicate arms, as if for some great\nundertaking. There chanced to be some cutlets in the kitchen which she\ncooked to a turn. She added some scrambled eggs, and she even\nsucceeded in frying some potatoes. And they had a delicious breakfast,\ntwenty times interrupted by her getting up in her eager zeal, to run\nfor the bread, the water, a forgotten fork. If he had allowed her, she\nwould have waited upon him on her knees. Ah! to be alone, to be only\nthey two in this large friendly house, and to be free to laugh and to\nlove each other in peace.",
        "They spent the whole afternoon in sweeping and putting things in\norder. He insisted upon helping her. It was a play; they amused\nthemselves like two merry children. From time to time, however, they\nwent back to knock at Martine’s door to remonstrate with her. Come,\nthis was foolish, she was not going to let herself starve! Was there\never seen such a mule, when no one had said or done anything to her!\nBut only the echo of their knocks came back mournfully from the silent\nroom. Not the slightest sound, not a breath responded. Night fell, and\nthey were obliged to make the dinner also, which they ate, sitting\nbeside each other, from the same plate. Before going to bed, they made\na last attempt, threatening to break open the door, but their ears,\nglued to the wood, could not catch the slightest sound. And on the\nfollowing day, when they went downstairs and found the door still\nhermetically closed, they began to be seriously uneasy. For twenty-\nfour hours the servant had given no sign of life.",
        "Then, on returning to the kitchen after a moment’s absence, Clotilde\nand Pascal were stupefied to see Martine sitting at her table, picking\nsome sorrel for the breakfast. She had silently resumed her place as\nservant.",
        "“But what was the matter with you?” cried Clotilde. “Will you speak\nnow?”",
        "She lifted up her sad face, stained by tears. It was very calm,\nhowever, and it expressed now only the resigned melancholy of old age.\nShe looked at the young girl with an air of infinite reproach; then\nshe bent her head again without speaking.",
        "“Are you angry with us, then?”",
        "And as she still remained silent, Pascal interposed:",
        "“Are you angry with us, my good Martine?”",
        "Then the old servant looked up at him with her former look of\nadoration, as if she loved him sufficiently to endure all and to\nremain in spite of all. At last she spoke.",
        "“No, I am angry with no one. The master is free. It is all right, if\nhe is satisfied.”",
        "A new life began from this time. Clotilde, who in spite of her twenty-\nfive years had still remained childlike, now, under the influence of\nlove, suddenly bloomed into exquisite womanhood. Since her heart had\nawakened, the serious and intelligent boy that she had looked like,\nwith her round head covered with its short curls, had given place to\nan adorable woman, altogether womanly, submissive and tender, loving\nto be loved. Her great charm, notwithstanding her learning picked up\nat random from her reading and her work, was her virginal naivete,\nas if her unconscious awaiting of love had made her reserve the gift\nof her whole being to be utterly absorbed in the man whom she should\nlove. No doubt she had given her love as much through gratitude and\nadmiration as through tenderness; happy to make him happy;\nexperiencing a profound joy in being no longer only a little girl to\nbe petted, but something of his very own which he adored, a precious\npossession, a thing of grace and joy, which he worshiped on bended\nknees. She still had the religious submissiveness of the former\ndevotee, in the hands of a master mature and strong, from whom she\nderived consolation and support, retaining, above and beyond\naffection, the sacred awe of the believer in the spiritual which she\nstill was. But more than all, this woman, so intoxicated with love,\nwas a delightful personification of health and gaiety; eating with a\nhearty appetite; having something of the valor of her grandfather the\nsoldier; filling the house with her swift and graceful movements, with\nthe bloom of her satin skin, the slender grace of her neck, of all her\nyoung form, divinely fresh.",
        "And Pascal, too, had grown handsome again under the influence of love,\nwith the serene beauty of a man who had retained his vigor,\nnotwithstanding his white hairs. His countenance had no longer the\nsorrowful expression which it had worn during the months of grief and\nsuffering through which he had lately passed; his eyes, youthful\nstill, had recovered their brightness, his features their smiling\ngrace; while his white hair and beard grew thicker, in a leonine\nabundance which lent him a youthful air. He had kept himself, in his\nsolitary life as a passionate worker, so free from vice and\ndissipation that he found now within him a reserve of life and vigor\neager to expend itself at last. There awoke within him new energy, a\nyouthful impetuosity that broke forth in gestures and exclamations, in\na continual need of expansion, of living. Everything wore a new and\nenchanting aspect to him; the smallest glimpse of sky moved him to\nwonder; the perfume of a simple flower threw him into an ecstasy; an\neveryday expression of affection, worn by use, touched him to tears,\nas if it had sprung fresh from the heart and had not been hackneyed by\nmillions of lips. Clotilde’s “I love you,” was an infinite caress,\nwhose celestial sweetness no human being had ever before known. And\nwith health and beauty he recovered also his gaiety, that tranquil\ngaiety which had formerly been inspired by his love of life, and which\nnow threw sunshine over his love, over everything that made life worth\nliving.",
        "They two, blooming youth and vigorous maturity, so healthy, so gay, so\nhappy, made a radiant couple. For a whole month they remained in\nseclusion, not once leaving La Souleiade. The place where both now\nliked to be was the spacious workroom, so intimately associated with\ntheir habits and their past affection. They would spend whole days\nthere, scarcely working at all, however. The large carved oak press\nremained with closed doors; so, too, did the bookcases. Books and\npapers lay undisturbed upon the tables. Like a young married couple\nthey were absorbed in their one passion, oblivious of their former\noccupations, oblivious of life. The hours seemed all too short to\nenjoy the charm of being together, often seated in the same large\nantique easy-chair, happy in the depths of this solitude in which they\nsecluded themselves, in the tranquillity of this lofty room, in this\ndomain which was altogether theirs, without luxury and without order,\nfull of familiar objects, brightened from morning till night by the\nreturning gaiety of the April sunshine. When, seized with remorse, he\nwould talk about working, she would link her supple arms through his\nand laughingly hold him prisoner, so that he should not make himself\nill again with overwork. And downstairs, they loved, too, the\ndining-room, so gay with its light panels relieved by blue bands, its\nantique mahogany furniture, its large flower pastels, its brass\nhanging lamp, always shining. They ate in it with a hearty appetite\nand they left it, after each meal, only to go upstairs again to their\ndear solitude.",
        "Then when the house seemed too small, they had the garden, all La\nSouleiade. Spring advanced with the advancing sun, and at the end of\nApril the roses were beginning to bloom. And what a joy was this\ndomain, walled around, where nothing from the outside world could\ntrouble them! Hours flew by unnoted, as they sat on the terrace facing\nthe vast horizon and the shady banks of the Viorne, and the slopes of\nSainte-Marthe, from the rocky bars of the Seille to the valley of\nPlassans in the dusty distance. There was no shade on the terrace but\nthat of the two secular cypresses planted at its two extremities, like\ntwo enormous green tapers, which could be seen three leagues away. At\ntimes they descended the slope for the pleasure of ascending the giant\nsteps, and climbing the low walls of uncemented stones which supported\nthe plantations, to see if the stunted olive trees and the puny\nalmonds were budding. More often there were delightful walks under the\ndelicate needles of the pine wood, steeped in sunshine and exhaling a\nstrong odor of resin; endless walks along the wall of inclosure, from\nbehind which the only sound they could hear was, at rare intervals,\nthe grating noise of some cart jolting along the narrow road to Les\nFenouilleres; and they spent delightful hours in the old threshing\nyard, where they could see the whole horizon, and where they loved to\nstretch themselves, tenderly remembering their former tears, when,\nloving each other unconsciously to themselves, they had quarreled\nunder the stars. But their favorite retreat, where they always ended\nby losing themselves, was the quincunx of tall plane trees, whose\nbranches, now of a tender green, looked like lacework. Below, the\nenormous box trees, the old borders of the French garden, of which now\nscarcely a trace remained, formed a sort of labyrinth of which they\ncould never find the end. And the slender stream of the fountain, with\nits eternal crystalline murmur, seemed to sing within their hearts.\nThey would sit hand in hand beside the mossy basin, while the twilight\nfell around them, their forms gradually fading into the shadow of the\ntrees, while the water which they could no longer see, sang its\nflutelike song.",
        "Up to the middle of May Pascal and Clotilde secluded themselves in\nthis way, without even crossing the threshold of their retreat. One\nmorning he disappeared and returned an hour later, bringing her a pair\nof diamond earrings which he had hurried out to buy, remembering this\nwas her birthday. She adored jewels, and the gift astonished and\ndelighted her. From this time not a week passed in which he did not go\nout once or twice in this way to bring her back some present. The\nslightest excuse was sufficient for him–a fete, a wish, a simple\npleasure. He brought her rings, bracelets, a necklace, a slender\ndiadem. He would take out the other jewels and please himself by\nputting them all upon her in the midst of their laughter. She was like\nan idol, seated on her chair, covered with gold,–a band of gold on\nher hair, gold on her bare arms and on her bare throat, all shining\nwith gold and precious stones. Her woman’s vanity was delightfully\ngratified by this. She allowed herself to be adored thus, to be adored\non bended knees, like a divinity, knowing well that this was only an\nexalted form of love. She began at last to scold a little, however; to\nmake prudent remonstrances; for, in truth, it was an absurdity to\nbring her all these gifts which she must afterward shut up in a\ndrawer, without ever wearing them, as she went nowhere.",
        "They were forgotten after the hour of joy and gratitude which they\ngave her in their novelty was over. But he would not listen to her,\ncarried away by a veritable mania for giving; unable, from the moment\nthe idea of giving her an article took possession of him, to resist\nthe desire of buying it. It was a munificence of the heart; an\nimperious desire to prove to her that he thought of her always; a\npride in seeing her the most magnificent, the happiest, the most\nenvied of women; a generosity more profound even, which impelled him\nto despoil himself of everything, of his money, of his life. And then,\nwhat a delight, when he saw he had given her a real pleasure, and she\nthrew herself on his neck, blushing, thanking him with kisses. After\nthe jewels, it was gowns, articles of dress, toilet articles. Her room\nwas littered, the drawers were filled to overflowing.",
        "One morning she could not help getting angry. He had brought her\nanother ring.",
        "“Why, I never wear them! And if I did, my fingers would be covered to\nthe tips. Be reasonable, I beg of you.”",
        "“Then I have not given you pleasure?” he said with confusion.",
        "She threw her arms about his neck, and assured him with tears in her\neyes that she was very happy. He was so good to her! He was so\nunwearied in his devotion to her! And when, later in the morning, he\nventured to speak of making some changes in her room, of covering the\nwalls with tapestry, of putting down a carpet, she again remonstrated.",
        "“Oh! no, no! I beg of you. Do not touch my old room, so full of\nmemories, where I have grown up, where I told you I loved you. I\nshould no longer feel myself at home in it.”",
        "Downstairs, Martine’s obstinate silence condemned still more strongly\nthese excessive and useless expenses. She had adopted a less familiar\nattitude, as if, in the new situation, she had fallen from her role of\nhousekeeper and friend to her former station of servant. Toward\nClotilde, especially, she changed, treating her like a young lady,\nlike a mistress to whom she was less affectionate but more obedient\nthan formerly. Two or three times, however, she had appeared in the\nmorning with her face discolored and her eyes sunken with weeping,\nanswering evasively when questioned, saying that nothing was the\nmatter, that she had taken cold. And she never made any remark about\nthe gifts with which the drawers were filled. She did not even seem to\nsee them, arranging them without a word either of praise or dispraise.\nBut her whole nature rebelled against this extravagant generosity, of\nwhich she could never have conceived the possibility. She protested in\nher own fashion; exaggerating her economy and reducing still further\nthe expenses of the housekeeping, which she now conducted on so narrow\na scale that she retrenched even in the smallest expenses. For\ninstance, she took only two-thirds of the milk which she had been in\nthe habit of taking, and she served sweet dishes only on Sundays.\nPascal and Clotilde, without venturing to complain, laughed between\nthemselves at this parsimony, repeating the jests which had amused\nthem for ten years past, saying that after dressing the vegetables she\nstrained them in the colander, in order to save the butter for future\nuse.",
        "But this quarter she insisted upon rendering an account. She was in\nthe habit of going every three months to Master Grandguillot, the\nnotary, to receive the fifteen hundred francs income, of which she\ndisposed afterward according to her judgment, entering the expenses in\na book which the doctor had years ago ceased to verify. She brought it\nto him now and insisted upon his looking over it. He excused himself,\nsaying that it was all right.",
        "“The thing is, monsieur,” she said, “that this time I have been able\nto put some money aside. Yes, three hundred francs. Here they are.”",
        "He looked at her in amazement. Generally she just made both ends meet.\nBy what miracle of stinginess had she been able to save such a sum?",
        "“Ah! my poor Martine,” he said at last, laughing, “that is the reason,\nthen, that we have been eating so many potatoes of late. You are a\npearl of economy, but indeed you must treat us a little better in the\nfuture.”",
        "This discreet reproach wounded her so profoundly that she allowed\nherself at last to say:",
        "“Well, monsieur, when there is so much extravagance on the one hand,\nit is well to be prudent on the other.”",
        "He understood the allusion, but instead of being angry, he was amused\nby the lesson.",
        "“Ah, ah! it is you who are examining my accounts! But you know very\nwell, Martine, that I, too, have my savings laid by.”",
        "He alluded to the money which he still received occasionally from his\npatients, and which he threw into a drawer of his writing-desk. For\nmore than sixteen years past he had put into this drawer every year\nabout four thousand francs, which would have amounted to a little\nfortune if he had not taken from it, from day to day, without counting\nthem, considerable sums for his experiments and his whims. All the\nmoney for the presents came out of this drawer, which he now opened\ncontinually. He thought that it would never be empty; he had been so\naccustomed to take from it whatever he required that it had never\noccurred to him to fear that he would ever come to the bottom of it.",
        "“One may very well have a little enjoyment out of one’s savings,” he\nsaid gayly. “Since it is you who go to the notary’s, Martine, you are\nnot ignorant that I have my income apart.”",
        "Then she said, with the colorless voice of the miser who is haunted by\nthe dread of an impending disaster:",
        "“And what would you do if you hadn’t it?”",
        "Pascal looked at her in astonishment, and contented himself with\nanswering with a shrug, for the possibility of such a misfortune had\nnever even entered his mind. He fancied that avarice was turning her\nbrain, and he laughed over the incident that evening with Clotilde.",
        "In Plassans, too, the presents were the cause of endless gossip. The\nrumor of what was going on at La Souleiade, this strange and sudden\npassion, had spread, no one could tell how, by that force of expansion\nwhich sustains curiosity, always on the alert in small towns. The\nservant certainly had not spoken, but her air was perhaps sufficient;\nwords perhaps had dropped from her involuntarily; the lovers might\nhave been watched over the walls. And then came the buying of the\npresents, confirming the reports and exaggerating them. When the\ndoctor, in the early morning, scoured the streets and visited the\njeweler’s and the dressmaker’s, eyes spied him from the windows, his\nsmallest purchases were watched, all the town knew in the evening that\nhe had given her a silk bonnet, a bracelet set with sapphires. And all\nthis was turned into a scandal. This uncle in love with his niece,\ncommitting a young man’s follies for her, adorning her like a holy\nVirgin. The most extraordinary stories began to circulate, and people\npointed to La Souleiade as they passed by.",
        "But old Mme. Rougon was, of all persons, the most bitterly indignant.\nShe had ceased going to her son’s house when she learned that\nClotilde’s marriage with Dr. Ramond had been broken off. They had made\nsport of her. They did nothing to please her, and she wished to show\nhow deep her displeasure was. Then a full month after the rupture,\nduring which she had understood nothing of the pitying looks, the\ndiscreet condolences, the vague smiles which met her everywhere, she\nlearned everything with a suddenness that stunned her. She, who, at\nthe time of Pascal’s illness, in her mortification at the idea of\nagain becoming the talk of the town through that ugly story, had\nraised such a storm! It was far worse this time; the height of\nscandal, a love affair for people to regale themselves with. The\nRougon legend was again in peril; her unhappy son was decidedly doing\nhis best to find some way to destroy the family glory won with so much\ndifficulty. So that in her anger she, who had made herself the\nguardian of this glory, resolving to purify the legend by every means\nin her power, put on her hat one morning and hurried to La Souleiade\nwith the youthful vivacity of her eighty years.",
        "Pascal, whom the rupture with his mother enchanted, was fortunately\nnot at home, having gone out an hour before to look for a silver\nbuckle which he had thought of for a belt. And Felicite fell upon\nClotilde as the latter was finishing her toilet, her arms bare, her\nhair loose, looking as fresh and smiling as a rose.",
        "The first shock was rude. The old lady unburdened her mind, grew\nindignant, spoke of the scandal they were giving. Suddenly her anger\nvanished. She looked at the young girl, and she thought her adorable.\nIn her heart she was not surprised at what was going on. She laughed\nat it, all she desired was that it should end in a correct fashion, so\nas to silence evil tongues. And she cried with a conciliating air:",
        "“Get married then! Why do you not get married?”",
        "Clotilde remained silent for a moment, surprised. She had not thought\nof marriage. Then she smiled again.",
        "“No doubt we will get married, grandmother. But later on, there is no\nhurry.”",
        "Old Mme. Rougon went away, obliged to be satisfied with this vague\npromise.",
        "It was at this time that Pascal and Clotilde ceased to seclude\nthemselves. Not through any spirit of bravado, not because they wished\nto answer ugly rumors by making a display of their happiness, but as a\nnatural amplification of their joy; their love had slowly acquired the\nneed of expansion and of space, at first beyond the house, then beyond\nthe garden, into the town, as far as the whole vast horizon. It filled\neverything; it took in the whole world.",
        "The doctor then tranquilly resumed his visits, and he took the young\ngirl with him. They walked together along the promenades, along the\nstreets, she on his arm, in a light gown, with flowers in her hat, he\nbuttoned up in his coat with his broad-brimmed hat. He was all white;\nshe all blond. They walked with their heads high, erect and smiling,\nradiating such happiness that they seemed to walk in a halo. At first\nthe excitement was extraordinary. The shopkeepers came and stood at\ntheir doors, the women leaned out of the windows, the passers-by\nstopped to look after them. People whispered and laughed and pointed\nto them. Then they were so handsome; he superb and triumphant, she so\nyouthful, so submissive, and so proud, that an involuntary indulgence\ngradually gained on every one. People could not help defending them\nand loving them, and they ended by smiling on them in a delightful\ncontagion of tenderness. A charm emanated from them which brought back\nall hearts to them. The new town, with its bourgeois population of\nfunctionaries and townspeople who had grown wealthy, was the last\nconquest. But the Quartier St. Marc, in spite of its austerity, showed\nitself at once kind and discreetly tolerant when they walked along its\ndeserted grass-worn sidewalks, beside the antique houses, now closed\nand silent, which exhaled the evaporated perfume of the loves of other\ndays. But it was the old quarter, more especially, that promptly\nreceived them with cordiality, this quarter of which the common\npeople, instinctively touched, felt the grace of the legend, the\nprofound myth of the couple, the beautiful young girl supporting the\nroyal and rejuvenated master. The doctor was adored here for his\ngoodness, and his companion quickly became popular, and was greeted\nwith tokens of admiration and approval as soon as she appeared. They,\nmeantime, if they had seemed ignorant of the former hostility, now\ndivined easily the forgiveness and the indulgent tenderness which\nsurrounded them, and this made them more beautiful; their happiness\ncharmed the entire town.",
        "One afternoon, as Pascal and Clotilde turned the corner of the Rue de\nla Banne, they perceived Dr. Ramond on the opposite side of the\nstreet. It had chanced that they had learned the day before that he\nhad asked and had obtained the hand of Mlle. Leveque, the advocate’s\ndaughter. It was certainly the most sensible course he could have\ntaken, for his business interests made it advisable that he should\nmarry, and the young girl, who was very pretty and very rich, loved\nhim. He, too, would certainly love her in time. Therefore Clotilde\njoyfully smiled her congratulations to him as a sincere friend. Pascal\nsaluted him with an affectionate gesture. For a moment Ramond, a\nlittle moved by the meeting, stood perplexed. His first impulse seemed\nto have been to cross over to them. But a feeling of delicacy must\nhave prevented him, the thought that it would be brutal to interrupt\ntheir dream, to break in upon this solitude a deux, in which they\nmoved, even amid the elbowings of the street. And he contented himself\nwith a friendly salutation, a smile in which he forgave them their\nhappiness. This was very pleasant for all three.",
        "At this time Clotilde amused herself for several days by painting a\nlarge pastel representing the tender scene of old King David and\nAbishag, the young Shunammite. It was a dream picture, one of those\nfantastic compositions into which her other self, her romantic self,\nput her love of the mysterious. Against a background of flowers thrown\non the canvas, flowers that looked like a shower of stars, of barbaric\nrichness, the old king stood facing the spectator, his hand resting on\nthe bare shoulder of Abishag. He was attired sumptuously in a robe\nheavy with precious stones, that fell in straight folds, and he wore\nthe royal fillet on his snowy locks. But she was more sumptuous still,\nwith only the lilylike satin of her skin, her tall, slender figure,\nher round, slender throat, her supple arms, divinely graceful. He\nreigned over, he leaned, as a powerful and beloved master, on this\nsubject, chosen from among all others, so proud of having been chosen,\nso rejoiced to give to her king the rejuvenating gift of her youth.\nAll her pure and triumphant beauty expressed the serenity of her\nsubmission, the tranquillity with which she gave herself, before the\nassembled people, in the full light of day. And he was very great and\nshe was very fair, and there radiated from both a starry radiance.",
        "Up to the last moment Clotilde had left the faces of the two figures\nvaguely outlined in a sort of mist. Pascal, standing behind her,\njested with her to hide his emotion, for he fancied he divined her\nintention. And it was as he thought; she finished the faces with a few\nstrokes of the crayon–old King David was he, and she was Abishag, the\nShunammite. But they were enveloped in a dreamlike brightness, it was\nthemselves deified; the one with hair all white, the other with hair\nall blond, covering them like an imperial mantle, with features\nlengthened by ecstasy, exalted to the bliss of angels, with the glance\nand the smile of immortal youth.",
        "“Ah, dear!” he cried, “you have made us too beautiful; you have\nwandered off again to dreamland–yes, as in the days, do you remember,\nwhen I used to scold you for putting there all the fantastic flowers\nof the Unknown?”",
        "And he pointed to the walls, on which bloomed the fantastic parterreof the old pastels, flowers not of the earth, grown in the soil of\nparadise.",
        "But she protested gayly.",
        "“Too beautiful? We could not be too beautiful! I assure you it is thus\nthat I picture us to myself, thus that I see us; and thus it is that\nwe are. There! see if it is not the pure reality.”",
        "She took the old fifteenth century Bible which was beside her, and\nshowed him the simple wood engraving.",
        "“You see it is exactly the same.”",
        "He smiled gently at this tranquil and extraordinary affirmation.",
        "“Oh, you laugh, you look only at the details of the picture. It is the\nspirit which it is necessary to penetrate. And look at the other\nengravings, it is the same theme in all–Abraham and Hagar, Ruth and\nBoaz. And you see they are all handsome and happy.”",
        "Then they ceased to laugh, leaning over the old Bible whose pages she\nturned with her white fingers, he standing behind her, his white beard\nmingling with her blond, youthful tresses.",
        "Suddenly he whispered to her softly:",
        "“But you, so young, do you never regret that you have chosen me–me,\nwho am so old, as old as the world?”",
        "She gave a start of surprise, and turning round looked at him.",
        "“You old! No, you are young, younger than I!”",
        "And she laughed so joyously that he, too, could not help smiling. But\nhe insisted a little tremulously:",
        "“You do not answer me. Do you not sometimes desire a younger lover,\nyou who are so youthful?”",
        "She put up her lips and kissed him, saying in a low voice:",
        "“I have but one desire, to be loved–loved as you love me, above and\nbeyond everything.”",
        "The day on which Martine saw the pastel nailed to the wall, she looked\nat it a moment in silence, then she made the sign of the cross, but\nwhether it was because she had seen God or the devil, no one could\nsay. A few days before Easter she had asked Clotilde if she would not\naccompany her to church, and the latter having made a sign in the\nnegative, she departed for an instant from the deferential silence\nwhich she now habitually maintained. Of all the new things which\nastonished her in the house, what most astonished her was the sudden\nirreligiousness of her young mistress. So she allowed herself to\nresume her former tone of remonstrance, and to scold her as she used\nto do when she was a little girl and refused to say her prayers. “Had\nshe no longer the fear of the Lord before her, then? Did she no longer\ntremble at the idea of going to hell, to burn there forever?”",
        "Clotilde could not suppress a smile.",
        "“Oh, hell! you know that it has never troubled me a great deal. But\nyou are mistaken if you think I am no longer religious. If I have left\noff going to church it is because I perform my devotions elsewhere,\nthat is all.”",
        "Martine looked at her, open-mouthed, not comprehending her. It was all\nover; mademoiselle was indeed lost. And she never again asked her to\naccompany her to St. Saturnin. But her own devotion increased until it\nat last became a mania. She was no longer to be met, as before, with\nthe eternal stocking in her hand which she knitted even when walking,\nwhen not occupied in her household duties. Whenever she had a moment\nto spare, she ran to church and remained there, repeating endless\nprayers. One day when old Mme. Rougon, always on the alert, found her\nbehind a pillar, an hour after she had seen her there before, Martine\nexcused herself, blushing like a servant who had been caught idling,\nsaying:",
        "“I was praying for monsieur.”",
        "Meanwhile Pascal and Clotilde enlarged still more their domain, taking\nlonger and longer walks every day, extending them now outside the town\ninto the open country. One afternoon, as they were going to La\nSeguiranne, they were deeply moved, passing by the melancholy fields\nwhere the enchanted gardens of Le Paradou had formerly extended. The\nvision of Albine rose before them. Pascal saw her again blooming like\nthe spring, in the rejuvenation which this living flower had brought\nhim too, feeling the pressure of this pure arm against his heart.\nNever could he have believed, he who had already thought himself very\nold when he used to enter this garden to give a smile to the little\nfairy within, that she would have been dead for years when life, the\ngood mother, should bestow upon him the gift of so fresh a spring,\nsweetening his declining years. And Clotilde, having felt the vision\nrise before them, lifted up her face to his in a renewed longing for\ntenderness. She was Albine, the eternal lover. He kissed her on the\nlips, and though no word had been uttered, the level fields sown with\ncorn and oats, where Le Paradou had once rolled its billows of\nluxuriant verdure, thrilled in sympathy.",
        "Pascal and Clotilde were now walking along the dusty road, through the\nbare and arid country. They loved this sun-scorched land, these fields\nthinly planted with puny almond trees and dwarf olives, these\nstretches of bare hills dotted with country houses, that showed on\nthem like pale patches accentuated by the dark bars of the secular\ncypresses. It was like an antique landscape, one of those classic\nlandscapes represented in the paintings of the old schools, with harsh\ncoloring and well balanced and majestic lines. All the ardent sunshine\nof successive summers that had parched this land flowed through their\nveins, and lent them a new beauty and animation, as they walked under\nthe sky forever blue, glowing with the clear flame of eternal love.\nShe, protected from the sun by her straw hat, bloomed and luxuriated\nin this bath of light like a tropical flower, while he, in his renewed\nyouth, felt the burning sap of the soil ascend into his veins in a\nflood of virile joy.",
        "This walk to La Seguiranne had been an idea of the doctor’s, who had\nlearned through Aunt Dieudonne of the approaching marriage of Sophie\nto a young miller of the neighborhood; and he desired to see if every\none was well and happy in this retired corner. All at once they were\nrefreshed by a delightful coolness as they entered the avenue of tall\ngreen oaks. On either side the springs, the mothers of these giant\nshade trees, flowed on in their eternal course. And when they reached\nthe house of the shrew they came, as chance would have it, upon the\ntwo lovers, Sophie and her miller, kissing each other beside the well;\nfor the girl’s aunt had just gone down to the lavatory behind the\nwillows of the Viorne. Confused, the couple stood in blushing silence.\nBut the doctor and his companion laughed indulgently, and the lovers,\nreassured, told them that the marriage was set for St. John’s Day,\nwhich was a long way off, to be sure, but which would come all the\nsame. Sophie, saved from the hereditary malady, had improved in health\nand beauty, and was growing as strong as one of the trees that stood\nwith their feet in the moist grass beside the springs, and their heads\nbare to the sunshine. Ah, the vast, glowing sky, what life it breathed\ninto all created things! She had but one grief, and tears came to her\neyes when she spoke of her brother Valentin, who perhaps would not\nlive through the week. She had had news of him the day before; he was\npast hope. And the doctor was obliged to prevaricate a little to\nconsole her, for he himself expected hourly the inevitable\ntermination. When he and his companion left La Seguiranne they\nreturned slowly to Plassans, touched by this happy, healthy love\nsaddened by the chill of death.",
        "In the old quarter a woman whom Pascal was attending informed him that\nValentin had just died. Two of the neighbors were obliged to take away\nLa Guiraude, who, half-crazed, clung, shrieking, to her son’s body.\nThe doctor entered the house, leaving Clotilde outside. At last, they\nagain took their way to La Souleiade in silence. Since Pascal had\nresumed his visits he seemed to make them only through professional\nduty; he no longer became enthusiastic about the miracles wrought by\nhis treatment. But as far as Valentin’s death was concerned, he was\nsurprised that it had not occurred before; he was convinced that he\nhad prolonged the patient’s life for at least a year. In spite of the\nextraordinary results which he had obtained at first, he knew well\nthat death was the inevitable end. That he had held it in check for\nmonths ought then to have consoled him and soothed his remorse, still\nunassuaged, for having involuntarily caused the death of Lafouasse, a\nfew weeks sooner than it would otherwise have occurred. But this did\nnot seem to be the case, and his brow was knitted in a frown as they\nreturned to their beloved solitude. But there a new emotion awaited\nhim; sitting under the plane trees, whither Martine had sent him, he\nsaw Sarteur, the hatter, the inmate of the Tulettes whom he had been\nso long treating by his hypodermic injections, and the experiment so\nzealously continued seemed to have succeeded. The injections of nerve\nsubstance had evidently given strength to his will, since the madman\nwas here, having left the asylum that morning, declaring that he no\nlonger had any attacks, that he was entirely cured of the homicidal\nmania that impelled him to throw himself upon any passer-by to\nstrangle him. The doctor looked at him as he spoke. He was a small\ndark man, with a retreating forehead and aquiline features, with one\ncheek perceptibly larger than the other. He was perfectly quiet and\nrational, and filled with so lively a gratitude that he kissed his\nsaviour’s hands. The doctor could not help being greatly affected by\nall this, and he dismissed the man kindly, advising him to return to\nhis life of labor, which was the best hygiene, physical and moral.\nThen he recovered his calmness and sat down to table, talking gaily of\nother matters.",
        "Clotilde looked at him with astonishment and even with a little\nindignation.",
        "“What is the matter, master?” she said. “You are no longer satisfied\nwith yourself.”",
        "“Oh, with myself I am never satisfied!” he answered jestingly. “And\nwith medicine, you know–it is according to the day.”",
        "It was on this night that they had their first quarrel. She was angry\nwith him because he no longer had any pride in his profession. She\nreturned to her complaint of the afternoon, reproaching him for not\ntaking more credit to himself for the cure of Sarteur, and even for\nthe prolongation of Valentin’s life. It was she who now had a passion\nfor his fame. She reminded him of his cures; had he not cured himself?\nCould he deny the efficacy of his treatment? A thrill ran through him\nas he recalled the great dream which he had once cherished–to combat\ndebility, the sole cause of disease; to cure suffering humanity; to\nmake a higher, and healthy humanity; to hasten the coming of\nhappiness, the future kingdom of perfection and felicity, by\nintervening and giving health to all! And he possessed the liquor of\nlife, the universal panacea which opened up this immense hope!",
        "Pascal was silent for a moment. Then he murmured:",
        "“It is true. I cured myself, I have cured others, and I still think\nthat my injections are efficacious in many cases. I do not deny\nmedicine. Remorse for a deplorable accident, like that of Lafouasse,\ndoes not render me unjust. Besides, work has been my passion, it is in\nwork that I have up to this time spent my energies; it was in wishing\nto prove to myself the possibility of making decrepit humanity one day\nstrong and intelligent that I came near dying lately. Yes, a dream, a\nbeautiful dream!”",
        "“No, no! a reality, the reality of your genius, master.”",
        "Then, lowering his voice almost to a whisper, he breathed this\nconfession:",
        "“Listen, I am going to say to you what I would say to no one else in\nthe world, what I would not say to myself aloud. To correct nature, to\ninterfere, in order to modify it and thwart it in its purpose, is this\na laudable task? To cure the individual, to retard his death, for his\npersonal pleasure, to prolong his existence, doubtless to the injury\nof the species, is not this to defeat the aims of nature? And have we\nthe right to desire a stronger, a healthier humanity, modeled after\nour idea of health and strength? What have we to do in the matter? Why\nshould we interfere in this work of life, neither the means nor the\nend of which are known to us? Perhaps everything is as it ought to be.\nPerhaps we should risk killing love, genius, life itself. Remember, I\nmake the confession to you alone; but doubt has taken possession of\nme, I tremble at the thought of my twentieth century alchemy. I have\ncome to believe that it is greater and wiser to allow evolution to\ntake its course.”",
        "He paused; then he added so softly that she could scarcely hear him:",
        "“Do you know that instead of nerve-substance I often use only water\nwith my patients. You no longer hear me grinding for days at a time. I\ntold you that I had some of the liquor in reserve. Water soothes them,\nthis is no doubt simply a mechanical effect. Ah! to soothe, to prevent\nsuffering–that indeed I still desire! It is perhaps my greatest\nweakness, but I cannot bear to see any one suffer. Suffering puts me\nbeside myself, it seems a monstrous and useless cruelty of nature. I\npractise now only to prevent suffering.”",
        "“Then, master,” she asked, in the same indistinct murmur, “if you no\nlonger desire to cure, do you still think everything must be told? For\nthe frightful necessity of displaying the wounds of humanity had no\nother excuse than the hope of curing them.”",
        "“Yes, yes, it is necessary to know, in every case, and to conceal\nnothing; to tell everything regarding things and individuals.\nHappiness is no longer possible in ignorance; certainty alone makes\nlife tranquil. When people know more they will doubtless accept\neverything. Do you not comprehend that to desire to cure everything,\nto regenerate everything is a false ambition inspired by our egotism,\na revolt against life, which we declare to be bad, because we judge it\nfrom the point of view of self-interest? I know that I am more\ntranquil, that my intellect has broadened and deepened ever since I\nhave held evolution in respect. It is my love of life which triumphs,\neven to the extent of not questioning its purpose, to the extent of\nconfiding absolutely in it, of losing myself in it, without wishing to\nremake it according to my own conception of good and evil. Life alone\nis sovereign, life alone knows its aim and its end. I can only try to\nknow it in order to live it as it should be lived. And this I have\nunderstood only since I have possessed your love. Before I possessed\nit I sought the truth elsewhere, I struggled with the fixed idea of\nsaving the world. You have come, and life is full; the world is saved\nevery hour by love, by the immense and incessant labor of all that\nlive and love throughout space. Impeccable life, omnipotent life,\nimmortal life!”",
        "They continued to talk together in low tones for some time longer,\nplanning an idyllic life, a calm and healthful existence in the\ncountry. It was in this simple prescription of an invigorating\nenvironment that the experiments of the physician ended. He exclaimed\nagainst cities. People could be well and happy only in the country, in\nthe sunshine, on the condition of renouncing money, ambition, even the\nproud excesses of intellectual labor. They should do nothing but live\nand love, cultivate the soil, and bring up their children.",
        "Dr. Pascal then resumed his professional visits in the town and the\nsurrounding country. And he was generally accompanied by Clotilde, who\nwent with him into the houses of the poor, where she, too, brought\nhealth and cheerfulness.",
        "But, as he had one night confessed to her in secret, his visits were\nnow only visits of relief and consolation. If he had before practised\nwith repugnance it was because he had felt how vain was medical\nscience. Empiricism disheartened him. From the moment that medicine\nceased to be an experimental science and became an art, he was filled\nwith disquiet at the thought of the infinite variety of diseases and\nof their remedies, according to the constitution of the patient.\nTreatment changed with every new hypothesis; how many people, then,\nmust the methods now abandoned have killed! The perspicacity of the\nphysician became everything, the healer was only a happily endowed\ndiviner, himself groping in the dark and effecting cures through his\nfortunate endowment. And this explained why he had given up his\npatients almost altogether, after a dozen years of practise, to devote\nhimself entirely to study. Then, when his great labors on heredity had\nrestored to him for a time the hope of intervening and curing disease\nby his hypodermic injections, he had become again enthusiastic, until\nthe day when his faith in life, after having impelled him, to aid its\naction in this way, by restoring the vital forces, became still\nbroader and gave him the higher conviction that life was\nself-sufficing, that it was the only giver of health and strength, in\nspite of everything. And he continued to visit, with his tranquil smile,\nonly those of his patients who clamored for him loudly, and who found\nthemselves miraculously relieved when he injected into them only pure\nwater.",
        "Clotilde now sometimes allowed herself to jest about these hypodermic\ninjections. She was still at heart, however, a fervent worshiper of\nhis skill; and she said jestingly that if he performed miracles as he\ndid it was because he had in himself the godlike power to do so. Then\nhe would reply jestingly, attributing to her the efficacy of their\ncommon visits, saying that he cured no one now when she was absent,\nthat it was she who brought the breath of life, the unknown and\nnecessary force from the Beyond. So that the rich people, the\nbourgeois, whose houses she did not enter, continued to groan\nwithout his being able to relieve them. And this affectionate dispute\ndiverted them; they set out each time as if for new discoveries, they\nexchanged glances of kindly intelligence with the sick. Ah, this\nwretched suffering which revolted them, and which was now all they\nwent to combat; how happy they were when they thought it vanquished!\nThey were divinely recompensed when they saw the cold sweats\ndisappear, the moaning lips become stilled, the deathlike faces\nrecover animation. It was assuredly the love which they brought to\nthis humble, suffering humanity that produced the alleviation.",
        "“To die is nothing; that is in the natural order of things,” Pascal\nwould often say. “But why suffer? It is cruel and unnecessary!”",
        "One afternoon the doctor was going with the young girl to the little\nvillage of Sainte-Marthe to see a patient, and at the station, for\nthey were going by train, so as to spare Bonhomme, they had a\nreencounter. The train which they were waiting for was from the\nTulettes. Sainte-Marthe was the first station in the opposite\ndirection, going to Marseilles. When the train arrived, they hurried\non board and, opening the door of a compartment which they thought\nempty, they saw old Mme. Rougon about to leave it. She did not speak\nto them, but passing them by, sprang down quickly in spite of her age,\nand walked away with a stiff and haughty air.",
        "“It is the 1st of July,” said Clotilde when the train had started.\n\"Grandmother is returning from the Tulettes, after making her monthly\nvisit to Aunt Dide. Did you see the glance she cast at me?”",
        "Pascal was at heart glad of the quarrel with his mother, which freed\nhim from the continual annoyance of her visits.",
        "“Bah!” he said simply, “when people cannot agree it is better for them\nnot to see each other.”",
        "But the young girl remained troubled and thoughtful. After a few\nmoments she said in an undertone:",
        "“I thought her changed–looking paler. And did you notice? she who is\nusually so carefully dressed had only one glove on–a yellow glove, on\nthe right hand. I don’t know why it was, but she made me feel sick at\nheart.”",
        "Pascal, who was also disturbed, made a vague gesture. His mother would\nno doubt grow old at last, like everybody else. But she was very\nactive, very full of fire still. She was thinking, he said, of\nbequeathing her fortune to the town of Plassans, to build a house of\nrefuge, which should bear the name of Rougon. Both had recovered their\ngaiety when he cried suddenly:",
        "“Why, it is to-morrow that you and I are to go to the Tulettes to see\nour patients. And you know that I promised to take Charles to Uncle\nMacquart’s.”",
        "Felicite was in fact returning from the Tulettes, where she went\nregularly on the first of every month to inquire after Aunt Dide. For\nmany years past she had taken a keen interest in the madwoman’s\nhealth, amazed to see her lasting so long, and furious with her for\npersisting in living so far beyond the common term of life, until she\nhad become a very prodigy of longevity. What a relief, the fine\nmorning on which they should put under ground this troublesome witness\nof the past, this specter of expiation and of waiting, who brought\nliving before her the abominations of the family! When so many others\nhad been taken she, who was demented and who had only a spark of life\nleft in her eyes, seemed forgotten. On this day she had found her as\nusual, skeleton-like, stiff and erect in her armchair. As the keeper\nsaid, there was now no reason why she should ever die. She was a\nhundred and five years old.",
        "When she left the asylum Felicite was furious. She thought of Uncle\nMacquart. Another who troubled her, who persisted in living with\nexasperating obstinacy! Although he was only eighty-four years old,\nthree years older than herself, she thought him ridiculously aged,\npast the allotted term of life. And a man who led so dissipated a\nlife, who had gone to bed dead drunk every night for the last sixty\nyears! The good and the sober were taken away; he flourished in spite\nof everything, blooming with health and gaiety. In days past, just\nafter he had settled at the Tulettes, she had made him presents of\nwines, liqueurs and brandy, in the unavowed hope of ridding the family\nof a fellow who was really disreputable, and from whom they had\nnothing to expect but annoyance and shame. But she had soon perceived\nthat all this liquor served, on the contrary, to keep up his health\nand spirits and his sarcastic humor, and she had left off making him\npresents, seeing that he throve on what she had hoped would prove a\npoison to him. She had cherished a deadly hatred toward him since\nthen. She would have killed him if she had dared, every time she saw\nhim, standing firmly on his drunken legs, and laughing at her to her\nface, knowing well that she was watching for his death, and triumphant\nbecause he did not give her the pleasure of burying with him all the\nold dirty linen of the family, the blood and mud of the two conquests\nof Plassans.",
        "“You see, Felicite,” he would often say to her with his air of wicked\nmockery, “I am here to take care of the old mother, and the day on\nwhich we both make up our minds to die it would be through compliment\nto you–yes, simply to spare you the trouble of running to see us so\ngood-naturedly, in this way, every month.”",
        "Generally she did not now give herself the disappointment of going to\nMacquart’s, but inquired for him at the asylum. But on this occasion,\nhaving learned there that he was passing through an extraordinary\nattack of drunkenness, not having drawn a sober breath for a\nfortnight, and so intoxicated that he was probably unable to leave the\nhouse, she was seized with the curiosity to learn for herself what his\ncondition really was. And as she was going back to the station, she\nwent out of her way in order to stop at Macquart’s house.",
        "The day was superb–a warm and brilliant summer day. On either side of\nthe path which she had taken, she saw the fields that she had given\nhim in former days–all this fertile land, the price of his secrecy\nand his good behavior. Before her appeared the house, with its pink\ntiles and its bright yellow walls, looking gay in the sunshine. Under\nthe ancient mulberry trees on the terrace she enjoyed the delightful\ncoolness and the beautiful view. What a pleasant and safe retreat,\nwhat a happy solitude was this for an old man to end in joy and peace\na long and well-spent life!",
        "But she did not see him, she did not hear him. The silence was\nprofound. The only sound to be heard was the humming of the bees\ncircling around the tall marshmallows. And on the terrace there was\nnothing to be seen but a little yellow dog, stretched at full length\non the bare ground, seeking the coolness of the shade. He raised his\nhead growling, about to bark, but, recognizing the visitor, he lay\ndown again quietly.",
        "Then, in this peaceful and sunny solitude she was seized with a\nstrange chill, and she called:",
        "“Macquart! Macquart!”",
        "The door of the house under the mulberry trees stood wide open. But\nshe did not dare to go in; this empty house with its wide open door\ngave her a vague uneasiness. And she called again:",
        "“Macquart! Macquart!”",
        "Not a sound, not a breath. Profound silence reigned again, but the\nhumming of the bees circling around the tall marshmallows sounded\nlouder than before.",
        "At last Felicite, ashamed of her fears, summoned courage to enter. The\ndoor on the left of the hall, opening into the kitchen, where Uncle\nMacquart generally sat, was closed. She pushed it open, but she could\ndistinguish nothing at first, as the blinds had been closed, probably\nin order to shut out the heat. Her first sensation was one of choking,\ncaused by an overpowering odor of alcohol which filled the room; every\narticle of furniture seemed to exude this odor, the whole house was\nimpregnated with it. At last, when her eyes had become accustomed to\nthe semi-obscurity, she perceived Macquart. He was seated at the\ntable, on which were a glass and a bottle of spirits of thirty-six\ndegrees, completely empty. Settled in his chair, he was sleeping\nprofoundly, dead drunk. This spectacle revived her anger and contempt.",
        "“Come, Macquart,” she cried, “is it not vile and senseless to put\none’s self in such a state! Wake up, I say, this is shameful!”",
        "His sleep was so profound that she could not even hear him breathing.\nIn vain she raised her voice, and slapped him smartly on the hands.",
        "“Macquart! Macquart! Macquart! Ah, faugh! You are disgusting, my\ndear!”",
        "Then she left him, troubling herself no further about him, and walked\naround the room, evidently seeking something. Coming down the dusky\nroad from the asylum she had been seized with a consuming thirst, and\nshe wished to get a glass of water. Her gloves embarrassed her, and\nshe took them off and put them on a corner of the table. Then she\nsucceeded in finding the jug, and she washed a glass and filled it to\nthe brim, and was about to empty it when she saw an extraordinary\nsight–a sight which agitated her so greatly that she set the glass\ndown again beside her gloves, without drinking.",
        "By degrees she had begun to see objects more clearly in the room,\nwhich was lighted dimly by a few stray sunbeams that filtered through\nthe cracks of the old shutters. She now saw Uncle Macquart distinctly,\nneatly dressed in a blue cloth suit, as usual, and on his head the\neternal fur cap which he wore from one year’s end to the other. He had\ngrown stout during the last five or six years, and he looked like a\nveritable mountain of flesh overlaid with rolls of fat. And she\nnoticed that he must have fallen asleep while smoking, for his pipe–a\nshort black pipe–had fallen into his lap. Then she stood still,\nstupefied with amazement–the burning tobacco had been scattered in\nthe fall, and the cloth of the trousers had caught fire, and through a\nhole in the stuff, as large already as a hundred-sous piece, she saw\nthe bare thigh, whence issued a little blue flame.",
        "At first Felicite had thought that it was linen–the drawers or the\nshirt–that was burning. But soon doubt was no longer possible, she\nsaw distinctly the bare flesh and the little blue flame issuing from\nit, lightly dancing, like a flame wandering over the surface of a\nvessel of lighted alcohol. It was as yet scarcely higher than the\nflame of a night light, pale and soft, and so unstable that the\nslightest breath of air caused it to change its place. But it\nincreased and spread rapidly, and the skin cracked and the fat began\nto melt.",
        "An involuntary cry escaped from Felicite’s throat.",
        "“Macquart! Macquart!”",
        "But still he did not stir. His insensibility must have been complete;\nintoxication must have produced a sort of coma, in which there was an\nabsolute paralysis of sensation, for he was living, his breast could\nbe seen rising and falling, in slow and even respiration.",
        "“Macquart! Macquart!”",
        "Now the fat was running through the cracks of the skin, feeding the\nflame, which was invading the abdomen. And Felicite comprehended\nvaguely that Uncle Macquart was burning before her like a sponge\nsoaked with brandy. He had, indeed, been saturated with it for years\npast, and of the strongest and most inflammable kind. He would no\ndoubt soon be blazing from head to foot, like a bowl of punch.",
        "Then she ceased to try to awaken him, since he was sleeping so\nsoundly. For a full minute she had the courage to look at him,\nawe-stricken, but gradually coming to a determination. Her hands,\nhowever, began to tremble, with a little shiver which she could not\ncontrol. She was choking, and taking up the glass of water again with\nboth hands, she emptied it at a draught. And she was going away on\ntiptoe, when she remembered her gloves. She went back, groped for them\nanxiously on the table and, as she thought, picked them both up. Then\nshe left the room, closing the door behind her carefully, and as gently\nas if she were afraid of disturbing some one.",
        "When she found herself once more on the terrace, in the cheerful\nsunshine and the pure air, in face of the vast horizon bathed in\nlight, she heaved a sigh of relief. The country was deserted; no one\ncould have seen her entering or leaving the house. Only the yellow dog\nwas still stretched there, and he did not even deign to look up. And\nshe went away with her quick, short step, her youthful figure lightly\nswaying. A hundred steps away, an irresistible impulse compelled her\nto turn round to give a last look at the house, so tranquil and so\ncheerful on the hillside, in the declining light of the beautiful day.",
        "Only when she was in the train and went to put on her gloves did she\nperceive that one of them was missing. But she supposed that it had\nfallen on the platform at the station as she was getting into the car.\nShe believed herself to be quite calm, but she remained with one hand\ngloved and one hand bare, which, with her, could only be the result of\ngreat agitation.",
        "On the following day Pascal and Clotilde took the three o’clock train\nto go to the Tulettes. The mother of Charles, the harness-maker’s\nwife, had brought the boy to them, as they had offered to take him to\nUncle Macquart’s, where he was to remain for the rest of the week.\nFresh quarrels had disturbed the peace of the household, the husband\nhaving resolved to tolerate no longer in his house another man’s\nchild, that do-nothing, imbecile prince’s son. As it was Grandmother\nRougon who had dressed him, he was, indeed, dressed on this day,\nagain, in black velvet trimmed with gold braid, like a young lord, a\npage of former times going to court. And during the quarter of an hour\nwhich the journey lasted, Clotilde amused herself in the compartment,\nin which they were alone, by taking off his cap and smoothing his\nbeautiful blond locks, his royal hair that fell in curls over his\nshoulders. She had a ring on her finger, and as she passed her hand\nover his neck she was startled to perceive that her caress had left\nbehind it a trace of blood. One could not touch the boy’s skin without\nthe red dew exuding from it; the tissues had become so lax through\nextreme degeneration that the slightest scratch brought on a\nhemorrhage. The doctor became at once uneasy, and asked him if he\nstill bled at the nose as frequently as formerly. Charles hardly knew\nwhat to answer; first saying no, then, recollecting himself, he said\nthat he had bled a great deal the other day. He seemed, indeed,\nweaker; he grew more childish as he grew older; his intelligence,\nwhich had never developed, had become clouded. This tall boy of\nfifteen, so beautiful, so girlish-looking, with the color of a flower\nthat had grown in the shade, did not look ten.",
        "At the Tulettes Pascal decided that they would first take the boy to\nUncle Macquart’s. They ascended the steep road. In the distance the\nlittle house looked gay in the sunshine, as it had looked on the day\nbefore, with its yellow walls and its green mulberry trees extending\ntheir twisted branches and covering the terrace with a thick, leafy\nroof. A delightful sense of peace pervaded this solitary spot, this\nsage’s retreat, where the only sound to be heard was the humming of\nthe bees, circling round the tall marshmallows.",
        "“Ah, that rascal of an uncle!” said Pascal, smiling, “how I envy him!”",
        "But he was surprised not to have already seen him standing at the edge\nof the terrace. And as Charles had run off dragging Clotilde with him\nto see the rabbits, as he said, the doctor continued the ascent alone,\nand was astonished when he reached the top to see no one. The blinds\nwere closed, the hill door yawned wide open. Only the yellow dog was\nat the threshold, his legs stiff, his hair bristling, howling with a\nlow and continuous moan. When he saw the visitor, whom he no doubt\nrecognized, approaching, he stopped howling for an instant and went\nand stood further off, then he began again to whine softly.",
        "Pascal, filled with apprehension, could not keep back the uneasy cry\nthat rose to his lips:",
        "“Macquart! Macquart!”",
        "No one answered; a deathlike silence reigned over the house, with its\ndoor yawning wide open, like the mouth of a cavern. The dog continued\nto howl.",
        "Then Pascal grew impatient, and cried more loudly.",
        "“Macquart! Macquart!”",
        "There was not a stir; the bees hummed, the sky looked down serenely on\nthe peaceful scene. Then he hesitated no longer. Perhaps Macquart was\nasleep. But the instant he pushed open the door of the kitchen on the\nleft of the hall, a horrible odor escaped from it, an odor of burned\nflesh and bones. When he entered the room he could hardly breathe, so\nfilled was it by a thick vapor, a stagnant and nauseous cloud, which\nchoked and blinded him. The sunbeams that filtered through the cracks\nmade only a dim light. He hurried to the fireplace, thinking that\nperhaps there had been a fire, but the fireplace was empty, and the\narticles of furniture around appeared to be uninjured. Bewildered, and\nfeeling himself growing faint in the poisoned atmosphere, he ran to\nthe window and threw the shutters wide open. A flood of light entered.",
        "Then the scene presented to the doctor’s view filled him with\namazement. Everything was in its place; the glass and the empty bottle\nof spirits were on the table; only the chair in which Uncle Macquart\nmust have been sitting bore traces of fire, the front legs were\nblackened and the straw was partially consumed. What had become of\nMacquart? Where could he have disappeared? In front of the chair, on\nthe brick floor, which was saturated with grease, there was a little\nheap of ashes, beside which lay the pipe–a black pipe, which had not\neven broken in falling. All of Uncle Macquart was there, in this\nhandful of fine ashes; and he was in the red cloud, also, which\nfloated through the open window; in the layer of soot which carpeted\nthe entire kitchen; the horrible grease of burnt flesh, enveloping\neverything, sticky and foul to the touch.",
        "It was the finest case of spontaneous combustion physician had ever\nseen. The doctor had, indeed, read in medical papers of surprising\ncases, among others that of a shoemaker’s wife, a drunken woman who\nhad fallen asleep over her foot warmer, and of whom they had found\nonly a hand and foot. He had, until now, put little faith in these\ncases, unwilling to admit, like the ancients, that a body impregnated\nwith alcohol could disengage an unknown gas, capable of taking fire\nspontaneously and consuming the flesh and the bones. But he denied the\ntruth of them no longer; besides, everything became clear to him as he\nreconstructed the scene–the coma of drunkenness producing absolute\ninsensibility; the pipe falling on the clothes, which had taken fire;\nthe flesh, saturated with liquor, burning and cracking; the fat\nmelting, part of it running over the ground and part of it aiding the\ncombustion, and all, at last–muscles, organs, and bones–consumed in\na general blaze. Uncle Macquart was all there, with his blue cloth\nsuit, and his fur cap, which he wore from one year’s end to the other.\nDoubtless, as soon as he had begun to burn like a bonfire he had\nfallen forward, which would account for the chair being only\nblackened; and nothing of him was left, not a bone, not a tooth, not a\nnail, nothing but this little heap of gray dust which the draught of\nair from the door threatened at every moment to sweep away.",
        "Clotilde had meanwhile entered, Charles remaining outside, his\nattention attracted by the continued howling of the dog.",
        "“Good Heavens, what a smell!” she cried. “What is the matter?”",
        "When Pascal explained to her the extraordinary catastrophe that had\ntaken place, she shuddered. She took up the bottle to examine it, but\nshe put it down again with horror, feeling it moist and sticky with\nUncle Macquart’s flesh. Nothing could be touched, the smallest objects\nwere coated, as it were, with this yellowish grease which stuck to the\nhands.",
        "A shudder of mingled awe and disgust passed through her, and she burst\ninto tears, faltering:",
        "“What a sad death! What a horrible death!”",
        "Pascal had recovered from his first shock, and he was almost smiling.",
        "“Why horrible? He was eighty-four years old; he did not suffer. As for\nme, I think it a superb death for that old rascal of an uncle, who, it\nmay be now said, did not lead a very exemplary life. You remember his\nenvelope; he had some very terrible and vile things upon his\nconscience, which did not prevent him, however, from settling down\nlater and growing old, surrounded by every comfort, like an old\nhumbug, receiving the recompense of virtues which he did not possess.\nAnd here he lies like the prince of drunkards, burning up of himself,\nconsumed on the burning funeral pile of his own body!”",
        "And the doctor waved his hand in admiration.",
        "“Just think of it. To be drunk to the point of not feeling that one is\non fire; to set one’s self aflame, like a bonfire on St. John’s day;\nto disappear in smoke to the last bone. Think of Uncle Macquart\nstarting on his journey through space; first diffused through the four\ncorners of the room, dissolved in air and floating about, bathing all\nthat belonged to him; then escaping in a cloud of dust through the\nwindow, when I opened it for him, soaring up into the sky, filling the\nhorizon. Why, that is an admirable death! To disappear, to leave\nnothing of himself behind but a little heap of ashes and a pipe beside\nit!”",
        "And he picked up the pipe to keep it, as he said, as a relic of Uncle\nMacquart; while Clotilde, who thought she perceived a touch of bitter\nmockery in his eulogistic rhapsody, shuddered anew with horror and\ndisgust. But suddenly she perceived something under the table–part of\nthe remains, perhaps.",
        "“Look at that fragment there.”",
        "He stooped down and picked up with surprise a woman’s glove, a yellow\nglove.",
        "“Why!” she cried, “it is grandmother’s glove; the glove that was\nmissing last evening.”",
        "They looked at each other; by a common impulse the same explanation\nrose to their lips, Felicite was certainly there yesterday; and a\nsudden conviction forced itself on the doctor’s mind–the conviction\nthat his mother had seen Uncle Macquart burning and that she had not\nquenched him. Various indications pointed to this–the state of\ncomplete coolness in which he found the room, the number of hours\nwhich he calculated to have been necessary for the combustion of the\nbody. He saw clearly the same thought dawning in the terrified eyes of\nhis companion. But as it seemed impossible that they should ever know\nthe truth, he fabricated aloud the simplest explanation:",
        "“No doubt your grandmother came in yesterday on her way back from the\nasylum, to say good day to Uncle Macquart, before he had begun\ndrinking.”",
        "“Let us go away! let us go away!” cried Clotilde. “I am stifling here;\nI cannot remain here!”",
        "Pascal, too, wished to go and give information of the death. He went\nout after her, shut up the house, and put the key in his pocket.\nOutside, they heard the little yellow dog still howling. He had taken\nrefuge between Charles’ legs, and the boy amused himself pushing him\nwith his foot and listening to him whining, without comprehending.",
        "The doctor went at once to the house of M. Maurin, the notary at the\nTulettes, who was also mayor of the commune. A widower for ten years\npast, and living with his daughter, who was a childless widow, he had\nmaintained neighborly relations with old Macquart, and had\noccasionally kept little Charles with him for several days at a time,\nhis daughter having become interested in the boy who was so handsome\nand so much to be pitied. M. Maurin, horrified at the news, went at\nonce with the doctor to draw up a statement of the accident, and\npromised to make out the death certificate in due form. As for\nreligious ceremonies, funeral obsequies, they seemed scarcely\npossible. When they entered the kitchen the draught from the door\nscattered the ashes about, and when they piously attempted to collect\nthem again they succeeded only in gathering together the scrapings of\nthe flags, a collection of accumulated dirt, in which there could be\nbut little of Uncle Macquart. What, then, could they bury? It was\nbetter to give up the idea. So they gave it up. Besides, Uncle\nMacquart had been hardly a devout Catholic, and the family contented\nthemselves with causing masses to be said later on for the repose of\nhis soul.",
        "The notary, meantime, had immediately declared that there existed a\nwill, which had been deposited with him, and he asked Pascal to meet\nhim at his house on the next day but one for the reading; for he\nthought he might tell the doctor at once that Uncle Macquart had\nchosen him as his executor. And he ended by offering, like a\nkindhearted man, to keep Charles with him until then, comprehending\nhow greatly the boy, who was so unwelcome at his mother’s, would be in\nthe way in the midst of all these occurrences. Charles seemed\nenchanted, and he remained at the Tulettes.",
        "It was not until very late, until seven o’clock, that Clotilde and\nPascal were able to take the train to return to Plassans, after the\ndoctor had at last visited the two patients whom he had to see. But\nwhen they returned together to the notary’s on the day appointed for\nthe meeting, they had the disagreeable surprise of finding old Mme.\nRougon installed there. She had naturally learned of Macquart’s death,\nand had hurried there on the following day, full of excitement, and\nmaking a great show of grief; and she had just made her appearance\nagain to-day, having heard the famous testament spoken of. The reading\nof the will, however, was a simple matter, unmarked by any incident.\nMacquart had left all the fortune that he could dispose of for the\npurpose of erecting a superb marble monument to himself, with two\nangels with folded wings, weeping. It was his own idea, a reminiscence\nof a similar tomb which he had seen abroad–in Germany, perhaps–when\nhe was a soldier. And he had charged his nephew Pascal to superintend\nthe erection of the monument, as he was the only one of the family, he\nsaid, who had any taste.",
        "During the reading of the will Clotilde had remained in the notary’s\ngarden, sitting on a bench under the shade of an ancient chestnut\ntree. When Pascal and Felicite again appeared, there was a moment of\ngreat embarrassment, for they had not spoken to one another for some\nmonths past. The old lady, however, affected to be perfectly at her\nease, making no allusion whatever to the new situation, and giving it\nto be understood that they might very well meet and appear united\nbefore the world, without for that reason entering into an explanation\nor becoming reconciled. But she committed the mistake of laying too\nmuch stress on the great grief which Macquart’s death had caused her.\nPascal, who suspected the overflowing joy, the unbounded delight which\nit gave her to think that this family ulcer was to be at last healed,\nthat this abominable uncle was at last out of the way, became\ngradually possessed by an impatience, an indignation, which he could\nnot control. His eyes fastened themselves involuntarily on his\nmother’s gloves, which were black.",
        "Just then she was expressing her grief in lowered tones:",
        "“But how imprudent it was, at his age, to persist in living alone–\nlike a wolf in his lair! If he had only had a servant in the house\nwith him!”",
        "Then the doctor, hardly conscious of what he was saying, terrified at\nhearing himself say the words, but impelled by an irresistible force,\nsaid:",
        "“But, mother, since you were there, why did you not quench him?”",
        "Old Mme. Rougon turned frightfully pale. How could her son have known?\nShe looked at him for an instant in open-mouthed amazement; while\nClotilde grew as pale as she, in the certainty of the crime, which was\nnow evident. It was an avowal, this terrified silence which had fallen\nbetween the mother, the son, and the granddaughter–the shuddering\nsilence in which families bury their domestic tragedies. The doctor,\nin despair at having spoken, he who avoided so carefully all\ndisagreeable and useless explanations, was trying desperately to\nretract his words, when a new catastrophe extricated him from his\nterrible embarrassment.",
        "Felicite desired to take Charles away with her, in order not to\ntrespass on the notary’s kind hospitality; and as the latter had sent\nthe boy after breakfast to spend an hour or two with Aunt Dide, he had\nsent the maid servant to the asylum with orders to bring him back\nimmediately. It was at this juncture that the servant, whom they were\nwaiting for in the garden, made her appearance, covered with\nperspiration, out of breath, and greatly excited, crying from a\ndistance:",
        "“My God! My God! come quickly. Master Charles is bathed in blood.”",
        "Filled with consternation, all three set off for the asylum. This day\nchanced to be one of Aunt Dide’s good days; very calm and gentle she\nsat erect in the armchair in which she had spent the hours, the long\nhours for twenty-two years past, looking straight before her into\nvacancy. She seemed to have grown still thinner, all the flesh had\ndisappeared, her limbs were now only bones covered with parchment-like\nskin; and her keeper, the stout fair-haired girl, carried her, fed\nher, took her up and laid her down as if she had been a bundle. The\nancestress, the forgotten one, tall, bony, ghastly, remained\nmotionless, her eyes, only seeming to have life, her eyes shining\nclear as spring water in her thin withered face. But on this morning,\nagain a sudden rush of tears had streamed down her cheeks, and she had\nbegun to stammer words without any connection; which seemed to prove\nthat in the midst of her senile exhaustion and the incurable torpor of\nmadness, the slow induration of the brain and the limbs was not yet\ncomplete; there still were memories stored away, gleams of\nintelligence still were possible. Then her face had resumed its vacant\nexpression. She seemed indifferent to every one and everything,\nlaughing, sometimes, at an accident, at a fall, but most often seeing\nnothing and hearing nothing, gazing fixedly into vacancy.",
        "When Charles had been brought to her the keeper had immediately\ninstalled him before the little table, in front of his great-great-\ngrandmother. The girl kept a package of pictures for him–soldiers,\ncaptains, kings clad in purple and gold, and she gave them to him with\na pair of scissors, saying:",
        "“There, amuse yourself quietly, and behave well. You see that to-day\ngrandmother is very good. You must be good, too.”",
        "The boy raised his eyes to the madwoman’s face, and both looked at\neach other. At this moment the resemblance between them was\nextraordinary. Their eyes, especially, their vacant and limpid eyes,\nseemed to lose themselves in one another, to be identical. Then it was\nthe physiognomy, the whole face, the worn features of the centenarian,\nthat passed over three generations to this delicate child’s face, it,\ntoo, worn already, as it were, and aged by the wear of the race.\nNeither smiled, they regarded each other intently, with an air of\ngrave imbecility.",
        "“Well!” continued the keeper, who had acquired the habit of talking to\nherself to cheer herself when with her mad charge, “you cannot deny\neach other. The same hand made you both. You are the very spit-down of\neach other. Come, laugh a bit, amuse yourselves, since you like to be\ntogether.”",
        "But to fix his attention for any length of time fatigued Charles, and\nhe was the first to lower his eyes; he seemed to be interested in his\npictures, while Aunt Dide, who had an astonishing power of fixing her\nattention, as if she had been turned into stone, continued to look at\nhim fixedly, without even winking an eyelid.",
        "The keeper busied herself for a few moments in the little sunny room,\nmade gay by its light, blue-flowered paper. She made the bed which she\nhad been airing, she arranged the linen on the shelves of the press.\nBut she generally profited by the presence of the boy to take a little\nrelaxation. She had orders never to leave her charge alone, and now\nthat he was here she ventured to trust her with him.",
        "“Listen to me well,” she went on, “I have to go out for a little, and\nif she stirs, if she should need me, ring for me, call me at once; do\nyou hear? You understand, you are a big enough boy to be able to call\none.”",
        "He had looked up again, and made a sign that he had understood and\nthat he would call her. And when he found himself alone with Aunt Dide\nhe returned to his pictures quietly. This lasted for a quarter of an\nhour amid the profound silence of the asylum, broken only at intervals\nby some prison sound–a stealthy step, the jingling of a bunch of\nkeys, and occasionally a loud cry, immediately silenced. But the boy\nmust have been tired by the excessive heat of the day, for sleep\ngradually stole over him. Soon his head, fair as a lily, drooped, and\nas if weighed down by the too heavy casque of his royal locks, he let\nit sink gently on the pictures and fell asleep, with his cheek resting\non the gold and purple kings. The lashes of his closed eyelids cast a\nshadow on his delicate skin, with its small blue veins, through which\nlife pulsed feebly. He was beautiful as an angel, but with the\nindefinable corruption of a whole race spread over his countenance.\nAnd Aunt Dide looked at him with her vacant stare in which there was\nneither pleasure nor pain, the stare of eternity contemplating things\nearthly.",
        "At the end of a few moments, however, an expression of interest seemed\nto dawn in the clear eyes. Something had just happened, a drop of\nblood was forming on the edge of the left nostril of the boy. This\ndrop fell and another formed and followed it. It was the blood, the\ndew of blood, exuding this time, without a scratch, without a bruise,\nwhich issued and flowed of itself in the laxity of the degenerate\ntissues. The drops became a slender thread which flowed over the gold\nof the pictures. A little pool covered them, and made its way to a\ncorner of the table; then the drops began again, splashing dully one\nby one upon the floor. And he still slept, with the divinely calm look\nof a cherub, not even conscious of the life that was escaping from\nhim; and the madwoman continued to look at him, with an air of\nincreasing interest, but without terror, amused, rather, her attention\nengaged by this, as by the flight of the big flies, which her gaze\noften followed for hours.",
        "Several minutes more passed, the slender thread had grown larger, the\ndrops followed one another more rapidly, falling on the floor with a\nmonotonous and persistent drip. And Charles, at one moment, stirred,\nopened his eyes, and perceived that he was covered with blood. But he\nwas not frightened; he was accustomed to this bloody spring, which\nissued from him at the slightest cause. He merely gave a sigh of\nweariness. Instinct, however, must have warned him, for he moaned more\nloudly than before, and called confusedly in stammering accents:",
        "“Mamma! mamma!”",
        "His weakness was no doubt already excessive, for an irresistible\nstupor once more took possession of him, his head dropped, his eyes\nclosed, and he seemed to fall asleep again, continuing his plaint, as\nif in a dream, moaning in fainter and fainter accents:",
        "“Mamma! mamma!”",
        "Now the pictures were inundated; the black velvet jacket and trousers,\nbraided with gold, were stained with long streaks of blood, and the\nlittle red stream began again to flow persistently from his left\nnostril, without stopping, crossed the red pool on the table and fell\nupon the ground, where it at last formed a veritable lake. A loud cry\nfrom the madwoman, a terrified call would have sufficed. But she did\nnot cry, she did not call; motionless, rigid, emaciated, sitting there\nforgotten of the world, she gazed with the fixed look of the\nancestress who sees the destinies of her race being accomplished. She\nsat there as if dried up, bound; her limbs and her tongue tied by her\nhundred years, her brain ossified by madness, incapable of willing or\nof acting. And yet the sight of the little red stream began to stir\nsome feeling in her. A tremor passed over her deathlike countenance, a\nflush mounted to her cheeks. Finally, a last plaint roused her\ncompletely:",
        "“Mamma! mamma!”",
        "Then it was evident that a terrible struggle was taking place in Aunt\nDide. She carried her skeleton-like hand to her forehead as if she\nfelt her brain bursting. Her mouth was wide open, but no sound issued\nfrom it; the dreadful tumult that had arisen within her had no doubt\nparalyzed her tongue. She tried to rise, to run, but she had no longer\nany muscles; she remained fastened to her seat. All her poor body\ntrembled in the superhuman effort which she was making to cry for\nhelp, without being able to break the bonds of old age and madness\nwhich held her prisoner. Her face was distorted with terror; memory\ngradually awakening, she must have comprehended everything.",
        "And it was a slow and gentle agony, of which the spectacle lasted for\nseveral minutes more. Charles, silent now, as if he had again fallen\nasleep, was losing the last drops of blood that had remained in his\nveins, which were emptying themselves softly. His lily-like whiteness\nincreased until it became a deathlike pallor. His lips lost their rosy\ncolor, became a pale pink, then white. And, as he was about to expire,\nhe opened his large eyes and fixed them on his great-great-\ngrandmother, who watched the light dying in them. All the waxen face\nwas already dead, the eyes only were still living. They still kept\ntheir limpidity, their brightness. All at once they became vacant, the\nlight in them was extinguished. This was the end–the death of the\neyes, and Charles had died, without a struggle, exhausted, like a\nfountain from which all the water has run out. Life no longer pulsed\nthrough the veins of his delicate skin, there was now only the shadow\nof its wings on his white face. But he remained divinely beautiful,\nhis face lying in blood, surrounded by his royal blond locks, like one\nof those little bloodless dauphins who, unable to bear the execrable\nheritage of their race, die of decrepitude and imbecility at sixteen.",
        "The boy exhaled his latest breath as Dr. Pascal entered the room,\nfollowed by Felicite and Clotilde. And when he saw the quantity of\nblood that inundated the floor, he cried:",
        "“Ah, my God! it is as I feared, a hemorrhage from the nose! The poor\ndarling, no one was with him, and it is all over!”",
        "But all three were struck with terror at the extraordinary spectacle\nthat now met their gaze. Aunt Dide, who seemed to have grown taller,\nin the superhuman effort she was making, had almost succeeded in\nraising herself up, and her eyes, fixed on the dead boy, so fair and\nso gentle, and on the red sea of blood, beginning to congeal, that was\nlying around him, kindled with a thought, after a long sleep of\ntwenty-two years. This final lesion of madness, this irremediable\ndarkness of the mind, was evidently not so complete but that some\nmemory of the past, lying hidden there, might awaken suddenly under\nthe terrible blow which had struck her. And the ancestress, the\nforgotten one, lived again, emerged from her oblivion, rigid and\nwasted, like a specter of terror and grief.",
        "For an instant she remained panting. Then with a shudder, which made\nher teeth chatter, she stammered a single phrase:",
        "“The gendarme! the gendarme!”",
        "Pascal and Felicite and Clotilde understood. They looked at one\nanother involuntarily, turning very pale. The whole dreadful history\nof the old mother–of the mother of them all–rose before them, the\nardent love of her youth, the long suffering of her mature age.\nAlready two moral shocks had shaken her terribly–the first, when she\nwas in her ardent prime, when a gendarme shot down her lover\nMacquart, the smuggler, like a dog; the second, years ago, when\nanother gendarme shattered with a pistol shot the skull of her\ngrandson Silvere, the insurgent, the victim of the hatred and the\nsanguinary strife of the family. Blood had always bespattered her. And\na third moral shock finished her; blood bespattered her again, the\nimpoverished blood of her race, which she had just beheld flowing\nslowly, and which lay upon the ground, while the fair royal child, his\nveins and his heart empty, slept.",
        "Three times–face to face with her past life, her life red with\npassion and suffering, haunted by the image of expiation–she\nstammered:",
        "“The gendarme! the gendarme! the gendarme!”",
        "Then she sank back into her armchair. They thought she was dead,\nkilled by the shock.",
        "But the keeper at this moment at last appeared, endeavoring to excuse\nherself, fearing that she would be dismissed. When, aided by her, Dr.\nPascal had placed Aunt Dide on the bed, he found that the old mother\nwas still alive. She was not to die until the following day, at the\nage of one hundred and five years, three months, and seven days, of\ncongestion of the brain, caused by the last shock she had received.",
        "Pascal, turning to his mother, said:",
        "“She will not live twenty-four hours; to-morrow she will be dead. Ah!\nUncle Macquart, then she, and this poor boy, one after another. How\nmuch misery and grief!”",
        "He paused and added in a lower tone:",
        "“The family is thinning out; the old trees fall and the young die\nstanding.”",
        "Felicite must have thought this another allusion. She was sincerely\nshocked by the tragic death of little Charles. But, notwithstanding,\nabove the horror which she felt there arose a sense of immense relief.\nNext week, when they should have ceased to weep, what a rest to be\nable to say to herself that all this abomination of the Tulettes was\nat an end, that the family might at last rise, and shine in history!",
        "Then she remembered that she had not answered the involuntary\naccusation made against her by her son at the notary’s; and she spoke\nagain of Macquart, through bravado:",
        "“You see now that servants are of no use. There was one here, and yet\nshe prevented nothing; it would have been useless for Uncle Macquart\nto have had one to take care of him; he would be in ashes now, all the\nsame.”",
        "She sighed, and then continued in a broken voice:",
        "“Well, well, neither our own fate nor that of others is in our hands;\nthings happen as they will. These are great blows that have fallen\nupon us. We must only trust to God for the preservation and the\nprosperity of our family.”",
        "Dr. Pascal bowed with his habitual air of deference and said:",
        "“You are right, mother.”",
        "Clotilde knelt down. Her former fervent Catholic faith had revived in\nthis chamber of blood, of madness, and of death. Tears streamed down\nher cheeks, and with clasped hands she was praying fervently for the\ndear ones who were no more. She prayed that God would grant that their\nsufferings might indeed be ended, their faults pardoned, and that they\nmight live again in another life, a life of unending happiness. And\nshe prayed with the utmost fervor, in her terror of a hell, which\nafter this miserable life would make suffering eternal.",
        "From this day Pascal and Clotilde went to visit their sick side by\nside, filled with greater pity than ever. Perhaps, with Pascal, the\nfeeling of his powerlessness against inevitable disease was even\nstronger than before. The only wisdom was to let nature take its\ncourse, to eliminate dangerous elements, and to labor only in the\nsupreme work of giving health and strength. But the suffering and the\ndeath of those who are dear to us awaken in us a hatred of disease, an\nirresistible desire to combat and to vanquish it. And the doctor never\ntasted so great a joy as when he succeeded, with his hypodermic\ninjections, in soothing a paroxysm of pain, in seeing the groaning\npatient grow tranquil and fall asleep. Clotilde, in return, adored\nhim, proud of their love, as if it were a consolation which they\ncarried, like the viaticum, to the poor.",
        "Martine one morning obtained from Dr. Pascal, as she did every three\nmonths, his receipt for fifteen hundred francs, to take it to the\nnotary Grandguillot, to get from him what she called their “income.\"\nThe doctor seemed surprised that the payment should have fallen due\nagain so soon; he had never been so indifferent as he was now about\nmoney matters, leaving to Martine the care of settling everything. And\nhe and Clotilde were under the plane trees, absorbed in the joy that\nfilled their life, lulled by the ceaseless song of the fountain, when\nthe servant returned with a frightened face, and in a state of\nextraordinary agitation. She was so breathless with excitement that\nfor a moment she could not speak.",
        "“Oh, my God! Oh, my God!” she cried at last. “M. Grandguillot has gone\naway!”",
        "Pascal did not at first comprehend.",
        "“Well, my girl, there is no hurry,” he said; “you can go back another\nday.”",
        "“No, no! He has gone away; don’t you hear? He has gone away forever–”",
        "And as the waters rush forth in the bursting of a dam, her emotion\nvented itself in a torrent of words.",
        "“I reached the street, and I saw from a distance a crowd gathered\nbefore the door. A chill ran through me; I felt that some misfortune\nhad happened. The door closed, and not a blind open, as if there was\nsomebody dead in the house. They told me when I got there that he had\nrun away; that he had not left a sou behind him; that many families\nwould be ruined.”",
        "She laid the receipt on the stone table.",
        "“There! There is your paper! It is all over with us, we have not a sou\nleft, we are going to die of starvation!” And she sobbed aloud in the\nanguish of her miserly heart, distracted by this loss of a fortune,\nand trembling at the prospect of impending want.",
        "Clotilde sat stunned and speechless, her eyes fixed on Pascal, whose\npredominating feeling at first seemed to be one of incredulity. He\nendeavored to calm Martine. Why! why! it would not do to give up in\nthis way. If all she knew of the affair was what she had heard from\nthe people in the street, it might be only gossip, after all, which\nalways exaggerates everything. M. Grandguillot a fugitive; M.\nGrandguillot a thief; that was monstrous, impossible! A man of such\nprobity, a house liked and respected by all Plassans for more than a\ncentury past. Why people thought money safer there than in the Bank of\nFrance.",
        "“Consider, Martine, this would not have come all of a sudden, like a\nthunderclap; there would have been some rumors of it beforehand. The\ndeuce! an old reputation does not fall to pieces in that way, in a\nnight.”",
        "At this she made a gesture of despair.",
        "“Ah, monsieur, that is what most afflicts me, because, you see, it\nthrows some of the responsibility on me. For weeks past I have been\nhearing stories on all sides. As for you two, naturally you hear\nnothing; you don’t even know whether you are alive or dead.”",
        "Neither Pascal nor Clotilde could refrain from smiling; for it was\nindeed true that their love lifted them so far above the earth that\nnone of the common sounds of existence reached them.",
        "“But the stories I heard were so ugly that I didn’t like to worry you\nwith them. I thought they were lies.”",
        "She was silent for a moment, and then added that while some people\nmerely accused M. Grandguillot of having speculated on the Bourse,\nthere were others who accused him of still worse practises. And she\nburst into fresh sobs.",
        "“My God! My God! what is going to become of us? We are all going to\ndie of starvation!”",
        "Shaken, then, moved by seeing Clotilde’s eyes, too, filled with tears,\nPascal made an effort to remember, to see clearly into the past. Years\nago, when he had been practising in Plassans, he had deposited at\ndifferent times, with M. Grandguillot, the twenty thousand francs on\nthe interest of which he had lived comfortably for the past sixteen\nyears, and on each occasion the notary had given him a receipt for the\nsum deposited. This would no doubt enable him to establish his\nposition as a personal creditor. Then a vague recollection awoke in\nhis memory; he remembered, without being able to fix the date, that at\nthe request of the notary, and in consequence of certain\nrepresentations made by him, which Pascal had forgotten, he had given\nthe lawyer a power of attorney for the purpose of investing the whole\nor a part of his money, in mortgages, and he was even certain that in\nthis power the name of the attorney had been left in blank. But he was\nignorant as to whether this document had ever been used or not; he had\nnever taken the trouble to inquire how his money had been invested. A\nfresh pang of miserly anguish made Martine cry out:",
        "“Ah, monsieur, you are well punished for your sin. Was that a way to\nabandon one’s money? For my part, I know almost to a sou how my\naccount stands every quarter; I have every figure and every document\nat my fingers’ ends.”",
        "In the midst of her distress an unconscious smile broke over her face,\nlighting it all up. Her long cherished passion had been gratified; her\nfour hundred francs wages, saved almost intact, put out at interest\nfor thirty years, at last amounted to the enormous sum of twenty\nthousand francs. And this treasure was put away in a safe place which\nno one knew. She beamed with delight at the recollection, and she said\nno more.",
        "“But who says that our money is lost?” cried Pascal.",
        "“M. Grandguillot had a private fortune; he has not taken away with him\nhis house and his lands, I suppose. They will look into the affair;\nthey will make an investigation. I cannot make up my mind to believe\nhim a common thief. The only trouble is the delay: a liquidation drags\non so long.”",
        "He spoke in this way in order to reassure Clotilde, whose growing\nanxiety he observed. She looked at him, and she looked around her at\nLa Souleiade; her only care his happiness; her most ardent desire to\nlive here always, as she had lived in the past, to love him always in\nthis beloved solitude. And he, wishing to tranquilize her, recovered\nhis fine indifference; never having lived for money, he did not\nimagine that one could suffer from the want of it.",
        "“But I have some money!” he cried, at last. “What does Martine mean by\nsaying that we have not a sou left, and that we are going to die of\nstarvation!”",
        "And he rose gaily, and made them both follow him saying:",
        "“Come, come, I am going to show you some money. And I will give some\nof it to Martine that she may make us a good dinner this evening.”",
        "Upstairs in his room he triumphantly opened his desk before them. It\nwas in a drawer of this desk that for years past he had thrown the\nmoney which his later patients had brought him of their own accord,\nfor he had never sent them an account. Nor had he ever known the exact\namount of his little treasure, of the gold and bank bills mingled\ntogether in confusion, from which he took the sums he required for his\npocket money, his experiments, his presents, and his alms. During the\nlast few months he had made frequent visits to his desk, making deep\ninroads into its contents. But he had been so accustomed to find there\nthe sums he required, after years of economy during which he had spent\nscarcely anything, that he had come to believe his savings\ninexhaustible.",
        "He gave a satisfied laugh, then, as he opened the drawer, crying:",
        "“Now you shall see! Now you shall see!”",
        "And he was confounded, when, after searching among the heap of notes\nand bills, he succeeded in collecting only a sum of 615 francs–two\nnotes of 100 francs each, 400 francs in gold, and 15 francs in change.\nHe shook out the papers, he felt in every corner of the drawer,\ncrying:",
        "“But it cannot be! There was always money here before, there was a\nheap of money here a few days ago. It must have been all those old\nbills that misled me. I assure you that last week I saw a great deal\nof money. I had it in my hand.”",
        "He spoke with such amusing good faith, his childlike surprise was so\nsincere, that Clotilde could not keep from smiling. Ah, the poor\nmaster, what a wretched business man he was! Then, as she observed\nMartine’s look of anguish, her utter despair at sight of this\ninsignificant sum, which was now all there was for the maintenance of\nall three, she was seized with a feeling of despair; her eyes filled\nwith tears, and she murmured:",
        "“My God, it is for me that you have spent everything; if we have\nnothing now, if we are ruined, it is I who am the cause of it!”",
        "Pascal had already forgotten the money he had taken for the presents.\nEvidently that was where it had gone. The explanation tranquilized\nhim. And as she began to speak in her grief of returning everything to\nthe dealers, he grew angry.",
        "“Give back what I have given you! You would give a piece of my heart\nwith it, then! No, I would rather die of hunger, I tell you!”",
        "Then his confidence already restored, seeing a future of unlimited\npossibilities opening out before him, he said:",
        "“Besides, we are not going to die of hunger to-night, are we, Martine?\nThere is enough here to keep us for a long time.”",
        "Martine shook her head. She would undertake to manage with it for two\nmonths, for two and a half, perhaps, if people had sense, but not\nlonger. Formerly the drawer was replenished; there was always some\nmoney coming in; but now that monsieur had given up his patients, they\nhad absolutely no income. They must not count on any help from\noutside, then. And she ended by saying:",
        "“Give me the two one-hundred-franc bills. I’ll try and make them last\nfor a month. Then we shall see. But be very prudent; don’t touch the\nfour hundred francs in gold; lock the drawer and don’t open it again.”",
        "“Oh, as to that,” cried the doctor, “you may make your mind easy. I\nwould rather cut off my right hand.”",
        "And thus it was settled. Martine was to have entire control of this\nlast purse; and they might trust to her economy, they were sure that\nshe would save the centimes. As for Clotilde, who had never had a\nprivate purse, she would not even feel the want of money. Pascal only\nwould suffer from no longer having his inexhaustible treasure to draw\nupon, but he had given his promise to allow the servant to buy\neverything.",
        "“There! That is a good piece of work!” he said, relieved, as happy as\nif he had just settled some important affair which would assure them a\nliving for a long time to come.",
        "A week passed during which nothing seemed to have changed at La\nSouleiade. In the midst of their tender raptures neither Pascal nor\nClotilde thought any more of the want which was impending. And one\nmorning during the absence of the latter, who had gone with Martine to\nmarket, the doctor received a visit which filled him at first with a\nsort of terror. It was from the woman who had sold him the beautiful\ncorsage of old point d’Alencon, his first present to Clotilde. He felt\nhimself so weak against a possible temptation that he trembled. Even\nbefore the woman had uttered a word he had already begun to defend\nhimself–no, no, he neither could nor would buy anything. And with\noutstretched hands he prevented her from taking anything out of her\nlittle bag, declaring to himself that he would look at nothing. The\ndealer, however, a fat, amiable woman, smiled, certain of victory. In\nan insinuating voice she began to tell him a long story of how a lady,\nwhom she was not at liberty to name, one of the most distinguished\nladies in Plassans, who had suddenly met with a reverse of fortune,\nhad been obliged to part with one of her jewels; and she then enlarged\non the splendid chance–a piece of jewelry that had cost twelve\nhundred francs, and she was willing to let it go for five hundred. She\nopened her bag slowly, in spite of the terrified and ever-louder\nprotestations of the doctor, and took from it a slender gold necklace\nset simply with seven pearls in front; but the pearls were of\nwonderful brilliancy–flawless, and perfect in shape. The ornament was\nsimple, chaste, and of exquisite delicacy. And instantly he saw in\nfancy the necklace on Clotilde’s beautiful neck, as its natural\nadornment. Any other jewel would have been a useless ornament, these\npearls would be the fitting symbol of her youth. And he took the\nnecklace in his trembling fingers, experiencing a mortal anguish at\nthe idea of returning it. He defended himself still, however; he\ndeclared that he had not five hundred francs, while the dealer\ncontinued, in her smooth voice, to push the advantage she had gained.\nAfter another quarter an hour, when she thought she had him secure,\nshe suddenly offered him the necklace for three hundred francs, and he\nyielded; his mania for giving, his desire to please his idol, to adorn\nher, conquered. When he went to the desk to take the fifteen gold\npieces to count them out to the dealer, he felt convinced that the\nnotary’s affairs would be arranged, and that they would soon have\nplenty of money.",
        "When Pascal found himself once more alone, with the ornament in his\npocket, he was seized with a childish delight, and he planned his\nlittle surprise, while waiting, excited and impatient, for Clotilde’s\nreturn. The moment she made her appearance his heart began to beat\nviolently. She was very warm, for an August sun was blazing in the\nsky, and she laid aside her things quickly, pleased with her walk,\ntelling him, laughing, of the good bargain Martine had made–two\npigeons for eighteen sous. While she was speaking he pretended to\nnotice something on her neck.",
        "“Why, what have you on your neck? Let me see.”",
        "He had the necklace in his hand, and he succeeded in putting it around\nher neck, while feigning to pass his fingers over it, to assure\nhimself that there was nothing there. But she resisted, saying gaily:",
        "“Don’t! There is nothing on my neck. Here, what are you doing? What\nhave you in your hand that is tickling me?”",
        "He caught hold of her, and drew her before the long mirror, in which\nshe had a full view of herself. On her neck the slender chain showed\nlike a thread of gold, and the seven pearls, like seven milky stars,\nshone with soft luster against her satin skin. She looked charmingly\nchildlike. Suddenly she gave a delighted laugh, like the cooing of a\ndove swelling out its throat proudly.",
        "“Oh, master, master, how good you are! Do you think of nothing but me,\nthen? How happy you make me!”",
        "And the joy which shone in her eyes, the joy of the woman and the\nlover, happy to be beautiful and to be adored, recompensed him\ndivinely for his folly.",
        "She drew back her head, radiant, and held up her mouth to him. He bent\nover and kissed her.",
        "“Are you happy?”",
        "“Oh, yes, master, happy, happy! Pearls are so sweet, so pure! And\nthese are so becoming to me!”",
        "For an instant longer she admired herself in the glass, innocently\nvain of her fair flower-like skin, under the nacre drops of the\npearls. Then, yielding to a desire to show herself, hearing the\nservant moving about outside, she ran out, crying:",
        "“Martine, Martine! See what master has just given me! Say, am I not\nbeautiful!”",
        "But all at once, seeing the old maid’s severe face, that had suddenly\nturned an ashen hue, she became confused, and all her pleasure was\nspoiled. Perhaps she had a consciousness of the jealous pang which her\nbrilliant youth caused this poor creature, worn out in the dumb\nresignation of her servitude, in adoration of her master. This,\nhowever, was only a momentary feeling, unconscious in the one, hardly\nsuspected by the other, and what remained was the evident\ndisapprobation of the economical servant, condemning the present with\nher sidelong glance.",
        "Clotilde was seized with a little chill.",
        "“Only,” she murmured, “master has rummaged his desk again. Pearls are\nvery dear, are they not?”",
        "Pascal, embarrassed, too, protested volubly, telling them of the\nsplendid opportunity presented by the dealer’s visit. An incredibly\ngood stroke of business–it was impossible to avoid buying the\nnecklace.",
        "“How much?” asked the young girl with real anxiety.",
        "“Three hundred francs.”",
        "Martine, who had not yet opened her lips, but who looked terrible in\nher silence, could not restrain a cry.",
        "“Good God! enough to live upon for six weeks, and we have not bread!”",
        "Large tears welled from Clotilde’s eyes. She would have torn the\nnecklace from her neck if Pascal had not prevented her. She wished to\ngive it to him on the instant, and she faltered in heart-broken tones:",
        "“It is true, Martine is right. Master is mad, and I am mad, too, to\nkeep this for an instant, in the situation in which we are. It would\nburn my flesh. Let me take it back, I beg of you.”",
        "Never would he consent to this, he said. Now his eyes, too, were\nmoist, he joined in their grief, crying that he was incorrigible, that\nthey ought to have taken all the money away from him. And running to\nthe desk he took the hundred francs that were left, and forced Martine\nto take them, saying:",
        "“I tell you that I will not keep another sou. I should spend this,\ntoo. Take it, Martine; you are the only one of us who has any sense.\nYou will make the money last, I am very certain, until our affairs are\nsettled. And you, dear, keep that; do not grieve me.”",
        "Nothing more was said about this incident. But Clotilde kept the\nnecklace, wearing it under her gown; and there was a sort of\ndelightful mystery in feeling on her neck, unknown to every one, this\nsimple, pretty ornament. Sometimes, when they were alone, she would\nsmile at Pascal and draw the pearls from her dress quickly, and show\nthem to him without a word; and as quickly she would replace them\nagain on her warm neck, filled with delightful emotion. It was their\nfond folly which she thus recalled to him, with a confused gratitude,\na vivid and radiant joy–a joy which nevermore left her.",
        "A straitened existence, sweet in spite of everything, now began for\nthem. Martine made an exact inventory of the resources of the house,\nand it was not reassuring. The provision of potatoes only promised to\nbe of any importance. As ill luck would have it, the jar of oil was\nalmost out, and the last cask of wine was also nearly empty. La\nSouleiade, having neither vines nor olive trees, produced only a few\nvegetables and some fruits–pears, not yet ripe, and trellis grapes,\nwhich were to be their only delicacies. And meat and bread had to be\nbought every day. So that from the first day the servant put Pascal\nand Clotilde on rations, suppressing the former sweets, creams, and\npastry, and reducing the food to the quantity barely necessary to\nsustain life. She resumed all her former authority, treating them like\nchildren who were not to be consulted, even with regard to their\nwishes or their tastes. It was she who arranged the menus, who knew\nbetter than themselves what they wanted; but all this like a mother,\nsurrounding them with unceasing care, performing the miracle of\nenabling them to live still with comfort on their scanty resources;\noccasionally severe with them, for their own good, as one is severe\nwith a child when it refuses to eat its food. And it seemed as if this\nmaternal care, this last immolation, the illusory peace with which she\nsurrounded their love, gave her, too, a little happiness, and drew her\nout of the dumb despair into which she had fallen. Since she had thus\nwatched over them she had begun to look like her old self, with her\nlittle white face, the face of a nun vowed to chastity; her calm\nash-colored eyes, which expressed the resignation of her thirty years\nof servitude. When, after the eternal potatoes and the little cutlet at\nfour sous, undistinguishable among the vegetables, she was able, on\ncertain days, without compromising her budget, to give them pancakes,\nshe was triumphant, she laughed to see them laugh.",
        "Pascal and Clotilde thought everything she did was right, which did\nnot prevent them, however, from jesting about her when she was not\npresent. The old jests about her avarice were repeated over and over\nagain. They said that she counted the grains of pepper, so many grains\nfor each dish, in her passion for economy. When the potatoes had too\nlittle oil, when the cutlets were reduced to a mouthful, they would\nexchange a quick glance, stifling their laughter in their napkins,\nuntil she had left the room. Everything was a source of amusement to\nthem, and they laughed innocently at their misery.",
        "At the end of the first month Pascal thought of Martine’s wages.\nUsually she took her forty francs herself from the common purse which\nshe kept.",
        "“My poor girl,” he said to her one evening, “what are you going to do\nfor your wages, now that we have no more money?”",
        "She remained for a moment with her eyes fixed on the ground, with an\nair of consternation, then she said:",
        "“Well, monsieur, I must only wait.”",
        "But he saw that she had not said all that was in her mind, that she\nhad thought of some arrangement which she did not know how to propose\nto him, so he encouraged her.",
        "“Well, then, if monsieur would consent to it, I should like monsieur\nto sign me a paper.”",
        "“How, a paper?”",
        "“Yes, a paper, in which monsieur should say, every month, that he owes\nme forty francs.”",
        "Pascal at once made out the paper for her, and this made her quite\nhappy. She put it away as carefully as if it had been real money. This\nevidently tranquilized her. But the paper became a new subject of\nwondering amusement to the doctor and his companion. In what did the\nextraordinary power consist which money has on certain natures? This\nold maid, who would serve him on bended knees, who adored him above\neverything, to the extent of having devoted to him her whole life, to\nask for this silly guarantee, this scrap of paper which was of no\nvalue, if he should be unable to pay her.",
        "So far neither Pascal nor Clotilde had any great merit in preserving\ntheir serenity in misfortune, for they did not feel it. They lived\nhigh above it, in the rich and happy realm of their love. At table\nthey did not know what they were eating; they might fancy they were\npartaking of a princely banquet, served on silver dishes. They were\nunconscious of the increasing destitution around them, of the hunger\nof the servant who lived upon the crumbs from their table; and they\nwalked through the empty house as through a palace hung with silk and\nfilled with riches. This was undoubtedly the happiest period of their\nlove. The workroom had pleasant memories of the past, and they spent\nwhole days there, wrapped luxuriously in the joy of having lived so\nlong in it together. Then, out of doors, in every corner of La\nSouleiade, royal summer had set up his blue tent, dazzling with gold.\nIn the morning, in the embalsamed walks on the pine grove; at noon\nunder the dark shadow of the plane trees, lulled by the murmur of the\nfountain; in the evening on the cool terrace, or in the still warm\nthreshing yard bathed in the faint blue radiance of the first stars,\nthey lived with rapture their straitened life, their only ambition to\nlive always together, indifferent to all else. The earth was theirs,\nwith all its riches, its pomps, and its dominions, since they loved\neach other.",
        "Toward the end of August however, matters grew bad again. At times\nthey had rude awakenings, in the midst of this life without ties,\nwithout duties, without work; this life which was so sweet, but which\nit would be impossible, hurtful, they knew, to lead always. One\nevening Martine told them that she had only fifty francs left, and\nthat they would have difficulty in managing for two weeks longer, even\ngiving up wine. In addition to this the news was very serious; the\nnotary Grandguillot was beyond a doubt insolvent, so that not even the\npersonal creditors would receive anything. In the beginning they had\nrelied on the house and the two farms which the fugitive notary had\nleft perforce behind him, but it was now certain that this property\nwas in his wife’s name and, while he was enjoying in Switzerland, as\nit was said, the beauty of the mountains, she lived on one of the\nfarms, which she cultivated quietly, away from the annoyances of the\nliquidation. In short, it was infamous–a hundred families ruined;\nleft without bread. An assignee had indeed been appointed, but he had\nserved only to confirm the disaster, since not a centime of assets had\nbeen discovered. And Pascal, with his usual indifference, neglected\neven to go and see him to speak to him about his own case, thinking\nthat he already knew all that there was to be known about it, and that\nit was useless to stir up this ugly business, since there was neither\nhonor nor profit to be derived from it.",
        "Then, indeed, the future looked threatening at La Souleiade. Black\nwant stared them in the face. And Clotilde, who, in reality, had a\ngreat deal of good sense, was the first to take alarm. She maintained\nher cheerfulness while Pascal was present, but, more prescient than\nhe, in her womanly tenderness, she fell into a state of absolute\nterror if he left her for an instant, asking herself what was to\nbecome of him at his age with so heavy a burden upon his shoulders.\nFor several days she cherished in secret a project–to work and earn\nmoney, a great deal of money, with her pastels. People had so often\npraised her extraordinary and original talent that, taking Martine\ninto her confidence, she sent her one fine morning to offer some of\nher fantastic bouquets to the color dealer of the Cours Sauvaire, who\nwas a relation, it was said, of a Parisian artist. It was with the\nexpress condition that nothing was to be exhibited in Plassans, that\neverything was to be sent to a distance. But the result was\ndisastrous; the merchant was frightened by the strangeness of the\ndesign, and by the fantastic boldness of the execution, and he\ndeclared that they would never sell. This threw her into despair;\ngreat tears welled her eyes. Of what use was she? It was a grief and a\nhumiliation to be good for nothing. And the servant was obliged to\nconsole her, saying that no doubt all women were not born for work;\nthat some grew like the flowers in the gardens, for the sake of their\nfragrance; while others were the wheat of the fields that is ground up\nand used for food.",
        "Martine, meantime, cherished another project; it was to urge the\ndoctor to resume his practise. At last she mentioned it to Clotilde,\nwho at once pointed out to her the difficulty, the impossibility\nalmost, of such an attempt. She and Pascal had been talking about his\ndoing so only the day before. He, too, was anxious, and had thought of\nwork as the only chance of salvation. The idea of opening an office\nagain was naturally the first that had presented itself to him. But he\nhad been for so long a time the physician of the poor! How could he\nventure now to ask payment when it was so many years since he had left\noff doing so? Besides, was it not too late, at his age, to recommence\na career? not to speak of the absurd rumors that had been circulating\nabout him, the name which they had given him of a crack-brained\ngenius. He would not find a single patient now, it would be a useless\ncruelty to force him to make an attempt which would assuredly result\nonly in a lacerated heart and empty hands. Clotilde, on the contrary,\nhad used all her influence to turn him from the idea. Martine\ncomprehended the reasonableness of these objections, and she too\ndeclared that he must be prevented from running the risk of so great a\nchagrin. But while she was speaking a new idea occurred to her, as she\nsuddenly remembered an old register, which she had met with in a\npress, and in which she had in former times entered the doctor’s\nvisits. For a long time it was she who had kept the accounts. There\nwere so many patients who had never paid that a list of them filled\nthree of the large pages of the register. Why, then, now that they had\nfallen into misfortune, should they not ask from these people the\nmoney which they justly owed? It might be done without saying anything\nto monsieur, who had never been willing to appeal to the law. And this\ntime Clotilde approved of her idea. It was a perfect conspiracy.\nClotilde consulted the register, and made out the bills, and the\nservant presented them. But nowhere did she receive a sou; they told\nher at every door that they would look over the account; that they\nwould stop in and see the doctor himself. Ten days passed, no one\ncame, and there were now only six francs in the house, barely enough\nto live upon for two or three days longer.",
        "Martine, when she returned with empty hands on the following day from\na new application to an old patient, took Clotilde aside and told her\nthat she had just been talking with Mme. Felicite at the corner of the\nRue de la Banne. The latter had undoubtedly been watching for her. She\nhad not again set foot in La Souleiade. Not even the misfortune which\nhad befallen her son–the sudden loss of his money, of which the whole\ntown was talking–had brought her to him; she still continued stern\nand indignant. But she waited in trembling excitement, she maintained\nher attitude as an offended mother only in the certainty that she\nwould at last have Pascal at her feet, shrewdly calculating that he\nwould sooner or later be compelled to appeal to her for assistance.\nWhen he had not a sou left, when he knocked at her door, then she\nwould dictate her terms; he should marry Clotilde, or, better still,\nshe would demand the departure of the latter. But the days passed, and\nhe did not come. And this was why she had stopped Martine, assuming a\npitying air, asking what news there was, and seeming to be surprised\nthat they had not had recourse to her purse, while giving it to be\nunderstood that her dignity forbade her to take the first step.",
        "“You should speak to monsieur, and persuade him,” ended the servant.\nAnd indeed, why should he not appeal to his mother? That would be\nentirely natural.",
        "“Oh! never would I undertake such a commission,” cried Clotilde.\n\"Master would be angry, and with reason. I truly believe he would die\nof starvation before he would eat grandmother’s bread.”",
        "But on the evening of the second day after this, at dinner, as Martine\nwas putting on the table a piece of boiled beef left over from the day\nbefore, she gave them notice.",
        "“I have no more money, monsieur, and to-morrow there will be only\npotatoes, without oil or butter. It is three weeks now that you have\nhad only water to drink; now you will have to do without meat.”",
        "They were still cheerful, they could still jest.",
        "“Have you salt, my good girl?”",
        "“Oh, that; yes, monsieur, there is still a little left.”",
        "“Well, potatoes and salt are very good when one is hungry.”",
        "That night, however, Pascal noticed that Clotilde was feverish; this\nwas the hour in which they exchanged confidences, and she ventured to\ntell him of her anxiety on his account, on her own, on that of the\nwhole house. What was going to become of them when all their resources\nshould be exhausted? For a moment she thought of speaking to him of\nhis mother. But she was afraid, and she contented herself with\nconfessing to him what she and Martine had done–the old register\nexamined, the bills made out and sent, the money asked everywhere in\nvain. In other circumstances he would have been greatly annoyed and\nvery angry at this confession; offended that they should have acted\nwithout his knowledge, and contrary to the attitude he had maintained\nduring his whole professional life. He remained for a long tine\nsilent, strongly agitated, and this would have sufficed to prove how\ngreat must be his secret anguish at times, under his apparent\nindifference to poverty. Then he forgave Clotilde, clasping her wildly\nto his breast, and finally he said that she had done right, that they\ncould not continue to live much longer as they were living, in a\ndestitution which increased every day. Then they fell into silence,\neach trying to think of a means of procuring the money necessary for\ntheir daily wants, each suffering keenly; she, desperate at the\nthought of the tortures that awaited him; he unable to accustom\nhimself to the idea of seeing her wanting bread. Was their happiness\nforever ended, then? Was poverty going to blight their spring with its\nchill breath?",
        "At breakfast, on the following day, they ate only fruit. The doctor\nwas very silent during the morning, a prey to a visible struggle. And\nit was not until three o’clock that he took a resolution.",
        "“Come, we must stir ourselves,” he said to his companion. “I do not\nwish you to fast this evening again; so put on your hat, we will go\nout together.”",
        "She looked at him, waiting for an explanation.",
        "“Yes, since they owe us money, and have refused to give it to you, I\nwill see whether they will also refuse to give it to me.”",
        "His hands trembled; the thought of demanding payment in this way,\nafter so many years, evidently made him suffer terribly; but he forced\na smile, he affected to be very brave. And she, who knew from the\ntrembling of his voice the extent of his sacrifice, had tears in her\neyes.",
        "“No, no, master; don’t go if it makes you suffer so much. Martine can\ngo again.”",
        "But the servant, who was present, approved highly of monsieur’s\nintention.",
        "“And why should not monsieur go? There’s no shame in asking what is\nowed to one, is there? Every one should have his own; for my part, I\nthink it quite right that monsieur should show at last that he is a\nman.”",
        "Then, as before, in their hours of happiness, old King David, as\nPascal jestingly called himself, left the house, leaning on Abishag’s\narm. Neither of them was yet in rags; he still wore his tightly\nbuttoned overcoat; she had on her pretty linen gown with red spots,\nbut doubtless the consciousness of their poverty lowered them in their\nown estimation, making them feel that they were now only two poor\npeople who occupied a very insignificant place in the world, for they\nwalked along by the houses, shunning observation. The sunny streets\nwere almost deserted. A few curious glances embarrassed them. They did\nnot hasten their steps, however; only their hearts were oppressed at\nthe thought of the visits they were about to make.",
        "Pascal resolved to begin with an old magistrate whom he had treated\nfor an affection of the liver. He entered the house, leaving Clotilde\nsitting on the bench in the Cours Sauvaire. But he was greatly\nrelieved when the magistrate, anticipating his demand, told him that\nhe did not receive his rents until October, and that he would pay him\nthen. At the house of an old lady of seventy, a paralytic, the rebuff\nwas of a different kind. She was offended because her account had been\nsent to her through a servant who had been impolite; so that he\nhastened to offer her his excuses, giving her all the time she\ndesired. Then he climbed up three flights of stairs to the apartment\nof a clerk in the tax collector’s office, whom he found still ill, and\nso poor that he did not even venture to make his demand. Then followed\na mercer, a lawyer’s wife, an oil merchant, a baker–all well-to-do\npeople; and all turned him away, some with excuses, others by denying\nhim admittance; a few even pretended not to know what he meant. There\nremained the Marquise de Valqueyras, the sole representative of a very\nancient family, a widow with a girl of ten, who was very rich, and\nwhose avarice was notorious. He had left her for the last, for he was\ngreatly afraid of her. Finally he knocked at the door of her ancient\nmansion, at the foot of the Cours Sauvaire, a massive structure of the\ntime of Mazarin. He remained so long in the house that Clotilde, who\nwas walking under the trees, at last became uneasy.",
        "When he finally made his appearance, at the end of a full half hour,\nshe said jestingly, greatly relieved:",
        "“Why, what was the matter? Had she no money?”",
        "But here, too, he had been unsuccessful; she complained that her\ntenants did not pay her.",
        "“Imagine,” he continued, in explanation of his long absence, “the\nlittle girl is ill. I am afraid that it is the beginning of a gastric\nfever. So she wished me to see the child, and I examined her.”",
        "A smile which she could not suppress came to Clotilde’s lips.",
        "“And you prescribed for her?”",
        "“Of course; could I do otherwise?”",
        "She took his arm again, deeply affected, and he felt her press it\nagainst her heart. For a time they walked on aimlessly. It was all\nover; they had knocked at every debtor’s door, and nothing now\nremained for them to do but to return home with empty hands. But this\nPascal refused to do, determined that Clotilde should have something\nmore than the potatoes and water which awaited them. When they\nascended the Cours Sauvaire, they turned to the left, to the new town;\ndrifting now whither cruel fate led them.",
        "“Listen,” said Pascal at last; “I have an idea. If I were to speak to\nRamond he would willingly lend us a thousand francs, which we could\nreturn to him when our affairs are arranged.”",
        "She did not answer at once. Ramond, whom she had rejected, who was now\nmarried and settled in a house in the new town, in a fair way to\nbecome the fashionable physician of the place, and to make a fortune!\nShe knew, indeed, that he had a magnanimous soul and a kind heart. If\nhe had not visited them again it had been undoubtedly through\ndelicacy. Whenever they chanced to meet, he saluted them with so\nadmiring an air, he seemed so pleased to see their happiness.",
        "“Would that be disagreeable to you?” asked Pascal ingenuously. For his\npart, he would have thrown open to the young physician his house, his\npurse, and his heart.",
        "“No, no,” she answered quickly. “There has never been anything between\nus but affection and frankness. I think I gave him a great deal of\npain, but he has forgiven me. You are right; we have no other friend.\nIt is to Ramond that we must apply.”",
        "Ill luck pursued them, however. Ramond was absent from home, attending\na consultation at Marseilles, and he would not be back until the\nfollowing evening. And it young Mme. Ramond, an old friend of\nClotilde’s, some three years her junior, who received them. She seemed\na little embarrassed, but she was very amiable, notwithstanding. But\nthe doctor, naturally, did not prefer his request, and contented\nhimself with saying, in explanation of his visit, that he had missed\nRamond. When they were in the street again, Pascal and Clotilde felt\nthemselves once more abandoned and alone. Where now should they turn?\nWhat new effort should they make? And they walked on again aimlessly.",
        "“I did not tell you, master,” Clotilde at last ventured to murmur,\n\"but it seems that Martine met grandmother the other day. Yes,\ngrandmother has been uneasy about us. She asked Martine why we did not\ngo to her, if we were in want. And see, here is her house.”",
        "They were in fact, in the Rue de la Banne. They could see the corner\nof the Place de la Sous-Prefecture. But he at once silenced her.",
        "“Never, do you hear! Nor shall you go either. You say that because it\ngrieves you to see me in this poverty. My heart, too, is heavy, to\nthink that you also are in want, that you also suffer. But it is\nbetter to suffer than to do a thing that would leave one an eternal\nremorse. I will not. I cannot.”",
        "They emerged from the Rue de la Banne, and entered the old quarter.",
        "“I would a thousand times rather apply to a stranger. Perhaps we still\nhave friends, even if they are only among the poor.”",
        "And resolved to beg, David continued his walk, leaning on the arm of\nAbishag; the old mendicant king went from door to door, leaning on the\nshoulder of the loving subject whose youth was now his only support.\nIt was almost six o’clock; the heat had abated; the narrow streets\nwere filling with people; and in this populous quarter where they were\nloved, they were everywhere greeted with smiles. Something of pity was\nmingled with the admiration they awakened, for every one knew of their\nruin. But they seemed of a nobler beauty than before, he all white,\nshe all blond, pressing close to each other in their misfortune. They\nseemed more united, more one with each other than ever; holding their\nheads erect, proud of their glorious love, though touched by\nmisfortune; he shaken, while she, with a courageous heart, sustained\nhim. And in spite of the poverty that had so suddenly overtaken them\nthey walked without shame, very poor and very great, with the\nsorrowful smile under which they concealed the desolation of their\nsouls. Workmen in dirty blouses passed them by, who had more money in\ntheir pockets than they. No one ventured to offer them the sou which\nis not refused to those who are hungry. At the Rue Canoquin they\nstopped at the house of Gulraude. She had died the week before. Two\nother attempts which they made failed. They were reduced now to\nconsider where they could borrow ten francs. They had been walking\nabout the town for three hours, but they could not resolve to go home\nempty-handed.",
        "Ah, this Plassans, with its Cours Sauvaire, its Rue de Rome, and its\nRue de la Banne, dividing it into three quarters; this Plassans; with\nits windows always closed, this sun-baked town, dead in appearance,\nbut which concealed under this sleeping surface a whole nocturnal life\nof the clubhouse and the gaming table. They walked through it three\ntimes more with slackened pace, on this clear, calm close of a glowing\nAugust day. In the yard of the coach office a few old stage-coaches,\nwhich still plied between the town and the mountain villages, were\nstanding unharnessed; and under the thick shade of the plane trees at\nthe doors of the cafes, the customers, who were to be seen from seven\no’clock in the morning, looked after them smiling. In the new town,\ntoo, the servants came and stood at the doors of the wealthy houses;\nthey met with less sympathy here than in the deserted streets of the\nQuartier St. Marc, whose antique houses maintained a friendly silence.\nThey returned to the heart of the old quarter where they were most\nliked; they went as far as St. Saturnin, the cathedral, whose apse was\nshaded by the garden of the chapter, a sweet and peaceful solitude,\nfrom which a beggar drove them by himself asking an alms from them.\nThey were building rapidly in the neighborhood of the railway station;\na new quarter was growing up there, and they bent their steps in that\ndirection. Then they returned a last time to the Place de la\nSous-Prefecture, with a sudden reawakening of hope, thinking that they\nmight meet some one who would offer them money. But they were followed\nonly by the indulgent smile of the town, at seeing them so united and\nso beautiful. Only one woman had tears in her eyes, foreseeing,\nperhaps, the sufferings that awaited them. The stones of the Viorne,\nthe little sharp paving stones, wounded their feet. And they had at\nlast to return to La Souleiade, without having succeeded in obtaining\nanything, the old mendicant king and his submissive subject; Abishag,\nin the flower of her youth, leading back David, old and despoiled of\nhis wealth, and weary from having walked the streets in vain.",
        "It was eight o’clock, and Martine, who was waiting for them,\ncomprehended that she would have no cooking to do this evening. She\npretended that she had dined, and as she looked ill Pascal sent her at\nonce to bed.",
        "“We do not need you,” said Clotilde. “As the potatoes are on the fire\nwe can take them up very well ourselves.”",
        "The servant, who was feverish and out of humor, yielded. She muttered\nsome indistinct words–when people had eaten up everything what was\nthe use of sitting down to table? Then, before shutting herself into\nher room, she added:",
        "“Monsieur, there is no more hay for Bonhomme. I thought he was looking\nbadly a little while ago; monsieur ought to go and see him.”",
        "Pascal and Clotilde, filled with uneasiness, went to the stable. The\nold horse was, in fact, lying on the straw in the somnolence of\nexpiring old age. They had not taken him out for six months past, for\nhis legs, stiff with rheumatism, refused to support him, and he had\nbecome completely blind. No one could understand why the doctor kept\nthe old beast. Even Martine had at last said that he ought to be\nslaughtered, if only through pity. But Pascal and Clotilde cried out\nat this, as much excited as if it had been proposed to them to put an\nend to some aged relative who was not dying fast enough. No, no, he\nhad served them for more than a quarter of a century; he should die\ncomfortably with them, like the worthy fellow he had always been. And\nto-night the doctor did not scorn to examine him, as if he had never\nattended any other patients than animals. He lifted up his hoofs,\nlooked at his gums, and listened to the beating of his heart.",
        "“No, there is nothing the matter with him,” he said at last. “It is\nsimply old age. Ah, my poor old fellow, I think, indeed, we shall\nnever again travel the roads together.”",
        "The idea that there was no more hay distressed Clotilde. But Pascal\nreassured her–an animal of that age, that no longer moved about,\nneeded so little. She stooped down and took a few handfuls of grass\nfrom a heap which the servant had left there, and both were rejoiced\nwhen Bonhomme deigned, solely and simply through friendship, as it\nseemed, to eat the grass out of her hand.",
        "“Oh,” she said, laughing, “so you still have an appetite! You cannot\nbe very sick, then; you must not try to work upon our feelings. Good\nnight, and sleep well.”",
        "And they left him to his slumbers after having each given him, as\nusual, a hearty kiss on either side of his nose.",
        "Night fell, and an idea occurred to them, in order not to remain\ndownstairs in the empty house–to close up everything and eat their\ndinner upstairs. Clotilde quickly took up the dish of potatoes, the\nsalt-cellar, and a fine decanter of water; while Pascal took charge of\na basket of grapes, the first which they had yet gathered from an\nearly vine at the foot of the terrace. They closed the door, and laid\nthe cloth on a little table, putting the potatoes in the middle\nbetween the salt-cellar and the decanter, and the basket of grapes on\na chair beside them. And it was a wonderful feast, which reminded them\nof the delicious breakfast they had made on the morning on which\nMartine had obstinately shut herself up in her room, and refused to\nanswer them. They experienced the same delight as then at being alone,\nat waiting upon themselves, at eating from the same plate, sitting\nclose beside each other. This evening, which they had anticipated with\nso much dread, had in store for them the most delightful hours of\ntheir existence. As soon as they found themselves at home in the large\nfriendly room, as far removed from the town which they had just been\nscouring as if they had been a hundred leagues away from it, all\nuneasiness and all sadness vanished–even to the recollection of the\nwretched afternoon wasted in useless wanderings. They were once more\nindifferent to all that was not their affection; they no longer\nremembered that they had lost their fortune; that they might have to\nhunt up a friend on the morrow in order to be able to dine in the\nevening. Why torture themselves with fears of coming want, when all\nthey required to enjoy the greatest possible happiness was to be\ntogether?",
        "But Pascal felt a sudden terror.",
        "“My God! and we dreaded this evening so greatly! Is it wise to be\nhappy in this way? Who knows what to-morrow may have in store for us?”",
        "But she put her little hand over his mouth; she desired that he should\nhave one more evening of perfect happiness.",
        "“No, no; to-morrow we shall love each other as we love each other\nto-day. Love me with all your strength, as I love you.”",
        "And never had they eaten with more relish. She displayed the appetite\nof a healthy young girl with a good digestion; she ate the potatoes\nwith a hearty appetite, laughing, thinking them delicious, better than\nthe most vaunted delicacies. He, too, recovered the appetite of his\nyouthful days. They drank with delight deep draughts of pure water.\nThen the grapes for dessert filled them with admiration; these grapes\nso fresh, this blood of the earth which the sun had touched with gold.\nThey ate to excess; they became drunk on water and fruit, and more\nthan all on gaiety. They did not remember ever before to have enjoyed\nsuch a feast together; even the famous breakfast they had made, with\nits luxuries of cutlets and bread and wine, had not given them this\nintoxication, this joy in living, when to be together was happiness\nenough, changing the china to dishes of gold, and the miserable food\nto celestial fare such as not even the gods enjoyed.",
        "It was now quite dark, but they did not light the lamp. Through the\nwide open windows they could see the vast summer sky. The night breeze\nentered, still warm and laden with a faint odor of lavender. The moon\nhad just risen above the horizon, large and round, flooding the room\nwith a silvery light, in which they saw each other as in a dream light\ninfinitely bright and sweet.",
        "But on the following day their disquietude all returned. They were now\nobliged to go in debt. Martine obtained on credit bread, wine, and a\nlittle meat, much to her shame, be it said, forced as she was to\nmaneuver and tell lies, for no one was ignorant of the ruin that had\novertaken the house. The doctor had indeed thought of mortgaging La\nSouleiade, but only as a last resource. All he now possessed was this\nproperty, which was worth twenty thousand francs, but for which he\nwould perhaps not get fifteen thousand, if he should sell it; and when\nthese should be spent black want would be before them, the street,\nwithout even a stone of their own on which to lay their heads.\nClotilde therefore begged Pascal to wait and not to take any\nirrevocable step so long as things were not utterly desperate.",
        "Three or four days passed. It was the beginning of September, and the\nweather unfortunately changed; terrible storms ravaged the entire\ncountry; a part of the garden wall was blown down, and as Pascal was\nunable to rebuild it, the yawning breach remained. Already they were\nbeginning to be rude at the baker’s. And one morning the old servant\ncame home with the meat from the butcher’s in tears, saying that he\nhad given her the refuse. A few days more and they would be unable to\nobtain anything on credit. It had become absolutely necessary to\nconsider how they should find the money for their small daily\nexpenses.",
        "One Monday morning, the beginning of another week of torture, Clotilde\nwas very restless. A struggle seemed to be going on within her, and it\nwas only when she saw Pascal refuse at breakfast his share of a piece\nof beef which had been left over from the day before that she at last\ncame to a decision. Then with a calm and resolute air, she went out\nafter breakfast with Martine, after quietly putting into the basket of\nthe latter a little package–some articles of dress which she was\ngiving her, she said.",
        "When she returned two hours later she was very pale. But her large\neyes, so clear and frank, were shining. She went up to the doctor at\nonce and made her confession.",
        "“I must ask your forgiveness, master, for I have just been disobeying\nyou, and I know that I am going to pain you greatly.”",
        "“Why, what have you been doing?” he asked uneasily, not understanding\nwhat she meant.",
        "Slowly, without removing her eyes from him, she drew from her pocket\nan envelope, from which she took some bank-notes. A sudden intuition\nenlightened him, and he cried:",
        "“Ah, my God! the jewels, the presents I gave you!”",
        "And he, who was usually so good-tempered and gentle, was convulsed\nwith grief and anger. He seized her hands in his, crushing with almost\nbrutal force the fingers which held the notes.",
        "“My God! what have you done, unhappy girl? It is my heart that you\nhave sold, both our hearts, that had entered into those jewels, which\nyou have given with them for money! The jewels which I gave you, the\nsouyenirs of our divinest hours, your property, yours only, how can\nyou wish me to take them back, to turn them to my profit? Can it be\npossible–have you thought of the anguish that this would give me?”",
        "“And you, master,” she answered gently, “do you think that I could\nconsent to our remaining in the unhappy situation in which we are, in\nwant of everything, while I had these rings and necklaces and earrings\nlaid away in the bottom of a drawer? Why, my whole being would rise in\nprotest. I should think myself a miser, a selfish wretch, if I had\nkept them any longer. And, although it was a grief for me to part with\nthem–ah, yes, I confess it, so great a grief that I could hardly find\nthe courage to do it–I am certain that I have only done what I ought\nto have done as an obedient and loving woman.”",
        "And as he still grasped her hands, tears came to her eyes, and she\nadded in the same gentle voice and with a faint smile:",
        "“Don’t press so hard; you hurt me.”",
        "Then repentant and deeply moved, Pascal, too, wept.",
        "“I am a brute to get angry in this way. You acted rightly; you could\nnot do otherwise. But forgive me; it was hard for me to see you\ndespoil yourself. Give me your hands, your poor hands, and let me kiss\naway the marks of my stupid violence.”",
        "He took her hands again in his tenderly; he covered them with kisses;\nhe thought them inestimably precious, so delicate and bare, thus\nstripped of their rings. Consoled now, and joyous, she told him of her\nescapade–how she had taken Martine into her confidence, and how both\nhad gone to the dealer who had sold him the corsage of point\nd’Alencon, and how after interminable examining and bargaining the\nwoman had given six thousand francs for all the jewels. Again he\nrepressed a gesture of despair–six thousand francs! when the jewels\nhad cost him more than three times that amount–twenty thousand francs\nat the very least.",
        "“Listen,” he said to her at last; “I will take this money, since, in\nthe goodness of your heart, you have brought it to me. But it is\nclearly understood that it is yours. I swear to you that I will, for\nthe future, be more miserly than Martine herself. I will give her only\nthe few sous that are absolutely necessary for our maintenance, and\nyou will find in the desk all that may be left of this sum, if I\nshould never be able to complete it and give it back to you entire.”",
        "He clasped her in an embrace that still trembled with emotion.\nPresently, lowering his voice to a whisper, he said:",
        "“And did you sell everything, absolutely everything?”",
        "Without speaking, she disengaged herself a little from his embrace,\nand put her fingers to her throat, with her pretty gesture, smiling\nand blushing. Finally, she drew out the slender chain on which shone\nthe seven pearls, like milky stars. Then she put it back again out of\nsight.",
        "He, too, blushed, and a great joy filled his heart. He embraced her\npassionately.",
        "“Ah!” he cried, “how good you are, and how I love you!”",
        "But from this time forth the recollection of the jewels which had been\nsold rested like a weight upon his heart; and he could not look at the\nmoney in his desk without pain. He was haunted by the thought of\napproaching want, inevitable want, and by a still more bitter thought\n–the thought of his age, of his sixty years which rendered him\nuseless, incapable of earning a comfortable living for a wife; he had\nbeen suddenly and rudely awakened from his illusory dream of eternal\nlove to the disquieting reality. He had fallen unexpectedly into\npoverty, and he felt himself very old–this terrified him and filled\nhim with a sort of remorse, of desperate rage against himself, as if\nhe had been guilty of a crime. And this embittered his every hour; if\nthrough momentary forgetfulness he permitted himself to indulge in a\nlittle gaiety his distress soon returned with greater poignancy than\never, bringing with it a sudden and inexplicable sadness. He did not\ndare to question himself, and his dissatisfaction with himself and his\nsuffering increased every day.",
        "Then a frightful revelation came to him. One morning, when he was\nalone, he received a letter bearing the Plassans postmark, the\nsuperscription on which he examined with surprise, not recognizing the\nwriting. This letter was not signed; and after reading a few lines he\nmade an angry movement as if to tear it up and throw it away; but he\nsat down trembling instead, and read it to the end. The style was\nperfectly courteous; the long phrases rolled on, measured and\ncarefully worded, like diplomatic phrases, whose only aim is to\nconvince. It was demonstrated to him with a superabundance of\narguments that the scandal of La Souleiade had lasted too long\nalready. If passion, up to a certain point, explained the fault, yet a\nman of his age and in his situation was rendering himself contemptible\nby persisting in wrecking the happiness of the young relative whose\ntrustfulness he abused. No one was ignorant of the ascendency which he\nhad acquired over her; it was admitted that she gloried in sacrificing\nherself for him; but ought he not, on his side, to comprehend that it\nwas impossible that she should love an old man, that what she felt was\nmerely pity and gratitude, and that it was high time to deliver her\nfrom this senile love, which would finally leave her with a dishonored\nname! Since he could not even assure her a small fortune, the writer\nhoped he would act like an honorable man, and have the strength to\nseparate from her, through consideration for her happiness, if it were\nnot yet too late. And the letter concluded with the reflection that\nevil conduct was always punished in the end.",
        "From the first sentence Pascal felt that this anonymous letter came\nfrom his mother. Old Mme. Rougon must have dictated it; he could hear\nin it the very inflections of her voice. But after having begun the\nletter angry and indignant, he finished it pale and trembling, seized\nby the shiver which now passed through him continually and without\napparent cause. The letter was right, it enlightened him cruelly\nregarding the source of his mental distress, showing him that it was\nremorse for keeping Clotilde with him, old and poor as he was. He got\nup and walked over to a mirror, before which he stood for a long time,\nhis eyes gradually filling with tears of despair at sight of his\nwrinkles and his white beard. The feeling of terror which arose within\nhim, the mortal chill which invaded his heart, was caused by the\nthought that separation had become necessary, inevitable. He repelled\nthe thought, he felt that he would never have the strength for a\nseparation, but it still returned; he would never now pass a single\nday without being assailed by it, without being torn by the struggle\nbetween his love and his reason until the terrible day when he should\nbecome resigned, his strength and his tears exhausted. In his present\nweakness, he trembled merely at the thought of one day having this\ncourage. And all was indeed over, the irrevocable had begun; he was\nfilled with fear for Clotilde, so young and so beautiful, and all\nthere was left him now was the duty of saving her from himself.",
        "Then, haunted by every word, by every phrase of the letter, he\ntortured himself at first by trying to persuade himself that she did\nnot love him, that all she felt for him was pity and gratitude. It\nwould make the rupture more easy to him, he thought, if he were once\nconvinced that she sacrificed herself, and that in keeping her with\nhim longer he was only gratifying his monstrous selfishness. But it\nwas in vain that he studied her, that he subjected her to proofs, she\nremained as tender and devoted as ever, making the dreaded decision\nstill more difficult. Then he pondered over all the causes that\nvaguely, but ceaselessly urged their separation. The life which they\nhad been leading for months past, this life without ties or duties,\nwithout work of any sort, was not good. He thought no longer of\nhimself, he considered himself good for nothing now but to go away and\nbury himself out of sight in some remote corner; but for her was it\nnot an injurious life, a life which would deteriorate her character\nand weaken her will? And suddenly he saw himself in fancy dying,\nleaving her alone to perish of hunger in the streets. No, no! this\nwould be a crime; he could not, for the sake of the happiness of his\nfew remaining days, bequeath to her this heritage of shame and misery.",
        "One morning Clotilde went for a walk in the neighborhood, from which\nshe returned greatly agitated, pale and trembling, and as soon as she\nwas upstairs in the workroom, she almost fainted in Pascal’s arms,\nfaltering:",
        "“Oh, my God! oh, my God! those women!”",
        "Terrified, he pressed her with questions.",
        "“Come, tell me! What has happened?”",
        "A flush mounted to her face. She flung her arms around his neck and\nhid her head on his shoulder.",
        "“It was those women! Reaching a shady spot, I was closing my parasol,\nand I had the misfortune to throw down a child. And they all rose\nagainst me, crying out such things, oh, such things–things that I\ncannot repeat, that I could not understand!”",
        "She burst into sobs. He was livid; he could find nothing to say to\nher; he kissed her wildly, weeping like herself. He pictured to\nhimself the whole scene; he saw her pursued, hooted at, reviled.\nPresently he faltered:",
        "“It is my fault, it is through me you suffer. Listen, we will go away\nfrom here, far, far away, where we shall not be known, where you will\nbe honored, where you will be happy.”",
        "But seeing him weep, she recovered her calmness by a violent effort.\nAnd drying her tears, she said:",
        "“Ah! I have behaved like a coward in telling you all this. After\npromising myself that I would say nothing of it to you. But when I\nfound myself at home again, my anguish was so great that it all came\nout. But you see now it is all over, don’t grieve about it. I love\nyou.”",
        "She smiled, and putting her arms about him she kissed him in her turn,\ntrying to soothe his despair.",
        "“I love you. I love you so dearly that it will console me for\neverything. There is only you in the world, what matters anything that\nis not you? You are so good; you make me so happy!”",
        "But he continued to weep, and she, too, began to weep again, and there\nwas a moment of infinite sadness, of anguish, in which they mingled\ntheir kisses and their tears.",
        "Pascal, when she left him alone for an instant, thought himself a\nwretch. He could no longer be the cause of misfortune to this child,\nwhom he adored. And on the evening of the same day an event took place\nwhich brought about the solution hitherto sought in vain, with the\nfear of finding it. After dinner Martine beckoned him aside, and gave\nhim a letter, with all sorts of precautions, saying:",
        "“I met Mme. Felicite, and she charged me to give you this letter,\nmonsieur, and she told me to tell you that she would have brought it\nto you herself, only that regard for her reputation prevented her from\nreturning here. She begs you to send her back M. Maxime’s letter,\nletting her know mademoiselle’s answer.”",
        "It was, in fact, a letter from Maxime, and Mme. Felicite, glad to have\nreceived it, used it as a new means of conquering her son, after\nhaving waited in vain for misery to deliver him up to her, repentant\nand imploring. As neither Pascal nor Clotilde had come to demand aid\nor succor from her, she had once more changed her plan, returning to\nher old idea of separating them; and, this time, the opportunity\nseemed to her decisive. Maxime’s letter was a pressing one; he urged\nhis grandmother to plead his cause with his sister. Ataxia had\ndeclared itself; he was able to walk now only leaning on his servant’s\narm. His solitude terrified him, and he urgently entreated his sister\nto come to him. He wished to have her with him as a rampart against\nhis father’s abominable designs; as a sweet and upright woman after\nall, who would take care of him. The letter gave it to be understood\nthat if she conducted herself well toward him she would have no reason\nto repent it; and ended by reminding the young girl of the promise she\nhad made him, at the time of his visit to Plassans, to come to him, if\nthe day ever arrived when he really needed her.",
        "Pascal turned cold. He read the four pages over again. Here an\nopportunity to separate presented itself, acceptable to him and\nadvantageous for Clotilde, so easy and so natural that they ought to\naccept it at once; yet, in spite of all his reasoning he felt so weak,\nso irresolute still that his limbs trembled under him, and he was\nobliged to sit down for a moment. But he wished to be heroic, and\ncontrolling himself, he called to his companion.",
        "“Here!” he said, “read this letter which your grandmother has sent\nme.”",
        "Clotilde read the letter attentively to the end without a word,\nwithout a sign. Then she said simply:",
        "“Well, you are going to answer it, are you not? I refuse.”",
        "He was obliged to exercise a strong effort of self-control to avoid\nuttering a great cry of joy, as he pressed her to his heart. As if it\nwere another person who spoke, he heard himself saying quietly:",
        "“You refuse–impossible! You must reflect. Let us wait till to-morrow\nto give an answer; and let us talk it over, shall we?”",
        "Surprised, she cried excitedly:",
        "“Part from each other! and why? And would you really consent to it?\nWhat folly! we love each other, and you would have me leave you and go\naway where no one cares for me! How could you think of such a thing?\nIt would be stupid.”",
        "He avoided touching on this side of the question, and hastened to\nspeak of promises made–of duty.",
        "“Remember, my dear, how greatly affected you were when I told you that\nMaxime was in danger. And think of him now, struck down by disease,\nhelpless and alone, calling you to his side. Can you abandon him in\nthat situation? You have a duty to fulfil toward him.”",
        "“A duty?” she cried. “Have I any duties toward a brother who has never\noccupied himself with me? My only duty is where my heart is.”",
        "“But you have promised. I have promised for you. I have said that you\nwere rational, and you are not going to belie my words.”",
        "“Rational? It is you who are not rational. It is not rational to\nseparate when to do so would make us both die of grief.”",
        "And with an angry gesture she closed the discussion, saying:",
        "“Besides, what is the use of talking about it? There is nothing\nsimpler; it is only necessary to say a single word. Answer me. Are you\ntired of me? Do you wish to send me away?”",
        "He uttered a cry.",
        "“Send you away! I! Great God!”",
        "“Then it is all settled. If you do not send me away I shall remain.”",
        "She laughed now, and, running to her desk, wrote in red pencil across\nher brother’s letter two words–\"I refuse;” then she called Martine\nand insisted upon her taking the letter back at once. Pascal was\nradiant; a wave of happiness so intense inundated his being that he\nlet her have her way. The joy of keeping her with him deprived him\neven of his power of reasoning.",
        "But that very night, what remorse did he not feel for having been so\ncowardly! He had again yielded to his longing for happiness. A\ndeathlike sweat broke out upon him when he saw her in imagination far\naway; himself alone, without her, without that caressing and subtle\nessence that pervaded the atmosphere when she was near; her breath,\nher brightness, her courageous rectitude, and the dear presence,\nphysical and mental, which had now become as necessary to his life as\nthe light of day itself. She must leave him, and he must find the\nstrength to die of it. He despised himself for his want of courage, he\njudged the situation with terrible clear-sightedness. All was ended.\nAn honorable existence and a fortune awaited her with her brother; he\ncould not carry his senile selfishness so far as to keep her any\nlonger in the misery in which he was, to be scorned and despised. And\nfainting at the thought of all he was losing, he swore to himself that\nhe would be strong, that he would not accept the sacrifice of this\nchild, that he would restore her to happiness and to life, in her own\ndespite.",
        "And now the struggle of self-abnegation began. Some days passed; he\nhad demonstrated to her so clearly the rudeness of her “I refuse,” on\nMaxime’s letter, that she had written a long letter to her\ngrandmother, explaining to her the reasons for her refusal. But still\nshe would not leave La Souleiade. As Pascal had grown extremely\nparsimonious, in his desire to trench as little as possible on the\nmoney obtained by the sale of the jewels, she surpassed herself,\neating her dry bread with merry laughter. One morning he surprised her\ngiving lessons of economy to Martine. Twenty times a day she would\nlook at him intently and then throw herself on his neck and cover his\nface with kisses, to combat the dreadful idea of a separation, which\nshe saw always in his eyes. Then she had another argument. One evening\nafter dinner he was seized with a palpitation of the heart, and almost\nfainted. This surprised him; he had never suffered from the heart, and\nhe believed it to be simply a return of his old nervous trouble. Since\nhis great happiness he had felt less strong, with an odd sensation, as\nif some delicate hidden spring had snapped within him. Greatly\nalarmed, she hurried to his assistance. Well! now he would no doubt\nnever speak again of her going away. When one loved people, and they\nwere ill, one stayed with them to take care of them.",
        "The struggle thus became a daily, an hourly one. It was a continual\nassault made by affection, by devotion, by self-abnegation, in the one\ndesire for another’s happiness. But while her kindness and tenderness\nmade the thought of her departure only the more cruel for Pascal, he\nfelt every day more and more strongly the necessity for it. His\nresolution was now taken. But he remained at bay, trembling and\nhesitating as to the means of persuading her. He pictured to himself\nher despair, her tears; what should he do? how should he tell her? how\ncould they bring themselves to give each other a last embrace, never\nto see each other again? And the days passed, and he could think of\nnothing, and he began once more to accuse himself of cowardice.",
        "Sometimes she would say jestingly, with a touch of affectionate\nmalice:",
        "“Master, you are too kind-hearted not to keep me.”",
        "But this vexed him; he grew excited, and with gloomy despair answered:",
        "“No, no! don’t talk of my kindness. If I were really kind you would\nhave been long ago with your brother, leading an easy and honorable\nlife, with a bright and tranquil future before you, instead of\nobstinately remaining here, despised, poor, and without any prospect,\nto be the sad companion of an old fool like me! No, I am nothing but a\ncoward and a dishonorable man!”",
        "She hastily stopped him. And it was in truth his kindness of heart,\nabove all, that bled, that immense kindness of heart which sprang from\nhis love of life, which he diffused over persons and things, in his\ncontinual care for the happiness of every one and everything. To be\nkind, was not this to love her, to make her happy, at the price of his\nown happiness? This was the kindness which it was necessary for him to\nexercise, and which he felt that he would one day exercise, heroic and\ndecisive. But like the wretch who has resolved upon suicide, he waited\nfor the opportunity, the hour, and the means, to carry out his design.\nEarly one morning, on going into the workroom, Clotilde was surprised\nto see Dr. Pascal seated at his table. It was many weeks since he had\neither opened a book or touched a pen.",
        "“Why! you are working?” she said.",
        "Without raising his head he answered absently:",
        "“Yes; this is the genealogical tree that I had not even brought up to\ndate.”",
        "She stood behind him for a few moments, looking at him writing. He was\ncompleting the notices of Aunt Dide, of Uncle Macquart, and of little\nCharles, writing the dates of their death. Then, as he did not stir,\nseeming not to know that she was there, waiting for the kisses and the\nsmiles of other mornings, she walked idly over to the window and back\nagain.",
        "“So you are in earnest,” she said, “you are really working?”",
        "“Certainly; you see I ought to have noted down these deaths last\nmonth. And I have a heap of work waiting there for me.”",
        "She looked at him fixedly, with that steady inquiring gaze with which\nshe sought to read his thoughts.",
        "“Very well, let us work. If you have papers to examine, or notes to\ncopy, give them to me.”",
        "And from this day forth he affected to give himself up entirely to\nwork. Besides, it was one of his theories that absolute rest was\nunprofitable, that it should never be prescribed, even to the\noverworked. As the fish lives in the water, so a man lives only in the\nexternal medium which surrounds him, the sensations which he receives\nfrom it transforming themselves in him into impulses, thoughts, and\nacts; so that if there were absolute rest, if he continued to receive\nsensations without giving them out again, digested and transformed, an\nengorgement would result, a malaise, an inevitable loss of\nequilibrium. For himself he had always found work to be the best\nregulator of his existence. Even on the mornings when he felt ill, if\nhe set to work he recovered his equipoise. He never felt better than\nwhen he was engaged on some long work, methodically planned out\nbeforehand, so many pages to so many hours every morning, and he\ncompared this work to a balancing-pole, which enabled him to maintain\nhis equilibrium in the midst of daily miseries, weaknesses, and\nmistakes. So that he attributed entirely to the idleness in which he\nhad been living for some weeks past, the palpitation which at times\nmade him feel as if he were going to suffocate. If he wished to\nrecover his health he had only to take up again his great work.",
        "And Pascal spent hours developing and explaining these theories to\nClotilde, with a feverish and exaggerated enthusiasm. He seemed to be\nonce more possessed by the love of knowledge and study in which, up to\nthe time of his sudden passion for her, he had spent his life\nexclusively. He repeated to her that he could not leave his work\nunfinished, that he had still a great deal to do, if he desired to\nleave a lasting monument behind him. His anxiety about the envelopes\nseemed to have taken possession of him again; he opened the large\npress twenty times a day, taking them down from the upper shelf and\nenriching them by new notes. His ideas on heredity were already\nundergoing a transformation; he would have liked to review the whole,\nto recast the whole, to deduce from the family history, natural and\nsocial, a vast synthesis, a resume, in broad strokes, of all humanity.\nThen, besides, he reviewed his method of treatment by hypodermic\ninjections, with the purpose of amplifying it–a confused vision of a\nnew therapeutics; a vague and remote theory based on his convictions\nand his personal experience of the beneficent dynamic influence of\nwork.",
        "Now every morning, when he seated himself at his table, he would\nlament:",
        "“I shall not live long enough; life is too short.”",
        "He seemed to feel that he must not lose another hour. And one morning\nhe looked up abruptly and said to his companion, who was copying a\nmanuscript at his side:",
        "“Listen well, Clotilde. If I should die–”",
        "“What an idea!” she protested, terrified.",
        "“If I should die,” he resumed, “listen to me well–close all the doors\nimmediately. You are to keep the envelopes, you, you only. And when\nyou have collected all my other manuscripts, send them to Ramond.\nThese are my last wishes, do you hear?”",
        "But she refused to listen to him.",
        "“No, no!” she cried hastily, “you talk nonsense!”",
        "“Clotilde, swear to me that you will keep the envelopes, and that you\nwill send all my other papers to Ramond.”",
        "At last, now very serious, and her eyes filled with tears, she gave\nhim the promise he desired. He caught her in his arms, he, too, deeply\nmoved, and lavished caresses upon her, as if his heart had all at once\nreopened to her. Presently he recovered his calmness, and spoke of his\nfears. Since he had been trying to work they seemed to have returned.\nHe kept constant watch upon the press, pretending to have observed\nMartine prowling about it. Might they not work upon the fanaticism of\nthis girl, and urge her to a bad action, persuading her that she was\nsecuring her master’s eternal welfare? He had suffered so much from\nsuspicion! In the dread of approaching solitude his former tortures\nreturned–the tortures of the scientist, who is menaced and persecuted\nby his own, at his own fireside, in his very flesh, in the work of his\nbrain.",
        "One evening, when he was again discussing this subject with Clotilde,\nhe said unthinkingly:",
        "“You know that when you are no longer here–”",
        "She turned very pale and, as he stopped with a start, she cried:",
        "“Oh, master, master, you have not given up that dreadful idea, then? I\ncan see in your eyes that you are hiding something from me, that you\nhave a thought which you no longer share with me. But if I go away and\nyou should die, who will be here then to protect your work?”",
        "Thinking that she had become reconciled, to the idea of her departure,\nhe had the strength to answer gaily:",
        "“Do you suppose that I would allow myself to die without seeing you\nonce more. I will write to you, of course. You must come back to close\nmy eyes.”",
        "Now she burst out sobbing, and sank into a chair.",
        "“My God! Can it be! You wish that to-morrow we should be together no\nlonger, we who have never been separated!”",
        "From this day forth Pascal seemed more engrossed than ever in his\nwork. He would sit for four or five hours at a time, whole mornings\nand afternoons, without once raising his head. He overacted his zeal.\nHe would allow no one to disturb him, by so much as a word. And when\nClotilde would leave the room on tiptoe to give an order downstairs or\nto go on some errand, he would assure himself by a furtive glance that\nshe was gone, and then let his head drop on the table, with an air of\nprofound dejection. It was a painful relief from the extraordinary\neffort which he compelled himself to make when she was present; to\nremain at his table, instead of going over and taking her in his arms\nand covering her face with sweet kisses. Ah, work! how ardently he\ncalled on it as his only refuge from torturing thoughts. But for the\nmost part he was unable to work; he was obliged to feign attention,\nkeeping his eyes fixed upon the page, his sorrowful eyes that grew dim\nwith tears, while his mind, confused, distracted, filled always with\none image, suffered the pangs of death. Was he then doomed to see work\nfail now its effect, he who had always considered it of sovereign\npower, the creator and ruler of the world? Must he then throw away his\npen, renounce action, and do nothing in future but exist? And tears\nwould flow down his white beard; and if he heard Clotilde coming\nupstairs again he would seize his pen quickly, in order that she might\nfind him as she had left him, buried seemingly in profound meditation,\nwhen his mind was now only an aching void.",
        "It was now the middle of September; two weeks that had seemed\ninterminable had passed in this distressing condition of things,\nwithout bringing any solution, when one morning Clotilde was greatly\nsurprised by seeing her grandmother, Felicite, enter. Pascal had met\nhis mother the day before in the Rue de la Banne, and, impatient to\nconsummate the sacrifice, and not finding in himself the strength to\nmake the rupture, he had confided in her, in spite of his repugnance,\nand begged her to come on the following day. As it happened, she had\njust received another letter from Maxime, a despairing and imploring\nletter.",
        "She began by explaining her presence.",
        "“Yes, it is I, my dear, and you can understand that only very weighty\nreasons could have induced me to set my foot here again. But, indeed,\nyou are getting crazy; I cannot allow you to ruin your life in this\nway, without making a last effort to open your eyes.”",
        "She then read Maxime’s letter in a tearful voice. He was nailed to an\narmchair. It seemed he was suffering from a form of ataxia, rapid in\nits progress and very painful. Therefore he requested a decided answer\nfrom his sister, hoping still that she would come, and trembling at\nthe thought of being compelled to seek another nurse. This was what he\nwould be obliged to do, however, if they abandoned him in his sad\ncondition. And when she had finished reading the letter she hinted\nthat it would be a great pity to let Maxime’s fortune pass into the\nhands of strangers; but, above all, she spoke of duty; of the\nassistance one owed to a relation, she, too, affecting to believe that\na formal promise had been given.",
        "“Come, my dear, call upon your memory. You told him that if he should\never need you, you would go to him; I can hear you saying it now. Was\nit not so, my son?”",
        "Pascal, his face pale, his head slightly bent, had kept silence since\nhis mother’s entrance, leaving her to act. He answered only by an\naffirmative nod.",
        "Then Felicite went over all the arguments that he himself had employed\nto persuade Clotilde–the dreadful scandal, to which insult was now\nadded; impending want, so hard for them both; the impossibility of\ncontinuing the life they were leading. What future could they hope\nfor, now that they had been overtaken by poverty? It was stupid and\ncruel to persist longer in her obstinate refusal.",
        "Clotilde, standing erect and with an impenetrable countenance,\nremained silent, refusing even to discuss the question. But as her\ngrandmother tormented her to give an answer, she said at last:",
        "“Once more, I have no duty whatever toward my brother; my duty is\nhere. He can dispose of his fortune as he chooses; I want none of it.\nWhen we are too poor, master shall send away Martine and keep me as\nhis servant.”",
        "Old Mme. Rougon wagged her chin.",
        "“Before being his servant it would be better if you had begun by being\nhis wife. Why have you not got married? It would have been simpler and\nmore proper.”",
        "And Felicite reminded her how she had come one day to urge this\nmarriage, in order to put an end to gossip, and how the young girl had\nseemed greatly surprised, saying that neither she nor the doctor had\nthought of it, but that, notwithstanding, they would get married later\non, if necessary, for there was no hurry.",
        "“Get married; I am quite willing!” cried Clotilde. “You are right,\ngrandmother.”",
        "And turning to Pascal:",
        "“You have told me a hundred times that you would do whatever I wished.\nMarry me; do you hear? I will be your wife, and I will stay here. A\nwife does not leave her husband.”",
        "But he answered only by a gesture, as if he feared that his voice\nwould betray him, and that he should accept, in a cry of gratitude,\nthe eternal bond which she had proposed to him. His gesture might\nsignify a hesitation, a refusal. What was the good of this marriage\nin extremis, when everything was falling to pieces?",
        "“Those are very fine sentiments, no doubt,” returned Felicite. “You\nhave settled it all in your own little head. But marriage will not\ngive you an income; and, meantime, you are a great expense to him; you\nare the heaviest of his burdens.”",
        "The effect which these words had upon Clotilde was extraordinary. She\nturned violently to Pascal, her cheeks crimson, her eyes filled with\ntears.",
        "“Master, master! is what grandmother has just said true? Has it come\nto this, that you regret the money I cost you here?”",
        "Pascal grew still paler; he remained motionless, in an attitude of\nutter dejection. But in a far-away voice, as if he were talking to\nhimself, he murmured:",
        "“I have so much work to do! I should like to go over my envelopes, my\nmanuscripts, my notes, and complete the work of my life. If I were\nalone perhaps I might be able to arrange everything. I would sell La\nSouleiade, oh! for a crust of bread, for it is not worth much. I\nshould shut myself and my papers in a little room. I should work from\nmorning till night, and I should try not to be too unhappy.”",
        "But he avoided her glance; and, agitated as she was, these painful and\nstammering utterances were not calculated to satisfy her. She grew\nevery moment more and more terrified, for she felt that the\nirrevocable word was about to be spoken.",
        "“Look at me, master, look me in the face. And I conjure you, be brave,\nchoose between your work and me, since you say, it seems, that you\nsend me away that you may work the better.”",
        "The moment for the heroic falsehood had come. He lifted his head and\nlooked her bravely in the face, and with the smile of a dying man who\ndesires death, recovering his voice of divine goodness, he said:",
        "“How excited you get! Can you not do your duty quietly, like everybody\nelse? I have a great deal of work to do, and I need to be alone; and\nyou, dear, you ought to go to your brother. Go then, everything is\nended.”",
        "There was a terrible silence for the space of a few seconds. She\nlooked at him earnestly, hoping that he would change his mind. Was he\nreally speaking the truth? was he not sacrificing himself in order\nthat she might be happy? For a moment she had an intuition that this\nwas the case, as if some subtle breath, emanating from him, had warned\nher of it.",
        "“And you are sending me away forever? You will not permit me to come\nback to-morrow?”",
        "But he held out bravely; with another smile he seemed to answer that\nwhen one went away like this it was not to come back again on the\nfollowing day. She was now completely bewildered; she knew not what to\nthink. It might be possible that he had chosen work sincerely; that\nthe man of science had gained the victory over the lover. She grew\nstill paler, and she waited a little longer, in the terrible silence;\nthen, slowly, with her air of tender and absolute submission, she\nsaid:",
        "“Very well, master, I will go away whenever you wish, and I will not\nreturn until you send for me.”",
        "The die was cast. The irrevocable was accomplished. Each felt that\nneither would attempt to recall the decision that had been made; and,\nfrom this instant, every minute that passed would bring nearer the\nseparation.",
        "Felicite, surprised at not being obliged to say more, at once desired\nto fix the time for Clotilde’s departure. She applauded herself for\nher tenacity; she thought she had gained the victory by main force. It\nwas now Friday, and it was settled that Clotilde should leave on the\nfollowing Sunday. A despatch was even sent to Maxime.",
        "For the past three days the mistral had been blowing. But on this\nevening its fury was redoubled, and Martine declared, in accordance\nwith the popular belief, that it would last for three days longer. The\nwinds at the end of September, in the valley of the Viorne, are\nterrible. So that the servant took care to go into every room in the\nhouse to assure herself that the shutters were securely fastened. When\nthe mistral blew it caught La Souleiade slantingly, above the roofs of\nthe houses of Plassans, on the little plateau on which the house was\nbuilt. And now it raged and beat against the house, shaking it from\ngarret to cellar, day and night, without a moment’s cessation. The\ntiles were blown off, the fastenings of the windows were torn away,\nwhile the wind, entering the crevices, moaned and sobbed wildly\nthrough the house; and the doors, if they were left open for a moment,\nthrough forgetfulness, slammed to with a noise like the report of a\ncannon. They might have fancied they were sustaining a siege, so great\nwere the noise and the discomfort.",
        "It was in this melancholy house shaken by the storm that Pascal, on\nthe following day, helped Clotilde to make her preparations for her\ndeparture. Old Mme. Rougon was not to return until Sunday, to say\ngood-by. When Martine was informed of the approaching separation, she\nstood still in dumb amazement, and a flash, quickly extinguished,\nlighted her eyes; and as they sent her out of the room, saying that\nthey would not require her assistance in packing the trunks, she\nreturned to the kitchen and busied herself in her usual occupations,\nseeming to ignore the catastrophe which was about to revolutionize\ntheir household of three. But at Pascal’s slightest call she would run\nso promptly and with such alacrity, her face so bright and so\ncheerful, in her zeal to serve him, that she seemed like a young girl.\nPascal did not leave Clotilde for a moment, helping her, desiring to\nassure himself that she was taking with her everything she could need.\nTwo large trunks stood open in the middle of the disordered room;\nbundles and articles of clothing lay about everywhere; twenty times\nthe drawers and the presses had been visited. And in this work, this\nanxiety to forget nothing, the painful sinking of the heart which they\nboth felt was in some measure lessened. They forgot for an instant–he\nwatching carefully to see that no space was lost, utilizing the\nhat-case for the smaller articles of clothing, slipping boxes in between\nthe folds of the linen; while she, taking down the gowns, folded them\non the bed, waiting to put them last in the top tray. Then, when a\nlittle tired they stood up and found themselves again face to face,\nthey would smile at each other at first; then choke back the sudden\ntears that started at the recollection of the impending and inevitable\nmisfortune. But though their hearts bled they remained firm. Good God!\nwas it then true that they were to be no longer together? And then\nthey heard the wind, the terrible wind, which threatened to blow down\nthe house.",
        "How many times during this last day did they not go over to the\nwindow, attracted by the storm, wishing that it would sweep away the\nworld. During these squalls the sun did not cease to shine, the sky\nremained constantly blue, but a livid blue, windswept and dusty, and\nthe sun was a yellow sun, pale and cold. They saw in the distance the\nvast white clouds rising from the roads, the trees bending before the\nblast, looking as if they were flying all in the same direction, at\nthe same rate of speed; the whole country parched and exhausted by the\nunvarying violence of the wind that blew ceaselessly, with a roar like\nthunder. Branches were snapped and whirled out of sight; roofs were\nlifted up and carried so far away that they were never afterward\nfound. Why could not the mistral take them all up together and carry\nthem off to some unknown land, where they might be happy? The trunks\nwere almost packed when Pascal went to open one of the shutters that\nthe wind had blown to, but so fierce a gust swept in through the half\nopen window that Clotilde had to go to his assistance. Leaning with\nall their weight, they were able at last to turn the catch. The\narticles of clothing in the room were blown about, and they gathered\nup in fragments a little hand mirror which had fallen from a chair.\nWas this a sign of approaching death, as the women of the faubourg\nsaid?",
        "In the evening, after a mournful dinner in the bright dining-room,\nwith its great bouquets of flowers, Pascal said he would retire early.\nClotilde was to leave on the following morning by the ten o’clock\ntrain, and he feared for her the long journey–twenty hours of railway\ntraveling. But when he had retired he was unable to sleep. At first he\nthought it was the wind that kept him awake. The sleeping house was\nfull of cries, voices of entreaty and voices of anger, mingled\ntogether, accompanied by endless sobbing. Twice he got up and went to\nlisten at Clotilde’s door, but he heard nothing. He went downstairs to\nclose a door that banged persistently, like misfortune knocking at the\nwalls. Gusts blew through the dark rooms, and he went to bed again,\nshivering and haunted by lugubrious visions.",
        "At six o’clock Martine, fancying she heard her master knocking for her\non the floor of his room, went upstairs. She entered the room with the\nalert and excited expression which she had worn for the past two days;\nbut she stood still, astonished and uneasy, when she saw him lying,\nhalf-dressed, across his bed, haggard, biting the pillow to stifle his\nsobs. He got out of bed and tried to finish dressing himself, but a\nfresh attack seized him, and, his head giddy and his heart palpitating\nto suffocation, recovering from a momentary faintness, he faltered in\nagonized tones:",
        "“No, no, I cannot; I suffer too much. I would rather die, die now–”",
        "He recognized Martine, and abandoning himself to his grief, his\nstrength totally gone, he made his confession to her:",
        "“My poor girl, I suffer too much, my heart is breaking. She is taking\naway my heart with her, she is taking away my whole being. I cannot\nlive without her. I almost died last night. I would be glad to die\nbefore her departure, not to have the anguish of seeing her go away.\nOh, my God! she is going away, and I shall have her no longer, and I\nshall be left alone, alone, alone!”",
        "The servant, who had gone upstairs so gaily, turned as pale as wax,\nand a hard and bitter look came into her face. For a moment she\nwatched him clutching the bedclothes convulsively, uttering hoarse\ncries of despair, his face pressed against the coverlet. Then, by a\nviolent effort, she seemed to make up her mind.",
        "“But, monsieur, there is no sense in making trouble for yourself in\nthis way. It is ridiculous. Since that is how it is, and you cannot do\nwithout mademoiselle, I shall go and tell her what a state you have\nlet yourself get into.”",
        "At these words he got up hastily, staggering still, and, leaning for\nsupport on the back of a chair, he cried:",
        "“I positively forbid you to do so, Martine!”",
        "“A likely thing that I should listen to you, seeing you like that! To\nfind you some other time half dead, crying your eyes out! No, no! I\nshall go to mademoiselle and tell her the truth, and compel her to\nremain with us.”",
        "But he caught her angrily by the arm and held her fast.",
        "“I command you to keep quiet, do you hear? Or you shall go with her!\nWhy did you come in? It was this wind that made me ill. That concerns\nno one.”",
        "Then, yielding to a good-natured impulse, with his usual kindness of\nheart, he smiled.",
        "“My poor girl, see how you vex me? Let me act as I ought, for the\nhappiness of others. And not another word; you would pain me greatly.”",
        "Martine’s eyes, too, filled with tears. It was just in time that they\nmade peace, for Clotilde entered almost immediately. She had risen\nearly, eager to see Pascal, hoping doubtless, up to the last moment,\nthat he would keep her. Her own eyelids were heavy from want of sleep,\nand she looked at him steadily as she entered, with her inquiring air.\nBut he was still so discomposed that she began to grow uneasy.",
        "“No, indeed, I assure you, I would even have slept well but for the\nmistral. I was just telling you so, Martine, was I not?”",
        "The servant confirmed his words by an affirmative nod. And Clotilde,\ntoo, submitted, saying nothing of the night of anguish and mental\nconflict she had spent while he, on his side, had been suffering the\npangs of death. Both of the women now docilely obeyed and aided him,\nin his heroic self-abnegation.",
        "“What,” he continued, opening his desk, “I have something here for\nyou. There! there are seven hundred francs in that envelope.”",
        "And in spite of her exclamations and protestations he persisted in\nrendering her an account. Of the six thousand francs obtained by the\nsale of the jewels two hundred only had been spent, and he had kept\none hundred to last till the end of the month, with the strict\neconomy, the penuriousness, which he now displayed. Afterward he would\nno doubt sell La Souleiade, he would work, he would be able to\nextricate himself from his difficulties. But he would not touch the\nfive thousand francs which remained, for they were her property, her\nown, and she would find them again in the drawer.",
        "“Master, master, you are giving me a great deal of pain–”",
        "“I wish it,” he interrupted, “and it is you who are trying to break my\nheart. Come, it is half-past seven, I will go and cord your trunks\nsince they are locked.”",
        "When Martine and Clotilde were alone and face to face they looked at\neach other for a moment in silence. Ever since the commencement of the\nnew situation, they had been fully conscious of their secret\nantagonism, the open triumph of the young mistress, the half concealed\njealousy of the old servant about her adored master. Now it seemed\nthat the victory remained with the servant. But in this final moment\ntheir common emotion drew them together.",
        "“Martine, you must not let him eat like a poor man. You promise me\nthat he shall have wine and meat every day?”",
        "“Have no fear, mademoiselle.”",
        "“And the five thousand francs lying there, you know belong to him. You\nare not going to let yourselves starve to death, I suppose, with those\nthere. I want you to treat him very well.”",
        "“I tell you that I will make it my business to do so, mademoiselle,\nand that monsieur shall want for nothing.”",
        "There was a moment’s silence. They were still regarding each other.",
        "“And watch him, to see that he does not overwork himself. I am going\naway very uneasy; he has not been well for some time past. Take good\ncare of him.”",
        "“Make your mind easy, mademoiselle, I will take care of him.”",
        "“Well, I give him into your charge. He will have only you now; and it\nis some consolation to me to know that you love him dearly. Love him\nwith all your strength. Love him for us both.”",
        "“Yes, mademoiselle, as much as I can.”",
        "Tears came into their eyes; Clotilde spoke again.",
        "“Will you embrace me, Martine?”",
        "“Oh, mademoiselle, very gladly.”",
        "They were in each other’s arms when Pascal reentered the room. He\npretended not to see them, doubtless afraid of giving way to his\nemotion. In an unnaturally loud voice he spoke of the final\npreparations for Clotilde’s departure, like a man who had a great deal\non his hands and was afraid that the train might be missed. He had\ncorded the trunks, a man had taken them away in a little wagon, and\nthey would find them at the station. But it was only eight o’clock,\nand they had still two long hours before them. Two hours of mortal\nanguish, spent in unoccupied and weary waiting, during which they\ntasted a hundred times over the bitterness of parting. The breakfast\ntook hardly a quarter of an hour. Then they got up, to sit down again.\nTheir eyes never left the clock. The minutes seemed long as those of a\ndeath watch, throughout the mournful house.",
        "“How the wind blows!” said Clotilde, as a sudden gust made all the\ndoors creak.",
        "Pascal went over to the window and watched the wild flight of the\nstorm-blown trees.",
        "“It has increased since morning,” he said. “Presently I must see to\nthe roof, for some of the tiles have been blown away.”",
        "Already they had ceased to be one household. They listened in silence\nto the furious wind, sweeping everything before it, carrying with it\ntheir life.",
        "Finally Pascal looked for a last time at the clock, and said simply:",
        "“It is time, Clotilde.”",
        "She rose from the chair on which she had been sitting. She had for an\ninstant forgotten that she was going away, and all at once the\ndreadful reality came back to her. Once more she looked at him, but he\ndid not open his arms to keep her. It was over; her hope was dead. And\nfrom this moment her face was like that of one struck with death.",
        "At first they exchanged the usual commonplaces.",
        "“You will write to me, will you not?”",
        "“Certainly, and you must let me hear from you as often as possible.”",
        "“Above all, if you should fall ill, send for me at once.”",
        "“I promise you that I will do so. But there is no danger. I am very\nstrong.”",
        "Then, when the moment came in which she was to leave this dear house,\nClotilde looked around with unsteady gaze; then she threw herself on\nPascal’s breast, she held him for an instant in her arms, faltering:",
        "“I wish to embrace you here, I wish to thank you. Master, it is you\nwho have made me what I am. As you have often told me, you have\ncorrected my heredity. What should I have become amid the surroundings\nin which Maxime has grown up? Yes, if I am worth anything, it is to\nyou alone I owe it, you, who transplanted me into this abode of\nkindness and affection, where you have brought me up worthy of you.\nNow, after having taken me and overwhelmed me with benefits, you send\nme away. Be it as you will, you are my master, and I will obey you. I\nlove you, in spite of all, and I shall always love you.”",
        "He pressed her to his heart, answering:",
        "“I desire only your good, I am completing my work.”",
        "When they reached the station, Clotilde vowed to herself that she\nwould one day come back. Old Mme. Rougon was there, very gay and very\nbrisk, in spite of her eighty-and-odd years. She was triumphant now;\nshe thought she would have her son Pascal at her mercy. When she saw\nthem both stupefied with grief she took charge of everything; got the\nticket, registered the baggage, and installed the traveler in a\ncompartment in which there were only ladies. Then she spoke for a long\ntime about Maxime, giving instructions and asking to be kept informed\nof everything. But the train did not start; there were still five\ncruel minutes during which they remained face to face, without\nspeaking to each other. Then came the end, there were embraces, a\ngreat noise of wheels, and waving of handkerchiefs.",
        "Suddenly Pascal became aware that he was standing alone upon the\nplatform, while the train was disappearing around a bend in the road.\nThen, without listening to his mother, he ran furiously up the slope,\nsprang up the stone steps like a young man, and found himself in three\nminutes on the terrace of La Souleiade. The mistral was raging there–\na fierce squall which bent the secular cypresses like straws. In the\ncolorless sky the sun seemed weary of the violence of the wind, which\nfor six days had been sweeping over its face. And like the wind-blown\ntrees Pascal stood firm, his garments flapping like banners, his beard\nand hair blown about and lashed by the storm. His breath caught by the\nwind, his hands pressed upon his heart to quiet its throbbing, he saw\nthe train flying in the distance across the bare plain, a little train\nwhich the mistral seemed to sweep before it like a dry branch.",
        "From the day following Clotilde’s departure, Pascal shut himself up in\nthe great empty house. He did not leave it again, ceasing entirely the\nrare professional visits which he had still continued to make, living\nthere with doors and windows closed, in absolute silence and solitude.\nMartine had received formal orders to admit no one under any pretext\nwhatever.",
        "“But your mother, monsieur, Mme. Felicite?”",
        "“My mother, less than any one else; I have my reasons. Tell her that I\nam working, that I require to concentrate my thoughts, and that I\nrequest her to excuse me.”",
        "Three times in succession old Mme. Rougon had presented herself. She\nwould storm at the hall door. He would hear her voice rising in anger\nas she tried in vain to force her way in. Then the noise would be\nstilled, and there would be only a whisper of complaint and plotting\nbetween her and the servant. But not once did he yield, not once did\nhe lean over the banisters and call to her to come up.",
        "One day Martine ventured to say to him:",
        "“It is very hard, all the same, monsieur, to refuse admittance to\none’s mother. The more so, as Mme. Felicite comes with good\nintentions, for she knows the straits that monsieur is in, and she\ninsists only in order to offer her services.”",
        "“Money!” he cried, exasperated. “I want no money, do you hear? And\nfrom her less than anybody. I will work, I will earn my own living;\nwhy should I not?”",
        "The question of money, however, began to grow pressing. He obstinately\nrefused to take another sou from the five thousand francs locked up in\nthe desk. Now that he was alone, he was completely indifferent to\nmaterial things; he would have been satisfied to live on bread and\nwater; and every time the servant asked him for money to buy wine,\nmeat, or sweets, he shrugged his shoulders–what was the use? there\nremained a crust from the day before, was not that sufficient? But in\nher affection for her master, whom she felt to be suffering, the old\nservant was heart-broken at this miserliness which exceeded her own;\nthis utter destitution to which he abandoned himself and the whole\nhouse. The workmen of the faubourgs lived better. Thus it was that for\na whole day a terrible conflict went on within her. Her doglike love\nstruggled with her love for her money, amassed sou by sou, hidden\naway, “making more,” as she said. She would rather have parted with a\npiece of her flesh. So long as her master had not suffered alone the\nidea of touching her treasure had not even occurred to her. And she\ndisplayed extraordinary heroism the morning when, driven to extremity,\nseeing her stove cold and the larder empty, she disappeared for an\nhour and then returned with provisions and the change of a hundred-\nfranc note.",
        "Pascal, who just then chanced to come downstairs, asked her in\nastonishment where the money had come from, furious already, and\nprepared to throw it all into the street, imagining she had applied to\nhis mother.",
        "“Why, no; why, no, monsieur!” she stammered, “it is not that at all.”",
        "And she told him the story that she had prepared.",
        "“Imagine, M. Grandguillot’s affairs are going to be settled–or at\nleast I think so. It occurred to me this morning to go to the\nassignee’s to inquire, and he told me that you would undoubtedly\nrecover something, and that I might have a hundred francs now. Yes, he\nwas even satisfied with a receipt from me. He knows me, and you can\nmake it all right afterward.”",
        "Pascal seemed scarcely surprised. She had calculated correctly that he\nwould not go out to verify her account. She was relieved, however, to\nsee with what easy indifference he accepted her story.",
        "“Ah, so much the better!” he said. “You see now that one must never\ndespair. That will give me time to settle my affairs.”",
        "His “affairs” was the sale of La Souleiade, about which he had been\nthinking vaguely. But what a grief to leave this house in which\nClotilde had grown up, where they had lived together for nearly\neighteen years! He had taken two or three weeks already to reflect\nover the matter. Now that he had the hope of getting back a little of\nthe money he had lost through the notary’s failure, he ceased to think\nany more about it. He relapsed into his former indifference, eating\nwhatever Martine served him, not even noticing the comforts with which\nshe once more surrounded him, in humble adoration, heart-broken at\ngiving her money, but very happy to support him now, without his\nsuspecting that his sustenance came from her.",
        "But Pascal rewarded her very ill. Afterward he would be sorry, and\nregret his outbursts. But in the state of feverish desperation in\nwhich he lived this did not prevent him from again flying into a\npassion with her, at the slightest cause of dissatisfaction. One\nevening, after he had been listening to his mother talking for an\ninterminable time with her in the kitchen, he cried in sudden fury:",
        "“Martine, I do not wish her to enter La Souleiade again, do you hear?\nIf you ever let her into the house again I will turn you out!”",
        "She listened to him in surprise. Never, during the thirty-two years in\nwhich she had been in his service, had he threatened to dismiss her in\nthis way. Big tears came to her eyes.",
        "“Oh, monsieur! you would not have the courage to do it! And I would\nnot go. I would lie down across the threshold first.”",
        "He already regretted his anger, and he said more gently:",
        "“The thing is that I know perfectly well what is going on. She comes\nto indoctrinate you, to put you against me, is it not so? Yes, she is\nwatching my papers; she wishes to steal and destroy everything up\nthere in the press. I know her; when she wants anything, she never\ngives up until she gets it. Well, you can tell her that I am on my\nguard; that while I am alive she shall never even come near the press.\nAnd the key is here in my pocket.”",
        "In effect, all his former terror–the terror of the scientist who\nfeels himself surrounded by secret enemies, had returned. Ever since\nhe had been living alone in the deserted house he had had a feeling of\nreturning danger, of being constantly watched in secret. The circle\nhad narrowed, and if he showed such anger at these attempts at\ninvasion, if he repulsed his mother’s assaults, it was because he did\nnot deceive himself as to her real plans, and he was afraid that he\nmight yield. If she were there she would gradually take possession of\nhim, until she had subjugated him completely. Therefore his former\ntortures returned, and he passed the days watching; he shut up the\nhouse himself in the evening, and he would often rise during the\nnight, to assure himself that the locks were not being forced. What he\nfeared was that the servant, won over by his mother, and believing she\nwas securing his eternal welfare, would open the door to Mme.\nFelicite. In fancy he saw the papers blazing in the fireplace; he kept\nconstant guard over them, seized again by a morbid love, a torturing\naffection for this icy heap of papers, these cold pages of manuscript,\nto which he had sacrificed the love of woman, and which he tried to\nlove sufficiently to be able to forget everything else for them.",
        "Pascal, now that Clotilde was no longer there, threw himself eagerly\ninto work, trying to submerge himself in it, to lose himself in it. If\nhe secluded himself, if he did not set foot even in the garden, if he\nhad had the strength, one day when Martine came up to announce Dr.\nRamond, to answer that he would not receive him, he had, in this\nbitter desire for solitude, no other aim than to kill thought by\nincessant labor. That poor Ramond, how gladly he would have embraced\nhim! for he divined clearly the delicacy of feeling that had made him\nhasten to console his old master. But why lose an hour? Why risk\nemotions and tears which would leave him so weak? From daylight he was\nat his table, he spent at it his mornings and his afternoons, extended\noften into the evening after the lamp was lighted, and far into the\nnight. He wished to put his old project into execution–to revise his\nwhole theory of heredity, employing the documents furnished by his own\nfamily to establish the laws according to which, in a certain group of\nhuman beings, life is distributed and conducted with mathematical\nprecision from one to another, taking into account the environment–a\nvast bible, the genesis of families, of societies, of all humanity. He\nhoped that the vastness of such a plan, the effort necessary to\ndevelop so colossal an idea, would take complete possession of him,\nrestoring to him his health, his faith, his pride in the supreme joy\nof the accomplished work. But it was in vain that he threw himself\npassionately, persistently, without reserve, into his work; he\nsucceeded only in fatiguing his body and his mind, without even being\nable to fix his thoughts or to put his heart into his work, every day\nsicker and more despairing. Had work, then, finally lost its power? He\nwhose life had been spent in work, who had regarded it as the sole\nmotor, the benefactor, and the consoler, must he then conclude that to\nlove and to be loved is beyond all else in the world? Occasionally he\nwould have great thoughts, he continued to sketch out his new theory\nof the equilibrium of forces, demonstrating that what man receives in\nsensation he should return in action. How natural, full, and happy\nwould life be if it could be lived entire, performing its functions\nlike a well-ordered machine, giving back in power what was consumed in\nfuel, maintaining itself in vigor and in beauty by the simultaneous\nand logical play of all its organs. He believed physical and\nintellectual labor, feeling and reasoning should be in equal\nproportions, and never excessive, for excess meant disturbance of the\nequilibrium and, consequently, disease. Yes, yes, to begin life over\nagain and to know how to live it, to dig the earth, to study man, to\nlove woman, to attain to human perfection, the future city of\nuniversal happiness, through the harmonious working of the entire\nbeing, what a beautiful legacy for a philosophical physician to leave\nbehind him would this be! And this dream of the future, this theory,\nconfusedly perceived, filled him with bitterness at the thought that\nnow his life was a force wasted and lost.",
        "At the very bottom of his grief Pascal had the dominating feeling that\nfor him life was ended. Regret for Clotilde, sorrow at having her no\nlonger beside him, the certainty that he would never see her again,\nfilled him with overwhelming grief. Work had lost its power, and he\nwould sometimes let his head drop on the page he was writing, and weep\nfor hours together, unable to summon courage to take up the pen again.\nHis passion for work, his days of voluntary fatigue, led to terrible\nnights, nights of feverish sleeplessness, in which he would stuff the\nbedclothes into his mouth to keep from crying out Clotilde’s name. She\nwas everywhere in this mournful house in which he secluded himself. He\nsaw her again, walking through the rooms, sitting on the chairs,\nstanding behind the doors. Downstairs, in the dining-room, he could\nnot sit at table, without seeing her opposite him. In the workroom\nupstairs she was still his constant companion, for she, too, had lived\nso long secluded in it that her image seemed reflected from\neverything; he felt her constantly beside him, he could fancy he saw\nher standing before her desk, straight and slender–her delicate face\nbent over a pastel. And if he did not leave the house to escape from\nthe dear and torturing memory it was because he had the certainty that\nhe should find her everywhere in the garden, too: dreaming on the\nterrace; walking with slow steps through the alleys in the pine grove;\nsitting under the shade of the plane trees; lulled by the eternal song\nof the fountain; lying in the threshing yard at twilight, her gaze\nfixed on space, waiting for the stars to come out. But above all,\nthere existed for him a sacred sanctuary which he could not enter\nwithout trembling–the chamber where she had confessed her love. He\nkept the key of it; he had not moved a single object from its place\nsince the sorrowful morning of her departure; and a skirt which she\nhad forgotten lay still upon her armchair. He opened his arms wildly\nto clasp her shade floating in the soft half light of the room, with\nits closed shutters and its walls hung with the old faded pink calico,\nof a dawnlike tint.",
        "In the midst of his unremitting toil Pascal had another melancholy\npleasure–Clotilde’s letters. She wrote to him regularly twice a week,\nlong letters of eight or ten pages, in which she described to him all\nher daily life. She did not seem to lead a very happy life in Paris.\nMaxime, who did not now leave his sick chair, evidently tortured her\nwith the exactions of a spoiled child and an invalid. She spoke as if\nshe lived in complete retirement, always waiting on him, so that she\ncould not even go over to the window to look out on the avenue, along\nwhich rolled the fashionable stream of the promenaders of the Bois;\nand from certain of her expressions it could be divined that her\nbrother, after having entreated her so urgently to go to him,\nsuspected her already, and had begun to regard her with hatred and\ndistrust, as he did every one who approached him, in his continual\nfear of being made use of and robbed. He did not give her the keys,\ntreating her like a servant to whom he found it difficult to accustom\nhimself. Twice she had seen her father, who was, as always, very gay,\nand overwhelmed with business; he had been converted to the Republic,\nand was at the height of political and financial success. Saccard had\neven taken her aside, to sympathize with her, saying that poor Maxime\nwas really insupportable, and that she would be truly courageous if\nshe consented to be made his victim. As she could not do everything,\nhe had even had the kindness to send her, on the following day, the\nniece of his hairdresser, a fair-haired, innocent-looking girl of\neighteen, named Rose, who was assisting her now to take care of the\ninvalid. But Clotilde made no complaint; she affected, on the\ncontrary, to be perfectly tranquil, contented, and resigned to\neverything. Her letters were full of courage, showing neither anger\nnor sorrow at the cruel separation, making no desperate appeal to\nPascal’s affection to recall her. But between the lines, he could\nperceive that she trembled with rebellious anger, that her whole being\nyearned for him, that she was ready to commit the folly of returning\nto him immediately, at his lightest word.",
        "And this was the one word that Pascal would not write. Everything\nwould be arranged in time. Maxime would become accustomed to his\nsister; the sacrifice must be completed now that it had been begun. A\nsingle line written by him in a moment of weakness, and all the\nadvantage of the effort he had made would be lost, and their misery\nwould begin again. Never had Pascal had greater need of courage than\nwhen he was answering Clotilde’s letters. At night, burning with\nfever, he would toss about, calling on her wildly; then he would get\nup and write to her to come back at once. But when day came, and he\nhad exhausted himself with weeping, his fever abated, and his answer\nwas always very short, almost cold. He studied every sentence,\nbeginning the letter over again when he thought he had forgotten\nhimself. But what a torture, these dreadful letters, so short, so icy,\nin which he went against his heart, solely in order to wean her from\nhim gradually, to take upon himself all the blame, and to make her\nbelieve that she could forget him, since he forgot her. They left him\ncovered with perspiration, and as exhausted as if he had just\nperformed some great act of heroism.",
        "One morning toward the end of October, a month after Clotilde’s\ndeparture, Pascal had a sudden attack of suffocation. He had had,\nseveral times already, slight attacks, which he attributed to\noverwork. But this time the symptoms were so plain that he could not\nmistake them–a sharp pain in the region of the heart, extending over\nthe whole chest and along the left arm, and a dreadful sensation of\noppression and distress, while cold perspiration broke out upon him.\nIt was an attack of angina pectoris. It lasted hardly more than a\nminute, and he was at first more surprised than frightened. With that\nblindness which physicians often show where their own health is\nconcerned, he never suspected that his heart might be affected.",
        "As he was recovering his breath Martine came up to say that Dr. Ramond\nwas downstairs, and again begged the doctor to see him. And Pascal,\nyielding perhaps to an unconscious desire to know the truth, cried:",
        "“Well, let him come up, since he insists upon it. I will be glad to\nsee him.”",
        "The two men embraced each other, and no other allusion was made to the\nabsent one, to her whose departure had left the house empty, than an\nenergetic and sad hand clasp.",
        "“You don’t know why I have come?” cried Ramond immediately. “It is\nabout a question of money. Yes, my father-in-law, M. Leveque, the\nadvocate, whom you know, spoke to me yesterday again about the funds\nwhich you had with the notary Grandguillot. And he advises you\nstrongly to take some action in the matter, for some persons have\nsucceeded, he says, in recovering something.”",
        "“Yes, I know that that business is being settled,” said Pascal.\n\"Martine has already got two hundred francs out of it, I believe.”",
        "“Martine?” said Ramond, looking greatly surprised, “how could she do\nthat without your intervention? However, will you authorize my\nfather-in-law to undertake your case? He will see the assignee, and\nsift the whole affair, since you have neither the time nor the\ninclination to attend to it.”",
        "“Certainly, I authorize M. Leveque to do so, and tell him that I thank\nhim a thousand times.”",
        "Then this matter being settled, the young man, remarking the doctor’s\npallor, and questioning him as to its cause, Pascal answered with a\nsmile:",
        "“Imagine, my friend, I have just had an attack of angina pectoris. Oh,\nit is not imagination, all the symptoms were there. And stay! since\nyou are here you shall sound me.”",
        "At first Ramond refused, affecting to turn the consultation into a\njest. Could a raw recruit like him venture to pronounce judgment on\nhis general? But he examined him, notwithstanding, seeing that his\nface looked drawn and pained, with a singular look of fright in the\neyes. He ended by auscultating him carefully, keeping his ear pressed\nclosely to his chest for a considerable time. Several minutes passed\nin profound silence.",
        "“Well?” asked Pascal, when the young physician stood up.",
        "The latter did not answer at once. He felt the doctor’s eyes looking\nstraight into his; and as the question had been put to him with quiet\ncourage, he answered in the same way:",
        "“Well, it is true, I think there is some sclerosis.”",
        "“Ah! it was kind of you not to attempt to deceive me,” returned the\ndoctor, smiling. “I feared for an instant that you would tell me an\nuntruth, and that would have hurt me.”",
        "Ramond, listening again, said in an undertone:",
        "“Yes, the beat is strong, the first sound is dull, while the second,\non the contrary, is sharp. It is evident that the apex has descended\nand is turned toward the armpit. There is some sclerosis, at least it\nis very probable. One may live twenty years with that,” he ended,\nstraightening himself.",
        "“No doubt, sometimes,” said Pascal. “At least, unless one chances to\ndie of a sudden attack.”",
        "They talked for some time longer, discussed a remarkable case of\nsclerosis of the heart, which they had seen at the hospital at\nPlassans. And when the young physician went away, he said that he\nwould return as soon as he should have news of the Grandguillot\nliquidation.",
        "But when he was alone Pascal felt that he was lost. Everything was now\nexplained: his palpitations for some weeks past, his attacks of\nvertigo and suffocation; above all that weakness of the organ, of his\npoor heart, overtasked by feeling and by work, that sense of intense\nfatigue and impending death, regarding which he could no longer\ndeceive himself. It was not as yet fear that he experienced, however.\nHis first thought was that he, too, would have to pay for his\nheredity, that sclerosis was the species of degeneration which was to\nbe his share of the physiological misery, the inevitable inheritance\nbequeathed him by his terrible ancestry. In others the neurosis, the\noriginal lesion, had turned to vice or virtue, genius, crime,\ndrunkenness, sanctity; others again had died of consumption, of\nepilepsy, of ataxia; he had lived in his feelings and he would die of\nan affection of the heart. And he trembled no longer, he rebelled no\nlonger against this manifest heredity, fated and inevitable, no doubt.\nOn the contrary, a feeling of humility took possession of him; the\nidea that all revolt against natural laws is bad, that wisdom does not\nconsist in holding one’s self apart, but in resigning one’s self to be\nonly a member of the whole great body. Why, then, was he so unwilling\nto belong to his family that it filled him with triumph, that his\nheart beat with joy, when he believed himself different from them,\nwithout any community with them? Nothing could be less philosophical.\nOnly monsters grew apart. And to belong to his family seemed to him in\nthe end as good and as fine as to belong to any other family, for did\nnot all families, in the main, resemble one another, was not humanity\neverywhere identical with the same amount of good and evil? He came at\nlast, humbly and gently, even in the face of impending suffering and\ndeath, to accept everything life had to give him.",
        "From this time Pascal lived with the thought that he might die at any\nmoment. And this helped to perfect his character, to elevate him to a\ncomplete forgetfulness of self. He did not cease to work, but he had\nnever understood so well how much effort must seek its reward in\nitself, the work being always transitory, and remaining of necessity\nincomplete. One evening at dinner Martine informed him that Sarteur,\nthe journeyman hatter, the former inmate of the asylum at the\nTulettes, had just hanged himself. All the evening he thought of this\nstrange case, of this man whom he had believed he had cured of\nhomicidal mania by his treatment of hypodermic injections, and who,\nseized by a fresh attack, had evidently had sufficient lucidity to\nhang himself, instead of springing at the throat of some passer-by. He\nagain saw him, so gentle, so reasonable, kissing his hands, while he\nwas advising him to return to his life of healthful labor. What then\nwas this destructive and transforming force, the desire to murder,\nchanging to suicide, death performing its task in spite of everything?\nWith the death of this man his last vestige of pride as a healer\ndisappeared; and each day when he returned to his work he felt as if\nhe were only a learner, spelling out his task, constantly seeking the\ntruth, which as constantly receded from him, assuming ever more\nformidable proportions.",
        "But in the midst of his resignation one thought still troubled him–\nwhat would become of Bonhomme, his old horse, if he himself should die\nbefore him? The poor brute, completely blind and his limbs paralyzed,\ndid not now leave his litter. When his master went to see him,\nhowever, he turned his head, he could feel the two hearty kisses which\nwere pressed on his nose. All the neighbors shrugged their shoulders\nand joked about this old relation whom the doctor would not allow to\nbe slaughtered. Was he then to be the first to go, with the thought\nthat the knacker would be called in on the following day. But one\nmorning, when he entered the stable, Bonhomme did not hear him, did\nnot raise his head. He was dead; he lay there, with a peaceful\nexpression, as if relieved that death had come to him so gently. His\nmaster knelt beside him and kissed him again and bade him farewell,\nwhile two big tears rolled down his cheeks.",
        "It was on this day that Pascal saw his neighbor, M. Bellombre, for the\nlast time. Going over to the window he perceived him in his garden, in\nthe pale sunshine of early November, taking his accustomed walk; and\nthe sight of the old professor, living so completely happy in his\nsolitude, filled him at first with astonishment. He could never have\nimagined such a thing possible, as that a man of sixty-nine should\nlive thus, without wife or child, or even a dog, deriving his selfish\nhappiness from the joy of living outside of life. Then he recalled his\nfits of anger against this man, his sarcasms about his fear of life,\nthe catastrophes which he had wished might happen to him, the hope\nthat punishment would come to him, in the shape of some housekeeper,\nor some female relation dropping down on him unexpectedly. But no, he\nwas still as fresh as ever, and Pascal was sure that for a long time\nto come he would continue to grow old like this, hard, avaricious,\nuseless, and happy. And yet he no longer execrated him; he could even\nhave found it in his heart to pity him, so ridiculous and miserable\ndid he think him for not being loved. Pascal, who suffered the pangs\nof death because he was alone! He whose heart was breaking because he\nwas too full of others. Rather suffering, suffering only, than this\nselfishness, this death of all there is in us of living and human!",
        "In the night which followed Pascal had another attack of angina\npectoris. It lasted for five minutes, and he thought that he would\nsuffocate without having the strength to call Martine. Then when he\nrecovered his breath, he did not disturb himself, preferring to speak\nto no one of this aggravation of his malady; but he had the certainty\nthat it was all over with him, that he might not perhaps live a month\nlonger. His first thought was Clotilde. Should he then never see her\nagain? and so sharp a pang seized him that he believed another attack\nwas coming on. Why should he not write to her to come to him? He had\nreceived a letter from her the day before; he would answer it this\nmorning. Then the thought of the envelopes occurred to him. If he\nshould die suddenly, his mother would be the mistress and she would\ndestroy them; and not only the envelopes, but his manuscripts, all his\npapers, thirty years of his intelligence and his labor. Thus the crime\nwhich he had so greatly dreaded would be consummated, the crime of\nwhich the fear alone, during his nights of fever, had made him get up\nout of bed trembling, his ear on the stretch, listening to hear if\nthey were forcing open the press. The perspiration broke out upon him,\nhe saw himself dispossessed, outraged, the ashes of his work thrown to\nthe four winds. And when his thoughts reverted to Clotilde, he told\nhimself that everything would be satisfactorily arranged, that he had\nonly to call her back–she would be here, she would close his eyes,\nshe would defend his memory. And he sat down to write at once to her,\nso that the letter might go by the morning mail.",
        "But when Pascal was seated before the white paper, with the pen\nbetween his fingers, a growing doubt, a feeling of dissatisfaction\nwith himself, took possession of him. Was not this idea of his papers,\nthis fine project of providing a guardian for them and saving them, a\nsuggestion of his weakness, an excuse which he gave himself to bring\nback Clotilde, and see her again? Selfishness was at the bottom of it.\nHe was thinking of himself, not of her. He saw her returning to this\npoor house, condemned to nurse a sick old man; and he saw her, above\nall, in her grief, in her awful agony, when he should terrify her some\nday by dropping down dead at her side. No, no! this was the dreadful\nmoment which he must spare her, those days of cruel adieus and want\nafterward, a sad legacy which he could not leave her without thinking\nhimself a criminal. Her tranquillity, her happiness only, were of any\nconsequence, the rest did not matter. He would die in his hole, then,\nabandoned, happy to think her happy, to spare her the cruel blow of\nhis death. As for saving his manuscripts he would perhaps find a means\nof doing so, he would try to have the strength to part from them and\ngive them to Ramond. But even if all his papers were to perish, this\nwas less of a sacrifice than to resign himself not to see her again,\nand he accepted it, and he was willing that nothing of him should\nsurvive, not even his thoughts, provided only that nothing of him\nshould henceforth trouble her dear existence.",
        "Pascal accordingly proceeded to write one of his usual answers, which,\nby a great effort, he purposely made colorless and almost cold.\nClotilde, in her last letter, without complaining of Maxime, had given\nit to be understood that her brother had lost his interest in her,\npreferring the society of Rose, the niece of Saccard’s hairdresser,\nthe fair-haired young girl with the innocent look. And he suspected\nstrongly some maneuver of the father: a cunning plan to obtain\npossession of the inheritance of the sick man, whose vices, so\nprecocious formerly, gained new force as his last hour approached. But\nin spite of his uneasiness he gave Clotilde very good advice, telling\nher that she must make allowance for Maxime’s sufferings, that he had\nundoubtedly a great deal of affection and gratitude for her, in short\nthat it was her duty to devote herself to him to the end. When he\nsigned the letter tears dimmed his sight. It was his death warrant–a\ndeath like that of an old and solitary brute, a death without a kiss,\nwithout the touch of a friendly hand–that he was signing. Never again\nwould he embrace her. Then doubts assailed him; was he doing right in\nleaving her amid such evil surroundings, where he felt that she was in\ncontinual contact with every species of wickedness?",
        "The postman brought the letters and newspapers to La Souleiade every\nmorning at about nine o’clock; and Pascal, when he wrote to Clotilde,\nwas accustomed to watch for him, to give him his letter, so as to be\ncertain that his correspondence was not intercepted. But on this\nmorning, when he went downstairs to give him the letter he had just\nwritten, he was surprised to receive one from him from Clotilde,\nalthough it was not the usual day for her letters. He allowed his own\nto go, however. Then he went upstairs, resumed his seat at his table,\nand tore open the envelope.",
        "The letter was short, but its contents filled Pascal with a great joy.",
        "But the sound of footsteps made him control himself. He turned round\nand saw Martine, who was saying:",
        "“Dr. Ramond is downstairs.”",
        "“Ah! let him come up, let him come up,” he said.",
        "It was another piece of good fortune that had come to him. Ramond\ncried gaily from the door:",
        "“Victory, master! I have brought you your money–not all, but a good\nsum.”",
        "And he told the story–an unexpected piece of good luck which his\nfather-in-law, M. Leveque, had brought to light. The receipts for the\nhundred and twenty thousand francs, which constituted Pascal the\npersonal creditor of Grandguillot, were valueless, since the latter\nwas insolvent. Salvation was to come from the power of attorney which\nthe doctor had sent him years before, at his request, that he might\ninvest all or part of his money in mortgages. As the name of the proxy\nwas in blank in the document, the notary, as is sometimes done, had\nmade use of the name of one of his clerks, and eighty thousand francs,\nwhich had been invested in good mortgages, had thus been recovered\nthrough the agency of a worthy man who was not in the secrets of his\nemployer. If Pascal had taken action in the matter, if he had gone to\nthe public prosecutor’s office and the chamber of notaries, he would\nhave disentangled the matter long before. However, he had recovered a\nsure income of four thousand francs.",
        "He seized the young man’s hands and pressed them, smiling, his eyes\nstill moist with tears.",
        "“Ah! my friend, if you knew how happy I am! This letter of Clotilde’s\nhas brought me a great happiness. Yes, I was going to send for her;\nbut the thought of my poverty, of the privations she would have to\nendure here, spoiled for me the joy of her return. And now fortune has\ncome back, at least enough to set up my little establishment again!”",
        "In the expansion of his feelings he held out the letter to Ramond, and\nforced him to read it. Then when the young man gave it back to him,\nsmiling, comprehending the doctor’s emotion, and profoundly touched by\nit, yielding to an overpowering need of affection, he caught him in\nhis arms, like a comrade, a brother. The two men kissed each other\nvigorously on either cheek.",
        "“Come, since good fortune has sent you, I am going to ask another\nservice from you. You know I distrust every one around me, even my old\nhousekeeper. Will you take my despatch to the telegraph office!”",
        "He sat down again at the table, and wrote simply, “I await you; start\nto-night.”",
        "“Let me see,” he said, “to-day is the 6th of November, is it not? It\nis now near ten o’clock; she will have my despatch at noon. That will\ngive her time enough to pack her trunks and to take the eight o’clock\nexpress this evening, which will bring her to Marseilles in time for\nbreakfast. But as there is no train which connects with it, she cannot\nbe here until to-morrow, the 7th, at five o’clock.”",
        "After folding the despatch he rose:",
        "“My God, at five o’clock to-morrow! How long to wait still! What shall\nI do with myself until then?”",
        "Then a sudden recollection filled him with anxiety, and he became\ngrave.",
        "“Ramond, my comrade, will you give me a great proof of your friendship\nby being perfectly frank with me?”",
        "“How so, master?”",
        "“Ah, you understand me very well. The other day you examined me. Do\nyou think I can live another year?”",
        "He fixed his eyes on the young man as he spoke, compelling him to look\nat him. Ramond evaded a direct answer, however, with a jest–was it\nreally a physician who put such a question?",
        "“Let us be serious, Ramond, I beg of you.”",
        "Then Ramond answered in all sincerity that, in his opinion, the doctor\nmight very justly entertain the hope of living another year. He gave\nhis reasons–the comparatively slight progress which the sclerosis had\nmade, and the absolute soundness of the other organs. Of course they\nmust make allowance for what they did not and could not know, for a\nsudden accident was always possible. And the two men discussed the\ncase as if they been in consultation at the bedside of a patient,\nweighing the pros and cons, each stating his views and prognosticating\na fatal termination, in accordance with the symptoms as defined by the\nbest authorities.",
        "Pascal, as if it were some one else who was in question, had recovered\nall his composure and his heroic self-forgetfulness.",
        "“Yes,” he murmured at last, “you are right; a year of life is still\npossible. Ah, my friend, how I wish I might live two years; a mad\nwish, no doubt, an eternity of joy. And yet, two years, that would not\nbe impossible. I had a very curious case once, a wheelwright of the\nfaubourg, who lived for four years, giving the lie to all my\nprognostications. Two years, two years, I will live two years! I must\nlive two years!”",
        "Ramond sat with bent head, without answering. He was beginning to be\nuneasy, fearing that he had shown himself too optimistic; and the\ndoctor’s joy disquieted and grieved him, as if this very exaltation,\nthis disturbance of a once strong brain, warned him of a secret and\nimminent danger.",
        "“Did you not wish to send that despatch at once?” he said.",
        "“Yes, yes, go quickly, my good Ramond, and come back again to see us\nthe day after to-morrow. She will be here then, and I want you to come\nand embrace us.”",
        "The day was long, and the following morning, at about four o’clock,\nshortly after Pascal had fallen asleep, after a happy vigil filled\nwith hopes and dreams, he was wakened by a dreadful attack. He felt as\nif an enormous weight, as if the whole house, had fallen down upon his\nchest, so that the thorax, flattened down, touched the back. He could\nnot breathe; the pain reached the shoulders, then the neck, and\nparalyzed the left arm. But he was perfectly conscious; he had the\nfeeling that his heart was about to stop, that life was about to leave\nhim, in the dreadful oppression, like that of a vise, which was\nsuffocating him. Before the attack reached its height he had the\nstrength to rise and to knock on the floor with a stick for Martine.\nThen he fell back on his bed, unable to speak or to move, and covered\nwith a cold sweat.",
        "Martine, fortunately, in the profound silence of the empty house,\nheard the knock. She dressed herself, wrapped a shawl about her, and\nwent upstairs, carrying her candle. The darkness was still profound;\ndawn was about to break. And when she perceived her master, whose eyes\nalone seemed living, looking at her with locked jaws, speechless, his\nface distorted by pain, she was awed and terrified, and she could only\nrush toward the bed crying:",
        "“My God! My God! what is the matter, monsieur? Answer me, monsieur,\nyou frighten me!”",
        "For a full minute Pascal struggled in vain to recover his breath.\nThen, the viselike pressure on his chest relaxing slowly, he murmured\nin a faint voice:",
        "“The five thousand francs in the desk are Clotilde’s. Tell her that\nthe affair of the notary is settled, that she will recover from it\nenough to live upon.”",
        "Then Martine, who had listened to him in open-mouthed wonder,\nconfessed the falsehood she had told him, ignorant of the good news\nthat had been brought by Ramond.",
        "“Monsieur, you must forgive me; I told you an untruth. But it would be\nwrong to deceive you longer. When I saw you alone and so unhappy, I\ntook some of my own money.”",
        "“My poor girl, you did that!”",
        "“Oh, I had some hope that monsieur would return it to me one day.”",
        "By this time the attack had passed off, and he was able to turn his\nhead and look at her. He was amazed and moved. What was passing in the\nheart of this avaricious old maid, who for thirty years had been\nsaving up her treasure painfully, who had never taken a sou from it,\neither for herself or for any one else? He did not yet comprehend, but\nhe wished to show himself kind and grateful.",
        "“You are a good woman, Martine. All that will be returned to you. I\ntruly think I am going to die–”",
        "She did not allow him to finish, her whole being rose up in rebellious\nprotest.",
        "“Die; you, monsieur! Die before me! I do not wish it. I will not let\nyou die!”",
        "She threw herself on her knees beside the bed; she caught him wildly\nin her arms, feeling him, to see if he suffered, holding him as if she\nthought that death would not dare to take him from her.",
        "“You must tell me what is the matter with you. I will take care of\nyou. I will save you. If it were necessary to give my life for you, I\nwould give it, monsieur. I will sit up day and night with you. I am\nstrong still; I will be stronger than the disease, you shall see. To\ndie! to die! oh, no, it cannot be! The good God cannot wish so great\nan injustice. I have prayed so much in my life that he ought to listen\nto me a little now, and he will grant my prayer, monsieur; he will\nsave you.”",
        "Pascal looked at her, listened to her, and a sudden light broke in\nupon his mind. She loved him, this miserable woman; she had always\nloved him. He thought of her thirty years of blind devotion, her mute\nadoration, when she had waited upon him, on her knees, as it were,\nwhen she was young; her secret jealousy of Clotilde later; what she\nmust have secretly suffered all that time! And she was here on her\nknees now again, beside his deathbed; her hair gray; her eyes the\ncolor of ashes in her pale nun-like face, dulled by her solitary life.\nAnd he felt that she was unconscious of it all; that she did not even\nknow with what sort of love she loved him, loving him only for the\nhappiness of loving him: of being with him, and of waiting on him.",
        "Tears rose to Pascal’s eyes; a dolorous pity and an infinite human\ntenderness flowed from his poor, half-broken heart.",
        "“My poor girl,” he said, “you are the best of girls. Come, embrace me,\nas you love me, with all your strength.”",
        "She, too, sobbed. She let her gray head, her face worn by her long\nservitude, fall on her master’s breast. Wildly she kissed him, putting\nall her life into the kiss.",
        "“There, let us not give way to emotion, for you see we can do nothing;\nthis will be the end, just the same. If you wish me to love you, obey\nme. Now that I am better, that I can breathe easier, do me the favor\nto run to Dr. Ramond’s. Waken him and bring him back with you.”",
        "She was leaving the room when he called to her, seized by a sudden\nfear.",
        "“And remember, I forbid you to go to inform my mother.”",
        "She turned back, embarrassed, and in a voice of entreaty, said:",
        "“Oh, monsieur, Mme. Felicite has made me promise so often–”",
        "But he was inflexible. All his life he had treated his mother with\ndeference, and he thought he had acquired the right to defend himself\nagainst her in the hour of his death. He would not let the servant go\nuntil she had promised him that she would be silent. Then he smiled\nonce more.",
        "“Go quickly. Oh, you will see me again; it will not be yet.”",
        "Day broke at last, the melancholy dawn of the pale November day.\nPascal had had the shutters opened, and when he was left alone he\nwatched the brightening dawn, doubtless that of his last day of life.\nIt had rained the night before, and the mild sun was still veiled by\nclouds. From the plane trees came the morning carols of the birds,\nwhile far away in the sleeping country a locomotive whistled with a\nprolonged moan. And he was alone; alone in the great melancholy house,\nwhose emptiness he felt around him, whose silence he heard. The light\nslowly increased, and he watched the patches it made on the\nwindow-panes broadening and brightening. Then the candle paled in the\ngrowing light, and the whole room became visible. And with the dawn, as\nhe had anticipated, came relief. The sight of the familiar objects\naround him brought him consolation.",
        "But Pascal, although the attack had passed away, still suffered\nhorribly. A sharp pain remained in the hollow of his chest, and his\nleft arm, benumbed, hung from his shoulder like lead. In his long\nwaiting for the help that Martine had gone to bring, he had reflected\non the suffering which made the flesh cry out. And he found that he\nwas resigned; he no longer felt the rebelliousness which the mere\nsight of physical pain had formerly awakened in him. It had\nexasperated him, as if it had been a monstrous and useless cruelty of\nnature. In his doubts as a physician, he had attended his patients\nonly to combat it, and to relieve it. If he ended by accepting it, now\nthat he himself suffered its horrible torture, was it that he had\nrisen one degree higher in his faith of life, to that serene height\nwhence life appeared altogether good, even with the fatal condition of\nsuffering attached to it; suffering which is perhaps its spring? Yes,\nto live all of life, to live it and to suffer it all without\nrebellion, without believing that it is made better by being made\npainless, this presented itself clearly to his dying eyes, as the\ngreatest courage and the greatest wisdom. And to cheat pain while he\nwaited, he reviewed his latest theories; he dreamed of a means of\nutilizing suffering by transforming it into action, into work. If it\nbe true that man feels pain more acutely according as he rises in the\nscale of civilization, it is also certain that he becomes stronger\nthrough it, better armed against it, more capable of resisting it. The\norgan, the brain which works, develops and grows stronger, provided\nthe equilibrium between the sensations which it receives and the work\nwhich it gives back be not broken. Might not one hope, then, for a\nhumanity in which the amount of work accomplished would so exactly\nequal the sum of sensations received, that suffering would be utilized\nand, as it were, abolished?",
        "The sun had risen, and Pascal was confusedly revolving these distant\nhopes in his mind, in the drowsiness produced by his disease, when he\nfelt a new attack coming on. He had a moment of cruel anxiety–was\nthis the end? Was he going to die alone? But at this instant hurried\nfootsteps mounted the stairs, and a moment later Ramond entered,\nfollowed by Martine. And the patient had time to say before the attack\nbegan:",
        "“Quick! quick! a hypodermic injection of pure water.”",
        "Unfortunately the doctor had to look for the little syringe and then\nto prepare everything. This occupied some minutes, and the attack was\nterrible. He followed its progress with anxiety–the face becoming\ndistorted, the lips growing livid. Then when he had given the\ninjection, he observed that the phenomena, for a moment stationary,\nslowly diminished in intensity. Once more the catastrophe was averted.",
        "As soon as he recovered his breath Pascal, glancing at the clock, said\nin his calm, faint voice:",
        "“My friend, it is seven o’clock–in twelve hours, at seven o’clock\nto-night, I shall be dead.”",
        "And as the young man was about to protest, to argue the question,\n\"No,” he resumed, “do not try to deceive me. You have witnessed the\nattack. You know what it means as well as I do. Everything will now\nproceed with mathematical exactness; and, hour by hour, I could\ndescribe to you the phases of the disease.”",
        "He stopped, gasped for breath, and then added:",
        "“And then, all is well; I am content. Clotilde will be here at five;\nall I ask is to see her and to die in her arms.”",
        "A few moments later, however, he experienced a sensible improvement.\nThe effect of the injection seemed truly miraculous; and he was able\nto sit up in bed, his back resting against the pillows. He spoke\nclearly, and with more ease, and never had the lucidity of his mind\nappeared greater.",
        "“You know, master,” said, Ramond, “that I will not leave you. I have\ntold my wife, and we will spend the day together; and, whatever you\nmay say to the contrary, I am very confident that it will not be the\nlast. You will let me make myself at home, here, will you not?”",
        "Pascal smiled, and gave orders to Martine to go and prepare breakfast\nfor Ramond, saying that if they needed her they would call her. And\nthe two men remained alone, conversing with friendly intimacy; the one\nwith his white hair and long white beard, lying down, discoursing like\na sage, the other sitting at his bedside, listening with the respect\nof a disciple.",
        "“In truth,” murmured the master, as if he were speaking to himself,\n\"the effect of those injections is extraordinary.”",
        "Then in a stronger voice, he said almost gaily:",
        "“My friend Ramond, it may not be a very great present that I am giving\nyou, but I am going to leave you my manuscripts. Yes, Clotilde has\norders to send them to you when I shall be no more. Look through them,\nand you will perhaps find among them things that are not so very bad.\nIf you get a good idea from them some day–well, that will be so much\nthe better for the world.”",
        "And then he made his scientific testament. He was clearly conscious\nthat he had been himself only a solitary pioneer, a precursor,\nplanning theories which he tried to put in practise, but which failed\nbecause of the imperfection of his method. He recalled his enthusiasm\nwhen he believed he had discovered, in his injections of nerve\nsubstance, the universal panacea, then his disappointments, his fits\nof despair, the shocking death of Lafouasse, consumption carrying off\nValentin in spite of all his efforts, madness again conquering Sarteur\nand causing him to hang himself. So that he would depart full of\ndoubt, having no longer the confidence necessary to the physician, and\nso enamored of life that he had ended by putting all his faith in it,\ncertain that it must draw from itself alone its health and strength.\nBut he did not wish to close up the future; he was glad, on the\ncontrary, to bequeath his hypotheses to the younger generation. Every\ntwenty years theories changed; established truths only, on which\nscience continued to build, remained unshaken. Even if he had only the\nmerit of giving to science a momentary hypothesis, his work would not\nbe lost, for progress consisted assuredly in the effort, in the onward\nmarch of the intellect.",
        "And then who could say that he had died in vain, troubled and weary,\nhis hopes concerning the injections unrealized–other workers would\ncome, young, ardent, confident, who would take up the idea, elucidate\nit, expand it. And perhaps a new epoch, a new world would date from\nthis.",
        "“Ah, my dear Ramond,” he continued, “if one could only live life over\nagain. Yes, I would take up my idea again, for I have been struck\nlately by the singular efficacy of injections even of pure water. It\nis not the liquid, then, that matters, but simply the mechanical\naction. During the last month I have written a great deal on that\nsubject. You will find some curious notes and observations there. In\nshort, I should be inclined to put all my faith in work, to place\nhealth in the harmonious working of all the organs, a sort of dynamic\ntherapeutics, if I may venture to use the expression.”",
        "He had gradually grown excited, forgetting his approaching death in\nhis ardent curiosity about life. And he sketched, with broad strokes,\nhis last theory. Man was surrounded by a medium–nature–which\nirritated by perpetual contact the sensitive extremities of the\nnerves. Hence the action, not only of the senses, but of the entire\nsurface of the body, external and internal. For it was these\nsensations which, reverberating in the brain, in the marrow, and in\nthe nervous centers, were there converted into tonicity, movements,\nand thoughts; and he was convinced that health consisted in the\nnatural progress of this work, in receiving sensations, and in giving\nthem back in thoughts and in actions, the human machine being thus fed\nby the regular play of the organs. Work thus became the great law, the\nregulator of the living universe. Hence it became necessary if the\nequilibrium were broken, if the external excitations ceased to be\nsufficient, for therapeutics to create artificial excitations, in\norder to reestablish the tonicity which is the state of perfect\nhealth. And he dreamed of a whole new system of treatment–suggestion,\nthe all-powerful authority of the physician, for the senses;\nelectricity, friction, massage for the skin and for the tendons; diet\nfor the stomach; air cures on high plateaus for the lungs, and,\nfinally, transfusion, injections of distilled water, for the\ncirculatory system. It was the undeniable and purely mechanical action\nof these latter that had put him on the track; all he did now was to\nextend the hypothesis, impelled by his generalizing spirit; he saw the\nworld saved anew in this perfect equilibrium, as much work given as\nsensation received, the balance of the world restored by unceasing\nlabor.",
        "Here he burst into a frank laugh.",
        "“There! I have started off again. I, who was firmly convinced that the\nonly wisdom was not to interfere, to let nature take its course. Ah,\nwhat an incorrigible old fool I am!”",
        "Ramond caught his hands in an outburst of admiration and affection.",
        "“Master, master! it is of enthusiasm, of folly like yours that genius\nis made. Have no fear, I have listened to you, I will endeavor to be\nworthy of the heritage you leave; and I think, with you, that perhaps\nthe great future lies entirely there.”",
        "In the sad and quiet room Pascal began to speak again, with the\ncourageous tranquillity of a dying philosopher giving his last lesson.\nHe now reviewed his personal observations; he said that he had often\ncured himself by work, regular and methodical work, not carried to\nexcess. Eleven o’clock struck; he urged Ramond to take his breakfast,\nand he continued the conversation, soaring to lofty and distant\nheights, while Martine served the meal. The sun had at last burst\nthrough the morning mists, a sun still half-veiled in clouds, and\nmild, whose golden light warmed the room. Presently, after taking a\nfew sips of milk, Pascal remained silent.",
        "At this moment the young physician was eating a pear.",
        "“Are you in pain again?” he asked.",
        "“No, no; finish.”",
        "But he could not deceive Ramond. It was an attack, and a terrible one.\nThe suffocation came with the swiftness of a thunderbolt, and he fell\nback on the pillow, his face already blue. He clutched at the\nbedclothes to support himself, to raise the dreadful weight which\noppressed his chest. Terrified, livid, he kept his wide open eyes\nfixed upon the clock, with a dreadful expression of despair and grief;\nand for ten minutes it seemed as if every moment must be his last.",
        "Ramond had immediately given him a hypodermic injection. The relief\nwas slow to come, the efficacy less than before.",
        "When Pascal revived, large tears stood in his eyes. He did not speak\nnow, he wept. Presently, looking at the clock with his darkening\nvision, he said:",
        "“My friend, I shall die at four o’clock; I shall not see her.”",
        "And as his young colleague, in order to divert his thoughts, declared,\nin spite of appearances, that the end was not so near, Pascal, again\nbecoming enthusiastic, wished to give him a last lesson, based on\ndirect observation. He had, as it happened, attended several cases\nsimilar to his own, and he remembered especially to have dissected at\nthe hospital the heart of a poor old man affected with sclerosis.",
        "“I can see it–my heart. It is the color of a dead leaf; its fibers\nare brittle, wasted, one would say, although it has augmented slightly\nin volume. The inflammatory process has hardened it; it would be\ndifficult to cut–”",
        "He continued in a lower voice. A little before, he had felt his heart\ngrowing weaker, its contractions becoming feebler and slower. Instead\nof the normal jet of blood there now issued from the aorta only a red\nfroth. Back of it all the veins were engorged with black blood; the\nsuffocation increased, according as the lift and force pump, the\nregulator of the whole machine, moved more slowly. And after the\ninjection he had been able to follow in spite of his suffering the\ngradual reviving of the organ as the stimulus set it beating again,\nremoving the black venous blood, and sending life into it anew, with\nthe red arterial blood. But the attack would return as soon as the\nmechanical effect of the injection should cease. He could predict it\nalmost within a few minutes. Thanks to the injections he would have\nthree attacks more. The third would carry him off; he would die at\nfour o’clock.",
        "Then, while his voice grew gradually weaker, in a last outburst of\nenthusiasm, he apostrophized the courage of the heart, that persistent\nlife maker, working ceaselessly, even during sleep, when the other\norgans rested.",
        "“Ah, brave heart! how heroically you struggle! What faithful, what\ngenerous muscles, never wearied! You have loved too much, you have\nbeat too fast in the past months, and that is why you are breaking\nnow, brave heart, who do not wish to die, and who strive rebelliously\nto beat still!”",
        "But now the first of the attacks which had been announced came on.\nPascal came out of this panting, haggard, his speech sibilant and\npainful. Low moans escaped him, in spite of his courage. Good God!\nwould this torture never end? And yet his most ardent desire was to\nprolong his agony, to live long enough to embrace Clotilde a last\ntime. If he might only be deceiving himself, as Ramond persisted in\ndeclaring. If he might only live until five o’clock. His eyes again\nturned to the clock, they never now left the hands, every minute\nseeming an eternity. They marked three o’clock. Then half-past three.\nAh, God! only two hours of life, two hours more of life. The sun was\nalready sinking toward the horizon; a great calm descended from the\npale winter sky, and he heard at intervals the whistles of the distant\nlocomotives crossing the bare plain. The train that was passing now\nwas the one going to the Tulettes; the other, the one coming from\nMarseilles, would it never arrive, then!",
        "At twenty minutes to four Pascal signed to Ramond to approach. He\ncould no longer speak loud enough to be heard.",
        "“You see, in order that I might live until six o’clock, the pulse\nshould be stronger. I have still some hope, however, but the second\nmovement is almost imperceptible, the heart will soon cease to beat.”",
        "And in faint, despairing accents he called on Clotilde again and\nagain. The immeasurable grief which he felt at not being able to see\nher again broke forth in this faltering and agonized appeal. Then his\nanxiety about his manuscripts returned, an ardent entreaty shone in\nhis eyes, until at last he found the strength to falter again:",
        "“Do not leave me; the key is under my pillow; tell Clotilde to take\nit; she has my directions.”",
        "At ten minutes to four another hypodermic injection was given, but\nwithout effect. And just as four o’clock was striking, the second\nattack declared itself. Suddenly, after a fit of suffocation, he threw\nhimself out of bed; he desired to rise, to walk, in a last revival of\nhis strength. A need of space, of light, of air, urged him toward the\nskies. Then there came to him an irresistible appeal from life, his\nwhole life, from the adjoining workroom, where he had spent his days.\nAnd he went there, staggering, suffocating, bending to the left side,\nsupporting himself by the furniture.",
        "Dr. Ramond precipitated himself quickly toward him to stop him,\ncrying:",
        "“Master, master! lie down again, I entreat you!”",
        "But Pascal paid no heed to him, obstinately determined to die on his\nfeet. The desire to live, the heroic idea of work, alone survived in\nhim, carrying him onward bodily. He faltered hoarsely:",
        "“No, no–out there, out there–”",
        "His friend was obliged to support him, and he walked thus, stumbling\nand haggard, to the end of the workroom, and dropped into his chair\nbeside his table, on which an unfinished page still lay among a\nconfusion of papers and books.",
        "Here he gasped for breath and his eyes closed. After a moment he\nopened them again, while his hands groped about, seeking his work, no\ndoubt. They encountered the genealogical tree in the midst of other\npapers scattered about. Only two days before he had corrected some\ndates in it. He recognized it, and drawing it toward him, spread it\nout.",
        "“Master, master! you will kill yourself!” cried Ramond, overcome with\npity and admiration at this extraordinary spectacle.",
        "Pascal did not listen, did not hear. He felt a pencil under his\nfingers. He took it and bent over the tree, as if his dying eyes no\nlonger saw. The name of Maxime arrested his attention, and he wrote:\n\"Died of ataxia in 1873,” in the certainty that his nephew would not\nlive through the year. Then Clotilde’s name, beside it, struck him and\nhe completed the note thus: “Has a son, by her Uncle Pascal, in 1874.\"\nBut it was his own name that he sought wearily and confusedly. When he\nat last found it his hand grew firmer, and he finished his note, in\nupright and bold characters: “Died of heart disease, November 7,\n1873.” This was the supreme effort, the rattle in his throat\nincreased, everything was fading into nothingness, when he perceived\nthe blank leaf above Clotilde’s name. His vision grew dark, his\nfingers could no longer hold the pencil, but he was still able to add,\nin unsteady letters, into which passed the tortured tenderness, the\nwild disorder of his poor heart: “The unknown child, to be born in\n1874. What will it be?” Then he swooned, and Martine and Ramond with\ndifficulty carried him back to bed.",
        "The third attack came on about four o’clock. In this last access of\nsuffocation Pascal’s countenance expressed excruciating suffering.\nDeath was to be very painful; he must endure to the end his martyrdom,\nas a man and a scientist. His wandering gaze still seemed to seek the\nclock, to ascertain the hour. And Ramond, seeing his lips move, bent\ndown and placed his ear to the mouth of the dying man. The latter, in\neffect, was stammering some vague words, so faint that they scarcely\nrose above a breath:",
        "“Four o’clock–the heart is stopping; no more red blood in the aorta–\nthe valve relaxes and bursts.”",
        "A dreadful spasm shook him; his breathing grew fainter.",
        "“Its progress is too rapid. Do not leave me; the key is under the\npillow–Clotilde, Clotilde–”",
        "At the foot of the bed Martine was kneeling, choked with sobs. She saw\nwell that monsieur was dying. She had not dared to go for a priest\nnotwithstanding her great desire to do so; and she was herself\nreciting the prayers for the dying; she prayed ardently that God would\npardon monsieur, and that monsieur might go straight to Paradise.",
        "Pascal was dying. His face was quite blue. After a few seconds of\nimmobility, he tried to breathe: he put out his lips, opened his poor\nmouth, like a little bird opening its beak to get a last mouthful of\nair. And he was dead.",
        "It was not until after breakfast, at about one o’clock, that Clotilde\nreceived the despatch. On this day it had chanced that she had\nquarreled with her brother Maxime, who, taking advantage of his\nprivileges as an invalid, had tormented her more and more every day by\nhis unreasonable caprices and his outbursts of ill temper. In short,\nher visit to him had not proved a success. He found that she was too\nsimple and too serious to cheer him; and he had preferred, of late,\nthe society of Rose, the fair-haired young girl, with the innocent\nlook, who amused him. So that when his sister told him that their\nuncle had sent for her, and that she was going away, he gave his\napproval at once, and although he asked her to return as soon as she\nshould have settled her affairs at home, he did so only with the\ndesire of showing himself amiable, and he did not press the\ninvitation.",
        "Clotilde spent the afternoon in packing her trunks. In the feverish\nexcitement of so sudden a decision she had thought of nothing but the\njoy of her return. But after the hurry of dinner was over, after she\nhad said good-by to her brother, after the interminable drive in a\nhackney coach along the avenue of the Bois de Boulogne to the Lyons\nrailway station, when she found herself in the ladies’ compartment,\nstarting on the long journey on a cold and rainy November night,\nalready rolling away from Paris, her excitement began to abate, and\nreflections forced their way into her mind and began to trouble her.\nWhy this brief and urgent despatch: “I await you; start this evening.\"\nDoubtless it was the answer to her letter; but she knew how greatly\nPascal had desired that she should remain in Paris, where he thought\nshe was happy, and she was astonished at his hasty summons. She had\nnot expected a despatch, but a letter, arranging for her return a few\nweeks later. There must be something else, then; perhaps he was ill\nand felt a desire, a longing to see her again at once. And from this\ntime forward this fear seized her with the force of a presentiment,\nand grew stronger and stronger, until it soon took complete possession\nof her.",
        "All night long the rain beat furiously against the windows of the\ntrain while they were crossing the plains of Burgundy, and did not\ncease until they reached Macon. When they had passed Lyons the day\nbroke. Clotilde had Pascal’s letters with her, and she had waited\nimpatiently for the daylight that she might read again carefully these\nletters, the writing of which had seemed changed to her. And noticing\nthe unsteady characters, the breaks in the words, she felt a chill at\nher heart. He was ill, very ill–she had become certain of this now,\nby a divination in which there was less of reasoning than of subtle\nprescience. And the rest of the journey seemed terribly long, for her\nanguish increased in proportion as she approached its termination. And\nworse than all, arriving at Marseilles at half-past twelve, there was\nno train for Plassans until twenty minutes past three. Three long\nhours of waiting! She breakfasted at the buffet in the railway\nstation, eating hurriedly, as if she was afraid of missing this train;\nthen she dragged herself into the dusty garden, going from bench to\nbench in the pale, mild sunshine, among omnibuses and hackney coaches.\nAt last she was once more in the train, which stopped at every little\nway station. When they were approaching Plassans she put her head out\nof the window eagerly, longing to see the town again after her short\nabsence of two months. It seemed to her as if she had been away for\ntwenty years, and that everything must be changed. When the train was\nleaving the little station of Sainte-Marthe her emotion reached its\nheight when, leaning out, she saw in the distance La Souleiade with\nthe two secular cypresses on the terrace, which could be seen three\nleagues off.",
        "It was five o’clock, and twilight was already falling. The train\nstopped, and Clotilde descended. But it was a surprise and a keen\ngrief to her not to see Pascal waiting for her on the platform. She\nhad been saying to herself since they had left Lyons: “If I do not see\nhim at once, on the arrival of the train, it will be because he is\nill.” He might be in the waiting-room, however, or with a carriage\noutside. She hurried forward, but she saw no one but Father Durieu, a\ndriver whom the doctor was in the habit of employing. She questioned\nhim eagerly. The old man, a taciturn Provencal, was in no haste to\nanswer. His wagon was there, and he asked her for the checks for her\nluggage, wishing to see about the trunks before anything else. In a\ntrembling voice she repeated her question:",
        "“Is everybody well, Father Durieu?”",
        "“Yes, mademoiselle.”",
        "And she was obliged to put question after question to him before she\nsucceeded in eliciting the information that it was Martine who had\ntold him, at about six o’clock the day before, to be at the station\nwith his wagon, in time to meet the train. He had not seen the doctor,\nno one had seen him, for two months past. It might very well be since\nhe was not here that he had been obliged to take to his bed, for there\nwas a report in the town that he was not very well.",
        "“Wait until I get the luggage, mademoiselle,” he ended, “there is room\nfor you on the seat.”",
        "“No, Father Durieu, it would be too long to wait. I will walk.”",
        "She ascended the slope rapidly. Her heart was so tightened that she\ncould scarcely breathe. The sun had sunk behind the hills of\nSainte-Marthe, and a fine mist was falling from the chill gray November\nsky, and as she took the road to Les Fenouilleres she caught another\nglimpse of La Souleiade, which struck a chill to her heart–the front of\nthe house, with all its shutters closed, and wearing a look of\nabandonment and desolation in the melancholy twilight.",
        "But Clotilde received the final and terrible blow when she saw Ramond\nstanding at the hall door, apparently waiting for her. He had indeed\nbeen watching for her, and had come downstairs to break the dreadful\nnews gently to her. She arrived out of breath; she had crossed the\nquincunx of plane trees near the fountain to shorten the way, and on\nseeing the young man there instead of Pascal, whom she had in spite of\neverything expected to see, she had a presentiment of overwhelming\nruin, of irreparable misfortune. Ramond was pale and agitated,\nnotwithstanding the effort he made to control his feelings. At the\nfirst moment he could not find a word to say, but waited to be\nquestioned. Clotilde, who was herself suffocating, said nothing. And\nthey entered the house thus; he led her to the dining-room, where they\nremained for a few seconds, face to face, in mute anguish.",
        "“He is ill, is he not?” she at last faltered.",
        "“Yes,” he said, “he is ill.”",
        "“I knew it at once when I saw you,” she replied. “I knew when he was\nnot here that he must be ill. He is very ill, is he not?” she\npersisted.",
        "As he did not answer but grew still paler, she looked at him fixedly.\nAnd on the instant she saw the shadow of death upon him; on his hands\nthat still trembled, that had assisted the dying man; on his sad face;\nin his troubled eyes, which still retained the reflection of the death\nagony; in the neglected and disordered appearance of the physician\nwho, for twelve hours, had maintained an unavailing struggle against\ndeath.",
        "She gave a loud cry:",
        "“He is dead!”",
        "She tottered, and fell fainting into the arms of Ramond, who with a\ngreat sob pressed her in a brotherly embrace. And thus they wept on\neach other’s neck.",
        "When he had seated her in a chair, and she was able to speak, he said:",
        "“It was I who took the despatch you received to the telegraph office\nyesterday, at half-past ten o’clock. He was so happy, so full of hope!\nHe was forming plans for the future–a year, two years of life. And\nthis morning, at four o’clock, he had the first attack, and he sent\nfor me. He saw at once that he was doomed, but he expected to last\nuntil six o’clock, to live long enough to see you again. But the\ndisease progressed too rapidly. He described its progress to me,\nminute by minute, like a professor in the dissecting room. He died\nwith your name upon his lips, calm, but full of anguish, like a hero.”",
        "Clotilde listened, her eyes drowned in tears which flowed endlessly.\nEvery word of the relation of this piteous and stoical death\npenetrated her heart and stamped itself there. She reconstructed every\nhour of the dreadful day. She followed to its close its grand and\nmournful drama. She would live it over in her thoughts forever.",
        "But her despairing grief overflowed when Martine, who had entered the\nroom a moment before, said in a harsh voice:",
        "“Ah, mademoiselle has good reason to cry! for if monsieur is dead,\nmademoiselle is to blame for it.”",
        "The old servant stood apart, near the door of her kitchen, in such a\npassion of angry grief, because they had taken her master from her,\nbecause they had killed him, that she did not even try to find a word\nof welcome or consolation for this child whom she had brought up. And\nwithout calculating the consequences of her indiscretion, the grief or\nthe joy which she might cause, she relieved herself by telling all she\nknew.",
        "“Yes, if monsieur has died, it is because mademoiselle went away.”",
        "From the depths of her overpowering grief Clotilde protested. She had\nexpected to see Martine weeping with her, like Ramond, and she was\nsurprised to feel that she was an enemy.",
        "“Why, it was he who would not let me stay, who insisted upon my going\naway,” she said.",
        "“Oh, well! mademoiselle must have been willing to go or she would have\nbeen more clear-sighted. The night before your departure I found\nmonsieur half-suffocated with grief; and when I wished to inform\nmademoiselle, he himself prevented me; he had such courage. Then I\ncould see it all, after mademoiselle had gone. Every night it was the\nsame thing over again, and he could hardly keep from writing to you to\ncome back. In short, he died of it, that is the pure truth.”",
        "A great light broke in on Clotilde’s mind, making her at the same time\nvery happy and very wretched. Good God! what she had suspected for a\nmoment, was then true. Afterward she had been convinced, seeing\nPascal’s angry persistence, that he was speaking the truth; that\nbetween her and work he had chosen work sincerely, like a man of\nscience with whom love of work has gained the victory over the love of\nwoman. And yet he had not spoken the truth; he had carried his\ndevotion, his self-forgetfulness to the point of immolating himself to\nwhat he believed to be her happiness. And the misery of things willed\nthat he should have been mistaken, that he should have thus\nconsummated the unhappiness of both.",
        "Clotilde again protested wildly:",
        "“But how could I have known? I obeyed; I put all my love in my\nobedience.”",
        "“Ah,” cried Martine again, “it seems to me that I should have\nguessed.”",
        "Ramond interposed gently. He took Clotilde’s hands once more in his,\nand explained to her that grief might indeed have hastened the fatal\nissue, but that the master had unhappily been doomed for some time\npast. The affection of the heart from which he had suffered must have\nbeen of long standing–a great deal of overwork, a certain part of\nheredity, and, finally, his late absorbing love, and the poor heart\nhad broken.",
        "“Let us go upstairs,” said Clotilde simply. “I wish to see him.”",
        "Upstairs in the death-chamber the blinds were closed, shutting out\neven the melancholy twilight. On a little table at the foot of the bed\nburned two tapers in two candlesticks. And they cast a pale yellow\nlight on Pascal’s form extended on the bed, the feet close together,\nthe hands folded on the breast. The eyes had been piously closed. The\nface, of a bluish hue still, but already looking calm and peaceful,\nframed by the flowing white hair and beard, seemed asleep. He had been\ndead scarcely an hour and a half, yet already infinite serenity,\neternal silence, eternal repose, had begun.",
        "Seeing him thus, at the thought that he no longer heard her, that he\nno longer saw her, that she was alone now, that she was to kiss him\nfor the last time, and then lose him forever, Clotilde, in an outburst\nof grief, threw herself upon the bed, and in broken accents of\npassionate tenderness cried:",
        "“Oh, master, master, master–”",
        "She pressed her lips to the dead man’s forehead, and, feeling it still\nwarm with life, she had a momentary illusion: she fancied that he felt\nthis last caress, so cruelly awaited. Did he not smile in his\nimmobility, happy at last, and able to die, now that he felt her here\nbeside him? Then, overcome by the dreadful reality, she burst again\ninto wild sobs.",
        "Martine entered, bringing a lamp, which she placed on a corner of the\nchimney-piece, and she heard Ramond, who was watching Clotilde,\ndisquieted at seeing her passionate grief, say:",
        "“I shall take you away from the room if you give way like this.\nConsider that you have some one else to think of now.”",
        "The servant had been surprised at certain words which she had\noverheard by chance during the day. Suddenly she understood, and she\nturned paler even than before, and on her way out of the room, she\nstopped at the door to hear more.",
        "“The key of the press is under his pillow,” said Ramond, lowering his\nvoice; “he told me repeatedly to tell you so. You know what you have\nto do?”",
        "Clotilde made an effort to remember and to answer.",
        "“What I have to do? About the papers, is it not? Yes, yes, I remember;\nI am to keep the envelopes and to give you the other manuscripts. Have\nno fear, I am quite calm, I will be very reasonable. But I will not\nleave him; I will spend the night here very quietly, I promise you.”",
        "She was so unhappy, she seemed so resolved to watch by him, to remain\nwith him, until he should be taken away, that the young physician\nallowed her to have her way.",
        "“Well, I will leave you now. They will be expecting me at home. Then\nthere are all sorts of formalities to be gone through–to give notice\nat the mayor’s office, the funeral, of which I wish to spare you the\ndetails. Trouble yourself about nothing. Everything will be arranged\nto-morrow when I return.”",
        "He embraced her once more and then went away. And it was only then\nthat Martine left the room, behind him, and locking the hall door she\nran out into the darkness.",
        "Clotilde was now alone in the chamber; and all around and about her,\nin the unbroken silence, she felt the emptiness of the house. Clotilde\nwas alone with the dead Pascal. She placed a chair at the head of the\nbed and sat there motionless, alone. On arriving, she had merely\nremoved her hat: now, perceiving that she still had on her gloves, she\ntook them off also. But she kept on her traveling dress, crumpled and\ndusty, after twenty hours of railway travel. No doubt Father Durieu\nhad brought the trunks long ago, and left them downstairs. But it did\nnot occur to her, nor had she the strength to wash herself and change\nher clothes, but remained sitting, overwhelmed with grief, on the\nchair into which she had dropped. One regret, a great remorse, filled\nher to the exclusion of all else. Why had she obeyed him? Why had she\nconsented to leave him? If she had remained she had the ardent\nconviction that he would not have died. She would have lavished so\nmuch love, so many caresses upon him, that she would have cured him.\nIf one was anxious to keep a beloved being from dying one should\nremain with him and, if necessary, give one’s heart’s blood to keep\nhim alive. It was her own fault if she had lost him, if she could not\nnow with a caress awaken him from his eternal sleep. And she thought\nherself imbecile not to have understood; cowardly, not to have devoted\nherself to him; culpable, and to be forever punished for having gone\naway when plain common sense, in default of feeling, ought to have\nkept her here, bound, as a submissive and affectionate subject, to the\ntask of watching over her king.",
        "The silence had become so complete, so profound, that Clotilde lifted\nher eyes for a moment from Pascal’s face to look around the room. She\nsaw only vague shadows–the two tapers threw two yellow patches on the\nhigh ceiling. At this moment she remembered the letters he had written\nto her, so short, so cold; and she comprehended his heroic sacrifice,\nthe torture it had been to him to silence his heart, desiring to\nimmolate himself to the end. What strength must he not have required\nfor the accomplishment of the plan of happiness, sublime and\ndisastrous, which he had formed for her. He had resolved to pass out\nof her life in order to save her from his old age and his poverty; he\nwished her to be rich and free, to enjoy her youth, far away from him;\nthis indeed was utter self-effacement, complete absorption in the love\nof another. And she felt a profound gratitude, a sweet solace in the\nthought, mingled with a sort of angry bitterness against evil fortune.\nThen, suddenly, the happy years of her childhood and her long youth\nspent beside him who had always been so kind and so good-humored, rose\nbefore her–how he had gradually won her affection, how she had felt\nthat she was his, after the quarrels which had separated them for a\ntime, and with what a transport of joy she had at last given herself\nto him.",
        "Seven o’clock struck. Clotilde started as the clear tones broke the\nprofound silence. Who was it that had spoken? Then she remembered, and\nshe looked at the clock. And when the last sound of the seven strokes,\neach of which had fallen like a knell upon her heart, had died away,\nshe turned her eyes again on the motionless face of Pascal, and once\nmore she abandoned herself to her grief.",
        "It was in the midst of this ever-increasing prostration that Clotilde,\na few minutes later, heard a sudden sound of sobbing. Some one had\nrushed into the room; she looked round and saw her Grandmother\nFelicite. But she did not stir, she did not speak, so benumbed was she\nwith grief. Martine, anticipating the orders which Clotilde would\nundoubtedly have given her, had hurried to old Mme. Rougon’s, to give\nher the dreadful news; and the latter, dazed at first by the\nsuddenness of the catastrophe, and afterward greatly agitated, had\nhurried to the house, overflowing with noisy grief. She burst into\ntears at sight of her son, and then embraced Clotilde, who returned\nher kiss, as in a dream. And from this instant the latter, without\nemerging from the overwhelming grief in which she isolated herself,\nfelt that she was no longer alone, hearing a continual stir and bustle\ngoing on around her. It was Felicite crying, coming in and going out\non tiptoe, setting things in order, spying about, whispering, dropping\ninto a chair, to get up again a moment afterward, after saying that\nshe was going to die in it. At nine o’clock she made a last effort to\npersuade her granddaughter to eat something. Twice already she had\nlectured her in a low voice; she came now again to whisper to her:",
        "“Clotilde, my dear, I assure you you are wrong. You must keep up your\nstrength or you will never be able to hold out.”",
        "But the young woman, with a shake of her head, again refused.",
        "“Come, you breakfasted at the buffet at Marseilles, I suppose, but you\nhave eaten nothing since. Is that reasonable? I do not wish you to\nfall ill also. Martine has some broth. I have told her to make a light\nsoup and to roast a chicken. Go down and eat a mouthful, only a\nmouthful, and I will remain here.”",
        "With the same patient gesture Clotilde again refused. At last she\nfaltered:",
        "“Do not ask me, grandmother, I entreat you. I could not; it would\nchoke me.”",
        "She did not speak again, falling back into her former state of apathy.\nShe did not sleep, however, her wide open eyes were fixed persistently\non Pascal’s face. For hours she sat there, motionless, erect, rigid,\nas if her spirit were far away with the dead. At ten o’clock she heard\na noise; it was Martine bringing up the lamp. Toward eleven Felicite,\nwho was sitting watching in an armchair, seemed to grow restless, got\nup and went out of the room, and came back again. From this forth\nthere was a continual coming and going as of impatient footsteps\nprowling around the young woman, who was still awake, her large eyes\nfixed motionless on Pascal. Twelve o’clock struck, and one persistent\nthought alone pierced her weary brain, like a nail, and prevented\nsleep–why had she obeyed him? If she had remained she would have\nrevived him with her youth, and he would not have died. And it was not\nuntil a little before one that she felt this thought, too, grow\nconfused and lose itself in a nightmare. And she fell into a heavy\nsleep, worn out with grief and fatigue.",
        "When Martine had announced to Mme. Rougon the unexpected death of her\nson Pascal, in the shock which she received there was as much of anger\nas of grief. What! her dying son had not wished to see her; he had\nmade this servant swear not to inform her of his illness! This thought\nsent the blood coursing swiftly through her veins, as if the struggle\nbetween them, which had lasted during his whole life, was to be\ncontinued beyond the grave. Then, when after hastily dressing herself\nshe had hurried to La Souleiade, the thought of the terrible\nenvelopes, of all the manuscripts piled up in the press, had filled\nher with trembling rage. Now that Uncle Macquart and Aunt Dide were\ndead, she no longer feared what she called the abomination of the\nTulettes; and even poor little Charles, in dying, had carried with him\none of the most humiliating of the blots on the family. There remained\nonly the envelopes, the abominable envelopes, to menace the glorious\nRougon legend which she had spent her whole life in creating, which\nwas the sole thought of her old age, the work to the triumph of which\nshe had persistently devoted the last efforts of her wily and active\nbrain. For long years she had watched these envelopes, never wearying,\nbeginning the struggle over again, when he had thought her beaten,\nalways alert and persistent. Ah! if she could only succeed in\nobtaining possession of them and destroying them! It would be the\nexecrable past destroyed, effaced; it would be the glory of her\nfamily, so hardly won, at last freed from all fear, at last shining\nuntarnished, imposing its lie upon history. And she saw herself\ntraversing the three quarters of Plassans, saluted by every one,\nbearing herself as proudly as a queen, mourning nobly for the fallen\nEmpire. So that when Martine informed her that Clotilde had come, she\nquickened her steps as she approached La Souleiade, spurred by the\nfear of arriving too late.",
        "But as soon as she was installed in the house, Felicite at once\nregained her composure. There was no hurry, they had the whole night\nbefore them. She wished, however, to win over Martine without delay,\nand she knew well how to influence this simple creature, bound up in\nthe doctrines of a narrow religion. Going down to the kitchen, then,\nto see the chicken roasting, she began by affecting to be heartbroken\nat the thought of her son dying without having made his peace with the\nChurch. She questioned the servant, pressing her for particulars. But\nthe latter shook her head disconsolately–no, no priest had come,\nmonsieur had not even made the sign of the cross. She, only, had knelt\ndown to say the prayers for the dying, which certainly could not be\nenough for the salvation of a soul. And yet with what fervor she had\nprayed to the good God that monsieur might go straight to Paradise!",
        "With her eyes fixed on the chicken turning on the spit, before a\nbright fire, Felicite resumed in a lower voice, with an absorbed air:",
        "“Ah, my poor girl, what will most prevent him from going to Paradise\nare the abominable papers which the unhappy man has left behind him up\nthere in the press. I cannot understand why it is that lightning from\nheaven has not struck those papers before this and reduced them to\nashes. If they are allowed to leave this house it will be ruin and\ndisgrace and eternal perdition!”",
        "Martine listened, very pale.",
        "“Then madame thinks it would be a good work to destroy them, a work\nthat would assure the repose of monsieur’s soul?”",
        "“Great God! Do I believe it! Why, if I had those dreadful papers in my\nhands, I would throw every one of them into the fire. Oh, you would\nnot need then to put on any more sticks; with the manuscripts upstairs\nalone you would have fuel enough to roast three chickens like that.”",
        "The servant took a long spoon and began to baste the fowl. She, too,\nseemed now to reflect.",
        "“Only we haven’t got them. I even overheard some words on the subject,\nwhich I may repeat to madame. It was when mademoiselle went upstairs.\nDr. Raymond spoke to her about the papers, asking her if she\nremembered some orders which she had received, before she went away,\nno doubt; and she answered that she remembered, that she was to keep\nthe envelopes and to give him all the other manuscripts.”",
        "Felicite trembled; she could not restrain a terrified movement.\nAlready she saw the papers slipping out of her reach; and it was not\nthe envelopes only which she desired, but all the manuscripts, all\nthat unknown, suspicious, and secret work, from which nothing but\nscandal could come, according to the obtuse and excitable mind of the\nproud old bourgeoise.",
        "“But we must act!” she cried, “act immediately, this very night!\nTo-morrow it may be too late.”",
        "“I know where the key of the press is,” answered Martine in a low\nvoice. “The doctor told mademoiselle.”",
        "Felicite immediately pricked up her ears.",
        "“The key; where is it?”",
        "“Under the pillow, under monsieur’s head.”",
        "In spite of the bright blaze of the fire of vine branches the air\nseemed to grow suddenly chill, and the two old women were silent. The\nonly sound to be heard was the drip of the chicken juice falling into\nthe pan.",
        "But after Mme. Rougon had eaten a hasty and solitary dinner she went\nupstairs again with Martine. Without another word being spoken they\nunderstood each other, it was decided that they would use all possible\nmeans to obtain possession of the papers before daybreak. The simplest\nwas to take the key from under the pillow. Clotilde would no doubt at\nlast fall asleep–she seemed too exhausted not to succumb to fatigue.\nAll they had to do was to wait. They set themselves to watch, then,\ngoing back and forth on tiptoe between the study and the bedroom,\nwaiting for the moment when the young woman’s large motionless eyes\nshould close in sleep. One of them would go to see, while the other\nwaited impatiently in the study, where a lamp burned dully on the\ntable. This was repeated every fifteen minutes until midnight. The\nfathomless eyes, full of gloom and of an immense despair, did not\nclose. A little before midnight Felicite installed herself in an\narmchair at the foot of the bed, resolved not to leave the spot until\nher granddaughter should have fallen asleep. From this forth she did\nnot take her eyes off Clotilde, and it filled her with a sort of fear\nto remark that the girl scarcely moved her eyelids, looking with that\ninconsolable fixity which defies sleep. Then she herself began to feel\nsleep stealing over her. Exasperated, trembling with nervous\nimpatience, she could remain where she was no longer. And she went to\nrejoin the servant, who was watching in the study.",
        "“It is useless; she will not sleep,” she said in a stifled and\ntrembling voice. “We must find some other way.”",
        "It had indeed occurred to her to break open the press.",
        "But the old oaken boards were strong, the old iron held firmly. How\ncould they break the lock–not to speak of the noise they would make\nand which would certainly be heard in the adjoining room?",
        "She stood before the thick doors, however, and felt them with her\nfingers, seeking some weak spot.",
        "“If I only had an instrument,” she said.",
        "Martine, less eager, interrupted her, objecting: “Oh, no, no, madame!\nWe might be surprised! Wait, I will go again and see if mademoiselle\nis asleep now.”",
        "She went to the bedroom on tiptoe and returned immediately, saying:",
        "“Yes, she is asleep. Her eyes are closed, and she does not stir.”",
        "Then both went to look at her, holding their breath and walking with\nthe utmost caution, so that the boards might not creak. Clotilde had\nindeed just fallen asleep: and her stupor seemed so profound that the\ntwo old women grew bold. They feared, however, that they might touch\nand waken her, for her chair stood close beside the bed. And then, to\nput one’s hand under a dead man’s pillow to rob him was a terrible and\nsacrilegious act, the thought of which filled them with terror. Might\nit not disturb his repose? Might he not move at the shock? The thought\nmade them turn pale.",
        "Felicite had advanced with outstretched hand, but she drew back,\nstammering:",
        "“I am too short. You try, Martine.”",
        "The servant in her turn approached the bed. But she was seized with\nsuch a fit of trembling that she was obliged to retreat lest she\nshould fall.",
        "“No, no, I cannot!” she said. “It seems to me that monsieur is going\nto open his eyes.”",
        "And trembling and awe-struck they remained an instant longer in the\nlugubrious chamber full of the silence and the majesty of death,\nfacing Pascal, motionless forever, and Clotilde, overwhelmed by the\ngrief of her widowhood. Perhaps they saw, glorifying that mute head,\nguarding its work with all its weight, the nobility of a life spent in\nhonorable labor. The flame of the tapers burned palely. A sacred awe\nfilled the air, driving them from the chamber.",
        "Felicite, who was so brave, who had never in her life flinched from\nanything, not even from bloodshed, fled as if she was pursued, saying:",
        "“Come, come, Martine, we will find some other way; we will go look for\nan instrument.”",
        "In the study they drew a breath of relief. Felicite looked in vain\namong the papers on Pascal’s work-table for the genealogical tree,\nwhich she knew was usually there. She would so gladly have begun her\nwork of destruction with this. It was there, but in her feverish\nexcitement she did not perceive it.",
        "Her desire drew her back again to the press, and she stood before it,\nmeasuring it and examining it with eager and covetous look. In spite\nof her short stature, in spite of her eighty-odd years, she displayed\nan activity and an energy that were truly extraordinary.",
        "“Ah!” she repeated, “if I only had an instrument!”",
        "And she again sought the crevice in the colossus, the crack into which\nshe might introduce her fingers, to break it open. She imagined plans\nof assault, she thought of using force, and then she fell back on\nstratagem, on some piece of treachery which would open to her the\ndoors, merely by breathing upon them.",
        "Suddenly her glance kindled; she had discovered the means.",
        "“Tell me, Martine; there is a hook fastening one of the doors, is\nthere not?”",
        "“Yes, madame; it catches in a ring above the middle shelf. See, it is\nabout the height of this molding.”",
        "Felicite made a triumphant gesture.",
        "“Have you a gimlet–a large gimlet? Give me a gimlet!”",
        "Martine went down into her kitchen and brought back the tool that had\nbeen asked.",
        "“In that way, you see, we shall make no noise,” resumed the old woman,\nsetting herself to her task.",
        "With a strength which one would not have suspected in her little\nhands, withered by age, she inserted the gimlet, and made a hole at\nthe height indicated by the servant. But it was too low; she felt the\npoint, after a time, entering the shelf. A second attempt brought the\ninstrument in direct contact with the iron hook. This time the hole\nwas too near. And she multiplied the holes to right and left, until\nfinally she succeeded in pushing the hook out of the ring. The bolt of\nthe lock slipped, and both doors opened.",
        "“At last!” cried Felicite, beside herself.",
        "Then she remained motionless for a moment, her ear turned uneasily\ntoward the bedroom, fearing that she had wakened Clotilde. But silence\nreigned throughout the dark and sleeping house. There came from the\nbedroom only the august peace of death; she heard nothing but the\nclear vibration of the clock; Clotilde fell asleep near one. And the\npress yawned wide open, displaying the papers with which it\noverflowed, heaped up on its three shelves. Then she threw herself\nupon it, and the work of destruction began, in the midst of the sacred\nobscurity of the infinite repose of this funereal vigil.",
        "“At last!” she repeated, in a low voice, “after thirty years of\nwaiting. Let us hurry–let us hurry. Martine, help me!”",
        "She had already drawn forward the high chair of the desk, and mounted\non it at a bound, to take down, first of all, the papers on the top\nshelf, for she remembered that the envelopes were there. But she was\nsurprised not to see the thick blue paper wrappers; there was nothing\nthere but bulky manuscripts, the doctor’s completed but unpublished\nworks, works of inestimable value, all his researches, all his\ndiscoveries, the monument of his future fame, which he had left in\nRamond’s charge. Doubtless, some days before his death, thinking that\nonly the envelopes were in danger, and that no one in the world would\nbe so daring as to destroy his other works, he had begun to classify\nand arrange the papers anew, and removed the envelopes out of sight.",
        "“Ah, so much the worse!” murmured Felicite; “let us begin anywhere;\nthere are so many of them that if we wish to get through we must\nhurry. While I am up here, let us clear these away forever. Here,\ncatch Martine!”",
        "And she emptied the shelf, throwing the manuscripts, one by one, into\nthe arms of the servant, who laid them on the table with as little\nnoise as possible. Soon the whole heap was on it, and Felicite sprang\ndown from the chair.",
        "“To the fire! to the fire! We shall lay our hands on the others, and\ntoo, by and by, on those I am looking for. These can go into it,\nmeantime. It will be a good riddance, at any rate, a fine clearance,\nyes, indeed! To the fire, to the fire with them all, even to the\nsmallest scrap of paper, even to the most illegible scrawl, if we wish\nto be certain of destroying the contamination of evil.”",
        "She herself, fanatical and fierce, in her hatred of the truth, in her\neagerness to destroy the testimony of science, tore off the first page\nof one of the manuscripts, lighted it at the lamp, and then threw this\nburning brand into the great fireplace, in which there had not been a\nfire for perhaps twenty years, and she fed the fire, continuing to\nthrow on it the rest of the manuscript, piece by piece. The servant,\nas determined as herself, came to her assistance, taking another\nenormous notebook, which she tore up leaf by leaf. From this forth the\nfire did not cease to burn, filling the wide fireplace with a bright\nblaze, with tongues of flame that seemed to die away from time to\ntime, only to burn up more brightly than ever when fresh fuel fed\nthem. The fire grew larger, the heap of ashes rose higher and higher–\na thick bed of blackened leaves among which ran millions of sparks.\nBut it was a long, a never-ending task; for when several pages were\nthrown on at a time, they would not burn; it was necessary to move\nthem and turn them over with the tongs; the best way was to stir them\nup and then wait until they were in a blaze, before adding more. The\nwomen soon grew skilful at their task, and the work progressed at a\nrapid rate.",
        "In her haste to get a fresh armful of papers Felicite stumbled against\na chair.",
        "“Oh, madame, take care,” said Martine. “Some one might come!”",
        "“Come? who should come? Clotilde? She is too sound asleep, poor girl.\nAnd even if any one should come, once it is finished, I don’t care; I\nwon’t hide myself, you may be sure; I shall leave the empty press\nstanding wide open; I shall say aloud that it is I who have purified\nthe house. When there is not a line of writing left, ah, good heavens!\nI shall laugh at everything else!”",
        "For almost two hours the fireplace blazed. They went back to the press\nand emptied the two other shelves, and now there remained only the\nbottom, which was heaped with a confusion of papers. Little by little,\nintoxicated by the heat of the bonfire, out of breath and perspiring,\nthey gave themselves up to the savage joy of destruction. They stooped\ndown, they blackened their hands, pushing in the partially consumed\nfragments, with gestures so violent, so feverishly excited, that their\ngray locks fell in disorder over their shoulders. It was like a dance\nof witches, feeding a hellish fire for some abominable act–the\nmartyrdom of a saint, the burning of written thought in the public\nsquare; a whole world of truth and hope destroyed. And the blaze of\nthis fire, which at moments made the flame of the lamp grow pale,\nlighted up the vast apartment, and made the gigantic shadows of the\ntwo women dance upon the ceiling.",
        "But as she was emptying the bottom of the press, after having burned,\nhandful by handful, the papers with which it had been filled, Felicite\nuttered a stifled cry of triumph.",
        "“Ah, here they are! To the fire! to the fire!”",
        "She had at last come upon the envelopes. Far back, behind the rampart\nformed by the notes, the doctor had hidden the blue paper wrappers.\nAnd then began a mad work of havoc, a fury of destruction; the\nenvelopes were gathered up in handfuls and thrown into the flames,\nfilling the fireplace with a roar like that of a conflagration.",
        "“They are burning, they are burning! They are burning at last! Here is\nanother, Martine, here is another. Ah, what a fire, what a glorious\nfire!”",
        "But the servant was becoming uneasy.",
        "“Take care, madame, you are going to set the house on fire. Don’t you\nhear that roar?”",
        "“Ah! what does that matter? Let it all burn. They are burning, they\nare burning; what a fine sight! Three more, two more, and, see, now\nthe last is burning!”",
        "She laughed with delight, beside herself, terrible to see, when some\nfragment of lighted soot fell down. The roar was becoming more and\nmore fierce; the chimney, which was never swept, had caught fire. This\nseemed to excite her still more, while the servant, losing her head,\nbegan to scream and run about the room.",
        "Clotilde slept beside the dead Pascal, in the supreme calm of the\nbedroom, unbroken save by the light vibration of the clock striking\nthe hours. The tapers burned with a tall, still flame, the air was\nmotionless. And yet, in the midst of her heavy, dreamless sleep, she\nheard, as in a nightmare, a tumult, an ever-increasing rush and roar.\nAnd when she opened her eyes she could not at first understand. Where\nwas she? Why this enormous weight that crushed her heart? She came\nback to reality with a start of terror–she saw Pascal, she heard\nMartine’s cries in the adjoining room, and she rushed out, in alarm,\nto learn their cause.",
        "But at the threshold Clotilde took in the whole scene with cruel\ndistinctness–the press wide open and completely empty; Martine\nmaddened by her fear of fire; Felicite radiant, pushing into the\nflames with her foot the last fragments of the envelopes. Smoke and\nflying soot filled the study, where the roaring of the fire sounded\nlike the hoarse gasping of a murdered man–the fierce roar which she\nhad just heard in her sleep.",
        "And the cry which sprang from her lips was the same cry that Pascal\nhimself had uttered on the night of the storm, when he surprised her\nin the act of stealing his papers.",
        "“Thieves! assassins!”",
        "She precipitated herself toward the fireplace, and, in spite of the\ndreadful roaring of the flames, in spite of the falling pieces of\nsoot, at the risk of setting her hair on fire, and of burning her\nhands, she gathered up the leaves which remained yet unconsumed and\nbravely extinguished them, pressing them against her. But all this was\nvery little, only some debris; not a complete page remained, not\neven a few fragments of the colossal labor, of the vast and patient\nwork of a lifetime, which the fire had destroyed there in two hours.\nAnd with growing anger, in a burst of furious indignation, she cried:",
        "“You are thieves, assassins! It is a wicked murder which you have just\ncommitted. You have profaned death, you have slain the mind, you have\nslain genius.”",
        "Old Mme. Rougon did not quail. She advanced, on the contrary, feeling\nno remorse, her head erect, defending the sentence of destruction\npronounced and executed by her.",
        "“It is to me you are speaking, to your grandmother. Is there nothing,\nthen, that you respect? I have done what I ought to have done, what\nyou yourself wished to do with us before.”",
        "“Before, you had made me mad; but since then I have lived, I have\nloved, I have understood, and it is life that I defend. Even if it be\nterrible and cruel, the truth ought to be respected. Besides, it was a\nsacred legacy bequeathed to my protection, the last thoughts of a dead\nman, all that remained of a great mind, and which I should have\nobliged every one to respect. Yes, you are my grandmother; I am well\naware of it, and it is as if you had just burned your son!”",
        "“Burn Pascal because I have burned his papers!” cried Felicite. “Do\nyou not know that I would have burned the town to save the honor of\nour family!”",
        "She continued to advance, belligerent and victorious; and Clotilde,\nwho had laid on the table the blackened fragments rescued by her from\nthe burning flames, protected them with her body, fearing that her\ngrandmother would throw them back again into the fire. She regarded\nthe two women scornfully; she did not even trouble herself about the\nfire in the fireplace, which fortunately went out of itself, while\nMartine extinguished with the shovel the burning soot and the last\nflames of the smoldering ashes.",
        "“You know very well, however,” continued the old woman, whose little\nfigure seemed to grow taller, “that I have had only one ambition, one\npassion in life–to see our family rich and powerful. I have fought, I\nhave watched all my life, I have lived as long as I have done, only to\nput down ugly stories and to leave our name a glorious one. Yes, I\nhave never despaired; I have never laid down my arms; I have been\ncontinually on the alert, ready to profit by the slightest\ncircumstance. And all I desired to do I have done, because I have\nknown how to wait.”",
        "And she waved her hand toward the empty press and the fireplace, where\nthe last sparks were dying out.",
        "“Now it is ended, our honor is safe; those abominable papers will no\nlonger accuse us, and I shall leave behind me nothing to be feared.\nThe Rougons have triumphed.”",
        "Clotilde, in a frenzy of grief, raised her arm, as if to drive her out\nof the room. But she left it of her own accord, and went down to the\nkitchen to wash her blackened hands and to fasten up her hair. The\nservant was about to follow her when, turning her head, she saw her\nyoung mistress’ gesture, and she returned.",
        "“Oh! as for me, mademoiselle, I will go away the day after to-morrow,\nwhen monsieur shall be in the cemetery.”",
        "There was a moment’s silence.",
        "“But I am not sending you away, Martine. I know well that it is not\nyou who are most to blame. You have lived in this house for thirty\nyears. Remain, remain with me.”",
        "The old maid shook her gray head, looking very pale and tired.",
        "“No, I have served monsieur; I will serve no one after monsieur.”",
        "“But I!”",
        "“You, no!”",
        "Clotilde looked embarrassed, hesitated a moment, and remained silent.\nBut Martine understood; she too seemed to reflect for an instant, and\nthen she said distinctly:",
        "“I know what you would say, but–no!”",
        "And she went on to settle her account, arranging the affair like a\npractical woman who knew the value of money.",
        "“Since I have the means, I will go and live quietly on my income\nsomewhere. As for you, mademoiselle, I can leave you, for you are not\npoor. M. Ramond will explain to you to-morrow how an income of four\nthousand francs was saved for you out of the money at the notary’s.\nMeantime, here is the key of the desk, where you will find the five\nthousand francs which monsieur left there. Oh? I know that there will\nbe no trouble between us. Monsieur did not pay me for the last three\nmonths; I have papers from him which prove it. In addition, I advanced\nlately almost two hundred francs out of my own pocket, without his\nknowing where the money came from. It is all written down; I am not at\nall uneasy; mademoiselle will not wrong me by a centime. The day after\nto-morrow, when monsieur is no longer here, I will go away.”",
        "Then she went down to the kitchen, and Clotilde, in spite of the\nfanaticism of this woman, which had made her take part in a crime,\nfelt inexpressibly sad at this desertion. When she was gathering up\nthe fragments of the papers, however, before returning to the bedroom,\nshe had a thrill of joy, on suddenly seeing the genealogical tree,\nwhich the two women had not perceived, lying unharmed on the table. It\nwas the only entire document saved from the wreck. She took it and\nlocked it, with the half-consumed fragments, in the bureau in the\nbedroom.",
        "But when she found herself again in this august chamber a great\nemotion took possession of her. What supreme calm, what immortal\npeace, reigned here, beside the savage destruction that had filled the\nadjoining room with smoke and ashes. A sacred serenity pervaded the\nobscurity; the two tapers burned with a pure, still, unwavering flame.\nThen she saw that Pascal’s face, framed in his flowing white hair and\nbeard, had become very white. He slept with the light falling upon\nhim, surrounded by a halo, supremely beautiful. She bent down, kissed\nhim again, felt on her lips the cold of the marble face, with its\nclosed eyelids, dreaming its dream of eternity. Her grief at not being\nable to save the work which he had left to her care was so\noverpowering that she fell on her knees and burst into a passion of\nsobs. Genius had been violated; it seemed to her as if the world was\nabout to be destroyed in this savage destruction of a whole life of\nlabor.",
        "In the study Clotilde was buttoning her dress, holding her child, whom\nshe had been nursing, still in her lap. It was after lunch, about\nthree o’clock on a hot sunny day at the end of August, and through the\ncrevices of the carefully closed shutters only a few scattered\nsunbeams entered, piercing the drowsy and warm obscurity of the vast\napartment. The rest and peace of the Sunday seemed to enter and\ndiffuse itself in the room with the last sounds of the distant vesper\nbell. Profound silence reigned in the empty house in which the mother\nand child were to remain alone until dinner time, the servant having\nasked permission to go see a cousin in the faubourg.",
        "For an instant Clotilde looked at her child, now a big boy of three\nmonths. She had been wearing mourning for Pascal for almost ten months\n–a long and simple black gown, in which she looked divinely\nbeautiful, with her tall, slender figure and her sad, youthful face\nsurrounded by its aureole of fair hair. And although she could not\nsmile, it filled her with sweet emotion to see the beautiful child, so\nplump and rosy, with his mouth still wet with milk, whose gaze had\nbeen arrested by the sunbeam full of dancing motes. His eyes were\nfixed wonderingly on the golden brightness, the dazzling miracle of\nlight. Then sleep came over him, and he let his little, round, bare\nhead, covered thinly with fair hair, fall back on his mother’s arm.",
        "Clotilde rose softly and laid him in the cradle, which stood beside\nthe table. She remained leaning over him for an instant to assure\nherself that he was asleep; then she let down the curtain in the\nalready darkened room. Then she busied herself with supple and\nnoiseless movements, walking with so light a step that she scarcely\ntouched the floor, in putting away some linen which was on the table.\nTwice she crossed the room in search of a little missing sock. She was\nvery silent, very gentle, and very active. And now, in the solitude of\nthe house, she fell into a reverie and all the past year arose before\nher.",
        "First, after the dreadful shock of the funeral, came the departure of\nMartine, who had obstinately kept to her determination of going away\nat once, not even remaining for the customary week, bringing to\nreplace her the young cousin of a baker in the neighborhood–a stout\nbrunette, who fortunately proved very neat and faithful. Martine\nherself lived at Sainte-Marthe, in a retired corner, so penuriously\nthat she must be still saving even out of her small income. She was\nnot known to have any heir. Who, then, would profit by this\nmiserliness? In ten months she had not once set foot in La Souleiade–\nmonsieur was not there, and she had not even the desire to see\nmonsieur’s son.",
        "Then in Clotilde’s reverie rose the figure of her grandmother\nFelicite. The latter came to see her from time to time with the\ncondescension of a powerful relation who is liberal-minded enough to\npardon all faults when they have been cruelly expiated. She would come\nunexpectedly, kiss the child, moralize, and give advice, and the young\nmother had adopted toward her the respectful attitude which Pascal had\nalways maintained. Felicite was now wholly absorbed in her triumph.\nShe was at last about to realize a plan that she had long cherished\nand maturely deliberated, which would perpetuate by an imperishable\nmonument the untarnished glory of the family. The plan was to devote\nher fortune, which had become considerable, to the construction and\nendowment of an asylum for the aged, to be called Rougon Asylum. She\nhad already bought the ground, a part of the old mall outside the\ntown, near the railway station; and precisely on this Sunday, at five\no’clock, when the heat should have abated a little, the first stone\nwas to be laid, a really solemn ceremony, to be honored by the\npresence of all the authorities, and of which she was to be the\nacknowledged queen, before a vast concourse of people.",
        "Clotilde felt, besides, some gratitude toward her grandmother, who had\nshown perfect disinterestedness on the occasion of the opening of\nPascal’s will. The latter had constituted the young woman his sole\nlegatee; and the mother, who had a right to a fourth part, after\ndeclaring her intention to respect her son’s wishes, had simply\nrenounced her right to the succession. She wished, indeed, to\ndisinherit all her family, bequeathing to them glory only, by\nemploying her large fortune in the erection of this asylum, which was\nto carry down to future ages the revered and glorious name of the\nRougons; and after having, for more than half a century, so eagerly\nstriven to acquire money, she now disdained it, moved by a higher and\npurer ambition. And Clotilde, thanks to this liberality, had no\nuneasiness regarding the future–the four thousand francs income would\nbe sufficient for her and her child. She would bring him up to be a\nman. She had sunk the five thousand francs that she had found in the\ndesk in an annuity for him; and she owned, besides, La Souleiade,\nwhich everybody advised her to sell. True, it cost but little to keep\nit up, but what a sad and solitary life she would lead in that great\ndeserted house, much too large for her, where she would be lost. Thus\nfar, however, she had not been able to make up her mind to leave it.\nPerhaps she would never be able to do so.",
        "Ah, this La Souleiade! all her love, all her life, all her memories\nwere centered in it. It seemed to her at times as if Pascal were\nliving here still, for she had changed nothing of their former manner\nof living. The furniture remained in the same places, the hours were\nthe same, the habits the same. The only change she had made was to\nlock his room, into which only she went, as into a sanctuary, to weep\nwhen she felt her heart too heavy. And although indeed she felt very\nlonely, very lost, at each meal in the bright dining-room downstairs,\nin fancy she heard there the echoes of their laughter, she recalled\nthe healthy appetite of her youth; when they two had eaten and drank\nso gaily, rejoicing in their existence. And the garden, too, the whole\nplace was bound up with the most intimate fibers of her being, for she\ncould not take a step in it that their united images did not appear\nbefore her–on the terrace; in the slender shadow of the great secular\ncypresses, where they had so often contemplated the valley of the\nViorne, closed in by the ridges of the Seille and the parched hills of\nSainte-Marthe; the stone steps among the puny olive and almond trees,\nwhich they had so often challenged each other to run up in a trial of\nspeed, like boys just let loose from school; and there was the pine\ngrove, too, the warm, embalsamed shade, where the needles crackled\nunder their feet; the vast threshing yard, carpeted with soft grass,\nwhere they could see the whole sky at night, when the stars were\ncoming out; and above all there were the giant plane trees, whose\ndelightful shade they had enjoyed every day in summer, listening to\nthe soothing song of the fountain, the crystal clear song which it had\nsung for centuries. Even to the old stones of the house, even to the\nearth of the grounds, there was not an atom at La Souleiade in which\nshe did not feel a little of their blood warmly throbbing, with which\nshe did not feel a little of their life diffused and mingled.",
        "But she preferred to spend her days in the workroom, and here it was\nthat she lived over again her best hours. There was nothing new in it\nbut the cradle. The doctor’s table was in its place before the window\nto the left–she could fancy him coming in and sitting down at it, for\nhis chair had not even been moved. On the long table in the center,\namong the old heap of books and papers, there was nothing new but the\ncheerful note of the little baby linen, which she was looking over.\nThe bookcases displayed the same rows of volumes; the large oaken\npress seemed to guard within its sides the same treasure, securely\nshut in. Under the smoky ceiling the room was still redolent of work,\nwith its confusion of chairs, the pleasant disorder of this common\nworkroom, filled with the caprices of the girl and the researches of\nthe scientist. But what most moved her to-day was the sight of her old\npastels hanging against the wall, the copies which she had made of\nliving flowers, scrupulously exact copies, and of dream flowers of an\nimaginary world, whither her wild fancy sometimes carried her.",
        "Clotilde had just finished arranging the little garments on the table\nwhen, lifting her eyes, she perceived before her the pastel of old\nKing David, with his hand resting on the shoulder of Abishag the young\nShunammite. And she, who now never smiled, felt her face flush with a\nthrill of tender and pleasing emotion. How they had loved each other,\nhow they had dreamed of an eternity of love the day on which she had\namused herself painting this proud and loving allegory! The old king,\nsumptuously clad in a robe hanging in straight folds, heavy with\nprecious stones, wore the royal bandeau on his snowy locks; but she\nwas more sumptuous still, with only her tall slender figure, her\ndelicate round throat, and her supple arms, divinely graceful. Now he\nwas gone, he was sleeping under the ground, while she, her pure and\ntriumphant beauty concealed by her black robes, had only her child to\nexpress the love she had given him before the assembled people, in the\nfull light of day.",
        "Then Clotilde sat down beside the cradle. The slender sunbeams\nlengthened, crossing the room from end to end, the heat of the warm\nafternoon grew oppressive in the drowsy obscurity made by the closed\nshutters, and the silence of the house seemed more profound than\nbefore. She set apart some little waists, she sewed on some tapes with\nslow-moving needle, and gradually she fell into a reverie in the warm\ndeep peacefulness of the room, in the midst of the glowing heat\noutside. Her thoughts first turned to her pastels, the exact copies\nand the fantastic dream flowers; she said to herself now that all her\ndual nature was to be found in that passion for truth, which had at\ntimes kept her a whole day before a flower in order to copy it with\nexactness, and in her need of the spiritual, which at other times took\nher outside the real, and carried her in wild dreams to the paradise\nof flowers such as had never grown on earth. She had always been thus.\nShe felt that she was in reality the same to-day as she had been\nyesterday, in the midst of the flow of new life which ceaselessly\ntransformed her. And then she thought of Pascal, full of gratitude\nthat he had made her what she was. In days past when, a little girl,\nhe had removed her from her execrable surroundings and taken her home\nwith him, he had undoubtedly followed the impulses of his good heart,\nbut he had also undoubtedly desired to try an experiment with her, to\nsee how she would grow up in the different environment, in an\natmosphere of truthfulness and affection. This had always been an idea\nof his. It was an old theory of his which he would have liked to test\non a large scale: culture through environment, complete regeneration\neven, the improvement, the salvation of the individual, physically as\nwell as morally. She owed to him undoubtedly the best part of her\nnature; she guessed how fanciful and violent she might have become,\nwhile he had made her only enthusiastic and courageous.",
        "In this retrospection she was clearly conscious of the gradual change\nthat had taken place within her. Pascal had corrected her heredity,\nand she lived over again the slow evolution, the struggle between the\nfantastic and the real in her. It had begun with her outbursts of\nanger as a child, a ferment of rebellion, a want of mental balance\nthat had caused her to indulge in most hurtful reveries. Then came her\nfits of extreme devotion, the need of illusion and falsehood, of\nimmediate happiness in the thought that the inequalities and\ninjustices of this wicked world would he compensated by the eternal\njoys of a future paradise. This was the epoch of her struggles with\nPascal, of the torture which she had caused him, planning to destroy\nthe work of his genius. And at this point her nature had changed; she\nhad acknowledged him for her master. He had conquered her by the\nterrible lesson of life which he had given her on the night of the\nstorm. Then, environment had acted upon her, evolution had proceeded\nrapidly, and she had ended by becoming a well-balanced and rational\nwoman, willing to live life as it ought to be lived, satisfied with\ndoing her work in the hope that the sum of the common labor would one\nday free the world from evil and pain. She had loved, she was a mother\nnow, and she understood.",
        "Suddenly she remembered the night which they had spent in the\nthreshing yard. She could still hear her lamentation under the stars–\nthe cruelty of nature, the inefficacy of science, the wickedness of\nhumanity, and the need she felt of losing herself in God, in the\nUnknown. Happiness consisted in self-renunciation. Then she heard him\nrepeat his creed–the progress of reason through science, truths\nacquired slowly and forever the only possible good, the belief that\nthe sum of these truths, always augmenting, would finally confer upon\nman incalculable power and peace, if not happiness. All was summed up\nin his ardent faith in life. As he expressed it, it was necessary to\nmarch with life, which marched always. No halt was to be expected, no\npeace in immobility and renunciation, no consolation in turning back.\nOne must keep a steadfast soul, the only ambition to perform one’s\nwork, modestly looking for no other reward of life than to have lived\nit bravely, accomplishing the task which it imposes. Evil was only an\naccident not yet explained, humanity appearing from a great height\nlike an immense wheel in action, working ceaselessly for the future.\nWhy should the workman who disappeared, having finished his day’s\nwork, abuse the work because he could neither see nor know its end?\nEven if it were to have no end why should he not enjoy the delight of\naction, the exhilarating air of the march, the sweetness of sleep\nafter the fatigue of a long and busy day? The children would carry on\nthe task of the parents; they were born and cherished only for this,\nfor the task of life which is transmitted to them, which they in their\nturn will transmit to others. All that remained, then, was to be\ncourageously resigned to the grand common labor, without the rebellion\nof the ego, which demands personal happiness, perfect and complete.",
        "She questioned herself, and she found that she did not experience that\nanguish which had filled her formerly at the thought of what was to\nfollow death. This anxiety about the Beyond no longer haunted her\nuntil it became a torture. Formerly she would have liked to wrest by\nforce from heaven the secrets of destiny. It had been a source of\ninfinite grief to her not to know why she existed. Why are we born?\nWhat do we come on earth to do? What is the meaning of this execrable\nexistence, without equality, without justice, which seemed to her like\na fevered dream? Now her terror was calmed; she could think of these\nthings courageously. Perhaps it was her child, the continuation of\nherself, which now concealed from her the horror of her end. But her\nregular life contributed also to this, the thought that it was\nnecessary to live for the effort of living, and that the only peace\npossible in this world was in the joy of the accomplishment of this\neffort. She repeated to herself a remark of the doctor, who would\noften say when he saw a peasant returning home with a contented look\nafter his day’s work: “There is a man whom anxiety about the Beyond\nwill not prevent from sleeping.” He meant to say that this anxiety\ntroubles and perverts only excitable and idle brains. If all performed\ntheir healthful task, all would sleep peacefully at night. She herself\nhad felt the beneficent power of work in the midst of her sufferings\nand her grief. Since he had taught her to employ every one of her\nhours; since she had been a mother, especially, occupied constantly\nwith her child, she no longer felt a chill of horror when she thought\nof the Unknown. She put aside without an effort disquieting reveries;\nand if she still felt an occasional fear, if some of her daily griefs\nmade her sick at heart, she found comfort and unfailing strength in\nthe thought that her child was this day a day older, that he would be\nanother day older on the morrow, that day by day, page by page, his\nwork of life was being accomplished. This consoled her delightfully\nfor all her miseries. She had a duty, an object, and she felt in her\nhappy serenity that she was doing surely what she had been sent here\nto do.",
        "Yet, even at this very moment she knew that the mystic was not\nentirely dead within her. In the midst of the profound silence she\nheard a slight noise, and she raised her head. Who was the divine\nmediator that had passed? Perhaps the beloved dead for whom she\nmourned, and whose presence near her she fancied she could divine.\nThere must always be in her something of the childlike believer she\nhad always been, curious about the Unknown, having an instinctive\nlonging for the mysterious. She accounted to herself for this longing,\nshe even explained it scientifically. However far science may extend\nthe limits of human knowledge, there is undoubtedly a point which it\ncannot pass; and it was here precisely that Pascal placed the only\ninterest in life–in the effort which we ceaselessly make to know more\n–there was only one reasonable meaning in life, this continual\nconquest of the unknown. Therefore, she admitted the existence of\nundiscovered forces surrounding the world, an immense and obscure\ndomain, ten times larger than the domain already won, an infinite and\nunexplored realm through which future humanity would endlessly ascend.\nHere, indeed, was a field vast enough for the imagination to lose\nitself in. In her hours of reverie she satisfied in it the imperious\nneed which man seems to have for the spiritual, a need of escaping\nfrom the visible world, of interrogating the Unknown, of satisfying in\nit the dream of absolute justice and of future happiness. All that\nremained of her former torture, her last mystic transports, were there\nappeased. She satisfied there that hunger for consoling illusions\nwhich suffering humanity must satisfy in order to live. But in her all\nwas happily balanced. At this crisis, in an epoch overburdened with\nscience, disquieted at the ruins it has made, and seized with fright\nin the face of the new century, wildly desiring to stop and to return\nto the past, Clotilde kept the happy mean; in her the passion for\ntruth was broadened by her eagerness to penetrate the Unknown. If\nsectarian scientists shut out the horizon to keep strictly to the\nphenomenon, it was permitted to her, a good, simple creature, to\nreserve the part that she did not know, that she would never know. And\nif Pascal’s creed was the logical deduction from the whole work, the\neternal question of the Beyond, which she still continued to put to\nheaven, reopened the door of the infinite to humanity marching ever\nonward. Since we must always learn, while resigning ourselves never to\nknow all, was it not to will action, life itself, to reserve the\nUnknown–an eternal doubt and an eternal hope?",
        "Another sound, as of a wing passing, the light touch of a kiss upon\nher hair, this time made her smile. He was surely here; and her whole\nbeing went out toward him, in the great flood of tenderness with which\nher heart overflowed. How kind and cheerful he was, and what a love\nfor others underlay his passionate love of life! Perhaps he, too, had\nbeen only a dreamer, for he had dreamed the most beautiful of dreams,\nthe final belief in a better world, when science should have bestowed\nincalculable power upon man–to accept everything, to turn everything\nto our happiness, to know everything and to foresee everything, to\nmake nature our servant, to live in the tranquillity of intelligence\nsatisfied. Meantime faith in life, voluntary and regular labor, would\nsuffice for health. Evil was only the unexplained side of things;\nsuffering would one day be assuredly utilized. And regarding from\nabove the enormous labor of the world, seeing the sum total of\nhumanity, good and bad–admirable, in spite of everything, for their\ncourage and their industry–she now regarded all mankind as united in\na common brotherhood, she now felt only boundless indulgence, an\ninfinite pity, and an ardent charity. Love, like the sun, bathes the\nearth, and goodness is the great river at which all hearts drink.",
        "Clotilde had been plying her needle for two hours, with the same\nregular movement, while her thoughts wandered away in the profound\nsilence. But the tapes were sewed on the little waists, she had even\nmarked some new wrappers, which she had bought the day before. And,\nher sewing finished, she rose to put the linen away. Outside the sun\nwas declining, and only slender and oblique sunbeams entered through\nthe crevices of the shutters. She could not see clearly, and she\nopened one of the shutters, then she forgot herself for a moment, at\nthe sight of the vast horizon suddenly unrolled before her. The\nintense heat had abated, a delicious breeze was blowing, and the sky\nwas of a cloudless blue. To the left could be distinguished even the\nsmallest clumps of pines, among the blood-colored ravines of the rocks\nof the Seille, while to the right, beyond the hills of Sainte-Marthe,\nthe valley of the Viorne stretched away in the golden dust of the\nsetting sun. She looked for a moment at the tower of St. Saturnin, all\ngolden also, dominating the rose-colored town; and she was about to\nleave the window when she saw a sight that drew her back and kept her\nthere, leaning on her elbow for a long time still.",
        "Beyond the railroad a multitude of people were crowded together on the\nold mall. Clotilde at once remembered the ceremony. She knew that her\nGrandmother Felicite was going to lay the first stone of the Rougon\nAsylum, the triumphant monument destined to carry down to future ages\nthe glory of the family. Vast preparations had been going on for a\nweek past. There was talk of a silver hod and trowel, which the old\nlady was to use herself, determined to figure to triumph, with her\neighty-two years. What swelled her heart with regal pride was that on\nthis occasion she made the conquest of Plassans for the third time,\nfor she compelled the whole town, all the three quarters, to range\nthemselves around her, to form an escort for her, and to applaud her\nas a benefactress. For, of course, there had to be present lady\npatronesses, chosen from among the noblest ladies of the Quartier St.\nMarc; a delegation from the societies of working-women of the old\nquarter, and, finally, the most distinguished residents of the new\ntown, advocates, notaries, physicians, without counting the common\npeople, a stream of people dressed in their Sunday clothes, crowding\nthere eagerly, as to a festival. And in the midst of this supreme\ntriumph she was perhaps most proud–she, one of the queens of the\nSecond Empire, the widow who mourned with so much dignity the fallen\ngovernment–in having conquered the young republic itself, obliging\nit, in the person of the sub-prefect, to come and salute her and thank\nher. At first there had been question only of a discourse of the\nmayor; but it was known with certainty, since the previous day, that\nthe sub-prefect also would speak. From so great a distance Clotilde\ncould distinguish only a moving crowd of black coats and light\ndresses, under the scorching sun. Then there was a distant sound of\nmusic, the music of the amateur band of the town, the sonorous strains\nof whose brass instruments were borne to her at intervals on the\nbreeze.",
        "She left the window and went and opened the large oaken press to put\naway in it the linen that had remained on the table. It was in this\npress, formerly so full of the doctor’s manuscripts, and now empty,\nthat she kept the baby’s wardrobe. It yawned open, vast, seemingly\nbottomless, and on the large bare shelves there was nothing but the\nbaby linen, the little waists, the little caps, the little socks, all\nthe fine clothing, the down of the bird still in the nest. Where so\nmany thoughts had been stored up, where a man’s unremitting labor for\nthirty years had accumulated in an overflowing heap of papers, there\nwas now only a baby’s clothing, only the first garments which would\nprotect it for an hour, as it were, and which very soon it could no\nlonger use. The vastness of the antique press seemed brightened and\nall refreshed by them.",
        "When Clotilde had arranged the wrappers and the waists upon a shelf,\nshe perceived a large envelope containing the fragments of the\ndocuments which she had placed there after she had rescued them from\nthe fire. And she remembered a request which Dr. Ramond had come only\nthe day before to make her–that she would see if there remained among\nthis debris any fragment of importance having a scientific interest.\nHe was inconsolable for the loss of the precious manuscripts which the\nmaster had bequeathed to him. Immediately after the doctor’s death he\nhad made an attempt to write from memory his last talk, that summary\nof vast theories expounded by the dying man with so heroic a serenity;\nbut he could recall only parts of it. He would have needed complete\nnotes, observations made from day to day, the results obtained, and\nthe laws formulated. The loss was irreparable, the task was to be\nbegun over again, and he lamented having only indications; he said\nthat it would be at least twenty years before science could make up\nthe loss, and take up and utilize the ideas of the solitary pioneer\nwhose labors a wicked and imbecile catastrophe had destroyed.",
        "The genealogical tree, the only document that had remained intact, was\nattached to the envelope, and Clotilde carried the whole to the table\nbeside the cradle. After she had taken out the fragments, one by one,\nshe found, what she had been already almost certain of, that not a\nsingle entire page of manuscript remained, not a single complete note\nhaving any meaning. There were only fragments of documents, scraps of\nhalf-burned and blackened paper, without sequence or connection. But\nas she examined them, these incomplete phrases, these words half\nconsumed by fire, assumed for her an interest which no one else could\nhave understood. She remembered the night of the storm, and the\nphrases completed themselves, the beginning of a word evoked before\nher persons and histories. Thus her eye fell on Maxime’s name, and she\nreviewed the life of this brother who had remained a stranger to her,\nand whose death, two months before, had left her almost indifferent.\nThen, a half-burned scrap containing her father’s name gave her an\nuneasy feeling, for she believed that her father had obtained\npossession of the fortune and the house on the avenue of Bois de\nBoulogne through the good offices of his hairdresser’s niece, the\ninnocent Rose, repaid, no doubt, by a generous percentage. Then she\nmet with other names, that of her uncle Eugene, the former vice\nemperor, now dead, the cure of Saint-Eutrope, who, she had been told\nyesterday, was dying of consumption. And each fragment became animated\nin this way; the execrable family lived again in these scraps, these\nblack ashes, where were now only disconnected words.",
        "Then Clotilde had the curiosity to unfold the genealogical tree and\nspread it out upon the table. A strong emotion gained on her; she was\ndeeply affected by these relics; and when she read once more the notes\nadded in pencil by Pascal, a few moments before his death, tears rose\nto her eyes. With what courage he had written down the date of his\ndeath! And what despairing regret for life one divined in the\ntrembling words announcing the birth of the child! The tree ascended,\nspread out its branches, unfolded its leaves, and she remained for a\nlong time contemplating it, saying to herself that all the work of the\nmaster was to be found here in the classified records of this family\ntree. She could still hear certain of his words commenting on each\nhereditary case, she recalled his lessons. But the children, above\nall, interested her; she read again and again the notes on the leaves\nwhich bore their names. The doctor’s colleague in Noumea, to whom he\nhad written for information about the child born of the marriage of\nthe convict Etienne, had at last made up his mind to answer; but the\nonly information he gave was in regard to the sex–it was a girl, he\nsaid, and she seemed to be healthy. Octave Mouret had come near losing\nhis daughter, who had always been very frail, while his little boy\ncontinued to enjoy superb health. But the chosen abode of vigorous\nhealth and of extraordinary fecundity was still the house of Jean, at\nValqueyras, whose wife had had two children in three years and was\nabout to have a third. The nestlings throve in the sunshine, in the\nheart of a fertile country, while the father sang as he guided his\nplow, and the mother at home cleverly made the soup and kept the\nchildren in order. There was enough new vitality and industry there to\nmake another family, a whole race. Clotilde fancied at this moment\nthat she could hear Pascal’s cry: “Ah, our family! what is it going to\nbe, in what kind of being will it end?” And she fell again into a\nreverie, looking at the tree sending its latest branches into the\nfuture. Who could tell whence the healthy branch would spring? Perhaps\nthe great and good man so long awaited was germinating there.",
        "A slight cry drew Clotilde from her reflections. The muslin curtain of\nthe cradle seemed to become animate. It was the child who had wakened\nup and was moving about and calling to her. She at once took him out\nof the cradle and held him up gaily, that he might bathe in the golden\nlight of the setting sun. But he was insensible to the beauty of the\nclosing day; his little vacant eyes, still full of sleep, turned away\nfrom the vast sky, while he opened wide his rosy and ever hungry\nmouth, like a bird opening its beak. And he cried so loud, he had\nwakened up so ravenous, that she decided to nurse him again. Besides,\nit was his hour; it would soon be three hours since she had last\nnursed him.",
        "Clotilde sat down again beside the table. She took him on her lap, but\nhe was not very good, crying louder and louder, growing more and more\nimpatient; and she looked at him with a smile while she unfastened her\ndress, showing her round, slender throat. Already the child knew, and\nraising himself he felt with his lips for the breast. When she placed\nit in his mouth he gave a little grunt of satisfaction; he threw\nhimself upon her with the fine, voracious appetite of a young\ngentleman who was determined to live. At first he had clutched the\nbreast with his little free hand, as if to show that it was his, to\ndefend it and to guard it. Then, in the joy of the warm stream that\nfilled his throat he raised his little arm straight up, like a flag.\nAnd Clotilde kept her unconscious smile, seeing him so healthy, so\nrosy, and so plump, thriving so well on the nourishment he drew from\nher. During the first few weeks she had suffered from a fissure, and\neven now her breast was sensitive; but she smiled, notwithstanding,\nwith that peaceful look which mothers wear, happy in giving their milk\nas they would give their blood.",
        "When she had unfastened her dress, showing her bare throat and breast,\nin the solitude and silence of the study, another of her mysteries,\none of her sweetest and most hidden secrets, was revealed at the same\ntime–the slender necklace with the seven pearls, the seven fine,\nmilky stars which the master had put around her neck on a day of\nmisery, in his mania for giving. Since it had been there no one else\nhad seen it. It seemed as if she guarded it with as much modesty as if\nit were a part of her flesh, so simple, so pure, so childlike. And all\nthe time the child was nursing she alone looked at it in a dreamy\nreverie, moved by the tender memory of the kisses whose warm perfume\nit still seemed to keep.",
        "A burst of distant music seemed to surprise Clotilde. She turned her\nhead and looked across the fields gilded by the oblique rays of the\nsun. Ah, yes! the ceremony, the laying of the corner stone yonder!\nThen she turned her eyes again on the child, and she gave herself up\nto the delight of seeing him with so fine an appetite. She had drawn\nforward a little bench, to raise one of her knees, resting her foot\nupon it, and she leaned one shoulder against the table, beside the\ntree and the blackened fragments of the envelopes. Her thoughts\nwandered away in an infinitely sweet reverie, while she felt the best\npart of herself, the pure milk, flowing softly, making more and more\nher own the dear being she had borne. The child had come, the\nredeemer, perhaps. The bells rang, the three wise men had set out,\nfollowed by the people, by rejoicing nature, smiling on the infant in\nits swaddling clothes. She, the mother, while he drank life in long\ndraughts, was dreaming already of his future. What would he be when\nshe should have made him tall and strong, giving herself to him\nentirely? A scientist, perhaps, who would reveal to the world\nsomething of the eternal truth; or a great captain, who would confer\nglory on his country; or, still better, one of those shepherds of the\npeople who appease the passions and bring about the reign of justice.\nShe saw him, in fancy, beautiful, good and powerful. Hers was the\ndream of every mother–the conviction that she had brought the\nexpected Messiah into the world; and there was in this hope, in this\nobstinate belief, which every mother has in the certain triumph of her\nchild, the hope which itself makes life, the belief which gives\nhumanity the ever renewed strength to live still.",
        "What would the child be? She looked at him, trying to discover whom he\nresembled. He had certainly his father’s brow and eyes, there was\nsomething noble and strong in the breadth of the head. She saw a\nresemblance to herself, too, in his fine mouth and his delicate chin.\nThen, with secret uneasiness, she sought a resemblance to the others,\nthe terrible ancestors, all those whose names were there inscribed on\nthe tree, unfolding its growth of hereditary leaves. Was it this one,\nor this, or yet this other, whom he would resemble? She grew calm,\nhowever, she could not but hope, her heart swelled with eternal hope.\nThe faith in life which the master had implanted in her kept her brave\nand steadfast. What did misery, suffering and wickedness matter!\nHealth was in universal labor, in the effort made, in the power which\nfecundates and which produces. The work was good when the child\nblessed love. Then hope bloomed anew, in spite of the open wounds, the\ndark picture of human shame. It was life perpetuated, tried anew, life\nwhich we can never weary of believing good, since we live it so\neagerly, with all its injustice and suffering.",
        "Clotilde had glanced involuntarily at the ancestral tree spread out\nbeside her. Yes, the menace was there–so many crimes, so much filth,\nside by side with so many tears, and so much patient goodness; so\nextraordinary a mixture of the best and the most vile, a humanity in\nlittle, with all its defects and all its struggles. It was a question\nwhether it would not be better that a thunderbolt should come and\ndestroy all this corrupt and miserable ant-hill. And after so many\nterrible Rougons, so many vile Macquarts, still another had been born.\nLife did not fear to create another of them, in the brave defiance of\nits eternity. It continued its work, propagated itself according to\nits laws, indifferent to theories, marching on in its endless labor.\nEven at the risk of making monsters, it must of necessity create,\nsince, in spite of all it creates, it never wearies of creating in the\nhope, no doubt, that the healthy and the good will one day come. Life,\nlife, which flows like a torrent, which continues its work, beginning\nit over and over again, without pause, to the unknown end! life in\nwhich we bathe, life with its infinity of contrary currents, always in\nmotion, and vast as a boundless sea!",
        "A transport of maternal fervor thrilled Clotilde’s heart, and she\nsmiled, seeing the little voracious mouth drinking her life. It was a\nprayer, an invocation, to the unknown child, as to the unknown God! To\nthe child of the future, to the genius, perhaps, that was to be, to\nthe Messiah that the coming century awaited, who would deliver the\npeople from their doubt and their suffering! Since the nation was to\nbe regenerated, had he not come for this work? He would make the\nexperiment anew, he would raise up walls, give certainty to those who\nwere in doubt, he would build the city of justice, where the sole law\nof labor would insure happiness. In troublous times prophets were to\nbe expected–at least let him not be the Antichrist, the destroyer,\nthe beast foretold in the Apocalypse–who would purge the earth of its\nwickedness, when this should become too great. And life would go on in\nspite of everything, only it would be necessary to wait for other\nmyriads of years before the other unknown child, the benefactor,\nshould appear.",
        "But the child had drained her right breast, and, as he was growing\nangry, Clotilde turned him round and gave him the left. Then she began\nto smile, feeling the caress of his greedy little lips. At all events\nshe herself was hope. A mother nursing, was she not the image of the\nworld continued and saved? She bent over, she looked into his limpid\neyes, which opened joyously, eager for the light. What did the child\nsay to her that she felt her heart beat more quickly under the breast\nwhich he was draining? To what cause would he give his blood when he\nshould be a man, strong with all the milk which he would have drunk?\nPerhaps he said nothing to her, perhaps he already deceived her, and\nyet she was so happy, so full of perfect confidence in him.",
