        "The past fifty years have done much for the newspaper and periodical\nreaders of the United States. That period has been fruitful of great\nadvancement and a great reduction in price, but these are not all. Fifty\nyears and less have classified information so that science and sense are\nconveniently found, and humor and nonsense have their proper sphere. All\nbranches are pretty full of lively and thoroughly competent writers, who\ntake hold of their own special work even as the thorough, quick-eyed\nmechanic takes hold of his line of labor and acquits himself in a\ncreditable manner. The various lines of journalism may appear to be\ncrowded, but they are not. There may be too much vagabond journalism, but\nthe road that is traveled by the legitimate laborer is not crowded. The\nclean, Caucasian journalist, as he climbs the hill, is not crowded very\nmuch. He can make out to elbow his way toward the front, if he tries very\nhard. There may be too much James Crow science, and too much editorial\nvandalism and gush, and too much of the journalism for revenue only. There\nmay be too much ringworm humor also, but there is still a demand for the\nscientific work of the true student. There is still a good market for\nhonest editorial opinion, reliable news and fearless and funny paragraph\nwork and character sketches, as the song and dance men would say.",
        "All this, however, points in one direction. It all has one hoarse voice,\nand in the tones of the culverin, whatever that is, it says that to the\nyoung man who is starting out with the intention of filling the tomb of a\nmillionaire, “Learn to do something well.”",
        "Lots of people rather disliked the famous British hangman, and thought he\nhadn’t made a great record for himself, but he performed a duty that had\nto be done by someone, and no one ever complained much about Marwood’s\nwork. He warranted every job and told everyone that if they were\ndissatisfied he would refund their money at the door. No man ever came\nback to Marwood and said, “Sir, you broke my neck in an unworkmanlike\nmanner.”",
        "It is better to be a successful hangman than to be the banished, abused\nand heart-broken, cast-off husband of a great actress. Learn to take hold\nof some business and jerk it bald-headed. Learn to dress yourself first.\nThis will give you self-assurance, so that you can go away from home and\nnot be dependent on your mother. Teach yourself to be accurate and careful\nin all things. It is better to turn the handle of a sausage grinder and\nmake a style of sausage that is free from hydrophobia, than to be the\nextremely hence cashier of a stranded bank, fighting horseflies in the\nsolemn hush of a Canadian forest.",
        "People have wrong ideas of the respective merits of different avocations.\nIt is better to be the successful driver of a dray than to be the\nunsuccessful inventor of a still-born motor. I would rather discover how\nto successfully wean a calf from the parent stem without being boosted\nover a nine rail fence, than to discover a new star that had never been\nused, and the next evening find that it had made an assignment.",
        "Boys, oh, boys! How I wish I could take each of you by the ear and lead\nyou away by yourselves, and show you how many ruins strew the road to\nsuccess, and how life is like a mining boom. We only hear of those who\nstrike it rich. The hopeful, industrious prospector who failed to find the\ncontact and finally filled a nameless grave, is soon forgotten when he is\ngone, but a million tongues tell to forty million listening ears of the\nman who struck it rich and went to Europe.",
        "Therefore make haste to advance slowly and surely. I am aware that your\nears ache with the abundance wherewith ye are advised, but if ye seek not\nto brace up while yet it is called to-day, and file away information for\nfuture reference and cease to look upon the fifteen-ball pool game when it\nmoveth itself aright, at such time as ye think not ye shall be in\npecuniary circumstances and there shall be none to indorse for you–nay,\nnot one.",
        "Early Day Justice.[2]",
        "[Footnote 2: From the Chicago Rambler.]",
        "Those were troublesome times, indeed. All wool justice in the courts was\nimpossible. The vigilance committee, or Salvation Army as it called\nitself, didn’t make much fuss about it, but we all knew that the best\ncitizens belonged to it and were in good standing.",
        "It was in those days when young Stewart was short-handed for a sheep\nherder, and had to take up with a sullen, hairy vagrant, called by the\nother boys “Esau.” Esau hadn’t been on the ranch a week before he made\ntrouble with the proprietor and got the red-hot blessing from Stewart he\ndeserved.",
        "Then Esau got madder and sulked away down the valley among the little sage\nbrush hummocks and white alkali waste land to nurse his wrath. When\nStewart drove into the corral at night, from town, Esau raised up from\nbehind an old sheep dip tank, and without a word except what may have\ngrowled around in his black heart, he raised a leveled Spencer and shot\nhis young employer dead.",
        "That was the tragedy of the week only. Others had occurred before and\nothers would probably occur again. It was getting too prevalent for\ncomfort. So, as soon as a quick cayuse and a boy could get down into\ntown, the news spread and the authorities began in the routine manner to\nset the old legal mill to running. Someone had to go down to “The Tivoli\"\nand find the prosecuting attorney, then a messenger had to go to “The\nAlhambra” for the justice of the peace. The prosecuting attorney was\n“full” and the judge had just drawn one card to complete a straight flush,\nand had succeeded.",
        "In the meantime the Salvation Army was fully half way to Clugston’s ranch.\nThey had started out, as they said, “to see that Esau didn’t get away.\"\nThey were going out there to see that Esau was brought into town.",
        "What happened after they got there I only know from hearsay, for I was not\na member of the Salvation Army at that time. But I got it from one of\nthose present, that they found Esau down in the sage brush on the bottoms\nthat lie between the abrupt corner of Sheep Mountain and the Little\nLaramie River. They captured him, but he died soon after, as it was told\nme, from the effects of opium taken with suicidal intent. I remember\nseeing Esau the next morning and I thought there were signs of ropium, as\nthere was a purple streak around the neck of deceased, together with other\nexternal phenomena not peculiar to opium.",
        "But the great difficulty with the Salvation Army was that it didn’t want\nto bring Esau into town. A long, cold night ride with a person in Esau’s\ncondition was disagreeable. Twenty miles of lonely road with a deceased\nmurderer in the bottom of the wagon is depressing. Those of my readers who\nhave tried it will agree with me that it is not calculated to promote\nhilarity. So the Salvation Army stopped at Whatley’s ranch to get warm,\nhoping that someone would steal the remains and elope with them. They\nstayed some time and managed to “give away” the fact that there was a\nreward of $5,000 out for Esau, dead or alive. The Salvation Army even went\nso far as to betray a great deal of hilarity over the easy way it had\nnailed the reward, or would as soon as said remains were delivered up and\nidentified.",
        "Mr. Whatley thought that the Salvation Army was having a kind of walkaway,\nso he slipped out at the back door of the ranch, put Esau into his own\nwagon and drove away to town. Remember, this is the way it was told to me.",
        "Mr. Whatley hadn’t gone more than half a mile when he heard the wild and\ndisappointed yells of the Salvation Army. He put the buckskin on the backs\nof his horses without mercy, driven on by the enraged shouts and yells of\nhis infuriated pursuers. He reached town about midnight, and his pursuers\ndisappeared. But what was he to do with Esau?",
        "He drove around all over town, trying to find the official who signed for\nthe deceased. Mr. Whatley went from house to house like a vegetable man,\nseeking sadly for the party who would give him a $5,000 check for Esau.\nNothing could be more depressing than to wake up one man after another out\nof a sound sleep and invite him to come out to the buggy and identify the\nremains. One man went out and looked at him. He said he didn’t know how\nothers felt about it, but he allowed that anybody who would pay $5,000 for\nsuch a remains as Esau’s could not have very good taste.",
        "Gradually it crept through Mr. Whatley’s wool that the Salvation Army had\nbeen working him, so he left Esau at the engine house and went home. On\nhis ranch he nailed up a large board on which had been painted in antique\ncharacters with a paddle and tar the following stanzas:",
        "  Vigilance Committees, Salvation Armies, Morgues, or young physicians who\n  may have deceased people on their hands, are requested to refrain from\n  conferring them on to the undersigned.",
        "  People who contemplate shuffling off their own or other people’s mortal\n  coils, will please not do so on these grounds.",
        "  The Salvation Army of the Rocky Mountains is especially hereby warned to\n  keep off the grass!",
        "  James Whatley.",
