        "A Hannibal paper, the “Journal,” was for sale under a mortgage of five\nhundred dollars, and Orion Clemens, returning from St. Louis, borrowed\nthe money and bought it.  Sam’s two years’ apprenticeship with Ament had\nbeen completed, and Orion felt that together they could carry on the\npaper and win success.  Henry Clemens, now eleven, was also taken out of\nschool to learn type-setting.",
        "Orion was a better printer than proprietor.  Like so many of his family,\nhe was a visionary, gentle and credulous, ready to follow any new idea.\nMuch advice was offered him, and he tried to follow it all.",
        "He began with great hopes and energy.  He worked like a slave and did not\nspare the others.  The paper was their hope of success.  Sam, especially,\nwas driven.  There were no more free afternoons.  In some chapters\nwritten by Orion Clemens in later life, he said:",
        "“I was tyrannical and unjust to Sam.  He was swift and clean as a\n     good journeyman.  I gave him ’takes,’ and, if he got through well, I\n     begrudged him the time and made him work more.”",
        "Orion did not mean to be unjust.  The struggle against opposition and\ndebt was bitter.  He could not be considerate.",
        "The paper for a time seemed on the road to success, but Orion worked too\nhard and tried too many schemes.  His enthusiasm waned and most of his\nschemes turned out poorly.  By the end of the year the “Journal” was on\nthe down grade.",
        "In time when the need of money became great, Orion made a trip to\nTennessee to try to raise something on the land which they still held\nthere.  He left Sam in charge of the paper, and, though its proprietor\nreturned empty-handed, his journey was worth while, for it was during his\nabsence that Samuel Clemens began the career that would one day make him\nMark Twain.",
        "Sam had concluded to edit the paper in a way that would liven up the\ncirculation.  He had never written anything for print, but he believed he\nknew what the subscribers wanted.  The editor of a rival paper had been\ncrossed in love, and was said to have tried to drown himself.  Sam wrote\nan article telling all the history of the affair, giving names and\ndetails.  Then on the back of two big wooden letters, used for bill-\nprinting, he engraved illustrations of the victim wading out into the\nriver, testing the depth of the water with a stick.",
        "The paper came out, and the demand for it kept the Washington hand-press\nbusy.  The injured editor sent word that he was coming over to thrash the\nwhole Journal staff, but he left town, instead, for the laugh was too\ngeneral.",
        "Sam also wrote a poem which startled orthodox readers.  Then Orion\nreturned and reduced him to the ranks.  In later years Orion saw his\nmistake.",
        "“I could have distanced all competitors, even then,” he wrote,\n     “if I had recognized Sam’s ability and let him go ahead, merely\n     keeping him from offending worthy persons.”",
        "Sam was not discouraged.  He liked the taste of print.  He sent two\nanecdotes to the Philadelphia Saturday Evening Post.  Both were accepted\n–without payment, of course, in those days–and when they appeared he\nwalked on air.  This was in 1851.  Nearly sixty years later he said:",
        "“Seeing them in print was a joy which rather exceeded anything in\n      that line I have ever experienced since.”",
        "However, he wrote nothing further for the “Post.”  Orion printed two of\nhis sketches in the “Journal,” which was the extent of his efforts at\nthis time.  None of this early work has been preserved.  Files of the\n“Post” exist, but the sketches were unsigned and could hardly be\nidentified.",
        "The Hannibal paper dragged along from year to year.  Orion could pay\nnothing on the mortgage–financial matters becoming always worse.  He\ncould barely supply the plainest food and clothing for the family.  Sam\nand Henry got no wages, of course.  Then real disaster came.  A cow got\ninto the office one night, upset a type-case, and ate up two composition\nrollers.  Somewhat later a fire broke out and did considerable damage.\nThere was partial insurance, with which Orion replaced a few necessary\narticles; then, to save rent, he moved the office into the front room of\nthe home on Hill Street, where they were living again at this time.",
        "Samuel Clemens, however, now in his eighteenth year, felt that he was no\nlonger needed in Hannibal.  He was a capable workman, with little to do\nand no reward.  Orion, made irritable by his misfortunes, was not always\nkind.  Pamela, who, meantime, had married well, was settled in St. Louis.\nSam told his mother that he would visit Pamela and look about the city.\nThere would be work in St. Louis at good wages.",
        "He was going farther than St. Louis, but he dared not tell her.  Jane\nClemens, consenting, sighed as she put together his scanty belongings.\nSam was going away.  He had been a good boy of late years, but her faith\nin his resisting powers was not strong.  Presently she held up a little\nTestament.",
        "“I want you to take hold of the other end of this, Sam,” she said, “and\nmake me a promise.”",
        "The slim, wiry woman of forty-nine, gray-eyed, tender, and resolute,\nfaced the fair-cheeked youth of seventeen, his eyes as piercing and\nunwavering as her own.  How much alike they were!",
        "“I want you,” Jane Clemens said, “to repeat after me, Sam, these words: I\ndo solemnly swear that I will not throw a card or drink a drop of liquor\nwhile I am gone.”",
        "He repeated the vow after her, and she kissed him.",
        "“Remember that, Sam, and write to us,” she said.",
        "“And so,” writes Orion, “he went wandering in search of that comfort and\nadvancement, and those rewards of industry, which he had failed to find\nwhere I was–gloomy, taciturn, and selfish.  I not only missed his labor;\nwe all missed his abounding activity and merriment.”",
