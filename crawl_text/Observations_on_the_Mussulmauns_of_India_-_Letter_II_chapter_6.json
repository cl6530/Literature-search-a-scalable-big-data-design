        "Celebration of Mahurrum.–The Tazia.–Mussulmaun Cemeteries.–An\n  Emaum-baarah.–Piety of the ladies.–Self-inflicted abstinence and\n  privations endured by each sex.–Instances of the devotional zeal of\n  the Mussulmauns.–Attempted infringement on their religious\n  formalities.–The Resident at Lucknow.–Enthusiastic ardour of the\n  poor.–Manner of celebrating the Mahurrum in opposition to the\n  precepts of the Khoraun.–Mosque and Emaum-baarah contrasted.–The\n  supposition of Mussulmauns practising idolatry confuted.",
        "My former Letter prepares you for the celebration of Mahurrum, the\nobservance of which is at this time going forward here (at Lucknow) with\nall that zealous emulative spirit and enthusiasm which I have before\nremarked the Mussulmaun population of India entertain for their Emaums\n(leaders), and their religion.",
        "This annual solemn display of the regret and veneration they consider due\nto the memory of departed excellence, commences on the first day of the\nMoon (Mahurrum). The Mussulmaun year has twelve moons; every third year\none moon is added, which regulation, I fancy, renders their years, in a\nchronological point of view, very nearly equal with those of Europe. Their\nday commences and ends when the stars are first visible after sunset.",
        "The first day of Mahurrum invariably brings to my recollection the\nstrongly impressed ideas of ’The Deserted Village’. The profound quiet and\nsolemn stillness of an extensively populated native city, contrasted with\nthe incessant bustle usual at all other times, are too striking to\nEuropeans to pass by unheeded. This cessation of the animated scene,\nhowever, is not of long duration; the second day presents to the view vast\nmultitudes of people parading backwards and forwards, on horseback, in\npalkies, and on foot, through the broad streets and roadways, arrayed in\ntheir several mourning garbs, speeding their way to the Emaum-baarahs[1]\nof the great men, and the houses of friends, to pay the visit of respect\n(zeearut), wherever a Tazia is set up to the remembrance of Hasan and\nHosein.",
        "The word Tazia[2] signifies grief. The term is applied to a representation\nof the mausoleum at Kraabaallah, erected by their friends and followers,\nover the remains of Hasan and Hosein. It is formed of every variety of\nmaterial, according to the wealth, rank, or preference, of the person\nexhibiting, from the purest silver down to bamboo and paper, strict\nattention being always paid to preserve the model of Kraabaallah, in the\nexact pattern with the original building. Some people have them of ivory,\nebony, sandal-wood, cedar, &c., and I have seen some beautifully wrought\nin silver filigree. The handsomest of the kind, to my taste, is in the\npossession of his Majesty the King of Oude, composed of green glass, with\nbrass mouldings, manufactured in England (by whom I could not learn). All\nthese expensive Tazias are fixtures, but there are temporary ones required\nfor the out-door ceremony, which, like those available to the poor and\nmiddling classes, are composed of bamboo frames, over which is fixed\ncoloured uberuck[3] (lapis specularum, or tulk); these are made in the\nbazaar, of various sizes and qualities, to suit the views of purchasers,\nfrom two rupees to two hundred each.",
        "The more common Tazias are conveyed in the procession on the tenth day,\nand finally deposited with funeral rites in the public burial-grounds, of\nwhich there are several outside the town. These cemeteries are denominated\nKraabaallah,[4] and the population of a large city may be presumed on by\nthe number of these dispersed in the suburbs. They do not bury their dead\nin the vicinity of a mosque, which is held too sacred to be allowed the\npollution. Any one having only touched a dead body, must bathe prior to\nentering the mosque, or performing their usual prayer-service at\nhome;–such is the veneration they entertain for the name of God.",
        "The opulent people of Mussulmaun society have an Emaum-baarah erected in\nthe range of buildings exclusively denominated murdanah[5] (men’s abode).\nThe habitation of all Mussulmauns being composed of separate departments\nfor the males and the females, communicating by private entrances, as will\nbe explained hereafter.",
        "The Emaum-baarah is a sacred place, erected for the express purpose of\ncommemorating Mahurrum; the founder not unfrequently intends this also as\nthe mausoleum for himself and family. But we generally find Mukhburrahs[6]\n(mausoleums) built in conspicuous situations, for the remains of kings,\nprinces, nobles, and sainted persons. Of the latter, many are visited, at\nstated periods, by the multitude, with religious veneration, the\nilliterate attaching considerable importance to the annual pilgrimage to\nthem; and where–to secure the influence of the particular saint’s spirit,\nin furthering their views–mothers present their children, in numbers\nbeyond all calculation; and each having something to hope for who visits\nthe shrine, presents offerings of money and sweetmeats, which become the\nproperty of the person in charge of the tomb, thus yielding him a\nprofitable sinecure, in proportion as the saint is popular amongst the\nignorant.",
        "An Emaum-baarah is a square building, generally erected with a cupola top,\nthe dimensions guided by the circumstances of the founder. The floor is\nmatted with the date-leaf mats, in common use in India, on which is spread\na shutteringhie[7] (cotton carpet), and over this a clean white calico\ncovering, on which the assembled party are seated, during the several\nperiods of collecting together to remember their leaders: these meetings\nare termed Mudgelluss[8] (mourning assemblies). It would be esteemed\nindecorous or disrespectful to the Emaums, if any one in error called\nthese assemblies Moollakhaut,[9] the usual term for mere worldly visiting.",
        "The Tazia is placed against the wall on the side facing Mecca, under a\ncanopy of rich embroidery. A reading-desk or pulpit (mhembur[10]) is\nplaced in a convenient situation, for the reader to face Mecca, and his\nvoice to be heard by the whole assembly of people; it is constructed of\nsilver, ivory, ebony, &c. to correspond with the Tazia, if possible: the\nsteps are covered sometimes with gold-cloth, or broad-cloth of black, or\ngreen,[11] if a Syaad’s property, being the colour worn by that race for\nmourning. The shape of a mhembur is a flight of steps with a flat top,\nwithout any railing or enclosed place; the reader, in his recitings,\noccasionally sitting on the steps, or standing, as may be most convenient\nto himself.",
        "On the walls of the Emaum-baarah, mirrors and looking-glasses are fixed in\nsuitable situations to give effect to the brilliant display of light, from\nthe magnificent chandeliers suspended from the cupola and cornices. The\nnobles and the wealthy are excited with a desire to emulate each other in\nthe splendour of their display on these occasions;–all the mirrors, glass,\nlustres, chandeliers, &c. are brought together to this place, from their\nseveral stations in the mansion; and it is due to them to admit the effect\nto be often imposingly grand, and the blaze of light splendid. I have\nfrequently been reminded in these scenes of the visionary castles conjured\nto the imagination, whilst reading ’The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments’.",
        "On each side the Tazia–the whole length of the wall–banners are ranged,\nin great variety of colour and fabric; some of them are costly and\nsplendid. I have seen many constructed of the richest embroidery, on silk\ngrounds, of gold and silver, with massy gold fringes, cords, and tassels;\nthe staff is cased with gold or silver, worked into figures of birds and\nother animals, in every variety; the top of which has a crest, in some a\nspread hand,[12] in others a sort of plume, and not unfrequently a crest\nresembling a grenade, formed of the precious metals, and set with stones\nof great value.",
        "On the base of the Tazia the several articles are placed conceived likely\nto have been used by Hosein at Kraabaallah; a turban of gold or silver\ntissue, a splendid sword and belt, the handle and hilt set with precious\nstones, a shield, the Arabian bow and arrows. These ancient emblems of\nroyalty are indispensable in order to do honour to Hosein, in the view\nthey take of his sovereign right to be the head or leader of the true\nMussulmauns. Wax lights, red and green, are also placed in great numbers\nabout its base, in silver or glass candlesticks; and censers of gold and\nsilver, burning incense perpetually during Mahurrum. Many other minor\ntributes to the Emaums are discovered near the Tazia, as choice fruits and\ngarlands of sweet-scented flowers, the offerings of ladies of the family\nto their relative’s Tazia.",
        "Amongst the poorer classes of the people an equal proportion of zealous\nspirit is evinced; and according to their several abilities, so they\ncommemorate the period, interesting alike to all. Those who cannot compass\nthe real splendour of an Emaum-baarah, are satisfied with an imitative one\nin the best hall their habitation affords; and, where mirrors and\nchandeliers are not available, they are content to do honour to the Emaums\nwith lamps of uberuck, which in truth are pleasing substitutes at a small\nprice: these lamps are made in a variety of pretty shapes, curiously\npainted, and ingeniously ornamented with cut paper; they burn oil in them,\nand, when well arranged, and diversified with their wonted taste, produce\na good light, and pleasing effect.",
        "The banners of Hosein, in the houses of the poor, are formed of materials\naccording to their humble means, from tinsel imitations down to dyed\nmuslin; and a similar difference is to be perceived in their selection of\nthe metal of which their crests are made.",
        "Mourning assemblies are held in the Emaum-baarahs twice every day during\nMahurrum; those of the evening, however, are the most attractive, and have\nthe fullest attendance of visitors. The master of the house, at the\nappointed hour, takes his seat on the floor near the pulpit, surrounded by\nthe males of his family and intimate friends, and the crowd of strangers\narrange themselves–wherever there is sitting room–without impeding the\nview of the Tazia.",
        "One of the most popular Maulvees[13] of the age is engaged to recite the\nparticular portion appointed for each day, from the manuscript documents,\ncalled Dhie Mudgelluss,[14] in the Persian language. This work is in ten\nparts and contains a subject for each day’s service, descriptive of the\nlife and sufferings of the Emaums, their friends, and children,\nparticularly as regards the eventful period of Mahurrum in which they were\nengaged. It is, I am assured, a pathetic, fine composition, and a faithful\nnarrative of each particular circumstance in the history of their leaders,\nthe heroic bravery of their friends, &c. They are particularly anxious to\nengage an eloquent reader for this part of the performance, who by his\nimpressive manner compels his hearers to sympathise in the affecting\nincidents which are recited by him.",
        "I have been present when the effect produced by the superior oratory and\ngestures of a Maulvee has almost terrified me, the profound grief, evinced\nin his tears and groans, being piercing and apparently sincere. I have\neven witnessed blood issuing from the breast of sturdy men, who beat\nthemselves simultaneously as they ejaculated the names ’Hasan!’\n’Hosein!’[15] for ten minutes, and occasionally during a longer period, in\nthat part of the service called Mortem.[16]",
        "The portion of Dhie Mudgelluss concluded, sherbet is handed round to the\nassembly; and as they voluntarily abstain from luxuries at this season, a\nsubstitute for pawn[17]–the green leaf in general use amongst the\nnatives–has been introduced, consisting of dried coffee, cocoa-nut shreds,\nbetel-nut, cardimuns,[18] dunyah,[19] and a proportionate quantity of\ntobacco-leaf and lime; these are mixed together and handed to the\nvisitors, on small silver trays. The hookha[20] is introduced to the\nsuperiors of the assembly; you are perhaps aware that inferiors do not\nsmoke in the presence of superiors without their command or permission.",
        "This ceremony terminated, the Murseeah[21] is chanted, by several\nwell-practised voices, with good effect. This part of the service is,\nperhaps, the most impressive, as the very ignorant, even, can comprehend\nevery word,–the Murseeah being in the Hindoostanic tongue, a poetical\ncomposition of great merit, and embracing all the subjects they meet to\ncommemorate. The whole assembly rise up afterwards, and, as with one voice,\nrecount the names of the lawful leaders after Mahumud, entreating\nblessings and peace to their souls. They then repeat the names of the\nhated usurpers (Caliphas), on whose memory they invoke curses, &c. Mortem\nfollows, beating of breasts in unison with the voices, and uttering the\nnames of Hasan and Hosein; this performance concludes each day’s\nMudgelluss, either of the morning or evening.",
        "The ladies celebrate the returning season of Mahurrum with as much spirit\nand zeal as the confinement, in which they exist, can possibly admit of.\nThere are but few, and those chiefly princesses, who have Emaum-baarahs at\ncommand, within the boundary of the zeenahnah; the largest and best\napartment in their establishment is therefore selected for the purpose of\nan Emaum-baarah, into which none but females are admitted, excepting the\nhusband, father, son, or brother, of the lady; who having, on this\noccasion, full liberty to invite her female acquaintance, those who are\nher nearest male relatives even are not admitted until previous notice is\ngiven, in order that the female guests may secrete themselves from the\nsight of these relatives of their hostess.",
        "In commemorating this remarkable event in Mussulmaun history, the\nexpressions of grief, manifested by the ladies, are far greater, and\nappear to me more lasting than with the other sex; indeed, I never could\nhave given credit to the extent of their bewailings, without witnessing,\nas I have done for many years, the season for tears and profound grief\nreturn with the month of Mahurrum. In sorrowing for the martyred Emaums,\nthey seem to forget their private griefs; the bereavement of a beloved\nobject even is almost overlooked in the dutiful remembrance of Hasan and\nHosein at this period; and I have had opportunities of observing this\ntriumph of religious feeling in women, who are remarkable for their\naffectionate attachment to their children, husbands, and parents;–they\ntell me, ’We must not indulge selfish sorrows of our own, whilst the\nProphet’s family alone have a right to our tears’.",
        "The religious zeal of these people is evinced, likewise, in a stern,\nsystematic, line of privations, during the period of Mahurrum; no one is\nobliged by any law or command; it is voluntary abstinence on the part of\neach individual–they impose it on themselves, out of pure pity and\nrespect for their Emaums’ well-remembered sufferings. Every thing which\nconstitutes comfort, luxury, or even convenience at other times, on these\noccasions are rigidly laid aside. The pallungh and the charpoy[22] (the\ntwo descriptions of bedsteads in general use), on which the females love\nto lounge for some hours in the day and night, are removed from their\nstandings, and, in lieu of this comfort, they take their rest on a common\ndate mat, on the floor. The musnud,[23] and all its cushioned luxuries,\ngive place, on this occasion, to the simply matted floor. The indulgence\nin choice dainties, at other times so necessary to their happiness, is now\nforegone, and their meal limited, throughout Mahurrum, to the coarsest\nfood–such as barley bread, rice and peas boiled together (called\nkutcher),[24] without even the usual additions to make it palatable\nketcherie,[25] as ghee, salt, pepper, and spices; these ingredients being\nconsidered by the zealous females too indulgent and luxurious for humble\nmourners during Muhurrum.",
        "The pawn leaf, another luxury of no small moment to Asiatic tastes, is now\nbanished for the ten days’ mourning. A very poor substitute has been\nadopted, in the mixture described at the gentlemen’s assembly–it is\ncalled goattur.[26] The truth is, their health would suffer from any long\ndisuse of tobacco-leaf, lime, and a bitter gum,[27] which are in general\nuse with the pawn; the latter is of a warm aromatic nature, and imparts a\nfine flavour to the other ingredients; but, as it is considered a great\nindulgence to eat pawn, they abstain from it altogether during\nMahurrum;–the mixture, they say, is only allowed for health’s sake.",
        "When visitors call on the Mussulmaun ladies at Mahurrum, the goattur is\npresented on trays, accompanied by bags, neatly embroidered in silver and\ngold, of many different shapes and patterns, mostly their own work and\ninvention; they are called buttooah[28] and jhaumdanies.[29]",
        "The variety of ornaments, which constitute the great delight of all\nclasses of females in India, are entirely laid aside, from the first hour\nof Mahurrum, until the period for mourning concludes. I never heard of any\npeople so thoroughly attached to ornaments as the females of India are\ngenerally. They are indulged in this foible–pardonable it may be–by\ntheir husbands and parents. The wealthiness of a family may often be\njudged by a single glance at the principal lady of the zeenahnah, who\nseldom omits doing honour to her husband, by a full display of the\nprecious metals, with a great variety of gems or jewels on ordinary\noccasions. The men of all ranks are proud of their wives’ finery; even the\npoorest hold in derision all ornament that is not composed of sterling\nmetal, of which they seem excellent judges. The massy chains of gold or\nsilver, the solid bangles for the arms and ancles, the nut[30] (nose-ring)\nof gold wire, on which is strung a ruby between two pearls, worn only by\nmarried women; the joshun[31] (armlet), of silver or gold, often set with\nprecious stones; the many rings for the fingers, thumbs, and toes, form\nthe daily dress of a lady;–but I must not digress further. These are all\nremoved from the person, as soon as the moon is seen, when the first day\nof Mahurrum commences; the hair is unloosed from its usual confinement,\nand allowed to flow in disorder about the person; the coloured\npyjaamahs[32] and deputtahs[33] are removed, with every other article of\ntheir usual costume, for a suit that, with them, constitutes\nmourning–some choose black, others grey, slate, or green, and the widow\nwears white from the day her husband dies.",
        "A widow never alters her style of dress, neither does she wear a single\nornament, during her widowhood, which generally lasts with her life. I\nnever heard of one single instance, during my twelve years’ residence\namongst them, of a widow marrying again–they have no law to prohibit it;\nand I have known some ladies, whose affianced husbands died before the\nmarriage was concluded, who preferred a life of solitude and prayer,\nalthough many other overtures were made.[34]",
        "Many of the rigidly zealous, among the females, mortify themselves by\nwearing their suit of mourning, during the ten days, without changing; the\ndress is worn next the skin, and, in very warm weather, must be\ncomfortless after the first day–but so it is; and so many are the\nvarieties of self-inflicted privations, at this period, that my letter\nmight be filled with the observations I have made. I cannot, however, omit\nto mention my old woman-servant (ayah[35]), whose mode of abstinence, in\nremembrance of Hosein, is rigidly severe; my influence does not prevail in\ndissuading her, although I fear the consequences to her health will be\nseriously felt if she persist in the fulfilment of her self-imposed trial.\nThis poor old creature resolves on not allowing one drop of water, or any\nliquid, to pass her lips during the ten days’ mourning; as she says, ’her\nEmaum, Hosein, and his family, suffered from thirst at Kraabaallah, why\nshould such a creature as she is be indulged with water?’ This shows the\ntemper of the people generally; my ayah is a very ignorant old woman, yet\nshe respects her Emaum’s memory.[36]",
        "The Tazia, you are to understand, graces the houses of all good\nMussulmauns in India, who are not of the sect called Soonies. This model\nof their Emaum’s tomb is an object of profound respect. Hindoos, even, on\napproaching the shrine, bow their heads with much solemn gravity; I often\nfancied they mistook the Tazia for a Bootkhanah[37] (the house of an idol).",
        "It is creditable to the Mussulmauns, that they do not restrict any\nprofession of people from visiting their assemblies; there is free\nadmission granted when the Emaum-baarah is first lighted up, until the\nhour of performing the service, when strangers, that is the multitude, are\ncivilly requested to retire. Every one is expected, on entering the\noutward verandah, to leave their shoes at the threshold of the\nsanctuary;[38] none but Europeans have any occasion to be reminded of this,\nas it is a well known and general observance with all degrees of natives\nin Asia. The servants, in charge of the Emaum-baarah, are responsible for\nthe due observance of respect to the place, and when any foreigners are\nadvancing, they are politely requested to leave their shoes outside; which\nmust be complied with, or they cannot possibly be admitted.",
        "Some few years since, a party of young gentlemen, from cantonments, had\nmade up their minds to evade the necessity for removing their boots, on\nthe occasion of a visit to one of the great men’s Emaum-baarahs, at a\nNative city; they had provided themselves with white socks, which they\ndrew over their boots before leaving their palkies. The cheat was\ndiscovered by the servants in attendance, after they had been admitted;\nthey made a precipitate retreat to avoid the consequences of a\nrepresentation to the Resident, by the proprietor of the Emaum-baarah; who,\nhearing of the circumstance, made all possible inquiry, without, however,\ndiscovering the names of the gentlemen, who had thus, in his opinion,\nviolated the sanctuary.",
        "The Natives are aware that the Resident sets the bright example of\nconforming to the observances of the people, over whom he is placed as\ngovernor and guardian; and that he very properly discountenances every\nattempt of his countrymen to infringe on their rights, prejudices, or\nprivileges; and they have, to my knowledge, always looked up to him as to\na parent and a friend, from the first to the last day of his exalted\nstation amongst them. Many a tear marked the regret of the Natives, when\ntheir best, their kindest, earthly friend quitted the city he had blessed\nby his presence; and to the latest page of their history, his memory will\ndoubtless be cherished with sincere veneration and respectful\nattachment.[39]",
        "The poor people vie with their rich neighbours, in making a brilliant\nlight in their little halls containing the Tazia; the very poorest are\nliberal in the expenditure of oil and tallow candles–I might say\nextravagantly so, but for the purity of their intentions, supposing it to\nbe a duty–and they certainly manifest their zeal and respect to the\nutmost of their power; although many, to my knowledge, live all the year\nround on the very coarsest fare, to enable them to show this reverence to\ntheir Emaum’s memory.",
        "The ladies assemble, in the evening, round the Tazia they have set up in\ntheir purdahed privacy–female friends, slaves, and servants, surrounding\nthe mistress of the house, in solemn gravity.",
        "The few females who have been educated are in great request at this season;\nthey read the Dhie Mudgelluss, and chant the Musseeah with good effect.\nThese women, being hired for the purpose, are detained during the ten days;\nwhen the Mahurrum ceases, they are dismissed to their own homes, loaded\nwith the best gifts the good lady their employer can conveniently spare,\ncommensurate with the services performed. These educated females are\nchiefly daughters of poor Syaads, who have not been married for the lack\nof a dowry; they live devoutly in the service of God, according to their\nfaith. They are sometimes required, in the families of the nobility, to\nteach the Khoraun to the young ladies, and, in that capacity, they are\ncalled Oustaardie, or more familiarly Artoojee.[40]",
        "As I have mentioned before, the Musseeah narrative of the sufferings at\nKraabaallah is a really pathetic and interesting composition; the work\nbeing conveyed in the language of the country, every word is understood,\nand very deeply felt, by the females in all these assemblies, who, having\ntheir hearts softened by the emphatic chantings of the readers, burst into\nviolent tears and sobbings of the most heart-rending description. As in\nthe gentlemen’s assembly, they conclude with Mortem, in which they\nexercise themselves until they are actually exhausted; indeed, many\ndelicate females injure their health by the violence and energy of their\nexertions, which they nevertheless deem a most essential duty to perform,\nat all hazards, during the continuance of Mahurrum.",
        "This method of keeping Mahurrum is not in strict obedience to the\nMahumudan laws; in which code may be found prohibitions against all\nviolent and excessive grief–tearing the hair, or other expressions of\nungovernable sorrow.[41]",
        "I have observed that the Maulvees, Moollahs,[42] and devoutly religious\npersons, although mixing with the enthusiasts on these occasions, abstain\nfrom the violent exhibition of sorrows which the uninformed are so prone\nto indulge in. The most religious men of that faith feel equal, perhaps\ngreater sympathy, for the sufferings of the Emaums, than those who are\nless acquainted with the precepts of the Khoraun; they commemorate the\nMahurrum without parade or ostentatious display, and apparently wear\nmourning on their hearts, with their garb, the full term of forty\ndays–the common period of mourning for a beloved object; but these\npersons never join in Mortem, beating breasts, or other outward show of\nsadness, although they are present when it is exercised; but their quiet\ngrief is evidently more sincere.",
        "I have conversed with many sensible men of the Mussulmaun persuasion on\nthe subject of celebrating Mahurrum, and from all I can learn, the pompous\ndisplay is grown into a habit, by a long residence amongst people, who\nmake a merit of showy parades at all their festivals. Foreign Mussulmauns\nare equally surprised as Europeans, when they visit Hindoostaun, and first\nsee the Tazia conveyed about in procession, which would be counted\nsacrilegious in Persia or Arabia; but here, the ceremony is not complete\nwithout a mixture of pageantry with, the deeply expressed and public\nexposure of their grief.[43]",
        "The remarkable plainness of the mosque, contrasted with the superb\ndecorations of an Emaum-baarah, excited my surprise. I am told by the most\nvenerable of Syaads, ’The Mosque is devoted only to the service of God,\nwhere it is commanded no worldly attractions or ornaments shall appear, to\ndraw off the mind, or divert the attention, from that one great object for\nwhich the house of prayer is intended’. An Emaum-baarah is erected for the\npurpose of doing honour to the memory of the Emaums, and of late years the\nemulative spirit of individuals has been the great inducement to the\ndisplay of ornamental decorations.",
        "It is rather from their respect to the Founder of their religion and his\ndescendants, than any part of their profession of faith, that the\nMussulmaun population of Hindoostaun are guided by in these displays,\nwhich are merely the fashion of other people whom they imitate; and with\nfar different motives to the weak-minded Hindoos, who exalt their idols,\nwhilst the former thus testify their respect to worthy mortals only. This\nis the explanation I have received from devout Mussulmauns, who direct me\nto remark the strong similarity–in habit only, where ’the faith’ is not\nliable to innovations–between themselves and the Hindoo population;–the\nout-of-door celebrations of marriage festivals, for instance, which are so\nnearly resembling each other, in the same classes of society, that\nscarcely any difference can be discovered by the common observer.",
        "Idolatry is hateful to a Mussulmaun, who acknowledges ’one only true God’,\nand ’Him alone to be worshipped’.[44] They respect, venerate, love, and\nwould imitate, their acknowledged Prophet and the Emaums (who succeeded\nMahumud in the mission), but they never worship them, as has been often\nimagined. On the contrary, they declare to me that their faith compels\nthem ’to believe in one God, and that He alone is to be worshipped by the\ncreature; and that Mahumud is a creature, the Prophet sent by God to make\nHis will known, and declare His power. That to bow down and worship\nMahumud would be gross idolatry; and, although he is often mentioned in\ntheir prayers, yet he is never prayed to. They believe their Prophet is\nsensible of whatever passes amongst his true disciples; and that, in\nproportion as they fulfil the commands he was instructed by God to leave\nwith them, so will they derive benefit from his intercession, on that\ngreat and awful day, when all mankind shall appear before the judgment\nseat of God.’",
        "[1] Imambara, ’enclosure of the Imam’, the place where the\n    Muharram rites are performed, as contrasted with Masjid, a mosque, and\n    ’Idgah, where the service at the ’Id festivals is conducted.",
