        "Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and\nsitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had\nno occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the\nstroke of One. He felt that he was restored to consciousness\nin the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding\na conference with the second messenger despatched to him\nthrough Jacob Marley’s intervention. But, finding that he\nturned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which\nof his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put\nthem every one aside with his own hands, and lying down\nagain, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. For,\nhe wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its\nappearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and\nmade nervous.",
        "Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves\non being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually\nequal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their \ncapacity for adventure by observing that they are good for\nanything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which\nopposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and\ncomprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for\nScrooge quite as hardily as this, I don’t mind calling on you\nto believe that he was ready for a good broad field of\nstrange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and\nrhinoceros would have astonished him very much.",
        "Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by\nany means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the\nBell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a\nviolent fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter\nof an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay\nupon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy\nlight, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the\nhour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than\na dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it\nmeant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive\nthat he might be at that very moment an interesting case of\nspontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of\nknowing it. At last, however, he began to think -- as you or\nI would have thought at first; for it is always the person not\nin the predicament who knows what ought to have been done\nin it, and would unquestionably have done it too -- at last, I\nsay, he began to think that the source and secret of this\nghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence,\non further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking\nfull possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in\nhis slippers to the door.",
        "The moment Scrooge’s hand was on the lock, a strange\nvoice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He\nobeyed.",
        "It was his own room. There was no doubt about that.\nBut it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls\nand ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a\nperfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming\nberries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and\nivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had\nbeen scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring\nup the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had\nnever known in Scrooge’s time, or Marley’s, or for many and\nmany a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form\na kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn,\ngreat joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,\nmince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,\ncherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears,\nimmense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that\nmade the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy\nstate upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to\nsee, who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty’s\nhorn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge,\nas he came peeping round the door.",
        "`Come in.’ exclaimed the Ghost. `Come in, and know\nme better, man.’",
        "Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this\nSpirit. He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and\nthough the Spirit’s eyes were clear and kind, he did not like\nto meet them.",
        "`I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,’ said the Spirit.\n`Look upon me.’",
        "Scrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple\ngreen robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment\nhung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was\nbare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any\nartifice. Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the \ngarment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other\ncovering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining\nicicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its\ngenial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice,\nits unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded\nround its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword\nwas in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.",
        "`You have never seen the like of me before.’ exclaimed\nthe Spirit.",
        "`Never,’ Scrooge made answer to it.",
        "`Have never walked forth with the younger members of\nmy family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers\nborn in these later years.’ pursued the Phantom.",
        "`I don’t think I have,’ said Scrooge. `I am afraid I have\nnot. Have you had many brothers, Spirit.’ ",
        "`More than eighteen hundred,’ said the Ghost.",
        "`A tremendous family to provide for.’ muttered Scrooge.",
        "The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.",
        "`Spirit,’ said Scrooge submissively,’ conduct me where\nyou will. I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt\na lesson which is working now. To-night, if you have aught\nto teach me, let me profit by it.’ ",
        "`Touch my robe.’ ",
        "Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.",
        "Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game,\npoultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings,\nfruit, and punch, all vanished instantly. So did the room,\nthe fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood\nin the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the\nweather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and\nnot unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the\npavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of\ntheir houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see\nit come plumping down into the road below, and splitting\ninto artificial little snow-storms.",
        "The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows\nblacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow\nupon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground;\nwhich last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by\nthe heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed\nand recrossed each other hundreds of times where the great\nstreets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace\nin the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy,\nand the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist,\nhalf thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended\nin shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great\nBritain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away\nto their dear hearts’ content. There was nothing very cheerful\nin the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of\ncheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest\nsummer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.",
        "For, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops\nwere jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another\nfrom the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious\nsnowball -- better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest --\nlaughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it\nwent wrong. The poulterers’ shops were still half open, and the\nfruiterers’ were radiant in their glory. There were great, round,\nround, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats\nof jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out\ninto the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were\nruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish onions, shining in\nthe fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking\nfrom their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went\nby, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were\npears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there\nwere bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers’ benevolence\nto dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people’s mouths might\nwater gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy\nand brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among\nthe woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered\nleaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy, setting\noff the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great\ncompactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and\nbeseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after\ndinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among\nthese choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and\nstagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was\nsomething going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and\nround their little world in slow and passionless excitement.",
        "The Grocers’. oh the Grocers’. nearly closed, with perhaps\ntwo shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such\nglimpses. It was not alone that the scales descending on the\ncounter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller\nparted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled\nup and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended\nscents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even\nthat the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so\nextremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight,\nthe other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and\nspotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on\nfeel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs\nwere moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in\nmodest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that\neverything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but\nthe customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful\npromise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other\nat the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left\ntheir purchases upon the counter, and came running back to\nfetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in\nthe best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people\nwere so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which\nthey fastened their aprons behind might have been their own,\nworn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws\nto peck at if they chose.",
        "But soon the steeples called good people all, to church and\nchapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in\ntheir best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the\nsame time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and\nnameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners\nto the baker’ shops. The sight of these poor revellers\nappeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with\nScrooge beside him in a baker’s doorway, and taking off the\ncovers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their\ndinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind\nof torch, for once or twice when there were angry words\nbetween some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he\nshed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good\nhumour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame\nto quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was. God love\nit, so it was.",
        "In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and\nyet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners\nand the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of\nwet above each baker’s oven; where the pavement smoked as\nif its stones were cooking too. ",
        "`Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from\nyour torch.’ asked Scrooge.",
        "`There is. My own.’ ",
        "`Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day.’ \nasked Scrooge.",
        "`To any kindly given. To a poor one most.’ ",
        "`Why to a poor one most.’ asked Scrooge.",
        "`Because it needs it most.’ ",
        "`Spirit,’ said Scrooge, after a moment’s thought,’ I wonder\nyou, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should\ndesire to cramp these people’s opportunities of innocent\nenjoyment.’ ",
        "`I.’ cried the Spirit.",
        "`You would deprive them of their means of dining every\nseventh day, often the only day on which they can be said\nto dine at all,’ said Scrooge. `Wouldn’t you.’ ",
        "`I.’ cried the Spirit.",
        "`You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day.’ said\nScrooge. `And it comes to the same thing.’ ",
        "`I seek.’ exclaimed the Spirit.",
        "`Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your\nname, or at least in that of your family,’ said Scrooge.",
        "`There are some upon this earth of yours,’ returned the Spirit,’\nwho lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion,\npride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness\nin our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and\nkin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge\ntheir doings on themselves, not us.’ ",
        "Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on,\ninvisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the\ntown. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which\nScrooge had observed at the baker’s), that notwithstanding\nhis gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place\nwith ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as\ngracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible\nhe could have done in any lofty hall.",
        "And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in\nshowing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind,\ngenerous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor\nmen, that led him straight to Scrooge’s clerk’s; for there he\nwent, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and\non the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped\nto bless Bob Cratchit’s dwelling with the sprinkling of his\ntorch. Think of that. Bob had but fifteen bob a-week\nhimself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his\nChristian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present\nblessed his four-roomed house.",
        "Then up rose Mrs Cratchit, Cratchit’s wife, dressed out\nbut poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons,\nwhich are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and\nshe laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of\nher daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter\nCratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and\ngetting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob’s private\nproperty, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the\nday) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly\nattired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks.\nAnd now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing\nin, screaming that outside the baker’s they had smelt the\ngoose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious\nthoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced\nabout the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the\nskies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked\nhim) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up,\nknocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and\npeeled.",
        "`What has ever got your precious father then.’ said Mrs \nCratchit. `And your brother, Tiny Tim. And Martha\nwarn’t as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour.’ ",
        "\n`Here’s Martha, mother.’ said a girl, appearing as she\nspoke.",
        "`Here’s Martha, mother.’ cried the two young Cratchits.\n`Hurrah. There’s such a goose, Martha.’ ",
        "`Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are.’ \nsaid Mrs Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off\nher shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.",
        "`We’d a deal of work to finish up last night,’ replied the\ngirl,’ and had to clear away this morning, mother.’ ",
        "`Well. Never mind so long as you are come,’ said Mrs\nCratchit. `Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have\na warm, Lord bless ye.’ ",
        "`No, no. There’s father coming,’ cried the two young\nCratchits, who were everywhere at once. `Hide, Martha,\nhide.’ ",
        "So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father,\nwith at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe,\nhanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned\nup and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his\nshoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and\nhad his limbs supported by an iron frame.",
        "`Why, where’s our Martha.’ cried Bob Cratchit, looking\nround.",
        "`Not coming,’ said Mrs Cratchit.",
        "`Not coming.’ said Bob, with a sudden declension in his\nhigh spirits; for he had been Tim’s blood horse all the way\nfrom church, and had come home rampant. `Not coming\nupon Christmas Day.’ ",
        "Martha didn’t like to see him disappointed, if it were only\nin joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet\ndoor, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits\nhustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house,\nthat he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.",
        "`And how did little Tim behave. asked Mrs Cratchit,\nwhen she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had\nhugged his daughter to his heart’s content.",
        "`As good as gold,’ said Bob,’ and better. Somehow he\ngets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the\nstrangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home,\nthat he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he\nwas a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember\nupon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind\nmen see.’ ",
        "Bob’s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and\ntrembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing\nstrong and hearty.",
        "His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back\ncame Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by\nhis brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while\nBob, turning up his cuffs -- as if, poor fellow, they were\ncapable of being made more shabby -- compounded some hot\nmixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round\nand round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter,\nand the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the\ngoose, with which they soon returned in high procession.",
        "Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose\nthe rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a\nblack swan was a matter of course -- and in truth it was\nsomething very like it in that house. Mrs Cratchit made\nthe gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot;\nMaster Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour;\nMiss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted\nthe hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny\ncorner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for\neverybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard \nupon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be\nhelped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was\nsaid. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs\nCratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared\nto plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the\nlong expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of\ndelight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim,\nexcited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with\nthe handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah.",
        "There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn’t believe\nthere ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and\nflavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal\nadmiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes,\nit was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as\nMrs Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small\natom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn’t ate it all at\nlast. Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest\nCratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to\nthe eyebrows. But now, the plates being changed by Miss\nBelinda, Mrs Cratchit left the room alone -- too nervous to\nbear witnesses -- to take the pudding up and bring it in.",
        "Suppose it should not be done enough. Suppose it should\nbreak in turning out. Suppose somebody should have got\nover the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they\nwere merry with the goose -- a supposition at which the two\nyoung Cratchits became livid. All sorts of horrors were\nsupposed.",
        "Hallo. A great deal of steam. The pudding was out of\nthe copper. A smell like a washing-day. That was the\ncloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook’s next\ndoor to each other, with a laundress’s next door to that.\nThat was the pudding. In half a minute Mrs Cratchit\nentered -- flushed, but smiling proudly -- with the pudding,\nlike a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half\nof half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with\nChristmas holly stuck into the top.",
        "Oh, a wonderful pudding. Bob Cratchit said, and calmly\ntoo, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by\nMrs Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs Cratchit said that\nnow the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had\nhad her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had\nsomething to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\nwas at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have\nbeen flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed\nto hint at such a thing.",
        "At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the\nhearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the\njug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges\nwere put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the\nfire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in\nwhat Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and\nat Bob Cratchit’s elbow stood the family display of glass.\nTwo tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.",
        "These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as\ngolden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with\nbeaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and\ncracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:",
        "`A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us.’ ",
        "Which all the family re-echoed.",
        "`God bless us every one.’ said Tiny Tim, the last of all.",
        "He sat very close to his father’s side upon his little\nstool.\nBob held his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the \nchild, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that\nhe might be taken from him.",
        "`Spirit,’ said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt\nbefore, `tell me if Tiny Tim will live.’ ",
        "`I see a vacant seat,’ replied the Ghost, `in the poor\nchimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully\npreserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future,\nthe child will die.’ ",
        "`No, no,’ said Scrooge. `Oh, no, kind Spirit. say he\nwill be spared.’ ",
        "`If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none\nother of my race,’ returned the Ghost, `will find him here.\nWhat then. If he be like to die, he had better do it, and\ndecrease the surplus population.’ ",
        "Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by\nthe Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.\n`Man,’ said the Ghost, `if man you be in heart, not\nadamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered\nWhat the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what\nmen shall live, what men shall die. It may be, that in the\nsight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live\nthan millions like this poor man’s child. Oh God. to hear\nthe Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life\namong his hungry brothers in the dust.’ ",
        "Scrooge bent before the Ghost’s rebuke, and trembling cast\nhis eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on\nhearing his own name.",
        "`Mr Scrooge.’ said Bob; `I’ll give you Mr Scrooge, the\nFounder of the Feast.’ ",
        "`The Founder of the Feast indeed.’ cried Mrs Cratchit,\nreddening. `I wish I had him here. I’d give him a piece\nof my mind to feast upon, and I hope he’d have a good\nappetite for it.’ ",
        "`My dear,’ said Bob, `the children. Christmas Day.’ ",
        "`It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,’ said she, `on\nwhich one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard,\nunfeeling man as Mr Scrooge. You know he is, Robert.\nNobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow.’ ",
        "`My dear,’ was Bob’s mild answer, `Christmas Day.’ ",
        "`I’ll drink his health for your sake and the Day’s,’ said\nMrs Cratchit, `not for his. Long life to him. A merry\nChristmas and a happy new year. He’ll be very merry and\nvery happy, I have no doubt.’ ",
        "The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of\ntheir proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank\nit last of all, but he didn’t care twopence for it. Scrooge\nwas the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast\na dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full\nfive minutes.",
        "After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than\nbefore, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done\nwith. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his\neye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full\nfive-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed\ntremendously at the idea of Peter’s being a man of business;\nand Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from\nbetween his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular\ninvestments he should favour when he came into the receipt\nof that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor\napprentice at a milliner’s, then told them what kind of work\nshe had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch,\nand how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a\ngood long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at\nhome. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some\ndays before, and how the lord was much about as tall as\nPeter; at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you \ncouldn’t have seen his head if you had been there. All this\ntime the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and\nby-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in\nthe snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice,\nand sang it very well indeed.",
        "There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not\na handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes\nwere far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty;\nand Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside\nof a pawnbroker’s. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased\nwith one another, and contented with the time; and when\nthey faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings\nof the Spirit’s torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon\nthem, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.",
        "By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty\nheavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets,\nthe brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and\nall sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of\nthe blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot\nplates baking through and through before the fire, and deep\nred curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.\nThere all the children of the house were running out\ninto the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins,\nuncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again,\nwere shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and\nthere a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted,\nand all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near\nneighbour’s house; where, woe upon the single man who saw\nthem enter -- artful witches, well they knew it -- in a glow.",
        "But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on\ntheir way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought\nthat no one was at home to give them welcome when they\ngot there, instead of every house expecting company, and\npiling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how\nthe Ghost exulted. How it bared its breadth of breast, and\nopened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with\na generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything\nwithin its reach. The very lamplighter, who ran on before,\ndotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was\ndressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly\nas the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter\nthat he had any company but Christmas.",
        "And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they\nstood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses\nof rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place\nof giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed,\nor would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner;\nand nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass.\nDown in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery\nred, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a\nsullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in\nthe thick gloom of darkest night.",
        "`What place is this.’ asked Scrooge.",
        "`A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of\nthe earth,’ returned the Spirit. `But they know me. See.’ ",
        "A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they\nadvanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and\nstone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a\nglowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their\nchildren and their children’s children, and another generation\nbeyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.\nThe old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling\nof the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a \nChristmas song -- it had been a very old song when he was a\nboy -- and from time to time they all joined in the chorus.\nSo surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite\nblithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour\nsank again.",
        "The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his\nrobe, and passing on above the moor, sped -- whither. Not\nto sea. To sea. To Scrooge’s horror, looking back, he saw\nthe last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them;\nand his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it\nrolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it\nhad worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.",
        "Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league\nor so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed,\nthe wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse.\nGreat heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds\n-- born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the\nwater -- rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.",
        "But even here, two men who watched the light had made\na fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed\nout a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their\nhorny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they\nwished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and\none of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and\nscarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship\nmight be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in\nitself.",
        "Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea\n-- on, on -- until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any\nshore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman\nat the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who\nhad the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations;\nbut every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or\nhad a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his\ncompanion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward\nhopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or\nsleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another\non that day than on any day in the year; and had shared\nto some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those\nhe cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted\nto remember him.",
        "It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the\nmoaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it\nwas to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown\nabyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it\nwas a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear\na hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge\nto recognise it as his own nephew’s and to find himself in a\nbright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling\nby his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving\naffability.",
        "`Ha, ha.’ laughed Scrooge’s nephew. `Ha, ha, ha.’ ",
        "If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a\nman more blest in a laugh than Scrooge’s nephew, all I can\nsay is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me,\nand I’ll cultivate his acquaintance.",
        "It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that\nwhile there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing\nin the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and\ngood-humour. When Scrooge’s nephew laughed in this way: holding\nhis sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the\nmost extravagant contortions: Scrooge’s niece, by marriage,\nlaughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being\nnot a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.",
        "`Ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha, ha.’ ",
        "`He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live.’ cried\nScrooge’s nephew. `He believed it too.’ ",
        "`More shame for him, Fred.’ said Scrooge’s niece, \nindignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by\nhalves. They are always in earnest.",
        "She was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,\nsurprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that\nseemed made to be kissed -- as no doubt it was; all kinds of\ngood little dots about her chin, that melted into one another\nwhen she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever\nsaw in any little creature’s head. Altogether she was what\nyou would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory.",
        "`He’s a comical old fellow,’ said Scrooge’s nephew,’ that’s\nthe truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However,\nhis offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing\nto say against him.’ ",
        "`I’m sure he is very rich, Fred,’ hinted Scrooge’s niece.\n`At least you always tell me so.’ ",
        "`What of that, my dear.’ said Scrooge’s nephew. `His\nwealth is of no use to him. He don’t do any good with it.\nHe don’t make himself comfortable with it. He hasn’t the\nsatisfaction of thinking -- ha, ha, ha. -- that he is ever going\nto benefit us with it.’ ",
        "`I have no patience with him,’ observed Scrooge’s niece.\nScrooge’s niece’s sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed\nthe same opinion.",
        "`Oh, I have.’ said Scrooge’s nephew. `I am sorry for\nhim; I couldn’t be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers\nby his ill whims. Himself, always. Here, he takes it into\nhis head to dislike us, and he won’t come and dine with us.\nWhat’s the consequence. He don’t lose much of a dinner.’ ",
        "`Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,’ interrupted\nScrooge’s niece. Everybody else said the same, and they\nmust be allowed to have been competent judges, because\nthey had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the\ntable, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.",
        "`Well. I’m very glad to hear it,’ said Scrooge’s nephew,\n`because I haven’t great faith in these young housekeepers.\nWhat do you say, Topper.’ ",
        "Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge’s niece’s\nsisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast,\nwho had no right to express an opinion on the subject.\nWhereat Scrooge’s niece’s sister -- the plump one with the lace\ntucker: not the one with the roses -- blushed.",
        "`Do go on, Fred,’ said Scrooge’s niece, clapping her hands.\n`He never finishes what he begins to say. He is such a\nridiculous fellow.’ ",
        "Scrooge’s nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was\nimpossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister\ntried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was\nunanimously followed.",
        "`I was only going to say,’ said Scrooge’s nephew,’ that\nthe consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making\nmerry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant\nmoments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses\npleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts,\neither in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I\nmean to give him the same chance every year, whether he\nlikes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas\ntill he dies, but he can’t help thinking better of it -- I defy\nhim -- if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after\nyear, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you. If it only\nputs him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds,\nthat’s something; and I think I shook him yesterday.’ ",
        "It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking\nScrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much\ncaring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any\nrate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the\nbottle joyously.",
        "After tea. they had some music. For they were a musical\nfamily, and knew what they were about, when they sung a\nGlee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who\ncould growl away in the bass like a good one, and never\nswell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face\nover it. Scrooge’s niece played well upon the harp; and\nplayed among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing:\nyou might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had\nbeen familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the\nboarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of\nChristmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the\nthings that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he\nsoftened more and more; and thought that if he could have\nlistened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the\nkindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands,\nwithout resorting to the sexton’s spade that buried Jacob\nMarley.",
        "But they didn’t devote the whole evening to music. After\na while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children\nsometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its\nmighty Founder was a child himself. Stop. There was first\na game at blind-man’s buff. Of course there was. And I\nno more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he\nhad eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done\nthing between him and Scrooge’s nephew; and that the\nGhost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after\nthat plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the\ncredulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons,\ntumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano,\nsmothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,\nthere went he. He always knew where the plump sister was.\nHe wouldn’t catch anybody else. If you had fallen up\nagainst him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would\nhave made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would\nhave been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly\nhave sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.\nShe often cried out that it wasn’t fair; and it really was not.\nBut when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her\nsilken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got\nher into a corner whence there was no escape; then his\nconduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to\nknow her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her\nhead-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by\npressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain\nabout her neck; was vile, monstrous. No doubt she told\nhim her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in\noffice, they were so very confidential together, behind the\ncurtains.",
        "Scrooge’s niece was not one of the blind-man’s buff party,\nbut was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool,\nin a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close\nbehind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her\nlove to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.\nLikewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was\nvery great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge’s nephew, beat\nher sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as\ncould have told you. There might have been twenty people there,\nyoung and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge, for,\nwholly forgetting the interest he had in what was going on, that\nhis voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with\nhis guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too;\nfor the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut\nin the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in\nhis head to be.",
        "The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood,\nand looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like\na boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But\nthis the Spirit said could not be done.",
        "`Here is a new game,’ said Scrooge. `One half hour,\nSpirit, only one.’ ",
        "It was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge’s nephew\nhad to think of something, and the rest must find out what;\nhe only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case\nwas. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed,\nelicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live\nanimal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an\nanimal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes,\nand lived in London, and walked about the streets,\nand wasn’t made a show of, and wasn’t led by anybody, and\ndidn’t live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market,\nand was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a\ntiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh\nquestion that was put to him, this nephew burst into a\nfresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that\nhe was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last\nthe plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:",
        "`I have found it out. I know what it is, Fred. I know\nwhat it is.’ ",
        "`What is it.’ cried Fred.",
        "`It’s your Uncle Scrooge.’ ",
        "Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal\nsentiment, though some objected that the reply to `Is it a\nbear.’ ought to have been `Yes;’ inasmuch as an answer\nin the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts\nfrom Mr Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency\nthat way.",
        "`He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,’ said\nFred,’ and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health.\nHere is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the\nmoment; and I say, “Uncle Scrooge.\"’",
        "`Well. Uncle Scrooge.’ they cried.",
        "`A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old\nman, whatever he is.’ said Scrooge’s nephew. `He wouldn’t\ntake it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless. Uncle\nScrooge.’ ",
        "Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light\nof heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious\ncompany in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech,\nif the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene\npassed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his\nnephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.",
        "Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they\nvisited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood\nbeside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands,\nand they were close at home; by struggling men, and they\nwere patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was\nrich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery’s every\nrefuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not\nmade fast the door and barred the Spirit out, he left his\nblessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.",
        "It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge\nhad his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared\nto be condensed into the space of time they passed\ntogether. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained\nunaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly\nolder. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of \nit, until they left a children’s Twelfth Night party, when,\nlooking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place,\nhe noticed that its hair was grey.",
        "`Are spirits’ lives so short.’ asked Scrooge.",
        "`My life upon this globe, is very brief,’ replied the Ghost.\n`It ends to-night.’ ",
        "`To-night.’ cried Scrooge.",
        "`To-night at midnight. Hark. The time is drawing\nnear.’ ",
        "The chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at\nthat moment.",
        "`Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,’ said\nScrooge, looking intently at the Spirit’s robe,’ but I see\nsomething strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding\nfrom your skirts. Is it a foot or a claw.’ ",
        "`It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,’ was\nthe Spirit’s sorrowful reply. `Look here.’ ",
        "From the foldings of its robe, it brought two children;\nwretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt\ndown at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.",
        "`Oh, Man. look here. Look, look, down here.’ exclaimed\nthe Ghost.",
        "They were a boy and a girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged,\nscowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where\ngraceful youth should have filled their features out, and\ntouched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled\nhand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and\npulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No\nchange, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any\ngrade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has\nmonsters half so horrible and dread.",
        "Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to\nhim in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but\nthe words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie\nof such enormous magnitude.",
        "`Spirit. are they yours.’ Scrooge could say no more.",
        "`They are Man’s,’ said the Spirit, looking down upon\nthem. `And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers.\nThis boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both,\nand all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for\non his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the\nwriting be erased. Deny it.’ cried the Spirit, stretching out\nits hand towards the city. `Slander those who tell it ye.\nAdmit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse.\nAnd abide the end.’ ",
        "`Have they no refuge or resource.’ cried Scrooge.",
        "`Are there no prisons.’ said the Spirit, turning on him\nfor the last time with his own words. `Are there no workhouses.’ \nThe bell struck twelve.",
        "Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it \nnot. As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the\nprediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting\nup his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards\nhim.",
