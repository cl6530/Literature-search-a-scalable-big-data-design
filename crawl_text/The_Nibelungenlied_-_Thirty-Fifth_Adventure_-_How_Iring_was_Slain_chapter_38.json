        "Cried then he of Denmark, / Iring the margrave:\n“Fixed on things of honor / my purpose long I have,\nAnd oft in storm of battle, / where heroes wrought, was I.\nBring hither now my armor, / with Hagen I’ll the combat try.”",
        "2029",
        "“I counsel thee against it,\" / Hagen then replied,\n“Or bring a goodly company / of Hun-men by thy side.\nIf peradventure any / find entrance to the hall,\nI’ll cause that nowise scatheless / down the steps again they fall.”",
        "2030",
        "“Such words may not dissuade me,\" / Iring spake once more;\n“A thing of equal peril / oft have I tried before.\nYea, will I with my broadsword / confront thee all alone.\nNor aught may here avail thee / thus to speak in haughty tone.”",
        "2031",
        "Soon the valiant Iring / armed and ready stood,\nAnd Irnfried of Thuringia / a youth of mettle good,\nAnd eke the doughty Hawart, / with thousand warriors tried.\nWhate’er his purpose, Iring / should find them faithful by his side.",
        "2032",
        "Advancing then with Iring / did the Fiddler see\nAll clad in shining armor / a mighty company,\nAnd each a well-made helmet / securely fastened wore.\nThereat the gallant Volker / began to rail in anger sore.",
        "2033",
        "“Seest thou, friend Hagen, / yonder Iring go,\nWho all alone to front thee / with his sword did vow?\nDoth lying sort with honor? / Scorned the thing must be.\nA thousand knights or over / here bear him armed company.”",
        "2034",
        "“Now make me not a liar,\" / cried Hawart’s man aloud,\n“For firm is still my purpose / to do what now I vowed,\nNor will I turn me from it / through any cause of fear.\nAlone I’ll stand ’fore Hagen, / awful howsoe’er he were.”",
        "2035",
        "On ground did throw him Iring / before his warriors’ feet,\nThat they leave might grant him / alone the knight to meet.\nLoath they were to do it; / well known to them might be\nThe haughty Hagen’s prowess / of the land of Burgundy.",
        "2036",
        "Yet so long besought he / that granted was their leave;\nWhen they that followed with him / did his firm mind perceive,\nAnd how ’twas bent on honor, / they not restrained him.\nThen closed the two chieftains / together in a combat grim.",
        "2037",
        "Iring of Denmark / raised his spear on high,\nAnd with the shield he covered / himself full skilfully;\nHe upward rushed on Hagen / unto the hall right close,\nWhen round the clashing fighters / soon a mighty din arose.",
        "2038",
        "Each hurled upon the other / the spear with arm of might,\nThat the firm shields were pierced / e’en to their mail-coats bright,\nAnd outward still projecting / the long spear-shafts were seen.\nIn haste then snatched their broadswords / both the fighters grim and\n      keen.",
        "2039",
        "In might the doughty Hagen / and prowess did abound,\nAs Iring smote upon him / the hall gave back the sound.\nThe palace all and towers / re-echoed from their blows,\nYet might that bold assailant / with victory ne’er the combat close.",
        "2040",
        "On Hagen might not Iring / wreak aught of injury.\nUnto the doughty Fiddler / in haste then turned he.\nHim by his mighty sword-strokes / thought he to subdue,\nBut well the thane full gallant / to keep him safe in combat knew.",
        "2041",
        "Then smote the doughty Fiddler / so lustily his shield\nThat from it flew its ornaments / where he the sword did wield.\nIring must leave unconquered / there the dauntless man;\nNext upon King Gunther / of Burgundy in wrath he ran.",
        "2042",
        "There did each in combat / show him man of might;\nHowe’er did Gunther and Iring / yet each the other smite,\nFrom wounds might never either / make the blood to flow,\nSo sheltered each his armor, / well wrought that was and strong enow.",
        "2043",
        "Gunther left he standing, / upon Gernot to dash,\nAnd when he smote ring-armor / the fire forth did flash.\nBut soon had he of Burgundy, / Gernot the doughty thane,\nWell nigh his keen assailant / Iring of Denmark slain.",
        "2044",
        "Yet from the prince he freed him, / for nimble was he too.\nFour of the men of Burgundy / the knight full sudden slew\nOf those that followed with them / from Worms across the Rhine.\nThereupon might nothing / the wrath of Giselher confine.",
        "2045",
        "“God wot well, Sir Iring,\" / young Giselher then cried,\n“Now must thou make requital / for them that here have died\n’Neath thy hand so sudden.\" / He rushed upon him so\nAnd smote the knight of Denmark / that he might not withstand the blow.",
        "2046",
        "Into the blood down fell he / staggering ’neath its might,\nThat all who there beheld it / might deem the noble knight\nSword again would never / wield amid the fray.\nYet ’neath the stroke of Giselher / Iring all unwounded lay.",
        "2047",
        "Bedazed by helmet’s sounding / where ringing sword swung down,\nFull suddenly his senses / so from the knight were flown:\nThat of his life no longer / harbored he a thought.\nThat the doughty Giselher / by his mighty arm had wrought.",
        "2048",
        "When somewhat was subsided / the din within his head\nFrom mighty blow so sudden / on him was visited,\nThought he: “I still am living / and bear no mortal wound.\nHow great the might of Giselher, / till now unwitting, have I found.”",
        "2049",
        "He hearkened how on all sides / his foes around did stand;\nKnew they what he did purpose, / they had not stayed their hand.\nHe heard the voice of Giselher / eke in that company,\nAs cunning he bethought him / how yet he from his foes might flee.",
        "2050",
        "Up from the blood he started / with fierce and sudden bound;\nBy grace alone of swiftness / he his freedom found.\nWith speed he passed the portal / where Hagen yet did stand,\nAnd swift his sword he flourished / and smote him with his doughty hand.",
        "2051",
        "To see such sight quoth Hagen: / “To death thou fall’st a prey;\nIf not the Devil shield thee, / now is thy latest day.\"\nYet Iring wounded Hagen / e’en through his helmet’s crown.\nThat did the knight with Waske, / a sword that was of far renown.",
        "2052",
        "When thus Sir Hagen / the smart of wound did feel,\nWrathfully he brandished / on high his blade of steel.\nFull soon must yield before him / Hawart’s daring man,\nAdown the steps pursuing / Hagen swiftly after ran.",
        "2053",
        "O’er his head bold Iring / his shield to guard him swung,\nAnd e’en had that same stairway / been full three times as long,\nYet had he found no respite / from warding Hagen’s blows.\nHow plenteously the ruddy / sparks above his helm arose!",
        "2054",
        "Unscathed at last came Iring / where waited him his own.\nSoon as was the story / unto Kriemhild known,\nHow that in fight on Hagen / he had wrought injury,\nTherefor the Lady Kriemhild / him gan to thank full graciously.",
        "2055",
        "“Now God requite thee, Iring, / thou valiant knight and good,\nFor thou my heart hast comforted / and merry made my mood.\nRed with blood his armor, / see I yonder Hagen stand.\"\nFor joy herself did Kriemhild / take his shield from out his hand.",
        "2056",
        "“Small cause hast thou to thank him,\" / thus wrathful Hagen spake;\n“For gallant knight ’twere fitting / trial once more to make.\nIf then returned he scatheless, / a valiant man he were.\nThe wound doth boot thee little / that now from his hand I bear.",
        "2057",
        "“That here from wound upon me / my mail-coat see’st thou red,\nShall bring woful reprisal / on many a warrior’s head.\nNow is my wrath aroused / in full ’gainst Hawart’s thane.\nAs yet in sooth hath Iring / wrought on me but little bane.”",
        "2058",
        "Iring then of Denmark / stood where fanned the wind.\nHe cooled him in his armor / and did his helm unbind.\nThen praised him all the people / and spoke him man of might,\nWhereat the margrave’s bosom / swelled full high with proud delight.",
        "2059",
        "“Now hearken friends unto me,\" / Iring once more spake;\n“Make me straightway ready, / new trial now to make\nIf I this knight so haughty / may yet perchance subdue.\"\nNew shield they brought, for Hagen / did his erstwhile asunder hew.",
        "2060",
        "Soon stood again the warrior / in armor all bedight.\nIn hand a spear full massy / took the wrathful knight,\nWherewith on yonder Hagen / he thought to vent his hate.\nWith grim and fearful visage / on him the vengeful thane did wait.",
        "2061",
        "Yet not abide his coming / might Hagen longer now.\nAdown he rushed upon him / with many a thrust and blow,\nDown where the stairway ended / for fierce did burn his ire.\nSoon the might of Iring / must ’neath his furious onset tire,",
        "2062",
        "Their shields they smote asunder / that the sparks began\nTo fly in ruddy showers. / Hawart’s gallant man\nWas by sword of Hagen / wounded all so sore\nThrough shield and shining cuirass, / that whole he found him never more.",
        "2063",
        "When how great the wound was / Iring fully knew,\nBetter to guard his helm-band / his shield he higher drew.\nThe scathe he first received / he deemed sufficient quite,\nYet injury far greater / soon had he from King Gunther’s knight.",
        "2064",
        "From where it lay before him / Hagen a spear did lift\nAnd hurled it upon Iring / with aim so sure and swift,\nIt pierced his head, and firmly / fixed the shaft did stand;\nFull grim the end that met him / ’neath the doughty Hagen’s hand.",
        "2065",
        "Backward Iring yielded / unto his Danish men.\nEre for the knight his helmet / they undid again,\nFrom his head they drew the spear-point; / to death he was anigh.\nWept thereat his kinsmen, / and sore need had verily.",
        "2066",
        "Came thereto Queen Kriemhild / and o’er the warrior bent,\nAnd for the doughty Iring / gan she there lament.\nShe wept to see him wounded, / and sorely grieved the queen.\nThen spake unto his kinsmen / the warrior full brave and keen.",
        "2067",
        "“I pray thee leave thy moaning, / royal high lady.\nWhat avails thy weeping? / Yea, soon must ended be\nMy life from wounds outflowing / that here I did receive.\nTo serve thyself and Etzel / will death not longer grant me leave.”",
        "2068",
        "Eke spake he to them of Thuringia / and to them of Danish land:\n“Of you shall never any / receive the gift in hand\nFrom your royal mistress / of shining gold full red.\nWhoe’er withstandeth Hagen / death calleth down upon his head.”",
        "2069",
        "From cheek the color faded, / death’s sure token wore\nIring the gallant warrior: / thereat they grieved full sore.\nNor more in life might tarry / Hawart’s valiant knight:\nEnraged the men of Denmark / again did arm them for the fight.",
        "2070",
        "Irnfried and Hawart / before the hall then sprang\nLeading thousand warriors. / Full furious a clang\nOf weapons then on all sides / loud and great ye hear.\nAgainst the men of Burgundy / how hurled they many a mighty spear!",
        "2071",
        "Straight the valiant Irnfried / the minstrel rushed upon,\nBut naught but grievous injury / ’neath his hand he won:\nFor the noble Fiddler / did the landgrave smite\nE’en through the well-wrought helmet; / yea, grim and savage was the\n      knight.",
        "2072",
        "Sir Irnfried then in answer / the valiant minstrel smote,\nThat must fly asunder / the rings of his mailed coat\nWhich showered o’er his cuirass / like sparks of fire red.\nSoon must yet the landgrave / fall before the Fiddler dead.",
        "2073",
        "Eke were come together / Hawart and Hagen bold,\nAnd saw he deeds of wonder / who did the sight behold.\nSwift flew the sword and fiercely / swung by each hero’s hand.\nBut soon lay Hawart prostrate / before him of Burgundian land.",
        "2074",
        "When Danish men and Thuringians / beheld their masters fall,\nFearful was the turmoil / that rose before the hall\nAs to the door they struggled, / on dire vengeance bent.\nFull many a shield and helmet / was there ’neath sword asunder rent.",
        "2075",
        "“Now backward yield,” cried Volker / “and let them pass within;\nThus only are they thwarted / of what they think to win.\nWhen but they pass the portals / are they full quickly slain.\nWith death shall they the bounty / of their royal mistress gain.”",
        "2076",
        "When thus with pride o’erweening / they did entrance find,\nThe head of many a warrior / was so to earth inclined,\nThat he must life surrender / ’neath blows that thickly fell.\nWell bore him valiant Gernot / and eke Sir Giselher as well.",
        "2077",
        "Four knights beyond a thousand / were come into the house;\nThe light from sword-blades glinted, / swift swung with mighty souse.\nNot one of all their number / soon might ye living see;\nTell might ye mickle wonders / of the men of Burgundy.",
        "2078",
        "Thereafter came a stillness, / and ceased the tumult loud.\nThe blood in every quarter / through the leak-holes flowed,\nAnd out along the corbels / from men in death laid low.\nThat had the men of Rhineland / wrought with many a doughty blow.",
        "2079",
        "Then sat again to rest them / they of Burgundian land,\nShield and mighty broadsword / they laid from out the hand.\nBut yet the valiant Fiddler / stood waiting ’fore the door,\nIf peradventure any / would seek to offer combat more.",
        "2080",
        "Sorely did King Etzel / and eke his spouse lament,\nMaidens and fair ladies / did sorrow sore torment.\nDeath long since upon them, / I ween, such ending swore.\nTo fall before the strangers / was doomed full many a warrior more.",
