        "When that the men of Burgundy / were come into the land,\nHe of Bern did hear it, / the aged Hildebrand.\nHe told it to his master, / who sore thereat did grieve;\nThe knight so keen and gallant / bade he in fitting way receive.",
        "1719",
        "Wolfhart the valiant / bade lead the heroes forth.\nIn company with Dietrich / rode many a thane of worth,\nAs out to receive them / across the plain he went,\nWhere might ye see erected / already many a stately tent.",
        "1720",
        "When that of Tronje Hagen / them far away espied,\nUnto his royal masters / full courteously he said:\n“Now shall ye, doughty riders, / down from the saddle spring,\nAnd forward go to meet them / that here to you a welcome bring.",
        "1721",
        "“A train there cometh yonder, / well knew I e’en when young.\nThanes they are full doughty / of the land of Amelung.\nHe of Bern doth lead them, / and high of heart they are;\nTo scorn their proffered greeting / shall ye in sooth full well beware.”",
        "1722",
        "Dismounted then with Dietrich, / (as was meet and right,)\nAttended by his squire / many a gallant knight.\nThey went unto the strangers / and greeted courteously\nThe knights that far had ridden / from the land of Burgundy.",
        "1723",
        "When then Sir Dietrich / saw them coming near,\nWhat words the thane delivered, / now may ye willing hear,\nUnto Ute’s children. / Their journey grieved him sore.\nHe weened that Ruediger knowing / had warned what lay for them in store.",
        "1724",
        "“Welcome be ye, Masters, / Gunther and Giselher,\nGernot and Hagen, / welcome eke Volker\nAnd the valiant Dankwart. / Do ye not understand?\nKriemhild yet sore bemoaneth / the hero of Nibelungen land.”",
        "1725",
        "“Long time may she be weeping,\" / Hagen spake again;\n“In sooth for years a many / dead he lies and slain.\nTo the monarch now of Hunland / should she devoted be:\nSiegfried returneth never, / buried now long time is he.”",
        "1726",
        "“How Siegfried’s death was compassed, / let now the story be:\nWhile liveth Lady Kriemhild, / look ye for injury.\"\nThus did of Bern Sir Dietrich / unto them declare:\n“Hope of the Nibelungen, / of her vengeance well beware.”",
        "1727",
        "“Whereof shall I be fearful?\" / the lofty monarch spake:\n“Etzel hath sent us message, / (why further question make?)\nThat we should journey hither / into his country.\nEke hath my sister Kriemhild / oft wished us here as guests to see.",
        "1728",
        "“I give thee honest counsel,\" / Hagen then did say,\n“Now shalt thou here Sir Dietrich / and his warriors pray\nTo tell thee full the story, / if aught may be designed,\nAnd let thee know more surely / how stands the Lady Kriemhild’s mind.”",
        "1729",
        "Then went to speak asunder / the lordly monarchs three,\nGunther and Gernot, / and Dietrich went he.\n“Now tell us true, thou noble / knight of Bern and kind,\nIf that perchance thou knowest / how stands thy royal mistress’ mind.”",
        "1730",
        "The lord of Bern gave answer: / “What need to tell you more?\nI hear each day at morning / weeping and wailing sore\nThe wife of royal Etzel, / who piteous doth complain\nTo God in heaven that Siegfried / her doughty spouse from her was ta’en.”",
        "1731",
        "“Then must we e’en abide it,\" / was the fearless word\nOf Volker the Fiddler, / “what we here have heard.\nTo court we yet shall journey / and make full clear to all,\nIf that to valiant warriors / may aught amid the Huns befall.”",
        "1732",
        "The gallant thanes of Burgundy / unto court then rode,\nAnd went in stately manner / as was their country’s mode.\nFull many a man in Hunland / looked eagerly to see\nOf what manner Hagen, / Tronje’s doughty thane, might be.",
        "1733",
        "For that was told the story / (and great the wonder grew)\nHow that of Netherland / Siegfried he slew,\nThat was the spouse of Kriemhild, / in strength without a peer,\nHence a mickle questioning / after Hagen might ye hear.",
        "1734",
        "Great was the knight of stature, / may ye know full true,\nBuilt with breast expansive; / mingled was the hue\nOf his hair with silver; / long he was of limb;\nAs he strode stately forward / might ye mark his visage grim.",
        "1735",
        "Then were the thanes of Burgundy / unto quarters shown,\nBut the serving-man of Gunther / by themselves alone.\nThus the queen did counsel, / so filled she was with hate.\nAnon where they were harbored / the train did meet with direst fate.",
        "1736",
        "Dankwart, Hagen’s brother, / marshal was he.\nTo him the king his followers / commended urgently,\nThat he provide them plenty / and have of them good care.\nThe noble knight of Burgundy / their safety well in mind did bear.",
        "1737",
        "By her train attended, / Queen Kriemhild went\nTo greet the Nibelungen, / yet false was her intent.\nShe kissed her brother Giselher / and took him by the hand:\nThereat of Tronje Hagen / did tighter draw his helmet’s band.",
        "1733",
        "“After such like greeting,\" / the doughty Hagen spake,\n“Let all watchful warriors / full precaution take:\nDiffers wide the greeting / on masters and men bestowed.\nUnhappy was the hour / when to this festival we rode.”",
        "1739",
        "She spake: “Now be ye welcome / to whom ye welcome be.\nFor sake of friendship never / ye greeting have from me.\nTell me now what bring ye / from Worms across the Rhine,\nThat ye so greatly welcome / should ever be to land of mine?”",
        "1740",
        "“An I had only known it,\" / Hagen spake again,\n“That thou didst look for present / from hand of every thane,\nI were, methinks, so wealthy / –had I me bethought–\nThat I unto this country / likewise to thee my gift had brought.”",
        "1741",
        "“Now shall ye eke the story / to me more fully say:\nThe Nibelungen treasure, / where put ye that away?\nMy own possession was it, / as well ye understand.\nThat same ye should have brought me / hither unto Etzel’s land.”",
        "1742",
        "“In sooth, my Lady Kriemhild, / full many a day hath flown\nSince of the Nibelungen / hoard I aught have known.\nInto the Rhine to sink it / my lords commanded me:\nVerily there must it / until the day of judgment be.”",
        "1743",
        "Thereto the queen gave answer: / “Such was e’en my thought.\nThereof right little have ye / unto me hither brought,\nAlthough myself did own it / and once o’er it held sway.\n’Tis cause that I for ever / have full many a mournful day.”",
        "1744",
        "“The devil have I brought thee,\" / Hagen did declare.\n“My shield it is so heavy / that I have to bear,\nAnd my plaited armor; / my shining helmet see,\nAnd sword in hand I carry, / –so might I nothing bring for thee.”",
        "1745",
        "Then spake the royal lady / unto the warriors all:\n“Weapon shall not any / bear into the hall.\nTo me now for safe keeping, / ye thanes shall give them o’er.\"\n“In sooth,” gave answer Hagen, / “such thing shall happen nevermore.",
        "1746",
        "“Such honor ne’er I covet, / royal lady mild,\nThat to its place of keeping / thou shouldst bear my shield\nWith all my other armor, / –for thou art a queen.\nSuch taught me ne’er my sire: / myself will be my chamberlain.”",
        "1747",
        "“Alack of these my sorrows!\" / the Lady Kriemhild cried;\n“Wherefore will now my brother / and Hagen not confide\nTo me their shields for keeping? / Some one did warning give.\nKnew I by whom ’twas given, / brief were the space that he might live.”",
        "1748",
        "Thereto the mighty Dietrich / in wrath his answer gave:\n“’Tis I who now these noble / lords forewarned have,\nAnd Hagen, knight full valiant / of the land of Burgundy.\nNow on! thou devil’s mistress, / let not the deed my profit be.”",
        "1749",
        "Great shame thereat did Kriemhild’s / bosom quickly fill;\nShe feared lest Dietrich’s anger / should work her grievous ill.\nNaught she spake unto them / as thence she swiftly passed,\nBut fierce the lightning glances / that on her enemies she cast.",
        "1750",
        "By hand then grasped each, other / doughty warriors twain:\nHight the one was Dietrich, / with Hagen, noble thane.\nThen spake in courteous manner / that knight of high degree:\n“That ye are come to Hunland, / ’tis very sorrow unto me;",
        "1751",
        "“For what hath here been spoken / by the lofty queen.\"\nThen spake of Tronje Hagen: / “Small cause to grieve, I ween.\"\nHeld converse thus together / those brave warriors twain,\nKing Etzel which perceiving / thus a questioning began:",
        "1752",
        "“I would learn full gladly,\" / –in such wise spake he–\n“Who were yonder warrior, / to whom so cordially\nDoth greeting give Sir Dietrich. / Meseemeth high his mood.\nWhosoe’er his sire, / a thane he is of mettle good.”",
        "1753",
        "Unto the king gave answer / of Kriemhild’s train a knight:\n“Born he was of Tronje, / Aldrian his sire hight.\nHow merry here his bearing, / a thane full grim is he.\nThat I have spoken truly, / shalt thou anon have cause to see.”",
        "1754",
        "“How may I then perceive it / that fierce his wrath doth glow?\"\nNaught of basest treachery / yet the king did know,\nThat anon Queen Kriemhild / ’gainst her kinsmen did contrive,\nWhereby returned from Hunland / not one of all their train alive.",
        "1755",
        "“Well knew I Aldrian, / he once to me was thane:\nPraise and mickle honor / he here by me did gain.\nMyself a knight did make him, / and gave him of my gold.\nHelke, noble lady, / did him in highest favor hold.",
        "1756",
        "“Thereby know I fully / what Hagen since befell.\nTwo stately youths as hostage / at my court did dwell,\nHe and Spanish Walter, / from youth to manhood led.\nHagen sent I homeward; / Walter with Hildegunde fled.”",
        "1757",
        "He thought on ancient story / that long ago befell.\nHis doughty friend of Tronje / knew he then right well,\nWhose youthful valor erstwhile / did such assistance lend.\nThrough him in age he must be / bereft of many a dearest friend.",
