        "At Hilton Hall, long years ago, there lived a Brownie that was the\ncontrariest Brownie you ever knew. At night, after the servants had\ngone to bed, it would turn everything topsy-turvy, put sugar in the\nsalt-cellars, pepper into the beer, and was up to all kinds of pranks.\nIt would throw the chairs down, put tables on their backs, rake out\nfires, and do as much mischief as could be. But sometimes it would be\nin a good temper, and then!–\"What’s a Brownie?” you say. Oh, it’s a\nkind of a sort of a Bogle, but it isn’t so cruel as a Redcap! What!\nyou don’t know what’s a Bogle or a Redcap! Ah, me! what’s the world a-\ncoming to? Of course a Brownie is a funny little thing, half man, half\ngoblin, with pointed ears and hairy hide. When you bury a treasure,\nyou scatter over it blood drops of a newly slain kid or lamb, or,\nbetter still, bury the animal with the treasure, and a Brownie will\nwatch over it for you, and frighten everybody else away.",
        "Where was I? Well, as I was a-saying, the Brownie at Hilton Hall would\nplay at mischief, but if the servants laid out for it a bowl of cream,\nor a knuckle cake spread with honey, it would clear away things for\nthem, and make everything tidy in the kitchen. One night, however,\nwhen the servants had stopped up late, they heard a noise in the\nkitchen, and, peeping in, saw the Brownie swinging to and fro on the\nJack chain, and saying:",
        "  “Woe’s me! woe’s me!\n  The acorn’s not yet\n  Fallen from the tree,\n  That’s to grow the wood,\n  That’s to make the cradle,\n  That’s to rock the bairn,\n  That’s to grow to the man,\n  That’s to lay me.\n  Woe’s me! woe’s me!”",
        "So they took pity on the poor Brownie, and asked the nearest henwife\nwhat they should do to send it away. “That’s easy enough,” said the\nhenwife, and told them that a Brownie that’s paid for its service, in\naught that’s not perishable, goes away at once. So they made a cloak\nof Lincoln green, with a hood to it, and put it by the hearth and\nwatched. They saw the Brownie come up, and seeing the hood and cloak,\nput them on, and frisk about, dancing on one leg and saying:",
        "  “I’ve taken your cloak, I’ve taken your hood;\n  The Cauld Lad of Hilton will do no more good.”",
        "And with that it vanished, and was never seen or heard of afterwards.",
