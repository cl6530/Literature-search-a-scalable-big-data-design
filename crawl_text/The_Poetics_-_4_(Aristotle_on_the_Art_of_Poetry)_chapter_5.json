        "\nIt is clear that the general origin of poetry was due to two causes,\neach of them part of human nature. Imitation is natural to man from\nchildhood, one of his advantages over the lower animals being this,\nthat he is the most imitative creature in the world, and learns at\nfirst by imitation. And it is also natural for all to delight in works\nof imitation. The truth of this second point is shown by experience:\nthough the objects themselves may be painful to see, we delight to\nview the most realistic representations of them in art, the forms for\nexample of the lowest animals and of dead bodies. The explanation is\nto be found in a further fact: to be learning something is the\ngreatest of pleasures not only to the philosopher but also to the\nrest of mankind, however small their capacity for it; the reason of\nthe delight in seeing the picture is that one is at the same time\nlearning—gathering the meaning of things, e.g. that the man there is\nso-and-so; for if one has not seen the thing before, one’s pleasure\nwill not be in the picture as an imitation of it, but will be due to\nthe execution or colouring or some similar cause. Imitation, then,\nbeing natural to us—as also the sense of harmony and rhythm, the\nmetres being obviously species of rhythms—it was through their\noriginal aptitude, and by a series of improvements for the most part\ngradual on their first efforts, that they created poetry out of their\nimprovisations.",
        "Poetry, however, soon broke up into two kinds according to the\ndifferences of character in the individual poets; for the graver among\nthem would represent noble actions, and those of noble personages; and\nthe meaner sort the actions of the ignoble. The latter class produced\ninvectives at first, just as others did hymns and panegyrics. We know\nof no such poem by any of the pre-Homeric poets, though there were\nprobably many such writers among them; instances, however, may be\nfound from Homer downwards, e.g. his Margites, and the similar\npoems of others. In this poetry of invective its natural fitness\nbrought an iambic metre into use; hence our present term ’iambic’,\nbecause it was the metre of their ’iambs’ or invectives against one\nanother. The result was that the old poets became some of them writers\nof heroic and others of iambic verse. Homer’s position, however, is\npeculiar: just as he was in the serious style the poet of poets,\nstanding alone not only through the literary excellence, but also\nthrough the dramatic character of his imitations, so too he was the\nfirst to outline for us the general forms of Comedy by producing not a\ndramatic invective, but a dramatic picture of the Ridiculous; his\nMargites in fact stands in the same relation to our comedies as the\nIliad and Odyssey to our tragedies. As soon, however, as Tragedy\nand Comedy appeared in the field, those naturally drawn to the one\nline of poetry became writers of comedies instead of iambs, and those\nnaturally drawn to the other, writers of tragedies instead of epics,\nbecause these new modes of art were grander and of more esteem than\nthe old.",
        "If it be asked whether Tragedy is now all that it need be in its\nformative elements, to consider that, and decide it theoretically and\nin relation to the theatres, is a matter for another inquiry.",
        "It certainly began in improvisations—as did also Comedy; the one\noriginating with the authors of the Dithyramb, the other with those of\nthe phallic songs, which still survive as institutions in many of our\ncities. And its advance after that was little by little, through their\nimproving on whatever they had before them at each stage. It was in\nfact only after a long series of changes that the movement of Tragedy\nstopped on its attaining to its natural form. (1) The number of actors\nwas first increased to two by Aeschylus, who curtailed the business of\nthe Chorus, and made the dialogue, or spoken portion, take the leading\npart in the play. (2) A third actor and scenery were due to Sophocles.\n(3) Tragedy acquired also its magnitude. Discarding short stories and\na ludicrous diction, through its passing out of its satyric stage, it\nassumed, though only at a late point in its progress, a tone of\ndignity; and its metre changed then from trochaic to iambic. The\nreason for their original use of the trochaic tetrameter was that\ntheir poetry was satyric and more connected with dancing than it now\nis. As soon, however, as a spoken part came in, nature herself found\nthe appropriate metre. The iambic, we know, is the most speakable of\nmetres, as is shown by the fact that we very often fall into it in\nconversation, whereas we rarely talk hexameters, and only when we\ndepart from the speaking tone of voice. (4) Another change was a\nplurality of episodes or acts. As for the remaining matters, the\nsuperadded embellishments and the account of their introduction, these\nmust be taken as said, as it would probably be a long piece of work to\ngo through the details.",
