        "Yes, I feel certain, Wilhelm, and every day I become more certain,\nthat the existence of any being whatever is of very little consequence.\nA friend of Charlotte’s called to see her just now. I withdrew\ninto a neighbouring apartment, and took up a book; but, finding I\ncould not read, I sat down to write. I heard them converse in an\nundertone: they spoke upon indifferent topics, and retailed the\nnews of the town. One was going to be married; another was ill,\nvery ill, she had a dry cough, her face was growing thinner daily,\nand she had occasional fits. “N— is very unwell too,” said\nCharlotte. “His limbs begin to swell already,” answered the other;\nand my lively imagination carried me at once to the beds of the\ninfirm. There I see them struggling against death, with all the\nagonies of pain and horror; and these women, Wilhelm, talk of all\nthis with as much indifference as one would mention the death of\na stranger. And when I look around the apartment where I now am\n— when I see Charlotte’s apparel lying before me, and Albert’s\nwritings, and all those articles of furniture which are so familiar\nto me, even to the very inkstand which I am using, — when I think\nwhat I am to this family — everything. My friends esteem me; I often\ncontribute to their happiness, and my heart seems as if it could\nnot beat without them; and yet — if I were to die, if I were\nto be summoned from the midst of this circle, would they feel —\nor how long would they feel the void which my loss would make in\ntheir existence? How long! Yes, such is the frailty of man, that\neven there, where he has the greatest consciousness of his own\nbeing, where he makes the strongest and most forcible impression,\neven in the memory, in the heart, of his beloved, there also he\nmust perish, — vanish, — and that quickly.",
