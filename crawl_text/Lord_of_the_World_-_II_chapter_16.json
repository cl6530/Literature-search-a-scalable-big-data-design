        "Percy understood nothing except that he was afraid, as he sat in the\ncrowded car that whirled him up to London. He scarcely even heard the\ntalk round him, although it was loud and continuous; and what he heard\nmeant little to him. He understood only that there had been strange\nscenes, that London was said to have gone suddenly mad, that Felsenburgh\nhad spoken that night in Paul’s House.",
        "He was afraid at the way in which be had been treated, and he asked\nhimself dully again and again what it was that had inspired that\ntreatment; it seemed that he bad been in the presence of the\nsupernatural; he was conscious of shivering a little, and of the\nsymptoms of an intolerable sleepiness. It was scarcely strange to him\nthat he should be sitting in a crowded car at two o’clock of a summer\ndawn.",
        "Thrice the car stopped, and he stared out at the signs of confusion that\nwere everywhere; at the figures that ran in the twilight between the\ntracks, at a couple of wrecked carriages, a tumble of tarpaulins; he\nlistened mechanically to the hoots and cries that sounded everywhere.",
        "As he stepped out at last on to the platform, he found it very much as\nhe had left it two hours before. There was the same desperate rush as\nthe car discharged its load, the same dead body beneath the seat; and\nabove all, as he ran helplessly behind the crowd, scarcely knowing\nwhither he ran or why, above him burned the same stupendous message\nbeneath the clock. Then he found himself in the lift, and a minute later\nhe was out on the steps behind the station.",
        "There, too, was an astonishing sight. The lamps still burned overhead,\nbut beyond them lay the first pale streaks of the false dawn. The street\nthat ran now straight to the old royal palace, uniting there, as at the\ncentre of a web, with those that came from Westminster, the Mall and\nHyde Park, was one solid pavement of heads. On this side and that rose\nup the hotels and “Houses of Joy,” the windows all ablaze with light,\nsolemn and triumphant as if to welcome a king; while far ahead against\nthe sky stood the monstrous palace outlined in fire, and alight from\nwithin like all other houses within view. The noise was bewildering. It\nwas impossible to distinguish one sound from another. Voices, horns,\ndrums, the tramp of a thousand footsteps on the rubber pavements, the\nsombre roll of wheels from the station behind–all united in one\noverwhelmingly solemn booming, overscored by shriller notes.",
        "It was impossible to move.",
        "He found himself standing in a position of extraordinary advantage, at\nthe very top of the broad flight of steps that led down into the old\nstation yard, now a wide space that united, on the left the broad road\nto the palace, and on the right Victoria Street, that showed like all\nelse one vivid perspective of lights and heads. Against the sky on his\nright rose up the illuminated head of the Cathedral Campanile. It\nappeared to him as if he had known that in some previous existence.",
        "He edged himself mechanically a foot or two to his left, till he clasped\na pillar; then he waited, trying not to analyse his emotions, but to\nabsorb them.",
        "Gradually he became aware that this crowd was as no other that he had\never seen. To his psychical sense it seemed to him that it possessed a\nunity unlike any other. There was magnetism in the air. There was a\nsensation as if a creative act were in process, whereby thousands of\nindividual cells were being welded more and more perfectly every instant\ninto one huge sentient being with one will, one emotion, and one head.\nThe crying of voices seemed significant only as the stirrings of this\ncreative power which so expressed itself. Here rested this giant\nhumanity, stretching to his sight in living limbs so far as he could see\non every side, waiting, waiting for some consummation–stretching, too,\nas his tired brain began to guess, down every thoroughfare of the vast\ncity.",
        "He did not even ask himself for what they waited. He knew, yet he did\nnot know. He knew it was for a revelation–for something that should\ncrown their aspirations, and fix them so for ever.",
        "He had a sense that he had seen all this before; and, like a child, he\nbegan to ask himself where it could have happened, until he remembered\nthat it was so that he had once dreamt of the Judgment Day–of humanity\ngathered to meet Jesus Christ–Jesus Christ! Ah! how tiny that Figure\nseemed to him now–how far away–real indeed, but insignificant to\nhimself–how hopelessly apart from this tremendous life! He glanced up\nat the Campanile. Yes; there was a piece of the True Cross there, was\nthere not?–a little piece of the wood on which a Poor Man had died\ntwenty centuries ago.... Well, well. It was a long way off....",
        "He did not quite understand what was happening to him. “Sweet Jesus, be\nto me not a Judge but a Saviour,” he whispered beneath his breath,\ngripping the granite of the pillar; and a moment later knew how futile\nwas that prayer. It was gone like a breath in this vast, vivid\natmosphere of man. He had said mass, had he not? this morning–in white\nvestments.–Yes; he had believed it all then–desperately, but truly;\nand now....",
        "To look into the future was as useless as to look into the past. There\nwas no future, and no past: it was all one eternal instant, present and\nfinal....",
        "Then he let go of effort, and again began to see with his bodily eyes.",
        "The dawn was coming up the sky now, a steady soft brightening that\nappeared in spite of its sovereignty to be as nothing compared with the\nbrilliant light of the streets. “We need no sun,” he whispered, smiling\npiteously; “no sun or light of a candle. We have our light on earth–the\nlight that lighteneth every man....”",
        "The Campanile seemed further away than ever now, in that ghostly glimmer\nof dawn–more and more helpless every moment, compared with the\nbeautiful vivid shining of the streets.",
        "Then he listened to the sounds, and it seemed to him as if somewhere,\nfar down eastwards, there was a silence beginning. He jerked his head\nimpatiently, as a man behind him began to talk rapidly and confusedly.\nWhy would he not be silent, and let silence be heard?... The man stopped\npresently, and out of the distance there swelled up a roar, as soft as\nthe roll of a summer tide; it passed up towards him from the right; it\nwas about him, dinning in his ears. There was no longer any individual\nvoice: it was the breathing of the giant that had been born; he was\ncrying out too; he did not know what he said, but he could not be\nsilent. His veins and nerves seemed alight with wine; and as he stared\ndown the long street, hearing the huge cry ebb from him and move toward\nthe palace, he knew why he had cried, and why he was now silent.",
        "A slender, fish-shaped thing, as white as milk, as ghostly as a shadow,\nand as beautiful as the dawn, slid into sight half-a-mile away, turned\nand came towards him, floating, as it seemed, on the very wave of\nsilence that it created, up, up the long curving street on outstretched\nwings, not twenty feet above the heads of the crowd. There was one great\nsigh, and then silence once more.",
        "When Percy could think consciously again–for his will was only capable\nof efforts as a clock of ticks–the strange white thing was nearer. He\ntold himself that he had seen a hundred such before; and at the same\ninstant that this was different from all others.",
        "Then it was nearer still, floating slowly, slowly, like a gull over the\nsea; he could make out its smooth nose, its low parapet beyond, the\nsteersman’s head motionless; he could even hear now the soft winnowing\nof the screw–and then he saw that for which he had waited.",
        "High on the central deck there stood a chair, draped, too, in white,\nwith some insignia visible above its back; and in the chair sat the\nfigure of a man, motionless and lonely. He made no sign as he came; his\ndark dress showed vividedly against the whiteness; his head was raised,\nand he turned it gently now and again from side to side.",
        "It came nearer still, in the profound stillness; the head turned, and\nfor an instant the face was plainly visible in the soft, radiant light.",
        "It was a pale face, strongly marked, as of a young man, with arched,\nblack eyebrows, thin lips, and white hair.",
        "Then the face turned once more, the steersman shifted his head, and the\nbeautiful shape, wheeling a little, passed the corner, and moved up\ntowards the palace.",
        "There was an hysterical yelp somewhere, a cry, and again the tempestuous\ngroan broke out.",
