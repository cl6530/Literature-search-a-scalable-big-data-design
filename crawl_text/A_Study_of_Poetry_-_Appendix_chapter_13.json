        "Believing as I do that a study of the complete work of some modern poet\nshould accompany, if possible, every course in the general theory of\npoetry, I venture to print here an outline of topical work upon the poetry\nof Tennyson. Tennyson’s variety of poetic achievement is so great, and his\ntechnical resources are so remarkable, that he rewards the closest study,\neven on the part of those young Americans who cannot forget that he was a\n“Victorian”:",

        "THE METHOD OF CRITICISM",
        "[The scheme here suggested for the study of poetry is based upon the\nmethods followed in this book. The student is advised to select some one\npoem, and to analyse its content and form as carefully as possible, in\naccordance with the outline printed below. The thought and feeling of the\npoem should be thoroughly comprehended as a whole before the work of\nanalysis is begun; and after the analysis is completed, the student should\nendeavor again to regard the poem synthetically, i. e., in its total\nappeal to the aesthetic judgment, rather than mechanically and part by\npart.]",
        "A “IMPRESSION”",
        "Of Nature. What sort of observation of natural phenomena is revealed\nin this poem? Impressions of movement, form, color, sound, hours of the\nday or night, seasons of the year; knowledge of scientific facts, etc.?",
        "Of Man. What evidence of the poet’s direct knowledge of men? Of\nknowledge of man gained through acquaintance with Biblical, classical,\nforeign or English literature? Self-knowledge?",
        "Of God. Perception of spiritual laws? Religious attitude? Is this\npoem consistent with his other poems?",
        "Does the “raw material” presented by “sense impressions” undergo a\nreal “change in kind” as it passes through the mind of the poet?",
        "Do you feel in this poem the presence of a creative personality?",
        "What evidence of poetic instinct in the selection of characteristic\ntraits? In power of representation through images? In idealization?",
        "What is to be said of the range and character of the poet’s vocabulary?\nEmployment of figurative language? Selection of metre? Use of rhymes?\nModification of rhythm and sound to suggest the idea conveyed? Imitative\neffects?",
        "In general, is there harmony between form and content, or is there\nevidence of the artist’s caring for one rather than the other?",
        "TENNYSON’S LYRIC POETRY",
        "[Write a criticism of the distinctively lyrical work of Tennyson, based\nupon an investigation at first hand of the topics suggested below. Do not\ndeal with any poems in which the narrative or dramatic element seems to\nyou the predominant one, as those forms of expression will be made the\nsubject of subsequent papers.]",
        "A. “IMPRESSION” (i. e., experience, thought, emotion).",
        "General Characteristics.\nDoes the freshness of the lyric mood seem in Tennyson’s case dependent\nupon any philosophical position? Upon sensitiveness to successive\nexperiences?",
        "Is his lyric egoism a noble one? How far does he identify himself with his\nrace? With humanity?",
        "Is his lyric passion always genuine? If not, give examples of lyrics that\nare deficient in sincerity. Is the lyric passion sustained as the poet\ngrows old?",
        "Of Nature.\nWhat part does the observation of natural phenomena–such as form, color,\nsound, hours of the day or night, seasons, the sky, the sea–play in these\npoems? To what extent is the lyrical emotion called forth by the details\nof nature? By her composite effects? Give instances of the poetic use of\nscientific facts.",
        "Of Man.\nWhat human relationships furnish the themes for his lyrics? In the love-\nlyrics, what different relationships of men and women? To what extent does\nhe find a lyric motive in friendship? In patriotism? How much of his lyric\npoetry seems to spring from direct contact with men? From introspection?\nFrom contact with men through the medium of books? How clearly do his\nlyrics reflect the social problems of his own time? In his later lyrics\nare there traces of deeper or shallower interest in men and women? Of\ngreater or less faith in the progress of society?",
        "Of God.\nMention lyrics whose themes are based in such conceptions as freedom,\nduty, moral responsibility. Does Tennyson’s lyric poetry reveal a sense of\nspiritual law? Is the poet’s own attitude clearly evident?",
        "What evidence of poetic instinct in the selection of characteristic\ntraits? In power of representation through images? Distinguish between\nlyrics that owe their poetic quality to the Imagination, and those created\nby the Fancy. (Note Alden’s discussion of this point; “Introduction to\nPoetry,” pp. 102-112.) How far is Tennyson’s personality indicated by\nthese instinctive processes through which his poetical material is\ntransformed?",
        "What may be said in general of his handling of the lyric form: as to\nunity, brevity, simplicity of structure? Occasional use of presentative\nrather than representative language? Choice of metres? Use of rhymes?\nModification of rhythm and sound to suit the idea conveyed? Evidence of\nthe artist’s caring for either form or content to the neglect of the\nother? Note whatever differences may be traced, in all these respects,\nbetween Tennyson’s earlier and later lyrics.",
        "TENNYSON’S NARRATIVE POETRY",
        "[Write a criticism of the distinctively narrative work of Tennyson, based\nupon the questions suggested below.]",
        "A. “IMPRESSION” (i. e., experience, thought, emotion).",
        "General Characteristics.\nAfter classifying Tennyson’s narrative poetry, how many of his themes seem\nto you to be of his own invention? Name those based, ostensibly at least,\nupon the poet’s own experience. To what extent do you find his narrative\nwork purely objective, i. e., without admixture of reflective or didactic\nelements? What themes are of mythical or legendary origin? Of those having\na historical basis, how many are drawn from English sources? Does his use\nof narrative material ever show a deficiency of emotion; i. e., could the\nstory have been better told in prose? Has he the story-telling gift?",
        "Of Nature.\nHow far does the description of natural phenomena, as outlined in Topic\nII, A, enter into Tennyson’s narrative poetry? Does it always have a\nsubordinate place, as a part of the setting of the story? Does it overlay\nthe story with too ornate detail? Does it ever retard the movement unduly?",
        "Of Man. (Note that some of the points mentioned under General\nCharacteristics apply here.)",
        "What can you say of Tennyson’s power of observing character? Of conceiving\ncharacters in complication and collision with one another or with\ncircumstances? Give illustrations of the range of human relationships\ntouched upon in these poems. Do the later narratives show an increased\nproportion of tragic situations? Does Tennyson’s narrative poetry throw\nany light upon his attitude towards contemporary English society?",
        "Of God. (See Topic II, A.)",
        "Adjust the questions already suggested under Topic II, B, to narrative\npoetry. Note especially the revelation of Tennyson’s personality through\nthe instinctive processes by which his narrative material is transformed.",
        "What may be said in general of his handling of the narrative form, i. e.,\nhis management of the setting, the characters and the plot in relation to\none another? Have his longer poems, like the “Idylls,” and “The Princess,\"\nthe unity, breadth, and sustained elevation of style that are usually\nassociated with epic poetry? What can you say of Tennyson’s mastery of\ndistinctly narrative metres? Of his technical skill in suiting rhythm and\nsound to the requirements of his story?",
        "TENNYSON’S DRAMAS",
        "[Reference books for the study of the technique of the drama are easily\navailable. As preparatory work it will be well to make a careful study of\nTennyson’s dramatic monologues, both in the earlier and later periods.\nThese throw a good deal of light upon his skill in making characters\ndelineate themselves, and they reveal incidentally some of his methods of\ndramatic narrative. For this paper, however, please confine your criticism\nto “Queen Mary,” “Harold,” “Becket,” “The Cup,” “The Falcon,” “The Promise\nof May,” and “The Foresters.” In studying “Becket,” compare Irving’s stage\nversion of the play (Macmillan).]",
        "A. Classify the themes of Tennyson’s dramas. Do you think that these\nthemes offer promising dramatic material? Do you regard Tennyson’s\nprevious literary experience as a help or a hindrance to success in the\ndrama?",
        "Nature. Apply what is suggested under this head in Topics I, II, and\nIII, to drama.",
        "Man. Apply to the dramas what is suggested under this head in Topics II\nand III, especially as regards the observation of character, the\nconception of characters in collision, and the sense of the variety of\nhuman relationships. Do these plays give evidence of a genuine comic\nsense? What tragic forces seem to have made the most impression upon\nTennyson? Give illustrations, from the plays, of the conflict of the\nindividual with institutions.",
        "God. Comment upon Tennyson’s doctrine of necessity and retribution. Does\nhis allotment of poetic justice show a sympathy with the moral order of\nthe world? Are these plays in harmony with Tennyson’s theology, as\nindicated elsewhere in his work? Do they contain any clear exposition of\nthe problems of the religious life?",
        "B. Compare Topic II, B. In the historical dramas, can you trace the\ninfluence of the poet’s own personality in giving color to historical\npersonages? Compare Tennyson’s delineation of any of these personages with\nthat of other poets, novelists, or historians. Do you think he has the\npower of creating a character, in the same sense as Shakespeare had it?\nHow much of his dramatic work do you consider purely objective, i. e.,\nuntinged by what was called the lyric egoism?",
        "C. What may be said in general of Tennyson’s handling of the dramatic\nform? Has he “the dramatic sense”? Of his management of the web of\ncircumstance in which the characters are involved and brought into\nconflict? Comment upon his technical skill as displayed in the different\n“parts” and “moments” of his dramas. Does his exhibition of action fulfill\ndramatic requirements? Is his vocabulary suited to stage purposes? Give\ninstances of his purely lyric and narrative gifts as incidentally\nillustrated in his dramas. Instance passages that cannot in your opinion\nbe successfully acted. In your reading of these plays, or observation of\nany of them that you have seen acted, are you conscious of the absence of\nany quality or qualities that would heighten the pleasure they yield you?\nTaken as a whole, is the form of the various plays artistically in\nharmony with the themes employed?",
