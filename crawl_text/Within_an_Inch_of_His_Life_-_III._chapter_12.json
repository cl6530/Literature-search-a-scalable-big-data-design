        "We cannot do violence to our natural feelings without paying for it.\nThe marchioness had nearly fainted when she could at last take refuge\nin the carriage: she was utterly overcome by the great effort she had\nmade to present to the curious people of Sauveterre a smiling face and\ncalm features.",
        "“What a horrible comedy!” she murmured, as she sank back on the\ncushions.",
        "“Admit, at least, madam,” said the lawyer, “that it was necessary. You\nhave won over, perhaps, a hundred persons to your son’s side.”",
        "She made no reply. Her tears stifled her. What would she not have\ngiven for a few moments’ solitude, to give way to all the grief of her\nheart, to all the anxiety of a mother! The time till she reached the\nhouse seemed to her an eternity; and, although the horse was driven at\na furious rate, she felt as if they were making no progress. At last\nthe carriage stopped.",
        "The little servant had jumped down, and opened the door, saying,–",
        "“Here we are.”",
        "The marchioness got out with M. Folgat’s assistance; and her foot was\nhardly on the ground, when the house-door opened, and Dionysia threw\nherself into her arms, too deeply moved to speak. At last she broke\nforth,–",
        "“Oh, my mother, my mother! what a terrible misfortune!”",
        "In the passage M. de Chandore was coming forward. He had not been able\nto follow his granddaughter’s rapid steps.",
        "“Let us go in,” he said to the two ladies: “don’t stand there!”",
        "For at all the windows curious eyes were peeping through the blinds.",
        "He drew them into the sitting-room. Poor M. Folgat was sorely\nembarrassed what to do with himself. No one seemed to be aware of his\nexistence. He followed them, however. He entered the room, and\nstanding by the door, sharing the general excitement, he was watching\nby turns, Dionysia, M. de Chandore, and the two spinsters.",
        "Dionysia was then twenty years old. It could not be said that she was\nuncommonly beautiful; but no one could ever forget her again who had\nonce seen her. Small in form, she was grace personified; and all her\nmovements betrayed a rare and exquisite perfection. Her black hair\nfell in marvellous masses over her head, and contrasted strangely with\nher blue eyes and her fair complexion. Her skin was of dazzling\nwhiteness. Every thing in her features spoke of excessive timidity.\nAnd yet, from certain movements of her lips and her eyebrows, one\nmight have suspected no lack of energy.",
        "Grandpapa Chandore looked unusually tall by her side. His massive\nframe was imposing. He did not show his seventy-two years, but was as\nstraight as ever, and seemed to be able to defy all the storms of\nlife. What struck strangers most, perhaps, was his dark-red\ncomplexion, which gave him the appearance of an Indian chieftain,\nwhile his white beard and hair brought the crimson color still more\nprominently out. In spite of his herculean frame and his strange\ncomplexion, his face bore the expression of almost child-like\ngoodness. But the first glance at his eyes proved that the gentle\nsmile on his lips was not to be taken alone. There were flashes in his\ngray eyes which made people aware that a man who should dare, for\ninstance, to offend Dionysia, would have to pay for it pretty dearly.",
        "As to the two aunts, they were as tall and thin as a couple of willow-\nrods, pale, discreet, ultra-aristocratic in their reserve and their\ncoldness; but they bore in their faces an expression of happy peace\nand sentimental tenderness, such as is often seen in old maids whose\ntemper has not been soured by celibacy. They dressed absolutely alike,\nas they had done now for forty years, preferring neutral colors and\nmodest fashions, such as suited their simple taste.",
        "They were crying bitterly at that moment; and M. Folgat felt\ninstinctively that there was no sacrifice of which they were not\ncapable for their beloved niece’s sake.",
        "“Poor Dionysia!” they whispered.",
        "The girl heard them, however; and, drawing herself up, she said,–",
        "“But we are behaving shamefully. What would Jacques say, if he could\nsee us from his prison! Why should we be so sad? Is he not innocent?”",
        "Her eyes shone with unusual brilliancy: her voice had a ring which\nmoved Manuel Folgat deeply.",
        "“I can at least, in justice to myself,” she went on saying, “assure\nyou that I have never doubted him for a moment. And how should I ever\nhave dared to doubt? The very night on which the fire broke out,\nJacques wrote me a letter of four pages, which he sent me by one of\nhis tenants, and which reached me at nine o’clock. I showed it to\ngrandpapa. He read it, and then he said I was a thousand times right,\nbecause a man who had been meditating such a crime could never have\nwritten that letter.”",
        "“I said so, and I still think so,” added M. de Chandore; “and every\nsensible man will think so too; but\"–",
        "His granddaughter did not let him finish.",
        "“It is evident therefore, that Jacques is the victim of an abominable\nintrigue; and we must unravel it. We have cried enough: now let us\nact!”",
        "Then, turning to the marchioness, she said,–",
        "“And my dear mother, I sent for you, because we want you to help us in\nthis great work.”",
        "“And here I am,” replied the old lady, “not less certain of my son’s\ninnocence than you are.”",
        "Evidently M. de Chandore had been hoping for something more; for he\ninterrupted her, asking,–",
        "“And the marquis?”",
        "“My husband remained in Paris.”",
        "The old gentleman’s face assumed a curious expression.",
        "“Ah, that is just like him,” he said. “Nothing can move him. His only\nson is wickedly accused of a crime, arrested, thrown into prison. They\nwrite to him; they hope he will come at once. By no means. Let his son\nget out of trouble as he can. He has his /faiences/ to attend to. Oh,\nif I had a son!”",
        "“My husband,” pleaded the marchioness, “thinks he can be more useful\nto Jacques in Paris than here. There will be much to be done there.”",
        "“Have we not the railway?”",
        "“Moreover,” she went on, “he intrusted me to this gentleman.” She\npointed out M. Folgat.",
        "“M. Manuel Folgat, who has promised us the assistance of his\nexperience, his talents, and his devotion.”",
        "When thus formally introduced, M. Folgat bowed, and said,–",
        "“I am all hope. But I think with Miss Chandore, that we must go to\nwork without losing a second. Before I can decide, however, upon what\nis to be done, I must know all the facts.”",
        "“Unfortunately we know nothing,” replied M. de Chandore,–\"nothing,\nexcept that Jacques is kept in close confinement.”",
        "“Well, then, we must try to find out. You know, no doubt, all the law\nofficers of Sauveterre?”",
        "“Very few. I know the commonwealth attorney.”",
        "“And the magistrate before whom the matter has been brought.”",
        "The older of the two Misses Lavarande rose, and exclaimed,–",
        "“That man, M. Galpin, is a monster of hypocrisy and ingratitude. He\ncalled himself Jacques’s friend; and Jacques liked him well enough to\ninduce us, my sister and myself, to give our consent to a marriage\nbetween him and one of our cousins, a Lavarande. Poor child. When she\nlearned the sad truth, she cried, ’Great God! God be blessed that I\nescaped the disgrace of becoming the wife of such a man!’ “",
        "“Yes,” added the other old lady, “if all Sauveterre thinks Jacques\nguilty, let them also say, ’His own friend has become his judge.’ “",
        "M. Folgat shook his head, and said,–",
        "“I must have more minute information. The marquis mentioned to me a M.\nSeneschal, mayor of Sauveterre.”",
        "M. de Chandore looked at once for his hat, and said,–",
        "“To be sure! He is a friend of ours; and, if any one is well informed,\nhe is. Let us go to him. Come.”",
        "M. Seneschal was indeed a friend of the Chandores, the Lavarandes, and\nalso of the Boiscorans. Although he was a lawyer he had become\nattached to the people whose confidential adviser he had been for more\nthan twenty years. Even after having retired from business, M.\nSeneschal had still retained the full confidence of his former\nclients. They never decided on any grave question, without consulting\nhim first. His successor did the business for them; but M. Seneschal\ndirected what was to be done.",
        "Nor was the assistance all on one side. The example of great people\nlike M. de Chandore and Jacques’s uncle had brought many a peasant on\nbusiness into M. Seneschal’s office; and when he was, at a later\nperiod of his life, attacked by the fever of political ambition, and\noffered to “sacrifice himself for his country” by becoming mayor of\nSauveterre, and a member of the general council, their support had\nbeen of great service to him.",
        "Hence he was well-nigh overcome when he returned, on that fatal\nmorning, to Sauveterre. He looked so pale and undone, that his wife\nwas seriously troubled.",
        "“Great God, Augustus! What has happened?” she asked.",
        "“Something terrible has happened,” he replied in so tragic a manner,\nthat his wife began to tremble.",
        "To be sure, Mrs. Seneschal trembled very easily. She was a woman of\nforty-five or fifty years, very dark, short, and fat, trying hard to\nbreathe in the corsets which were specially made for her by the Misses\nMechinet, the clerk’s sisters. When she was young, she had been rather\npretty: now she still kept the red cheeks of her younger days, a\nforest of jet black hair, and excellent teeth. But she was not happy.\nHer life had been spent in wishing for children, and she had none.",
        "She consoled herself, it is true, by constantly referring to all the\nmost delicate details on the subject, mentioning not to her intimate\nfriends only, but to any one who would listen, her constant\ndisappointments, the physicians she had consulted, the pilgrimages she\nhad undertaken, and the quantities of fish she had eaten, although she\nabominated fish. All had been in vain, and as her hopes fled with her\nyears, she had become resigned, and indulged now in a kind of romantic\nsentimentality, which she carefully kept alive by reading novels and\npoems without end. She had a tear ready for every unfortunate being,\nand some words of comfort for every grief. Her charity was well known.\nNever had a poor woman with children appealed to her in vain. In spite\nof all that, she was not easily taken in. She managed her household\nwith her hand as well as with her eye; and no one surpassed her in the\nextent of her washings, or the excellence of her dinners.",
        "She was quite ready, therefore, to sigh and to sob when her husband\ntold her what had happened during the night. When he had ended, she\nsaid,–",
        "“That poor Dionysia is capable of dying of it. In your place, I would\ngo at once to M. de Chandore, and inform him in the most cautious\nmanner of what has happened.”",
        "“I shall take good care not to do so,” replied M. Seneschal; “and I\ntell you expressly not to go there yourself.”",
        "For he was by no means a philosopher; and, if he had been his own\nmaster, he would have taken the first train, and gone off a hundred\nmiles, so as not to see the grief of the Misses Lavarande and\nGrandpapa Chandore. He was exceedingly fond of Dionysia: he had been\nhard at work for years to settle and to add to her fortune, as if she\nhad been his own daughter, and now to witness her grief! He shuddered\nat the idea. Besides, he really did not know what to believe, and\ninfluenced by M. Galpin’s assurance, misled by public opinion, he had\ncome to ask himself if Jacques might not, after all, have committed\nthe crimes with which he was charged.",
        "Fortunately his duties were on that day so numerous and so\ntroublesome, that he had no time to think. He had to provide for the\nrecovery and the transportation of the remains of the two unfortunate\nvictims of the fire; he had to receive the mother of one, and the\nwidow and children of the other, and to listen to their complaints,\nand try to console them by promising the former a small pension, and\nthe latter some help in the education of their children. Then he had\nto give directions to have the wounded men brought home; and, after\nthat, he had gone out in search of a house for Count Claudieuse and\nhis wife, which had given him much trouble. Finally, a large part of\nthe afternoon had been taken up by an angry discussion with Dr.\nSeignebos. The doctor, in the name of outraged society, as he called\nit, and in the name of justice and humanity, demanded the immediate\narrest of Cocoleu, that wretch whose unconscious statement formed the\nbasis of the accusation. He demanded with a furious oath that the\nepileptic idiot should be sent to the hospital, and kept there so as\nto be professionally examined by experts. The mayor had for some time\nrefused to grant the request, which seemed to him unreasonable; but he\ndoctor had talked so loud and insisted so strongly, that at last he\nhad sent two gendarmes to Brechy with orders to bring back Cocoleu.",
        "They had returned several hours later with empty hands. The idiot had\ndisappeared; and no one in the whole district had been able to give\nany information as to this whereabouts.",
        "“And you think that is natural?” exclaimed Dr. Seignebos, whose eyes\nwere glaring at the mayor from under his spectacles. “To me that looks\nlike an absolute proof that a plot has been hatched to ruin M. de\nBoiscoran.”",
        "“But can’t you be quiet?” M. Seneschal said angrily. “Do you think\nCocoleu is lost? He will turn up again.”",
        "The doctor had left him without insisting any longer; but before going\nhome, he had dropped in at his club, and there, in the presence of\ntwenty people he had declared that he had positive proof of a plot\nformed against M. de Boiscoran, whom the Monarchists had never\nforgiven for having left them; and that the Jesuits were certainly\nmixed up with the business.",
        "This interference was more injurious than useful to Jacques; and the\nconsequences were soon seen. That same evening, when M. Galpin crossed\nthe New-Market Place, he was wantonly insulted. Very naturally he\nwent, almost in a fury, to call upon the mayor, to hold him\nresponsible for this insult offered to Justice in his person, and\nasking for energetic punishment. M. Seneschal promised to take the\nproper measures, and went to the commonwealth attorney to act in\nconcert with him. There he learned what had happened at Boiscoran, and\nthe terrible result of the examination.",
        "So he had come home, quite sorrowful, distressed at Jacques’s\nsituation, and very much disturbed by the political aspect which the\nmatter was beginning to wear. He had spent a bad night, and in the\nmorning had displayed such fearful temper, that his wife had hardly\ndared to say a word to him. But even that was not all. At two o’clock\nprecisely, the funeral of Bolton and Guillebault was to take place;\nand he had promised Capt. Parenteau that he would be present in his\nofficial costume, and accompanied by the whole municipal council. He\nhad already given orders to have his uniform gotten ready, when the\nservant announced visitors,–M. de Chandore and friend.",
        "“That was all that was wanting!” he exclaimed",
        "But, thinking it over, he added,–",
        "“Well, it had to come sooner r later. Show them in!”",
        "M. Seneschal was too good to be so troubled in advance, and to prepare\nhimself for a heart-rending scene. He was amazed at the easy, almost\ncheerful manner with which M. de Chandore presented to him his\ncompanion.",
        "“M. Manuel Folgat, my dear Seneschal, a famous lawyer from Paris, who\nhas been kind enough to come down with the Marchioness de Boiscoran.”",
        "“I am a stranger here, M. Seneschal,” said Folgat: “I do not know the\nmanner of thinking, the customs, the interests, the prejudices, of\nthis country; in fact, I am totally ignorant, and I know I would\ncommit many a grievous blunder, unless I could secure the assistance\nof an able and experienced counsellor. M. de Boiscoran and M. de\nChandore have both encouraged me to hope that I might find such a man\nin you.”",
        "“Certainly, sir, and with all my heart,” replied M. Seneschal, bowing\npolitely, and evidently flattered by this deference on the part of a\ngreat Paris lawyer.",
        "He had offered his guests seats. He had sat down himself, and resting\nhis elbow on the arm of his big office-chair, he rubbed his clean-\nshaven chin with his hand.",
        "“This is a very serious matter, gentlemen,” he said at last.",
        "“A criminal charge is always serious,” replied M. Folgat.",
        "“Upon my word,” cried M. de Chandore, “you are not in doubt about\nJacques’s innocence?”",
        "M. Seneschal did not say, No. He was silent, thinking of the wise\nremarks made by his wife the evening before.",
        "“How can we know,” he began at last, “what may be going on in young\nbrains of twenty-five when they are set on fire by the remembrance of\ncertain insults! Wrath is a dangerous counsellor.”",
        "Grandpapa Chandore refused to hear any more.",
        "“What! do you talk to me of wrath?” he broke in; “and what do you see\nof wrath in this Valpinson affair? I see nothing in it, for my part,\nbut the very meanest crime, long prepared and coolly carried out.”",
        "The mayor very seriously shook his head, and said,–",
        "“You do not know all that has happened.”",
        "“Sir,” added M. Folgat, “it is precisely for the purpose of hearing\nwhat has happened that we come to you.”",
        "“Very well,” said M. Seneschal.",
        "Thereupon he went to work to describe the events which he had\nwitnessed at Valpinson, and those, which, as he had learned from the\ncommonwealth attorney, had taken place at Boiscoran; and this he did\nwith all the lucidity of an experienced old lawyer who is accustomed\nto unravel the mysteries of complicated suits. He wound up by\nsaying,–",
        "“Finally, do you know what Daubigeon said to me, whose evidence you\nwill certainly know how to appreciate? He said in so many words,\n’Galpin could not but order the arrest of M. de Boiscoran. Is he\nguilty? I do not know what to think of it. The accusation is\noverwhelming. He swears by all the gods that he is innocent; but he\nwill not tell how he spent the night.’ “",
        "M. de Chandore, in spite of his vigor, was near fainting, although his\nface remained as crimson as ever. Nothing on earth could make him turn\npale.",
        "“Great God!” he murmured, “what will Dionysia say?”",
        "Then, turning to M. Folgat, he said aloud,–",
        "“And yet Jacques had something in his mind for that evening.”",
        "“Do you think so?”",
        "“I am sure of it. But for that, he would certainly have come to the\nhouse, as he has done every evening for a month. Besides, he said so\nhimself in the letter which he sent Dionysia by one of his tenants,\nand which she mentioned to you. He wrote, ’I curse from the bottom of\nmy heart the business which prevents me from spending the evening with\nyou; but I cannot possibly defer it any longer. To-morrow!’ “",
        "“You see,” said M. Seneschal.",
        "“The letter is of such a nature,” continued the old gentleman, “that I\nrepeat, No man who premeditated such a hideous crime could possibly\nhave written it. Nevertheless, I confess to you, that, when I heard\nthe fatal news, this very allusion to some pressing business impressed\nme painfully.”",
        "But the young lawyer seemed to be far from being convinced.",
        "“It is evident,” he said, “that M. de Boiscoran will on no account let\nit be known where he went.”",
        "“He told a falsehood, sir,” insisted M. Seneschal. “He commenced by\ndenying that he had gone the way on which the witnesses met him.”",
        "“Very naturally, since he desires to keep the place unknown to which\nhe went.”",
        "“He did not say any more when he was told that he was under arrest.”",
        "“Because he hopes he will get out of this trouble without betraying\nhis secret.”",
        "“If that were so, it would be very strange.”",
        "“Stranger things than that have happened.”",
        "“To allow himself to be accused of incendiarism and murder when he is\ninnocent!”",
        "“To be innocent, and to allow one’s self to be condemned, is still\nstranger; and yet there are instances\"–",
        "The young lawyer spoke in that short, imperious tone which is, so to\nsay, the privilege of his profession, and with such an accent of\nassurance, that M. de Chandore felt his hopes revive. M. Seneschal was\nsorely troubled.",
        "“And what do you think, sir?” he asked.",
        "“That M. de Boiscoran must be innocent,” replied the young advocate.\nAnd, without leaving time for objections, he continued,–",
        "“That is the opinion of a man who is not influenced by any\nconsideration. I come here without any preconceived notions. I do not\nknow Count Claudieuse any more than M. de Boiscoran. A crime has been\ncommitted: I am told the circumstances; and I at once come to the\nconclusion that the reasons which led to the arrest of the accused\nwould lead me to set him at liberty.”",
        "“Oh!”",
        "“Let me explain. If M. de Boiscoran is guilty, he has shown, in the\nway in which he received M. Galpin at the house, a perfectly unheard-\nof self-control, and a matchless genius for comedy. Therefore, if he\nis guilty, he is immensely clever\"–",
        "“But.”",
        "“Allow me to finish. If he is guilty, he has in the examination shown\na marvellous want of self-control, and, to be brief, a nameless\nstupidity: therefore, if he is guilty, he is immensely stupid\"–",
        "“But.”",
        "“Allow me to finish. Can one and the same person be at once so\nunusually clever and so unusually stupid? Judge yourself. But again:\nif M. de Boiscoran is guilty, he ought to be sent to the insane\nasylum, and not to prison; for any one else but a madman would have\npoured out the dirty water in which he had washed his blackened hands,\nand would have buried anywhere that famous breech-loader, of which the\nprosecution makes such good use.”",
        "“Jacques is safe!” exclaimed M. de Chandore.",
        "M. Seneschal was not so easily won over.",
        "“That is specious pleading,” he said. “Unfortunately, we want\nsomething more than a logic conclusion to meet a jury with an\nabundance of witnesses on the other side.”",
        "“We will find more on our side.”",
        "“What do you propose to do?”",
        "“I do not know. I have just told you my first impression. Now I must\nstudy the case, and examine the witnesses, beginning with old\nAnthony.”",
        "M. de Chandore had risen. He said,–",
        "“We can reach Boiscoran in an hour. Shall I send for my carriage?”",
        "“As quickly as possible,” replied the young lawyer.",
        "M. de Chandore’s servant was back in a quarter of an hour, and\nannounced that the carriage was at the door. M. de Chandore and M.\nFolgat took their seats; and, while they were getting in, the mayor\nwarned the young Paris lawyer,–",
        "“Above all, be prudent and circumspect. The public mind is already but\ntoo much inflamed. Politics are mixed up with the case. I am afraid of\nsome disturbance at the burial of the firemen; and they bring me word\nthat Dr. Seignebos wants to make a speech at the graveyard. Good-by\nand good luck!”",
        "The driver whipped the horse, and, as the carriage was going down\nthrough the suburbs, M. de Chandore said,–",
        "“I cannot understand why Anthony did not come to me immediately after\nhis master had been arrested. What can have happened to him?”",
