        "The studio was filled with the rich odor of roses, and when the\nlight summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden there came\nthrough the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more\ndelicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.",
        "From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was\nlying, smoking, as usual, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton\ncould just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-colored\nblossoms of the laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able\nto bear the burden of a beauty so flame-like as theirs; and now and\nthen the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long\ntussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge\nwindow, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him\nthink of those pallid jade-faced painters who, in an art that is\nnecessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and\nmotion.  The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through\nthe long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round\nthe black-crocketed spires of the early June hollyhocks, seemed to\nmake the stillness more oppressive, and the dim roar of London was\nlike the bourdon note of a distant organ.",
        "In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the\nfull-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,\nand in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist\nhimself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago\ncaused, at the time, such public excitement, and gave rise to so many\nstrange conjectures.",
        "As he looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully\nmirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and\nseemed about to linger there.  But he suddenly started up, and,\nclosing [4] his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he\nsought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he\nfeared he might awake.",
        "“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,\"\nsaid Lord Henry, languidly.  “You must certainly send it next year to\nthe Grosvenor.  The Academy is too large and too vulgar.  The\nGrosvenor is the only place.”",
        "“I don’t think I will send it anywhere,” he answered, tossing his\nhead back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him\nat Oxford.  “No: I won’t send it anywhere.”",
        "Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows, and looked at him in amazement\nthrough the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such\nfanciful whorls from his heavy opium-tainted cigarette.  “Not send it\nanywhere?  My dear fellow, why?  Have you any reason?  What odd chaps\nyou painters are!  You do anything in the world to gain a reputation.\nAs soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away.  It is\nsilly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than\nbeing talked about, and that is not being talked about.  A portrait\nlike this would set you far above all the young men in England, and\nmake the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any\nemotion.”",
        "“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can’t\nexhibit it.  I have put too much of myself into it.”",
        "Lord Henry stretched his long legs out on the divan and shook with\nlaughter.",
        "“Yes, I knew you would laugh; but it is quite true, all the same.”",
        "“Too much of yourself in it!  Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you\nwere so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you,\nwith your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young\nAdonis, who looks as if he was made of ivory and rose-leaves.  Why,\nmy dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you–well, of course you have\nan intellectual expression, and all that.  But beauty, real beauty,\nends where an intellectual expression begins.  Intellect is in itself\nan exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face.  The moment\none sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or\nsomething horrid.  Look at the successful men in any of the learned\nprofessions.  How perfectly hideous they are!  Except, of course, in\nthe Church.  But then in the Church they don’t think.  A bishop keeps\non saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a\nboy of eighteen, and consequently he always looks absolutely\ndelightful.  Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never\ntold me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks.  I\nfeel quite sure of that.  He is a brainless, beautiful thing, who\nshould be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at,\nand always here in summer when we want something to chill our\nintelligence.  Don’t flatter yourself, Basil: you are not in the\nleast like him.”",
        "“You don’t understand me, Harry.  Of course I am not like him.  I\nknow that perfectly well.  Indeed, I should be sorry to look like\nhim.  You shrug your shoulders?  I am telling you the truth.  There\nis a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the\nsort of fatality that [5] seems to dog through history the faltering\nsteps of kings.  It is better not to be different from one’s fellows.\nThe ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world.  They can\nsit quietly and gape at the play.  If they know nothing of victory,\nthey are at least spared the knowledge of defeat.  They live as we\nall should live, undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet.\nThey neither bring ruin upon others nor ever receive it from alien\nhands.  Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are,–my\nfame, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks,–we will\nall suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”",
        "“Dorian Gray? is that his name?” said Lord Henry, walking across the\nstudio towards Basil Hallward.",
        "“Yes; that is his name.  I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”",
        "“But why not?”",
        "“Oh, I can’t explain.  When I like people immensely I never tell\ntheir names to any one.  It seems like surrendering a part of them.\nYou know how I love secrecy.  It is the only thing that can make\nmodern life wonderful or mysterious to us.  The commonest thing is\ndelightful if one only hides it.  When I leave town I never tell my\npeople where I am going.  If I did, I would lose all my pleasure.  It\nis a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great\ndeal of romance into one’s life.  I suppose you think me awfully\nfoolish about it?”",
        "“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, laying his hand upon his shoulder;\n“not at all, my dear Basil.  You seem to forget that I am married,\nand the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception\nnecessary for both parties.  I never know where my wife is, and my\nwife never knows what I am doing.  When we meet,–we do meet\noccasionally, when we dine out together, or go down to the duke’s,–\nwe tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious\nfaces.  My wife is very good at it,–much better, in fact, than I am.\nShe never gets confused over her dates, and I always do.  But when\nshe does find me out, she makes no row at all.  I sometimes wish she\nwould; but she merely laughs at me.”",
        "“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said Basil\nHallward, shaking his hand off, and strolling towards the door that\nled into the garden.  “I believe that you are really a very good\nhusband, but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues.\nYou are an extraordinary fellow.  You never say a moral thing, and\nyou never do a wrong thing.  Your cynicism is simply a pose.”",
        "“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I\nknow,” cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out\ninto the garden together, and for a time they did not speak.",
        "After a long pause Lord Henry pulled out his watch.  “I am afraid I\nmust be going, Basil,” he murmured, “and before I go I insist on your\nanswering a question I put to you some time ago.”",
        "“What is that?” asked Basil Hallward, keeping his eyes fixed on the\nground.",
        "“You know quite well.”",
        "“I do not, Harry.”",
        "[6] “Well, I will tell you what it is.”",
        "“Please don’t.”",
        "“I must.  I want you to explain to me why you won’t exhibit Dorian\nGray’s picture.  I want the real reason.”",
        "“I told you the real reason.”",
        "“No, you did not.  You said it was because there was too much of\nyourself in it.  Now, that is childish.”",
        "“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face,\n“every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the\nartist, not of the sitter.  The sitter is merely the accident, the\noccasion.  It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather\nthe painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.  The reason\nI will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown\nwith it the secret of my own soul.”",
        "Lord Harry laughed.  “And what is that?” he asked.",
        "“I will tell you,” said Hallward; and an expression of perplexity\ncame over his face.",
        "“I am all expectation, Basil,” murmured his companion, looking at\nhim.",
        "“Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,” answered the young\npainter; “and I am afraid you will hardly understand it.  Perhaps you\nwill hardly believe it.”",
        "Lord Henry smiled, and, leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy\nfrom the grass, and examined it.  “I am quite sure I shall understand\nit,” he replied, gazing intently at the little golden white-feathered\ndisk, “and I can believe anything, provided that it is incredible.”",
        "The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy lilac\nblooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the languid\nair.  A grasshopper began to chirrup in the grass, and a long thin\ndragon-fly floated by on its brown gauze wings.  Lord Henry felt as\nif he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart beating, and he wondered what\nwas coming.",
        "“Well, this is incredible,” repeated Hallward, rather bitterly,–\n“incredible to me at times.  I don’t know what it means.  The story\nis simply this.  Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s.\nYou know we poor painters have to show ourselves in society from time\nto time, just to remind the public that we are not savages.  With an\nevening coat and a white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a\nstock-broker, can gain a reputation for being civilized.  Well, after\nI had been in the room about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed\ndowagers and tedious Academicians, I suddenly became conscious that\nsome one was looking at me.  I turned half-way round, and saw Dorian\nGray for the first time.  When our eyes met, I felt that I was\ngrowing pale.  A curious instinct of terror came over me.  I knew\nthat I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was\nso fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my\nwhole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself.  I did not want any\nexternal influence in my life.  You know yourself, Harry, how\nindependent I am by nature.  My father destined me for the army.  I\ninsisted on [7] going to Oxford.  Then he made me enter my name at\nthe Middle Temple.  Before I had eaten half a dozen dinners I gave up\nthe Bar, and announced my intention of becoming a painter.  I have\nalways been my own master; had at least always been so, till I met\nDorian Gray.  Then–But I don’t know how to explain it to you.\nSomething seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible\ncrisis in my life.  I had a strange feeling that Fate had in store\nfor me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows.  I knew that if I spoke\nto Dorian I would become absolutely devoted to him, and that I ought\nnot to speak to him.  I grew afraid, and turned to quit the room.  It\nwas not conscience that made me do so: it was cowardice.  I take no\ncredit to myself for trying to escape.”",
        "“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil.\nConscience is the trade-name of the firm.  That is all.”",
        "“I don’t believe that, Harry.  However, whatever was my motive,– and\nit may have been pride, for I used to be very proud,–I certainly\nstruggled to the door.  There, of course, I stumbled against Lady\nBrandon.  ’You are not going to run away so soon, Mr. Hallward?’ she\nscreamed out.  You know her shrill horrid voice?”",
        "“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry,\npulling the daisy to bits with his long, nervous fingers.",
        "“I could not get rid of her.  She brought me up to Royalties, and\npeople with Stars and Garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic\ntiaras and hooked noses.  She spoke of me as her dearest friend.  I\nhad only met her once before, but she took it into her head to\nlionize me.  I believe some picture of mine had made a great success\nat the time, at least had been chattered about in the penny\nnewspapers, which is the nineteenth-century standard of immortality.\nSuddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose\npersonality had so strangely stirred me.  We were quite close, almost\ntouching.  Our eyes met again.  It was mad of me, but I asked Lady\nBrandon to introduce me to him.  Perhaps it was not so mad, after\nall.  It was simply inevitable.  We would have spoken to each other\nwithout any introduction.  I am sure of that.  Dorian told me so\nafterwards.  He, too, felt that we were destined to know each other.”",
        "“And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?  I know\nshe goes in for giving a rapid précis of all her guests.  I remember\nher bringing me up to a most truculent and red-faced old gentleman\ncovered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my ear, in\na tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody\nin the room, something like ’Sir Humpty Dumpty–you know–Afghan\nfrontier–Russian intrigues: very successful man–wife killed by an\nelephant–quite inconsolable–wants to marry a beautiful American\nwidow–everybody does nowadays–hates Mr. Gladstone–but very much\ninterested in beetles: ask him what he thinks of Schouvaloff.’  I\nsimply fled.  I like to find out people for myself.  But poor Lady\nBrandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods.\nShe either explains them entirely away, or tells one everything about\nthem except what one wants to know.  But what did she say about Mr.\nDorian Gray?”",
        "[8] “Oh, she murmured, ’Charming boy–poor dear mother and I quite\ninseparable–engaged to be married to the same man–I mean married on\nthe same day–how very silly of me!  Quite forget what he does–\nafraid he–doesn’t do anything–oh, yes, plays the piano–or is it\nthe violin, dear Mr. Gray?’  We could neither of us help laughing,\nand we became friends at once.”",
        "“Laughter is not a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is the best\nending for one,” said Lord Henry, plucking another daisy.",
        "Hallward buried his face in his hands.  “You don’t understand what\nfriendship is, Harry,” he murmured,–\"or what enmity is, for that\nmatter.  You like every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to\nevery one.”",
        "“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back,\nand looking up at the little clouds that were drifting across the\nhollowed turquoise of the summer sky, like ravelled skeins of glossy\nwhite silk.  “Yes; horribly unjust of you.  I make a great difference\nbetween people.  I choose my friends for their good looks, my\nacquaintances for their characters, and my enemies for their brains.\nA man can’t be too careful in the choice of his enemies.  I have not\ngot one who is a fool.  They are all men of some intellectual power,\nand consequently they all appreciate me.  Is that very vain of me?  I\nthink it is rather vain.”",
        "“I should think it was, Harry.  But according to your category I must\nbe merely an acquaintance.”",
        "“My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.”",
        "“And much less than a friend.  A sort of brother, I suppose?”",
        "“Oh, brothers!  I don’t care for brothers.  My elder brother won’t\ndie, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.”",
        "“Harry!”",
        "“My dear fellow, I am not quite serious.  But I can’t help detesting\nmy relations.  I suppose it comes from the fact that we can’t stand\nother people having the same faults as ourselves.  I quite sympathize\nwith the rage of the English democracy against what they call the\nvices of the upper classes.  They feel that drunkenness, stupidity,\nand immorality should be their own special property, and that if any\none of us makes an ass of himself he is poaching on their preserves.\nWhen poor Southwark got into the Divorce Court, their indignation was\nquite magnificent.  And yet I don’t suppose that ten per cent of the\nlower orders live correctly.”",
        "“I don’t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is\nmore, Harry, I don’t believe you do either.”",
        "Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard, and tapped the toe of his\npatent-leather boot with a tasselled malacca cane.  “How English you\nare, Basil!  If one puts forward an idea to a real Englishman,–\nalways a rash thing to do,–he never dreams of considering whether\nthe idea is right or wrong.  The only thing he considers of any\nimportance is whether one believes it one’s self.  Now, the value of\nan idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man\nwho expresses it.  Indeed, the probabilities are that the more\ninsincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be,\nas in that case it [9] will not be colored by either his wants, his\ndesires, or his prejudices.  However, I don’t propose to discuss\npolitics, sociology, or metaphysics with you.  I like persons better\nthan principles.  Tell me more about Dorian Gray.  How often do you\nsee him?”",
        "“Every day.  I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day.  Of\ncourse sometimes it is only for a few minutes.  But a few minutes\nwith somebody one worships mean a great deal.”",
        "“But you don’t really worship him?”",
        "“I do.”",
        "“How extraordinary!  I thought you would never care for anything but\nyour painting,–your art, I should say.  Art sounds better, doesn’t\nit?”",
        "“He is all my art to me now.  I sometimes think, Harry, that there\nare only two eras of any importance in the history of the world.  The\nfirst is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the second is\nthe appearance of a new personality for art also.  What the invention\nof oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of Antinoüs was to\nlate Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to\nme.  It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from him, model\nfrom him.  Of course I have done all that.  He has stood as Paris in\ndainty armor, and as Adonis with huntsman’s cloak and polished boar-\nspear.  Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms, he has sat on the prow of\nAdrian’s barge, looking into the green, turbid Nile.  He has leaned\nover the still pool of some Greek woodland, and seen in the water’s\nsilent silver the wonder of his own beauty.  But he is much more to\nme than that.  I won’t tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I\nhave done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot express\nit.  There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that the\nwork I have done since I met Dorian Gray is good work, is the best\nwork of my life.  But in some curious way–I wonder will you\nunderstand me?–his personality has suggested to me an entirely new\nmanner in art, an entirely new mode of style.  I see things\ndifferently, I think of them differently.  I can now re-create life\nin a way that was hidden from me before.  ’A dream of form in days of\nthought,’–who is it who says that?  I forget; but it is what Dorian\nGray has been to me.  The merely visible presence of this lad, –for\nhe seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over\ntwenty,–his merely visible presence,–ah!  I wonder can you realize\nall that that means?  Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a\nfresh school, a school that is to have in itself all the passion of\nthe romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek.\nThe harmony of soul and body,–how much that is!  We in our madness\nhave separated the two, and have invented a realism that is bestial,\nan ideality that is void.  Harry!  Harry! if you only knew what\nDorian Gray is to me!  You remember that landscape of mine, for which\nAgnew offered me such a huge price, but which I would not part with?\nIt is one of the best things I have ever done.  And why is it so?\nBecause, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me.”",
        "“Basil, this is quite wonderful!  I must see Dorian Gray.”  Hallward\ngot up from the seat, and walked up and down the [10] garden.  After\nsome time he came back.  “You don’t understand, Harry,” he said.\n“Dorian Gray is merely to me a motive in art.  He is never more\npresent in my work than when no image of him is there.  He is simply\na suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner.  I see him in the\ncurves of certain lines, in the loveliness and the subtleties of\ncertain colors.  That is all.”",
        "“Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?”",
        "“Because I have put into it all the extraordinary romance of which,\nof course, I have never dared to speak to him.  He knows nothing\nabout it.  He will never know anything about it.  But the world might\nguess it; and I will not bare my soul to their shallow, prying eyes.\nMy heart shall never be put under their microscope.  There is too\nmuch of myself in the thing, Harry,–too much of myself!”",
        "“Poets are not so scrupulous as you are.  They know how useful\npassion is for publication.  Nowadays a broken heart will run to many\neditions.”",
        "“I hate them for it.  An artist should create beautiful things, but\nshould put nothing of his own life into them.  We live in an age when\nmen treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography.  We\nhave lost the abstract sense of beauty.  If I live, I will show the\nworld what it is; and for that reason the world shall never see my\nportrait of Dorian Gray.”",
        "“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won’t argue with you.  It is\nonly the intellectually lost who ever argue.  Tell me, is Dorian Gray\nvery fond of you?”",
        "Hallward considered for a few moments.  “He likes me,” he answered,\nafter a pause; “I know he likes me.  Of course I flatter him\ndreadfully.  I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I\nknow I shall be sorry for having said.  I give myself away.  As a\nrule, he is charming to me, and we walk home together from the club\narm in arm, or sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things.  Now\nand then, however, he is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a\nreal delight in giving me pain.  Then I feel, Harry, that I have\ngiven away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a\nflower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity,\nan ornament for a summer’s day.”",
        "“Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger.  Perhaps you will tire\nsooner than he will.  It is a sad thing to think of, but there is no\ndoubt that Genius lasts longer than Beauty.  That accounts for the\nfact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves.  In the\nwild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures,\nand so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of\nkeeping our place.  The thoroughly well informed man,–that is the\nmodern ideal.  And the mind of the thoroughly well informed man is a\ndreadful thing.  It is like a bric-à-brac shop, all monsters and\ndust, and everything priced above its proper value.  I think you will\ntire first, all the same.  Some day you will look at Gray, and he\nwill seem to you to be a little out of drawing, or you won’t like his\ntone of color, or something.  You will bitterly reproach him in your\nown heart, and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you.\nThe next time he calls, you will be [11] perfectly cold and\nindifferent.  It will be a great pity, for it will alter you.  The\nworst of having a romance is that it leaves one so unromantic.”",
        "“Harry, don’t talk like that.  As long as I live, the personality of\nDorian Gray will dominate me.  You can’t feel what I feel.  You\nchange too often.”",
        "“Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it.  Those who are\nfaithful know only the pleasures of love: it is the faithless who\nknow love’s tragedies.”  And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty\nsilver case, and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and\nself-satisfied air, as if he had summed up life in a phrase.  There\nwas a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the ivy, and the blue cloud-\nshadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows.  How\npleasant it was in the garden!  And how delightful other people’s\nemotions were!–much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to\nhim.  One’s own soul, and the passions of one’s friends,–those were\nthe fascinating things in life.  He thought with pleasure of the\ntedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil\nHallward.  Had he gone to his aunt’s, he would have been sure to meet\nLord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about\nthe housing of the poor, and the necessity for model lodging-houses.\nIt was charming to have escaped all that!  As he thought of his aunt,\nan idea seemed to strike him.  He turned to Hallward, and said, “My\ndear fellow, I have just remembered.”",
        "“Remembered what, Harry?”",
        "“Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.”",
        "“Where was it?” asked Hallward, with a slight frown.",
        "“Don’t look so angry, Basil.  It was at my aunt’s, Lady Agatha’s.\nShe told me she had discovered a wonderful young man, who was going\nto help her in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray.  I am\nbound to state that she never told me he was good-looking.  Women\nhave no appreciation of good looks.  At least, good women have not.\nShe said that he was very earnest, and had a beautiful nature.  I at\nonce pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair,\nhorridly freckled, and tramping about on huge feet.  I wish I had\nknown it was your friend.”",
        "“I am very glad you didn’t, Harry.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“I don’t want you to meet him.”",
        "“Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,” said the butler, coming into\nthe garden.",
        "“You must introduce me now,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.",
        "Basil Hallward turned to the servant, who stood blinking in the\nsunlight.  “Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I will be in in a few\nmoments.”  The man bowed, and went up the walk.",
        "Then he looked at Lord Henry.  “Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,” he\nsaid.  “He has a simple and a beautiful nature.  Your aunt was quite\nright in what she said of him.  Don’t spoil him for me.  Don’t try to\ninfluence him.  Your influence would be bad.  The world is wide, and\nhas many marvellous people in it.
