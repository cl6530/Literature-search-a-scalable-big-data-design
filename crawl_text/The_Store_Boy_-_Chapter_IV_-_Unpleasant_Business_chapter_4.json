        "It was now nine o’clock, rather a late hour for callers in the\ncountry, and Mrs. Barclay waited not without curiosity to hear the\nnature of the business which had brought her two visitors at that\ntime.",
        "“Take seats, gentlemen,” she said, with the courtesy habitual to her.",
        "Squire Davenport, who was disposed to consider that he had a right to\nthe best of everything, seated himself in the rocking-chair, and\nsigned his companion to a cane chair beside him.",
        "“Mr. Kirk,” he commenced, “is thinking of coming to Pentonville to\nlive.”",
        "“I am glad to hear it,” said Mrs. Barclay politely.  Perhaps she would\nnot have said this if she had known what was coming next.",
        "“He is a carpenter,” continued the squire, “and, as we have none in\nthe village except old Mr. Wade, who is superannuated, I think he will\nfind enough to do to keep him busy.”",
        "“I should think so,” assented the widow.",
        "“If he does not, I can employ him a part of the time on my land.”",
        "“What has all this to do with me?” thought Mrs. Barclay.",
        "She soon learned.",
        "“Of course he will need a house,” pursued the squire, “and as his\nfamily is small, he thinks this house will just suit him.”",
        "“But I don’t wish to sell,” said the widow hurriedly.  “I need this\nhouse for Ben and myself.”",
        "“You could doubtless find other accommodations.  I dare say you could\nhire a couple of rooms from Elnathan Perkins.”",
        "“I wouldn’t live in that old shell,” said Mrs. Barclay rather\nindignantly, “and I am sure Ben wouldn’t.”",
        "“I apprehend Benjamin will have no voice in the matter,” said Squire\nDavenport stiffly.  “He is only a boy.”",
        "“He is my main support, and my main adviser,” said Mrs. Barclay, with\nspirit, “and I shall not take any step which is disagreeable to him.”",
        "Mr. Kirk looked disappointed, but the squire gave him an assuring\nlook, as the widow could see.",
        "“Perhaps you may change your mind,” said the squire significantly.  “I\nam under the impression that I hold a mortgage on this property.”",
        "“Yes, sir,” assented Mrs. Barclay apprehensively.",
        "“For the sum of seven hundred dollars, if I am not mistaken.”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“I shall have need of this money for other purposes, and will trouble\nyou to take it up.”",
        "“I was to have three months’ notice,” said the widow, with a troubled\nlook.",
        "“I will give you three months’ notice to-night,” said the squire.",
        "“I don’t know where to raise the money,” faltered Mrs. Barclay.",
        "“Then you had better sell to my friend here.  He will assume the\nmortgage and pay you three hundred dollars.”",
        "“But that will be only a thousand dollars for the place.”",
        "“A very fair price, in my opinion, Mrs. Barclay.”",
        "“I have always considered it worth fifteen hundred dollars,” said the\nwidow, very much disturbed.",
        "“A fancy price, my dear madam; quite an absurd price, I assure you.\nWhat do you say, Kirk?”",
        "“I quite agree with you, squire,” said Kirk, in a strong, nasal tone.\n“But then, women don’t know anything of business.”",
        "“I know that you and your cousin are trying to take advantage of my\npoverty,” said Mrs. Barclay bitterly.  “If you are a carpenter, why\ndon’t you build a house for yourself, instead of trying to deprive me\nof mine?”",
        "“That’s my business,” said Kirk rudely.",
        "“Mr. Kirk cannot spare the time to build at present,” said the squire.",
        "“Then why doesn’t he hire rooms from Elnathan Perkins, as you just\nrecommended to me?”",
        "“They wouldn’t suit him,” said the squire curtly.  “He has set his\nmind on this house.”",
        "“Squire Davenport,” said Mrs. Barclay, in a softened voice, “I am sure\nyou cannot understand what you ask of me when you seek to take my home\nand turn me adrift.  Here I lived with my poor husband; here my boy\nwas born.  During my married life I have had no other home.  It is a\nhumble dwelling, but it has associations and charms for me which it\ncan never have for no one else.  Let Mr. Kirk see some other house and\nleave me undisturbed in mine.”",
        "“Humph!” said the squire, shrugging his shoulders; “you look upon the\nmatter from a sentimental point of view.  That is unwise.  It is\nsimply a matter of business.  You speak of the house as yours.  In\nreality, it is more mine than yours, for I have a major interest in\nit.  Think over my proposal coolly, and you will see that you are\nunreasonable.  Mr. Kirk may be induced to give you a little more–say\nthree hundred and fifty dollars–over and above the mortgage, which,\nas I said before, he is willing assume.”",
        "“How does it happen that you are willing to let the mortgage remain,\nif he buys, when you want the money for other purposes?” asked the\nwidow keenly.",
        "“He is a near relative of my wife, and that makes the difference, I\napprehend.”",
        "“Well, madam, what do you say?” asked Kirk briskly.",
        "“I say this, that I will keep the house if I can.”",
        "“You needn’t expect that I will relent,” said the squire hastily.",
        "“I do not, for I see there is no consideration in your heart for a\npoor widow; but I cannot help thinking that Providence will raise up\nsome kind friend who will buy the mortgage, or in some other way will\nenable me to save my home.”",
        "You are acting very foolishly, Mrs. Barclay, as you will realize in\ntime.  I give you a week in which to change your mind.  Till then my\nfriend Kirk’s offer stands good.  After that I cannot promise.  If the\nproperty sold at auction I shouldn’t he surprised if it did not fetch\nmore than the amount of my lien upon it.”",
        "“I will trust in Providence, Squire Davenport.”",
        "“Providence won’t pay off your mortgage, ma’am,” said Kirk, with a\ncoarse laugh.",
        "Mrs. Barclay did not answer.  She saw that he was a man of coarse\nfiber and did not care to notice him.",
        "“Come along, Kirk,” said the squire.  “I apprehend she will be all\nright after a while.  Mrs. Barclay will see her own interest when she\ncomes to reflect.”",
        "“Good-evening, ma’am,” said Kirk.",
        "Mrs. Barclay inclined her head slowly, but did not reply.",
        "When the two had left the house she sank into a chair and gave herself\nto painful thoughts.  She had known that Squire Davenport had the\nright to dispossess her, but had not supposed he would do so as long\nas she paid the interest regularly.  In order to do this, she and Ben\nhad made earnest efforts, and denied themselves all but the barest\nnecessities.  Thus far she had succeeded.  The interest on seven\nhundred dollars at six per cent. had amounted to forty-two dollars,\nand this was a large sum to pay, but thus far they had always had it\nready.  That Squire Davenport, with his own handsome mansion, would\nfix covetous eyes on her little home, she had not anticipated, but it\nhad come to pass.",
        "As to raising seven hundred dollars to pay off the mortgage, or induce\nany capitalist to furnish it, she feared it would be quite impossible.",
        "She anxiously waited for Ben’s return from the Town Hall in order to\nconsult with him.",
