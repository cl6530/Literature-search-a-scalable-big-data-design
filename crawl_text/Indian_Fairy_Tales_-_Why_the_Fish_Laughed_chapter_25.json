        "As a certain fisherwoman passed by a palace crying her fish, the queen\nappeared at one of the windows and beckoned her to come near and show\nwhat she had. At that moment a very big fish jumped about in the bottom\nof the basket.",
        "“Is it a he or a she?” inquired the queen. “I wish to purchase a she\nfish.”",
        "On hearing this the fish laughed aloud.",
        "“It’s a he,” replied the fisherwoman, and proceeded on her rounds.",
        "The queen returned to her room in a great rage; and on coming to see\nher in the evening, the king noticed that something had disturbed her.",
        "“Are you indisposed?” he said.",
        "“No; but I am very much annoyed at the strange behaviour of a fish. A\nwoman brought me one to-day, and on my inquiring whether it was a male\nor female, the fish laughed most rudely.”",
        "“A fish laugh! Impossible! You must be dreaming.”",
        "“I am not a fool. I speak of what I have seen with my own eyes and have\nheard with my own ears.”",
        "“Passing strange! Be it so. I will inquire concerning it.”",
        "On the morrow the king repeated to his vizier what his wife had told\nhim, and bade him investigate the matter, and be ready with a\nsatisfactory answer within six months, on pain of death. The vizier\npromised to do his best, though he felt almost certain of failure. For\nfive months he laboured indefatigably to find a reason for the laughter\nof the fish. He sought everywhere and from every one. The wise and\nlearned, and they who were skilled in magic and in all manner of\ntrickery, were consulted. Nobody, however, could explain the matter;\nand so he returned broken-hearted to his house, and began to arrange\nhis affairs in prospect of certain death, for he had had sufficient\nexperience of the king to know that His Majesty would not go back from\nhis threat. Amongst other things, he advised his son to travel for a\ntime, until the king’s anger should have somewhat cooled.",
        "The young fellow, who was both clever and handsome, started off\nwhithersoever Kismat might lead him. He had been gone some days, when\nhe fell in with an old farmer, who also was on a journey to a certain\nvillage. Finding the old man very pleasant, he asked him if he might\naccompany him, professing to be on a visit to the same place. The old\nfarmer agreed, and they walked along together. The day was hot, and the\nway was long and weary.",
        "“Don’t you think it would be pleasanter if you and I sometimes gave one\nanother a lift?” said the youth.",
        "“What a fool the man is!” thought the old farmer.",
        "Presently they passed through a field of corn ready for the sickle, and\nlooking like a sea of gold as it waved to and fro in the breeze.",
        "“Is this eaten or not?” said the young man.",
        "Not understanding his meaning, the old man replied, “I don’t know.”",
        "After a little while the two travellers arrived at a big village, where\nthe young man gave his companion a clasp-knife, and said, “Take this,\nfriend, and get two horses with it; but mind and bring it back, for it\nis very precious.”",
        "The old man, looking half amused and half angry, pushed back the knife,\nmuttering something to the effect that his friend was either a fool\nhimself or else trying to play the fool with him. The young man\npretended not to notice his reply, and remained almost silent till they\nreached the city, a short distance outside which was the old farmer’s\nhouse. They walked about the bazar and went to the mosque, but nobody\nsaluted them or invited them to come in and rest.",
        "“What a large cemetery!” exclaimed the young man.",
        "“What does the man mean,” thought the old farmer, “calling this largely\npopulated city a cemetery?”",
        "On leaving the city their way led through a cemetery where a few people\nwere praying beside a grave and distributing chapatis and kulchas to\npassers-by, in the name of their beloved dead. They beckoned to the two\ntravellers and gave them as much as they would.",
        "“What a splendid city this is!” said the young man.",
        "“Now, the man must surely be demented!” thought the old farmer. “I\nwonder what he will do next? He will be calling the land water, and the\nwater land; and be speaking of light where there is darkness, and of\ndarkness when it is light.” However, he kept his thoughts to himself.",
        "Presently they had to wade through a stream that ran along the edge of\nthe cemetery. The water was rather deep, so the old farmer took of his\nshoes and paijamas and crossed over; but the young man waded through it\nwith his shoes and paijamas on.",
        "“Well! I never did see such a perfect fool, both in word and in deed,\"\nsaid the old man to himself.",
        "However, he liked the fellow; and thinking that he would amuse his wife\nand daughter, he invited him to come and stay at his house as long as\nhe had occasion to remain in the village.",
        "“Thank you very much,” the young man replied; “but let me first\ninquire, if you please, whether the beam of your house is strong.”",
        "The old farmer left him in despair, and entered his house laughing.",
        "“There is a man in yonder field,” he said, after returning their\ngreetings. “He has come the greater part of the way with me, and I\nwanted him to put up here as long as he had to stay in this village.\nBut the fellow is such a fool that I cannot make anything out of him.\nHe wants to know if the beam of this house is all right. The man must\nbe mad!” and saying this, he burst into a fit of laughter.",
        "“Father,” said the farmer’s daughter, who was a very sharp and wise\ngirl, “this man, whosoever he is, is no fool, as you deem him. He only\nwishes to know if you can afford to entertain him.”",
        "“Oh! of course,” replied the farmer. “I see. Well perhaps you can help\nme to solve some of his other mysteries. While we were walking together\nhe asked whether he should carry me or I should carry him, as he\nthought that would be a pleasanter mode of proceeding.”",
        "“Most assuredly,” said the girl. “He meant that one of you should tell\na story to beguile the time.”",
        "“Oh yes. Well, we were passing through a corn-field, when he asked me\nwhether it was eaten or not.”",
        "“And didn’t you know the meaning of this, father? He simply wished to\nknow if the man was in debt or not; because, if the owner of the field\nwas in debt, then the produce of the field was as good as eaten to him;\nthat is, it would have to go to his creditors.”",
        "“Yes, yes, yes; of course! Then, on entering a certain village, he bade\nme take his clasp knife and get two horses with it, and bring back the\nknife again to him.”",
        "“Are not two stout sticks as good as two horses for helping one along\non the road? He only asked you to cut a couple of sticks and be careful\nnot to lose his knife.”",
        "“I see,” said the farmer. “While we were walking over the city we did\nnot see anybody that we knew, and not a soul gave us a scrap of\nanything to eat, till we were passing the cemetery; but there some\npeople called to us and put into our hands some chapatis and kulchas;\nso my companion called the city a cemetery, and the cemetery a city.”",
        "“This also is to be understood, father, if one thinks of the city as\nthe place where everything is to be obtained, and of inhospitable\npeople as worse than the dead. The city, though crowded with people,\nwas as if dead, as far as you were concerned; while, in the cemetery,\nwhich is crowded with the dead, you were saluted by kind friends and\nprovided with bread.”",
        "“True, true!” said the astonished farmer. “Then, just now, when we were\ncrossing the stream, he waded through it without taking off his shoes\nand paijamas.”",
        "“I admire his wisdom,” replied the girl. “I have often thought how\nstupid people were to venture into that swiftly flowing stream and over\nthose sharp stones with bare feet. The slightest stumble and they would\nfall, and be wetted from head to foot. This friend of yours is a most\nwise man. I should like to see him and speak to him.”",
        "“Very well,” said the farmer; “I will go and find him, and bring him\nin.”",
        "“Tell him, father, that our beams are strong enough, and then he will\ncome in. I’ll send on ahead a present to the man, to show him that we\ncan afford to have him for our guest.”",
        "Accordingly she called a servant and sent him to the young man with a\npresent of a basin of ghee, twelve chapatis, and a jar of milk, and the\nfollowing message:–\"O friend, the moon is full; twelve months make a\nyear, and the sea is overflowing with water.”",
        "Half-way the bearer of this present and message met his little son,\nwho, seeing what was in the basket, begged his father to give him some\nof the food. His father foolishly complied. Presently he saw the young\nman, and gave him the rest of the present and the message.",
        "“Give your mistress my salam,” he replied, “and tell her that the moon\nis new, and that I can only find eleven months in the year, and the sea\nis by no means full.”",
        "Not understanding the meaning of these words, the servant repeated them\nword for word, as he had heard them, to his mistress; and thus his\ntheft was discovered, and he was severely punished. After a little\nwhile the young man appeared with the old farmer. Great attention was\nshown to him, and he was treated in every way as if he were the son of\na great man, although his humble host knew nothing of his origin. At\nlength he told them everything–about the laughing of the fish, his\nfather’s threatened execution, and his own banishment–and asked their\nadvice as to what he should do.",
        "“The laughing of the fish,” said the girl, “which seems to have been\nthe cause of all this trouble, indicates that there is a man in the\npalace who is plotting against the king’s life.”",
        "“Joy, joy!” exclaimed the vizier’s son. “There is yet time for me to\nreturn and save my father from an ignominious and unjust death, and the\nking from danger.”",
        "The following day he hastened back to his own country, taking with him\nthe farmer’s daughter. Immediately on arrival he ran to the palace and\ninformed his father of what he had heard. The poor vizier, now almost\ndead from the expectation of death, was at once carried to the king, to\nwhom he repeated the news that his son had just brought.",
        "“Never!” said the king.",
        "“But it must be so, Your Majesty,” replied the vizier; “and in order to\nprove the truth of what I have heard, I pray you to call together all\nthe maids in your palace, and order them to jump over a pit, which must\nbe dug. We’ll soon find out whether there is any man there.”",
        "The king had the pit dug, and commanded all the maids belonging to the\npalace to try to jump it. All of them tried, but only one succeeded.\nThat one was found to be a man!!",
        "Thus was the queen satisfied, and the faithful old vizier saved.",
        "Afterwards, as soon as could be, the vizier’s son married the old\nfarmer’s daughter; and a most happy marriage it was.",
