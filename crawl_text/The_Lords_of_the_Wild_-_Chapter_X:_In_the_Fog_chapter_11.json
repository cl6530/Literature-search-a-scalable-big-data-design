        "When Robert went into the fog and began to creep from stump to stump,\nhis imagination leaped up at once and put a foe at every point in\nfront of him. Perhaps he deserved more credit for courage and daring\nthan any of the others, because his vivid fancy foresaw all the\ndangers and more. Tayoga was on his right and Willet on his left.\nDaganoweda, who had all the eagerness of Black Rifle himself, was\nfarther down the line. Flashes of fire appeared now and then in the\nfog ahead of them, and bullets hummed over their heads.",
        "Robert, essentially humane, began to share, nevertheless, the zeal of\nthese hunters of men around him. The French and Canadians were seeking\ntheir lives and they must strike back. He peered through the fog,\nlooking for a chance to fire, forgetting the wet ground, and the rain\nwhich was fast soaking him through and through. He was concerned only\nto keep his rifle and powder dry. Two flashes on his right showed that\nthe defenders were already replying.",
        "“We cannot go much farther, Dagaeoga,” whispered Tayoga, “or we will\nbe among them. I shall take this stump just ahead.”",
        "“And I the one beside it. I don’t mind admitting that a thick stump\nbetween you and your enemy is a good thing.”",
        "He sank down behind his chosen bulwark, and stared through the fog.\nThe flashes of fire continued, but they were on his right and left,\nand nothing appeared directly in front of him. A cry came from a point\nfarther down the line. One of the defenders had been hit and presently\nanother fell. Robert again saw all the dangers and more, but his mind\nwas in complete command of his body and he watched with unfailing\nvigilance. He saw Willet suddenly level his rifle across his\nprotecting stump and fire. No cry came in response, but he believed\nthat the hunter’s bullet had found its target. Tayoga also pulled\ntrigger, but Robert did not yet see anything at which to aim,\nalthough the sound of shots from the two hostile fronts was now almost\ncontinuous.",
        "The combat in the dim mists had a certain weird quality and Robert’s\nimaginative mind heightened its effect. It was almost like the blind\nshooting at the blind. A pink dot would appear in the fog, expand a\nlittle, and then go out. There would be a sharp report, the whistling\nof a bullet, perhaps, and that was all. The white men fought in\nsilence, and, if there were any Indians with the French and Canadians\nthey imitated them.",
        "Robert, at last, caught a glimpse of a dusky figure about thirty yards\nin front of him, and, aiming his rifle, quickly fired. He had no\nway of knowing that he had hit, save that no shot came in reply, but\nTayoga, who was once again ear to the ground, said that their foes\nwere drawing back a little.",
        "“They find our fire hotter than they had expected,” he said. “If they\ncan shoot in the fog so can we, and the Great Bear is more than a\nmatch for them in such a contest.”",
        "The whole line crept forward and paused again behind another row of\nstumps. A general volley met them and they found protection none too\nsoon. Bullets chipped little pieces off the stumps or struck in the\nground about them. But Robert knew that they had been fired largely\nat random, or had been drawn perhaps by a slight noise. There was a\nstrong temptation to return the fire in a like manner, but he had the\nstrength of mind to withhold his aim for the present, and not shoot\nuntil he had a sure target.",
        "Yet the dim battle in the fog increased in volume. More skirmishers\nfrom the forces of St. Luc came up, and the line of fire spread to\nboth left and right. A yell was heard now and then, and it was\nevident that the Indians in large numbers were coming into the combat.\nWillet’s band was reënforced also from the camp, and his line extended\nto meet that of the foe. Rifles cracked incessantly, the white fog\nwas sprinkled with pink dots, and, above the heads of the men, it was\ndarkened by the smoke that rose from the firing. At rare intervals a\ndeep cheer from a borderer replied to the savage war whoop.",
        "A man four stumps from Robert was hit in the head and died without\na sound, but Willet, firing at the flash of the rifle that slew him,\navenged his loss. A bullet grazed Robert’s head, cutting off two locks\nof hair very neatly. Its passage took his breath for a moment or two,\nand gave him a shock, but he recovered quickly, and, still controlling\nhis impulse to pull trigger in haste, looked for something at which to\naim.",
        "The fog had not lifted at all, but by gazing into its heart a long\ntime, Robert was able to see a little distance. Now and then the\nfigure of an enemy, as he leaped from the shelter of one stump to\nanother, was outlined dimly, but invariably there was not enough time\nfor a shot. Soon he made out a large stump not very far ahead of him,\nand he saw the flash of a rifle from it. He caught a glimpse only of\nthe hands that held the weapon, but he believed them to be a white\nman’s hands and he believed also that the man behind the stump was one\nof the best French sharpshooters.",
        "Robert resolved to bring down the Frenchman, who presently, when\nfiring once more, might then expose enough of himself for a target. He\nwaited patiently and the second shot came. He saw the hands again, the\narms, part of one shoulder and the side of the head, and taking quick\naim he pulled the trigger, though he was satisfied that his bullet had\nmissed.",
        "But the flame of battle was lighted in Robert’s soul. Hating nobody\nand wishing good to all, he nevertheless sought to kill, because some\none was seeking to kill him, and because killing was the business of\nthose about him. What came to be known later as mass psychology took\nhold of him. All his mental and physical powers were concentrated on\nthe single task of slaying an enemy. The affair now resolved itself\ninto a duel between single foes.",
        "Deciding to await a third shot from his enemy, he made his position\nbehind the stump a little easier, poised, as it were, ready to throw\nevery faculty, physical and mental, into his reply to that expected\nthird shot. He was quite sure, too, that he would have a chance,\nbecause the man had exposed so much more of himself at the second\nshot than at the first, and his escape from the bullets would make him\nexpose yet more at the third. His heart began to throb hard, and his\npulses were beating fast. The battle was still going on about him, but\nhe forgot all the rest of it, the shots, the shouts, the flashes, and\nremembered only his own part. He judged that in another minute the man\nwould show himself. So believing, he laid his rifle across his stump,\ncocked it, and was ready to take aim and fire in a few seconds.",
        "His foe’s head appeared, after just about the delay that he had\nexpected, and Robert’s hand sprang to the trigger at the very moment\nthe man pulled his own. The bullet hummed by his cheek. His finger\ncontracted and then it loosened. A sudden acuteness of vision, or a\nchance thinning of the fog at that point, enabled him to see the man’s\nface, and he recognized the French partisan, Charles Langlade, known\nalso to the Indians as the Owl, who, with his wife, the Dove, had once\nheld him in a captivity by no means unkind.",
        "His humane instincts, his gratitude, his feeling for another flared\nup even in that moment of battle and passion, when the man-hunting\nimpulse was so strong. His aim, quick as it was, had been sure and\ndeadly, but, deflecting the muzzle of the rifle a shade, his finger\ncontracted again. The spurt of fire leaped forth and the bullet sang\nby the ear of Langlade, singing to him a little song of caution as it\npassed, telling such a wary partisan as he that his stump was a very\nexposed stump, dangerous to the last degree, and that it would be\nbetter for him to find one somewhere else.",
        "Robert did not see the Owl go away, but he was quite sure that he had\ngone, because it was just the sort of thing that such a skilled forest\nfighter would do. The fog thickened again, and, in a few more minutes,\nboth lines shifted somewhat. Then he had to watch new stumps at new\npoints, and his thoughts were once more in tune with those about him,\nconcentrated on the battle and the man-hunt.",
        "A bullet tipped his ear, and he saw that it came from a stump hardly\nvisible in the fog. The sharpshooter was not likely to be Langlade\nagain, and, at once, it became Robert’s ambition to put him out of\naction. No consideration of mercy or humanity would restrain him now,\nif he obtained a chance of a good shot, and he waited patiently for\nit. Evidently this new sharpshooter had detected his presence also,\nand the second duel was on.",
        "The man fired again in a minute or two, and the bullet chipped very\nclose. He was so quick, too, that Robert did not get an opportunity to\nreturn his fire, but he recognized the face and to his great surprise\nsaw that it was De Courcelles who had taken a place in line with the\nskirmishers. Rage seized him at once. This was the man who had tried\nto trick him to his death in that affair with the bully, Boucher, at\nQuebec. He was shaken with righteous anger. All the kindliness and\nmercy that he had felt toward Langlade disappeared. He was sure, too,\nthat De Courcelles knew him and was trying his best to kill him.",
        "Robert peered over his stump and sought eagerly for a shot. He\ncould play at that game as well as De Courcelles, but his enemy was\ncautious. It was some time before he risked another bullet, and then\nRobert’s, in reply, missed, though he also had been untouched. His\nanger increased. Although he had little hate in his composition he\ncould not forget that this man De Courcelles had been a party to an\ninfamous attempt upon his life, and even now, in what amounted to a\nduel, was seeking to kill him. His own impulses, under such a spur,\nand for the moment, were those of the slayer. He used all the skill\nthat he had learned in the forest to secure an opportunity for the\ntaking of his foe’s life.",
        "Robert sought to draw De Courcelles’ fire again, meanwhile having\nreloaded his own rifle, and he raised his cap a little above the edge\nof the stump. But the trick was too old for the Frenchman and he did\nnot yield to it. Taking the chance, he thrust up his face, dropping\nback immediately as De Courcelles’ bullet sang over his head. Then he\nsprang up and was in time to pull trigger at his enemy, who fell back.",
        "Robert was able to tell in the single glimpse through the fog that De\nCourcelles was not killed. The bullet had struck him in the shoulder,\ninflicting a wound, certainly painful but probably not dangerous,\nalthough it was likely to feed the man’s hate of Robert. Even so,\nyoung Lennox was glad now that he had not killed him, that his death\nwas not upon his hands; it was enough to disable him and to drive him\nout of the battle.",
        "The fighting grew once more in volume and fury. Rifles cracked\ncontinuously up and down the line. The war whoop of the Indians was\nincessant, and the deep cheer of the borderers replied to it. But\nRobert saw that the end of the combat was near; not that the rage of\nman was abated, but because nature, as if tired of so much strife, was\nputting in between a veil that would hide the hostile forces from each\nother. The fog suddenly began to thicken rapidly, rolling up from the\nlake in great, white waves that made figures dim and shadowy, even a\nfew paces away.",
        "If the fighting went on it would be impossible to tell friend from\nfoe, and Willet at once sent forth a sharp call which was repeated up\nand down the line. The French leaders took like action, and, by mutual\nconsent, the two forces fell apart. The firing and the shouts ceased\nabruptly and a slow withdrawal was begun. The fog had conquered.",
        "“Is Dagaeoga hurt?” asked Tayoga.",
        "“Untouched,” replied Robert.",
        "“I saw that you and the Frenchman, De Courcelles, were engaged in a\nbattle of your own. I might have helped you, but if I know you, you\ndid not wish my aid.”",
        "“No, Tayoga. It was man to man. I confess that while our duel was on\nI was filled with rage against him, and tried my best to kill, but now\nI’m glad I gave him only a wound.”",
        "“Your hate flows away as De Courcelles’ blood flows out.”",
        "“If you want to put it that way. But do you hear anything of the\nenemy, Tayoga? Fog seems to be a conductor of sound now and then.”",
        "“Nothing except the light noises of withdrawal. The retreating\nfootsteps become fainter and fainter, and I think we shall have peace\nfor to-day. They might fire bullets at random against the camp, but\nSt. Luc will not let them waste lead in such a manner. No, Dagaeoga,\nwe will lie quiet now and dress our wounds.”",
        "He was right, as the firing was not renewed, though the pickets,\nstationed at short intervals, kept as sharp a watch as they could in\nthe fog, while the others lay by the fires which were now built higher\nthan usual. Colden was hopeful that St. Luc would draw off, but Tayoga\nand Black Rifle, who went out again into the fog, reported no sign of\nit. Beyond a doubt, he was prepared to maintain a long siege.",
        "“We must get help,” said Willet. “We’re supposed to control Lake\nGeorge and we know that forces of ours are at the south end, where\nthey’ve advanced since the taking of Fort William Henry. We’ll have to\nsend messengers.”",
        "“Who are they to be?” asked Colden.",
        "“Robert and Tayoga are most fit. You have plenty of boats. They can\ntake a light one and leave at once, while the fog holds.”",
        "Colden agreed. Young Lennox and the Onondaga were more than willing,\nand, in a half hour, everything was ready for the start. A strong\ncanoe with paddles for two was chosen and they put in it their rifles,\nplenty of ammunition and some food.",
        "“A year from now, if the war is still going on, I’ll be going with you\non such errands,” said Grosvenor confidently.",
        "“Red Coat speaks the truth. He learns fast,” said Tayoga.",
        "“I won’t tell you lads to be careful, because you don’t need any\nadvice,” said Willet.",
        "Many were at the water’s edge, when they pushed off, and Robert knew\nthat they were followed by the best of wishes, not only for their\nsuccess but for themselves also. A few strokes of the paddles and the\nwhole camp, save a luminous glow through the fog, was gone. A few more\nstrokes and the luminous glow too departed. The two were alone once\nmore in the wilderness, and they had little but instinct to guide them\nin their perilous journey upon the waters. But they were not afraid.\nRobert, instead, felt a curious exaltation of the spirit. He was\nsupremely confident that he and Tayoga would carry out their mission,\nin spite of everything.",
        "“It is odd how quickly the camp sank from sight,” he said.",
        "“It is because we are in the heart of a great fog,” said Tayoga.\n“Since it was thick enough to hide the battle it is thick enough\nalso to hide the camp and us from each other. But, Dagaeoga, it is a\nfriendly fog, as it conceals us from our enemies also.”",
        "“That’s so, Tayoga, but I’m thinking this fog will hold dangers for us\ntoo. St. Luc is not likely to neglect the lake, and he’ll surmise that\nwe’ll send for help. We’ve had experience on the water in fogs before,\nand you’ll have to use your ears as you did then.”",
        "“So I will, Dagaeoga. Suppose we stop now, and listen.”",
        "But nothing of a hostile nature came to them through the mists and\nvapors, and, resuming the paddles again, they bore more toward the\ncenter of the lake, where they thought they would be likely to escape\nthe cruising canoes of the enemy, if any should be sent out by St.\nLuc. They expected too that the fog would thin there, but it did not\ndo so, seeming to spread over the full extent of Andiatarocte.",
        "“How long do you think the fog will last?” asked Robert.",
        "“All day, I fear,” replied Tayoga.",
        "“That’s bad. If any of our friends should be on the shore we won’t be\nable to see ’em.”",
        "“But we have to make the best of it, Dagaeoga. We may be able to hear\nthem.”",
        "The fog was the greatest they had ever seen on Andiatarocte,\nseeming to ooze up from the depths of the waters, and to spread over\neverything. The keenest eyes, like those of Robert and Tayoga, could\npenetrate it only a few yards, and it hung in heavy, wet folds over\ntheir faces. It was difficult even to tell direction and they paddled\nvery slowly in a direction that they surmised led to the south. After\na while they stopped again that Tayoga might establish a new listening\npost upon the water, though nothing alarming yet came to those\nmarvelous ears of his. But it was evident that he expected peril, and\nRobert also anticipated it.",
        "“A force as large as St. Luc’s is sure to have brought canoes\noverland,” said young Lennox, “and in a fog like this he’ll have them\nlaunched on the lake.”",
        "“It is so,” said Tayoga, using his favorite expression, “and I think\nthey will come soon.”",
        "They moved on once more a few hundred yards, and then, when the\nOnondaga listened a long time, he announced that the hostile canoes\nwere on the lake, cruising about in the fog.",
        "“I hear one to the right of us, another to the left, and several\ndirectly ahead,” he said. “Sharp Sword brought plenty of canoes with\nhim and he is using them. I think they have formed a line across the\nlake, surmising that we would send a message to the south. Sharp Sword\nis a great leader, and he forgets nothing.”",
        "“They can’t draw a line that we won’t pass.”",
        "Now they began to use their paddles very slowly and gently, the canoe\nbarely creeping along, and Tayoga listening with all his powers. But\nthe Onondaga was aware that his were not the only keen ears on the\nlake, and that, gentle as was the movement of the paddies that he and\nRobert held, it might be heard.",
        "“The canoe on our right is coming in a little closer to us,” he\nwhispered. “It is a very large canoe, because it holds four paddles.\nI can trace the four separate sounds. They try to soften their strokes\nlest the hidden messenger whom they want to catch may hear them, but\nthey cannot destroy the sound altogether. Now, the one on the left is\nbearing in toward us also. I think they have made a chain across the\nlake, and hope to keep anything from passing.”",
        "“Can you hear those ahead of us?”",
        "“Very slightly, and only now and then, but it is enough to tell us\nthat they are still there. But, Dagaeoga, we must go ahead even if\nthey are before us; we cannot think of turning back.”",
        "“No such thought entered my head, Tayoga. We’ll run this gauntlet.”",
        "“That was what I knew you would say. The canoes from both right and\nleft still approach. I think they carry on a patrol in the fog, and\nmove back and forth, always keeping in touch. Now, we must go forward\na little, or they will be upon us, but be ever so gentle with the\npaddle, Dagaeoga. That is it! We make so little sound that it is no\nsound at all, and they cannot hear us. Now, we are well beyond them,\nand the two canoes are meeting in the fog. The men in them talk\ntogether. You hear them very well yourself, Dagaeoga. Their exact\nwords do not come to our ears, but we know they are telling one\nanother that no messenger from the beleaguered camp has yet passed.\nNow, they part and go back on their beat. We can afford to forget\nthem, Dagaeoga, and think of those ahead. We still have the real\ngauntlet to run. Be very gentle with the paddle again.",
        "“I hear the canoes ahead of us very clearly now. One of them is large\nalso with four paddles in it, and two of the men are Frenchmen. I\ncannot understand what they say, but I hear the French accent; the\nsound is not at all like that the warriors make. One of the Frenchmen\nis giving instructions, as I can tell by his tone of command, and I\nthink the canoes are going to spread out more. Yes, they are moving\naway to both right and left. They must feel sure that we are here\nsomewhere in the fog, trying to get by them, but the big canoe with\nthe Frenchmen in it keeps its place. Bear a little to the left,\nDagaeoga, and we can pass it unseen.”",
        "It was the most delicate of tasks to paddle the canoe, and cause\nscarcely a ripple in the water, but they were so skillful they were\nable to do it, and make no sound that Robert himself could hear.\nAlthough his nerves were steady his excitement was intense. A\nsituation so extraordinary put every power of his imagination into\nplay. His fancy fairly peopled the water with hostile canoes; they\nwere in a triple ring about him and Tayoga. All his pulses were\nbeating hard, yet his will, as usual, was master of his nerves, and\nthe hand that held the paddle never shook.",
        "“A canoe on the outer line, and from the left, is now bearing in\ntoward us,” whispered Tayoga.",
        "“There are two men in it, as the strokes of the paddles show. They are\ncoming toward us. Some evil spirit must have whispered to them that we\nare here. Ah, they have stopped! What does it mean, Dagaeoga? Listen!\nDid you not hear a little splash? They think to surprise us! They keep\nthe paddles silent and try a new trick! Hold the canoe here, Dagaeoga,\nand I will meet the warrior who comes!”",
        "The Onondaga dropped his rifle, hunting shirt and belt with his pistol\nin it, into the bottom of the canoe, and then, his knife in his teeth,\nhe was over the side so quickly that Robert did not have time to\nprotest. In an instant he was gone in the fog, and the youth in\nthe canoe could do nothing but wait, a prey to the most terrible\napprehensions.",
        "Robert, with an occasional motion of the paddle, held the canoe steady\non the water, and tried to pierce the fog with his eyes. He knew that\nhe must stay just where he was, or Tayoga, when he came back, might\nnever find him. If he came back! If–He listened with all his ears for\nsome sound, however slight, that might tell him what was happening.",
        "Out of the fog came a faint splash, and then a sigh that was almost\na groan. Young Lennox shuddered, and the hair on his head stood up a\nlittle. He knew that sound was made by a soul passing, but whose soul?\nOnce more he realized to the full that his lot was cast in wild and\nperilous places.",
        "A swimming face appeared in the fog, close to the canoe, and then his\nheart fell from his throat to its usual place. Tayoga climbed lightly\ninto the canoe, no easy feat in such a situation, put on his belt and\nreplaced the knife in the sheath. Robert asked him nothing, he had\nno need to do so. The sigh that was almost a groan had told the full\ntale.",
        "“Now we will bear to the right again, Dagaeoga,” said Tayoga, calmly,\nas the water dripped from him. Robert shivered once more. His fertile\nfancy reproduced that brief, fierce struggle in the water, but he said\nnothing, promptly following the suggestion of Tayoga, and sending the\ncanoe to the right. The position was too perilous, though, for them\nto continue on one course long, and at the end of forty or fifty yards\nthey stopped, both listening intently.",
        "“Some of them are talking with one another now,” whispered Tayoga.\n“The warrior who swam does not come back to his canoe, and they wonder\nwhy he stays in the water so long. Soon they will know that he is\nnever coming out of the water. Now I hear a voice raised somewhat\nabove the others. It is a French voice. It is not that of St. Luc,\nbecause he must remain on shore to direct his army. It is not that of\nDe Courcelles, because you wounded him, and he must be lying in camp\nnursing his hurts. So I conclude that it is Jumonville, who is next\nin rank and who therefore would be likely to command on this important\nservice. I am sure it is Jumonville, and his raised voice indicates\nthat he is giving orders. He realizes that the swimmer will not\nreturn and that we must be near. Perhaps he knows or guesses that the\nmessengers are you and I, because he has learned long since that we\nare fitted for just such service, and that we have done such deeds.\nFor instance, our journey to Quebec, on which we first met him.”",
        "“Then he’ll think Dave is here too, because he was with us then.”",
        "“No, he will be quite sure the Great Bear is not here. He knows that\nhe is too important in the defense of the camp, that, while Captain\nColden commands, it is the Great Bear who suggests and really directs\neverything. His sharp orders signify some sudden, new plan. They have\na fleet of canoes, and I think they are making a chain, with the links\nconnected so closely that we cannot pass. It is a real gauntlet for us\nto run, Dagaeoga.”",
        "“And how are we to run it?”",
        "“We must pass as warriors, as men of their own.”",
        "“I do not look like a warrior.”",
        "“But you can make yourself look like one, in the fog at least, enough,\nperhaps, to go by. Your hair is a little long; take off your hunting\nshirt, and the other shirt beneath it, bare yourself to the waist, and\nin such a fog as this it would take the keenest of eyes, only a few\nyards away, to tell that you are white. Quick, Dagaeoga! Lay the\ngarments on the bottom of the canoe. Bend well upon your paddle and\nappear to be searching the water everywhere for the messengers who try\nto escape. I will do the same. Ah, that is well. You look and act so\nmuch like a warrior of the woods, Dagaeoga, that even I, in the same\ncanoe, could well take you for a Huron. Now we will whisper no more\nfor a while, because they come, and they will soon be upon us.”",
        "Robert bent over his paddle. His upper clothing lay in the bottom of\nthe canoe, with his rifle and Tayoga’s upon the garments, ready to be\nsnatched up in an instant, if need should come. The cold, wet fog beat\nupon his bare shoulders and chest, but he did not feel it. Instead his\nblood was hot in every vein, and the great pulses in his temples beat\nso hard that they made a roaring in his ears.",
        "Distinct sounds now came from both left and right, the swish of\npaddles, the ripple of water against the side of a canoe, men talking.\nThey were coming to the chain that had been stretched in front of\nthem, and their fate would soon be decided. Now, they must be not only\nbrave to the uttermost, but they must be consummate actors too.",
        "Figures began to form themselves in the fog, the outline of a canoe\nwith two men in it appeared on their right, another showed just ahead,\nand two more on the left. Robert from his lowered eyes, bent over the\npaddle, caught a glimpse of the one ahead, a great canoe, or rather\nboat, containing five men, one of whom wielded no paddle, but who sat\nin its center, issuing orders. Through the fog came a slight gleam\nof metal from his epaulets and belt, and, although the face was\nindistinct, Robert knew that it was Jumonville.",
        "The officer was telling the canoes to keep close watch, not to let\nthe chain be broken, that the messengers were close at hand, that\nthey would soon be taken, and that their comrade who did not come\nback would be avenged. Robert bent a little lower over his paddle. His\nwhole body prickled, and the roaring in his ears increased.",
        "Tayoga suddenly struck him a smart blow across his bowed back,\nand spoke to him fiercely in harsh, guttural Huron. Robert did not\nunderstand the words, but they sounded like a stern rebuke for poor\nwork with the paddle. The blow and the words stimulated him, keyed him\nto a supreme effort as an actor. All his histrionic temperament flared\nup at once. He made a poor stroke with the paddle, threw up much\nsurplus water, and, as he cowered away from Tayoga, he corrected\nhimself hastily. Tayoga uttered a sharp rebuke again, but did not\nstrike a second time. That would have been too much. Robert’s next\nstroke was fine and sweeping, and he heard Jumonville say in French\nwhich many of the Indians understood:",
        "“Go more toward the center of the lake and take a place in the line.”",
        "Tayoga and Robert obeyed dumbly, passing Jumonville’s boat at a range\nof five or six yards, going a little beyond the line, and, turning\nabout as if to make a curve that would keep them from striking any\nother canoe. Again Robert made a false stroke with the paddle, causing\nthe canoe to rock dangerously, and now, Tayoga, fully justified by\nthe fierce code of the forest in striking him again, snatched his own\npaddle out of the water and gave him a smart rap with the flat of it\nacross the back, at the same time upbraiding him fiercely in Huron.",
        "“Dolt! Fool!” he exclaimed. “Will you never learn how to hold your\npaddle? Will you never know the stroke? Will you tip us both into the\nwater at such a time, when the messengers of the enemy are seeking\nto steal through? Do better with the paddle or you shall stay at home\nwith the old women, and work for the warriors!”",
        "Robert snarled in reply, but he did not repay the blow. He made\nanother awkward sweep that sent them farther on the outward curve, and\nhe heard Jumonville’s harsh laugh. He was still the superb actor. His\nexcitement was real, and he counterfeited a nervousness and jerkiness\nthat appeared real also. One more wild stroke, and they shot farther\nout. Jumonville angrily ordered them to return, but Robert seemed to\nbe possessed by a spell of awkwardness, and Tayoga craftily aided him.",
        "“Come back!” roared Jumonville.",
        "Robert and Tayoga were fifteen yards away, and the great blanket of\nfog was enclosing them.",
        "“Now! Now, Dagaeoga!” whispered the Onondaga tensely. “We paddle with\nall our might straight toward the south!”",
        "Two paddles wielded by skillful and powerful arms flashed in the\nwater, and the canoe sped on its way. A shout of anger rose behind\nthem, and Robert distinctly heard Jumonville say in French:",
        "“After them! After them! It was the messengers who stole by! They have\ntricked us!”",
        "Those words were sweet in the ears of young Lennox. He had played the\nactor, and the reward, the saving of their lives, had been paid. It\nwas one of their greatest triumphs and the savor of it would endure\nlong. The very thought gave fresh power to his arm and back, and he\nswept his paddle with a strength that he had never known before. The\ncanoe skimmed the water like a bird and fairly flew in their chosen\ncourse.",
        "Robert’s own faculties became marvelously acute. He heard behind them\nthe repeated and angry orders of Jumonville, the hurried strokes of\nmany paddles, the splashing of canoes turned quickly about, a hum\nof excited voices, and then he felt a great swell of confidence. The\nroaring in his ears was gone, his nerves became amazingly steady, and\nevery stroke with his paddle was long and finished, a work of art.",
        "Four or five minutes of such toil, and Tayoga rested on his paddle.\nRobert imitated him.",
        "“Now we will take our ease and listen,” said the Onondaga. “The fog\nis still our friend, and they will think we have turned to one side in\nit, because that is the natural thing to do. But you and I, Dagaeoga,\nwill not turn just yet.”",
        "“I can’t hear anything, Tayoga, can you?”",
        "“I cannot, Dagaeoga, but we will not have long to wait. Now, I catch\nthe light swish of a paddle. They are feeling about in the fog. There\ngoes another paddle–and more. They come closer, but we still bide\nhere a little. I hear the voice of Jumonville. He is very angry. But\nwhy should he be more angry at any other than at himself? He saw us\nwith his own eyes. He shouts many sharp orders, and some of them are\nfoolish. They must be so, because no man could shout orders so fast,\nand in such a confused way, and have them all good. He sends more\ncanoes to both right and left to seek us. You and I can afford to\nlaugh, Dagaeoga.”",
        "Sitting at rest in their canoe they laughed. With Robert it was not so\nmuch a laugh of amusement as a laugh of relief after such tremendous\ntension. He felt that they were now sure to escape, and with Tayoga he\nwaited calmly.",
