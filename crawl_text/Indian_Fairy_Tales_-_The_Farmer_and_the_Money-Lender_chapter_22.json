        "There was once a farmer who suffered much at the hands of a money-\nlender. Good harvests, or bad, the farmer was always poor, the money-\nlender rich. At the last, when he hadn’t a farthing left, farmer went\nto the money-lender’s house, and said, “You can’t squeeze water from a\nstone, and as you have nothing to get by me now, you might tell me the\nsecret of becoming rich.”",
        "“My friend,” returned the money-lender, piously, “riches come from Ram\n–ask him.”",
        "“Thank you, I will!” replied the simple farmer; so he prepared three\ngirdle-cakes to last him on the journey, and set out to find Ram.",
        "First he met a Brahman, and to him he gave a cake, asking him to point\nout the road to Ram; but the Brahman only took the cake and went on his\nway without a word, Next the farmer met a Jogi or devotee, and to him\nhe gave a cake, without receiving any help in return. At last, he came\nupon a poor man sitting under a tree, and finding out he was hungry,\nthe kindly farmer gave him his last cake, and sitting down to rest\nbeside him, entered into conversation.",
        "“And where are you going?” asked the poor man, at length.",
        "“Oh, I have a long journey before me, for I am going to find Ram!\"\nreplied the farmer. “I don’t suppose you could tell me which way to\ngo?”",
        "“Perhaps I can,” said the poor man, smiling, “for I am Ram! What\ndo you want of me?”",
        "Then the farmer told the whole story, and Ram, taking pity on him, gave\nhim a conch shell, and showed him how to blow it in a particular way,\nsaying, “Remember! whatever you wish for, you have only to blow the\nconch that way, and your wish will be fulfilled. Only have a care of\nthat money-lender, for even magic is not proof against their wiles!”",
        "The farmer went back to his village rejoicing. In fact the money-lender\nnoticed his high spirits at once, and said to himself, “Some good\nfortune must have befallen the stupid fellow, to make him hold his head\nso jauntily.” Therefore he went over to the simple farmer’s house, and\ncongratulated him on his good fortune, in such cunning words,\npretending to have heard all about it, that before long the farmer\nfound himself telling the whole story–all except the secret of blowing\nthe conch, for, with all his simplicity, the farmer was not quite such\na fool as to tell that.",
        "Nevertheless, the money-lender determined to have the conch by hook or\nby crook, and as he was villain enough not to stick at trifles, he\nwaited for a favourable opportunity and stole the conch.",
        "But, after nearly bursting himself with blowing the conch in every\nconceivable way, he was obliged to give up the secret as a bad job.\nHowever, being determined to succeed he went back to the farmer, and\nsaid, coolly, “Look here; I’ve got your conch, but I can’t use it; you\nhaven’t got it, so it’s clear you can’t use it either. Business is at a\nstand-still unless we make a bargain. Now, I promise to give you back\nyour conch, and never to interfere with your using it, on one\ncondition, which is this,–whatever you get from it, I am to get\ndouble.”",
        "“Never!” cried the farmer; “that would be the old business all over\nagain!”",
        "“Not at all!” replied the wily money-lender; “you will have your share!\nNow, don’t be a dog in the manger, for if you get all you want,\nwhat can it matter to you if I am rich or poor?”",
        "At last, though it went sorely against the grain to be of any benefit\nto a money-lender, the farmer was forced to yield, and from that time,\nno matter what he gained by the power of the conch, the money-lender\ngained double. And the knowledge that this was so preyed upon the\nfarmer’s mind day and night, so that he had no satisfaction out of\nanything.",
        "At last, there came a very dry season,–so dry that the farmer’s crops\nwithered for want of rain. Then he blew his conch, and wished for a\nwell to water them, and lo! there was the well, but the money-lender\nhad two!–two beautiful new wells! This was too much for any farmer\nto stand; and our friend brooded over it, and brooded over it, till at\nlast a bright idea came into his head. He seized the conch, blew it\nloudly, and cried out, “Oh, Ram! I wish to be blind of one eye!” And so\nhe, was, in a twinkling, but the money-lender of course was blind of\nboth, and in trying to steer his way between the two new wells, he fell\ninto one, and was drowned.",
        "Now this true story shows that a farmer once got the better of a money-\nlender–but only by losing one of his eyes.",
