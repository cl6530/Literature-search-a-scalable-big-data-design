        "Exmoor, like Dartmoor, can be approached from many different places, but\nto reach some of the finest and most typical stretches of the moor one\ncannot do better than choose Dulverton or Minehead. Porlock, six or\nseven miles by road (there is no railway) from Minehead, is a third\nplace admirably suited for getting on to Exmoor; it is the nearest place\nof any size to Dunkery Beacon, which is the highest shoulder of the moor\n(1707 feet). The drawing given here shows the valley of the Horner, a\nsmall stream rising on the heathery slopes of Dunkery Beacon, which\nappears in the distance. This valley is one of the most romantic spots\non Exmoor. After a long ride or ramble on foot over the open heather,\nwith sweeping views which include Dartmoor, South Wales, the hills\naround Bath, as well as Brown Willy in Cornwall, one finds the ground\nfalling steeply, and before long one is climbing down a water-worn path\namong sturdy oaks. The air also becomes full of the music of the rushing\nHorner below. The stream is eventually discovered boiling over mossy\nstones in the green shade of the close-growing trees filling the deep\nvalley. The quieter pools are frequently taken advantage of by a\nhard-pressed stag, for this particular piece of country is frequently\nhunted over by the Devon and Somerset staghounds, some of the most\npopular meets of the season being held at Cloutsham farm, on one of the\nslopes of the Horner valley. The neighbourhood of Dulverton includes\nsome fine bits of river scenery–the Barle, the Haddeo, and the Exe\nmeeting one another in the midst of lovely wooded hills. Many of the\nvillages on the margin of Exmoor are exceedingly pretty. The churches,\ntoo, are generally of great interest.",
