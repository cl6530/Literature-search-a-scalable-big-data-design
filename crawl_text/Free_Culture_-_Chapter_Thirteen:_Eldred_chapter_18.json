        "In 1995, a father was frustrated that his daughters didn’t seem to like \nHawthorne. No doubt there was more than one such father, but at least one did \nsomething about it. Eric Eldred, a retired computer programmer living in New \nHampshire, decided to put Hawthorne on the Web. An electronic version, Eldred \nthought, with links to pictures and explanatory text, would make this \nnineteenth-century author’s work come alive.",
        "It didn’t workat least for his daughters. They didn’t find Hawthorne any more \ninteresting than before. But Eldred’s experiment gave birth to a hobby, and his \nhobby begat a cause: Eldred would build a library of public domain works by \nscanning these works and making them available for free.",
        "Eldred’s library was not simply a copy of certain public domain works, though \neven a copy would have been of great value to people across the world who can’t \nget access to printed versions of these works. Instead, Eldred was producing \nderivative works from these public domain works. Just as Disney turned Grimm \ninto stories more accessible to the twentieth century, Eldred transformed \nHawthorne, and many others, into a form more accessibletechnically accessible\ntoday.",
        "Eldred’s freedom to do this with Hawthorne’s work grew from the same source as \nDisney’s. Hawthorne’s Scarlet Letter had passed into the public domain in \n1907. It was free for anyone to take without the permission of the Hawthorne \nestate or anyone else. Some, such as Dover Press and Penguin Classics, take \nworks from the public domain and produce printed editions, which they sell in \nbookstores across the country. Others, such as Disney, take these stories and \nturn them into animated cartoons, sometimes successfully (/Cinderella), \nsometimes not (/The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Treasure Planet). These are all \ncommercial publications of public domain works.",
        "The Internet created the possibility of noncommercial publications of public \ndomain works. Eldred’s is just one example. There are literally thousands of \nothers. Hundreds of thousands from across the world have discovered this \nplatform of expression and now use it to share works that are, by law, free for \nthe taking. This has produced what we might call the noncommercial publishing \nindustry, which before the Internet was limited to people with large egos or \nwith political or social causes. But with the Internet, it includes a wide range \nof individuals and groups dedicated to spreading culture generally. [1]",
        "As I said, Eldred lives in New Hampshire. In 1998, Robert Frost’s collection of \npoems New Hampshire was slated to pass into the public domain. Eldred wanted \nto post that collection in his free public library. But Congress got in the way. \nAs I described in chapter 10, in 1998, for the eleventh time in forty years, \nCongress extended the terms of existing copyrightsthis time by twenty years. \nEldred would not be free to add any works more recent than 1923 to his \ncollection until 2019. Indeed, no copyrighted work would pass into the public \ndomain until that year (and not even then, if Congress extends the term again). \nBy contrast, in the same period, more than 1 million patents will pass into the \npublic domain.",
        "This was the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), enacted in memory \nof the congressman and former musician Sonny Bono, who, his widow, Mary Bono, \nsays, believed that copy- rights should be forever. [2]",
        "Eldred decided to fight this law. He first resolved to fight it through civil \ndisobedience. In a series of interviews, Eldred announced that he would publish \nas planned, CTEA notwithstanding. But because of a second law passed in 1998, \nthe NET (No Electronic Theft) Act, his act of publishing would make Eldred a \nfelonwhether or not anyone complained. This was a dangerous strategy for a \ndisabled programmer to undertake.",
        "It was here that I became involved in Eldred’s battle. I was a constitutional \nscholar whose first passion was constitutional interpretation. And though \nconstitutional law courses never focus upon the Progress Clause of the \nConstitution, it had always struck me as importantly different. As you know, the \nConstitution says,",
        "Congress has the power to promote the Progress of Science ... by securing for \nlimited Times to Authors ... exclusive Right to their ... Writings. ...",
        "As I’ve described, this clause is unique within the power-granting clause of \nArticle I, section 8 of our Constitution. Every other clause granting power to \nCongress simply says Congress has the power to do somethingfor example, to \nregulate commerce among the several states” or declare War. But here, the \nsomething is something quite specificto promote ... Progressthrough means \nthat are also specific by securing exclusive Rights (i.e., copyrights) for \nlimited Times.",
        "In the past forty years, Congress has gotten into the practice of extending \nexisting terms of copyright protection. What puzzled me about this was, if \nCongress has the power to extend existing terms, then the Constitution’s \nrequirement that terms be limited will have no practical effect. If every time \na copyright is about to expire, Congress has the power to extend its term, then \nCongress can achieve what the Constitution plainly forbidsperpetual terms on \nthe installment plan, as Professor Peter Jaszi so nicely put it.",
        "As an academic, my first response was to hit the books. I remember sitting late \nat the office, scouring on-line databases for any serious consideration of the \nquestion. No one had ever challenged Congress’s practice of extending existing \nterms. That failure may in part be why Congress seemed so untroubled in its \nhabit. That, and the fact that the practice had become so lucrative for \nCongress. Congress knows that copyright owners will be willing to pay a great \ndeal of money to see their copyright terms extended. And so Congress is quite \nhappy to keep this gravy train going.",
        "For this is the core of the corruption in our present system of \ngovernment.Corruption not in the sense that representatives are bribed. \nRather, corruption in the sense that the system induces the beneficiaries of \nCongress’s acts to raise and give money to Congress to induce it to act. There’s \nonly so much time; there’s only so much Congress can do. Why not limit its \nactions to those things it must doand those things that pay? Extending \ncopyright terms pays.",
        "If that’s not obvious to you, consider the following: Say you’re one of the very \nfew lucky copyright owners whose copyright continues to make money one hundred \nyears after it was created. The Estate of Robert Frost is a good example. Frost \ndied in 1963. His poetry continues to be extraordinarily valuable. Thus the \nRobert Frost estate benefits greatly from any extension of copyright, since no \npublisher would pay the estate any money if the poems Frost wrote could be \npublished by anyone for free.",
        "So imagine the Robert Frost estate is earning $100,000 a year from three of \nFrost’s poems. And imagine the copyright for those poems is about to expire. You \nsit on the board of the Robert Frost estate. Your financial adviser comes to \nyour board meeting with a very grim report:",
        "Next year, the adviser announces, our copyrights in works A, B, and C will \nexpire. That means that after next year, we will no longer be receiving the \nannual royalty check of $100,000 from the publishers of those works.",
        "There’s a proposal in Congress, however, she continues, that could change \nthis. A few congressmen are floating a bill to extend the terms of copyright by \ntwenty years. That bill would be extraordinarily valuable to us. So we should \nhope this bill passes.",
        "Hope? a fellow board member says. Can’t we be doing something about it?",
        "Well, obviously, yes, the adviser responds. We could contribute to the \ncampaigns of a number of representatives to try to assure that they support the \nbill.",
        "You hate politics. You hate contributing to campaigns. So you want to know \nwhether this disgusting practice is worth it. How much would we get if this \nextension were passed? you ask the adviser. How much is it worth?",
        "Well, the adviser says, if you’re confident that you will continue to get at \nleast $100,000 a year from these copyrights, and you use the ’discount rate’ \nthat we use to evaluate estate investments (6 percent), then this law would be \nworth $1,146,000 to the estate.",
        "You’re a bit shocked by the number, but you quickly come to the correct \nconclusion:",
        "So you’re saying it would be worth it for us to pay more than $1,000,000 in \ncampaign contributions if we were confident those contributions would assure \nthat the bill was passed?",
        "Absolutely, the adviser responds. It is worth it to you to contribute up to \nthe ’present value’ of the income you expect from these copyrights. Which for us \nmeans over $1,000,000.",
        "You quickly get the pointyou as the member of the board and, I trust, you the \nreader. Each time copyrights are about to expire, every beneficiary in the \nposition of the Robert Frost estate faces the same choice: If they can \ncontribute to get a law passed to extend copyrights, they will benefit greatly \nfrom that extension. And so each time copyrights are about to expire, there is a \nmassive amount of lobbying to get the copyright term extended.",
        "Thus a congressional perpetual motion machine: So long as legislation can be \nbought (albeit indirectly), there will be all the incentive in the world to buy \nfurther extensions of copyright.",
        "In the lobbying that led to the passage of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term \nExtension Act, this theory about incentives was proved real. Ten of the \nthirteen original sponsors of the act in the House received the maximum \ncontribution from Disney’s political action committee; in the Senate, eight of \nthe twelve sponsors received contributions. [3] The RIAA and the MPAA are \nestimated to have spent over $1.5 million lobbying in the 1998 election cycle. \nThey paid out more than $200,000 in campaign contributions. [4] Disney is \nestimated to have contributed more than $800,000 to reelection campaigns in the \n1998 cycle. [5]",
        "Constitutional law is not oblivious to the obvious. Or at least, it need not be. \nSo when I was considering Eldred’s complaint, this reality about the never-\nending incentives to increase the copyright term was central to my thinking. In \nmy view, a pragmatic court committed to interpreting and applying the \nConstitution of our framers would see that if Congress has the power to extend \nexisting terms, then there would be no effective constitutional requirement that \nterms be limited. If they could extend it once, they would extend it again and \nagain and again.",
        "It was also my judgment that this Supreme Court would not allow Congress to \nextend existing terms. As anyone close to the Supreme Court’s work knows, this \nCourt has increasingly restricted the power of Congress when it has viewed \nCongress’s actions as exceeding the power granted to it by the Constitution. \nAmong constitutional scholars, the most famous example of this trend was the \nSupreme Court’s decision in 1995 to strike down a law that banned the possession \nof guns near schools.",
        "Since 1937, the Supreme Court had interpreted Congress’s granted powers very \nbroadly; so, while the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate only \ncommerce among the several states (aka interstate commerce”), the Supreme \nCourt had interpreted that power to include the power to regulate any activity \nthat merely affected interstate commerce.",
        "As the economy grew, this standard increasingly meant that there was no limit to \nCongress’s power to regulate, since just about every activity, when considered \non a national scale, affects interstate commerce. A Constitution designed to \nlimit Congress’s power was instead interpreted to impose no limit.",
        "The Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Rehnquist’s command, changed that in \n/United States v. Lopez. The government had argued that possessing guns near \nschools affected interstate commerce. Guns near schools increase crime, crime \nlowers property values, and so on. In the oral argument, the Chief Justice asked \nthe government whether there was any activity that would not affect interstate \ncommerce under the reasoning the government advanced. The government said there \nwas not; if Congress says an activity affects interstate commerce, then that \nactivity affects interstate commerce. The Supreme Court, the government said, \nwas not in the position to second-guess Congress.",
        "We pause to consider the implications of the government’s arguments, the Chief \nJustice wrote. [6] If anything Congress says is interstate commerce must \ntherefore be considered interstate commerce, then there would be no limit to \nCongress’s power. The decision in Lopez was reaffirmed five years later in \n/United States v. Morrison. [7]",
        "If a principle were at work here, then it should apply to the Progress Clause as \nmuch as the Commerce Clause. [8] And if it is applied to the Progress Clause, \nthe principle should yield the conclusion that Congress can’t extend an existing \nterm. If Congress could extend an existing term, then there would be no \nstopping point” to Congress’s power over terms, though the Constitution \nexpressly states that there is such a limit. Thus, the same principle applied to \nthe power to grant copyrights should entail that Congress is not allowed to \nextend the term of existing copyrights.",
        "If, that is, the principle announced in Lopez stood for a principle. Many \nbelieved the decision in Lopez stood for politicsa conservative Supreme \nCourt, which believed in states’ rights, using its power over Congress to \nadvance its own personal political preferences. But I rejected that view of the \nSupreme Court’s decision. Indeed, shortly after the decision, I wrote an article \ndemonstrating the fidelity in such an interpretation of the Constitution. The \nidea that the Supreme Court decides cases based upon its politics struck me as \nextraordinarily boring. I was not going to devote my life to teaching \nconstitutional law if these nine Justices were going to be petty politicians. ",
        "Now let’s pause for a moment to make sure we understand what the argument in \n/Eldred was not about. By insisting on the Constitution’s limits to copyright, \nobviously Eldred was not endorsing piracy. Indeed, in an obvious sense, he was \nfighting a kind of piracypiracy of the public domain. When Robert Frost wrote \nhis work and when Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse, the maximum copyright term \nwas just fifty-six years. Because of interim changes, Frost and Disney had \nalready enjoyed a seventy-five-year monopoly for their work. They had gotten the \nbenefit of the bargain that the Constitution envisions: In exchange for a \nmonopoly protected for fifty-six years, they created new work. But now these \nentities were using their powerexpressed through the power of lobbyists’ money\nto get another twenty-year dollop of monopoly. That twenty-year dollop would be \ntaken from the public domain. Eric Eldred was fighting a piracy that affects us \nall.",
        "Some people view the public domain with contempt. In their brief before the \nSupreme Court, the Nashville Songwriters Association wrote that the public \ndomain is nothing more than legal piracy. [9] But it is not piracy when the \nlaw allows it; and in our constitutional system, our law requires it. Some may \nnot like the Constitution’s requirements, but that doesn’t make the Constitution \na pirate’s charter.",
        "As we’ve seen, our constitutional system requires limits on copyright as a way \nto assure that copyright holders do not too heavily influence the development \nand distribution of our culture. Yet, as Eric Eldred discovered, we have set up \na system that assures that copyright terms will be repeatedly extended, and \nextended, and extended. We have created the perfect storm for the public domain. \nCopyrights have not expired, and will not expire, so long as Congress is free to \nbe bought to extend them again.",
        "It is valuable copyrights that are responsible for terms being extended. Mickey \nMouse and Rhapsody in Blue. These works are too valuable for copyright owners \nto ignore. But the real harm to our society from copyright extensions is not \nthat Mickey Mouse remains Disney’s. Forget Mickey Mouse. Forget Robert Frost. \nForget all the works from the 1920s and 1930s that have continuing commercial \nvalue. The real harm of term extension comes not from these famous works. The \nreal harm is to the works that are not famous, not commercially exploited, and \nno longer available as a result.",
        "If you look at the work created in the first twenty years (1923 to 1942) \naffected by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 2 percent of that work \nhas any continuing commercial value. It was the copyright holders for that 2 \npercent who pushed the CTEA through. But the law and its effect were not limited \nto that 2 percent. The law extended the terms of copyright generally. [10]",
        "Think practically about the consequence of this extensionpractically, as a \nbusinessperson, and not as a lawyer eager for more legal work. In 1930, 10,047 \nbooks were published. In 2000, 174 of those books were still in print. Let’s say \nyou were Brewster Kahle, and you wanted to make available to the world in your \niArchive project the remaining 9,873. What would you have to do?",
        "Well, first, you’d have to determine which of the 9,873 books were still under \ncopyright. That requires going to a library (these data are not on-line) and \npaging through tomes of books, cross-checking the titles and authors of the \n9,873 books with the copyright registration and renewal records for works \npublished in 1930. That will produce a list of books still under copyright.",
        "Then for the books still under copyright, you would need to locate the current \ncopyright owners. How would you do that?",
        "Most people think that there must be a list of these copyright owners somewhere. \nPractical people think this way. How could there be thousands and thousands of \ngovernment monopolies without there being at least a list?",
        "But there is no list. There may be a name from 1930, and then in 1959, of the \nperson who registered the copyright. But just think practically about how \nimpossibly difficult it would be to track down thousands of such records\nespecially since the person who registered is not necessarily the current owner. \nAnd we’re just talking about 1930!",
        "But there isn’t a list of who owns property generally, the apologists for the \nsystem respond. Why should there be a list of copyright owners?",
        "Well, actually, if you think about it, there are plenty of lists of who owns \nwhat property. Think about deeds on houses, or titles to cars. And where there \nisn’t a list, the code of real space is pretty good at suggesting who the owner \nof a bit of property is. (A swing set in your backyard is probably yours.) So \nformally or informally, we have a pretty good way to know who owns what tangible \nproperty.",
        "So: You walk down a street and see a house. You can know who owns the house by \nlooking it up in the courthouse registry. If you see a car, there is ordinarily \na license plate that will link the owner to the car. If you see a bunch of \nchildren’s toys sitting on the front lawn of a house, it’s fairly easy to \ndetermine who owns the toys. And if you happen to see a baseball lying in a \ngutter on the side of the road, look around for a second for some kids playing \nball. If you don’t see any kids, then okay: Here’s a bit of property whose owner \nwe can’t easily determine. It is the exception that proves the rule: that we \nordinarily know quite well who owns what property.",
        "Compare this story to intangible property. You go into a library. The library \nowns the books. But who owns the copyrights? As I’ve already described, there’s \nno list of copyright owners. There are authors’ names, of course, but their \ncopyrights could have been assigned, or passed down in an estate like Grandma’s \nold jewelry. To know who owns what, you would have to hire a private detective. \nThe bottom line: The owner cannot easily be located. And in a regime like ours, \nin which it is a felony to use such property without the property owner’s \npermission, the property isn’t going to be used.",
        "The consequence with respect to old books is that they won’t be digitized, and \nhence will simply rot away on shelves. But the consequence for other creative \nworks is much more dire.",
        "Consider the story of Michael Agee, chairman of Hal Roach Studios, which owns \nthe copyrights for the Laurel and Hardy films. Agee is a direct beneficiary of \nthe Bono Act. The Laurel and Hardy films were made between 1921 and 1951. Only \none of these films, The Lucky Dog, is currently out of copyright. But for the \nCTEA, films made after 1923 would have begun entering the public domain. Because \nAgee controls the exclusive rights for these popular films, he makes a great \ndeal of money. According to one estimate, Roach has sold about 60,000 \nvideocassettes and 50,000 DVDs of the duo’s silent films. [11]",
        "Yet Agee opposed the CTEA. His reasons demonstrate a rare virtue in this \nculture: selflessness. He argued in a brief before the Supreme Court that the \nSonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act will, if left standing, destroy a whole \ngeneration of American film.",
        "His argument is straightforward. A tiny fraction of this work has any continuing \ncommercial value. The restto the extent it survives at allsits in vaults \ngathering dust. It may be that some of this work not now commercially valuable \nwill be deemed to be valuable by the owners of the vaults. For this to occur, \nhowever, the commercial benefit from the work must exceed the costs of making \nthe work available for distribution.",
        "We can’t know the benefits, but we do know a lot about the costs. For most of \nthe history of film, the costs of restoring film were very high; digital \ntechnology has lowered these costs substantially. While it cost more than \n$10,000 to restore a ninety-minute black-and-white film in 1993, it can now cost \nas little as $100 to digitize one hour of 8 mm film. [12]",
        "Restoration technology is not the only cost, nor the most important. Lawyers, \ntoo, are a cost, and increasingly, a very important one. In addition to \npreserving the film, a distributor needs to secure the rights. And to secure the \nrights for a film that is under copyright, you need to locate the copyright \nowner.",
        "Or more accurately, owners. As we’ve seen, there isn’t only a single copyright \nassociated with a film; there are many. There isn’t a single person whom you can \ncontact about those copyrights; there are as many as can hold the rights, which \nturns out to be an extremely large number. Thus the costs of clearing the rights \nto these films is exceptionally high.",
        "But can’t you just restore the film, distribute it, and then pay the copyright \nowner when she shows up? Sure, if you want to commit a felony. And even if \nyou’re not worried about committing a felony, when she does show up, she’ll have \nthe right to sue you for all the profits you have made. So, if you’re \nsuccessful, you can be fairly confident you’ll be getting a call from someone’s \nlawyer. And if you’re not successful, you won’t make enough to cover the costs \nof your own lawyer. Either way, you have to talk to a lawyer. And as is too \noften the case, saying you have to talk to a lawyer is the same as saying you \nwon’t make any money.",
        "For some films, the benefit of releasing the film may well exceed these costs. \nBut for the vast majority of them, there is no way the benefit would outweigh \nthe legal costs. Thus, for the vast majority of old films, Agee argued, the film \nwill not be restored and distributed until the copyright expires.",
        "But by the time the copyright for these films expires, the film will have \nexpired. These films were produced on nitrate-based stock, and nitrate stock \ndissolves over time. They will be gone, and the metal canisters in which they \nare now stored will be filled with nothing more than dust.",
        "Of all the creative work produced by humans anywhere, a tiny fraction has \ncontinuing commercial value. For that tiny fraction, the copyright is a \ncrucially important legal device. For that tiny fraction, the copyright creates \nincentives to produce and distribute the creative work. For that tiny fraction, \nthe copyright acts as an engine of free expression.",
        "But even for that tiny fraction, the actual time during which the creative work \nhas a commercial life is extremely short. As I’ve indicated, most books go out \nof print within one year. The same is true of music and film. Commercial culture \nis sharklike. It must keep moving. And when a creative work falls out of favor \nwith the commercial distributors, the commercial life ends.",
        "Yet that doesn’t mean the life of the creative work ends. We don’t keep \nlibraries of books in order to compete with Barnes & Noble, and we don’t have \narchives of films because we expect people to choose between spending Friday \nnight watching new movies and spending Friday night watching a 1930 news \ndocumentary. The noncommercial life of culture is important and valuablefor \nentertainment but also, and more importantly, for knowledge. To understand who \nwe are, and where we came from, and how we have made the mistakes that we have, \nwe need to have access to this history.",
        "Copyrights in this context do not drive an engine of free expression. In this \ncontext, there is no need for an exclusive right. Copyrights in this context do \nno good.",
        "Yet, for most of our history, they also did little harm. For most of our \nhistory, when a work ended its commercial life, there was no copyright-related \nuse that would be inhibited by an exclusive right. When a book went out of \nprint, you could not buy it from a publisher. But you could still buy it from a \nused book store, and when a used book store sells it, in America, at least, \nthere is no need to pay the copyright owner anything. Thus, the ordinary use of \na book after its commercial life ended was a use that was independent of \ncopyright law.",
        "The same was effectively true of film. Because the costs of restoring a filmthe \nreal economic costs, not the lawyer costswere so high, it was never at all \nfeasible to preserve or restore film. Like the remains of a great dinner, when \nit’s over, it’s over. Once a film passed out of its commercial life, it may have \nbeen archived for a bit, but that was the end of its life so long as the market \ndidn’t have more to offer.",
        "In other words, though copyright has been relatively short for most of our \nhistory, long copyrights wouldn’t have mattered for the works that lost their \ncommercial value. Long copyrights for these works would not have interfered with \nanything.",
        "But this situation has now changed.",
        "One crucially important consequence of the emergence of digital technologies is \nto enable the archive that Brewster Kahle dreams of. Digital technologies now \nmake it possible to preserve and give access to all sorts of knowledge. Once a \nbook goes out of print, we can now imagine digitizing it and making it available \nto everyone, forever. Once a film goes out of distribution, we could digitize it \nand make it available to everyone, forever. Digital technologies give new life \nto copyrighted material after it passes out of its commercial life. It is now \npossible to preserve and assure universal access to this knowledge and culture, \nwhereas before it was not.",
        "And now copyright law does get in the way. Every step of producing this digital \narchive of our culture infringes on the exclusive right of copyright. To \ndigitize a book is to copy it. To do that requires permission of the copyright \nowner. The same with music, film, or any other aspect of our culture protected \nby copyright. The effort to make these things available to history, or to \nresearchers, or to those who just want to explore, is now inhibited by a set of \nrules that were written for a radically different context.",
        "Here is the core of the harm that comes from extending terms: Now that \ntechnology enables us to rebuild the library of Alexandria, the law gets in the \nway. And it doesn’t get in the way for any useful copyright purpose, for the \npurpose of copyright is to enable the commercial market that spreads culture. \nNo, we are talking about culture after it has lived its commercial life. In this \ncontext, copyright is serving no purpose at all related to the spread of \nknowledge. In this context, copyright is not an engine of free expression. \nCopyright is a brake.",
        "You may well ask, But if digital technologies lower the costs for Brewster \nKahle, then they will lower the costs for Random House, too. So won’t Random \nHouse do as well as Brewster Kahle in spreading culture widely?",
        "Maybe. Someday. But there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that publishers \nwould be as complete as libraries. If Barnes & Noble offered to lend books from \nits stores for a low price, would that eliminate the need for libraries? Only if \nyou think that the only role of a library is to serve what the market would \ndemand. But if you think the role of a library is bigger than thisif you think \nits role is to archive culture, whether there’s a demand for any particular bit \nof that culture or notthen we can’t count on the commercial market to do our \nlibrary work for us.",
        "I would be the first to agree that it should do as much as it can: We should \nrely upon the market as much as possible to spread and enable culture. My \nmessage is absolutely not antimarket. But where we see the market is not doing \nthe job, then we should allow nonmarket forces the freedom to fill the gaps. As \none researcher calculated for American culture, 94 percent of the films, books, \nand music produced between 1923 and 1946 is not commercially available. However \nmuch you love the commercial market, if access is a value, then 6 percent is a \nfailure to provide that value. [13]",
        "In January 1999, we filed a lawsuit on Eric Eldred’s behalf in federal district \ncourt in Washington, D.C., asking the court to declare the Sonny Bono Copyright \nTerm Extension Act unconstitutional. The two central claims that we made were \n(1) that extending existing terms violated the Constitution’s limited Times \nrequirement, and (2) that extending terms by another twenty years violated the \nFirst Amendment.",
        "The district court dismissed our claims without even hearing an argument. A \npanel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit also dismissed our claims, \nthough after hearing an extensive argument. But that decision at least had a \ndissent, by one of the most conservative judges on that court. That dissent gave \nour claims life.",
        "Judge David Sentelle said the CTEA violated the requirement that copyrights be \nfor limited Times only. His argument was as elegant as it was simple: If \nCongress can extend existing terms, then there is no stopping point to \nCongress’s power under the Copyright Clause. The power to extend existing terms \nmeans Congress is not required to grant terms that are limited. Thus, Judge \nSentelle argued, the court had to interpret the term limited Times to give it \nmeaning. And the best interpretation, Judge Sentelle argued, would be to deny \nCongress the power to extend existing terms.",
        "We asked the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit as a whole to hear the case. \nCases are ordinarily heard in panels of three, except for important cases or \ncases that raise issues specific to the circuit as a whole, where the court will \nsit en banc to hear the case.",
        "The Court of Appeals rejected our request to hear the case en banc. This time, \nJudge Sentelle was joined by the most liberal member of the D.C. Circuit, Judge \nDavid Tatel. Both the most conservative and the most liberal judges in the D.C. \nCircuit believed Congress had over-stepped its bounds.",
        "It was here that most expected Eldred v. Ashcroft would die, for the Supreme \nCourt rarely reviews any decision by a court of appeals. (It hears about one \nhundred cases a year, out of more than five thousand appeals.) And it \npractically never reviews a decision that upholds a statute when no other court \nhas yet reviewed the statute.",
        "But in February 2002, the Supreme Court surprised the world by granting our \npetition to review the D.C. Circuit opinion. Argument was set for October of \n2002. The summer would be spent writing briefs and preparing for argument.",
        "It is over a year later as I write these words. It is still astonishingly hard. \nIf you know anything at all about this story, you know that we lost the appeal. \nAnd if you know something more than just the minimum, you probably think there \nwas no way this case could have been won. After our defeat, I received literally \nthousands of missives by well-wishers and supporters, thanking me for my work on \nbehalf of this noble but doomed cause. And none from this pile was more \nsignificant to me than the e-mail from my client, Eric Eldred.",
        "But my client and these friends were wrong. This case could have been won. It \nshould have been won. And no matter how hard I try to retell this story to \nmyself, I can never escape believing that my own mistake lost it.",
        "The mistake was made early, though it became obvious only at the very end. Our \ncase had been supported from the very beginning by an extraordinary lawyer, \nGeoffrey Stewart, and by the law firm he had moved to, Jones, Day, Reavis and \nPogue. Jones Day took a great deal of heat from its copyright-protectionist \nclients for supporting us. They ignored this pressure (something that few law \nfirms today would ever do), and throughout the case, they gave it everything \nthey could.",
        "There were three key lawyers on the case from Jones Day. Geoff Stewart was the \nfirst, but then Dan Bromberg and Don Ayer became quite involved. Bromberg and \nAyer in particular had a common view about how this case would be won: We would \nonly win, they repeatedly told me, if we could make the issue seem important \nto the Supreme Court. It had to seem as if dramatic harm were being done to free \nspeech and free culture; otherwise, they would never vote against the most \npowerful media companies in the world.",
        "I hate this view of the law. Of course I thought the Sonny Bono Act was a \ndramatic harm to free speech and free culture. Of course I still think it is. \nBut the idea that the Supreme Court decides the law based on how important they \nbelieve the issues are is just wrong. It might be right as in true, I \nthought, but it is wrong as in it just shouldn’t be that way. As I believed \nthat any faithful interpretation of what the framers of our Constitution did \nwould yield the conclusion that the CTEA was unconstitutional, and as I believed \nthat any faithful interpretation of what the First Amendment means would yield \nthe conclusion that the power to extend existing copyright terms is \nunconstitutional, I was not persuaded that we had to sell our case like soap. \nJust as a law that bans the swastika is unconstitutional not because the Court \nlikes Nazis but because such a law would violate the Constitution, so too, in my \nview, would the Court decide whether Congress’s law was constitutional based on \nthe Constitution, not based on whether they liked the values that the framers \nput in the Constitution.",
        "In any case, I thought, the Court must already see the danger and the harm \ncaused by this sort of law. Why else would they grant review? There was no \nreason to hear the case in the Supreme Court if they weren’t convinced that this \nregulation was harmful. So in my view, we didn’t need to persuade them that this \nlaw was bad, we needed to show why it was unconstitutional.",
        "There was one way, however, in which I felt politics would matter and in which I \nthought a response was appropriate. I was convinced that the Court would not \nhear our arguments if it thought these were just the arguments of a group of \nlefty loons. This Supreme Court was not about to launch into a new field of \njudicial review if it seemed that this field of review was simply the preference \nof a small political minority. Although my focus in the case was not to \ndemonstrate how bad the Sonny Bono Act was but to demonstrate that it was \nunconstitutional, my hope was to make this argument against a background of \nbriefs that covered the full range of political views. To show that this claim \nagainst the CTEA was grounded in law and not politics, then, we tried to \ngather the widest range of credible criticscredible not because they were rich \nand famous, but because they, in the aggregate, demonstrated that this law was \nunconstitutional regardless of one’s politics.",
        "The first step happened all by itself. Phyllis Schlafly’s organization, Eagle \nForum, had been an opponent of the CTEA from the very beginning. Mrs. Schlafly \nviewed the CTEA as a sellout by Congress. In November 1998, she wrote a stinging \neditorial attacking the Republican Congress for allowing the law to pass. As she \nwrote, Do you sometimes wonder why bills that create a financial windfall to \nnarrow special interests slide easily through the intricate legislative process, \nwhile bills that benefit the general public seem to get bogged down? The \nanswer, as the editorial documented, was the power of money. Schlafly enumerated \nDisney’s contributions to the key players on the committees. It was money, not \njustice, that gave Mickey Mouse twenty more years in Disney’s control, Schlafly \nargued.",
        "In the Court of Appeals, Eagle Forum was eager to file a brief supporting our \nposition. Their brief made the argument that became the core claim in the \nSupreme Court: If Congress can extend the term of existing copyrights, there is \nno limit to Congress’s power to set terms. That strong conservative argument \npersuaded a strong conservative judge, Judge Sentelle.",
        "In the Supreme Court, the briefs on our side were about as diverse as it gets. \nThey included an extraordinary historical brief by the Free Software Foundation \n(home of the GNU project that made GNU Linux possible). They included a \npowerful brief about the costs of uncertainty by Intel. There were two law \nprofessors’ briefs, one by copyright scholars and one by First Amendment \nscholars. There was an exhaustive and uncontroverted brief by the world’s \nexperts in the history of the Progress Clause. And of course, there was a new \nbrief by Eagle Forum, repeating and strengthening its arguments.",
        "Those briefs framed a legal argument. Then to support the legal argument, there \nwere a number of powerful briefs by libraries and archives, including the \nInternet Archive, the American Association of Law Libraries, and the National \nWriters Union.",
        "But two briefs captured the policy argument best. One made the argument I’ve \nalready described: A brief by Hal Roach Studios argued that unless the law was \nstruck, a whole generation of American film would disappear. The other made the \neconomic argument absolutely clear.",
        "This economists’ brief was signed by seventeen economists, including five Nobel \nPrize winners, including Ronald Coase, James Buchanan, Milton Friedman, Kenneth \nArrow, and George Akerlof. The economists, as the list of Nobel winners \ndemonstrates, spanned the political spectrum. Their conclusions were powerful: \nThere was no plausible claim that extending the terms of existing copyrights \nwould do anything to increase incentives to create. Such extensions were nothing \nmore than rent-seekingthe fancy term economists use to describe special-\ninterest legislation gone wild.",
        "The same effort at balance was reflected in the legal team we gathered to write \nour briefs in the case. The Jones Day lawyers had been with us from the start. \nBut when the case got to the Supreme Court, we added three lawyers to help us \nframe this argument to this Court: Alan Morrison, a lawyer from Public Citizen, \na Washington group that had made constitutional history with a series of seminal \nvictories in the Supreme Court defending individual rights; my colleague and \ndean, Kathleen Sullivan, who had argued many cases in the Court, and who had \nadvised us early on about a First Amendment strategy; and finally, former \nsolicitor general Charles Fried.",
        "Fried was a special victory for our side. Every other former solicitor general \nwas hired by the other side to defend Congress’s power to give media companies \nthe special favor of extended copyright terms. Fried was the only one who turned \ndown that lucrative assignment to stand up for something he believed in. He had \nbeen Ronald Reagan’s chief lawyer in the Supreme Court. He had helped craft the \nline of cases that limited Congress’s power in the context of the Commerce \nClause. And while he had argued many positions in the Supreme Court that I \npersonally disagreed with, his joining the cause was a vote of confidence in our \nargument.",
        "The government, in defending the statute, had its collection of friends, as \nwell. Significantly, however, none of these friends” included historians or \neconomists. The briefs on the other side of the case were written exclusively by \nmajor media companies, congressmen, and copyright holders.",
        "The media companies were not surprising. They had the most to gain from the law. \nThe congressmen were not surprising eitherthey were defending their power and, \nindirectly, the gravy train of contributions such power induced. And of course \nit was not surprising that the copyright holders would defend the idea that they \nshould continue to have the right to control who did what with content they \nwanted to control.",
        "Dr.Seuss’s representatives, for example, argued that it was better for the Dr. \nSeuss estate to control what happened to Dr. Seuss’s workbetter than allowing \nit to fall into the public domainbecause if this creativity were in the public \ndomain, then people could use it to glorify drugs or to create pornography. \n[14] That was also the motive of the Gershwin estate, which defended its \nprotection of the work of George Gershwin. They refuse, for example, to \nlicense Porgy and Bess to anyone who refuses to use African Americans in the \ncast. [15] That’s their view of how this part of American culture should be \ncontrolled, and they wanted this law to help them effect that control.",
        "This argument made clear a theme that is rarely noticed in this debate. When \nCongress decides to extend the term of existing copyrights, Congress is making a \nchoice about which speakers it will favor. Famous and beloved copyright owners, \nsuch as the Gershwin estate and Dr. Seuss, come to Congress and say, Give us \ntwenty years to control the speech about these icons of American culture. We’ll \ndo better with them than anyone else. Congress of course likes to reward the \npopular and famous by giving them what they want. But when Congress gives people \nan exclusive right to speak in a certain way, that’s just what the First \nAmendment is traditionally meant to block.",
        "We argued as much in a final brief. Not only would upholding the CTEA mean that \nthere was no limit to the power of Congress to extend copyrightsextensions that \nwould further concentrate the market; it would also mean that there was no limit \nto Congress’s power to play favorites, through copyright, with who has the right \nto speak.",
        "Between February and October, there was little I did beyond preparing for this \ncase. Early on, as I said, I set the strategy.",
        "The Supreme Court was divided into two important camps. One camp we called the \nConservatives. The other we called the Rest. The Conservatives included Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, Justice O’Connor, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and \nJustice Thomas. These five had been the most consistent in limiting Congress’s \npower. They were the five who had supported the Lopez/Morrison line of cases \nthat said that an enumerated power had to be interpreted to assure that \nCongress’s powers had limits.",
        "The Rest were the four Justices who had strongly opposed limits on Congress’s \npower. These fourJustice Stevens, Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice \nBreyerhad repeatedly argued that the Constitution gives Congress broad \ndiscretion to decide how best to implement its powers. In case after case, these \njustices had argued that the Court’s role should be one of deference. Though the \nvotes of these four justices were the votes that I personally had most \nconsistently agreed with, they were also the votes that we were least likely to \nget.",
        "In particular, the least likely was Justice Ginsburg’s. In addition to her \ngeneral view about deference to Congress (except where issues of gender are \ninvolved), she had been particularly deferential in the context of intellectual \nproperty protections. She and her daughter (an excellent and well-known \nintellectual property scholar) were cut from the same intellectual property \ncloth. We expected she would agree with the writings of her daughter: that \nCongress had the power in this context to do as it wished, even if what Congress \nwished made little sense.",
        "Close behind Justice Ginsburg were two justices whom we also viewed as unlikely \nallies, though possible surprises. Justice Souter strongly favored deference to \nCongress, as did Justice Breyer. But both were also very sensitive to free \nspeech concerns. And as we strongly believed, there was a very important free \nspeech argument against these retrospective extensions.",
        "The only vote we could be confident about was that of Justice Stevens. History \nwill record Justice Stevens as one of the greatest judges on this Court. His \nvotes are consistently eclectic, which just means that no simple ideology \nexplains where he will stand. But he had consistently argued for limits in the \ncontext of intellectual property generally. We were fairly confident he would \nrecognize limits here.",
        "This analysis of the Rest showed most clearly where our focus had to be: on \nthe Conservatives. To win this case, we had to crack open these five and get at \nleast a majority to go our way.Thus, the single overriding argument that \nanimated our claim rested on the Conservatives’ most important jurisprudential \ninnovationthe argument that Judge Sentelle had relied upon in the Court of \nAppeals, that Congress’s power must be interpreted so that its enumerated powers \nhave limits.",
        "This then was the core of our strategya strategy for which I am responsible. We \nwould get the Court to see that just as with the Lopez case, under the \ngovernment’s argument here, Congress would always have unlimited power to extend \nexisting terms. If anything was plain about Congress’s power under the Progress \nClause, it was that this power was supposed to be limited. Our aim would be to \nget the Court to reconcile Eldred with Lopez: If Congress’s power to \nregulate commerce was limited, then so, too, must Congress’s power to regulate \ncopyright be limited.",
        "The argument on the government’s side came down to this: Congress has done it \nbefore. It should be allowed to do it again. The government claimed that from \nthe very beginning, Congress has been extending the term of existing copyrights. \nSo, the government argued, the Court should not now say that practice is \nunconstitutional.",
        "There was some truth to the government’s claim, but not much. We certainly \nagreed that Congress had extended existing terms in 1831 and in 1909. And of \ncourse, in 1962, Congress began extending existing terms regularlyeleven times \nin forty years.",
        "But this consistency should be kept in perspective. Congress extended existing \nterms once in the first hundred years of the Republic. It then extended existing \nterms once again in the next fifty. Those rare extensions are in contrast to the \nnow regular practice of extending existing terms. Whatever restraint Congress \nhad had in the past, that restraint was now gone. Congress was now in a cycle of \nextensions; there was no reason to expect that cycle would end. This Court had \nnot hesitated to intervene where Congress was in a similar cycle of extension. \nThere was no reason it couldn’t intervene here.",
        "Oral argument was scheduled for the first week in October. I arrived in D.C. two \nweeks before the argument. During those two weeks, I was repeatedly mooted by \nlawyers who had volunteered to help in the case. Such moots are basically \npractice rounds, where wannabe justices fire questions at wannabe winners.",
        "I was convinced that to win, I had to keep the Court focused on a single point: \nthat if this extension is permitted, then there is no limit to the power to set \nterms. Going with the government would mean that terms would be effectively \nunlimited; going with us would give Congress a clear line to follow: Don’t \nextend existing terms. The moots were an effective practice; I found ways to \ntake every question back to this central idea.",
        "One moot was before the lawyers at Jones Day. Don Ayer was the skeptic. He had \nserved in the Reagan Justice Department with Solicitor General Charles Fried. He \nhad argued many cases before the Supreme Court. And in his review of the moot, \nhe let his concern speak:",
        "I’m just afraid that unless they really see the harm, they won’t be willing to \nupset this practice that the government says has been a consistent practice for \ntwo hundred years. You have to make them see the harmpassionately get them to \nsee the harm. For if they don’t see that, then we haven’t any chance of \nwinning.",
        "He may have argued many cases before this Court, I thought, but he didn’t \nunderstand its soul. As a clerk, I had seen the Justices do the right thingnot \nbecause of politics but because it was right. As a law professor, I had spent my \nlife teaching my students that this Court does the right thingnot because of \npolitics but because it is right. As I listened to Ayer’s plea for passion in \npressing politics, I understood his point, and I rejected it. Our argument was \nright. That was enough. Let the politicians learn to see that it was also good.",
        "The night before the argument, a line of people began to form in front of the \nSupreme Court. The case had become a focus of the press and of the movement to \nfree culture. Hundreds stood in line for the chance to see the proceedings. \nScores spent the night on the Supreme Court steps so that they would be assured \na seat.",
        "Not everyone has to wait in line. People who know the Justices can ask for seats \nthey control. (I asked Justice Scalia’s chambers for seats for my parents, for \nexample.) Members of the Supreme Court bar can get a seat in a special section \nreserved for them. And senators and congressmen have a special place where they \nget to sit, too. And finally, of course, the press has a gallery, as do clerks \nworking for the Justices on the Court. As we entered that morning, there was no \nplace that was not taken. This was an argument about intellectual property law, \nyet the halls were filled. As I walked in to take my seat at the front of the \nCourt, I saw my parents sitting on the left. As I sat down at the table, I saw \nJack Valenti sitting in the special section ordinarily reserved for family of \nthe Justices.",
        "When the Chief Justice called me to begin my argument, I began where I intended \nto stay: on the question of the limits on Congress’s power. This was a case \nabout enumerated powers, I said, and whether those enumerated powers had any \nlimit.",
        "Justice O’Connor stopped me within one minute of my opening. The history was \nbothering her.",
        "JUSTICE O’CONNOR: Congress has extended the term so often through the years, \nand if you are right, don’t we run the risk of upsetting previous extensions of \ntime? I mean, this seems to be a practice that began with the very first act.",
        "She was quite willing to concede that this flies directly in the face of what \nthe framers had in mind. But my response again and again was to emphasize \nlimits on Congress’s power.",
        "MR. LESSIG: Well, if it flies in the face of what the framers had in mind, then \nthe question is, is there a way of interpreting their words that gives effect to \nwhat they had in mind, and the answer is yes.",
        "There were two points in this argument when I should have seen where the Court \nwas going. The first was a question by Justice Kennedy, who observed,",
        "JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose implicit in the argument that the 76 act, \ntoo, should have been declared void, and that we might leave it alone because of \nthe disruption, is that for all these years the act has impeded progress in \nscience and the useful arts. I just don’t see any empirical evidence for that.",
        "Here follows my clear mistake. Like a professor correcting a student, I \nanswered,",
        "MR. LESSIG: Justice, we are not making an empirical claim at all. Nothing in \nour Copyright Clause claim hangs upon the empirical assertion about impeding \nprogress. Our only argument is this is a structural limit necessary to assure \nthat what would be an effectively perpetual term not be permitted under the \ncopyright laws.",
        "That was a correct answer, but it wasn’t the right answer. The right answer was \ninstead that there was an obvious and profound harm. Any number of briefs had \nbeen written about it. He wanted to hear it. And here was the place Don Ayer’s \nadvice should have mattered. This was a softball; my answer was a swing and a \nmiss.",
        "The second came from the Chief, for whom the whole case had been crafted. For \nthe Chief Justice had crafted the Lopez ruling, and we hoped that he would see \nthis case as its second cousin.",
        "It was clear a second into his question that he wasn’t at all sympathetic. To \nhim, we were a bunch of anarchists. As he asked:",
        "CHIEF JUSTICE: Well, but you want more than that. You want the right to copy \nverbatim other people’s books, don’t you?",
        "MR. LESSIG: We want the right to copy verbatim works that should be in the \npublic domain and would be in the public domain but for a statute that cannot be \njustified under ordinary First Amendment analysis or under a proper reading of \nthe limits built into the Copyright Clause.",
        "Things went better for us when the government gave its argument; for now the \nCourt picked up on the core of our claim. As Justice Scalia asked Solicitor \nGeneral Olson,",
        "JUSTICE SCALIA: You say that the functional equivalent of an unlimited time \nwould be a violation [of the Constitution], but that’s precisely the argument \nthat’s being made by petitioners here, that a limited time which is extendable \nis the functional equivalent of an unlimited time.",
        "When Olson was finished, it was my turn to give a closing rebuttal. Olson’s \nflailing had revived my anger. But my anger still was directed to the academic, \nnot the practical. The government was arguing as if this were the first case \never to consider limits on Congress’s Copyright and Patent Clause power. Ever \nthe professor and not the advocate, I closed by pointing out the long history of \nthe Court imposing limits on Congress’s power in the name of the Copyright and \nPatent Clauseindeed, the very first case striking a law of Congress as \nexceeding a specific enumerated power was based upon the Copyright and Patent \nClause. All true. But it wasn’t going to move the Court to my side.",
        "As I left the court that day, I knew there were a hundred points I wished I \ncould remake. There were a hundred questions I wished I had answered \ndifferently. But one way of thinking about this case left me optimistic.",
        "The government had been asked over and over again, what is the limit? Over and \nover again, it had answered there is no limit. This was precisely the answer I \nwanted the Court to hear. For I could not imagine how the Court could understand \nthat the government believed Congress’s power was unlimited under the terms of \nthe Copyright Clause, and sustain the government’s argument. The solicitor \ngeneral had made my argument for me. No matter how often I tried, I could not \nunderstand how the Court could find that Congress’s power under the Commerce \nClause was limited, but under the Copyright Clause, unlimited. In those rare \nmoments when I let myself believe that we may have prevailed, it was because I \nfelt this Courtin particular, the Conservativeswould feel itself constrained \nby the rule of law that it had established elsewhere.",
        "The morning of January 15, 2003, I was five minutes late to the office and \nmissed the 7:00 A.M.call from the Supreme Court clerk. Listening to the message, \nI could tell in an instant that she had bad news to report.The Supreme Court had \naffirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. Seven justices had voted in the \nmajority. There were two dissents.",
        "A few seconds later, the opinions arrived by e-mail. I took the phone off the \nhook, posted an announcement to our blog, and sat down to see where I had been \nwrong in my reasoning.",
        "My reasoning. Here was a case that pitted all the money in the world against \n/reasoning. And here was the last naïve law professor, scouring the pages, \nlooking for reasoning.",
        "I first scoured the opinion, looking for how the Court would distinguish the \nprinciple in this case from the principle in Lopez. The argument was nowhere \nto be found. The case was not even cited. The argument that was the core \nargument of our case did not even appear in the Court’s opinion.",
        "Justice Ginsburg simply ignored the enumerated powers argument. Consistent with \nher view that Congress’s power was not limited generally, she had found \nCongress’s power not limited here.",
        "Her opinion was perfectly reasonablefor her, and for Justice Souter. Neither \nbelieves in Lopez. It would be too much to expect them to write an opinion \nthat recognized, much less explained, the doctrine they had worked so hard to \ndefeat.",
        "But as I realized what had happened, I couldn’t quite believe what I was \nreading. I had said there was no way this Court could reconcile limited powers \nwith the Commerce Clause and unlimited powers with the Progress Clause. It had \nnever even occurred to me that they could reconcile the two simply by not \naddressing the argument. There was no inconsistency because they would not talk \nabout the two together. There was therefore no principle that followed from the \nLopez case: In that context, Congress’s power would be limited, but in this \ncontext it would not.",
        "Yet by what right did they get to choose which of the framers’ values they would \nrespect? By what right did theythe silent fiveget to select the part of the \nConstitution they would enforce based on the values they thought important? We \nwere right back to the argument that I said I hated at the start: I had failed \nto convince them that the issue here was important, and I had failed to \nrecognize that however much I might hate a system in which the Court gets to \npick the constitutional values that it will respect, that is the system we have.",
        "Justices Breyer and Stevens wrote very strong dissents. Stevens’s opinion was \ncrafted internal to the law: He argued that the tradition of intellectual \nproperty law should not support this unjustified extension of terms. He based \nhis argument on a parallel analysis that had governed in the context of patents \n(so had we). But the rest of the Court discounted the parallelwithout \nexplaining how the very same words in the Progress Clause could come to mean \ntotally different things depending upon whether the words were about patents or \ncopyrights. The Court let Justice Stevens’s charge go unanswered.",
        "Justice Breyer’s opinion, perhaps the best opinion he has ever written, was \nexternal to the Constitution. He argued that the term of copyrights has become \nso long as to be effectively unlimited. We had said that under the current term, \na copyright gave an author 99.8 percent of the value of a perpetual term. Breyer \nsaid we were wrong, that the actual number was 99.9997 percent of a perpetual \nterm. Either way, the point was clear: If the Constitution said a term had to be \nlimited, and the existing term was so long as to be effectively unlimited, \nthen it was unconstitutional.",
        "These two justices understood all the arguments we had made. But because neither \nbelieved in the Lopez case, neither was willing to push it as a reason to \nreject this extension. The case was decided without anyone having addressed the \nargument that we had carried from Judge Sentelle. It was Hamlet without the \nPrince.",
        "Defeat brings depression. They say it is a sign of health when depression gives \nway to anger. My anger came quickly, but it didn’t cure the depression. This \nanger was of two sorts.",
        "It was first anger with the five Conservatives. It would have been one thing \nfor them to have explained why the principle of Lopez didn’t apply in this \ncase. That wouldn’t have been a very convincing argument, I don’t believe, \nhaving read it made by others, and having tried to make it myself. But it at \nleast would have been an act of integrity. These justices in particular have \nrepeatedly said that the proper mode of interpreting the Constitution is \noriginalismto first understand the framers’ text, interpreted in their \ncontext, in light of the structure of the Constitution. That method had produced \nLopez and many other originalist rulings. Where was their originalism” now?",
        "Here, they had joined an opinion that never once tried to explain what the \nframers had meant by crafting the Progress Clause as they did; they joined an \nopinion that never once tried to explain how the structure of that clause would \naffect the interpretation of Congress’s power. And they joined an opinion that \ndidn’t even try to explain why this grant of power could be unlimited, whereas \nthe Commerce Clause would be limited. In short, they had joined an opinion that \ndid not apply to, and was inconsistent with, their own method for interpreting \nthe Constitution. This opinion may well have yielded a result that they liked. \nIt did not produce a reason that was consistent with their own principles.",
        "My anger with the Conservatives quickly yielded to anger with myself. For I had \nlet a view of the law that I liked interfere with a view of the law as it is.",
        "Most lawyers, and most law professors, have little patience for idealism about \ncourts in general and this Supreme Court in particular. Most have a much more \npragmatic view. When Don Ayer said that this case would be won based on whether \nI could convince the Justices that the framers’ values were important, I fought \nthe idea, because I didn’t want to believe that that is how this Court decides. \nI insisted on arguing this case as if it were a simple application of a set of \nprinciples. I had an argument that followed in logic. I didn’t need to waste my \ntime showing it should also follow in popularity.",
        "As I read back over the transcript from that argument in October, I can see a \nhundred places where the answers could have taken the conversation in different \ndirections, where the truth about the harm that this unchecked power will cause \ncould have been made clear to this Court. Justice Kennedy in good faith wanted \nto be shown. I, idiotically, corrected his question. Justice Souter in good \nfaith wanted to be shown the First Amendment harms. I, like a math teacher, \nreframed the question to make the logical point. I had shown them how they could \nstrike this law of Congress if they wanted to. There were a hundred places where \nI could have helped them want to, yet my stubbornness, my refusal to give in, \nstopped me. I have stood before hundreds of audiences trying to persuade; I have \nused passion in that effort to persuade; but I refused to stand before this \naudience and try to persuade with the passion I had used elsewhere. It was not \nthe basis on which a court should decide the issue.",
        "Would it have been different if I had argued it differently? Would it have been \ndifferent if Don Ayer had argued it? Or Charles Fried? Or Kathleen Sullivan?",
        "My friends huddled around me to insist it would not. The Court was not ready, my \nfriends insisted. This was a loss that was destined. It would take a great deal \nmore to show our society why our framers were right. And when we do that, we \nwill be able to show that Court.",
        "Maybe, but I doubt it. These Justices have no financial interest in doing \nanything except the right thing. They are not lobbied. They have little reason \nto resist doing right. I can’t help but think that if I had stepped down from \nthis pretty picture of dispassionate justice, I could have persuaded.",
        "And even if I couldn’t, then that doesn’t excuse what happened in January. For \nat the start of this case, one of America’s leading intellectual property \nprofessors stated publicly that my bringing this case was a mistake. The Court \nis not ready, Peter Jaszi said; this issue should not be raised until it is.",
        "After the argument and after the decision, Peter said to me, and publicly, that \nhe was wrong. But if indeed that Court could not have been persuaded, then that \nis all the evidence that’s needed to know that here again Peter was right. \nEither I was not ready to argue this case in a way that would do some good or \nthey were not ready to hear this case in a way that would do some good. Either \nway, the decision to bring this casea decision I had made four years beforewas \nwrong.",
        "While the reaction to the Sonny Bono Act itself was almost unanimously negative, \nthe reaction to the Court’s decision was mixed. No one, at least in the press, \ntried to say that extending the term of copyright was a good idea. We had won \nthat battle over ideas. Where the decision was praised, it was praised by papers \nthat had been skeptical of the Court’s activism in other cases. Deference was a \ngood thing, even if it left standing a silly law. But where the decision was \nattacked, it was attacked because it left standing a silly and harmful law. The \nNew York Times wrote in its editorial,",
        "In effect, the Supreme Court’s decision makes it likely that we are seeing the \nbeginning of the end of public domain and the birth of copyright perpetuity. The \npublic domain has been a grand experiment, one that should not be allowed to \ndie. The ability to draw freely on the entire creative output of humanity is one \nof the reasons we live in a time of such fruitful creative ferment.",
        "The best responses were in the cartoons. There was a gaggle of hilarious images\nof Mickey in jail and the like. The best, from my view of the case, was Ruben \nBolling’s, reproduced on the next page. The powerful and wealthy line is a bit \nunfair. But the punch in the face felt exactly like that.",
        "The image that will always stick in my head is that evoked by the quote from \n/The New York Times. That grand experiment we call the public domain is \nover? When I can make light of it, I think, Honey, I shrunk the Constitution. \nBut I can rarely make light of it. We had in our Constitution a commitment to \nfree culture. In the case that I fathered, the Supreme Court effectively \nrenounced that commitment. A better lawyer would have made them see differently.",
