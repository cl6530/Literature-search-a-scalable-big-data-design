        "In six minutes the noon whistle would blow. But the workmen–the seven\nhundred in the Ranger-Whitney flour mills, the two hundred and fifty in\nthe Ranger-Whitney cooperage adjoining–were, every man and boy of them,\nas hard at it as if the dinner rest were hours away. On the threshold of\nthe long room where several scores of filled barrels were being headed\nand stamped there suddenly appeared a huge figure, tall and broad and\nsolid, clad in a working suit originally gray but now white with the\nflour dust that saturated the air, and coated walls and windows both\nwithin and without. At once each of the ninety-seven men and boys was\naware of that presence and unconsciously showed it by putting on extra\n“steam.” With swinging step the big figure crossed the packing room. The\ngray-white face held straight ahead, but the keen blue eyes paused upon\neach worker and each task. And every “hand” in those two great factories\nknew how all-seeing that glance was–critical, but just; exacting, but\nencouraging. All-seeing, in this instance, did not mean merely\nfault-seeing.",
        "Hiram Ranger, manufacturing partner and controlling owner of the\nRanger-Whitney Company of St. Christopher and Chicago, went on into the\ncooperage, leaving energy behind him, rousing it before him. Many times,\neach working day, between seven in the morning and six at night, he made\nthe tour of those two establishments. A miller by inheritance and\ntraining, he had learned the cooper’s trade like any journeyman, when he\ndecided that the company should manufacture its own barrels. He was not a\nrich man who was a manufacturer; he was a manufacturer who was\nincidentally rich–one who made of his business a vocation. He had no\ntheories on the dignity of labor; he simply exemplified it, and would\nhave been amazed, and amused or angered according to his mood, had it\nbeen suggested to him that useful labor is not as necessary and\ncontinuous a part of life as breathing. He did not speculate and talk\nabout ideals; he lived them, incessantly and unconsciously. The talker of\nideals and the liver of ideals get echo and response, each after his\nkind–the talker, in the empty noise of applause; the liver, in the\nsilent spread of the area of achievement.",
        "A moment after Hiram roused the packing room of the flour mill with the\nmaster’s eye, he was in the cooperage, the center of a group round one of\nthe hooping machines. It had got out of gear, and the workman had bungled\nin shutting off power; the result was chaos that threatened to stop the\nwhole department for the rest of the day. Ranger brushed away the\nwrangling tinkerers and examined the machine. After grasping the problem\nin all its details, he threw himself flat upon his face, crawled under\nthe machine, and called for a light. A moment later his voice issued\nagain, in a call for a hammer. Several minutes of sharp hammering; then\nthe mass of iron began to heave. It rose at the upward pressure of\nRanger’s powerful arms and legs, shoulders and back; it crashed over on\nits side; he stood up and, without pause or outward sign of his exertion\nof enormous strength, set about adjusting the gearing to action, with the\nbroken machinery cut out. “And he past sixty!” muttered one workman to\nanother, as a murmur of applause ran round the admiring circle. Clearly\nHiram Ranger was master there not by reason of money but because he was\nfirst in brain and in brawn; not because he could hire but because he\ncould direct and do.",
        "In the front rank of the ring of on-looking workmen stood a young man,\ntall as himself and like him in the outline of his strong features,\nespecially like him in the fine curve of the prominent nose. But in\ndress and manner this young man was the opposite of the master workman\nnow facing him in the dust and sweat of toil. He wore a fashionable suit\nof light gray tweed, a water-woven Panama with a wine-colored ribbon, a\nwine-colored scarf; several inches of wine-colored socks showed below his\nhigh-rolled, carefully creased trousers. There was a seal ring on the\nlittle finger of the left of a pair of large hands strong with the\nsymmetrical strength which is got only at “polite” or useless exercise.\nResting lightly between his lips was a big, expensive-looking Egyptian\ncigarette; the mingled odor of that and a delicate cologne scented the\nair. With a breeziness which a careful observer of the niceties of manner\nmight have recognized as a disguise of nervousness, the young man\nadvanced, extending his right hand.",
        "“Hello, father!” said he, “I came to bring you home to lunch.”",
        "The master workman did not take the offered hand. After a quick glance of\npride and pleasure which no father could have denied so manly and\nhandsome a son, he eyed the young man with a look that bit into every one\nof his fashionable details. Presently he lifted his arm and pointed. The\nson followed the direction of that long, strong, useful-looking\nforefinger, until his gaze rested upon a sign: “No Smoking\"–big, black\nletters on a white background.",
        "“Beg pardon,” he stammered, flushing and throwing away the cigarette.",
        "The father went to the smoking butt and set his foot upon it. The son’s\nface became crimson; he had flung the cigarette among the shavings which\nlittered the floor. “The scientists say a fire can’t be lighted from\nburning tobacco,” he said, with a vigorous effort to repair the rent in\nhis surface of easy assurance.",
        "The old man–if that adjective can be justly applied to one who had such\nstrength and energy as his–made no reply. He strode toward the door, the\nson following, acute to the grins and winks the workmen were exchanging\nbehind his back. The father opened the shut street door of the cooperage,\nand, when the son came up, pointed to the big, white letters: “No\nAdmittance. Apply at the Office.”",
        "“How did you get in here?” he asked.",
        "“I called in at the window and ordered one of the men to open the door,\"\nexplained the son.",
        "“Ordered.” The father merely repeated the word.",
        "“Requested, then,” said the son, feeling that he was displaying\npraiseworthy patience with “the governor’s” eccentricities.",
        "“Which workman?”",
        "The son indicated a man who was taking a dinner pail from under a\nbench at the nearest window. The father called to him: “Jerry!” Jerry\ncame quickly.",
        "“Why did you let this young–young gentleman in among us?”",
        "“I saw it was Mr. Arthur,” began Jerry.",
        "“Then you saw it was not anyone who has any business here. Who gave you\nauthority to suspend the rules of this factory?”",
        "“Don’t, father!” protested Arthur. “You certainly can’t blame him. He\nknew I’d make trouble if he didn’t obey.”",
        "“He knew nothing of the sort,” replied Hiram Ranger. “I haven’t been\ndealing with men for fifty years–However, next time you’ll know what to\ndo, Jerry.”",
        "“He warned me it was against the rules,” interjected Arthur.",
        "A triumphant smile gleamed in the father’s eyes at this vindication of\nthe discipline of the mills. “Then he knew he was doing wrong. He must be\nfined. You can pay the fine, young gentleman–if you wish.”",
        "“Certainly,” murmured Arthur. “And now, let’s go to lunch.”",
        "“To dinner,” corrected the father; “your mother and I have dinner in the\nmiddle of the day, not lunch.”",
        "“To dinner, then. Anything you please, pa, only let’s go.”",
        "When they were at the office and the father was about to enter the inner\nroom to change his clothes, he wheeled and said: “Why ain’t you at\nHarvard, passing your examinations?”",
        "Arthur’s hands contracted and his eyes shifted; in a tone to which\nrepression gave a seeming lightness, he announced: “The exams, are over.\nI’ve been plucked.”",
        "The slang was new to Hiram Ranger, but he understood. In important\nmatters his fixed habit was never to speak until he had thought well;\nwithout a word he turned and, with a heaviness that was new in his\nmovements, went into the dressing room. The young man drew a cautious but\nprofound breath of relief–the confession he had been dreading was over;\nhis father knew the worst. “If the governor only knew the world better,\"\nhe said to himself, “he’d know that at every college the best fellows\nalways skate along the edge of the thin ice. But he doesn’t, and so he\nthinks he’s disgraced.” He lit another cigarette by way of consolation\nand clarification.",
        "When the father reappeared, dressed for the street, he was apparently\nunconscious of the cigarette. They walked home in silence–a\nstriking-looking pair, with their great similar forms and their handsome\nsimilar faces, typical impersonations of the first generation that is\nsowing in labor, and the second generation that is reaping in idleness.",
        "“Oh!” exclaimed Arthur, as they entered the Ranger place and began to\nascend the stone walk through the lawns sloping down from the big,\nsubstantial-looking, creeper-clad house. “I stopped at Cleveland half a\nday, on the way West, and brought Adelaide along.” He said this with\nelaborate carelessness; in fact, he had begged her to come that she might\nonce more take her familiar and highly successful part of buffer between\nhim and his father’s displeasure.",
        "The father’s head lifted, and the cloud over his face also. “How is she?\"\nhe asked. “Bang up!” answered Arthur. “She’s the sort of a sister a man’s\nproud of–looks and style, and the gait of a thoroughbred.” He\ninterrupted himself with a laugh. “There she is, now!” he exclaimed.",
        "This was caused by the appearance, in the open front doors, of a strange\ncreature with a bright pink ribbon arranged as a sort of cockade around\nand above its left ear–a brown, hairy, unclean-looking thing that gazed\nwith human inquisitiveness at the approaching figures. As the elder\nRanger drew down his eyebrows the creature gave a squeak of alarm and,\ndropping from a sitting position to all fours, wheeled and shambled\nswiftly along the wide hall, walking human fashion with its hind feet,\ndog fashion with its fore feet or arms.",
        "At first sight of this apparition Ranger halted. He stared with an\nexpression so astounded that Arthur laughed outright.",
        "“What was that?” he now demanded.",
        "“Simeon,” replied Arthur. “Del has taken on a monk. It’s the latest fad.”",
        "“Oh!” ejaculated Ranger. “Simeon.”",
        "“She named it after grandfather–and there is a–” Arthur stopped\nshort. He remembered that “Simeon” was his father’s father; perhaps his\nfather might not see the joke. “That is,” he explained, “she was looking\nfor a name, and I thought of ’simian,’ naturally, and that, of course,\nsuggested ’Simeon’–and–”",
        "“That’ll do,” said Hiram, in a tone of ominous calm which his family\nknew was the signal that a subject must be dropped.",
        "Now there was a quick froufrou of skirts, and from the sitting room to\nthe left darted a handsome, fair girl of nineteen, beautifully dressed in\na gray summer silk with simple but effectively placed bands of pink\nembroidery on blouse and skirt. As she bounded down the steps and into\nher father’s arms her flying skirts revealed a pair of long, narrow feet\nin stylish gray shoes and gray silk stockings exactly matching the rest\nof her costume. “Daddy! Daddy!” she cried.",
        "His arms were trembling as they clasped her–were trembling with the\nemotion that surged into her eyes in the more obvious but less\nsignificant form of tears. “Glad to see you, Delia,” was all he said.",
        "She put her slim white forefinger on his lips.",
        "He smiled. “Oh! I forgot. You’re Adelaide, of course, since you’ve\ngrown up.”",
        "“Why call me out of my name?” she demanded, gayly. “You should have\nchristened me Delia if you had wanted me named that.”",
        "“I’ll try to remember, next time,” he said, meekly. His gray eyes were\ndancing and twinkling like sunbeams pouring from breaches in a spent\nstorm-cloud; there was an eloquence of pleasure far beyond laughter’s in\nthe rare, infrequent eye smiles from his sober, strong face.",
        "Now there was a squeaking and chattering behind them. Adelaide whirled\nfree of her father’s arms and caught up the monkey. “Put out your hand,\nsir,” said she, and she kissed him. Her father shuddered, so awful was\nthe contrast between the wizened, dirty-brown face and her roselike\nskin and fresh fairness. “Put out your hand and bow, sir,” she went on.\n“This is Mr. Hiram Ranger, Mr. Simeon. Mr. Simeon, Mr. Ranger; Mr.\nRanger, Mr. Simeon.”",
        "Hiram, wondering at his own weakness, awkwardly took the paw so uncannily\nlike a mummied hand. “What did you do this for, Adelaide?” said he, in a\ntone of mild remonstrance where he had intended to be firm.",
        "“He’s so fascinating, I couldn’t resist. He’s so wonderfully human–”",
        "“That’s it,” said her father; “so–so–”",
        "“Loathsomely human,” interjected Arthur.",
        "“Loathsome,” said the father.",
        "“That impression soon wears off,” assured Adelaide, “and he’s just like a\nhuman being as company. I’d be bored to death if I didn’t have him. He\ngives me an occupation.”",
        "At this the cloud settled on Ranger’s face again–a cloud of sadness. An\noccupation!",
        "Simeon hid his face in Adelaide’s shoulder and began to whimper. She\npatted him softly. “How can you be so cruel?” she reproached her father.\n“He has feelings almost like a human being.”",
        "Ranger winced. Had the daughter not been so busy consoling her unhappy\npet, the father’s expression might have suggested to her that there was,\nnot distant from her, a being who had feelings, not almost, but quite\nhuman, and who might afford an occupation for an occupation-hunting young\nwoman which might make love and care for a monkey superfluous. But he\nsaid nothing. He noted that the monkey’s ribbon exactly matched the\nembroidery on Adelaide’s dress.",
        "“If he were a dog or a cat, you wouldn’t mind,” she went on.",
        "True enough! Clearly, he was unreasonable with her.",
        "“Do you want me to send him away?”",
        "“I’ll get used to him, I reckon,” replied Hiram, adding, with a faint\ngleam of sarcasm, “I’ve got used to a great many things these last\nfew years.”",
        "They went silently into the house, Adelaide and Arthur feeling that their\nfather had quite unreasonably put a damper upon their spirits–a feeling\nwhich he himself had. He felt that he was right, and he was puzzled to\nfind himself, even in his own mind, in the wrong.",
        "“He’s hopelessly old-fashioned!” murmured Arthur to his sister.",
        "“Yes, but such a dear,” murmured Adelaide.",
        "“No wonder you say that!” was his retort. “You wind him round\nyour finger.”",
        "In the sitting room–the “back parlor\"–Mrs. Ranger descended upon them\nfrom the direction of the kitchen. Ellen was dressed for work; her old\ngingham, for all its neatness, was in as sharp contrast to her daughter’s\ngarb of the lady of leisure as were Hiram’s mill clothes to his son’s\n“London latest.” “It’s almost half-past twelve,” she said. “Dinner’s been\nready more than half an hour. Mary’s furious, and it’s hard enough to\nkeep servants in this town since the canning factories started.”",
        "Adelaide and Arthur laughed; Hiram smiled. They were all thoroughly\nfamiliar with that canning-factory theme. It constituted the chief\nfeature of the servant problem in Saint X, as everybody called St.\nChristopher; and the servant problem there, as everywhere else, was the\nchief feature of domestic economy. As Mrs. Ranger’s mind was concentrated\nupon her household, the canning factories were under fire from her early\nand late, in season and out of season.",
        "“And she’s got to wait on the table, too,” continued Ellen, too\ninterested in reviewing her troubles to mind the amusement of the rest of\nthe family.",
        "“Why, where’s the new girl Jarvis brought you?” asked Hiram.",
        "“She came from way back in the country, and, when she set the table, she\nfixed five places. ’There’s only four of us, Barbara,’ said I. ’Yes,\nMrs. Ranger,’ says she, ’four and me.’ ’But how’re you going to wait on\nthe table and sit with us?’ says I, very kindly, for I step mighty soft\nwith those people. ’Oh, I don’t mind bouncin’ up and down,’ says she; ’I\ncan chew as I walk round.’ When I explained, she up and left in a huff.\n’I’m as good as you are, Mrs. Ranger, I’d have you know,’ she said, as\nshe was going, just to set Mary afire; ’my father’s an independent\nfarmer, and I don’t have to live out. I just thought I’d like to visit\nin town, and I’d heard your folks well spoke of. I’ll get a place in the\ncanning factory!’ I wasn’t sorry to have her go. You ought to have seen\nthe way she set the table!”",
        "“We’ll have to get servants from the East,” said Arthur. “They know their\nplace a little better there. We can get some English that have just come\nover. They’re the best–thoroughly respectful.”",
        "He did not see the glance his father shot at him from under his heavy\neyebrows. But Adelaide did–she was expecting it. “Don’t talk like a cad,\nArtie!” she said. “You know you don’t think that way.”",
        "“Oh, of course, I don’t admire that spirit–or lack of it,” he replied.\n“But–what are you going to do? It’s the flunkies or the Barbaras and\nMarys–or doing our own work.”",
        "To Hiram Ranger that seemed unanswerable, and his resentment against his\nson for expressing ideas for which he had utter contempt seemed\nunreasonable. Again reason put him in the wrong, though instinct was\ninsisting that he was in the right.",
        "“It’s a pity people aren’t contented in ’the station to which God has\ncalled them,’ as the English prayer book says,” continued Arthur, not\ncatching sensitive Adelaide’s warning frown.",
        "“If your mother and I had been content,” said Hiram, “you and Delia would\nbe looking for places in the canning factory.” The remark was doubly\nstartling–for the repressed energy of its sarcasm, and because, as a\nrule, Hiram never joined in the discussions in the family circle.",
        "They were at the table, all except Mrs. Ranger. She had disappeared in\nthe direction of the kitchen and presently reappeared bearing a soup\ntureen, which she set down before her husband. “I don’t dare ask Mary to\nwait on the table,” said she. “If I did, she’s just in the humor to up\nand light out, too; and your mother’s got no hankering for hanging over a\nhot stove in this weather.”",
        "She transferred the pile of soup plates from the sideboard and seated\nherself. Her husband poured the soup, and the plates were passed from\nhand to hand until all were served. “If the Sandyses could see us now,\nDel,” said Arthur.",
        "“Or the Whitneys,” suggested Adelaide, and both laughed as people laugh\nwhen they think the joke, or the best part of it, is a secret between\nthemselves.",
        "Nothing more was said until the soup was finished and Mrs. Ranger rose\nand began to remove the dishes. Adelaide, gazing at the table, her\nthoughts far away, became uneasy, stirred, looked up; she saw that the\ncause of her uneasiness was the eyes of her father fixed steadily upon\nher in a look which she could not immediately interpret. When he saw that\nhe had her attention, he glanced significantly toward her mother, waiting\nupon them. “If the Sandyses or the Whitneys could see us now!” he said.",
        "She reddened, pushed back her chair, and sprang up. “Oh, I never\nthought!” she exclaimed. “Sit down, mother, and let me do that. You\nand father have got us into awful bad ways, always indulging us and\nwaiting on us.”",
        "“You let me alone,” replied her mother. “I’m used to it. I did my own\nwork for fifteen years after we were married, and I’d have been doing it\nyet if your father hadn’t just gone out and got a girl and brought her\nin and set her to work. No; sit down, Del. You don’t know anything about\nwork. I didn’t bring you up to be a household drudge.”",
        "But Del was on her way to the kitchen, whence she presently reappeared\nwith a platter and a vegetable dish. Down the front of her skirt was a\nstreak of grease. “There!” exclaimed Mrs. Ranger, coloring high with\nexasperation, “your dress is spoiled! I don’t believe I can take it out\nof that kind of goods without leaving a spot. Hiram, I do wish you\nwouldn’t meddle with the children! It seems to me you’ve got enough to do\nto ’tend your own affairs at the mill.”",
        "This was unanswerable, or so it seemed to her husband. Once more he felt\nin the wrong, when he knew that, somehow, he was in the right.",
        "But Adelaide was laughing and going forward gracefully with her duties as\nwaitress. “It’s nothing,” she said; “the stain will come out; and, if it\ndoesn’t, there’s no harm done. The dress is an old thing. I’ve worn it\nuntil everybody’s sick of the sight of it.”",
        "Mrs. Ranger now took her turn at looking disapproval. She exclaimed:\n“Why, the dress is as good as new; much too good to travel in. You ought\nto have worn a linen duster over it on the train.”",
        "At this even Hiram showed keen amusement, and Mrs. Ranger herself joined\nin the laugh. “Well, it was a good, sensible fashion, anyhow,” said she.",
        "Instead of hurrying through dinner to get back to his work with the one\no’clock whistle, Hiram Ranger lingered on, much to the astonishment of\nhis family. When the faint sound of the whistles of the distant factories\nwas borne to them through the open windows, Mrs. Ranger cried, “You’ll be\nlate, father.”",
        "“I’m in no hurry to-day,” said Ranger, rousing from the seeming\nabstraction in which he passed most of his time with his assembled\nfamily. After dinner he seated himself on the front porch. Adelaide\ncame up behind and put her arm round his neck. “You’re not feeling\nwell, daddy?”",
        "“Not extra,” he answered. “But it’s nothing to bother about. I thought\nI’d rest a few minutes.” He patted her in shy expression of gratitude for\nher little attention. It is not strange that Del overvalued the merit of\nthese trivial attentions of hers when they were valued thus high by her\nfather, who longed for proofs of affection and, because of his shyness\nand silence, got few.",
        "“Hey, Del! Hurry up! Get into your hat and dust-coat!” was now heard, in\nArthur’s voice, from the drive to the left of the lawns.",
        "Hiram’s glance shifted to the direction of the sound. Arthur was perched\nhigh in a dogcart to which were attached two horses, one before the\nother. Adelaide did not like to leave her father with that expression on\nhis face, but after a brief hesitation she went into the house. Hiram\nadvanced slowly across the lawn toward the tandem. When he had inspected\nit in detail, at close range, he said: “Where’d you get it, young\ngentleman?” Again there was stress on the “gentleman.”",
        "“Oh, I’ve had it at Harvard several months,” he replied carelessly. “I\nshipped it on. I sold the horses–got a smashing good price for ’em.\nYours ain’t used to tandem, but I guess I can manage ’em.”",
        "“That style of hitching’s new to these parts,” continued Hiram.",
        "Arthur felt the queerness of his father’s tone. “Two, side by side, or\ntwo, one in front of the other–where’s the difference?”",
        "True, reflected Hiram. He was wrong again–yet again unconvinced.\nCertainly the handsome son, so smartly gotten up, seated in this smart\ntrap, did look attractive–but somehow not as he would have had hisson look. Adelaide came; he helped her to the lower seat. As he watched\nthem dash away, as fine-looking a pair of young people as ever\ngladdened a father’s eye, this father’s heart lifted with pride–but\nsank again. Everything seemed all right; why, then, did everything\nfeel all wrong?",
        "“I’m not well to-day,” he muttered. He returned to the porch, walking\nheavily. In body and in mind he felt listless. There seemed to be\nsomething or some one inside him–a newcomer–aloof from all that he had\nregarded as himself–aloof from his family, from his work, from his own\npersonality–an outsider, studying the whole perplexedly and gloomily.",
        "As he was leaving the gate a truck entered the drive. It was loaded with\ntrunks–his son’s and his daughter’s baggage on the way from the station.\nHiram paused and counted the boxes–five huge trunks–Adelaide’s beyond\ndoubt; four smaller ones, six of steamer size and thereabouts–profuse\nand elegant Arthur’s profuse and elegant array of canvas and leather.\nThis mass of superfluity seemed to add itself to his burden. He recalled\nwhat his wife had once said when he hesitated over some new extravagance\nof the children’s: “What’d we toil and save for, unless to give them a\nbetter time than we had? What’s the use of our having money if they can’t\nenjoy it?” A “better time,” “enjoy\"–they sounded all right, but were\nthey really all right? Was this really a “better time”?–really\nenjoyment? Were his and his wife’s life all wrong, except as they had\ncontributed to this new life of thoughtless spending and useless activity\nand vanity and splurge?",
        "Instead of going toward the factories, he turned east and presently out\nof Jefferson Street into Elm. He paused at a two-story brick house\npainted brown, with a small but brilliant and tasteful garden in front\nand down either side. To the right of the door was an unobtrusive\nblack-and-gold sign bearing the words “Ferdinand Schulze, M.D.” He rang,\nwas admitted by a pretty, plump, Saxon-blond young woman–the doctor’s\nyounger daughter and housekeeper. She looked freshly clean and\nwholesome–and so useful! Hiram’s eyes rested upon her approvingly; and\noften afterwards his thoughts returned to her, lingering upon her and his\nown daughter in that sort of vague comparisons which we would not\nentertain were we aware of them.",
        "Dr. Schulze was the most distinguished–indeed, the only\ndistinguished–physician in Saint X. He was a short, stout, grizzled,\nspectacled man, with a nose like a scarlet button and a mouth like a\nbuttonhole; in speech he was abrupt, and, on the slightest pretext or no\npretext at all, sharp; he hid a warm sympathy for human nature,\nespecially for its weaknesses, behind an uncompromising candor which he\nregarded as the duty of the man of science toward a vain and deluded race\nthat knew little and learned reluctantly. A man is either better or worse\nthan the manner he chooses for purposes of conciliating or defying the\nworld. Dr. Schulze was better, as much better as his mind was superior to\nhis body. He and his motherless daughters were “not in it” socially.\nSaint X was not quite certain whether it shunned them or they it. His\nservices were sought only in extremities, partly because he would lie to\nhis patients neither when he knew what ailed them nor when he did not,\nand partly because he was a militant infidel. He lost no opportunity to\nattack religion in all its forms; and his two daughters let no\nopportunity escape to show that they stood with their father, whom\nthey adored, and who had brought them up with his heart. It was Dr.\nSchulze’s furious unbelief, investing him with a certain suggestion of\nSatan-got intelligence, that attracted Saint X to him in serious\nillnesses–somewhat as the Christian princes of mediaeval Europe\ntolerated and believed in the Jew physicians. Saint X was only just\nreaching the stage at which it could listen to “higher criticism” without\ndread lest the talk should be interrupted by a bolt from “special\nProvidence\"; the fact that Schulze lived on, believing and talking as he\ndid, could be explained only as miraculous and mysterious forbearance in\nwhich Satan must somehow have direct part.",
        "“I didn’t expect to see you for many a year yet,” said Schulze, as\nHiram, standing, faced him sitting at his desk.",
        "The master workman grew still more pallid as he heard the thought that\nweighted him in secret thus put into words. “I have never had a doctor\nbefore in my life,” said he. “My prescription has been, when you feel\nbadly stop eating and work harder.”",
        "“Starve and sweat–none better,” said Schulze. “Well, why do you come\nhere to-day?”",
        "“This morning I lifted a rather heavy weight. I’ve felt a kind of\ntiredness ever since, and a pain in the lower part of my back–pretty\nbad. I can’t understand it.”",
        "“But I can–that’s my business. Take off your clothes and stretch\nyourself on this chair. Call me when you’re ready.”",
        "Schulze withdrew into what smelled like a laboratory. Hiram could hear\nhim rattling glass against glass and metal, could smell the fumes of\nuncorked bottles of acids. When he called, Schulze reappeared, disposed\ninstruments and tubes upon a table. “I never ask my patients questions,\"\nhe said, as he began to examine Hiram’s chest. “I lay ’em out here and go\nover ’em inch by inch. I find all the weak spots, both those that are\ncrying out and those worse ones that don’t. I never ask a man what’s the\nmatter; I tell him. And my patients, and all the fools in this town,\nthink I’m in league with the devil. A doctor who finds out what’s the\nmatter with a man Providence is trying to lay in the grave–what can it\nbe but the devil?”",
        "He had reached his subject; as he worked he talked it–religion, its\nfolly, its silliness, its cruelty, its ignorance, its viciousness. Hiram\nlistened without hearing; he was absorbed in observing the diagnosis. He\nknew nothing of medicine, but he did know good workmanship. As the\nphysician worked, his admiration and confidence grew. He began to feel\nbetter–not physically better, but that mental relief which a courageous\nman feels when the peril he is facing is stripped of the mystery that\nmade it a terror. After perhaps three quarters of an hour, Schulze\nwithdrew to the laboratory, saying: “That’s all. You may dress.”",
        "Hiram dressed, seated himself. By chance he was opposite a huge image\nfrom the Orient, a hideous, twisted thing with a countenance of sardonic\nsagacity. As he looked he began to see perverse, insidious resemblances\nto the physician himself. When Schulze reappeared and busied himself\nwriting, he looked from the stone face to the face of flesh with\nfascinated repulsion–the man and the “familiar” were so ghastly alike.\nThen he suddenly understood that this was a quaint double jest of the\neccentric physician’s–his grim fling at his lack of physical charm, his\nironic jeer at the superstitions of Saint X.",
        "“There!” said Schulze, looking up. “That’s the best I can do for you.”",
        "“What’s the matter with me?”",
        "“You wouldn’t know if I told you.”",
        "“Is it serious?”",
        "“In this world everything is serious–and nothing.”",
        "“Will I die?”",
        "Schulze slowly surveyed all Hiram’s outward signs of majesty that had\nbeen denied his own majestic intellect, noted the tremendous figure, the\nshoulders, the forehead, the massive brow and nose and chin–an\nensemble of unabused power, the handiwork of Nature at her best, a\ncreation worth while, worth preserving intact and immortal.",
        "“Yes,” he answered, with satiric bitterness; “you will have to die, and\nrot, just like the rest of us.”",
        "“Tell me!” Hiram commanded. “Will I die soon?”",
        "Schulze reflected, rubbing his red-button nose with his stubby fingers.\nWhen he spoke, his voice had a sad gentleness. “You can bear hearing it.\nYou have the right to know.” He leaned back, paused, said in a low tone:\n“Put your house in order, Mr. Ranger.”",
        "Hiram’s steadfast gray eyes met bravely the eyes of the man who had just\nread him his death warrant. A long pause; then Hiram said “Thank you,” in\nhis quiet, calm way.",
        "He took the prescriptions, went out into the street. It looked strange to\nhim; he felt like a stranger in that town where he had spent half a\ncentury–felt like a temporary tenant of that vast, strong body of his\nwhich until now had seemed himself. And he–or was it the stranger within\nhim?–kept repeating: “Put your house in order. Put your house in order.”",
