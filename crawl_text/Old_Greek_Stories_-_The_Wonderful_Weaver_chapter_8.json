        "There was a young girl in Greece whose name was Arachne. Her face was\npale but fair, and her eyes were big and blue, and her hair was long and\nlike gold. All that she cared to do from morn till noon was to sit in\nthe sun and spin; and all that she cared to do from noon till night was\nto sit in the shade and weave.",
        "And oh, how fine and fair were the things which she wove in her loom!\nFlax, wool, silk–she worked with them all; and when they came from her\nhands, the cloth which she had made of them was so thin and soft and\nbright that men came from all parts of the world to see it. And they\nsaid that cloth so rare could not be made of flax, or wool, or silk, but\nthat the warp was of rays of sunlight and the woof was of threads of\ngold.",
        "Then as, day by day, the girl sat in the sun and span, or sat in the\nshade and wove, she said: “In all the world there is no yarn so fine as\nmine, and in all the world there is no cloth so soft and smooth, nor\nsilk so bright and rare.”",
        "“Who taught you to spin and weave so well?” some one asked.",
        "“No one taught me,” she said. “I learned how to do it as I sat in the\nsun and the shade; but no one showed me.”",
        "“But it may be that Athena, the queen of the air, taught you, and you\ndid not know it.”",
        "“Athena, the queen of the air? Bah!” said Arachne. “How could she teach\nme? Can she spin such skeins of yarn as these? Can she weave goods like\nmine? I should like to see her try. I can teach her a thing or two.”",
        "She looked up and saw in the doorway a tall woman wrapped in a long\ncloak. Her face was fair to see, but stern, oh, so stern! and her gray\neyes were so sharp and bright that Arachne could not meet her gaze.",
        "“Arachne,” said the woman, “I am Athena, the queen of the air, and I\nhave heard your boast. Do you still mean to say that I have not taught\nyou how to spin and weave?”",
        "“No one has taught me,” said Arachne; “and I thank no one for what I\nknow;” and she stood up, straight and proud, by the side of her loom.",
        "“And do you still think that you can spin and weave as well as I?” said\nAthena.",
        "Arachne’s cheeks grew pale, but she said: “Yes. I can weave as well as\nyou.”",
        "“Then let me tell you what we will do,” said Athena. “Three days from\nnow we will both weave; you on your loom, and I on mine. We will ask all\nthe world to come and see us; and great Jupiter, who sits in the clouds,\nshall be the judge. And if your work is best, then I will weave no more\nso long as the world shall last; but if my work is best, then you shall\nnever use loom or spindle or distaff again. Do you agree to this?” “I\nagree,” said Arachne.",
        "“It is well,” said Athena. And she was gone.",
        "When the time came for the contest in weaving, all the world was there\nto see it, and great Jupiter sat among the clouds and looked on.",
        "Arachne had set up her loom in the shade of a mulberry tree, where\nbutterflies were flitting and grasshoppers chirping all through the\nlivelong day. But Athena had set up her loom in the sky, where the\nbreezes were blowing and the summer sun was shining; for she was the\nqueen of the air.",
        "Then Arachne took her skeins of finest silk and began to weave. And she\nwove a web of marvelous beauty, so thin and light that it would float in\nthe air, and yet so strong that it could hold a lion in its meshes; and\nthe threads of warp and woof were of many colors, so beautifully\narranged and mingled one with another that all who saw were filled with\ndelight.",
        "“No wonder that the maiden boasted of her skill,” said the people.",
        "And Jupiter himself nodded.",
        "Then Athena began to weave. And she took of the sunbeams that gilded the\nmountain top, and of the snowy fleece of the summer clouds, and of the\nblue ether of the summer sky, and of the bright green of the summer\nfields, and of the royal purple of the autumn woods,–and what do you\nsuppose she wove?",
        "The web which she wove in the sky was full of enchanting pictures of\nflowers and gardens, and of castles and towers, and of mountain heights,\nand of men and beasts, and of giants and dwarfs, and of the mighty\nbeings who dwell in the clouds with Jupiter. And those who looked upon\nit were so filled with wonder and delight, that they forgot all about\nthe beautiful web which Arachne had woven. And Arachne herself was\nashamed and afraid when she saw it; and she hid her face in her hands\nand wept.",
        "“Oh, how can I live,” she cried, “now that I must never again use loom\nor spindle or distaff?”",
        "And she kept on, weeping and weeping and weeping, and saying, “How can I\nlive?”",
        "Then, when Athena saw that the poor maiden would never have any joy\nunless she were allowed to spin and weave, she took pity on her and\nsaid:",
        "“I would free you from your bargain if I could, but that is a thing\nwhich no one can do. You must hold to your agreement never to touch loom\nor spindle again. And yet, since you will never be happy unless you can\nspin and weave, I will give you a new form so that you can carry on your\nwork with neither spindle nor loom.”",
        "Then she touched Arachne with the tip of the spear which she sometimes\ncarried; and the maiden was changed at once into a nimble spider, which\nran into a shady place in the grass and began merrily to spin and weave\na beautiful web.",
        "I have heard it said that all the spiders which have been in the world\nsince then are the children of Arachne; but I doubt whether this be\ntrue. Yet, for aught I know, Arachne still lives and spins and weaves;\nand the very next spider that you see may be she herself.",
