        "In a certain village there lived ten cloth merchants, who always went\nabout together. Once upon a time they had travelled far afield, and\nwere returning home with a great deal of money which they had obtained\nby selling their wares. Now there happened to be a dense forest near\ntheir village, and this they reached early one morning. In it there\nlived three notorious robbers, of whose existence the traders had never\nheard, and while they were still in the middle of it the robbers stood\nbefore them, with swords and cudgels in their hands, and ordered them\nto lay down all they had. The traders had no weapons with them, and so,\nthough they were many more in number, they had to submit themselves to\nthe robbers, who took away everything from them, even the very clothes\nthey wore, and gave to each only a small loin-cloth a span in breadth\nand a cubit in length.",
        "The idea that they had conquered ten men and plundered all their\nproperty, now took possession of the robbers’ minds. They seated\nthemselves like three monarchs before the men they had plundered, and\nordered them to dance to them before returning home. The merchants now\nmourned their fate. They had lost all they had, except their loin-\ncloth, and still the robbers were not satisfied, but ordered them to\ndance.",
        "There was, among the ten merchants, one who was very clever. He\npondered over the calamity that had come upon him and his friends, the\ndance they would have to perform, and the magnificent manner in which\nthe three robbers had seated themselves on the grass. At the same time\nhe observed that these last had placed their weapons on the ground, in\nthe assurance of having thoroughly cowed the traders, who were now\ncommencing to dance. So he took the lead in the dance, and, as a song\nis always sung by the leader on such occasions, to which the rest keep\ntime with hands and feet, he thus began to sing:",
        "  “We are enty men,\n  They are erith men:\n  If each erith man,   Surround eno men\n  Eno man remains.\n  Tâ, tai, tôm, tadingana.“",
        "The robbers were all uneducated, and thought that the leader was merely\nsinging a song as usual. So it was in one sense; for the leader\ncommenced from a distance, and had sung the song over twice before he\nand his companions commenced to approach the robbers. They had\nunderstood his meaning, because they had been trained in trade.",
        "When two traders discuss the price of an article in the presence of a\npurchaser, they use a riddling sort of language.",
        "“What is the price of this cloth?” one trader will ask another.",
        "“Enty rupees,” another will reply, meaning “ten rupees.”",
        "Thus, there is no possibility of the purchaser knowing what is meant\nunless he be acquainted with trade language. By the rules of this\nsecret language erith means “three,” enty means “ten,” and eno means\n“one.” So the leader by his song meant to hint to his fellow-traders\nthat they were ten men, the robbers only three, that if three pounced\nupon each of the robbers, nine of them could hold them down, while the\nremaining one bound the robbers’ hands and feet.",
        "The three thieves, glorying in their victory, and little understanding\nthe meaning of the song and the intentions of the dancers, were proudly\nseated chewing betel and tobacco. Meanwhile the song was sung a third\ntime. Tâ tai tôm had left the lips of the singer; and, before\ntadingana was out of them, the traders separated into parties of\nthree, and each party pounced upon a thief. The remaining one–the\nleader himself–tore up into long narrow strips a large piece of cloth,\nsix cubits long, and tied the hands and feet of the robbers. These were\nentirely humbled now, and rolled on the ground like three bags of rice!",
        "The ten traders now took back all their property, and armed themselves\nwith the swords and cudgels of their enemies; and when they reached\ntheir village, they often amused their friends and relatives by\nrelating their adventure.",
