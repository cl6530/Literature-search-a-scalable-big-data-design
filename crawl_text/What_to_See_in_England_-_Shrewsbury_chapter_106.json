        "The ancient city of Shrewsbury, surrounded on three sides by the river\nSevern, is most beautifully situated on a lofty peninsula. It was a\nBritish stronghold before the Conquest, when it was given by William the\nConqueror to Roger de Montgomery, who built the castle which stands on\nthe narrow isthmus leading to the town. Henry IV. stayed in the castle\nin 1403, before the battle with Harry Hotspur, which was fought at\nBattlefield, about 3 miles from the town. Only the keep of the old\nNorman castle remains, and that is now used as a modern residence. The\nquaint streets of Shrewsbury not only retain their old names, such as\nWyle Cop and Dogpole, but are filled with half-timbered houses of the\nfifteenth century.",
        "At the old Grammar School, built in 1630, and now converted into a free\nlibrary and museum, many distinguished scholars have been educated,\namong them Sir Philip Sidney and Judge Jeffreys. Outside this school is\nerected a statue to Charles Darwin, a former scholar, who was born in\nthe old suburb of Frankwell. (For Darwin’s home at Downe, see Index).\nThe Elizabethan Market House and the Council House, which was visited by\nboth Charles I. and James II. on different occasions, are two of the\nnumerous fascinating old buildings to be seen in Shrewsbury.",
        "The Church of St. Mary, founded in Saxon times, is the most important of\nthe many churches of Salop, by which name Shrewsbury is still known. The\npresent building contains examples of almost every period of English\narchitecture. Dr. Burney, the father of Fanny Burney, was baptized in\nthis church. Of Shrewsbury Abbey, which once occupied 10 acres, very\nlittle remains, with the exception of the Abbey Church, of which only\nthe nave is left. The west end has a great tower with a beautiful Gothic\nwindow. Along the banks of the river is a public park known as the\nQuarry, which has a wonderful avenue of lime trees, planted in 1719 by\none Wright of Bicton, who, with the help of two men, planted them all in\none night.",
