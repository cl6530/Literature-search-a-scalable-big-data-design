        "To admit you to the ’little nucleus,’ the ’little group,’ the ’little\nclan’ at the Verdurins’, one condition sufficed, but that one was\nindispensable; you must give tacit adherence to a Creed one of whose\narticles was that the young pianist, whom Mme. Verdurin had taken under\nher patronage that year, and of whom she said “Really, it oughtn’t to be\nallowed, to play Wagner as well as that!” left both Planté and Rubinstein\n’sitting’; while Dr. Cottard was a more brilliant diagnostician than\nPotain. Each ’new recruit’ whom the Verdurins failed to persuade that the\nevenings spent by other people, in other houses than theirs, were as dull\nas ditch-water, saw himself banished forthwith. Women being in this\nrespect more rebellious than men, more reluctant to lay aside all worldly\ncuriosity and the desire to find out for themselves whether other\ndrawing-rooms might not sometimes be as entertaining, and the Verdurins\nfeeling, moreover, that this critical spirit and this demon of frivolity\nmight, by their contagion, prove fatal to the orthodoxy of the little\nchurch, they had been obliged to expel, one after another, all those of\nthe ’faithful’ who were of the female sex.",
        "Apart from the doctor’s young wife, they were reduced almost exclusively\nthat season (for all that Mme. Verdurin herself was a thoroughly ’good’\nwoman, and came of a respectable middle-class family, excessively rich and\nwholly undistinguished, with which she had gradually and of her own accord\nsevered all connection) to a young woman almost of a ’certain class,’ a\nMme. de Crécy, whom Mme. Verdurin called by her Christian name, Odette,\nand pronounced a ’love,’ and to the pianist’s aunt, who looked as though\nshe had, at one period, ’answered the bell’: ladies quite ignorant of the\nworld, who in their social simplicity were so easily led to believe that\nthe Princesse de Sagan and the Duchesse de Guermantes were obliged to pay\nlarge sums of money to other poor wretches, in order to have anyone at\ntheir dinner-parties, that if somebody had offered to procure them an\ninvitation to the house of either of those great dames, the old doorkeeper\nand the woman of ’easy virtue’ would have contemptuously declined.",
        "The Verdurins never invited you to dinner; you had your ’place laid’\nthere. There was never any programme for the evening’s entertainment.  The\nyoung pianist would play, but only if he felt inclined, for no one was\nforced to do anything, and, as M. Verdurin used to say: “We’re all friends\nhere. Liberty Hall, you know!”",
        "If the pianist suggested playing the Ride of the Valkyries, or the Prelude\nto Tristan, Mme. Verdurin would protest, not that the music was\ndispleasing to her, but, on the contrary, that it made too violent an\nimpression.  “Then you want me to have one of my headaches? You know quite\nwell, it’s the same every time he plays that. I know what I’m in for.\nTomorrow, when I want to get up–nothing doing!” If he was not going to\nplay they talked, and one of the friends–usually the painter who was in\nfavour there that year–would “spin,” as M. Verdurin put it, “a damned\nfunny yarn that made ’em all split with laughter,” and especially Mme.\nVerdurin, for whom–so strong was her habit of taking literally the\nfigurative accounts of her emotions–Dr. Cottard, who was then just\nstarting in general practice, would “really have to come one day and set\nher jaw, which she had dislocated with laughing too much.”",
        "Evening dress was barred, because you were all ’good pals,’ and didn’t\nwant to look like the ’boring people’ who were to be avoided like the\nplague, and only asked to the big evenings, which were given as seldom as\npossible, and then only if it would amuse the painter or make the musician\nbetter known. The rest of the time you were quite happy playing charades\nand having supper in fancy dress, and there was no need to mingle any\nstrange element with the little ’clan.’",
        "But just as the ’good pals’ came to take a more and more prominent place\nin Mme. Verdurin’s life, so the ’bores,’ the ’nuisances’ grew to include\neverybody and everything that kept her friends away from her, that made\nthem sometimes plead ’previous engagements,’ the mother of one, the\nprofessional duties of another, the ’little place in the country’ of a\nthird. If Dr. Cottard felt bound to say good night as soon as they rose\nfrom table, so as to go back to some patient who was seriously ill; “I\ndon’t know,” Mme. Verdurin would say, “I’m sure it will do him far more\ngood if you don’t go disturbing him again this evening; he will have a\ngood night without you; to-morrow morning you can go round early and you\nwill find him cured.” From the beginning of December it would make her\nquite ill to think that the ’faithful’ might fail her on Christmas and New\nYear’s Days. The pianist’s aunt insisted that he must accompany her, on\nthe latter, to a family dinner at her mother’s.",
        "“You don’t suppose she’ll die, your mother,” exclaimed Mme. Verdurin\nbitterly, “if you don’t have dinner with her on New Year’s Day, like\npeople in the provinces!”",
        "Her uneasiness was kindled again in Holy Week: “Now you, Doctor, you’re a\nsensible, broad-minded man; you’ll come, of course, on Good Friday, just\nlike any other day?” she said to Cottard in the first year of the little\n’nucleus,’ in a loud and confident voice, as though there could be no\ndoubt of his answer. But she trembled as she waited for it, for if he did\nnot come she might find herself condemned to dine alone.",
        "“I shall come on Good Friday–to say good-bye to you, for we are going to\nspend the holidays in Auvergne.”",
        "“In Auvergne? To be eaten by fleas and all sorts of creatures! A fine lot\nof good that will do you!” And after a solemn pause: “If you had only told\nus, we would have tried to get up a party, and all gone there together,\ncomfortably.”",
        "And so, too, if one of the ’faithful’ had a friend, or one of the ladies a\nyoung man, who was liable, now and then, to make them miss an evening, the\nVerdurins, who were not in the least afraid of a woman’s having a lover,\nprovided that she had him in their company, loved him in their company and\ndid not prefer him to their company, would say: “Very well, then, bring\nyour friend along.” And he would be put to the test, to see whether he was\nwilling to have no secrets from Mme. Verdurin, whether he was susceptible\nof being enrolled in the ’little clan.’ If he failed to pass, the faithful\none who had introduced him would be taken on one side, and would be\ntactfully assisted to quarrel with the friend or mistress. But if the test\nproved satisfactory, the newcomer would in turn be numbered among the\n’faithful.’ And so when, in the course of this same year, the courtesan\ntold M. Verdurin that she had made the acquaintance of such a charming\ngentleman, M. Swann, and hinted that he would very much like to be allowed\nto come, M. Verdurin carried the request at once to his wife. He never\nformed an opinion on any subject until she had formed hers, his special\nduty being to carry out her wishes and those of the ’faithful’ generally,\nwhich he did with boundless ingenuity.",
        "“My dear, Mme. de Crécy has something to say to you. She would like to\nbring one of her friends here, a M. Swann. What do you say?”",
        "“Why, as if anybody could refuse anything to a little piece of perfection\nlike that. Be quiet; no one asked your opinion. I tell you that you are a\npiece of perfection.”",
        "“Just as you like,” replied Odette, in an affected tone, and then went on:\n“You know I’m not fishing for compliments.”",
        "“Very well; bring your friend, if he’s nice.”",
        "Now there was no connection whatsoever between the ’little nucleus’ and\nthe society which Swann frequented, and a purely worldly man would have\nthought it hardly worth his while, when occupying so exceptional a\nposition in the world, to seek an introduction to the Verdurins. But Swann\nwas so ardent a lover that, once he had got to know almost all the women\nof the aristocracy, once they had taught him all that there was to learn,\nhe had ceased to regard those naturalisation papers, almost a patent of\nnobility, which the Faubourg Saint-Germain had bestowed upon him, save as\na sort of negotiable bond, a letter of credit with no intrinsic value,\nwhich allowed him to improvise a status for himself in some little hole in\nthe country, or in some obscure quarter of Paris, where the good-looking\ndaughter of a local squire or solicitor had taken his fancy. For at such\ntimes desire, or love itself, would revive in him a feeling of vanity from\nwhich he was now quite free in his everyday life, although it was, no\ndoubt, the same feeling which had originally prompted him towards that\ncareer as a man of fashion in which he had squandered his intellectual\ngifts upon frivolous amusements, and had made use of his erudition in\nmatters of art only to advise society ladies what pictures to buy and how\nto decorate their houses; and this vanity it was which made him eager to\nshine, in the sight of any fair unknown who had captivated him for the\nmoment, with a brilliance which the name of Swann by itself did not emit.\nAnd he was most eager when the fair unknown was in humble circumstances.\nJust as it is not by other men of intelligence that an intelligent man is\nafraid of being thought a fool, so it is not by the great gentleman but by\nboors and ’bounders’ that a man of fashion is afraid of finding his social\nvalue underrated. Three-fourths of the mental ingenuity displayed, of the\nsocial falsehoods scattered broadcast ever since the world began by people\nwhose importance they have served only to diminish, have been aimed at\ninferiors. And Swann, who behaved quite simply and was at his ease when\nwith a duchess, would tremble^ for fear of being despised, and would\ninstantly begin to pose, were he to meet her grace’s maid.",
        "Unlike so many people, who, either from lack of energy or else from a\nresigned sense of the obligation laid upon them by their social grandeur\nto remain moored like houseboats to a certain point on the bank of the\nstream of life, abstain from the pleasures which are offered to them above\nand below that point, that degree in life in which they will remain fixed\nuntil the day of their death, and are content, in the end, to describe as\npleasures, for want of any better, those mediocre distractions, that just\nnot intolerable tedium which is enclosed there with them; Swann would\nendeavour not to find charm and beauty in the women with whom he must pass\ntime, but to pass his time among women whom he had already found to be\nbeautiful and charming. And these were, as often as not, women whose\nbeauty was of a distinctly ’common’ type, for the physical qualities which\nattracted him instinctively, and without reason, were the direct opposite\nof those that he admired in the women painted or sculptured by his\nfavourite masters. Depth of character, or a melancholy expression on a\nwoman’s face would freeze his senses, which would, however, immediately\nmelt at the sight of healthy, abundant, rosy human flesh.",
        "If on his travels he met a family whom it would have been more correct for\nhim to make no attempt to know, but among whom a woman caught his eye,\nadorned with a special charm that was new to him, to remain on his ’high\nhorse’ and to cheat the desire that she had kindled in him, to substitute\na pleasure different from that which he might have tasted in her company\nby writing to invite one of his former mistresses to come and join him,\nwould have seemed to him as cowardly an abdication in the face of life, as\nstupid a renunciation of a new form of happiness as if, instead of\nvisiting the country where he was, he had shut himself up in his own rooms\nand looked at ’views’ of Paris. He did not immure himself in the solid\nstructure of his social relations, but had made of them, so as to be able\nto set it up afresh upon new foundations wherever a woman might take his\nfancy, one of those collapsible tents which explorers carry about with\nthem. Any part of it which was not portable or could not be adapted to\nsome fresh pleasure he would discard as valueless, however enviable it\nmight appear to others. How often had his credit with a duchess, built up\nof the yearly accumulation of her desire to do him some favour for which\nshe had never found an opportunity, been squandered in a moment by his\ncalling upon her, in an indiscreetly worded message, for a recommendation\nby telegraph which would put him in touch at once with one of her agents\nwhose daughter he had noticed in the country, just as a starving man might\nbarter a diamond for a crust of bread. Indeed, when it was too late, he\nwould laugh at himself for it, for there was in his nature, redeemed by\nmany rare refinements, an element of clownishness. Then he belonged to\nthat class of intelligent men who have led a life of idleness, and who\nseek consolation and, perhaps, an excuse in the idea, which their idleness\noffers to their intelligence, of objects as worthy of their interest as\nany that could be attained by art or learning, the idea that ’Life’\ncontains situations more interesting and more romantic than all the\nromances ever written. So, at least, he would assure and had no difficulty\nin persuading the more subtle among his friends in the fashionable world,\nnotably the Baron de Charlus, whom he liked to amuse with stories of the\nstartling adventures that had befallen him, such as when he had met a\nwoman in the train, and had taken her home with him, before discovering\nthat she was the sister of a reigning monarch, in whose hands were\ngathered, at that moment, all the threads of European politics, of which\nhe found himself kept informed in the most delightful fashion, or when, in\nthe complexity of circumstances, it depended upon the choice which the\nConclave was about to make whether he might or might not become the lover\nof somebody’s cook.",
        "It was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers, generals and\nacademicians, to whom he was bound by such close ties, that Swann\ncompelled with so much cynicism to serve him as panders. All his friends\nwere accustomed to receive, from time to time, letters which called on\nthem for a word of recommendation or introduction, with a diplomatic\nadroitness which, persisting throughout all his successive ’affairs’ and\nusing different pretexts, revealed more glaringly than the clumsiest\nindiscretion, a permanent trait in his character and an unvarying quest. I\nused often to recall to myself when, many years later, I began to take an\ninterest in his character because of the similarities which, in wholly\ndifferent respects, it offered to my own, how, when he used to write to my\ngrandfather (though not at the time we are now considering, for it was\nabout the date of my own birth that Swann’s great ’affair’ began, and made\na long interruption in his amatory practices) the latter, recognising his\nfriend’s handwriting on the envelope, would exclaim: “Here is Swann asking\nfor something; on guard!” And, either from distrust or from the\nunconscious spirit of devilry which urges us to offer a thing only to\nthose who do not want it, my grandparents would meet with an obstinate\nrefusal the most easily satisfied of his prayers, as when he begged them\nfor an introduction to a girl who dined with us every Sunday, and whom\nthey were obliged, whenever Swann mentioned her, to pretend that they no\nlonger saw, although they would be wondering, all through the week, whom\nthey could invite to meet her, and often failed, in the end, to find\nanyone, sooner than make a sign to him who would so gladly have accepted.",
        "Occasionally a couple of my grandparents’ acquaintance, who had been\ncomplaining for some time that they never saw Swann now, would announce\nwith satisfaction, and perhaps with a slight inclination to make my\ngrandparents envious of them, that he had suddenly become as charming as\nhe could possibly be, and was never out of their house. My grandfather\nwould not care to shatter their pleasant illusion, but would look at my\ngrandmother, as he hummed the air of:",
        "  What is this mystery?\n  I cannot understand it;",
        "or of:",
        "  Vision fugitive...;\n  In matters such as this\n  ’Tis best to close one’s eyes.",
        "A few months later, if my grandfather asked Swann’s new friend “What about\nSwann? Do you still see as much of him as ever?” the other’s face would\nlengthen: “Never mention his name to me again!”",
        "“But I thought that you were such friends...”",
        "He had been intimate in this way for several months with some cousins of\nmy grandmother, dining almost every evening at their house. Suddenly, and\nwithout any warning, he ceased to appear. They supposed him to be ill, and\nthe lady of the house was going to send to inquire for him when, in her\nkitchen, she found a letter in his hand, which her cook had left by\naccident in the housekeeping book. In this he announced that he was\nleaving Paris and would not be able to come to the house again. The cook\nhad been his mistress, and at the moment of breaking off relations she was\nthe only one of the household whom he had thought it necessary to inform.",
        "But when his mistress for the time being was a woman in society, or at\nleast one whose birth was not so lowly, nor her position so irregular that\nhe was unable to arrange for her reception in ’society,’ then for her sake\nhe would return to it, but only to the particular orbit in which she moved\nor into which he had drawn her. “No good depending on Swann for this\nevening,” people would say; “don’t you remember, it’s his American’s night\nat the Opera?” He would secure invitations for her to the most exclusive\ndrawing-rooms, to those houses where he himself went regularly, for weekly\ndinners or for poker; every evening, after a slight ’wave’ imparted to his\nstiffly brushed red locks had tempered with a certain softness the ardour\nof his bold green eyes, he would select a flower for his buttonhole and\nset out to meet his mistress at the house of one or other of the women of\nhis circle; and then, thinking of the affection and admiration which the\nfashionable folk, whom he always treated exactly as he pleased, would,\nwhen he met them there, lavish upon him in the presence of the woman whom\nhe loved, he would find a fresh charm in that worldly existence of which\nhe had grown weary, but whose substance, pervaded and warmly coloured by\nthe flickering light which he had slipped into its midst, seemed to him\nbeautiful and rare, now that he had incorporated in it a fresh love.",
        "But while each of these attachments, each of these flirtations had been\nthe realisation, more or less complete, of a dream born of the sight of a\nface or a form which Swann had spontaneously, and without effort on his\npart, found charming, it was quite another matter when, one day at the\ntheatre, he was introduced to Odette de Crécy by an old friend of his own,\nwho had spoken of her to him as a ravishing creature with whom he might\nvery possibly come to an understanding; but had made her out to be harder\nof conquest than she actually was, so as to appear to be conferring a\nspecial favour by the introduction. She had struck Swann not, certainly,\nas being devoid of beauty, but as endowed with a style of beauty which\nleft him indifferent, which aroused in him no desire, which gave him,\nindeed, a sort of physical repulsion; as one of those women of whom every\nman can name some, and each will name different examples, who are the\nconverse of the type which our senses demand. To give him any pleasure her\nprofile was too sharp, her skin too delicate, her cheek-bones too\nprominent, her features too tightly drawn. Her eyes were fine, but so\nlarge that they seemed to be bending beneath their own weight, strained\nthe rest of her face and always made her appear unwell or in an ill\nhumour. Some time after this introduction at the theatre she had written\nto ask Swann whether she might see his collections, which would interest\nher so much, she, “an ignorant woman with a taste for beautiful things,\"\nsaying that she would know him better when once she had seen him in his\n’home,’ where she imagined him to be “so comfortable with his tea and his\nbooks\"; although she had not concealed her surprise at his being in that\npart of the town, which must be so depressing, and was “not nearly smart\nenough for such a very smart man.” And when he allowed her to come she had\nsaid to him as she left how sorry she was to have stayed so short a time\nin a house into which she was so glad to have found her way at last,\nspeaking of him as though he had meant something more to her than the rest\nof the people she knew, and appearing to unite their two selves with a\nkind of romantic bond which had made him smile. But at the time of life,\ntinged already with disenchantment, which Swann was approaching, when a\nman can content himself with being in love for the pleasure of loving\nwithout expecting too much in return, this linking of hearts, if it is no\nlonger, as in early youth, the goal towards which love, of necessity,\ntends, still is bound to love by so strong an association of ideas that it\nmay well become the cause of love if it presents itself first. In his\nyounger days a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he\nloves; later, the feeling that he possesses the heart of a woman may be\nenough to make him fall in love with her. And 50, at an age when it would\nappear–since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective\npleasure–that the taste for feminine beauty must play the larger part in\nits procreation, love may come into being, love of the most physical\norder, without any foundation in desire.  At this time of life a man has\nalready been wounded more than once by the darts of love; it no longer\nevolves by itself, obeying its own incomprehensible and fatal laws, before\nhis passive and astonished heart. We come to its aid; we falsify it by\nmemory and by suggestion; recognising one of its symptoms we recall and\nrecreate the rest. Since we possess its hymn, engraved on our hearts in\nits entirety, there is no need of any woman to repeat the opening lines,\npotent with the admiration which her beauty inspires, for us to remember\nall that follows. And if she begin in the middle, where it sings of our\nexisting, henceforward, for one another only, we are well enough attuned\nto that music to be able to take it up and follow our partner, without\nhesitation, at the first pause in her voice.",
        "Odette de Crécy came again to see Swann; her visits grew more frequent,\nand doubtless each visit revived the sense of disappointment which he felt\nat the sight of a face whose details he had somewhat forgotten in the\ninterval, not remembering it as either so expressive or, in spite of her\nyouth, so faded; he used to regret, while she was talking to him, that her\nreally considerable beauty was not of the kind which he spontaneously\nadmired.  It must be remarked that Odette’s face appeared thinner and more\nprominent than it actually was, because her forehead and the upper part of\nher cheeks, a single and almost plane surface, were covered by the masses\nof hair which women wore at that period, drawn forward in a fringe, raised\nin crimped waves and falling in stray locks over her ears; while as for\nher figure, and she was admirably built, it was impossible to make out its\ncontinuity (on account of the fashion then prevailing, and in spite of her\nbeing one of the best-dressed women in Paris) for the corset, jetting\nforwards in an arch, as though over an imaginary stomach, and ending in a\nsharp point, beneath which bulged out the balloon of her double skirts,\ngave a woman, that year, the appearance of being composed of different\nsections badly fitted together; to such an extent did the frills, the\nflounces, the inner bodice follow, in complete independence, controlled\nonly by the fancy of their designer or the rigidity of their material, the\nline which led them to the knots of ribbon, falls of lace, fringes of\nvertically hanging jet, or carried them along the bust, but nowhere\nattached themselves to the living creature, who, according as the\narchitecture of their fripperies drew them towards or away from her own,\nfound herself either strait-laced to suffocation or else completely\nburied.",
        "But, after Odette had left him, Swann would think with a smile of her\ntelling him how the time would drag until he allowed her to come again; he\nremembered the anxious, timid way in which she had once begged him that it\nmight not be very long, and the way in which she had looked at him then,\nfixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze, which gave her a touching\nair beneath the bunches of artificial pansies fastened in the front of her\nround bonnet of white straw, tied with strings of black velvet. “And won’t\nyou,” she had ventured, “come just once and take tea with me?” He had\npleaded pressure of work, an essay–which, in reality, he had abandoned\nyears ago–on Vermeer of Delft. “I know that I am quite useless,” she had\nreplied, “a little wild thing like me beside a learned great man like you.\nI should be like the frog in the fable! And yet I should so much like to\nlearn, to know things, to be initiated. What fun it would be to become a\nregular bookworm, to bury my nose in a lot of old papers!” she had gone\non, with that self-satisfied air which a smart woman adopts when she\ninsists that her one desire is to give herself up, without fear of soiling\nher fingers, to some unclean task, such as cooking the dinner, with her\n“hands right in the dish itself.” “You will only laugh at me, but this\npainter who stops you from seeing me,” she meant Vermeer, “I have never\neven heard of him; is he alive still? Can I see any of his things in\nParis, so as to have some idea of what is going on behind that great brow\nwhich works so hard, that head which I feel sure is always puzzling away\nabout things; just to be able to say ’There, that’s what he’s thinking\nabout!’ What a dream it would be to be able to help you with your work.”",
        "He had sought an excuse in his fear of forming new friendships, which he\ngallantly described as his fear of a hopeless passion. “You are afraid of\nfalling in love? How funny that is, when I go about seeking nothing else,\nand would give my soul just to find a little love somewhere!” she had said,\nso naturally and with such an air of conviction that he had been genuinely\ntouched. “Some woman must have made you suffer. And you think that the rest\nare all like her. She can’t have understood you: you are so utterly\ndifferent from ordinary men. That’s what I liked about you when I first\nsaw you; I felt at once that you weren’t like everybody else.”",
        "“And then, besides, there’s yourself––” he had continued, “I know what\nwomen are; you must have a whole heap of things to do, and never any time\nto spare.”",
        "“I? Why, I have never anything to do. I am always free, and I always will\nbe free if you want me. At whatever hour of the day or night it may suit\nyou to see me, just send for me, and I shall be only too delighted to\ncome. Will you do that? Do you know what I should really like–to\nintroduce you to Mme. Verdurin, where I go every evening. Just fancy my\nfinding you there, and thinking that it was a little for my sake that you\nhad gone.”",
        "No doubt, in thus remembering their conversations, in thinking about her\nthus when he was alone, he did no more than call her image into being\namong those of countless other women in his romantic dreams; but if,\nthanks to some accidental circumstance (or even perhaps without that\nassistance, for the circumstance which presents itself at the moment when\na mental state, hitherto latent, makes itself felt, may well have had no\ninfluence whatsoever upon that state), the image of Odette de Crécy came\nto absorb the whole of his dreams, if from those dreams the memory of her\ncould no longer be eliminated, then her bodily imperfections would no\nlonger be of the least importance, nor would the conformity of her body,\nmore or less than any other, to the requirements of Swann’s taste; since,\nhaving become the body of her whom he loved, it must henceforth be the\nonly one capable of causing him joy or anguish.",
        "It so happened that my grandfather had known–which was more than could be\nsaid of any other actual acquaintance–the family of these Verdurins.\nBut he had entirely severed his connection with what he called “young\nVerdurin,” taking a general view of him as one who had fallen–though\nwithout losing hold of his millions–among the riff-raff of Bohemia.  One\nday he received a letter from Swann asking whether my grandfather could\nput him in touch with the Verdurins. “On guard! on guard!” he exclaimed as\nhe read it, “I am not at all surprised; Swann was bound to finish up like\nthis. A nice lot of people! I cannot do what he asks, because, in the\nfirst place, I no longer know the gentleman in question. Besides, there\nmust be a woman in it somewhere, and I don’t mix myself up in such\nmatters.  Ah, well, we shall see some fun if Swann begins running after\nthe little Verdurins.”",
        "And on my grandfather’s refusal to act as sponsor, it was Odette herself\nwho had taken Swann to the house.",
        "The Verdurins had had dining with them, on the day when Swann made his\nfirst appearance, Dr. and Mme. Cottard, the young pianist and his aunt,\nand the painter then in favour, while these were joined, in the course of\nthe evening, by several more of the ’faithful.’",
        "Dr. Cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to reply\nto any observation, or whether the speaker was jesting or in earnest.  And\nso in any event he would embellish all his facial expressions with the\noffer of a conditional, a provisional smile whose expectant subtlety would\nexonerate him from the charge of being a simpleton, if the remark\naddressed to him should turn out to have been facetious. But as he must\nalso be prepared to face the alternative, he never dared to allow this\nsmile a definite expression on his features, and you would see there a\nperpetually flickering uncertainty, in which you might decipher the\nquestion that he never dared to ask: “Do you really mean that?” He was no\nmore confident of the manner in which he ought to conduct himself in the\nstreet, or indeed in life generally, than he was in a drawing-room; and he\nmight be seen greeting passers-by, carriages, and anything that occurred\nwith a malicious smile which absolved his subsequent behaviour of all\nimpropriety, since it proved, if it should turn out unsuited to the\noccasion, that he was well aware of that, and that if he had assumed a\nsmile, the jest was a secret of his own.",
        "On all those points, however, where a plain question appeared to him to be\npermissible, the Doctor was unsparing in his endeavours to cultivate the\nwilderness of his ignorance and uncertainty and so to complete his\neducation.",
        "So it was that, following the advice given him by a wise mother on his\nfirst coming up to the capital from his provincial home, he would never\nlet pass either a figure of speech or a proper name that was new to him\nwithout an effort to secure the fullest information upon it.",
        "As regards figures of speech, he was insatiable in his thirst for\nknowledge, for often imagining them to have a more definite meaning than\nwas actually the case, he would want to know what, exactly, was intended\nby those which he most frequently heard used: ’devilish pretty,’ ’blue\nblood,’ ’a cat and dog life,’ ’a day of reckoning,’ ’a queen of\nfashion, ’to give a free hand,’ ’to be at a deadlock,’ and so forth; and\nin what particular circumstances he himself might make use of them in\nconversation. Failing these, he would adorn it with puns and other ’plays\nupon words’ which he had learned by rote. As for the names of strangers\nwhich were uttered in his hearing, he used merely to repeat them to\nhimself in a questioning tone, which, he thought, would suffice to furnish\nhim with explanations for which he would not ostensibly seek.",
        "As the critical faculty, on the universal application of which he prided\nhimself, was, in reality, completely lacking, that refinement of good\nbreeding which consists in assuring some one whom you are obliging in any\nway, without expecting to be believed, that it is really yourself that is\nobliged to him, was wasted on Cottard, who took everything that he heard\nin its literal sense. However blind she may have been to his faults, Mme.\nVerdurin was genuinely annoyed, though she still continued to regard him\nas brilliantly clever, when, after she had invited him to see and hear\nSarah Bernhardt from a stage box, and had said politely: “It is very good\nof you to have come, Doctor, especially as I’m sure you must often have\nheard Sarah Bernhardt; and besides, I’m afraid we’re rather too near the\nstage,” the Doctor, who had come into the box with a smile which waited\nbefore settling upon or vanishing from his face until some one in\nauthority should enlighten him as to the merits of the spectacle, replied:\n“To be sure, we are far too near the stage, and one is getting sick of\nSarah Bernhardt. But you expressed a wish that I should come. For me, your\nwish is a command.  I am only too glad to be able to do you this little\nservice. What would one not do to please you, you are so good.” And he\nwent on, “Sarah Bernhardt; that’s what they call the Voice of God, ain’t\nit? You see, often, too, that she ’sets the boards on fire.’ That’s an odd\nexpression, ain’t it?” in the hope of an enlightening commentary, which,\nhowever, was not forthcoming.",
        "“D’you know,” Mme. Verdurin had said to her husband, “I believe we are\ngoing the wrong way to work when we depreciate anything we offer the\nDoctor. He is a scientist who lives quite apart from our everyday\nexistence; he knows nothing himself of what things are worth, and he\naccepts everything that we say as gospel.”",
        "“I never dared to mention it,” M. Verdurin had answered, “but I’ve noticed\nthe same thing myself.” And on the following New Year’s Day, instead of\nsending Dr. Cottard a ruby that cost three thousand francs, and pretending\nthat it was a mere trifle, M. Verdurin bought an artificial stone for\nthree hundred, and let it be understood that it was something almost\nimpossible to match.",
        "When Mme. Verdurin had announced that they were to see M. Swann that\nevening; “Swann!” the Doctor had exclaimed in a tone rendered brutal by\nhis astonishment, for the smallest piece of news would always take utterly\nunawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in readiness for\nanything. And seeing that no one answered him, “Swann! Who on earth is\nSwann?” he shouted, in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided as soon as Mme.\nVerdurin had explained, “Why, Odette’s friend, whom she told us about.”",
        "“Ah, good, good; that’s all right, then,” answered the Doctor, at once\nmollified. As for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of Swann’s\nappearing at the Verdurins’, because he supposed him to be in love with\nOdette, and was always ready to assist at lovers’ meetings. “Nothing\namuses me more than match-making,” he confided to Cottard; “I have been\ntremendously successful, even with women!”",
        "In telling the Verdurins that Swann was extremely ’smart,’ Odette had\nalarmed them with the prospect of another ’bore.’ When he arrived,\nhowever, he made an excellent impression, an indirect cause of which,\nthough they did not know it, was his familiarity with the best society. He\nhad, indeed, one of those advantages which men who have lived and moved in\nthe world enjoy over others, even men of intelligence and refinement, who\nhave never gone into society, namely that they no longer see it\ntransfigured by the longing or repulsion with which it fills the\nimagination, but regard it as quite unimportant. Their good nature, freed\nfrom all taint of snobbishness and from the fear of seeming too friendly,\ngrown independent, in fact, has the ease, the grace of movement of a\ntrained gymnast each of whose supple limbs will carry out precisely the\nmovement that is required without any clumsy participation by the rest of\nhis body. The simple and elementary gestures used by a man of the world\nwhen he courteously holds out his hand to the unknown youth who is being\nintroduced to him, and when he bows discreetly before the Ambassador to\nwhom he is being introduced, had gradually pervaded, without his being\nconscious of it, the whole of Swann’s social deportment, so that in the\ncompany of people of a lower grade than his own, such as the Verdurins and\ntheir friends, he instinctively shewed an assiduity, and made overtures\nwith which, by their account, any of their ’bores’ would have dispensed.\nHe chilled, though for a moment only, on meeting Dr. Cottard; for seeing\nhim close one eye with an ambiguous smile, before they had yet spoken to\none another (a grimace which Cottard styled “letting ’em all come”), Swann\nsupposed that the Doctor recognised him from having met him already\nsomewhere, probably in some house of ’ill-fame,’ though these he himself\nvery rarely visited, never having made a habit of indulging in the\nmercenary sort of love. Regarding such an allusion as in bad taste,\nespecially before Odette, whose opinion of himself it might easily alter\nfor the worse, Swann assumed his most icy manner. But when he learned that\nthe lady next to the Doctor was Mme. Cottard, he decided that so young a\nhusband would not deliberately, in his wife’s hearing, have made any\nallusion to amusements of that order, and so ceased to interpret the\nDoctor’s expression in the sense which he had at first suspected. The\npainter at once invited Swann to visit his studio with Odette, and Swann\nfound him very pleasant. “Perhaps you will be more highly favoured than I\nhave been,” Mme. Verdurin broke in, with mock resentment of the favour,\n“perhaps you will be allowed to see Cottard’s portrait” (for which she had\ngiven the painter a commission).  “Take care, Master Biche,” she reminded\nthe painter, whom it was a time-honoured pleasantry to address as\n’Master,’ “to catch that nice look in his eyes, that witty little twinkle.\nYou know, what I want to have most of all is his smile; that’s what I’ve\nasked you to paint–the portrait of his smile.” And since the phrase\nstruck her as noteworthy, she repeated it very loud, so as to make sure\nthat as many as possible of her guests should hear it, and even made use\nof some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer before she uttered it\nagain. Swann begged to be introduced to everyone, even to an old friend of\nthe Verdurins, called Saniette, whose shyness, simplicity and good-nature\nhad deprived him of all the consideration due to his skill in\npalaeography, his large fortune, and the distinguished family to which he\nbelonged. When he spoke, his words came with a confusion which was\ndelightful to hear because one felt that it indicated not so much a defect\nin his speech as a quality of his soul, as it were a survival from the age\nof innocence which he had never wholly outgrown. All the cop-sonants which\nhe did not manage to pronounce seemed like harsh utterances of which his\ngentle lips were incapable. By asking to be made known to M. Saniette,\nSwann made M. Verdurin reverse the usual form of introduction (saying, in\nfact, with emphasis on the distinction: “M. Swann, pray let me present to\nyou our friend Saniette”) but he aroused in Saniette himself a warmth of\ngratitude, which, however, the Verdurins never disclosed to Swann, since\nSaniette rather annoyed them, and they did not feel bound to provide him\nwith friends. On the other hand the Verdurins were extremely touched by\nSwann’s next request, for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the\npianist’s aunt. She wore a black dress, as was her invariable custom, for\nshe believed that a woman always looked well in black, and that nothing\ncould be more distinguished; but her face was exceedingly red, as it\nalways was for some time after a meal. She bowed to Swann with deference,\nbut drew herself up again with great dignity.  As she was entirely\nuneducated, and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar and\npronunciation, she used purposely to speak in an indistinct and garbling\nmanner, thinking that if she should make a slip it would be so buried in\nthe surrounding confusion that no one could be certain whether she had\nactually made it or not; with the result that her talk was a sort of\ncontinuous, blurred expectoration, out of which would emerge, at rare\nintervals, those sounds and syllables of which she felt positive. Swann\nsupposed himself entitled to poke a little mild fun at her in conversation\nwith M. Verdurin, who, however, was not at all amused.",
        "“She is such an excellent woman!” he rejoined. “I grant you that she is\nnot exactly brilliant; but I assure you that she can talk most charmingly\nwhen you are alone with her.”",
        "“I am sure she can,” Swann hastened to conciliate him. “All I meant was\nthat she hardly struck me as ’distinguished,’” he went on, isolating the\nepithet in the inverted commas of his tone, “and, after all, that is\nsomething of a compliment.”",
        "“Wait a moment,” said M. Verdurin, “now, this will surprise you; she\nwrites quite delightfully. You have never heard her nephew play? It is\nadmirable; eh, Doctor? Would you like me to ask him to play something, M.\nSwann?”",
        "“I should count myself most fortunate...” Swann was beginning, a trifle\npompously, when the Doctor broke in derisively. Having once heard it said,\nand never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis and the\nuse of formal expressions were out of date, whenever he heard a solemn\nword used seriously, as the word ’fortunate’ had been used just now by\nSwann, he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately\npedantic. And if, moreover, the same word happened to occur, also, in what\nhe called an old ’tag’ or ’saw,’ however common it might still be in\ncurrent usage, the Doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole thing\nwas a joke, and interrupted with the remaining words of the quotation,\nwhich he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended to introduce at\nthat point, although in reality it had never entered his mind.",
        "“Most fortunate for France!” he recited wickedly, shooting up both arms\nwith great vigour. M. Verdurin could not help laughing.",
        "“What are all those good people laughing at over there? There’s no sign of\nbrooding melancholy down in your corner,” shouted Mme. Verdurin.  “You\ndon’t suppose I find it very amusing to be stuck up here by myself on the\nstool of repentance,” she went on peevishly, like a spoiled child.",
        "Mme. Verdurin was sitting upon a high Swedish chair of waxed pine-wood,\nwhich a violinist from that country had given her, and which she kept in\nher drawing-room, although in appearance it suggested a school ’form,’ and\n’swore,’ as the saying is, at the really good antique furniture which she\nhad besides; but she made a point of keeping on view the presents which\nher ’faithful’ were in the habit of making her from time to time, so that\nthe donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there when they came to\nthe house. She tried to persuade them to confine their tributes to flowers\nand sweets, which had at least the merit of mortality; but she was never\nsuccessful, and the house was gradually filled with a collection of\nfoot-warmers, cushions, clocks, screens, barometers and vases, a constant\nrepetition and a boundless incongruity of useless but indestructible\nobjects.",
        "From this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the conversation\nof the ’faithful,’ and would revel in all their fun; but, since the\naccident to her jaw, she had abandoned the effort involved in real\nhilarity, and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumb-show which\nsignified, without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way, that she\nwas ’laughing until she cried.’ At the least witticism aimed by any of the\ncircle against a ’bore,’ or against a former member of the circle who was\nnow relegated to the limbo of ’bores’–and to the utter despair of M.\nVerdurin, who had always made out that he was just as easily amused as his\nwife, but who, since his laughter was the ’real thing,’ was out of breath\nin a moment, and so was overtaken and vanquished by her device of a\nfeigned but continuous hilarity–she would utter a shrill cry, shut tight\nher little bird-like eyes, which were beginning to be clouded over by a\ncataract, and quickly, as though she had only just time to avoid some\nindecent sight or to parry a mortal blow, burying her face in her hands,\nwhich completely engulfed it, and prevented her from seeing anything at\nall, she would appear to be struggling to suppress, to eradicate a laugh\nwhich, were she to give way to it, must inevitably leave her inanimate.\nSo, stupefied with the gaiety of the ’faithful,’ drunken with comradeship,\nscandal and asseveration, Mme.  Verdurin, perched on her high seat like a\ncage-bird whose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine, would sit aloft\nand sob with fellow-feeling.",
        "Meanwhile M. Verdurin, after first asking Swann’s permission to light his\npipe (\"No ceremony here, you understand; we’re all pals!”), went and\nbegged the young musician to sit down at the piano.",
        "“Leave him alone; don’t bother him; he hasn’t come here to be tormented,\"\ncried Mme. Verdurin. “I won’t have him tormented.”",
        "“But why on earth should it bother him?” rejoined M. Verdurin. “I’m sure\nM. Swann has never heard the sonata in F sharp which we discovered; he is\ngoing to play us the pianoforte arrangement.”",
        "“No, no, no, not my sonata!” she screamed, “I don’t want to be made to cry\nuntil I get a cold in the head, and neuralgia all down my face, like last\ntime; thanks very much, I don’t intend to repeat that performance; you are\nall very kind and considerate; it is easy to see that none of you will\nhave to stay in bed, for a week.”",
        "This little scene, which was re-enacted as often as the young pianist sat\ndown to play, never failed to delight the audience, as though each of them\nwere witnessing it for the first time, as a proof of the seductive\noriginality of the ’Mistress’ as she was styled, and of the acute\nsensitiveness of her musical ’ear.’ Those nearest to her would attract the\nattention of the rest, who were smoking or playing cards at the other end\nof the room, by their cries of ’Hear, hear!’ which, as in Parliamentary\ndebates, shewed that something worth listening to was being said. And next\nday they would commiserate with those who had been prevented from coming\nthat evening, and would assure them that the ’little scene’ had never been\nso amusingly done.",
        "“Well, all right, then,” said M. Verdurin, “he can play just the andante.”",
        "“Just the andante! How you do go on,” cried his wife. “As if it weren’t\n’just the andante’ that breaks every bone in my body. The ’Master’ is\nreally too priceless! Just as though, ’in the Ninth,’ he said ’we need\nonly have the finale,’ or ’just the overture’ of the Meistersinger.”",
        "The Doctor, however, urged Mme. Verdurin to let the pianist play, not\nbecause he supposed her to be malingering when she spoke of the\ndistressing effects that music always had upon her, for he recognised the\nexistence of certain neurasthenic states–but from his habit, common to\nmany doctors, of at once relaxing the strict letter of a prescription as\nsoon as it appeared to jeopardise, what seemed to him far more important,\nthe success of some social gathering at which he was present, and of which\nthe patient whom he had urged for once to forget her dyspepsia or headache\nformed an essential factor.",
        "“You won’t be ill this time, you’ll find,” he told her, seeking at the\nsame time to subdue her mind by the magnetism of his gaze. “And, if you\nare ill, we will cure you.”",
        "“Will you, really?” Mme. Verdurin spoke as though, with so great a favour\nin store for her, there was nothing for it but to capitulate. Perhaps,\ntoo, by dint of saying that she was going to be ill, she had worked\nherself into a state in which she forgot, occasionally, that it was all\nonly a ’little scene,’ and regarded things, quite sincerely, from an\ninvalid’s point of view.  For it may often be remarked that invalids grow\nweary of having the frequency of their attacks depend always on their own\nprudence in avoiding them, and like to let themselves think that they are\nfree to do everything that they most enjoy doing, although they are always\nill after doing it, provided only that they place themselves in the hands\nof a higher authority which, without putting them to the least\ninconvenience, can and will, by uttering a word or by administering a\ntabloid, set them once again upon their feet.",
        "Odette had gone to sit on a tapestry-covered sofa near the piano, saying\nto Mme. Verdurin, “I have my own little corner, haven’t I?”",
        "And Mme. Verdurin, seeing Swann by himself upon a chair, made him get up.\n“You’re not at all comfortable there; go along and sit by Odette; you can\nmake room for M. Swann there, can’t you, Odette?”",
        "“What charming Beauvais!” said Swann, stopping to admire the sofa before\nhe sat down on it, and wishing to be polite.",
        "“I am glad you appreciate my sofa,” replied Mme. Verdurin, “and I warn you\nthat if you expect ever to see another like it you may as well abandon the\nidea at once. They never made any more like it. And these little chairs,\ntoo, are perfect marvels. You can look at them in a moment.  The emblems\nin each of the bronze mouldings correspond to the subject of the tapestry\non the chair; you know, you combine amusement with instruction when you\nlook at them;–I can promise you a delightful time, I assure you. Just\nlook at the little border around the edges; here, look, the little vine on\na red background in this one, the Bear and the Grapes. Isn’t it well\ndrawn? What do you say? I think they knew a thing or two about design!\nDoesn’t it make your mouth water, this vine? My husband makes out that I\nam not fond of fruit, because I eat less than he does. But not a bit of\nit, I am greedier than any of you, but I have no need to fill my mouth\nwith them when I can feed on them with my eyes.  What are you all laughing\nat now, pray? Ask the Doctor; he will tell you that those grapes act on me\nlike a regular purge. Some people go to Fontainebleau for cures; I take my\nown little Beauvais cure here. But, M. Swann, you mustn’t run away without\nfeeling the little bronze mouldings on the backs. Isn’t it an exquisite\nsurface? No, no, not with your whole hand like that; feel them property!”",
        "“If Mme. Verdurin is going to start playing about with her bronzes,” said\nthe painter, “we shan’t get any music to-night.”",
        "“Be quiet, you wretch! And yet we poor women,” she went on, “are forbidden\npleasures far less voluptuous than this. There is no flesh in the world as\nsoft as these. None. When M. Verdurin did me the honour of being madly\njealous... come, you might at least be polite. Don’t say that you never\nhave been jealous!”",
        "“But, my dear, I have said absolutely nothing. Look here, Doctor, I call\nyou as a witness; did I utter a word?”",
        "Swann had begun, out of politeness, to finger the bronzes, and did not\nlike to stop.",
        "“Come along; you can caress them later; now it is you that are going to be\ncaressed, caressed in the ear; you’ll like that, I think. Here’s the young\ngentleman who will take charge of that.”",
        "After the pianist had played, Swann felt and shewed more interest in him\nthan in any of the other guests, for the following reason:",
        "The year before, at an evening party, he had heard a piece of music played\non the piano and violin. At first he had appreciated only the material\nquality of the sounds which those instruments secreted. And it had been a\nsource of keen pleasure when, below the narrow ribbon of the violin-part,\ndelicate, unyielding, substantial and governing the whole, he had suddenly\nperceived, where it was trying to surge upwards in a flowing tide of\nsound, the mass of the piano-part, multiform, coherent, level, and\nbreaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of the sea,\nsilvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight. But at a given\nmoment, without being able to distinguish any clear outline, or to give a\nname to what was pleasing him, suddenly enraptured, he had tried to\ncollect, to treasure in his memory the phrase or harmony–he knew not\nwhich–that had just been played, and had opened and expanded his soul,\njust as the fragrance of certain roses, wafted upon the moist air of\nevening, has the power of dilating our nostrils. Perhaps it was owing to\nhis own ignorance of music that he had been able to receive so confused an\nimpression, one of those that are, notwithstanding, our only purely\nmusical impressions, limited in their extent, entirely original, and\nirreducible into any other kind. An impression of this order, vanishing in\nan instant, is, so to speak, an impression sine materia. Presumably the\nnotes which we hear at such moments tend to spread out before our eyes,\nover surfaces greater or smaller according to their pitch and volume; to\ntrace arabesque designs, to give us the sensation of breath or tenuity,\nstability or caprice. But the notes themselves have vanished before these\nsensations have developed sufficiently to escape submersion under those\nwhich the following, or even simultaneous notes have already begun to\nawaken in us. And this indefinite perception would continue to smother in\nits molten liquidity the motifs which now and then emerge, barely\ndiscernible, to plunge again and disappear and drown; recognised only by\nthe particular kind of pleasure which they instil, impossible to describe,\nto recollect, to name; ineffable;–if our memory, like a labourer who\ntoils at the laying down of firm foundations beneath the tumult of the\nwaves, did not, by fashioning for us facsimiles of those fugitive phrases,\nenable us to compare and to contrast them with those that follow. And so,\nhardly had the delicious sensation, which Swann had experienced, died\naway, before his memory had furnished him with an immediate transcript,\nsummary, it is true, and provisional, but one on which he had kept his\neyes fixed while the playing continued, so effectively that, when the same\nimpression suddenly returned, it was no longer uncapturable. He was able\nto picture to himself its extent, its symmetrical arrangement, its\nnotation, the strength of its expression; he had before him that definite\nobject which was no longer pure music, but rather design, architecture,\nthought, and which allowed the actual music to be recalled. This time he\nhad distinguished, quite clearly, a phrase which emerged for a few moments\nfrom the waves of sound. It had at once held out to him an invitation to\npartake of intimate pleasures, of whose existence, before hearing it, he\nhad never dreamed, into which he felt that nothing but this phrase could\ninitiate him; and he had been filled with love for it, as with a new and\nstrange desire.",
        "With a slow and rhythmical movement it led him here, there, everywhere,\ntowards a state of happiness noble, unintelligible, yet clearly indicated.\nAnd then, suddenly having reached a certain point from which he was\nprepared to follow it, after pausing for a moment, abruptly it changed its\ndirection, and in a fresh movement, more rapid, multiform, melancholy,\nincessant, sweet, it bore him off with it towards a vista of joys\nunknown.  Then it vanished. He hoped, with a passionate longing, that he\nmight find it again, a third time. And reappear it did, though without\nspeaking to him more clearly, bringing him, indeed, a pleasure less\nprofound. But when he was once more at home he needed it, he was like a\nman into whose life a woman, whom he has seen for a moment passing by, has\nbrought a new form of beauty, which strengthens and enlarges his own power\nof perception, without his knowing even whether he is ever to see her\nagain whom he loves already, although he knows nothing of her, not even\nher name.",
