        "Mr. H. G. Wells, in his “Outline of History,” was of necessity forced\nto omit the narration of many of the chief events in the history\nof these United States.  Such omissions I have in this brief\nvolume endeavored to supply.  And as American history can\npossibly best be written by Americans and as we have among us no\nH. G. Wells, I have imagined an American history as written\nconjointly by a group of our most characteristic literary figures.",
        "Apologies are due the various authors whose style and, more\nparticularly, whose Weltanschauung I have here attempted to\nreproduce; thanks are due The Bookman for permission to reprint\nsuch of these chapters as appeared in that publication. I give\nboth freely.   D. O. S.",
