        "Burnham Thorpe, the native village of the great Admiral Nelson, is\nwithin walking distance of either Holkham, Burnham Market, or\nWells-next-the-Sea. Horatio Nelson, the fourth son of Edmund and\nCatherine Nelson, was born on September 29, 1758, at the Parsonage\nHouse, which has unfortunately been pulled down. There are, however,\nmany interesting relics of Nelson in the village church, and it is\ninteresting to see the surroundings among which Nelson’s childhood was\npassed. In the parish register may be seen the signature of Nelson as a\nwitness to a marriage in the year 1769, when he was eleven years old.\nThere is a lectern constructed from the wood of the old Victory, which\nwas presented by the Lords of the Admiralty in 1881. The old Purbeck\nmarble font in which Horatio was baptized is still to be seen in the\nchurch. How much Nelson loved his native village can be understood from\nhis remark as the Victory was going into action, “This is the happiest\nday of my life; what a happy day, too, for Burnham Thorpe, for it is the\nday of their fair.”",
        "Nelson’s father was not by any means well off, and the question of\nproviding for his sons was a very serious one. Horatio, however, solved\nthe question as to his own career. At the Grammar School at Norwich,\nNelson said to his brother, “Do, William, write to my father and tell\nhim that I should like to go to sea with Uncle Maurice.” Captain Maurice\nSuckling is said to have heard of Horatio’s decision with some surprise,\nfor he said, “What has poor Horatio done, who is so weak, that he, above\nall the rest, should be sent to rough it out at sea? But let him come,\nand the first time we go into action a cannon-ball may knock off his\nhead and provide for him at once.”",
        "In January 1771, when at school at North Walsham, Nelson heard that he\nwas to join the Raisonnable, of 64 guns, at Chatham. He was then only\ntwelve years old.",
