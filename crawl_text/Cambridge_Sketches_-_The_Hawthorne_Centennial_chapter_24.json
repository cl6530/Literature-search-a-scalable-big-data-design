        "When the “Marble Faun” was first published the art criticism in it,\nespecially of sculptors and painters who were then living, created a deal\nof discussion, which has been revived again by the recent centennial\ncelebration. Hawthorne himself was the most perfect artist of his time as\na man of letters, and the judgment of such a person ought to have its\nvalue, even when it relates to subjects which are beyond the customary\nsphere of his investigations, and for which he has not made a serious\npreparation. In spite of the adage, “every man to his own trade,” it may\nbe fairly asserted that much of Hawthorne’s art criticism takes rank\namong the finest that has been written in any language. On the other\nhand, there are instances, as might be expected, in which he has failed\nto hit the mark.",
        "These latter may be placed in two classes: Firstly, those in which he\nindicates a partiality for personal acquaintances; and secondly, those in\nwhich he has followed popular opinion at the time, or the opinion of\nothers, without sufficient consideration.",
        "American society in Rome is always split up into various cliques,—which\nis not surprising in view of the adventitious manner in which it comes\ntogether there,—and in Hawthorne’s time the two leading parties were the\nStory and the Crawford factions. The latter was a man of true genius, and\nnot only the best of American sculptors, but perhaps the greatest\nsculptor of the nineteenth century. His statue of Beethoven is in the\ngrand manner, and instinct with harmony, not only in attitude and\nexpression, but even to the arrangement of the drapery. Crawford’s genius\nwas only too well appreciated, and he was constantly carrying off the\nprizes of his art from all competitors. Consequently it was inevitable\nthat other sculptors should be jealous of him, and should unite together\nfor mutual protection. Story was a man of talent, and not a little of an\namateur, but he was the gentlemanly entertainer of those Americans who\ncame to the city with good letters of introduction. Hawthorne evidently\nfell into Story’s hands. He speaks slightingly of Crawford, and praises\nStory’s statue of Cleopatra in unqualified terms; and yet there seems to\nhave been an undercurrent of suspicion in his mind, for he says more than\nonce in the “Marble Faun” that it would appear to be a failing with\nsculptors to speak unfavorably of the work of other sculptors, and this,\nof course, refers to those with whom he was acquainted, and whom he\nsometimes rated above their value.",
        "Warrington Wood, the best English sculptor of thirty years ago, praised\nStory’s “Cleopatra” to me, and I believe that Crawford also would have\npraised it. Neither has Hawthorne valued its expression too highly—the\nexpression of worldly splendor incarnated in a beautiful woman on the\ntragical verge of an abyss. If she only were beautiful! Here the\nlimitations of the statue commence. Hawthorne says: “The sculptor had not\nshunned to give the full, Nubian lips, and other characteristics of the\nEgyptian physiognomy.” Here he follows the sculptor himself, and it is\nremarkable that a college graduate like William Story should have made so\ntransparent a mistake. Cleopatra was not an Egyptian at all. The\nPtolemies were Greeks, and it is simply impossible to believe that they\nwould have allied themselves with a subject and alien race. This kind of\nsmall pedantry has often led artists astray, and was peculiarly virulent\nduring the middle of the last century. The whole figure of Story’s\n“Cleopatra” suffers from it. He says again: “She was draped from head to\nfoot in a costume minutely and scrupulously studied from that of ancient\nEgypt.” In fact, the body and limbs of the statue are so closely shrouded\nas to deprive the work of that sense of freedom of action and royal\nabandon which greets us in Shakespeare’s and Plutarch’s “Cleopatra.\"\nStory might have taken a lesson from Titian’s matchless “Cleopatra\"\nin the Cassel Gallery, or from Marc Antonio’s small woodcut of\nRaphael’s “Cleopatra.”",
        "Hawthorne was an idealist, and he idealized the materials in Story’s\nstudio, for literary purposes, just as Shakespeare idealized Henry V.,\nwho was not a magnanimous monarch at all, but a brutal, narrow-minded\nfighter. The discourse on art, which he develops in this manner, forms\none of the most valuable chapters in the “Marble Faun.” It assists us in\nreading it to remember that Story was not the model for Hawthorne’s\n“Kenyon,” but a very different character. The passage in which he\ncriticises the methods of modern sculptors has often been quoted in later\nwritings on that subject; and I suppose the whole brotherhood of artists\nwould rise up against me if I were to support Hawthorne’s condemnation of\nnude Venuses and “the guilty glimpses stolen at hired models.”",
        "They are not necessarily guilty glimpses. To an experienced artist the\ncustomary study from a naked figure, male or female, is little more than\nwhat a low-necked dress would be to others. Yet the instinct of the age\nshrinks from this exposure. We can make pretty good Venuses, but we\ncannot look at them through the same mental and moral atmosphere as the\ncotemporaries of Scopas, or even with the same eyes that Michael Angelo\ndid. We feel the difference between a modern Venus and an ancient one.\nThere is a statue in the Vatican of a Roman emperor, of which every one\nsays that it ought to wear clothes; and the reason is because the face\nhas such a modern look. A raving Bacchante may be a good acquisition to\nan art museum, but it is out of place in a public library. A female\nstatue requires more or less drapery to set off the outlines of the\nfigure and to give it dignity. We feel this even in the finest Greek\nwork—like the Venus of Cnidos.",
        "In this matter Hawthorne certainly exposes his Puritanic education, and\nhe also places too high a value on the carving of buttonholes and\nshoestrings by Italian workmen. Such things are the fag-ends of statuary.",
        "His judgment, however, is clear and convincing in regard to the tinted\nEves and Venuses of Gibson. Whatever may have been the ancient practice\nin this respect, Gibson’s experiment proved a failure. Nobody likes those\nstatues; and no other sculptor has since followed Gibson’s example.",
        "Hawthorne overestimates the Apollo Belvidere, as all the world did at\nthat time; but his single remark concerning Canova is full of\nsignificance: “In these precincts which Canova’s genius was not quite of\na character to render sacred, though it certainly made them interesting,\"\netc.",
        "He goes to the statue gallery in the Vatican and returns with a feeling\nof dissatisfaction, and justly so, for the vast majority of statues there\nare merely copies, and many of them very bad copies. He recognizes the\nLaocoon for what it really is, the abstract type of a Greek tragedy. He\nnotices what has since been proved by severe archaeological study, that\nmost of the possible types and attitudes of marble statues had been\nexhausted by the Greeks long before the Christian era. Miss Hosmer’s\nZenobia was originally a Ceres, and even Crawford’s Orpheus strongly\nresembles a figure in the Niobe group at Florence.",
        "But Hawthorne’s description of the Faun of Praxiteles stands by itself.\nAs a penetrative analysis of a great sculptor’s motive it is unequalled\nby any modern writer on art, and this is set forth with a grace and\ndelicacy worthy of Praxiteles himself. The only criticism which one feels\ninclined to make of it is that it too Hawthornish, too modern and\nelaborate; but is not this equally true of all modern criticism? We\ncannot return to the simplicity of the Greeks any more than we can to\ntheir customs. If Hawthorne would seem to discover too much in this\nstatue, which is really a poor Roman copy, he has himself given us an\nanswer to this objection. In Volume II., Chapter XII., he says: “Let the\ncanvas glow as it may, you must look with the eye of faith, or its\nhighest excellence escapes you. There is always the necessity of helping\nout the painter’s art with your own resources of sensibility and\nimagination.” His cursory remarks on Raphael are not less pertinent and\npenetrating. Of technicalities he knew little, but no one, perhaps, has\nsounded such depths of that clairvoyant master’s nature, and so brought\nto light the very soul of him.",
        "The “Marble Faun” may not be the most perfect of Hawthorne’s works, but\nit is much the greatest,—an epic romance, which can only be compared\nwith Goethe’s “Wilhelm Meister.”",
