        "  “A traveler passed down the Jericho road,\n  He carried of cash a pretty fair load\n  (The savings of many a toilsome day),\n  On his Jericho home a mortgage to pay.",
        "  “At a turn of the road, in a lonely place,\n  Two villainous men met him face to face.\n  ’Hands up!’ they cried, and they beat him sore,\n  Then off to the desert his money they bore.",
        "  “Soon a priest came by who had a fold;\n  He sheared his sheep of silver and gold.\n  He saw the man lie bruised and bare,\n  But he passed on by to his place of prayer.",
        "  “Then a Levite, temple bound, drew nigh;\n  He saw the man, but let him lie,\n  And clad in silk, and filled with pride,\n  He passed him by on the other side.",
        "  “Next on the way a Samaritan came\n  (To priest and Levite a hated name);\n  The wounded man he would not pass,\n  He tenderly placed him on his ass.",
        "  “He took him to an inn hard by;\n  He dressed his wounds and bathed his eye;\n  He paid the landlord his full score;\n  If more was needed would pay him more.",
        "  “Ah! many travel the Jericho way,\n  And many are robbed and beaten each day;\n  And many there be on the way in need,\n  Whom Priest or Levite never heed;\n  And who to fate would yield, alas!\n  If some Samaritan did not pass.”",
