        "Nachmanides was one of the earliest writers to effect a reconciliation\nbetween the French and the Spanish schools of Jewish literature. On the\none side, his Spanish birth and training made him a friend of the widest\nculture; on the other, he was possessed of the French devotion to the\nTalmud. Moses, the son of Nachman (Nachmanides, Ramban, 1195-1270),\nSpaniard though he was, says, “The French Rabbis have won most Jews to\ntheir view. They are our masters in Talmud, and to them we must go for\ninstruction.” From the eleventh to the fourteenth century, a French\nschool of Talmudists occupied themselves with the elucidation of the\nTalmud, and from the “Additions” (Tossafoth) which they compiled they\nare known as Tossafists. The Tossafists were animated with an altogether\ndifferent spirit from that of the Spanish writers on the Talmud. But\nthough their method is very involved and over-ingenious, they display so\nmuch mastery of the Talmud, such excellent discrimination, and so keen a\ncritical insight, that they well earned the fame they have enjoyed. The\nearliest Tossafists were the family and pupils of Rashi, but the method\nspread from Northern France to Provence, and thence to Spain. The most\nfamous Tossafists were Isaac, the son of Asher of Speyer (end of the\neleventh century); Tam of Rameru (Rashi’s grandson); Isaac the Elder of\nDompaire (Tam’s nephew); Baruch of Ratisbon; and Perez of Corbeil.",
        "Nachmanides’ admiration for the French method–a method by no means\nrestricted to the Tossafists–did not blind him to its defects. “They\ntry to force an elephant through the eye of a needle,” he sarcastically\nsaid of some of the French casuists. Nachmanides thus possessed some of\nthe independence characteristic of the Spanish Jews. He also shared the\npoetic spirit of Spain, and his hymn for the Day of Atonement is one of\nthe finest products of the new-Hebrew muse. The last stanzas run thus:",
        "    Thine is the love, O God, and thine the grace,\n    That holds the sinner in its mild embrace;\n    Thine the forgiveness, bridging o’er the space\n      ’Twixt man’s works and the task set by the King.",
        "    Unheeding all my sins, I cling to thee!\n    I know that mercy shall thy footstool be:\n    Before I call, O do thou answer me,\n      For nothing dare I claim of thee, my King!",
        "    O thou, who makest guilt to disappear,\n    My help, my hope, my rock, I will not fear;\n    Though thou the body hold in dungeon drear,\n      The soul has found the palace of the King!",
        "Everything that Nachmanides wrote is warm with tender love. He was an\nenthusiast in many directions. His heart went out to the French\nTalmudists, yet he cherished so genuine an affection for Maimonides that\nhe defended him with spirit against his detractors. Gentle by nature, he\nbroke forth into fiery indignation against the French critics of\nMaimonides. At the same time his tender soul was attracted by the\nemotionalism of the Kabbala, or mystical view of life, a view equally\nopposed to the views of Maimonides and of the French school. He tried to\nact the part of reconciler, but his intellect, strong as it was, was too\nmuch at the mercy of his emotions for him to win a commanding place in\nthe controversies of his time.",
        "For a moment we may turn aside from his books to the incidents of his\nlife. Like Maimonides, he was a physician by profession and a Rabbi by\nway of leisure. The most momentous incident in his career in Barcelona\nwas his involuntary participation in a public dispute with a convert\nfrom the Synagogue. Pablo Christiani burned with the desire to convert\nthe Jews en masse to Christianity, and in 1263 he induced King Jayme I\nof Aragon to summon Nachmanides to a controversy on the truth of\nChristianity. Nachmanides complied with the royal command most\nreluctantly. He felt that the process of rousing theological animosity\nby a public discussion could only end in a religious persecution.\nHowever, he had no alternative but to assent. He stipulated for complete\nfreedom of speech. This was granted, but when Nachmanides published his\nversion of the discussion, the Dominicans were incensed. True, the\nspecial commission appointed to examine the charge of blasphemy brought\nagainst Nachmanides reported that he had merely availed himself of the\nright of free speech which had been guaranteed to him. He was\nnevertheless sentenced to exile, and his pamphlet was burnt. Nachmanides\nwas seventy years of age at the time. He settled in Palestine, where he\ndied in about 1270, amid a band of devoted friends and disciples, who\ndid not, however, reconcile him to the separation from his Spanish home.\n“I left my family,” he wrote, “I forsook my house. There, with my sons\nand daughters, the sweet, dear children whom I brought up on my knees, I\nleft also my soul My heart and my eyes will dwell with them forever.”",
        "The Halachic, or Talmudical, works of Nachmanides have already been\nmentioned. His homiletical, or exegetical, writings are of more literary\nimportance. In “The Sacred Letter” he contended that man’s earthly\nnature is divine no less than his soul, and he vindicates the “flesh\"\nfrom the attacks made on human character by certain forms of\nChristianity. The body, according to Nachmanides, is, with all its\nfunctions, the work of God, and therefore perfect. “It is only sin and\nneglect that disfigure God’s creatures.” In another of his books, “The\nLaw of Man,” Nachmanides writes of suffering and death. He offers an\nantidote to pessimism, for he boldly asserts that pain and suffering in\nthemselves are “a service of God, leading man to ponder on his end and\nreflect about his destiny.” Nachmanides believed in the bodily\nresurrection, but held that the soul was in a special sense a direct\nemanation from God. He was not a philosopher strictly so-called; he was\na mystic more than a thinker, one to whom God was an intuition, not a\nconcept of reason.",
        "The greatest work of Nachmanides was his “Commentary on the Pentateuch.\"\nHe reveals his whole character in it. In composing his work he had, he\ntells us, three motives, an intellectual, a theological, and an\nemotional motive. First, he would “satisfy the minds of students, and\ndraw their heart out by a critical examination of the text.” His\nexposition is, indeed, based on true philology and on deep and original\nstudy of the Bible. His style is peculiarly attractive, and had he been\ncontent to offer a plain commentary, his work would have ranked among\nthe best. But he had other desires besides giving a simple explanation\nof the text. He had, secondly, a theological motive, to justify God and\ndiscover in the words of Scripture a hidden meaning. In the Biblical\nnarratives, Nachmanides sees types of the history of man. Thus, the\naccount of the six days of creation is turned into a prophecy of the\nevents which would occur during the next six thousand years, and the\nseventh day is a type of the millennium. So, too, Nachmanides finds\nsymbolical senses in Scriptural texts, “for, in the Torah, are hidden\nevery wonder and every mystery, and in her treasures is sealed every\nbeauty of wisdom.” Finally, Nachmanides wrote, not only for educational\nand theological ends, but also for edification. His third purpose was\n“to bring peace to the minds of students (laboring under persecution\nand trouble), when they read the portion of the Pentateuch on Sabbaths\nand festivals, and to attract their hearts by simple explanations and\nsweet words.” His own enthusiastic and loving temperament speaks in this\npart of his commentary. It is true, as Graetz says, that Nachmanides\nexercised more influence on his contemporaries and on succeeding ages by\nhis personality than by his writings. But it must be added that the\nwritings of Nachmanides are his personality.",
