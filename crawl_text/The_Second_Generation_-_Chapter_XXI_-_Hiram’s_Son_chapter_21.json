        "In Hiram Ranger’s last year the Ranger-Whitney Company made half a\nmillion; the first year under the trustees there was a small deficit.\nCharles Whitney was most apologetic to his fellow trustees who had given\nhim full control because he owned just under half the stock and was the\nbusiness man of the three. “I’ve relied wholly on Howells,” explained he.\n“I knew Ranger had the highest opinion of his ability, but evidently he’s\none of those chaps who are good only as lieutenants. However, there’s no\nexcuse for me–none. During the coming year I’ll try to make up for my\nnegligence. I’ll give the business my personal attention.”",
        "But at the end of the second year the books showed that, while the\ncompany had never done so much business, there was a loss of half a\nmillion; another such year and the surplus would be exhausted. At the\ntrustees’ meeting, of the three faces staring gloomily at these ruinous\nfigures the gloomiest was Charles Whitney’s. “There can be only one\nexplanation,” said he. “The shifting of the centers of production is\nmaking it increasingly difficult to manufacture here at a profit.”",
        "“Perhaps the railways are discriminating against us,” suggested\nScarborough.",
        "Whitney smiled slightly. “That’s your reform politics,” said he. “You\nfellows never seek the natural causes for things; you at once accuse the\nfinanciers.”",
        "Scarborough smiled back at him. “But haven’t there been instances of\nrings in control of railways using their power for plants they were\ninterested in and against competing plants?”",
        "“Possibly–to a limited extent,” conceded Whitney. “But I hold to the\nold-fashioned idea. My dear sir, this is a land of opportunity–”",
        "“Still, Whitney,” interrupted Dr. Hargrave, “there may be something in\nwhat Senator Scarborough says.”",
        "“Undoubtedly,” Whitney hastened to answer. “I only hope there is. Then\nour problem will be simple. I’ll set my lawyers to work at once. If that\nis the cause\"–he struck the table resolutely with his clenched\nfist–\"the scoundrels shall be brought to book!”",
        "His eyes shifted as he lifted them to find Scarborough looking at him.\n“You have inside connections with the Chicago railway crowd, have you\nnot, Mr. Whitney?” he inquired.",
        "“I think I have,” said Whitney, with easy candor. “That’s why I feel\nconfident your suggestion has no foundation–beyond your suspicion of all\nmen engaged in large enterprises. It’s a wonder you don’t suspect me.\nIndeed, you probably will.”",
        "He spoke laughingly. Scarborough’s answer was a grave smile.",
        "“My personal loss may save me from you,” Whitney went on. “I hesitate to\nspeak of it, but, as you can see, it is large–almost as large as the\nuniversity’s.”",
        "“Yes,” said Scarborough absently, though his gaze was still fixed on\nWhitney. “You think you can do nothing?”",
        "“Indeed I do not!” exclaimed Whitney. “I shall begin with the assumption\nthat you are right. And if you are, I’ll have those scoundrels in court\nwithin a month.”",
        "“And then?”",
        "The young senator’s expression and tone were calm, but Whitney seemed to\nfind covert hostility in them. “Then–justice!” he replied angrily.",
        "Dr. Hargrave beamed benevolent confidence. “Justice!” he echoed. “Thank\nGod for our courts!”",
        "“But when?” said Scarborough. As there was no answer, he went on: “In\nfive–ten–fifteen–perhaps twenty years. The lawyers are in no hurry–a\nbrief case means a small fee. The judges–they’ve got their places for\nlife, so there’s no reason why they should muss their silk gowns in\nundignified haste. Besides–It seems to me I’ve heard somewhere the\nphrase ’railway judges.’”",
        "Dr. Hargrave looked gentle but strong disapproval. “You are too\npessimistic, Hampden,” said he.",
        "“The senator should not let the wounds from his political fights\ngangrene,” suggested Whitney, with good-humored raillery.",
        "“Have you nothing but the court remedy to offer?” asked Scarborough, a\nslight smile on his handsome face, so deceptively youthful.",
        "“That’s quite enough,” answered Whitney. “In my own affairs I’ve never\nappealed to the courts in vain.”",
        "“I can believe it,” said Scarborough, and Whitney looked as if he had\nscented sarcasm, though Scarborough was correctly colorless. “But, if you\nshould be unable to discover any grounds for a case against the\nrailways?”",
        "“Then all we can do is to work harder than ever along the old lines–cut\ndown expenses, readjust wages, stop waste.” Whitney sneered politely.\n“But no doubt you have some other plan to propose.”",
        "Scarborough continued to look at him with the same faint smile. “I’ve\nnothing to suggest–to-day,” said he. “The court proceedings will do no\nharm–you see, Mr. Whitney, I can’t get my wicked suspicion of your\nfriends out of my mind. But we must also try something less–less\nleisurely than courts. I’ll think it over.”",
        "Whitney laughed rather uncomfortably; and when they adjourned he lingered\nwith Dr. Hargrave. “We must not let ourselves be carried away by our\nyoung friend’s suspicions,” said he to his old friend. “Scarborough is a\nfine fellow. But he lacks your experience and my knowledge of practical\nbusiness. And he has been made something of a crank by combating the\nopposition his extreme views have aroused among conservative people.”",
        "“You are mistaken, Whitney,” replied the doctor. “Hampden’s views are\nsound. He is misrepresented by the highly placed rascals he has exposed\nand dislodged. But in these business matters we rely upon you.” He linked\nhis arm affectionately in that of the powerful and successful “captain of\nindustry” whom he had known from boyhood. “I know how devoted you are to\nTecumseh, and how ably you manage practical affairs; and I have not for a\nmoment lost confidence that you will bring us safely through.”",
        "Whitney’s face was interesting. There was a certain hangdog look in it,\nbut there was also a suggestion–very covert–of cynical amusement, as of\na good player’s jeer at a blunder by his opponent. His tone, however, was\nmelancholy, tinged with just resentment, as he said: “Scarborough forgets\nhow my own personal interest is involved. I don’t like to lose two\nhundred and odd thousand a year.”",
        "“Scarborough meant nothing, I’m sure,” said Hargrave soothingly. “He\nknows we are all single hearted for the university.”",
        "“I don’t like to be distrusted,” persisted Whitney sadly. Then\nbrightening: “But you and I understand each other, doctor. And we will\ncarry the business through. Every man who tries to do anything in this\nworld must expect to be misunderstood.”",
        "“You are mistaken about Scarborough, I know you are,” said Hargrave\nearnestly.",
        "Whitney listened to Hargrave, finally professed to be reassured; but,\nbefore he left, a strong doubt of Scarborough’s judgment had been\nimplanted by him in the mind of the old doctor. That was easy enough;\nfor, while Hargrave was too acute a man to give his trust impulsively, he\ngave without reserve when he did give–and he believed in Charles\nWhitney. The ability absolutely to trust where trust is necessary is as\nessential to effective character as is the ability to withhold trust\nuntil its wisdom has been justified; and exceptions only confirm a rule.",
        "Scarborough, feeling that he had been neglecting his trusteeship, now\ndevoted himself to the Ranger-Whitney Company.",
        "He had long consultations with Howells, and studied the daily and weekly\nbalance sheets which Howells sent him. In the second month after the\nannual meeting he cabled Dory to come home. The entire foundation upon\nwhich Dory was building seemed to be going; Saint X was, therefore, the\nplace for him, not Europe.",
        "“And there you have all I have been able to find out,” concluded\nScarborough, when he had given Dory the last of the facts and figures.\n“What do you make of it?”",
        "“There’s something wrong–something rotten,” replied Dory.",
        "“But where?” inquired Scarborough, who had taken care not to speak or\nhint his vague doubts of Whitney. “Everything looks all right, except\nthe totals on the balance sheets.”",
        "“We must talk this over with some one who knows more about the business\nthan either of us.” Then he added, as if the idea had just come to him,\n“Why not call in Arthur–Arthur Ranger?”",
        "Scarborough looked receptive, but not enthusiastic.",
        "“He has been studying this business in the most practical way ever since\nhis father died,” urged Dory. “It can’t do any harm to consult with him.\nWe don’t want to call in outside experts if we can help it.”",
        "“If we did we’d have to let Mr. Whitney select them,” said Scarborough.\nAnd he drew Dory out upon the subject of Arthur and got such complete and\nintelligent answers that he presently had a wholly new and true idea of\nthe young man whose boyish follies Saint X had not yet forgotten. “Yes,\nlet’s give Arthur a chance,” he finally said.",
        "Accordingly, they laid the case in its entirety before Arthur, and he\ntook home with him the mass of reports which Scarborough had gathered.\nNight after night he and Madelene worked at the problem; for both knew\nthat its solution would be his opportunity, their opportunity.",
        "It was Madelene who discovered the truth–not by searching the figures,\nnot by any process of surface reasoning, but by that instinct for motive\nwhich woman has developed through her ages of dealing with and in\nmotives only. “They must get a new management,” said she; “one that\nCharles Whitney has no control over.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Because he’s wrecking the business to get hold of it. He wants the whole\nthing, and he couldn’t resist the chance the inexperience and confidence\nof the other two gave him.”",
        "“I see no indication of it,” objected Arthur, to draw her out. “On the\ncontrary, wherever he directly controls there’s a good showing.”",
        "“That’s it!” exclaimed Madelene, feeling that she now had her feet on\nthe firm ground of reason on which alone stupid men will discuss\npractical affairs.",
        "Arthur had lived with Madelene long enough to learn that her mind was\nindeed as clear as her eyes, that when she looked at anything she saw it\nas it was, and saw all of it. Like any man who has the right material in\nhim, he needed only the object lesson of her quick dexterity at stripping\na problem of its shell of nonessentials. He had become what the\nineffective call a pessimist. He had learned the primer lesson of large\nsuccess–that one must build upon the hard, pessimistic facts of human\nnature’s instability and fate’s fondness for mischief, not upon the\noptimistic clouds of belief that everybody is good and faithful and\nfriendly disposed and everything will “come out all right somehow.” The\ninstant Madelene suggested Whitney as the cause, Arthur’s judgment echoed\napproval; but, to get her whole mind as one gives it only in combating\nopposition, he continued to object. “But suppose,” said he, “Whitney\ninsists on selecting the new management? As he’s the only one competent,\nhow can they refuse?”",
        "“We must find a way round that,” replied Madelene. “It’s perfectly plain,\nisn’t it, that there’s only one course–an absolutely new management. And\nhow can Mr. Whitney object? If he’s not guilty he won’t object, because\nhe’ll be eager to try the obvious remedy. If he’s guilty he won’t\nobject–he’ll be afraid of being suspected.”",
        "“Dory suggested–” began Arthur, and stopped.",
        "“That you be put in as manager?”",
        "“How did you know that?”",
        "“It’s the sensible thing. It’s the only thing,” answered his wife. “And\nDory has the genius of good sense. You ought to go to Scarborough and ask\nfor the place. Take Dory with you.”",
        "“That’s good advice,” said Arthur, heartily.",
        "Madelene laughed. “When a man praises a woman’s advice, it means she has\ntold him to do what he had made up his mind to do anyhow.”",
        "Next day Scarborough called a meeting of the trustees. Down from Chicago\ncame Whitney–at the greatest personal inconvenience, so he showed his\ncolleagues, but eager to do anything for Tecumseh. Scarborough gave a\nclear and appalling account of how the Ranger-Whitney Company’s\nprosperity was slipping into the abyss like a caving sand bank, on all\nsides, apparently under pressure of forces beyond human control. “In view\nof the facts,” said he, in conclusion, “our sole hope is in putting\nourselves to one side and giving an entirely new management an entirely\nfree hand.”",
        "Whitney had listened to Scarborough’s speech with the funereal\ncountenance befitting so melancholy a recital. As Scarborough finished\nand sank back in his chair, he said, with energy and heartiness, “I agree\nwith you, senator. The lawyers tell me there are as yet no signs of a\ncase against the railways. Besides, the trouble seems to be, as I feared,\ndeeper than this possible rebating. Jenkins–one of my best men–I sent\nhim down to help Howells out–he’s clearly an utter failure–utter! And I\nam getting old. The new conditions of business life call for young men\nwith open minds.”",
        "“No, no!” protested Dr. Hargrave. “I will not consent to any change that\ntakes your hand off the lever, my friend. These are stormy times in our\nindustrial world, and we need the wise, experienced pilot.”",
        "Scarborough had feared this; but he and Dory, forced to choose between\ntaking him into their confidence and boldly challenging the man in whom\nhe believed implicitly, had chosen the far safer course. “While Mr.\nWhitney must appreciate your eulogy, doctor,” said he, suave yet with a\ncertain iciness, “I think he will insist upon the trial of the only plan\nthat offers. In our plight we must not shrink from desperate\nremedies–even a remedy as desperate as eliminating the one man who\nunderstands the business from end to end.” This last with slight emphasis\nand a steady look at Whitney.",
        "Whitney reddened. “We need not waste words,” said he, in his bluff, sharp\nvoice. “The senator and I are in accord, and we are the majority.”",
        "“At least, Mr. Whitney,” said the doctor, “you must suggest the new man.\nYou know the business world. We don’t.”",
        "A long pause; then from Whitney: “Why not try young Ranger?”",
        "Scarborough looked at him in frank amazement. By what process of infernal\ntelepathy had he found out? Or was there some deep reason why Arthur\nwould be the best possible man for his purpose, if his purpose was indeed\nmalign? Was Arthur his tool? Or was Arthur subtly making tools of both\nWhitney and himself?",
        "Dr. Hargrave was dumfounded. When he recovered himself sufficiently to\nspeak, it was to say, “Why, he’s a mere boy, Whitney–not yet thirty. He\nhas had no experience!”",
        "“Inexperience seems to be what we need,” replied Whitney, eyes twinkling\nsneeringly at Scarborough. “We have tried experience, and it is a\ndisastrous failure.”",
        "Scarborough was still reflecting.",
        "“True,” pursued Whitney, “the young man would also have the motive of\nself-interest to keep him from making a success.”",
        "“How is that?” inquired Scarborough.",
        "“Under the will,” Whitney reminded him, “he can buy back the property\nat its market value. Obviously, the less the property is worth, the\nbetter for him.”",
        "Scarborough was staggered. Was Arthur crafty as well as able? With the\nhuman conscience ever eager to prove that what is personally advantageous\nis also right, how easy for a man in his circumstances to convince\nhimself that any course would be justifiable in upsetting the “injustice\"\nof Hiram Ranger’s will.",
        "“However,” continued Whitney, “I’ve no doubt he’s as honest as his\nfather–and I couldn’t say more than that. The only question is whether\nwe can risk giving him the chance to show what there is in him.”",
        "Dr. Hargrave was looking dazedly from one of his colleagues to the other,\nas if he thought his mind were playing him a trick. “It is\nimpossible–preposterous!” he exclaimed.",
        "“A man has to make a beginning,” said Whitney. “How can he show what\nthere is in him unless he gets a chance? It seems to me, doctor, we owe\nit to Hiram to do this for the boy. We can keep an eye and a hand on him.\nWhat do you think, senator?”",
        "Scarborough had won at every stage of his career, not merely because he\nhad convictions and the courage of them, but chiefly because he had the\ncourage to carry through the plans he laid in trying to make his\nconvictions effective. He had come there, fixed that Arthur was the man\nfor the place; why throw up his hand because Whitney was playing into it?\nNothing had occurred to change his opinion of Arthur. “Let us try Arthur\nRanger,” he now said. “But let us give him a free hand.”",
        "He was watching Whitney’s face; he saw it change expression–a slight\nfrown. “I advise against the free hand,” said Whitney.",
        "“I protest against it!” cried Dr. Hargrave. “I protest against even\nconsidering this inexperienced boy for such a responsibility.”",
        "Scarborough addressed himself to Whitney. “If we do not give our new\nmanager, whoever he may be, a free hand, and if he should fail, how shall\nwe know whether the fault is his or–yours?”",
        "At the direct “yours” Scarborough thought Whitney winced; but his reply\nwas bland and frank enough. He turned to Dr. Hargrave. “The senator is\nright,” said he. “I shall vote with him.”",
        "“Then it is settled,” said Scarborough. “Ranger is to have absolute\ncharge.”",
        "Dr. Hargrave was now showing every sign of his great age; the anguish of\nimminent despair was in his deep-set eyes and in his broken, trembling\nvoice as he cried: “Gentlemen, this is madness! Charles, I implore you,\ndo not take such precipitate action in so vital a matter! Let us talk it\nover–think it over. The life of the university is at stake!”",
        "It was evident that the finality in the tones and in the faces of his\ncolleagues had daunted him; but with a tremendous effort he put down the\nweakness of age and turned fiercely upon Whitney to shame him from\nindorsing Scarborough’s suicidal policy. But Whitney, with intent of\nbrutality, took out his watch. “I have just time to catch my train,” said\nhe, indifferently; “I can only use my best judgment, doctor. Sorry to\nhave to disagree with you, but Senator Scarborough has convinced me.” And\nhaving thus placed upon Scarborough the entire responsibility for the\nevent of the experiment, he shook hands with his colleagues and hurried\nout to his waiting carriage.",
        "Dr. Hargrave dropped into a chair and stared into vacancy. In all those\nlong, long years of incessant struggle against heartbreaking obstacles he\nhad never lost courage or faith. But this blow at the very life of the\nuniversity and from its friends! He could not even lift himself enough to\nlook to his God; it seemed to him that God had gone on a far journey.\nScarborough, watching him, was profoundly moved. “If at the end of three\nmonths you wish Ranger to resign,” said he, “I shall see to it that he\ndoes resign. Believe me, doctor, I have not taken this course without\nconsidering all the possibilities, so far as I could foresee them.”",
        "The old president, impressed by his peculiar tone, looked up quickly.\n“There is something in this that I don’t understand,” said he, searching\nScarborough’s face.",
        "Scarborough was tempted to explain. But the consequences, should he fail\nto convince Hargrave, compelled him to withhold. “I hope, indeed I feel\nsure, you will be astonished in our young friend,” said he, instead. “I\nhave been talking with him a good deal lately, and I am struck by the\nstrong resemblance to his father. It is more than mere physical\nlikeness.”",
        "With a sternness he could have shown only where principle was at stake,\nthe old man said: “But I must not conceal from you, senator, that I have\nthe gravest doubts and fears. You have alienated the university’s best\nfriend–rich, powerful, able, and, until you exasperated him, devoted to\nits interests. I regard you as having–unintentionally, and no doubt for\ngood motives–betrayed the solemn trust Hiram Ranger reposed in you.” He\nwas standing at his full height, with his piercing eyes fixed upon his\nyoung colleague’s.",
        "All the color left Scarborough’s face. “Betrayed is a strong\nword,” he said.",
        "“A strong word, senator,” answered Dr. Hargrave, “and used deliberately.\nI wish you good day, sir.”",
        "Hargrave was one of those few men who are respected without any\nreservation, and whose respect is, therefore, not given up without a\nsense of heavy loss. But to explain would be to risk rousing in him an\neven deeper anger–anger on account of his friend Whitney; so, without\nanother word, Scarborough bowed and went. “Either he will be apologizing\nto me at the end of three months,” said he to himself, “or I shall be\napologizing to Whitney and shall owe Tecumseh a large sum of money.”",
        "Both Madelene and Arthur had that instinct for comfort and luxury which\nis an even larger factor in advancement than either energy or\nintelligence. The idea that clothing means something more than warmth,\nfood something more than fodder, a house something more than shelter, is\nthe beginning of progress; the measure of a civilized man or woman is the\nmeasure of his or her passion for and understanding of the art of living.",
        "Madelene, by that right instinct which was perhaps the finest part of her\nsane and strong character, knew what comfort really means, knew the\ndifference between luxury and the showy vulgarity of tawdriness or\nexpensiveness; and she rapidly corrected, or, rather, restored, Arthur’s\ngood taste, which had been vitiated by his associations with fashionable\npeople, whose standards are necessarily always poor. She was devoted to\nher profession as a science; but she did not neglect the vital material\nconsiderations. She had too much self-respect to become careless about\nher complexion or figure, about dress or personal habits, even if she had\nnot had such shrewd insight into what makes a husband remain a lover, a\nwife a mistress. She had none of those self-complacent delusions which\nlure vain women on in slothfulness until Love vacates his neglected\ntemple. And in large part, no doubt, Arthur’s appearance–none of the\nstains and patches of the usual workingman, and this though he worked\nhard at manual labor and in a shop–was due to her influence of example;\nhe, living with such a woman, would have been ashamed not to keep “up to\nthe mark.” Also her influence over old Mrs. Ranger became absolute; and\nswiftly yet imperceptibly the house, which had so distressed Adelaide,\nwas transformed, not into the exhibit of fashionable ostentation which\nhad once been Adelaide’s and Arthur’s ideal, but into a house of comfort\nand beauty, with colors harmonizing, the look of newness gone from the\n“best rooms,” and finally the “best rooms” themselves abolished. And\nEllen thought herself chiefly responsible for the change. “I’m gradually\ngetting things just about as I want ’em,” said she. “It does take a long\ntime to do anything in this world!” Also she believed, and a boundless\ndelight it was to her, that she was the cause of Madelene’s professional\nsuccess. Everyone talked of the way Madelene was getting on, and wondered\nat her luck. “She deserves it, though,” said they, “for she can all but\nraise the dead.” In fact, the secret was simple enough. She had been\ntaught by her father to despise drugs and to compel dieting and exercise.\nShe had the tact which he lacked; she made the allowances for human\nnature’s ignorance and superstition which he refused to make; she\nlessened the hardship of taking her common-sense prescriptions by veiling\nthem in medical hocus-pocus–a compromise of the disagreeable truth which\nher father had always inveighed against as both immoral and unwholesome.",
        "Within six months after her marriage she was earning as much as her\nhusband; and her fame was spreading so rapidly that not only women but\nalso men, and men with a contempt for the “inferior mentality of the\nfemale,” were coming to her from all sides. “You’ll soon have a huge\nincome,” said Arthur. “Why, you’ll be rich, you are so grasping.”",
        "“Indeed I am,” replied she. “The way to teach people to strive for high\nwages and to learn thrift is to make them pay full value for what they\nget. I don’t propose to encourage dishonesty or idleness. Besides, we’ll\nneed the money.”",
        "Arthur had none of that mean envy which can endure the prosperity of\nstrangers only; he would not even have been able to be jealous of his\nwife’s getting on better than did he. But, if he had been so disposed, he\nwould have found it hard to indulge such feelings because of Madelene.\nShe had put their married life on the right basis. She made him feel,\nwith a certainty which no morbid imagining could have shaken, that she\nloved and respected him for qualities which could not be measured by any\nof the world’s standards of success. He knew that in her eyes he was\nalready an arrived success, that she was absolutely indifferent whether\nothers ever recognized it or not. Only those who realize how powerful is\nthe influence of intimate association will appreciate what an effect\nliving with Madelene had upon Arthur’s character–in withering the ugly\nin it, in developing its quality, and in directing its strength.",
        "When Scarborough gave Arthur his “chance,” Madelene took it as the matter\nof course. “I’m sorry it has come so soon,” said she, “and in just this\nway. But it couldn’t have been delayed long. With so much to be done and\nso few able or willing to do it, the world can’t wait long enough for a\nman really to ripen. It’s lucky that you inherit from your father so many\nimportant things that most men have to spend their lives in learning.”",
        "“Do you think so?” said he, brightening; for, with the “chance” secure,\nhe was now much depressed by the difficulties which he had been\nresurveying from the inside point of view.",
        "“You understand how to manage men,” she replied, “and you understand\nbusiness.”",
        "“But, unfortunately, this isn’t business.”",
        "He was right. The problem of business is, in its two main factors,\nperfectly simple–to make a wanted article, and to put it where those who\nwant it can buy. But this was not Arthur Ranger’s problem, nor is it the\nproblem of most business men in our time. Between maker and customer,\nnowadays, lie the brigands who control the railways–that is, the\nhighways; and they with equal facility use or defy the law, according to\ntheir needs. When Arthur went a-buying grain or stave timber, he and\nthose with whom he was trading had to placate the brigands before they\ncould trade; when he went a-selling flour, he had to fight his way to the\nmarkets through the brigands. It was the battle which causes more than\nninety out of every hundred in independent business to fail–and of the\nremaining ten, how many succeed only because they either escaped the\nnotice of the brigands or compromised with them?",
        "“I wish you luck,” said Jenkins, when, at the end of two weeks of his\ntutelage, Arthur told him he would try it alone.",
        "Arthur laughed. “No, you don’t, Jenkins,” replied he, with good-humored\nbluntness. “But I’m going to have it, all the same.”",
        "Discriminating prices and freight rates against his grain, discriminating\nfreight rates against his flour; the courts either powerless to aid him\nor under the rule of bandits; and, on the top of all, a strike within two\nweeks after Jenkins left–such was the situation. Arthur thought it\nhopeless; but he did not lose courage nor his front of serenity, even\nwhen alone with Madelene. Each was careful not to tempt the malice of\nfate by concealments; each was careful also not to annoy the other with\nunnecessary disagreeable recitals. If he could have seen where good\nadvice could possibly help him, he would have laid all his troubles\nbefore her; but it seemed to him that to ask her advice would be as if\nshe were to ask him to tell her how to put life into a corpse. He\nimagined that she was deceived by his silence about the details of his\naffairs because she gave no sign, did not even ask questions beyond\ngeneralities. She, however, was always watching his handsome face with\nits fascinating evidences of power inwardly developing; and, as it was\nher habit to get valuable information as to what was going on inside her\nfellow-beings from a close study of surface appearances, the growing\ngauntness of his features, the coming out of the lines of sternness, did\nnot escape her, made her heart throb with pride even as it ached with\nsympathy and anxiety. At last she decided for speech.",
        "He was sitting in their dressing room, smoking his last cigarette as he\nwatched her braid her wonderful hair for the night. She, observing him in\nthe glass, saw that he was looking at her with that yearning for sympathy\nwhich is always at its strongest in a man in the mood that was his at\nsight of those waves and showers of soft black hair on the pallid\nwhiteness of her shoulders. Before he realized what she was about she was\nin his lap, her arms round his neck, his face pillowed against her cheek\nand her hair. “What is it, little boy?” she murmured, with that mingling\nof the mistress and the mother which every woman who ever loved feels for\nand, at certain times, shows the man she loves.",
        "He laughed. “Business–business,” said he. “But let’s not talk about\nit. The important thing is that I have you. The rest is–smoke!” And\nhe blew out a great cloud of it and threw the cigarette through the\nopen window.",
        "“Tell me,” she said; “I’ve been waiting for you to speak, and I can’t\nwait any longer.”",
        "“I couldn’t–just now. It doesn’t at all fit in with my thoughts.” And\nhe kissed her.",
        "She moved to rise. “Then I’ll go back to the dressing table. Perhaps\nyou’ll be able to tell me with the width of the room between us.”",
        "He drew her head against his again. “Very well–if I must, I will. But\nyou know all about it. For some mysterious reason, somebody–you say it’s\nWhitney, and probably it is–won’t let me buy grain or anything else as\ncheaply as others buy it. And for the same mysterious reason, somebody,\nprobably Whitney again, won’t let me get to market without paying a\nheavier toll than our competitors pay. And now for some mysterious reason\nsomebody, probably Whitney again, has sent labor organizers from Chicago\namong the men and has induced them to make impossible demands and to walk\nout without warning.”",
        "“And you think there’s nothing to do but walk out, too,” said Madelene.",
        "“Or wait until I’m put out.”",
        "His tone made those words mean that his desperate situation had roused\nhis combativeness, that he would not give up. Her blood beat faster and\nher eyes shone. “You’ll win,” she said, with the quiet confidence which\nstrengthens when it comes from a person whose judgment one has tested and\nfound good. And he believed in her as absolutely as she believed in him.",
        "“I’ve been tempted to resign,” he went on. “If I don’t everybody’ll say\nI’m a failure when the crash comes. But–Madelene, there’s something in\nme that simply won’t let me quit.”",
        "“There is,” replied she; “it’s your father.”",
        "“Anyhow, you are the only public opinion for me.”",
        "“You’ll win,” repeated Madelene. “I’ve been thinking over that whole\nbusiness. If I were you, Arthur\"–she was sitting up so that she could\nlook at him and make her words more impressive–\"I’d dismiss strike and\nfreight rates and the mill, and I’d put my whole mind on Whitney. There’s\na weak spot somewhere in his armor. There always is in a scoundrel’s.”",
        "Arthur reflected. Presently he drew her head down against his; it seemed\nto her that she could feel his brain at work, and soon she knew from the\nchange in the clasp of his arms about her that that keen, quick mind of\nhis was serving him well. “What a joy it is to a woman,” she thought, “to\nknow that she can trust the man she loves–trust him absolutely, always,\nand in every way.” And she fell asleep after awhile, lulled by the\nrhythmic beat of his pulse, so steady, so strong, giving her such a\nrestful sense of security. She did not awaken until he was gently laying\nher in the bed.",
        "“You have found it?” said she, reading the news in the altered expression\nof his face.",
        "“I hope so,” replied he.",
        "She saw that he did not wish to discuss. So she said, “I knew you would,\"\nand went contentedly back into sleep again.",
        "Next day he carefully read the company’s articles of incorporation to\nmake sure that they contained no obstacle to his plan. Then he went to\nScarborough, and together they went to Judge Torrey. Three days later\nthere was a special meeting of the board of directors; the president,\nCharles Whitney, was unable to attend, but his Monday morning mail\ncontained this extract from the minutes:",
        "“Mr. Ranger offered a resolution that an assessment of two thousand\ndollars be at once laid upon each share of the capital stock, the\nproceeds to be expended by the superintendent in betterments. Seconded\nby Mr. Scarborough. Unanimously passed.”",
        "Whitney reread this very carefully. He laid the letter down and stared at\nit. Two thousand dollars a share meant that he, owner of four hundred and\neighty-seven shares, would have to pay in cash nine hundred and\nseventy-four thousand dollars. He ordered his private car attached to the\nnoon express, and at five o’clock he was in Scarborough’s library.",
        "“What is the meaning of this assessment?” he demanded, as\nScarborough entered.",
        "“Mr. Ranger explained the situation to us,” replied Scarborough. “He\nshowed us we had to choose between ruin and a complete reorganization\nwith big improvements and extensions.”",
        "“Lunacy, sheer lunacy!” cried Whitney. “A meeting of the board must be\ncalled and the resolution rescinded.”",
        "Scarborough simply looked at him, a smile in his eyes.",
        "“I never heard of such an outrage! You ask me to pay an assessment of\nnearly a million dollars on stock that is worthless.”",
        "“And,” replied Scarborough, “at the end of the year we expect to levy\nanother assessment of a thousand a share.”",
        "Whitney had been tramping stormily up and down the room. As Scarborough\nuttered those last words he halted. He eyed his tranquil fellow-trustee,\nthen seated himself, and said, with not a trace of his recent fury: “You\nmust know, Scarborough, the mills have no future. I hadn’t the heart to\nsay so before Dr. Hargrave. But I supposed you were reading the signs\nright. The plain truth is, this is no longer a good location for the\nflour industry.”",
        "Scarborough waited before replying; when he did speak his tones were\ndeliberate and suggestive of strong emotion well under control. “True,\"\nsaid he, “not just at present. But Judge Beverwick, your friend and\nsilent partner who sits on the federal bench in this district, is at the\npoint of death. I shall see to it that his successor is a man with a less\nintense prejudice against justice. Thus we may be able to convince some\nof your friends in control of the railways that Saint X is as good a\nplace for mills as any in the country.”",
        "Whitney grunted. His face was inscrutable. He paced the length of the\nroom twice; he stood at the window gazing out at the arbors, at the bees\nbuzzing contentedly, at the flies darting across the sifting sunbeams.\n“Beautiful place, this,” said he at last; “very homelike. No wonder\nyou’re a happy man.” A pause. “As to the other matter, I’ll see. No\ndoubt I can stop this through the courts, if you push me to it.”",
        "“Not without giving us a chance to explain,” replied Scarborough; “and\nthe higher courts may agree with us that we ought to defend the\nuniversity’s rights against your railway friends and your ’labor’ men\nwhom you sent down here to cause the strike.”",
        "“Rubbish!” said Whitney; and he laughed. “Rubbish!” he repeated. “It’s\nnot a matter either for argument or for anger.” He took his hat, made a\nslight ironic bow, and was gone.",
        "He spent the next morning with Arthur, discussing the main phases of the\nbusiness, with little said by either about the vast new project. They\nlunched together in the car, which was on a siding before the offices,\nready to join the early afternoon express. Arthur was on his guard\nagainst Whitney, but he could not resist the charm of the financier’s\nmanner and conversation. Like all men of force, Whitney had great\nmagnetism, and his conversation was frank to apparent indiscretion, a\nmost plausible presentation of the cynical philosophy of practical life\nas it is lived by men of bold and generous nature.",
        "“That assessment scheme was yours, wasn’t it?” he said, when he and\nArthur had got on terms of intimacy.",
        "“The first suggestion came from me,” admitted Arthur.",
        "“A great stroke,” said Whitney. “You will arrive, young man. I thought it\nwas your doing, because it reminded me of your father. I never knew a\nmore direct man than he, yet he was without an equal at flanking\nmovements. What a pity his mind went before he died! My first impulse was\nto admire his will. But, now that I’ve come to know you, I see that if he\nhad lived to get acquainted with you he’d have made a very; different\ndisposition of the family property. As it is, it’s bound to go to pieces.\nNo board ever managed anything successfully. It’s always a man–one man.\nIn this case it ought to be you. But the time will come–soon,\nprobably–when your view will conflict with that of the majority of the\nboard. Then out you’ll go; and your years of intelligent labor will be\ndestroyed.”",
        "It was plain in Arthur’s face that this common-sense statement of the\ncase produced instant and strong effect. He merely said: “Well, one must\ntake that risk.”",
        "“Not necessarily,” replied Whitney; he was talking in the most careless,\nimpersonal way. “A man of your sort, with the strength and the ability\nyou inherit, and with the power that they give you to play an important\npart in the world, doesn’t let things drift to ruin. I intend,\nultimately, to give my share of the Ranger-Whitney Company to\nTecumseh–I’m telling you this in confidence.”",
        "Arthur glanced quickly at the great financier, suspicion and wonder\nin his eyes.",
        "“But I want it to be a value when I give it,” continued Whitney; “not the\nworse than worthless paper it threatens to become. Scarborough and Dr.\nHargrave are splendid men. No one honors them more highly than I do. But\nthey are not business men. And who will be their successors? Probably men\neven less practical.”",
        "Arthur, keen-witted but young, acute but youthfully ready to attribute\nthe generous motive rather than the sinister, felt that he was getting a\nnew light on Whitney’s character. Perhaps Whitney wasn’t so unworthy,\nafter all. Perhaps, in trying to wreck the business and so get hold of\nit, he had been carrying out a really noble purpose, in the unscrupulous\nway characteristic of the leaders of the world of commerce and finance.\nTo Whitney he said: “I haven’t given any thought to these matters.” With\na good-natured laugh of raillery: “You have kept me too busy.”",
        "Whitney smiled–an admission that yet did not commit him. “When you’ve\nlived a while longer, Arthur,” said he, “you’ll not be so swift and harsh\nin your judgments of men who have to lay the far-sighted plans and have\nto deal with mankind as it is, not as it ought to be. However, by that\ntime the Ranger-Whitney Company will be wiped out. It’s a pity. If only\nthere were some way of getting the control definitely in your\nhands–where your father would have put it if he had lived. It’s a shame\nto permit his life work and his plans for the university to be\ndemolished. In your place I’d not permit it.”",
        "Arthur slowly flushed. Without looking at Whitney, he said: “I don’t see\nhow I could prevent it.”",
        "Whitney studied his flushed face, his lowered eyes, reflected carefully\non the longing note in the voice in which he had made that statement, a\nnote that changed it to a question. “Control could be got only by\nownership,” explained he. “If I were sure you were working with a\ndefinite, practical purpose really to secure the future of the company,\nI’d go heartily into your assessment plan. In fact, I’d–” Whitney was\nfeeling his way. The change in Arthur’s expression, the sudden tightening\nof the lips, warned him that he was about to go too far, that he had\nsowed as much seed as it was wise to sow at that time. He dropped the\nsubject abruptly, saying: “But I’ve got to go up to the bank before train\ntime. I’m glad we’ve had this little talk. Something of value may grow\nout of it. Think it over, and if any new ideas come to you run up to\nChicago and see me.”",
        "Arthur did indeed think it over, every moment of that afternoon; and\nbefore going home he took a long walk alone. He saw that Charles Whitney\nhad proposed a secret partnership, in which he was to play Whitney’s game\nand, in exchange, was to get control of the Ranger-Whitney Company. And\nwhat Whitney had said about the folly of board managements, about the\ninsecurity of his own position, was undeniably true; and the sacrifice of\nthe “smaller morality” for the “larger good” would be merely doing what\nthe biographies of the world’s men of achievement revealed them as doing\nagain and again. Further, once in control, once free to put into action\nthe plans for a truly vast concern, of which he had so often dreamed, he\ncould give Tecumseh a far larger income than it had ever hoped to have\nthrough his father’s gift, and also could himself be rich and powerful.\nTo the men who have operated with success and worldly acclaim under the\ncode of the “larger good,” the men who have aggrandized themselves at the\nexpense of personal honor and the rights of others and the progress of\nthe race, the first, the crucial temptation to sacrifice “smaller\nmorality” and “short-sighted scruples” has always come in some such form\nas it here presented itself to Arthur Ranger. The Napoleons begin as\ndefenders of rational freedom against the insane license of the mob; the\nRockefellers begin as cheapeners of a necessity of life to the straitened\nmillions of their fellow-beings.",
        "If Arthur had been weak, he would have put aside the temptation through\nfear of the consequences of failure. If he had been ignorant, he would\nhave put it aside through superstition. Being neither weak nor ignorant,\nand having a human passion for wealth and power and a willingness to get\nthem if he could do it without sacrifice of self-respect, he sat calmly\ndown with the temptation and listened to it and debated with it. He was\nsilent all through dinner; and after dinner, when he and Madelene were in\ntheir sitting room upstairs, she reading, he sat with his eyes upon her,\nand continued to think.",
        "All at once he gave a curious laugh, went to the writing table and wrote\na few moments. Then he brought the letter to her. “Read that,” said he,\nstanding behind her, his hands on her shoulders and an expression in his\nface that made his resemblance to Hiram startling.",
        "She read:",
        "“MY DEAR MR. WHITNEY: I’ve been ’thinking it over’ as you suggested. I’ve\ndecided to plug along in the old way, between the old landmarks. Let me\nadd that, if you should offer to give your stock to Tecumseh now, I’d\nhave to do my utmost to persuade the trustees not to take it until the\ncompany was once more secure. You see, I feel it is absolutely necessary\nthat you have a large pecuniary interest in the success of our plans.”",
        "When Madelene had read she turned in the chair until she was looking up\nat him. “Well?” she inquired. “What does it mean?”",
        "He told her. “And,” he concluded, “I wish I could be a great man, but I\ncan’t. There’s something small in me that won’t permit it. No doubt\nFranklin was right when he said life was a tunnel and one had to stoop,\nand even occasionally to crawl, in order to get through it successfully.\nNow–if I hadn’t married you–”",
        "“Always blaming me,” she said, tenderly. “But even if you hadn’t\nmarried me, I suspect that sooner or later you’d have decided for being\na large man in a valley rather than a very small imitation man on a\nmountain.” Then, after a moment’s thought, and with sudden radiance:\n“But a man as big as you are wouldn’t be let stay in the valley, no\nmatter how hard he tried.”",
        "He laughed. “I’ve no objection to the mountain top,” said he. “But I see\nthat, if I get there, it’ll have to be in my own way. Let’s go out and\nmail the letter.”",
        "And they went down the drive together to the post box, and, strolling\nback, sat under the trees in the moonlight until nearly midnight, feeling\nas if they had only just begun life together–and had begun it right.",
        "When Charles Whitney had read the letter he tore it up, saying half-aloud\nand contemptuously, “I was afraid there was too big a streak of fool in\nhim.” Then, with a shrug: “What’s the use of wasting time on that little\ngame–especially as I’d probably have left the university the whole\nbusiness in my will.” He wrote Scarborough, proposing that they delay the\nassessment until he had a chance to look further into the railway\nsituation. “I begin to understand the troubles down there, now that I’ve\ntaken time to think them over. I feel I can guarantee that no assessment\nwill be necessary.”",
        "And when the railways had mysteriously and abruptly ceased to misbehave,\nand the strike had suddenly fizzled out, he offered his stock to the\nuniversity as a gift. “I shall see to it,” he wrote, “that the company is\nnot molested again, but is helped in every way.” Arthur was for holding\noff, but Scarborough said, “No. He will keep his word.” And Scarborough\nwas right in regarding the matter as settled and acceptance of the\nsplendid gift as safe. Whitney had his own code of honesty, of honor. It\nwas not square dealing, but doing exactly what he specifically engaged to\ndo. He would have stolen anything he could–anything he regarded as worth\nhis while. On the other hand, he would have sacrificed nearly all, if not\nall, his fortune, to live up to the letter of his given word. This,\nthough no court would have enforced the agreement he had made, though\nthere was no written record of it, no witness other than himself, the\nother party, and the Almighty–for Charles Whitney believed in an\nAlmighty God and an old-fashioned hell and a Day of Judgment. He\nconducted his religious bookkeeping precisely as he conducted his\nbusiness bookkeeping, and was confident that he could escape hell as he\nhad escaped the penitentiary.",
