        "A pleasing anecdote is being told through the press columns recently, of\nan encounter on the South Platte, which occurred some years ago between a\nTexan and a buffalo. The recital sets forth the fact that the Texans went\nout to hunt buffalo, hoping to get enough for a mess during the day.\nToward evening they saw two gentlemen buffalo on a neighboring hill near\nthe Platte, and at once pursued their game, each selecting an animal. They\nseparated at once, Jack going one way galloping after his beast, while Sam\nwent in the other direction. Jack soon got a shot at his game, but the\nbullet only tore a large hole in the fleshy shoulder of the bull and\nburied itself in the neck, maddening the animal to such a degree that he\nturned at once and charged upon horse and rider.",
        "The astonished horse, with the wonderful courage, sagacity and sang\nfroid peculiar to the broncho, whirled around two consecutive times,\ntangled his feet in the tall grass and fell, throwing his rider about\nfifty feet. He then rose and walked away to a quiet place, where he could\nconsider the matter and give the buffalo an opportunity to recover.",
        "The infuriated bull then gave chase to Jack, who kept out of the way for a\nfew yards only, when, getting his legs entangled in the grass, he fell so\nsuddenly that his pursuer dashed over him without doing him any bodily\ninjury. However, as the animal went over his prostrate form, Jack felt the\nbuffalo’s tail brush across his face, and, rising suddenly, he caught it\nwith a terrific grip and hung to it, thus keeping out of the reach of his\nenemy’s horns, till his strength was just giving out, when Sam hove in\nsight and put a large bullet through the bull’s heart.",
        "This tale is told, apparently, by an old plainsman and scout, who reels it\noff as though he might be telling his own experience.",
        "Now, I do not wish to seem captious and always sticking my nose into what\nis none of my business, but as a logical and zoological fact, I desire, in\nmy cursory way, to coolly take up the subject of the buffalo tail. Those\nwho have been in the habit of killing buffaloes, instead of running an\naccount at the butcher shop, will remember that this noble animal has a\ngenuine camel’s hair tail about eight inches long, with a chenille tassel\nat the end, which he throws up into the rarified atmosphere of the far\nwest, whenever he is surprised or agitated.",
        "In passing over a prostrate man, therefore, I apprehend that in order to\nbrush his face with the average buffalo tail, it would be necessary for\nhim to sit down on the bosom of the prostrate scout and fan his features\nwith the miniature caudal bud.",
        "The buffalo does not gallop an hundred miles a day, dragging his tail\nacross the bunch grass and alkali of the boundless plains.",
        "He snorts a little, turns his bloodshot eyes toward the enemy a moment and\nthen, throwing his cunning little taillet over the dash-boardlet, he wings\naway in an opposite direction.",
        "The man who could lie on his back and grab that vision by the tail would\nhave to be moderately active. If he succeeded, however, it would be a\nquestion of the sixteenth part of a second only, whether he had his arms\njerked out by the roots and scattered through space or whether he had\nstrength of will sufficient to yank out the withered little frizz and told\nthe quivering ornament in his hands. Few people have the moral courage to\nfollow a buffalo around over half a day holding on by the tail. It is\nsaid that a Sioux brave once tried it, and they say his tracks were\nthirteen miles apart. After merrily sauntering around with the buffalo one\nhour, during which time he crossed the territories of Wyoming and Dakota\ntwice and surrounded the regular army three times, he became discouraged\nand died fiom the injuries he had received. Perhaps, however, it may have\nbeen fatigue.",
        "It might be possible for a man to catch hold of the meager tail of a\nmeteor and let it snatch him through the coming years.",
        "It might be, that a man with a strong constitution could catch a cyclone\nand ride it bareback across the United States and then have a fresh one\nready to ride back again, but to catch a buffalo bull in the full flush of\nmanhood, as it were, and retain his tail while he crossed three\nreservations and two mountain ranges, requires great tenacity of purpose\nand unusual mental equipoise.",
        "Remember, I do not regard the story I refer to as false, at least I do not\nwish to be so understood. I simply say that it recounts an incident that\nis rather out of the ordinary. Let the gentle reader lie down and have a\nJackrabbit driven across his face, for instance. The J. Rabbit is as\nlikely to brush your face with his brief and erect tail as the buffalo\nwould be. Then carefully note how rapidly and promptly instantaneous you\nmust be. Then closely attend to the manner in which you abruptly and\nalmost simultaneously, have not retained the tail in your memory.",
        "A few people may have successfully seized the grieved and startled buffalo\nby the tail, but they are not here to testify to the circumstances. They\nare dead, abnormally and extremely dead.",
