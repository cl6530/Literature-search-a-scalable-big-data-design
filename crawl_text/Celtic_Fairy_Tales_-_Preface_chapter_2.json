        "Last year, in giving the young ones a volume of English Fairy Tales,\nmy difficulty was one of collection. This time, in offering them\nspecimens of the rich folk-fancy of the Celts of these islands, my\ntrouble has rather been one of selection. Ireland began to collect\nher folk-tales almost as early as any country in Europe, and Croker\nhas found a whole school of successors in Carleton, Griffin,\nKennedy, Curtin, and Douglas Hyde. Scotland had the great name of\nCampbell, and has still efficient followers in MacDougall, MacInnes,\nCarmichael, Macleod, and Campbell of Tiree. Gallant little Wales has\nno name to rank alongside these; in this department the Cymru have\nshown less vigour than the Gaedhel. Perhaps the Eisteddfod, by\noffering prizes for the collection of Welsh folk-tales, may remove\nthis inferiority. Meanwhile Wales must be content to be somewhat\nscantily represented among the Fairy Tales of the Celts, while the\nextinct Cornish tongue has only contributed one tale.",
        "In making my selection I have chiefly tried to make the stories\ncharacteristic. It would have been easy, especially from Kennedy, to\nhave made up a volume entirely filled with “Grimm’s Goblins” à la\nCeltique. But one can have too much even of that very good\nthing, and I have therefore avoided as far as possible the more\nfamiliar “formulae” of folk-tale literature. To do this I had to\nwithdraw from the English-speaking Pale both in Scotland and\nIreland, and I laid down the rule to include only tales that have\nbeen taken down from Celtic peasants ignorant of English.",
        "Having laid down the rule, I immediately proceeded to break it. The\nsuccess of a fairy book, I am convinced, depends on the due\nadmixture of the comic and the romantic: Grimm and Asbjörnsen knew\nthis secret, and they alone. But the Celtic peasant who speaks\nGaelic takes the pleasure of telling tales somewhat sadly: so far as\nhe has been printed and translated, I found him, to my surprise,\nconspicuously lacking in humour. For the comic relief of this volume\nI have therefore had to turn mainly to the Irish peasant of the\nPale; and what richer source could I draw from?",
        "For the more romantic tales I have depended on the Gaelic, and, as I\nknow about as much of Gaelic as an Irish Nationalist M. P., I have\nhad to depend on translators. But I have felt myself more at liberty\nthan the translators themselves, who have generally been over-\nliteral, in changing, excising, or modifying the original. I have\neven gone further. In order that the tales should be characteristically\nCeltic, I have paid more particular attention to tales that are to be\nfound on both sides of the North Channel.",
        "In re-telling them I have had no scruple in interpolating now and\nthen a Scotch incident into an Irish variant of the same story, or\nvice versa. Where the translators appealed to English folklorists\nand scholars, I am trying to attract English children. They translated; I\nendeavoured to transfer. In short, I have tried to put myself into the\nposition of an ollamh or sheenachie familiar with both forms\nof Gaelic, and anxious to put his stories in the best way to attract\nEnglish children. I trust I shall be forgiven by Celtic scholars for the\nchanges I have had to make to effect this end.",
        "The stories collected in this volume are longer and more detailed\nthan the English ones I brought together last Christmas. The\nromantic ones are certainly more romantic, and the comic ones\nperhaps more comic, though there may be room for a difference of\nopinion on this latter point. This superiority of the Celtic folk-\ntales is due as much to the conditions under which they have been\ncollected, as to any innate superiority of the folk-imagination. The\nfolk-tale in England is in the last stages of exhaustion. The Celtic\nfolk-tales have been collected while the practice of story-telling\nis still in full vigour, though there are every signs that its term\nof life is already numbered. The more the reason why they should be\ncollected and put on record while there is yet time. On the whole,\nthe industry of the collectors of Celtic folk-lore is to be\ncommended, as may be seen from the survey of it I have prefixed to\nthe Notes and References at the end of the volume. Among these, I\nwould call attention to the study of the legend of Beth Gellert, the\norigin of which, I believe, I have settled.",
        "While I have endeavoured to render the language of the tales simple\nand free from bookish artifice, I have not felt at liberty to retell\nthe tales in the English way. I have not scrupled to retain a Celtic\nturn of speech, and here and there a Celtic word, which I have\nnot explained within brackets–a practice to be abhorred of\nall good men. A few words unknown to the reader only add\neffectiveness and local colour to a narrative, as Mr. Kipling well\nknows.",
        "One characteristic of the Celtic folk-lore I have endeavoured to\nrepresent in my selection, because it is nearly unique at the\npresent day in Europe. Nowhere else is there so large and consistent\na body of oral tradition about the national and mythical heroes as\namongst the Gaels. Only the byline, or hero-songs of Russia,\nequal in extent the amount of knowledge about the heroes of the past\nthat still exists among the Gaelic-speaking peasantry of Scotland\nand Ireland. And the Irish tales and ballads have this peculiarity,\nthat some of them have been extant, and can be traced, for well nigh\na thousand years. I have selected as a specimen of this class the\nStory of Deirdre, collected among the Scotch peasantry a few years\nago, into which I have been able to insert a passage taken from an\nIrish vellum of the twelfth century. I could have more than filled\nthis volume with similar oral traditions about Finn (the Fingal of\nMacpherson’s “Ossian”). But the story of Finn, as told by the Gaelic\npeasantry of to-day, deserves a volume by itself, while the\nadventures of the Ultonian hero, Cuchulain, could easily fill\nanother.",
        "I have endeavoured to include in this volume the best and most\ntypical stories told by the chief masters of the Celtic folk-tale,\nCampbell, Kennedy, Hyde, and Curtin, and to these I have added the\nbest tales scattered elsewhere. By this means I hope I have put\ntogether a volume, containing both the best, and the best known\nfolk-tales of the Celts. I have only been enabled to do this by the\ncourtesy of those who owned the copyright of these stories. Lady\nWilde has kindly granted me the use of her effective version of “The\nHorned Women;” and I have specially to thank Messrs. Macmillan for\nright to use Kennedy’s “Legendary Fictions,” and Messrs. Sampson Low\n& Co., for the use of Mr. Curtin’s Tales.",
        "In making my selection, and in all doubtful points of treatment, I\nhave had resource to the wide knowledge of my friend Mr. Alfred Nutt\nin all branches of Celtic folk-lore. If this volume does anything to\nrepresent to English children the vision and colour, the magic and\ncharm, of the Celtic folk-imagination, this is due in large measure\nto the care with which Mr. Nutt has watched its inception and\nprogress. With him by my side I could venture into regions where the\nnon-Celt wanders at his own risk.",
        "Lastly, I have again to rejoice in the co-operation of my friend,\nMr. J. D. Batten, in giving form to the creations of the folk-fancy.\nHe has endeavoured in his illustrations to retain as much as\npossible of Celtic ornamentation; for all details of Celtic\narchaeology he has authority. Yet both he and I have striven to give\nCeltic things as they appear to, and attract, the English mind,\nrather than attempt the hopeless task of representing them as they\nare to Celts. The fate of the Celt in the British Empire bids fair\nto resemble that of the Greeks among the Romans. “They went forth to\nbattle, but they always fell,” yet the captive Celt has enslaved his\ncaptor in the realm of imagination. The present volume attempts to\nbegin the pleasant captivity from the earliest years. If it could\nsucceed in giving a common fund of imaginative wealth to the Celtic\nand the Saxon children of these isles, it might do more for a true\nunion of hearts than all your politics.",
