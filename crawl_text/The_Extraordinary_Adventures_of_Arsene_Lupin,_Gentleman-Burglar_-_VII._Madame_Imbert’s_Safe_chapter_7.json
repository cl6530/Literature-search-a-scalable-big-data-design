        "At three o’clock in the morning, there were still half a dozen\ncarriages in front of one of those small houses which form only the\nside of the boulevard Berthier. The door of that house opened, and\na number of guests, male and female, emerged. The majority of them\nentered their carriages and were quickly driven away, leaving\nbehind only two men who walked down Courcelles, where they parted,\nas one of them lived in that street. The other decided to return\non foot as far as the Porte-Maillot. It was a beautiful winter’s\nnight, clear and cold; a night on which a brisk walk is agreeable\nand refreshing.",
        "But, at the end of a few minutes, he had the disagreeable\nimpression that he was being followed. Turning around, he saw a\nman sulking amongst the trees. He was not a coward; yet he felt it\nadvisable to increase his speed. Then his pursuer commenced to\nrun; and he deemed it prudent to draw his revolver and face him.\nBut he had no time. The man rushed at him and attacked him\nviolently. Immediately, they were engaged in a desperate struggle,\nwherein he felt that his unknown assailant had the advantage. He\ncalled for help, struggled, and was thrown down on a pile of\ngravel, seized by the throat, and gagged with a handkerchief that\nhis assailant forced into his mouth. His eyes closed, and the man\nwho was smothering him with his weight arose to defend himself\nagainst an unexpected attack. A blow from a cane and a kick from a\nboot; the man uttered two cries of pain, and fled, limping and\ncursing. Without deigning to pursue the fugitive, the new arrival\nstooped over the prostrate man and inquired:",
        "“Are you hurt, monsieur?”",
        "He was not injured, but he was dazed and unable to stand. His\nrescuer procured a carriage, placed him in it, and accompanied him\nto his house on the avenue de la Grande-Armee. On his arrival\nthere, quite recovered, he overwhelmed his saviour with thanks.",
        "“I owe you my life, monsieur, and I shall not forget it. I do not\nwish to alarm my wife at this time of night, but, to-morrow, she\nwill be pleased to thank you personally. Come and breakfast with\nus. My name is Ludovic Imbert. May I ask yours?”",
        "“Certainly, monsieur.”",
        "And he handed Mon. Imbert a card bearing the name: “Arsene Lupin.”",
        "At that time, Arsene Lupin did not enjoy the celebrity which the\nCahorn affair, his escape from the Prison de la Sante, and other\nbrilliant exploits, afterwards gained for him. He had not even\nused the name of Arsene Lupin. The name was specially invented to\ndesignate the rescuer of Mon. Imbert; that is to say, it was in\nthat affair that Arsene Lupin was baptized. Fully armed and ready\nfor the fray, it is true, but lacking the resources and authority\nwhich command success, Arsene Lupin was then merely an apprentice\nin a profession wherein he soon became a master.",
        "With what a thrill of joy he recalled the invitation he received\nthat night! At last, he had reached his goal! At last, he had\nundertaken a task worth of his strength and skill! The Imbert\nmillions! What a magnificent feast for an appetite like his!",
        "He prepared a special toilet for the occasion; a shabby frock-coat,\nbaggy trousers, a frayed silk hat, well-worn collar and cuffs, all\nquite correct in form, but bearing the unmistakable stamp of\npoverty. His cravat was a black ribbon pinned with a false\ndiamond. Thus accoutred, he descended the stairs of the house in\nwhich he lived at Montmartre. At the third floor, without\nstopping, he rapped on a closed door with the head of his cane. He\nwalked to the exterior boulevards. A tram-car was passing. He\nboarded it, and some one who had been following him took a seat\nbeside him. It was the lodger who occupied the room on the third\nfloor. A moment later, this man said to Lupin:",
        "“Well, governor?”",
        "“Well, it is all fixed.”",
        "“How?”",
        "“I am going there to breakfast.”",
        "“You breakfast--there!”",
        "“Certainly. Why not? I rescued Mon. Ludovic Imbert from certain\ndeath at your hands. Mon. Imbert is not devoid of gratitude. He\ninvited me to breakfast.”",
        "There was a brief silence. Then the other said:",
        "“But you are not going to throw up the scheme?”",
        "“My dear boy,” said Lupin, “When I arranged that little case of\nassault at battery, when I took the trouble at three o’clock in the\nmorning, to rap you with my cane and tap you with my boot at the\nrisk of injuring my only friend, it was not my intention to forego\nthe advantages to be gained from a rescue so well arranged and\nexecuted. Oh! no, not at all.”",
        "“But the strange rumors we hear about their fortune?”",
        "“Never mind about that. For six months, I have worked on this\naffair, investigated it, studied it, questioned the servants, the\nmoney-lenders and men of straw; for six months, I have shadowed the\nhusband and wife. Consequently, I know what I am talking about.\nWhether the fortune came to them from old Brawford, as they\npretend, or from some other source, I do not care. I know that it\nis a reality; that it exists. And some day it will be mine.”",
        "“Bigre! One hundred millions!”",
        "“Let us say ten, or even five--that is enough! They have a safe\nfull of bonds, and there will be the devil to pay if I can’t get my\nhands on them.”",
        "The tram-car stopped at the Place de l’Etoile. The man whispered\nto Lupin:",
        "“What am I to do now?”",
        "“Nothing, at present. You will hear from me. There is no hurry.”",
        "Five minutes later, Arsene Lupin was ascending the magnificent\nflight of stairs in the Imbert mansion, and Mon. Imbert introduced\nhim to his wife. Madame Gervaise Imbert was a short plump woman,\nand very talkative. She gave Lupin a cordial welcome.",
        "“I desired that we should be alone to entertain our saviour,” she\nsaid.",
        "From the outset, they treated “our saviour” as an old and valued\nfriend. By the time dessert was served, their friendship was well\ncemented, and private confidences were being exchanged. Arsene\nrelated the story of his life, the life of his father as a\nmagistrate, the sorrows of his childhood, and his present\ndifficulties. Gervaise, in turn, spoke of her youth, her marriage,\nthe kindness of the aged Brawford, the hundred millions that she\nhad inherited, the obstacles that prevented her from obtaining the\nenjoyment of her inheritance, the moneys she had been obliged to\nborrow at an exorbitant rate of interest, here endless contentions\nwith Brawford’s nephews, and the litigation! the injunctions! in\nfact, everything!",
        "“Just think of it, Monsieur Lupin, the bonds are there, in my\nhusband’s office, and if we detach a single coupon, we lose\neverything! They are there, in our safe, and we dare not touch\nthem.”",
        "Monsieur Lupin shivered at the bare idea of his proximity to so\nmuch wealth. Yet he felt quite certain that Monsieur Lupin would\nnever suffer from the same difficulty as his fair hostess who\ndeclared she dare not touch the money.",
        "“Ah! they are there!” he repeated, to himself; “they are there!”",
        "A friendship formed under such circumstances soon led to closer\nrelations. When discreetly questioned, Arsene Lupin confessed his\npoverty and distress. Immediately, the unfortunate young man was\nappointed private secretary to the Imberts, husband and wife, at a\nsalary of one hundred francs a month. He was to come to the house\nevery day and receive orders for his work, and a room on the second\nfloor was set apart as his office. This room was directly over\nMon. Imbert’s office.",
        "Arsene soon realized that his position as secretary was essentially\na sinecure. During the first two months, he had only four\nimportant letters to recopy, and was called only once to Mon.\nImbert’s office; consequently, he had only one opportunity to\ncontemplate, officially, the Imbert safe. Moreover, he noticed\nthat the secretary was not invited to the social functions of the\nemployer. But he did not complain, as he preferred to remain,\nmodestly, in the shade and maintain his peace and freedom.",
        "However, he was not wasting any time. From the beginning, he made\nclandestine visits to Mon. Imbert’s office, and paid his respects\nto the safe, which was hermetically closed. It was an immense\nblock of iron and steel, cold and stern in appearance, which could\nnot be forced open by the ordinary tools of the burglar’s trade.\nBut Arsene Lupin was not discouraged.",
        "“Where force fails, cunning prevails,” he said to himself. “The\nessential thing is to be on the spot when the opportunity occurs.\nIn the meantime, I must watch and wait.”",
        "He made immediately some preliminary preparations. After careful\nsoundings made upon the floor of his room, he introduced a lead\npipe which penetrated the ceiling of Mon. Imbert’s office at a\npoint between the two screeds of the cornice. By means of this\npipe, he hoped to see and hear what transpired in the room below.",
        "Henceforth, he passed his days stretched at full length upon the\nfloor. He frequently saw the Imberts holding a consultation in\nfront of the safe, investigating books and papers. When they\nturned the combination lock, he tried to learn the figures and the\nnumber of turns they made to the right and left. He watched their\nmovements; he sought to catch their words. There was also a key\nnecessary to complete the opening of the safe. What did they do\nwith it? Did they hide it?",
        "One day, he saw them leave the room without locking the safe. He\ndescended the stairs quickly, and boldly entered the room. But\nthey had returned.",
        "“Oh! excuse me,” said, “I made a mistake in the door.”",
        "“Come in, Monsieur Lupin, come in,” cried Madame Imbert, “are you\nnot at home here? We want your advice. What bonds should we sell?\nThe foreign securities or the government annuities?”",
        "“But the injunction?” said Lupin, with surprise.",
        "“Oh! it doesn’t cover all the bonds.”",
        "She opened the door of the safe and withdrew a package of bonds.\nBut her husband protested.",
        "“No, no, Gervaise, it would be foolish to sell the foreign bonds.\nThey are going up, whilst the annuities are as high as they ever\nwill be. What do you think, my dear friend?”",
        "The dear friend had no opinion; yet he advised the sacrifice of the\nannuities. Then she withdrew another package and, from it, she\ntook a paper at random. It proved to be a three-per-cent annuity\nworth two thousand francs. Ludovic placed the package of bonds in\nhis pocket. That afternoon, accompanied by his secretary, he sold\nthe annuities to a stock-broker and realized forty-six thousand\nfrancs.",
        "Whatever Madame Imbert might have said about it, Arsene Lupin did\nnot feel at home in the Imbert house. On the contrary, his\nposition there was a peculiar one. He learned that the servants\ndid not even know his name. They called him “monsieur.” Ludovic\nalways spoke of him in the same way: “You will tell monsieur. Has\nmonsieur arrived?” Why that mysterious appellation?",
        "Moreover, after their first outburst of enthusiasm, the Imberts\nseldom spoke to him, and, although treating him with the\nconsideration due to a benefactor, they gave him little or no\nattention. They appeared to regard him as an eccentric character\nwho did not like to be disturbed, and they respected his isolation\nas if it were a stringent rule on his part. On one occasion, while\npassing through the vestibule, he heard Madame Imbert say to the\ntwo gentlemen:",
        "“He is such a barbarian!”",
        "“Very well,” he said to himself, “I am a barbarian.”",
        "And, without seeking to solve the question of their strange\nconduct, he proceeded with the execution of his own plans. He had\ndecided that he could not depend on chance, nor on the negligence\nof Madame Imbert, who carried the key of the safe, and who, on\nlocking the safe, invariably scattered the letters forming the\ncombination of the lock. Consequently, he must act for himself.",
        "Finally, and incident precipitated matters; it was the vehement\ncampaign instituted against the Imberts by certain newspapers that\naccused the Imberts of swindling. Arsene Lupin was present at\ncertain family conferences when this new vicissitude was discussed.\nHe decided that if he waited much longer, he would lose everything.\nDuring the next five days, instead of leaving the house about six\no’clock, according to his usual habit, he locked himself in his\nroom. It was supposed that he had gone out. But he was lying on\nthe floor surveying the office of Mon. Imbert. During those five\nevenings, the favorable opportunity that he awaited did not take\nplace. He left the house about midnight by a side door to which he\nheld the key.",
        "But on the sixth day, he learned that the Imberts, actuated by the\nmalevolent insinuations of their enemies, proposed to make an\ninventory of the contents of the safe.",
        "“They will do it to-night,” thought Lupin.",
        "And truly, after dinner, Imbert and his wife retired to the office\nand commenced to examine the books of account and the securities\ncontained in the safe. Thus, one hour after another passed away.\nHe heard the servants go upstairs to their rooms. No one now\nremained on the first floor. Midnight! The Imberts were still at\nwork.",
        "“I must get to work,” murmured Lupin.",
        "He opened his window. It opened on a court. Outside, everything\nwas dark and quiet. He took from his desk a knotted rope, fastened\nit to the balcony in front of his window, and quietly descended as\nfar as the window below, which was that of the of Imbert’s office.\nHe stood upon the balcony for a moment, motionless, with attentive\near and watchful eye, but the heavy curtains effectually concealed\nthe interior of the room. He cautiously pushed on the double\nwindow. If no one had examined it, it ought to yield to the\nslightest pressure, for, during the afternoon, he had so fixed the\nbolt that it would not enter the staple.",
        "The window yielded to his touch. Then, with infinite care, he\npushed it open sufficiently to admit his head. He parted the\ncurtains a few inches, looked in, and saw Mon. Imbert and his wife\nsitting in front of the safe, deeply absorbed in their work and\nspeaking softly to each other at rare intervals.",
        "He calculated the distance between him and them, considered the\nexact movements he would require to make in order to overcome them,\none after the other, before they could call for help, and he was\nabout to rush upon them, when Madame Imbert said:",
        "“Ah! the room is getting quite cold. I am going to bed. And you,\nmy dear?”",
        "He calculated the distance between him and them, considered the\nexact movements he would require to make in order to overcome them,\none after the other, before they could call for help, and he was\nabout to rush upon them, when Madame Imbert said:",
        "“Ah! the room is getting quite cold. I am going to bed. And you,\nmy dear?”",
        "“I shall stay and finish.”",
        "“Finish! Why, that will take you all night.”",
        "“Not at all. An hour, at the most.”",
        "She retired. Twenty minutes, thirty minutes passed. Arsene pushed\nthe window a little farther open. The curtains shook. He pushed\nonce more. Mon. Imbert turned, and, seeing the curtains blown by\nthe wind, he rose to close the window.",
        "There was not a cry, not the trace of struggle. With a few precise\nmoments, and without causing him the least injury, Arsene stunned\nhim, wrapped the curtain about his head, bound him hand and foot,\nand did it all in such a manner that Mon. Imbert had no opportunity\nto recognize his assailant.",
        "Quickly, he approached the safe, seized two packages that he placed\nunder his arm, left the office, and opened the servants’ gate. A\ncarriage was stationed in the street.",
        "“Take that, first--and follow me,” he said to the coachman. He\nreturned to the office, and, in two trips, they emptied the safe.\nThen Arsene went to his own room, removed the rope, and all other\ntraces of his clandestine work.",
        "A few hours later, Arsene Lupin and his assistant examined the\nstolen goods. Lupin was not disappointed, as he had foreseen that\nthe wealth of the Imberts had been greatly exaggerated. It did not\nconsist of hundreds of millions, nor even tens of millions. Yet it\namounted to a very respectable sum, and Lupin expressed his\nsatisfaction.",
        "“Of course,” he said, “there will be a considerable loss when we\ncome to sell the bonds, as we will have to dispose of them\nsurreptitiously at reduced prices. In the meantime, they will rest\nquietly in my desk awaiting a propitious moment.”",
        "Arsene saw no reason why he should not go to the Imbert house the\nnext day. But a perusal of the morning papers revealed this\nstartling fact: Ludovic and Gervaise Imbert had disappeared.",
        "When the officers of the law seized the safe and opened it, they\nfound there what Arsene Lupin had left--nothing.",
        "Such are the facts; and I learned the sequel to them, one day, when\nArsene Lupin was in a confidential mood. He was pacing to and fro\nin my room, with a nervous step and a feverish eye that were\nunusual to him.”",
        "“After all,” I said to him, “it was your most successful venture.”",
        "Without making a direct reply, he said:",
        "“There are some impenetrable secrets connected with that affair;\nsome obscure points that escape my comprehension. For instance:\nWhat caused their flight? Why did they not take advantage of the\nhelp I unconsciously gave them? It would have been so simple to\nsay: `The hundred millions were in the safe. They are no longer\nthere, because they have been stolen.’”",
        "“They lost their nerve.”",
        "“Yes, that is it--they lost their nerve...On the other hand, it\nis true---”",
        "“What is true?”",
        "“Oh! nothing.”",
        "What was the meaning of Lupin’s reticence? It was quite obvious\nthat he had not told me everything; there was something he was\nloath to tell. His conduct puzzled me. It must indeed be a very\nserious matter to cause such a man as Arsene Lupin even a momentary\nhesitation. I threw out a few questions at random.",
        "“Have you seen them since?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“And have you never experienced the slightest degree of pity for\nthose unfortunate people?”",
        "“I!” he exclaimed, with a start.",
        "His sudden excitement astonished me. Had I touched him on a sore\nspot? I continued:",
        "“Of course. If you had not left them alone, they might have been\nable to face the danger, or, at least, made their escape with full\npockets.”",
        "“What do you mean?” he said, indignantly. “I suppose you have an\nidea that my soul should be filled with remorse?”",
        "“Call it remorse or regrets--anything you like---”",
        "“They are not worth it.”",
        "“Have you no regrets or remorse for having stolen their fortune?”",
        "“What fortune?”",
        "“The packages of bonds you took from their safe.”",
        "“Oh! I stole their bonds, did I? I deprived them of a portion of\ntheir wealth? Is that my crime? Ah! my dear boy, you do not know\nthe truth. You never imagined that those bonds were not worth the\npaper they were written on. Those bonds were false--they were\ncounterfeit--every one of them--do you understand? THEY WERE\nCOUNTERFEIT!”",
        "I looked at him, astounded.",
        "“Counterfeit! The four or five millions?”",
        "“Yes, counterfeit!” he exclaimed, in a fit of rage. “Only so many\nscraps of paper! I couldn’t raise a sou on the whole of them! And\nyou ask me if I have any remorse. THEY are the ones who should\nhave remorse and pity. They played me for a simpleton; and I fell\ninto their trap. I was their latest victim, their most stupid\ngull!”",
        "He was affected by genuine anger--the result of malice and wounded\npride. He continued:",
        "“From start to finish, I got the worst of it. Do you know the part\nI played in that affair, or rather the part they made me play?\nThat of Andre Brawford! Yes, my boy, that is the truth, and I\nnever suspected it. It was not until afterwards, on reading the\nnewspapers, that the light finally dawned in my stupid brain.\nWhilst I was posing as his “saviour,” as the gentleman who had\nrisked his life to rescue Mon. Imbert from the clutches of an\nassassin, they were passing me off as Brawford. Wasn’t that\nsplendid? That eccentric individual who had a room on the second\nfloor, that barbarian that was exhibited only at a distance, was\nBrawford, and Brawford was I! Thanks to me, and to the confidence\nthat I inspired under the name of Brawford, they were enabled to\nborrow money from the bankers and other money-lenders. Ha! what an\nexperience for a novice! And I swear to you that I shall profit by\nthe lesson!”",
        "He stopped, seized my arm, and said to me, in a tone of\nexasperation:",
        "“My dear fellow, at this very moment, Gervaise Imbert owes me\nfifteen hundred francs.”",
        "I could not refrain from laughter, his rage was so grotesque. He\nwas making a mountain out of a molehill. In a moment, he laughed\nhimself, and said:",
        "“Yes, my boy, fifteen hundred francs. You must know that I had not\nreceived one sou of my promised salary, and, more than that, she\nhad borrowed from me the sum of fifteen hundred francs. All my\nyouthful savings! And do you know why? To devote the money to\ncharity! I am giving you a straight story. She wanted it for some\npoor people she was assisting--unknown to her husband. And my hard-\nearned money was wormed out of me by that silly pretense! Isn’t it\namusing, hein? Arsene Lupin done out of fifteen hundred francs by\nthe fair lady from whom he stole four millions in counterfeit\nbonds! And what a vast amount of time and patience and cunning I\nexpended to achieve that result! It was the first time in my life\nthat I was played for a fool, and I frankly confess that I was\nfooled that time to the queen’s taste!”",
