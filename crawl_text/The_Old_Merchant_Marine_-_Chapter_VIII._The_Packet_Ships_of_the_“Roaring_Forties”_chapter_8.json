        "It was on the stormy Atlantic, called by sailormen the Western\nOcean, that the packet ships won the first great contest for\nsupremacy and knew no rivals until the coming of the age of steam\nmade them obsolete. Their era antedated that of the clipper and\nwas wholly distinct. The Atlantic packet was the earliest liner:\nshe made regular sailings and carried freight and passengers\ninstead of trading on her owners’ account as was the ancient\ncustom. Not for her the tranquillity of tropic seas and the\nbreath of the Pacific trades, but an almost incessant battle with\nswinging surges and boisterous winds, for she was driven harder\nin all weathers and seasons than any other ships that sailed. In\nsuch battering service as this the lines of the clipper were too\nextremely fine, her spars too tall and slender. The packet was by\nno means slow and if the list of her record passages was superb,\nit was because they were accomplished by masters who would sooner\nlet a sail blow away than take it in and who raced each other\nevery inch of the way.",
        "They were small ships of three hundred to five hundred tons when\nthe famous Black Ball Line was started in 1816. From the first\nthey were the ablest vessels that could be built, full-bodied and\nstoutly rigged. They were the only regular means of communication\nbetween the United States and Europe and were entrusted with the\nmails, specie, government dispatches, and the lives of eminent\npersonages. Blow high, blow low, one of the Black Ball packets\nsailed from New York for Liverpool on the first and sixteenth of\nevery month. Other lines were soon competing--the Red Star and\nthe Swallow Tail out of New York, and fine ships from Boston and\nPhiladelphia. With the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 the\ncommercial greatness of New York was assured, and her Atlantic\npackets increased in size and numbers, averaging a thousand tons\neach in the zenith of their glory.",
        "England, frankly confessing herself beaten and unable to compete\nwith such ships as these, changed her attitude from hostility to\nopen admiration. She surrendered the Atlantic packet trade to\nAmerican enterprise, and British merchantmen sought their gains\nin other waters. The Navigation Laws still protected their\ncommerce in the Far East and they were content to jog at a more\nsedate gait than these weltering packets whose skippers were\nstriving for passages of a fortnight, with the forecastle doors\nnailed fast and the crew compelled to stay on deck from Sandy\nHook to Fastnet Rock.",
        "No blustering, rum-drinking tarpaulin was the captain who sailed\nthe Independence, the Ocean Queen, or the Dreadnought but a man\nvery careful of his manners and his dress, who had been selected\nfrom the most highly educated merchant service in the world. He\nwas attentive to the comfort of his passengers and was presumed\nto have no other duties on deck than to give the proper orders to\nhis first officer and work out his daily reckoning. It was an\nexacting, nerve-racking ordeal, however, demanding a sleepless\nvigilance, courage, and cool judgment of the first order. The\ncompensations were large. As a rule, he owned a share of the ship\nand received a percentage of the freights and passage money. His\nrank when ashore was more exalted than can be conveyed in mere\nwords. Any normal New York boy would sooner have been captain of\na Black Ball packet than President of the United States, and he\nknew by heart the roaring chantey",
        "    It is of a flash packet,\n      A packet of fame.\n    She is bound to New York\n      And the Dreadnought’s her name.\n    She is bound to the west’ard\n      Where the stormy winds blow.\n    Bound away to the west’ard,\n      Good Lord, let her go.",
        "There were never more than fifty of these ships afloat, a\ntrifling fraction of the American deep-water tonnage of that day,\nbut the laurels they won were immortal. Not only did the English\nmariner doff his hat to them, but a Parliamentary committee\nreported in 1837 that “the American ships frequenting the ports\nof England are stated by several witnesses to be superior to\nthose of a similar class among the ships of Great Britain, the\ncommanders and officers being generally considered to be more\ncompetent as seamen and navigators and more uniformly persons of\neducation than the commanders and officers of British ships of a\nsimilar size and class trading from England to America.”",
        "It was no longer a rivalry with the flags of other nations but an\nunceasing series of contests among the packets of the several\nlines, and their records aroused far more popular excitement than\nwhen the great steamers of this century were chipping off the\nminutes, at an enormous coal consumption, toward a five-day\npassage. Theirs were tests of real seamanship, and there were few\ndisasters. The packet captain scorned a towboat to haul him into\nthe stream if the wind served fair to set all plain sail as his\nship lay at her wharf. Driving her stern foremost, he braced his\nyards and swung her head to sea, clothing the masts with soaring\ncanvas amid the farewell cheers of the crowds which lined the\nwaterfront.",
        "A typical match race was sailed between the Black Ball liner\nColumbus, Captain De Peyster, and the Sheridan, Captain Russell,\nof the splendid Dramatic fleet, in 1837. The stake was $10,000 a\nside, put up by the owners and their friends. The crews were\npicked men who were promised a bonus of fifty dollars each for\nwinning. The ships sailed side by side in February, facing the\nwild winter passage, and the Columbus reached Liverpool in the\nremarkable time of sixteen days, two days ahead of the Sheridan.",
        "The crack packets were never able to reel off more than twelve or\nfourteen knots under the most favorable conditions, but they were\nkept going night and day, and some of them maintained their\nschedules almost with the regularity of the early steamers. The\nMontezuma, the Patrick Henry, and the Southampton crossed from\nNew York to Liverpool in fifteen days, and for years the\nIndependence held the record of fourteen days and six hours. It\nremained for the Dreadnought, Captain Samuel Samuels, in 1859, to\nset the mark for packet ships to Liverpool at thirteen days and\neight hours.",
        "Meanwhile the era of the matchless clipper had arrived and it was\none of these ships which achieved the fastest Atlantic passage\never made by a vessel under sail. The James Baines was built for\nEnglish owners to be used in the Australian trade. She was a full\nclipper of 2515 tons, twice the size of the ablest packets, and\nwas praised as “the most perfect sailing ship that ever entered\nthe river Mersey.” Bound out from Boston to Liverpool, she\nanchored after twelve days and six hours at sea.",
        "There was no lucky chance in this extraordinary voyage, for this\nclipper was the work of the greatest American builder, Donald\nMcKay, who at the same time designed the Lightning for the same\nowners. This clipper, sent across the Atlantic on her maiden\ntrip, left in her foaming wake a twenty-four hour run which no\nsteamer had even approached and which was not equaled by the\nfastest express steamers until twenty-five years later when the\ngreyhound Arizona ran eighteen knots in one hour on her trial\ntrip. This is a rather startling statement when one reflects that\nthe Arizona of the Guion line seems to a generation still living\na modern steamer and record-holder. It is even more impressive\nwhen coupled with the fact that, of the innumerable passenger\nsteamers traversing the seas today, only a few are capable of a\nspeed of more than eighteen knots.",
        "This clipper Lightning did her 436 sea miles in one day, or\neighteen and a half knots, better than twenty land miles an hour,\nand this is how the surpassing feat was entered in her log, or\nofficial journal: “March 1. Wind south. Strong gales; bore away\nfor the North Channel, carrying away the foretopsail and lost\njib; hove the log several times and found the ship going through\nthe water at the rate of 18 to 18 1/2 knots; lee rail under water\nand rigging slack. Distance run in twenty-four hours, 436 miles.\"\nThe passage was remarkably fast, thirteen days and nineteen and a\nhalf hours from Boston Light, but the spectacular feature was\nthis day’s work. It is a fitting memorial of the Yankee clipper,\nand, save only a cathedral, the loveliest, noblest fabric ever\nwrought by man’s handiwork.",
        "The clipper, however, was a stranger in the Atlantic and her\nchosen courses were elsewhere. The records made by the James\nBaines and the Lightning were no discredit to the stanch,\nunconquerable packet ships which, year in and year out, held\ntheir own with the steamer lines until just before the Civil War.\nIt was the boast of Captain Samuels that on her first voyage in\n1853 the Dreadnought reached Sandy Hook as the Cunarder Canada,\nwhich had left Liverpool a day ahead of her, was passing in by\nBoston Light. Twice she carried the latest news to Europe, and\nmany seasoned travelers preferred her to the mail steamers.",
        "The masters and officers who handled these ships with such\nmagnificent success were true-blue American seamen, inspired by\nthe finest traditions, successors of the privateersmen of 1812.\nThe forecastles, however, were filled with English, Irish, and\nScandinavians. American lads shunned these ships and, in fact,\nthe ambitious youngster of the coastwise towns began to cease\nfollowing the sea almost a century ago. It is sometimes forgotten\nthat the period during which the best American manhood sought a\nmaritime career lay between the Revolution and the War of 1812.\nThereafter the story became more and more one of American ships\nand less of American sailors, excepting on the quarter-deck.",
        "In later years the Yankee crews were to be found in the ports\nwhere the old customs survived, the long trading voyage, the\ncommunity of interest in cabin and forecastle, all friends and\nneighbors together, with opportunities for profit and\nadvancement. Such an instance was that of the Salem ship George,\nbuilt at Salem in 1814 and owned by the great merchant, Joseph\nPeabody. For twenty-two years she sailed in the East India trade,\nmaking twenty-one round voyages, with an astonishing regularity\nwhich would be creditable for a modern cargo tramp. Her sailors\nwere native-born, seldom more than twenty-one years old, and most\nof them were studying navigation. Forty-five of them became\nshipmasters, twenty of them chief mates, and six second mates.\nThis reliable George was, in short, a nautical training-school of\nthe best kind and any young seaman with the right stuff in him\nwas sure of advancement.",
        "Seven thousand sailors signed articles in the counting-room of\nJoseph Peabody and went to sea in his eighty ships which flew the\nhouse-flag in Calcutta, Canton, Sumatra, and the ports of Europe\nuntil 1844. These were mostly New England boys who followed in\nthe footsteps of their fathers because deep-water voyages were\nstill “adventures” and a career was possible under a system which\nwas both congenial and paternal. Brutal treatment was the rare\nexception. Flogging still survived in the merchant service and\nwas defended by captains otherwise humane, but a skipper, no\nmatter how short-tempered, would be unlikely to abuse a youth\nwhose parents might live on the same street with him and attend\nthe same church.",
        "The Atlantic packets brought a different order of things, which\nwas to be continued through the clipper era. Yankee sailors\nshowed no love for the cold and storms of the Western Ocean in\nthese foaming packets which were remorselessly driven for speed.\nThe masters therefore took what they could get. All the work of\nrigging, sail-making, scraping, painting, and keeping a ship in\nperfect repair was done in port instead of at sea, as was the\nhabit in the China and California clippers, and the lore and\ntraining of the real deep-water sailor became superfluous. The\ncrew of a packet made sail or took it in with the two-fisted\nmates to show them how.",
        "From these conditions was evolved the “Liverpool packet rat,\"\nhairy and wild and drunken, the prey of crimps and dive-keepers\nashore, brave and toughened to every hardship afloat, climbing\naloft in his red shirt, dungaree breeches, and sea-boots, with a\nsnow-squall whistling, the rigging sheathed with ice, and the old\nship burying her bows in the thundering combers. It was the\ndoctrine of his officers that he could not be ruled by anything\nshort of violence, and the man to tame and hammer him was the\n“bucko” second mate, the test of whose fitness was that he could\nwhip his weight in wild cats. When he became unable to maintain\ndiscipline with fists and belaying-pins, he was deposed for a\nbetter man.",
        "Your seasoned packet rat sought the ship with a hard name by\nchoice. His chief ambition was to kick in the ribs or pound\nsenseless some invincible bucko mate. There was provocation\nenough on both sides. Officers had to take their ships to sea and\nstrain every nerve to make a safe and rapid passage with crews\nwhich were drunk and useless when herded aboard, half of them\ngreenhorns, perhaps, who could neither reef nor steer. Brutality\nwas the one argument able to enforce instant obedience among men\nwho respected nothing else. As a class the packet sailors became\nmore and more degraded because their life was intolerable to\ndecent men. It followed therefore that the quarterdeck employed\nincreasing severity, and, as the officer’s authority in this\nrespect was unchecked and unlimited, it was easy to mistake the\nharshest tyranny for wholesome discipline.",
        "Reenforcing the bucko mate was the tradition that the sailor was\na dog, a different human species from the landsman, without laws\nand usages to protect him. This was a tradition which, for\ncenturies, had been fostered in the naval service, and it\nsurvived among merchant sailors as an unhappy anachronism even\ninto the twentieth century, when an American Congress was\nreluctant to bestow upon a seaman the decencies of existence\nenjoyed by the poorest laborer ashore.",
        "It is in the nature of a paradox that the brilliant success of\nthe packet ships in dominating the North Atlantic trade should\nhave been a factor in the decline of the nation’s maritime\nprestige and resources. Through a period of forty years the pride\nand confidence in these ships, their builders, and the men who\nsailed them, was intense and universal. They were a superlative\nproduct of the American genius, which still displayed the\nenergies of a maritime race. On other oceans the situation was no\nless gratifying. American ships were the best and cheapest in the\nworld. The business held the confidence of investors and\ncommanded an abundance of capital. It was assumed, as late as\n1840, that the wooden sailing ship would continue to be the\nsupreme type of deep-water vessel because the United States\npossessed the greatest stores of timber, the most skillful\nbuilders and mechanics, and the ablest merchant navigators. No\nindustry was ever more efficiently organized and conducted.\nAmerican ships were most in demand and commanded the highest\nfreights. The tonnage in foreign trade increased to a maximum of\n904,476 in 1845. There was no doubt in the minds of the shrewdest\nmerchants and owners and builders of the time that Great Britain\nwould soon cease to be the mistress of the seas and must content\nherself with second place.",
        "It was not considered ominous when, in 1838, the Admiralty had\nrequested proposals for a steam service to America. This demand\nwas prompted by the voyages of the Sirius and Great Western,\nwooden-hulled sidewheelers which thrashed along at ten knots’\nspeed and crossed the Atlantic in fourteen to seventeen days.\nThis was a much faster rate than the average time of the Yankee\npackets, but America was unperturbed and showed no interest in\nsteam. In 1839 the British Government awarded an Atlantic mail\ncontract, with an annual subsidy of $425,000 to Samuel Cunard and\nhis associates, and thereby created the most famous of the\nAtlantic steamship companies.",
        "Four of these liners began running in 1840--an event which\nforetold the doom of the packet fleets, though the warning was\nalmost unheeded in New York and Boston. Four years later Enoch\nTrain was establishing a new packet line to Liverpool with the\nlargest, finest ships built up to that time, the Washington\nIrving, Anglo-American, Ocean Monarch, Anglo-Saxon, and Daniel\nWebster. Other prominent shipping houses were expanding their\nservice and were launching noble packets until 1853. Meanwhile\nthe Cunard steamers were increasing in size and speed, and the\nservice was no longer an experiment.",
        "American capital now began to awaken from its dreams, and Edward\nK. Collins, managing owner of the Dramatic line of packets,\ndetermined to challenge the Cunarders at their own game. Aided by\nthe Government to the extent of $385,000 a year as subsidy, he\nput afloat the four magnificent steamers, Atlantic, Pacific,\nBaltic, and Arctic, which were a day faster than the Cunarders in\ncrossing, and reduced the voyage to nine and ten days. The\nCollins line, so auspiciously begun in 1850, and promising to\ngive the United States the supremacy in steam which it had won\nunder sail, was singularly unfortunate and short-lived. The\nArctic and the Pacific were lost at sea, and Congress withdrew\nits financial support after five years. Deprived of this aid, Mr.\nCollins was unable to keep the enterprise afloat in competition\nwith the subsidized Cunard fleet. In this manner and with little\nfurther effort by American interests to compete for the prize,\nthe dominion of the Atlantic passed into British hands.",
        "The packet ships had held on too long. It had been a stirring\nepisode for the passengers to cheer in mid-ocean when the lofty\npyramids of canvas swept grandly by some wallowing steamer and\nleft her far astern, but in the fifties this gallant picture\nbecame less frequent, and a sooty banner of smoke on the horizon\nproclaimed the new era and the obliteration of all the rushing\nlife and beauty of the tall ship under sail. Slow to realize and\nacknowledge defeat, persisting after the steamers were capturing\nthe cabin passenger and express freight traffic, the American\nship-owners could not visualize this profound transformation.\nTheir majestic clippers still surpassed all rivals in the East\nIndia and China trade and were racing around the Horn, making new\nrecords for speed and winning fresh nautical triumphs for the\nStars and Stripes.",
        "This reluctance to change the industrial and commercial habits of\ngenerations of American shipowners was one of several causes for\nthe decadence which was hastened by the Civil War. For once the\nastute American was caught napping by his British cousin, who was\nswayed by no sentimental values and showed greater adaptability\nin adopting the iron steamer with the screw propeller as the\ninevitable successor of the wooden ship with arching topsails.",
        "The golden age of the American merchant marine was that of the\nsquare-rigged ship, intricate, capricious, and feminine in her\nbeauty, with forty nimble seamen in the forecastle, not that of\nthe metal trough with an engine in the middle and mechanics\nsweating in her depths. When the Atlantic packet was compelled to\nabdicate, it was the beginning of the end. After all, her master\nwas the fickle wind, for a slashing outward passage might be\nfollowed by weeks of beating home to the westward. Steadily\nforging ahead to the beat of her paddles or the thrash of her\nscrew, the steamer even of that day was far more dependable than\nthe sailing vessel. The Lightning clipper might run a hundred\nmiles farther in twenty-four hours than ever a steamer had done,\nbut she could not maintain this meteoric burst of speed. Upon the\nheaving surface of the Western Ocean there was enacted over again\nthe fable of the hare and the tortoise.",
        "Most of the famous chanteys were born in the packet service and\nshouted as working choruses by the tars of this Western Ocean\nbefore the chanteyman perched upon a capstan and led the refrain\nin the clipper trade. You will find their origin unmistakable in\nsuch lines as these:",
        "    As I was a-walking down Rotherhite Street,\n      ’Way, ho, blow the man down;\n    A pretty young creature I chanced for to meet,\n      Give me some time to blow the man down.\n    Soon we’ll be in London City,\n      Blow, boys, blow,\n    And see the gals all dressed so pretty,\n      Blow, my bully boys, blow.",
        "Haunting melodies, folk-song as truly as that of the plantation\nnegro, they vanished from the sea with a breed of men who, for\nall their faults, possessed the valor of the Viking and the\nfortitude of the Spartan. Outcasts ashore--which meant to them\nonly the dance halls of Cherry Street and the grog-shops of\nRatcliffe Road--they had virtues that were as great as their\nfailings. Across the intervening years, with a pathos\nindefinable, come the lovely strains of",
        "    Shenandoah, I’ll ne’er forget you,\n      Away, ye rolling river,\n      Till the day I die I’ll love you ever,\n    Ah, ha, we’re bound away.",
