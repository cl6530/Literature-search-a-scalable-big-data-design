        "You may spend pleasant days in this city of Cosenza, doing nothing\nwhatever. But I go there a for set purpose, and bristling with energy. I\ngo there to hunt for a book by a certain Salandra, which was printed on\nthe spot, and which I have not yet been able to find, although I once\ndiscovered it in an old catalogue, priced at 80 grani. Gladly would I\ngive 8000 for it!",
        "The author was a contemporary of that Flying Monk of whom I spoke in\nChapter X, and he belonged to the same religious order. If, in what I\nthen said about the flying monk, there appears to be some trace of light\nfooling in regard to this order and its methods, let amends be made by\nwhat I have to tell about old Salandra, the discovery of whose book is\none of primary importance for the history of English letters. Thus I\nthought at the time; and thus I still think, with all due deference to\ncertain grave and discerning gentlemen, the editors of various English\nmonthlies to whom I submitted a paper on this subject–a paper which\nthey promptly returned with thanks. No; that is not quite correct. One\nof them has kept it; and as six years have passed over our heads, I\npresume he has now acquired a title by “adverse possession.” Much good\nmay it do him!",
        "Had the discovery been mine, I should have endeavoured to hide my light\nunder the proverbial bushel. But it is not mine, and therefore I make\nbold to say that Mr. Bliss Perry, of the “Atlantic Monthly,” knew better\nthan his English colleagues when he published the article from which I\ntake what follows.",
        "“Charles Dunster (’Considerations on Milton’s Early Reading,’ etc.,\n1810) traces the prima stamina of ’Paradise Lost’ to Sylvester’s ’Du\nBartas.’ Masenius, Cedmon, Vendei, and other older writers have also\nbeen named in this connection, while the majority of Milton’s English\ncommentators–and among foreigners Voltaire and Tiraboschi–are inclined\nto regard the ’Adamus Exul’ of Grotius or Andreini’s sacred drama of\n’Adamo’ as the prototype.”",
        "This latter can be consulted in the third volume of Cowper’s ’Milton’\n(1810).",
        "The matter is still unsettled, and in view of the number of recent\nscholars who have interested themselves in it, one is really surprised\nthat no notice has yet been taken of an Italian article which goes far\ntowards deciding this question and proving that the chief source of\n’Paradise Lost’ is the ’Adamo Caduto,’ a sacred tragedy by Serafino\ndella Salandra. The merit of this discovery belongs to Francesco Zicari,\nwhose paper, ’Sulla scoverta dell’ originale italiano da cui Milton\ntrasse il suo poema del paradiso perduto,’ is printed on pages 245\nto 276 in the 1845 volume of the Naples ’Album scientifico-\nartistico-letterario’ now lying before me. It is in the form of\na letter addressed to his friend Francesco Ruffa, a native of\nTropea in Calabria. [Footnote: Zicari contemplated another paper on\nthis subject, but I am unaware whether this was ever published. The\nNeapolitan Minieri-Riccio, who wrote his ’Memorie Storiche’ in 1844,\nspeaks of this article as having been already printed in 1832, but does\nnot say where. This is corroborated by N. Falcone (’Biblioteca\nstorica-topo-grafica della Calabria,’ 2nd ed., Naples, 1846, pp.\n151-154), who gives the same date, and adds that Zicari was the author\nof a work on the district of Fuscaldo. He was born at Paola in Calabria,\nof which he wrote a (manuscript) history, and died in 1846. In this\nMilton article, he speaks of his name being ’unknown in the republic of\nletters.’. He it mentioned by Nicola Leoni (’ Della Magna Grecia,’ vol.\nii, p. 153),]",
        "Salandra, it is true, is named among the writers of sacred tragedies in\nTodd’s ’Milton’ (1809, vol. ii, p. 244), and also by Hayley, but neither\nof them had the curiosity, or the opportunity, to examine his ’Adamo\nCaduto’; Hayley expressly says that he has not seen it. More recent\nworks, such as that of Moers (’De fontibus Paradisi Amissi Miltoniani,’\nBonn, 1860), do not mention Salandra at all. Byse (’Milton on the\nContinent,’ 1903) merely hints at some possible motives for the Allegro\nand the Penseroso.",
        "As to dates, there can be no doubt to whom the priority belongs. The\n’Adamo’ of Salandra was printed at Cosenza in 1647. Richardson thinks\nthat Milton entered upon his ’Paradise Lost’ in 1654, and that it was\nshown, as done, in 1665; D. Masson agrees with this, adding that ’it was\nnot published till two years afterwards.’ The date 1665 is fixed, I\npresume, by the Quaker Elwood’s account of his visit to Milton in the\nautumn of that year, when the poet gave him the manuscript to read; the\ntwo years’ delay in publication may possibly have been due to the\nconfusion occasioned by the great plague and fire of London.",
        "The castigation bestowed upon Lauder by Bishop Douglas, followed, as it\nwas, by a terrific ’back-hander’ from the brawny arm of Samuel Johnson,\ninduces me to say that Salandra’s ’Adamo Caduto,’ though extremely\nrare–so rare that neither the British Museum nor the Paris Bibliotheque\nNationale possesses a copy–is not an imaginary book; I have had it in\nmy hands, and examined it at the Naples Biblioteca Nazionale; it is a\nsmall octavo of 251 pages (not including twenty unnumbered ones, and\nanother one at the end for correction of misprints); badly printed and\nbearing all the marks of genuineness, with the author’s name and the\nyear and place of publication clearly set forth on the title-page. I\nhave carefully compared Zicari’s references to it, and quotations from\nit with the original. They are correct, save for a few insignificant\nverbal discrepancies which, so far as I can judge, betray no indication\nof an attempt on his part to mislead the reader, such as using the word\ntromba (trumpet) instead of Salandra’s term sambuca (sackbut). And\nif further proof of authenticity be required, I may note that the ’Adamo\nCaduto’ of Salandra is already cited in old bibliographies like Toppi’s\n’Biblioteca Napoletana’ (1678), or that of Joannes a S. Antonio\n(’Biblioteca universa Franciscana, etc.,’ Madrid, 1732-1733, vol. iii,\np. 88). It appears to have been the only literary production of its\nauthor, who was a Franciscan monk and is described as ’Preacher, Lector\nand Definitor of the Reformed Province of Basilicata.’",
        "We may take it, then, that Salandra was a real person, who published a\nmystery called ’Adamo Caduto’ in 1647; and I will now, without further\npreamble, extract from Zicari’s article as much as may be sufficient to\nshow ground for his contention that Milton’s ’Paradise Lost’ is a\ntransfusion, in general and in particular, of this same mystery.",
        "Salandra’s central theme is the Universe shattered by the disobedience\nof the First Man, the origin of our unhappiness and sins. The same with\nMilton.",
        "Salandra’s chief personages are God and His angels; the first man and\nwoman; the serpent; Satan and his angels. The same with Milton.",
        "Salandra, at the opening of his poem (the prologue), sets forth his\nargument, and dwells upon the Creative Omnipotence and his works. The\nsame with Milton.",
        "Salandra then describes the council of the rebel angels, their fall from\nheaven into a desert and sulphurous region, their discourses. Man is\nenviously spoken of, and his fall by means of stratagem decided upon; it\nis resolved to reunite in council in Pandemonium or the Abyss, where\nmeasures may be adopted to the end that man may become the enemy of God\nand the prey of hell. The same with Milton.",
        "Salandra personifies Sin and Death, the latter being the child of the\nformer. The same with Milton.",
        "Salandra describes Omnipotence foreseeing the effects of the temptation\nand fall of man, and preparing his redemption. The same with Milton.",
        "Salandra depicts the site of Paradise and the happy life there. The same\nwith Milton.",
        "Salandra sets forth the miraculous creation of the universe and of man,\nand the virtues of the forbidden fruit. The same with Milton.",
        "Salandra reports the conversation between Eve and the Serpent; the\neating of the forbidden fruit and the despair of our first parents. The\nsame with Milton.",
        "Salandra describes the joy of Death at the discomfiture of Eve; the\nrejoicings in hell; the grief of Adam; the flight of our first parents,\ntheir shame and repentance. The same with Milton.",
        "Salandra anticipates the intercession of the Redeemer, and the overthrow\nof Sin and Death; he dwells upon the wonders of the Creation, the murder\nof Abel by his brother Cain, and other human ills; the vices of the\nAntediluvians, due to the fall of Adam; the infernal gift of war. The\nsame with Milton.",
        "Salandra describes the passion of Jesus Christ, and the comforts which\nAdam and Eve receive from the angel who announces the coming of the\nMessiah; lastly, their departure from the earthly paradise. The same\nwith Milton.",
        "So much for the general scheme of both poems. And now for a few\nparticular points of resemblance, verbal and otherwise.",
        "The character of Milton’s Satan, with the various facets of pride, envy,\nvindictiveness, despair, and impenitence which go to form that\nharmonious whole, are already clearly mapped out in the Lucifero of\nSalandra. For this statement, which I find correct, Zicari gives chapter\nand verse, but it would take far too long to set forth the matter in\nthis place. The speeches of Lucifero, to be sure, read rather like a\ncaricature–it must not be forgotten that Salandra was writing for\nlower-class theatrical spectators, and not for refined readers–but the\nelements which Milton has utilized are already there.",
        "Here is a coincidence:",
        "Here we may reign secure . . .",
        "Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.",
        "MILTON (i, 258)",
        ". . . . Qui propria voglia, Son capo, son qui duce, son\nlor Prence.",
        "SALANDRA (p. 49).",
        "And another:",
        "Milton’s Terror is partially taken from the Megera of the Italian poet.\nThe ’grisly Terror’ threatens Satan (ii, 699), and the office of Megera,\nin Salandra’s drama, is exactly the same–that is, to threaten and\nchastise the rebellious spirit, which she does very effectually (pages\n123-131). The identical monsters–Cerberus, Hydras, and Chimseras–are\nfound in their respective abodes, but Salandra does not content himself\nwith these three; his list includes such a mixed assemblage of creatures\nas owls, basilisks, dragons, tigers, bears, crocodiles, sphynxes,\nharpies, and panthers. Terror moves with dread rapidity:",
        "and so does Megera:",
        "Both Milton and Salandra use the names of the gods of antiquity for\ntheir demons, but the narrative epic of the English poet naturally\npermitted of far greater prolixity and variety in this respect. A most\ncurious parallelism exists between Milton’s Belial and that of Salandra.\nBoth are described as luxurious, timorous, slothful, and scoffing, and\nthere is not the slightest doubt that Milton has taken over these mixed\nattributes from the Italian. [Footnote: This is one of the occasions in\nwhich Zicari appears, at first sight, to have stretched a point in order\nto improve his case, because, in the reference he gives, it is Behemoth,\nand not Belial, who speaks of himielf as cowardly (imbelle). But in\nanother place Lucifer applies this designation to Belial as well,]",
        "The words of Milton’s Beelzebub (ii, 368):",
        "are copied from those of the Italian Lucifero (p. 52):",
        "Regarding the creation of the world, Salandra asks (p. 11):",
        "which is thus echoed by Milton (vii, 112):",
        "There is a considerable resemblance between the two poets in their\ndescriptions of Paradise and of its joys. In both poems, too, Adam warns\nhis spouse of her frailty, and in the episode of Eve’s meeting with the\nserpent there are no less than four verbal coincidences. Thus Salandra\nwrites (p. 68):",
        "and Milton transcribes it as follows (ix, 517-554):",
        "Altogether, Zicari has observed that Rolli, although unacquainted with\nthe ’Adamo Caduto,’ has sometimes inadvertently hit upon the same words\nin his Italian translation of Milton which Salandra had used before him.",
        "Eve’s altered complexion after the eating of the forbidden fruit is\nnoted by both poets:",
        "Torbata ne la faccia? Non sei quella",
        "Qual ti lasciai contenta . . .–SALANDRA (p. 89).",
        "Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told;",
        "But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed. –MILTON (ix, 886).",
        "only with this difference, that the Italian Eve adds a half-lie by way\nof explaining the change:",
        "In both poems Sin and Death reappear on the scene after the transgression.",
        "The flight of Innocence from earth; the distempered lust which dominates\nover Adam and Eve after the Fall; the league of Sin and Death to rule\nhenceforward over the world; the pathetic lament of Adam regarding his\nmisfortune and the evils in store for his progeny; his noble sentiment,\nthat none can withdraw himself from the all-seeing eye of God–all these\nare images which Milton has copied from Salandra.",
        "Adam’s state of mind, after the fall, is compared by Salandra to a boat\ntossed by impetuous winds (p. 228):",
        "which is thus paraphrased in Milton (ix, 1122):",
        "Here is a still more palpable adaptation:",
        "After the Fall, according to Salandra, vacillo la terra (i), geme\n(2), e pianse (3), rumoreggiano i tuoni (4), accompagnati da\ngrandini (5), e dense nevi (6), (pp. 138, 142, 218). Milton\ntranslates this as follows: Earth trembled from her entrails (1), and\nnature gave a second groan (2); sky loured and, muttering thunders (4),\nsome sad drops wept (3), the winds, armed with ice and snow (6) and hail\n(5). (’Paradise Lost,’ ix, 1000, x. 697).",
        "Here is another translation:",
        "It is not to my purpose to do Zicari’s work over again, as this would\nentail a complete translation of his long article (it contains nearly\nten thousand words), to which, if the thing is to be done properly, must\nbe appended Salandra’s ’Adamo,’ in order that his quotations from it can\nbe tested. I will therefore refer to the originals those who wish to go\ninto the subject more fully, warning them, en passant, that they may\nfind the task of verification more troublesome than it seems, owing to a\nstupid mistake on Zicari’s part. For in his references to Milton, he\nclaims (p. 252) to use an 1818 Venice translation of the ’Paradise Lost’\nby Rolli. Now Rolli’s ’Paradiso Perduto’ is a well-known work which was\nissued in many editions in London, Paris, and Italy throughout the\neighteenth century. But I cannot trace this particular one of Venice,\nand application to many of the chief libraries of Italy has convinced me\nthat it does not exist, and that 1818 must be a misprint for some other\nyear. The error would be of no significance if Zicari had referred to\nRolli’s ’Paradiso’ by the usual system of cantos and lines, but he\nrefers to it by pages, and the pagination differs in every one of the\neditions of Rolli which have passed through my hands. Despite every\neffort, I have not been able to hit upon the precise one which Zicari\nhad in mind, and if future students are equally unfortunate, I wish them\njoy of their labours. [Footnote: Let me take this opportunity of\nexpressing my best thanks to Baron E. Tortora Brayda, of the Naples\nBiblioteca Nazionale, who has taken an infinity of trouble in this\nmatter.]",
        "These few extracts, however, will suffice to show that, without\nSalandra’s ’Adamo,’ the ’Paradise Lost,’ as we know it, would not be in\nexistence; and that Zicari’s discovery is therefore one of primary\nimportance for English letters, although it would be easy to point out\ndivergencies between the two works–divergencies often due to the\nvarying tastes and feelings of a republican Englishman and an Italian\nCatholic, and to the different conditions imposed by an epic and a\ndramatic poem. Thus, in regard to this last point, Zicari has already\nnoted (p. 270) that Salandra’s scenic acts were necessarily reproduced\nin the form of visions by Milton, who could not avail himself of the\nmechanism of the drama for this purpose. Milton was a man of the world,\ntraveller, scholar, and politician; but it will not do for us to insist\ntoo vehemently upon the probable mental inferiority of the Calabrian\nmonk, in view of the high opinion which Milton seems to have had of his\ntalents. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. The ’Adamo\nCaduto,’ of course, is only one of a series of similar works concerning\nwhich a large literature has now grown up, and it might not be difficult\nto prove that Salandra was indebted to some previous writer for those\nwords and phrases which he passed on to the English poet.",
        "But where did Milton become acquainted with this tragedy? It was at\nNaples, according to Cowper (’Milton,’ vol. iii, p. 206), that the\nEnglish poet may first have entertained the idea of ’the loss of\nparadise as a subject peculiarly fit for poetry.’ He may well have\ndiscussed sacred tragedies, like those of Andreini, with the Marquis\nManso. But Milton had returned to England long before Salandra’s poem\nwas printed; nor can Manso have sent him a copy of it, for he died in\n1645–two years before its publication–and Zicari is thus mistaken in\nassuming (p. 245) that Milton became acquainted with it in the house of\nthe Neapolitan nobleman. Unless, therefore, we take for granted that\nManso was intimate with the author Salandra–he knew most of his\nliterary countrymen–and sent or gave to Milton a copy of the manuscript\nof ’Adamo’ before it was printed, or that Milton was personally\nfamiliar with Salandra, we may conclude that the poem was forwarded to\nhim from Italy by some other friend, perhaps by some member of the\nAccademia, degli Oziosi which Manso had founded.",
        "A chance therefore seems to have decided Milton; Salandra’s tragedy fell\ninto his hands, and was welded into the epic form which he had designed\nfor Arthur the Great, even as, in later years, a chance question on the\npart of Elwood led to his writing ’Paradise Regained.’ [Footnote: Thou\nhast said much of Paradise Lost, but what hast thou to say of Paradise\nFound? He made no answer, but sat some time in a muse. . . .]",
        "For this poem there were not so many models handy as for the other, but\nMilton has written too little to enable us to decide how far its\ninferiority to the earlier epic is due to this fact, and how far to the\ninherent inertia of its subject-matter. Little movement can be contrived\nin a mere dialogue such as ’Paradise Regained ’; it lacks the grandiose\nmise-en-scene and the shifting splendours of the greater epic; the\nstupendous figure of the rebellious archangel, the true hero of\n’Paradise Lost,’ is here dwarfed into a puny, malignant sophist; nor is\nthe final issue in the later poem even for a moment in doubt–a\nserious defect from an artistic point of view. Jortin holds its peculiar\nexcellence to be ’artful sophistry, false reasoning, set off in the most\nspecious manner, and refuted by the Son of God with strong unaffected\neloquence’; merits for which Milton needed no original of any kind, as\nhis own lofty religious sentiments, his argumentative talents and long\nexperience of political pamphleteering, stood him in good stead. Most of\nus must have wondered how it came about that Milton could not endure to\nhear ’Paradise Lost’ preferred to ’Paradise Regained,’ in view of the\nvery apparent inferiority of the latter. If we had known what Milton\nknew, namely, to how large an extent ’Paradise Lost’ was not the child\nof his own imagination, and therefore not so precious in his eyes as\n’Paradise Regained,’ we might have understood his prejudice.",
        "Certain parts of ’Paradise Lost’ are drawn, as we all know, from other\nItalian sources, from Sannazario, Ariosto, Guarini, Bojardo, and others.\nZicari who, it must be said, has made the best of his case, will have it\nthat the musterings and battles of the good and evil angels are copied\nfrom the ’Angeleide’ of Valvasone published at Milan in 1590. But G.\nPolidori, who has reprinted the ’Angeleide’ in his Italian version of\nMilton (London, 1840), has gone into this matter and thinks otherwise.\nThese devil-and-angel combats were a popular theme at the time, and\nthere is no reason why the English poet should copy continental writers\nin such descriptions, which necessarily have a common resemblance. The\nMarquis Manso was very friendly with the poets Tasso and Marino, and it\nis also to be remarked that entire passages in ’Paradise Lost’ are\ncopied, totidem verbis, from the writings of these two, Manso having\nno doubt drawn Milton’s attention to their beauties. In fact, I am\ninclined to think that Manso’s notorious enthusiasm for the warlike\nepic of Tasso may first of all have diverted Milton from purely pastoral\nideals and inflamed him with the desire of accomplishing a similar feat,\nwhence the well-known lines in Milton’s Latin verses to this friend,\nwhich contain the first indication of such a design on his part. Even\nthe familiar invocation, ’Hail, wedded Love,’ is bodily drawn from one\nof Tasso’s letters (see Newton’s ’Milton,’ 1773, vol. i, pp. 312, 313).",
        "It has been customary to speak of these literary appropriations as\n’imitations ’; but whoever compares them with the originals will find\nthat many of them are more correctly termed translations. The case, from\na literary-moral point of view, is different as regards ancient writers,\nand it is surely idle to accuse Milton, as has been done, of pilferings\nfrom Aeschylus or Ovid. There is no such thing as robbing the classics.\nThey are our literary fathers, and what they have left behind them is\nour common heritage; we may adapt, borrow, or steal from them as much as\nwill suit our purpose; to acknowledge such ’thefts’ is sheer pedantry\nand ostentation. But Salandra and the rest of them were Milton’s\ncontemporaries. It is certainly an astonishing fact that no scholar of\nthe stamp of Thyer was acquainted with the ’Adamo Caduto’; and it says\nmuch for the isolation of England that, at a period when poems on the\nsubject of paradise lost were being scattered broadcast in Italy and\nelsewhere–when, in short, all Europe was ringing with the doleful\nhistory of Adam and Eve–Milton could have ventured to speak of\nhis work as ’Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyma’–an amazing\nverse which, by the way, is literally transcribed out of Ariosto\n(’Cosa, non detta in prosa mai, ne in rima’). But even now the\nacquaintance of the British public with the productions of continental\nwriters is superficial and spasmodic, and such was the ignorance of\nEnglish scholars of this earlier period, that Birch maintained that\nMilton’s drafts, to be referred to presently, indicated his intention of\nwriting an opera (!); while as late as 1776 the poet Mickle,\nnotwithstanding Voltaire’s authority, questioned the very existence of\nAndreini, who has written thirty different pieces.",
        "Some idea of the time when Salandra’s tragedy reached Milton might be\ngained if we knew the date of his manuscript projects for ’Paradise\nLost’ and other writings which are preserved at Cambridge. R. Garnett\n(’Life of Milton,’ 1890, p. 129) supposes these drafts to date from\nabout 1640 to 1642, and I am not sufficiently learned in Miltonian lore\nto controvert or corroborate in a general way this assertion. But the\ndate must presumably be pushed further forward in the case of the\nskeletons for ’Paradise Lost,’ which are modelled to a great extent upon\nSalandra’s ’Adamo’ of 1647, though other compositions may also have been\npresent before Milton’s mind, such as that mentioned on page 234 of the\nsecond volume of Todd’s ’Milton,’ from which he seems to have drawn the\nhint of a ’prologue spoken by Moses.’",
        "Without going into the matter exhaustively, I will only say that from\nthese pieces it is clear that Milton’s primary idea was to write, like\nSalandra, a sacred tragedy upon this theme, and not an epic. These\ndrafts also contain a chorus, such as Salandra has placed in his drama,\nand a great number of mutes, who do not figure in the English epic, but\nwho reappear in the ’Adamo Caduto’ and all similar works. Even Satan is\nhere designated as Lucifer, in accordance with the Italian Lucifero; and\nat the end of one of Milton’s drafts we read ’at last appears Mercy,\ncomforts him, promises the Messiah, etc.,’ which is exactly what\nSalandra’s Misericordia (Mercy) does in the same place.",
        "Milton no doubt kept on hand many loose passages of poetry, both\noriginal and borrowed, ready to be worked up into larger pieces; all\npoets are smothered in odd scraps of verse and lore which they ’fit in’\nas occasion requires; and it is therefore quite possible that some\nfragments now included in ’Paradise Lost’ may have been complete before\nthe ’Adamo Caduto’ was printed. I am referring, more especially, to\nSatan’s address to the sun, which Philips says was written before the\ncommencement of the epic.",
        "Admitting Philips to be correct, I still question whether this\ninvocation was composed before Milton’s visit to Naples; and if it was,\nthe poet may well have intended it for some other of the multitudinous\nworks which these drafts show him to have been revolving in his mind, or\nfor none of them in particular.",
        "De Quincey rightly says that Addison gave the initial bias in favour of\n’Paradise Lost’ to the English national mind, which has thenceforward\nshrunk, as Addison himself did, from a dispassionate contemplation of\nits defects; the idea being, I presume, that a ’divine poem’ in a manner\ndisarmed rational criticism. And, strange to say, even the few faults\nwhich earlier scholars did venture to point out in Milton’s poem will be\nfound in that of Salandra. There is the same superabundance of allegory;\nthe same confusion of spirit and matter among the supernatural persons;\nthe same lengthy astronomical treatise; the same personification of Sin\nand Death; the same medley of Christian and pagan mythology; the same\ntedious historico-theological disquisition at the end of both poems.",
        "For the rest, it is to be hoped that we have outgrown our fastidiousness\non some of these points. Theological fervour has abated, and in a work\nof the pure imagination, as ’Paradise Lost’ is now–is it\nnot?–considered to be, there is nothing incongruous or offensive in an\namiable commingling of Semitic and Hellenic deities after the approved\nItalian recipe; nor do a few long words about geography or science\ndisquiet us any more. Milton was not writing for an uncivilized mob, and\nhis occasional displays of erudition will represent to a cultured person\nonly those breathing spaces so refreshing in all epic poetry. That\nMilton’s language is saturated with Latinisms and Italianisms is\nperfectly true. His English may not have been good enough for his\ncontemporaries. But it is quite good enough for us. That ’grand manner’\nwhich Matthew Arnold claimed for Milton, that sustained pitch of kingly\nelaboration and fullness, is not wholly an affair of high moral tone; it\nresults in part from the humbler ministrations of words happily\nchosen–from a felicitous alloy of Mediterranean grace and Saxon mettle.\nFor, whether consciously or not, we cannot but be influenced by the\ncolour-effects of mere words, that arouse in us definite but\nindefinable moods of mind. To complain of the foreign phraseology and\nturns of thought in ’Paradise Lost’ would be the blackest ingratitude\nnowadays, seeing that our language has become enriched by steady gleams\nof pomp and splendour due, in large part, to the peculiar lustre of\nMilton’s comely importations.",
