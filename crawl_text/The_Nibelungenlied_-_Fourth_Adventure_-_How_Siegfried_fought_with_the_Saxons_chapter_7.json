        "Now come wondrous tidings / to King Gunther’s land,\nBy messengers brought hither / from far upon command\nOf knights unknown who harbored / against him secret hate.\nWhen there was heard the story, / at heart in sooth the grief was great.",
        "140",
        "Of these I now will tell you: / There was King Luedeger\nFrom out the land of Saxons, / a mighty warrior,\nAnd eke from land of Denmark / Luedegast the king:\nWhene’er they rode to battle / went they with mighty following.",
        "141",
        "Come were now their messengers / to the land of Burgundy,\nSent forth by these foemen / in proud hostility.\nThen asked they of the strangers / what tidings they did bring:\nAnd when they heard it, straightway / led them to court before the king.",
        "142",
        "Then spake to them King Gunther: / “A welcome, on my word.\nWho ’tis that send you hither, / that have I not yet heard:\nNow shall ye let me know it,\" / spake the monarch keen.\nThen dreaded they full sorely / to see King Gunther’s angry mien.",
        "143",
        "“Wilt them, O king, permit us / the tidings straight to tell\nThat we now have brought thee, / no whit will we conceal,\nBut name thee both our masters / who us have hither sent:\nLuedegast and Luedeger, / –to waste thy land is their intent.",
        "144",
        "“Their hate hast thou incurred, / and thou shalt know in sooth\nThat high enraged against thee / are the monarchs both.\nTheir hosts they will lead hither / to Worms upon the Rhine;\nThey’re helped by thanes full many– / of this put off all doubts of\n      thine.",
        "145",
        "“Within weeks a dozen / their march will they begin;\nAnd if thy friends be valiant, / let that full quick be seen,\nTo help thee keep in safety / thy castles and thy land:\nFull many a shield and helmet / shall here be cleft by warrior’s hand.",
        "146",
        "“Or wilt thou with them parley, / so let it quick be known,\nBefore their hosts so mighty / of warlike men come down\nTo Worms upon Rhine river / sad havoc here to make,\nWhereby must death most certain / many a gallant knight o’ertake.”",
        "147",
        "“Bide ye now the meanwhile,\" / the king did answer kind,\n“Till I take better counsel; / then shall ye know my mind.\nHave I yet warriors faithful, / from these I’ll naught conceal,\nBut to my friends I’ll straightway / these warlike tidings strange\n      reveal.”",
        "148",
        "The lordly Gunther wondered / thereat and troubled sore,\nAs he the message pondered / in heart and brooded o’er.\nHe sent to fetch grim Hagen / and others of his men,\nAnd bade likewise in hurry / to court bring hither Gernot then.",
        "149",
        "Thus at his word his trusted / advisers straight attend.\nHe spake: “Our land to harry / foes all unknown will send\nOf men a mighty army; / a grievous wrong is this.\nSmall cause have we e’er given / that they should wish us aught amiss.”",
        "150",
        "“Our swords ward such things from us,\" / Gernot then said;\n“Since but the fated dieth, / so let all such lie dead.\nWherefore I’ll e’er remember / what honor asks of me:\nWhoe’er hath hate against us / shall ever here right welcome be.”",
        "151",
        "Then spake the doughty Hagen: / “Methinks ’twould scarce be good;\nLuedegast and Luedeger / are men of wrathful mood.\nHelp can we never summon, / the days are now so few.\"\nSo spake the keen old warrior, / “’Twere well Siegfried the tidings\n      knew.”",
        "152",
        "The messengers in the borough / were harbored well the while,\nAnd though their sight was hateful, / in hospitable style\nAs his own guests to tend them / King Gunther gave command,\nTill ’mongst his friends he learned / who by him in his need would\n      stand.",
        "153",
        "The king was filled with sorrow / and his heart was sad.\nThen saw his mournful visage / a knight to help full glad,\nWho could not well imagine / what ’twas that grieved him so.\nThen begged he of King Gunther / the tale of this his grief to know.",
        "154",
        "“To me it is great wonder,\" / said Siegfried to the king,\n“How thou of late hast changed / to silent sorrowing\nThe joyous ways that ever / with us thy wont have been.\"\nThen unto him gave answer / Gunther the full stately thane:",
        "155",
        "“’Tis not to every person / I can the burden say\nThat ever now in secret / upon my heart doth weigh:\nTo well-tried friends and steady / are told our inmost woes.\"\n–Siegfried at first was pallid, / but soon his blood like fire up-rose.",
        "156",
        "He spake unto the monarch: / “To thee I’ve naught denied.\nAll ills that now do threaten / I’ll help to turn aside.\nAnd if but friends thou seekest, / of them the first I’ll be,\nAnd trow I well with honor / till death to serve thee faithfully.”",
        "157",
        "“God speed thee well, Sir Siegfried, / for this thy purpose fair:\nAnd though such help in earnest / thy arm should render ne’er,\nYet do I joy at hearing / thou art so true to me.\nAnd live I yet a season, / right heartily repaid ’twill be.",
        "158",
        "“Know will I also let thee / wherefore I sorrowing stand.\nThrough messengers from my foemen / have tidings reached my land\nThat they with hosts of warriors / will ride my country o’er;\nSuch thing to us did never / thanes of any land before.”",
        "159",
        "“Small cause is that for grieving,\" / said then Siegfried;\n“But calm thy troubled spirit / and hearken to my rede:\nLet me for thee acquire / honor and vantage too,\nAnd bid thou now assemble / for service eke thy warriors true.",
        "160",
        "“And had thy mighty enemies / to help them now at hand\nGood thanes full thirty thousand, / against them all I’d stand,\nHad I but one good thousand: / put all thy trust in me.\"\nThen answered him King Gunther: / “Thy help shall full requited be.”",
        "161",
        "“Then bid for me to summon / a thousand of thy men,\nSince I now have with me / of all my knightly train\nNone but twelve knights only; / then will I guard thy land.\nFor thee shall service faithful / be done alway by Siegfried’s hand.",
        "162",
        "“Herein shall help us Hagen / and eke Ortwein,\nDankwart and Sindold, / those trusted knights of thine;\nAnd with us too shall journey / Volker, the valiant man;\nThe banner he shall carry: / bestow it better ne’er I can.",
        "163",
        "“Back to their native country / the messengers may go;\nThey’ll see us there right quickly, / let them full surely know,\nSo that all our castles / peace undisturbed shall have.\"\nThen bade the king to summon / his friends with all their warriors brave.",
        "164",
        "To court returned the heralds / King Luedeger had sent,\nAnd on their journey homeward / full joyfully they went.\nKing Gunther gave them presents / that costly were and good,\nAnd granted them safe convoy; / whereat they were of merry mood.",
        "165",
        "“Tell ye my foes,” spake Gunther, / “when to your land ye come,\nThan making journeys hither / they better were at home;\nBut if they still be eager / to make such visit here,\nUnless my friends forsake me, / cold in sooth shall be their cheer.”",
        "166",
        "Then for the messengers / rich presents forth they bore,\nWhereof in sooth to give them / Gunther had goodly store:\nAnd they durst not refuse them / whom Luedeger had sent.\nLeave then they took immediate, / and homeward joyfully they went.",
        "167",
        "When to their native Denmark / the messengers returned,\nAnd the king Luedegast / the answer too had learned,\nThey at the Rhine had sent him, / –when that to him was told,\nHis wrath was all unbounded / to have reply in words so bold.",
        "168",
        "’Twas said their warriors numbered / many a man full keen:\n“There likewise among them / with Gunther have we seen\nOf Netherland a hero, / the same that Siegfried hight.\"\nKing Luedegast was grieved, / when he their words had heard aright.",
        "169",
        "When throughout all Denmark / the tidings quick spread o’er,\nThen in hot haste they summoned / helpers all the more,\nSo that King Luedegast, / ’twixt friends from far and near,\nHad knights full twenty thousand / all furnished well with shield and\n      spear.",
        "170",
        "Then too his men did summon / of Saxony Luedeger,\nTill they good forty thousand, / and more, had gathered there,\nWith whom to make the journey / ’gainst the land of Burgundy.\n–At home likewise the meanwhile / King Gunther had sent forth decree",
        "171",
        "Mighty men to summon / of his own and brothers twain,\nWho against the foemen / would join the armed train.\nIn haste they made them ready, / for right good cause they had.\nAmongst them must thereafter / full many a noble thane lie dead.",
        "172",
        "To march they quick made ready. / And when they thence would fare,\nThe banner to the valiant / Volker was given to bear,\nAs they began the journey / from Worms across the Rhine;\nStrong of arm grim Hagen / was chosen leader of the line.",
        "173",
        "With them there rode Sindold / and eke the keen Hunold\nWho oft at hands of Gunther / had won rewards of gold;\nDankwart, Hagen’s brother, / and Ortwein beside,\nWho all could well with honor / in train of noble warriors ride.",
        "174",
        "“King Gunther,” spake then Siegfried, / “stay thou here at home;\nSince now thy knights so gallant / with me will gladly come,\nRest thou here with fair ladies, / and be of merry mood:\nI trow we’ll keep in safety / thy land and honor as we should.",
        "175",
        "“And well will I see to it / that they at home remain,\nWho fain would ride against thee / to Worms upon the Rhine.\nAgainst them straight we’ll journey / into their land so far\nThat they’ll be meeker minded / who now such haughty vaunters are.”",
        "176",
        "Then from the Rhine through Hesse / the hosts of knights rode on\nToward the land of Saxons, / where battle was anon.\nWith fire and sword they harried / and laid the country waste,\nSo that both the monarchs / full well the woes of war did taste.",
        "177",
        "When came they to the border / the train-men onward pressed.\nWith thought of battle-order / Siegfried the thanes addressed:\n“Who now shall guard our followers / from danger in the rear?\"\nIn sooth like this the Saxons / in battle worsted never were.",
        "178",
        "Then said they: “On the journey / the men shall guarded be\nBy the valiant Dankwart, / –a warrior swift is he;\nSo shall we lose the fewer / by men of Luedeger.\nLet him and Ortwein with him / be chosen now to guard the rear.”",
        "179",
        "Spake then the valiant Siegfried: / “Myself will now ride on,\nAnd against our enemies / will keep watch in the van,\nTill I aright discover / where they perchance may be.\"\nThe son of fair Queen Siegelind / did arm him then immediately.",
        "180",
        "The folk he left to Hagen / when ready to depart,\nAnd as well to Gernot, / a man of dauntless heart.\nInto the land of Saxons / alone he rode away,\nAnd by his hand was severed / many a helmet’s band that day.",
        "181",
        "He found a mighty army / that lay athwart the plain,\nSmall part of which outnumbered / all those in his own train:\nFull forty thousand were they / or more good men of might.\nThe hero high in spirit / saw right joyfully the sight.",
        "182",
        "Then had eke a warrior / from out the enemy\nTo guard the van gone forward, / all armed cap-a-pie.\nHim saw the noble Siegfried, / and he the valiant man;\nEach one straight the other / to view with angry mien began.",
        "183",
        "Who he was I’ll tell you / that rode his men before,\n–A shield of gold all shining / upon his arm he bore–\nIn sooth it was King Luedegast / who there the van did guard.\nStraightway the noble Siegfried / full eagerly against him spurred.",
        "184",
        "Now singled out for combat / him, too, had Luedegast.\nThen full upon each other / they spurred their chargers fast,\nAs on their shields they lowered / their lances firm and tight,\nWhereat the lordly monarch / soon found himself in sorry plight.",
        "185",
        "After the shock their chargers / bore the knights so fast\nOnward past each other / as flew they on the blast.\nThen turned they deftly backward / obedient to the rein,\nAs with their swords contested / the grim and doughty fighters twain.",
        "186",
        "When Siegfried struck in anger / far off was heard the blow,\nAnd flew from off the helmet, / as if ’twere all aglow,\nThe fiery sparks all crackling / beneath his hand around.\nEach warrior in the other / a foeman worth his mettle found.",
        "187",
        "Full many a stroke with vigor / dealt eke King Luedegast,\nAnd on each other’s buckler / the blows fell thick and fast.\nThen thirty men discovered / their master’s sorry plight:\nBut ere they came to help him / had doughty Siegfried won the fight.",
        "188",
        "With three mighty gashes / which he had dealt the king\nThrough his shining breastplate / made fast with many a ring.\nThe sword with sharpest edges / from wounds brought forth the blood,\nWhereat King Luedegast / apace fell into gloomy mood.",
        "189",
        "To spare his life he begged him, / his land he pledged the knight,\nAnd told him straight moreover, / that Luedegast he hight.\nThen came his knights to help him, / they who there had seen\nHow that upon the vanguard / fierce fight betwixt the twain had been.",
        "190",
        "After duel ended, / did thirty yet withstand\nOf knights that him attended; / but there the hero’s hand\nKept safe his noble captive / with blows of wondrous might.\nAnd soon wrought greater ruin / Siegfried the full gallant knight.",
        "191",
        "Beneath his arm of valor / the thirty soon lay dead.\nBut one the knight left living, / who thence full quickly sped\nTo tell abroad the story / how he the others slew;\nIn sooth the blood-red helmet / spake all the hapless tidings true.",
        "192",
        "Then had the men of Denmark / for all their grief good cause,\nWhen it was told them truly / their king a captive was.\nThey told it to King Luedeger, / when he to rage began\nIn anger all unbounded: / for him had grievous harm been done.",
        "193",
        "The noble King Luedegast / was led a prisoner then\nBy hand of mighty Siegfried / back to King Gunther’s men,\nAnd placed in hands of Hagen: / and when they did hear\nThat ’twas the king of Denmark / they not a little joyful were.",
        "194",
        "He bade the men of Burgundy / then bind the banners on.\n“Now forward!” Siegfried shouted, / “here shall yet more be done,\nAn I but live to see it; / ere this day’s sun depart,\nShall mourn in land of Saxons / full many a goodly matron’s heart.",
        "195",
        "“Ye warriors from Rhineland, / to follow me take heed,\nAnd I unto the army / of Luedeger will lead.\nEre we again turn backward / to the land of Burgundy\nHelms many hewn asunder / by hand of good knights there shall be.”",
        "196",
        "To horse then hastened Gernot / and with him mighty men.\nVolker keen in battle / took up the banner then;\nHe was a doughty Fiddler / and rode the host before.\nThere, too, every follower / a stately suit of armor wore.",
        "197",
        "More than a thousand warriors / they there had not a man,\nSaving twelve knights-errant. / To rise the dust began\nIn clouds along the highway / as they rode across the fields,\nAnd gleaming in the sunlight / were seen the brightly shining shields.",
        "198",
        "Meanwhile eke was nearing / of Saxons a great throng,\nEach a broadsword bearing / that mickle was and long,\nWith blade that cut full sorely / when swung in strong right hand.\n’Gainst strangers were they ready / to guard their castles and their\n      land.",
        "199",
        "The leaders forth to battle / led the warriors then.\nCome was also Siegfried / with his twelve chosen men,\nWhom he with him hither / had brought from Netherland.\nThat day in storm of battle / was blood-bespattered many a hand.",
        "200",
        "Sindold and Hunold / and Gernot as well,\nBeneath their hands in battle / full many a hero fell,\nEre that their deeds of valor / were known throughout the host.\nThrough them must many a stately / matron weep for warrior lost.",
        "201",
        "Volker and Hagen / and Ortwein in the fight\nLustily extinguished / full many a helmet’s light\nWith blood from wounds down flowing,– / keen fighters every one.\nAnd there by Dankwart also / was many a mickle wonder done.",
        "202",
        "The knights of Denmark tested / how they could weapons wield.\nClashing there together / heard ye many a shield\nAnd ’neath sharp swords resounding, / swung by many an arm.\nThe Saxons keen in combat / wrought ’mid their foes a grievous harm.",
        "203",
        "When the men of Burgundy / pressed forward to the fight,\nGaping wounds full many / hewed they there with might.\nThen flowing down o’er saddle / in streams was seen the blood,\nSo fought for sake of honor / these valiant riders keen and good.",
        "204",
        "Loudly were heard ringing, / wielded by hero’s hand,\nThe sharply-cutting weapons, / where they of Netherland\nTheir master followed after / into the thickest throng:\nWherever Siegfried led them / rode too those valiant knights along.",
        "205",
        "Of warriors from Rhine river / could follow not a one.\nThere could be seen by any / a stream of blood flow down\nO’er brightly gleaming helmet / ’neath Siegfried’s mighty hand,\nUntil King Luedeger / before him with his men did stand.",
        "206",
        "Three times hither and thither / had he the host cut through\nFrom one end to the other. / Now come was Hagen too\nWho helped him well in battle / to vent his warlike mood.\nThat day beneath his valor / must die full many a rider good.",
        "207",
        "When the doughty Luedeger / Siegfried there found,\nAs he swung high in anger / his arm for blows around\nAnd with his good sword Balmung / knights so many slew,\nThereat was the keen warrior / filled with grief and anger too.",
        "208",
        "Then mickle was the thronging / and loud the broadswords clashed,\nAs all their valiant followers / ’gainst one another dashed.\nThen struggled all the fiercer / both sides the fight to win;\nThe hosts joined with each other: / ’twas frightful there to hear the\n      din.",
        "209",
        "To the monarch of the Saxons / it had been told before,\nHis brother was a captive, / which grieved his heart right sore.\nHe knew not that had done it / fair Siegelind’s son,\nFor rumor said ’twas Gernot. / Full well he learned the truth anon.",
        "210",
        "King Luedeger struck so mighty / when fierce his anger rose,\nThat Siegfried’s steed beneath him / staggered from the blows,\nBut forthwith did recover; / then straight his rider keen\nLet all his furious mettle / in slaughter of his foes be seen.",
        "211",
        "There helped him well grim Hagen, / and Gernot in the fray,\nDankwart and Volker; / dead many a knight there lay.\nSindold and Hunold / and Ortwein, doughty thane,\nBy them in that fierce struggle / was many a valiant warrior slain.",
        "212",
        "Unparted in storm of battle / the gallant leaders were,\nAround them over helmet / flew there many a spear\nThrough shield all brightly shining, / from hand of mighty thane:\nAnd on the glancing armor / was seen full many a blood-red stain.",
        "213",
        "Amid the hurly-burly / down fell many a man\nTo ground from off his charger. / Straight ’gainst each other ran\nSiegfried the keen rider / and eke King Luedeger.\nThen flew from lance the splinters / and hurled was many a pointed spear.",
        "214",
        "’Neath Siegfried’s hand so mighty / from shield flew off the band.\nAnd soon to win the victory / thought he of Netherland\nOver the valiant Saxons, / of whom were wonders seen.\nHeigh-ho! in shining mail-rings / many a breach made Dankwart keen!",
        "215",
        "Upon the shining buckler / that guarded Siegfried’s breast\nSoon espied King Luedeger / a painted crown for crest;\nBy this same token knew he / it was the doughty man,\nAnd to his friends he straightway / amid the battle loud began:",
        "216",
        "“Give o’er from fighting further, / good warriors every one!\nAmongst our foes now see I / Siegmund’s noble son,\nOf netherland the doughty / knight on victory bent.\nHim has the evil Devil / to scourge the Saxons hither sent.”",
        "217",
        "Then bade he all the banners / amid the storm let down.\nPeace he quickly sued for: / ’Twas granted him anon,\nBut he must now a hostage / be ta’en to Gunther’s land.\nThis fate had forced upon him / the fear of Siegfried’s mighty hand.",
        "218",
        "They thus by common counsel / left off all further fight.\nHacked full many a helmet / and shields that late were bright\nFrom hands down laid they weary; / as many as there might be,\nWith stains they all were bloody / ’neath hands of the men of Burgundy.",
        "219",
        "Each whom he would took captive, / now they had won the fight.\nGernot, the noble hero, / and Hagen, doughty knight,\nBade bear forth the wounded. / Back led they with them then\nUnto the land of Burgundy / five hundred stalwart fighting-men.",
        "220",
        "The knights, of victory cheated, / their native Denmark sought,\nNor had that day the Saxons / with such high valor fought,\nThat one could praise them for it, / which caused the warriors pain.\nThen wept their friends full sorely / at home for those in battle slain.",
        "221",
        "For the Rhine then laden / they let their armor be.\nSiegfried, the knight so doughty, / had won the victory\nWith his few chosen followers; / that he had nobly done,\nCould not but free acknowledge / King Gunther’s warriors every one.",
        "222",
        "To Worms sent Gernot riding / now a messenger,\nAnd of the joyous tiding / soon friends at home were ware,\nHow that it well had prospered / with him and all his men.\nFought that day with valor / for honor had those warriors keen.",
        "223",
        "The messenger sped forward / and told the tidings o’er.\nThen joyfully they shouted / who boded ill before,\nTo hear the welcome story / that now to them was told.\nFrom ladies fair and noble / came eager questions manifold,",
        "224",
        "Who all the fair fortune / of King Gunther’s men would know.\nOne messenger they ordered / unto Kriemhild to go.\nBut that was done in secret: / she durst let no one see,\nFor he was ’mongst those warriors / whom she did love so faithfully.",
        "225",
        "When to her own apartments / was come the messenger\nJoyfully addressed him / Kriemhild the maiden fair:\n“But tell me now glad tidings, / and gold I’ll give to thee,\nAnd if thou tell’st not falsely, / good friend thou’lt ever find in me.",
        "226",
        "“How has my good brother / Gernot in battle sped,\nAnd how my other kinsmen? / Lies any of them dead?\nWho wrought most deeds of valor? / –That shall thou let me know.\"\nThen spake the messenger truly: / “No knight but did high valor show.",
        "227",
        "“But in the dire turmoil / rode rider none so well,\nO Princess fair and noble, / since I must truly tell,\nAs the stranger knight full noble / who comes from Netherland;\nThere deeds of mickle wonder / were wrought by doughty Siegfried’s hand.",
        "228",
        "“Whate’er have all the warriors / in battle dared to do,\nDankwart and Hagen / and the other knights so true,\nHowe’er they fought for honor, / ’twas naught but idle play\nBeside what there wrought Siegfried, / King Siegmund’s son, amid the\n      fray.",
        "229",
        "“Beneath their hands in battle / full many a hero fell,\nYet all the deeds of wonder / no man could ever tell,\nWrought by the hand of Siegfried, / when rode he ’gainst the foe:\nAnd weep aloud must women / for friends by his strong arm laid low.",
        "230",
        "“There, too, the knight she loved / full many a maid must lose.\nWere heard come down on helmet / so loud his mighty blows,\nThat they from gaping gashes / brought forth the flowing blood.\nIn all that maketh noble / he is a valiant knight and good.",
        "231",
        "“Many a deed of daring / of Metz Sir Ortwein wrought:\nFor all was evil faring / whom he with broadsword caught,\nDoomed to die that instant, / or wounded sore to fall.\nAnd there thy valiant brother / did greater havoc work than all",
        "232",
        "“That e’er in storm of battle / was done by warrior bold.\nOf all those chosen warriors / let eke the truth be told:\nThe proud Burgundian heroes / have made it now right plain,\nThat they can free from insult / their country’s honor well maintain.",
        "233",
        "“Beneath their hands was often / full many a saddle bare,\nWhen o’er the field resounding / their bright swords cut the air.\nThe warriors from Rhine river / did here such victory win\nThat for their foes ’twere better / if they such meeting ne’er had seen.",
        "234",
        "“Keen the knights of Tronje / ’fore all their valor showed,\nWhen with their stalwart followers / against their foes they rode;\nSlain by the hand of Hagen / must knights so many be,\n’Twill long be in the telling / here in the land of Burgundy.",
        "235",
        "“Sindold and Hunold, / Gernot’s men each one,\nAnd the valiant Rumold / have all so nobly done,\nKing Luedeger will ever / have right good cause to rue\nThat he against thy kindred / at Rhine dared aught of harm to do.",
        "236",
        "“And deeds of all most wondrous / e’er done by warrior keen\nIn earliest time or latest, / by mortal ever seen,\nWrought there in lusty manner / Siegfried with doughty hand.\nRich hostages he bringeth / with him unto Gunther’s land.",
        "237",
        "“By his own strength subdued them / the hero unsurpassed\nAnd brought down dire ruin / upon King Luedegast,\nEke on the King of Saxons / his brother Luedeger.\nNow hearken to the story / I tell thee, noble Princess fair.",
        "238",
        "“Them both hath taken captive / Siegfried’s doughty hand.\nHostages were so many / ne’er brought into this land\nAs to the Rhine come hither / through his great bravery.\"\nThan these could never tidings / unto her heart more welcome be.",
        "239",
        "“With captives home they’re hieing, / five hundred men or mo’,\nAnd of the wounded dying / Lady shalt thou know,\nFull eighty blood-stained barrows / unto Burgundian land,\nMost part hewn down in battle / beneath keen Siegfried’s doughty hand.",
        "240",
        "“Who message sent defiant / unto the Rhine so late\nMust now as Gunther’s prisoners / here abide their fate.\nBringing such noble captives / the victors glad return.\"\nThen glowed with joy the princess / when she the tidings glad did learn.",
        "241",
        "Her cheeks so full of beauty / with joy were rosy-red,\nThat passed he had uninjured / through all the dangers dread,\nThe knight she loved so dearly, / Siegfried with doughty arm.\nGood cause she had for joying / o’er all her friends escaped from harm.",
        "242",
        "Then spake the beauteous maiden: / “Glad news thou hast told me,\nWherefor now rich apparel / thy goodly meed shall be,\nAnd to thee shall be given / ten marks of gold as well.\"\n’Tis thus a thing right pleasant / to ladies high such news to tell.",
        "243",
        "The presents rich they gave him, / gold and apparel rare.\nThen hastened to the casement / full many a maiden fair,\nAnd on the street looked downward: / hither riding did they see\nMany a knight high-hearted / into the land of Burgundy.",
        "244",
        "There came who ’scaped uninjured, / and wounded borne along,\nAll glad to hear the greetings / of friends, a joyful throng.\nTo meet his friends the monarch / rode out in mickle glee:\nIn joying now was ended / all his full great anxiety.",
        "245",
        "Then did he well his warriors / and eke the strangers greet;\nAnd for a king so mighty / ’twere nothing else but meet\nThat he should thank right kindly / the gallant men each one,\nWho had in storm of battle / the victory so bravely won.",
        "246",
        "Then of his friends King Gunther / bade tidings tell straightway,\nOf all his men how many / were fallen in the fray.\nLost had he none other / than warriors three score:\nThen wept they for the heroes, / as since they did for many more.",
        "247",
        "Shields full many brought they / all hewn by valiant hand,\nAnd many a shattered helmet / into King Gunther’s hand.\nThe riders then dismounted / from their steeds before the hall,\nAnd a right hearty welcome / from friends rejoicing had they all.",
        "248",
        "Then did they for the warriors / lodging meet prepare,\nAnd for his guests the monarch / bade full well have care.\nHe bade them take the wounded / and tend them carefully,\nAnd toward his enemies also / his gentle bearing might ye see.",
        "249",
        "To Luedeger then spake he: / “Right welcome art thou here.\nThrough fault of thine now have I / lost many friends full dear,\nFor which, have I good fortune, / thou shall right well atone.\nGod rich reward my liegemen, / such faithfulness to me they’ve shown.”",
        "250",
        "“Well may’st thou thank them, truly,\" / spake then Luedeger;\n“Hostages so noble / won a monarch ne’er.\nFor chivalrous protection / rich goods we offer thee,\nThat thou now right gracious / to us thy enemies shalt be.”",
        "251",
        "“I’ll grant you both your freedom,\" / spake the king again;\n“But that my enemies surely / here by me remain,\nTherefor I’ll have good pledges / they ne’er shall quit my land,\nSave at my royal pleasure.\" / Thereto gave Luedeger the hand.",
        "252",
        "Sweet rest then found the weary / their tired limbs to aid,\nAnd gently soon on couches / the wounded knights were laid;\nMead and wine right ruddy / they poured out plenteously:\nThan they and all their followers / merrier men there none might be.",
        "253",
        "Their shields all hacked in battle / secure were laid away;\nAnd not a few of saddles / stained with blood that day,\nLest women weep to see them, / hid they too from sight.\nFull many a keen rider / home came aweary from the fight.",
        "254",
        "The host in gentlest manner / did his guests attend:\nThe land around with stranger / was crowded, and with friend.\nThey bade the sorely wounded / nurse with especial care:\nWhereby the knights high-hearted / ’neath all their wounds knew not\n      despair.",
        "255",
        "Who there had skill in healing / received reward untold,\nSilver all unweighed / and thereto ruddy gold\nFor making whole the heroes / after the battle sore.\nTo all his friends the monarch / gave presents rich in goodly store.",
        "256",
        "Who there again was minded / to take his homeward way\nThey bade, as one a friend doth, / yet a while to stay.\nThe king did then take counsel / how to reward each one,\nFor they his will in battle / like liegemen true had nobly done.",
        "257",
        "Then outspake royal Gernot: / “Now let them homeward go;\nAfter six weeks are over, / –thus our friends shall know–\nTo hold high feast they’re bidden / hither to come again;\nMany a knight now lying / sore wounded will be healed ere then.",
        "258",
        "Of Netherland the hero / would also then take leave.\nWhen of this King Gunther / did tidings first receive,\nThe knight besought he kindly / not yet his leave to take:\nTo this he’d ne’er consented / an it were not for Kriemhild’s sake.",
        "259",
        "A prince he was too noble / to take the common pay;\nHe had right well deserved it / that the king alway\nAnd all his warriors held him / in honor, for they had seen\nWhat by his arm in battle / bravely had accomplished been.",
        "260",
        "He stayed there yet a little / for the maiden’s sake alone,\nWhom he would see so gladly. / And all fell out full soon\nAs he at heart had wished it: / well known to him was she.\nHome to his father’s country / joyously anon rode he.",
        "261",
        "The king bade at all seasons / keep up the tournament,\nAnd many a youthful rider / forth to the lists there went.\nThe while were seats made ready / by Worms upon the strand\nFor all who soon were coming / unto the Burgundian land.",
        "262",
        "In the meantime also, / ere back the knights returned,\nHad Kriemhild, noble lady, / the tidings likewise learned,\nThe king would hold high feasting / with all his gallant men.\nThere was a mickle hurry, / and busy were fair maidens then",
        "263",
        "With dresses and with wimples / that they there should wear.\nUte, queen so stately, / the story too did hear,\nHow to them were coming / proud knights of highest worth.\nThen from enfolding covers / were store of dresses rich brought forth.",
        "264",
        "Such love she bore her children / she bade rich dress prepare,\nWherewith adorned were ladies / and many a maiden fair,\nAnd not a few young riders / in the land of Burgundy.\nFor strangers many bade she / rich garments eke should measured be.",
