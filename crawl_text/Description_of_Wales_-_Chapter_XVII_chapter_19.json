        "Their love of high birth and ancient genealogy",
        "The Welsh esteem noble birth and generous descent above all things,\n(25) and are, therefore, more desirous of marrying into noble than\nrich families.  Even the common people retain their genealogy, and\ncan not only readily recount the names of their grandfathers and\ngreat-grandfathers, but even refer back to the sixth or seventh\ngeneration, or beyond them, in this manner:  Rhys, son of Gruffydd,\nson of Rhys, son of Tewdwr, son of Eineon, son of Owen, son of\nHowel, son of Cadell, son of Roderic Mawr, and so on.",
        "Being particularly attached to family descent, they revenge with\nvehemence the injuries which may tend to the disgrace of their\nblood; and being naturally of a vindictive and passionate\ndisposition, they are ever ready to avenge not only recent but\nancient affronts; they neither inhabit towns, villages, nor\ncastles, but lead a solitary life in the woods, on the borders of\nwhich they do not erect sumptuous palaces, nor lofty stone\nbuildings, but content themselves with small huts made of the\nboughs of trees twisted together, constructed with little labour\nand expense, and sufficient to endure throughout the year.  They\nhave neither orchards nor gardens, but gladly eat the fruit of both\nwhen given to them.  The greater part of their land is laid down to\npasturage; little is cultivated, a very small quantity is\nornamented with flowers, and a still smaller is sown.  They seldom\nyoke less than four oxen to their ploughs; the driver walks before,\nbut backwards, and when he falls down, is frequently exposed to\ndanger from the refractory oxen.  Instead of small sickles in\nmowing, they make use of a moderate-sized piece of iron formed like\na knife, with two pieces of wood fixed loosely and flexibly to the\nhead, which they think a more expeditious instrument; but since",

        "their mode of using it will be better known by inspection than by\nany description.  The boats (26) which they employ in fishing or in\ncrossing the rivers are made of twigs, not oblong nor pointed, but\nalmost round, or rather triangular, covered both within and without\nwith raw hides.  When a salmon thrown into one of these boats\nstrikes it hard with his tail, he often oversets it, and endangers\nboth the vessel and its navigator.  The fishermen, according to the\ncustom of the country, in going to and from the rivers, carry these\nboats on their shoulders; on which occasion that famous dealer in\nfables, Bleddercus, who lived a little before our time, thus\nmysteriously said:  “There is amongst us a people who, when they go\nout in search of prey, carry their horses on their backs to the\nplace of plunder; in order to catch their prey, they leap upon\ntheir horses, and when it is taken, carry their horses home again\nupon their shoulders.”",
