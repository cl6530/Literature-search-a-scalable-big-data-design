        "You must try to understand that when I finished school I was as raw as\nraw could be. I had never travelled anywhere on my own, never purchased\na train ticket, since like most kids my age I had only travelled with\nmy parents or relatives and they made all the decisions. I had no\nexperience of how to handle money (my knowledge being limited to\nspending the 50 paise or one rupee I would receive as pocket money now\nand then).",
        "So while I had set my sights on travelling far and wide my parents\nwisely thought that I should begin by learning to manage on my own\nwithin Goa itself. It was also the rainy season and travelling around\nthe country would be much more difficult they explained.",
        "So I started out by helping at an aquarium shop in Mapusa, the town\nnearest my village. The proprietor of the shop is Ashok D’Cruz, a\ncollege friend of my father’s. I must tell you about Ashok. He is no\nordinary businessman: keeping fish is a passion with him. He is far\nmore interested in chatting with his customers about fish than making\nmoney selling them. I have never seen him forcing any of his customers\nto buy from his stock of aquarium fish.",
        "In fact, it was Ashok who introduced me to the amazing world of\naquarium fish way back when I was just nine and studying in Class V.\nUnder his guidance then, I experimented with breeding guppies, platties\nand mollies, fairly simple types of fish to breed. However, it was a\nmatter of great excitement for me at that time to be successful in my\nexperiments and Ashok was generous enough to even buy back from me the\nbaby fish I reared just to encourage me. Later I developed sufficient\nconfidence to experiment with and breed more difficult types of fish,\nlike Siamese Fighting Fish and Blue Guramies-all under the expert\ntutelage of Ashok.",
        "So it was to Ashok’s shop that I went every morning at 9.00 a.m.,\nspeeding on my bicycle to be on time. I would stay there until lunch\ntime, a regular hands on, doing whatever I was asked to do.",
        "Ashok’s shop is not very large. It is a two-roomed shop on the ground\nfloor of the Gomes Catao complex. It has a display section in front and\na store room at the back. The showroom has about twenty fish tanks on\ndisplay with a variety of fish that Ashok purchases mainly from Mumbai.\nEach tank stores a particular species of fish. Ashok’s shop is located\naway from the main market area so he does not have the advantage of\ncasual customers dropping by. However Ashok has his regular customers\nand there are always at least twenty to thirty customers daily.",
        "During my first few days at his shop, my work was only to watch the\ntanks, clean those which were dirty, remove the dead fish and do some\nother small jobs. I also fed the fish and treated the wounded and\ndiseased fish. Sometimes, I also attended to customers. Gradually, I\nbegan to accompany Ashok on his rounds to various places.",
        "A gentleman in Moira wanted to set up an aquarium at his home. He had a\ntank. He also had definite ideas about how he wanted it to finally look\nand Ashok was called to see how it could all be done. The man sent his\ncar for us. At his house we discussed the location of the tank,\nlighting arrangements, the water filters, the kind and quantity of fish\nhe would like to have, and maintenance. After we were fully satisfied\nthat we had everything right and had noted down his requirements, we\nreturned to Mapusa. Later he came for the material which we kept ready\nfor him.",
        "Another time I accompanied Ashok to a client’s office to put a pair of\nDwarf Guramies in the fish tank and to fix a picture as a backdrop for\nthe tank. On such visits I watched care fully what Ashok did and soon\nenough Ashok started sending me on my own to visit some of his clients\nwho had small or simple problems.",
        "I went to clients to fix aquarium equipment such as air pumps and\nfilters, to fix toys in the tanks, to check fish for diseases or if\nthere was a sudden crisis such as fish dying in numbers, or if a client\nwished to add more fish to his collection. I was sent to collect\noverdue payments or simply to enquire the aquariums were doing.\nSometimes I went on my own to visit some of the places where we had set\nup tanks and enjoyed watching the fish swimming happily in their new\nhomes.",
        "One day my employer decided to send me as a spy to find out the prices\nof fish and fish food at a competitive fish shop. I tried to behave\nlike a casual customer and walked coolly into the competitor’s shop and\ngradually began to ask the prices of fish and fish food. After I had\nfound out what was needed I bought a pair of cheap Black Mollies from\nhis shop just to show him that I was a genuine customer. From the\ninformation I got, we found Ashok’s to be comparatively cheaper than\nthe competitor.",
        "During this period I improved my knowledge about aquarium fish\ntremendously. This was mainly due to two things. Firstly, I had spent a\nlot of time observing the fish at Ashok’s shop and getting practical\nexperience from the places we visited. Secondly, I had been reading the\nfish books that my father bought for me as a gift for getting a\ndistinction in my SSC exam. The books were quite expensive but well\nworth the cost. Being able to get theoretical knowledge and practical\nexperience at the same time gave me a lot of confidence with regard to\naquarium fish.",
        "One of the important highlights of my experience at Ashok’s was\nlearning to make fish tanks. Ashok told me that since we were going\nthrough a slack period, he would teach me how to make fish tanks. I had\nto start from basics which meant purchasing glass for six tanks, having\nthe glass pieces cut to specifications and then having the pieces\ndelivered at the shop without a scratch.",
        "I had accompanied Ashok on several occasions earlier to the glass shop\nand watched as he ordered glass explaining his requirements, or having\na piece re-cut because it was done wrongly. In fact, I had been sent\noften to the glass shop for small purchases so I was fairly familiar\nwith the owner and the procedures. Ashok had even taught me how to\ncalculate the price of glass. Still it was a new experience for me when\nAshok handed me some money and gave me general directions on what to do\nand I was on my own.",
        "I managed to purchase the glass and also to get it cut to size. So\nfar, so good. Now came the difficult part of transporting the glass\npieces to the shop. I wondered whether I should get a rickshaw for the\npurpose but was a little hesitant since I hadn’t checked what it would\ncost for the trip, short though it would be. While I was trying to make\nup my mind by testing the package for its weight, the shopkeeper\nassured me that I would be able to handcarry the glass to Ashok’s shop,\nwhich is what I finally did.",
        "I started out. In the beginning, it was no problem. However, the\npackage grew heavier and heavier as I trudged up the road to Ashok’s\nshop with rickshaws, taxis and motorcycles honking away on all sides.\nEven before I reached my destination I doubted the wisdom of my actions\nfor I was tired and my arms ached but I dared not put down the glass\nsimply because it was glass. When I finally reached the shop I heaved a\nsigh of relief that the glass was intact. Ashok was horrified at my\ndecision and understandably very angry too for as he explained to me\nshould I have had an accident on the way the consequences would have\nbeen disastrous and he was after all responsible for me! I truly learnt\nan important lesson that day.",
        "Learning to make an aquarium tank is great fun. One has to first plan\nthe size of the tank. For this one must first decide on the length of\nthe tank. After that, the height and the breadth are to be\nproportionately calculated. The sides of the glass are held together\nwith silicone, which is a glue, and which feels like rubber when it\nhardens. Silicone does not dissolve in water. The tricky part is being\nable to apply the silicone only to the edges of the glass and not\nletting your sticky fingers touch any other portions of the glass.\nOtherwise, the glass will look dirty, for the silicone marks will stay\nlike a fingerprint on the glass forever. After the tank is resealed on\nthe inside with silicone (to give double protection), it is left for a\nday to dry. The next day it is tested by filling with water and if all\nis well the tank is ready for sale and can be delivered to the\ncustomer.",
        "After I was taught how to do the first tank, I started helping with the\nrest. I recall how once by mistake I stuck the glass upside down.\n“There’s something fishy about the looks of this tank,” said Ashok.\nWhen he realized what my mistake was, he very nearly put me into the\ntank!",
        "My first opportunity at testing my skills at finding out the reasons\nfor “fish dying in an aquarium” (the most common complaint from\ncustomers) came when the manager of Hotel Osborne in Calangute asked\nAshok to come and examine their aquarium on the hotel premises. The\nfish were dying, he said. The owner of the hotel was a very good\ncustomer of Ashok’s and so Ashok was keen to solve the problem. However\nas he could not go himself that day and did not wish to delay matters,\nhe decided to send me instead. He gave me the manager’s visiting card,\ndirections to the hotel, some fish medicines and a pump to install in\nplace of the old one which was defective and I was on my own. I was\nproud and happy that Ashok felt confident to entrust me with such an\nimportant job.",
        "I left in the evening for the hotel. I found it with no problem at all.\nIt was a large hotel with lovely lawns and a swimming pool. I walked\ninto the hotel proudly, with my head held high, and tried to act as if\nI were a very experienced fish doctor. I went and met the manager. He\ntold me which fish had died. I searched for symptoms of disease but\nfound none. I then realised that the problem was very simple and one\nthat is very common: a case of overfeeding. Fish require food in\nproportion to their size but often people put more food than necessary\ninto the tank. The extra food makes the water cloudy and polluted and\nthis causes the fish to die.",
        "I cleaned the tanks, replaced the pump, checked the filters and showed\nthe hotel staff how to feed the fish. I even managed to do some sales\nwork by selling them some fish medicines which they could keep as\nstandby and made a bill for them on the bill book that Ashok had given\nme. They seemed satisfied with my work and made me a cup of tea, which\nI didn’t drink because I don’t drink tea. After I had finished I\ncouldn’t wait to tell Ashok about my experience.",
        "During this period, I took the opportunity once to visit fish shops in\nPanjim which I had heard about but had not yet seen. The occasion came\nwhen my 3-gear cycle broke down and I needed to go to Panjim to get\nspares. I tried to persuade my mother to get them for me from Panjim\nsince she went there often. She refused, saying that I should learn to\ndo things on my own. That’s when I thought of making a whole-day trip\nto Panjim to buy the spares, visit fish shops and also make a few\npurchases for Ashok.",
        "The next day, I accompanied my mum to Panjim where she showed me a few\nessential places and then left me on my own. I was a bit nervous but\nwas determined to manage somehow. I first went to the Kamat restaurant\nto eat as I was hungry. I was amazed at how much it cost me to fill my\nstomach outside home! After that, I searched for a shop from where I\ncould purchase silicone (Ashok’s errand). After a lot of asking around\nI found the place. Then I looked for the cycle shop, found it quickly\nenough but discovered that the item I wanted was out of stock and would\nbe available only the next week.",
        "I was then free to visit the two fish shops I had in mind: “Bislin” and\n“Something Fishy”. Bislin was well stocked and had many types of exotic\nfish but I found it very expensive. I chatted with the people who ran\nthe shop (it is a family business). They also kept birds for sale.\nAfter watching the fish for sometime I decided to go to Something Fishy\nwhich was just around the corner. At Something Fishy, I was\ndisappointed at first sight to see very few fish. The shop assistant\ntold me that as they were expecting fish the following weekend almost\nall their tanks were empty. But what I saw remaining in the display\ntank amazed me. I saw man-eating piranhas with my own eyes for the\nfirst time in my life! However, the piranhas were quite timid and shy.\nApparently, it is only when they are kept hungry that they become\nferocious meat-eaters. Something Fishy also had exotic fish called\nBlack Ghost which sold at Rs.3000 a pair!",
        "Apart from learning about fish at Ashok’s shop I gained a lot of other\nvaluable experience.",
        "I had never done banking before. But one day Ashok casually asked me if\nI would go to his bank to withdraw some money. I didn’t feel like\ntelling him that I had no idea of how to go about doing this. Instead I\nasked for directions to the bank and set out. Somehow I figured my way\naround and got the job done. I was sent many times after that to the\nbank to deposit and withdraw money.",
        "Although I had all the time in the world at my disposal I found it was\nnot the easiest thing for me to effectively manage my time. Several\ntimes I would be speeding away on my bicycle to Ashok’s shop because I\nhad woken up late that morning. Or I had to push my lunch hour till\nlater because I had not completed all my tasks for the day. It was an\nexperience learning to plan my day properly and I would feel quite\npleased with myself when I got things right on my own.",
        "I also gained a lot of valuable insights into my own hobbies and\ninterests since for the first time in my life I was on my own and free\nto make decisions or experiment with ideas I thought worthwhile.",
        "I discovered that I have a great passion for reading books. I used to\ngo every morning to the library, on my way to Ashok’s shop, and pick up\nsomething to read during my free time. My favourite books were the\nHardy Boys and I finished practically the entire series while I was at\nAshok’s. I also enjoyed comics like Tintin and Phantom.",
        "Evenings, after I had finished with Ashok’s shop, I would listen to the\nFM radio music programmes. Like any other teenager, I like fast and\nloud music. Fortunately, my aunt Allison visiting us from Canada gave\nme a walkman which enabled me to play my music without disturbing the\nothers. I thought about starting to learn the guitar but my parents\nadvised against starting guitar lessons immediately as I had plans to\ntravel out of Goa in the coming months. Letter writing is not one of my\nfavourite things. However, I was forced to reply to the people who sent\nme letters and cash prizes, congratulating me on my examination\nresults. I was overjoyed to receive prompt replies from several of my\nrelatives and friends commending me on my choice of a year’s\nsabbatical. I also realised that you only get letters when you write to\npeople. However, I still don’t enjoy letter-writing.",
        "On Sundays, I used to do a few odd jobs to earn some pocket money. Like\nwashing the car for which I used to get five rupees from my dad. I was\nalso the main errand boy at home and I did all kinds of jobs like\npaying the electricity bills, buying the rations and so on.",
        "All in all, working at Ashok’s was a good beginning.",
        "Field Work Notes:\nNow Julie Has a Fish Tank",
        "Juliet and Peter D’Souza are college friends of my parents. They live\nat Calangute. Peter is a criminal lawyer and Juliet is a school\nteacher. Our families occasionally go on outings together. On one of\nthese picnics during my SSC year Juliet discovering my interest in\naquarium fish promptly tried to get me to assist her in setting up an\naquarium in their home.",
        "Actually they did have a fish tank earlier but the bottom glass had\ncracked and Juliet had given it to Ashok for repairs. And there it\nremained, in Ashok’s shop, with nobody attending to it. Juliet had\nreminded me on several occasions about the tank but there was little I\ncould do other than pass on her reminders to Ashok. When I started\nworking with Ashok I quickly took the opportunity of keeping my promise\nto her.",
        "The first problem was to find the tank. I began searching for it in the\nstoreroom of Ashok’s shop. I found it right at the bottom of all the\nother big tanks. I was relieved to see it still in one piece. Ashok and\nI then removed the broken bottom glass. We took the measurements and\nbought new glass from the glass shop. After fixing the tank, I went to\nPeter’s office and told him to pick it up and take it home whenever he\ncould.",
        "Peter came by and took it home the next evening. A few days later I\ncycled down to their house to set it up. Once there I realized that\nJuliet did not have any material for placing in the tank except a\nlittle gravel which was not enough to cover even the base of the tank.\nI explained to her all the essential items needed and she gave me a\nfreehand to purchase material and decorations for the tank. On my next\nvisit, I took a few kilos of gravel, a pump, plastic plants, fish\nmedicine, the undergravel filter, some pipeline, a few regulators,\nT-joints and a fishnet. I also took four types of aquarium toys and two\nshells for her to choose from.",
        "I started off with washing the gravel, then fixed the under-gravel\nfilter. I next poured gravel over the filter, and placed the\ndecorations of shells and toys on top. Then the tap and filters were\njoined to the air pump. All this while I was watched intently by\nAngelann and Miriam, Juliet’s two young daughters, who kept offering\nopinions or help here and there. After about two hours, everything was\nready. Only the fish and aquatic plants remained to be put in the\naquarium. The task of selecting the fish for the tank was not part of\nmy assignment as Julie said that she would buy the fish from a fish\nshop in Candolim. However, as she doubted whether live plants were sold\nin Candolim, she asked me to send her the plants through Peter. She\nalso told me to prepare a bill for her which I was to hand over to\nPeter. All this I did within the next two days.",
        "A week later, I had to visit Peter and Julie’s place to deliver a note\nto Peter from my dad. I was keen to see the fish she had bought and how\nthey were doing in the new home I had made for them. As a present I\ndecided to take five pairs of guppies from my garden tank. Imagine my\nshock when I found that the tank was just as I had left it, with no\nfish at all to inhabit the lovely quarters. I was glad I had brought\nalong the guppies and these became the first lot of fish to inhabit the\ntank. I also fixed the light and the regulators and set the plants\nproperly.",
        "Juliet’s little daughters crowded round me as I stood back to admire\nthe now complete aquarium: fish swimming happily with newly installed\nplants and air filters bubbling away in a corner. Juliet soon joined us\nand thanked me warmly and to my utter surprise slipped a 50 rupee note\ninto my pocket. I protested that she should not pay me for this as I\nwas having great fun but she insisted that I take the money and this\nbecame my first earning.",
        "In similar fashion I set up fish tanks for a few other family friends.\nBesides having a lot of fun and gaining valuable experience, I also\nearned pocket money! Avdoot and Rekha Munj in Mapusa have a lovely big\ntank which I helped set up for their daughter; Alvito and Celine\nSantiago from Parra also had an empty fish tank which they wanted to\nput back in use and I organised the fish for them too.",
        "There was also the large fish tank in the office of the Principal of my\nschool (St. Anthony’s at Monte Guirim), which I had maintained during\nmy school days. I continued to keep watch over it through my younger\nbrother Milind, who, like me, is also a fish fan.",
