        "     To the great and illustrious Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, a token\n     of admiration for his works and genius.\n                                                      De Balzac.",
        "Mme. Vauquer (nee de Conflans) is an elderly person, who for\nthe past forty years has kept a lodging-house in the Rue\nNueve-Sainte-Genevieve, in the district that lies between the\nLatin Quarter and the Faubourg Saint-Marcel. Her house (known in\nthe neighborhood as the Maison Vauquer) receives men and women,\nold and young, and no word has ever been breathed against her\nrespectable establishment; but, at the same time, it must be said\nthat as a matter of fact no young woman has been under her roof for\nthirty years, and that if a young man stays there for any length of\ntime it is a sure sign that his allowance must be of the slenderest.\nIn 1819, however, the time when this drama opens, there was an almost\npenniless young girl among Mme. Vauquer’s boarders.",
        "That word drama has been somewhat discredited of late; it has been\noverworked and twisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous\nliterature; but it must do service again here, not because this story\nis dramatic in the restricted sense of the word, but because some\ntears may perhaps be shed intra et extra muros before it is over.",
        "Will any one without the walls of Paris understand it? It is open to\ndoubt. The only audience who could appreciate the results of close\nobservation, the careful reproduction of minute detail and local\ncolor, are dwellers between the heights of Montrouge and Montmartre,\nin a vale of crumbling stucco watered by streams of black mud, a vale\nof sorrows which are real and joys too often hollow; but this audience\nis so accustomed to terrible sensations, that only some unimaginable\nand well-neigh impossible woe could produce any lasting impression\nthere. Now and again there are tragedies so awful and so grand by\nreason of the complication of virtues and vices that bring them about,\nthat egotism and selfishness are forced to pause and are moved to\npity; but the impression that they receive is like a luscious fruit,\nsoon consumed. Civilization, like the car of Juggernaut, is scarcely\nstayed perceptibly in its progress by a heart less easy to break than\nthe others that lie in its course; this also is broken, and\nCivilization continues on her course triumphant. And you, too, will do\nthe like; you who with this book in your white hand will sink back\namong the cushions of your armchair, and say to yourself, “Perhaps\nthis may amuse me.” You will read the story of Father Goriot’s secret\nwoes, and, dining thereafter with an unspoiled appetite, will lay the\nblame of your insensibility upon the writer, and accuse him of\nexaggeration, of writing romances. Ah! once for all, this drama is\nneither a fiction nor a romance! All is true,–so true, that every\none can discern the elements of the tragedy in his own house, perhaps\nin his own heart.",
        "The lodging-house is Mme. Vauquer’s own property. It is still standing\nin the lower end of the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, just where the\nroad slopes so sharply down to the Rue de l’Arbalete, that wheeled\ntraffic seldom passes that way, because it is so stony and steep. This\nposition is sufficient to account for the silence prevalent in the\nstreets shut in between the dome of the Pantheon and the dome of the\nVal-de-Grace, two conspicuous public buildings which give a yellowish\ntone to the landscape and darken the whole district that lies beneath\nthe shadow of their leaden-hued cupolas.",
        "In that district the pavements are clean and dry, there is neither mud\nnor water in the gutters, grass grows in the chinks of the walls. The\nmost heedless passer-by feels the depressing influences of a place\nwhere the sound of wheels creates a sensation; there is a grim look\nabout the houses, a suggestion of a jail about those high garden\nwalls. A Parisian straying into a suburb apparently composed of\nlodging-houses and public institutions would see poverty and dullness,\nold age lying down to die, and joyous youth condemned to drudgery. It\nis the ugliest quarter of Paris, and, it may be added, the least\nknown. But, before all things, the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve is like\na bronze frame for a picture for which the mind cannot be too well\nprepared by the contemplation of sad hues and sober images. Even so,\nstep by step the daylight decreases, and the cicerone’s droning voice\ngrows hollower as the traveler descends into the Catacombs. The\ncomparison holds good! Who shall say which is more ghastly, the sight\nof the bleached skulls or of dried-up human hearts?",
        "The front of the lodging-house is at right angles to the road, and\nlooks out upon a little garden, so that you see the side of the house\nin section, as it were, from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. Beneath\nthe wall of the house front there lies a channel, a fathom wide, paved\nwith cobble-stones, and beside it runs a graveled walk bordered by\ngeraniums and oleanders and pomegranates set in great blue and white\nglazed earthenware pots. Access into the graveled walk is afforded by\na door, above which the words MAISON VAUQUER may be read, and beneath,\nin rather smaller letters, ’Lodgings for both sexes, etc.“",
        "During the day a glimpse into the garden is easily obtained through a\nwicket to which a bell is attached. On the opposite wall, at the\nfurther end of the graveled walk, a green marble arch was painted once\nupon a time by a local artist, and in this semblance of a shrine a\nstatue representing Cupid is installed; a Parisian Cupid, so blistered\nand disfigured that he looks like a candidate for one of the adjacent\nhospitals, and might suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolism. The\nhalf-obliterated inscription on the pedestal beneath determines the\ndate of this work of art, for it bears witness to the widespread\nenthusiasm felt for Voltaire on his return to Paris in 1777:",
        "              “Whoe’er thou art, thy master see;\n               He is, or was, or ought to be.”",
        "At night the wicket gate is replaced by a solid door. The little\ngarden is no wider than the front of the house; it is shut in between\nthe wall of the street and the partition wall of the neighboring\nhouse. A mantle of ivy conceals the bricks and attracts the eyes of\npassers-by to an effect which is picturesque in Paris, for each of the\nwalls is covered with trellised vines that yield a scanty dusty crop\nof fruit, and furnish besides a subject of conversation for Mme.\nVauquer and her lodgers; every year the widow trembles for her\nvintage.",
        "A straight path beneath the walls on either side of the garden leads\nto a clump of lime-trees at the further end of it; line-trees, as\nMme. Vauquer persists in calling them, in spite of the fact that she\nwas a de Conflans, and regardless of repeated corrections from her\nlodgers.",
        "The central space between the walls is filled with artichokes and rows\nof pyramid fruit-trees, and surrounded by a border of lettuce,\npot-herbs, and parsley. Under the lime-trees there are a few\ngreen-painted garden seats and a wooden table, and hither, during the\ndog-days, such of the lodgers as are rich enough to indulge in a cup of\ncoffee come to take their pleasure, though it is hot enough to roast\neggs even in the shade.",
        "The house itself is three stories high, without counting the attics\nunder the roof. It is built of rough stone, and covered with the\nyellowish stucco that gives a mean appearance to almost every house in\nParis. There are five windows in each story in the front of the house;\nall the blinds visible through the small square panes are drawn up\nawry, so that the lines are all at cross purposes. At the side of the\nhouse there are but two windows on each floor, and the lowest of all\nare adorned with a heavy iron grating.",
        "Behind the house a yard extends for some twenty feet, a space\ninhabited by a happy family of pigs, poultry, and rabbits; the\nwood-shed is situated on the further side, and on the wall between\nthe wood-shed and the kitchen window hangs the meat-safe, just above\nthe place where the sink discharges its greasy streams. The cook\nsweeps all the refuse out through a little door into the Rue\nNueve-Sainte-Genevieve, and frequently cleanses the yard with\ncopious supplies of water, under pain of pestilence.",
        "The house might have been built on purpose for its present uses.\nAccess is given by a French window to the first room on the ground\nfloor, a sitting-room which looks out upon the street through the two\nbarred windows already mentioned. Another door opens out of it into\nthe dining-room, which is separated from the kitchen by the well of\nthe staircase, the steps being constructed partly of wood, partly of\ntiles, which are colored and beeswaxed. Nothing can be more depressing\nthan the sight of that sitting-room. The furniture is covered with\nhorse hair woven in alternate dull and glossy stripes. There is a\nround table in the middle, with a purplish-red marble top, on which\nthere stands, by way of ornament, the inevitable white china\ntea-service, covered with a half-effaced gilt network. The floor is\nsufficiently uneven, the wainscot rises to elbow height, and the rest\nof the wall space is decorated with a varnished paper, on which the\nprincipal scenes from Telemaque are depicted, the various classical\npersonages being colored. The subject between the two windows is the\nbanquet given by Calypso to the son of Ulysses, displayed thereon for\nthe admiration of the boarders, and has furnished jokes these forty\nyears to the young men who show themselves superior to their position\nby making fun of the dinners to which poverty condemns them. The\nhearth is always so clean and neat that it is evident that a fire is\nonly kindled there on great occasions; the stone chimney-piece is\nadorned by a couple of vases filled with faded artificial flowers\nimprisoned under glass shades, on either side of a bluish marble clock\nin the very worst taste.",
        "The first room exhales an odor for which there is no name in the\nlanguage, and which should be called the odeur de pension. The damp\natmosphere sends a chill through you as you breathe it; it has a\nstuffy, musty, and rancid quality; it permeates your clothing;\nafter-dinner scents seem to be mingled in it with smells from the\nkitchen and scullery and the reek of a hospital. It might be possible\nto describe it if some one should discover a process by which to\ndistil from the atmosphere all the nauseating elements with which it\nis charged by the catarrhal exhalations of every individual lodger,\nyoung or old. Yet, in spite of these stale horrors, the sitting-room\nis as charming and as delicately perfumed as a boudoir, when compared\nwith the adjoining dining-room.",
        "The paneled walls of that apartment were once painted some color, now\na matter of conjecture, for the surface is incrusted with accumulated\nlayers of grimy deposit, which cover it with fantastic outlines. A\ncollection of dim-ribbed glass decanters, metal discs with a satin\nsheen on them, and piles of blue-edged earthenware plates of Touraine\nware cover the sticky surfaces of the sideboards that line the room.\nIn a corner stands a box containing a set of numbered pigeon-holes, in\nwhich the lodgers’ table napkins, more or less soiled and stained with\nwine, are kept. Here you see that indestructible furniture never met\nwith elsewhere, which finds its way into lodging-houses much as the\nwrecks of our civilization drift into hospitals for incurables. You\nexpect in such places as these to find the weather-house whence a\nCapuchin issues on wet days; you look to find the execrable engravings\nwhich spoil your appetite, framed every one in a black varnished\nframe, with a gilt beading round it; you know the sort of\ntortoise-shell clock-case, inlaid with brass; the green stove, the\nArgand lamps, covered with oil and dust, have met your eyes before.\nThe oilcloth which covers the long table is so greasy that a waggish\nexterne will write his name on the surface, using his thumb-nail as a\nstyle. The chairs are broken-down invalids; the wretched little hempen\nmats slip away from under your feet without slipping away for good;\nand finally, the foot-warmers are miserable wrecks, hingeless,\ncharred, broken away about the holes. It would be impossible to give\nan idea of the old, rotten, shaky, cranky, worm-eaten, halt, maimed,\none-eyed, rickety, and ramshackle condition of the furniture without\nan exhaustive description, which would delay the progress of the story\nto an extent that impatient people would not pardon. The red tiles of\nthe floor are full of depressions brought about by scouring and\nperiodical renewings of color. In short, there is no illusory grace\nleft to the poverty that reigns here; it is dire, parsimonious,\nconcentrated, threadbare poverty; as yet it has not sunk into the\nmire, it is only splashed by it, and though not in rags as yet, its\nclothing is ready to drop to pieces.",
        "This apartment is in all its glory at seven o’clock in the morning,\nwhen Mme. Vauquer’s cat appears, announcing the near approach of his\nmistress, and jumps upon the sideboards to sniff at the milk in the\nbowls, each protected by a plate, while he purrs his morning greeting\nto the world. A moment later the widow shows her face; she is tricked\nout in a net cap attached to a false front set on awry, and shuffles\ninto the room in her slipshod fashion. She is an oldish woman, with a\nbloated countenance, and a nose like a parrot’s beak set in the middle\nof it; her fat little hands (she is as sleek as a church rat) and her\nshapeless, slouching figure are in keeping with the room that reeks of\nmisfortune, where hope is reduced to speculate for the meanest stakes.\nMme. Vauquer alone can breathe that tainted air without being\ndisheartened by it. Her face is as fresh as a frosty morning in\nautumn; there are wrinkles about the eyes that vary in their\nexpression from the set smile of a ballet-dancer to the dark,\nsuspicious scowl of a discounter of bills; in short, she is at once\nthe embodiment and interpretation of her lodging-house, as surely as\nher lodging-house implies the existence of its mistress. You can no\nmore imagine the one without the other, than you can think of a jail\nwithout a turnkey. The unwholesome corpulence of the little woman is\nproduced by the life she leads, just as typhus fever is bred in the\ntainted air of a hospital. The very knitted woolen petticoat that she\nwears beneath a skirt made of an old gown, with the wadding protruding\nthrough the rents in the material, is a sort of epitome of the\nsitting-room, the dining-room, and the little garden; it discovers the\ncook, it foreshadows the lodgers–the picture of the house is\ncompleted by the portrait of its mistress.",
        "Mme. Vauquer at the age of fifty is like all women who “have seen a\ndeal of trouble.” She has the glassy eyes and innocent air of a\ntrafficker in flesh and blood, who will wax virtuously indignant to\nobtain a higher price for her services, but who is quite ready to\nbetray a Georges or a Pichegru, if a Georges or a Pichegru were in\nhiding and still to be betrayed, or for any other expedient that may\nalleviate her lot. Still, “she is a good woman at bottom,” said the\nlodgers who believed that the widow was wholly dependent upon the\nmoney that they paid her, and sympathized when they heard her cough\nand groan like one of themselves.",
        "What had M. Vauquer been? The lady was never very explicit on this\nhead. How had she lost her money? “Through trouble,” was her answer.\nHe had treated her badly, had left her nothing but her eyes to cry\nover his cruelty, the house she lived in, and the privilege of pitying\nnobody, because, so she was wont to say, she herself had been through\nevery possible misfortune.",
        "Sylvie, the stout cook, hearing her mistress’ shuffling footsteps,\nhastened to serve the lodgers’ breakfasts. Beside those who lived in\nthe house, Mme. Vauquer took boarders who came for their meals; but\nthese externes usually only came to dinner, for which they paid\nthirty francs a month.",
        "At the time when this story begins, the lodging-house contained seven\ninmates. The best rooms in the house were on the first story, Mme.\nVauquer herself occupying the least important, while the rest were let\nto a Mme. Couture, the widow of a commissary-general in the service of\nthe Republic. With her lived Victorine Taillefer, a schoolgirl, to\nwhom she filled the place of mother. These two ladies paid eighteen\nhundred francs a year.",
        "The two sets of rooms on the second floor were respectively occupied\nby an old man named Poiret and a man of forty or thereabouts, the\nwearer of a black wig and dyed whiskers, who gave out that he was a\nretired merchant, and was addressed as M. Vautrin. Two of the four\nrooms on the third floor were also let–one to an elderly spinster, a\nMlle. Michonneau, and the other to a retired manufacturer of\nvermicelli, Italian paste and starch, who allowed the others to\naddress him as “Father Goriot.” The remaining rooms were allotted to\nvarious birds of passage, to impecunious students, who like “Father\nGoriot” and Mlle. Michonneau, could only muster forty-five francs a\nmonth to pay for their board and lodging. Mme. Vauquer had little\ndesire for lodgers of this sort; they ate too much bread, and she only\ntook them in default of better.",
        "At that time one of the rooms was tenanted by a law student, a young\nman from the neighborhood of Angouleme, one of a large family who\npinched and starved themselves to spare twelve hundred francs a year\nfor him. Misfortune had accustomed Eugene de Rastignac, for that was\nhis name, to work. He belonged to the number of young men who know as\nchildren that their parents’ hopes are centered on them, and\ndeliberately prepare themselves for a great career, subordinating\ntheir studies from the first to this end, carefully watching the\nindications of the course of events, calculating the probable turn\nthat affairs will take, that they may be the first to profit by them.\nBut for his observant curiosity, and the skill with which he managed\nto introduce himself into the salons of Paris, this story would not\nhave been colored by the tones of truth which it certainly owes to\nhim, for they are entirely due to his penetrating sagacity and desire\nto fathom the mysteries of an appalling condition of things, which was\nconcealed as carefully by the victim as by those who had brought it to\npass.",
        "Above the third story there was a garret where the linen was hung to\ndry, and a couple of attics. Christophe, the man-of-all-work, slept in\none, and Sylvie, the stout cook, in the other. Beside the seven\ninmates thus enumerated, taking one year with another, some eight law\nor medical students dined in the house, as well as two or three\nregular comers who lived in the neighborhood. There were usually\neighteen people at dinner, and there was room, if need be, for twenty\nat Mme. Vauquer’s table; at breakfast, however, only the seven lodgers\nappeared. It was almost like a family party. Every one came down in\ndressing-gown and slippers, and the conversation usually turned on\nanything that had happened the evening before; comments on the dress\nor appearance of the dinner contingent were exchanged in friendly\nconfidence.",
        "These seven lodgers were Mme. Vauquer’s spoiled children. Among them\nshe distributed, with astronomical precision, the exact proportion of\nrespect and attention due to the varying amounts they paid for their\nboard. One single consideration influenced all these human beings\nthrown together by chance. The two second-floor lodgers only paid\nseventy-two francs a month. Such prices as these are confined to the\nFaubourg Saint-Marcel and the district between La Bourbe and the\nSalpetriere; and, as might be expected, poverty, more or less\napparent, weighed upon them all, Mme. Couture being the sole exception\nto the rule.",
        "The dreary surroundings were reflected in the costumes of the inmates\nof the house; all were alike threadbare. The color of the men’s coats\nwere problematical; such shoes, in more fashionable quarters, are only\nto be seen lying in the gutter; the cuffs and collars were worn and\nfrayed at the edges; every limp article of clothing looked like the\nghost of its former self. The women’s dresses were faded,\nold-fashioned, dyed and re-dyed; they wore gloves that were glazed\nwith hard wear, much-mended lace, dingy ruffles, crumpled muslin\nfichus. So much for their clothing; but, for the most part, their\nframes were solid enough; their constitutions had weathered the storms\nof life; their cold, hard faces were worn like coins that have been\nwithdrawn from circulation, but there were greedy teeth behind the\nwithered lips. Dramas brought to a close or still in progress are\nforeshadowed by the sight of such actors as these, not the dramas that\nare played before the footlights and against a background of painted\ncanvas, but dumb dramas of life, frost-bound dramas that sere hearts\nlike fire, dramas that do not end with the actors’ lives.",
        "Mlle. Michonneau, that elderly young lady, screened her weak eyes from\nthe daylight by a soiled green silk shade with a rim of brass, an\nobject fit to scare away the Angel of Pity himself. Her shawl, with\nits scanty, draggled fringe, might have covered a skeleton, so meagre\nand angular was the form beneath it. Yet she must have been pretty and\nshapely once. What corrosive had destroyed the feminine outlines? Was\nit trouble, or vice, or greed? Had she loved too well? Had she been a\nsecond-hand clothes dealer, a frequenter of the backstairs of great\nhouses, or had she been merely a courtesan? Was she expiating the\nflaunting triumphs of a youth overcrowded with pleasures by an old age\nin which she was shunned by every passer-by? Her vacant gaze sent a\nchill through you; her shriveled face seemed like a menace. Her voice\nwas like the shrill, thin note of the grasshopper sounding from the\nthicket when winter is at hand. She said that she had nursed an old\ngentleman, ill of catarrh of the bladder, and left to die by his\nchildren, who thought that he had nothing left. His bequest to her, a\nlife annuity of a thousand francs, was periodically disputed by his\nheirs, who mingled slander with their persecutions. In spite of the\nravages of conflicting passions, her face retained some traces of its\nformer fairness and fineness of tissue, some vestiges of the physical\ncharms of her youth still survived.",
        "M. Poiret was a sort of automaton. He might be seen any day sailing\nlike a gray shadow along the walks of the Jardin des Plantes, on his\nhead a shabby cap, a cane with an old yellow ivory handle in the tips\nof his thin fingers; the outspread skirts of his threadbare overcoat\nfailed to conceal his meagre figure; his breeches hung loosely on his\nshrunken limbs; the thin, blue-stockinged legs trembled like those of\na drunken man; there was a notable breach of continuity between the\ndingy white waistcoat and crumpled shirt frills and the cravat twisted\nabout a throat like a turkey gobbler’s; altogether, his appearance set\npeople wondering whether this outlandish ghost belonged to the\naudacious race of the sons of Japhet who flutter about on the\nBoulevard Italien. What devouring kind of toil could have so shriveled\nhim? What devouring passions had darkened that bulbous countenance,\nwhich would have seemed outrageous as a caricature? What had he been?\nWell, perhaps he had been part of the machinery of justice, a clerk in\nthe office to which the executioner sends in his accounts,–so much\nfor providing black veils for parricides, so much for sawdust, so much\nfor pulleys and cord for the knife. Or he might have been a receiver\nat the door of a public slaughter-house, or a sub-inspector of\nnuisances. Indeed, the man appeared to have been one of the beasts of\nburden in our great social mill; one of those Parisian Ratons whom\ntheir Bertrands do not even know by sight; a pivot in the obscure\nmachinery that disposes of misery and things unclean; one of those\nmen, in short, at sight of whom we are prompted to remark that, “After\nall, we cannot do without them.”",
        "Stately Paris ignores the existence of these faces bleached by moral\nor physical suffering; but, then, Paris is in truth an ocean that no\nline can plumb. You may survey its surface and describe it; but no\nmatter how numerous and painstaking the toilers in this sea, there\nwill always be lonely and unexplored regions in its depths, caverns\nunknown, flowers and pearls and monsters of the deep overlooked or\nforgotten by the divers of literature. The Maison Vauquer is one of\nthese curious monstrosities.",
        "Two, however, of Mme. Vauquer’s boarders formed a striking contrast to\nthe rest. There was a sickly pallor, such as is often seen in anaemic\ngirls, in Mlle. Victorine Taillefer’s face; and her unvarying\nexpression of sadness, like her embarrassed manner and pinched look,\nwas in keeping with the general wretchedness of the establishment in\nthe Rue Nueve-Saint-Genevieve, which forms a background to this\npicture; but her face was young, there was youthfulness in her voice\nand elasticity in her movements. This young misfortune was not unlike\na shrub, newly planted in an uncongenial soil, where its leaves have\nalready begun to wither. The outlines of her figure, revealed by her\ndress of the simplest and cheapest materials, were also youthful.\nThere was the same kind of charm about her too slender form, her\nfaintly colored face and light-brown hair, that modern poets find in\nmediaeval statuettes; and a sweet expression, a look of Christian\nresignation in the dark gray eyes. She was pretty by force of\ncontrast; if she had been happy, she would have been charming.\nHappiness is the poetry of woman, as the toilette is her tinsel. If\nthe delightful excitement of a ball had made the pale face glow with\ncolor; if the delights of a luxurious life had brought the color to\nthe wan cheeks that were slightly hollowed already; if love had put\nlight into the sad eyes, then Victorine might have ranked among the\nfairest; but she lacked the two things which create woman a second\ntime–pretty dresses and love-letters.",
        "A book might have been made of her story. Her father was persuaded\nthat he had sufficient reason for declining to acknowledge her, and\nallowed her a bare six hundred francs a year; he had further taken\nmeasures to disinherit his daughter, and had converted all his real\nestate into personalty, that he might leave it undivided to his son.\nVictorine’s mother had died broken-hearted in Mme. Couture’s house;\nand the latter, who was a near relation, had taken charge of the\nlittle orphan. Unluckily, the widow of the commissary-general to the\narmies of the Republic had nothing in the world but her jointure and\nher widow’s pension, and some day she might be obliged to leave the\nhelpless, inexperienced girl to the mercy of the world. The good soul,\ntherefore, took Victorine to mass every Sunday, and to confession once\na fortnight, thinking that, in any case, she would bring up her ward\nto be devout. She was right; religion offered a solution of the\nproblem of the young girl’s future. The poor child loved the father\nwho refused to acknowledge her. Once every year she tried to see him\nto deliver her mother’s message of forgiveness, but every year\nhitherto she had knocked at that door in vain; her father was\ninexorable. Her brother, her only means of communication, had not come\nto see her for four years, and had sent her no assistance; yet she\nprayed to God to unseal her father’s eyes and to soften her brother’s\nheart, and no accusations mingled with her prayers. Mme. Couture and\nMme. Vauquer exhausted the vocabulary of abuse, and failed to find\nwords that did justice to the banker’s iniquitous conduct; but while\nthey heaped execrations on the millionaire, Victorine’s words were as\ngentle as the moan of the wounded dove, and affection found expression\neven in the cry drawn from her by pain.",
        "Eugene de Rastignac was a thoroughly southern type; he had a fair\ncomplexion, blue eyes, black hair. In his figure, manner, and his\nwhole bearing it was easy to see that he had either come of a noble\nfamily, or that, from his earliest childhood, he had been gently bred.\nIf he was careful of his wardrobe, only taking last year’s clothes\ninto daily wear, still upon occasion he could issue forth as a young\nman of fashion. Ordinarily he wore a shabby coat and waistcoat, the\nlimp black cravat, untidily knotted, that students affect, trousers\nthat matched the rest of his costume, and boots that had been resoled.",
        "Vautrin (the man of forty with the dyed whiskers) marked a transition\nstage between these two young people and the others. He was the kind\nof man that calls forth the remark: “He looks a jovial sort!” He had\nbroad shoulders, a well-developed chest, muscular arms, and strong\nsquare-fisted hands; the joints of his fingers were covered with tufts\nof fiery red hair. His face was furrowed by premature wrinkles; there\nwas a certain hardness about it in spite of his bland and insinuating\nmanner. His bass voice was by no means unpleasant, and was in keeping\nwith his boisterous laughter. He was always obliging, always in good\nspirits; if anything went wrong with one of the locks, he would soon\nunscrew it, take it to pieces, file it, oil and clean and set it in\norder, and put it back in its place again; “I am an old hand at it,\"\nhe used to say. Not only so, he knew all about ships, the sea, France,\nforeign countries, men, business, law, great houses and prisons,\n–there was nothing that he did not know. If any one complained rather\nmore than usual, he would offer his services at once. He had several\ntimes lent money to Mme. Vauquer, or to the boarders; but, somehow,\nthose whom he obliged felt that they would sooner face death than fail\nto repay him; a certain resolute look, sometimes seen on his face,\ninspired fear of him, for all his appearance of easy good-nature. In\nthe way he spat there was an imperturbable coolness which seemed to\nindicate that this was a man who would not stick at a crime to\nextricate himself from a false position. His eyes, like those of a\npitiless judge, seemed to go to the very bottom of all questions, to\nread all natures, all feelings and thoughts. His habit of life was\nvery regular; he usually went out after breakfast, returning in time\nfor dinner, and disappeared for the rest of the evening, letting\nhimself in about midnight with a latch key, a privilege that Mme.\nVauquer accorded to no other boarder. But then he was on very good\nterms with the widow; he used to call her “mamma,” and put his arm\nround her waist, a piece of flattery perhaps not appreciated to the\nfull! The worthy woman might imagine this to be an easy feat; but, as\na matter of fact, no arm but Vautrin’s was long enough to encircle\nher.",
        "It was a characteristic trait of his generously to pay fifteen francs\na month for the cup of coffee with a dash of brandy in it, which he\ntook after dinner. Less superficial observers than young men engulfed\nby the whirlpool of Parisian life, or old men, who took no interest in\nanything that did not directly concern them, would not have stopped\nshort at the vaguely unsatisfactory impression that Vautrin made upon\nthem. He knew or guessed the concerns of every one about him; but none\nof them had been able to penetrate his thoughts, or to discover his\noccupation. He had deliberately made his apparent good-nature, his\nunfailing readiness to oblige, and his high spirits into a barrier\nbetween himself and the rest of them, but not seldom he gave glimpses\nof appalling depths of character. He seemed to delight in scourging\nthe upper classes of society with the lash of his tongue, to take\npleasure in convicting it of inconsistency, in mocking at law and\norder with some grim jest worthy of Juvenal, as if some grudge against\nthe social system rankled in him, as if there were some mystery\ncarefully hidden away in his life.",
        "Mlle. Taillefer felt attracted, perhaps unconsciously, by the strength\nof the one man, and the good looks of the other; her stolen glances\nand secret thoughts were divided between them; but neither of them\nseemed to take any notice of her, although some day a chance might\nalter her position, and she would be a wealthy heiress. For that\nmatter, there was not a soul in the house who took any trouble to\ninvestigate the various chronicles of misfortunes, real or imaginary,\nrelated by the rest. Each one regarded the others with indifference,\ntempered by suspicion; it was a natural result of their relative\npositions. Practical assistance not one could give, this they all\nknew, and they had long since exhausted their stock of condolence over\nprevious discussions of their grievances. They were in something the\nsame position as an elderly couple who have nothing left to say to\neach other. The routine of existence kept them in contact, but they\nwere parts of a mechanism which wanted oil. There was not one of them\nbut would have passed a blind man begging in the street, not one that\nfelt moved to pity by a tale of misfortune, not one who did not see in\ndeath the solution of the all-absorbing problem of misery which left\nthem cold to the most terrible anguish in others.",
        "The happiest of these hapless beings was certainly Mme. Vauquer, who\nreigned supreme over this hospital supported by voluntary\ncontributions. For her, the little garden, which silence, and cold,\nand rain, and drought combined to make as dreary as an Asian steppe,\nwas a pleasant shaded nook; the gaunt yellow house, the musty odors of\na back shop had charms for her, and for her alone. Those cells\nbelonged to her. She fed those convicts condemned to penal servitude\nfor life, and her authority was recognized among them. Where else in\nParis would they have found wholesome food in sufficient quantity at\nthe prices she charged them, and rooms which they were at liberty to\nmake, if not exactly elegant or comfortable, at any rate clean and\nhealthy? If she had committed some flagrant act of injustice, the\nvictim would have borne it in silence.",
        "Such a gathering contained, as might have been expected, the elements\nout of which a complete society might be constructed. And, as in a\nschool, as in the world itself, there was among the eighteen men and\nwomen who met round the dinner table a poor creature, despised by all\nthe others, condemned to be the butt of all their jokes. At the\nbeginning of Eugene de Rastignac’s second twelvemonth, this figure\nsuddenly started out into bold relief against the background of human\nforms and faces among which the law student was yet to live for\nanother two years to come. This laughing-stock was the retired\nvermicelli-merchant, Father Goriot, upon whose face a painter, like\nthe historian, would have concentrated all the light in his picture.",
        "How had it come about that the boarders regarded him with a\nhalf-malignant contempt? Why did they subject the oldest among their\nnumber to a kind of persecution, in which there was mingled some pity,\nbut no respect for his misfortunes? Had he brought it on himself by\nsome eccentricity or absurdity, which is less easily forgiven or\nforgotten than more serious defects? The question strikes at the root\nof many a social injustice. Perhaps it is only human nature to inflict\nsuffering on anything that will endure suffering, whether by reason of\nits genuine humility, or indifference, or sheer helplessness. Do we not,\none and all, like to feel our strength even at the expense of some one\nor of something? The poorest sample of humanity, the street arab, will\npull the bell handle at every street door in bitter weather, and\nscramble up to write his name on the unsullied marble of a monument.",
        "In the year 1813, at the age of sixty-nine or thereabouts, “Father\nGoriot” had sold his business and retired–to Mme. Vauquer’s boarding\nhouse. When he first came there he had taken the rooms now occupied by\nMme. Couture; he had paid twelve hundred francs a year like a man to\nwhom five louis more or less was a mere trifle. For him Mme. Vauquer\nhad made various improvements in the three rooms destined for his use,\nin consideration of a certain sum paid in advance, so it was said, for\nthe miserable furniture, that is to say, for some yellow cotton\ncurtains, a few chairs of stained wood covered with Utrecht velvet,\nseveral wretched colored prints in frames, and wall papers that a\nlittle suburban tavern would have disdained. Possibly it was the\ncareless generosity with which Father Goriot allowed himself to be\noverreached at this period of his life (they called him Monsieur\nGoriot very respectfully then) that gave Mme. Vauquer the meanest\nopinion of his business abilities; she looked on him as an imbecile\nwhere money was concerned.",
        "Goriot had brought with him a considerable wardrobe, the gorgeous\noutfit of a retired tradesman who denies himself nothing. Mme.\nVauquer’s astonished eyes beheld no less than eighteen\ncambric-fronted shirts, the splendor of their fineness being enhanced\nby a pair of pins each bearing a large diamond, and connected by a\nshort chain, an ornament which adorned the vermicelli-maker’s shirt\nfront. He usually wore a coat of corn-flower blue; his rotund and\nportly person was still further set off by a clean white waistcoat,\nand a gold chain and seals which dangled over that broad expanse. When\nhis hostess accused him of being “a bit of a beau,” he smiled with the\nvanity of a citizen whose foible is gratified. His cupboards\n(ormoires, as he called them in the popular dialect) were filled\nwith a quantity of plate that he brought with him. The widow’s eyes\ngleamed as she obligingly helped him to unpack the soup ladles,\ntable-spoons, forks, cruet-stands, tureens, dishes, and breakfast\nservices–all of silver, which were duly arranged upon shelves, besides\na few more or less handsome pieces of plate, all weighing no\ninconsiderable number of ounces; he could not bring himself to part\nwith these gifts that reminded him of past domestic festivals.",
        "“This was my wife’s present to me on the first anniversary of our\nwedding day,” he said to Mme. Vauquer, as he put away a little silver\nposset dish, with two turtle-doves billing on the cover. “Poor dear!\nshe spent on it all the money she had saved before we were married. Do\nyou know, I would sooner scratch the earth with my nails for a living,\nmadame, than part with that. But I shall be able to take my coffee out\nof it every morning for the rest of my days, thank the Lord! I am not\nto be pitied. There’s not much fear of my starving for some time to\ncome.”",
        "Finally, Mme. Vauquer’s magpie’s eye had discovered and read certain\nentries in the list of shareholders in the funds, and, after a rough\ncalculation, was disposed to credit Goriot (worthy man) with something\nlike ten thousand francs a year. From that day forward Mme. Vauquer\n(nee de Conflans), who, as a matter of fact, had seen forty-eight\nsummers, though she would only own to thirty-nine of them–Mme.\nVauquer had her own ideas. Though Goriot’s eyes seemed to have shrunk\nin their sockets, though they were weak and watery, owing to some\nglandular affection which compelled him to wipe them continually, she\nconsidered him to be a very gentlemanly and pleasant-looking man.\nMoreover, the widow saw favorable indications of character in the\nwell-developed calves of his legs and in his square-shaped nose,\nindications still further borne out by the worthy man’s full-moon\ncountenance and look of stupid good-nature. This, in all probability,\nwas a strongly-build animal, whose brains mostly consisted in a\ncapacity for affection. His hair, worn in ailes de pigeon, and duly\npowdered every morning by the barber from the Ecole Polytechnique,\ndescribed five points on his low forehead, and made an elegant setting\nto his face. Though his manners were somewhat boorish, he was always\nas neat as a new pin and he took his snuff in a lordly way, like a man\nwho knows that his snuff-box is always likely to be filled with\nmaccaboy, so that when Mme. Vauquer lay down to rest on the day of M.\nGoriot’s installation, her heart, like a larded partridge, sweltered\nbefore the fire of a burning desire to shake off the shroud of Vauquer\nand rise again as Goriot. She would marry again, sell her\nboarding-house, give her hand to this fine flower of citizenship,\nbecome a lady of consequence in the quarter, and ask for subscriptions\nfor charitable purposes; she would make little Sunday excursions to\nChoisy, Soissy, Gentilly; she would have a box at the theatre when she\nliked, instead of waiting for the author’s tickets that one of her\nboarders sometimes gave her, in July; the whole Eldorado of a little\nParisian household rose up before Mme. Vauquer in her dreams. Nobody\nknew that she herself possessed forty thousand francs, accumulated sou\nby sou, that was her secret; surely as far as money was concerned she\nwas a very tolerable match. “And in other respects, I am quite his\nequal,” she said to herself, turning as if to assure herself of the\ncharms of a form that the portly Sylvie found moulded in down feathers\nevery morning.",
        "For three months from that day Mme. Veuve Vauquer availed herself of\nthe services of M. Goriot’s coiffeur, and went to some expense over\nher toilette, expense justifiable on the ground that she owed it to\nherself and her establishment to pay some attention to appearances\nwhen such highly-respectable persons honored her house with their\npresence. She expended no small amount of ingenuity in a sort of\nweeding process of her lodgers, announcing her intention of receiving\nhenceforward none but people who were in every way select. If a\nstranger presented himself, she let him know that M. Goriot, one of\nthe best known and most highly-respected merchants in Paris, had\nsingled out her boarding-house for a residence. She drew up a\nprospectus headed MAISON VAUQUER, in which it was asserted that hers\nwas ’one of the oldest and most highly recommended boarding-houses in\nthe Latin Quarter.” “From the windows of the house,” thus ran the\nprospectus, “there is a charming view of the Vallee des Gobelins (so\nthere is–from the third floor), and a beautiful garden, extendingdown to an avenue of lindens at the further end.” Mention was made\nof the bracing air of the place and its quiet situation.",
        "It was this prospectus that attracted Mme. la Comtesse de\nl’Ambermesnil, a widow of six and thirty, who was awaiting the final\nsettlement of her husband’s affairs, and of another matter regarding a\npension due to her as the wife of a general who had died “on the field\nof battle.” On this Mme. Vauquer saw to her table, lighted a fire\ndaily in the sitting-room for nearly six months, and kept the promise\nof her prospectus, even going to some expense to do so. And the\nCountess, on her side, addressed Mme. Vauquer as “my dear,” and\npromised her two more boarders, the Baronne de Vaumerland and the\nwidow of a colonel, the late Comte de Picquoisie, who were about to\nleave a boarding-house in the Marais, where the terms were higher than\nat the Maison Vauquer. Both these ladies, moreover, would be very well\nto do when the people at the War Office had come to an end of their\nformalities. “But Government departments are always so dilatory,” the\nlady added.",
        "After dinner the two widows went together up to Mme. Vauquer’s room,\nand had a snug little chat over some cordial and various delicacies\nreserved for the mistress of the house. Mme. Vauquer’s ideas as to\nGoriot were cordially approved by Mme. de l’Ambermesnil; it was a\ncapital notion, which for that matter she had guessed from the very\nfirst; in her opinion the vermicelli maker was an excellent man.",
        "“Ah! my dear lady, such a well-preserved man of his age, as sound as\nmy eyesight–a man who might make a woman happy!” said the widow.",
        "The good-natured Countess turned to the subject of Mme. Vauquer’s\ndress, which was not in harmony with her projects. “You must put\nyourself on a war footing,” said she.",
        "After much serious consideration the two widows went shopping\ntogether–they purchased a hat adorned with ostrich feathers and a cap\nat the Palais Royal, and the Countess took her friend to the Magasin\nde la Petite Jeannette, where they chose a dress and a scarf. Thus\nequipped for the campaign, the widow looked exactly like the prize\nanimal hung out for a sign above an a la mode beef shop; but she\nherself was so much pleased with the improvement, as she considered\nit, in her appearance, that she felt that she lay under some\nobligation to the Countess; and, though by no means open-handed, she\nbegged that lady to accept a hat that cost twenty francs. The fact was\nthat she needed the Countess’ services on the delicate mission of\nsounding Goriot; the countess must sing her praises in his ears. Mme.\nde l’Ambermesnil lent herself very good-naturedly to this manoeuvre,\nbegan her operations, and succeeded in obtaining a private interview;\nbut the overtures that she made, with a view to securing him for\nherself, were received with embarrassment, not to say a repulse. She\nleft him, revolted by his coarseness.",
        "“My angel,” said she to her dear friend, “you will make nothing of\nthat man yonder. He is absurdly suspicious, and he is a mean\ncurmudgeon, an idiot, a fool; you would never be happy with him.”",
        "After what had passed between M. Goriot and Mme. de l’Ambermesnil, the\nCountess would no longer live under the same roof. She left the next\nday, forgot to pay for six months’ board, and left behind her\nwardrobe, cast-off clothing to the value of five francs. Eagerly and\npersistently as Mme. Vauquer sought her quondam lodger, the Comtesse\nde l’Ambermesnil was never heard of again in Paris. The widow often\ntalked of this deplorable business, and regretted her own too\nconfiding disposition. As a matter of fact, she was as suspicious as a\ncat; but she was like many other people, who cannot trust their own\nkin and put themselves at the mercy of the next chance comer–an odd\nbut common phenomenon, whose causes may readily be traced to the\ndepths of the human heart.",
        "Perhaps there are people who know that they have nothing more to look\nfor from those with whom they live; they have shown the emptiness of\ntheir hearts to their housemates, and in their secret selves they are\nconscious that they are severely judged, and that they deserve to be\njudged severely; but still they feel an unconquerable craving for\npraises that they do not hear, or they are consumed by a desire to\nappear to possess, in the eyes of a new audience, the qualities which\nthey have not, hoping to win the admiration or affection of strangers\nat the risk of forfeiting it again some day. Or, once more, there are\nother mercenary natures who never do a kindness to a friend or a\nrelation simply because these have a claim upon them, while a service\ndone to a stranger brings its reward to self-love. Such natures feel\nbut little affection for those who are nearest to them; they keep\ntheir kindness for remoter circles of acquaintance, and show most to\nthose who dwell on its utmost limits. Mme. Vauquer belonged to both\nthese essentially mean, false, and execrable classes.",
        "“If I had been there at the time,” Vautrin would say at the end of the\nstory, “I would have shown her up, and that misfortune would not have\nbefallen you. I know that kind of phiz!”",
        "Like all narrow natures, Mme. Vauquer was wont to confine her\nattention to events, and did not go very deeply into the causes that\nbrought them about; she likewise preferred to throw the blame of her\nown mistakes on other people, so she chose to consider that the honest\nvermicelli maker was responsible for her misfortune. It had opened her\neyes, so she said, with regard to him. As soon as she saw that her\nblandishments were in vain, and that her outlay on her toilette was\nmoney thrown away, she was not slow to discover the reason of his\nindifference. It became plain to her at once that there was some\nother attraction, to use her own expression. In short, it was evident\nthat the hope she had so fondly cherished was a baseless delusion, and\nthat she would “never make anything out of that man yonder,” in the\nCountess’ forcible phrase. The Countess seemed to have been a judge of\ncharacter. Mme. Vauquer’s aversion was naturally more energetic than\nher friendship, for her hatred was not in proportion to her love, but\nto her disappointed expectations. The human heart may find here and\nthere a resting-place short of the highest height of affection, but we\nseldom stop in the steep, downward slope of hatred. Still, M. Goriot\nwas a lodger, and the widow’s wounded self-love could not vent itself\nin an explosion of wrath; like a monk harassed by the prior of his\nconvent, she was forced to stifle her sighs of disappointment, and to\ngulp down her craving for revenge. Little minds find gratification for\ntheir feelings, benevolent or otherwise, by a constant exercise of\npetty ingenuity. The widow employed her woman’s malice to devise a\nsystem of covert persecution. She began by a course of retrenchment\n–various luxuries which had found their way to the table appeared\nthere no more.",
        "“No more gherkins, no more anchovies; they have made a fool of me!\"\nshe said to Sylvie one morning, and they returned to the old bill of\nfare.",
        "The thrifty frugality necessary to those who mean to make their way in\nthe world had become an inveterate habit of life with M. Goriot. Soup,\nboiled beef, and a dish of vegetables had been, and always would be,\nthe dinner he liked best, so Mme. Vauquer found it very difficult to\nannoy a boarder whose tastes were so simple. He was proof against her\nmalice, and in desperation she spoke to him and of him slightingly\nbefore the other lodgers, who began to amuse themselves at his\nexpense, and so gratified her desire for revenge.",
        "Towards the end of the first year the widow’s suspicions had reached\nsuch a pitch that she began to wonder how it was that a retired\nmerchant with a secure income of seven or eight thousand livres, the\nowner of such magnificent plate and jewelry handsome enough for a kept\nmistress, should be living in her house. Why should he devote so small\na proportion of his money to his expenses? Until the first year was\nnearly at an end, Goriot had dined out once or twice every week, but\nthese occasions came less frequently, and at last he was scarcely\nabsent from the dinner-table twice a month. It was hardly expected\nthat Mme. Vauquer should regard the increased regularity of her\nboarder’s habits with complacency, when those little excursions of his\nhad been so much to her interest. She attributed the change not so\nmuch to a gradual diminution of fortune as to a spiteful wish to annoy\nhis hostess. It is one of the most detestable habits of a Liliputian\nmind to credit other people with its own malignant pettiness.",
        "Unluckily, towards the end of the second year, M. Goriot’s conduct\ngave some color to the idle talk about him. He asked Mme. Vauquer to\ngive him a room on the second floor, and to make a corresponding\nreduction in her charges. Apparently, such strict economy was called\nfor, that he did without a fire all through the winter. Mme. Vauquer\nasked to be paid in advance, an arrangement to which M. Goriot\nconsented, and thenceforward she spoke of him as “Father Goriot.”",
        "What had brought about this decline and fall? Conjecture was keen, but\ninvestigation was difficult. Father Goriot was not communicative; in\nthe sham countess’ phrase he was “a curmudgeon.” Empty-headed people\nwho babble about their own affairs because they have nothing else to\noccupy them, naturally conclude that if people say nothing of their\ndoings it is because their doings will not bear being talked about; so\nthe highly respectable merchant became a scoundrel, and the late beau\nwas an old rogue. Opinion fluctuated. Sometimes, according to Vautrin,\nwho came about this time to live in the Maison Vauquer, Father Goriot\nwas a man who went on ’Change and dabbled (to use the sufficiently\nexpressive language of the Stock Exchange) in stocks and shares after\nhe had ruined himself by heavy speculation. Sometimes it was held that\nhe was one of those petty gamblers who nightly play for small stakes\nuntil they win a few francs. A theory that he was a detective in the\nemploy of the Home Office found favor at one time, but Vautrin urged\nthat “Goriot was not sharp enough for one of that sort.” There were\nyet other solutions; Father Goriot was a skinflint, a shark of a\nmoney-lender, a man who lived by selling lottery tickets. He was by\nturns all the most mysterious brood of vice and shame and misery; yet,\nhowever vile his life might be, the feeling of repulsion which he\naroused in others was not so strong that he must be banished from\ntheir society–he paid his way. Besides, Goriot had his uses, every\none vented his spleen or sharpened his wit on him; he was pelted with\njokes and belabored with hard words. The general consensus of opinion\nwas in favor of a theory which seemed the most likely; this was Mme.\nVauquer’s view. According to her, the man so well preserved at his\ntime of life, as sound as her eyesight, with whom a woman might be\nvery happy, was a libertine who had strange tastes. These are the\nfacts upon which Mme. Vauquer’s slanders were based.",
        "Early one morning, some few months after the departure of the unlucky\nCountess who had managed to live for six months at the widow’s\nexpense, Mme. Vauquer (not yet dressed) heard the rustle of a silk\ndress and a young woman’s light footstep on the stair; some one was\ngoing to Goriot’s room. He seemed to expect the visit, for his door\nstood ajar. The portly Sylvie presently came up to tell her mistress\nthat a girl too pretty to be honest, “dressed like a goddess,” and not\na speck of mud on her laced cashmere boots, had glided in from the\nstreet like a snake, had found the kitchen, and asked for M. Goriot’s\nroom. Mme. Vauquer and the cook, listening, overheard several words\naffectionately spoken during the visit, which lasted for some time.\nWhen M. Goriot went downstairs with the lady, the stout Sylvie\nforthwith took her basket and followed the lover-like couple, under\npretext of going to do her marketing.",
        "“M. Goriot must be awfully rich, all the same, madame,” she reported\non her return, “to keep her in such style. Just imagine it! There was\na splendid carriage waiting at the corner of the Place de l’Estrapade,\nand she got into it.”",
        "While they were at dinner that evening, Mme. Vauquer went to the\nwindow and drew the curtain, as the sun was shining into Goriot’s\neyes.",
        "“You are beloved of fair ladies, M. Goriot–the sun seeks you out,\"\nshe said, alluding to his visitor. ’Peste! you have good taste; she\nwas very pretty.”",
        "“That was my daughter,” he said, with a kind of pride in his voice,\nand the rest chose to consider this as the fatuity of an old man who\nwishes to save appearances.",
        "A month after this visit M. Goriot received another. The same daughter\nwho had come to see him that morning came again after dinner, this\ntime in evening dress. The boarders, in deep discussion in the\ndining-room, caught a glimpse of a lovely, fair-haired woman, slender,\ngraceful, and much too distinguished-looking to be a daughter of\nFather Goriot’s.",
        "“Two of them!” cried the portly Sylvie, who did not recognize the lady\nof the first visit.",
        "A few days later, and another young lady–a tall, well-moulded\nbrunette, with dark hair and bright eyes–came to ask for M. Goriot.",
        "“Three of them!” said Sylvie.",
        "Then the second daughter, who had first come in the morning to see her\nfather, came shortly afterwards in the evening. She wore a ball dress,\nand came in a carriage.",
        "“Four of them!” commented Mme. Vauquer and her plump handmaid. Sylvie\nsaw not a trace of resemblance between this great lady and the girl in\nher simple morning dress who had entered her kitchen on the occasion\nof her first visit.",
        "At that time Goriot was paying twelve hundred francs a year to his\nlandlady, and Mme. Vauquer saw nothing out of the common in the fact\nthat a rich man had four or five mistresses; nay, she thought it very\nknowing of him to pass them off as his daughters. She was not at all\ninclined to draw a hard-and-fast line, or to take umbrage at his\nsending for them to the Maison Vauquer; yet, inasmuch as these visits\nexplained her boarder’s indifference to her, she went so far (at the\nend of the second year) as to speak of him as an “ugly old wretch.\"\nWhen at length her boarder declined to nine hundred francs a year, she\nasked him very insolently what he took her house to be, after meeting\none of these ladies on the stairs. Father Goriot answered that the\nlady was his eldest daughter.",
        "“So you have two or three dozen daughters, have you?” said Mme.\nVauquer sharply.",
        "“I have only two,” her boarder answered meekly, like a ruined man who\nis broken in to all the cruel usage of misfortune.",
        "Towards the end of the third year Father Goriot reduced his expenses\nstill further; he went up to the third story, and now paid forty-five\nfrancs a month. He did without snuff, told his hairdresser that he no\nlonger required his services, and gave up wearing powder. When Goriot\nappeared for the first time in this condition, an exclamation of\nastonishment broke from his hostess at the color of his hair–a dingy\nolive gray. He had grown sadder day by day under the influence of some\nhidden trouble; among all the faces round the table, his was the most\nwoe-begone. There was no longer any doubt. Goriot was an elderly\nlibertine, whose eyes had only been preserved by the skill of the\nphysician from the malign influence of the remedies necessitated by\nthe state of his health. The disgusting color of his hair was a result\nof his excesses and of the drugs which he had taken that he might\ncontinue his career. The poor old man’s mental and physical condition\nafforded some grounds for the absurd rubbish talked about him. When\nhis outfit was worn out, he replaced the fine linen by calico at\nfourteen sous the ell. His diamonds, his gold snuff-box, watch-chain\nand trinkets, disappeared one by one. He had left off wearing the\ncorn-flower blue coat, and was sumptuously arrayed, summer as well as\nwinter, in a coarse chestnut-brown coat, a plush waistcoat, and\ndoeskin breeches. He grew thinner and thinner; his legs were shrunken,\nhis cheeks, once so puffed out by contented bourgeois prosperity, were\ncovered with wrinkles, and the outlines of the jawbones were\ndistinctly visible; there were deep furrows in his forehead. In the\nfourth year of his residence in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve he was\nno longer like his former self. The hale vermicelli manufacturer,\nsixty-two years of age, who had looked scarce forty, the stout,\ncomfortable, prosperous tradesman, with an almost bucolic air, and\nsuch a brisk demeanor that it did you good to look at him; the man\nwith something boyish in his smile, had suddenly sunk into his dotage,\nand had become a feeble, vacillating septuagenarian.",
        "The keen, bright blue eyes had grown dull, and faded to a steel-gray\ncolor; the red inflamed rims looked as though they had shed tears of\nblood. He excited feelings of repulsion in some, and of pity in\nothers. The young medical students who came to the house noticed the\ndrooping of his lower lip and the conformation of the facial angle;\nand, after teasing him for some time to no purpose, they declared that\ncretinism was setting in.",
        "One evening after dinner Mme. Vauquer said half banteringly to him,\n\"So those daughters of yours don’t come to see you any more, eh?\"\nmeaning to imply her doubts as to his paternity; but Father Goriot\nshrank as if his hostess had touched him with a sword-point.",
        "“They come sometimes,” he said in a tremulous voice.",
        "“Aha! you still see them sometimes?” cried the students. “Bravo,\nFather Goriot!”",
        "The old man scarcely seemed to hear the witticisms at his expense that\nfollowed on the words; he had relapsed into the dreamy state of mind\nthat these superficial observers took for senile torpor, due to his\nlack of intelligence. If they had only known, they might have been\ndeeply interested by the problem of his condition; but few problems\nwere more obscure. It was easy, of course, to find out whether Goriot\nhad really been a vermicelli manufacturer; the amount of his fortune\nwas readily discoverable; but the old people, who were most\ninquisitive as to his concerns, never went beyond the limits of the\nQuarter, and lived in the lodging-house much as oysters cling to a\nrock. As for the rest, the current of life in Paris daily awaited\nthem, and swept them away with it; so soon as they left the Rue\nNeuve-Sainte-Genevieve, they forgot the existence of the old man,\ntheir butt at dinner. For those narrow souls, or for careless youth,\nthe misery in Father Goriot’s withered face and its dull apathy were\nquite incompatible with wealth or any sort of intelligence. As for the\ncreatures whom he called his daughters, all Mme. Vauquer’s boarders\nwere of her opinion. With the faculty for severe logic sedulously\ncultivated by elderly women during long evenings of gossip till they\ncan always find an hypothesis to fit all circumstances, she was wont\nto reason thus:",
        "“If Father Goriot had daughters of his own as rich as those ladies who\ncame here seemed to be, he would not be lodging in my house, on the\nthird floor, at forty-five francs a month; and he would not go about\ndressed like a poor man.”",
        "No objection could be raised to these inferences. So by the end of the\nmonth of November 1819, at the time when the curtain rises on this\ndrama, every one in the house had come to have a very decided opinion\nas to the poor old man. He had never had either wife or daughter;\nexcesses had reduced him to this sluggish condition; he was a sort of\nhuman mollusk who should be classed among the capulidoe, so one of the\ndinner contingent, an employe at the Museum, who had a pretty wit of\nhis own. Poiret was an eagle, a gentleman, compared with Goriot.\nPoiret would join the talk, argue, answer when he was spoken to; as a\nmatter of fact, his talk, arguments, and responses contributed nothing\nto the conversation, for Poiret had a habit of repeating what the\nothers said in different words; still, he did join in the talk; he was\nalive, and seemed capable of feeling; while Father Goriot (to quote\nthe Museum official again) was invariably at zero degrees–Reaumur.",
        "Eugene de Rastignac had just returned to Paris in a state of mind not\nunknown to young men who are conscious of unusual powers, and to those\nwhose faculties are so stimulated by a difficult position, that for\nthe time being they rise above the ordinary level.",
        "Rastignac’s first year of study for the preliminary examinations in\nlaw had left him free to see the sights of Paris and to enjoy some of\nits amusements. A student has not much time on his hands if he sets\nhimself to learn the repertory of every theatre, and to study the ins\nand outs of the labyrinth of Paris. To know its customs; to learn the\nlanguage, and become familiar with the amusements of the capital, he\nmust explore its recesses, good and bad, follow the studies that\nplease him best, and form some idea of the treasures contained in\ngalleries and museums.",
        "At this stage of his career a student grows eager and excited about\nall sorts of follies that seem to him to be of immense importance. He\nhas his hero, his great man, a professor at the College de France,\npaid to talk down to the level of his audience. He adjusts his cravat,\nand strikes various attitudes for the benefit of the women in the\nfirst galleries at the Opera-Comique. As he passes through all these\nsuccessive initiations, and breaks out of his sheath, the horizons of\nlife widen around him, and at length he grasps the plan of society\nwith the different human strata of which it is composed.",
        "If he begins by admiring the procession of carriages on sunny\nafternoons in the Champs-Elysees, he soon reaches the further stage of\nenvying their owners. Unconsciously, Eugene had served his\napprenticeship before he went back to Angouleme for the long vacation\nafter taking his degrees as bachelor of arts and bachelor of law. The\nillusions of childhood had vanished, so also had the ideas he brought\nwith him from the provinces; he had returned thither with an\nintelligence developed, with loftier ambitions, and saw things as they\nwere at home in the old manor house. His father and mother, his two\nbrothers and two sisters, with an aged aunt, whose whole fortune\nconsisted in annuities, lived on the little estate of Rastignac. The\nwhole property brought in about three thousand francs; and though the\namount varied with the season (as must always be the case in a\nvine-growing district), they were obliged to spare an unvarying twelve\nhundred francs out of their income for him. He saw how constantly the\npoverty, which they had generously hidden from him, weighed upon them;\nhe could not help comparing the sisters, who had seemed so beautiful\nto his boyish eyes, with women in Paris, who had realized the beauty\nof his dreams. The uncertain future of the whole family depended upon\nhim. It did not escape his eyes that not a crumb was wasted in the\nhouse, nor that the wine they drank was made from the second pressing;\na multitude of small things, which it is useless to speak of in detail\nhere, made him burn to distinguish himself, and his ambition to\nsucceed increased tenfold.",
        "He meant, like all great souls, that his success should be owing\nentirely to his merits; but his was pre-eminently a southern\ntemperament, the execution of his plans was sure to be marred by the\nvertigo that seizes on youth when youth sees itself alone in a wide\nsea, uncertain how to spend its energies, whither to steer its course,\nhow to adapt its sails to the winds. At first he determined to fling\nhimself heart and soul into his work, but he was diverted from this\npurpose by the need of society and connections; then he saw how great\nan influence women exert in social life, and suddenly made up his mind\nto go out into this world to seek a protectress there. Surely a clever\nand high-spirited young man, whose wit and courage were set off to\nadvantage by a graceful figure and the vigorous kind of beauty that\nreadily strikes a woman’s imagination, need not despair of finding a\nprotectress. These ideas occurred to him in his country walks with his\nsisters, whom he had once joined so gaily. The girls thought him very\nmuch changed.",
        "His aunt, Mme. de Marcillac, had been presented at court, and had\nmoved among the brightest heights of that lofty region. Suddenly the\nyoung man’s ambition discerned in those recollections of hers, which\nhad been like nursery fairy tales to her nephews and nieces, the\nelements of a social success at least as important as the success\nwhich he had achieved at the Ecole de Droit. He began to ask his aunt\nabout those relations; some of the old ties might still hold good.\nAfter much shaking of the branches of the family tree, the old lady\ncame to the conclusion that of all persons who could be useful to her\nnephew among the selfish genus of rich relations, the Vicomtesse de\nBeauseant was the least likely to refuse. To this lady, therefore, she\nwrote in the old-fashioned style, recommending Eugene to her; pointing\nout to her nephew that if he succeeded in pleasing Mme. de Beauseant,\nthe Vicomtesse would introduce him to other relations. A few days\nafter his return to Paris, therefore, Rastignac sent his aunt’s letter\nto Mme. de Beauseant. The Vicomtesse replied by an invitation to a\nball for the following evening. This was the position of affairs at\nthe Maison Vauquer at the end of November 1819.",
        "A few days later, after Mme. de Beauseant’s ball, Eugene came in at\ntwo o’clock in the morning. The persevering student meant to make up\nfor the lost time by working until daylight. It was the first time\nthat he had attempted to spend the night in this way in that silent\nquarter. The spell of a factitious energy was upon him; he had beheld\nthe pomp and splendor of the world. He had not dined at the Maison\nVauquer; the boarders probably would think that he would walk home at\ndaybreak from the dance, as he had done sometimes on former occasions,\nafter a fete at the Prado, or a ball at the Odeon, splashing his silk\nstockings thereby, and ruining his pumps.",
        "It so happened that Christophe took a look into the street before\ndrawing the bolts of the door; and Rastignac, coming in at that\nmoment, could go up to his room without making any noise, followed by\nChristophe, who made a great deal. Eugene exchanged his dress suit for\na shabby overcoat and slippers, kindled a fire with some blocks of\npatent fuel, and prepared for his night’s work in such a sort that the\nfaint sounds he made were drowned by Christophe’s heavy tramp on the\nstairs.",
        "Eugene sat absorbed in thought for a few moments before plunging into\nhis law books. He had just become aware of the fact that the\nVicomtesse de Beauseant was one of the queens of fashion, that her\nhouse was thought to be the pleasantest in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\nAnd not only so, she was, by right of her fortune, and the name she\nbore, one of the most conspicuous figures in that aristocratic world.\nThanks to the aunt, thanks to Mme. de Marcillac’s letter of\nintroduction, the poor student had been kindly received in that house\nbefore he knew the extent of the favor thus shown to him. It was\nalmost like a patent of nobility to be admitted to those gilded\nsalons; he had appeared in the most exclusive circle in Paris, and now\nall doors were open for him. Eugene had been dazzled at first by the\nbrilliant assembly, and had scarcely exchanged a few words with the\nVicomtesse; he had been content to single out a goddess among this\nthrong of Parisian divinities, one of those women who are sure to\nattract a young man’s fancy.",
        "The Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud was tall and gracefully made; she\nhad one of the prettiest figures in Paris. Imagine a pair of great\ndark eyes, a magnificently moulded hand, a shapely foot. There was a\nfiery energy in her movements; the Marquis de Ronquerolles had called\nher “a thoroughbred,” “a pure pedigree,” these figures of speech have\nreplaced the “heavenly angel” and Ossianic nomenclature; the old\nmythology of love is extinct, doomed to perish by modern dandyism. But\nfor Rastignac, Mme. Anastasie de Restaud was the woman for whom he had\nsighed. He had contrived to write his name twice upon the list of\npartners upon her fan, and had snatched a few words with her during\nthe first quadrille.",
        "“Where shall I meet you again, Madame?” he asked abruptly, and the\ntones of his voice were full of the vehement energy that women like so\nwell.",
        "“Oh, everywhere!” said she, “in the Bois, at the Bouffons, in my own\nhouse.”",
        "With the impetuosity of his adventurous southern temper, he did all he\ncould to cultivate an acquaintance with this lovely countess, making\nthe best of his opportunities in the quadrille and during a waltz that\nshe gave him. When he told her that he was a cousin of Mme. de\nBeauseant’s, the Countess, whom he took for a great lady, asked him to\ncall at her house, and after her parting smile, Rastignac felt\nconvinced that he must make this visit. He was so lucky as to light\nupon some one who did not laugh at his ignorance, a fatal defect among\nthe gilded and insolent youth of that period; the coterie of\nMaulincourts, Maximes de Trailles, de Marsays, Ronquerolles,\nAjuda-Pintos, and Vandenesses who shone there in all the glory of\ncoxcombry among the best-dressed women of fashion in Paris–Lady\nBrandon, the Duchesse de Langeais, the Comtesse de Kergarouet, Mme. de\nSerizy, the Duchesse de Carigliano, the Comtesse Ferraud, Mme. de Lanty,\nthe Marquise d’Aiglemont, Mme. Firmiani, the Marquise de Listomere and\nthe Marquise d’Espard, the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and the Grandlieus.\nLuckily, therefore, for him, the novice happened upon the Marquis de\nMontriveau, the lover of the Duchesse de Langeais, a general as simple\nas a child; from him Rastignac learned that the Comtesse lived in the\nRue du Helder.",
        "Ah, what it is to be young, eager to see the world, greedily on the\nwatch for any chance that brings you nearer the woman of your dreams,\nand behold two houses open their doors to you! To set foot in the\nVicomtesse de Beauseant’s house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; to fall\non your knees before a Comtesse de Restaud in the Chaussee d’Antin; to\nlook at one glance across a vista of Paris drawing-rooms, conscious\nthat, possessing sufficient good looks, you may hope to find aid and\nprotection there in a feminine heart! To feel ambitious enough to\nspurn the tight-rope on which you must walk with the steady head of an\nacrobat for whom a fall is impossible, and to find in a charming woman\nthe best of all balancing poles.",
        "He sat there with his thoughts for a while, Law on the one hand, and\nPoverty on the other, beholding a radiant vision of a woman rise above\nthe dull, smouldering fire. Who would not have paused and questioned\nthe future as Eugene was doing? who would not have pictured it full of\nsuccess? His wondering thoughts took wings; he was transported out of\nthe present into that blissful future; he was sitting by Mme. de\nRestaud’s side, when a sort of sigh, like the grunt of an overburdened\nSt. Joseph, broke the silence of the night. It vibrated through the\nstudent, who took the sound for a death groan. He opened his door\nnoiselessly, went out upon the landing, and saw a thin streak of light\nunder Father Goriot’s door. Eugene feared that his neighbor had been\ntaken ill; he went over and looked through the keyhole; the old man\nwas busily engaged in an occupation so singular and so suspicious that\nRastignac thought he was only doing a piece of necessary service to\nsociety to watch the self-styled vermicelli maker’s nocturnal\nindustries.",
        "The table was upturned, and Goriot had doubtless in some way secured a\nsilver plate and cup to the bar before knotting a thick rope round\nthem; he was pulling at this rope with such enormous force that they\nwere being crushed and twisted out of shape; to all appearance he\nmeant to convert the richly wrought metal into ingots.",
        "“Peste! what a man!” said Rastignac, as he watched Goriot’s muscular\narms; there was not a sound in the room while the old man, with the\naid of the rope, was kneading the silver like dough. “Was he then,\nindeed, a thief, or a receiver of stolen goods, who affected\nimbecility and decrepitude, and lived like a beggar that he might\ncarry on his pursuits the more securely?” Eugene stood for a moment\nrevolving these questions, then he looked again through the keyhole.",
        "Father Goriot had unwound his coil of rope; he had covered the table\nwith a blanket, and was now employed in rolling the flattened mass of\nsilver into a bar, an operation which he performed with marvelous\ndexterity.",
        "“Why, he must be as strong as Augustus, King of Poland!” said Eugene\nto himself when the bar was nearly finished.",
        "Father Goriot looked sadly at his handiwork, tears fell from his eyes,\nhe blew out the dip which had served him for a light while he\nmanipulated the silver, and Eugene heard him sigh as he lay down\nagain.",
        "“He is mad,” thought the student.",
        "“Poor child!” Father Goriot said aloud. Rastignac, hearing those\nwords, concluded to keep silence; he would not hastily condemn his\nneighbor. He was just in the doorway of his room when a strange sound\nfrom the staircase below reached his ears; it might have been made by\ntwo men coming up in list slippers. Eugene listened; two men there\ncertainly were, he could hear their breathing. Yet there had been no\nsound of opening the street door, no footsteps in the passage.\nSuddenly, too, he saw a faint gleam of light on the second story; it\ncame from M. Vautrin’s room.",
        "“There are a good many mysteries here for a lodging-house!” he said to\nhimself.",
        "He went part of the way downstairs and listened again. The rattle of\ngold reached his ears. In another moment the light was put out, and\nagain he distinctly heard the breathing of two men, but no sound of a\ndoor being opened or shut. The two men went downstairs, the faint\nsounds growing fainter as they went.",
        "“Who is there?” cried Mme. Vauquer out of her bedroom window.",
        "“I, Mme. Vauquer,” answered Vautrin’s deep bass voice. “I am coming\nin.”",
        "“That is odd! Christophe drew the bolts,” said Eugene, going back to\nhis room. “You have to sit up at night, it seems, if you really mean\nto know all that is going on about you in Paris.”",
        "These incidents turned his thought from his ambitious dreams; he\nbetook himself to his work, but his thought wandered back to Father\nGoriot’s suspicious occupation; Mme. de Restaud’s face swam again and\nagain before his eyes like a vision of a brilliant future; and at last\nhe lay down and slept with clenched fists. When a young man makes up\nhis mind that he will work all night, the chances are that seven times\nout of ten he will sleep till morning. Such vigils do not begin before\nwe are turned twenty.",
        "The next morning Paris was wrapped in one of the dense fogs that throw\nthe most punctual people out in their calculations as to the time;\neven the most business-like folk fail to keep their appointments in\nsuch weather, and ordinary mortals wake up at noon and fancy it is\neight o’clock. On this morning it was half-past nine, and Mme. Vauquer\nstill lay abed. Christophe was late, Sylvie was late, but the two sat\ncomfortably taking their coffee as usual. It was Sylvie’s custom to\ntake the cream off the milk destined for the boarders’ breakfast for\nher own, and to boil the remainder for some time, so that madame\nshould not discover this illegal exaction.",
        "“Sylvie,” said Christophe, as he dipped a piece of toast into the\ncoffee, “M. Vautrin, who is not such a bad sort, all the same, had two\npeople come to see him again last night. If madame says anything, mind\nyou say nothing about it.”",
        "“Has he given you something?”",
        "“He gave me a five-franc piece this month, which is as good as saying,\n’Hold your tongue.’”",
        "“Except him and Mme. Couture, who doesn’t look twice at every penny,\nthere’s no one in the house that doesn’t try to get back with the left\nhand all that they give with the right at New Year,” said Sylvie.",
        "“And, after all,” said Christophe, “what do they give you? A miserable\nfive-franc piece. There is Father Goriot, who has cleaned his shoes\nhimself these two years past. There is that old beggar Poiret, who\ngoes without blacking altogether; he would sooner drink it than put it\non his boots. Then there is that whipper-snapper of a student, who\ngives me a couple of francs. Two francs will not pay for my brushes,\nand he sells his old clothes, and gets more for them than they are\nworth. Oh! they’re a shabby lot!”",
        "“Pooh!” said Sylvie, sipping her coffee, “our places are the best in\nthe Quarter, that I know. But about that great big chap Vautrin,\nChristophe; has any one told you anything about him?”",
        "“Yes. I met a gentleman in the street a few days ago; he said to me,\n’There’s a gentleman in your place, isn’t there? a tall man that dyes\nhis whiskers?’ I told him, ’No, sir; they aren’t dyed. A gay fellow\nlike him hasn’t the time to do it.’ And when I told M. Vautrin about\nit afterwards, he said, ’Quite right, my boy. That is the way to\nanswer them. There is nothing more unpleasant than to have your little\nweaknesses known; it might spoil many a match.’”",
        "“Well, and for my part,” said Sylvie, “a man tried to humbug me at the\nmarket wanting to know if I had seen him put on his shirt. Such bosh!\nThere,” she cried, interrupting herself, “that’s a quarter to ten\nstriking at the Val-de-Grace, and not a soul stirring!”",
        "“Pooh! they are all gone out. Mme. Couture and the girl went out at\neight o’clock to take the wafer at Saint-Etienne. Father Goriot\nstarted off somewhere with a parcel, and the student won’t be back\nfrom his lecture till ten o’clock. I saw them go while I was sweeping\nthe stairs; Father Goriot knocked up against me, and his parcel was as\nhard as iron. What is the old fellow up to, I wonder? He is as good as\na plaything for the rest of them; they can never let him alone; but he\nis a good man, all the same, and worth more than all of them put\ntogether. He doesn’t give you much himself, but he sometimes sends you\nwith a message to ladies who fork out famous tips; they are dressed\ngrandly, too.”",
        "“His daughters, as he calls them, eh? There are a dozen of them.”",
        "“I have never been to more than two–the two who came here.”",
        "“There is madame moving overhead; I shall have to go, or she will\nraise a fine racket. Just keep an eye on the milk, Christophe; don’t\nlet the cat get at it.”",
        "Sylvie went up to her mistress’ room.",
        "“Sylvie! How is this? It’s nearly ten o’clock, and you let me sleep\nlike a dormouse! Such a thing has never happened before.”",
        "“It’s the fog; it is that thick, you could cut it with a knife.”",
        "“But how about breakfast?”",
        "“Bah! the boarders are possessed, I’m sure. They all cleared out\nbefore there was a wink of daylight.”",
        "“Do speak properly, Sylvie,” Mme. Vauquer retorted; “say a blink of\ndaylight.”",
        "“Ah, well, madame, whichever you please. Anyhow, you can have\nbreakfast at ten o’clock. La Michonnette and Poiret have neither of\nthem stirred. There are only those two upstairs, and they are sleeping\nlike the logs they are.”",
        "“But, Sylvie, you put their names together as if––”",
        "“As if what?” said Sylvie, bursting into a guffaw. “The two of them\nmake a pair.”",
        "“It is a strange thing, isn’t it, Sylvie, how M. Vautrin got in last\nnight after Christophe had bolted the door?”",
        "“Not at all, madame. Christophe heard M. Vautrin, and went down and\nundid the door. And here are you imagining that––?”",
        "“Give me my bodice, and be quick and get breakfast ready. Dish up the\nrest of the mutton with the potatoes, and you can put the stewed pears\non the table, those at five a penny.”",
        "A few moments later Mme. Vauquer came down, just in time to see the\ncat knock down a plate that covered a bowl of milk, and begin to lap\nin all haste.",
        "“Mistigris!” she cried.",
        "The cat fled, but promptly returned to rub against her ankles.",
        "“Oh! yes, you can wheedle, you old hypocrite!” she said. “Sylvie!\nSylvie!”",
        "“Yes, madame; what is it?”",
        "“Just see what the cat has done!”",
        "“It is all that stupid Christophe’s fault. I told him to stop and lay\nthe table. What has become of him? Don’t you worry, madame; Father\nGoriot shall have it. I will fill it up with water, and he won’t know\nthe difference; he never notices anything, not even what he eats.”",
        "“I wonder where the old heathen can have gone?” said Mme. Vauquer,\nsetting the plates round the table.",
        "“Who knows? He is up to all sorts of tricks.”",
        "“I have overslept myself,” said Mme. Vauquer.",
        "“But madame looks as fresh as a rose, all the same.”",
        "The door bell rang at that moment, and Vautrin came through the\nsitting-room, singing loudly:",
        "  “’Tis the same old story everywhere,\n   A roving heart and a roving glance . .",
        "“Oh! Mamma Vauquer! good-morning!” he cried at the sight of his\nhostess, and he put his arm gaily round her waist.",
        "“There! have done––”",
        "“’Impertinence!’ Say it!” he answered. “Come, say it! Now, isn’t that\nwhat you really mean? Stop a bit, I will help you to set the table.\nAh! I am a nice man, am I not?",
        "  “For the locks of brown and the golden hair\n     A sighing lover . . .",
        "“Oh! I have just seen something so funny––",
        "                     . . . . led by chance.”",
        "“What?” asked the widow.",
        "“Father Goriot in the goldsmith’s shop in the Rue Dauphine at\nhalf-past eight this morning. They buy old spoons and forks and gold\nlace there, and Goriot sold a piece of silver plate for a good round\nsum. It had been twisted out of shape very neatly for a man that’s\nnot used to the trade.”",
        "“Really? You don’t say so?”",
        "“Yes. One of my friends is expatriating himself; I had been to see him\noff on board the Royal Mail steamer, and was coming back here. I\nwaited after that to see what Father Goriot would do; it is a comical\naffair. He came back to this quarter of the world, to the Rue des\nGres, and went into a money-lender’s house; everybody knows him,\nGobseck, a stuck-up rascal, that would make dominoes out of his\nfather’s bones, a Turk, a heathen, an old Jew, a Greek; it would be a\ndifficult matter to rob him, for he puts all his coin into the\nBank.”",
        "“Then what was Father Goriot doing there?”",
        "“Doing?” said Vautrin. “Nothing; he was bent on his own undoing. He is\na simpleton, stupid enough to ruin himself by running after––”",
        "“There he is!” cried Sylvie.",
        "“Christophe,” cried Father Goriot’s voice, “come upstairs with me.”",
        "Christophe went up, and shortly afterwards came down again.",
        "“Where are you going?” Mme. Vauquer asked of her servant.",
        "“Out on an errand for M. Goriot.”",
        "“What may that be?” said Vautrin, pouncing on a letter in Christophe’s\nhand. ’Mme. la Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud,” he read. “Where are\nyou going with it?” he added, as he gave the letter back to\nChristophe.",
        "“To the Rue du Helder. I have orders to give this into her hands\nmyself.”",
        "“What is there inside it?” said Vautrin, holding the letter up to the\nlight. “A banknote? No.” He peered into the envelope. “A receipted\naccount!” he cried. “My word! ’tis a gallant old dotard. Off with you,\nold chap,” he said, bringing down a hand on Christophe’s head, and\nspinning the man round like a thimble; “you will have a famous tip.”",
        "By this time the table was set. Sylvie was boiling the milk, Mme.\nVauquer was lighting a fire in the stove with some assistance from\nVautrin, who kept humming to himself:",
        "  “The same old story everywhere,\n   A roving heart and a roving glance.”",
        "When everything was ready, Mme. Couture and Mlle. Taillefer came in.",
        "“Where have you been this morning, fair lady?” said Mme. Vauquer,\nturning to Mme. Couture.",
        "“We have just been to say our prayers at Saint-Etienne du Mont. To-day\nis the day when we must go to see M. Taillefer. Poor little thing! She\nis trembling like a leaf,” Mme. Couture went on, as she seated herself\nbefore the fire and held the steaming soles of her boots to the blaze.",
        "“Warm yourself, Victorine,” said Mme. Vauquer.",
        "“It is quite right and proper, mademoiselle, to pray to Heaven to\nsoften your father’s heart,” said Vautrin, as he drew a chair nearer\nto the orphan girl; “but that is not enough. What you want is a friend\nwho will give the monster a piece of his mind; a barbarian that has\nthree millions (so they say), and will not give you a dowry; and a\npretty girl needs a dowry nowadays.”",
        "“Poor child!” said Mme. Vauquer. “Never mind, my pet, your wretch of a\nfather is going just the way to bring trouble upon himself.”",
        "Victorine’s eyes filled with tears at the words, and the widow checked\nherself at a sign from Mme. Couture.",
        "“If we could only see him!” said the Commissary-General’s widow; “if I\ncould speak to him myself and give him his wife’s last letter! I have\nnever dared to run the risk of sending it by post; he knew my\nhandwriting––”",
        "“’Oh woman, persecuted and injured innocent!’” exclaimed Vautrin,\nbreaking in upon her. “So that is how you are, is it? In a few days’\ntime I will look into your affairs, and it will be all right, you\nshall see.”",
        "“Oh! sir,” said Victorine, with a tearful but eager glance at Vautrin,\nwho showed no sign of being touched by it, “if you know of any way of\ncommunicating with my father, please be sure and tell him that his\naffection and my mother’s honor are more to me than all the money in\nthe world. If you can induce him to relent a little towards me, I will\npray to God for you. You may be sure of my gratitude––”",
        "“The same old story everywhere,” sang Vautrin, with a satirical\nintonation. At this juncture, Goriot, Mlle. Michonneau, and Poiret\ncame downstairs together; possibly the scent of the gravy which Sylvie\nwas making to serve with the mutton had announced breakfast. The seven\npeople thus assembled bade each other good-morning, and took their\nplaces at the table; the clock struck ten, and the student’s footstep\nwas heard outside.",
        "“Ah! here you are, M. Eugene,” said Sylvie; “every one is breakfasting\nat home to-day.”",
        "The student exchanged greetings with the lodgers, and sat down beside\nGoriot.",
        "“I have just met with a queer adventure,” he said, as he helped\nhimself abundantly to the mutton, and cut a slice of bread, which Mme.\nVauquer’s eyes gauged as usual.",
        "“An adventure?” queried Poiret.",
        "“Well, and what is there to astonish you in that, old boy?” Vautrin\nasked of Poiret. “M. Eugene is cut out for that kind of thing.”",
        "Mlle. Taillefer stole a timid glance at the young student.",
        "“Tell us about your adventure!” demanded M. Vautrin.",
        "“Yesterday evening I went to a ball given by a cousin of mine, the\nVicomtesse de Beauseant. She has a magnificent house; the rooms are\nhung with silk–in short, it was a splendid affair, and I was as happy\nas a king–-”",
        "“Fisher,” put in Vautrin, interrupting.",
        "“What do you mean, sir?” said Eugene sharply.",
        "“I said ’fisher,’ because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than\nkings.”",
        "“Quite true; I would much rather be the little careless bird than a\nking,” said Poiret the ditto-ist, “because––”",
        "“In fact\"–the law-student cut him short–\"I danced with one of the\nhandsomest women in the room, a charming countess, the most exquisite\ncreature I have ever seen. There was peach blossom in her hair, and\nshe had the loveliest bouquet of flowers–real flowers, that scented\nthe air––but there! it is no use trying to describe a woman glowing\nwith the dance. You ought to have seen her! Well, and this morning I\nmet this divine countess about nine o’clock, on foot in the Rue de\nGres. Oh! how my heart beat! I began to think––”",
        "“That she was coming here,” said Vautrin, with a keen look at the\nstudent. “I expect that she was going to call on old Gobseck, a\nmoney-lender. If ever you explore a Parisian woman’s heart, you will\nfind the money-lender first, and the lover afterwards. Your countess\nis called Anastasie de Restaud, and she lives in the Rue du Helder.”",
        "The student stared hard at Vautrin. Father Goriot raised his head at\nthe words, and gave the two speakers a glance so full of intelligence\nand uneasiness that the lodgers beheld him with astonishment.",
        "“Then Christophe was too late, and she must have gone to him!” cried\nGoriot, with anguish in his voice.",
        "“It is just as I guessed,” said Vautrin, leaning over to whisper in\nMme. Vauquer’s ear.",
        "Goriot went on with his breakfast, but seemed unconscious of what he\nwas doing. He had never looked more stupid nor more taken up with his\nown thoughts than he did at that moment.",
        "“Who the devil could have told you her name, M. Vautrin?” asked\nEugene.",
        "“Aha! there you are!” answered Vautrin. “Old Father Goriot there knew\nit quite well! and why should I not know it too?”",
        "“M. Goriot?” the student cried.",
        "“What is it?” asked the old man. “So she was very beautiful, was she,\nyesterday night?”",
        "“Who?”",
        "“Mme. de Restaud.”",
        "“Look at the old wretch,” said Mme. Vauquer, speaking to Vautrin; “how\nhis eyes light up!”",
        "“Then does he really keep her?” said Mlle. Michonneau, in a whisper to\nthe student.",
        "“Oh! yes, she was tremendously pretty,” Eugene answered. Father Goriot\nwatched him with eager eyes. “If Mme. de Beauseant had not been there,\nmy divine countess would have been the queen of the ball; none of the\nyounger men had eyes for any one else. I was the twelfth on her list,\nand she danced every quadrille. The other women were furious. She must\nhave enjoyed herself, if ever creature did! It is a true saying that\nthere is no more beautiful sight than a frigate in full sail, a\ngalloping horse, or a woman dancing.”",
        "“So the wheel turns,” said Vautrin; “yesterday night at a duchess’\nball, this morning in a money-lender’s office, on the lowest rung of\nthe ladder–just like a Parisienne! If their husbands cannot afford to\npay for their frantic extravagance, they will sell themselves. Or if\nthey cannot do that, they will tear out their mothers’ hearts to find\nsomething to pay for their splendor. They will turn the world upside\ndown. Just a Parisienne through and through!”",
        "Father Goriot’s face, which had shone at the student’s words like the\nsun on a bright day, clouded over all at once at this cruel speech of\nVautrin’s.",
        "“Well,” said Mme. Vauquer, “but where is your adventure? Did you speak\nto her? Did you ask her if she wanted to study law?”",
        "“She did not see me,” said Eugene. “But only think of meeting one of\nthe prettiest women in Paris in the Rue des Gres at nine o’clock! She\ncould not have reached home after the ball till two o’clock this\nmorning. Wasn’t it queer? There is no place like Paris for this sort\nof adventures.”",
        "“Pshaw! much funnier things than that happen here!” exclaimed\nVautrin.",
        "Mlle. Taillefer had scarcely heeded the talk, she was so absorbed by\nthe thought of the new attempt that she was about to make. Mme.\nCouture made a sign that it was time to go upstairs and dress; the two\nladies went out, and Father Goriot followed their example.",
        "“Well, did you see?” said Mme. Vauquer, addressing Vautrin and the\nrest of the circle. “He is ruining himself for those women, that is\nplain.”",
        "“Nothing will ever make me believe that that beautiful Comtesse de\nRestaud is anything to Father Goriot,” cried the student.",
        "“Well, and if you don’t,” broke in Vautrin, “we are not set on\nconvincing you. You are too young to know Paris thoroughly yet; later\non you will find out that there are what we call men with a\npassion––”",
        "Mlle. Michonneau gave Vautrin a quick glance at these words. They\nseemed to be like the sound of a trumpet to a trooper’s horse. “Aha!\"\nsaid Vautrin, stopping in his speech to give her a searching glance,\n\"so we have had our little experiences, have we?”",
        "The old maid lowered her eyes like a nun who sees a statue.",
        "“Well,” he went on, “when folk of that kind get a notion into their\nheads, they cannot drop it. They must drink the water from some\nparticular spring–it is stagnant as often as not; but they will sell\ntheir wives and families, they will sell their own souls to the devil\nto get it. For some this spring is play, or the stock-exchange, or\nmusic, or a collection of pictures or insects; for others it is some\nwoman who can give them the dainties they like. You might offer these\nlast all the women on earth–they would turn up their noses; they will\nhave the only one who can gratify their passion. It often happens that\nthe woman does not care for them at all, and treats them cruelly; they\nbuy their morsels of satisfaction very dear; but no matter, the fools\nare never tired of it; they will take their last blanket to the\npawnbroker’s to give their last five-franc piece to her. Father Goriot\nhere is one of that sort. He is discreet, so the Countess exploits\nhim–just the way of the gay world. The poor old fellow thinks of her\nand of nothing else. In all other respects you see he is a stupid\nanimal; but get him on that subject, and his eyes sparkle like\ndiamonds. That secret is not difficult to guess. He took some plate\nhimself this morning to the melting-pot, and I saw him at Daddy\nGobseck’s in the Rue des Gres. And now, mark what follows–he came\nback here, and gave a letter for the Comtesse de Restaud to that\nnoodle of a Christophe, who showed us the address; there was a\nreceipted bill inside it. It is clear that it was an urgent matter if\nthe Countess also went herself to the old money lender. Father Goriot\nhas financed her handsomely. There is no need to tack a tale together;\nthe thing is self-evident. So that shows you, sir student, that all\nthe time your Countess was smiling, dancing, flirting, swaying her\npeach-flower crowned head, with her gown gathered into her hand, her\nslippers were pinching her, as they say; she was thinking of her\nprotested bills, or her lover’s protested bills.”",
        "“You have made me wild to know the truth,” cried Eugene; “I will go to\ncall on Mme. de Restaud to-morrow.”",
        "“Yes,” echoed Poiret; “you must go and call on Mme. de Restaud.”",
        "“And perhaps you will find Father Goriot there, who will take payment\nfor the assistance he politely rendered.”",
        "Eugene looked disgusted. “Why, then, this Paris of yours is a slough.”",
        "“And an uncommonly queer slough, too,” replied Vautrin. “The mud\nsplashes you as you drive through it in your carriage–you are a\nrespectable person; you go afoot and are splashed–you are a\nscoundrel. You are so unlucky as to walk off with something or other\nbelonging to somebody else, and they exhibit you as a curiosity in the\nPlace du Palais-de-Justice; you steal a million, and you are pointed\nout in every salon as a model of virtue. And you pay thirty millions\nfor the police and the courts of justice, for the maintenance of law\nand order! A pretty slate of things it is!”",
        "“What,” cried Mme. Vauquer, “has Father Goriot really melted down his\nsilver posset-dish?”",
        "“There were two turtle-doves on the lid, were there not?” asked\nEugene.",
        "“Yes, that there were.”",
        "“Then, was he fond of it?” said Eugene. “He cried while he was\nbreaking up the cup and plate. I happened to see him by accident.”",
        "“It was dear to him as his own life,” answered the widow.",
        "“There! you see how infatuated the old fellow is!” cried Vautrin. “The\nwoman yonder can coax the soul out of him.”",
        "The student went up to his room. Vautrin went out, and a few moments\nlater Mme. Couture and Victorine drove away in a cab which Sylvie had\ncalled for them. Poiret gave his arm to Mlle. Michonneau, and they\nwent together to spend the two sunniest hours of the day in the Jardin\ndes Plantes.",
        "“Well, those two are as good as married,” was the portly Sylvie’s\ncomment. “They are going out together to-day for the first time. They\nare such a couple of dry sticks that if they happen to strike against\neach other they will draw sparks like flint and steel.”",
        "“Keep clear of Mlle. Michonneau’s shawl, then,” said Mme. Vauquer,\nlaughing; “it would flare up like tinder.”",
        "At four o’clock that evening, when Goriot came in, he saw, by the\nlight of two smoky lamps, that Victorine’s eyes were red. Mme. Vauquer\nwas listening to the history of the visit made that morning to M.\nTaillefer; it had been made in vain. Taillefer was tired of the annual\napplication made by his daughter and her elderly friend; he gave them\na personal interview in order to arrive at an understanding with them.",
        "“My dear lady,” said Mme. Couture, addressing Mme. Vauquer, “just\nimagine it; he did not even ask Victorine to sit down, she was\nstanding the whole time. He said to me quite coolly, without putting\nhimself in a passion, that we might spare ourselves the trouble of\ngoing there; that the young lady (he would not call her his daughter)\nwas injuring her cause by importuning him (importuning! once a year,\nthe wretch!); that as Victorine’s mother had nothing when he married\nher, Victorine ought not to expect anything from him; in fact, he said\nthe most cruel things, that made the poor child burst out crying. The\nlittle thing threw herself at her father’s feet and spoke up bravely;\nshe said that she only persevered in her visits for her mother’s sake;\nthat she would obey him without a murmur, but that she begged him to\nread her poor dead mother’s farewell letter. She took it up and gave\nit to him, saying the most beautiful things in the world, most\nbeautifully expressed; I do not know where she learned them; God must\nhave put them into her head, for the poor child was inspired to speak\nso nicely that it made me cry like a fool to hear her talk. And what\ndo you think the monster was doing all the time? Cutting his nails! He\ntook the letter that poor Mme. Taillefer had soaked with tears, and\nflung it on to the chimney-piece. ’That is all right,’ he said. He\nheld out his hands to raise his daughter, but she covered them with\nkisses, and he drew them away again. Scandalous, isn’t it? And his\ngreat booby of a son came in and took no notice of his sister.”",
        "“What inhuman wretches they must be!” said Father Goriot.",
        "“And then they both went out of the room,” Mme. Couture went on,\nwithout heeding the worthy vermicelli maker’s exclamation; “father and\nson bowed to me, and asked me to excuse them on account of urgent\nbusiness! That is the history of our call. Well, he has seen his\ndaughter at any rate. How he can refuse to acknowledge her I cannot\nthink, for they are as alike as two peas.”",
        "The boarders dropped in one after another, interchanging greetings and\nempty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and\nwitty. Dulness is their prevailing ingredient, and the whole point\nconsists in mispronouncing a word or a gesture. This kind of argot is\nalways changing. The essence of the jest consists in some catchword\nsuggested by a political event, an incident in the police courts, a\nstreet song, or a bit of burlesque at some theatre, and forgotten in a\nmonth. Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore\nand shuttlecock with words and ideas. The diorama, a recent invention,\nwhich carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas, had\ngiven rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with\nrama. The Maison Vauquer had caught the infection from a young artist\namong the boarders.",
        "“Well, Monsieur-r-r Poiret,” said the employe from the Museum, “how\nis your health-orama?” Then, without waiting for an answer, he turned\nto Mme. Couture and Victorine with a “Ladies, you seem melancholy.”",
        "“Is dinner ready?” cried Horace Bianchon, a medical student, and a\nfriend of Rastignac’s; “my stomach is sinking usque ad talones.”",
        "“There is an uncommon frozerama outside,” said Vautrin. “Make room\nthere, Father Goriot! Confound it, your foot covers the whole front of\nthe stove.”",
        "“Illustrious M. Vautrin,” put in Bianchon, “why do you say\nfrozerama? It is incorrect; it should be frozenrama.”",
        "“No, it shouldn’t,” said the official from the Museum; ’frozerama is\nright by the same rule that you say ’My feet are froze.’”",
        "“Ah! ah!”",
        "“Here is his Excellency the Marquis de Rastignac, Doctor of the Law of\nContraries,” cried Bianchon, seizing Eugene by the throat, and almost\nthrottling him.",
        "“Hallo there! hallo!”",
        "Mlle. Michonneau came noiselessly in, bowed to the rest of the party,\nand took her place beside the three women without saying a word.",
        "“That old bat always makes me shudder,” said Bianchon in a low voice,\nindicating Mlle. Michonneau to Vautrin. “I have studied Gall’s system,\nand I am sure she has the bump of Judas.”",
        "“Then you have seen a case before?” said Vautrin.",
        "“Who has not?” answered Bianchon. “Upon my word, that ghastly old maid\nlooks just like one of the long worms that will gnaw a beam through,\ngive them time enough.”",
        "“That is the way, young man,” returned he of the forty years and the\ndyed whiskers:",
        "  “The rose has lived the life of a rose–\n   A morning’s space.”",
        "“Aha! here is a magnificent soupe-au-rama,” cried Poiret as\nChristophe came in bearing the soup with cautious heed.",
        "“I beg your pardon, sir,” said Mme. Vauquer; “it is soupe aux\nchoux.”",
        "All the young men roared with laughter.",
        "“Had you there, Poiret!”",
        "“Poir-r-r-rette! she had you there!”",
        "“Score two points to Mamma Vauquer,” said Vautrin.",
        "“Did any of you notice the fog this morning?” asked the official.",
        "“It was a frantic fog,” said Bianchon, “a fog unparalleled, doleful,\nmelancholy, sea-green, asthmatical–a Goriot of a fog!”",
        "“A Goriorama,” said the art student, “because you couldn’t see a thing\nin it.”",
        "“Hey! Milord Gaoriotte, they air talking about yoo-o-ou!”",
        "Father Goriot, seated at the lower end of the table, close to the door\nthrough which the servant entered, raised his face; he had smelt at a\nscrap of bread that lay under his table napkin, an old trick acquired\nin his commercial capacity, that still showed itself at times.",
        "“Well,” Madame Vauquer cried in sharp tones, that rang above the\nrattle of spoons and plates and the sound of other voices, “and is\nthere anything the matter with the bread?”",
        "“Nothing whatever, madame,” he answered; “on the contrary, it is made\nof the best quality of corn; flour from Etampes.”",
        "“How could you tell?” asked Eugene.",
        "“By the color, by the flavor.”",
        "“You knew the flavor by the smell, I suppose,” said Mme. Vauquer. “You\nhave grown so economical, you will find out how to live on the smell\nof cooking at last.”",
        "“Take out a patent for it, then,” cried the Museum official; “you\nwould make a handsome fortune.”",
        "“Never mind him,” said the artist; “he does that sort of thing to\ndelude us into thinking that he was a vermicelli maker.”",
        "“Your nose is a corn-sampler, it appears?” inquired the official.",
        "“Corn what?” asked Bianchon.",
        "“Corn-el.”",
        "“Corn-et.”",
        "“Corn-elian.”",
        "“Corn-ice.”",
        "“Corn-ucopia.”",
        "“Corn-crake.”",
        "“Corn-cockle.”",
        "“Corn-orama.”",
        "The eight responses came like a rolling fire from every part of the\nroom, and the laughter that followed was the more uproarious because\npoor Father Goriot stared at the others with a puzzled look, like a\nforeigner trying to catch the meaning of words in a language which he\ndoes not understand.",
        "“Corn? . . .” he said, turning to Vautrin, his next neighbor.",
        "“Corn on your foot, old man!” said Vautrin, and he drove Father\nGoriot’s cap down over his eyes by a blow on the crown.",
        "The poor old man thus suddenly attacked was for a moment too\nbewildered to do anything. Christophe carried off his plate, thinking\nthat he had finished his soup, so that when Goriot had pushed back his\ncap from his eyes his spoon encountered the table. Every one burst out\nlaughing. “You are a disagreeable joker, sir,” said the old man, “and\nif you take any further liberties with me––”",
        "“Well, what then, old boy?” Vautrin interrupted.",
        "“Well, then, you shall pay dearly for it some day––”",
        "“Down below, eh?” said the artist, “in the little dark corner where\nthey put naughty boys.”",
        "“Well, mademoiselle,” Vautrin said, turning to Victorine, “you are\neating nothing. So papa was refractory, was he?”",
        "“A monster!” said Mme. Couture.",
        "“Mademoiselle might make application for aliment pending her suit; she\nis not eating anything. Eh! eh! just see how Father Goriot is staring\nat Mlle. Victorine.”",
        "The old man had forgotten his dinner, he was so absorbed in gazing at\nthe poor girl; the sorrow in her face was unmistakable,–the slighted\nlove of a child whose father would not recognize her.",
        "“We are mistaken about Father Goriot, my dear boy,” said Eugene in a\nlow voice. “He is not an idiot, nor wanting in energy. Try your Gall\nsystem on him, and let me know what you think. I saw him crush a\nsilver dish last night as if it had been made of wax; there seems to\nbe something extraordinary going on in his mind just now, to judge by\nhis face. His life is so mysterious that it must be worth studying.\nOh! you may laugh, Bianchon; I am not joking.”",
        "“The man is a subject, is he?” said Bianchon; “all right! I will\ndissect him, if he will give me the chance.”",
        "“No; feel his bumps.”",
        "“Hm!–his stupidity might perhaps be contagious.”",
        "The next day Rastignac dressed himself very elegantly, and about three\no’clock in the afternoon went to call on Mme. de Restaud. On the way\nthither he indulged in the wild intoxicating dreams which fill a young\nhead so full of delicious excitement. Young men at his age take no\naccount of obstacles nor of dangers; they see success in every\ndirection; imagination has free play, and turns their lives into a\nromance; they are saddened or discouraged by the collapse of one of\nthe visionary schemes that have no existence save in their heated\nfancy. If youth were not ignorant and timid, civilization would be\nimpossible.",
        "Eugene took unheard-of pains to keep himself in a spotless condition,\nbut on his way through the streets he began to think about Mme. de\nRestaud and what he should say to her. He equipped himself with wit,\nrehearsed repartees in the course of an imaginary conversation, and\nprepared certain neat speeches a la Talleyrand, conjuring up a series\nof small events which should prepare the way for the declaration on\nwhich he had based his future; and during these musings the law\nstudent was bespattered with mud, and by the time he reached the\nPalais Royal he was obliged to have his boots blacked and his trousers\nbrushed.",
        "“If I were rich,” he said, as he changed the five-franc piece he had\nbrought with him in case anything might happen, “I would take a cab,\nthen I could think at my ease.”",
        "At last he reached the Rue du Helder, and asked for the Comtesse de\nRestaud. He bore the contemptuous glances of the servants, who had\nseen him cross the court on foot, with the cold fury of a man who\nknows that he will succeed some day. He understood the meaning of\ntheir glances at once, for he had felt his inferiority as soon as he\nentered the court, where a smart cab was waiting. All the delights of\nlife in Paris seemed to be implied by this visible and manifest sign\nof luxury and extravagance. A fine horse, in magnificent harness, was\npawing the ground, and all at once the law student felt out of humor\nwith himself. Every compartment in his brain which he had thought to\nfind so full of wit was bolted fast; he grew positively stupid. He\nsent up his name to the Countess, and waited in the ante-chamber,\nstanding on one foot before a window that looked out upon the court;\nmechanically he leaned his elbow against the sash, and stared before\nhim. The time seemed long; he would have left the house but for the\nsouthern tenacity of purpose which works miracles when it is\nsingle-minded.",
        "“Madame is in her boudoir, and cannot see any one at present, sir,\"\nsaid the servant. “She gave me no answer; but if you will go into the\ndining-room, there is some one already there.”",
        "Rastignac was impressed with a sense of the formidable power of the\nlackey who can accuse or condemn his masters by a word; he coolly\nopened the door by which the man had just entered the ante-chamber,\nmeaning, no doubt, to show these insolent flunkeys that he was\nfamiliar with the house; but he found that he had thoughtlessly\nprecipitated himself into a small room full of dressers, where lamps\nwere standing, and hot-water pipes, on which towels were being dried;\na dark passage and a back staircase lay beyond it. Stifled laughter\nfrom the ante-chamber added to his confusion.",
        "“This way to the drawing-room, sir,” said the servant, with the\nexaggerated respect which seemed to be one more jest at his expense.",
        "Eugene turned so quickly that he stumbled against a bath. By good\nluck, he managed to keep his hat on his head, and saved it from\nimmersion in the water; but just as he turned, a door opened at the\nfurther end of the dark passage, dimly lighted by a small lamp.\nRastignac heard voices and the sound of a kiss; one of the speakers\nwas Mme. de Restaud, the other was Father Goriot. Eugene followed the\nservant through the dining-room into the drawing-room; he went to a\nwindow that looked out into the courtyard, and stood there for a\nwhile. He meant to know whether this Goriot was really the Goriot that\nhe knew. His heart beat unwontedly fast; he remembered Vautrin’s\nhideous insinuations. A well-dressed young man suddenly emerged from\nthe room almost as Eugene entered it, saying impatiently to the\nservant who stood at the door: “I am going, Maurice. Tell Madame la\nComtesse that I waited more than half an hour for her.”",
        "Whereupon this insolent being, who, doubtless, had a right to be\ninsolent, sang an Italian trill, and went towards the window where\nEugene was standing, moved thereto quite as much by a desire to see\nthe student’s face as by a wish to look out into the courtyard.",
        "“But M. le Comte had better wait a moment longer; madame is\ndisengaged,” said Maurice, as he returned to the ante-chamber.",
        "Just at that moment Father Goriot appeared close to the gate; he had\nemerged from a door at the foot of the back staircase. The worthy soul\nwas preparing to open his umbrella regardless of the fact that the\ngreat gate had opened to admit a tilbury, in which a young man with a\nribbon at his button-hole was seated. Father Goriot had scarcely time\nto start back and save himself. The horse took fright at the umbrella,\nswerved, and dashed forward towards the flight of steps. The young man\nlooked round in annoyance, saw Father Goriot, and greeted him as he\nwent out with constrained courtesy, such as people usually show to a\nmoney-lender so long as they require his services, or the sort of\nrespect they feel it necessary to show for some one whose reputation\nhas been blown upon, so that they blush to acknowledge his\nacquaintance. Father Goriot gave him a little friendly nod and a\ngood-natured smile. All this happened with lightning speed. Eugene\nwas so deeply interested that he forgot that he was not alone till\nhe suddenly heard the Countess’ voice.",
        "“Oh! Maxime, were you going away?” she said reproachfully, with a\nshade of pique in her manner. The Countess had not seen the incident\nnor the entrance of the tilbury. Rastignac turned abruptly and saw her\nstanding before him, coquettishly dressed in a loose white cashmere\ngown with knots of rose-colored ribbon here and there; her hair was\ncarelessly coiled about her head, as is the wont of Parisian women in\nthe morning; there was a soft fragrance about her–doubtless she was\nfresh from a bath;–her graceful form seemed more flexible, her beauty\nmore luxuriant. Her eyes glistened. A young man can see everything at\na glance; he feels the radiant influence of woman as a plant discerns\nand absorbs its nutriment from the air; he did not need to touch her\nhands to feel their cool freshness. He saw faint rose tints through\nthe cashmere of the dressing gown; it had fallen slightly open, giving\nglimpses of a bare throat, on which the student’s eyes rested. The\nCountess had no need of the adventitious aid of corsets; her girdle\ndefined the outlines of her slender waist; her throat was a challenge\nto love; her feet, thrust into slippers, were daintily small. As\nMaxime took her hand and kissed it, Eugene became aware of Maxime’s\nexistence, and the Countess saw Eugene.",
        "“Oh! is that you M. de Rastignac? I am very glad to see you,” she\nsaid, but there was something in her manner that a shrewd observer\nwould have taken as a hint to depart.",
        "Maxime, as the Countess Anastasie had called the young man with the\nhaughty insolence of bearing, looked from Eugene to the lady, and from\nthe lady to Eugene; it was sufficiently evident that he wished to be\nrid of the latter. An exact and faithful rendering of the glance might\nbe given in the words: “Look here, my dear; I hope you intend to send\nthis little whipper-snapper about his business.”",
        "The Countess consulted the young man’s face with an intent\nsubmissiveness that betrays all the secrets of a woman’s heart, and\nRastignac all at once began to hate him violently. To begin with, the\nsight of the fair carefully arranged curls on the other’s comely head\nhad convinced him that his own crop was hideous; Maxime’s boots,\nmoreover, were elegant and spotless, while his own, in spite of all\nhis care, bore some traces of his recent walk; and, finally, Maxime’s\novercoat fitted the outline of his figure gracefully, he looked like a\npretty woman, while Eugene was wearing a black coat at half-past two.\nThe quick-witted child of the Charente felt the disadvantage at which\nhe was placed beside this tall, slender dandy, with the clear gaze and\nthe pale face, one of those men who would ruin orphan children without\nscruple. Mme. de Restaud fled into the next room without waiting for\nEugene to speak; shaking out the skirts of her dressing-gown in her\nflight, so that she looked like a white butterfly, and Maxime hurried\nafter her. Eugene, in a fury, followed Maxime and the Countess, and\nthe three stood once more face to face by the hearth in the large\ndrawing-room. The law student felt quite sure that the odious Maxime\nfound him in the way, and even at the risk of displeasing Mme. de\nRestaud, he meant to annoy the dandy. It had struck him all at once\nthat he had seen the young man before at Mme. de Beauseant’s ball; he\nguessed the relation between Maxime and Mme. de Restaud; and with the\nyouthful audacity that commits prodigious blunders or achieves signal\nsuccess, he said to himself, “This is my rival; I mean to cut him\nout.”",
        "Rash resolve! He did not know that M. le Comte Maxime de Trailles\nwould wait till he was insulted, so as to fire first and kill his man.\nEugene was a sportsman and a good shot, but he had not yet hit the\nbulls’s eye twenty times out of twenty-two. The young Count dropped\ninto a low chair by the hearth, took up the tongs, and made up the\nfire so violently and so sulkily, that Anastasie’s fair face suddenly\nclouded over. She turned to Eugene, with a cool, questioning glance\nthat asked plainly, “Why do you not go?” a glance which well-bred\npeople regard as a cue to make their exit.",
        "Eugene assumed an amiable expression.",
        "“Madame,” he began, “I hastened to call upon you––”",
        "He stopped short. The door opened, and the owner of the tilbury\nsuddenly appeared. He had left his hat outside, and did not greet the\nCountess; he looked meditatively at Rastignac, and held out his hand\nto Maxime with a cordial “Good morning,” that astonished Eugene not a\nlittle. The young provincial did not understand the amenities of a\ntriple alliance.",
        "“M. de Restaud,” said the Countess, introducing her husband to the law\nstudent.",
        "Eugene bowed profoundly.",
        "“This gentleman,” she continued, presenting Eugene to her husband, “is\nM. de Rastignac; he is related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant\nthrough the Marcillacs; I had the pleasure of meeting him at her last\nball.”",
        "Related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs!These words, on which the countess threw ever so slight an emphasis,\nby reason of the pride that the mistress of a house takes in showing\nthat she only receives people of distinction as visitors in her house,\nproduced a magical effect. The Count’s stiff manner relaxed at once as\nhe returned the student’s bow.",
        "“Delighted to have an opportunity of making your acquaintance,” he\nsaid.",
        "Maxime de Trailles himself gave Eugene an uneasy glance, and suddenly\ndropped his insolent manner. The mighty name had all the power of a\nfairy’s wand; those closed compartments in the southern brain flew\nopen again; Rastignac’s carefully drilled faculties returned. It was\nas if a sudden light had pierced the obscurity of this upper world of\nParis, and he began to see, though everything was indistinct as yet.\nMme. Vauquer’s lodging-house and Father Goriot were very far remote\nfrom his thoughts.",
        "“I thought that the Marcillacs were extinct,” the Comte de Restaud\nsaid, addressing Eugene.",
        "“Yes, they are extinct,” answered the law student. “My great-uncle,\nthe Chevalier de Rastignac, married the heiress of the Marcillac\nfamily. They had only one daughter, who married the Marechal de\nClarimbault, Mme. de Beauseant’s grandfather on the mother’s side. We\nare the younger branch of the family, and the younger branch is all\nthe poorer because my great-uncle, the Vice-Admiral, lost all that he\nhad in the King’s service. The Government during the Revolution\nrefused to admit our claims when the Compagnie des Indes was\nliquidated.”",
        "“Was not your great-uncle in command of the Vengeur before 1789?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Then he would be acquainted with my grandfather, who commanded the\nWarwick.”",
        "Maxime looked at Mme. de Restaud and shrugged his shoulders, as who\nshould say, “If he is going to discuss nautical matters with that\nfellow, it is all over with us.” Anastasie understood the glance that\nM. de Trailles gave her. With a woman’s admirable tact, she began to\nsmile and said:",
        "“Come with me, Maxime; I have something to say to you. We will leave\nyou two gentlemen to sail in company on board the Warwick and the\nVengeur.”",
        "She rose to her feet and signed to Maxime to follow her, mirth and\nmischief in her whole attitude, and the two went in the direction of\nthe boudoir. The morganatic couple (to use a convenient German\nexpression which has no exact equivalent) had reached the door, when\nthe Count interrupted himself in his talk with Eugene.",
        "“Anastasie!” he cried pettishly, “just stay a moment, dear; you know\nvery well that––”",
        "“I am coming back in a minute,” she interrupted; “I have a commission\nfor Maxime to execute, and I want to tell him about it.”",
        "She came back almost immediately. She had noticed the inflection in\nher husband’s voice, and knew that it would not be safe to retire to\nthe boudoir; like all women who are compelled to study their husbands’\ncharacters in order to have their own way, and whose business it is to\nknow exactly how far they can go without endangering a good\nunderstanding, she was very careful to avoid petty collisions in\ndomestic life. It was Eugene who had brought about this untoward\nincident; so the Countess looked at Maxime and indicated the law\nstudent with an air of exasperation. M. de Trailles addressed the\nCount, the Countess, and Eugene with the pointed remark, “You are\nbusy, I do not want to interrupt you; good-day,” and he went.",
        "“Just wait a moment, Maxime!” the Count called after him.",
        "“Come and dine with us,” said the Countess, leaving Eugene and her\nhusband together once more. She followed Maxime into the little\ndrawing-room, where they sat together sufficiently long to feel sure\nthat Rastignac had taken his leave.",
        "The law student heard their laughter, and their voices, and the pauses\nin their talk; he grew malicious, exerted his conversational powers\nfor M. de Restaud, flattered him, and drew him into discussions, to\nthe end that he might see the Countess again and discover the nature\nof her relations with Father Goriot. This Countess with a husband and\na lover, for Maxime clearly was her lover, was a mystery. What was the\nsecret tie that bound her to the old tradesman? This mystery he meant\nto penetrate, hoping by its means to gain a sovereign ascendency over\nthis fair typical Parisian.",
        "“Anastasie!” the Count called again to his wife.",
        "“Poor Maxime!” she said, addressing the young man. “Come, we must\nresign ourselves. This evening––”",
        "“I hope, Nasie,” he said in her ear, “that you will give orders not to\nadmit that youngster, whose eyes light up like live coals when he\nlooks at you. He will make you a declaration, and compromise you, and\nthen you will compel me to kill him.”",
        "“Are you mad, Maxime?” she said. “A young lad of a student is, on the\ncontrary, a capital lightning-conductor; is not that so? Of course, I\nmean to make Restaud furiously jealous of him.”",
        "Maxime burst out laughing, and went out, followed by the Countess, who\nstood at the window to watch him into his carriage; he shook his whip,\nand made his horse prance. She only returned when the great gate had\nbeen closed after him.",
        "“What do you think, dear?” cried the Count, her husband, “this\ngentleman’s family estate is not far from Verteuil, on the Charente;\nhis great-uncle and my grandfather were acquainted.”",
        "“Delighted to find that we have acquaintances in common,” said the\nCountess, with a preoccupied manner.",
        "“More than you think,” said Eugene, in a low voice.",
        "“What do you mean?” she asked quickly.",
        "“Why, only just now,” said the student, “I saw a gentleman go out at\nthe gate, Father Goriot, my next door neighbor in the house where I am\nlodging.”",
        "At the sound of this name, and the prefix that embellished it, the\nCount, who was stirring the fire, let the tongs fall as though they\nhad burned his fingers, and rose to his feet.",
        "“Sir,” he cried, “you might have called him ’Monsieur Goriot’!”",
        "The Countess turned pale at first at the sight of her husband’s\nvexation, then she reddened; clearly she was embarrassed, her answer\nwas made in a tone that she tried to make natural, and with an air of\nassumed carelessness:",
        "“You could not know any one who is dearer to us both . . .”",
        "She broke off, glanced at the piano as if some fancy had crossed her\nmind, and asked, “Are you fond of music, M. de Rastignac?”",
        "“Exceedingly,” answered Eugene, flushing, and disconcerted by a dim\nsuspicion that he had somehow been guilty of a clumsy piece of folly.",
        "“Do you sing?” she cried, going to the piano, and, sitting down\nbefore it, she swept her fingers over the keyboard from end to end.\nR-r-r-rah!",
        "“No, madame.”",
        "The Comte de Restaud walked to and fro.",
        "“That is a pity; you are without one great means of success.\n–Ca-ro, ca-a-ro, ca-a-a-ro, non du-bi-ta-re,” sang the Countess.",
        "Eugene had a second time waved a magic wand when he uttered Goriot’s\nname, but the effect seemed to be entirely opposite to that produced\nby the formula “related to Mme. de Beauseant.” His position was not\nunlike that of some visitor permitted as a favor to inspect a private\ncollection of curiosities, when by inadvertence he comes into\ncollision with a glass case full of sculptured figures, and three or\nfour heads, imperfectly secured, fall at the shock. He wished the\nearth would open and swallow him. Mme. de Restaud’s expression was\nreserved and chilly, her eyes had grown indifferent, and sedulously\navoided meeting those of the unlucky student of law.",
        "“Madame,” he said, “you wish to talk with M. de Restaud; permit me to\nwish you good-day––”",
        "The Countess interrupted him by a gesture, saying hastily, “Whenever\nyou come to see us, both M. de Restaud and I shall be delighted to see\nyou.”",
        "Eugene made a profound bow and took his leave, followed by M. de\nRestaud, who insisted, in spite of his remonstrances, on accompanying\nhim into the hall.",
        "“Neither your mistress nor I are at home to that gentleman when he\ncalls,” the Count said to Maurice.",
        "As Eugene set foot on the steps, he saw that it was raining.",
        "“Come,” said he to himself, “somehow I have just made a mess of it, I\ndo not know how. And now I am going to spoil my hat and coat into the\nbargain. I ought to stop in my corner, grind away at law, and never\nlook to be anything but a boorish country magistrate. How can I go\ninto society, when to manage properly you want a lot of cabs,\nvarnished boots, gold watch chains, and all sorts of things; you have\nto wear white doeskin gloves that cost six francs in the morning, and\nprimrose kid gloves every evening? A fig for that old humbug of a\nGoriot!”",
        "When he reached the street door, the driver of a hackney coach, who\nhad probably just deposited a wedding party at their door, and asked\nnothing better than a chance of making a little money for himself\nwithout his employer’s knowledge, saw that Eugene had no umbrella,\nremarked his black coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, and varnished\nboots, and stopped and looked at him inquiringly. Eugene, in the blind\ndesperation that drives a young man to plunge deeper and deeper into\nan abyss, as if he might hope to find a fortunate issue in its lowest\ndepths, nodded in reply to the driver’s signal, and stepped into the\ncab; a few stray petals of orange blossom and scraps of wire bore\nwitness to its recent occupation by a wedding party.",
        "“Where am I to drive, sir?” demanded the man, who, by this time, had\ntaken off his white gloves.",
        "“Confound it!” Eugene said to himself, “I am in for it now, and at\nleast I will not spend cab-hire for nothing!–Drive to the Hotel\nBeauseant,” he said aloud.",
        "“Which?” asked the man, a portentous word that reduced Eugene to\nconfusion. This young man of fashion, species incerta, did not know\nthat there were two Hotels Beauseant; he was not aware how rich he was\nin relations who did not care about him.",
        "“The Vicomte de Beauseant, Rue––”",
        "“De Grenelle,” interrupted the driver, with a jerk of his head. “You\nsee, there are the hotels of the Marquis and Comte de Beauseant in the\nRue Saint-Dominique,” he added, drawing up the step.",
        "“I know all about that,” said Eugene, severely.–\"Everybody is\nlaughing at me to-day, it seems!” he said to himself, as he deposited\nhis hat on the opposite seat. “This escapade will cost me a king’s\nransom, but, at any rate, I shall call on my so-called cousin in a\nthoroughly aristocratic fashion. Goriot has cost me ten francs\nalready, the old scoundrel. My word! I will tell Mme. de Beauseant\nabout my adventure; perhaps it may amuse her. Doubtless she will know\nthe secret of the criminal relation between that handsome woman and\nthe old rat without a tail. It would be better to find favor in my\ncousin’s eyes than to come in contact with that shameless woman, who\nseems to me to have very expensive tastes. Surely the beautiful\nVicomtesse’s personal interest would turn the scale for me, when the\nmere mention of her name produces such an effect. Let us look higher.\nIf you set yourself to carry the heights of heaven, you must face\nGod.”",
        "The innumerable thoughts that surged through his brain might be summed\nup in these phrases. He grew calmer, and recovered something of his\nassurance as he watched the falling rain. He told himself that though\nhe was about to squander two of the precious five-franc pieces that\nremained to him, the money was well laid out in preserving his coat,\nboots, and hat; and his cabman’s cry of “Gate, if you please,” almost\nput him in spirits. A Swiss, in scarlet and gold, appeared, the great\ndoor groaned on its hinges, and Rastignac, with sweet satisfaction,\nbeheld his equipage pass under the archway and stop before the flight\nof steps beneath the awning. The driver, in a blue-and-red greatcoat,\ndismounted and let down the step. As Eugene stepped out of the cab, he\nheard smothered laughter from the peristyle. Three or four lackeys\nwere making merry over the festal appearance of the vehicle. In\nanother moment the law student was enlightened as to the cause of\ntheir hilarity; he felt the full force of the contrast between his\nequipage and one of the smartest broughams in Paris; a coachman, with\npowdered hair, seemed to find it difficult to hold a pair of spirited\nhorses, who stood chafing the bit. In Mme. de Restaud’s courtyard, in\nthe Chaussee d’Antin, he had seen the neat turnout of a young man of\nsix-and-twenty; in the Faubourg Saint-Germain he found the luxurious\nequipage of a man of rank; thirty thousand francs would not have\npurchased it.",
        "“Who can be here?” said Eugene to himself. He began to understand,\nthough somewhat tardily, that he must not expect to find many women in\nParis who were not already appropriated, and that the capture of one\nof these queens would be likely to cost something more than bloodshed.\n\"Confound it all! I expect my cousin also has her Maxime.”",
        "He went up the steps, feeling that he was a blighted being. The glass\ndoor was opened for him; the servants were as solemn as jackasses\nunder the curry comb. So far, Eugene had only been in the ballroom on\nthe ground floor of the Hotel Beauseant; the fete had followed so\nclosely on the invitation, that he had not had time to call on his\ncousin, and had therefore never seen Mme. de Beauseant’s apartments;\nhe was about to behold for the first time a great lady among the\nwonderful and elegant surroundings that reveal her character and\nreflect her daily life. He was the more curious, because Mme. de\nRestaud’s drawing-room had provided him with a standard of comparison.",
        "At half-past four the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was visible. Five\nminutes earlier she would not have received her cousin, but Eugene\nknew nothing of the recognized routine of various houses in Paris. He\nwas conducted up the wide, white-painted, crimson-carpeted staircase,\nbetween the gilded balusters and masses of flowering plants, to Mme.\nde Beauseant’s apartments. He did not know the rumor current about\nMme. de Beauseant, one of the biographies told, with variations, in\nwhispers, every evening in the salons of Paris.",
        "For three years past her name had been spoken of in connection with\nthat of one of the most wealthy and distinguished Portuguese nobles,\nthe Marquis d’Ajuda-Pinto. It was one of those innocent liaisons which\npossess so much charm for the two thus attached to each other that\nthey find the presence of a third person intolerable. The Vicomte de\nBeauseant, therefore, had himself set an example to the rest of the\nworld by respecting, with as good a grace as might be, this morganatic\nunion. Any one who came to call on the Vicomtesse in the early days of\nthis friendship was sure to find the Marquis d’Ajuda-Pinto there. As,\nunder the circumstances, Mme. de Beauseant could not very well shut\nher door against these visitors, she gave them such a cold reception,\nand showed so much interest in the study of the ceiling, that no one\ncould fail to understand how much he bored her; and when it became\nknown in Paris that Mme. de Beauseant was bored by callers between two\nand four o’clock, she was left in perfect solitude during that\ninterval. She went to the Bouffons or to the Opera with M. de\nBeauseant and M. d’Ajuda-Pinto; and M. de Beauseant, like a well-bred\nman of the world, always left his wife and the Portuguese as soon as\nhe had installed them. But M. d’Ajuda-Pinto must marry, and a Mlle. de\nRochefide was the young lady. In the whole fashionable world there was\nbut one person who as yet knew nothing of the arrangement, and that\nwas Mme. de Beauseant. Some of her friends had hinted at the\npossibility, and she had laughed at them, believing that envy had\nprompted those ladies to try to make mischief. And now, though the\nbans were about to be published, and although the handsome Portuguese\nhad come that day to break the news to the Vicomtesse, he had not\nfound courage as yet to say one word about his treachery. How was it?\nNothing is doubtless more difficult than the notification of an\nultimatum of this kind. There are men who feel more at their ease when\nthey stand up before another man who threatens their lives with sword\nor pistol than in the presence of a woman who, after two hours of\nlamentations and reproaches, falls into a dead swoon and requires\nsalts. At this moment, therefore, M. d’Ajuda-Pinto was on thorns, and\nanxious to take his leave. He told himself that in some way or other\nthe news would reach Mme. de Beauseant; he would write, it would be\nmuch better to do it by letter, and not to utter the words that should\nstab her to the heart.",
        "So when the servant announced M. Eugene de Rastignac, the Marquis\nd’Ajuda-Pinto trembled with joy. To be sure, a loving woman shows even\nmore ingenuity in inventing doubts of her lover than in varying the\nmonotony of his happiness; and when she is about to be forsaken, she\ninstinctively interprets every gesture as rapidly as Virgil’s courser\ndetected the presence of his companion by snuffing the breeze. It was\nimpossible, therefore, that Mme. de Beauseant should not detect that\ninvoluntary thrill of satisfaction; slight though it was, it was\nappalling in its artlessness.",
        "Eugene had yet to learn that no one in Paris should present himself in\nany house without first making himself acquainted with the whole\nhistory of its owner, and of its owner’s wife and family, so that he\nmay avoid making any of the terrible blunders which in Poland draw\nforth the picturesque exclamation, “Harness five bullocks to your\ncart!” probably because you will need them all to pull you out of the\nquagmire into which a false step has plunged you. If, down to the\npresent day, our language has no name for these conversational\ndisasters, it is probably because they are believed to be impossible,\nthe publicity given in Paris to every scandal is so prodigious. After\nthe awkward incident at Mme. de Restaud’s, no one but Eugene could\nhave reappeared in his character of bullock-driver in Mme. de\nBeauseant’s drawing-room. But if Mme. de Restaud and M. de Trailles\nhad found him horribly in the way, M. d’Ajuda hailed his coming with\nrelief.",
        "“Good-bye,” said the Portuguese, hurrying to the door, as Eugene made\nhis entrance into a dainty little pink-and-gray drawing-room, where\nluxury seemed nothing more than good taste.",
        "“Until this evening,” said Mme. de Beauseant, turning her head to give\nthe Marquis a glance. “We are going to the Bouffons, are we not?”",
        "“I cannot go,” he said, with his fingers on the door handle.",
        "Mme. de Beauseant rose and beckoned to him to return. She did not pay\nthe slightest attention to Eugene, who stood there dazzled by the\nsparkling marvels around him; he began to think that this was some\nstory out of the Arabian Nights made real, and did not know where to\nhide himself, when the woman before him seemed to be unconscious of\nhis existence. The Vicomtesse had raised the forefinger of her right\nhand, and gracefully signed to the Marquis to seat himself beside her.\nThe Marquis felt the imperious sway of passion in her gesture; he came\nback towards her. Eugene watched him, not without a feeling of envy.",
        "“That is the owner of the brougham!” he said to himself. “But is it\nnecessary to have a pair of spirited horses, servants in livery, and\ntorrents of gold to draw a glance from a woman here in Paris?”",
        "The demon of luxury gnawed at his heart, greed burned in his veins,\nhis throat was parched with the thirst of gold.",
        "He had a hundred and thirty francs every quarter. His father, mother,\nbrothers, sisters, and aunt did not spend two hundred francs a month\namong them. This swift comparison between his present condition and\nthe aims he had in view helped to benumb his faculties.",
        "“Why not?” the Vicomtesse was saying, as she smiled at the Portuguese.\n\"Why cannot you come to the Italiens?”",
        "“Affairs! I am to dine with the English Ambassador.”",
        "“Throw him over.”",
        "When a man once enters on a course of deception, he is compelled to\nadd lie to lie. M. d’Ajuda therefore said, smiling, “Do you lay your\ncommands on me?”",
        "“Yes, certainly.”",
        "“That was what I wanted to have you say to me,” he answered,\ndissembling his feelings in a glance which would have reassured any\nother woman.",
        "He took the Vicomtesse’s hand, kissed it, and went.",
        "Eugene ran his fingers through his hair, and constrained himself to\nbow. He thought that now Mme. de Beauseant would give him her\nattention; but suddenly she sprang forward, rushed to a window in the\ngallery, and watched M. d’Ajuda step into his carriage; she listened\nto the order that he gave, and heard the Swiss repeat it to the\ncoachman:",
        "“To M. de Rochefide’s house.”",
        "Those words, and the way in which M. d’Ajuda flung himself back in the\ncarriage, were like a lightning flash and a thunderbolt for her; she\nwalked back again with a deadly fear gnawing at her heart. The most\nterrible catastrophes only happen among the heights. The Vicomtesse\nwent to her own room, sat down at a table, and took up a sheet of\ndainty notepaper.",
        "  “When, instead of dining with the English Ambassador,\"\n   she wrote, “you go to the Rochefides, you owe me an\n   explanation, which I am waiting to hear.”",
        "She retraced several of the letters, for her hand was trembling so\nthat they were indistinct; then she signed the note with an initial C\nfor “Claire de Bourgogne,” and rang the bell.",
        "“Jacques,” she said to the servant, who appeared immediately, “take\nthis note to M. de Rochefide’s house at half-past seven and ask for\nthe Marquis d’Ajuda. If M. d’Ajuda is there, leave the note without\nwaiting for an answer; if he is not there, bring the note back to me.”",
        "“Madame la Vicomtess, there is a visitor in the drawing-room.”",
        "“Ah! yes, of course,” she said, opening the door.",
        "Eugene was beginning to feel very uncomfortable, but at last the\nVicomtesse appeared; she spoke to him, and the tremulous tones of her\nvoice vibrated through his heart.",
        "“Pardon me, monsieur,” she said; “I had a letter to write. Now I am\nquite at liberty.”",
        "She scarcely knew what she was saying, for even as she spoke she\nthought, “Ah! he means to marry Mlle. de Rochefide? But is he still\nfree? This evening the marriage shall be broken off, or else . . . But\nbefore to-morrow I shall know.”",
        "“Cousin . . .” the student replied.",
        "“Eh?” said the Countess, with an insolent glance that sent a cold\nshudder through Eugene; he understood what that “Eh?” meant; he had\nlearned a great deal in three hours, and his wits were on the alert.\nHe reddened:",
        "“Madame . . .” he began; he hesitated a moment, and then went on.\n\"Pardon me; I am in such need of protection that the nearest scrap of\nrelationship could do me no harm.”",
        "Mme. de Beauseant smiled but there was sadness in her smile; even now\nshe felt forebodings of the coming pain, the air she breathed was\nheavy with the storm that was about to burst.",
        "“If you knew how my family are situated,” he went on, “you would love\nto play the part of a beneficent fairy godmother who graciously clears\nthe obstacles from the path of her protege.”",
        "“Well, cousin,” she said, laughing, “and how can I be of service to\nyou?”",
        "“But do I know even that? I am distantly related to you, and this\nobscure and remote relationship is even now a perfect godsend to me.\nYou have confused my ideas; I cannot remember the things that I meant\nto say to you. I know no one else here in Paris. . . . Ah! if I could\nonly ask you to counsel me, ask you to look upon me as a poor child\nwho would fain cling to the hem of your dress, who would lay down his\nlife for you.”",
        "“Would you kill a man for me?”",
        "“Two,” said Eugene.",
        "“You, child. Yes, you are a child,” she said, keeping back the tears\nthat came to her eyes; “you would love sincerely.”",
        "“Oh!” he cried, flinging up his head.",
        "The audacity of the student’s answer interested the Vicomtesse in him.\nThe southern brain was beginning to scheme for the first time. Between\nMme. de Restaud’s blue boudoir and Mme. de Beauseant’s rose-colored\ndrawing-room he had made a three years’ advance in a kind of law which\nis not a recognized study in Paris, although it is a sort of higher\njurisprudence, and, when well understood, is a highroad to success of\nevery kind.",
        "“Ah! that is what I meant to say!” said Eugene. “I met Mme. de Restaud\nat your ball, and this morning I went to see her.",
        "“You must have been very much in the way,” said Mme. de Beauseant,\nsmiling as she spoke.",
        "“Yes, indeed. I am a novice, and my blunders will set every one\nagainst me, if you do not give me your counsel. I believe that in\nParis it is very difficult to meet with a young, beautiful, and\nwealthy woman of fashion who would be willing to teach me, what you\nwomen can explain so well–life. I shall find a M. de Trailles\neverywhere. So I have come to you to ask you to give me a key to a\npuzzle, to entreat you to tell me what sort of blunder I made this\nmorning. I mentioned an old man––”",
        "“Madame la Duchess de Langeais,” Jacques cut the student short; Eugene\ngave expression to his intense annoyance by a gesture.",
        "“If you mean to succeed,” said the Vicomtesse in a low voice, “in the\nfirst place you must not be so demonstrative.”",
        "“Ah! good morning, dear,” she continued, and rising and crossing the\nroom, she grasped the Duchess’ hands as affectionately as if they had\nbeen sisters; the Duchess responded in the prettiest and most gracious\nway.",
        "“Two intimate friends!” said Rastignac to himself. “Henceforward I\nshall have two protectresses; those two women are great friends, no\ndoubt, and this newcomer will doubtless interest herself in her\nfriend’s cousin.”",
        "“To what happy inspiration do I owe this piece of good fortune, dear\nAntoinette?” asked Mme. de Beauseant.",
        "“Well, I saw M. d’Ajuda-Pinto at M. de Rochefide’s door, so I thought\nthat if I came I should find you alone.”",
        "Mme. de Beauseant’s mouth did not tighten, her color did not rise, her\nexpression did not alter, or rather, her brow seemed to clear as the\nDuchess uttered those deadly words.",
        "“If I had known that you were engaged––” the speaker added, glancing\nat Eugene.",
        "“This gentleman is M. Eugene de Rastignac, one of my cousins,” said\nthe Vicomtesse. “Have you any news of General de Montriveau?” she\ncontinued. “Serizy told me yesterday that he never goes anywhere now;\nhas he been to see you to-day?”",
        "It was believed that the Duchess was desperately in love with M. de\nMontriveau, and that he was a faithless lover; she felt the question\nin her very heart, and her face flushed as she answered:",
        "“He was at the Elysee yesterday.”",
        "“In attendance?”",
        "“Claire,” returned the Duchess, and hatred overflowed in the glances\nshe threw at Mme. de Beauseant; “of course you know that M.\nd’Ajuda-Pinto is going to marry Mlle. de Rochefide; the bans will be\npublished to-morrow.”",
        "This thrust was too cruel; the Vicomtesse’s face grew white, but she\nanswered, laughing, “One of those rumors that fools amuse themselves\nwith. What should induce M. d’Ajuda to take one of the noblest names\nin Portugal to the Rochefides? The Rochefides were only ennobled\nyesterday.”",
        "“But Bertha will have two hundred thousand livres a year, they say.”",
        "“M. d’Ajuda is too wealthy to marry for money.”",
        "“But, my dear, Mlle. de Rochefide is a charming girl.”",
        "“Indeed?”",
        "“And, as a matter of fact, he is dining with them to-day; the thing is\nsettled. It is very surprising to me that you should know so little\nabout it.”",
        "Mme. de Beauseant turned to Rastignac. “What was the blunder that you\nmade, monsieur?” she asked. “The poor boy is only just launched into\nthe world, Antoinette, so that he understands nothing of all this that\nwe are speaking of. Be merciful to him, and let us finish our talk\nto-morrow. Everything will be announced to-morrow, you know, and your\nkind informal communication can be accompanied by official\nconfirmation.”",
        "The Duchess gave Eugene one of those insolent glances that measure a\nman from head to foot, and leave him crushed and annihilated.",
        "“Madame, I have unwittingly plunged a dagger into Mme. de Restaud’s\nheart; unwittingly–therein lies my offence,” said the student of law,\nwhose keen brain had served him sufficiently well, for he had detected\nthe biting epigrams that lurked beneath this friendly talk. “You\ncontinue to receive, possibly you fear, those who know the amount of\npain that they deliberately inflict; but a clumsy blunderer who has no\nidea how deeply he wounds is looked upon as a fool who does not know\nhow to make use of his opportunities, and every one despises him.”",
        "Mme. de Beauseant gave the student a glance, one of those glances in\nwhich a great soul can mingle dignity and gratitude. It was like balm\nto the law student, who was still smarting under the Duchess’ insolent\nscrutiny; she had looked at him as an auctioneer might look at some\narticle to appraise its value.",
        "“Imagine, too, that I had just made some progress with the Comte de\nRestaud; for I should tell you, madame,” he went on, turning to the\nDuchess with a mixture of humility and malice in his manner, “that as\nyet I am only a poor devil of a student, very much alone in the world,\nand very poor––”",
        "“You should not tell us that, M. de Rastignac. We women never care\nabout anything that no one else will take.”",
        "“Bah!” said Eugene. “I am only two-and-twenty, and I must make up my\nmind to the drawbacks of my time of life. Besides, I am confessing my\nsins, and it would be impossible to kneel in a more charming\nconfessional; you commit your sins in one drawing-room, and receive\nabsolution for them in another.”",
        "The Duchess’ expression grew colder, she did not like the flippant\ntone of these remarks, and showed that she considered them to be in\nbad taste by turning to the Vicomtesse with–\"This gentleman has only\njust come––”",
        "Mme. de Beauseant began to laugh outright at her cousin and at the\nDuchess both.",
        "“He has only just come to Paris, dear, and is in search of some one\nwho will give him lessons in good taste.”",
        "“Mme. la Duchesse,” said Eugene, “is it not natural to wish to be\ninitiated into the mysteries which charm us?” (\"Come, now,” he said to\nhimself, “my language is superfinely elegant, I’m sure.”)",
        "“But Mme. de Restaud is herself, I believe, M. de Trailles’ pupil,\"\nsaid the Duchess.",
        "“Of that I had no idea, madame,” answered the law student, “so I\nrashly came between them. In fact, I got on very well with the lady’s\nhusband, and his wife tolerated me for a time until I took it into my\nhead to tell them that I knew some one of whom I had just caught a\nglimpse as he went out by a back staircase, a man who had given the\nCountess a kiss at the end of a passage.”",
        "“Who was it?” both women asked together.",
        "“An old man who lives at the rate of two louis a month in the Faubourg\nSaint-Marceau, where I, a poor student, lodge likewise. He is a truly\nunfortunate creature, everybody laughs at him–we all call him ’Father\nGoriot.’”",
        "“Why, child that you are,” cried the Vicomtesse, “Mme. de Restaud was\na Mlle. Goriot!”",
        "“The daughter of a vermicelli manufacturer,” the Duchess added; “and\nwhen the little creature went to Court, the daughter of a pastry-cook\nwas presented on the same day. Do you remember, Claire? The King began\nto laugh, and made some joke in Latin about flour. People–what was\nit?–people––”",
        "“Ejusdem farinoe,” said Eugene.",
        "“Yes, that was it,” said the Duchess.",
        "“Oh! is that her father?” the law student continued, aghast.",
        "“Yes, certainly; the old man had two daughters; he dotes on them, so\nto speak, though they will scarcely acknowledge him.”",
        "“Didn’t the second daughter marry a banker with a German name?” the\nVicomtesse asked, turning to Mme. de Langeais, “a Baron de Nucingen?\nAnd her name is Delphine, is it not? Isn’t she a fair-haired woman who\nhas a side-box at the Opera? She comes sometimes to the Bouffons, and\nlaughs loudly to attract attention.”",
        "The Duchess smiled and said:",
        "“I wonder at you, dear. Why do you take so much interest in people of\nthat kind? One must have been as madly in love as Restaud was, to be\ninfatuated with Mlle. Anastasie and her flour sacks. Oh! he will not\nfind her a good bargain! She is in M. de Trailles’ hands, and he will\nruin her.”",
        "“And they do not acknowledge their father!” Eugene repeated.",
        "“Oh! well, yes, their father, the father, a father,” replied the\nVicomtesse, “a kind father who gave them each five or six hundred\nthousand francs, it is said, to secure their happiness by marrying\nthem well; while he only kept eight or ten thousand livres a year for\nhimself, thinking that his daughters would always be his daughters,\nthinking that in them he would live his life twice over again, that in\ntheir houses he should find two homes, where he would be loved and\nlooked up to, and made much of. And in two years’ time both his\nsons-in-law had turned him out of their houses as if he were one\nof the lowest outcasts.”",
        "Tears came into Eugene’s eyes. He was still under the spell of\nyouthful beliefs, he had just left home, pure and sacred feelings had\nbeen stirred within him, and this was his first day on the battlefield\nof civilization in Paris. Genuine feeling is so infectious that for a\nmoment the three looked at each other in silence.",
        "“Eh, mon Dieu!” said Mme. de Langeais; “yes, it seems very horrible,\nand yet we see such things every day. Is there not a reason for it?\nTell me, dear, have you ever really thought what a son-in-law is? A\nson-in-law is the man for whom we bring up, you and I, a dear little\none, bound to us very closely in innumerable ways; for seventeen years\nshe will be the joy of her family, its ’white soul,’ as Lamartine\nsays, and suddenly she will become its scourge. When HE comes and\ntakes her from us, his love from the very beginning is like an axe\nlaid to the root of all the old affection in our darling’s heart, and\nall the ties that bound her to her family are severed. But yesterday\nour little daughter thought of no one but her mother and father, as we\nhad no thought that was not for her; by to-morrow she will have become\na hostile stranger. The tragedy is always going on under our eyes. On\nthe one hand you see a father who has sacrificed himself to his son,\nand his daughter-in-law shows him the last degree of insolence. On the\nother hand, it is the son-in-law who turns his wife’s mother out of\nthe house. I sometimes hear it said that there is nothing dramatic\nabout society in these days; but the Drama of the Son-in-law is\nappalling, to say nothing of our marriages, which have come to be very\npoor farces. I can explain how it all came about in the old vermicelli\nmaker’s case. I think I recollect that Foriot––”",
        "“Goriot, madame.”",
        "“Yes, that Moriot was once President of his Section during the\nRevolution. He was in the secret of the famous scarcity of grain, and\nlaid the foundation of his fortune in those days by selling flour for\nten times its cost. He had as much flour as he wanted. My\ngrandmother’s steward sold him immense quantities. No doubt Noriot\nshared the plunder with the Committee of Public Salvation, as that\nsort of person always did. I recollect the steward telling my\ngrandmother that she might live at Grandvilliers in complete security,\nbecause her corn was as good as a certificate of civism. Well, then,\nthis Loriot, who sold corn to those butchers, has never had but one\npassion, they say–he idolizes his daughters. He settled one of them\nunder Restaud’s roof, and grafted the other into the Nucingen family\ntree, the Baron de Nucingen being a rich banker who had turned\nRoyalist. You can quite understand that so long as Bonaparte was\nEmperor, the two sons-in-law could manage to put up with the old\nNinety-three; but after the restoration of the Bourbons, M. de Restaud\nfelt bored by the old man’s society, and the banker was still more\ntired of it. His daughters were still fond of him; they wanted ’to\nkeep the goat and the cabbage,’ so they used to see Joriot whenever\nthere was no one there, under pretence of affection. ’Come to-day,\npapa, we shall have you all to ourselves, and that will be much\nnicer!’ and all that sort of thing. As for me, dear, I believe that\nlove has second-sight: poor Ninety-three; his heart must have bled. He\nsaw that his daughters were ashamed of him, that if they loved their\nhusbands his visits must make mischief. So he immolated himself. He\nmade the sacrifice because he was a father; he went into voluntary\nexile. His daughters were satisfied, so he thought that he had done\nthe best thing he could; but it was a family crime, and father and\ndaughters were accomplices. You see this sort of thing everywhere.\nWhat could this old Doriot have been but a splash of mud in his\ndaughters’ drawing-rooms? He would only have been in the way, and\nbored other people, besides being bored himself. And this that\nhappened between father and daughters may happen to the prettiest\nwoman in Paris and the man she loves the best; if her love grows\ntiresome, he will go; he will descend to the basest trickery to leave\nher. It is the same with all love and friendship. Our heart is a\ntreasury; if you pour out all its wealth at once, you are bankrupt. We\nshow no more mercy to the affection that reveals its utmost extent\nthan we do to another kind of prodigal who has not a penny left. Their\nfather had given them all he had. For twenty years he had given his\nwhole heart to them; then, one day, he gave them all his fortune too.\nThe lemon was squeezed; the girls left the rest in the gutter.”",
        "“The world is very base,” said the Vicomtesse, plucking at the threads\nof her shawl. She did not raise her head as she spoke; the words that\nMme. de Langeais had meant for her in the course of her story had cut\nher to the quick.",
        "“Base? Oh, no,” answered the Duchess; “the world goes its own way,\nthat is all. If I speak in this way, it is only to show that I am not\nduped by it. I think as you do,” she said, pressing the Vicomtesse’s\nhand. “The world is a slough; let us try to live on the heights above\nit.”",
        "She rose to her feet and kissed Mme. de Beauseant on the forehead as\nshe said: “You look very charming to-day, dear. I have never seen such\na lovely color in your cheeks before.”",
        "Then she went out with a slight inclination of the head to the cousin.",
        "“Father Goriot is sublime!” said Eugene to himself, as he remembered\nhow he had watched his neighbor work the silver vessel into a\nshapeless mass that night.",
        "Mme. de Beauseant did not hear him; she was absorbed in her own\nthoughts. For several minutes the silence remained unbroken till the\nlaw student became almost paralyzed with embarrassment, and was\nequally afraid to go or stay or speak a word.",
        "“The world is basely ungrateful and ill-natured,” said the Vicomtesse\nat last. “No sooner does a trouble befall you than a friend is ready\nto bring the tidings and to probe your heart with the point of a\ndagger while calling on you to admire the handle. Epigrams and\nsarcasms already! Ah! I will defend myself!”",
        "She raised her head like the great lady that she was, and lightnings\nflashed from her proud eyes.",
        "“Ah!” she said, as she saw Eugene, “are you there?”",
        "“Still,” he said piteously.",
        "“Well, then, M. de Rastignac, deal with the world as it deserves. You\nare determined to succeed? I will help you. You shall sound the depths\nof corruption in woman; you shall measure the extent of man’s pitiful\nvanity. Deeply as I am versed in such learning, there were pages in\nthe book of life that I had not read. Now I know all. The more\ncold-blooded your calculations, the further you will go. Strike\nruthlessly; you will be feared. Men and women for you must be nothing\nmore than post-horses; take a fresh relay, and leave the last to drop\nby the roadside; in this way you will reach the goal of your ambition.\nYou will be nothing here, you see, unless a woman interests herself in\nyou; and she must be young and wealthy, and a woman of the world. Yet,\nif you have a heart, lock it carefully away like a treasure; do not\nlet any one suspect it, or you will be lost; you would cease to be the\nexecutioner, you would take the victim’s place. And if ever you should\nlove, never let your secret escape you! Trust no one until you are\nvery sure of the heart to which you open your heart. Learn to mistrust\nevery one; take every precaution for the sake of the love which does\nnot exist as yet. Listen, Miguel\"–the name slipped from her so\nnaturally that she did not notice her mistake–\"there is something\nstill more appalling than the ingratitude of daughters who have cast\noff their old father and wish that he were dead, and that is a rivalry\nbetween two sisters. Restaud comes of a good family, his wife has been\nreceived into their circle; she has been presented at court; and her\nsister, her wealthy sister, Mme. Delphine de Nucingen, the wife of a\ngreat capitalist, is consumed with envy, and ready to die of spleen.\nThere is gulf set between the sisters–indeed, they are sisters no\nlonger–the two women who refuse to acknowledge their father do not\nacknowledge each other. So Mme. de Nucingen would lap up all the mud\nthat lies between the Rue Saint-Lazare and the Rue de Grenelle to gain\nadmittance to my salon. She fancied that she should gain her end\nthrough de Marsay; she has made herself de Marsay’s slave, and she\nbores him. De Marsay cares very little about her. If you will\nintroduce her to me, you will be her darling, her Benjamin; she will\nidolize you. If, after that, you can love her, do so; if not, make her\nuseful. I will ask her to come once or twice to one of my great\ncrushes, but I will never receive her here in the morning. I will bow\nto her when I see her, and that will be quite sufficient. You have\nshut the Comtesse de Restaud’s door against you by mentioning Father\nGoriot’s name. Yes, my good friend, you may call at her house twenty\ntimes, and every time out of the twenty you will find that she is not\nat home. The servants have their orders, and will not admit you. Very\nwell, then, now let Father Goriot gain the right of entry into her\nsister’s house for you. The beautiful Mme. de Nucingen will give the\nsignal for a battle. As soon as she singles you out, other women will\nbegin to lose their heads about you, and her enemies and rivals and\nintimate friends will all try to take you from her. There are women\nwho will fall in love with a man because another woman has chosen him;\nlike the city madams, poor things, who copy our millinery, and hope\nthereby to acquire our manners. You will have a success, and in Paris\nsuccess is everything; it is the key of power. If the women credit you\nwith wit and talent, the men will follow suit so long as you do not\nundeceive them yourself. There will be nothing you may not aspire to;\nyou will go everywhere, and you will find out what the world is–an\nassemblage of fools and knaves. But you must be neither the one nor\nthe other. I am giving you my name like Ariadne’s clue of thread to\ntake with you into the labyrinth; make no unworthy use of it,” she\nsaid, with a queenly glance and curve of her throat; “give it back to\nme unsullied. And now, go; leave me. We women also have our battles to\nfight.”",
        "“And if you should ever need some one who would gladly set a match to\na train for you––”",
        "“Well?” she asked.",
        "He tapped his heart, smiled in answer to his cousin’s smile, and went.",
        "It was five o’clock, and Eugene was hungry; he was afraid lest he\nshould not be in time for dinner, a misgiving which made him feel that\nit was pleasant to be borne so quickly across Paris. This sensation of\nphysical comfort left his mind free to grapple with the thoughts that\nassailed him. A mortification usually sends a young man of his age\ninto a furious rage; he shakes his fist at society, and vows vengeance\nwhen his belief in himself is shaken. Just then Rastignac was\noverwhelmed by the words, “You have shut the Countess’ door against\nyou.”",
        "“I shall call!” he said to himself, “and if Mme. de Beauseant is\nright, if I never find her at home–I . . . well, Mme. de Restaud\nshall meet me in every salon in Paris. I will learn to fence and have\nsome pistol practice, and kill that Maxime of hers!”",
        "“And money?” cried an inward monitor. “How about money, where is that\nto come from?” And all at once the wealth displayed in the Countess de\nRestaud’s drawing-room rose before his eyes. That was the luxury which\nGoriot’s daughter had loved too well, the gilding, the ostentatious\nsplendor, the unintelligent luxury of the parvenu, the riotous\nextravagance of a courtesan. Then the attractive vision suddenly went\nunder an eclipse as he remembered the stately grandeur of the Hotel de\nBeauseant. As his fancy wandered among these lofty regions in the\ngreat world of Paris, innumerable dark thoughts gathered in his heart;\nhis ideas widened, and his conscience grew more elastic. He saw the\nworld as it is; saw how the rich lived beyond the jurisdiction of law\nand public opinion, and found in success the ultima ratio mundi.",
        "“Vautrin is right, success is virtue!” he said to himself.",
        "Arrived in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, he rushed up to his room\nfor ten francs wherewith to satisfy the demands of the cabman, and\nwent in to dinner. He glanced round the squalid room, saw the eighteen\npoverty-stricken creatures about to feed like cattle in their stalls,\nand the sight filled him with loathing. The transition was too sudden,\nand the contrast was so violent that it could not but act as a\npowerful stimulant; his ambition developed and grew beyond all social\nbounds. On the one hand, he beheld a vision of social life in its most\ncharming and refined forms, of quick-pulsed youth, of fair,\nimpassioned faces invested with all the charm of poetry, framed in a\nmarvelous setting of luxury or art; and, on the other hand, he saw a\nsombre picture, the miry verge beyond these faces, in which passion\nwas extinct and nothing was left of the drama but the cords and\npulleys and bare mechanism. Mme. de Beauseant’s counsels, the words\nuttered in anger by the forsaken lady, her petulant offer, came to his\nmind, and poverty was a ready expositor. Rastignac determined to open\ntwo parallel trenches so as to insure success; he would be a learned\ndoctor of law and a man of fashion. Clearly he was still a child!\nThose two lines are asymptotes, and will never meet.",
        "“You are very dull, my lord Marquis,” said Vautrin, with one of the\nshrewd glances that seem to read the innermost secrets of another\nmind.",
        "“I am not in the humor to stand jokes from people who call me ’my lord\nMarquis,’” answered Eugene. “A marquis here in Paris, if he is not\nthe veriest sham, ought to have a hundred thousand livres a year at\nleast; and a lodger in the Maison Vauquer is not exactly Fortune’s\nfavorite.”",
        "Vautrin’s glance at Rastignac was half-paternal, half-contemptuous.\n\"Puppy!” it seemed to say; “I should make one mouthful of him!” Then\nhe answered:",
        "“You are in a bad humor; perhaps your visit to the beautiful Comtesse\nde Restaud was not a success.”",
        "“She has shut her door against me because I told her that her father\ndined at our table,” cried Rastignac.",
        "Glances were exchanged all round the room; Father Goriot looked down.",
        "“You have sent some snuff into my eye,” he said to his neighbor,\nturning a little aside to rub his hand over his face.",
        "“Any one who molests Father Goriot will have henceforward to reckon\nwith me,” said Eugene, looking at the old man’s neighbor; “he is worth\nall the rest of us put together.–I am not speaking of the ladies,” he\nadded, turning in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer.",
        "Eugene’s remarks produced a sensation, and his tone silenced the\ndinner-table. Vautrin alone spoke. “If you are going to champion\nFather Goriot, and set up for his responsible editor into the bargain,\nyou had need be a crack shot and know how to handle the foils,” he\nsaid, banteringly.",
        "“So I intend,” said Eugene.",
        "“Then you are taking the field to-day?”",
        "“Perhaps,” Rastignac answered. “But I owe no account of myself to any\none, especially as I do not try to find out what other people do of a\nnight.”",
        "Vautrin looked askance at Rastignac.",
        "“If you do not mean to be deceived by the puppets, my boy, you must go\nbehind and see the whole show, and not peep through holes in the\ncurtain. That is enough,” he added, seeing that Eugene was about to\nfly into a passion. “We can have a little talk whenever you like.”",
        "There was a general feeling of gloom and constraint. Father Goriot was\nso deeply dejected by the student’s remark that he did not notice the\nchange in the disposition of his fellow-lodgers, nor know that he had\nmet with a champion capable of putting an end to the persecution.",
        "“Then, M. Goriot sitting there is the father of a countess,” said Mme.\nVauquer in a low voice.",
        "“And of a baroness,” answered Rastignac.",
        "“That is about all he is capable of,” said Bianchon to Rastignac; “I\nhave taken a look at his head; there is only one bump–the bump of\nPaternity; he must be an eternal father.”",
        "Eugene was too intent on his thoughts to laugh at Bianchon’s joke. He\ndetermined to profit by Mme. de Beauseant’s counsels, and was asking\nhimself how he could obtain the necessary money. He grew grave. The\nwide savannas of the world stretched before his eyes; all things lay\nbefore him, nothing was his. Dinner came to an end, the others went,\nand he was left in the dining-room.",
        "“So you have seen my daughter?” Goriot spoke tremulously, and the\nsound of his voice broke in upon Eugene’s dreams. The young man took\nthe elder’s hand, and looked at him with something like kindness in\nhis eyes.",
        "“You are a good and noble man,” he said. “We will have some talk about\nyour daughters by and by.”",
        "He rose without waiting for Goriot’s answer, and went to his room.\nThere he wrote the following letter to his mother:–",
        " “My Dear Mother,–Can you nourish your child from your breast\n  again? I am in a position to make a rapid fortune, but I want\n  twelve hundred francs–I must have them at all costs. Say nothing\n  about this to my father; perhaps he might make objections, and\n  unless I have the money, I may be led to put an end to myself, and\n  so escape the clutches of despair. I will tell you everything when\n  I see you. I will not begin to try to describe my present\n  situation; it would take volumes to put the whole story clearly\n  and fully. I have not been gambling, my kind mother, I owe no one\n  a penny; but if you would preserve the life that you gave me, you\n  must send me the sum I mention. As a matter of fact, I go to see\n  the Vicomtesse de Beauseant; she is using her influence for me; I\n  am obliged to go into society, and I have not a penny to lay out\n  on clean gloves. I can manage to exist on bread and water, or go\n  without food, if need be, but I cannot do without the tools with\n  which they cultivate the vineyards in this country. I must\n  resolutely make up my mind at once to make my way, or stick in the\n  mire for the rest of my days. I know that all your hopes are set\n  on me, and I want to realize them quickly. Sell some of your old\n  jewelry, my kind mother; I will give you other jewels very soon. I\n  know enough of our affairs at home to know all that such a\n  sacrifice means, and you must not think that I would lightly ask\n  you to make it; I should be a monster if I could. You must think\n  of my entreaty as a cry forced from me by imperative necessity.\n  Our whole future lies in the subsidy with which I must begin my\n  first campaign, for life in Paris is one continual battle. If you\n  cannot otherwise procure the whole of the money, and are forced to\n  sell our aunt’s lace, tell her that I will send her some still\n  handsomer,” and so forth.",
        "He wrote to ask each of his sisters for their savings–would they\ndespoil themselves for him, and keep the sacrifice a secret from the\nfamily? To his request he knew that they would not fail to respond\ngladly, and he added to it an appeal to their delicacy by touching the\nchord of honor that vibrates so loudly in young and high-strung\nnatures.",
        "Yet when he had written the letters, he could not help feeling\nmisgivings in spite of his youthful ambition; his heart beat fast, and\nhe trembled. He knew the spotless nobleness of the lives buried away\nin the lonely manor house; he knew what trouble and what joy his\nrequest would cause his sisters, and how happy they would be as they\ntalked at the bottom of the orchard of that dear brother of theirs in\nParis. Visions rose before his eyes; a sudden strong light revealed\nhis sisters secretly counting over their little store, devising some\ngirlish stratagem by which the money could be sent to him incognito,\nessaying, for the first time in their lives, a piece of deceit that\nreached the sublime in its unselfishness.",
        "“A sister’s heart is a diamond for purity, a deep sea of tenderness!\"\nhe said to himself. He felt ashamed of those letters.",
        "What power there must be in the petitions put up by such hearts; how\npure the fervor that bears their souls to Heaven in prayer! What\nexquisite joy they would find in self-sacrifice! What a pang for his\nmother’s heart if she could not send him all that he asked for! And\nthis noble affection, these sacrifices made at such terrible cost,\nwere to serve as the ladder by which he meant to climb to Delphine de\nNucingen. A few tears, like the last grains of incense flung upon the\nsacred alter fire of the hearth, fell from his eyes. He walked up and\ndown, and despair mingled with his emotion. Father Goriot saw him\nthrough the half-open door.",
        "“What is the matter, sir?” he asked from the threshold.",
        "“Ah! my good neighbor, I am as much a son and brother as you are a\nfather. You do well to fear for the Comtesse Anastasie; there is one\nM. Maxime de Trailles, who will be her ruin.”",
        "Father Goriot withdrew, stammering some words, but Eugene failed to\ncatch their meaning.",
        "The next morning Rastignac went out to post his letters. Up to the\nlast moment he wavered and doubted, but he ended by flinging them into\nthe box. “I shall succeed!” he said to himself. So says the gambler;\nso says the great captain; but the three words that have been the\nsalvation of some few, have been the ruin of many more.",
        "A few days after this Eugene called at Mme. de Restaud’s house; she\nwas not at home. Three times he tried the experiment, and three times\nhe found her doors closed against him, though he was careful to choose\nan hour when M. de Trailles was not there. The Vicomtesse was right.",
        "The student studied no longer. He put in an appearance at lectures\nsimply to answer to his name, and after thus attesting his presence,\ndeparted forthwith. He had been through a reasoning process familiar\nto most students. He had seen the advisability of deferring his\nstudies to the last moment before going up for his examinations; he\nmade up his mind to cram his second and third years’ work into the\nthird year, when he meant to begin to work in earnest, and to complete\nhis studies in law with one great effort. In the meantime he had\nfifteen months in which to navigate the ocean of Paris, to spread the\nnets and set the lines that would bring him a protectress and a\nfortune. Twice during that week he saw Mme. de Beauseant; he did not\ngo to her house until he had seen the Marquis d’Ajuda drive away.",
        "Victory for yet a few more days was with the great lady, the most\npoetic figure in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; and the marriage of the\nMarquis d’Ajuda-Pinto with Mlle. de Rochefide was postponed. The dread\nof losing her happiness filled those days with a fever of joy unknown\nbefore, but the end was only so much the nearer. The Marquis d’Ajuda\nand the Rochefides agreed that this quarrel and reconciliation was a\nvery fortunate thing; Mme. de Beauseant (so they hoped) would\ngradually become reconciled to the idea of the marriage, and in the\nend would be brought to sacrifice d’Ajuda’s morning visits to the\nexigencies of a man’s career, exigencies which she must have foreseen.\nIn spite of the most solemn promises, daily renewed, M. d’Ajuda was\nplaying a part, and the Vicomtesse was eager to be deceived. “Instead\nof taking a leap heroically from the window, she is falling headlong\ndown the staircase,” said her most intimate friend, the Duchesse de\nLangeais. Yet this after-glow of happiness lasted long enough for the\nVicomtesse to be of service to her young cousin. She had a\nhalf-superstitious affection for him. Eugene had shown her sympathy\nand devotion at a crisis when a woman sees no pity, no real comfort\nin any eyes; when if a man is ready with soothing flatteries, it is\nbecause he has an interested motive.",
        "Rastignac made up his mind that he must learn the whole of Goriot’s\nprevious history; he would come to his bearings before attempting to\nboard the Maison de Nucingen. The results of his inquiries may be\ngiven briefly as follows:–",
        "In the days before the Revolution, Jean-Joachim Goriot was simply a\nworkman in the employ of a vermicelli maker. He was a skilful, thrifty\nworkman, sufficiently enterprising to buy his master’s business when\nthe latter fell a chance victim to the disturbances of 1789. Goriot\nestablished himself in the Rue de la Jussienne, close to the Corn\nExchange. His plain good sense led him to accept the position of\nPresident of the Section, so as to secure for his business the\nprotection of those in power at that dangerous epoch. This prudent\nstep had led to success; the foundations of his fortune were laid in\nthe time of the Scarcity (real or artificial), when the price of grain\nof all kinds rose enormously in Paris. People used to fight for bread\nat the bakers’ doors; while other persons went to the grocers’ shops\nand bought Italian paste foods without brawling over it. It was during\nthis year that Goriot made the money, which, at a later time, was to\ngive him all the advantage of the great capitalist over the small\nbuyer; he had, moreover, the usual luck of average ability; his\nmediocrity was the salvation of him. He excited no one’s envy, it was\nnot even suspected that he was rich till the peril of being rich was\nover, and all his intelligence was concentrated, not on political, but\non commercial speculations. Goriot was an authority second to none on\nall questions relating to corn, flour, and “middlings\"; and the\nproduction, storage, and quality of grain. He could estimate the yield\nof the harvest, and foresee market prices; he bought his cereals in\nSicily, and imported Russian wheat. Any one who had heard him hold\nforth on the regulations that control the importation and exportation\nof grain, who had seen his grasp of the subject, his clear insight\ninto the principles involved, his appreciation of weak points in the\nway that the system worked, would have thought that here was the stuff\nof which a minister is made. Patient, active, and persevering,\nenergetic and prompt in action, he surveyed his business horizon with\nan eagle eye. Nothing there took him by surprise; he foresaw all\nthings, knew all that was happening, and kept his own counsel; he was\na diplomatist in his quick comprehension of a situation; and in the\nroutine of business he was as patient and plodding as a soldier on the\nmarch. But beyond this business horizon he could not see. He used to\nspend his hours of leisure on the threshold of his shop, leaning\nagainst the framework of the door. Take him from his dark little\ncounting-house, and he became once more the rough, slow-witted\nworkman, a man who cannot understand a piece of reasoning, who is\nindifferent to all intellectual pleasures, and falls asleep at the\nplay, a Parisian Dolibom in short, against whose stupidity other minds\nare powerless.",
        "Natures of this kind are nearly all alike; in almost all of them you\nwill find some hidden depth of sublime affection. Two all-absorbing\naffections filled the vermicelli maker’s heart to the exclusion of\nevery other feeling; into them he seemed to put all the forces of his\nnature, as he put the whole power of his brain into the corn trade. He\nhad regarded his wife, the only daughter of a rich farmer of La Brie,\nwith a devout admiration; his love for her had been boundless. Goriot\nhad felt the charm of a lovely and sensitive nature, which, in its\ndelicate strength, was the very opposite of his own. Is there any\ninstinct more deeply implanted in the heart of man than the pride of\nprotection, a protection which is constantly exerted for a fragile and\ndefenceless creature? Join love thereto, the warmth of gratitude that\nall generous souls feel for the source of their pleasures, and you\nhave the explanation of many strange incongruities in human nature.",
        "After seven years of unclouded happiness, Goriot lost his wife. It was\nvery unfortunate for him. She was beginning to gain an ascendency over\nhim in other ways; possibly she might have brought that barren soil\nunder cultivation, she might have widened his ideas and given other\ndirections to his thoughts. But when she was dead, the instinct of\nfatherhood developed in him till it almost became a mania. All the\naffection balked by death seemed to turn to his daughters, and he\nfound full satisfaction for his heart in loving them. More or less\nbrilliant proposals were made to him from time to time; wealthy\nmerchants or farmers with daughters vied with each other in offering\ninducements to him to marry again; but he determined to remain a\nwidower. His father-in-law, the only man for whom he felt a decided\nfriendship, gave out that Goriot had made a vow to be faithful to his\nwife’s memory. The frequenters of the Corn Exchange, who could not\ncomprehend this sublime piece of folly, joked about it among\nthemselves, and found a ridiculous nickname for him. One of them\nventured (after a glass over a bargain) to call him by it, and a blow\nfrom the vermicelli maker’s fist sent him headlong into a gutter in\nthe Rue Oblin. He could think of nothing else when his children were\nconcerned; his love for them made him fidgety and anxious; and this\nwas so well known, that one day a competitor, who wished to get rid of\nhim to secure the field to himself, told Goriot that Delphine had just\nbeen knocked down by a cab. The vermicelli maker turned ghastly pale,\nleft the Exchange at once, and did not return for several days\nafterwards; he was ill in consequence of the shock and the subsequent\nrelief on discovering that it was a false alarm. This time, however,\nthe offender did not escape with a bruised shoulder; at a critical\nmoment in the man’s affairs, Goriot drove him into bankruptcy, and\nforced him to disappear from the Corn Exchange.",
        "As might have been expected, the two girls were spoiled. With an\nincome of sixty thousand francs, Goriot scarcely spent twelve hundred\non himself, and found all his happiness in satisfying the whims of the\ntwo girls. The best masters were engaged, that Anastasie and Delphine\nmight be endowed with all the accomplishments which distinguish a good\neducation. They had a chaperon–luckily for them, she was a woman who\nhad good sense and good taste;–they learned to ride; they had a\ncarriage for their use; they lived as the mistress of a rich old lord\nmight live; they had only to express a wish, their father would hasten\nto give them their most extravagant desires, and asked nothing of them\nin return but a kiss. Goriot had raised the two girls to the level of\nthe angels; and, quite naturally, he himself was left beneath them.\nPoor man! he loved them even for the pain that they gave him.",
        "When the girls were old enough to be married, they were left free to\nchoose for themselves. Each had half her father’s fortune as her\ndowry; and when the Comte de Restaud came to woo Anastasie for her\nbeauty, her social aspirations led her to leave her father’s house for\na more exalted sphere. Delphine wished for money; she married\nNucingen, a banker of German extraction, who became a Baron of the\nHoly Roman Empire. Goriot remained a vermicelli maker as before. His\ndaughters and his sons-in-law began to demur; they did not like to see\nhim still engaged in trade, though his whole life was bound up with\nhis business. For five years he stood out against their entreaties,\nthen he yielded, and consented to retire on the amount realized by the\nsale of his business and the savings of the last few years. It was\nthis capital that Mme. Vauquer, in the early days of his residence\nwith her, had calculated would bring in eight or ten thousand livres\nin a year. He had taken refuge in her lodging-house, driven there by\ndespair when he knew that his daughters were compelled by their\nhusbands not only to refuse to receive him as an inmate in their\nhouses, but even to see him no more except in private.",
        "This was all the information which Rastignac gained from a M. Muret\nwho had purchased Goriot’s business, information which confirmed the\nDuchesse de Langeais’ suppositions, and herewith the preliminary\nexplanation of this obscure but terrible Parisian tragedy comes to an\nend.",
        "Towards the end of the first week in December Rastignac received two\nletters–one from his mother, and one from his eldest sister. His\nheart beat fast, half with happiness, half with fear, at the sight of\nthe familiar handwriting. Those two little scraps of paper contained\nlife or death for his hopes. But while he felt a shiver of dread as he\nremembered their dire poverty at home, he knew their love for him so\nwell that he could not help fearing that he was draining their very\nlife-blood. His mother’s letter ran as follows:–",
        " “MY DEAR CHILD,–I am sending you the money that you asked for.\n  Make a good use of it. Even to save your life I could not raise so\n  large a sum a second time without your father’s knowledge, and\n  there would be trouble about it. We should be obliged to mortgage\n  the land. It is impossible to judge of the merits of schemes of\n  which I am ignorant; but what sort of schemes can they be, that\n  you should fear to tell me about them? Volumes of explanation\n  would not have been needed; we mothers can understand at a word,\n  and that word would have spared me the anguish of uncertainty. I\n  do not know how to hide the painful impression that your letter\n  has made upon me, my dear son. What can you have felt when you\n  were moved to send this chill of dread through my heart? It must\n  have been very painful to you to write the letter that gave me so\n  much pain as I read it. To what courses are you committed? You are\n  going to appear to be something that you are not, and your whole\n  life and success depends upon this? You are about to see a society\n  into which you cannot enter without rushing into expense that you\n  cannot afford, without losing precious time that is needed for\n  your studies. Ah! my dear Eugene, believe your mother, crooked\n  ways cannot lead to great ends. Patience and endurance are the two\n  qualities most needed in your position. I am not scolding you; I\n  do not want any tinge of bitterness to spoil our offering. I am\n  only talking like a mother whose trust in you is as great as her\n  foresight for you. You know the steps that you must take, and I,\n  for my part, know the purity of heart, and how good your\n  intentions are; so I can say to you without a doubt, ’Go forward,\n  beloved!’ If I tremble, it is because I am a mother, but my\n  prayers and blessings will be with you at every step. Be very\n  careful, dear boy. You must have a man’s prudence, for it lies\n  with you to shape the destinies of five others who are dear to\n  you, and must look to you. Yes, our fortunes depend upon you, and\n  your success is ours. We all pray to God to be with you in all\n  that you do. Your aunt Marcillac has been most generous beyond\n  words in this matter; she saw at once how it was, even down to\n  your gloves. ’But I have a weakness for the eldest!’ she said\n  gaily. You must love your aunt very much, dear Eugene. I shall\n  wait till you have succeeded before telling you all that she has\n  done for you, or her money would burn your fingers. You, who are\n  young, do not know what it is to part with something that is a\n  piece of your past! But what would we not sacrifice for your\n  sakes? Your aunt says that I am to send you a kiss on the forehead\n  from her, and that kiss is to bring you luck again and again, she\n  says. She would have written you herself, the dear kind-hearted\n  woman, but she is troubled with the gout in her fingers just now.\n  Your father is very well. The vintage of 1819 has turned out\n  better than we expected. Good-bye, dear boy; I will say nothing\n  about your sisters, because Laure is writing to you, and I must\n  let her have the pleasure of giving you all the home news. Heaven\n  send that you may succeed! Oh! yes, dear Eugene, you must succeed.\n  I have come, through you, to a knowledge of a pain so sharp that I\n  do not think I could endure it a second time. I have come to know\n  what it is to be poor, and to long for money for my children’s\n  sake. There, good-bye! Do not leave us for long without news of\n  you; and here, at the last, take a kiss from your mother.”",
        "By the time Eugene had finished the letter he was in tears. He thought\nof Father Goriot crushing his silver keepsake into a shapeless mass\nbefore he sold it to meet his daughter’s bill of exchange.",
        "“Your mother has broken up her jewels for you,” he said to himself;\n\"your aunt shed tears over those relics of hers before she sold them\nfor your sake. What right have you to heap execrations on Anastasie?\nYou have followed her example; you have selfishly sacrificed others to\nyour own future, and she sacrifices her father to her lover; and of\nyou two, which is the worse?”",
        "He was ready to renounce his attempts; he could not bear to take that\nmoney. The fires of remorse burned in his heart, and gave him\nintolerable pain, the generous secret remorse which men seldom take\ninto account when they sit in judgment upon their fellow-men; but\nperhaps the angels in heaven, beholding it, pardon the criminal whom\nour justice condemns. Rastignac opened his sister’s letter; its\nsimplicity and kindness revived his heart.",
        " “Your letter came just at the right time, dear brother. Agathe and\n  I had thought of so many different ways of spending our money,\n  that we did not know what to buy with it; and now you have come\n  in, and, like the servant who upset all the watches that belonged\n  to the King of Spain, you have restored harmony; for, really and\n  truly, we did not know which of all the things we wanted we wanted\n  most, and we were always quarreling about it, never thinking, dear\n  Eugene, of a way of spending our money which would satisfy us\n  completely. Agathe jumped for you. Indeed, we have been like two\n  mad things all day, ’to such a prodigious degree’ (as aunt would\n  say), that mother said, with her severe expression, ’Whatever can\n  be the matter with you, mesdemoiselles?’ I think if we had been\n  scolded a little, we should have been still better pleased. A\n  woman ought to be very glad to suffer for one she loves! I,\n  however, in my inmost soul, was doleful and cross in the midst of\n  all my joy. I shall make a bad wife, I am afraid, I am too fond of\n  spending. I had bought two sashes and a nice little stiletto for\n  piercing eyelet-holes in my stays, trifles that I really did not\n  want, so that I have less than that slow-coach Agathe, who is so\n  economical, and hoards her money like a magpie. She had two\n  hundred francs! And I have only one hundred and fifty! I am nicely\n  punished; I could throw my sash down the well; it will be painful\n  to me to wear it now. Poor dear, I have robbed you. And Agathe was\n  so nice about it. She said, ’Let us send the three hundred and\n  fifty francs in our two names!’ But I could not help telling you\n  everything just as it happened.",
        " “Do you know how we managed to keep your commandments? We took our\n  glittering hoard, we went out for a walk, and when once fairly on\n  the highway we ran all the way to Ruffec, where we handed over the\n  coin, without more ado, to M. Grimbert of the Messageries Royales.\n  We came back again like swallows on the wing. ’Don’t you think\n  that happiness has made us lighter?’ Agathe said. We said all\n  sorts of things, which I shall not tell you, Monsieur le Parisien,\n  because they were all about you. Oh, we love you dearly, dear\n  brother; it was all summed up in those few words. As for keeping\n  the secret, little masqueraders like us are capable of anything\n  (according to our aunt), even of holding our tongues. Our mother\n  has been on a mysterious journey to Angouleme, and the aunt went\n  with her, not without solemn councils, from which we were shut\n  out, and M. le Baron likewise. They are silent as to the weighty\n  political considerations that prompted their mission, and\n  conjectures are rife in the State of Rastignac. The Infantas are\n  embroidering a muslin robe with open-work sprigs for her Majesty\n  the Queen; the work progresses in the most profound secrecy. There\n  be but two more breadths to finish. A decree has gone forth that\n  no wall shall be built on the side of Verteuil, but that a hedge\n  shall be planted instead thereof. Our subjects may sustain some\n  disappointment of fruit and espaliers, but strangers will enjoy\n  a fair prospect. Should the heir-presumptive lack\n  pocket-handkerchiefs, be it known unto him that the dowager Lady\n  of Marcillac, exploring the recesses of her drawers and boxes\n  (known respectively as Pompeii and Herculaneum), having brought to\n  light a fair piece of cambric whereof she wotted not, the Princesses\n  Agathe and Laure place at their brother’s disposal their thread,\n  their needles, and hands somewhat of the reddest. The two young\n  Princes, Don Henri and Don Gabriel, retain their fatal habits of\n  stuffing themselves with grape-jelly, of teasing their sisters, of\n  taking their pleasure by going a-bird-nesting, and of cutting\n  switches for themselves from the osier-beds, maugre the laws of\n  the realm. Moreover, they list not to learn naught, wherefore the\n  Papal Nuncio (called of the commonalty, M. le Cure) threateneth\n  them with excommunication, since that they neglect the sacred\n  canons of grammatical construction for the construction of other\n  canon, deadly engines made of the stems of elder.",
        " “Farewell, dear brother, never did letter carry so many wishes for\n  your success, so much love fully satisfied. You will have a great\n  deal to tell us when you come home! You will tell me everything,\n  won’t you? I am the oldest. From something the aunt let fall, we\n  think you must have had some success.",
        " “Something was said of a lady, but nothing more was said . . .",
        " “Of course not, in our family! Oh, by-the-by, Eugene, would you\n  rather that we made that piece of cambric into shirts for you\n  instead of pocket-handkerchiefs? If you want some really nice\n  shirts at once, we ought to lose no time in beginning upon them;\n  and if the fashion is different now in Paris, send us one for a\n  pattern; we want more particularly to know about the cuffs. Good-\n  bye! Good-bye! Take my kiss on the left side of your forehead, on\n  the temple that belongs to me, and to no one else in the world. I\n  am leaving the other side of the sheet for Agathe, who has\n  solemnly promised not to read a word that I have written; but, all\n  the same, I mean to sit by her side while she writes, so as to be\n  quite sure that she keeps her word.–Your loving sister,",
        "“Laure De Rastignac.”",
        "“Yes!” said Eugene to himself. “Yes! Success at all costs now! Riches\ncould not repay such devotion as this. I wish I could give them every\nsort of happiness! Fifteen hundred and fifty francs,” he went on after\na pause. “Every shot must go to the mark! Laure is right. Trust a\nwoman! I have only calico shirts. Where some one else’s welfare is\nconcerned, a young girl becomes as ingenious as a thief. Guileless\nwhere she herself is in question, and full of foresight for me,–she\nis like a heavenly angel forgiving the strange incomprehensible sins\nof earth.”",
        "The world lay before him. His tailor had been summoned and sounded,\nand had finally surrendered. When Rastignac met M. de Trailles, he had\nseen at once how great a part the tailor plays in a young man’s\ncareer; a tailor is either a deadly enemy or a staunch friend, with an\ninvoice for a bond of friendship; between these two extremes there is,\nalack! no middle term. In this representative of his craft Eugene\ndiscovered a man who understood that his was a sort of paternal\nfunction for young men at their entrance into life, who regarded\nhimself as a stepping-stone between a young man’s present and future.\nAnd Rastignac in gratitude made the man’s fortune by an epigram of a\nkind in which he excelled at a later period of his life.",
        "“I have twice known a pair of trousers turned out by him make a match\nof twenty thousand livres a year!”",
        "Fifteen hundred francs, and as many suits of clothes as he chose to\norder! At that moment the poor child of the South felt no more doubts\nof any kind. The young man went down to breakfast with the indefinable\nair which the consciousness of the possession of money gives to youth.\nNo sooner are the coins slipped into a student’s pocket than his\nwealth, in imagination at least, is piled into a fantastic column,\nwhich affords him a moral support. He begins to hold up his head as he\nwalks; he is conscious that he has a means of bringing his powers to\nbear on a given point; he looks you straight in the face; his gestures\nare quick and decided; only yesterday he was diffident and shy, any\none might have pushed him aside; to-morrow, he will take the wall of a\nprime minister. A miracle has been wrought in him. Nothing is beyond\nthe reach of his ambition, and his ambition soars at random; he is\nlight-hearted, generous, and enthusiastic; in short, the fledgling\nbird has discovered that he has wings. A poor student snatches at\nevery chance pleasure much as a dog runs all sorts of risks to steal a\nbone, cracking it and sucking the marrow as he flies from pursuit; but\na young man who can rattle a few runaway gold coins in his pocket can\ntake his pleasure deliberately, can taste the whole of the sweets of\nsecure possession; he soars far above earth; he has forgotten what the\nword poverty means; all Paris is his. Those are days when the whole\nworld shines radiant with light, when everything glows and sparkles\nbefore the eyes of youth, days that bring joyous energy that is never\nbrought into harness, days of debts and of painful fears that go hand\nin hand with every delight. Those who do not know the left bank of the\nSeine between the Rue Saint-Jacques and the Rue des Saints-Peres know\nnothing of life.",
        "“Ah! if the women of Paris but knew,” said Rastignac, as he devoured\nMme. Vauquer’s stewed pears (at five for a penny), “they would come\nhere in search of a lover.”",
        "Just then a porter from the Messageries Royales appeared at the door\nof the room; they had previously heard the bell ring as the wicket\nopened to admit him. The man asked for M. Eugene de Rastignac, holding\nout two bags for him to take, and a form of receipt for his signature.\nVautrin’s keen glance cut Eugene like a lash.",
        "“Now you will be able to pay for those fencing lessons and go to the\nshooting gallery,” he said.",
        "“Your ship has come in,” said Mme. Vauquer, eyeing the bags.",
        "Mlle. Michonneau did not dare to look at the money, for fear her eyes\nshould betray her cupidity.",
        "“You have a kind mother,” said Mme. Couture.",
        "“You have a kind mother, sir,” echoed Poiret.",
        "“Yes, mamma has been drained dry,” said Vautrin, “and now you can have\nyour fling, go into society, and fish for heiresses, and dance with\ncountesses who have peach blossom in their hair. But take my advice,\nyoung man, and don’t neglect your pistol practice.”",
        "Vautrin struck an attitude, as if he were facing an antagonist.\nRastignac, meaning to give the porter a tip, felt in his pockets and\nfound nothing. Vautrin flung down a franc piece on the table.",
        "“Your credit is good,” he remarked, eyeing the student, and Rastignac\nwas forced to thank him, though, since the sharp encounter of wits at\ndinner that day, after Eugene came in from calling on Mme. de\nBeauseant, he had made up his mind that Vautrin was insufferable. For\na week, in fact, they had both kept silence in each other’s presence,\nand watched each other. The student tried in vain to account to\nhimself for this attitude.",
        "An idea, of course, gains in force by the energy with which it is\nexpressed; it strikes where the brain sends it, by a law as\nmathematically exact as the law that determines the course of a shell\nfrom a mortar. The amount of impression it makes is not to be\ndetermined so exactly. Sometimes, in an impressible nature, the idea\nworks havoc, but there are, no less, natures so robustly protected,\nthat this sort of projectile falls flat and harmless on skulls of\ntriple brass, as cannon-shot against solid masonry; then there are\nflaccid and spongy-fibred natures into which ideas from without sink\nlike spent bullets into the earthworks of a redoubt. Rastignac’s head\nwas something of the powder-magazine order; the least shock sufficed\nto bring about an explosion. He was too quick, too young, not to be\nreadily accessible to ideas; and open to that subtle influence of\nthought and feeling in others which causes so many strange phenomena\nthat make an impression upon us of which we are all unconscious at the\ntime. Nothing escaped his mental vision; he was lynx-eyed; in him the\nmental powers of perception, which seem like duplicates of the senses,\nhad the mysterious power of swift projection that astonishes us in\nintellects of a high order–slingers who are quick to detect the weak\nspot in any armor.",
        "In the past month Eugene’s good qualities and defects had rapidly\ndeveloped with his character. Intercourse with the world and the\nendeavor to satisfy his growing desires had brought out his defects.\nBut Rastignac came from the South side of the Loire, and had the good\nqualities of his countrymen. He had the impetuous courage of the\nSouth, that rushes to the attack of a difficulty, as well as the\nsouthern impatience of delay or suspense. These traits are held to be\ndefects in the North; they made the fortune of Murat, but they\nlikewise cut short his career. The moral would appear to be that when\nthe dash and boldness of the South side of the Loire meets, in a\nsouthern temperament, with the guile of the North, the character is\ncomplete, and such a man will gain (and keep) the crown of Sweden.",
        "Rastignac, therefore, could not stand the fire from Vautrin’s\nbatteries for long without discovering whether this was a friend or a\nfoe. He felt as if this strange being was reading his inmost soul, and\ndissecting his feelings, while Vautrin himself was so close and\nsecretive that he seemed to have something of the profound and unmoved\nserenity of a sphinx, seeing and hearing all things and saying\nnothing. Eugene, conscious of that money in his pocket, grew\nrebellious.",
        "“Be so good as to wait a moment,” he said to Vautrin, as the latter\nrose, after slowly emptying his coffee-cup, sip by sip.",
        "“What for?” inquired the older man, as he put on his large-brimmed\nhat and took up the sword-cane that he was wont to twirl like a man\nwho will face three or four footpads without flinching.",
        "“I will repay you in a minute,” returned Eugene. He unsealed one of\nthe bags as he spoke, counted out a hundred and forty francs, and\npushed them towards Mme. Vauquer. “Short reckonings make good friends\"\nhe added, turning to the widow; “that clears our accounts till the end\nof the year. Can you give me change for a five-franc piece?”",
        "“Good friends make short reckonings,” echoed Poiret, with a glance at\nVautrin.",
        "“Here is your franc,” said Rastignac, holding out the coin to the\nsphinx in the black wig.",
        "“Any one might think that you were afraid to owe me a trifle,\"\nexclaimed this latter, with a searching glance that seemed to read the\nyoung man’s inmost thoughts; there was a satirical and cynical smile\non Vautrin’s face such as Eugene had seen scores of times already;\nevery time he saw it, it exasperated him almost beyond endurance.",
        "“Well . . . so I am,” he answered. He held both the bags in his hand,\nand had risen to go up to his room.",
        "Vautrin made as if he were going out through the sitting-room, and the\nstudent turned to go through the second door that opened into the\nsquare lobby at the foot of the staircase.",
        "“Do you know, Monsieur le Marquis de Rastignacorama, that what you\nwere saying just now was not exactly polite?” Vautrin remarked, as he\nrattled his sword-cane across the panels of the sitting-room door, and\ncame up to the student.",
        "Rastignac looked coolly at Vautrin, drew him to the foot of the\nstaircase, and shut the dining-room door. They were standing in the\nlittle square lobby between the kitchen and the dining-room; the place\nwas lighted by an iron-barred fanlight above a door that gave access\ninto the garden. Sylvie came out of her kitchen, and Eugene chose that\nmoment to say:",
        "“Monsieur Vautrin, I am not a marquis, and my name is not\nRastignacorama.”",
        "“They will fight,” said Mlle. Michonneau, in an indifferent tone.",
        "“Fight!” echoed Poiret.",
        "“Not they,” replied Mme. Vauquer, lovingly fingering her pile of\ncoins.",
        "“But there they are under the lime-trees,” cried Mlle. Victorine, who\nhad risen so that she might see out into the garden. “Poor young man!\nhe was in the right, after all.”",
        "“We must go upstairs, my pet,” said Mme. Couture; “it is no business\nof ours.”",
        "At the door, however, Mme. Couture and Victorine found their progress\nbarred by the portly form of Sylvie the cook.",
        "“What ever can have happened?” she said. “M. Vautrin said to M.\nEugene, ’Let us have an explanation!’ then he took him by the arm, and\nthere they are, out among the artichokes.”",
        "Vautrin came in while she was speaking. “Mamma Vauquer,” he said\nsmiling, “don’t frighten yourself at all. I am only going to try my\npistols under the lime-trees.”",
        "“Oh! monsieur,” cried Victorine, clasping her hands as she spoke, “why\ndo you want to kill M. Eugene?”",
        "Vautrin stepped back a pace or two, and gazed at Victorine.",
        "“Oh! this is something fresh!” he exclaimed in a bantering tone, that\nbrought the color into the poor girl’s face. “That young fellow yonder\nis very nice, isn’t he?” he went on. “You have given me a notion, my\npretty child; I will make you both happy.”",
        "Mme. Couture laid her hand on the arm of her ward, and drew the girl\naway, as she said in her ear:",
        "“Why, Victorine, I cannot imagine what has come over you this\nmorning.”",
        "“I don’t want any shots fired in my garden,” said Mme. Vauquer. “You\nwill frighten the neighborhood and bring the police up here all in a\nmoment.”",
        "“Come, keep cool, Mamma Vauquer,” answered Vautrin. “There, there;\nit’s all right; we will go to the shooting-gallery.”",
        "He went back to Rastignac, laying his hand familiarly on the young\nman’s arm.",
        "“When I have given you ocular demonstration of the fact that I can put\na bullet through the ace on a card five times running at thirty-five\npaces,” he said, “that won’t take away your appetite, I suppose? You\nlook to me to be inclined to be a trifle quarrelsome this morning, and\nas if you would rush on your death like a blockhead.”",
        "“Do you draw back?” asked Eugene.",
        "“Don’t try to raise my temperature,” answered Vautrin, “it is not cold\nthis morning. Let us go and sit over there,” he added, pointing to the\ngreen-painted garden seats; “no one can overhear us. I want a little\ntalk with you. You are not a bad sort of youngster, and I have no\nquarrel with you. I like you, take Trump–(confound it!)–take\nVautrin’s word for it. What makes me like you? I will tell you\nby-and-by. Meantime, I can tell you that I know you as well as if I\nhad made you myself, as I will prove to you in a minute. Put down your\nbags,” he continued, pointing to the round table.",
        "Rastignac deposited his money on the table, and sat down. He was\nconsumed with curiosity, which the sudden change in the manner of the\nman before him had excited to the highest pitch. Here was a strange\nbeing who, a moment ago, had talked of killing him, and now posed as\nhis protector.",
        "“You would like to know who I really am, what I was, and what I do\nnow,” Vautrin went on. “You want to know too much, youngster. Come!\ncome! keep cool! You will hear more astonishing things than that. I\nhave had my misfortunes. Just hear me out first, and you shall have\nyour turn afterwards. Here is my past in three words. Who am I?\nVautrin. What do I do? Just what I please. Let us change the subject.\nYou want to know my character. I am good-natured to those who do me a\ngood turn, or to those whose hearts speak to mine. These last may do\nanything they like with me; they may bruise my shins, and I shall not\ntell them to ’mind what they are about’; but, nom d’une pipe, the\ndevil himself is not an uglier customer than I can be if people annoy\nme, or if I don’t happen to take to them; and you may just as well\nknow at once that I think no more of killing a man than of that,” and\nhe spat before him as he spoke. “Only when it is absolutely necessary\nto do so, I do my best to kill him properly. I am what you call an\nartist. I have read Benvenuto Cellini’s Memoirs, such as you see me;\nand, what is more, in Italian: A fine-spirited fellow he was! From him\nI learned to follow the example set us by Providence, who strikes us\ndown at random, and to admire the beautiful whenever and wherever it\nis found. And, setting other questions aside, is it not a glorious\npart to play, when you pit yourself against mankind, and the luck is\non your side? I have thought a good deal about the constitution of\nyour present social Dis-order. A duel is downright childish, my boy!\nutter nonsense and folly! When one of two living men must be got out\nof the way, none but an idiot would leave chance to decide which it is\nto be; and in a duel it is a toss-up–heads or tails–and there you\nare! Now I, for instance, can hit the ace in the middle of a card five\ntimes running, send one bullet after another through the same hole,\nand at thirty-five paces, moreover! With that little accomplishment\nyou might think yourself certain of killing your man, mightn’t you.\nWell, I have fired, at twenty paces, and missed, and the rogue who had\nnever handled a pistol in his life–look here!\"–(he unbuttoned his\nwaistcoat and exposed his chest, covered, like a bear’s back, with a\nshaggy fell; the student gave a startled shudder)–\"he was a raw lad,\nbut he made his mark on me,” the extraordinary man went on, drawing\nRastignac’s fingers over a deep scar on his breast. But that happened\nwhen I myself was a mere boy; I was one-and-twenty then (your age),\nand I had some beliefs left–in a woman’s love, and in a pack of\nrubbish that you will be over head and ears in directly. You and I\nwere to have fought just now, weren’t we? You might have killed me.\nSuppose that I were put under the earth, where would you be? You would\nhave to clear out of this, go to Switzerland, draw on papa’s purse\n–and he has none too much in it as it is. I mean to open your eyes to\nyour real position, that is what I am going to do: but I shall do it\nfrom the point of view of a man who, after studying the world very\nclosely, sees that there are but two alternatives–stupid obedience or\nrevolt. I obey nobody; is that clear? Now, do you know how much you\nwill want at the pace you are going? A million; and promptly, too, or\nthat little head of ours will be swaying to and fro in the drag-nets\nat Saint-Cloud, while we are gone to find out whether or no there is a\nSupreme Being. I will put you in the way of that million.”",
        "He stopped for a moment and looked at Eugene.",
        "“Aha! you do not look so sourly at papa Vautrin now! At the mention of\nthe million you look like a young girl when somebody has said, ’I will\ncome for you this evening!’ and she betakes herself to her toilette as\na cat licks its whiskers over a saucer of milk. All right. Come, now,\nlet us go into the question, young man; all between ourselves, you\nknow. We have a papa and mamma down yonder, a great-aunt, two sisters\n(aged eighteen and seventeen), two young brothers (one fifteen, and\nthe other ten), that is about the roll-call of the crew. The aunt\nbrings up the two sisters; the cure comes and teaches the boys Latin.\nBoiled chestnuts are oftener on the table than white bread. Papa makes\na suit of clothes last a long while; if mamma has a different dress\nwinter and summer, it is about as much as she has; the sisters manage\nas best they can. I know all about it; I have lived in the south.",
        "“That is how things are at home. They send you twelve hundred francs a\nyear, and the whole property only brings in three thousand francs all\ntold. We have a cook and a manservant; papa is a baron, and we must\nkeep up appearances. Then we have our ambitions; we are connected with\nthe Beauseants, and we go afoot through the streets; we want to be\nrich, and we have not a penny; we eat Mme. Vauquer’s messes, and we\nlike grand dinners in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; we sleep on a\ntruckle-bed, and dream of a mansion! I do not blame you for wanting\nthese things. What sort of men do the women run after? Men of\nambition. Men of ambition have stronger frames, their blood is richer\nin iron, their hearts are warmer than those of ordinary men. Women\nfeel that when their power is greatest, they look their best, and that\nthose are their happiest hours; they like power in men, and prefer the\nstrongest even if it is a power that may be their own destruction. I\nam going to make an inventory of your desires in order to put the\nquestion at issue before you. Here it is:–",
        "“We are as hungry as a wolf, and those newly-cut teeth of ours are\nsharp; what are we to do to keep the pot boiling? In the first place,\nwe have the Code to browse upon; it is not amusing, and we are none\nthe wiser for it, but that cannot be helped. So far so good. We mean\nto make an advocate of ourselves with a prospect of one day being made\nPresident of a Court of Assize, when we shall send poor devils, our\nbetters, to the galleys with a T.F.[*] on their shoulders, so that the\nrich may be convinced that they can sleep in peace. There is no fun in\nthat; and you are a long while coming to it; for, to begin with, there\nare two years of nauseous drudgery in Paris, we see all the lollipops\nthat we long for out of our reach. It is tiresome to want things and\nnever to have them. If you were a pallid creature of the mollusk\norder, you would have nothing to fear, but it is different when you\nhave the hot blood of a lion and are ready to get into a score of\nscrapes every day of your life. This is the ghastliest form of torture\nknown in this inferno of God’s making, and you will give in to it. Or\nsuppose that you are a good boy, drink nothing stronger than milk, and\nbemoan your hard lot; you, with your generous nature, will endure\nhardships that would drive a dog mad, and make a start, after long\nwaiting, as deputy to some rascal or other in a hole of a place where\nthe Government will fling you a thousand francs a year like the scraps\nthat are thrown to the butcher’s dog. Bark at thieves, plead the cause\nof the rich, send men of heart to the guillotine, that is your work!\nMany thanks! If you have no influence, you may rot in your provincial\ntribunal. At thirty you will be a Justice with twelve hundred francs a\nyear (if you have not flung off the gown for good before then). By the\ntime you are forty you may look to marry a miller’s daughter, an\nheiress with some six thousand livres a year. Much obliged! If you\nhave influence, you may possibly be a Public Prosecutor by the time\nyou are thirty; with a salary of a thousand crowns, you could look to\nmarry the mayor’s daughter. Some petty piece of political trickery,\nsuch as mistaking Villele for Manuel in a bulletin (the names rhyme,\nand that quiets your conscience), and you will probably be a Procureur\nGeneral by the time you are forty, with a chance of becoming a deputy.\nPlease to observe, my dear boy, that our conscience will have been a\nlittle damaged in the process, and that we shall endure twenty years\nof drudgery and hidden poverty, and that our sisters are wearing\nDian’s livery. I have the honor to call your attention to another\nfact: to wit, that there are but twenty Procureurs Generaux at a time\nin all France, while there are some twenty thousand of you young men\nwho aspire to that elevated position; that there are some mountebanks\namong you who would sell their family to screw their fortunes a peg\nhigher. If this sort of thing sickens you, try another course. The\nBaron de Rastignac thinks of becoming an advocate, does he? There’s a\nnice prospect for you! Ten years of drudgery straight away. You are\nobliged to live at the rate of a thousand francs a month; you must\nhave a library of law books, live in chambers, go into society, go\ndown on your knees to ask a solicitor for briefs, lick the dust off\nthe floor of the Palais de Justice. If this kind of business led to\nanything, I should not say no; but just give me the names of five\nadvocates here in Paris who by the time that they are fifty are making\nfifty thousand francs a year! Bah! I would sooner turn pirate on the\nhigh seas than have my soul shrivel up inside me like that. How will\nyou find the capital? There is but one way, marry a woman who has\nmoney. There is no fun in it. Have you a mind to marry? You hang a\nstone around your neck; for if you marry for money, what becomes of\nour exalted notions of honor and so forth? You might as well fly in\nthe face of social conventions at once. Is it nothing to crawl like a\nserpent before your wife, to lick her mother’s feet, to descend to\ndirty actions that would sicken swine–faugh!–never mind if you at\nleast make your fortune. But you will be as doleful as a dripstone if\nyou marry for money. It is better to wrestle with men than to wrangle\nat home with your wife. You are at the crossway of the roads of life,\nmy boy; choose your way.",
        "[*] Travaux forces, forced labour.",
        "“But you have chosen already. You have gone to see your cousin of\nBeauseant, and you have had an inkling of luxury; you have been to\nMme. de Restaud’s house, and in Father Goriot’s daughter you have seen\na glimpse of the Parisienne for the first time. That day you came back\nwith a word written on your forehead. I knew it, I could read\nit–’Success!’ Yes, success at any price. ’Bravo,’ said I to myself,\n’here is the sort of fellow for me.’ You wanted money. Where was it\nall to come from? You have drained your sisters’ little hoard (all\nbrothers sponge more or less on their sisters). Those fifteen hundred\nfrancs of yours (got together, God knows how! in a country where there\nare more chestnuts than five-franc pieces) will slip away like\nsoldiers after pillage. And, then, what will you do? Shall you begin\nto work? Work, or what you understand by work at this moment, means,\nfor a man of Poiret’s calibre, an old age in Mamma Vauquer’s\nlodging-house. There are fifty thousand young men in your position at\nthis moment, all bent as you are on solving one and the same problem\n–how to acquire a fortune rapidly. You are but a unit in that\naggregate. You can guess, therefore, what efforts you must make, how\ndesperate the struggle is. There are not fifty thousand good positions\nfor you; you must fight and devour one another like spiders in a pot.\nDo you know how a man makes his way here? By brilliant genius or by\nskilful corruption. You must either cut your way through these masses\nof men like a cannon ball, or steal among them like a plague. Honesty\nis nothing to the purpose. Men bow before the power of genius; they\nhate it, and try to slander it, because genius does not divide the\nspoil; but if genius persists, they bow before it. To sum it all up in\na phrase, if they fail to smother genius in the mud, they fall on their\nknees and worship it. Corruption is a great power in the world, and\ntalent is scarce. So corruption is the weapon of superfluous\nmediocrity; you will be made to feel the point of it everywhere. You\nwill see women who spend more than ten thousand francs a year on\ndress, while their husband’s salary (his whole income) is six thousand\nfrancs. You will see officials buying estates on twelve thousand\nfrancs a year. You will see women who sell themselves body and soul to\ndrive in a carriage belonging to the son of a peer of France, who has\na right to drive in the middle rank at Longchamp. You have seen that\npoor simpleton of a Goriot obliged to meet a bill with his daughter’s\nname at the back of it, though her husband has fifty thousand francs a\nyear. I defy you to walk a couple of yards anywhere in Paris without\nstumbling on some infernal complication. I’ll bet my head to a head of\nthat salad that you will stir up a hornet’s nest by taking a fancy to\nthe first young, rich, and pretty woman you meet. They are all dodging\nthe law, all at loggerheads with their husbands. If I were to begin to\ntell you all that vanity or necessity (virtue is not often mixed up in\nit, you may be sure), all that vanity and necessity drive them to do\nfor lovers, finery, housekeeping, or children, I should never come to\nan end. So an honest man is the common enemy.",
        "“But do you know what an honest man is? Here, in Paris, an honest man\nis the man who keeps his own counsel, and will not divide the plunder.\nI am not speaking now of those poor bond-slaves who do the work of the\nworld without a reward for their toil–God Almighty’s outcasts, I call\nthem. Among them, I grant you, is virtue in all the flower of its\nstupidity, but poverty is no less their portion. At this moment, I\nthink I see the long faces those good folk would pull if God played a\npractical joke on them and stayed away at the Last Judgment.",
        "“Well, then, if you mean to make a fortune quickly, you must either be\nrich to begin with, or make people believe that you are rich. It is no\nuse playing here except for high stakes; once take to low play, it is\nall up with you. If in the scores of professions that are open to you,\nthere are ten men who rise very rapidly, people are sure to call them\nthieves. You can draw your own conclusions. Such is life. It is no\ncleaner than a kitchen; it reeks like a kitchen; and if you mean to\ncook your dinner, you must expect to soil your hands; the real art is\nin getting them clean again, and therein lies the whole morality of\nour epoch. If I take this tone in speaking of the world to you, I have\nthe right to do so; I know it well. Do you think that I am blaming it?\nFar from it; the world has always been as it is now. Moralists’\nstrictures will never change it. Mankind are not perfect, but one age\nis more or less hypocritical than another, and then simpletons say\nthat its morality is high or low. I do not think that the rich are any\nworse than the poor; man is much the same, high or low, or wherever he\nis. In a million of these human cattle there may be half a score of\nbold spirits who rise above the rest, above the laws; I am one of\nthem. And you, if you are cleverer than your fellows, make straight to\nyour end, and hold your head high. But you must lay your account with\nenvy and slander and mediocrity, and every man’s hand will be against\nyou. Napoleon met with a Minister of War, Aubry by name, who all but\nsent him to the colonies.",
        "“Feel your pulse. Think whether you can get up morning after morning,\nstrengthened in yesterday’s purpose. In that case I will make you an\noffer that no one would decline. Listen attentively. You see, I have\nan idea of my own. My idea is to live a patriarchal life on a vast\nestate, say a hundred thousand acres, somewhere in the Southern States\nof America. I mean to be a planter, to have slaves, to make a few snug\nmillions by selling my cattle, timber, and tobacco; I want to live an\nabsolute monarch, and to do just as I please; to lead such a life as\nno one here in these squalid dens of lath and plaster ever imagines. I\nam a great poet; I do not write my poems, I feel them, and act them.\nAt this moment I have fifty thousand francs, which might possibly buy\nforty negroes. I want two hundred thousand francs, because I want to\nhave two hundred negroes to carry out my notions of the patriarachal\nlife properly. Negroes, you see, are like a sort of family ready\ngrown, and there are no inquisitive public prosecutors out there to\ninterfere with you. That investment in ebony ought to mean three or\nfour million francs in ten years’ time. If I am successful, no one\nwill ask me who I am. I shall be Mr. Four Millions, an American\ncitizen. I shall be fifty years old by then, and sound and hearty\nstill; I shall enjoy life after my own fashion. In two words, if I\nfind you an heiress with a million, will you give me two hundred\nthousand francs? Twenty per cent commission, eh? Is that too much?\nYour little wife will be very much in love with you. Once married, you\nwill show signs of uneasiness and remorse; for a couple of weeks you\nwill be depressed. Then, some night after sundry grimacings, comes the\nconfession, between two kisses, ’Two hundred thousand francs of debts,\nmy darling!’ This sort of farce is played every day in Paris, and by\nyoung men of the highest fashion. When a young wife has given her\nheart, she will not refuse her purse. Perhaps you are thinking that\nyou will lose the money for good? Not you. You will make two hundred\nthousand francs again by some stroke of business. With your capital\nand your brains you should be able to accumulate as large a fortune as\nyou could wish. Ergo, in six months you will have made your own\nfortune, and our old friend Vautrin’s, and made an amiable woman very\nhappy, to say nothing of your people at home, who must blow on their\nfingers to warm them, in the winter, for lack of firewood. You need\nnot be surprised at my proposal, nor at the demand I make. Forty-seven\nout of every sixty great matches here in Paris are made after just\nsuch a bargain as this. The Chamber of Notaries compels my gentleman\nto––”",
        "“What must I do?” said Rastignac, eagerly interrupting Vautrin’s\nspeech.",
        "“Next to nothing,” returned the other, with a slight involuntary\nmovement, the suppressed exultation of the angler when he feels a bite\nat the end of his line. “Follow me carefully! The heart of a girl\nwhose life is wretched and unhappy is a sponge that will thirstily\nabsorb love; a dry sponge that swells at the first drop of sentiment.\nIf you pay court to a young girl whose existence is a compound of\nloneliness, despair, and poverty, and who has no suspicion that she\nwill come into a fortune, good Lord! it is quint and quatorze at\npiquet; it is knowing the numbers of the lottery before-hand; it is\nspeculating in the funds when you have news from a sure source; it is\nbuilding up a marriage on an indestructible foundation. The girl may\ncome in for millions, and she will fling them, as if they were so many\npebbles, at your feet. ’Take it, my beloved! Take it, Alfred, Adolphe,\nEugene!’ or whoever it was that showed his sense by sacrificing\nhimself for her. And as for sacrificing himself, this is how I\nunderstand it. You sell a coat that is getting shabby, so that you can\ntake her to the Cadran bleu, treat her to mushrooms on toast, and\nthen go to the Ambigu-Comique in the evening; you pawn your watch to\nbuy her a shawl. I need not remind you of the fiddle-faddle\nsentimentality that goes down so well with all women; you spill a few\ndrops of water on your stationery, for instance; those are the tears\nyou shed while far away from her. You look to me as if you were\nperfectly acquainted with the argot of the heart. Paris, you see, is\nlike a forest in the New World, where you have to deal with a score of\nvarieties of savages–Illinois and Hurons, who live on the proceed of\ntheir social hunting. You are a hunter of millions; you set your\nsnares; you use lures and nets; there are many ways of hunting. Some\nhunt heiresses, others a legacy; some fish for souls, yet others sell\ntheir clients, bound hand and foot. Every one who comes back from the\nchase with his game-bag well filled meets with a warm welcome in good\nsociety. In justice to this hospitable part of the world, it must be\nsaid that you have to do with the most easy and good-natured of great\ncities. If the proud aristocracies of the rest of Europe refuse\nadmittance among their ranks to a disreputable millionaire, Paris\nstretches out a hand to him, goes to his banquets, eats his dinners,\nand hobnobs with his infamy.”",
        "“But where is such a girl to be found?” asked Eugene.",
        "“Under your eyes; she is yours already.”",
        "“Mlle. Victorine?”",
        "“Precisely.”",
        "“And what was that you said?”",
        "“She is in love with you already, your little Baronne de Rastignac!”",
        "“She has not a penny,” Eugene continued, much mystified.",
        "“Ah! now we are coming to it! Just another word or two, and it will\nall be clear enough. Her father, Taillefer, is an old scoundrel; it is\nsaid that he murdered one of his friends at the time of the\nRevolution. He is one of your comedians that sets up to have opinions\nof his own. He is a banker–senior partner in the house of Frederic\nTaillefer and Company. He has one son, and means to leave all he has\nto the boy, to the prejudice of Victorine. For my part, I don’t like\nto see injustice of this sort. I am like Don Quixote, I have a fancy\nfor defending the weak against the strong. If it should please God to\ntake that youth away from him, Taillefer would have only his daughter\nleft; he would want to leave his money to some one or other; an absurd\nnotion, but it is only human nature, and he is not likely to have any\nmore children, as I know. Victorine is gentle and amiable; she will\nsoon twist her father round her fingers, and set his head spinning\nlike a German top by plying him with sentiment! She will be too much\ntouched by your devotion to forget you; you will marry her. I mean to\nplay Providence for you, and Providence is to do my will. I have a\nfriend whom I have attached closely to myself, a colonel in the Army\nof the Loire, who has just been transferred into the garde royale. He\nhas taken my advice and turned ultra-royalist; he is not one of those\nfools who never change their opinions. Of all pieces of advice, my\ncherub, I would give you this–don’t stick to your opinions any more\nthan to your words. If any one asks you for them, let him have them\n–at a price. A man who prides himself on going in a straight line\nthrough life is an idiot who believes in infallibility. There are no\nsuch things as principles; there are only events, and there are no\nlaws but those of expediency: a man of talent accepts events and the\ncircumstances in which he finds himself, and turns everything to his\nown ends. If laws and principles were fixed and invariable, nations\nwould not change them as readily as we change our shirts. The\nindividual is not obliged to be more particular than the nation. A man\nwhose services to France have been of the very slightest is a fetich\nlooked on with superstitious awe because he has always seen everything\nin red; but he is good, at the most, to be put into the Museum of Arts\nand Crafts, among the automatic machines, and labeled La Fayette;\nwhile the prince at whom everybody flings a stone, the man who\ndespises humanity so much that he spits as many oaths as he is asked\nfor in the face of humanity, saved France from being torn in pieces at\nthe Congress of Vienna; and they who should have given him laurels\nfling mud at him. Oh! I know something of affairs, I can tell you; I\nhave the secrets of many men! Enough. When I find three minds in\nagreement as to the application of a principle, I shall have a fixed\nand immovable opinion–I shall have to wait a long while first. In the\nTribunals you will not find three judges of the same opinion on a\nsingle point of law. To return to the man I was telling you of. He\nwould crucify Jesus Christ again, if I bade him. At a word from his\nold chum Vautrin he will pick a quarrel with a scamp that will not\nsend so much as five francs to his sister, poor girl, and” (here\nVautrin rose to his feet and stood like a fencing-master about to\nlunge)–\"turn him off into the dark!” he added.",
        "“How frightful!” said Eugene. “You do not really mean it? M. Vautrin,\nyou are joking!”",
        "“There! there! Keep cool!” said the other. “Don’t behave like a baby.\nBut if you find any amusement in it, be indignant, flare up! Say that\nI am a scoundrel, a rascal, a rogue, a bandit; but do not call me a\nblackleg nor a spy! There, out with it, fire away! I forgive you; it\nis quite natural at your age. I was like that myself once. Only\nremember this, you will do worse things yourself some day. You will\nflirt with some pretty woman and take her money. You have thought of\nthat, of course,” said Vautrin, “for how are you to succeed unless\nlove is laid under contribution? There are no two ways about virtue,\nmy dear student; it either is, or it is not. Talk of doing penance for\nyour sins! It is a nice system of business, when you pay for your\ncrime by an act of contrition! You seduce a woman that you may set\nyour foot on such and such a rung of the social ladder; you sow\ndissension among the children of a family; you descend, in short, to\nevery base action that can be committed at home or abroad, to gain\nyour own ends for your own pleasure or your profit; and can you\nimagine that these are acts of faith, hope, or charity? How is it that\na dandy, who in a night has robbed a boy of half his fortune, gets\nonly a couple of months in prison; while a poor devil who steals a\nbanknote for a thousand francs, with aggravating circumstances, is\ncondemned to penal servitude? Those are your laws. Not a single\nprovision but lands you in some absurdity. That man with yellow gloves\nand a golden tongue commits many a murder; he sheds no blood, but he\ndrains his victim’s veins as surely; a desperado forces open a door\nwith a crowbar, dark deeds both of them! You yourself will do every\none of those things that I suggest to you to-day, bar the bloodshed.\nDo you believe that there is any absolute standard in this world?\nDespise mankind and find out the meshes that you can slip through in\nthe net of the Code. The secret of a great success for which you are\nat a loss to account is a crime that has never been found out, because\nit was properly executed.”",
        "“Silence, sir! I will not hear any more; you make me doubt myself. At\nthis moment my sentiments are all my science.”",
        "“Just as you please, my fine fellow; I did think you were so\nweak-minded,” said Vautrin, “I shall say no more about it. One last\nword, however,” and he looked hard at the student–\"you have my\nsecret,” he said.",
        "“A young man who refuses your offer knows that he must forget it.”",
        "“Quite right, quite right; I am glad to hear you say so. Somebody else\nmight not be so scrupulous, you see. Keep in mind what I want to do\nfor you. I will give you a fortnight. The offer is still open.”",
        "“What a head of iron the man has!” said Eugene to himself, as he\nwatched Vautrin walk unconcernedly away with his cane under his arm.\n\"Yet Mme. de Beauseant said as much more gracefully; he has only\nstated the case in cruder language. He would tear my heart with claws\nof steel. What made me think of going to Mme. de Nucingen? He guessed\nmy motives before I knew them myself. To sum it up, that outlaw has\ntold me more about virtue than all I have learned from men and books.\nIf virtue admits of no compromises, I have certainly robbed my\nsisters,” he said, throwing down the bags on the table.",
        "He sat down again and fell, unconscious of his surroundings, into deep\nthought.",
        "“To be faithful to an ideal of virtue! A heroic martyrdom! Pshaw!\nevery one believes in virtue, but who is virtuous? Nations have made\nan idol of Liberty, but what nation on the face of the earth is free?\nMy youth is still like a blue and cloudless sky. If I set myself to\nobtain wealth or power, does it mean that I must make up my mind to\nlie, and fawn, and cringe, and swagger, and flatter, and dissemble? To\nconsent to be the servant of others who have likewise fawned, and\nlied, and flattered? Must I cringe to them before I can hope to be\ntheir accomplice? Well, then, I decline. I mean to work nobly and with\na single heart. I will work day and night; I will owe my fortune to\nnothing but my own exertions. It may be the slowest of all roads to\nsuccess, but I shall lay my head on the pillow at night untroubled by\nevil thoughts. Is there a greater thing than this–to look back over\nyour life and know that it is stainless as a lily? I and my life are\nlike a young man and his betrothed. Vautrin has put before me all that\ncomes after ten years of marriage. The devil! my head is swimming. I\ndo not want to think at all; the heart is a sure guide.”",
        "Eugene was roused from his musings by the voice of the stout Sylvie,\nwho announced that the tailor had come, and Eugene therefore made his\nappearance before the man with the two money bags, and was not ill\npleased that it should be so. When he had tried on his dress suit, he\nput on his new morning costume, which completely metamorphosed him.",
        "“I am quite equal to M. de Trailles,” he said to himself. “In short, I\nlook like a gentleman.”",
        "“You asked me, sir, if I knew the houses where Mme. de Nucingen goes,\"\nFather Goriot’s voice spoke from the doorway of Eugene’s room.”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Very well then, she is going to the Marechale Carigliano’s ball on\nMonday. If you can manage to be there, I shall hear from you whether\nmy two girls enjoyed themselves, and how they were dressed, and all\nabout it in fact.”",
        "“How did you find that out, my good Goriot?” said Eugene, putting a\nchair by the fire for his visitor.",
        "“Her maid told me. I hear all about their doings from Therese and\nConstance,” he added gleefully.",
        "The old man looked like a lover who is still young enough to be made\nhappy by the discovery of some little stratagem which brings him\ninformation of his lady-love without her knowledge.",
        "“You will see them both!” he said, giving artless expression to a pang\nof jealousy.",
        "“I do not know,” answered Eugene. “I will go to Mme. de Beauseant and\nask her for an introduction to the Marechale.”",
        "Eugene felt a thrill of pleasure at the thought of appearing before\nthe Vicomtesse, dressed as henceforward he always meant to be. The\n\"abysses of the human heart,” in the moralists’ phrase, are only\ninsidious thoughts, involuntary promptings of personal interest. The\ninstinct of enjoyment turns the scale; those rapid changes of purpose\nwhich have furnished the text for so much rhetoric are calculations\nprompted by the hope of pleasure. Rastignac beholding himself well\ndressed and impeccable as to gloves and boots, forgot his virtuous\nresolutions. Youth, moreover, when bent upon wrongdoing does not dare\nto behold himself in the mirror of consciousness; mature age has seen\nitself; and therein lies the whole difference between these two phases\nof life.",
        "A friendship between Eugene and his neighbor, Father Goriot, had been\ngrowing up for several days past. This secret friendship and the\nantipathy that the student had begun to entertain for Vautrin arose\nfrom the same psychological causes. The bold philosopher who shall\ninvestigate the effects of mental action upon the physical world will\ndoubtless find more than one proof of the material nature of our\nsentiments in other animals. What physiognomist is as quick to discern\ncharacter as a dog is to discover from a stranger’s face whether this\nis a friend or no? Those by-words–\"atoms,” “affinities\"–are facts\nsurviving in modern languages for the confusion of philosophic\nwiseacres who amuse themselves by winnowing the chaff of language to\nfind its grammatical roots. We feel that we are loved. Our\nsentiments make themselves felt in everything, even at a great\ndistance. A letter is a living soul, and so faithful an echo of the\nvoice that speaks in it, that finer natures look upon a letter as one\nof love’s most precious treasures. Father Goriot’s affection was of\nthe instinctive order, a canine affection raised to a sublime pitch;\nhe had scented compassion in the air, and the kindly respect and\nyouthful sympathy in the student’s heart. This friendship had,\nhowever, scarcely reached the stage at which confidences are made.\nThough Eugene had spoken of his wish to meet Mme. de Nucingen, it was\nnot because he counted on the old man to introduce him to her house,\nfor he hoped that his own audacity might stand him in good stead. All\nthat Father Goriot had said as yet about his daughters had referred to\nthe remarks that the student had made so freely in public on that day\nof the two visits.",
        "“How could you think that Mme. de Restaud bore you a grudge for\nmentioning my name?” he had said on the day following that scene at\ndinner. “My daughters are very fond of me; I am a happy father; but my\nsons-in-law have behaved badly to me, and rather than make trouble\nbetween my darlings and their husbands, I choose to see my daughters\nsecretly. Fathers who can see their daughters at any time have no idea\nof all the pleasure that all this mystery gives me; I cannot always\nsee mine when I wish, do you understand? So when it is fine I walk out\nin the Champs-Elysees, after finding out from their waiting-maids\nwhether my daughters mean to go out. I wait near the entrance; my\nheart beats fast when the carriages begin to come; I admire them in\ntheir dresses, and as they pass they give me a little smile, and it\nseems as if everything was lighted up for me by a ray of bright\nsunlight. I wait, for they always go back the same way, and then I see\nthem again; the fresh air has done them good and brought color into\ntheir cheeks; all about me people say, ’What a beautiful woman that\nis!’ and it does my heart good to hear them.",
        "“Are they not my own flesh and blood? I love the very horses that draw\nthem; I envy the little lap-dog on their knees. Their happiness is my\nlife. Every one loves after his own fashion, and mine does no one any\nharm; why should people trouble their heads about me? I am happy in my\nown way. Is there any law against going to see my girls in the evening\nwhen they are going out to a ball? And what a disappointment it is\nwhen I get there too late, and am told that ’Madame has gone out!’\nOnce I waited till three o’clock in the morning for Nasie; I had not\nseen her for two whole days. I was so pleased, that it was almost too\nmuch for me! Please do not speak of me unless it is to say how good my\ndaughters are to me. They are always wanting to heap presents upon me,\nbut I will not have it. ’Just keep your money,’ I tell them. ’What\nshould I do with it? I want nothing.’ And what am I, sir, after all?\nAn old carcase, whose soul is always where my daughters are. When you\nhave seen Mme. de Nucingen, tell me which you like the most,” said the\nold man after a moment’s pause, while Eugene put the last touches to\nhis toilette. The student was about to go out to walk in the Garden of\nthe Tuileries until the hour when he could venture to appear in Mme.\nde Beauseant’s drawing-room.",
        "That walk was a turning-point in Eugene’s career. Several women\nnoticed him; he looked so handsome, so young, and so well dressed.\nThis almost admiring attention gave a new turn to his thoughts. He\nforgot his sisters and the aunt who had robbed herself for him; he no\nlonger remembered his own virtuous scruples. He had seen hovering\nabove his head the fiend so easy to mistake for an angel, the Devil\nwith rainbow wings, who scatters rubies, and aims his golden shafts at\npalace fronts, who invests women with purple, and thrones with a glory\nthat dazzles the eyes of fools till they forget the simple origins of\nroyal dominion; he had heard the rustle of that Vanity whose tinsel\nseems to us to be the symbol of power. However cynical Vautrin’s words\nhad been, they had made an impression on his mind, as the sordid\nfeatures of the old crone who whispers, “A lover, and gold in\ntorrents,” remain engraven on a young girl’s memory.",
        "Eugene lounged about the walks till it was nearly five o’clock, then\nhe went to Mme. de Beauseant, and received one of the terrible blows\nagainst which young hearts are defenceless. Hitherto the Vicomtesse\nhad received him with the kindly urbanity, the bland grace of manner\nthat is the result of fine breeding, but is only complete when it\ncomes from the heart.",
        "To-day Mme. de Beauseant bowed constrainedly, and spoke curtly:",
        "“M. de Rastignac, I cannot possibly see you, at least not at this\nmoment. I am engaged . . .”",
        "An observer, and Rastignac instantly became an observer, could read\nthe whole history, the character and customs of caste, in the phrase,\nin the tones of her voice, in her glance and bearing. He caught a\nglimpse of the iron hand beneath the velvet glove–the personality,\nthe egoism beneath the manner, the wood beneath the varnish. In short,\nhe heard that unmistakable I THE KING that issues from the plumed\ncanopy of the throne, and finds its last echo under the crest of the\nsimplest gentleman.",
        "Eugene had trusted too implicitly to the generosity of a woman; he\ncould not believe in her haughtiness. Like all the unfortunate, he had\nsubscribed, in all good faith, the generous compact which should bind\nthe benefactor to the recipient, and the first article in that bond,\nbetween two large-hearted natures, is a perfect equality. The kindness\nwhich knits two souls together is as rare, as divine, and as little\nunderstood as the passion of love, for both love and kindness are the\nlavish generosity of noble natures. Rastignac was set upon going to\nthe Duchesse de Carigliano’s ball, so he swallowed down this rebuff.",
        "“Madame,” he faltered out, “I would not have come to trouble you about\na trifling matter; be so kind as to permit me to see you later, I can\nwait.”",
        "“Very well, come and dine with me,” she said, a little confused by the\nharsh way in which she had spoken, for this lady was as genuinely\nkind-hearted as she was high-born.",
        "Eugene was touched by this sudden relenting, but none the less he said\nto himself as he went away, “Crawl in the dust, put up with every kind\nof treatment. What must the rest of the world be like when one of the\nkindest of women forgets all her promises of befriending me in a\nmoment, and tosses me aside like an old shoe? So it is every one for\nhimself? It is true that her house is not a shop, and I have put\nmyself in the wrong by needing her help. You should cut your way\nthrough the world like a cannon ball, as Vautrin said.”",
        "But the student’s bitter thoughts were soon dissipated by the pleasure\nwhich he promised himself in this dinner with the Vicomtesse. Fate\nseemed to determine that the smallest accidents in his life should\ncombine to urge him into a career, which the terrible sphinx of the\nMaison Vauquer had described as a field of battle where you must\neither slay or be slain, and cheat to avoid being cheated. You leave\nyour conscience and your heart at the barriers, and wear a mask on\nentering into this game of grim earnest, where, as in ancient Sparta,\nyou must snatch your prize without being detected if you would deserve\nthe crown.",
        "On his return he found the Vicomtesse gracious and kindly, as she had\nalways been to him. They went together to the dining-room, where the\nVicomte was waiting for his wife. In the time of the Restoration the\nluxury of the table was carried, as is well known, to the highest\ndegree, and M. de Beauseant, like many jaded men of the world, had few\npleasures left but those of good cheer; in this matter, in fact, he\nwas a gourmand of the schools of Louis XVIII. and of the Duc d’Escars,\nand luxury was supplemented by splendor. Eugene, dining for the first\ntime in a house where the traditions of grandeur had descended through\nmany generations, had never seen any spectacle like this that now met\nhis eyes. In the time of the Empire, balls had always ended with a\nsupper, because the officers who took part in them must be fortified\nfor immediate service, and even in Paris might be called upon to leave\nthe ballroom for the battlefield. This arrangement had gone out of\nfashion under the Monarchy, and Eugene had so far only been asked to\ndances. The self-possession which pre-eminently distinguished him in\nlater life already stood him in good stead, and he did not betray his\namazement. Yet as he saw for the first time the finely wrought silver\nplate, the completeness of every detail, the sumptuous dinner,\nnoiselessly served, it was difficult for such an ardent imagination\nnot to prefer this life of studied and refined luxury to the hardships\nof the life which he had chosen only that morning.",
        "His thoughts went back for a moment to the lodging-house, and with a\nfeeling of profound loathing, he vowed to himself that at New Year he\nwould go; prompted at least as much by a desire to live among cleaner\nsurroundings as by a wish to shake off Vautrin, whose huge hand he\nseemed to feel on his shoulder at that moment. When you consider the\nnumberless forms, clamorous or mute, that corruption takes in Paris,\ncommon-sense begins to wonder what mental aberration prompted the\nState to establish great colleges and schools there, and assemble\nyoung men in the capital; how it is that pretty women are respected,\nor that the gold coin displayed in the money-changer’s wooden saucers\ndoes not take to itself wings in the twinkling of an eye; and when you\ncome to think further, how comparatively few cases of crime there are,\nand to count up the misdemeanors committed by youth, is there not a\ncertain amount of respect due to these patient Tantaluses who wrestle\nwith themselves and nearly always come off victorious? The struggles\nof the poor student in Paris, if skilfully drawn, would furnish a most\ndramatic picture of modern civilization.",
        "In vain Mme. de Beauseant looked at Eugene as if asking him to speak;\nthe student was tongue-tied in the Vicomte’s presence.",
        "“Are you going to take me to the Italiens this evening?” the\nVicomtesse asked her husband.",
        "“You cannot doubt that I should obey you with pleasure,” he answered,\nand there was a sarcastic tinge in his politeness which Eugene did not\ndetect, “but I ought to go to meet some one at the Varietes.”",
        "“His mistress,” said she to herself.",
        "“Then, is not Ajuda coming for you this evening?” inquired the\nVicomte.",
        "“No,” she answered, petulantly.",
        "“Very well, then, if you really must have an arm, take that of M. de\nRastignac.”",
        "The Vicomtess turned to Eugene with a smile.",
        "“That would be a very compromising step for you,” she said.",
        "“’A Frenchman loves danger, because in danger there is glory,’ to\nquote M. de Chateaubriand,” said Rastignac, with a bow.",
        "A few moments later he was sitting beside Mme. de Beauseant in a\nbrougham, that whirled them through the streets of Paris to a\nfashionable theatre. It seemed to him that some fairy magic had\nsuddenly transported him into a box facing the stage. All the\nlorgnettes of the house were pointed at him as he entered, and at the\nVicomtesse in her charming toilette. He went from enchantment to\nenchantment.",
        "“You must talk to me, you know,” said Mme. de Beauseant. “Ah! look!\nThere is Mme. de Nucingen in the third box from ours. Her sister and\nM. de Trailles are on the other side.”",
        "The Vicomtesse glanced as she spoke at the box where Mlle. de\nRochefide should have been; M. d’Ajuda was not there, and Mme. de\nBeauseant’s face lighted up in a marvelous way.",
        "“She is charming,” said Eugene, after looking at Mme. de Nucingen.",
        "“She has white eyelashes.”",
        "“Yes, but she has such a pretty slender figure!”",
        "“Her hands are large.”",
        "“Such beautiful eyes!”",
        "“Her face is long.”",
        "“Yes, but length gives distinction.”",
        "“It is lucky for her that she has some distinction in her face. Just\nsee how she fidgets with her opera-glass! The Goriot blood shows\nitself in every movement,” said the Vicomtesse, much to Eugene’s\nastonishment.",
        "Indeed, Mme. de Beauseant seemed to be engaged in making a survey of\nthe house, and to be unconscious of Mme. Nucingen’s existence; but no\nmovement made by the latter was lost upon the Vicomtesse. The house\nwas full of the loveliest women in Paris, so that Delphine de Nucingen\nwas not a little flattered to receive the undivided attention of Mme.\nde Beauseant’s young, handsome, and well-dressed cousin, who seemed to\nhave no eyes for any one else.",
        "“If you look at her so persistently, you will make people talk, M. de\nRastignac. You will never succeed if you fling yourself at any one’s\nhead like that.”",
        "“My dear cousin,” said Eugene, “you have protected me indeed so far,\nand now if you would complete your work, I only ask of you a favor\nwhich will cost you but little, and be of very great service to me. I\nhave lost my heart.”",
        "“Already!”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“And to that woman!”",
        "“How could I aspire to find any one else to listen to me?” he asked,\nwith a keen glance at his cousin. “Her Grace the Duchesse de\nCarigliano is a friend of the Duchesse de Berri,” he went on, after a\npause; “you are sure to see her, will you be so kind as to present me\nto her, and to take me to her ball on Monday? I shall meet Mme. de\nNucingen there, and enter into my first skirmish.”",
        "“Willingly,” she said. “If you have a liking for her already, your\naffairs of the heart are like to prosper. That is de Marsay over there\nin the Princesse Galathionne’s box. Mme. de Nucingen is racked with\njealousy. There is no better time for approaching a woman, especially\nif she happens to be a banker’s wife. All those ladies of the\nChaussee-d’Antin love revenge.”",
        "“Then, what would you do yourself in such a case?”",
        "“I should suffer in silence.”",
        "At this point the Marquis d’Ajuda appeared in Mme. de Beauseant’s box.",
        "“I have made a muddle of my affairs to come to you,” he said, “and I\nam telling you about it, so that it may not be a sacrifice.”",
        "Eugene saw the glow of joy on the Vicomtesse’s face, and knew that\nthis was love, and learned the difference between love and the\naffectations of Parisian coquetry. He admired his cousin, grew mute,\nand yielded his place to M. d’Ajuda with a sigh.",
        "“How noble, how sublime a woman is when she loves like that!” he said\nto himself. “And he could forsake her for a doll! Oh! how could any\none forsake her?”",
        "There was a boy’s passionate indignation in his heart. He could have\nflung himself at Mme. de Beauseant’s feet; he longed for the power of\nthe devil if he could snatch her away and hide her in his heart, as an\neagle snatches up some white yeanling from the plains and bears it to\nits eyrie. It was humiliating to him to think that in all this gallery\nof fair pictures he had not one picture of his own. “To have a\nmistress and an almost royal position is a sign of power,” he said to\nhimself. And he looked at Mme. de Nucingen as a man measures another\nwho has insulted him.",
        "The Vicomtesse turned to him, and the expression of her eyes thanked\nhim a thousand times for his discretion. The first act came to an end\njust then.",
        "“Do you know Mme. de Nucingen well enough to present M. de Rastignac\nto her?” she asked of the Marquis d’Ajuda.",
        "“She will be delighted,” said the Marquis. The handsome Portuguese\nrose as he spoke and took the student’s arm, and in another moment\nEugene found himself in Mme. de Nucingen’s box.",
        "“Madame,” said the Marquis, “I have the honor of presenting to you the\nChevalier Eugene de Rastignac; he is a cousin of Mme. de Beauseant’s.\nYou have made so deep an impression upon him, that I thought I would\nfill up the measure of his happiness by bringing him nearer to his\ndivinity.”",
        "Words spoken half jestingly to cover their somewhat disrespectful\nimport; but such an implication, if carefully disguised, never gives\noffence to a woman. Mme. de Nucingen smiled, and offered Eugene the\nplace which her husband had just left.",
        "“I do not venture to suggest that you should stay with me, monsieur,\"\nshe said. “Those who are so fortunate as to be in Mme. de Beauseant’s\ncompany do not desire to leave it.”",
        "“Madame,” Eugene said, lowering his voice, “I think that to please my\ncousin I should remain with you. Before my lord Marquis came we were\nspeaking of you and of your exceedingly distinguished appearance,” he\nadded aloud.",
        "M. d’Ajuda turned and left them.",
        "“Are you really going to stay with me, monsieur?” asked the Baroness.\n\"Then we shall make each other’s acquaintance. Mme. de Restaud told me\nabout you, and has made me anxious to meet you.”",
        "“She must be very insincere, then, for she has shut her door on me.”",
        "“What?”",
        "“Madame, I will tell you honestly the reason why; but I must crave\nyour indulgence before confiding such a secret to you. I am your\nfather’s neighbor; I had no idea that Mme. de Restaud was his\ndaughter. I was rash enough to mention his name; I meant no harm, but\nI annoyed your sister and her husband very much. You cannot think how\nseverely the Duchesse de Langeais and my cousin blamed this apostasy\non a daughter’s part, as a piece of bad taste. I told them all about\nit, and they both burst out laughing. Then Mme. de Beauseant made some\ncomparison between you and your sister, speaking in high terms of you,\nand saying how very fond you were of my neighbor, M. Goriot. And,\nindeed, how could you help loving him? He adores you so passionately\nthat I am jealous already. We talked about you this morning for two\nhours. So this evening I was quite full of all that your father had\ntold me, and while I was dining with my cousin I said that you could\nnot be as beautiful as affectionate. Mme. de Beauseant meant to\ngratify such warm admiration, I think, when she brought me here,\ntelling me, in her gracious way, that I should see you.”",
        "“Then, even now, I owe you a debt of gratitude, monsieur,” said the\nbanker’s wife. “We shall be quite old friends in a little while.”",
        "“Although a friendship with you could not be like an ordinary\nfriendship,” said Rastignac; “I should never wish to be your friend.”",
        "Such stereotyped phrases as these, in the mouths of beginners, possess\nan unfailing charm for women, and are insipid only when read coldly;\nfor a young man’s tone, glance and attitude give a surpassing\neloquence to the banal phrases. Mme. de Nucingen thought that\nRastignac was adorable. Then, woman-like, being at a loss how to reply\nto the student’s outspoken admiration, she answered a previous remark.",
        "“Yes, it is very wrong of my sister to treat our poor father as she\ndoes,” she said; “he has been a Providence to us. It was not until M.\nde Nucingen positively ordered me only to receive him in the mornings\nthat I yielded the point. But I have been unhappy about it for a long\nwhile; I have shed many tears over it. This violence to my feelings,\nwith my husband’s brutal treatment, have been two causes of my unhappy\nmarried life. There is certainly no woman in Paris whose lot seems\nmore enviable than mine, and yet, in reality, there is not one so much\nto be pitied. You will think I must be out of my senses to talk to you\nlike this; but you know my father, and I cannot regard you as a\nstranger.”",
        "“You will find no one,” said Eugene, “who longs as eagerly as I do to\nbe yours. What do all women seek? Happiness.” (He answered his own\nquestion in low, vibrating tones.) “And if happiness for a woman means\nthat she is to be loved and adored, to have a friend to whom she can\npour out her wishes, her fancies, her sorrows and joys; to whom she\ncan lay bare her heart and soul, and all her fair defects and her\ngracious virtues, without fear of a betrayal; believe me, the devotion\nand the warmth that never fails can only be found in the heart of a\nyoung man who, at a bare sign from you, would go to his death, who\nneither knows nor cares to know anything as yet of the world, because\nyou will be all the world to him. I myself, you see (you will laugh at\nmy simplicity), have just come from a remote country district; I am\nquite new to this world of Paris; I have only known true and loving\nhearts; and I made up my mind that here I should find no love. Then I\nchanced to meet my cousin, and to see my cousin’s heart from very\nnear; I have divined the inexhaustible treasures of passion, and, like\nCherubino, I am the lover of all women, until the day comes when I\nfind the woman to whom I may devote myself. As soon as I saw you, as\nsoon as I came into the theatre this evening, I felt myself borne\ntowards you as if by the current of a stream. I had so often thought\nof you already, but I had never dreamed that you would be so\nbeautiful! Mme. de Beauseant told me that I must not look so much at\nyou. She does not know the charm of your red lips, your fair face, nor\nsee how soft your eyes are. . . . I also am beginning to talk\nnonsense; but let me talk.”",
        "Nothing pleases a woman better than to listen to such whispered words\nas these; the most puritanical among them listens even when she ought\nnot to reply to them; and Rastignac, having once begun, continued to\npour out his story, dropping his voice, that she might lean and\nlisten; and Mme. de Nucingen, smiling, glanced from time to time at de\nMarsay, who still sat in the Princesse Galathionne’s box.",
        "Rastignac did not leave Mme. de Nucingen till her husband came to take\nher home.",
        "“Madame,” Eugene said, “I shall have the pleasure of calling upon you\nbefore the Duchesse de Carigliano’s ball.”",
        "“If Matame infites you to come,” said the Baron, a thickset Alsatian,\nwith indications of a sinister cunning in his full-moon countenance,\n\"you are quide sure of being well receifed.”",
        "“My affairs seem to be in a promising way,” said Eugene to himself.–\"\n’Can you love me?’ I asked her, and she did not resent it. The bit is\nin the horse’s mouth, and I have only to mount and ride;” and with\nthat he went to pay his respects to Mme. de Beauseant, who was leaving\nthe theatre on d’Ajuda’s arm.",
        "The student did not know that the Baroness’ thoughts had been\nwandering; that she was even then expecting a letter from de Marsay,\none of those letters that bring about a rupture that rends the soul;\nso, happy in his delusion, Eugene went with the Vicomtesse to the\nperistyle, where people were waiting till their carriages were\nannounced.",
        "“That cousin of yours is hardly recognizable for the same man,” said\nthe Portuguese laughingly to the Vicomtesse, when Eugene had taken\nleave of them. “He will break the bank. He is as supple as an eel; he\nwill go a long way, of that I am sure. Who else could have picked out\na woman for him, as you did, just when she needed consolation?”",
        "“But it is not certain that she does not still love the faithless\nlover,” said Mme. de Beauseant.",
        "The student meanwhile walked back from the Theatre-Italien to the Rue\nNeuve-Sainte-Genevieve, making the most delightful plans as he went.\nHe had noticed how closely Mme. de Restaud had scrutinized him when he\nsat beside Mme. de Nucingen, and inferred that the Countess’ doors\nwould not be closed in the future. Four important houses were now open\nto him–for he meant to stand well with the Marechale; he had four\nsupporters in the inmost circle of society in Paris. Even now it was\nclear to him that, once involved in this intricate social machinery,\nhe must attach himself to a spoke of the wheel that was to turn and\nraise his fortunes; he would not examine himself too curiously as to\nthe methods, but he was certain of the end, and conscious of the power\nto gain and keep his hold.",
        "“If Mme. de Nucingen takes an interest in me, I will teach her how to\nmanage her husband. That husband of hers is a great speculator; he\nmight put me in the way of making a fortune by a single stroke.”",
        "He did not say this bluntly in so many words; as yet, indeed, he was\nnot sufficient of a diplomatist to sum up a situation, to see its\npossibilities at a glance, and calculate the chances in his favor.\nThese were nothing but hazy ideas that floated over his mental\nhorizon; they were less cynical than Vautrin’s notions; but if they\nhad been tried in the crucible of conscience, no very pure result\nwould have issued from the test. It is by a succession of such like\ntransactions that men sink at last to the level of the relaxed\nmorality of this epoch, when there have never been so few of those who\nsquare their courses with their theories, so few of those noble\ncharacters who do not yield to temptation, for whom the slightest\ndeviation from the line of rectitude is a crime. To these magnificent\ntypes of uncompromising Right we owe two masterpieces–the Alceste of\nMoliere, and, in our own day, the characters of Jeanie Deans and her\nfather in Sir Walter Scott’s novel. Perhaps a work which should\nchronicle the opposite course, which should trace out all the devious\ncourses through which a man of the world, a man of ambitions, drags\nhis conscience, just steering clear of crime that he may gain his end\nand yet save appearances, such a chronicle would be no less edifying\nand no less dramatic.",
        "Rastignac went home. He was fascinated by Mme. de Nucingen; he seemed\nto see her before him, slender and graceful as a swallow. He recalled\nthe intoxicating sweetness of her eyes, her fair hair, the delicate\nsilken tissue of the skin, beneath which it almost seemed to him that\nhe could see the blood coursing; the tones of her voice still exerted\na spell over him; he had forgotten nothing; his walk perhaps heated\nhis imagination by sending a glow of warmth through his veins. He\nknocked unceremoniously at Goriot’s door.",
        "“I have seen Mme. Delphine, neighbor,” said he.",
        "“Where?”",
        "“At the Italiens.”",
        "“Did she enjoy it? . . . . Just come inside,” and the old man left his\nbed, unlocked the door, and promptly returned again.",
        "It was the first time that Eugene had been in Father Goriot’s room,\nand he could not control his feeling of amazement at the contrast\nbetween the den in which the father lived and the costume of the\ndaughter whom he had just beheld. The window was curtainless, the\nwalls were damp, in places the varnished wall-paper had come away and\ngave glimpses of the grimy yellow plaster beneath. The wretched bed on\nwhich the old man lay boasted but one thin blanket, and a wadded quilt\nmade out of large pieces of Mme. Vauquer’s old dresses. The floor was\ndamp and gritty. Opposite the window stood a chest of drawers made of\nrosewood, one of the old-fashioned kind with a curving front and brass\nhandles, shaped like rings of twisted vine stems covered with flowers\nand leaves. On a venerable piece of furniture with a wooden shelf\nstood a ewer and basin and shaving apparatus. A pair of shoes stood in\none corner; a night-table by the bed had neither a door nor marble\nslab. There was not a trace of a fire in the empty grate; the square\nwalnut table with the crossbar against which Father Goriot had crushed\nand twisted his posset-dish stood near the hearth. The old man’s hat\nwas lying on a broken-down bureau. An armchair stuffed with straw and\na couple of chairs completed the list of ramshackle furniture. From\nthe tester of the bed, tied to the ceiling by a piece of rag, hung a\nstrip of some cheap material in large red and black checks. No poor\ndrudge in a garret could be worse lodged than Father Goriot in Mme.\nVauquer’s lodging-house. The mere sight of the room sent a chill\nthrough you and a sense of oppression; it was like the worst cell in a\nprison. Luckily, Goriot could not see the effect that his surroundings\nproduced on Eugene as the latter deposited his candle on the\nnight-table. The old man turned round, keeping the bedclothes huddled\nup to his chin.",
        "“Well,” he said, “and which do you like the best, Mme. de Restaud or\nMme. de Nucingen?”",
        "“I like Mme. Delphine the best,” said the law student, “because she\nloves you the best.”",
        "At the words so heartily spoken the old man’s hand slipped out from\nunder the bedclothes and grasped Eugene’s.",
        "“Thank you, thank you,” he said, gratefully. “Then what did she say\nabout me?”",
        "The student repeated the Baroness’ remarks with some embellishments of\nhis own, the old man listening the while as though he heard a voice\nfrom Heaven.",
        "“Dear child!” he said. “Yes, yes, she is very fond of me. But you must\nnot believe all that she tells you about Anastasie. The two sisters\nare jealous of each other, you see, another proof of their affection.\nMme. de Restaud is very fond of me too. I know she is. A father sees\nhis children as God sees all of us; he looks into the very depths of\ntheir hearts; he knows their intentions; and both of them are so\nloving. Oh! if I only had good sons-in-law, I should be too happy, and\nI dare say there is no perfect happiness here below. If I might live\nwith them–simply hear their voices, know that they are there, see\nthem go and come as I used to do at home when they were still with me;\nwhy, my heart bounds at the thought. . . . Were they nicely dressed?”",
        "“Yes,” said Eugene. “But, M. Goriot, how is it that your daughters\nhave such fine houses, while you live in such a den as this?”",
        "“Dear me, why should I want anything better?” he replied, with seeming\ncarelessness. “I can’t quite explain to you how it is; I am not used\nto stringing words together properly, but it all lies there––” he\nsaid, tapping his heart. “My real life is in my two girls, you see;\nand so long as they are happy, and smartly dressed, and have soft\ncarpets under their feet, what does it matter what clothes I wear or\nwhere I lie down of a night? I shall never feel cold so long as they\nare warm; I shall never feel dull if they are laughing. I have no\ntroubles but theirs. When you, too, are a father, and you hear your\nchildren’s little voices, you will say to yourself, ’That has all come\nfrom me.’ You will feel that those little ones are akin to every drop\nin your veins, that they are the very flower of your life (and what\nelse are they?); you will cleave so closely to them that you seem to\nfeel every movement that they make. Everywhere I hear their voices\nsounding in my ears. If they are sad, the look in their eyes freezes\nmy blood. Some day you will find out that there is far more happiness\nin another’s happiness than in your own. It is something that I cannot\nexplain, something within that sends a glow of warmth all through you.\nIn short, I live my life three times over. Shall I tell you something\nfunny? Well, then, since I have been a father, I have come to\nunderstand God. He is everywhere in the world, because the whole world\ncomes from Him. And it is just the same with my children, monsieur.\nOnly, I love my daughters better than God loves the world, for the\nworld is not so beautiful as God Himself is, but my children are more\nbeautiful than I am. Their lives are so bound up with mine that I felt\nsomehow that you would see them this evening. Great Heaven! If any man\nwould make my little Delphine as happy as a wife is when she is loved,\nI would black his boots and run on his errands. That miserable M. de\nMarsay is a cur; I know all about him from her maid. A longing to\nwring his neck comes over me now and then. He does not love her! does\nnot love a pearl of a woman, with a voice like a nightingale and\nshaped like a model. Where can her eyes have been when she married\nthat great lump of an Alsatian? They ought both of them to have\nmarried young men, good-looking and good-tempered–but, after all,\nthey had their own way.”",
        "Father Goriot was sublime. Eugene had never yet seen his face light up\nas it did now with the passionate fervor of a father’s love. It is\nworthy of remark that strong feeling has a very subtle and pervasive\npower; the roughest nature, in the endeavor to express a deep and\nsincere affection, communicates to others the influence that has put\nresonance into the voice, and eloquence into every gesture, wrought a\nchange in the very features of the speaker; for under the inspiration\nof passion the stupidest human being attains to the highest eloquence\nof ideas, if not of language, and seems to move in some sphere of\nlight. In the old man’s tones and gesture there was something just\nthen of the same spell that a great actor exerts over his audience.\nBut does not the poet in us find expression in our affections?",
        "“Well,” said Eugene, “perhaps you will not be sorry to hear that she\nis pretty sure to break with de Marsay before long. That sprig of\nfashion has left her for the Princesse Galathionne. For my part, I\nfell in love with Mme. Delphine this evening.”",
        "“Stuff!” said Father Goriot.",
        "“I did indeed, and she did not regard me with aversion. For a whole\nhour we talked of love, and I am to go to call on her on Saturday, the\nday after to-morrow.”",
        "“Oh! how I should love you, if she should like you. You are\nkind-hearted; you would never make her miserable. If you were to\nforsake her, I would cut your throat at once. A woman does not love\ntwice, you see! Good heavens! what nonsense I am talking, M. Eugene!\nIt is cold; you ought not to stay here. Mon Dieu! so you have heard\nher speak? What message did she give you for me?”",
        "“None at all,” said Eugene to himself; aloud he answered, “She told me\nto tell you that your daughter sends you a good kiss.”",
        "“Good-night, neighbor! Sleep well, and pleasant dreams to you! I have\nmine already made for me by that message from her. May God grant you\nall your desires! You have come in like a good angel on me to-night,\nand brought with you the air that my daughter breathes.”",
        "“Poor old fellow!” said Eugene as he lay down. “It is enough to melt a\nheart of stone. His daughter no more thought of him than of the Grand\nTurk.”",
        "Ever after this conference Goriot looked upon his neighbor as a\nfriend, a confidant such as he had never hoped to find; and there was\nestablished between the two the only relationship that could attach\nthis old man to another man. The passions never miscalculate. Father\nGoriot felt that this friendship brought him closer to his daughter\nDelphine; he thought that he should find a warmer welcome for himself\nif the Baroness should care for Eugene. Moreover, he had confided one\nof his troubles to the younger man. Mme. de Nucingen, for whose\nhappiness he prayed a thousand times daily, had never known the joys\nof love. Eugene was certainly (to make use of his own expression) one\nof the nicest young men that he had ever seen, and some prophetic\ninstinct seemed to tell him that Eugene was to give her the happiness\nwhich had not been hers. These were the beginnings of a friendship\nthat grew up between the old man and his neighbor; but for this\nfriendship the catastrophe of the drama must have remained a mystery.",
        "The affection with which Father Goriot regarded Eugene, by whom he\nseated himself at breakfast, the change in Goriot’s face, which as a\nrule, looked as expressionless as a plaster cast, and a few words that\npassed between the two, surprised the other lodgers. Vautrin, who saw\nEugene for the first time since their interview, seemed as if he would\nfain read the student’s very soul. During the night Eugene had had\nsome time in which to scan the vast field which lay before him; and\nnow, as he remembered yesterday’s proposal, the thought of Mlle.\nTaillefer’s dowry came, of course, to his mind, and he could not help\nthinking of Victorine as the most exemplary youth may think of an\nheiress. It chanced that their eyes met. The poor girl did not fail to\nsee that Eugene looked very handsome in his new clothes. So much was\nsaid in the glance, thus exchanged, that Eugene could not doubt but\nthat he was associated in her mind with the vague hopes that lie\ndormant in a girl’s heart and gather round the first attractive\nnewcomer. “Eight hundred thousand francs!” a voice cried in his ears,\nbut suddenly he took refuge in the memories of yesterday evening,\nthinking that his extemporized passion for Mme. de Nucingen was a\ntalisman that would preserve him from this temptation.",
        "“They gave Rossini’s Barber of Seville at the Italiens yesterday\nevening,” he remarked. “I never heard such delicious music. Good\ngracious! how lucky people are to have a box at the Italiens!”",
        "Father Goriot drank in every word that Eugene let fall, and watched\nhim as a dog watches his master’s slightest movement.",
        "“You men are like fighting cocks,” said Mme. Vauquer; “you do what you\nlike.”",
        "“How did you get back?” inquired Vautrin.",
        "“I walked,” answered Eugene.",
        "“For my own part,” remarked the tempter, “I do not care about doing\nthings by halves. If I want to enjoy myself that way, I should prefer\nto go in my carriage, sit in my own box, and do the thing comfortably.\nEverything or nothing; that is my motto.”",
        "“And a good one, too,” commented Mme. Vauquer.",
        "“Perhaps you will see Mme. de Nucingen to-day,” said Eugene,\naddressing Goriot in an undertone. “She will welcome you with open\narms, I am sure; she would want to ask you for all sorts of little\ndetails about me. I have found out that she will do anything in the\nworld to be known by my cousin Mme. de Beauseant; don’t forget to tell\nher that I love her too well not to think of trying to arrange this.”",
        "Rastignac went at once to the Ecole de Droit. He had no mind to stay a\nmoment longer than was necessary in that odious house. He wasted his\ntime that day; he had fallen a victim to that fever of the brain that\naccompanies the too vivid hopes of youth. Vautrin’s arguments had set\nhim meditating on social life, and he was deep in these reflections\nwhen he happened on his friend Bianchon in the Jardin du Luxembourg.",
        "“What makes you look so solemn?” said the medical student, putting an\narm through Eugene’s as they went towards the Palais.",
        "“I am tormented by temptations.”",
        "“What kind? There is a cure for temptation.”",
        "“What?”",
        "“Yielding to it.”",
        "“You laugh, but you don’t know what it is all about. Have you read\nRousseau?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Do you remember that he asks the reader somewhere what he would do if\nhe could make a fortune by killing an old mandarin somewhere in China\nby mere force of wishing it, and without stirring from Paris?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Well, then?”",
        "“Pshaw! I am at my thirty-third mandarin.”",
        "“Seriously, though. Look here, suppose you were sure that you could do\nit, and had only to give a nod. Would you do it?”",
        "“Is he well stricken in years, this mandarin of yours? Pshaw! after\nall, young or old, paralytic, or well and sound, my word for it.\n. . . Well, then. Hang it, no!”",
        "“You are a good fellow, Bianchon. But suppose you loved a woman well\nenough to lose your soul in hell for her, and that she wanted money\nfor dresses and a carriage, and all her whims, in fact?”",
        "“Why, here you are taking away my reason, and want me to reason!”",
        "“Well, then, Bianchon, I am mad; bring me to my senses. I have two\nsisters as beautiful and innocent as angels, and I want them to be\nhappy. How am I to find two hundred thousand francs apiece for them in\nthe next five years? Now and then in life, you see, you must play for\nheavy stakes, and it is no use wasting your luck on low play.”",
        "“But you are only stating the problem that lies before every one at\nthe outset of his life, and you want to cut the Gordian knot with a\nsword. If that is the way of it, dear boy, you must be an Alexander,\nor to the hulks you go. For my own part, I am quite contented with the\nlittle lot I mean to make for myself somewhere in the country, when I\nmean to step into my father’s shoes and plod along. A man’s affections\nare just as fully satisfied by the smallest circle as they can be by a\nvast circumference. Napoleon himself could only dine once, and he\ncould not have more mistresses than a house student at the Capuchins.\nHappiness, old man, depends on what lies between the sole of your foot\nand the crown of your head; and whether it costs a million or a\nhundred louis, the actual amount of pleasure that you receive rests\nentirely with you, and is just exactly the same in any case. I am for\nletting that Chinaman live.”",
        "“Thank you, Bianchon; you have done me good. We will always be\nfriends.”",
        "“I say,” remarked the medical student, as they came to the end of a\nbroad walk in the Jardin des Plantes, “I saw the Michonneau and Poiret\na few minutes ago on a bench chatting with a gentleman whom I used to\nsee in last year’s troubles hanging about the Chamber of Deputies; he\nseems to me, in fact, to be a detective dressed up like a decent\nretired tradesman. Let us keep an eye on that couple; I will tell you\nwhy some time. Good-bye; it is nearly four o’clock, and I must be in\nto answer to my name.”",
        "When Eugene reached the lodging-house, he found Father Goriot waiting\nfor him.",
        "“Here,” cried the old man, “here is a letter from her. Pretty\nhandwriting, eh?”",
        "Eugene broke the seal and read:–",
        " “Sir,–I have heard from my father that you are fond of Italian\n  music. I shall be delighted if you will do me the pleasure of\n  accepting a seat in my box. La Fodor and Pellegrini will sing on\n  Saturday, so I am sure that you will not refuse me. M. de Nucingen\n  and I shall be pleased if you will dine with us; we shall be quite\n  by ourselves. If you will come and be my escort, my husband will\n  be glad to be relieved from his conjugal duties. Do not answer,\n  but simply come.–Yours sincerely, D. DE N.”",
        "“Let me see it,” said Father Goriot, when Eugene had read the letter.\n\"You are going, aren’t you?” he added, when he had smelled the\nwriting-paper. “How nice it smells! Her fingers have touched it, that\nis certain.”",
        "“A woman does not fling herself at a man’s head in this way,” the\nstudent was thinking. “She wants to use me to bring back de Marsay;\nnothing but pique makes a woman do a thing like this.”",
        "“Well,” said Father Goriot, “what are you thinking about?”",
        "Eugene did not know the fever or vanity that possessed some women in\nthose days; how should he imagine that to open a door in the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain a banker’s wife would go to almost any length. For the\ncoterie of the Faubourg Saint-Germain was a charmed circle, and the\nwomen who moved in it were at that time the queens of society; and\namong the greatest of these Dames du Petit-Chateau, as they were\ncalled, were Mme. de Beauseant and her friends the Duchesse de\nLangeais and the Duchesse de Maufrigneause. Rastignac was alone in his\nignorance of the frantic efforts made by women who lived in the\nChausee-d’Antin to enter this seventh heaven and shine among the\nbrightest constellations of their sex. But his cautious disposition\nstood him in good stead, and kept his judgment cool, and the not\naltogether enviable power of imposing instead of accepting conditions.",
        "“Yes, I am going,” he replied.",
        "So it was curiosity that drew him to Mme. de Nucingen; while, if she\nhad treated him disdainfully, passion perhaps might have brought him\nto her feet. Still he waited almost impatiently for to-morrow, and the\nhour when he could go to her. There is almost as much charm for a\nyoung man in a first flirtation as there is in first love. The\ncertainty of success is a source of happiness to which men do not\nconfess, and all the charm of certain women lies in this. The desire\nof conquest springs no less from the easiness than from the difficulty\nof triumph, and every passion is excited or sustained by one or the\nother of these two motives which divide the empire of love. Perhaps\nthis division is one result of the great question of temperaments;\nwhich, after all, dominates social life. The melancholic temperament\nmay stand in need of the tonic of coquetry, while those of nervous or\nsanguine complexion withdraw if they meet with a too stubborn\nresistance. In other words, the lymphatic temperament is essentially\ndespondent, and the rhapsodic is bilious.",
        "Eugene lingered over his toilette with an enjoyment of all its little\ndetails that is grateful to a young man’s self-love, though he will\nnot own to it for fear of being laughed at. He thought, as he arranged\nhis hair, that a pretty woman’s glances would wander through the dark\ncurls. He indulged in childish tricks like any young girl dressing for\na dance, and gazed complacently at his graceful figure while he\nsmoothed out the creases of his coat.",
        "“There are worse figures, that is certain,” he said to himself.",
        "Then he went downstairs, just as the rest of the household were\nsitting down to dinner, and took with good humor the boisterous\napplause excited by his elegant appearance. The amazement with which\nany attention to dress is regarded in a lodging-house is a very\ncharacteristic trait. No one can put on a new coat but every one else\nmust say his say about it.",
        "“Clk! clk! clk!” cried Bianchon, making the sound with his tongue\nagainst the roof of his mouth, like a driver urging on a horse.",
        "“He holds himself like a duke and a peer of France,” said Mme.\nVauquer.",
        "“Are you going a-courting?” inquired Mlle. Michonneau.",
        "“Cock-a-doodle-doo!” cried the artist.",
        "“My compliments to my lady your wife,” from the employe at the\nMuseum.",
        "“Your wife; have you a wife?” asked Poiret.",
        "“Yes, in compartments, water-tight and floats, guaranteed fast color,\nall prices from twenty-five to forty sous, neat check patterns in the\nlatest fashion and best taste, will wash, half-linen, half-cotton,\nhalf-wool; a certain cure for toothache and other complaints under the\npatronage of the Royal College of Physicians! children like it! a\nremedy for headache, indigestion, and all other diseases affecting the\nthroat, eyes, and ears!” cried Vautrin, with a comical imitation of\nthe volubility of a quack at a fair. “And how much shall we say for\nthis marvel, gentlemen? Twopence? No. Nothing of the sort. All that is\nleft in stock after supplying the Great Mogul. All the crowned heads\nof Europe, including the Gr-r-rand Duke of Baden, have been anxious to\nget a sight of it. Walk up! walk up! gentlemen! Pay at the desk as you\ngo in! Strike up the music there! Brooum, la, la, trinn! la, la, boum!\nboum! Mister Clarinette, there you are out of tune!” he added gruffly;\n\"I will rap your knuckles for you!”",
        "“Goodness! what an amusing man!” said Mme. Vauquer to Mme. Couture; “I\nshould never feel dull with him in the house.”",
        "This burlesque of Vautrin’s was the signal for an outburst of\nmerriment, and under cover of jokes and laughter Eugene caught a\nglance from Mlle. Taillefer; she had leaned over to say a few words in\nMme. Couture’s ear.",
        "“The cab is at the door,” announced Sylvie.",
        "“But where is he going to dine?” asked Bianchon.",
        "“With Madame la Baronne de Nucingen.”",
        "“M. Goriot’s daughter,” said the law student.",
        "At this, all eyes turned to the old vermicelli maker; he was gazing at\nEugene with something like envy in his eyes.",
        "Rastignac reached the house in the Rue Saint-Lazare, one of those\nmany-windowed houses with a mean-looking portico and slender columns,\nwhich are considered the thing in Paris, a typical banker’s house,\ndecorated in the most ostentatious fashion; the walls lined with\nstucco, the landings of marble mosaic. Mme. de Nucingen was sitting in\na little drawing-room; the room was painted in the Italian fashion,\nand decorated like a restaurant. The Baroness seemed depressed. The\neffort that she made to hide her feelings aroused Eugene’s interest;\nit was plain that she was not playing a part. He had expected a little\nflutter of excitement at his coming, and he found her dispirited and\nsad. The disappointment piqued his vanity.",
        "“My claim to your confidence is very small, madame,” he said, after\nrallying her on her abstracted mood; “but if I am in the way, please\ntell me so frankly; I count on your good faith.”",
        "“No, stay with me,” she said; “I shall be all alone if you go.\nNucingen is dining in town, and I do not want to be alone; I want to\nbe taken out of myself.”",
        "“But what is the matter?”",
        "“You are the very last person whom I should tell,” she exclaimed.",
        "“Then I am connected in some way in this secret. I wonder what it is?”",
        "“Perhaps. Yet, no,” she went on; “it is a domestic quarrel, which\nought to be buried in the depths of the heart. I am very unhappy; did\nI not tell you so the day before yesterday? Golden chains are the\nheaviest of all fetters.”",
        "When a woman tells a young man that she is very unhappy, and when the\nyoung man is clever, and well dressed, and has fifteen hundred francs\nlying idle in his pocket, he is sure to think as Eugene said, and he\nbecomes a coxcomb.",
        "“What can you have left to wish for?” he answered. “You are young,\nbeautiful, beloved, and rich.”",
        "“Do not let us talk of my affairs,” she said shaking her head\nmournfully. “We will dine together tete-a-tete, and afterwards we\nwill go to hear the most exquisite music. Am I to your taste?” she\nwent on, rising and displaying her gown of white cashmere, covered\nwith Persian designs in the most superb taste.",
        "“I wish that you were altogether mine,” said Eugene; “you are\ncharming.”",
        "“You would have a forlorn piece of property,” she said, smiling\nbitterly. “There is nothing about me that betrays my wretchedness; and\nyet, in spite of appearances, I am in despair. I cannot sleep; my\ntroubles have broken my night’s rest; I shall grow ugly.”",
        "“Oh! that is impossible,” cried the law student; “but I am curious to\nknow what these troubles can be that a devoted love cannot efface.”",
        "“Ah! if I were to tell you about them, you would shun me,” she said.\n\"Your love for me is as yet only the conventional gallantry that men\nuse to masquerade in; and, if you really loved me, you would be driven\nto despair. I must keep silence, you see. Let us talk of something\nelse, for pity’s sake,” she added. “Let me show you my rooms.”",
        "“No; let us stay here,” answered Eugene; he sat down on the sofa\nbefore the fire, and boldly took Mme. de Nucingen’s hand in his. She\nsurrendered it to him; he even felt the pressure of her fingers in one\nof the spasmodic clutches that betray terrible agitation.",
        "“Listen,” said Rastignac; “if you are in trouble, you ought to tell me\nabout it. I want to prove to you that I love you for yourself alone.\nYou must speak to me frankly about your troubles, so that I can put an\nend to them, even if I have to kill half-a-dozen men; or I shall go,\nnever to return.”",
        "“Very well,” she cried, putting her hand to her forehead in an agony\nof despair, “I will put you to the proof, and this very moment. Yes,\"\nshe said to herself, “I have no other resource left.”",
        "She rang the bell.",
        "“Are the horses put in for the master?” she asked of the servant.",
        "“Yes, madame.”",
        "“I shall take his carriage myself. He can have mine and my horses.\nServe dinner at seven o’clock.”",
        "“Now, come with me,” she said to Eugene, who thought as he sat in the\nbanker’s carriage beside Mme. de Nucingen that he must surely be\ndreaming.",
        "“To the Palais-Royal,” she said to the coachman; “stop near the\nTheatre-Francais.”",
        "She seemed to be too troubled and excited to answer the innumerable\nquestions that Eugene put to her. He was at a loss what to think of\nher mute resistance, her obstinate silence.",
        "“Another moment and she will escape me,” he said to himself.",
        "When the carriage stopped at last, the Baroness gave the law student a\nglance that silenced his wild words, for he was almost beside himself.",
        "“Is it true that you love me?” she asked.",
        "“Yes,” he answered, and in his manner and tone there was no trace of\nthe uneasiness that he felt.",
        "“You will not think ill of me, will you, whatever I may ask of you?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Are you ready to do my bidding?”",
        "“Blindly.”",
        "“Have you ever been to a gaming-house?” she asked in a tremulous\nvoice.",
        "“Never.”",
        "“Ah! now I can breathe. You will have luck. Here is my purse,” she\nsaid. “Take it! there are a hundred francs in it, all that such a\nfortunate woman as I can call her own. Go up into one of the\ngaming-houses–I do not know where they are, but there are some near\nthe Palais-Royal. Try your luck with the hundred francs at a game they\ncall roulette; lose it all or bring me back six thousand francs. I\nwill tell you about my troubles when you come back.”",
        "“Devil take me, I’m sure, if I have a glimmer of a notion of what I am\nabout, but I will obey you,” he added, with inward exultation, as he\nthought, “She has gone too far to draw back–she can refuse me\nnothing now!”",
        "Eugene took the dainty little purse, inquired the way of a second-hand\nclothes-dealer, and hurried to number 9, which happened to be the\nnearest gaming-house. He mounted the staircase, surrendered his hat,\nand asked the way to the roulette-table, whither the attendant took\nhim, not a little to the astonishment of the regular comers. All eyes\nwere fixed on Eugene as he asked, without bashfulness, where he was to\ndeposit his stakes.",
        "“If you put a louis on one only of those thirty-six numbers, and it\nturns up, you will win thirty-six louis,” said a respectable-looking,\nwhite-haired old man in answer to his inquiry.",
        "Eugene staked the whole of his money on the number 21 (his own age).\nThere was a cry of surprise; before he knew what he had done, he had\nwon.",
        "“Take your money off, sir,” said the old gentleman; “you don’t often\nwin twice running by that system.”",
        "Eugene took the rake that the old man handed to him, and drew in his\nthree thousand six hundred francs, and, still perfectly ignorant of\nwhat he was about, staked again on the red. The bystanders watched him\nenviously as they saw him continue to play. The disc turned, and again\nhe won; the banker threw him three thousand six hundred francs once\nmore.",
        "“You have seven thousand, two hundred francs of your own,” the old\ngentleman said in his ear. “Take my advice and go away with your\nwinnings; red has turned up eight times already. If you are\ncharitable, you will show your gratitude for sound counsel by giving a\ntrifle to an old prefect of Napoleon who is down on his luck.”",
        "Rastignac’s head was swimming; he saw ten of his louis pass into the\nwhite-haired man’s possession, and went down-stairs with his seven\nthousand francs; he was still ignorant of the game, and stupefied by\nhis luck.",
        "“So, that is over; and now where will you take me?” he asked, as soon\nas the door was closed, and he showed the seven thousand francs to\nMme. de Nucingen.",
        "Delphine flung her arms about him, but there was no passion in that\nwild embrace.",
        "“You have saved me!” she cried, and tears of joy flowed fast.",
        "“I will tell you everything, my friend. For you will be my friend,\nwill you not? I am rich, you think, very rich; I have everything I\nwant, or I seem as if I had everything. Very well, you must know that\nM. de Nucingen does not allow me the control of a single penny; he\npays all the bills for the house expenses; he pays for my carriages\nand opera box; he does not give me enough to pay for my dress, and he\nreduces me to poverty in secret on purpose. I am too proud to beg from\nhim. I should be the vilest of women if I could take his money at the\nprice at which he offers it. Do you ask how I, with seven hundred\nthousand francs of my own, could let myself be robbed? It is because I\nwas proud, and scorned to speak. We are so young, so artless when our\nmarried life begins! I never could bring myself to ask my husband for\nmoney; the words would have made my lips bleed, I did not dare to ask;\nI spent my savings first, and then the money that my poor father gave\nme, then I ran into debt. Marriage for me is a hideous farce; I cannot\ntalk about it, let it suffice to say that Nucingen and I have separate\nrooms, and that I would fling myself out of the window sooner than\nconsent to any other manner of life. I suffered agonies when I had to\nconfess to my girlish extravagance, my debts for jewelry and trifles\n(for our poor father had never refused us anything, and spoiled us),\nbut at last I found courage to tell him about them. After all, I had a\nfortune of my own. Nucingen flew into a rage; he said that I should be\nthe ruin of him, and used frightful language! I wished myself a\nhundred feet down in the earth. He had my dowry, so he paid my debts,\nbut he stipulated at the same time that my expenses in future must not\nexceed a certain fixed sum, and I gave way for the sake of peace. And\nthen,” she went on, “I wanted to gratify the self-love of some one\nwhom you know. He may have deceived me, but I should do him the\njustice to say that there was nothing petty in his character. But,\nafter all, he threw me over disgracefully. If, at a woman’s utmost\nneed, somebody heaps gold upon her, he ought never to forsake her;\nthat love should last for ever! But you, at one-and-twenty, you, the\nsoul of honor, with the unsullied conscience of youth, will ask me how\na woman can bring herself to accept money in such a way? Mon Dieu!\nis it not natural to share everything with the one to whom we owe our\nhappiness? When all has been given, why should we pause and hesitate\nover a part? Money is as nothing between us until the moment when the\nsentiment that bound us together ceases to exist. Were we not bound to\neach other for life? Who that believes in love foresees such an end to\nlove? You swear to love us eternally; how, then, can our interests be\nseparate?",
        "“You do not know how I suffered to-day when Nucingen refused to give\nme six thousand francs; he spends as much as that every month on his\nmistress, an opera dancer! I thought of killing myself. The wildest\nthoughts came into my head. There have been moments in my life when I\nhave envied my servants, and would have changed places with my maid.\nIt was madness to think of going to our father, Anastasie and I have\nbled him dry; our poor father would have sold himself if he could have\nraised six thousand francs that way. I should have driven him frantic\nto no purpose. You have saved me from shame and death; I was beside\nmyself with anguish. Ah! monsieur, I owed you this explanation after\nmy mad ravings. When you left me just now, as soon as you were out of\nsight, I longed to escape, to run away . . . where, I did not know.\nHalf the women in Paris lead such lives as mine; they live in apparent\nluxury, and in their souls are tormented by anxiety. I know of poor\ncreatures even more miserable than I; there are women who are driven\nto ask their tradespeople to make out false bills, women who rob their\nhusbands. Some men believe that an Indian shawl worth a thousand louis\nonly cost five hundred francs, others that a shawl costing five\nhundred francs is worth a hundred louis. There are women, too, with\nnarrow incomes, who scrape and save and starve their children to pay\nfor a dress. I am innocent of these base meannesses. But this is the\nlast extremity of my torture. Some women will sell themselves to their\nhusbands, and so obtain their way, but I, at any rate, am free. If I\nchose, Nucingen would cover me with gold, but I would rather weep on\nthe breast of a man whom I can respect. Ah! tonight, M. de Marsay will\nno longer have a right to think of me as a woman whom he has paid.\"\nShe tried to conceal her tears from him, hiding her face in her hands;\nEugene drew them away and looked at her; she seemed to him sublime at\nthat moment.",
        "“It is hideous, is it not,” she cried, “to speak in a breath of money\nand affection. You cannot love me after this,” she added.",
        "The incongruity between the ideas of honor which make women so great,\nand the errors in conduct which are forced upon them by the\nconstitution of society, had thrown Eugene’s thoughts into confusion;\nhe uttered soothing and consoling words, and wondered at the beautiful\nwoman before him, and at the artless imprudence of her cry of pain.",
        "“You will not remember this against me?” she asked; “promise me that\nyou will not.”",
        "“Ah! madame, I am incapable of doing so,” he said. She took his hand\nand held it to her heart, a movement full of grace that expressed her\ndeep gratitude.",
        "“I am free and happy once more, thanks to you,” she said. “Oh! I have\nfelt lately as if I were in the grasp of an iron hand. But after this\nI mean to live simply and to spend nothing. You will think me just as\npretty, will you not, my friend? Keep this,” she went on, as she took\nonly six of the banknotes. “In conscience I owe you a thousand crowns,\nfor I really ought to go halves with you.”",
        "Eugene’s maiden conscience resisted; but when the Baroness said, “I am\nbound to look on you as an accomplice or as an enemy,” he took the\nmoney.",
        "“It shall be a last stake in reserve,” he said, “in case of\nmisfortune.”",
        "“That was what I was dreading to hear,” she cried, turning pale. “Oh,\nif you would that I should be anything to you, swear to me that you\nwill never re-enter a gaming-house. Great Heaven! that I should\ncorrupt you! I should die of sorrow!”",
        "They had reached the Rue Saint-Lazare by this time. The contrast\nbetween the ostentation of wealth in the house, and the wretched\ncondition of its mistress, dazed the student; and Vautrin’s cynical\nwords began to ring in his ears.",
        "“Seat yourself there,” said the Baroness, pointing to a low chair\nbeside the fire. “I have a difficult letter to write,” she added.\n\"Tell me what to say.”",
        "“Say nothing,” Eugene answered her. “Put the bills in an envelope,\ndirect it, and send it by your maid.”",
        "“Why, you are a love of a man,” she said. “Ah! see what it is to have\nbeen well brought up. That is the Beauseant through and through,” she\nwent on, smiling at him.",
        "“She is charming,” thought Eugene, more and more in love. He looked\nround him at the room; there was an ostentatious character about the\nluxury, a meretricious taste in the splendor.",
        "“Do you like it?” she asked, as she rang for the maid.",
        "“Therese, take this to M. de Marsay, and give it into his hands\nyourself. If he is not at home, bring the letter back to me.”",
        "Therese went, but not before she had given Eugene a spiteful glance.",
        "Dinner was announced. Rastignac gave his arm to Mme. de Nucingen, she\nled the way into a pretty dining-room, and again he saw the luxury of\nthe table which he had admired in his cousin’s house.",
        "“Come and dine with me on opera evenings, and we will go to the\nItaliens afterwards,” she said.",
        "“I should soon grow used to the pleasant life if it could last, but I\nam a poor student, and I have my way to make.”",
        "“Oh! you will succeed,” she said laughing. “You will see. All that you\nwish will come to pass. I did not expect to be so happy.”",
        "It is the wont of women to prove the impossible by the possible, and\nto annihilate facts by presentiments. When Mme. de Nucingen and\nRastignac took their places in her box at the Bouffons, her face wore\na look of happiness that made her so lovely that every one indulged in\nthose small slanders against which women are defenceless; for the\nscandal that is uttered lightly is often seriously believed. Those who\nknow Paris, believe nothing that is said, and say nothing of what is\ndone there.",
        "Eugene took the Baroness’ hand in his, and by some light pressure of\nthe fingers, or a closer grasp of the hand, they found a language in\nwhich to express the sensations which the music gave them. It was an\nevening of intoxicating delight for both; and when it ended, and they\nwent out together, Mme. de Nucingen insisted on taking Eugene with her\nas far as the Pont Neuf, he disputing with her the whole of the way\nfor a single kiss after all those that she had showered upon him so\npassionately at the Palais-Royal; Eugene reproached her with\ninconsistency.",
        "“That was gratitude,” she said, “for devotion that I did not dare to\nhope for, but now it would be a promise.”",
        "“And will you give me no promise, ingrate?”",
        "He grew vexed. Then, with one of those impatient gestures that fill a\nlover with ecstasy, she gave him her hand to kiss, and he took it with\na discontented air that delighted her.",
        "“I shall see you at the ball on Monday,” she said.",
        "As Eugene went home in the moonlight, he fell to serious reflections.\nHe was satisfied, and yet dissatisfied. He was pleased with an\nadventure which would probably give him his desire, for in the end one\nof the prettiest and best-dressed women in Paris would be his; but, as\na set-off, he saw his hopes of fortune brought to nothing; and as soon\nas he realized this fact, the vague thoughts of yesterday evening\nbegan to take a more decided shape in his mind. A check is sure to\nreveal to us the strength of our hopes. The more Eugene learned of the\npleasures of life in Paris, the more impatient he felt of poverty and\nobscurity. He crumpled the banknote in his pocket, and found any\nquantity of plausible excuses for appropriating it.",
        "He reached the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve at last, and from the\nstairhead he saw a light in Goriot’s room; the old man had lighted a\ncandle, and set the door ajar, lest the student should pass him by,\nand go to his room without “telling him all about his daughter,” to\nuse his own expression. Eugene, accordingly, told him everything\nwithout reserve.",
        "“Then they think that I am ruined!” cried Father Goriot, in an agony\nof jealousy and desperation. “Why, I have still thirteen hundred\nlivres a year! Mon Dieu! Poor little girl! why did she not come to\nme? I would have sold my rentes; she should have had some of the\nprincipal, and I would have bought a life-annuity with the rest. My\ngood neighbor, why did not you come to tell me of her difficulty? How\nhad you the heart to go and risk her poor little hundred francs at\nplay? This is heart-breaking work. You see what it is to have\nsons-in-law. Oh! if I had hold of them, I would wring their necks.\nMon Dieu! crying! Did you say she was crying?”",
        "“With her head on my waistcoat,” said Eugene.",
        "“Oh! give it to me,” said Father Goriot. “What! my daughter’s tears\nhave fallen there–my darling Delphine, who never used to cry when she\nwas a little girl! Oh! I will buy you another; do not wear it again;\nlet me have it. By the terms of her marriage-contract, she ought to\nhave the use of her property. To-morrow morning I will go and see\nDerville; he is an attorney. I will demand that her money should be\ninvested in her own name. I know the law. I am an old wolf, I will\nshow my teeth.”",
        "“Here, father; this is a banknote for a thousand francs that she\nwanted me to keep out of our winnings. Keep them for her, in the\npocket of the waistcoat.”",
        "Goriot looked hard at Eugene, reached out and took the law student’s\nhand, and Eugene felt a tear fall on it.",
        "“You will succeed,” the old man said. “God is just, you see. I know an\nhonest man when I see him, and I can tell you, there are not many men\nlike you. I am to have another dear child in you, am I? There, go to\nsleep; you can sleep; you are not yet a father. She was crying! and I\nhave to be told about it!–and I was quietly eating my dinner, like an\nidiot, all the time–I, who would sell the Father, Son and Holy Ghost\nto save one tear to either of them.”",
        "“An honest man!” said Eugene to himself as he lay down. “Upon my word,\nI think I will be an honest man all my life; it is so pleasant to obey\nthe voice of conscience.” Perhaps none but believers in God do good in\nsecret; and Eugene believed in a God.",
        "The next day Rastignac went at the appointed time to Mme. de\nBeauseant, who took him with her to the Duchesse de Carigliano’s ball.\nThe Marechale received Eugene most graciously. Mme. de Nucingen was\nthere. Delphine’s dress seemed to suggest that she wished for the\nadmiration of others, so that she might shine the more in Eugene’s\neyes; she was eagerly expecting a glance from him, hiding, as she\nthought, this eagerness from all beholders. This moment is full of\ncharm for one who can guess all that passes in a woman’s mind. Who has\nnot refrained from giving his opinion, to prolong her suspense,\nconcealing his pleasure from a desire to tantalize, seeking a\nconfession of love in her uneasiness, enjoying the fears that he can\ndissipate by a smile? In the course of the evening the law student\nsuddenly comprehended his position; he saw that, as the cousin of Mme.\nde Beauseant, he was a personage in this world. He was already\ncredited with the conquest of Mme. de Nucingen, and for this reason\nwas a conspicuous figure; he caught the envious glances of other young\nmen, and experienced the earliest pleasures of coxcombry. People\nwondered at his luck, and scraps of these conversations came to his\nears as he went from room to room; all the women prophesied his\nsuccess; and Delphine, in her dread of losing him, promised that this\nevening she would not refuse the kiss that all his entreaties could\nscarcely win yesterday.",
        "Rastignac received several invitations. His cousin presented him to\nother women who were present; women who could claim to be of the\nhighest fashion; whose houses were looked upon as pleasant; and this\nwas the loftiest and most fashionable society in Paris into which he\nwas launched. So this evening had all the charm of a brilliant debut;\nit was an evening that he was to remember even in old age, as a woman\nlooks back upon her first ball and the memories of her girlish\ntriumphs.",
        "The next morning, at breakfast, he related the story of his success\nfor the benefit of Father Goriot and the lodgers. Vautrin began to\nsmile in a diabolical fashion.",
        "“And do you suppose,” cried that cold-blooded logician, “that a young\nman of fashion can live here in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, in the\nMaison Vauquer–an exceedingly respectable boarding-house in every\nway, I grant you, but an establishment that, none the less, falls\nshort of being fashionable? The house is comfortable, it is lordly in\nits abundance; it is proud to be the temporary abode of a Rastignac;\nbut, after all, it is in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, and luxury\nwould be out of place here, where we only aim at the purely\npatriarchalorama. If you mean to cut a figure in Paris, my young\nfriend,” Vautrin continued, with half-paternal jocularity, “you must\nhave three horses, a tilbury for the mornings, and a closed carriage\nfor the evening; you should spend altogether about nine thousand\nfrancs on your stables. You would show yourself unworthy of your\ndestiny if you spent no more than three thousand francs with your\ntailor, six hundred in perfumery, a hundred crowns to your shoemaker,\nand a hundred more to your hatter. As for your laundress, there goes\nanother thousand francs; a young man of fashion must of necessity make\na great point of his linen; if your linen comes up to the required\nstandard, people often do not look any further. Love and the Church\ndemand a fair altar-cloth. That is fourteen thousand francs. I am\nsaying nothing of losses at play, bets, and presents; it is impossible\nto allow less than two thousand francs for pocket money. I have led\nthat sort of life, and I know all about these expenses. Add the cost\nof necessaries next; three hundred louis for provender, a thousand\nfrancs for a place to roost in. Well, my boy, for all these little\nwants of ours we had need to have twenty-five thousand francs every\nyear in our purse, or we shall find ourselves in the kennel, and\npeople laughing at us, and our career is cut short, good-bye to\nsuccess, and good-bye to your mistress! I am forgetting your valet and\nyour groom! Is Christophe going to carry your billets-doux for you?\nDo you mean to employ the stationery you use at present? Suicidal\npolicy! Hearken to the wisdom of your elders!” he went on, his bass\nvoice growing louder at each syllable. “Either take up your quarters\nin a garret, live virtuously, and wed your work, or set about the\nthing in a different way.”",
        "Vautrin winked and leered in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer to\nenforce his remarks by a look which recalled the late tempting\nproposals by which he had sought to corrupt the student’s mind.",
        "Several days went by, and Rastignac lived in a whirl of gaiety. He\ndined almost every day with Mme. de Nucingen, and went wherever she\nwent, only returning to the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve in the small\nhours. He rose at mid-day, and dressed to go into the Bois with\nDelphine if the day was fine, squandering in this way time that was\nworth far more than he knew. He turned as eagerly to learn the lessons\nof luxury, and was as quick to feel its fascination, as the flowers of\nthe date palm to receive the fertilizing pollen. He played high, lost\nand won large sums of money, and at last became accustomed to the\nextravagant life that young men lead in Paris. He sent fifteen hundred\nfrancs out of his first winnings to his mother and sisters, sending\nhandsome presents as well as the money. He had given out that he meant\nto leave the Maison Vauquer; but January came and went, and he was\nstill there, still unprepared to go.",
        "One rule holds good of most young men–whether rich or poor. They\nnever have money for the necessaries of life, but they have always\nmoney to spare for their caprices–an anomaly which finds its\nexplanation in their youth and in the almost frantic eagerness with\nwhich youth grasps at pleasure. They are reckless with anything\nobtained on credit, while everything for which they must pay in ready\nmoney is made to last as long as possible; if they cannot have all\nthat they want, they make up for it, it would seem, by squandering\nwhat they have. To state the matter simply–a student is far more\ncareful of his hat than of his coat, because the latter being a\ncomparatively costly article of dress, it is in the nature of things\nthat a tailor should be a creditor; but it is otherwise with the\nhatter; the sums of money spent with him are so modest, that he is the\nmost independent and unmanageable of his tribe, and it is almost\nimpossible to bring him to terms. The young man in the balcony of a\ntheatre who displays a gorgeous waistcoat for the benefit of the fair\nowners of opera glasses, has very probably no socks in his wardrobe,\nfor the hosier is another of the genus of weevils that nibble at the\npurse. This was Rastignac’s condition. His purse was always empty for\nMme. Vauquer, always full at the demand of vanity; there was a\nperiodical ebb and flow in his fortunes, which was seldom favorable to\nthe payment of just debts. If he was to leave that unsavory and mean\nabode, where from time to time his pretensions met with humiliation,\nthe first step was to pay his hostess for a month’s board and lodging,\nand the second to purchase furniture worthy of the new lodgings he\nmust take in his quality of dandy, a course that remained impossible.\nRastignac, out of his winnings at cards, would pay his jeweler\nexorbitant prices for gold watches and chains, and then, to meet the\nexigencies of play, would carry them to the pawnbroker, that discreet\nand forbidding-looking friend of youth; but when it was a question of\npaying for board or lodging, or for the necessary implements for the\ncultivation of his Elysian fields, his imagination and pluck alike\ndeserted him. There was no inspiration to be found in vulgar\nnecessity, in debts contracted for past requirements. Like most of\nthose who trust to their luck, he put off till the last moment the\npayment of debts that among the bourgeoisie are regarded as sacred\nengagements, acting on the plan of Mirabeau, who never settled his\nbaker’s bill until it underwent a formidable transformation into a\nbill of exchange.",
        "It was about this time when Rastignac was down on his luck and fell\ninto debt, that it became clear to the law student’s mind that he must\nhave some more certain source of income if he meant to live as he had\nbeen doing. But while he groaned over the thorny problems of his\nprecarious situation, he felt that he could not bring himself to\nrenounce the pleasures of this extravagant life, and decided that he\nmust continue it at all costs. His dreams of obtaining a fortune\nappeared more and more chimerical, and the real obstacles grew more\nformidable. His initiation into the secrets of the Nucingen household\nhad revealed to him that if he were to attempt to use this love affair\nas a means of mending his fortunes, he must swallow down all sense of\ndecency, and renounce all the generous ideas which redeem the sins of\nyouth. He had chosen this life of apparent splendor, but secretly\ngnawed by the canker worm of remorse, a life of fleeting pleasure\ndearly paid for by persistent pain; like Le Distrait of La Bruyere,\nhe had descended so far as to make his bed in a ditch; but (also like\nLe Distrait) he himself was uncontaminated as yet by the mire that\nstained his garments.",
        "“So we have killed our mandarin, have we?” said Bianchon one day as\nthey left the dinner table.",
        "“Not yet,” he answered, “but he is at his last gasp.”",
        "The medical student took this for a joke, but it was not a jest.\nEugene had dined in the house that night for the first time for a long\nwhile, and had looked thoughtful during the meal. He had taken his\nplace beside Mlle. Taillefer, and stayed through the dessert, giving\nhis neighbor an expressive glance from time to time. A few of the\nboarders discussed the walnuts at the table, and others walked about\nthe room, still taking part in the conversation which had begun among\nthem. People usually went when they chose; the amount of time that\nthey lingered being determined by the amount of interest that the\nconversation possessed for them, or by the difficulty of the process\nof digestion. In winter-time the room was seldom empty before eight\no’clock, when the four women had it all to themselves, and made up for\nthe silence previously imposed upon them by the preponderating\nmasculine element. This evening Vautrin had noticed Eugene’s\nabstractedness, and stayed in the room, though he had seemed to be in\na hurry to finish his dinner and go. All through the talk afterwards\nhe had kept out of the sight of the law student, who quite believed\nthat Vautrin had left the room. He now took up his position cunningly\nin the sitting-room instead of going when the last boarders went. He\nhad fathomed the young man’s thoughts, and felt that a crisis was at\nhand. Rastignac was, in fact, in a dilemma, which many another young\nman must have known.",
        "Mme. de Nucingen might love him, or might merely be playing with him,\nbut in either case Rastignac had been made to experience all the\nalternations of hope and despair of genuine passion, and all the\ndiplomatic arts of a Parisienne had been employed on him. After\ncompromising herself by continually appearing in public with Mme. de\nBeauseant’s cousin she still hesitated, and would not give him the\nlover’s privileges which he appeared to enjoy. For a whole month she\nhad so wrought on his senses, that at last she had made an impression\non his heart. If in the earliest days the student had fancied himself\nto be master, Mme. de Nucingen had since become the stronger of the\ntwo, for she had skilfully roused and played upon every instinct, good\nor bad, in the two or three men comprised in a young student in Paris.\nThis was not the result of deep design on her part, nor was she\nplaying a part, for women are in a manner true to themselves even\nthrough their grossest deceit, because their actions are prompted by a\nnatural impulse. It may have been that Delphine, who had allowed this\nyoung man to gain such an ascendency over her, conscious that she had\nbeen too demonstrative, was obeying a sentiment of dignity, and either\nrepented of her concessions, or it pleased her to suspend them. It is\nso natural to a Parisienne, even when passion has almost mastered her,\nto hesitate and pause before taking the plunge; to probe the heart of\nhim to whom she intrusts her future. And once already Mme. de\nNucingen’s hopes had been betrayed, and her loyalty to a selfish young\nlover had been despised. She had good reason to be suspicious. Or it\nmay have been that something in Eugene’s manner (for his rapid success\nwas making a coxcomb of him) had warned her that the grotesque nature\nof their position had lowered her somewhat in his eyes. She doubtless\nwished to assert her dignity; he was young, and she would be great in\nhis eyes; for the lover who had forsaken her had held her so cheap\nthat she was determined that Eugene should not think her an easy\nconquest, and for this very reason–he knew that de Marsay had been\nhis predecessor. Finally, after the degradation of submission to the\npleasure of a heartless young rake, it was so sweet to her to wander\nin the flower-strewn realms of love, that it was not wonderful that\nshe should wish to dwell a while on the prospect, to tremble with the\nvibrations of love, to feel the freshness of the breath of its dawn.\nThe true lover was suffering for the sins of the false. This\ninconsistency is unfortunately only to be expected so long as men do\nnot know how many flowers are mown down in a young woman’s soul by the\nfirst stroke of treachery.",
        "Whatever her reasons may have been, Delphine was playing with\nRastignac, and took pleasure in playing with him, doubtless because\nshe felt sure of his love, and confident that she could put an end to\nthe torture as soon as it was her royal pleasure to do so. Eugene’s\nself-love was engaged; he could not suffer his first passage of love\nto end in a defeat, and persisted in his suit like a sportsman\ndetermined to bring down at least one partridge to celebrate his first\nFeast of Saint-Hubert. The pressure of anxiety, his wounded self-love,\nhis despair, real or feigned, drew him nearer and nearer to this\nwoman. All Paris credited him with this conquest, and yet he was\nconscious that he had made no progress since the day when he saw Mme.\nde Nucingen for the first time. He did not know as yet that a woman’s\ncoquetry is sometimes more delightful than the pleasure of secure\npossession of her love, and was possessed with helpless rage. If, at\nthis time, while she denied herself to love, Eugene gathered the\nspringtide spoils of his life, the fruit, somewhat sharp and green,\nand dearly bought, was no less delicious to the taste. There were\nmoments when he had not a sou in his pockets, and at such times he\nthought in spite of his conscience of Vautrin’s offer and the\npossibility of fortune by a marriage with Mlle. Taillefer. Poverty\nwould clamor so loudly that more than once he was on the point of\nyielding to the cunning temptations of the terrible sphinx, whose\nglance had so often exerted a strange spell over him.",
        "Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau went up to their rooms; and Rastignac,\nthinking that he was alone with the women in the dining-room, sat\nbetween Mme. Vauquer and Mme. Couture, who was nodding over the woolen\ncuffs that she was knitting by the stove, and looked at Mlle.\nTaillefer so tenderly that she lowered her eyes.",
        "“Can you be in trouble, M. Eugene?” Victorine said after a pause.",
        "“Who has not his troubles?” answered Rastignac. “If we men were sure\nof being loved, sure of a devotion which would be our reward for the\nsacrifices which we are always ready to make, then perhaps we should\nhave no troubles.”",
        "For answer Mlle. Taillefer only gave him a glance but it was\nimpossible to mistake its meaning.",
        "“You, for instance, mademoiselle; you feel sure of your heart to-day,\nbut are you sure that it will never change?”",
        "A smile flitted over the poor girl’s lips; it seemed as if a ray of\nlight from her soul had lighted up her face. Eugene was dismayed at\nthe sudden explosion of feeling caused by his words.",
        "“Ah! but suppose,” he said, “that you should be rich and happy\nto-morrow, suppose that a vast fortune dropped down from the clouds\nfor you, would you still love the man whom you loved in your days of\npoverty?”",
        "A charming movement of the head was her only answer.",
        "“Even if he were very poor?”",
        "Again the same mute answer.",
        "“What nonsense are you talking, you two?” exclaimed Mme. Vauquer.",
        "“Never mind,” answered Eugene; “we understand each other.”",
        "“So there is to be an engagement of marriage between M. le Chevalier\nEugene de Rastignac and Mlle. Victorine Taillefer, is there?” The\nwords were uttered in Vautrin’s deep voice, and Vautrin appeared at\nthe door as he spoke.",
        "“Oh! how you startled me!” Mme. Couture and Mme. Vauquer exclaimed\ntogether.",
        "“I might make a worse choice,” said Rastignac, laughing. Vautrin’s\nvoice had thrown him into the most painful agitation that he had yet\nknown.",
        "“No bad jokes, gentlemen!” said Mme. Couture. “My dear, let us go\nupstairs.”",
        "Mme. Vauquer followed the two ladies, meaning to pass the evening in\ntheir room, an arrangement that economized fire and candlelight.\nEugene and Vautrin were left alone.",
        "“I felt sure you would come round to it,” said the elder man with the\ncoolness that nothing seemed to shake. “But stay a moment! I have as\nmuch delicacy as anybody else. Don’t make up your mind on the spur of\nthe moment; you are a little thrown off your balance just now. You are\nin debt, and I want you to come over to my way of thinking after sober\nreflection, and not in a fit of passion or desperation. Perhaps you\nwant a thousand crowns. There, you can have them if you like.”",
        "The tempter took out a pocketbook, and drew thence three banknotes,\nwhich he fluttered before the student’s eyes. Eugene was in a most\npainful dilemma. He had debts, debts of honor. He owed a hundred louis\nto the Marquis d’Ajuda and to the Count de Trailles; he had not the\nmoney, and for this reason had not dared to go to Mme. de Restaud’s\nhouse, where he was expected that evening. It was one of those\ninformal gatherings where tea and little cakes are handed round, but\nwhere it is possible to lose six thousand francs at whist in the\ncourse of a night.",
        "“You must see,” said Eugene, struggling to hide a convulsive tremor,\n\"that after what has passed between us, I cannot possibly lay myself\nunder any obligation to you.”",
        "“Quite right; I should be sorry to hear you speak otherwise,” answered\nthe tempter. “You are a fine young fellow, honorable, brave as a lion,\nand as gentle as a young girl. You would be a fine haul for the devil!\nI like youngsters of your sort. Get rid of one or two more prejudices,\nand you will see the world as it is. Make a little scene now and then,\nand act a virtuous part in it, and a man with a head on his shoulders\ncan do exactly as he likes amid deafening applause from the fools in\nthe gallery. Ah! a few days yet, and you will be with us; and if you\nwould only be tutored by me, I would put you in the way of achieving\nall your ambitions. You should no sooner form a wish than it should be\nrealized to the full; you should have all your desires–honors,\nwealth, or women. Civilization should flow with milk and honey for\nyou. You should be our pet and favorite, our Benjamin. We would all\nwork ourselves to death for you with pleasure; every obstacle should\nbe removed from your path. You have a few prejudices left; so you\nthink that I am a scoundrel, do you? Well, M. de Turenne, quite as\nhonorable a man as you take yourself to be, had some little private\ntransactions with bandits, and did not feel that his honor was\ntarnished. You would rather not lie under any obligation to me, eh?\nYou need not draw back on that account,” Vautrin went on, and a smile\nstole over his lips. “Take these bits of paper and write across this,\"\nhe added, producing a piece of stamped paper, ’Accepted the sum of\nthree thousand five hundred francs due this day twelvemonth, and fill\nin the date. The rate of interest is stiff enough to silence any\nscruples on your part; it gives you the right to call me a Jew. You\ncan call quits with me on the score of gratitude. I am quite willing\nthat you should despise me to-day, because I am sure that you will\nhave a kindlier feeling towards me later on. You will find out\nfathomless depths in my nature, enormous and concentrated forces that\nweaklings call vices, but you will never find me base or ungrateful.\nIn short, I am neither a pawn nor a bishop, but a castle, a tower of\nstrength, my boy.”",
        "“What manner of man are you?” cried Eugene. “Were you created to\ntorment me?”",
        "“Why no; I am a good-natured fellow, who is willing to do a dirty\npiece of work to put you high and dry above the mire for the rest of\nyour days. Do you ask the reason of this devotion? All right; I will\ntell you that some of these days. A word or two in your ear will\nexplain it. I have begun by shocking you, by showing you the way to\nring the changes, and giving you a sight of the mechanism of the\nsocial machine; but your first fright will go off like a conscript’s\nterror on the battlefield. You will grow used to regarding men as\ncommon soldiers who have made up their minds to lose their lives for\nsome self-constituted king. Times have altered strangely. Once you\ncould say to a bravo, ’Here are a hundred crowns; go and kill Monsieur\nSo-and-so for me,’ and you could sup quietly after turning some one\noff into the dark for the least thing in the world. But nowadays I\npropose to put you in the way of a handsome fortune; you have only to\nnod your head, it won’t compromise you in any way, and you hesitate.\n’Tis an effeminate age.”",
        "Eugene accepted the draft, and received the banknotes in exchange for\nit.",
        "“Well, well. Come, now, let us talk rationally,” Vautrin continued. “I\nmean to leave this country in a few months’ time for America, and set\nabout planting tobacco. I will send you the cigars of friendship. If I\nmake money at it, I will help you in your career. If I have no\nchildren–which will probably be the case, for I have no anxiety to\nraise slips of myself here–you shall inherit my fortune. That is what\nyou may call standing by a man; but I myself have a liking for you. I\nhave a mania, too, for devoting myself to some one else. I have done\nit before. You see, my boy, I live in a loftier sphere than other men\ndo; I look on all actions as means to an end, and the end is all that\nI look at. What is a man’s life to me? Not that,” he said, and he\nsnapped his thumb-nail against his teeth. “A man, in short, is\neverything to me, or just nothing at all. Less than nothing if his\nname happens to be Poiret; you can crush him like a bug, he is flat\nand he is offensive. But a man is a god when he is like you; he is not\na machine covered with a skin, but a theatre in which the greatest\nsentiments are displayed–great thoughts and feelings–and for these,\nand these only, I live. A sentiment–what is that but the whole world\nin a thought? Look at Father Goriot. For him, his two girls are the\nwhole universe; they are the clue by which he finds his way through\ncreation. Well, for my own part, I have fathomed the depths of life,\nthere is only one real sentiment–comradeship between man and man.\nPierre and Jaffier, that is my passion. I knew Venice Preserved by\nheart. Have you met many men plucky enough when a comrade says, ’Let\nus bury a dead body!’ to go and do it without a word or plaguing him\nby taking a high moral tone? I have done it myself. I should not talk\nlike this to just everybody, but you are not like an ordinary man; one\ncan talk to you, you can understand things. You will not dabble about\nmuch longer among the tadpoles in these swamps. Well, then, it is all\nsettled. You will marry. Both of us carry our point. Mine is made of\niron, and will never soften, he! he!”",
        "Vautrin went out. He would not wait to hear the student’s repudiation,\nhe wished to put Eugene at his ease. He seemed to understand the\nsecret springs of the faint resistance still made by the younger man;\nthe struggles in which men seek to preserve their self-respect by\njustifying their blameworthy actions to themselves.",
        "“He may do as he likes; I shall not marry Mlle. Taillefer, that is\ncertain,” said Eugene to himself.",
        "He regarded this man with abhorrence, and yet the very cynicism of\nVautrin’s ideas, and the audacious way in which he used other men for\nhis own ends, raised him in the student’s eyes; but the thought of a\ncompact threw Eugene into a fever of apprehension, and not until he\nhad recovered somewhat did he dress, call for a cab, and go to Mme. de\nRestaud’s.",
        "For some days the Countess had paid more and more attention to a young\nman whose every step seemed a triumphal progress in the great world;\nit seemed to her that he might be a formidable power before long. He\npaid Messieurs de Trailles and d’Ajuda, played at whist for part of\nthe evening, and made good his losses. Most men who have their way to\nmake are more or less of fatalists, and Eugene was superstitious; he\nchose to consider that his luck was heaven’s reward for his\nperseverance in the right way. As soon as possible on the following\nmorning he asked Vautrin whether the bill he had given was still in\nthe other’s possession; and on receiving a reply in the affirmative,\nhe repaid the three thousand francs with a not unnatural relief.",
        "“Everything is going on well,” said Vautrin.",
        "“But I am not your accomplice,” said Eugene.",
        "“I know, I know,” Vautrin broke in. “You are still acting like a\nchild. You are making mountains out of molehills at the outset.”",
        "Two days later, Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau were sitting together on a\nbench in the sun. They had chosen a little frequented alley in the\nJardin des Plantes, and a gentleman was chatting with them, the same\nperson, as a matter of fact, about whom the medical student had, not\nwithout good reason, his own suspicions.",
        "“Mademoiselle,” this M. Gondureau was saying, “I do not see any cause\nfor your scruples. His Excellency, Monseigneur the Minister of\nPolice––”",
        "“Yes, his Excellency is taking a personal interest in the matter,\"\nsaid Gondureau.",
        "Who would think it probable that Poiret, a retired clerk, doubtless\npossessed of some notions of civic virtue, though there might be\nnothing else in his head–who would think it likely that such a man\nwould continue to lend an ear to this supposed independent gentleman\nof the Rue de Buffon, when the latter dropped the mask of a decent\ncitizen by that word “police,” and gave a glimpse of the features of a\ndetective from the Rue de Jerusalem? And yet nothing was more natural.\nPerhaps the following remarks from the hitherto unpublished records\nmade by certain observers will throw a light on the particular species\nto which Poiret belonged in the great family of fools. There is a race\nof quill-drivers, confined in the columns of the budget between the\nfirst degree of latitude (a kind of administrative Greenland where the\nsalaries begin at twelve hundred francs) to the third degree, a more\ntemperate zone, where incomes grow from three to six thousand francs,\na climate where the bonus flourishes like a half-hardy annual in\nspite of some difficulties of culture. A characteristic trait that\nbest reveals the feeble narrow-mindedness of these inhabitants of\npetty officialdom is a kind of involuntary, mechanical, and\ninstinctive reverence for the Grand Lama of every Ministry, known to\nthe rank and file only by his signature (an illegible scrawl) and by\nhis title–\"His Excellency Monseigneur le Ministre,” five words which\nproduce as much effect as the il Bondo Cani of the Calife de\nBagdad, five words which in the eyes of this low order of\nintelligence represent a sacred power from which there is no appeal.\nThe Minister is administratively infallible for the clerks in the\nemploy of the Government, as the Pope is infallible for good\nCatholics. Something of this peculiar radiance invests everything he\ndoes or says, or that is said or done in his name; the robe of office\ncovers everything and legalizes everything done by his orders; does\nnot his very title–His Excellency–vouch for the purity of his\nintentions and the righteousness of his will, and serve as a sort of\npassport and introduction to ideas that otherwise would not be\nentertained for a moment? Pronounce the words “His Excellency,” and\nthese poor folk will forthwith proceed to do what they would not do\nfor their own interests. Passive obedience is as well known in a\nGovernment department as in the army itself; and the administrative\nsystem silences consciences, annihilates the individual, and ends\n(give it time enough) by fashioning a man into a vise or a thumbscrew,\nand he becomes part of the machinery of Government. Wherefore, M.\nGondureau, who seemed to know something of human nature, recognized\nPoiret at once as one of those dupes of officialdom, and brought out\nfor his benefit, at the proper moment, the deus ex machina, the\nmagical words “His Excellency,” so as to dazzle Poiret just as he\nhimself unmasked his batteries, for he took Poiret and the Michonneau\nfor the male and female of the same species.",
        "“If his Excellency himself, his Excellency the Minister . . . Ah! that\nis quite another thing,” said Poiret.",
        "“You seem to be guided by this gentleman’s opinion, and you hear what\nhe says,” said the man of independent means, addressing Mlle.\nMichonneau. “Very well, his Excellency is at this moment absolutely\ncertain that the so-called Vautrin, who lodges at the Maison Vauquer,\nis a convict who escaped from penal servitude at Toulon, where he is\nknown by the nickname Trompe-la-Mort.”",
        "“Trompe-la-Mort?” said Pioret. “Dear me, he is very lucky if he\ndeserves that nickname.”",
        "“Well, yes,” said the detective. “They call him so because he has been\nso lucky as not to lose his life in the very risky businesses that he\nhas carried through. He is a dangerous man, you see! He has qualities\nthat are out of the common; the thing he is wanted for, in fact, was a\nmatter which gained him no end of credit with his own set––”",
        "“Then is he a man of honor?” asked Poiret.",
        "“Yes, according to his notions. He agreed to take another man’s crime\nupon himself–a forgery committed by a very handsome young fellow that\nhe had taken a great fancy to, a young Italian, a bit of a gambler,\nwho has since gone into the army, where his conduct has been\nunexceptionable.”",
        "“But if his Excellency the Minister of Police is certain that M.\nVautrin is this Trompe-la-Mort, why should he want me?” asked Mlle.\nMichonneau.",
        "“Oh yes,” said Poiret, “if the Minister, as you have been so obliging\nas to tell us, really knows for a certainty––”",
        "“Certainty is not the word; he only suspects. You will soon understand\nhow things are. Jacques Collin, nicknamed Trompe-la-Mort, is in the\nconfidence of every convict in the three prisons; he is their man of\nbusiness and their banker. He makes a very good thing out of managing\ntheir affairs, which want a man of mark to see about them.”",
        "“Ha! ha! do you see the pun, mademoiselle?” asked Poiret. “This\ngentleman calls himself a man of mark because he is a marked man–branded, you know.”",
        "“This so-called Vautrin,” said the detective, “receives the money\nbelonging to my lords the convicts, invests it for them, and holds it\nat the disposal of those who escape, or hands it over to their\nfamilies if they leave a will, or to their mistresses when they draw\nupon him for their benefit.”",
        "“Their mistresses! You mean their wives,” remarked Poiret.",
        "“No, sir. A convict’s wife is usually an illegitimate connection. We\ncall them concubines.”",
        "“Then they all live in a state of concubinage?”",
        "“Naturally.”",
        "“Why, these are abominations that his Excellency ought not to allow.\nSince you have the honor of seeing his Excellency, you, who seem to\nhave philanthropic ideas, ought really to enlighten him as to their\nimmoral conduct–they are setting a shocking example to the rest of\nsociety.”",
        "“But the Government does not hold them up as models of all the\nvirtues, my dear sir––”",
        "“Of course not, sir; but still––”",
        "“Just let the gentleman say what he has to say, dearie,” said Mlle.\nMichonneau.",
        "“You see how it is, mademoiselle,” Gondureau continued. “The\nGovernment may have the strongest reasons for getting this illicit\nhoard into its hands; it mounts up to something considerable, by all\nthat we can make out. Trompe-la-Mort not only holds large sums for his\nfriends the convicts, but he has other amounts which are paid over to\nhim by the Society of the Ten Thousand––”",
        "“Ten Thousand Thieves!” cried Pioret in alarm.",
        "“No. The Society of the Ten Thousand is not an association of petty\noffenders, but of people who set about their work on a large scale\n–they won’t touch a matter unless there are ten thousand francs in\nit. It is composed of the most distinguished of the men who are sent\nstraight to the Assize Courts when they come up for trial. They know\nthe Code too well to risk their necks when they are nabbed. Collin is\ntheir confidential agent and legal adviser. By means of the large sums\nof money at his disposal he has established a sort of detective system\nof his own; it is widespread and mysterious in its workings. We have\nhad spies all about him for a twelvemonth, and yet we could not manage\nto fathom his games. His capital and his cleverness are at the service\nof vice and crime; this money furnishes the necessary funds for a\nregular army of blackguards in his pay who wage incessant war against\nsociety. If we can catch Trompe-la-Mort, and take possession of his\nfunds, we should strike at the root of this evil. So this job is a\nkind of Government affair–a State secret–and likely to redound to\nthe honor of those who bring the thing to a successful conclusion.\nYou, sir, for instance, might very well be taken into a Government\ndepartment again; they might make you secretary to a Commissary of\nPolice; you could accept that post without prejudice to your retiring\npension.”",
        "Mlle. Michonneau interposed at this point with, “What is there to\nhinder Trompe-la-Mort from making off with the money?”",
        "“Oh!” said the detective, “a man is told off to follow him everywhere\nhe goes, with orders to kill him if he were to rob the convicts. Then\nit is not quite as easy to make off with a lot of money as it is to\nrun away with a young lady of family. Besides, Collin is not the sort\nof fellow to play such a trick; he would be disgraced, according to\nhis notions.”",
        "“You are quite right, sir,” said Poiret, “utterly disgraced he would\nbe.”",
        "“But none of all this explains why you do not come and take him\nwithout more ado,” remarked Mlle. Michonneau.",
        "“Very well, mademoiselle, I will explain–but,” he added in her ear,\n\"keep your companion quiet, or I shall never have done. The old boy\nought to pay people handsomely for listening to him.–Trompe-la-Mort,\nwhen he came back here,” he went on aloud “slipped into the skin of an\nhonest man; he turned up disguised as a decent Parisian citizen, and\ntook up his quarters in an unpretending lodging-house. He is cunning,\nthat he is! You don’t catch him napping. Then M. Vautrin is a man of\nconsequence, who transacts a good deal of business.”",
        "“Naturally,” said Poiret to himself.",
        "“And suppose that the Minister were to make a mistake and get hold of\nthe real Vautrin, he would put every one’s back up among the business\nmen in Paris, and public opinion would be against him. M. le Prefet de\nPolice is on slippery ground; he has enemies. They would take\nadvantage of any mistake. There would be a fine outcry and fuss made\nby the Opposition, and he would be sent packing. We must set about\nthis just as we did about the Coignard affair, the sham Comte de\nSainte-Helene; if he had been the real Comte de Sainte-Helene, we\nshould have been in the wrong box. We want to be quite sure what we\nare about.”",
        "“Yes, but what you want is a pretty woman,” said Mlle. Michonneau\nbriskly.",
        "“Trompe-la-Mort would not let a woman come near him,” said the\ndetective. “I will tell you a secret–he does not like them.”",
        "“Still, I do not see what I can do, supposing that I did agree to\nidentify him for two thousand francs.”",
        "“Nothing simpler,” said the stranger. “I will send you a little bottle\ncontaining a dose that will send a rush of blood to the head; it will\ndo him no harm whatever, but he will fall down as if he were in a fit.\nThe drug can be put into wine or coffee; either will do equally well.\nYou carry your man to bed at once, and undress him to see that he is\nnot dying. As soon as you are alone, you give him a slap on the\nshoulder, and presto! the letters will appear.”",
        "“Why, that is just nothing at all,” said Poiret.",
        "“Well, do you agree?” said Gondureau, addressing the old maid.",
        "“But, my dear sir, suppose there are no letters at all,” said Mlle.\nMichonneau; “am I to have the two thousand francs all the same?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“What will you give me then?”",
        "“Five hundred francs.”",
        "“It is such a thing to do for so little! It lies on your conscience\njust the same, and I must quiet my conscience, sir.”",
        "“I assure you,” said Poiret, “that mademoiselle has a great deal of\nconscience, and not only so, she is a very amiable person, and very\nintelligent.”",
        "“Well, now,” Mlle. Michonneau went on, “make it three thousand francs\nif he is Trompe-la-Mort, and nothing at all if he is an ordinary man.”",
        "“Done!” said Gondureau, “but on the condition that the thing is\nsettled to-morrow.”",
        "“Not quite so soon, my dear sir; I must consult my confessor first.”",
        "“You are a sly one,” said the detective as he rose to his feet.\n\"Good-bye till to-morrow, then. And if you should want to see me in a\nhurry, go to the Petite Rue Saint-Anne at the bottom of the Cour de la\nSainte-Chapelle. There is one door under the archway. Ask there for M.\nGondureau.”",
        "Bianchon, on his way back from Cuvier’s lecture, overheard the\nsufficiently striking nickname of Trompe-la-Mort, and caught the\ncelebrated chief detective’s ’Done!“",
        "“Why didn’t you close with him? It would be three hundred francs a\nyear,” said Poiret to Mlle. Michonneau.",
        "“Why didn’t I?” she asked. “Why, it wants thinking over. Suppose that\nM. Vautrin is this Trompe-la-Mort, perhaps we might do better for\nourselves with him. Still, on the other hand, if you ask him for\nmoney, it would put him on his guard, and he is just the man to clear\nout without paying, and that would be an abominable sell.”",
        "“And suppose you did warn him,” Poiret went on, “didn’t that gentleman\nsay that he was closely watched? You would spoil everything.”",
        "“Anyhow,” thought Mlle. Michonneau, “I can’t abide him. He says\nnothing but disagreeable things to me.”",
        "“But you can do better than that,” Poiret resumed. “As that gentleman\nsaid (and he seemed to me to be a very good sort of man, besides being\nvery well got up), it is an act of obedience to the laws to rid\nsociety of a criminal, however virtuous he may be. Once a thief,\nalways a thief. Suppose he were to take it into his head to murder us\nall? The deuce! We should be guilty of manslaughter, and be the first\nto fall victims into the bargain!”",
        "Mlle. Michonneau’s musings did not permit her to listen very closely\nto the remarks that fell one by one from Poiret’s lips like water\ndripping from a leaky tap. When once this elderly babbler began to\ntalk, he would go on like clockwork unless Mlle. Michonneau stopped\nhim. He started on some subject or other, and wandered on through\nparenthesis after parenthesis, till he came to regions as remote as\npossible from his premises without coming to any conclusions by the\nway.",
        "By the time they reached the Maison Vauquer he had tacked together a\nwhole string of examples and quotations more or less irrelevant to the\nsubject in hand, which led him to give a full account of his own\ndeposition in the case of the Sieur Ragoulleau versus Dame Morin,\nwhen he had been summoned as a witness for the defence.",
        "As they entered the dining-room, Eugene de Rastignac was talking apart\nwith Mlle. Taillefer; the conversation appeared to be of such\nthrilling interest that the pair never noticed the two older lodgers\nas they passed through the room. None of this was thrown away on Mlle.\nMichonneau.",
        "“I knew how it would end,” remarked that lady, addressing Poiret.\n\"They have been making eyes at each other in a heartrending way for a\nweek past.”",
        "“Yes,” he answered. “So she was found guilty.”",
        "“Who?”",
        "“Mme. Morin.”",
        "“I am talking about Mlle. Victorine,” said Mlle, Michonneau, as she\nentered Poiret’s room with an absent air, “and you answer, ’Mme.\nMorin.’ Who may Mme. Morin be?”",
        "“What can Mlle. Victorine be guilty of?” demanded Poiret.",
        "“Guilty of falling in love with M. Eugene de Rastignac and going\nfurther and further without knowing exactly where she is going, poor\ninnocent!”",
        "That morning Mme. de Nucingen had driven Eugene to despair. In his own\nmind he had completely surrendered himself to Vautrin, and\ndeliberately shut his eyes to the motive for the friendship which that\nextraordinary man professed for him, nor would he look to the\nconsequences of such an alliance. Nothing short of a miracle could\nextricate him now out of the gulf into which he had walked an hour\nago, when he exchanged vows in the softest whispers with Mlle.\nTaillefer. To Victorine it seemed as if she heard an angel’s voice,\nthat heaven was opening above her; the Maison Vauquer took strange and\nwonderful hues, like a stage fairy-palace. She loved and she was\nloved; at any rate, she believed that she was loved; and what woman\nwould not likewise have believed after seeing Rastignac’s face and\nlistening to the tones of his voice during that hour snatched under\nthe Argus eyes of the Maison Vauquer? He had trampled on his\nconscience; he knew that he was doing wrong, and did it deliberately;\nhe had said to himself that a woman’s happiness should atone for this\nvenial sin. The energy of desperation had lent new beauty to his face;\nthe lurid fire that burned in his heart shone from his eyes. Luckily\nfor him, the miracle took place. Vautrin came in in high spirits, and\nat once read the hearts of these two young creatures whom he had\nbrought together by the combinations of his infernal genius, but his\ndeep voice broke in upon their bliss.",
        "     “A charming girl is my Fanchette\n      In her simplicity,”",
        "he sang mockingly.",
        "Victorine fled. Her heart was more full than it had ever been, but it\nwas full of joy, and not of sorrow. Poor child! A pressure of the\nhand, the light touch of Rastignac’s hair against her cheek, a word\nwhispered in her ear so closely that she felt the student’s warm\nbreath on her, the pressure of a trembling arm about her waist, a kiss\nupon her throat–such had been her betrothal. The near neighborhood of\nthe stout Sylvie, who might invade that glorified room at any moment,\nonly made these first tokens of love more ardent, more eloquent, more\nentrancing than the noblest deeds done for love’s sake in the most\nfamous romances. This plain-song of love, to use the pretty\nexpression of our forefathers, seemed almost criminal to the devout\nyoung girl who went to confession every fortnight. In that one hour\nshe had poured out more of the treasures of her soul than she could\ngive in later days of wealth and happiness, when her whole self\nfollowed the gift.",
        "“The thing is arranged,” Vautrin said to Eugene, who remained. “Our\ntwo dandies have fallen out. Everything was done in proper form. It is\na matter of opinion. Our pigeon has insulted my hawk. They will meet\nto-morrow in the redoubt at Clignancourt. By half-past eight in the\nmorning Mlle. Taillefer, calmly dipping her bread and butter in her\ncoffee cup, will be sole heiress of her father’s fortune and\naffections. A funny way of putting it, isn’t it? Taillefer’s youngster\nis an expert swordsman, and quite cocksure about it, but he will be\nbled; I have just invented a thrust for his benefit, a way of raising\nyour sword point and driving it at the forehead. I must show you that\nthrust; it is an uncommonly handy thing to know.”",
        "Rastignac heard him in dazed bewilderment; he could not find a word in\nreply. Just then Goriot came in, and Bianchon and a few of the\nboarders likewise appeared.",
        "“That is just as I intended.” Vautrin said. “You know quite well what\nyou are about. Good, my little eaglet! You are born to command, you\nare strong, you stand firm on your feet, you are game! I respect you.”",
        "He made as though he would take Eugene’s hand, but Rastignac hastily\nwithdrew it, sank into a chair, and turned ghastly pale; it seemed to\nhim that there was a sea of blood before his eyes.",
        "“Oh! so we still have a few dubious tatters of the swaddling clothes\nof virtue about us!” murmured Vautrin. “But Papa Doliban has three\nmillions; I know the amount of his fortune. Once have her dowry in\nyour hands, and your character will be as white as the bride’s white\ndress, even in your own eyes.”",
        "Rastignac hesitated no longer. He made up his mind that he would go\nthat evening to warn the Taillefers, father and son. But just as\nVautrin left him, Father Goriot came up and said in his ear, “You look\nmelancholy, my boy; I will cheer you up. Come with me.”",
        "The old vermicelli dealer lighted his dip at one of the lamps as he\nspoke. Eugene went with him, his curiosity had been aroused.",
        "“Let us go up to your room,” the worthy soul remarked, when he had\nasked Sylvie for the law student’s key. “This morning,” he resumed,\n\"you thought that she did not care about you, did you not? Eh? She\nwould have nothing to say to you, and you went away out of humor and\nout of heart. Stuff and rubbish! She wanted you to go because she was\nexpecting me! Now do you understand? We were to complete the\narrangements for taking some chambers for you, a jewel of a place, you\nare to move into it in three days’ time. Don’t split upon me. She\nwants it to be a surprise; but I couldn’t bear to keep the secret from\nyou. You will be in the Rue d’Artois, only a step or two from the Rue\nSaint-Lazare, and you are to be housed like a prince! Any one might\nhave thought we were furnishing the house for a bride. Oh! we have\ndone a lot of things in the last month, and you knew nothing about it.\nMy attorney has appeared on the scene, and my daughter is to have\nthirty-six thousand francs a year, the interest on her money, and I\nshall insist on having her eight hundred thousand invested in sound\nsecurities, landed property that won’t run away.”",
        "Eugene was dumb. He folded his arms and paced up and down in his\ncheerless, untidy room. Father Goriot waited till the student’s back\nwas turned, and seized the opportunity to go to the chimney-piece and\nset upon it a little red morocco case with Rastignac’s arms stamped in\ngold on the leather.",
        "“My dear boy,” said the kind soul, “I have been up to the eyes in this\nbusiness. You see, there was plenty of selfishness on my part; I have\nan interested motive in helping you to change lodgings. You will not\nrefuse me if I ask you something; will you, eh?”",
        "“What is it?”",
        "“There is a room on the fifth floor, up above your rooms, that is to\nlet along with them; that is where I am going to live, isn’t that so?\nI am getting old: I am too far from my girls. I shall not be in the\nway, but I shall be there, that is all. You will come and talk to me\nabout her every evening. It will not put you about, will it? I shall\nhave gone to bed before you come in, but I shall hear you come up, and\nI shall say to myself, ’He has just seen my little Delphine. He has\nbeen to a dance with her, and she is happy, thanks to him.’ If I were\nill, it would do my heart good to hear you moving about below, to know\nwhen you leave the house and when you come in. It is only a step to\nthe Champs-Elysees, where they go every day, so I shall be sure of\nseeing them, whereas now I am sometimes too late. And then–perhaps\nshe may come to see you! I shall hear her, I shall see her in her soft\nquilted pelisse tripping about as daintily as a kitten. In this one\nmonth she has become my little girl again, so light-hearted and gay.\nHer soul is recovering, and her happiness is owing to you! Oh! I would\ndo impossibilities for you. Only just now she said to me, ’I am very\nhappy, papa!’ When they say ’father’ stiffly, it sends a chill through\nme; but when they call me ’papa,’ it brings all the old memories back.\nI feel most their father then; I even believe that they belong to me,\nand to no one else.”",
        "The good man wiped his eyes, he was crying.",
        "“It is a long while since I have heard them talk like that, a long,\nlong time since she took my arm as she did to-day. Yes, indeed, it\nmust be quite ten years since I walked side by side with one of my\ngirls. How pleasant it was to keep step with her, to feel the touch of\nher gown, the warmth of her arm! Well, I took Delphine everywhere this\nmorning; I went shopping with her, and I brought her home again. Oh!\nyou must let me live near you. You may want some one to do you a\nservice some of these days, and I shall be on the spot to do it. Oh!\nif only that great dolt of an Alsatian would die, if his gout would\nhave the sense to attack his stomach, how happy my poor child would\nbe! You would be my son-in-law; you would be her husband in the eyes\nof the world. Bah! she has known no happiness, that excuses\neverything. Our Father in heaven is surely on the side of fathers on\nearth who love their children. How fond of you she is!” he said,\nraising his head after a pause. “All the time we were going about\ntogether she chatted away about you. ’He is so nice-looking, papa;\nisn’t he? He is kind-hearted! Does he talk to you about me?’ Pshaw!\nshe said enough about you to fill whole volumes; between the Rue\nd’Artois and the Passage des Panoramas she poured her heart out into\nmine. I did not feel old once during that delightful morning; I felt\nas light as a feather. I told her how you had given the banknote to\nme; it moved my darling to tears. But what can this be on your\nchimney-piece?” said Father Goriot at last. Rastignac had showed no\nsign, and he was dying of impatience.",
        "Eugene stared at his neighbor in dumb and dazed bewilderment. He\nthought of Vautrin, of that duel to be fought to-morrow morning, and\nof this realization of his dearest hopes, and the violent contrast\nbetween the two sets of ideas gave him all the sensations of\nnightmare. He went to the chimney-piece, saw the little square case,\nopened it, and found a watch of Breguet’s make wrapped in paper, on\nwhich these words were written:",
        "  “I want you to think of me every hour, because . . .",
        "“Delphine.”",
        "That last word doubtless contained an allusion to some scene that\nhad taken place between them. Eugene felt touched. Inside the gold\nwatch-case his arms had been wrought in enamel. The chain, the key,\nthe workmanship and design of the trinket were all such as he had\nimagined, for he had long coveted such a possession. Father Goriot was\nradiant. Of course he had promised to tell his daughter every little\ndetail of the scene and of the effect produced upon Eugene by her\npresent; he shared in the pleasure and excitement of the young people,\nand seemed to be not the least happy of the three. He loved Rastignac\nalready for his own as well as for his daughter’s sake.",
        "“You must go and see her; she is expecting you this evening. That\ngreat lout of an Alsatian is going to have supper with his\nopera-dancer. Aha! he looked very foolish when my attorney let him know\nwhere he was. He says he idolizes my daughter, does he? He had better\nlet her alone, or I will kill him. To think that my Delphine is his\"\n–he heaved a sigh–\"it is enough to make me murder him, but it would\nnot be manslaughter to kill that animal; he is a pig with a calf’s\nbrains.–You will take me with you, will you not?”",
        "“Yes, dear Father Goriot; you know very well how fond I am of you––”",
        "“Yes, I do know very well. You are not ashamed of me, are you? Not\nyou! Let me embrace you,” and he flung his arms around the student’s\nneck.",
        "“You will make her very happy; promise me that you will! You will go\nto her this evening, will you not?”",
        "“Oh! yes. I must go out; I have some urgent business on hand.”",
        "“Can I be of any use?”",
        "“My word, yes! Will you go to old Taillefer’s while I go to Mme. de\nNucingen? Ask him to make an appointment with me some time this\nevening; it is a matter of life and death.”",
        "“Really, young man!” cried Father Goriot, with a change of\ncountenance; “are you really paying court to his daughter, as those\nsimpletons were saying down below? . . . Tonnerre de dieu! you have\nno notion what a tap a la Goriot is like, and if you are playing a\ndouble game, I shall put a stop to it by one blow of the fist. . . Oh!\nthe thing is impossible!”",
        "“I swear to you that I love but one woman in the world,” said the\nstudent. “I only knew it a moment ago.”",
        "“Oh! what happiness!” cried Goriot.",
        "“But young Taillefer has been called out; the duel comes off\nto-morrow morning, and I have heard it said that he may lose his life\nin it.”",
        "“But what business is it of yours?” said Goriot.",
        "“Why, I ought to tell him so, that he may prevent his son from putting\nin an appearance––”",
        "Just at that moment Vautrin’s voice broke in upon them; he was\nstanding at the threshold of his door and singing:",
        "     “Oh! Richard, oh my king!\n      All the world abandons thee!\n      Broum! broum! broum! broum! broum!",
        "      The same old story everywhere,\n      A roving heart and a . . . tra la la.”",
        "“Gentlemen!” shouted Christophe, “the soup is ready, and every one is\nwaiting for you.”",
        "“Here,” Vautrin called down to him, “come and take a bottle of my\nBordeaux.”",
        "“Do you think your watch is pretty?” asked Goriot. “She has good\ntaste, hasn’t she? Eh?”",
        "Vautrin, Father Goriot, and Rastignac came downstairs in company, and,\nall three of them being late, were obliged to sit together.",
        "Eugene was as distant as possible in his manner to Vautrin during\ndinner; but the other, so charming in Mme. Vauquer’s opinion, had\nnever been so witty. His lively sallies and sparkling talk put the\nwhole table in good humor. His assurance and coolness filled Eugene\nwith consternation.",
        "“Why, what has come to you to-day?” inquired Mme. Vauquer. “You are as\nmerry as a skylark.”",
        "“I am always in spirits after I have made a good bargain.”",
        "“Bargain?” said Eugene.",
        "“Well, yes, bargain. I have just delivered a lot of goods, and I shall\nbe paid a handsome commission on them–Mlle. Michonneau,” he went on,\nseeing that the elderly spinster was scrutinizing him intently, “have\nyou any objection to some feature in my face, that you are making\nthose lynx eyes at me? Just let me know, and I will have it changed to\noblige you . . . We shall not fall out about it, Poiret, I dare say?\"\nhe added, winking at the superannuated clerk.",
        "“Bless my soul, you ought to stand as model for a burlesque Hercules,\"\nsaid the young painter.",
        "“I will, upon my word! if Mlle. Michonneau will consent to sit as the\nVenus of Pere-Lachaise,” replied Vautrin.",
        "“There’s Poiret,” suggested Bianchon.",
        "“Oh! Poiret shall pose as Poiret. He can be a garden god!” cried\nVautrin; “his name means a pear––”",
        "“A sleepy pear!” Bianchon put in. “You will come in between the pear\nand the cheese.”",
        "“What stuff are you all talking!” said Mme. Vauquer; “you would do\nbetter to treat us to your Bordeaux; I see a glimpse of a bottle\nthere. It would keep us all in a good humor, and it is good for the\nstomach besides.”",
        "“Gentlemen,” said Vautrin, “the Lady President calls us to order. Mme.\nCouture and Mlle. Victorine will take your jokes in good part, but\nrespect the innocence of the aged Goriot. I propose a glass or two of\nBordeauxrama, rendered twice illustrious by the name of Laffite, no\npolitical allusions intended.–Come, you Turk!” he added, looking at\nChristophe, who did not offer to stir. “Christophe! Here! What, you\ndon’t answer to your own name? Bring us some liquor, Turk!”",
        "“Here it is, sir,” said Christophe, holding out the bottle.",
        "Vautrin filled Eugene’s glass and Goriot’s likewise, then he\ndeliberately poured out a few drops into his own glass, and sipped it\nwhile his two neighbors drank their wine. All at once he made a\ngrimace.",
        "“Corked!” he cried. “The devil! You can drink the rest of this,\nChristophe, and go and find another bottle; take from the right-hand\nside, you know. There are sixteen of us; take down eight bottles.”",

        "“Quien! just like you! Why not ask for the whole house at once. A\ncouple of bottles of champagne; that means twelve francs! I shall\nnever see the money back again, I know! But if M. Eugene has a mind to\npay for it, I have some currant cordial.”",
        "“That currant cordial of hers is as bad as a black draught,” muttered\nthe medical student.",

        "“Those little cakes are mouldy graybeards,” said Vautrin. “But trot\nout the biscuits.”",
        "The Bordeaux wine circulated; the dinner table became a livelier scene\nthan ever, and the fun grew fast and furious.

        "“Old clo’!”",
        "“Cherries all ripe!”",
        "But the palm was awarded to Bianchon for the nasal accent with which\nhe rendered the cry of “Umbrellas to me-end!”",
        "A few seconds later, and there was a head-splitting racket in the\nroom, a storm of tomfoolery, a sort of cats’ concert, with Vautrin as\nconductor of the orchestra, the latter keeping an eye the while on\nEugene and Father Goriot. The wine seemed to have gone to their heads\nalready. They leaned back in their chairs, looking at the general\nconfusion with an air of gravity, and drank but little; both of them\nwere absorbed in the thought of what lay before them to do that\nevening, and yet neither of them felt able to rise and go. Vautrin\ngave a side glance at them from time to time, and watched the change\nthat came over their faces, choosing the moment when their eyes\ndrooped and seemed about to close, to bend over Rastignac and to say\nin his ear:–",
        "“My little lad, you are not quite shrewd enough to outwit Papa Vautrin\nyet, and he is too fond of you to let you make a mess of your affairs.\nWhen I have made up my mind to do a thing, no one short of Providence\ncan put me off. Aha! we were for going round to warn old Taillefer,\ntelling tales out of school! The oven is hot, the dough is kneaded,\nthe bread is ready for the oven; to-morrow we will eat it up and\nwhisk away the crumbs; and we are not going to spoil the baking?\n. . . No, no, it is all as good as done! We may suffer from a few\nconscientious scruples, but they will be digested along with the\nbread. While we are having our forty winks, Colonel Count Franchessini\nwill clear the way to Michel Taillefer’s inheritance with the point of\nhis sword. Victorine will come in for her brother’s money, a snug\nfifteen thousand francs a year. I have made inquiries already, and I\nknow that her late mother’s property amounts to more than three\nhundred thousand––”",
        "Eugene heard all this, and could not answer a word; his tongue seemed\nto be glued to the roof of his mouth, an irresistible drowsiness was\ncreeping over him. He still saw the table and the faces round it, but\nit was through a bright mist. Soon the noise began to subside, one by\none the boarders went. At last, when their numbers had so dwindled\nthat the party consisted of Mme. Vauquer, Mme. Couture, Mlle.\nVictorine, Vautrin, and Father Goriot, Rastignac watched as though in\na dream how Mme. Vauquer busied herself by collecting the bottles, and\ndrained the remainder of the wine out of each to fill others.",
        "“Oh! how uproarious they are! what a thing it is to be young!” said\nthe widow.",
        "These were the last words that Eugene heard and understood.",
        "“There is no one like M. Vautrin for a bit of fun like this,” said\nSylvie. “There, just hark at Christophe, he is snoring like a top.”",
        "“Good-bye, mamma,” said Vautrin; “I am going to a theatre on the\nboulevard to see M. Marty in Le Mont Sauvage, a fine play taken from\nLe Solitaire. . . . If you like, I will take you and these two\nladies––”",
        "“Thank you; I must decline,” said Mme. Couture.",
        "“What! my good lady!” cried Mme. Vauquer, “decline to see a play\nfounded on the Le Solitaire, a work by Atala de Chateaubriand? We were\nso fond of that book that we cried over it like Magdalens under the\nline-trees last summer, and then it is an improving work that might\nedify your young lady.”",
        "“We are forbidden to go to the play,” answered Victorine.",
        "“Just look, those two yonder have dropped off where they sit,” said\nVautrin, shaking the heads of the two sleepers in a comical way.",
        "He altered the sleeping student’s position, settled his head more\ncomfortably on the back of his chair, kissed him warmly on the\nforehead, and began to sing:",
        "     “Sleep, little darlings;\n      I watch while you slumber.”",
        "“I am afraid he may be ill,” said Victorine.",
        "“Then stop and take care of him,” returned Vautrin. “’Tis your duty\nas a meek and obedient wife,” he whispered in her ear. “The young\nfellow worships you, and you will be his little wife–there’s your\nfortune for you. In short,” he added aloud, “they lived happily ever\nafterwards, were much looked up to in all the countryside, and had a\nnumerous family. That is how all the romances end.–Now, mamma,” he\nwent on, as he turned to Madame Vauquer and put his arm round her\nwaist, “put on your bonnet, your best flowered silk, and the countess’\nscarf, while I go out and call a cab–all my own self.”",
        "And he started out, singing as he went:",
        "     “Oh! sun! divine sun!\n      Ripening the pumpkins every one.”",
        "“My goodness! Well, I’m sure! Mme. Couture, I could live happily in a\ngarret with a man like that.–There, now!” she added, looking round\nfor the old vermicelli maker, “there is that Father Goriot half seas\nover. He never thought of taking me anywhere, the old skinflint. But\nhe will measure his length somewhere. My word! it is disgraceful to\nlose his senses like that, at his age! You will be telling me that he\ncouldn’t lose what he hadn’t got–Sylvie, just take him up to his\nroom!”",
        "Sylvie took him by the arm, supported him upstairs, and flung him just\nas he was, like a package, across the bed.",
        "“Poor young fellow!” said Mme. Couture, putting back Eugene’s hair\nthat had fallen over his eyes; “he is like a young girl, he does not\nknow what dissipation is.”",
        "“Well, I can tell you this, I know,” said Mme. Vauquer, “I have taken\nlodgers these thirty years, and a good many have passed through my\nhands, as the saying is, but I have never seen a nicer nor a more\naristocratic looking young man than M. Eugene. How handsome he looks\nsleeping! Just let his head rest on your shoulder, Mme. Couture.\nPshaw! he falls over towards Mlle. Victorine. There’s a special\nprovidence for young things. A little more, and he would have broken\nhis head against the knob of the chair. They’d make a pretty pair\nthose two would!”",
        "“Hush, my good neighbor,” cried Mme. Couture, “you are saying such\nthings––”",
        "“Pooh!” put in Mme. Vauquer, “he does not hear.–Here, Sylvie! come\nand help me to dress. I shall put on my best stays.”",
        "“What! your best stays just after dinner, madame?” said Sylvie. “No,\nyou can get some one else to lace you. I am not going to be your\nmurderer. It’s a rash thing to do, and might cost you your life.”",
        "“I don’t care, I must do honor to M. Vautrin.”",
        "“Are you so fond of your heirs as all that?”",
        "“Come, Sylvie, don’t argue,” said the widow, as she left the room.",
        "“At her age, too!” said the cook to Victorine, pointing to her\nmistress as she spoke.",
        "Mme. Couture and her ward were left in the dining-room, and Eugene\nslept on Victorine’s shoulder. The sound of Christophe’s snoring\nechoed through the silent house; Eugene’s quiet breathing seemed all\nthe quieter by force of contrast, he was sleeping as peacefully as a\nchild. Victorine was very happy; she was free to perform one of those\nacts of charity which form an innocent outlet for all the overflowing\nsentiments of a woman’s nature; he was so close to her that she could\nfeel the throbbing of his heart; there was a look of almost maternal\nprotection and conscious pride in Victorine’s face. Among the\ncountless thoughts that crowded up in her young innocent heart, there\nwas a wild flutter of joy at this close contact.",
        "“Poor, dear child!” said Mme. Couture, squeezing her hand.",
        "The old lady looked at the girl. Victorine’s innocent, pathetic face,\nso radiant with the new happiness that had befallen her, called to\nmind some naive work of mediaeval art, when the painter neglected the\naccessories, reserving all the magic of his brush for the quiet,\naustere outlines and ivory tints of the face, which seems to have\ncaught something of the golden glory of heaven.",
        "“After all, he only took two glasses, mamma,” said Victorine, passing\nher fingers through Eugene’s hair.",
        "“Indeed, if he had been a dissipated young man, child, he would have\ncarried his wine like the rest of them. His drowsiness does him\ncredit.”",
        "There was a sound of wheels outside in the street.",
        "“There is M. Vautrin, mamma,” said the girl. “Just take M. Eugene. I\nwould rather not have that man see me like this; there are some ways\nof looking at you that seem to sully your soul and make you feel as\nthough you had nothing on.”",
        "“Oh, no, you are wrong!” said Mme. Couture. “M. Vautrin is a worthy\nman; he reminds me a little of my late husband, poor dear M. Couture,\nrough but kind-hearted; his bark is worse than his bite.”",
        "Vautrin came in while she was speaking; he did not make a sound, but\nlooked for a while at the picture of the two young faces–the\nlamplight falling full upon them seemed to caress them.",
        "“Well,” he remarked, folding his arms, “here is a picture! It would\nhave suggested some pleasing pages to Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (good\nsoul), who wrote Paul et Virginie. Youth is very charming, Mme.\nCouture!–Sleep on, poor boy,” he added, looking at Eugene, “luck\nsometimes comes while you are sleeping.–There is something touching\nand attractive to me about this young man, madame,” he continued; “I\nknow that his nature is in harmony with his face. Just look, the head\nof a cherub on an angel’s shoulder! He deserves to be loved. If I were\na woman, I would die (no–not such a fool), I would live for him.” He\nbent lower and spoke in the widow’s ear. “When I see those two\ntogether, madame, I cannot help thinking that Providence meant them\nfor each other; He works by secret ways, and tries the reins and the\nheart,” he said in a loud voice. “And when I see you, my children,\nthus united by a like purity and by all human affections, I say to\nmyself that it is quite impossible that the future should separate\nyou. God is just.\"–He turned to Victorine. “It seems to me,” he said,\n\"that I have seen the line of success in your hand. Let me look at it,\nMlle. Victorine; I am well up in palmistry, and I have told fortunes\nmany a time. Come, now, don’t be frightened. Ah! what do I see? Upon\nmy word, you will be one of the richest heiresses in Paris before very\nlong. You will heap riches on the man who loves you. Your father will\nwant you to go and live with him. You will marry a young and handsome\nman with a title, and he will idolize you.”",
        "The heavy footsteps of the coquettish widow, who was coming down the\nstairs, interrupted Vautrin’s fortune-telling. “Here is Mamma\nVauquerre, fair as a starr-r-r, dressed within an inch of her life.\n–Aren’t we a trifle pinched for room?” he inquired, with his arm\nround the lady; “we are screwed up very tightly about the bust, mamma!\nIf we are much agitated, there may be an explosion; but I will pick up\nthe fragments with all the care of an antiquary.”",
        "“There is a man who can talk the language of French gallantry!” said\nthe widow, bending to speak in Mme. Couture’s ear.",
        "“Good-bye, little ones!” said Vautrin, turning to Eugene and\nVictorine. “Bless you both!” and he laid a hand on either head. “Take\nmy word for it, young lady, an honest man’s prayers are worth\nsomething; they should bring you happiness, for God hears them.”",
        "“Good-bye, dear,” said Mme. Vauquer to her lodger. “Do you think that\nM. Vautrin means to run away with me?” she added, lowering her voice.",
        "“Lack-a-day!” said the widow.",
        "“Oh! mamma dear, suppose it should really happen as that kind M.\nVautrin said!” said Victorine with a sigh as she looked at her hands.\nThe two women were alone together.",
        "“Why, it wouldn’t take much to bring it to pass,” said the elderly\nlady; “just a fall from his horse, and your monster of a brother––”",
        "“Oh! mamma.”",
        "“Good Lord! Well, perhaps it is a sin to wish bad luck to an enemy,\"\nthe widow remarked. “I will do penance for it. Still, I would strew\nflowers on his grave with the greatest pleasure, and that is the\ntruth. Black-hearted, that he is! The coward couldn’t speak up for his\nown mother, and cheats you out of your share by deceit and trickery.\nMy cousin had a pretty fortune of her own, but unluckily for you,\nnothing was said in the marriage-contract about anything that she\nmight come in for.”",
        "“It would be very hard if my fortune is to cost some one else his\nlife,” said Victorine. “If I cannot be happy unless my brother is to\nbe taken out of the world, I would rather stay here all my life.”",
        "“Mon Dieu! it is just as that good M. Vautrin says, and he is full\nof piety, you see,” Mme. Couture remarked. “I am very glad to find\nthat he is not an unbeliever like the rest of them that talk of the\nAlmighty with less respect than they do of the Devil. Well, as he was\nsaying, who can know the ways by which it may please Providence to\nlead us?”",
        "With Sylvie’s help the two women at last succeeded in getting Eugene\nup to his room; they laid him on the bed, and the cook unfastened his\nclothes to make him more comfortable. Before they left the room,\nVictorine snatched an opportunity when her guardian’s back was turned,\nand pressed a kiss on Eugene’s forehead, feeling all the joy that this\nstolen pleasure could give her. Then she looked round the room, and\ngathering up, as it were, into one single thought all the untold bliss\nof that day, she made a picture of her memories, and dwelt upon it\nuntil she slept, the happiest creature in Paris.",
        "That evening’s merry-making, in the course of which Vautrin had given\nthe drugged wine to Eugene and Father Goriot, was his own ruin.\nBianchon, flustered with wine, forgot to open the subject of\nTrompe-la-Mort with Mlle. Michonneau. The mere mention of the name\nwould have set Vautrin on his guard; for Vautrin, or, to give him his\nreal name, Jacques Collin, was in fact the notorious escaped convict.",
        "But it was the joke about the Venus of Pere-Lachaise that finally\ndecided his fate. Mlle. Michonneau had very nearly made up her mind to\nwarn the convict and to throw herself on his generosity, with the idea\nof making a better bargain for herself by helping him to escape that\nnight; but as it was, she went out escorted by Poiret in search of the\nfamous chief of detectives in the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, still\nthinking that it was the district superintendent–one Gondureau–with\nwhom she had to do. The head of the department received his visitors\ncourteously. There was a little talk, and the details were definitely\narranged. Mlle. Michonneau asked for the draught that she was to\nadminister in order to set about her investigation. But the great\nman’s evident satisfaction set Mlle. Michonneau thinking; and she\nbegan to see that this business involved something more than the mere\ncapture of a runaway convict. She racked her brains while he looked in\na drawer in his desk for the little phial, and it dawned upon her that\nin consequence of treacherous revelations made by the prisoners the\npolice were hoping to lay their hands on a considerable sum of money.\nBut on hinting her suspicions to the old fox of the Petite Rue\nSaint-Anne, that officer began to smile, and tried to put her off the\nscent.",
        "“A delusion,” he said. “Collin’s sorbonne is the most dangerous that\nhas yet been found among the dangerous classes. That is all, and the\nrascals are quite aware of it. They rally round him; he is the\nbackbone of the federation, its Bonaparte, in short; he is very\npopular with them all. The rogue will never leave his chump in the\nPlace de Greve.”",
        "As Mlle. Michonneau seemed mystified, Gondureau explained the two\nslang words for her benefit. Sorbonne and chump are two forcible\nexpressions borrowed from thieves’ Latin, thieves, of all people,\nbeing compelled to consider the human head in its two aspects. A\nsorbonne is the head of a living man, his faculty of thinking–his\ncouncil; a chump is a contemptuous epithet that implies how little a\nhuman head is worth after the axe has done its work.",
        "“Collin is playing us off,” he continued. “When we come across a man\nlike a bar of steel tempered in the English fashion, there is always\none resource left–we can kill him if he takes it into his head to\nmake the least resistance. We are reckoning on several methods of\nkilling Collin to-morrow morning. It saves a trial, and society is rid\nof him without all the expense of guarding and feeding him. What with\ngetting up the case, summoning witnesses, paying their expenses, and\ncarrying out the sentence, it costs a lot to go through all the proper\nformalities before you can get quit of one of these good-for-nothings,\nover and above the three thousand francs that you are going to have.\nThere is a saving in time as well. One good thrust of the bayonet into\nTrompe-la-Mort’s paunch will prevent scores of crimes, and save fifty\nscoundrels from following his example; they will be very careful to\nkeep themselves out of the police courts. That is doing the work of\nthe police thoroughly, and true philanthropists will tell you that it\nis better to prevent crime than to punish it.”",
        "“And you do a service to our country,” said Poiret.",
        "“Really, you are talking in a very sensible manner tonight, that you\nare,” said the head of the department. “Yes, of course, we are serving\nour country, and we are very hardly used too. We do society very great\nservices that are not recognized. In fact, a superior man must rise\nabove vulgar prejudices, and a Christian must resign himself to the\nmishaps that doing right entails, when right is done in an\nout-of-the-way style. Paris is Paris, you see! That is the explanation\nof my life.–I have the honor to wish you a good-evening, mademoiselle.\nI shall bring my men to the Jardin du Roi in the morning. Send\nChristophe to the Rue du Buffon, tell him to ask for M. Gondureau in\nthe house where you saw me before.–Your servant, sir. If you should\never have anything stolen from you, come to me, and I will do my best\nto get it back for you.”",
        "“Well, now,” Poiret remarked to Mlle. Michonneau, “there are idiots\nwho are scared out of their wits by the word police. That was a very\npleasant-spoken gentleman, and what he wants you to do is as easy as\nsaying ’Good-day.’”",
        "The next day was destined to be one of the most extraordinary in the\nannals of the Maison Vauquer. Hitherto the most startling occurrence\nin its tranquil existence had been the portentous, meteor-like\napparition of the sham Comtesse de l’Ambermesnil. But the catastrophes\nof this great day were to cast all previous events into the shade, and\nsupply an inexhaustible topic of conversation for Mme. Vauquer and her\nboarders so long as she lived.",
        "In the first place, Goriot and Eugene de Rastignac both slept till\nclose upon eleven o’clock. Mme. Vauquer, who came home about midnight\nfrom the Gaite, lay a-bed till half-past ten. Christophe, after a\nprolonged slumber (he had finished Vautrin’s first bottle of wine),\nwas behindhand with his work, but Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau uttered\nno complaint, though breakfast was delayed. As for Victorine and Mme.\nCouture, they also lay late. Vautrin went out before eight o’clock,\nand only came back just as breakfast was ready. Nobody protested,\ntherefore, when Sylvie and Christophe went up at a quarter past\neleven, knocked at all the doors, and announced that breakfast was\nwaiting. While Sylvie and the man were upstairs, Mlle. Michonneau, who\ncame down first, poured the contents of the phial into the silver cup\nbelonging to Vautrin–it was standing with the others in the\nbain-marie that kept the cream hot for the morning coffee. The spinster\nhad reckoned on this custom of the house to do her stroke of business.\nThe seven lodgers were at last collected together, not without some\ndifficulty. Just as Eugene came downstairs, stretching himself and\nyawning, a commissionaire handed him a letter from Mme. de Nucingen.\nIt ran thus:–",
        "“I feel neither false vanity nor anger where you are concerned, my\nfriend. Till two o’clock this morning I waited for you. Oh, that\nwaiting for one whom you love! No one that had passed through that\ntorture could inflict it on another. I know now that you have never\nloved before. What can have happened? Anxiety has taken hold of me. I\nwould have come myself to find out what had happened, if I had not\nfeared to betray the secrets of my heart. How can I walk out or drive\nout at this time of day? Would it not be ruin? I have felt to the full\nhow wretched it is to be a woman. Send a word to reassure me, and\nexplain how it is that you have not come after what my father told\nyou. I shall be angry, but I will forgive you. One word, for pity’s\nsake. You will come to me soon, will you not? If you are busy, a line\nwill be enough. Say, ’I will hasten to you,’ or else, ’I am ill.’ But\nif you were ill my father would have come to tell me so. What can have\nhappened? . . .”",
        "“Yes, indeed, what has happened?” exclaimed Eugene, and, hurrying down\nto the dining-room, he crumpled up the letter without reading any\nmore. “What time is it?”",
        "“Half-past eleven,” said Vautrin, dropping a lump of sugar into his\ncoffee.",
        "The escaped convict cast a glance at Eugene, a cold and fascinating\nglance; men gifted with this magnetic power can quell furious lunatics\nin a madhouse by such a glance, it is said. Eugene shook in every\nlimb. There was the sound of wheels in the street, and in another\nmoment a man with a scared face rushed into the room. It was one of M.\nTaillefer’s servants; Mme. Couture recognized the livery at once.",
        "“Mademoiselle,” he cried, “your father is asking for you–something\nterrible has happened! M. Frederic has had a sword thrust in the\nforehead in a duel, and the doctors have given him up. You will\nscarcely be in time to say good-bye to him! he is unconscious.”",
        "“Poor young fellow!” exclaimed Vautrin. “How can people brawl when\nthey have a certain income of thirty thousand livres? Young people\nhave bad manners, and that is a fact.”",
        "“Sir!” cried Eugene.",
        "“Well, what then, you big baby!” said Vautrin, swallowing down his\ncoffee imperturbably, an operation which Mlle. Michonneau watched with\nsuch close attention that she had no emotion to spare for the amazing\nnews that had struck the others dumb with amazement. “Are there not\nduels every morning in Paris?” added Vautrin.",
        "“I will go with you, Victorine,” said Mme. Couture, and the two women\nhurried away at once without either hats or shawls. But before she\nwent, Victorine, with her eyes full of tears, gave Eugene a glance\nthat said–\"How little I thought that our happiness should cost me\ntears!”",
        "“Dear me, you are a prophet, M. Vautrin,” said Mme. Vauquer.",
        "“I am all sorts of things,” said Vautrin.",
        "“Queer, isn’t it?” said Mme. Vauquer, stringing together a succession\nof commonplaces suited to the occasion. “Death takes us off without\nasking us about it. The young often go before the old. It is a lucky\nthing for us women that we are not liable to fight duels, but we have\nother complaints that men don’t suffer from. We bear children, and it\ntakes a long time to get over it. What a windfall for Victorine! Her\nfather will have to acknowledge her now!”",
        "“There!” said Vautrin, looking at Eugene, “yesterday she had not a\npenny; this morning she has several millions to her fortune.”",
        "“I say, M. Eugene!” cried Mme. Vauquer, “you have landed on your\nfeet!”",
        "At this exclamation, Father Goriot looked at the student, and saw the\ncrumpled letter still in his hand.",
        "“You have not read it through! What does this mean? Are you going to\nbe like the rest of them?” he asked.",
        "“Madame, I shall never marry Mlle. Victorine,” said Eugene, turning to\nMme. Vauquer with an expression of terror and loathing that surprised\nthe onlookers at this scene.",
        "Father Goriot caught the student’s hand and grasped it warmly. He\ncould have kissed it.",
        "“Oh, ho!” said Vautrin, “the Italians have a good proverb–Col\ntempo.”",
        "“Is there any answer?” said Mme. de Nucingen’s messenger, addressing\nEugene.",
        "“Say that I will come directly.”",
        "The man went. Eugene was in a state of such violent excitement that he\ncould not be prudent.",
        "“What is to be done?” he exclaimed aloud. “There are no proofs!”",
        "Vautrin began to smile. Though the drug he had taken was doing its\nwork, the convict was so vigorous that he rose to his feet, gave\nRastignac a look, and said in hollow tones, “Luck comes to us while we\nsleep, young man,” and fell stiff and stark, as if he were struck\ndead.",
        "“So there is a Divine Justice!” said Eugene.",
        "“Well, if ever! What has come to that poor dear M. Vautrin?”",
        "“A stroke!” cried Mlle. Michonneau.",
        "“Here, Sylvie! girl, run for the doctor,” called the widow. “Oh, M.\nRastignac, just go for M. Bianchon, and be as quick as you can; Sylvie\nmight not be in time to catch our doctor, M. Grimprel.”",
        "Rastignac was glad of an excuse to leave that den of horrors, his\nhurry for the doctor was nothing but a flight.",
        "“Here, Christophe, go round to the chemist’s and ask for something\nthat’s good for the apoplexy.”",
        "Christophe likewise went.",
        "“Father Goriot, just help us to get him upstairs.”",
        "Vautrin was taken up among them, carried carefully up the narrow\nstaircase, and laid upon his bed.",
        "“I can do no good here, so I shall go to see my daughter,” said M.\nGoriot.",
        "“Selfish old thing!” cried Mme. Vauquer. “Yes, go; I wish you may die\nlike a dog.”",
        "“Just go and see if you can find some ether,” said Mlle. Michonneau to\nMme. Vauquer; the former, with some help from Poiret, had unfastened\nthe sick man’s clothes.",
        "Mme. Vauquer went down to her room, and left Mlle. Michonneau mistress\nof the situation.",
        "“Now! just pull down his shirt and turn him over, quick! You might be\nof some use in sparing my modesty,” she said to Poiret, “instead of\nstanding there like a stock.”",
        "Vautrin was turned over; Mlle. Michonneau gave his shoulder a sharp\nslap, and the two portentous letters appeared, white against the red.",
        "“There, you have earned your three thousand francs very easily,\"\nexclaimed Poiret, supporting Vautrin while Mlle. Michonneau slipped on\nthe shirt again.–\"Ouf! How heavy he is,” he added, as he laid the\nconvict down.",
        "“Hush! Suppose there is a strong-box here!” said the old maid briskly;\nher glances seemed to pierce the walls, she scrutinized every article\nof the furniture with greedy eyes. “Could we find some excuse for\nopening that desk?”",
        "“It mightn’t be quite right,” responded Poiret to this.",
        "“Where is the harm? It is money stolen from all sorts of people, so it\ndoesn’t belong to any one now. But we haven’t time, there is the\nVauquer.”",
        "“Here is the ether,” said that lady. “I must say that this is an\neventful day. Lord! that man can’t have had a stroke; he is as white\nas curds.”",
        "“White as curds?” echoed Poiret.",
        "“And his pulse is steady,” said the widow, laying her hand on his\nbreast.",
        "“Steady?” said the astonished Poiret.",
        "“He is all right.”",
        "“Do you think so?” asked Poiret.",
        "“Lord! Yes, he looks as if he were sleeping. Sylvie has gone for a\ndoctor. I say, Mlle. Michonneau, he is sniffing the ether. Pooh! it is\nonly a spasm. His pulse is good. He is as strong as a Turk. Just look,\nmademoiselle, what a fur tippet he has on his chest; that is the sort\nof man to live till he is a hundred. His wig holds on tightly,\nhowever. Dear me! it is glued on, and his own hair is red; that is why\nhe wears a wig. They say that red-haired people are either the worst\nor the best. Is he one of the good ones, I wonder?”",
        "“Good to hang,” said Poiret.",
        "“Round a pretty woman’s neck, you mean,” said Mlle Michonneau,\nhastily. “Just go away, M. Poiret. It is a woman’s duty to nurse you\nmen when you are ill. Besides, for all the good you are doing, you may\nas well take yourself off,” she added. “Mme. Vauquer and I will take\ngreat care of dear M. Vautrin.",
        "Poiret went out on tiptoe without a murmur, like a dog kicked out of\nthe room by his master.",
        "Rastignac had gone out for the sake of physical exertion; he wanted to\nbreathe the air, he felt stifled. Yesterday evening he had meant to\nprevent the murder arranged for half-past eight that morning. What had\nhappened? What ought he to do now? He trembled to think that he\nhimself might be implicated. Vautrin’s coolness still further dismayed\nhim.",
        "“Yet, how if Vautrin should die without saying a word?” Rastignac\nasked himself.",
        "He hurried along the alleys of the Luxembourg Gardens as if the hounds\nof justice were after him, and he already heard the baying of the\npack.",
        "“Well?” shouted Bianchon, “you have seen the Pilote?”",
        "The Pilote was a Radical sheet, edited by M. Tissot. It came out\nseveral hours later than the morning papers, and was meant for the\nbenefit of country subscribers; for it brought the morning news into\nprovincial districts twenty-four hours sooner than the ordinary local\njournals.",
        "“There is a wonderful history in it,” said the house student of the\nHopital Cochin. “Young Taillefer called out Count Franchessini, of the\nOld Guard, and the Count put a couple of inches of steel into his\nforehead. And here is little Victorine one of the richest heiresses in\nParis! If we had known that, eh? What a game of chance death is! They\nsay Victorine was sweet on you; was there any truth in it?”",
        "“Shut up, Bianchon; I shall never marry her. I am in love with a\ncharming woman, and she is in love with me, so––”",
        "“You said that as if you were screwing yourself up to be faithful to\nher. I should like to see the woman worth the sacrifice of Master\nTaillefer’s money!”",
        "“Are all the devils of hell at my heels?” cried Rastignac.",
        "“What is the matter with you? Are you mad? Give us your hand,” said\nBianchon, “and let me feel your pulse. You are feverish.”",
        "“Just go to Mother Vauquer’s,” said Rastignac; “that scoundrel Vautrin\nhas dropped down like one dead.”",
        "“Aha!” said Bianchon, leaving Rastignac to his reflections, “you\nconfirm my suspicions, and now I mean to make sure for myself.”",
        "The law student’s long walk was a memorable one for him. He made in\nsome sort a survey of his conscience. After a close scrutiny, after\nhesitation and self-examination, his honor at any rate came out\nscatheless from this sharp and terrible ordeal, like a bar of iron\ntested in the English fashion. He remembered Father Goriot’s\nconfidences of the evening before; he recollected the rooms taken for\nhim in the Rue d’Artois, so that he might be near Delphine; and then\nhe thought of his letter, and read it again and kissed it.",
        "“Such a love is my anchor of safety,” he said to himself. “How the old\nman’s heart must have been wrung! He says nothing about all that he\nhas been through; but who could not guess? Well, then, I will be like\na son to him; his life shall be made happy. If she cares for me, she\nwill often come to spend the day with him. That grand Comtesse de\nRestaud is a heartless thing; she would make her father into her hall\nporter. Dear Delphine! she is kinder to the old man; she is worthy to\nbe loved. Ah! this evening I shall be very happy!”",
        "He took out his watch and admired it.",
        "“I have had nothing but success! If two people mean to love each other\nfor ever, they may help each other, and I can take this. Besides, I\nshall succeed, and I will pay her a hundredfold. There is nothing\ncriminal in this liaison; nothing that could cause the most austere\nmoralist to frown. How many respectable people contract similar\nunions! We deceive nobody; it is deception that makes a position\nhumiliating. If you lie, you lower yourself at once. She and her\nhusband have lived apart for a long while. Besides, how if I called\nupon that Alsatian to resign a wife whom he cannot make happy?”",
        "Rastignac’s battle with himself went on for a long while; and though\nthe scruples of youth inevitably gained the day, an irresistible\ncuriosity led him, about half-past four, to return to the Maison\nVauquer through the gathering dusk.",
        "Bianchon had given Vautrin an emetic, reserving the contents of the\nstomach for chemical analysis at the hospital. Mlle. Michonneau’s\nofficious alacrity had still further strengthened his suspicions of\nher. Vautrin, moreover, had recovered so quickly that it was\nimpossible not to suspect some plot against the leader of all frolics\nat the lodging-house. Vautrin was standing in front of the stove in\nthe dining-room when Rastignac came in. All the lodgers were assembled\nsooner than usual by the news of young Taillefer’s duel. They were\nanxious to hear any detail about the affair, and to talk over the\nprobable change in Victorine’s prospects. Father Goriot alone was\nabsent, but the rest were chatting. No sooner did Eugene come into the\nroom, than his eyes met the inscrutable gaze of Vautrin. It was the\nsame look that had read his thoughts before–the look that had such\npower to waken evil thoughts in his heart. He shuddered.",
        "“Well, dear boy,” said the escaped convict, “I am likely to cheat\ndeath for a good while yet. According to these ladies, I have had a\nstroke that would have felled an ox, and come off with flying colors.”",
        "“A bull you might say,” cried the widow.",
        "“You really might be sorry to see me still alive,” said Vautrin in\nRastignac’s ear, thinking that he guessed the student’s thoughts. “You\nmust be mighty sure of yourself.”",
        "“Mlle. Michonneau was talking the day before yesterday about a\ngentleman named Trompe-la-Mort,” said Bianchon; “and, upon my word,\nthat name would do very well for you.”",
        "Vautrin seemed thunderstruck. He turned pale, and staggered back. He\nturned his magnetic glance, like a ray of vivid light, on Mlle.\nMichonneau; the old maid shrank and trembled under the influence of\nthat strong will, and collapsed into a chair. The mask of good-nature\nhad dropped from the convict’s face; from the unmistakable ferocity of\nthat sinister look, Poiret felt that the old maid was in danger, and\nhastily stepped between them. None of the lodgers understood this\nscene in the least, they looked on in mute amazement. There was a\npause. Just then there was a sound of tramping feet outside; there\nwere soldiers there, it seemed, for there was a ring of several rifles\non the pavement of the street. Collin was mechanically looking round\nthe walls for a way of escape, when four men entered by way of the\nsitting-room.",
        "“In the name of the King and the Law!” said an officer, but the words\nwere almost lost in a murmur of astonishment.",
        "Silence fell on the room. The lodgers made way for three of the men,\nwho had each a hand on a cocked pistol in a side pocket. Two\npolicemen, who followed the detectives, kept the entrance to the\nsitting-room, and two more men appeared in the doorway that gave\naccess to the staircase. A sound of footsteps came from the garden,\nand again the rifles of several soldiers rang on the cobblestones\nunder the window. All chance of salvation by flight was cut off for\nTrompe-la-Mort, to whom all eyes instinctively turned. The chief\nwalked straight up to him, and commenced operations by giving him a\nsharp blow on the head, so that the wig fell off, and Collin’s face\nwas revealed in all its ugliness. There was a terrible suggestion of\nstrength mingled with cunning in the short, brick-red crop of hair,\nthe whole head was in harmony with his powerful frame, and at that\nmoment the fires of hell seemed to gleam from his eyes. In that flash\nthe real Vautrin shone forth, revealed at once before them all; they\nunderstood his past, his present, and future, his pitiless doctrines,\nhis actions, the religion of his own good pleasure, the majesty with\nwhich his cynicism and contempt for mankind invested him, the physical\nstrength of an organization proof against all trials. The blood flew\nto his face, and his eyes glared like the eyes of a wild cat. He\nstarted back with savage energy and a fierce growl that drew\nexclamations of alarm from the lodgers. At that leonine start the\npolice caught at their pistols under cover of the general clamor.\nCollin saw the gleaming muzzles of the weapons, saw his danger, and\ninstantly gave proof of a power of the highest order. There was\nsomething horrible and majestic in the spectacle of the sudden\ntransformation in his face; he could only be compared to a cauldron\nfull of the steam that can send mountains flying, a terrific force\ndispelled in a moment by a drop of cold water. The drop of water that\ncooled his wrathful fury was a reflection that flashed across his\nbrain like lightning. He began to smile, and looked down at his wig.",
        "“You are not in the politest of humors to-day,” he remarked to the\nchief, and he held out his hands to the policemen with a jerk of his\nhead.",
        "“Gentlemen,” he said, “put on the bracelets or the handcuffs. I call\non those present to witness that I make no resistance.”",
        "A murmur of admiration ran through the room at the sudden outpouring\nlike fire and lava flood from this human volcano, and its equally\nsudden cessation.",
        "“There’s a sell for you, master crusher,” the convict added, looking\nat the famous director of police.",
        "“Come, strip!” said he of the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, contemptuously.",
        "“Why?” asked Collin. “There are ladies present; I deny nothing, and\nsurrender.”",
        "He paused, and looked round the room like an orator who is about to\noverwhelm his audience.",
        "“Take this down, Daddy Lachapelle,” he went on, addressing a little,\nwhite-haired old man who had seated himself at the end of the table;\nand after drawing a printed form from the portfolio, was proceeding to\ndraw up a document. “I acknowledge myself to be Jacques Collin,\notherwise known as Trompe-la-Mort, condemned to twenty years’ penal\nservitude, and I have just proved that I have come fairly by my\nnickname.–If I had as much as raised my hand,” he went on, addressing\nthe other lodgers, “those three sneaking wretches yonder would have\ndrawn claret on Mamma Vauquer’s domestic hearth. The rogues have laid\ntheir heads together to set a trap for me.”",
        "Mme. Vauquer felt sick and faint at these words.",
        "“Good Lord!” she cried, “this does give one a turn; and me at the\nGaite with him only last night!” she said to Sylvie.",
        "“Summon your philosophy, mamma,” Collin resumed. “Is it a misfortune\nto have sat in my box at the Gaite yesterday evening? After all, are\nyou better than we are? The brand upon our shoulders is less shameful\nthan the brand set on your hearts, you flabby members of a society\nrotten to the core. Not the best man among you could stand up to me.\"\nHis eyes rested upon Rastignac, to whom he spoke with a pleasant smile\nthat seemed strangely at variance with the savage expression in his\neyes.–\"Our little bargain still holds good, dear boy; you can accept\nany time you like! Do you understand?” And he sang:",
        "     “A charming girl is my Fanchette\n      In her simplicity.”",
        "“Don’t you trouble yourself,” he went on; “I can get in my money. They\nare too much afraid of me to swindle me.”",
        "The convicts’ prison, its language and customs, its sudden sharp\ntransitions from the humorous to the horrible, its appalling grandeur,\nits triviality and its dark depths, were all revealed in turn by the\nspeaker’s discourse; he seemed to be no longer a man, but the type and\nmouthpiece of a degenerate race, a brutal, supple, clear-headed race\nof savages. In one moment Collin became the poet of an inferno,\nwherein all thoughts and passions that move human nature (save\nrepentance) find a place. He looked about him like a fallen archangel\nwho is for war to the end. Rastignac lowered his eyes, and\nacknowledged this kinship claimed by crime as an expiation of his own\nevil thoughts.",
        "“Who betrayed me?” said Collin, and his terrible eyes traveled round\nthe room. Suddenly they rested on Mlle. Michonneau.",
        "“It was you, old cat!” he said. “That sham stroke of apoplexy was your\ndoing, lynx eyes! . . . Two words from me, and your throat would be\ncut in less than a week, but I forgive you, I am a Christian. You did\nnot sell me either. But who did?––Aha! you may rummage upstairs,” he\nshouted, hearing the police officers opening his cupboards and taking\npossession of his effects. “The nest is empty, the birds flew away\nyesterday, and you will be none the wiser. My ledgers are here,” he\nsaid tapping his forehead. “Now I know who sold me! It could only be\nthat blackguard Fil-de-Soie. That is who it was, old catchpoll, eh?\"\nhe said, turning to the chief. “It was timed so neatly to get the\nbanknotes up above there. There is nothing left for you–spies! As for\nFil-de-Soie, he will be under the daisies in less than a fortnight,\neven if you were to tell off the whole force to protect him. How much\ndid you give the Michonnette?” he asked of the police officers. “A\nthousand crowns? Oh you Ninon in decay, Pompadour in tatters, Venus of\nthe graveyard, I was worth more than that! If you had given me\nwarning, you should have had six thousand francs. Ah! you had no\nsuspicion of that, old trafficker in flesh and blood, or I should have\nhad the preference. Yes, I would have given six thousand francs to\nsave myself an inconvenient journey and some loss of money,” he said,\nas they fastened the handcuffs on his wrists. “These folks will amuse\nthemselves by dragging out this business till the end of time to keep\nme idle. If they were to send me straight to jail, I should soon be\nback at my old tricks in spite of the duffers at the Quai des\nOrfevres. Down yonder they will all turn themselves inside out to help\ntheir general–their good Trompe-la-Mort–to get clear away. Is there\na single one among you that can say, as I can, that he has ten\nthousand brothers ready to do anything for him?” he asked proudly.\n\"There is some good there,” he said tapping his heart; “I have never\nbetrayed any one!–Look you here, you slut,” he said to the old maid,\n\"they are all afraid of me, do you see? but the sight of you turns\nthem sick. Rake in your gains.”",
        "He was silent for a moment, and looked round at the lodgers’ faces.",
        "“What dolts you are, all of you! Have you never seen a convict before?\nA convict of Collin’s stamp, whom you see before you, is a man less\nweak-kneed than others; he lifts up his voice against the colossal\nfraud of the Social Contract, as Jean Jacques did, whose pupil he is\nproud to declare himself. In short, I stand here single-handed against\na Government and a whole subsidized machinery of tribunals and police,\nand I am a match for them all.”",
        "“Ye gods!” cried the painter, “what a magnificent sketch one might\nmake of him!”",
        "“Look here, you gentlemen-in-waiting to his highness the gibbet,\nmaster of ceremonies to the widow” (a nickname full of sombre poetry,\ngiven by prisoners to the guillotine), “be a good fellow, and tell me\nif it really was Fil-de-Soie who sold me. I don’t want him to suffer\nfor some one else, that would not be fair.”",
        "But before the chief had time to answer, the rest of the party\nreturned from making their investigations upstairs. Everything had\nbeen opened and inventoried. A few words passed between them and the\nchief, and the official preliminaries were complete.",
        "“Gentlemen,” said Collin, addressing the lodgers, “they will take me\naway directly. You have all made my stay among you very agreeable, and\nI shall look back upon it with gratitude. Receive my adieux, and\npermit me to send you figs from Provence.”",
        "He advanced a step or two, and then turned to look once more at\nRastignac.",
        "“Good-bye, Eugene,” he said, in a sad and gentle tone, a strange\ntransition from his previous rough and stern manner. “If you should be\nhard up, I have left you a devoted friend,” and, in spite of his\nshackles, he managed to assume a posture of defence, called, “One,\ntwo!” like a fencing-master, and lunged. “If anything goes wrong,\napply in that quarter. Man and money, all at your service.”",
        "The strange speaker’s manner was sufficiently burlesque, so that no\none but Rastignac knew that there was a serious meaning underlying the\npantomime.",
        "As soon as the police, soldiers, and detectives had left the house,\nSylvie, who was rubbing her mistress’ temples with vinegar, looked\nround at the bewildered lodgers.",
        "“Well,” said she, “he was a man, he was, for all that.”",
        "Her words broke the spell. Every one had been too much excited, too\nmuch moved by very various feelings to speak. But now the lodgers\nbegan to look at each other, and then all eyes were turned at once on\nMlle. Michonneau, a thin, shriveled, dead-alive, mummy-like figure,\ncrouching by the stove; her eyes were downcast, as if she feared that\nthe green eye-shade could not shut out the expression of those faces\nfrom her. This figure and the feeling of repulsion she had so long\nexcited were explained all at once. A smothered murmur filled the\nroom; it was so unanimous, that it seemed as if the same feeling of\nloathing had pitched all the voices in one key. Mlle. Michonneau heard\nit, and did not stir. It was Bianchon who was the first to move; he\nbent over his neighbor, and said in a low voice, “If that creature is\ngoing to stop here, and have dinner with us, I shall clear out.”",
        "In the twinkling of an eye it was clear that every one in the room,\nsave Poiret, was of the medical student’s opinion, so that the latter,\nstrong in the support of the majority, went up to that elderly person.",
        "“You are more intimate with Mlle. Michonneau than the rest of us,” he\nsaid; “speak to her, make her understand that she must go, and go at\nonce.”",
        "“At once!” echoed Poiret in amazement.",
        "Then he went across to the crouching figure, and spoke a few words in\nher ear.",
        "“I have paid beforehand for the quarter; I have as much right to be\nhere as any one else,” she said, with a viperous look at the boarders.",
        "“Never mind that! we will club together and pay you the money back,\"\nsaid Rastignac.",
        "“Monsieur is taking Collin’s part” she said, with a questioning,\nmalignant glance at the law student; “it is not difficult to guess\nwhy.”",
        "Eugene started forward at the words, as if he meant to spring upon her\nand wring her neck. That glance, and the depths of treachery that it\nrevealed, had been a hideous enlightenment.",
        "“Let her alone!” cried the boarders.",
        "Rastignac folded his arms and was silent.",
        "“Let us have no more of Mlle. Judas,” said the painter, turning to\nMme. Vauquer. “If you don’t show the Michonneau the door, madame, we\nshall all leave your shop, and wherever we go we shall say that there\nare only convicts and spies left there. If you do the other thing, we\nwill hold our tongues about the business; for when all is said and\ndone, it might happen in the best society until they brand them on the\nforehead, when they send them to the hulks. They ought not to let\nconvicts go about Paris disguised like decent citizens, so as to carry\non their antics like a set of rascally humbugs, which they are.”",
        "At this Mme. Vauquer recovered miraculously. She sat up and folded her\narms; her eyes were wide open now, and there was no sign of tears in\nthem.",
        "“Why, do you really mean to be the ruin of my establishment, my dear\nsir? There is M. Vautrin––Goodness,” she cried, interrupting\nherself, “I can’t help calling him by the name he passed himself off\nby for an honest man! There is one room to let already, and you want\nme to turn out two more lodgers in the middle of the season, when no\none is moving––”",
        "“Gentlemen, let us take our hats and go and dine at Flicoteaux’s in\nthe Place Sorbonne,” cried Bianchon.",
        "Mme. Vauquer glanced round, and saw in a moment on which side her\ninterest lay. She waddled across to Mlle. Michonneau.",
        "“Come, now,” she said; “you would not be the ruin of my establishment,\nwould you, eh? There’s a dear, kind soul. You see what a pass these\ngentlemen have brought me to; just go up to your room for this\nevening.”",
        "“Never a bit of it!” cried the boarders. “She must go, and go this\nminute!”",
        "“But the poor lady has had no dinner,” said Poiret, with piteous\nentreaty.",
        "“She can go and dine where she likes,” shouted several voices.",
        "“Turn her out, the spy!”",
        "“Turn them both out! Spies!”",
        "“Gentlemen,” cried Poiret, his heart swelling with the courage that\nlove gives to the ovine male, “respect the weaker sex.”",
        "“Spies are of no sex!” said the painter.",
        "“A precious sexorama!”",
        "“Turn her into the streetorama!”",
        "“Gentlemen, this is not manners! If you turn people out of the house,\nit ought not to be done so unceremoniously and with no notice at all.\nWe have paid our money, and we are not going,” said Poiret, putting on\nhis cap, and taking a chair beside Mlle. Michonneau, with whom Mme.\nVauquer was remonstrating.",
        "“Naughty boy!” said the painter, with a comical look; “run away,\nnaughty little boy!”",
        "“Look here,” said Bianchon; “if you do not go, all the rest of us\nwill,” and the boarders, to a man, made for the sitting-room-door.",
        "“Oh! mademoiselle, what is to be done?” cried Mme. Vauquer. “I am a\nruined woman. You can’t stay here; they will go further, do something\nviolent.”",
        "Mlle. Michonneau rose to her feet.",
        "“She is going!–She is not going!–She is going!–No, she isn’t.”",
        "These alternate exclamations, and a suggestion of hostile intentions,\nborne out by the behavior of the insurgents, compelled Mlle.\nMichonneau to take her departure. She made some stipulations, speaking\nin a low voice in her hostess’ ear, and then–\"I shall go to Mme.\nBuneaud’s,” she said, with a threatening look.",
        "“Go where you please, mademoiselle,” said Mme. Vauquer, who regarded\nthis choice of an opposition establishment as an atrocious insult. “Go\nand lodge with the Buneaud; the wine would give a cat the colic, and\nthe food is cheap and nasty.”",
        "The boarders stood aside in two rows to let her pass; not a word was\nspoken. Poiret looked so wistfully after Mlle. Michonneau, and so\nartlessly revealed that he was in two minds whether to go or stay,\nthat the boarders, in their joy at being quit of Mlle. Michonneau,\nburst out laughing at the sight of him.",
        "“Hist!–st!–st! Poiret,” shouted the painter. “Hallo! I say, Poiret,\nhallo!” The employe from the Museum began to sing:",
        "     “Partant pour la Syrie,\n      Le jeune et beau Dunois . . .”",
        "“Get along with you; you must be dying to go, trahit sua quemque\nvoluptas!” said Bianchon.",
        "“Every one to his taste–free rendering from Virgil,” said the tutor.",
        "Mlle. Michonneau made a movement as if to take Poiret’s arm, with an\nappealing glance that he could not resist. The two went out together,\nthe old maid leaning upon him, and there was a burst of applause,\nfollowed by peals of laughter.",
        "“Bravo, Poiret!”",
        "“Who would have thought it of old Poiret!”",
        "“Apollo Poiret!”",
        "“Mars Poiret!”",
        "“Intrepid Poiret!”",
        "A messenger came in at that moment with a letter for Mme. Vauquer, who\nread it through, and collapsed in her chair.",
        "“The house might as well be burned down at once,” cried she, “if there\nare to be any more of these thunderbolts! Young Taillefer died at\nthree o’clock this afternoon. It serves me right for wishing well to\nthose ladies at that poor man’s expense. Mme. Couture and Victorine\nwant me to send their things, because they are going to live with her\nfather. M. Taillefer allows his daughter to keep old Mme. Couture as\nher lady companion. Four rooms to let! and five lodgers gone! . . .”",
        "She sat up, and seemed about to burst into tears.",
        "“Bad luck has come to lodge here, I think,” she cried.",
        "Once more there came a sound of wheels from the street outside.",
        "“What! another windfall for somebody!” was Sylvie’s comment.",
        "But it was Goriot who came in, looking so radiant, so flushed with\nhappiness, that he seemed to have grown young again.",
        "“Goriot in a cab!” cried the boarders; “the world is coming to an\nend.”",
        "The good soul made straight for Eugene, who was standing wrapped in\nthought in a corner, and laid a hand on the young man’s arm.",
        "“Come,” he said, with gladness in his eyes.",
        "“Then you haven’t heard the news?” said Eugene. “Vautrin was an\nescaped convict; they have just arrested him; and young Taillefer is\ndead.”",
        "“Very well, but what business is it of ours?” replied Father Goriot.\n\"I am going to dine with my daughter in your house, do you\nunderstand? She is expecting you. Come!”",
        "He carried off Rastignac with him by main force, and they departed in\nas great a hurry as a pair of eloping lovers.",
        "“Now, let us have dinner,” cried the painter, and every one drew his\nchair to the table.",
        "“Well, I never,” said the portly Sylvie. “Nothing goes right to-day!\nThe haricot mutton has caught! Bah! you will have to eat it, burned as\nit is, more’s the pity!”",
        "Mme. Vauquer was so dispirited that she could not say a word as she\nlooked round the table and saw only ten people where eighteen should\nbe; but every one tried to comfort and cheer her. At first the dinner\ncontingent, as was natural, talked about Vautrin and the day’s events;\nbut the conversation wound round to such topics of interest as duels,\njails, justice, prison life, and alterations that ought to be made in\nthe laws. They soon wandered miles away from Jacques Collin and\nVictorine and her brother. There might be only ten of them, but they\nmade noise enough for twenty; indeed, there seemed to be more of them\nthan usual; that was the only difference between yesterday and to-day.\nIndifference to the fate of others is a matter of course in this\nselfish world, which, on the morrow of tragedy, seeks among the events\nof Paris for a fresh sensation for its daily renewed appetite, and\nthis indifference soon gained the upper hand. Mme. Vauquer herself\ngrew calmer under the soothing influence of hope, and the mouthpiece\nof hope was the portly Sylvie.",
        "That day had gone by like a dream for Eugene, and the sense of\nunreality lasted into the evening; so that, in spite of his energetic\ncharacter and clear-headedness, his ideas were a chaos as he sat\nbeside Goriot in the cab. The old man’s voice was full of unwonted\nhappiness, but Eugene had been shaken by so many emotions that the\nwords sounded in his ears like words spoken in a dream.",
        "“It was finished this morning! All three of us are going to dine there\ntogether, together! Do you understand? I have not dined with my\nDelphine, my little Delphine, these four years, and I shall have her\nfor a whole evening! We have been at your lodging the whole time since\nmorning. I have been working like a porter in my shirt sleeves,\nhelping to carry in the furniture. Aha! you don’t know what pretty\nways she has; at table she will look after me, ’Here, papa, just try\nthis, it is nice.’ And I shall not be able to eat. Oh, it is a long\nwhile since I have been with her in quiet every-day life as we shall\nhave her.”",
        "“It really seems as if the world has been turned upside down.”",
        "“Upside down?” repeated Father Goriot. “Why, the world has never been\nso right-side up. I see none but smiling faces in the streets, people\nwho shake hands cordially and embrace each other, people who all look\nas happy as if they were going to dine with their daughter, and gobble\ndown a nice little dinner that she went with me to order of the chef\nat the Cafe des Anglais. But, pshaw! with her beside you gall and\nwormwood would be as sweet as honey.”",
        "“I feel as if I were coming back to life again,” said Eugene.",
        "“Why, hurry up there!” cried Father Goriot, letting down the window in\nfront. “Get on faster; I will give you five francs if you get to the\nplace I told you of in ten minutes time.”",
        "With this prospect before him the cabman crossed Paris with miraculous\ncelerity.",
        "“How that fellow crawls!” said Father Goriot.",
        "“But where are you taking me?” Eugene asked him.",
        "“To your own house,” said Goriot.",
        "The cab stopped in the Rue d’Artois. Father Goriot stepped out first\nand flung ten francs to the man with the recklessness of a widower\nreturning to bachelor ways.",
        "“Come along upstairs,” he said to Rastignac. They crossed a courtyard,\nand climbed up to the third floor of a new and handsome house. There\nthey stopped before a door; but before Goriot could ring, it was\nopened by Therese, Mme. de Nucingen’s maid. Eugene found himself in a\ncharming set of chambers; an ante-room, a little drawing-room, a\nbedroom, and a study, looking out upon a garden. The furniture and the\ndecorations of the little drawing-room were of the most daintily\ncharming description, the room was full of soft light, and Delphine\nrose up from a low chair by the fire and stood before him. She set her\nfire-screen down on the chimney-piece, and spoke with tenderness in\nevery tone of her voice.",
        "“So we had to go in search of you, sir, you who are so slow to\nunderstand!”",
        "Therese left the room. The student took Delphine in his arms and held\nher in a tight clasp, his eyes filled with tears of joy. This last\ncontrast between his present surroundings and the scenes he had just\nwitnessed was too much for Rastignac’s over-wrought nerves, after the\nday’s strain and excitement that had wearied heart and brain; he was\nalmost overcome by it.",
        "“I felt sure myself that he loved you,” murmured Father Goriot, while\nEugene lay back bewildered on the sofa, utterly unable to speak a word\nor to reason out how and why the magic wand had been waved to bring\nabout this final transformation scene.",
        "“But you must see your rooms,” said Mme. de Nucingen. She took his\nhand and led him into a room carpeted and furnished like her own;\nindeed, down to the smallest details, it was a reproduction in\nminiature of Delphine’s apartment.",
        "“There is no bed,” said Rastignac.",
        "“No, monsieur,” she answered, reddening, and pressing his hand.\nEugene, looking at her, understood, young though he yet was, how\ndeeply modesty is implanted in the heart of a woman who loves.",
        "“You are one of those beings whom we cannot choose but to adore for\never,” he said in her ear. “Yes, the deeper and truer love is, the\nmore mysterious and closely veiled it should be; I can dare to say so,\nsince we understand each other so well. No one shall learn our\nsecret.”",
        "“Oh! so I am nobody, I suppose,” growled the father.",
        "“You know quite well that ’we’ means you.”",
        "“Ah! that is what I wanted. You will not mind me, will you? I shall go\nand come like a good fairy who makes himself felt everywhere without\nbeing seen, shall I not? Eh, Delphinette, Ninette, Dedel–was it not a\ngood idea of mine to say to you, ’There are some nice rooms to let in\nthe Rue d’Artois; let us furnish them for him?’ And she would not hear\nof it! Ah! your happiness has been all my doing. I am the author of\nyour happiness and of your existence. Fathers must always be giving if\nthey would be happy themselves; always giving–they would not be\nfathers else.”",
        "“Was that how it happened?” asked Eugene.",
        "“Yes. She would not listen to me. She was afraid that people would\ntalk, as if the rubbish that they say about you were to be compared\nwith happiness! Why, all women dream of doing what she has done––”",
        "Father Goriot found himself without an audience, for Mme. de Nucingen\nhad led Rastignac into the study; he heard a kiss given and taken, low\nthough the sound was.",
        "The study was furnished as elegantly as the other rooms, and nothing\nwas wanting there.",
        "“Have we guessed your wishes rightly?” she asked, as they returned to\nthe drawing-room for dinner.",
        "“Yes,” he said, “only too well, alas! For all this luxury so well\ncarried out, this realization of pleasant dreams, the elegance that\nsatisfies all the romantic fancies of youth, appeals to me so strongly\nthat I cannot but feel that it is my rightful possession, but I cannot\naccept it from you, and I am too poor as yet to––”",
        "“Ah! ah! you say me nay already,” she said with arch imperiousness,\nand a charming little pout of the lips, a woman’s way of laughing away\nscruples.",
        "But Eugene had submitted so lately to that solemn self-questioning,\nand Vautrin’s arrest had so plainly shown him the depths of the pit\nthat lay ready to his feet, that the instincts of generosity and honor\nhad been strengthened in him, and he could not allow himself to be\ncoaxed into abandoning his high-minded determinations. Profound\nmelancholy filled his mind.",
        "“Do you really mean to refuse?” said Mme. de Nucingen. “And do you\nknow what such a refusal means? That you are not sure of yourself,\nthat you do not dare to bind yourself to me. Are you really afraid of\nbetraying my affection? If you love me, if I–love you, why should\nyou shrink back from such a slight obligation? If you but knew what a\npleasure it has been to see after all the arrangements of this\nbachelor establishment, you would not hesitate any longer, you would\nask me to forgive you for your hesitation. I had some money that\nbelonged to you, and I have made good use of it, that is all. You mean\nthis for magnanimity, but it is very little of you. You are asking me\nfor far more than this. . . . Ah!” she cried, as Eugene’s passionate\nglance was turned on her, “and you are making difficulties about the\nmerest trifles. Of, if you feel no love whatever for me, refuse, by\nall means. My fate hangs on a word from you. Speak!–Father,” she\nsaid after a pause, “make him listen to reason. Can he imagine that I\nam less nice than he is on the point of honor?”",
        "Father Goriot was looking on and listening to this pretty quarrel with\na placid smile, as if he had found some balm for all the sorrows of\nlife.",
        "“Child that you are!” she cried again, catching Eugene’s hand. “You\nare just beginning life; you find barriers at the outset that many a\nman finds insurmountable; a woman’s hand opens the way and you shrink\nback! Why, you are sure to succeed! You will have a brilliant future.\nSuccess is written on that broad forehead of yours, and will you not\nbe able to repay me my loan of to-day? Did not a lady in olden times\narm her knight with sword and helmet and coat of mail, and find him a\ncharger, so that he might fight for her in the tournament? Well, then,\nEugene, these things that I offer you are the weapons of this age;\nevery one who means to be something must have such tools as these. A\npretty place your garret must be if it is like papa’s room! See,\ndinner is waiting all this time. Do you want to make me unhappy?–Why\ndon’t you answer?” she said, shaking his hand. ’Mon Dieu! papa, make\nup his mind for him, or I will go away and never see him any more.”",
        "“I will make up your mind,” said Goriot, coming down from the clouds.\n\"Now, my dear M. Eugene, the next thing is to borrow money of the\nJews, isn’t it?”",
        "“There is positively no help for it,” said Eugene.",
        "“All right, I will give you credit,” said the other, drawing out a\ncheap leather pocket-book, much the worse for wear. “I have turned Jew\nmyself; I paid for everything; here are the invoices. You do not owe a\npenny for anything here. It did not come to very much–five thousand\nfrancs at most, and I am going to lend you the money myself. I am not\na woman–you can refuse me. You shall give me a receipt on a scrap of\npaper, and you can return it some time or other.”",
        "Delphine and Eugene looked at each other in amazement, tears sprang to\ntheir eyes. Rastignac held out his hand and grasped Goriot’s warmly.",
        "“Well, what is all this about? Are you not my children?”",
        "“Oh! my poor father,” said Mme. de Nucingen, “how did you do it?”",
        "“Ah! now you ask me. When I made up my mind to move him nearer to you,\nand saw you buying things as if they were wedding presents, I said to\nmyself, ’She will never be able to pay for them.’ The attorney says\nthat those law proceedings will last quite six months before your\nhusband can be made to disgorge your fortune. Well and good. I sold\nout my property in the funds that brought in thirteen hundred and\nfifty livres a year, and bought a safe annuity of twelve hundred\nfrancs a year for fifteen thousand francs. Then I paid your tradesmen\nout of the rest of the capital. As for me, children, I have a room\nupstairs for which I pay fifty crowns a year; I can live like a prince\non two francs a day, and still have something left over. I shall not\nhave to spend anything much on clothes, for I never wear anything out.\nThis fortnight past I have been laughing in my sleeve, thinking to\nmyself, ’How happy they are going to be!’ and–well, now, are you not\nhappy?”",
        "“Oh papa! papa!” cried Mme. de Nucingen, springing to her father, who\ntook her on his knee. She covered him with kisses, her fair hair\nbrushed his cheek, her tears fell on the withered face that had grown\nso bright and radiant.",
        "“Dear father, what a father you are! No, there is not another father\nlike you under the sun. If Eugene loved you before, what must he feel\nfor you now?”",
        "“Why, children, why Delphinette!” cried Goriot, who had not felt his\ndaughter’s heart beat against his breast for ten years, “do you want\nme to die of joy? My poor heart will break! Come, Monsieur Eugene, we\nare quits already.” And the old man strained her to his breast with\nsuch fierce and passionate force that she cried out.",
        "“Oh! you are hurting me!” she said.",
        "“I am hurting you!” He grew pale at the words. The pain expressed in\nhis face seemed greater than it is given to humanity to know. The\nagony of this Christ of paternity can only be compared with the\nmasterpieces of those princes of the palette who have left for us the\nrecord of their visions of an agony suffered for a whole world by the\nSaviour of men. Father Goriot pressed his lips very gently against the\nwaist than his fingers had grasped too roughly.",
        "“Oh! no, no,” he cried. “I have not hurt you, have I?” and his smile\nseemed to repeat the question. “YOU have hurt me with that cry just\nnow.–The things cost rather more than that,” he said in her ear, with\nanother gentle kiss, “but I had to deceive him about it, or he would\nhave been angry.”",
        "Eugene sat dumb with amazement in the presence of this inexhaustible\nlove; he gazed at Goriot, and his face betrayed the artless admiration\nwhich shapes the beliefs of youth.",
        "“I will be worthy of all this,” he cried.",
        "“Oh! my Eugene, that is nobly said,” and Mme. de Nucingen kissed the\nlaw student on the forehead.",
        "“He gave up Mlle. Taillefer and her millions for you,” said Father\nGoriot. “Yes, the little thing was in love with you, and now that her\nbrother is dead she is as rich as Croesus.”",
        "“Oh! why did you tell her?” cried Rastignac.",
        "“Eugene,” Delphine said in his ear, “I have one regret now this\nevening. Ah! how I will love you! and for ever!”",
        "“This is the happiest day I have had since you two were married!\"\ncried Goriot. “God may send me any suffering, so long as I do not\nsuffer through you, and I can still say, ’In this short month of\nFebruary I had more happiness than other men have in their whole\nlives.’–Look at me, Fifine!” he said to his daughter. “She is very\nbeautiful, is she not? Tell me, now, have you seen many women with\nthat pretty soft color–that little dimple of hers? No, I thought not.\nAh, well, and but for me this lovely woman would never have been. And\nvery soon happiness will make her a thousand times lovelier, happiness\nthrough you. I could give up my place in heaven to you, neighbor, if\nneeds be, and go down to hell instead. Come, let us have dinner,” he\nadded, scarcely knowing what he said, “everything is ours.”",
        "“Poor dear father!”",
        "He rose and went over to her, and took her face in his hands, and set\na kiss on the plaits of hair. “If you only knew, little one, how happy\nyou can make me–how little it takes to make me happy! Will you come\nand see me sometimes? I shall be just above, so it is only a step.\nPromise me, say that you will!”",
        "“Yes, dear father.”",
        "“Say it again.”",
        "“Yes, I will, my kind father.”",
        "“Hush! hush! I should make you say it a hundred times over if I\nfollowed my own wishes. Let us have dinner.”",
        "The three behaved like children that evening, and Father Goriot’s\nspirits were certainly not the least wild. He lay at his daughter’s\nfeet, kissed them, gazed into her eyes, rubbed his head against her\ndress; in short, no young lover could have been more extravagant or\nmore tender.",
        "“You see!” Delphine said with a look at Eugene, “so long as my father\nis with us, he monopolizes me. He will be rather in the way\nsometimes.”",
        "Eugene had himself already felt certain twinges of jealousy, and could\nnot blame this speech that contained the germ of all ingratitude.",
        "“And when will the rooms be ready?” asked Eugene, looking round. “We\nmust all leave them this evening, I suppose.”",
        "“Yes, but to-morrow you must come and dine with me,” she answered,\nwith an eloquent glance. “It is our night at the Italiens.”",
        "“I shall go to the pit,” said her father.",
        "It was midnight. Mme. de Nucingen’s carriage was waiting for her, and\nFather Goriot and the student walked back to the Maison Vauquer,\ntalking of Delphine, and warming over their talk till there grew up a\ncurious rivalry between the two violent passions. Eugene could not\nhelp seeing that the father’s self-less love was deeper and more\nsteadfast than his own. For this worshiper Delphine was always pure\nand fair, and her father’s adoration drew its fervor from a whole past\nas well as a future of love.",
        "They found Mme. Vauquer by the stove, with Sylvie and Christophe to\nkeep her company; the old landlady, sitting like Marius among the\nruins of Carthage, was waiting for the two lodgers that yet remained\nto her, and bemoaning her lot with the sympathetic Sylvie. Tasso’s\nlamentations as recorded in Byron’s poem are undoubtedly eloquent, but\nfor sheer force of truth they fall far short of the widow’s cry from\nthe depths.",
        "“Only three cups of coffee in the morning, Sylvie! Oh dear! to have\nyour house emptied in this way is enough to break your heart. What is\nlife, now my lodgers are gone? Nothing at all. Just think of it! It is\njust as if all the furniture had been taken out of the house, and your\nfurniture is your life. How have I offended heaven to draw down all\nthis trouble upon me? And haricot beans and potatoes laid in for\ntwenty people! The police in my house too! We shall have to live on\npotatoes now, and Christophe will have to go!”",
        "The Savoyard, who was fast asleep, suddenly woke up at this, and said,\n\"Madame,” questioningly.",
        "“Poor fellow!” said Sylvie, “he is like a dog.”",
        "“In the dead season, too! Nobody is moving now. I would like to know\nwhere the lodgers are to drop down from. It drives me distracted. And\nthat old witch of a Michonneau goes and takes Poiret with her! What\ncan she have done to make him so fond of her? He runs about after her\nlike a little dog.”",
        "“Lord!” said Sylvie, flinging up her head, “those old maids are up to\nall sorts of tricks.”",
        "“There’s that poor M. Vautrin that they made out to be a convict,” the\nwidow went on. “Well, you know that is too much for me, Sylvie; I\ncan’t bring myself to believe it. Such a lively man as he was, and\npaid fifteen francs a month for his coffee of an evening, paid you\nvery penny on the nail too.”",
        "“And open-handed he was!” said Christophe.",
        "“There is some mistake,” said Sylvie.",
        "“Why, no there isn’t! he said so himself!” said Mme. Vauquer. “And to\nthink that all these things have happened in my house, and in a\nquarter where you never see a cat go by. On my word as an honest\nwoman, it’s like a dream. For, look here, we saw Louis XVI. meet with\nhis mishap; we saw the fall of the Emperor; and we saw him come back\nand fall again; there was nothing out of the way in all that, but\nlodging-houses are not liable to revolutions. You can do without a\nking, but you must eat all the same; and so long as a decent woman, a\nde Conflans born and bred, will give you all sorts of good things for\ndinner, nothing short of the end of the world ought to–but there, it\nis the end of the world, that is just what it is!”",
        "“And to think that Mlle. Michonneau who made all this mischief is to\nhave a thousand crowns a year for it, so I hear,” cried Sylvie.",
        "“Don’t speak of her, she is a wicked woman!” said Mme. Vauquer. “She\nis going to the Buneaud, who charges less than cost. But the Buneaud\nis capable of anything; she must have done frightful things, robbed\nand murdered people in her time. She ought to be put in jail for life\ninstead of that poor dear––”",
        "Eugene and Goriot rang the door-bell at that moment.",
        "“Ah! here are my two faithful lodgers,” said the widow, sighing.",
        "But the two faithful lodgers, who retained but shadowy recollections\nof the misfortunes of their lodging-house, announced to their hostess\nwithout more ado that they were about to remove to the Chaussee\nd’Antin.",
        "“Sylvie!” cried the widow, “this is the last straw.–Gentlemen, this\nwill be the death of me! It has quite upset me! There’s a weight on my\nchest! I am ten years older for this day! Upon my word, I shall go out\nof my senses! And what is to be done with the haricots!–Oh, well, if\nI am to be left here all by myself, you shall go to-morrow,\nChristophe.–Good-night, gentlemen,” and she went.",
        "“What is the matter now?” Eugene inquired of Sylvie.",
        "“Lord! everybody is going about his business, and that has addled her\nwits. There! she is crying upstairs. It will do her good to snivel a\nbit. It’s the first time she has cried since I’ve been with her.”",
        "By the morning, Mme. Vauquer, to use her own expression, had “made up\nher mind to it.” True, she still wore a doleful countenance, as might\nbe expected of a woman who had lost all her lodgers, and whose manner\nof life had been suddenly revolutionized, but she had all her wits\nabout her. Her grief was genuine and profound; it was real pain of\nmind, for her purse had suffered, the routine of her existence had\nbeen broken. A lover’s farewell glance at his lady-love’s window is\nnot more mournful than Mme. Vauquer’s survey of the empty places round\nher table. Eugene administered comfort, telling the widow that\nBianchon, whose term of residence at the hospital was about to expire,\nwould doubtless take his (Rastignac’s) place; that the official from\nthe Museum had often expressed a desire to have Mme. Couture’s rooms;\nand that in a very few days her household would be on the old footing.",
        "“God send it may, my dear sir! but bad luck has come to lodge here.\nThere’ll be a death in the house before ten days are out, you’ll see,\"\nand she gave a lugubrious look round the dining-room. “Whose turn\nwill it be, I wonder?”",
        "“It is just as well that we are moving out,” said Eugene to Father\nGoriot in a low voice.",
        "“Madame,” said Sylvie, running in with a scared face, “I have not seen\nMistigris these three days.”",
        "“Ah! well, if my cat is dead, if he has gone and left us, I––”",
        "The poor woman could not finish her sentence; she clasped her hands\nand hid her face on the back of her armchair, quite overcome by this\ndreadful portent.",
        "By twelve o’clock, when the postman reaches that quarter, Eugene\nreceived a letter. The dainty envelope bore the Beauseant arms on the\nseal, and contained an invitation to the Vicomtesse’s great ball,\nwhich had been talked of in Paris for a month. A little note for\nEugene was slipped in with the card.",
        " “I think, monsieur, that you will undertake with pleasure to\n  interpret my sentiments to Mme. de Nucingen, so I am sending the\n  card for which you asked me to you. I shall be delighted to make\n  the acquaintance of Mme. de Restaud’s sister. Pray introduce that\n  charming lady to me, and do not let her monopolize all your\n  affection, for you owe me not a little in return for mine.",
        "“Vicomtesse De Beauseant.”",
        "“Well,” said Eugene to himself, as he read the note a second time,\n\"Mme. de Beauseant says pretty plainly that she does not want the\nBaron de Nucingen.”",
        "He went to Delphine at once in his joy. He had procured this pleasure\nfor her, and doubtless he would receive the price of it. Mme. de\nNucingen was dressing. Rastignac waited in her boudoir, enduring as\nbest he might the natural impatience of an eager temperament for the\nreward desired and withheld for a year. Such sensations are only known\nonce in a life. The first woman to whom a man is drawn, if she is\nreally a woman–that is to say, if she appears to him amid the\nsplendid accessories that form a necessary background to life in the\nworld of Paris–will never have a rival.",
        "Love in Paris is a thing distinct and apart; for in Paris neither men\nnor women are the dupes of the commonplaces by which people seek to\nthrow a veil over their motives, or to parade a fine affectation of\ndisinterestedness in their sentiments. In this country within a\ncountry, it is not merely required of a woman that she should satisfy\nthe senses and the soul; she knows perfectly well that she has still\ngreater obligations to discharge, that she must fulfil the countless\ndemands of a vanity that enters into every fibre of that living\norganism called society. Love, for her, is above all things, and by\nits very nature, a vainglorious, brazen-fronted, ostentatious,\nthriftless charlatan. If at the Court of Louis XIV. there was not a\nwoman but envied Mlle. de la Valliere the reckless devotion of passion\nthat led the grand monarch to tear the priceless ruffles at his wrists\nin order to assist the entry of a Duc de Vermandois into the world\n–what can you expect of the rest of society? You must have youth and\nwealth and rank; nay, you must, if possible, have more than these, for\nthe more incense you bring with you to burn at the shrine of the god,\nthe more favorably will he regard the worshiper. Love is a religion,\nand his cult must in the nature of things be more costly than those of\nall other deities; Love the Spoiler stays for a moment, and then\npasses on; like the urchin of the streets, his course may be traced by\nthe ravages that he has made. The wealth of feeling and imagination is\nthe poetry of the garret; how should love exist there without that\nwealth?",
        "If there are exceptions who do not subscribe to these Draconian laws\nof the Parisian code, they are solitary examples. Such souls live so\nfar out of the main current that they are not borne away by the\ndoctrines of society; they dwell beside some clear spring of\neverflowing water, without seeking to leave the green shade; happy to\nlisten to the echoes of the infinite in everything around them and in\ntheir own souls, waiting in patience to take their flight for heaven,\nwhile they look with pity upon those of earth.",
        "Rastignac, like most young men who have been early impressed by the\ncircumstances of power and grandeur, meant to enter the lists fully\narmed; the burning ambition of conquest possessed him already; perhaps\nhe was conscious of his powers, but as yet he knew neither the end to\nwhich his ambition was to be directed, nor the means of attaining it.\nIn default of the pure and sacred love that fills a life, ambition may\nbecome something very noble, subduing to itself every thought of\npersonal interest, and setting as the end–the greatness, not of one\nman, but of a whole nation.",
        "But the student had not yet reached the time of life when a man\nsurveys the whole course of existence and judges it soberly. Hitherto\nhe had scarcely so much as shaken off the spell of the fresh and\ngracious influences that envelop a childhood in the country, like\ngreen leaves and grass. He had hesitated on the brink of the Parisian\nRubicon, and in spite of the prickings of ambition, he still clung to\na lingering tradition of an old ideal–the peaceful life of the noble\nin his chateau. But yesterday evening, at the sight of his rooms,\nthose scruples had vanished. He had learned what it was to enjoy the\nmaterial advantages of fortune, as he had already enjoyed the social\nadvantages of birth; he ceased to be a provincial from that moment,\nand slipped naturally and easily into a position which opened up a\nprospect of a brilliant future.",
        "So, as he waited for Delphine, in the pretty boudoir, where he felt\nthat he had a certain right to be, he felt himself so far away from\nthe Rastignac who came back to Paris a year ago, that, turning some\npower of inner vision upon this latter, he asked himself whether that\npast self bore any resemblance to the Rastignac of that moment.",
        "“Madame is in her room,” Therese came to tell him. The woman’s voice\nmade him start.",
        "He found Delphine lying back in her low chair by the fireside, looking\nfresh and bright. The sight of her among the flowing draperies of\nmuslin suggested some beautiful tropical flower, where the fruit is\nset amid the blossom.",
        "“Well,” she said, with a tremor in her voice, “here you are.”",
        "“Guess what I bring for you,” said Eugene, sitting down beside her. He\ntook possession of her arm to kiss her hand.",
        "Mme. de Nucingen gave a joyful start as she saw the card. She turned\nto Eugene; there were tears in her eyes as she flung her arms about\nhis neck, and drew him towards her in a frenzy of gratified vanity.",
        "“And I owe this happiness to you–to thee” (she whispered the more\nintimate word in his ear); “but Therese is in my dressing-room, let us\nbe prudent.–This happiness–yes, for I may call it so, when it comes\nto me through you–is surely more than a triumph for self-love? No one\nhas been willing to introduce me into that set. Perhaps just now I may\nseem to you to be frivolous, petty, shallow, like a Parisienne, but\nremember, my friend, that I am ready to give up all for you; and that\nif I long more than ever for an entrance into the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain, it is because I shall meet you there.”",
        "“Mme. de Beauseant’s note seems to say very plainly that she does not\nexpect to see the Baron de Nucingen at her ball; don’t you think\nso?” said Eugene.",
        "“Why, yes,” said the Baroness as she returned the letter. “Those women\nhave a talent for insolence. But it is of no consequence, I shall go.\nMy sister is sure to be there, and sure to be very beautifully\ndressed.–Eugene,” she went on, lowering her voice, “she will go to\ndispel ugly suspicions. You do not know the things that people are\nsaying about her. Only this morning Nucingen came to tell me that they\nhad been discussing her at the club. Great heavens! on what does a\nwoman’s character and the honor of a whole family depend! I feel that\nI am nearly touched and wounded in my poor sister. According to some\npeople, M. de Trailles must have put his name to bills for a hundred\nthousand francs, nearly all of them are overdue, and proceedings are\nthreatened. In this predicament, it seems that my sister sold her\ndiamonds to a Jew–the beautiful diamonds that belonged to her\nhusband’s mother, Mme. de Restaud the elder,–you have seen her\nwearing them. In fact, nothing else has been talked about for the last\ntwo days. So I can see that Anastasie is sure to come to Mme. de\nBeauseant’s ball in tissue of gold, and ablaze with diamonds, to draw\nall eyes upon her; and I will not be outshone. She has tried to\neclipse me all her life, she has never been kind to me, and I have\nhelped her so often, and always had money for her when she had none.\n–But never mind other people now, to-day I mean to be perfectly\nhappy.”",
        "At one o’clock that morning Eugene was still with Mme. de Nucingen. In\nthe midst of their lovers’ farewell, a farewell full of hope of bliss\nto come, she said in a troubled voice, “I am very fearful,\nsuperstitious. Give what name you like to my presentiments, but I am\nafraid that my happiness will be paid for by some horrible\ncatastrophe.”",
        "“Child!” said Eugene.",
        "“Ah! have we changed places, and am I the child to-night?” she asked,\nlaughingly.",
        "Eugene went back to the Maison Vauquer, never doubting but that he\nshould leave it for good on the morrow; and on the way he fell to\ndreaming the bright dreams of youth, when the cup of happiness has\nleft its sweetness on the lips.",
        "“Well?” cried Goriot, as Rastignac passed by his door.",
        "“Yes,” said Eugene; “I will tell you everything to-morrow.”",
        "“Everything, will you not?” cried the old man. “Go to bed. To-morrow\nour happy life will begin.”",
        "Next day, Goriot and Rastignac were ready to leave the lodging-house,\nand only awaited the good pleasure of a porter to move out of it;\nbut towards noon there was a sound of wheels in the Rue\nNeuve-Sainte-Genevieve, and a carriage stopped before the door of the\nMaison Vauquer. Mme. de Nucingen alighted, and asked if her father\nwas still in the house, and, receiving an affirmative reply from\nSylvie, ran lightly upstairs.",
        "It so happened that Eugene was at home all unknown to his neighbor. At\nbreakfast time he had asked Goriot to superintend the removal of his\ngoods, saying that he would meet him in the Rue d’Artois at four\no’clock; but Rastignac’s name had been called early on the list at\nthe Ecole de Droit, and he had gone back at once to the Rue\nNueve-Sainte-Genevieve. No one had seen him come in, for Goriot had\ngone to find a porter, and the mistress of the house was likewise out.\nEugene had thought to pay her himself, for it struck him that if he\nleft this, Goriot in his zeal would probably pay for him. As it was,\nEugene went up to his room to see that nothing had been forgotten, and\nblessed his foresight when he saw the blank bill bearing Vautrin’s\nsignature lying in the drawer where he had carelessly thrown it on the\nday when he had repaid the amount. There was no fire in the grate, so\nhe was about to tear it into little pieces, when he heard a voice\nspeaking in Goriot’s room, and the speaker was Delphine! He made no\nmore noise, and stood still to listen, thinking that she should have\nno secrets from him; but after the first few words, the conversation\nbetween the father and daughter was so strange and interesting that it\nabsorbed all his attention.",
        "“Ah! thank heaven that you thought of asking him to give an account of\nthe money settled on me before I was utterly ruined, father. Is it\nsafe to talk?” she added.",
        "“Yes, there is no one in the house,” said her father faintly.",
        "“What is the matter with you?” asked Mme. de Nucingen.",
        "“God forgive you! you have just dealt me a staggering blow, child!\"\nsaid the old man. “You cannot know how much I love you, or you would\nnot have burst in upon me like this, with such news, especially if all\nis not lost. Has something so important happened that you must come\nhere about it? In a few minutes we should have been in the Rue\nd’Artois.”",
        "“Eh! does one think what one is doing after a catastrophe? It has\nturned my head. Your attorney has found out the state of things now,\nbut it was bound to come out sooner or later. We shall want your long\nbusiness experience; and I come to you like a drowning man who catches\nat a branch. When M. Derville found that Nucingen was throwing all\nsorts of difficulties in his way, he threatened him with proceedings,\nand told him plainly that he would soon obtain an order from the\nPresident of the Tribunal. So Nucingen came to my room this morning,\nand asked if I meant to ruin us both. I told him that I knew nothing\nwhatever about it, that I had a fortune, and ought to be put into\npossession of my fortune, and that my attorney was acting for me in\nthe matter; I said again that I knew absolutely nothing about it, and\ncould not possibly go into the subject with him. Wasn’t that what you\ntold me to tell him?”",
        "“Yes, quite right,” answered Goriot.",
        "“Well, then,” Delphine continued, “he told me all about his affairs.\nHe had just invested all his capital and mine in business\nspeculations; they have only just been started, and very large sums of\nmoney are locked up. If I were to compel him to refund my dowry now,\nhe would be forced to file his petition; but if I will wait a year, he\nundertakes, on his honor, to double or treble my fortune, by investing\nit in building land, and I shall be mistress at last of the whole of\nmy property. He was speaking the truth, father dear; he frightened me!\nHe asked my pardon for his conduct; he has given me my liberty; I am\nfree to act as I please on condition that I leave him to carry on my\nbusiness in my name. To prove his sincerity, he promised that M.\nDerville might inspect the accounts as often as I pleased, so that I\nmight be assured that everything was being conducted properly. In\nshort, he put himself in my power, bound hand and foot. He wishes the\npresent arrangements as to the expenses of housekeeping to continue\nfor two more years, and entreated me not to exceed my allowance. He\nshowed me plainly that it was all that he could do to keep up\nappearances; he has broken with his opera dancer; he will be compelled\nto practise the most strict economy (in secret) if he is to bide his\ntime with unshaken credit. I scolded, I did all I could to drive him\nto desperation, so as to find out more. He showed me his ledgers–he\nbroke down and cried at last. I never saw a man in such a state. He\nlost his head completely, talked of killing himself, and raved till I\nfelt quite sorry for him.”",
        "“Do you really believe that silly rubbish?” . . . cried her father.\n\"It was all got up for your benefit! I have had to do with Germans in\nthe way of business, honest and straightforward they are pretty sure\nto be, but when with their simplicity and frankness they are sharpers\nand humbugs as well, they are the worst rogues of all. Your husband is\ntaking advantage of you. As soon as pressure is brought to bear on him\nhe shams dead; he means to be more the master under your name than in\nhis own. He will take advantage of the position to secure himself\nagainst the risks of business. He is as sharp as he is treacherous; he\nis a bad lot! No, no; I am not going to leave my girls behind me\nwithout a penny when I go to Pere-Lachaise. I know something about\nbusiness still. He has sunk his money in speculation, he says; very\nwell then, there is something to show for it–bills, receipts, papers\nof some sort. Let him produce them, and come to an arrangement with\nyou. We will choose the most promising of his speculations, take them\nover at our own risk, and have the securities transferred into your\nname; they shall represent the separate estate of Delphine Goriot,\nwife of the Baron de Nucingen. Does that fellow really take us for\nidiots? Does he imagine that I could stand the idea of your being\nwithout fortune, without bread, for forty-eight hours? I would not\nstand it a day–no, not a night, not a couple of hours! If there had\nbeen any foundation for the idea, I should never get over it. What! I\nhave worked hard for forty years, carried sacks on my back, and\nsweated and pinched and saved all my life for you, my darlings, for\nyou who made the toil and every burden borne for you seem light; and\nnow, my fortune, my whole life, is to vanish in smoke! I should die\nraving mad if I believed a word of it. By all that’s holiest in heaven\nand earth, we will have this cleared up at once; go through the books,\nhave the whole business looked thoroughly into! I will not sleep, nor\nrest, nor eat until I have satisfied myself that all your fortune is\nin existence. Your money is settled upon you, God be thanked! and,\nluckily, your attorney, Maitre Derville, is an honest man. Good Lord!\nyou shall have your snug little million, your fifty thousand francs a\nyear, as long as you live, or I will raise a racket in Paris, I will\nso! If the Tribunals put upon us, I will appeal to the Chambers. If I\nknew that you were well and comfortably off as far as money is\nconcerned, that thought would keep me easy in spite of bad health and\ntroubles. Money? why, it is life! Money does everything. That great\ndolt of an Alsatian shall sing to another tune! Look here, Delphine,\ndon’t give way, don’t make a concession of half a quarter of a\nfarthing to that fathead, who has ground you down and made you\nmiserable. If he can’t do without you, we will give him a good\ncudgeling, and keep him in order. Great heavens! my brain is on fire;\nit is as if there were something redhot inside my head. My Delphine\nlying on straw! You! my Fifine! Good gracious! Where are my gloves?\nCome, let us go at once; I mean to see everything with my own eyes\n–books, cash, and correspondence, the whole business. I shall have\nno peace until I know for certain that your fortune is secure.”",
        "“Oh! father dear, be careful how you set about it! If there is the\nleast hint of vengeance in the business, if you show yourself openly\nhostile, it will be all over with me. He knows whom he has to deal\nwith; he thinks it quite natural that if you put the idea into my\nhead, I should be uneasy about my money; but I swear to you that he\nhas it in his own hands, and that he had meant to keep it. He is just\nthe man to abscond with all the money and leave us in the lurch, the\nscoundrel! He knows quite well that I will not dishonor the name I\nbear by bringing him into a court of law. His position is strong and\nweak at the same time. If we drive him to despair, I am lost.”",
        "“Why, then, the man is a rogue?”",
        "“Well, yes, father,” she said, flinging herself into a chair, “I\nwanted to keep it from you to spare your feelings,” and she burst into\ntears; “I did not want you to know that you had married me to such a\nman as he is. He is just the same in private life–body and soul and\nconscience–the same through and through–hideous! I hate him; I\ndespise him! Yes, after all that that despicable Nucingen has told me,\nI cannot respect him any longer. A man capable of mixing himself up in\nsuch affairs, and of talking about them to me as he did, without the\nslightest scruple,–it is because I have read him through and through\nthat I am afraid of him. He, my husband, frankly proposed to give me\nmy liberty, and do you know what that means? It means that if things\nturn out badly for him, I am to play into his hands, and be his\nstalking-horse.”",
        "“But there is law to be had! There is a Place de Greve for sons-in-law\nof that sort,” cried her father; “why, I would guillotine him myself\nif there was no headsman to do it.”",
        "“No, father, the law cannot touch him. Listen, this is what he says,\nstripped of all his circumlocutions–’Take your choice, you and no one\nelse can be my accomplice; either everything is lost, you are ruined\nand have not a farthing, or you will let me carry this business\nthrough myself.’ Is that plain speaking? He must have my assistance.\nHe is assured that his wife will deal fairly by him; he knows that I\nshall leave his money to him and be content with my own. It is an\nunholy and dishonest compact, and he holds out threats of ruin to\ncompel me to consent to it. He is buying my conscience, and the price\nis liberty to be Eugene’s wife in all but name. ’I connive at your\nerrors, and you allow me to commit crimes and ruin poor families!’ Is\nthat sufficiently explicit? Do you know what he means by speculations?\nHe buys up land in his own name, then he finds men of straw to run up\nhouses upon it. These men make a bargain with a contractor to build\nthe houses, paying them by bills at long dates; then in consideration\nof a small sum they leave my husband in possession of the houses, and\nfinally slip through the fingers of the deluded contractors by going\ninto bankruptcy. The name of the firm of Nucingen has been used to\ndazzle the poor contractors. I saw that. I noticed, too, that Nucingen\nhad sent bills for large amounts to Amsterdam, London, Naples, and\nVienna, in order to prove if necessary that large sums had been paid\naway by the firm. How could we get possession of those bills?”",
        "Eugene heard a dull thud on the floor; Father Goriot must have fallen\non his knees.",
        "“Great heavens! what have I done to you? Bound my daughter to this\nscoundrel who does as he likes with her!–Oh! my child, my child!\nforgive me!” cried the old man.",
        "“Yes, if I am in the depths of despair, perhaps you are to blame,\"\nsaid Delphine. “We have so little sense when we marry! What do we know\nof the world, of business, or men, or life? Our fathers should think\nfor us! Father dear, I am not blaming you in the least, forgive me for\nwhat I said. This is all my own fault. Nay, do not cry, papa,” she\nsaid, kissing him.",
        "“Do not cry either, my little Delphine. Look up and let me kiss away\nthe tears. There! I shall find my wits and unravel this skein of your\nhusband’s winding.”",
        "“No, let me do that; I shall be able to manage him. He is fond of me,\nwell and good; I shall use my influence to make him invest my money as\nsoon as possible in landed property in my own name. Very likely I\ncould get him to buy back Nucingen in Alsace in my name; that has\nalways been a pet idea of his. Still, come to-morrow and go through\nthe books, and look into the business. M. Derville knows little of\nmercantile matters. No, not to-morrow though. I do not want to be\nupset. Mme. de Beauseant’s ball will be the day after to-morrow, and I\nmust keep quiet, so as to look my best and freshest, and do honor to\nmy dear Eugene! . . . Come, let us see his room.”",
        "But as she spoke a carriage stopped in the Rue\nNueve-Sainte-Genevieve, and the sound of Mme. de Restaud’s voice came\nfrom the staircase. “Is my father in?” she asked of Sylvie.",
        "This accident was luckily timed for Eugene, whose one idea had been to\nthrow himself down on the bed and pretend to be asleep.",
        "“Oh, father, have you heard about Anastasie?” said Delphine, when she\nheard her sister speak. “It looks as though some strange things had\nhappened in that family.”",
        "“What sort of things?” asked Goriot. “This is like to be the death of\nme. My poor head will not stand a double misfortune.”",
        "“Good-morning, father,” said the Countess from the threshold. “Oh!\nDelphine, are you here?”",
        "Mme. de Restaud seemed taken aback by her sister’s presence.",
        "“Good-morning, Nasie,” said the Baroness. “What is there so\nextraordinary in my being here? I see our father every day.”",
        "“Since when?”",
        "“If you came yourself you would know.”",
        "“Don’t tease, Delphine,” said the Countess fretfully. “I am very\nmiserable, I am lost. Oh! my poor father, it is hopeless this time!”",
        "“What is it, Nasie?” cried Goriot. “Tell us all about it, child! How\nwhite she is! Quick, do something, Delphine; be kind to her, and I\nwill love you even better, if that were possible.”",
        "“Poor Nasie!” said Mme. de Nucingen, drawing her sister to a chair.\n\"We are the only two people in the world whose love is always\nsufficient to forgive you everything. Family affection is the surest,\nyou see.”",
        "The Countess inhaled the salts and revived.",
        "“This will kill me!” said their father. “There,” he went on, stirring\nthe smouldering fire, “come nearer, both of you. It is cold. What is\nit, Nasie? Be quick and tell me, this is enough to––”",
        "“Well, then, my husband knows everything,” said the Countess. “Just\nimagine it; do you remember, father, that bill of Maxime’s some time\nago? Well, that was not the first. I had paid ever so many before\nthat. About the beginning of January M. de Trailles seemed very much\ntroubled. He said nothing to me; but it is so easy to read the hearts\nof those you love, a mere trifle is enough; and then you feel things\ninstinctively. Indeed, he was more tender and affectionate than ever,\nand I was happier than I had ever been before. Poor Maxime! in himself\nhe was really saying good-bye to me, so he has told me since; he meant\nto blow his brains out! At last I worried him so, and begged and\nimplored so hard; for two hours I knelt at his knees and prayed and\nentreated, and at last he told me–that he owed a hundred thousand\nfrancs. Oh! papa! a hundred thousand francs! I was beside myself! You\nhad not the money, I knew, I had eaten up all that you had––”",
        "“No,” said Goriot; “I could not have got it for you unless I had\nstolen it. But I would have done that for you, Nasie! I will do it\nyet.”",
        "The words came from him like a sob, a hoarse sound like the death\nrattle of a dying man; it seemed indeed like the agony of death when\nthe father’s love was powerless. There was a pause, and neither of the\nsisters spoke. It must have been selfishness indeed that could hear\nunmoved that cry of anguish that, like a pebble thrown over a\nprecipice, revealed the depths of his despair.",
        "“I found the money, father, by selling what was not mine to sell,” and\nthe Countess burst into tears.",
        "Delphine was touched; she laid her head on her sister’s shoulder, and\ncried too.",
        "“Then it is all true,” she said.",
        "Anastasie bowed her head, Mme. de Nucingen flung her arms about her,\nkissed her tenderly, and held her sister to her heart.",
        "“I shall always love you and never judge you, Nasie,” she said.",
        "“My angels,” murmured Goriot faintly. “Oh, why should it be trouble\nthat draws you together?”",
        "This warm and palpitating affection seemed to give the Countess\ncourage.",
        "“To save Maxime’s life,” she said, “to save all my own happiness, I\nwent to the money-lender you know of, a man of iron forged in\nhell-fire; nothing can melt him; I took all the family diamonds that\nM. de Restaud is so proud of–his and mine too–and sold them to that\nM. Gobseck. Sold them! Do you understand? I saved Maxime, but I am\nlost. Restaud found it all out.”",
        "“How? Who told him? I will kill him,” cried Goriot.",
        "“Yesterday he sent to tell me to come to his room. I went.\n. . . ’Anastasie,’ he said in a voice–oh! such a voice; that was\nenough, it told me everything–’where are your diamonds?’–’In my\nroom––’–’No,’ he said, looking straight at me, ’there they are on\nthat chest of drawers––’ and he lifted his handkerchief and showed\nme the casket. ’Do you know where they came from?’ he said. I fell at\nhis feet. . . . I cried; I besought him to tell me the death he wished\nto see me die.”",
        "“You said that!” cried Goriot. “By God in heaven, whoever lays a hand\non either of you so long as I am alive may reckon on being roasted by\nslow fires! Yes, I will cut him in pieces like . . .”",
        "Goriot stopped; the words died away in his throat.",
        "“And then, dear, he asked something worse than death of me. Oh! heaven\npreserve all other women from hearing such words as I heard then!”",
        "“I will murder that man,” said Goriot quietly. “But he has only one\nlife, and he deserves to die twice.–And then, what next?” he added,\nlooking at Anastasie.",
        "“Then,” the Countess resumed, “there was a pause, and he looked at me.\n’Anastasie,’ he said, ’I will bury this in silence; there shall be no\nseparation; there are the children. I will not kill M. de Trailles. I\nmight miss him if we fought, and as for other ways of getting rid of\nhim, I should come into collision with the law. If I killed him in\nyour arms, it would bring dishonor on those children. But if you do\nnot want to see your children perish, nor their father nor me, you\nmust first of all submit to two conditions. Answer me. Have I a child\nof my own?’ I answered, ’Yes,’–’Which?’–’Ernest, our eldest boy.’\n–’Very well,’ he said, ’and now swear to obey me in this particular\nfrom this time forward.’ I swore. ’You will make over your property to\nme when I require you to do so.’”",
        "“Do nothing of the kind!” cried Goriot. “Aha! M. de Restaud, you could\nnot make your wife happy; she has looked for happiness and found it\nelsewhere, and you make her suffer for your own ineptitude? He will\nhave to reckon with me. Make yourself easy, Nasie. Aha! he cares about\nhis heir! Good, very good. I will get hold of the boy; isn’t he my\ngrandson? What the blazes! I can surely go to see the brat! I will\nstow him away somewhere; I will take care of him, you may be quite\neasy. I will bring Restaud to terms, the monster! I shall say to him,\n’A word or two with you! If you want your son back again, give my\ndaughter her property, and leave her to do as she pleases.’”",
        "“Father!”",
        "“Yes. I am your father, Nasie, a father indeed! That rogue of a great\nlord had better not ill-treat my daughter. Tonnerre! What is it in\nmy veins? There is the blood of a tiger in me; I could tear those two\nmen to pieces! Oh! children, children! so this is what your lives are!\nWhy, it is death! . . . What will become of you when I shall be here\nno longer? Fathers ought to live as long as their children. Ah! Lord\nGod in heaven! how ill Thy world is ordered! Thou hast a Son, if what\nthey tell us is true, and yet Thou leavest us to suffer so through our\nchildren. My darlings, my darlings! to think that trouble only should\nbring you to me, that I should only see you with tears on your faces!\nAh! yes, yes, you love me, I see that you love me. Come to me and pour\nout your griefs to me; my heart is large enough to hold them all. Oh!\nyou might rend my heart in pieces, and every fragment would make a\nfather’s heart. If only I could bear all your sorrows for you!\n. . . Ah! you were so happy when you were little and still with\nme. . . .”",
        "“We have never been happy since,” said Delphine. “Where are the old\ndays when we slid down the sacks in the great granary?”",
        "“That is not all, father,” said Anastasie in Goriot’s ear. The old man\ngave a startled shudder. “The diamonds only sold for a hundred\nthousand francs. Maxime is hard pressed. There are twelve thousand\nfrancs still to pay. He has given me his word that he will be steady\nand give up play in future. His love is all that I have left in the\nworld. I have paid such a fearful price for it that I should die if I\nlose him now. I have sacrificed my fortune, my honor, my peace of\nmind, and my children for him. Oh! do something, so that at the least\nMaxime may be at large and live undisgraced in the world, where he\nwill assuredly make a career for himself. Something more than my\nhappiness is at stake; the children have nothing, and if he is sent to\nSainte-Pelagie all his prospects will be ruined.”",
        "“I haven’t the money, Nasie. I have nothing–nothing left. This is\nthe end of everything. Yes, the world is crumbling into ruin, I am\nsure. Fly! Save yourselves! Ah!–I have still my silver buckles left,\nand half-a-dozen silver spoons and forks, the first I ever had in my\nlife. But I have nothing else except my life annuity, twelve hundred\nfrancs . . .”",
        "“Then what has become of your money in the funds?”",
        "“I sold out, and only kept a trifle for my wants. I wanted twelve\nthousand francs to furnish some rooms for Delphine.”",
        "“In your own house?” asked Mme. de Restaud, looking at her sister.",
        "“What does it matter where they were?” asked Goriot. “The money is\nspent now.”",
        "“I see how it is,” said the Countess. “Rooms for M. de Rastignac. Poor\nDelphine, take warning by me!”",
        "“M. de Rastignac is incapable of ruining the woman he loves, dear.”",
        "“Thanks! Delphine. I thought you would have been kinder to me in my\ntroubles, but you never did love me.”",
        "“Yes, yes, she loves you, Nasie,” cried Goriot; “she was saying so\nonly just now. We were talking about you, and she insisted that you\nwere beautiful, and that she herself was only pretty!”",
        "“Pretty!” said the Countess. “She is as hard as a marble statue.”",
        "“And if I am?” cried Delphine, flushing up, “how have you treated me?\nYou would not recognize me; you closed the doors of every house\nagainst me; you have never let an opportunity of mortifying me slip\nby. And when did I come, as you were always doing, to drain our poor\nfather, a thousand francs at a time, till he is left as you see him\nnow? That is all your doing, sister! I myself have seen my father as\noften as I could. I have not turned him out of the house, and then\ncome and fawned upon him when I wanted money. I did not so much as\nknow that he had spent those twelve thousand francs on me. I am\neconomical, as you know; and when papa has made me presents, it has\nnever been because I came and begged for them.”",
        "“You were better off than I. M. de Marsay was rich, as you have reason\nto know. You always were as slippery as gold. Good-bye; I have neither\nsister nor––”",
        "“Oh! hush, hush, Nasie!” cried her father.",
        "“Nobody else would repeat what everybody has ceased to believe. You\nare an unnatural sister!” cried Delphine.",
        "“Oh, children, children! hush! hush! or I will kill myself before your\neyes.”",
        "“There, Nasie, I forgive you,” said Mme. de Nucingen; “you are very\nunhappy. But I am kinder than you are. How could you say that just\nwhen I was ready to do anything in the world to help you, even to be\nreconciled with my husband, which for my own sake I––Oh! it is just\nlike you; you have behaved cruelly to me all through these nine\nyears.”",
        "“Children, children, kiss each other!” cried the father. “You are\nangels, both of you.”",
        "“No. Let me alone,” cried the Countess shaking off the hand that her\nfather had laid on her arm. “She is more merciless than my husband.\nAny one might think she was a model of all the virtues herself!”",
        "“I would rather have people think that I owed money to M. de Marsay\nthan own that M. de Trailles had cost me more than two hundred\nthousand francs,” retorted Mme. de Nucingen.",
        "“Delphine!” cried the Countess, stepping towards her sister.",
        "“I shall tell you the truth about yourself if you begin to slander\nme,” said the Baroness coldly.",
        "“Delphine! you are a ––”",
        "Father Goriot sprang between them, grasped the Countess’ hand, and\nlaid his own over her mouth.",
        "“Good heavens, father! What have you been handling this morning?” said\nAnastasie.",
        "“Ah! well, yes, I ought not to have touched you,” said the poor\nfather, wiping his hands on his trousers, “but I have been packing up\nmy things; I did not know that you were coming to see me.”",
        "He was glad that he had drawn down her wrath upon himself.",
        "“Ah!” he sighed, as he sat down, “you children have broken my heart\nbetween you. This is killing me. My head feels as if it were on fire.\nBe good to each other and love each other! This will be the death of\nme! Delphine! Nasie! come, be sensible; you are both in the wrong.\nCome, Dedel,” he added, looking through his tears at the Baroness,\n\"she must have twelve thousand francs, you see; let us see if we can\nfind them for her. Oh, my girls, do not look at each other like that!\"\nand he sank on his knees beside Delphine. “Ask her to forgive you\n–just to please me,” he said in her ear. “She is more miserable than\nyou are. Come now, Dedel.”",
        "“Poor Nasie!” said Delphine, alarmed at the wild extravagant grief in\nher father’s face, “I was in the wrong, kiss me––”",
        "“Ah! that is like balm to my heart,” cried Father Goriot. “But how are\nwe to find twelve thousand francs? I might offer myself as a\nsubstitute in the army––”",
        "“Oh! father dear!” they both cried, flinging their arms about him.\n\"No, no!”",
        "“God reward you for the thought. We are not worth it, are we, Nasie?\"\nasked Delphine.",
        "“And besides, father dear, it would only be a drop in the bucket,\"\nobserved the Countess.",
        "“But is flesh and blood worth nothing?” cried the old man in his\ndespair. “I would give body and soul to save you, Nasie. I would do a\nmurder for the man who would rescue you. I would do, as Vautrin did,\ngo to the hulks, go––” he stopped as if struck by a thunderbolt, and\nput both hands to his head. “Nothing left!” he cried, tearing his\nhair. “If I only knew of a way to steal money, but it is so hard to do\nit, and then you can’t set to work by yourself, and it takes time to\nrob a bank. Yes, it is time I was dead; there is nothing left me to do\nbut to die. I am no good in the world; I am no longer a father! No.\nShe has come to me in her extremity, and, wretch that I am, I have\nnothing to give her. Ah! you put your money into a life annuity, old\nscoundrel; and had you not daughters? You did not love them. Die, die\nin a ditch, like the dog that you are! Yes, I am worse than a dog; a\nbeast would not have done as I have done! Oh! my head . . . it throbs\nas if it would burst.”",
        "“Papa!” cried both the young women at once, “do, pray, be reasonable!\"\nand they clung to him to prevent him from dashing his head against the\nwall. There was a sound of sobbing.",
        "Eugene, greatly alarmed, took the bill that bore Vautrin’s signature,\nsaw that the stamp would suffice for a larger sum, altered the\nfigures, made it into a regular bill for twelve thousand francs,\npayable to Goriot’s order, and went to his neighbor’s room.",
        "“Here is the money, madame,” he said, handing the piece of paper to\nher. “I was asleep; your conversation awoke me, and by this means I\nlearned all that I owed to M. Goriot. This bill can be discounted, and\nI shall meet it punctually at the due date.”",
        "The Countess stood motionless and speechless, but she held the bill in\nher fingers.",
        "“Delphine,” she said, with a white face, and her whole frame quivering\nwith indignation, anger, and rage, “I forgave you everything; God is\nmy witness that I forgave you, but I cannot forgive this! So this\ngentleman was there all the time, and you knew it! Your petty spite\nhas let you to wreak your vengeance on me by betraying my secrets, my\nlife, my children’s lives, my shame, my honor! There, you are nothing\nto me any longer. I hate you. I will do all that I can to injure you.\nI will . . .”",
        "Anger paralyzed her; the words died in her dry parched throat.",
        "“Why, he is my son, my child; he is your brother, your preserver!\"\ncried Goriot. “Kiss his hand, Nasie! Stay, I will embrace him myself,\"\nhe said, straining Eugene to his breast in a frenzied clasp. “Oh my\nboy! I will be more than a father to you; if I had God’s power, I\nwould fling worlds at your feet. Why don’t you kiss him, Nasie? He is\nnot a man, but an angel, a angel out of heaven.”",
        "“Never mind her, father; she is mad just now.”",
        "“Mad! am I? And what are you?” cried Mme. de Restaud.",
        "“Children, children, I shall die if you go on like this,” cried the\nold man, and he staggered and fell on the bed as if a bullet had\nstruck him.–\"They are killing me between them,” he said to himself.",
        "The Countess fixed her eyes on Eugene, who stood stock still; all his\nfaculties were numbed by this violent scene.",
        "“Sir? . . .” she said, doubt and inquiry in her face, tone, and\nbearing; she took no notice now of her father nor of Delphine, who was\nhastily unfastening his waistcoat.",
        "“Madame,” said Eugene, answering the question before it was asked, “I\nwill meet the bill, and keep silence about it.”",
        "“You have killed our father, Nasie!” said Delphine, pointing to\nGoriot, who lay unconscious on the bed. The Countess fled.",
        "“I freely forgive her,” said the old man, opening his eyes; “her\nposition is horrible; it would turn an older head than hers. Comfort\nNasie, and be nice to her, Delphine; promise it to your poor father\nbefore he dies,” he asked, holding Delphine’s hand in a convulsive\nclasp.",
        "“Oh! what ails you, father?” she cried in real alarm.",
        "“Nothing, nothing,” said Goriot; “it will go off. There is something\nheavy pressing on my forehead, a little headache. . . . Ah! poor\nNasie, what a life lies before her!”",
        "Just as he spoke, the Countess came back again and flung herself on\nher knees before him. “Forgive me!” she cried.",
        "“Come,” said her father, “you are hurting me still more.”",
        "“Monsieur,” the Countess said, turning to Rastignac, “misery made me\nunjust to you. You will be a brother to me, will you not?” and she\nheld out her hand. Her eyes were full of tears as she spoke.",
        "“Nasie,” cried Delphine, flinging her arms round her sister, “my\nlittle Nasie, let us forget and forgive.”",
        "“No, no,” cried Nasie; “I shall never forget!”",
        "“Dear angels,” cried Goriot, “it is as if a dark curtain over my eyes\nhad been raised; your voices have called me back to life. Kiss each\nother once more. Well, now, Nasie, that bill will save you, won’t it?”",
        "“I hope so. I say, papa, will you write your name on it?”",
        "“There! how stupid of me to forget that! But I am not feeling at all\nwell, Nasie, so you must not remember it against me. Send and let me\nknow as soon as you are out of your strait. No, I will go to you. No,\nafter all, I will not go; I might meet your husband, and I should kill\nhim on the spot. And as for signing away your property, I shall have a\nword to say about that. Quick, my child, and keep Maxime in order in\nfuture.”",
        "Eugene was too bewildered to speak.",
        "“Poor Anastasie, she always had a violent temper,” said Mme. de\nNucingen, “but she has a good heart.”",
        "“She came back for the endorsement,” said Eugene in Delphine’s ear.",
        "“Do you think so?”",
        "“I only wish I could think otherwise. Do not trust her,” he answered,\nraising his eyes as if he confided to heaven the thoughts that he did\nnot venture to express.",
        "“Yes. She is always acting a part to some extent.”",
        "“How do you feel now, dear Father Goriot?” asked Rastignac.",
        "“I should like to go to sleep,” he replied.",
        "Eugene helped him to bed, and Delphine sat by the bedside, holding his\nhand until he fell asleep. Then she went.",
        "“This evening at the Italiens,” she said to Eugene, “and you can let\nme know how he is. To-morrow you will leave this place, monsieur. Let\nus go into your room.–Oh! how frightful!” she cried on the threshold.\n\"Why, you are even worse lodged than our father. Eugene, you have\nbehaved well. I would love you more if that were possible; but, dear\nboy, if you are to succeed in life, you must not begin by flinging\ntwelve thousand francs out of the windows like that. The Comte de\nTrailles is a confirmed gambler. My sister shuts her eyes to it. He\nwould have made the twelve thousand francs in the same way that he\nwins and loses heaps of gold.”",
        "A groan from the next room brought them back to Goriot’s bedside; to\nall appearances he was asleep, but the two lovers caught the words,\n\"They are not happy!” Whether he was awake or sleeping, the tone in\nwhich they were spoken went to his daughter’s heart. She stole up to\nthe pallet-bed on which her father lay, and kissed his forehead. He\nopened his eyes.",
        "“Ah! Delphine!” he said.",
        "“How are you now?” she asked.",
        "“Quite comfortable. Do not worry about me; I shall get up presently.\nDon’t stay with me, children; go, go and be happy.”",
        "Eugene went back with Delphine as far as her door; but he was not easy\nabout Goriot, and would not stay to dinner, as she proposed. He wanted\nto be back at the Maison Vauquer. Father Goriot had left his room, and\nwas just sitting down to dinner as he came in. Bianchon had placed\nhimself where he could watch the old man carefully; and when the old\nvermicelli maker took up his square of bread and smelled it to find\nout the quality of the flour, the medical student, studying him\nclosely, saw that the action was purely mechanical, and shook his\nhead.",
        "“Just come and sit over here, hospitaller of Cochin,” said Eugene.",
        "Bianchon went the more willingly because his change of place brought\nhim next to the old lodger.",
        "“What is wrong with him?” asked Rastignac.",
        "“It is all up with him, or I am much mistaken! Something very\nextraordinary must have taken place; he looks to me as if he were in\nimminent danger of serous apoplexy. The lower part of his face is\ncomposed enough, but the upper part is drawn and distorted. Then there\nis that peculiar look about the eyes that indicates an effusion of\nserum in the brain; they look as though they were covered with a film\nof fine dust, do you notice? I shall know more about it by to-morrow\nmorning.”",
        "“Is there any cure for it?”",
        "“None. It might be possible to stave death off for a time if a way\ncould be found of setting up a reaction in the lower extremities; but\nif the symptoms do not abate by to-morrow evening, it will be all over\nwith him, poor old fellow! Do you know what has happened to bring this\non? There must have been some violent shock, and his mind has given\nway.”",
        "“Yes, there was,” said Rastignac, remembering how the two daughters\nhad struck blow on blow at their father’s heart.",
        "“But Delphine at any rate loves her father,” he said to himself.",
        "That evening at the opera Rastignac chose his words carefully, lest he\nshould give Mme. de Nucingen needless alarm.",
        "“Do not be anxious about him,” she said, however, as soon as Eugene\nbegan, “our father has really a strong constitution, but this morning\nwe gave him a shock. Our whole fortunes were in peril, so the thing\nwas serious, you see. I could not live if your affection did not make\nme insensible to troubles that I should once have thought too hard to\nbear. At this moment I have but one fear left, but one misery to\ndread–to lose the love that has made me feel glad to live. Everything\nelse is as nothing to me compared with our love; I care for nothing\nelse, for you are all the world to me. If I feel glad to be rich, it\nis for your sake. To my shame be it said, I think of my lover before\nmy father. Do you ask why? I cannot tell you, but all my life is in\nyou. My father gave me a heart, but you have taught it to beat. The\nwhole world may condemn me; what does it matter if I stand acquitted\nin your eyes, for you have no right to think ill of me for the faults\nwhich a tyrannous love has forced me to commit for you! Do you think\nme an unnatural daughter? Oh! no, no one could help loving such a dear\nkind father as ours. But how could I hide the inevitable consequences\nof our miserable marriages from him? Why did he allow us to marry when\nwe did? Was it not his duty to think for us and foresee for us? To-day\nI know he suffers as much as we do, but how can it be helped? And as\nfor comforting him, we could not comfort him in the least. Our\nresignation would give him more pain and hurt him far more than\ncomplaints and upbraidings. There are times in life when everything\nturns to bitterness.”",
        "Eugene was silent, the artless and sincere outpouring made an\nimpression on him.",
        "Parisian women are often false, intoxicated with vanity, selfish and\nself-absorbed, frivolous and shallow; yet of all women, when they\nlove, they sacrifice their personal feelings to their passion; they\nrise but so much the higher for all the pettiness overcome in their\nnature, and become sublime. Then Eugene was struck by the profound\ndiscernment and insight displayed by this woman in judging of natural\naffection, when a privileged affection had separated and set her at a\ndistance apart. Mme. de Nucingen was piqued by the silence,",
        "“What are you thinking about?” she asked.",
        "“I am thinking about what you said just now. Hitherto I have always\nfelt sure that I cared far more for you than you did for me.”",
        "She smiled, and would not give way to the happiness she felt, lest\ntheir talk should exceed the conventional limits of propriety. She had\nnever heard the vibrating tones of a sincere and youthful love; a few\nmore words, and she feared for her self-control.",
        "“Eugene,” she said, changing the conversation, “I wonder whether you\nknow what has been happening? All Paris will go to Mme. de Beauseant’s\nto-morrow. The Rochefides and the Marquis d’Ajuda have agreed to keep\nthe matter a profound secret, but to-morrow the king will sign the\nmarriage-contract, and your poor cousin the Vicomtesse knows nothing\nof it as yet. She cannot put off her ball, and the Marquis will not be\nthere. People are wondering what will happen?”",
        "“The world laughs at baseness and connives at it. But this will kill\nMme. de Beauseant.”",
        "“Oh, no,” said Delphine, smiling, “you do not know that kind of woman.\nWhy, all Paris will be there, and so shall I; I ought to go there for\nyour sake.”",
        "“Perhaps, after all, it is one of those absurd reports that people set\nin circulation here.”",
        "“We shall know the truth to-morrow.”",
        "Eugene did not return to the Maison Vauquer. He could not forego the\npleasure of occupying his new rooms in the Rue d’Artois. Yesterday\nevening he had been obliged to leave Delphine soon after midnight, but\nthat night it was Delphine who stayed with him until two o’clock in\nthe morning. He rose late, and waited for Mme. de Nucingen, who came\nabout noon to breakfast with him. Youth snatches eagerly at these rosy\nmoments of happiness, and Eugene had almost forgotten Goriot’s\nexistence. The pretty things that surrounded him were growing\nfamiliar; this domestication in itself was one long festival for him,\nand Mme. de Nucingen was there to glorify it all by her presence. It\nwas four o’clock before they thought of Goriot, and of how he had\nlooked forward to the new life in that house. Eugene said that the old\nman ought to be moved at once, lest he should grow too ill to move. He\nleft Delphine and hurried back to the lodging-house. Neither Father\nGoriot nor young Bianchon was in the dining-room with the others.",
        "“Aha!” said the painter as Eugene came in, “Father Goriot has broken\ndown at last. Bianchon is upstairs with him. One of his daughters–the\nComtesse de Restaurama–came to see the old gentleman, and he would\nget up and go out, and made himself worse. Society is about to lose\none of its brightest ornaments.”",
        "Rastignac sprang to the staircase.",
        "“Hey! Monsieur Eugene!”",
        "“Monsieur Eugene, the mistress is calling you,” shouted Sylvie.",
        "“It is this, sir,” said the widow. “You and M. Goriot should by rights\nhave moved out on the 15th of February. That was three days ago;\nto-day is the 18th, I ought really to be paid a month in advance; but\nif you will engage to pay for both, I shall be quite satisfied.”",
        "“Why can’t you trust him?”",
        "“Trust him, indeed! If the old gentleman went off his head and died,\nthose daughters of his would not pay me a farthing, and his things\nwon’t fetch ten francs. This morning he went out with all the spoons\nand forks he has left, I don’t know why. He had got himself up to look\nquite young, and–Lord, forgive me–but I thought he had rouge on his\ncheeks; he looked quite young again.”",
        "“I will be responsible,” said Eugene, shuddering with horror, for he\nforesaw the end.",
        "He climbed the stairs and reached Father Goriot’s room. The old man\nwas tossing on his bed. Bianchon was with him.",
        "“Good-evening, father,” said Eugene.",
        "The old man turned his glassy eyes on him, smiled gently, and said:",
        "“How is she?”",
        "“She is quite well. But how are you?”",
        "“There is nothing much the matter.”",
        "“Don’t tire him,” said Bianchon, drawing Eugene into a corner of the\nroom.",
        "“Well?” asked Rastignac.",
        "“Nothing but a miracle can save him now. Serous congestion has set in;\nI have put on mustard plasters, and luckily he can feel them, they are\nacting.”",
        "“Is it possible to move him?”",
        "“Quite out of the question. He must stay where he is, and be kept as\nquiet as possible––”",
        "“Dear Bianchon,” said Eugene, “we will nurse him between us.”",
        "“I have had the head physician round from my hospital to see him.”",
        "“And what did he say?”",
        "“He will give no opinion till to-morrow evening. He promised to look\nin again at the end of the day. Unluckily, the preposterous creature\nmust needs go and do something foolish this morning; he will not say\nwhat it was. He is as obstinate as a mule. As soon as I begin to talk\nto him he pretends not to hear, and lies as if he were asleep instead\nof answering, or if he opens his eyes he begins to groan. Some time\nthis morning he went out on foot in the streets, nobody knows where he\nwent, and he took everything that he had of any value with him. He has\nbeen driving some confounded bargain, and it has been too much for his\nstrength. One of his daughters has been here.”",
        "“Was it the Countess?” asked Eugene. “A tall, dark-haired woman, with\nlarge bright eyes, slender figure, and little feet?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Leave him to me for a bit,” said Rastignac. “I will make him confess;\nhe will tell me all about it.”",
        "“And meanwhile I will get my dinner. But try not to excite him; there\nis still some hope left.”",
        "“All right.”",
        "“How they will enjoy themselves to-morrow,” said Father Goriot when\nthey were alone. “They are going to a grand ball.”",
        "“What were you doing this morning, papa, to make yourself so poorly\nthis evening that you have to stop in bed?”",
        "“Nothing.”",
        "“Did not Anastasie come to see you?” demanded Rastignac.",
        "“Yes,” said Father Goriot.",
        "“Well, then, don’t keep anything from me. What more did she want of\nyou?”",
        "“Oh, she was very miserable,” he answered, gathering up all his\nstrength to speak. “It was this way, my boy. Since that affair of the\ndiamonds, Nasie has not had a penny of her own. For this ball she had\nordered a golden gown like a setting for a jewel. Her mantuamaker, a\nwoman without a conscience, would not give her credit, so Nasie’s\nwaiting-woman advanced a thousand francs on account. Poor Nasie!\nreduced to such shifts! It cut me to the heart to think of it! But\nwhen Nasie’s maid saw how things were between her master and mistress,\nshe was afraid of losing her money, and came to an understanding with\nthe dressmaker, and the woman refuses to send the ball-dress until the\nmoney is paid. The gown is ready, and the ball is to-morrow night!\nNasie was in despair. She wanted to borrow my forks and spoons to pawn\nthem. Her husband is determined that she shall go and wear the\ndiamonds, so as to contradict the stories that are told all over\nParis. How can she go to that heartless scoundrel and say, ’I owe a\nthousand francs to my dressmaker; pay her for me!’ She cannot. I saw\nthat myself. Delphine will be there too in a superb toilette, and\nAnastasie ought not to be outshone by her younger sister. And then\n–she was drowned in tears, poor girl! I felt so humbled yesterday when\nI had not the twelve thousand francs, that I would have given the rest\nof my miserable life to wipe out that wrong. You see, I could have\nborne anything once, but latterly this want of money has broken my\nheart. Oh! I did not do it by halves; I titivated myself up a bit, and\nwent out and sold my spoons and forks and buckles for six hundred\nfrancs; then I went to old Daddy Gobseck, and sold a year’s interest\non my annuity for four hundred francs down. Pshaw! I can live on dry\nbread, as I did when I was a young man; if I have done it before, I\ncan do it again. My Nasie shall have one happy evening, at any rate.\nShe shall be smart. The banknote for a thousand francs is under my\npillow; it warms me to have it lying there under my head, for it is\ngoing to make my poor Nasie happy. She can turn that bad girl Victoire\nout of the house. A servant that cannot trust her mistress, did any\none ever hear the like! I shall be quite well to-morrow. Nasie is\ncoming at ten o’clock. They must not think that I am ill, or they will\nnot go to the ball; they will stop and take care of me. To-morrow\nNasie will come and hold me in her arms as if I were one of her\nchildren; her kisses will make me well again. After all, I might have\nspent the thousand francs on physic; I would far rather give them to\nmy little Nasie, who can charm all the pain away. At any rate, I am\nsome comfort to her in her misery; and that makes up for my unkindness\nin buying an annuity. She is in the depths, and I cannot draw her out\nof them now. Oh! I will go into business again, I will buy wheat in\nOdessa; out there, wheat fetches a quarter of the price it sells for\nhere. There is a law against the importation of grain, but the good\nfolk who made the law forgot to prohibit the introduction of wheat\nproducts and food stuffs made from corn. Hey! hey! . . . That struck\nme this morning. There is a fine trade to be done in starch.”",
        "Eugene, watching the old man’s face, thought that his friend was\nlight-headed.",
        "“Come,” he said, “do not talk any more, you must rest––” Just then\nBianchon came up, and Eugene went down to dinner.",
        "The two students sat up with him that night, relieving each other in\nturn. Bianchon brought up his medical books and studied; Eugene wrote\nletters home to his mother and sisters. Next morning Bianchon thought\nthe symptoms more hopeful, but the patient’s condition demanded\ncontinual attention, which the two students alone were willing to\ngive–a task impossible to describe in the squeamish phraseology of\nthe epoch. Leeches must be applied to the wasted body, the poultices\nand hot foot-baths, and other details of the treatment required the\nphysical strength and devotion of the two young men. Mme. de Restaud\ndid not come; but she sent a messenger for the money.",
        "“I expected she would come herself; but it would have been a pity for\nher to come, she would have been anxious about me,” said the father,\nand to all appearances he was well content.",
        "At seven o’clock that evening Therese came with a letter from\nDelphine.",
        " “What are you doing, dear friend? I have been loved for a very\n  little while, and I am neglected already? In the confidences of\n  heart and heart, I have learned to know your soul–you are too\n  noble not to be faithful for ever, for you know that love with all\n  its infinite subtle changes of feeling is never the same. Once you\n  said, as we were listening to the Prayer in Mose in Egitto, ’For\n  some it is the monotony of a single note; for others, it is the\n  infinite of sound.’ Remember that I am expecting you this evening\n  to take me to Mme. de Beauseant’s ball. Every one knows now that\n  the King signed M. d’Ajuda’s marriage-contract this morning, and\n  the poor Vicomtesse knew nothing of it until two o’clock this\n  afternoon. All Paris will flock to her house, of course, just as a\n  crowd fills the Place de Greve to see an execution. It is\n  horrible, is it not, to go out of curiosity to see if she will\n  hide her anguish, and whether she will die courageously? I\n  certainly should not go, my friend, if I had been at her house\n  before; but, of course, she will not receive society any more\n  after this, and all my efforts would be in vain. My position is a\n  very unusual one, and besides, I am going there partly on your\n  account. I am waiting for you. If you are not beside me in less\n  than two hours, I do not know whether I could forgive such\n  treason.”",
        "Rastignac took up a pen and wrote:",
        " “I am waiting till the doctor comes to know if there is any hope of\n  your father’s life. He is lying dangerously ill. I will come and\n  bring you the news, but I am afraid it may be a sentence of death.\n  When I come you can decide whether you can go to the ball.–Yours\n  a thousand times.”",
        "At half-past eight the doctor arrived. He did not take a very hopeful\nview of the case, but thought that there was no immediate danger.\nImprovements and relapses might be expected, and the good man’s life\nand reason hung in the balance.",
        "“It would be better for him to die at once,” the doctor said as he\ntook leave.",
        "Eugene left Goriot to Bianchon’s care, and went to carry the sad news\nto Mme. de Nucingen. Family feeling lingered in her, and this must put\nan end for the present to her plans of amusement.",
        "“Tell her to enjoy her evening as if nothing had happened,” cried\nGoriot. He had been lying in a sort of stupor, but he suddenly sat\nupright as Eugene went out.",
        "Eugene, half heartbroken, entered Delphine’s. Her hair had been\ndressed; she wore her dancing slippers; she had only to put on her\nball-dress; but when the artist is giving the finishing stroke to his\ncreation, the last touches require more time than the whole groundwork\nof the picture.",
        "“Why, you are not dressed!” she cried.",
        "“Madame, your father––”",
        "“My father again!” she exclaimed, breaking in upon him. “You need not\nteach me what is due to my father, I have known my father this long\nwhile. Not a word, Eugene. I will hear what you have to say when you\nare dressed. My carriage is waiting, take it, go round to your rooms\nand dress, Therese has put out everything in readiness for you. Come\nback as soon as you can; we will talk about my father on the way to\nMme. de Beauseant’s. We must go early; if we have to wait our turn in\na row of carriages, we shall be lucky if we get there by eleven\no’clock.”",
        "“Madame––”",
        "“Quick! not a word!” she cried, darting into her dressing-room for a\nnecklace.",
        "“Do go, Monsieur Eugene, or you will vex madame,” said Therese,\nhurrying him away; and Eugene was too horror-stricken by this elegant\nparricide to resist.",
        "He went to his rooms and dressed, sad, thoughtful, and dispirited. The\nworld of Paris was like an ocean of mud for him just then; and it\nseemed that whoever set foot in that black mire must needs sink into\nit up to the chin.",
        "“Their crimes are paltry,” said Eugene to himself. “Vautrin was\ngreater.”",
        "He had seen society in its three great phases–Obedience, Struggle,\nand Revolt; the Family, the World, and Vautrin; and he hesitated in\nhis choice. Obedience was dull, Revolt impossible, Struggle hazardous.\nHis thoughts wandered back to the home circle. He thought of the quiet\nuneventful life, the pure happiness of the days spent among those who\nloved him there. Those loving and beloved beings passed their lives in\nobedience to the natural laws of the hearth, and in that obedience\nfound a deep and constant serenity, unvexed by torments such as these.\nYet, for all his good impulses, he could not bring himself to make\nprofession of the religion of pure souls to Delphine, nor to prescribe\nthe duties of piety to her in the name of love. His education had\nbegun to bear its fruits; he loved selfishly already. Besides, his\ntact had discovered to him the real nature of Delphine; he divined\ninstinctively that she was capable of stepping over her father’s\ncorpse to go to the ball; and within himself he felt that he had\nneither the strength of mind to play the part of mentor, nor the\nstrength of character to vex her, nor the courage to leave her to go\nalone.",
        "“She would never forgive me for putting her in the wrong over it,” he\nsaid to himself. Then he turned the doctor’s dictum over in his mind;\nhe tried to believe that Goriot was not so dangerously ill as he had\nimagined, and ended by collecting together a sufficient quantity of\ntraitorous excuses for Delphine’s conduct. She did not know how ill\nher father was; the kind old man himself would have made her go to the\nball if she had gone to see him. So often it happens that this one or\nthat stands condemned by the social laws that govern family relations;\nand yet there are peculiar circumstances in the case, differences of\ntemperament, divergent interests, innumerable complications of family\nlife that excuse the apparent offence.",
        "Eugene did not wish to see too clearly; he was ready to sacrifice his\nconscience to his mistress. Within the last few days his whole life\nhad undergone a change. Woman had entered into his world and thrown it\ninto chaos, family claims dwindled away before her; she had\nappropriated all his being to her uses. Rastignac and Delphine found\neach other at a crisis in their lives when their union gave them the\nmost poignant bliss. Their passion, so long proved, had only gained in\nstrength by the gratified desire that often extinguishes passion. This\nwoman was his, and Eugene recognized that not until then had he loved\nher; perhaps love is only gratitude for pleasure. This woman, vile or\nsublime, he adored for the pleasure she had brought as her dower; and\nDelphine loved Rastignac as Tantalus would have loved some angel who\nhad satisfied his hunger and quenched the burning thirst in his\nparched throat.",
        "“Well,” said Mme. de Nucingen when he came back in evening dress, “how\nis my father?”",
        "“Very dangerously ill,” he answered; “if you will grant me a proof of\nyour affections, we will just go in to see him on the way.”",
        "“Very well,” she said. “Yes, but afterwards. Dear Eugene, do be nice,\nand don’t preach to me. Come.”",
        "They set out. Eugene said nothing for a while.",
        "“What is it now?” she asked.",
        "“I can hear the death-rattle in your father’s throat,” he said almost\nangrily. And with the hot indignation of youth, he told the story of\nMme. de Restaud’s vanity and cruelty, of her father’s final act of\nself-sacrifice, that had brought about this struggle between life and\ndeath, of the price that had been paid for Anastasie’s golden\nembroideries. Delphine cried.",
        "“I shall look frightful,” she thought. She dried her tears.",
        "“I will nurse my father; I will not leave his bedside,” she said\naloud.",
        "“Ah! now you are as I would have you,” exclaimed Rastignac.",
        "The lamps of five hundred carriages lit up the darkness about the\nHotel de Beauseant. A gendarme in all the glory of his uniform stood\non either side of the brightly lighted gateway. The great world was\nflocking thither that night in its eager curiosity to see the great\nlady at the moment of her fall, and the rooms on the ground floor were\nalready full to overflowing, when Mme. de Nucingen and Rastignac\nappeared. Never since Louis XIV. tore her lover away from La grand\nMademoiselle, and the whole court hastened to visit that unfortunate\nprincess, had a disastrous love affair made such a sensation in Paris.\nBut the youngest daughter of the almost royal house of Burgundy had\nrisen proudly above her pain, and moved till the last moment like a\nqueen in this world–its vanities had always been valueless for her,\nsave in so far as they contributed to the triumph of her passion. The\nsalons were filled with the most beautiful women in Paris, resplendent\nin their toilettes, and radiant with smiles. Ministers and\nambassadors, the most distinguished men at court, men bedizened with\ndecorations, stars, and ribbons, men who bore the most illustrious\nnames in France, had gathered about the Vicomtesse.",
        "The music of the orchestra vibrated in wave after wave of sound from\nthe golden ceiling of the palace, now made desolate for its queen.",
        "Madame de Beauseant stood at the door of the first salon to receive\nthe guests who were styled her friends. She was dressed in white, and\nwore no ornament in the plaits of hair braided about her head; her\nface was calm; there was no sign there of pride, nor of pain, nor of\njoy that she did not feel. No one could read her soul; she stood there\nlike some Niobe carved in marble. For a few intimate friends there was\na tinge of satire in her smile; but no scrutiny saw any change in her,\nnor had she looked otherwise in the days of the glory of her\nhappiness. The most callous of her guests admired her as young Rome\napplauded some gladiator who could die smiling. It seemed as if\nsociety had adorned itself for a last audience of one of its\nsovereigns.",
        "“I was afraid that you would not come,” she said to Rastignac.",
        "“Madame,” he said, in an unsteady voice, taking her speech as a\nreproach, “I shall be the last to go, that is why I am here.”",
        "“Good,” she said, and she took his hand. “You are perhaps the only one\nI can trust here among all these. Oh, my friend, when you love, love a\nwoman whom you are sure that you can love always. Never forsake a\nwoman.”",
        "She took Rastignac’s arm, and went towards a sofa in the card-room.",
        "“I want you to go to the Marquis,” she said. “Jacques, my footman,\nwill go with you; he has a letter that you will take. I am asking the\nMarquis to give my letters back to me. He will give them all up, I\nlike to think that. When you have my letters, go up to my room with\nthem. Some one shall bring me word.”",
        "She rose to go to meet the Duchesse de Langeais, her most intimate\nfriend, who had come like the rest of the world.",
        "Rastignac went. He asked for the Marquis d’Ajuda at the Hotel\nRochefide, feeling certain that the latter would be spending his\nevening there, and so it proved. The Marquis went to his own house\nwith Rastignac, and gave a casket to the student, saying as he did so,\n\"They are all there.”",
        "He seemed as if he was about to say something to Eugene, to ask about\nthe ball, or the Vicomtesse; perhaps he was on the brink of the\nconfession that, even then, he was in despair, and knew that his\nmarriage had been a fatal mistake; but a proud gleam shone in his\neyes, and with deplorable courage he kept his noblest feelings a\nsecret.",
        "“Do not even mention my name to her, my dear Eugene.” He grasped\nRastignac’s hand sadly and affectionately, and turned away from him.\nEugene went back to the Hotel Beauseant, the servant took him to the\nVicomtesse’s room. There were signs there of preparations for a\njourney. He sat down by the fire, fixed his eyes on the cedar wood\ncasket, and fell into deep mournful musings. Mme. de Beauseant loomed\nlarge in these imaginings, like a goddess in the Iliad.",
        "“Ah! my friend! . . .” said the Vicomtesse; she crossed the room and\nlaid her hand on Rastignac’s shoulder. He saw the tears in his\ncousin’s uplifted eyes, saw that one hand was raised to take the\ncasket, and that the fingers of the other trembled. Suddenly she took\nthe casket, put it in the fire, and watched it burn.",
        "“They are dancing,” she said. “They all came very early; but death\nwill be long in coming. Hush! my friend,” and she laid a finger on\nRastignac’s lips, seeing that he was about to speak. “I shall never\nsee Paris again. I am taking my leave of the world. At five o’clock\nthis morning I shall set out on my journey; I mean to bury myself in\nthe remotest part of Normandy. I have had very little time to make my\narrangements; since three o’clock this afternoon I have been busy\nsigning documents, setting my affairs in order; there was no one whom\nI could send to . . .”",
        "She broke off.",
        "“He was sure to be . . .”",
        "Again she broke off; the weight of her sorrow was more than she could\nbear. In such moments as these everything is agony, and some words are\nimpossible to utter.",
        "“And so I counted upon you to do me this last piece of service this\nevening,” she said. “I should like to give you some pledge of\nfriendship. I shall often think of you. You have seemed to me to be\nkind and noble, fresh-hearted and true, in this world where such\nqualities are seldom found. I should like you to think sometimes of\nme. Stay,” she said, glancing about her, “there is this box that has\nheld my gloves. Every time I opened it before going to a ball or to\nthe theatre, I used to feel that I must be beautiful, because I was so\nhappy; and I never touched it except to lay some gracious memory in\nit: there is so much of my old self in it, of a Madame de Beauseant\nwho now lives no longer. Will you take it? I will leave directions\nthat it is to be sent to you in the Rue d’Artois.–Mme. de Nucingen\nlooked very charming this evening. Eugene, you must love her. Perhaps\nwe may never see each other again, my friend; but be sure of this,\nthat I shall pray for you who have been kind to me.–Now, let us go\ndownstairs. People shall not think that I am weeping. I have all time\nand eternity before me, and where I am going I shall be alone, and no\none will ask me the reason of my tears. One last look round first.”",
        "She stood for a moment. Then she covered her eyes with her hands for\nan instant, dashed away the tears, bathed her face with cold water,\nand took the student’s arm.",
        "“Let us go!” she said.",
        "This suffering, endured with such noble fortitude, shook Eugene with a\nmore violent emotion than he had felt before. They went back to the\nballroom, and Mme. de Beauseant went through the rooms on Eugene’s arm\n–the last delicately gracious act of a gracious woman. In another\nmoment he saw the sisters, Mme. de Restaud and Mme. de Nucingen. The\nCountess shone in all the glory of her magnificent diamonds; every\nstone must have scorched like fire, she was never to wear them again.\nStrong as love and pride might be in her, she found it difficult to\nmeet her husband’s eyes. The sight of her was scarcely calculated to\nlighten Rastignac’s sad thoughts; through the blaze of those diamonds\nhe seemed to see the wretched pallet-bed on which Father Goriot was\nlying. The Vicomtesse misread his melancholy; she withdrew her hand\nfrom his arm.",
        "“Come,” she said, “I must not deprive you of a pleasure.”",
        "Eugene was soon claimed by Delphine. She was delighted by the\nimpression that she had made, and eager to lay at her lover’s feet the\nhomage she had received in this new world in which she hoped to live\nand move henceforth.",
        "“What do you think of Nasie?” she asked him.",
        "“She has discounted everything, even her own father’s death,” said\nRastignac.",
        "Towards four o’clock in the morning the rooms began to empty. A little\nlater the music ceased, and the Duchesse de Langeais and Rastignac\nwere left in the great ballroom. The Vicomtesse, who thought to find\nthe student there alone, came back there at last. She had taken leave\nof M. de Beauseant, who had gone off to bed, saying again as he went,\n\"It is a great pity, my dear, to shut yourself up at your age! Pray\nstay among us.”",
        "Mme. de Beauseant saw the Duchesse, and, in spite of herself, an\nexclamation broke from her.",
        "“I saw how it was, Clara,” said Mme. de Langeais. “You are going from\namong us, and you will never come back. But you must not go until you\nhave heard me, until we have understood each other.”",
        "She took her friend’s arm, and they went together into the next room.\nThere the Duchess looked at her with tears in her eyes; she held her\nfriend in close embrace and kissed her cheek.",
        "“I could not let you go without a word, dearest; the remorse would\nhave been too hard to bear. You can count upon me as surely as upon\nyourself. You have shown yourself great this evening; I feel that I am\nworthy of our friendship, and I mean to prove myself worthy of it. I\nhave not always been kind; I was in the wrong; forgive me, dearest; I\nwish I could unsay anything that may have hurt you; I take back those\nwords. One common sorrow has brought us together again, for I do not\nknow which of us is the more miserable. M. de Montriveau was not here\nto-night; do you understand what that means?–None of those who saw\nyou to-night, Clara, will ever forget you. I mean to make one last\neffort. If I fail, I shall go into a convent. Clara, where are you\ngoing?”",
        "“Into Normandy, to Courcelles. I shall love and pray there until the\nday when God shall take me from this world.–M. de Rastignac!” called\nthe Vicomtesse, in a tremulous voice, remembering that the young man\nwas waiting there.",
        "The student knelt to kiss his cousin’s hand.",
        "“Good-bye, Antoinette!” said Mme. de Beauseant. “May you be happy.\"\n–She turned to the student. “You are young,” she said; “you have some\nbeliefs still left. I have been privileged, like some dying people, to\nfind sincere and reverent feeling in those about me as I take my leave\nof this world.”",
        "It was nearly five o’clock that morning when Rastignac came away. He\nhad put Mme. de Beauseant into her traveling carriage, and received\nher last farewells, spoken amid fast-falling tears; for no greatness\nis so great that it can rise above the laws of human affection, or\nlive beyond the jurisdiction of pain, as certain demagogues would have\nthe people believe. Eugene returned on foot to the Maison Vauquer\nthrough the cold and darkness. His education was nearly complete.",
        "“There is no hope for poor Father Goriot,” said Bianchon, as Rastignac\ncame into the room. Eugene looked for a while at the sleeping man,\nthen he turned to his friend. “Dear fellow, you are content with the\nmodest career you have marked out for yourself; keep to it. I am in\nhell, and I must stay there. Believe everything that you hear said of\nthe world, nothing is too impossibly bad. No Juvenal could paint the\nhorrors hidden away under the covering of gems and gold.”",
        "At two o’clock in the afternoon Bianchon came to wake Rastignac, and\nbegged him to take charge of Goriot, who had grown worse as the day\nwore on. The medical student was obliged to go out.",
        "“Poor old man, he has not two days to live, maybe not many hours,” he\nsaid; “but we must do our utmost, all the same, to fight the disease.\nIt will be a very troublesome case, and we shall want money. We can\nnurse him between us, of course, but, for my own part, I have not a\npenny. I have turned out his pockets, and rummaged through his\ndrawers–result, nix. I asked him about it while his mind was clear,\nand he told me he had not a farthing of his own. What have you?”",
        "“I have twenty francs left,” said Rastignac; “but I will take them to\nthe roulette table, I shall be sure to win.”",
        "“And if you lose?”",
        "“Then I shall go to his sons-in-law and his daughters and ask them for\nmoney.”",
        "“And suppose they refuse?” Bianchon retorted. “The most pressing thing\njust now is not really money; we must put mustard poultices, as hot as\nthey can be made, on his feet and legs. If he calls out, there is\nstill some hope for him. You know how to set about doing it, and\nbesides, Christophe will help you. I am going round to the dispensary\nto persuade them to let us have the things we want on credit. It is a\npity that we could not move him to the hospital; poor fellow, he would\nbe better there. Well, come along, I leave you in charge; you must\nstay with him till I come back.”",
        "The two young men went back to the room where the old man was lying.\nEugene was startled at the change in Goriot’s face, so livid,\ndistorted, and feeble.",
        "“How are you, papa?” he said, bending over the pallet-bed. Goriot\nturned his dull eyes upon Eugene, looked at him attentively, and did\nnot recognize him. It was more than the student could bear; the tears\ncame into his eyes.",
        "“Bianchon, ought we to have the curtains put up in the windows?”",
        "“No, the temperature and the light do not affect him now. It would be\na good thing for him if he felt heat or cold; but we must have a fire\nin any case to make tisanes and heat the other things. I will send\nround a few sticks; they will last till we can have in some firewood.\nI burned all the bark fuel you had left, as well as his, poor man,\nyesterday and during the night. The place is so damp that the water\nstood in drops on the walls; I could hardly get the room dry.\nChristophe came in and swept the floor, but the place is like a\nstable; I had to burn juniper, the smell was something horrible.",
        "“Mon Dieu!” said Rastignac. “To think of those daughters of his.”",
        "“One moment, if he asks for something to drink, give him this,” said\nthe house student, pointing to a large white jar. “If he begins to\ngroan, and the belly feels hot and hard to the touch, you know what to\ndo; get Christophe to help you. If he should happen to grow much\nexcited, and begin to talk a good deal and even to ramble in his talk,\ndo not be alarmed. It would not be a bad symptom. But send Christophe\nto the Hospice Cochin. Our doctor, my chum, or I will come and apply\nmoxas. We had a great consultation this morning while you were asleep.\nA surgeon, a pupil of Gall’s came, and our house surgeon, and the head\nphysician from the Hotel-Dieu. Those gentlemen considered that the\nsymptoms were very unusual and interesting; the case must be carefully\nwatched, for it throws a light on several obscure and rather important\nscientific problems. One of the authorities says that if there is more\npressure of serum on one or other portion of the brain, it should\naffect his mental capacities in such and such directions. So if he\nshould talk, notice very carefully what kind of ideas his mind seems\nto run on; whether memory, or penetration, or the reasoning faculties\nare exercised; whether sentiments or practical questions fill his\nthoughts; whether he makes forecasts or dwells on the past; in fact;\nyou must be prepared to give an accurate report of him. It is quite\nlikely that the extravasation fills the whole brain, in which case he\nwill die in the imbecile state in which he is lying now. You cannot\ntell anything about these mysterious nervous diseases. Suppose the\ncrash came here,” said Bianchon, touching the back of the head, “very\nstrange things have been known to happen; the brain sometimes\npartially recovers, and death is delayed. Or the congested matter may\npass out of the brain altogether through channels which can only be\ndetermined by a post-mortem examination. There is an old man at the\nHospital for Incurables, an imbecile patient, in his case the effusion\nhas followed the direction of the spinal cord; he suffers horrid\nagonies, but he lives.”",
        "“Did they enjoy themselves?” It was Father Goriot who spoke. He had\nrecognized Eugene.",
        "“Oh! he thinks of nothing but his daughters,” said Bianchon. “Scores\nof times last night he said to me, ’They are dancing now! She has her\ndress.’ He called them by their names. He made me cry, the devil take\nit, calling with that tone in his voice, for ’Delphine! my little\nDelphine! and Nasie!’ Upon my word,” said the medical student, “it was\nenough to make any one burst out crying.”",
        "“Delphine,” said the old man, “she is there, isn’t she? I knew she was\nthere,” and his eyes sought the door.",
        "“I am going down now to tell Sylvie to get the poultices ready,” said\nBianchon. “They ought to go on at once.”",
        "Rastignac was left alone with the old man. He sat at the foot of the\nbed, and gazed at the face before him, so horribly changed that it was\nshocking to see.",
        "“Noble natures cannot dwell in this world,” he said; “Mme de Beauseant\nhas fled from it, and there he lies dying. What place indeed is there\nin the shallow petty frivolous thing called society for noble thoughts\nand feelings?”",
        "Pictures of yesterday’s ball rose up in his memory, in strange\ncontrast to the deathbed before him. Bianchon suddenly appeared.",
        "“I say, Eugene, I have just seen our head surgeon at the hospital, and\nI ran all the way back here. If the old man shows any signs of reason,\nif he begins to talk, cover him with a mustard poultice from the neck\nto the base of the spine, and send round for us.”",
        "“Dear Bianchon,” exclaimed Eugene.",
        "“Oh! it is an interesting case from a scientific point of view,” said\nthe medical student, with all the enthusiasm of a neophyte.",
        "“So!” said Eugene. “Am I really the only one who cares for the poor\nold man for his own sake?”",
        "“You would not have said so if you had seen me this morning,” returned\nBianchon, who did not take offence at this speech. “Doctors who have\nseen a good deal of practice never see anything but the disease, but,\nmy dear fellow, I can see the patient still.”",
        "He went. Eugene was left alone with the old man, and with an\napprehension of a crisis that set in, in fact, before very long.",
        "“Ah! dear boy, is that you?” said Father Goriot, recognizing Eugene.",
        "“Do you feel better?” asked the law student, taking his hand.",
        "“Yes. My head felt as if it were being screwed up in a vise, but now\nit is set free again. Did you see my girls? They will be here\ndirectly; as soon as they know that I am ill they will hurry here at\nonce; they used to take such care of me in the Rue de la Jussienne!\nGreat Heavens! if only my room was fit for them to come into! There\nhas been a young man here, who has burned up all my bark fuel.”",
        "“I can hear Christophe coming upstairs,” Eugene answered. “He is\nbringing up some firewood that that young man has sent you.”",
        "“Good, but how am I to pay for the wood. I have not a penny left, dear\nboy. I have given everything, everything. I am a pauper now. Well, at\nleast the golden gown was grand, was it not? (Ah! what pain this is!)\nThanks, Christophe! God will reward you, my boy; I have nothing left\nnow.”",
        "Eugene went over to Christophe and whispered in the man’s ear, “I will\npay you well, and Sylvie too, for your trouble.”",
        "“My daughters told you that they were coming, didn’t they, Christophe?\nGo again to them, and I will give you five francs. Tell them that I am\nnot feeling well, that I should like to kiss them both and see them\nonce again before I die. Tell them that, but don’t alarm them more\nthan you can help.”",
        "Rastignac signed to Christophe to go, and the man went.",
        "“They will come before long,” the old man went on. “I know them so\nwell. My tender-hearted Delphine! If I am going to die, she will feel\nit so much! And so will Nasie. I do not want to die; they will cry if\nI die; and if I die, dear Eugene, I shall not see them any more. It\nwill be very dreary there where I am going. For a father it is hell to\nbe without your children; I have served my apprenticeship already\nsince they married. My heaven was in the Rue de la Jussienne. Eugene,\ndo you think that if I go to heaven I can come back to earth, and be\nnear them in spirit? I have heard some such things said. It is true?\nIt is as if I could see them at this moment as they used to be when we\nall lived in the Rue de la Jussienne. They used to come downstairs of\na morning. ’Good-morning, papa!’ they used to say, and I would take\nthem on my knees; we had all sorts of little games of play together,\nand they had such pretty coaxing ways. We always had breakfast\ntogether, too, every morning, and they had dinner with me–in fact, I\nwas a father then. I enjoyed my children. They did not think for\nthemselves so long as they lived in the Rue de la Jussienne; they knew\nnothing of the world; they loved me with all their hearts. Mon Dieu!why could they not always be little girls? (Oh! my head! this racking\npain in my head!) Ah! ah! forgive me, children, this pain is fearful;\nit must be agony indeed, for you have used me to endure pain. Mon\nDieu! if only I held their hands in mine, I should not feel it at\nall.–Do you think that they are on the way? Christophe is so stupid;\nI ought to have gone myself. He will see them. But you went to the\nball yesterday; just tell me how they looked. They did not know that I\nwas ill, did they, or they would not have been dancing, poor little\nthings? Oh! I must not be ill any longer. They stand too much in need\nof me; their fortunes are in danger. And such husbands as they are\nbound to! I must get well! (Oh! what pain this is! what pain this is!\n. . . ah! ah!)–I must get well, you see; for they must have money,\nand I know how to set about making some. I will go to Odessa and\nmanufacture starch there. I am an old hand, I will make millions. (Oh!\nthis is agony!)”",
        "Goriot was silent for a moment; it seemed to require his whole\nstrength to endure the pain.",
        "“If they were here, I should not complain,” he said. “So why should I\ncomplain now?”",
        "He seemed to grow drowsy with exhaustion, and lay quietly for a long\ntime. Christophe came back; and Rastignac, thinking that Goriot was\nasleep, allowed the man to give his story aloud.",
        "“First of all, sir, I went to Madame la Comtesse,” he said; “but she\nand her husband were so busy that I couldn’t get to speak to her. When\nI insisted that I must see her, M. de Restaud came out to me himself,\nand went on like this: ’M. Goriot is dying, is he? Very well, it is\nthe best thing he can do. I want Mme. de Restaud to transact some\nimportant business, when it is all finished she can go.’ The gentleman\nlooked angry, I thought. I was just going away when Mme. de Restaud\ncame out into an ante-chamber through a door that I did not notice,\nand said, ’Christophe, tell my father that my husband wants me to\ndiscuss some matters with him, and I cannot leave the house, the life\nor death of my children is at stake; but as soon as it is over, I will\ncome.’ As for Madame la Baronne, that is another story! I could not\nspeak to her either, and I did not even see her. Her waiting-woman\nsaid, ’Ah yes, but madame only came back from a ball at a quarter to\nfive this morning; she is asleep now, and if I wake her before mid-day\nshe will be cross. As soon as she rings, I will go and tell her that\nher father is worse. It will be time enough then to tell her bad\nnews!’ I begged and I prayed, but, there! it was no good. Then I asked\nfor M. le Baron, but he was out.”",
        "“To think that neither of his daughters should come!” exclaimed\nRastignac. “I will write to them both.”",
        "“Neither of them!” cried the old man, sitting upright in bed. “They\nare busy, they are asleep, they will not come! I knew that they would\nnot. Not until you are dying do you know your children. . . . Oh! my\nfriend, do not marry; do not have children! You give them life; they\ngive you your deathblow. You bring them into the world, and they send\nyou out of it. No, they will not come. I have known that these ten\nyears. Sometimes I have told myself so, but I did not dare to believe\nit.”",
        "The tears gathered and stood without overflowing the red sockets.",
        "“Ah! if I were rich still, if I had kept my money, if I had not given\nall to them, they would be with me now; they would fawn on me and\ncover my cheeks with their kisses! I should be living in a great\nmansion; I should have grand apartments and servants and a fire in my\nroom; and they would be about me all in tears, and their husbands\nand their children. I should have had all that; now–I have nothing.\nMoney brings everything to you; even your daughters. My money. Oh!\nwhere is my money? If I had plenty of money to leave behind me, they\nwould nurse me and tend me; I should hear their voices, I should see\ntheir faces. Ah, God! who knows? They both of them have hearts of\nstone. I loved them too much; it was not likely that they should love\nme. A father ought always to be rich; he ought to keep his children\nwell in hand, like unruly horses. I have gone down on my knees to\nthem. Wretches! this is the crowning act that brings the last ten\nyears to a proper close. If you but knew how much they made of me just\nafter they were married. (Oh! this is cruel torture!) I had just given\nthem each eight hundred thousand francs; they were bound to be civil\nto me after that, and their husbands too were civil. I used to go to\ntheir houses: it was ’My kind father’ here, ’My dear father’ there.\nThere was always a place for me at their tables. I used to dine with\ntheir husbands now and then, and they were very respectful to me. I\nwas still worth something, they thought. How should they know? I had\nnot said anything about my affairs. It is worth while to be civil to a\nman who has given his daughters eight hundred thousand francs apiece;\nand they showed me every attention then–but it was all for my money.\nGrand people are not great. I found that out by experience! I went to\nthe theatre with them in their carriage; I might stay as long as I\ncared to stay at their evening parties. In fact, they acknowledged me\ntheir father; publicly they owned that they were my daughters. But I\nwas always a shrewd one, you see, and nothing was lost upon me.\nEverything went straight to the mark and pierced my heart. I saw quite\nwell that it was all sham and pretence, but there is no help for such\nthings as these. I felt less at my ease at their dinner-table than I\ndid downstairs here. I had nothing to say for myself. So these grand\nfolks would ask in my son-in-law’s ear, ’Who may that gentleman be?’\n–’The father-in-law with the money bags; he is very rich.’–’The\ndevil, he is!’ they would say, and look again at me with the respect\ndue to my money. Well, if I was in the way sometimes, I paid dearly\nfor my mistakes. And besides, who is perfect? (My head is one sore!)\nDear Monsieur Eugene, I am suffering so now, that a man might die of\nthe pain; but it is nothing to be compared with the pain I endured when\nAnastasie made me feel, for the first time, that I had said something\nstupid. She looked at me, and that glance of hers opened all my veins.\nI used to want to know everything, to be learned; and one thing I did\nlearn thoroughly–I knew that I was not wanted here on earth.",
        "“The next day I went to Delphine for comfort, and what should I do\nthere but make some stupid blunder that made her angry with me. I was\nlike one driven out of his senses. For a week I did not know what to\ndo; I did not dare to go to see them for fear they should reproach me.\nAnd that was how they both turned me out of the house.",
        "“Oh God! Thou knowest all the misery and anguish that I have endured;\nThou hast counted all the wounds that have been dealt to me in these\nyears that have aged and changed me and whitened my hair and drained\nmy life; why dost Thou make me to suffer so to-day? Have I not more\nthan expiated the sin of loving them too much? They themselves have\nbeen the instruments of vengeance; they have tortured me for my sin of\naffection.",
        "“Ah, well! fathers know no better; I loved them so; I went back to\nthem as a gambler goes to the gaming table. This love was my vice, you\nsee, my mistress–they were everything in the world to me. They were\nalways wanting something or other, dresses and ornaments, and what\nnot; their maids used to tell me what they wanted, and I used to give\nthem the things for the sake of the welcome that they bought for me.\nBut, at the same time, they used to give me little lectures on my\nbehavior in society; they began about it at once. Then they began to\nfeel ashamed of me. That is what comes of having your children well\nbrought up. I could not go to school again at my time of life. (This\npain is fearful! Mon Dieu! These doctors! these doctors! If they\nwould open my head, it would give me some relief!) Oh, my daughters,\nmy daughters! Anastasie! Delphine! If I could only see them! Send for\nthe police, and make them come to me! Justice is on my side, the whole\nworld is on my side, I have natural rights, and the law with me. I\nprotest! The country will go to ruin if a father’s rights are trampled\nunder foot. That is easy to see. The whole world turns on fatherly\nlove; fatherly love is the foundation of society; it will crumble into\nruin when children do not love their fathers. Oh! if I could only see\nthem, and hear them, no matter what they said; if I could simply hear\ntheir voices, it would soothe the pain. Delphine! Delphine most of\nall. But tell them when they come not to look so coldly at me as they\ndo. Oh! my friend, my good Monsieur Eugene, you do not know that it is\nwhen all the golden light in a glance suddenly turns to a leaden gray.\nIt has been one long winter here since the light in their eyes shone\nno more for me. I have had nothing but disappointments to devour.\nDisappointment has been my daily bread; I have lived on humiliation\nand insults. I have swallowed down all the affronts for which they\nsold me my poor stealthy little moments of joy; for I love them so!\nThink of it! a father hiding himself to get a glimpse of his children!\nI have given all my life to them, and to-day they will not give me one\nhour! I am hungering and thirsting for them, my heart is burning in\nme, but they will not come to bring relief in the agony, for I am\ndying now, I feel that this is death. Do they not know what it means\nto trample on a father’s corpse? There is a God in heaven who avenges\nus fathers whether we will or no.",
        "“Oh! they will come! Come to me, darlings, and give me one more kiss;\none last kiss, the Viaticum for your father, who will pray God for you\nin heaven. I will tell Him that you have been good children to your\nfather, and plead your cause with God! After all, it is not their\nfault. I tell you they are innocent, my friend. Tell every one that it\nis not their fault, and no one need be distressed on my account. It is\nall my own fault, I taught them to trample upon me. I loved to have it\nso. It is no one’s affair but mine; man’s justice and God’s justice\nhave nothing to do in it. God would be unjust if He condemned them for\nanything they may have done to me. I did not behave to them properly;\nI was stupid enough to resign my rights. I would have humbled myself\nin the dust for them. What could you expect? The most beautiful\nnature, the noblest soul, would have been spoiled by such indulgence.\nI am a wretch, I am justly punished. I, and I only, am to blame for\nall their sins; I spoiled them. To-day they are as eager for pleasure\nas they used to be for sugar-plums. When they were little girls I\nindulged them in every whim. They had a carriage of their own when\nthey were fifteen. They have never been crossed. I am guilty, and not\nthey–but I sinned through love.",
        "“My heart would open at the sound of their voices. I can hear them;\nthey are coming. Yes! yes! they are coming. The law demands that they\nshould be present at their father’s deathbed; the law is on my side.\nIt would only cost them the hire of a cab. I would pay that. Write to\nthem, tell them that I have millions to leave to them! On my word of\nhonor, yes. I am going to manufacture Italian paste foods at Odessa. I\nunderstand the trade. There are millions to be made in it. Nobody has\nthought of the scheme as yet. You see, there will be no waste, no\ndamage in transit, as there always is with wheat and flour. Hey! hey!\nand starch too; there are millions to be made in the starch trade! You\nwill not be telling a lie. Millions, tell them; and even if they\nreally come because they covet the money, I would rather let them\ndeceive me; and I shall see them in any case. I want my children! I\ngave them life; they are mine, mine!” and he sat upright. The head\nthus raised, with its scanty white hair, seemed to Eugene like a\nthreat; every line that could still speak spoke of menace.",
        "“There, there, dear father,” said Eugene, “lie down again; I will\nwrite to them at once. As soon as Bianchon comes back I will go for\nthem myself, if they do not come before.”",
        "“If they do not come?” repeated the old man, sobbing. “Why, I shall be\ndead before then; I shall die in a fit of rage, of rage! Anger is\ngetting the better of me. I can see my whole life at this minute. I\nhave been cheated! They do not love me–they have never loved me all\ntheir lives! It is all clear to me. They have not come, and they will\nnot come. The longer they put off their coming, the less they are\nlikely to give me this joy. I know them. They have never cared to\nguess my disappointments, my sorrows, my wants; they never cared to\nknow my life; they will have no presentiment of my death; they do not\neven know the secret of my tenderness for them. Yes, I see it all now.\nI have laid my heart open so often, that they take everything I do for\nthem as a matter of course. They might have asked me for the very eyes\nout of my head and I would have bidden them to pluck them out. They\nthink that all fathers are like theirs. You should always make your\nvalue felt. Their own children will avenge me. Why, for their own\nsakes they should come to me! Make them understand that they are\nlaying up retribution for their own deathbeds. All crimes are summed\nup in this one. . . . Go to them; just tell them that if they stay\naway it will be parricide! There is enough laid to their charge\nalready without adding that to the list. Cry aloud as I do now,\n’Nasie! Delphine! here! Come to your father; the father who has been\nso kind to you is lying ill!’–Not a sound; no one comes! Then am I do\ndie like a dog? This is to be my reward–I am forsaken at the last.\nThey are wicked, heartless women; curses on them, I loathe them. I\nshall rise at night from my grave to curse them again; for, after all,\nmy friends, have I done wrong? They are behaving very badly to me, eh?\n. . . What am I saying? Did you not tell me just now that Delphine is\nin the room? She is more tender-hearted than her sister. . . . Eugene,\nyou are my son, you know. You will love her; be a father to her! Her\nsister is very unhappy. And there are their fortunes! Ah, God! I am\ndying, this anguish is almost more than I can bear! Cut off my head;\nleave me nothing but my heart.”",
        "“Christophe!” shouted Eugene, alarmed by the way in which the old man\nmoaned, and by his cries, “go for M. Bianchon, and send a cab here for\nme.–I am going to fetch them, dear father; I will bring them back to\nyou.”",
        "“Make them come! Compel them to come! Call out the Guard, the\nmilitary, anything and everything, but make them come!” He looked at\nEugene, and a last gleam of intelligence shone in his eyes. “Go to the\nauthorities, to the Public Prosecutor, let them bring them here; come\nthey shall!”",
        "“But you have cursed them.”",
        "“Who said that!” said the old man in dull amazement. “You know quite\nwell that I love them, I adore them! I shall be quite well again if I\ncan see them. . . . Go for them, my good neighbor, my dear boy, you\nare kind-hearted; I wish I could repay you for your kindness, but I\nhave nothing to give you now, save the blessing of a dying man. Ah! if\nI could only see Delphine, to tell her to pay my debt to you. If the\nother cannot come, bring Delphine to me at any rate. Tell her that\nunless she comes, you will not love her any more. She is so fond of\nyou that she will come to me then. Give me something to drink! There\nis a fire in my bowels. Press something against my forehead! If my\ndaughters would lay their hands there, I think I should get better.\n. . . Mon Dieu! who will recover their money for them when I am\ngone? . . . I will manufacture vermicelli out in Odessa; I will go to\nOdessa for their sakes.”",
        "“Here is something to drink,” said Eugene, supporting the dying man on\nhis left arm, while he held a cup of tisane to Goriot’s lips.",
        "“How you must love your own father and mother!” said the old man, and\ngrasped the student’s hand in both of his. It was a feeble, trembling\ngrasp. “I am going to die; I shall die without seeing my daughters; do\nyou understand? To be always thirsting, and never to drink; that has\nbeen my life for the last ten years. . . . I have no daughters, my\nsons-in-law killed them. No, since their marriages they have been dead\nto me. Fathers should petition the Chambers to pass a law against\nmarriage. If you love your daughters, do not let them marry. A\nson-in-law is a rascal who poisons a girl’s mind and contaminates her\nwhole nature. Let us have no more marriages! It robs us of our\ndaughters; we are left alone upon our deathbeds, and they are not with\nus then. They ought to pass a law for dying fathers. This is awful!\nIt cries for vengeance! They cannot come, because my sons-in-law\nforbid them! . . . Kill them! . . . Restaud and the Alsatian, kill\nthem both! They have murdered me between them! . . . Death or my\ndaughters! . . . Ah! it is too late, I am dying, and they are not\nhere! . . . Dying without them! . . . Nasie! Fifine! Why do you not\ncome to me? Your papa is going––”",
        "“Dear Father Goriot, calm yourself. There, there, lie quietly and\nrest; don’t worry yourself, don’t think.”",
        "“I shall not see them. Oh! the agony of it!”",
        "“You shall see them.”",
        "“Really?” cried the old man, still wandering. “Oh! shall I see them; I\nshall see them and hear their voices. I shall die happy. Ah! well,\nafter all, I do not wish to live; I cannot stand this much longer;\nthis pain that grows worse and worse. But, oh! to see them, to touch\ntheir dresses–ah! nothing but their dresses, that is very little;\nstill, to feel something that belongs to them. Let me touch their hair\nwith my fingers . . . their hair . . .”",
        "His head fell back on the pillow, as if a sudden heavy blow had struck\nhim down, but his hands groped feebly over the quilt, as if to find\nhis daughters’ hair.",
        "“My blessing on them . . .” he said, making an effort, “my\nblessing . . .”",
        "His voice died away. Just at that moment Bianchon came into the room.",
        "“I met Christophe,” he said; “he is gone for your cab.”",
        "Then he looked at the patient, and raised the closed eyelids with his\nfingers. The two students saw how dead and lustreless the eyes beneath\nhad grown.",
        "“He will not get over this, I am sure,” said Bianchon. He felt the old\nman’s pulse, and laid a hand over his heart.",
        "“The machinery works still; more is the pity, in his state it would be\nbetter for him to die.”",
        "“Ah! my word, it would!”",
        "“What is the matter with you? You are as pale as death.”",
        "“Dear fellow, the moans and cries that I have just heard. . . . There\nis a God! Ah! yes, yes, there is a God, and He has made a better world\nfor us, or this world of ours would be a nightmare. I could have cried\nlike a child; but this is too tragical, and I am sick at heart.",
        "“We want a lot of things, you know; and where is the money to come\nfrom?”",
        "Rastignac took out his watch.",
        "“There, be quick and pawn it. I do not want to stop on the way to the\nRue du Helder; there is not a moment to lose, I am afraid, and I must\nwait here till Christophe comes back. I have not a farthing; I shall\nhave to pay the cabman when I get home again.”",
        "Rastignac rushed down the stairs, and drove off to the Rue du Helder.\nThe awful scene through which he had just passed quickened his\nimagination, and he grew fiercely indignant. He reached Mme. de\nRestaud’s house only to be told by the servant that his mistress could\nsee no one.",
        "“But I have brought a message from her father, who is dying,\"\nRastignac told the man.",
        "“The Count has given us the strictest orders, sir––”",
        "“If it is M. de Restaud who has given the orders, tell him that his\nfather-in-law is dying, and that I am here, and must speak with him at\nonce.”",
        "The man went out.",
        "Eugene waited for a long while. “Perhaps her father is dying at this\nmoment,” he thought.",
        "Then the man came back, and Eugene followed him to the little\ndrawing-room. M. de Restaud was standing before the fireless grate,\nand did not ask his visitor to seat himself.",
        "“Monsieur le Comte,” said Rastignac, “M. Goriot, your father-in-law,\nis lying at the point of death in a squalid den in the Latin Quarter.\nHe has not a penny to pay for firewood; he is expected to die at any\nmoment, and keeps calling for his daughter––”",
        "“I feel very little affection for M. Goriot, sir, as you probably are\naware,” the Count answered coolly. “His character has been compromised\nin connection with Mme. de Restaud; he is the author of the\nmisfortunes that have embittered my life and troubled my peace of\nmind. It is a matter of perfect indifference to me if he lives or\ndies. Now you know my feelings with regard to him. Public opinion may\nblame me, but I care nothing for public opinion. Just now I have other\nand much more important matters to think about than the things that\nfools and chatterers may say about me. As for Mme. de Restaud, she\ncannot leave the house; she is in no condition to do so. And, besides,\nI shall not allow her to leave it. Tell her father that as soon as she\nhas done her duty by her husband and child she shall go to see him. If\nshe has any love for her father, she can be free to go to him, if she\nchooses, in a few seconds; it lies entirely with her––”",
        "“Monsieur le Comte, it is no business of mine to criticise your\nconduct; you can do as you please with your wife, but may I count upon\nyour keeping your word with me? Well, then, promise me to tell her\nthat her father has not twenty-four hours to live; that he looks in\nvain for her, and has cursed her already as he lies on his deathbed,\n–that is all I ask.”",
        "“You can tell her yourself,” the Count answered, impressed by the\nthrill of indignation in Eugene’s voice.",
        "The Count led the way to the room where his wife usually sat. She was\ndrowned in tears, and lay crouching in the depths of an armchair, as\nif she were tired of life and longed to die. It was piteous to see\nher. Before venturing to look at Rastignac, she glanced at her husband\nin evident and abject terror that spoke of complete prostration of\nbody and mind; she seemed crushed by a tyranny both mental and\nphysical. The Count jerked his head towards her; she construed this as\na permission to speak.",
        "“I heard all that you said, monsieur. Tell my father that if he knew\nall he would forgive me. . . . I did not think there was such torture\nin the world as this; it is more than I can endure, monsieur!–But I\nwill not give way as long as I live,” she said, turning to her\nhusband. “I am a mother.–Tell my father that I have never sinned\nagainst him in spite of appearances!” she cried aloud in her despair.",
        "Eugene bowed to the husband and wife; he guessed the meaning of the\nscene, and that this was a terrible crisis in the Countess’ life. M.\nde Restaud’s manner had told him that his errand was a fruitless one;\nhe saw that Anastasie had no longer any liberty of action. He came\naway mazed and bewildered, and hurried to Mme. de Nucingen. Delphine\nwas in bed.",
        "“Poor dear Eugene, I am ill,” she said. “I caught cold after the ball,\nand I am afraid of pneumonia. I am waiting for the doctor to come.”",
        "“If you were at death’s door,” Eugene broke in, “you must be carried\nsomehow to your father. He is calling for you. If you could hear the\nfaintest of those cries, you would not feel ill any longer.”",
        "“Eugene, I dare say my father is not quite so ill as you say; but I\ncannot bear to do anything that you do not approve, so I will do just\nas you wish. As for him, he would die of grief I know if I went out to\nsee him and brought on a dangerous illness. Well, I will go as soon as\nI have seen the doctor.–Ah!” she cried out, “you are not wearing your\nwatch, how is that?”",
        "Eugene reddened.",
        "“Eugene, Eugene! if you have sold it already or lost it. . . . Oh! it\nwould be very wrong of you!”",
        "The student bent over Delphine and said in her ear, “Do you want to\nknow? Very well, then, you shall know. Your father has nothing left to\npay for the shroud that they will lay him in this evening. Your watch\nhas been pawned, for I had nothing either.”",
        "Delphine sprang out of bed, ran to her desk, and took out her purse.\nShe gave it to Eugene, and rang the bell, crying:",
        "“I will go, I will go at once, Eugene. Leave me, I will dress. Why, I\nshould be an unnatural daughter! Go back; I will be there before you.\n–Therese,” she called to the waiting-woman, “ask M. de Nucingen to\ncome upstairs at once and speak to me.”",
        "Eugene was almost happy when he reached the Rue\nNueve-Sainte-Genevieve; he was so glad to bring the news to the dying\nman that one of his daughters was coming. He fumbled in Delphine’s\npurse for money, so as to dismiss the cab at once; and discovered that\nthe young, beautiful, and wealthy woman of fashion had only seventy\nfrancs in her private purse. He climbed the stairs and found Bianchon\nsupporting Goriot, while the house surgeon from the hospital was\napplying moxas to the patient’s back–under the direction of the\nphysician, it was the last expedient of science, and it was tried in\nvain.",
        "“Can you feel them?” asked the physician. But Goriot had caught sight\nof Rastignac, and answered, “They are coming, are they not?”",
        "“There is hope yet,” said the surgeon; “he can speak.”",
        "“Yes,” said Eugene, “Delphine is coming.”",
        "“Oh! that is nothing!” said Bianchon; “he has been talking about his\ndaughters all the time. He calls for them as a man impaled calls for\nwater, they say––”",
        "“We may as well give up,” said the physician, addressing the surgeon.\n\"Nothing more can be done now; the case is hopeless.”",
        "Bianchon and the house surgeon stretched the dying man out again on\nhis loathsome bed.",
        "“But the sheets ought to be changed,” added the physician. “Even if\nthere is no hope left, something is due to human nature. I shall come\nback again, Bianchon,” he said, turning to the medical student. “If he\ncomplains again, rub some laudanum over the diaphragm.”",
        "He went, and the house surgeon went with him.",
        "“Come, Eugene, pluck up heart, my boy,” said Bianchon, as soon as they\nwere alone; “we must set about changing his sheets, and put him into a\nclean shirt. Go and tell Sylvie to bring some sheets and come and help\nus to make the bed.”",
        "Eugene went downstairs, and found Mme. Vauquer engaged in setting the\ntable; Sylvie was helping her. Eugene had scarcely opened his mouth\nbefore the widow walked up to him with the acidulous sweet smile of a\ncautious shopkeeper who is anxious neither to lose money nor to offend\na customer.",
        "“My dear Monsieur Eugene,” she said, when he had spoken, “you know\nquite as well as I do that Father Goriot has not a brass farthing\nleft. If you give out clean linen for a man who is just going to turn\nup his eyes, you are not likely to see your sheets again, for one is\nsure to be wanted to wrap him in. Now, you owe me a hundred and\nforty-four francs as it is, add forty francs for the pair of sheets,\nand then there are several little things, besides the candle that\nSylvie will give you; altogether it will all mount up to at least two\nhundred francs, which is more than a poor widow like me can afford to\nlose. Lord! now, Monsieur Eugene, look at it fairly. I have lost quite\nenough in these five days since this run of ill-luck set in for me. I\nwould rather than ten crowns that the old gentlemen had moved out as\nyou said. It sets the other lodgers against the house. It would not\ntake much to make me send him to the workhouse. In short, just put\nyourself in my place. I have to think of my establishment first, for I\nhave my own living to make.”",
        "Eugene hurried up to Goriot’s room.",
        "“Bianchon,” he cried, “the money for the watch?”",
        "“There it is on the table, or the three hundred and sixty odd francs\nthat are left of it. I paid up all the old scores out of it before\nthey let me have the things. The pawn ticket lies there under the\nmoney.”",
        "Rastignac hurried downstairs.",
        "“Here, madame” he said in disgust, “let us square accounts. M. Goriot\nwill not stay much longer in your house, nor shall I––”",
        "“Yes, he will go out feet foremost, poor old gentleman,” she said,\ncounting the francs with a half-facetious, half-lugubrious expression.",
        "“Let us get this over,” said Rastignac.",
        "“Sylvie, look out some sheets, and go upstairs to help the gentlemen.”",
        "“You won’t forget Sylvie,” said Mme. Vauquer in Eugene’s ear; “she has\nbeen sitting up these two nights.”",
        "As soon as Eugene’s back was turned, the old woman hurried after her\nhandmaid.",
        "“Take the sheets that have had the sides turned into the middle,\nnumber 7. Lord! they are plenty good enough for a corpse,” she said in\nSylvie’s ear.",
        "Eugene, by this time, was part of the way upstairs, and did not\noverhear the elderly economist.",
        "“Quick,” said Bianchon, “let us change his shirt. Hold him upright.”",
        "Eugene went to the head of the bed and supported the dying man, while\nBianchon drew off his shirt; and then Goriot made a movement as if he\ntried to clutch something to his breast, uttering a low inarticulate\nmoaning the while, like some dumb animal in mortal pain.",
        "“Ah! yes!” cried Bianchon. “It is the little locket and the chain made\nof hair that he wants; we took it off a while ago when we put the\nblisters on him. Poor fellow! he must have it again. There it lies on\nthe chimney-piece.”",
        "Eugene went to the chimney-piece and found the little plait of faded\ngolden hair–Mme. Goriot’s hair, no doubt. He read the name on the\nlittle round locket, ANASTASIE on the one side, DELPHINE on the other.\nIt was the symbol of his own heart that the father always wore on his\nbreast. The curls of hair inside the locket were so fine and soft that\nis was plain they had been taken from two childish heads. When the old\nman felt the locket once more, his chest heaved with a long deep sigh\nof satisfaction, like a groan. It was something terrible to see, for\nit seemed as if the last quiver of the nerves were laid bare to their\neyes, the last communication of sense to the mysterious point within\nwhence our sympathies come and whither they go. A delirious joy\nlighted up the distorted face. The terrific and vivid force of the\nfeeling that had survived the power of thought made such an impression\non the students, that the dying man felt their hot tears falling on\nhim, and gave a shrill cry of delight.",
        "“Nasie! Fifine!”",
        "“There is life in him yet,” said Bianchon.",
        "“What does he go on living for?” said Sylvie.",
        "“To suffer,” answered Rastignac.",
        "Bianchon made a sign to his friend to follow his example, knelt down\nand pressed his arms under the sick man, and Rastignac on the other\nside did the same, so that Sylvie, standing in readiness, might draw\nthe sheet from beneath and replace it with the one that she had\nbrought. Those tears, no doubt, had misled Goriot; for he gathered up\nall his remaining strength in a last effort, stretched out his hands,\ngroped for the students’ heads, and as his fingers caught convulsively\nat their hair, they heard a faint whisper:",
        "“Ah! my angels!”",
        "Two words, two inarticulate murmurs, shaped into words by the soul\nwhich fled forth with them as they left his lips.",
        "“Poor dear!” cried Sylvie, melted by that exclamation; the expression\nof the great love raised for the last time to a sublime height by that\nmost ghastly and involuntary of lies.",
        "The father’s last breath must have been a sigh of joy, and in that\nsigh his whole life was summed up; he was cheated even at the last.\nThey laid Father Goriot upon his wretched bed with reverent hands.\nThenceforward there was no expression on his face, only the painful\ntraces of the struggle between life and death that was going on in the\nmachine; for that kind of cerebral consciousness that distinguishes\nbetween pleasure and pain in a human being was extinguished; it was\nonly a question of time–and the mechanism itself would be destroyed.",
        "“He will lie like this for several hours, and die so quietly at last,\nthat we shall not know when he goes; there will be no rattle in the\nthroat. The brain must be completely suffused.”",
        "As he spoke there was a footstep on the staircase, and a young woman\nhastened up, panting for breath.",
        "“She has come too late,” said Rastignac.",
        "But it was not Delphine; it was Therese, her waiting-woman, who stood\nin the doorway.",
        "“Monsieur Eugene,” she said, “monsieur and madame have had a terrible\nscene about some money that Madame (poor thing!) wanted for her\nfather. She fainted, and the doctor came, and she had to be bled,\ncalling out all the while, ’My father is dying; I want to see papa!’\nIt was heartbreaking to hear her––”",
        "“That will do, Therese. If she came now, it would be trouble thrown\naway. M. Goriot cannot recognize any one now.”",
        "“Poor, dear gentleman, is he as bad at that?” said Therese.",
        "“You don’t want me now, I must go and look after my dinner; it is\nhalf-past four,” remarked Sylvie. The next instant she all but\ncollided with Mme. de Restaud on the landing outside.",
        "There was something awful and appalling in the sudden apparition of\nthe Countess. She saw the bed of death by the dim light of the single\ncandle, and her tears flowed at the sight of her father’s passive\nfeatures, from which the life had almost ebbed. Bianchon with\nthoughtful tact left the room.",
        "“I could not escape soon enough,” she said to Rastignac.",
        "The student bowed sadly in reply. Mme. de Restaud took her father’s\nhand and kissed it.",
        "“Forgive me, father! You used to say that my voice would call you back\nfrom the grave; ah! come back for one moment to bless your penitent\ndaughter. Do you hear me? Oh! this is fearful! No one on earth will\never bless me henceforth; every one hates me; no one loves me but you\nin all the world. My own children will hate me. Take me with you,\nfather; I will love you, I will take care of you. He does not hear me\n. . . I am mad . . .”",
        "She fell on her knees, and gazed wildly at the human wreck before her.",
        "“My cup of misery is full,” she said, turning her eyes upon Eugene.\n\"M. de Trailles has fled, leaving enormous debts behind him, and I\nhave found out that he was deceiving me. My husband will never forgive\nme, and I have left my fortune in his hands. I have lost all my\nillusions. Alas! I have forsaken the one heart that loved me (she\npointed to her father as she spoke), and for whom? I have held his\nkindness cheap, and slighted his affection; many and many a time I\nhave given him pain, ungrateful wretch that I am!”",
        "“He knew it,” said Rastignac.",
        "Just then Goriot’s eyelids unclosed; it was only a muscular\ncontraction, but the Countess’ sudden start of reviving hope was no\nless dreadful than the dying eyes.",
        "“Is it possible that he can hear me?” cried the Countess. “No,” she\nanswered herself, and sat down beside the bed. As Mme. de Restaud\nseemed to wish to sit by her father, Eugene went down to take a little\nfood. The boarders were already assembled.",
        "“Well,” remarked the painter, as he joined them, “it seems that there\nis to be a death-orama upstairs.”",
        "“Charles, I think you might find something less painful to joke\nabout,” said Eugene.",
        "“So we may not laugh here?” returned the painter. “What harm does it\ndo? Bianchon said that the old man was quite insensible.”",
        "“Well, then,” said the employe from the Museum, “he will die as he\nhas lived.”",
        "“My father is dead!” shrieked the Countess.",
        "The terrible cry brought Sylvie, Rastignac, and Bianchon; Mme. de\nRestaud had fainted away. When she recovered they carried her\ndownstairs, and put her into the cab that stood waiting at the door.\nEugene sent Therese with her, and bade the maid take the Countess to\nMme. de Nucingen.",
        "Bianchon came down to them.",
        "“Yes, he is dead,” he said.",
        "“Come, sit down to dinner, gentlemen,” said Mme. Vauquer, “or the soup\nwill be cold.”",
        "The two students sat down together.",
        "“What is the next thing to be done?” Eugene asked of Bianchon.",
        "“I have closed his eyes and composed his limbs,” said Bianchon. “When\nthe certificate has been officially registered at the Mayor’s office,\nwe will sew him in his winding sheet and bury him somewhere. What do\nyou think we ought to do?”",
        "“He will not smell at his bread like this any more,” said the painter,\nmimicking the old man’s little trick.",
        "“Oh, hang it all!” cried the tutor, “let Father Goriot drop, and let\nus have something else for a change. He is a standing dish, and we\nhave had him with every sauce this hour or more. It is one of the\nprivileges of the good city of Paris that anybody may be born, or\nlive, or die there without attracting any attention whatsoever. Let us\nprofit by the advantages of civilization. There are fifty or sixty\ndeaths every day; if you have a mind to do it, you can sit down at any\ntime and wail over whole hecatombs of dead in Paris. Father Goriot has\ngone off the hooks, has he? So much the better for him. If you\nvenerate his memory, keep it to yourselves, and let the rest of us\nfeed in peace.”",
        "“Oh, to be sure,” said the widow, “it is all the better for him that\nhe is dead. It looks as though he had had trouble enough, poor soul,\nwhile he was alive.”",
        "And this was all the funeral oration delivered over him who had been\nfor Eugene the type and embodiment of Fatherhood.",
        "The fifteen lodgers began to talk as usual. When Bianchon and Eugene\nhad satisfied their hunger, the rattle of spoons and forks, the\nboisterous conversation, the expressions on the faces that bespoke\nvarious degrees of want of feeling, gluttony, or indifference,\neverything about them made them shiver with loathing. They went out to\nfind a priest to watch that night with the dead. It was necessary to\nmeasure their last pious cares by the scanty sum of money that\nremained. Before nine o’clock that evening the body was laid out on\nthe bare sacking of the bedstead in the desolate room; a lighted\ncandle stood on either side, and the priest watched at the foot.\nRastignac made inquiries of this latter as to the expenses of the\nfuneral, and wrote to the Baron de Nucingen and the Comte de Restaud,\nentreating both gentlemen to authorize their man of business to defray\nthe charges of laying their father-in-law in the grave. He sent\nChristophe with the letters; then he went to bed, tired out, and\nslept.",
        "Next day Bianchon and Rastignac were obliged to take the certificate\nto the registrar themselves, and by twelve o’clock the formalities\nwere completed. Two hours went by, no word came from the Count nor\nfrom the Baron; nobody appeared to act for them, and Rastignac had\nalready been obliged to pay the priest. Sylvie asked ten francs for\nsewing the old man in his winding-sheet and making him ready for the\ngrave, and Eugene and Bianchon calculated that they had scarcely\nsufficient to pay for the funeral, if nothing was forthcoming from the\ndead man’s family. So it was the medical student who laid him in a\npauper’s coffin, despatched from Bianchon’s hospital, whence he\nobtained it at a cheaper rate.",
        "“Let us play those wretches a trick,” said he. “Go to the cemetery,\nbuy a grave for five years at Pere-Lachaise, and arrange with the\nChurch and the undertaker to have a third-class funeral. If the\ndaughters and their husbands decline to repay you, you can carve this\non the headstone–’Here lies M. Goriot, father of the Comtesse de\nRestaud and the Baronne de Nucingen, interred at the expense of two\nstudents.’”",
        "Eugene took part of his friend’s advice, but only after he had gone in\nperson first to M. and Mme. de Nucingen, and then to M. and Mme. de\nRestaud–a fruitless errand. He went no further than the doorstep in\neither house. The servants had received strict orders to admit no one.",
        "“Monsieur and Madame can see no visitors. They have just lost their\nfather, and are in deep grief over their loss.”",
        "Eugene’s Parisian experience told him that it was idle to press the\npoint. Something clutched strangely at his heart when he saw that it\nwas impossible to reach Delphine.",
        "“Sell some of your ornaments,” he wrote hastily in the porter’s room,\n\"so that your father may be decently laid in his last resting-place.”",
        "He sealed the note, and begged the porter to give it to Therese for\nher mistress; but the man took it to the Baron de Nucingen, who flung\nthe note into the fire. Eugene, having finished his errands, returned\nto the lodging-house about three o’clock. In spite of himself, the\ntears came into his eyes. The coffin, in its scanty covering of black\ncloth, was standing there on the pavement before the gate, on two\nchairs. A withered sprig of hyssop was soaking in the holy water bowl\nof silver-plated copper; there was not a soul in the street, not a\npasser-by had stopped to sprinkle the coffin; there was not even an\nattempt at a black drapery over the wicket. It was a pauper who lay\nthere; no one made a pretence of mourning for him; he had neither\nfriends nor kindred–there was no one to follow him to the grave.",
        "Bianchon’s duties compelled him to be at the hospital, but he had left\na few lines for Eugene, telling his friend about the arrangements he\nhad made for the burial service. The house student’s note told\nRastignac that a mass was beyond their means, that the ordinary office\nfor the dead was cheaper, and must suffice, and that he had sent word\nto the undertaker by Christophe. Eugene had scarcely finished reading\nBianchon’s scrawl, when he looked up and saw the little circular gold\nlocket that contained the hair of Goriot’s two daughters in Mme.\nVauquer’s hands.",
        "“How dared you take it?” he asked.",
        "“Good Lord! is that to be buried along with him?” retorted Sylvie. “It\nis gold.”",
        "“Of course it shall!” Eugene answered indignantly; “he shall at any\nrate take one thing that may represent his daughters into the grave\nwith him.”",
        "When the hearse came, Eugene had the coffin carried into the house\nagain, unscrewed the lid, and reverently laid on the old man’s breast\nthe token that recalled the days when Delphine and Anastasie were\ninnocent little maidens, before they began “to think for themselves,\"\nas he had moaned out in his agony.",
        "Rastignac and Christophe and the two undertaker’s men were the only\nfollowers of the funeral. The Church of Saint-Etienne du Mont was only\na little distance from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. When the coffin\nhad been deposited in a low, dark, little chapel, the law student\nlooked round in vain for Goriot’s two daughters or their husbands.\nChristophe was his only fellow-mourner; Christophe, who appeared to\nthink it was his duty to attend the funeral of the man who had put him\nin the way of such handsome tips. As they waited there in the chapel\nfor the two priests, the chorister, and the beadle, Rastignac grasped\nChristophe’s hand. He could not utter a word just then.",
        "“Yes, Monsieur Eugene,” said Christophe, “he was a good and worthy\nman, who never said one word louder than another; he never did any one\nany harm, and gave nobody any trouble.”",
        "The two priests, the chorister, and the beadle came, and said and did\nas much as could be expected for seventy francs in an age when\nreligion cannot afford to say prayers for nothing.",
        "The ecclesiatics chanted a psalm, the Libera nos and the De\nprofundis. The whole service lasted about twenty minutes. There was\nbut one mourning coach, which the priest and chorister agreed to share\nwith Eugene and Christophe.",
        "“There is no one else to follow us,” remarked the priest, “so we\nmay as well go quickly, and so save time; it is half-past five.”",
        "But just as the coffin was put in the hearse, two empty carriages,\nwith the armorial bearings of the Comte de Restaud and the Baron de\nNucingen, arrived and followed in the procession to Pere-Lachaise. At\nsix o’clock Goriot’s coffin was lowered into the grave, his daughters’\nservants standing round the while. The ecclesiastic recited the short\nprayer that the students could afford to pay for, and then both priest\nand lackeys disappeared at once. The two grave diggers flung in\nseveral spadefuls of earth, and then stopped and asked Rastignac for\ntheir fee. Eugene felt in vain in his pocket, and was obliged to\nborrow five francs of Christophe. This thing, so trifling in itself,\ngave Rastignac a terrible pang of distress. It was growing dusk, the\ndamp twilight fretted his nerves; he gazed down into the grave and the\ntears he shed were drawn from him by the sacred emotion, a\nsingle-hearted sorrow. When such tears fall on earth, their radiance\nreaches heaven. And with that tear that fell on Father Goriot’s grave,\nEugene Rastignac’s youth ended. He folded his arms and gazed at the\nclouded sky; and Christophe, after a glance at him, turned and went\n–Rastignac was left alone.",
        "He went a few paces further, to the highest point of the cemetery, and\nlooked out over Paris and the windings of the Seine; the lamps were\nbeginning to shine on either side of the river. His eyes turned almost\neagerly to the space between the column of the Place Vendome and the\ncupola of the Invalides; there lay the shining world that he had\nwished to reach. He glanced over that humming hive, seeming to draw a\nforetaste of its honey, and said magniloquently:",
        "“Henceforth there is war between us.”",
        "And by way of throwing down the glove to Society, Rastignac went to\ndine with Mme. de Nucingen.",
