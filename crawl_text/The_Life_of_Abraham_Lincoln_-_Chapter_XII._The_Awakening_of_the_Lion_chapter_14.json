        "\n\n",
        "The repeal of the Missouri Compromise caused great excitement\nthroughout the land. The conscience of the anti-slavery portion of the\ncommunity was shocked, as was also that of the large numbers of people\nwho, though not opposed to slavery in itself, were opposed to its\nextension. It showed that this institution had a deadening effect upon\nthe moral nature of the people who cherished it. There was no\ncompromise so generous that it would satisfy their greed, there were no\npromises so solemn that they could be depended on to keep them. They\nwere not content with maintaining slavery in their own territory. It\nwas not enough that they should be allowed to take slaves into a\nterritory consecrated to freedom, nor that all the powers of the law\nwere devoted to recapturing a runaway slave and returning him to\nrenewed horrors. They wanted all the territories which they had\npromised to let alone. It was a logical, and an altogether probable\nconclusion that they only waited for the opportunity to invade the\nnorthern states and turn them from free-soil into slave territory.",
        "The indignation over this outrage not only flamed from thousands of\npulpits, but newspapers and political clubs of all kinds took up the\nsubject on one side or the other. Every moralist became a politician,\nand every politician discussed the moral bearings of his tenets.",
        "In no locality was this excitement more intense than in Illinois. There\nwere special reasons for this. It is a very long state, stretching\nnearly five hundred miles from north to south. Now, it is a general law\namong Americans that migration follows very nearly the parallels of\nlatitude from East to West. For this reason the northern portion of the\nstate was mostly settled by northern people whose sympathies were\nagainst slavery; while the southern portion of the state was mostly\nsettled by southern people, whose sympathies were in favor of slavery.\nThe state was nearly evenly divided, and the presence of these two\nparties kept up a continual friction and intensified the feeling on\nboth sides.",
        "To this general condition must be added the fact that Illinois was the\nhome of Douglas, who was personally and almost solely responsible for\nthe repeal of the Missouri Compromise. In that state he had risen from\nobscurity to be the most conspicuous man in the United States. His\nparty had a decided majority in the state, and over it he had absolute\ncontrol. He was their idol. Imperious by nature, shrewd, unscrupulous,\na debater of marvelous skill, a master of assemblies, a man who knew\nnot the meaning of the word fail–this was Douglas. But his home was in\nChicago, a city in which the anti-slavery sentiment predominated.",
        "When Douglas returned to his state, his in more than one sense, it\nwas not as a conquering hero. He did not return direct from Washington,\nbut delayed, visiting various portions of the country. Possibly this\nwas due to the urgency of business, probably it was in order to give\ntime for the excitement to wear itself out. But this did not result,\nand his approach was the occasion of a fresh outbreak of feeling in\nChicago; the demonstrations of the residents of that city were not a\nflattering welcome home. Bells were tolled as for public mourning,\nflags were hung at half mast. Nothing was omitted that might emphasize\nthe general aversion to the man who had done that infamous deed.",
        "A public meeting was planned, at which he was to speak in defense of\nhis course. A large crowd, about five thousand people, gathered.\nDouglas was surrounded by his own friends, but the major portion of the\ncrowd was intensely hostile to him. When he began to speak the\nopposition broke out. He was interrupted by questions and comments.\nThese so exasperated him that he completely lost control of himself. He\nstormed, he shook his fist, he railed. The meeting broke up in\nconfusion. Then came a reaction which greatly profited him. The papers\npublished that he had attempted to speak and had not been allowed to do\nso, but had been hooted by a turbulent mob. All of which was true. By\nthe time he spoke again the sympathy of the public had swung to his\nside, and he was sure of a favorable hearing.",
        "This second speech was on the occasion of the state fair at\nSpringfield. Men of all kinds and of every political complexion were\npresent from even the remotest localities in the state. The speech was\nto be an address to a large audience fairly representative of the\nentire state.",
        "Lincoln was there. Not merely because Springfield was his home. He\ndoubtless would have been there anyhow. His ability as a politician,\nhis growing fame as a lawyer and a public speaker, his well-known\nantipathy to slavery, singled him out as the one man who was\npreeminently fitted to answer the speech of Douglas, and he was by a\ntacit agreement selected for this purpose.",
        "Lincoln himself felt the stirring impulse. It is not uncommon for the\ncall of duty, or opportunity, to come once in a lifetime to the heart\nof a man with over-mastering power, so that his purposes and powers are\nroused to an unwonted and transforming degree of activity. It is the\nflight of the eaglet, the awakening of the lion, the transfiguration of\nthe human spirit. To Lincoln this call now came. He was the same man,\nbut he had reached another stage of development, entered a new\nexperience, exhibiting new powers,–or the old powers to such a degree\nthat they were virtually new. It is the purpose of this chapter to note\nthree of his speeches which attest this awakening.",
        "The first of these was delivered at the state Fair at Springfield.\nDouglas had spoken October 3d, 1854. Lincoln was present, and it was\nmentioned by Douglas, and was by all understood, that he would reply\nthe following day, October 4th. Douglas was, up to that time, not only\nthe shrewdest politician in the country, but he was acknowledged to be\nthe ablest debater. He was particularly well prepared upon this\nsubject, for to it he had given almost his entire time for nearly a\nyear, and had discussed it in congress and out, and knew thoroughly the\ncurrent objections. The occasion was unusual, and this was to be, and\ndoubtless it was, his greatest effort.",
        "The following day came Lincoln’s reply. As a matter of fairness, he\nsaid at the outset that he did not want to present anything but the\ntruth. If he said anything that was not true, he would be glad to have\nDouglas correct him at once. Douglas, with customary shrewdness, took\nadvantage of this offer by making frequent interruptions, so as to\nbreak the effect of the logic and destroy the flow of thought. Finally\nLincoln’s patience was exhausted, and he paused in his argument to say:\n“Gentlemen, I cannot afford to spend my time in quibbles. I take the\nresponsibility of asserting the truth myself, relieving Judge Douglas\nfrom the necessity of his impertinent corrections.” This silenced his\nopponent, and he spoke without further interruption to the end, his\nspeech being three hours and ten minutes long.",
        "The effect of the speech was wonderful. The scene, as described next\nday in the Springfield Journal, is worth quoting:",
        "“Lincoln quivered with feeling and emotion. The whole house was as\nstill as death. He attacked the bill with unusual warmth and energy,\nand all felt that a man of strength was its enemy, and that he meant to\nblast it if he could by strong and manly efforts. He was most\nsuccessful; and the house approved the glorious triumph of truth by\nloud and long-continued huzzas.... Mr. Lincoln exhibited Douglas in all\nthe attitudes he could be placed in a friendly debate. He exhibited\nthe bill in all its aspects to show its humbuggery and falsehoods, and\nwhen thus torn to rags, cut into slips, held up to the gaze of the vast\ncrowd, a kind of scorn was visible upon the face of the crowd, and upon\nthe lips of the most eloquent speaker.... At the conclusion of the\nspeech, every man felt that it was unanswerable–that no human power\ncould overthrow it or trample it under foot. The long and repeated\napplause evinced the feelings of the crowd, and gave token, too, of the\nuniversal assent to Lincoln’s whole argument; and every mind present\ndid homage to the man who took captive the heart and broke like a sun\nover the understanding.”",
        "The speech itself, and the manner of its reception, could not other\nthan rouse Douglas to a tempest of wrath. It was a far more severe\npunishment than to be hooted from the stage, as he had been in Chicago.\nHe was handled as he had never been handled in his life. He took the\nplatform, angrily claimed that he had been abused, and started to\nreply. But he did not get far. He had no case. He became confused, lost\nhis self-control, hesitated, finally said that he would reply in the\nevening, and left the stage. That was the end of the incident so far as\nDouglas was concerned. When the evening came he had disappeared, and\nthere was no reply.",
        "Twelve days later, on October 16, Lincoln had promised to speak in\nPeoria. To that place Douglas followed, or preceded him. Douglas made\nhis speech in the afternoon, and Lincoln followed in the evening. It\nwas the same line of argument as in the other speech. Lincoln later\nconsented to write it out for publication. We thus have the Springfield\nand Peoria speech, minus the glow of extemporaneous address, the\ninspiration of the orator. These are important factors which not even\nthe man himself could reproduce. But we have his own report, which is\ntherefore authentic. The most salient point in his speech is his reply\nto Douglas’s plausible representation that the people of any locality\nwere competent to govern themselves. “I admit,” said Lincoln, “that the\nemigrant to Kansas and Nebraska is competent to govern himself, but I\ndeny his right to govern any other person without that other person’s\nconsent.” This is the kernel of the entire question of human slavery.",
        "The result of this speech at Peoria was less dramatic than that at\nSpringfield, but it was no less instructive. Douglas secured from\nLincoln an agreement that neither of them should again speak during\nthat campaign. It was quite evident that he had learned to fear his\nantagonist and did not wish again to risk meeting him on the rostrum.\nLincoln kept the agreement. Douglas did not. Before he got home in\nChicago, he stopped off to make another speech.",
        "These speeches were made in 1854. It is now worth while to skip over\ntwo years to record another epoch-making speech, one which in spirit\nand temper belongs here. For it shows to what intensity Lincoln was\naroused on this vast and ever-encroaching subject of slavery. This was\nat the convention which was held in Bloomington for the purpose of\norganizing the Republican party. The date of the convention was May 29,\n1856. The center of interest was Lincoln’s speech. The reporters were\nthere in sufficient force, and we would surely have had a verbatim\nreport–except for one thing. The reporters did not report. Let Joseph\nMedill, of the Chicago Tribune, tell why:",
        "“It was my journalistic duty, though a delegate to the convention, to\nmake a ’long-hand’ report of the speeches delivered for the Chicago\nTribune. I did make a few paragraphs of what Lincoln said in the\nfirst eight or ten minutes, but I became so absorbed in his magnetic\noratory, that I forgot myself and ceased to take notes, and joined with\nthe convention in cheering and stamping and clapping to the end of his\nspeech.",
        "I well remember that after Lincoln had sat down and calm had succeeded\nthe tempest, I waked out of a sort of hypnotic trance, and then thought\nof my report for the Tribune. There was nothing written but an\nabbreviated introduction.",
        "It was some sort of satisfaction to find that I had not been ’scooped,’\nas all the newspaper men present had been equally carried away by the\nexcitement caused by the wonderful oration, and had made no report or\nsketch of the speech.”",
        "Mr. Herndon, who was Lincoln’s law partner, and who knew him so\nintimately that he might be trusted to keep his coolness during the\nenthusiasm of the hour, and who had the mechanical habit of taking\nnotes for him, because he was his partner, said: “I attempted for about\nfifteen minutes, as was usual with me then, to take notes, but at the\nend of that time I threw pen and paper away and lived only in the\ninspiration of the hour.”",
        "There is no doubt that the audience was generally, if not unanimously,\naffected in the same way. The hearers went home and told about this\nwonderful speech. Journalists wrote flaming editorials about it. The\nfame of it went everywhere, but there was no report of it. It therefore\ncame to be known as “Lincoln’s lost speech.”",
        "Precisely forty years afterwards one H. C. Whitney published in one of\nthe magazines an account of it. He says that he made notes of the\nspeech, went home and wrote them out. Why he withheld this report from\nthe public for so many years, especially in view of the general demand\nfor it, does not precisely appear. The report, however, is interesting.",
        "But after the lapse of nearly half a century, it is a matter of minor\nimportance whether Mr. Whitney’s report be accurate or not. To us the\nvalue of the three speeches mentioned in this chapter is found largely\nin the impression they produced upon the hearers. The three taken\ntogether show that Lincoln had waked to a new life. The lion in him was\nthoroughly roused, he was clothed with a tremendous power, which up to\nthis point had not been suspected by antagonists nor dreamed of by\nadmiring friends. This new and mighty power he held and wielded until\nhis life’s end. Thenceforth he was an important factor in national\nhistory.",
