        "A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\nwent nearer to watch them, and, just as she came up to them, she heard\none of them say, “Look out, now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me\nlike that!”",
        "“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone. “Seven jogged my\nelbow.”",
        "On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the\nblame on others!”",
        "“You’d better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded.”",
        "“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.",
        "“That’s none of your business, Two!” said Seven.",
        "“Yes, it is his business!” said Five. “And I’ll tell him—it was for\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”",
        "Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun, “Well, of all the\nunjust things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood\nwatching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked\nround also, and all of them bowed low.",
        "“Would you tell me, please,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you\nare painting those roses?”",
        "Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began, in a low\nvoice, “Why, the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been\na red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and, if the\nQueen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you\nknow. So you see, Miss, we’re doing out best, afore she comes, to—\"\nAt this moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the\ngarden, called out, “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners\ninstantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of\nmany footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.",
        "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs: these were all shaped like the\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\ncorners: next the ten courtiers: these were ornamented all over with\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these\ncame the royal children: there were ten of them, and the little dears\ncame jumping merrily along, hand in hand, in couples: they were all\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\nand among them Alice recognized the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\nthe King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS.",
        "Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her\nface like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having\nheard of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the\nuse of a procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down on\ntheir faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood where she\nwas, and waited.",
        "When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and\nlooked at her, and the Queen said, severely, “Who is this?”",
        "She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in\nreply.",
        "“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently: and, turning to\nAlice, she went on: “What’s your name, child?”",
        "“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;\nbut she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards after\nall. I needn’t be afraid of them!”",
        "“And who are these?” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying\non their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the\nrest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or\nsoldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.",
        "“How should I know!” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s\nno business of mine.”",
        "The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\nmoment like a wild beast, began screaming, “Off with her head! Off\nwith—”",
        "“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\nsilent.",
        "The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said, “Consider, my\ndear: she is only a child!”",
        "The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave, “Turn\nthem over!”",
        "The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.",
        "“Get up!” said the Queen in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, Queen,\nthe royal children, and everybody else.",
        "“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on “What have you been doing\nhere?”",
        "“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going\ndown on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”",
        "“I see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the\nroses. “Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of\nthe soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners,\nwho ran to Alice for protection.",
        "“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after\nthe others.",
        "“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.",
        "“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers\nshouted in reply.",
        "“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”",
        "The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\nevidently meant for her.",
        "“Yes!” shouted Alice.",
        "“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\nwondering very much what would happen next.",
        "“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.",
        "“Very,” said Alice. “Where’s the Duchess?”",
        "“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone. He looked\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered, “She’s under\nsentence of execution.”",
        "“What for?” said Alice.",
        "“Did you say, ’What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.",
        "“No, I didn’t,” said Alice. “I don’t think it’s at all a pity.\nI said ’What for?’”",
        "“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\nscream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\ntone. “The Queen will hear you! You see she came rather late, and the\nQueen said—”",
        "“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\nother: however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\nbegan.",
        "Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her\nlife: it was all ridges and furrows: the croquet balls were live\nhedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to\ndouble themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the\narches.",
        "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her\nflamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably\nenough under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just\nas she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give\nthe hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and\nlook up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not\nhelp bursting out laughing; and, when she had got its head down, and\nwas going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the\nhedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away:\nbesides all this, there was generally a ridge or a furrow in the way\nwherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up\nsoldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the\nground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult\ngame indeed.",
        "The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short\ntime the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about and\nshouting, “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a\nminute.",
        "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure she had not as yet had any\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully\nfond of beheading people here: the great wonder is that there’s any\none left alive!”",
        "",
        "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether\nshe could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but after\nwatching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin, and she said\nto herself, “It’s the Cheshire-Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\nto.”",
        "“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\nenough for it to speak with.",
        "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use\nspeaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least\none of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then\nAlice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling\nvery glad she had some one to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think\nthat there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.",
        "“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a\ncomplaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\none’s self speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular:\nat least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\nconfusing it is all the things being alive: for instance, there’s the\narch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\nground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now,\nonly it ran away when it saw mine coming!”",
        "“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.",
        "“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on\n“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”",
        "The Queen smiled and passed on.",
        "“Who are you talking to?” said the King, coming up to Alice, and\nlooking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.",
        "“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire-Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to\nintroduce it.”",
        "“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may\nkiss my hand, if it likes.”",
        "“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.",
        "“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like\nthat!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.",
        "“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,\nbut I don’t remember where.”",
        "“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly; and he\ncalled to the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish\nyou would have this Cat removed!”",
        "The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\nsmall. “Off with his head!” she said without even looking round.",
        "“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he\nhurried off.",
        "Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going\non, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never\nknew whether it was her turn or not. So she went off in search of her\nhedgehog.",
        "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which\nseemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them\nwith the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone\nacross to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it\ntrying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.",
        "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\nmatter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this\nside of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it\nmight not escape again, and went back to have a little more\nconversation with her friend.",
        "When she got back to the Cheshire-Cat, she was surprised to find quite\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at\nonce, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very\nuncomfortable.",
        "The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as\nthey all spoke at once, she found it very hard to make out exactly\nwhat they said.",
        "The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head\nunless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to\ndo such a thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of\nlife.",
        "The King’s argument was that anything that had a head could be\nbeheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.",
        "The Queen’s argument was that, if something wasn’t done about it in\nless than no time, she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\nanxious.)",
        "Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the\nDuchess: you’d better ask her about it.”",
        "“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her\nhere.” And the executioner went off like an arrow.",
        "The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared:\nso the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down, looking for\nit, while the rest of the party went back to the game.",
