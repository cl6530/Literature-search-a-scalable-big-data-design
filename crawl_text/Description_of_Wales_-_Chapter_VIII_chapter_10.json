        "Concerning the nature, manners, and dress, the boldness, agility,\nand courage, of this nation",
        "This people is light and active, hardy rather than strong, and\nentirely bred up to the use of arms; for not only the nobles, but\nall the people are trained to war, and when the trumpet sounds the\nalarm, the husbandman rushes as eagerly from his plough as the\ncourtier from his court; for here it is not found that, as in other\nplaces,",
        "“Agricolis labor actus in orbem,”",
        "returns; for in the months of March and April only the soil is once\nploughed for oats, and again in the summer a third time, and in\nwinter for wheat.  Almost all the people live upon the produce of\ntheir herds, with oats, milk, cheese, and butter; eating flesh in\nlarger proportions than bread.  They pay no attention to commerce,\nshipping, or manufactures, and suffer no interruption but by\nmartial exercises.  They anxiously study the defence of their\ncountry and their liberty; for these they fight, for these they\nundergo hardships, and for these willingly sacrifice their lives;\nthey esteem it a disgrace to die in bed, an honour to die in the\nfield of battle; using the poet’s expressions, -",
        "“Procul hinc avertite pacem,\nNobilitas cum pace perit.”",
        "Nor is it wonderful if it degenerates, for the ancestors of these\nmen, the AEneadae, rushed to arms in the cause of liberty.  It is\nremarkable that this people, though unarmed, dares attack an armed\nfoe; the infantry defy the cavalry, and by their activity and\ncourage generally prove victors.  They resemble in disposition and\nsituation those conquerors whom the poet Lucan mentions:",
        "- “Populi quos despicit Arctos,\nFelices errore suo, quos ille timorum\nMaximus haud urget leti metus, inde ruendi\nIn ferrum, mens prona viris, amimaeque capaces,\nMortis et ignavum rediturae parsere vitae.”",
        "They make use of light arms, which do not impede their agility,\nsmall coats of mail, bundles of arrows, and long lances, helmets\nand shields, and more rarely greaves plated with iron.  The higher\nclass go to battle mounted on swift and generous steeds, which\ntheir country produces; but the greater part of the people fight on\nfoot, on account of the marshy nature and unevenness of the soil.\nThe horsemen as their situation or occasion requires, willingly\nserve as infantry, in attacking or retreating; and they either walk\nbare-footed, or make use of high shoes, roughly constructed with\nuntanned leather.  In time of peace, the young men, by penetrating\nthe deep recesses of the woods, and climbing the tops of mountains,\nlearn by practice to endure fatigue through day and night; and as\nthey meditate on war during peace, they acquire the art of fighting\nby accustoming themselves to the use of the lance, and by inuring\nthemselves to hard exercise.",
        "In our time, king Henry II., in reply to the inquiries of Emanuel,\nemperor of Constantinople, concerning the situation, nature, and\nstriking peculiarities of the British island, among other\nremarkable circumstances mentioned the following:  “That in a\ncertain part of the island there was a people, called Welsh, so\nbold and ferocious that, when unarmed, they did not fear to\nencounter an armed force; being ready to shed their blood in\ndefence of their country, and to sacrifice their lives for renown;\nwhich is the more surprising, as the beasts of the field over the\nwhole face of the island became gentle, but these desperate men\ncould not be tamed.  The wild animals, and particularly the stags\nand hinds, are so abundant, owing to the little molestation they\nreceive, that in our time, in the northern parts of the island\ntowards the Peak, (17) when pursued by the hounds and hunters, they\ncontributed, by their numbers, to their own destruction.”",
