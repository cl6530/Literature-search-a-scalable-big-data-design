        "SALOMON saies; A good Name is as a precious\noyntment; And I assure my selfe, such wil\nyour Graces Name bee, with Posteritie.  For your\nFortune, and Merit both, have been Eminent.  And\nyou have planted Things, that are like to last.  I doe\nnow publish my Essayes; which, of all my other\nworkes, have beene most Currant: For that, as it\nseemes, they come home, to Mens Businesse, and\nBosomes.  I have enlarged them, both in Number,\nand Weight; So that they are indeed a New Worke.\nI thought it therefore agreeable, to my Affection,\nand Obligation to your Grace, to prefix your Name\nbefore them, both in English, and in Latine.  For I\ndoe conceive, that the Latine Volume of them,\n(being in the Universall Language) may last, as\nlong as Bookes last.  My Instauration, I dedicated to\nthe King: My Historie of Henry the Seventh,\n(which I have now also translated into Latine) and\nmy Portions of Naturall History, to the Prince:\nAnd these I dedicate to your Grace; Being of the\nbest Fruits, that by the good Encrease, which God\ngives to my Pen and Labours, I could yeeld.\nGod leade your Grace by the Hand.  Your Graces\nmost Obliged and faithfull Servant,",
