        "There was not a sound.  That stillness, weird, unnerving, that\npermeated, as it were, everywhere through that mysterious house,\nwas, if that were possible, accentuated now.  The four masked men in\nevening dress, five including their leader, for the man who had\nappeared in that other room with the rabbit was not here, were as\nsilent, as motionless, as the dead man who was lashed there in the\nchair.  And to Jimmie Dale it seemed at first as though his brain,\nstunned and stupefied at the shock, refused its functions, and left\nhim groping blindly, vaguely, with only a sort of dull, subconscious\nrealisation of menace and a deadly peril, imminent, hanging over\nhim.",
        "He tried to rouse himself mentally, to prod his brain to action, to\npit it in a fight for life against these self-confessed criminals\nand murderers with their mask of culture, who surrounded him now.\nWas there a way out?  What was it the Tocsin had said–\"the most\npowerful and pitiless organisation of criminals the world has ever\nknown–the stake a fortune of millions–her life!”  There had,\nindeed, been no overemphasis in the words she had used!  They had\ntaken pains themselves to make that ominously clear, these men!\nEvery detail of the strange house, with its luxurious furnishings,\nits cleverly contrived appointments, breathed a horribly suggestive\ndegree of power, a deadly purpose, and an organisation swayed by a\nmaster mind; and, grim evidence of the merciless, inexorable length\nto which they would go, was the ghastly white face of the dead\nchauffeur, bound hand and foot, in the chair before him!",
        "That EMPTY glass in the hand of one of the men!  He could not take\nhis eyes from it–except as his eyes were drawn magnetically to that\nFULL glass in the hand of one of the others.  What height of\nsardonic irony!  He was to drink that other glass, to die because he\nrefused to answer questions that for years, with every resource at\nhis command, risking his liberty, his wealth, his name, his life,\nwith everything that he cared for thrown into the scales, he had\nstruggled to solve–and failed!",
        "And then the leader spoke.",
        "“Mr. Dale,” he said, with cold significance, “I regret to admit that\nyour pseudo taxicab driver was so ill-advised as to refuse to answer\nthe SAME questions that I have put to you.”",
        "Five to one!  That was the only way out–and it was hopeless.  It\nwas the only way out, because, convinced that he could answer those\nquestions if he wanted to, these men were in deadly earnest; it was\nhopeless, because they were–five to one!  And probably there were\nas many more, twice or three times as many more within call.  But\nwhat did it matter how many more there were!  He could fight until\nhe was overpowered, that was all he could do, and the five could\naccomplish that.  Still, if he could knock the full glass out of\nthat man’s hand, and gain the door, then perhaps–he turned quickly,\nas the door opened.  It was as though they had read his thoughts.  A\nnumber of men were grouped outside in the corridor, then the door\nclosed again with a cordon ranged against it inside the room; and at\nthe same instant his arms and wrists were caught in a powerful grasp\nby the two men immediately behind him, who all along had enacted the\nrole of guards.",
        "Again the leader spoke.",
        "“I will repeat the questions,” he said sharply.  “Where is the woman\nwhose ring was found on that man there in the chair?  And where is\nthe package that you two men had with you in the taxicab to-night?”",
        "Jimmie Dale glanced from the tall, straight, immaculately clothed\nfigure of the speaker, from the threatening smile on the set lips\nthat just showed under the edge of the mask, to the dead man in the\nchair.  He had faced the prospect of death before many times, but it\nhad come with the heat of passion accompanying it, it had come\nquickly, abruptly, with every faculty called into action to combat\nit, without time to dwell upon it, to sift, weigh, or measure its\nmeaning, and if there had been fear it had been subordinate to other\nemotions.  But it was different now.  He could not, of course,\nanswer those questions; nor, he was doggedly conscious, would he\nhave answered them if he could–and there was no middle course.",
        "Death, within the next few moments, stared him in the face; and it\nseemed curiously irrelevant that, in a sort of unnatural calmness,\nhe should be attempting to analyse his feelings and emotions\nconcerning it.  All his life it had seemed to him that the acme of\nhuman mental torture was the cell of a condemned criminal, with the\nhorror of its hopelessness, with the time to dwell upon it; and that\nthe acme of that torture itself must be that awful moment\nimmediately preceding execution, when anticipation at last was to\nmerge into soul-sickening reality.",
        "Strange that thought should come!  Strange that he should be framing\na brain picture of such a scene, vivid, minute in detail!  No–not\nstrange.  He was picturing himself.  The analogy was not perfect, it\nwas true, he had not had the months, weeks, days and hours of\nsuspense; but it was perfect enough to bring home to him with\nappalling force the realisation of his position.  He was standing as\na condemned man might stand in those last, final moments, those\nmoments which he had imagined must be the most terrible that could\nexist in life; but that dismay of soul, the horror, the terror were\nnot his–there was, instead, a smouldering fury, a passionate\namazement that it was his own life that was threatened.  It seemed\nimpossible that it could be his voice that was speaking now in such\nquiet, measured tones.",
        "“Is it worth while, will it convince you now, any more than before,\nto repeat that there is some mistake here?  I am no more able to\nanswer your questions than you are yourselves.  I never saw that man\nin the chair there in my life until the moment that I hailed him in\nhis cab to-night.  I do not know who the woman is to whom that ring\nbelongs, much less do I know where she is.  And if there was a\npackage of any sort in the taxicab, as you state, I never saw it.”",
        "The lips under the mask curved into a lupine smile.",
        "“Think well, Mr. Dale!”  The man’s voice was low, menacing.\n“Ethically, if you so choose to consider it, your refusal may be the\nact of a brave man; practically, it is the act of–a fool.  Now–\nyour answer!”",
        "“I have answered you,” said Jimmie Dale–and, relaxing the muscles\nin his arms, let them hang limply for an instant in the grip of the\ntwo men behind him.  “I have no other answer.”",
        "It was only a sign, a motion of the leader’s hand–but with it,\nquick as a lightning flash, Jimmie Dale was in action.  The limp\narms tautened into steel as he wrenched them loose, and, whirling\naround, he whipped his fist to the chin of one of the two guards.",
        "In an instant, with the blow, as the man staggered backward, the\nroom was in pandemonium.  There was a rush from the door, and two,\nthree, four leaping forms hurled themselves upon Jimmie Dale.  He\nshook them off–and they came again.  There was no chance\nultimately, he knew that; it was only the elemental within him that\nrose in fierce revolt at the thought of tame submission, that bade\nhim sell his life as dearly as he could.  Panting, gasping for\nbreath, dragging them by sheer strength as they clung to him, he got\nhis back to the wall, fighting with the savage fury and abandon of a\nwild cat.",
        "But it could not last.  Where one man went down before him, two\nremorselessly appeared–the room seemed filled with men–they poured\nin through the door–he laughed at them in a half-demented way–more\nand more of them came–there was no play for his arms, no room to\nfight–they seemed so close around him, so many of them upon him,\nthat he could not breathe–and he was bending, being crushed down as\nby an intolerable weight.  And then his feet were jerked from\nbeneath him, he crashed to the floor, and, in another moment, bound\nhand and foot, he was tied into a chair beside that other chair\nwhose grim occupant sat in such ghastly apathy of the scene.",
        "The room cleared instantly of all but the original five.  His head\nwas drawn suddenly, violently backward, and clamped in that\nposition; and a metal instrument, forced into his mouth, while his\nlips bled in their resistance, pried jaws apart and held them open.",
        "“One drop!” the leader ordered curtly.",
        "The man with the full glass bent over him, and dipped a glass rod\ninto the liquid.  The drop glistened a ruby red on the end of the\nrod–and fell with a sharp, acrid, burning sensation upon Jimmie\nDale’s tongue.",
        "For a moment Jimmie Dale’s animation, mental and physical, seemed\nswept away from him in, as it were, a hiatus of hideous suspense.\nWhat was it to be like this passing?  Why did it not act at once, as\nit had acted on the rabbit they had showed him in the other room?\nYes, he remembered!  It took more than one drop for a man; and\nbesides, this was diluted.  One drop had no effect on a man; it\nrequired–  Good God, ONE DROP EVEN OF THIS WAS ENOUGH?  He strained\nforward in the chair until the sweat in great beads sprang from his\nforehead, strained and fought and tore at his bonds in a paroxysm of\nmadness to free himself while there still remained a little\nstrength.  There was something filming before his eyes, a numbed\nfeeling was creeping through his limbs, robbing them, sapping them\nof their vitality and power.  He felt himself slipping away into a\nstate of utter weakness, and his brain began to grow confused.",
        "A voice seemed to float in the air near him:  “For the last time–\nwill you answer?”",
        "With a supreme effort, Jimmie Dale strove to rally his tottering\nsenses.  Did they not understand the stupendous mockery of their\nquestions?  Did they not understand that he did not know?  He had\ntold them so–perhaps he had better tell them so again.",
        "“I–”  He tried to speak, and found the words thick upon his tongue.\n“I–do not–know.”",
        "The glass itself was thrust abruptly between his lips.  Some of the\ncontents spilled and trickled upon his chin, and then a flood of it,\nburning, fiery, poured down his throat.  A flood of it–and it\nneeded but THREE drops and there had been TEN in the glass!",
        "So this was death–a hazy, nebulous thing!  There was no pain.  It\nwas like–like–nothingness.  And out of the nothingness SHE came.\nStrange that she should come!  Alone she had fought these fiends and\noutwitted them for–how long was it?  Three years!  She would be\nmore than ever alone now.  Pray God she did not finally fall into\ntheir clutches!",
        "How it burned now, that fatal draught they had forced down his\nthroat, and how it gripped at him and seemed to eat and bore its way\ninto the very tissues!  It was the end, and–no!  It was STIMULATING\nhim!  Strength seemed to be returning to his limbs; it seemed as\nthough he were being carried, as though the bonds about him were\nbeing loosened; and now his brain seemed to be growing clearer.",
        "He roused up with a startled exclamation.  He was back in the same\nroom in which he had first returned to consciousness after the\naccident.  He was on the same couch.  The same masked figure was at\nthe same desk.  Had he been dreaming?  Was this then only some\nhorrible, ghastly nightmare through which he had passed?",
        "No, it had been real enough; his clothes, rent and torn, and the\nblood upon his hands, where the skin had been scraped from his\nknuckles in the fight, bore evidence to that.  He must then have\nlost consciousness for a while, though it seemed to him that at no\nmoment, hazy, irrational though his brain might have been, had he\nbecome entirely oblivious to what was taking place around him.  And\nyet it must have been so!",
        "The eyes from behind the mask were fixed steadily upon him, and\nbelow the mask there was the hard, unpleasant set to the lips that\nJimmie Dale had grown accustomed to expect.",
        "The man spoke abruptly.",
        "“That you find yourself alive, Mr. Dale,” he said grimly, “is no\nconfession of weakness upon the part of those with whom you have had\nto deal here.  To bear witness to that there is one who is not\nalive, as you have seen.  That man we knew.  With you it was\nsomewhat different.  Your presence in the taxicab was only\nsuspicious.  There was always the possibility that you might be one\nof those ubiquitous ’innocent bystanders.’  Your name, your\nposition, the improbability that you could have anything in common\nwith–shall we say, the matter that so deeply interests us?–was all\nin your favour.  However, presumption and probability are the tools\nof fools.  We do not depend upon them–we apply the test.  And\nhaving applied the test, we are convinced that you have told the\ntruth–that is all.”",
        "He rose from his chair brusquely.  “I shall not apologise to you for\nwhat has happened.  I doubt very much if you are in a frame of mind\nto accept anything of the sort.  I imagine, rather, that you are\npromising yourself that we shall pay, and pay dearly, for this–\nthat, among other things, we shall answer for the murder of that man\nin the other room.  All this will be quite within your province, Mr.\nDale–and quite fruitless.  To-morrow morning the story that you are\npreparing to tell now would sound incredible even in your own ears;\nfurthermore, as we shall take pains to see that you leave this place\nwith as little knowledge of its location as you obtained when you\narrived, your story, even if believed, would do little service to\nyou and less harm to us.  I think of nothing more, Mr. Dale, except–\"\nThere was a whimsical smile on the lips now.  “Ah, yes, the\nmatter of your clothes.  We can, and shall be glad to make\nreparation to you to the slight extent of offering you a new suit\nbefore you go.”",
        "Jimmie Dale scowled.  Sick, shaken, and weak as he was, the cool,\nimperturbable impudence of the man was fast growing unbearable.",
        "The man laughed.  “I am sure you will not refuse, Mr. Dale–since we\ninsist.  The condition of the clothes you have on at present might–\nI say ’might’–in a measure support your story with some degree of\ntangible evidence.  It is not at all likely, of course; but we\nprefer to discount even so remote a possibility.  When you have\nchanged, you will be motored back to your home.  I bid you good-\nnight, Mr. Dale.”",
        "Jimmie Dale rubbed his eyes.  The man was gone–through a door at\nthe rear of the desk, a door that he had not noticed before, that\nwas not even in evidence now, that was simply a movable section of\nthe wall panelling–and for an instant Jimmie Dale experienced a\nsense of sickening impotence.  It was as though he stood\ndefenceless, unarmed, and utterly at the mercy of some venomous\npower that could crush what it would remorselessly and at will in\nits might.",
        "The place was a veritable maze, a lair of hellish cleverness.  He\nhad no illusions now, he laboured under no false estimate of either\nthe ingenuity or the resources of this inhuman nest of vultures to\nwhom murder was no more than a matter of detail.  And it was against\nthese men that henceforth he was to match his wits!  There could be\nno truce, no armistice.  It was their lives, or hers, or his!  Well,\nhe was alive now, the first round was over, and so far he had won.\nHis brows furrowed suddenly.  Had he?  He was not so sure, after\nall.  He was conscious of a disquieting, premonitory intuition that,\nin some way which he could not explain, the honours were not\nentirely his.",
        "He was apparently–the “apparently” was a mental reservation–quite\nalone in the room.  He got up from the couch and walked shakily\nacross the floor to the desk.  A revolver lay invitingly upon the\nblotting pad.  It was his own, the one they had taken from him after\nthe accident.  Jimmie Dale picked it up, examined it–and smiled a\nlittle sarcastically at himself for his trouble.  It was unloaded,\nof course.  He was twirling it in his hand, as a man, masked as\nevery one in the house was masked, and carrying a neatly folded suit\nover his arm, entered from the corridor.",
        "“The car is ready as soon as you are dressed,” announced the other\nbriefly.  He laid the clothes upon the couch–and settled himself\nsignificantly in a chair.",
        "Jimmie Dale hesitated.  Then, with a shrug of his shoulders,\nrecrossed the room, and began to remove his torn garments.  What was\nthe use!  They would certainly have their own way in the end.  It\nwasn’t worth another fight, and there was nothing to be gained by a\nrefusal except to offer a sop to his own exasperation.",
        "He dressed quickly, in what proved to be an exceedingly well-fitting\nsuit; and finally turned tentatively to the man in the chair.",
        "The other stood up, and produced a heavy black silk scarf.",
        "“If you have no objections,” he said curtly, “I’ll tie this over\nyour eyes.”",
        "Again Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders.",
        "“I am glad enough to get out on any conditions,” he answered\ncaustically.",
        "“’Fortunate’ would be the better word,” rejoined the other\nmeaningly–and, deftly knotting the scarf, led Jimmie Dale\nblindfolded from the room.",
