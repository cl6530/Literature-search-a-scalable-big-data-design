        "God hath made all things in the world, nay, the world\nitself, free from hindrance and perfect, and its parts for the\nuse of the whole. No other creature is capable of comprehending\nHis administration thereof; but the reasonable being Man\npossesses faculties for the consideration of all these thingsâ€”\nnot only that he is himself a part, but what part he is, and how\nit is meet that the parts should give place to the whole. Nor is\nthis all. Being naturally constituted noble, magnanimous, and\nfree, he sees that the things which surround him are of two\nkinds. Some are free from hindrance and in the power of the will.\nOthers are subject to hindrance, and depend on the will of other\nmen. If then he place his own good, his own best interest, only\nin that which is free from hindrance and in his power, he will be\nfree, tranquil, happy, unharmed, noble-hearted, and pious; giving\nthanks for all things unto God, finding fault with nothing that\ncomes to pass, laying no charge against anything. Whereas if he\nplace his good in outward things, depending not on the will, he\nmust perforce be subject to hindrance and restraint, the slave of\nthose that have power over the things he desires and fears; he\nmust perforce be impious, as deeming himself injured at the hands\nof God; he must be unjust, as ever prone to claim more than his\ndue; he must perforce be of a mean and abject spirit.",
