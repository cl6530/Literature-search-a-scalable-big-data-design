        "It was to be the Sila in earnest, this time. I would traverse the whole\ncountry, from the Coscile valley to Catanzaro, at the other end.\nArriving from Cosenza the train deposited me, once more, at the unlovely\nstation of Castrovillari. I looked around the dusty square, half-dazed\nby the sunlight–it was a glittering noonday in July–but the postal\nwaggon to Spezzano Albanese, my first resting-point, had not yet\narrived. Then a withered old man, sitting on a vehicle behind the sorry\nskeleton of a horse, volunteered to take me there at once; we quickly\ncame to terms; it was too hot, we both agreed, to waste breath in\nbargaining. With the end of his whip he pointed out the church of\nSpezzano on its hilltop; a proud structure it looked at this distance,\nthough nearer acquaintance reduced it to extremely humble proportions.",
        "The Albanian Spezzano (Spezzano Grande is another place) lies on the\nmain road from Castrovillari to Cosenza, on the summit of a\nlong-stretched tongue of limestone which separates the Crati river from\nthe Esaro; this latter, after flowing into the Coscile, joins its waters\nwith the Crati, and so closes the promontory. An odd geographical\nfeature, this low stretch, viewed from the greater heights of Sila or\nPollino; one feels inclined to take a broom and sweep it into the sea,\nso that the waters may mingle sooner.",
        "Our road ascended the thousand feet in a sinuous ribbon of white dust,\nand an eternity seemed to pass as we crawled drowsily upwards to the\nmusic of the cicadas, under the simmering blue sky. There was not a soul\nin sight; a hush had fallen upon all things; great Pan was brooding over\nthe earth. At last we entered the village, and here, once more,\ndeathlike stillness reigned; it was the hour of post-prandial slumber.",
        "At our knocking the proprietor of the inn, situated in a side-street,\ndescended. But he was in bad humour, and held out no hopes of\nrefreshment. Certain doctors and government officials, he said, were\ngathered together in his house, telegraphically summoned to consult\nabout a local case of cholera. As to edibles, the gentlemen had lunched,\nand nothing was left, absolutely nothing; it had been uno\nsterminio–an extermination–of all he possessed. The prospect of\nwalking about the burning streets till evening did not appeal to me, and\nas this was the only inn at Spezzano I insisted, first gently, then\nforcibly–in vain. There was not so much as a chair to sit upon, he\navowed; and therewith retired into his cool twilight.",
        "Despairing, I entered a small shop wherein I had observed the only signs\nof life so far–an Albanian woman spinning in patriarchal fashion. It\nwas a low-ceilinged room, stocked with candles, seeds, and other\ncommodities which a humble householder might desire to purchase,\nincluding certain of those water-gugglets of Corigliano ware in whose\nshapely contours something of the artistic dreamings of old Sybaris\nstill seems to linger. The proprietress, clothed in gaudily picturesque\ncostume, greeted me with a smile and the easy familiarity which I have\nsince discovered to be natural to all these women. She had a room, she\nsaid, where I could rest; there was also food, such as it was, cheese,\nand wine, and-----",
        "“Fruit?” I queried.",
        "“Ah, you like fruit? Well, we may not so much as speak about it just\nnow–the cholera, the doctors, the policeman, the prison! I was going to\nsay salami.”",
        "Salami? I thanked her. I know Calabrian pigs and what they feed on,\nthough it would be hard to describe in the language of polite society.",
        "Despite the heat and the swarms of flies in that chamber, I felt little\ndesire for repose after her simple repast; the dame was so affable and\nentertaining that we soon became great friends. I caused her some\namusement by my efforts to understand and pronounce her language–these\nfolk speak Albanian and Italian with equal facility–which seemed to my\nunpractised ears as hopeless as Finnish. Very patiently, she gave me a\nlong lesson during which I thought to pick up a few words and phrases,\nbut the upshot of it all was:",
        "“You’ll never learn it. You have begun a hundred years too late.”",
        "I tried her with modern Greek, but among such fragments as remained on\nmy tongue after a lapse of over twenty years, only hit upon one word\nthat she could understand.",
        "“Quite right!” she said encouragingly. “Why don’t you always speak\nproperly? And now, let me hear a little of your own language.”",
        "I gave utterance to a few verses of Shakespeare, which caused\nconsiderable merriment.",
        "“Do you mean to tell me,” she asked, “that people really talk like that?”",
        "“Of course they do.”",
        "“And pretend to understand what it means?”",
        "“Why, naturally.”",
        "“Maybe they do,” she agreed. “But only when they want to be thought\nfunny by their friends.”",
        "The afternoon drew on apace, and at last the pitiless sun sank to rest.\nI perambulated Spezzano in the gathering twilight; it was now fairly\nalive with people. An unclean place; an epidemic of cholera would work\nwonders here. . . .",
        "At 9.30 p.m. the venerable coachman presented himself, by appointment;\nhe was to drive me slowly (out of respect for his horse) through the\ncool hours of the night as far as Vaccarizza, on the slopes of the Greek\nSila, where he expected to arrive early in the morning. (And so he did;\nat half-past five.) Not without more mirth was my leave-taking from the\ngood shopwoman; something, apparently, was hopelessly wrong with the\nAlbanian words of farewell which I had carefully memorized from our\npreceding lesson. She then pressed a paper parcel into my hand.",
        "“For the love of God,” she whispered, “silence! Or we shall all be in\njail to-morrow.”",
        "It contained a dozen pears.",
        "Driving along, I tried to enter into conversation with the coachman who,\njudging by his face, was a mine of local lore. But I had come too late;\nthe poor old man was so weakened by age and infirmities that he cared\nlittle for talk, his thoughts dwelling, as I charitably imagined, on his\nwife and children, all dead and buried (so he said) many long years ago.\nHe mentioned, however, the diluvio, the deluge, which I have heard\nspoken of by older people, among whom it is a fixed article of faith.\nThis deluge is supposed to have affected the whole Crati valley,\nsubmerging towns and villages. In proof, they say that if you dig near\nTarsia below the present river-level, you will pass through beds of silt\nand ooze to traces of old walls and cultivated land. Tarsia used to lie\nby the river-side, and was a flourishing place, according to the\ndescriptions of Leandro Alberti and other early writers; floods and\nmalaria have now forced it to climb the hills.",
        "The current of the Crati is more spasmodic and destructive than in\nclassical times when the river was “navigable\"; and to one of its\ninundations may be due this legend of the deluge; to the same\none, maybe, that affected the courses of this river and the Coscile,\nmingling their waters which used to flow separately into the Ionian. Or\nit may be a hazy memory of the artificial changing of the riverbed when\nthe town of Sybaris, lying between these two rivers, was destroyed. Yet\nthe streams are depicted as entering the sea apart in old maps such as\nthose of Magini, Fiore, Coronelli, and Cluver; and the latter writes\nthat “near the mouth of the Crati there flows into the same sea a river\nvulgarly called Cochile.” [Footnote: In the earlier part of\nRathgeber’s astonishing “Grossgriechenland und Pythagoras” (1866) will\nbe found a good list of old maps of the country.]",
        "This is important. It remains to be seen whether this statement is the\nresult of a personal visit, or whether he simply repeated the old\ngeography. His text in many places indicates a personal acquaintance\nwith southern Italy–Italian, says Heinsius, non semel\nperagravit– and he may well have been tempted to investigate a site\nlike that of Sybaris. If so, the change in the river courses and\npossibly this “deluge” has taken place since his day.",
        "Deprived of converse, I relapsed into a doze, but soon woke up with a\nstart. The carriage had stopped; it was nearly midnight; we were at\nTerranova di Sibari, whose houses were lit up by the silvery beams of\nthe moon.",
        "Thurii–death-place of Herodotus! How one would like to see this place\nby daylight. On the ancient site, which lies at a considerable distance,\nthey have excavated antiquities, a large number of which are in the\npossession of the Marchese Galli at Castrovillari. I endeavoured to see\nhis museum, but found it inaccessible for “family reasons.” The same\nanswer was given me in regard to a valuable private library at Rossano,\nand annoying as it may be, one cannot severely blame such local\ngentlemen for keeping their collections to themselves. What have they to\ngain from the visits of inquisitive travellers?",
        "During these meditations on my part, the old man hobbled busily to and\nfro with a bucket, bearing water from a fountain near at hand wherewith\nto splash the carriage-wheels. He persisted in this singular occupation\nfor an unreasonably long time. Water was good for the wheels, he\nexplained; it kept them cool.",
        "At last we started, and I began to slumber once more. The carriage\nseemed to be going down a steep incline; endlessly it descended, with a\npleasant swaying motion. . . . Then an icy shiver roused me from my\ndreams. It was the Crati whose rapid waves, fraught with unhealthy\nchills, rippled brightly in the moonlight. We crossed the malarious\nvalley, and once more touched the hills.",
        "From those treeless slopes there streamed forth deliciously warm\nemanations stored up during the scorching hours of noon; the short scrub\nthat clothed them was redolent of that peculiar Calabrian odour which\nhaunts one like a melody–an odour of dried cistus and other aromatic\nplants, balsamic by day, almost overpowering at this hour. To aid and\ndiversify the symphony of perfume, I lit a cigar, and then gave myself\nup to contemplation of the heavenly bodies. We passed a solitary man,\nwalking swiftly with bowed head. What was he doing there?",
        "“Lupomanaro,” said the driver.",
        "A werewolf. . . .",
        "I had always hoped to meet with a werewolf on his nocturnal rambles, and\nnow my wish was gratified. But it was disappointing to see him in human\ngarb–even werewolves, it seems, must march with the times. This\nenigmatical growth of the human mind flourishes in Calabria, but is not\npopular as a subject of conversation. The more old-fashioned werewolves\ncling to the true versipellis habits, and in that case only the pigs,\nthe inane Calabrian pigs, are dowered with the faculty of distinguishing\nthem in daytime, when they look like any other “Christian.” There is a\nrecord, in Fiore’s book, of an epidemic of lycanthropy that attacked the\nboys of Cassano. (Why only the boys?) It began on 31 July, 1210; and the\nseason of the year strikes me as significant.",
        "After that I fell asleep in good earnest, nor did I wake up again till\nthe sun was peering over the eastern hills. We were climbing up a long\nslope; the Albanian settlements of Vaccarizza and San Giorgio lay before\nus and, looking back, I still saw Spezzano on its ridge; it seemed so\nclose that a gunshot could have reached it.",
        "These non-Italian villages date from the centuries that followed the\ndeath of Scanderbeg, when the Grand Signior consolidated his power. The\nrefugees arrived in flocks from over the sea, and were granted tracts of\nwild land whereon to settle–some of them on this incline of the Sila,\nwhich was accordingly called “Greek” Sila, the native confusing these\nforeigners with the Byzantines whose dwellings, as regards Calabria, are\nnow almost exclusively confined to the distant region of Aspromonte.\nColonies of Albanians are scattered all over South Italy, chiefly in\nApulia, Calabria, Basilicata, and Sicily; a few are in the north and\ncentre–there is one on the Po, for instance, now reduced to 200\ninhabitants; most of these latter have become absorbed into the\nsurrounding Italian element. Angelo Masci (reprinted 1846) says there\nare 59 villages of them, containing altogether 83,000 inhabitants–\nexclusive of Sicily; Morelli (1842) gives their total population\nfor Italy and Sicily as 103,466. If these figures are correct,\nthe race must have multiplied latterly, for I am told there are\nnow some 200,000 Albanians in the kingdom, living in about 80 villages.\nThis gives approximately 2500 for each settlement–a likely number, if\nit includes those who are at present emigrants in America. There is a\nvoluminous literature on the subject of these strangers, the authors of\nwhich are nearly all Albanians themselves. The fullest account of older\nconditions may well be that contained in the third volume of Rodota’s\nlearned work (1758); the ponderous Francesco Tajani (1886) brings\naffairs up to date, or nearly so. If only he had provided his book with\nan index!",
        "There were troubles at first. Arriving, as they did, solely “with their\nshirts and rhapsodies” (so one of them described it to me)–that is,\ndespoiled of everything, they indulged in robberies and depredations\nsomewhat too freely even for those free days, with the result that\nferocious edicts were issued against them, and whole clans wiped out. It\nwas a case of necessity knowing no law. But in proportion as the forests\nwere hewn down and crops sown, they became as respectable as their\nhosts. They are bilingual from birth, one might almost say, and numbers\nof the men also express themselves correctly in English, which they pick\nup in the United States.",
        "These islands of alien culture have been hotbeds of Liberalism\nthroughout history. The Bourbons persecuted them savagely on that\naccount, exiling and hanging the people by scores. At this moment there\nis a good deal of excitement going on in favour of the Albanian revolt\nbeyond the Adriatic, and it was proposed, among other things, to\norganize a demonstration in Rome, where certain Roman ladies were to\ndress themselves in Albanian costumes and thus work upon the sentiments\nof the nation; but “the authorities” forbade this and every other\nmovement. None the less, there has been a good deal of clandestine\nrecruiting, and bitter recriminations against this turcophile attitude\non the part of Italy–this “reactionary rigorism against every\nmanifestation of sympathy for the Albanian cause.” Patriotic\npamphleteers ask, rightly enough, why difficulties should be placed in\nthe way of recruiting for Albania, when, in the recent cases of Cuba and\nGreece, the despatch of volunteers was actually encouraged by the\ngovernment? “Legality has ceased to exist here; we Albanians are watched\nand suspected exactly as our compatriots now are by the Turks. . . .\nThey sequestrate our manifestos, they forbid meetings and conferences,\nthey pry into our postal correspondence. . . . Civil and military\nauthorities have conspired to prevent a single voice of help and comfort\nreaching our brothers, who call to us from over the sea.” A hard case,\nindeed. But Vienna and Cettinje might be able to throw some light upon\nit. [Footnote: This was written before the outbreak of the Balkan war.]",
        "The Albanian women, here as elsewhere, are the veriest beasts of burden;\nunlike the Italians, they carry everything (babies, and wood, and water)\non their backs. Their crudely tinted costumes would be called more\nstrange than beautiful under any but a bright sunshiny sky. The fine\nnative dresses of the men have disappeared long ago; they even adopted,\nin days past, the high-peaked Calabrian hat which is now only worn by\nthe older generation. Genuine Calabrians often settle in these foreign\nvillages, in order to profit by their anti-feudal institutions. For even\nnow the Italian cultivator is supposed to make, and actually does make,\n“voluntary” presents to his landlord at certain seasons; gifts which are\nalways a source of irritation and, in bad years, a real hardship. The\nAlbanians opposed themselves from the very beginning against these\nmediaeval practices. “They do not build houses,” says an old writer, “so\nas not to be subject to barons, dukes, princes, or other lords. And if\nthe owner of the land they inhabit ill-treats them, they set fire to\ntheir huts and go elsewhere.” An admirable system, even nowadays.",
        "One would like to be here at Easter time to see the rusalet–those\nPyrrhic dances where the young men group themselves in martial array,\nand pass through the streets with song and chorus, since, soon enough,\nAmerica will have put an end to such customs. The old Albanian guitar of\nnine strings has already died out, and the double tibia–biforem dat\ntibia cantum–will presently follow suit. This instrument, familiar\nfrom classical sculpture and lore, and still used in Sicily and\nSardinia, was once a favourite with the Sila shepherds, who called it\n“fischietto a pariglia.” But some years ago I vainly sought it in the\ncentral Sila; the answer to my enquiries was everywhere the same: they\nknew it quite well; so and so used to play it; certain persons in\ncertain villages still made it–they described it accurately enough, but\ncould not produce a specimen. Single pipes, yes; and bagpipes galore;\nbut the tibia: pares were “out of fashion” wherever I asked for them.",
        "Here, in the Greek Sila, I was more fortunate. A boy at the village of\nMacchia possessed a pair which he obligingly gave me, after first\nplaying a song–a farewell song–a plaintive ditty that required, none\nthe less, an excellent pair of lungs, on account of the two mouthpieces.\nMelodies on this double flageolet are played principally at Christmas\ntime. The two reeds are about twenty-five centimetres in length, and\nmade of hollow cane; in my specimen, the left hand controls four, the\nother six holes; the Albanian name of the instrument is “fiscarol.”",
        "From a gentleman at Vaccarizza I received a still more valuable\npresent–two neolithic celts (aenolithic, I should be inclined to call\nthem) wrought in close-grained quartzite, and found not far from that\nvillage. These implements must be rare in the uplands of Calabria, as I\nhave never come across them before, though they have been found, to my\nknowledge, at Savelli in the central Sila. At Vaccarizza they call such\nrelics “pic\"–they are supposed, as usual, to be thunderbolts, and I am\nalso told that a piece of string tied to one of them cannot be burnt in\nfire. The experiment might be worth trying.",
        "Meanwhile, the day passed pleasantly at Vaccarizza. I became the guest\nof a prosperous resident, and was treated to genuine Albanian\nhospitality and excellent cheer. I only wish that all his compatriots\nmight enjoy one meal of this kind in their lifetime. For they are poor,\nand their homes of miserable aspect. Like all too many villages in South\nItaly, this one is depopulated of its male inhabitants, and otherwise\ndirty and neglected. The impression one gains on first seeing one of\nthese places is more than that of Oriental decay; they are not merely\nragged at the edges. It is a deliberate and sinister chaos, a note of\ndownright anarchy–a contempt for those simple forms of refinement which\neven the poorest can afford. Such persons, one thinks, cannot have much\nsense of home and its hallowed associations; they seem to be\neverlastingly ready to break with the existing state of things. How\ndifferent from England, where the humblest cottages, the roadways, the\nvery stones testify to immemorial love of order, to neighbourly feelings\nand usages sanctioned by time!",
        "They lack the sense of home as a fixed and old-established topographical\npoint; as do the Arabs and Russians, neither of whom have a word\nexpressing our “home” or “Heimat.” Here, the nearest equivalent is la\nfamiglia. We think of a particular house or village where we were born\nand where we spent our impressionable days of childhood; these others\nregard home not as a geographical but as a social centre, liable to\nshift from place to place; they are at home everywhere, so long as their\nclan is about them. That acquisitive sense which affectionately adorns\nour meanest dwelling, slowly saturating it with memories, has been\ncrushed out of them–if it ever existed–by hard blows of fortune; it is\nsafer, they think, to transform the labour of their hands into gold,\nwhich can be moved from place to place or hidden from the tyrant’s eye.\nThey have none of our sentimentality in regard to inanimate objects.\nEliza Cook’s feelings towards her “old arm-chair” would strike them as\nsavouring of childishness. Hence the unfinished look of their houses,\nwithin and without. Why expend thought and wealth upon that which may be\nabandoned to-morrow?",
        "The two churches of Vaccarizza, dark and unclean structures, stand side\nby side, and I was shown through them by their respective priests, Greek\nand Catholic, who walked arm in arm in friendly wise, and meekly smiled\nat a running fire of sarcastic observations on the part of another\ncitizen directed against the “bottega” in general–the shop, as the\nchurch is sometimes irreverently called. The Greco-Catholic cult to\nwhich these Albanians belong is a compromise between the Orthodox and\nRoman; their priests may wear beards and marry wives, they use bread\ninstead of the wafer for sacramental purposes, and there are one or two\nother little differences of grave import.",
        "Six Albanian settlements lie on these northern slopes of the Sila–San\nGiorgio, Vaccarizza, San Cosimo, Macchia, San Demetrio Corone, and Santa\nSofia d’ Epiro. San Demetrio is the largest of them, and thither, after\nan undisturbed night’s rest at the house of my kind host–the last, I\nfear, for many days to come–I drove in the sunlit hours of next\nmorning. Along the road one can see how thoroughly the Albanians have\ndone their work; the land is all under cultivation, save for a dark belt\nof trees overhead, to remind one of what once it was. Perhaps they have\neradicated the forest over-zealously, for I observe in San Demetrio that\nthe best drinking water has now to be fetched from a spring at a\nconsiderable distance from the village; it is unlikely that this should\nhave been the original condition of affairs; deforestation has probably\ndiminished the water-supply.",
        "It was exhilarating to traverse these middle heights with their aerial\nviews over the Ionian and down olive-covered hill-sides towards the wide\nvalley of the Crati and the lofty Pollino range, now swimming in\nmidsummer haze. The road winds in and out of gullies where rivulets\ndescend from the mountains; they are clothed in cork-oak, ilex, and\nother trees; golden orioles, jays, hoopoes and rollers flash among the\nfoliage. In winter these hills are swept by boreal blasts from the\nApennines, but at this season it is a delightful tract of land.",
