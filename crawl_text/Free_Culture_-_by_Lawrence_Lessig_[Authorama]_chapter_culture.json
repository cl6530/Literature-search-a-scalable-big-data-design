        "At the end of his review of my first book, Code: And Other Laws of Cyberspace, \nDavid Pogue, a brilliant writer and author of countless technical and computer-\nrelated texts, wrote this:",
        "Unlike actual law, Internet software has no capacity to punish. It doesn’t \naffect people who aren’t online (and only a tiny minority of the world \npopulation is). And if you don’t like the Internet’s system, you can always flip \noff the modem. [1]",
        "Pogue was skeptical of the core argument of the bookthat software, or code, \nfunctioned as a kind of lawand his review suggested the happy thought that if \nlife in cyberspace got bad, we could always drizzle, drazzle, druzzle, drome-\nlike simply flip a switch and be back home. Turn off the modem, unplug the \ncomputer, and any troubles that exist in that space wouldn’t affect us \nanymore.",
        "Pogue might have been right in 1999I’m skeptical, but maybe. But even if he was \nright then, the point is not right now: Free Culture is about the troubles the \nInternet causes even after the modem is turned off. It is an argument about how \nthe battles that now rage regarding life on-line have fundamentally affected \npeople who aren’t online. There is no switch that will insulate us from the \nInternet’s effect.",
        "But unlike Code, the argument here is not much about the Internet itself. It \nis instead about the consequence of the Internet to a part of our tradition that \nis much more fundamental, and, as hard as this is for a geek-wanna-be to admit, \nmuch more important.",
        "That tradition is the way our culture gets made. As I explain in the pages that \nfollow, we come from a tradition of free culturenot free as in free beer \n(to borrow a phrase from the founder of the free-software movement [2]), but \nfree as in free speech, free markets, free trade, free enterprise, \nfree will, and free elections. A free culture supports and protects creators \nand innovators. It does this directly by granting intellectual property rights. \nBut it does so indirectly by limiting the reach of those rights, to guarantee \nthat follow-on creators and innovators remain as free as possible from the \ncontrol of the past. A free culture is not a culture without property, just as a \nfree market is not a market in which everything is free. The opposite of a free \nculture is a permission culturea culture in which creators get to create only \nwith the permission of the powerful, or of creators from the past.",
        "If we understood this change, I believe we would resist it. Not we on the Left \nor you on the Right, but we who have no stake in the particular industries of \nculture that defined the twentieth century. Whether you are on the Left or the \nRight, if you are in this sense disinterested, then the story I tell here will \ntrouble you. For the changes I describe affect values that both sides of our \npolitical culture deem fundamental.",
        "We saw a glimpse of this bipartisan outrage in the early summer of 2003. As the \nFCC considered changes in media ownership rules that would relax limits on media \nconcentration, an extraordinary coalition generated more than 700,000 letters to \nthe FCC opposing the change. As William Safire described marching uncomfortably \nalongside CodePink Women for Peace and the National Rifle Association, between \nliberal Olympia Snowe and conservative Ted Stevens, he formulated perhaps most \nsimply just what was at stake: the concentration of power. And as he asked,",
        "Does that sound unconservative? Not to me. The concentration of power\npolitical, corporate, media, culturalshould be anathema to conservatives. The \ndiffusion of power through local control, thereby encouraging individual \nparticipation, is the essence of federalism and the greatest expression of \ndemocracy. [3]",
        "This idea is an element of the argument of Free Culture, though my focus is \nnot just on the concentration of power produced by concentrations in ownership, \nbut more importantly, if because less visibly, on the concentration of power \nproduced by a radical change in the effective scope of the law. The law is \nchanging; that change is altering the way our culture gets made; that change \nshould worry youwhether or not you care about the Internet, and whether you’re \non Safire’s left or on his right. ",
        "The inspiration for the title and for much of the argument of this book comes \nfrom the work of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation. Indeed, as I \nreread Stallman’s own work, especially the essays in Free Software, Free \nSociety, I realize that all of the theoretical insights I develop here are \ninsights Stallman described decades ago. One could thus well argue that this \nwork is merely derivative. ",
        "I accept that criticism, if indeed it is a criticism. The work of a lawyer is \nalways derivative, and I mean to do nothing more in this book than to remind a \nculture about a tradition that has always been its own. Like Stallman, I defend \nthat tradition on the basis of values. Like Stallman, I believe those are the \nvalues of freedom. And like Stallman, I believe those are values of our past \nthat will need to be defended in our future. A free culture has been our past, \nbut it will only be our future if we change the path we are on right now. ",
        "Like Stallman’s arguments for free software, an argument for free culture \nstumbles on a confusion that is hard to avoid, and even harder to understand. A \nfree culture is not a culture without property; it is not a culture in which \nartists don’t get paid. A culture without property, or in which creators can’t \nget paid, is anarchy, not freedom. Anarchy is not what I advance here. ",
        "Instead, the free culture that I defend in this book is a balance between \nanarchy and control. A free culture, like a free market, is filled with \nproperty. It is filled with rules of property and contract that get enforced by \nthe state. But just as a free market is perverted if its property becomes \nfeudal, so too can a free culture be queered by extremism in the property rights \nthat define it. That is what I fear about our culture today. It is against that \nextremism that this book is written. ",
        "On December 17,1903, on a windy North Carolina beach for just shy of one hundred \nseconds, the Wright brothers demonstrated that a heavier-than-air, self-\npropelled vehicle could fly. The moment was electric and its importance widely \nunderstood. Almost immediately, there was an explosion of interest in this \nnewfound technology of manned flight, and a gaggle of innovators began to build \nupon it.",
        "At the time the Wright brothers invented the airplane, American law held that a \nproperty owner presumptively owned not just the surface of his land, but all the \nland below, down to the center of the earth, and all the space above, to an \nindefinite extent, upwards. [1] For many years, scholars had puzzled about how \nbest to interpret the idea that rights in land ran to the heavens. Did that mean \nthat you owned the stars? Could you prosecute geese for their willful and \nregular trespass?",
        "Then came airplanes, and for the first time, this principle of American lawdeep \nwithin the foundations of our tradition, and acknowledged by the most important \nlegal thinkers of our pastmattered. If my land reaches to the heavens, what \nhappens when United flies over my field? Do I have the right to banish it from \nmy property? Am I allowed to enter into an exclusive license with Delta \nAirlines? Could we set up an auction to decide how much these rights are worth?",
        "In 1945, these questions became a federal case. When North Carolina farmers \nThomas Lee and Tinie Causby started losing chickens because of low-flying \nmilitary aircraft (the terrified chickens apparently flew into the barn walls \nand died), the Causbys filed a lawsuit saying that the government was \ntrespassing on their land. The airplanes, of course, never touched the surface \nof the Causbys’ land. But if, as Blackstone, Kent, and Coke had said, their land \nreached to an indefinite extent, upwards, then the government was trespassing \non their property, and the Causbys wanted it to stop.",
        "The Supreme Court agreed to hear the Causbys’ case. Congress had declared the \nairways public, but if one’s property really extended to the heavens, then \nCongress’s declaration could well have been an unconstitutional taking of \nproperty without compensation. The Court acknowledged that it is ancient \ndoctrine that common law ownership of the land extended to the periphery of the \nuniverse. But Justice Douglas had no patience for ancient doctrine. In a single \nparagraph, hundreds of years of property law were erased. As he wrote for the \nCourt,",
        "[The] doctrine has no place in the modern world. The air is a public highway, \nas Congress has declared. Were that not true, every transcontinental flight \nwould subject the operator to countless trespass suits. Common sense revolts at \nthe idea. To recognize such private claims to the airspace would clog these \nhighways, seriously interfere with their control and development in the public \ninterest, and transfer into private ownership that to which only the public has \na just claim. [2]",
        "Common sense revolts at the idea.",
        "This is how the law usually works. Not often this abruptly or impatiently, but \neventually, this is how it works. It was Douglas’s style not to dither. Other \njustices would have blathered on for pages to reach the conclusion that Douglas \nholds in a single line: Common sense revolts at the idea. But whether it takes \npages or a few words, it is the special genius of a common law system, as ours \nis, that the law adjusts to the technologies of the time. And as it adjusts, it \nchanges. Ideas that were as solid as rock in one age crumble in another.",
        "Or at least, this is how things happen when there’s no one powerful on the other \nside of the change. The Causbys were just farmers. And though there were no \ndoubt many like them who were upset by the growing traffic in the air (though \none hopes not many chickens flew themselves into walls), the Causbys of the \nworld would find it very hard to unite and stop the idea, and the technology, \nthat the Wright brothers had birthed. The Wright brothers spat airplanes into \nthe technological meme pool; the idea then spread like a virus in a chicken \ncoop; farmers like the Causbys found themselves surrounded by what seemed \nreasonable given the technology that the Wrights had produced. They could stand \non their farms, dead chickens in hand, and shake their fists at these newfangled \ntechnologies all they wanted. They could call their representatives or even file \na lawsuit. But in the end, the force of what seems obvious to everyone else\nthe power of common sensewould prevail. Their private interest would not be \nallowed to defeat an obvious public gain.",
        "Edwin Howard Armstrong is one of America’s forgotten inventor geniuses. He came \nto the great American inventor scene just after the titans Thomas Edison and \nAlexander Graham Bell. But his work in the area of radio technology was perhaps \nthe most important of any single inventor in the first fifty years of radio. He \nwas better educated than Michael Faraday, who as a bookbinder’s apprentice had \ndiscovered electric induction in 1831. But he had the same intuition about how \nthe world of radio worked, and on at least three occasions, Armstrong invented \nprofoundly important technologies that advanced our understanding of radio.",
        "On the day after Christmas, 1933, four patents were issued to Armstrong for his \nmost significant inventionFM radio. Until then, consumer radio had been \namplitude-modulated (AM) radio. The theorists of the day had said that \nfrequency-modulated (FM) radio could never work. They were right about FM radio \nin a narrow band of spectrum. But Armstrong discovered that frequency-modulated \nradio in a wide band of spectrum would deliver an astonishing fidelity of sound, \nwith much less transmitter power and static.",
        "On November 5, 1935, he demonstrated the technology at a meeting of the \nInstitute of Radio Engineers at the Empire State Building in New York City. He \ntuned his radio dial across a range of AM stations, until the radio locked on a \nbroadcast that he had arranged from seventeen miles away. The radio fell totally \nsilent, as if dead, and then with a clarity no one else in that room had ever \nheard from an electrical device, it produced the sound of an announcer’s voice: \nThis is amateur station W2AG at Yonkers, New York, operating on frequency \nmodulation at two and a half meters.",
        "The audience was hearing something no one had thought possible:",
        "A glass of water was poured before the microphone in Yonkers; it sounded like a \nglass of water being poured. ... A paper was crumpled and torn; it sounded like \npaper and not like a crackling forest fire. ... Sousa marches were played from \nrecords and a piano solo and guitar number were performed. ... The music was \nprojected with a live-ness rarely if ever heard before from a radio music box. \n [3] ",
        "As our own common sense tells us, Armstrong had discovered a vastly superior \nradio technology. But at the time of his invention, Armstrong was working for \nRCA. RCA was the dominant player in the then dominant AM radio market. By 1935, \nthere were a thousand radio stations across the United States, but the stations \nin large cities were all owned by a handful of networks.",
        "RCA’s president, David Sarnoff, a friend of Armstrong’s, was eager that \nArmstrong discover a way to remove static from AM radio. So Sarnoff was quite \nexcited when Armstrong told him he had a device that removed static from \nradio. But when Armstrong demonstrated his invention, Sarnoff was not pleased.",
        "I thought Armstrong would invent some kind of a filter to remove static from \nour AM radio. I didn’t think he’d start a revolutionstart up a whole damn new \nindustry to compete with RCA. [4]",
        "Armstrong’s invention threatened RCA’s AM empire, so the company launched a \ncampaign to smother FM radio. While FM may have been a superior technology, \nSarnoff was a superior tactician. As one author described,",
        "The forces for FM, largely engineering, could not overcome the weight of \nstrategy devised by the sales, patent, and legal offices to subdue this threat \nto corporate position. For FM, if allowed to develop unrestrained, posed ... a \ncomplete reordering of radio power ... and the eventual overthrow of the \ncarefully restricted AM system on which RCA had grown to power. [5]",
        "RCA at first kept the technology in house, insisting that further tests were \nneeded. When, after two years of testing, Armstrong grew impatient, RCA began to \nuse its power with the government to stall FM radio’s deployment generally. In \n1936, RCA hired the former head of the FCC and assigned him the task of assuring \nthat the FCC assign spectrum in a way that would castrate FMprincipally by \nmoving FM radio to a different band of spectrum. At first, these efforts failed. \nBut when Armstrong and the nation were distracted by World War II, RCA’s work \nbegan to be more successful. Soon after the war ended, the FCC announced a set \nof policies that would have one clear effect: FM radio would be crippled. As \nLawrence Lessing described it,",
        "The series of body blows that FM radio received right after the war, in a \nseries of rulings manipulated through the FCC by the big radio interests, were \nalmost incredible in their force and deviousness. [6]",
        "To make room in the spectrum for RCA’s latest gamble, television, FM radio users \nwere to be moved to a totally new spectrum band. The power of FM radio stations \nwas also cut, meaning FM could no longer be used to beam programs from one part \nof the country to another. (This change was strongly supported by AT&T, because \nthe loss of FM relaying stations would mean radio stations would have to buy \nwired links from AT&T.) The spread of FM radio was thus choked, at least \ntemporarily. ",
        "Armstrong resisted RCA’s efforts. In response, RCA resisted Armstrong’s patents. \nAfter incorporating FM technology into the emerging standard for television, RCA \ndeclared the patents invalidbaselessly, and almost fifteen years after they \nwere issued. It thus refused to pay him royalties. For six years, Armstrong \nfought an expensive war of litigation to defend the patents. Finally, just as \nthe patents expired, RCA offered a settlement so low that it would not even \ncover Armstrong’s lawyers’ fees. Defeated, broken, and now broke, in 1954 \nArmstrong wrote a short note to his wife and then stepped out of a thirteenth-\nstory window to his death.",
        "This is how the law sometimes works. Not often this tragically, and rarely with \nheroic drama, but sometimes, this is how it works. From the beginning, \ngovernment and government agencies have been subject to capture. They are more \nlikely captured when a powerful interest is threatened by either a legal or \ntechnical change. That powerful interest too often exerts its influence within \nthe government to get the government to protect it. The rhetoric of this \nprotection is of course always public spirited; the reality is something \ndifferent. Ideas that were as solid as rock in one age, but that, left to \nthemselves, would crumble in another, are sustained through this subtle \ncorruption of our political process. RCA had what the Causbys did not: the power \nto stifle the effect of technological change.",
        "There’s no single inventor of the Internet. Nor is there any good date upon \nwhich to mark its birth. Yet in a very short time, the Internet has become part \nof ordinary American life. According to the Pew Internet and American Life \nProject, 58 percent of Americans had access to the Internet in 2002, up from 49 \npercent two years before. [7] That number could well exceed two thirds of the \nnation by the end of 2004.",
        "As the Internet has been integrated into ordinary life, it has changed things. \nSome of these changes are technicalthe Internet has made communication faster, \nit has lowered the cost of gathering data, and so on. These technical changes \nare not the focus of this book. They are important. They are not well \nunderstood. But they are the sort of thing that would simply go away if we all \njust switched the Internet off. They don’t affect people who don’t use the \nInternet, or at least they don’t affect them directly. They are the proper \nsubject of a book about the Internet. But this is not a book about the Internet.",
        "Instead, this book is about an effect of the Internet beyond the Internet \nitself: an effect upon how culture is made. My claim is that the Internet has \ninduced an important and unrecognized change in that process. That change will \nradically transform a tradition that is as old as the Republic itself. Most, if \nthey recognized this change, would reject it. Yet most don’t even see the change \nthat the Internet has introduced.",
        "We can glimpse a sense of this change by distinguishing between commercial and \nnoncommercial culture, and by mapping the law’s regulation of each. By \ncommercial culture I mean that part of our culture that is produced and sold \nor produced to be sold. By noncommercial culture I mean all the rest. When old \nmen sat around parks or on street corners telling stories that kids and others \nconsumed, that was noncommercial culture. When Noah Webster published his \nReader, or Joel Barlow his poetry, that was commercial culture.",
        "At the beginning of our history, and for just about the whole of our tradition, \nnoncommercial culture was essentially unregulated. Of course, if your stories \nwere lewd, or if your song disturbed the peace, then the law might intervene. \nBut the law was never directly concerned with the creation or spread of this \nform of culture, and it left this culture free. The ordinary ways in which \nordinary individuals shared and transformed their culturetelling stories, \nreenacting scenes from plays or TV, participating in fan clubs, sharing music, \nmaking tapeswere left alone by the law.",
        "The focus of the law was on commercial creativity. At first slightly, then quite \nextensively, the law protected the incentives of creators by granting them \nexclusive rights to their creative work, so that they could sell those exclusive \nrights in a commercial marketplace. [8] This is also, of course, an important \npart of creativity and culture, and it has become an increasingly important part \nin America. But in no sense was it dominant within our tradition. It was instead \njust one part, a controlled part, balanced with the free.",
        "This rough divide between the free and the controlled has now been erased. [9] \nThe Internet has set the stage for this erasure and, pushed by big media, the \nlaw has now affected it. For the first time in our tradition, the ordinary ways \nin which individuals create and share culture fall within the reach of the \nregulation of the law, which has expanded to draw within its control a vast \namount of culture and creativity that it never reached before. The technology \nthat preserved the balance of our historybetween uses of our culture that were \nfree and uses of our culture that were only upon permissionhas been undone. The \nconsequence is that we are less and less a free culture, more and more a \npermission culture. ",
        "This change gets justified as necessary to protect commercial creativity. And \nindeed, protectionism is precisely its motivation. But the protectionism that \njustifies the changes that I will describe below is not the limited and balanced \nsort that has defined the law in the past. This is not a protectionism to \nprotect artists. It is instead a protectionism to protect certain forms of \nbusiness. Corporations threatened by the potential of the Internet to change the \nway both commercial and noncommercial culture are made and shared have united to \ninduce lawmakers to use the law to protect them. It is the story of RCA and \nArmstrong; it is the dream of the Causbys.",
        "For the Internet has unleashed an extraordinary possibility for many to \nparticipate in the process of building and cultivating a culture that reaches \nfar beyond local boundaries. That power has changed the marketplace for making \nand cultivating culture generally, and that change in turn threatens established \ncontent industries. The Internet is thus to the industries that built and \ndistributed content in the twentieth century what FM radio was to AM radio, or \nwhat the truck was to the railroad industry of the nineteenth century: the \nbeginning of the end, or at least a substantial transformation. Digital \ntechnologies, tied to the Internet, could produce a vastly more competitive and \nvibrant market for building and cultivating culture; that market could include a \nmuch wider and more diverse range of creators; those creators could produce and \ndistribute a much more vibrant range of creativity; and depending upon a few \nimportant factors, those creators could earn more on average from this system \nthan creators do todayall so long as the RCAs of our day don’t use the law to \nprotect themselves against this competition.",
        "Yet, as I argue in the pages that follow, that is precisely what is happening in \nour culture today. These modern-day equivalents of the early twentieth-century \nradio or nineteenth-century railroads are using their power to get the law to \nprotect them against this new, more efficient, more vibrant technology for \nbuilding culture. They are succeeding in their plan to remake the Internet \nbefore the Internet remakes them.",
        "It doesn’t seem this way to many. The battles over copyright and the Internet \nseem remote to most. To the few who follow them, they seem mainly about a much \nsimpler brace of questionswhether piracy will be permitted, and whether \nproperty will be protected. The war that has been waged against the \ntechnologies of the Internetwhat Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) \npresident Jack Valenti calls his own terrorist war [10]has been framed as a \nbattle about the rule of law and respect for property. To know which side to \ntake in this war, most think that we need only decide whether we’re for property \nor against it.",
        "If those really were the choices, then I would be with Jack Valenti and the \ncontent industry. I, too, am a believer in property, and especially in the \nimportance of what Mr. Valenti nicely calls creative property. I believe that \npiracy is wrong, and that the law, properly tuned, should punish piracy, \nwhether on or off the Internet.",
        "But those simple beliefs mask a much more fundamental question and a much more \ndramatic change. My fear is that unless we come to see this change, the war to \nrid the world of Internet pirates will also rid our culture of values that \nhave been integral to our tradition from the start.",
        "These values built a tradition that, for at least the first 180 years of our \nRepublic, guaranteed creators the right to build freely upon their past, and \nprotected creators and innovators from either state or private control. The \nFirst Amendment protected creators against state control. And as Professor Neil \nNetanel powerfully argues, [11] copyright law, properly balanced, protected \ncreators against private control. Our tradition was thus neither Soviet nor the \ntradition of patrons. It instead carved out a wide berth within which creators \ncould cultivate and extend our culture.",
        "Yet the law’s response to the Internet, when tied to changes in the technology \nof the Internet itself, has massively increased the effective regulation of \ncreativity in America. To build upon or critique the culture around us one must \nask, Oliver Twistlike, for permission first. Permission is, of course, often \ngrantedbut it is not often granted to the critical or the independent. We have \nbuilt a kind of cultural nobility; those within the noble class live easily; \nthose outside it don’t. But it is nobility of any form that is alien to our \ntradition. ",
        "The story that follows is about this war. Is it not about the centrality of \ntechnology to ordinary life. I don’t believe in gods, digital or otherwise. Nor \nis it an effort to demonize any individual or group, for neither do I believe in \na devil, corporate or otherwise. It is not a morality tale. Nor is it a call to \njihad against an industry. ",
        "It is instead an effort to understand a hopelessly destructive war inspired by \nthe technologies of the Internet but reaching far beyond its code. And by \nunderstanding this battle, it is an effort to map peace. There is no good reason \nfor the current struggle around Internet technologies to continue. There will be \ngreat harm to our tradition and culture if it is allowed to continue unchecked. \nWe must come to understand the source of this war. We must resolve it soon.",
        "Like the Causbys’ battle, this war is, in part, about property. The property \nof this war is not as tangible as the Causbys’, and no innocent chicken has yet \nto lose its life. Yet the ideas surrounding this property are as obvious to \nmost as the Causbys’ claim about the sacredness of their farm was to them. We \nare the Causbys. Most of us take for granted the extraordinarily powerful claims \nthat the owners of intellectual property now assert. Most of us, like the \nCausbys, treat these claims as obvious. And hence we, like the Causbys, object \nwhen a new technology interferes with this property. It is as plain to us as it \nwas to them that the new technologies of the Internet are trespassing upon \nlegitimate claims of property. It is as plain to us as it was to them that the \nlaw should intervene to stop this trespass.",
        "And thus, when geeks and technologists defend their Armstrong or Wright brothers \ntechnology, most of us are simply unsympathetic. Common sense does not revolt. \nUnlike in the case of the unlucky Causbys, common sense is on the side of the \nproperty owners in this war. Unlike the lucky Wright brothers, the Internet has \nnot inspired a revolution on its side. ",
        "My hope is to push this common sense along. I have become increasingly amazed by \nthe power of this idea of intellectual property and, more importantly, its power \nto disable critical thought by policy makers and citizens. There has never been \na time in our history when more of our culture was as owned as it is now. \nAnd yet there has never been a time when the concentration of power to control \nthe uses of culture has been as unquestioningly accepted as it is now. ",
        "The puzzle is, Why?",
        "Is it because we have come to understand a truth about the value and importance \nof absolute property over ideas and culture? Is it because we have discovered \nthat our tradition of rejecting such an absolute claim was wrong?",
        "Or is it because the idea of absolute property over ideas and culture \nbenefits the RCAs of our time and fits our own unreflective intuitions?",
        "Is the radical shift away from our tradition of free culture an instance of \nAmerica correcting a mistake from its past, as we did after a bloody war with \nslavery, and as we are slowly doing with inequality? Or is the radical shift \naway from our tradition of free culture yet another example of a political \nsystem captured by a few powerful special interests?",
        "Does common sense lead to the extremes on this question because common sense \nactually believes in these extremes? Or does common sense stand silent in the \nface of these extremes because, as with Armstrong versus RCA, the more powerful \nside has ensured that it has the more powerful view?",
        "I don’t mean to be mysterious. My own views are resolved. I believe it was right \nfor common sense to revolt against the extremism of the Causbys. I believe it \nwould be right for common sense to revolt against the extreme claims made today \non behalf of intellectual property. What the law demands today is increasingly \nas silly as a sheriff arresting an airplane for trespass. But the consequences \nof this silliness will be much more profound. ",
        "The struggle that rages just now centers on two ideas: piracy and property. \nMy aim in this book’s next two parts is to explore these two ideas.",
        "My method is not the usual method of an academic. I don’t want to plunge you \ninto a complex argument, buttressed with references to obscure French theorists\nhowever natural that is for the weird sort we academics have become. Instead I \nbegin in each part with a collection of stories that set a context within which \nthese apparently simple ideas can be more fully understood.",
        "The two sections set up the core claim of this book: that while the Internet has \nindeed produced something fantastic and new, our government, pushed by big media \nto respond to this something new, is destroying something very old. Rather \nthan understanding the changes the Internet might permit, and rather than taking \ntime to let common sense resolve how best to respond, we are allowing those \nmost threatened by the changes to use their power to change the lawand more \nimportantly, to use their power to change something fundamental about who we \nhave always been.",
        "We allow this, I believe, not because it is right, and not because most of us \nreally believe in these changes. We allow it because the interests most \nthreatened are among the most powerful players in our depressingly compromised \nprocess of making law. This book is the story of one more consequence of this \nform of corruptiona consequence to which most of us remain oblivious.",
        "Since the inception of the law regulating creative property, there has been a \nwar against piracy. The precise contours of this concept, piracy, are hard \nto sketch, but the animating injustice is easy to capture. As Lord Mansfield \nwrote in a case that extended the reach of English copyright law to include \nsheet music,",
        "A person may use the copy by playing it, but he has no right to rob the author \nof the profit, by multiplying copies and disposing of them for his own use. [1]",
        "Today we are in the middle of another war against piracy. The Internet has \nprovoked this war. The Internet makes possible the efficient spread of content. \nPeer-to-peer (p2p) file sharing is among the most efficient of the efficient \ntechnologies the Internet enables. Using distributed intelligence, p2p systems \nfacilitate the easy spread of content in a way unimagined a generation ago. ",
        "This efficiency does not respect the traditional lines of copyright. The network \ndoesn’t discriminate between the sharing of copyrighted and uncopyrighted \ncontent. Thus has there been a vast amount of sharing of copyrighted content. \nThat sharing in turn has excited the war, as copyright owners fear the sharing \nwill rob the author of the profit.",
        "The warriors have turned to the courts, to the legislatures, and increasingly \nto technology to defend their property against this piracy. \nA generation of Americans, the warriors warn, is being raised to believe \nthat property should be free. Forget tattoos, never mind body \npiercingour kids are becoming thieves!",
        "There’s no doubt that piracy is wrong, and that pirates should be punished. \nBut before we summon the executioners, we should put this notion of piracy in \nsome context. For as the concept is increasingly used, at its core is an \nextraordinary idea that is almost certainly wrong.",
        "The idea goes something like this:",
        "Creative work has value; whenever I use, or take, or build upon the creative \nwork of others, I am taking from them something of value. Whenever I take \nsomething of value from someone else, I should have their permission. The taking \nof something of value from someone else without permission is wrong. It is a \nform of piracy.",
        "This view runs deep within the current debates. It is what NYU law professor \nRochelle Dreyfuss criticizes as the if value, then right theory of creative \nproperty [2]if there is value, then someone must have a right to that value. It \nis the perspective that led a composers’ rights organization, ASCAP, to sue the \nGirl Scouts for failing to pay for the songs that girls sang around Girl Scout \ncampfires. [3] There was value (the songs) so there must have been a right\neven against the Girl Scouts.",
        "This idea is certainly a possible understanding of how creative poperty should \nwork. It might well be a possible design for a system of law protecting creative \nproperty. But the if value, then right theory of creative property has never \nbeen America’s theory of creative property. It has never taken hold within our \nlaw. ",
        "Instead, in our tradition, intellectual property is an instrument. It sets the \ngroundwork for a richly creative society but remains subservient to the value of \ncreativity. The current debate has this turned around. We have become so \nconcerned with protecting the instrument that we are losing sight of the value.",
        "The source of this confusion is a distinction that the law no longer takes care \nto drawthe distinction between republishing someone’s work on the one hand and \nbuilding upon or transforming that work on the other. Copyright law at its birth \nhad only publishing as its concern; copyright law today regulates both.",
        "Before the technologies of the Internet, this conflation didn’t matter all that \nmuch. The technologies of publishing were expensive; that meant the vast \nmajority of publishing was commercial. Commercial entities could bear the burden \nof the laweven the burden of the Byzantine complexity that copyright law has \nbecome. It was just one more expense of doing business.",
        "But with the birth of the Internet, this natural limit to the reach of the law \nhas disappeared. The law controls not just the creativity of commercial creators \nbut effectively that of anyone. Although that expansion would not matter much if \ncopyright law regulated only copying, when the law regulates as broadly and \nobscurely as it does, the extension matters a lot. The burden of this law now \nvastly outweighs any original benefitcertainly as it affects noncommercial \ncreativity, and increasingly as it affects commercial creativity as well. Thus, \nas we’ll see more clearly in the chapters below, the law’s role is less and less \nto support creativity, and more and more to protect certain industries against \ncompetition. Just at the time digital technology could unleash an extraordinary \nrange of commercial and noncommercial creativity, the law burdens this \ncreativity with insanely complex and vague rules and with the threat of \nobscenely severe penalties. We may be seeing, as Richard Florida writes, the \nRise of the Creative Class. [4] Unfortunately, we are also seeing an \nextraordinary rise of regulation of this creative class.",
        "These burdens make no sense in our tradition. We should begin by understanding \nthat tradition a bit more and by placing in their proper context the current \nbattles about behavior labeled piracy.",
        "In 1928, a cartoon character was born. An early Mickey Mouse made his debut in \nMay of that year, in a silent flop called Plane Crazy. In November, in New \nYork City’s Colony Theater, in the first widely distributed cartoon synchronized \nwith sound, Steamboat Willie brought to life the character that would become \nMickey Mouse.",
        "Synchronized sound had been introduced to film a year earlier in the movie The \nJazz Singer. That success led Walt Disney to copy the technique and mix sound \nwith cartoons. No one knew whether it would work or, if it did work, whether it \nwould win an audience. But when Disney ran a test in the summer of 1928, the \nresults were unambiguous. As Disney describes that first experiment,",
        "A couple of my boys could read music, and one of them could play a mouth organ. \nWe put them in a room where they could not see the screen and arranged to pipe \ntheir sound into the room where our wives and friends were going to see the \npicture. ",
        "The boys worked from a music and sound-effects score. After several false \nstarts, sound and action got off with the gun. The mouth organist played the \ntune, the rest of us in the sound department bammed tin pans and blew slide \nwhistles on the beat. The synchronization was pretty close. ",
        "The effect on our little audience was nothing less than electric. They \nresponded almost instinctively to this union of sound and motion. I thought they \nwere kidding me. So they put me in the audience and ran the action again. It was \nterrible, but it was wonderful! And it was something new! [1]",
        "Disney’s then partner, and one of animation’s most extraordinary talents, Ub \nIwerks, put it more strongly: I have never been so thrilled in my life. Nothing \nsince has ever equaled it.",
        "Disney had created something very new, based upon something relatively new. \nSynchronized sound brought life to a form of creativity that had rarelyexcept \nin Disney’s handsbeen anything more than filler for other films. Throughout \nanimation’s early history, it was Disney’s invention that set the standard that \nothers struggled to match. And quite often, Disney’s great genius, his spark of \ncreativity, was built upon the work of others.",
        "This much is familiar. What you might not know is that 1928 also marks another \nimportant transition. In that year, a comic (as opposed to cartoon) genius \ncreated his last independently produced silent film. That genius was Buster \nKeaton. The film was Steamboat Bill, Jr.",
        "Keaton was born into a vaudeville family in 1895. In the era of silent film, he \nhad mastered using broad physical comedy as a way to spark uncontrollable \nlaughter from his audience. Steamboat Bill, Jr. was a classic of this form, \nfamous among film buffs for its incredible stunts. The film was classic Keaton\nwildly popular and among the best of its genre. ",
        "Steamboat Bill, Jr. appeared before Disney’s cartoon Steamboat Willie. The \ncoincidence of titles is not coincidental. Steamboat Willie is a direct cartoon \nparody of Steamboat Bill, [2] and both are built upon a common song as a source. \nIt is not just from the invention of synchronized sound in The Jazz Singer \nthat we get Steamboat Willie. It is also from Buster Keaton’s invention of \nSteamboat Bill, Jr., itself inspired by the song Steamboat Bill, that we get \nSteamboat Willie, and then from Steamboat Willie, Mickey Mouse.",
        "This borrowing was nothing unique, either for Disney or for the industry. \nDisney was always parroting the feature-length mainstream films of his day. [3] \nSo did many others. Early cartoons are filled with knockoffsslight variations \non winning themes; retellings of ancient stories. The key to success was the \nbrilliance of the differences. With Disney, it was sound that gave his animation \nits spark. Later, it was the quality of his work relative to the production-line \ncartoons with which he competed. Yet these additions were built upon a base that \nwas borrowed. Disney added to the work of others before him, creating something \nnew out of something just barely old.",
        "Sometimes this borrowing was slight. Sometimes it was significant. Think about \nthe fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm. If you’re as oblivious as I was, you’re \nlikely to think that these tales are happy, sweet stories, appropriate for any \nchild at bedtime. In fact, the Grimm fairy tales are, well, for us, grim. It is \na rare and perhaps overly ambitious parent who would dare to read these bloody, \nmoralistic stories to his or her child, at bedtime or anytime.",
        "Disney took these stories and retold them in a way that carried them into a new \nage. He animated the stories, with both characters and light. Without removing \nthe elements of fear and danger altogether, he made funny what was dark and \ninjected a genuine emotion of compassion where before there was fear. And not \njust with the work of the Brothers Grimm. Indeed, the catalog of Disney work \ndrawing upon the work of others is astonishing when set together: Snow White \n(1937), Fantasia (1940), Pinocchio (1940), Dumbo (1941), Bambi (1942), \n/Song of the South (1946), Cinderella (1950), Alice in Wonderland (1951), \n/Robin Hood (1952), Peter Pan (1953), Lady and the Tramp (1955), Mulan \n(1998), Sleeping Beauty (1959), 101 Dalmatians (1961), The Sword in the \nStone (1963), and The Jungle Book (1967)not to mention a recent example that \nwe should perhaps quickly forget, Treasure Planet (2003). In all of these \ncases, Disney (or Disney, Inc.) ripped creativity from the culture around him, \nmixed that creativity with his own extraordinary talent, and then burned that \nmix into the soul of his culture. Rip, mix, and burn.",
        "This is a kind of creativity. It is a creativity that we should remember and \ncelebrate. There are some who would say that there is no creativity except this \nkind. We don’t need to go that far to recognize its importance. We could call \nthis Disney creativity, though that would be a bit misleading. It is, more \nprecisely, Walt Disney creativitya form of expression and genius that builds \nupon the culture around us and makes it something different. ",
        "In 1928, the culture that Disney was free to draw upon was relatively fresh. The \npublic domain in 1928 was not very old and was therefore quite vibrant. The \naverage term of copyright was just around thirty yearsfor that minority of \ncreative work that was in fact copy-righted.4 That means that for thirty years, \non average, the authors or copyright holders of a creative work had an \nexclusive right to control certain uses of the work. To use this copyrighted \nwork in limited ways required the permission of the copyright owner.",
        "At the end of a copyright term, a work passes into the public domain. No \npermission is then needed to draw upon or use that work. No permission and, \nhence, no lawyers. The public domain is a lawyer-free zone. Thus, most of the \ncontent from the nineteenth century was free for Disney to use and build upon in \n1928. It was free for anyone whether connected or not, whether rich or not, \nwhether approved or notto use and build upon. ",
        "This is the ways things always wereuntil quite recently. For most of our \nhistory, the public domain was just over the horizon. From 1790 until 1978, the \naverage copyright term was never more than thirty-two years, meaning that most \nculture just a generation and a half old was free for anyone to build upon \nwithout the permission of anyone else. Today’s equivalent would be for creative \nwork from the 1960s and 1970s to now be free for the next Walt Disney to build \nupon without permission. Yet today, the public domain is presumptive only for \ncontent from before the Great Depression.",
        "Of course, Walt Disney had no monopoly on Walt Disney creativity. Nor does \nAmerica. The norm of free culture has, until recently, and except within \ntotalitarian nations, been broadly exploited and quite universal.",
        "Consider, for example, a form of creativity that seems strange to many Americans \nbut that is inescapable within Japanese culture: manga, or comics. The \nJapanese are fanatics about comics. Some 40 percent of publications are comics, \nand 30 percent of publication revenue derives from comics. They are everywhere \nin Japanese society, at every magazine stand, carried by a large proportion of \ncommuters on Japan’s extraordinary system of public transportation.",
        "Americans tend to look down upon this form of culture. That’s an unattractive \ncharacteristic of ours. We’re likely to misunderstand much about manga, because \nfew of us have ever read anything close to the stories that these graphic \nnovels tell. For the Japanese, manga cover every aspect of social life. For us, \ncomics are men in tights. And anyway, it’s not as if the New York subways are \nfilled with readers of Joyce or even Hemingway. People of different cultures \ndistract themselves in different ways, the Japanese in this interestingly \ndifferent way.",
        "But my purpose here is not to understand manga. It is to describe a variant on \nmanga that from a lawyer’s perspective is quite odd, but from a Disney \nperspective is quite familiar.",
        "This is the phenomenon of doujinshi. Doujinshi are also comics, but they are a \nkind of copycat comic. A rich ethic governs the creation of doujinshi. It is not \ndoujinshi if it is just a copy; the artist must make a contribution to the art \nhe copies, by transforming it either subtly or significantly. A doujinshi comic \ncan thus take a mainstream comic and develop it differentlywith a different \nstory line. Or the comic can keep the character in character but change its look \nslightly. There is no formula for what makes the doujinshi sufficiently \ndifferent. But they must be different if they are to be considered true \ndoujinshi. Indeed, there are committees that review doujinshi for inclusion \nwithin shows and reject any copycat comic that is merely a copy.",
        "These copycat comics are not a tiny part of the manga market. They are huge. \nMore than 33,000 circles of creators from across Japan produce these bits of \nWalt Disney creativity. More than 450,000 Japanese come together twice a year, \nin the largest public gathering in the country, to exchange and sell them. This \nmarket exists in parallel to the mainstream commercial manga market. In some \nways, it obviously competes with that market, but there is no sustained effort \nby those who control the commercial manga market to shut the doujinshi market \ndown. It flourishes, despite the competition and despite the law.",
        "The most puzzling feature of the doujinshi market, for those trained in the law, \nat least, is that it is allowed to exist at all. Under Japanese copyright law, \nwhich in this respect (on paper) mirrors American copyright law, the doujinshi \nmarket is an illegal one. Doujinshi are plainly derivative works. There is no \ngeneral practice by doujinshi artists of securing the permission of the manga \ncreators. Instead, the practice is simply to take and modify the creations of \nothers, as Walt Disney did with Steamboat Bill, Jr. Under both Japanese and \nAmerican law, that taking without the permission of the original copyright \nowner is illegal. It is an infringement of the original copyright to make a copy \nor a derivative work without the original copyright owner’s permission. ",
        "Yet this illegal market exists and indeed flourishes in Japan, and in the view \nof many, it is precisely because it exists that Japanese manga flourish. As \nAmerican graphic novelist Judd Winick said to me, The early days of comics in \nAmerica are very much like what’s going on in Japan now.  American comics were \nborn out of copying each other. ... That’s how [the artists] learn to drawby \ngoing into comic books and not tracing them, but looking at them and copying \nthem and building from them. [5]",
        "American comics now are quite different, Winick explains, in part because of the \nlegal difficulty of adapting comics the way doujinshi are allowed. Speaking of \nSuperman, Winick told me, there are these rules and you have to stick to them. \nThere are things Superman cannot do. As a creator, it’s frustrating having to \nstick to some parameters which are fifty years old. ",
        "The norm in Japan mitigates this legal difficulty. Some say it is precisely the \nbenefit accruing to the Japanese manga market that explains the mitigation. \nTemple University law professor Salil Mehra, for example, hypothesizes that the \nmanga market accepts these technical violations because they spur the manga \nmarket to be more wealthy and productive. Everyone would be worse off if \ndoujinshi were banned, so the law does not ban doujinshi. [6]",
        "The problem with this story, however, as Mehra plainly acknowledges, is that the \nmechanism producing this laissez faire response is not clear. It may well be \nthat the market as a whole is better off if doujinshi are permitted rather than \nbanned, but that doesn’t explain why individual copyright owners don’t sue \nnonetheless. If the law has no general exception for doujinshi, and indeed in \nsome cases individual manga artists have sued doujinshi artists, why is there \nnot a more general pattern of blocking this free taking by the doujinshi \nculture?",
        "I spent four wonderful months in Japan, and I asked this question as often as I \ncould. Perhaps the best account in the end was offered by a friend from a major \nJapanese law firm. We don’t have enough lawyers, he told me one afternoon. \nThere just aren’t enough resources to prosecute cases like this. ",
        "This is a theme to which we will return: that regulation by law is a function of \nboth the words on the books and the costs of making those words have effect. For \nnow, focus on the obvious question that is begged: Would Japan be better off \nwith more lawyers? Would manga be richer if doujinshi artists were regularly \nprosecuted? Would the Japanese gain something important if they could end this \npractice of uncompensated sharing? Does piracy here hurt the victims of the \npiracy, or does it help them? Would lawyers fighting this piracy help their \nclients or hurt them? ",
        "Let’s pause for a moment.",
        "If you’re like I was a decade ago, or like most people are when they first start \nthinking about these issues, then just about now you should be puzzled about \nsomething you hadn’t thought through before.",
        "We live in a world that celebrates property. I am one of those celebrants. I \nbelieve in the value of property in general, and I also believe in the value of \nthat weird form of property that lawyers call intellectual property. [7] A \nlarge, diverse society cannot survive without property; a large, diverse, and \nmodern society cannot flourish without intellectual property.",
        "But it takes just a second’s reflection to realize that there is plenty of value \nout there that property doesn’t capture. I don’t mean money can’t buy you \nlove, but rather, value that is plainly part of a process of production, \nincluding commercial as well as noncommercial production. If Disney animators \nhad stolen a set of pencils to draw Steamboat Willie, we’d have no hesitation in \ncondemning that taking as wrongeven though trivial, even if unnoticed. Yet \nthere was nothing wrong, at least under the law of the day, with Disney’s taking \nfrom Buster Keaton or from the Brothers Grimm. There was nothing wrong with the \ntaking from Keaton because Disney’s use would have been considered fair. There \nwas nothing wrong with the taking from the Grimms because the Grimms’ work was \nin the public domain.",
        "Thus, even though the things that Disney tookor more generally, the things \ntaken by anyone exercising Walt Disney creativityare valuable, our tradition \ndoes not treat those takings as wrong. Some things remain free for the taking \nwithin a free culture, and that freedom is good.",
        "The same with the doujinshi culture. If a doujinshi artist broke into a \npublisher’s office and ran off with a thousand copies of his latest workor even \none copywithout paying, we’d have no hesitation in saying the artist was wrong. \nIn addition to having trespassed, he would have stolen something of value. The \nlaw bans that stealing in whatever form, whether large or small.",
        "Yet there is an obvious reluctance, even among Japanese lawyers, to say that the \ncopycat comic artists are stealing. This form of Walt Disney creativity is \nseen as fair and right, even if lawyers in particular find it hard to say why.",
        "It’s the same with a thousand examples that appear everywhere once you begin to \nlook. Scientists build upon the work of other scientists without asking or \npaying for the privilege. (Excuse me, Professor Einstein, but may I have \npermission to use your theory of relativity to show that you were wrong about \nquantum physics?) Acting companies perform adaptations of the works of \nShakespeare without securing permission from anyone. (Does anyone believe \nShakespeare would be better spread within our culture if there were a central \nShakespeare rights clearinghouse that all productions of Shakespeare must appeal \nto first?) And Hollywood goes through cycles with a certain kind of movie: five \nasteroid films in the late 1990s; two volcano disaster films in 1997.",
        "Creators here and everywhere are always and at all times building upon the \ncreativity that went before and that surrounds them now. That building is always \nand everywhere at least partially done without permission and without \ncompensating the original creator. No society, free or controlled, has ever \ndemanded that every use be paid for or that permission for Walt Disney \ncreativity must always be sought. Instead, every society has left a certain bit \nof its culture free for the takingfree societies more fully than unfree, \nperhaps, but all societies to some degree.",
        "The hard question is therefore not whether a culture is free. All cultures are \nfree to some degree. The hard question instead is /How free is this culture? \nHow much, and how broadly, is the culture free for others to take and build \nupon? Is that freedom limited to party members? To members of the royal family? \nTo the top ten corporations on the New York Stock Exchange? Or is that freedom \nspread broadly? To artists generally, whether affiliated with the Met or not? To \nmusicians generally, whether white or not? To filmmakers generally, whether \naffiliated with a studio or not?",
        "Free cultures are cultures that leave a great deal open for others to build \nupon; unfree, or permission, cultures leave much less. Ours was a free culture. \nIt is becoming much less so.",
        "In 1839, Louis Daguerre invented the first practical technology for producing \nwhat we would call photographs. Appropriately enough, they were called \ndaguerreotypes. The process was complicated and expensive, and the field was \nthus limited to professionals and a few zealous and wealthy amateurs. (There was \neven an American Daguerre Association that helped regulate the industry, as do \nall such associations, by keeping competition down so as to keep prices up.)",
        "Yet despite high prices, the demand for daguerreotypes was strong. This pushed \ninventors to find simpler and cheaper ways to make automatic pictures. William \nTalbot soon discovered a process for making negatives. But because the \nnegatives were glass, and had to be kept wet, the process still remained \nexpensive and cumbersome. In the 1870s, dry plates were developed, making it \neasier to separate the taking of a picture from its developing. These were still \nplates of glass, and thus it was still not a process within reach of most \namateurs.",
        "The technological change that made mass photography possible didn’t happen until \n1888, and was the creation of a single man. George Eastman, himself an amateur \nphotographer, was frustrated by the technology of photographs made with plates. \nIn a flash of insight (so to speak), Eastman saw that if the film could be made \nto be flexible, it could be held on a single spindle. That roll could then be \nsent to a developer, driving the costs of photography down substantially. By \nlowering the costs, Eastman expected he could dramatically broaden the \npopulation of photographers.",
        "Eastman developed flexible, emulsion-coated paper film and placed rolls of it in \nsmall, simple cameras: the Kodak. The device was marketed on the basis of its \nsimplicity. You press the button and we do the rest. [1] As he described in \n/The Kodak Primer/:",
        "The principle of the Kodak system is the separation of the work that any person \nwhomsoever can do in making a photograph, from the work that only an expert can \ndo. ... We furnish anybody, man, woman or child, who has sufficient intelligence \nto point a box straight and press a button, with an instrument which altogether \nremoves from the practice of photography the necessity for exceptional \nfacilities or, in fact, any special knowledge of the art. It can be employed \nwithout preliminary study, without a darkroom and without chemicals. [2]",
        "For $25, anyone could make pictures. The camera came preloaded with film, and \nwhen it had been used, the camera was returned to an Eastman factory, where the \nfilm was developed. Over time, of course, the cost of the camera and the ease \nwith which it could be used both improved. Roll film thus became the basis for \nthe explosive growth of popular photography. Eastman’s camera first went on sale \nin 1888; one year later, Kodak was printing more than six thousand negatives a \nday. From 1888 through 1909, while industrial production was rising by 4.7 \npercent, photographic equipment and material sales increased by 11 percent. [3] \nEastman Kodak’s sales during the same period experienced an average annual \nincrease of over 17 percent. [4]",
        "The real significance of Eastman’s invention, however, was not economic. It was \nsocial. Professional photography gave individuals a glimpse of places they would \nnever otherwise see. Amateur photography gave them the ability to record their \nown lives in a way they had never been able to do before. As author Brian Coe \nnotes, For the first time the snapshot album provided the man on the street \nwith a permanent record of his family and its activities. ... For the first time \nin history there exists an authentic visual record of the appearance and \nactivities of the common man made without [literary] interpretation or bias. \n[5]",
        "In this way, the Kodak camera and film were technologies of expression. The \npencil or paintbrush was also a technology of expression, of course. But it took \nyears of training before they could be deployed by amateurs in any useful or \neffective way. With the Kodak, expression was possible much sooner and more \nsimply. The barrier to expression was lowered. Snobs would sneer at its \nquality; professionals would discount it as irrelevant. But watch a child \nstudy how best to frame a picture and you get a sense of the experience of \ncreativity that the Kodak enabled. Democratic tools gave ordinary people a way \nto express themselves more easily than any tools could have before.",
        "What was required for this technology to flourish? Obviously, Eastman’s genius \nwas an important part. But also important was the legal environment within which \nEastman’s invention grew. For early in the history of photography, there was a \nseries of judicial decisions that could well have changed the course of \nphotography substantially. Courts were asked whether the photographer, amateur \nor professional, required permission before he could capture and print whatever \nimage he wanted. Their answer was no. [6]",
        "The arguments in favor of requiring permission will sound surprisingly familiar. \nThe photographer was taking something from the person or building whose \nphotograph he shotpirating something of value. Some even thought he was taking \nthe target’s soul. Just as Disney was not free to take the pencils that his \nanimators used to draw Mickey, so, too, should these photographers not be free \nto take images that they thought valuable.",
        "On the other side was an argument that should be familiar, as well. Sure, there \nmay be something of value being used. But citizens should have the right to \ncapture at least those images that stand in public view. (Louis Brandeis, who \nwould become a Supreme Court Justice, thought the rule should be different for \nimages from private spaces. [7]) It may be that this means that the photographer \ngets something for nothing. Just as Disney could take inspiration from \n/Steamboat Bill, Jr. or the Brothers Grimm, the photographer should be free to \ncapture an image without compensating the source.",
        "Fortunately for Mr. Eastman, and for photography in general, these early \ndecisions went in favor of the pirates. In general, no permission would be \nrequired before an image could be captured and shared with others. Instead, \npermission was presumed. Freedom was the default. (The law would eventually \ncraft an exception for famous people: commercial photographers who snap pictures \nof famous people for commercial purposes have more restrictions than the rest of \nus. But in the ordinary case, the image can be captured without clearing the \nrights to do the capturing. [8])",
        "We can only speculate about how photography would have developed had the law \ngone the other way. If the presumption had been against the photographer, then \nthe photographer would have had to demonstrate permission. Perhaps Eastman Kodak \nwould have had to demonstrate permission, too, before it developed the film upon \nwhich images were captured. After all, if permission were not granted, then \nEastman Kodak would be benefiting from the theft committed by the \nphotographer. Just as Napster benefited from the copyright infringements \ncommitted by Napster users, Kodak would be benefiting from the image-right” \ninfringement of its photographers. We could imagine the law then requiring that \nsome form of permission be demonstrated before a company developed pictures. We \ncould imagine a system developing to demonstrate that permission.",
        "But though we could imagine this system of permission, it would be very hard to \nsee how photography could have flourished as it did if the requirement for \npermission had been built into the rules that govern it. Photography would have \nexisted. It would have grown in importance over time. Professionals would have \ncontinued to use the technology as they didsince professionals could have more \neasily borne the burdens of the permission system. But the spread of photography \nto ordinary people would not have occurred. Nothing like that growth would have \nbeen realized. And certainly, nothing like that growth in a democratic \ntechnology of expression would have been realized.",
        "If you drive through San Francisco’s Presidio, you might see two gaudy yellow \nschool buses painted over with colorful and striking images, and the logo Just \nThink! in place of the name of a school. But there’s little that’s just \ncerebral in the projects that these busses enable. These buses are filled with \ntechnologies that teach kids to tinker with film. Not the film of Eastman. Not \neven the film of your VCR. Rather the film of digital cameras. Just Think! is \na project that enables kids to make films, as a way to understand and critique \nthe filmed culture that they find all around them. Each year, these busses \ntravel to more than thirty schools and enable three hundred to five hundred \nchildren to learn something about media by doing something with media. By doing, \nthey think. By tinkering, they learn.",
        "These buses are not cheap, but the technology they carry is increasingly so. The \ncost of a high-quality digital video system has fallen dramatically. As one \nanalyst puts it, Five years ago, a good real-time digital video editing system \ncost $25,000. Today you can get professional quality for $595. [9] These buses \nare filled with technology that would have cost hundreds of thousands just ten \nyears ago. And it is now feasible to imagine not just buses like this, but \nclassrooms across the country where kids are learning more and more of something \nteachers call media literacy.",
        "Media literacy, as Dave Yanofsky, the executive director of Just Think!, puts \nit, is the ability ... to understand, analyze, and deconstruct media images. \nIts aim is to make [kids] literate about the way media works, the way it’s \nconstructed, the way it’s delivered, and the way people access it.",
        "This may seem like an odd way to think about literacy. For most people, \nliteracy is about reading and writing. Faulkner and Hemingway and noticing split \ninfinitives are the things that literate people know about.",
        "Maybe. But in a world where children see on average 390 hours of television \ncommercials per year, or between 20,000 and 45,000 commercials generally, [10] \nit is increasingly important to understand the grammar of media. For just as \nthere is a grammar for the written word, so, too, is there one for media. And \njust as kids learn how to write by writing lots of terrible prose, kids learn \nhow to write media by constructing lots of (at least at first) terrible media.",
        "A growing field of academics and activists sees this form of literacy as crucial \nto the next generation of culture. For though anyone who has written understands \nhow difficult writing ishow difficult it is to sequence the story, to keep a \nreader’s attention, to craft language to be understandablefew of us have any \nreal sense of how difficult media is. Or more fundamentally, few of us have a \nsense of how media works, how it holds an audience or leads it through a story, \nhow it triggers emotion or builds suspense.",
        "It took filmmaking a generation before it could do these things well. But even \nthen, the knowledge was in the filming, not in writing about the film. The skill \ncame from experiencing the making of a film, not from reading a book about it. \nOne learns to write by writing and then reflecting upon what one has written. \nOne learns to write with images by making them and then reflecting upon what one \nhas created.",
        "This grammar has changed as media has changed. When it was just film, as \nElizabeth Daley, executive director of the University of Southern California’s \nAnnenberg Center for Communication and dean of the USC School of Cinema-\nTelevision, explained to me, the grammar was about the placement of objects, \ncolor, ... rhythm, pacing, and texture. [11] But as computers open up an \ninteractive space where a story is played as well as experienced, that grammar \nchanges. The simple control of narrative is lost, and so other techniques are \nnecessary. Author Michael Crichton had mastered the narrative of science \nfiction. But when he tried to design a computer game based on one of his works, \nit was a new craft he had to learn. How to lead people through a game without \ntheir feeling they have been led was not obvious, even to a wildly successful \nauthor. [12]",
        "This skill is precisely the craft a filmmaker learns. As Daley describes, \npeople are very surprised about how they are led through a film. [I]t is \nperfectly constructed to keep you from seeing it, so you have no idea. If a \nfilmmaker succeeds you do not know how you were led. If you know you were led \nthrough a film, the film has failed.",
        "Yet the push for an expanded literacyone that goes beyond text to include audio \nand visual elementsis not about making better film directors. The aim is not to \nimprove the profession of filmmaking at all. Instead, as Daley explained,",
        "From my perspective, probably the most important digital divide is not access \nto a box. It’s the ability to be empowered with the language that that box works \nin. Otherwise only a very few people can write with this language, and all the \nrest of us are reduced to being read-only.",
        "Read-only. Passive recipients of culture produced elsewhere. Couch potatoes. \nConsumers. This is the world of media from the twentieth century.",
        "The twenty-first century could be different. This is the crucial point: It could \nbe both read and write. Or at least reading and better understanding the craft \nof writing. Or best, reading and understanding the tools that enable the writing \nto lead or mislead. The aim of any literacy, and this literacy in particular, is \nto empower people to choose the appropriate language for what they need to \ncreate or express. [13] It is to enable students to communicate in the \nlanguage of the twenty-first century. [14]",
        "As with any language, this language comes more easily to some than to others. It \ndoesn’t necessarily come more easily to those who excel in written language. \nDaley and Stephanie Barish, director of the Institute for Multimedia Literacy at \nthe Annenberg Center, describe one particularly poignant example of a project \nthey ran in a high school. The high school was a very poor inner-city Los \nAngeles school. In all the traditional measures of success, this school was a \nfailure. But Daley and Barish ran a program that gave kids an opportunity to use \nfilm to express meaning about something the students know something aboutgun \nviolence.",
        "The class was held on Friday afternoons, and it created a relatively new problem \nfor the school. While the challenge in most classes was getting the kids to \ncome, the challenge in this class was keeping them away. The kids were showing \nup at 6 A.M. and leaving at 5 at night, said Barish. They were working harder \nthan in any other class to do what education should be aboutlearning how to \nexpress themselves.",
        "Using whatever free web stuff they could find, and relatively simple tools to \nenable the kids to mix image, sound, and text, Barish said this class produced \na series of projects that showed something about gun violence that few would \notherwise understand. This was an issue close to the lives of these students. \nThe project gave them a tool and empowered them to be able to both understand \nit and talk about it, Barish explained. That tool succeeded in creating \nexpressionfar more successfully and powerfully than could have been created \nusing only text. If you had said to these students, ’you have to do it in \ntext,’ they would’ve just thrown their hands up and gone and done something \nelse, Barish described, in part, no doubt, because expressing themselves in \ntext is not something these students can do well. Yet neither is text a form in \nwhich these ideas can be expressed well. The power of this message depended \nupon its connection to this form of expression.",
        "But isn’t education about teaching kids to write? I asked. In part, of course, \nit is. But why are we teaching kids to write? Education, Daley explained, is \nabout giving students a way of constructing meaning. To say that that means \njust writing is like saying teaching writing is only about teaching kids how to \nspell. Text is one partand increasingly, not the most powerful partof \nconstructing meaning. As Daley explained in the most moving part of our \ninterview,",
        "What you want is to give these students ways of constructing meaning. If all \nyou give them is text, they’re not going to do it. Because they can’t. You know, \nyou’ve got Johnny who can look at a video, he can play a video game, he can do \ngraffiti all over your walls, he can take your car apart, and he can do all \nsorts of other things. He just can’t read your text. So Johnny comes to school \nand you say, Johnny, you’re illiterate. Nothing you can do matters. Well, \nJohnny then has two choices: He can dismiss you or he [can] dismiss himself. If \nhis ego is healthy at all, he’s going to dismiss you. [But i]nstead, if you say, \nWell, with all these things that you can do, let’s talk about this issue. Play \nfor me music that you think reflects that, or show me images that you think \nreflect that, or draw for me something that reflects that. Not by giving a kid \na video camera and ... saying, Let’s go have fun with the video camera and make \na little movie. But instead, really help you take these elements that you \nunderstand, that are your language, and construct meaning about the topic. ...",
        "That empowers enormously. And then what happens, of course, is eventually, as \nit has happened in all these classes, they bump up against the fact, I need to \nexplain this and I really need to write something. And as one of the teachers \ntold Stephanie, they would rewrite a paragraph 5, 6, 7, 8 times, till they got \nit right.",
        "Because they needed to. There was a reason for doing it. They needed to say \nsomething, as opposed to just jumping through your hoops. They actually needed \nto use a language that they didn’t speak very well. But they had come to \nunderstand that they had a lot of power with this language.",
        "When two planes crashed into the World Trade Center, another into the Pentagon, \nand a fourth into a Pennsylvania field, all media around the world shifted to \nthis news. Every moment of just about every day for that week, and for weeks \nafter, television in particular, and media generally, retold the story of the \nevents we had just witnessed. The telling was a retelling, because we had seen \nthe events that were described. The genius of this awful act of terrorism was \nthat the delayed second attack was perfectly timed to assure that the whole \nworld would be watching.",
        "These retellings had an increasingly familiar feel. There was music scored for \nthe intermissions, and fancy graphics that flashed across the screen. There was \na formula to interviews. There was balance, and seriousness. This was news \nchoreographed in the way we have increasingly come to expect it, news as \nentertainment, even if the entertainment is tragedy.",
        "But in addition to this produced news about the tragedy of September 11, those \nof us tied to the Internet came to see a very different production as well. The \nInternet was filled with accounts of the same events. Yet these Internet \naccounts had a very different flavor. Some people constructed photo pages that \ncaptured images from around the world and presented them as slide shows with \ntext. Some offered open letters. There were sound recordings. There was anger \nand frustration. There were attempts to provide context. There was, in short, an \nextraordinary worldwide barn raising, in the sense Mike Godwin uses the term in \nhis book Cyber Rights, around a news event that had captured the attention of \nthe world. There was ABC and CBS, but there was also the Internet.",
        "I don’t mean simply to praise the Internetthough I do think the people who \nsupported this form of speech should be praised. I mean instead to point to a \nsignificance in this form of speech. For like a Kodak, the Internet enables \npeople to capture images. And like in a movie by a student on the Just Think! \nbus, the visual images could be mixed with sound or text.",
        "But unlike any technology for simply capturing images, the Internet allows these \ncreations to be shared with an extraordinary number of people, practically \ninstantaneously. This is something new in our traditionnot just that culture \ncan be captured mechanically, and obviously not just that events are commented \nupon critically, but that this mix of captured images, sound, and commentary can \nbe widely spread practically instantaneously.",
        "September 11 was not an aberration. It was a beginning. Around the same time, a \nform of communication that has grown dramatically was just beginning to come \ninto public consciousness: the Web-log, or blog. The blog is a kind of public \ndiary, and within some cultures, such as in Japan, it functions very much like a \ndiary. In those cultures, it records private facts in a public wayit’s a kind \nof electronic Jerry Springer, available anywhere in the world.",
        "But in the United States, blogs have taken on a very different character. There \nare some who use the space simply to talk about their private life. But there \nare many who use the space to engage in public discourse. Discussing matters of \npublic import, criticizing others who are mistaken in their views, criticizing \npoliticians about the decisions they make, offering solutions to problems we all \nsee: blogs create the sense of a virtual public meeting, but one in which we \ndon’t all hope to be there at the same time and in which conversations are not \nnecessarily linked. The best of the blog entries are relatively short; they \npoint directly to words used by others, criticizing with or adding to them. They \nare arguably the most important form of unchoreographed public discourse that we \nhave.",
        "That’s a strong statement. Yet it says as much about our democracy as it does \nabout blogs. This is the part of America that is most difficult for those of us \nwho love America to accept: Our democracy has atrophied. Of course we have \nelections, and most of the time the courts allow those elections to count. A \nrelatively small number of people vote in those elections. The cycle of these \nelections has become totally professionalized and routinized. Most of us think \nthis is democracy.",
        "But democracy has never just been about elections. Democracy means rule by the \npeople, but rule means something more than mere elections. In our tradition, it \nalso means control through reasoned discourse. This was the idea that captured \nthe imagination of Alexis de Tocqueville, the nineteenth-century French lawyer \nwho wrote the most important account of early Democracy in America. It wasn’t \npopular elections that fascinated himit was the jury, an institution that gave \nordinary people the right to choose life or death for other citizens. And most \nfascinating for him was that the jury didn’t just vote about the outcome they \nwould impose. They deliberated. Members argued about the right result; they \ntried to persuade each other of the right result, and in criminal cases at \nleast, they had to agree upon a unanimous result for the process to come to an \nend. [15]",
        "Yet even this institution flags in American life today. And in its place, there \nis no systematic effort to enable citizen deliberation. Some are pushing to \ncreate just such an institution. [16] And in some towns in New England, \nsomething close to deliberation remains. But for most of us for most of the \ntime, there is no time or place for democratic deliberation to occur.",
        "More bizarrely, there is generally not even permission for it to occur. We, the \nmost powerful democracy in the world, have developed a strong norm against \ntalking about politics. It’s fine to talk about politics with people you agree \nwith. But it is rude to argue about politics with people you disagree with. \nPolitical discourse becomes isolated, and isolated discourse becomes more \nextreme. [17] We say what our friends want to hear, and hear very little beyond \nwhat our friends say.",
        "Enter the blog. The blog’s very architecture solves one part of this problem. \nPeople post when they want to post, and people read when they want to read. The \nmost difficult time is synchronous time. Technologies that enable asynchronous \ncommunication, such as e-mail, increase the opportunity for communication. Blogs \nallow for public discourse without the public ever needing to gather in a single \npublic place.",
        "But beyond architecture, blogs also have solved the problem of norms. There’s no \nnorm (yet) in blog space not to talk about politics. Indeed, the space is filled \nwith political speech, on both the right and the left. Some of the most popular \nsites are conservative or libertarian, but there are many of all political \nstripes. And even blogs that are not political cover political issues when the \noccasion merits.",
        "The significance of these blogs is tiny now, though not so tiny. The name Howard \nDean may well have faded from the 2004 presidential race but for blogs. Yet even \nif the number of readers is small, the reading is having an effect.",
        "One direct effect is on stories that had a different life cycle in the \nmainstream media. The Trent Lott affair is an example. When Lott misspoke at a \nparty for Senator Strom Thurmond, essentially praising Thurmond’s segregationist \npolicies, he calculated correctly that this story would disappear from the \nmainstream press within forty-eight hours. It did. But he didn’t calculate its \nlife cycle in blog space. The bloggers kept researching the story. Over time, \nmore and more instances of the same misspeaking emerged. Finally, the story \nbroke back into the mainstream press. In the end, Lott was forced to resign as \nsenate majority leader. [18]",
        "This different cycle is possible because the same commercial pressures don’t \nexist with blogs as with other ventures. Television and newspapers are \ncommercial entities. They must work to keep attention. If they lose readers, \nthey lose revenue. Like sharks, they must move on.",
        "But bloggers don’t have a similar constraint. They can obsess, they can focus, \nthey can get serious. If a particular blogger writes a particularly interesting \nstory, more and more people link to that story. And as the number of links to a \nparticular story increases, it rises in the ranks of stories. People read what \nis popular; what is popular has been selected by a very democratic process of \npeer-generated rankings.",
        "There’s a second way, as well, in which blogs have a different cycle from the \nmainstream press. As Dave Winer, one of the fathers of this movement and a \nsoftware author for many decades, told me, another difference is the absence of \na financial conflict of interest. I think you have to take the conflict of \ninterest out of journalism, Winer told me. An amateur journalist simply \ndoesn’t have a conflict of interest, or the conflict of interest is so easily \ndisclosed that you know you can sort of get it out of the way.",
        "These conflicts become more important as media becomes more concentrated (more \non this below). A concentrated media can hide more from the public than an \nunconcentrated media canas CNN admitted it did after the Iraq war because it \nwas afraid of the consequences to its own employees. [19] It also needs to \nsustain a more coherent account. (In the middle of the Iraq war, I read a post \non the Internet from someone who was at that time listening to a satellite \nuplink with a reporter in Iraq. The New York headquarters was telling the \nreporter over and over that her account of the war was too bleak: She needed to \noffer a more optimistic story. When she told New York that wasn’t warranted, \nthey told her that they were writing the story.)",
        "Blog space gives amateurs a way to enter the debateamateur not in the sense \nof inexperienced, but in the sense of an Olympic athlete, meaning not paid by \nanyone to give their reports. It allows for a much broader range of input into a \nstory, as reporting on the Columbia disaster revealed, when hundreds from across \nthe southwest United States turned to the Internet to retell what they had seen. \n[20] And it drives readers to read across the range of accounts and \ntriangulate, as Winer puts it, the truth. Blogs, Winer says, are \ncommunicating directly with our constituency, and the middle man is out of it\nwith all the benefits, and costs, that might entail.",
        "Winer is optimistic about the future of journalism infected with blogs. It’s \ngoing to become an essential skill, Winer predicts, for public figures and \nincreasingly for private figures as well. It’s not clear that journalism is \nhappy about thissome journalists have been told to curtail their blogging. [21] \nBut it is clear that we are still in transition. A lot of what we are doing now \nis warm-up exercises, Winer told me. There is a lot that must mature before \nthis space has its mature effect. And as the inclusion of content in this space \nis the least infringing use of the Internet (meaning infringing on copyright), \nWiner said, we will be the last thing that gets shut down.",
        "This speech affects democracy. Winer thinks that happens because you don’t have \nto work for somebody who controls, [for] a gate-keeper. That is true. But it \naffects democracy in another way as well. As more and more citizens express what \nthey think, and defend it in writing, that will change the way people understand \npublic issues. It is easy to be wrong and misguided in your head. It is harder \nwhen the product of your mind can be criticized by others. Of course, it is a \nrare human who admits that he has been persuaded that he is wrong. But it is \neven rarer for a human to ignore when he has been proven wrong. The writing of \nideas, arguments, and criticism improves democracy. Today there are probably a \ncouple of million blogs where such writing happens. When there are ten million, \nthere will be something extraordinary to report.",
        "John Seely Brown is the chief scientist of the Xerox Corporation. His work, as \nhis Web site describes it, is human learning and ... the creation of knowledge \necologies for creating ... innovation.",
        "Brown thus looks at these technologies of digital creativity a bit differently \nfrom the perspectives I’ve sketched so far. I’m sure he would be excited about \nany technology that might improve democracy. But his real excitement comes from \nhow these technologies affect learning.",
        "As Brown believes, we learn by tinkering. When a lot of us grew up, he \nexplains, that tinkering was done on motorcycle engines, lawn-mower engines, \nautomobiles, radios, and so on. But digital technologies enable a different \nkind of tinkeringwith abstract ideas though in concrete form. The kids at Just \nThink! not only think about how a commercial portrays a politician; using \ndigital technology, they can take the commercial apart and manipulate it, tinker \nwith it to see how it does what it does. Digital technologies launch a kind of \nbricolage, or free collage, as Brown calls it. Many get to add to or transform \nthe tinkering of many others.",
        "The best large-scale example of this kind of tinkering so far is free software \nor open-source software (FS/OSS). FS/OSS is software whose source code is \nshared. Anyone can download the technology that makes a FS/OSS program run. And \nanyone eager to learn how a particular bit of FS/OSS technology works can tinker \nwith the code.",
        "This opportunity creates a completely new kind of learning platform, as Brown \ndescribes. As soon as you start doing that, you ... unleash a free collage on \nthe community, so that other people can start looking at your code, tinkering \nwith it, trying it out, seeing if they can improve it. Each effort is a kind of \napprenticeship. Open source becomes a major apprenticeship platform.",
        "In this process, the concrete things you tinker with are abstract. They are \ncode. Kids are shifting to the ability to tinker in the abstract, and this \ntinkering is no longer an isolated activity that you’re doing in your garage. \nYou are tinkering with a community platform. ... You are tinkering with other \npeople’s stuff. The more you tinker the more you improve. The more you improve, \nthe more you learn.",
        "This same thing happens with content, too. And it happens in the same \ncollaborative way when that content is part of the Web. As Brown puts it, the \nWeb [is] the first medium that truly honors multiple forms of intelligence. \nEarlier technologies, such as the typewriter or word processors, helped amplify \ntext. But the Web amplifies much more than text. The Web ... says if you are \nmusical, if you are artistic, if you are visual, if you are interested in film \n... [then] there is a lot you can start to do on this medium. [It] can now \namplify and honor these multiple forms of intelligence.",
        "Brown is talking about what Elizabeth Daley, Stephanie Barish, and Just Think! \nteach: that this tinkering with culture teaches as well as creates. It develops \ntalents differently, and it builds a different kind of recognition.",
        "Yet the freedom to tinker with these objects is not guaranteed. Indeed, as we’ll \nsee through the course of this book, that freedom is increasingly highly \ncontested. While there’s no doubt that your father had the right to tinker with \nthe car engine, there’s great doubt that your child will have the right to \ntinker with the images she finds all around. The law and, increasingly, \ntechnology interfere with a freedom that technology, and curiosity, would \notherwise ensure.",
        "These restrictions have become the focus of researchers and scholars. Professor \nEd Felten of Princeton (whom we’ll see more of in chapter 10) has developed a \npowerful argument in favor of the right to tinker as it applies to computer \nscience and to knowledge in general. [22] But Brown’s concern is earlier, or \nyounger, or more fundamental. It is about the learning that kids can do, or \ncan’t do, because of the law.",
        "This is where education in the twenty-first century is going, Brown explains. \nWe need to understand how kids who grow up digital think and want to learn.",
        "Yet, as Brown continued, and as the balance of this book will evince, we are \nbuilding a legal system that completely suppresses the natural tendencies of \ntoday’s digital kids. ... We’re building an architecture that unleashes 60 \npercent of the brain [and] a legal system that closes down that part of the \nbrain.",
        "We’re building a technology that takes the magic of Kodak, mixes moving images \nand sound, and adds a space for commentary and an opportunity to spread that \ncreativity everywhere. But we’re building the law to close down that technology.",
        "No way to run a culture, as Brewster Kahle, whom we’ll meet in chapter 9, \nquipped to me in a rare moment of despondence.",
        "In the fall of 2002, Jesse Jordan of Oceanside, New York, enrolled as a freshman \nat Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, New York. His major at RPI was \ninformation technology. Though he is not a programmer, in October Jesse decided \nto begin to tinker with search engine technology that was available on the RPI \nnetwork.",
        "RPI is one of America’s foremost technological research institutions. It offers \ndegrees in fields ranging from architecture and engineering to information \nsciences. More than 65 percent of its five thousand undergraduates finished in \nthe top 10 percent of their high school class. The school is thus a perfect mix \nof talent and experience to imagine and then build, a generation for the network \nage.",
        "RPI’s computer network links students, faculty, and administration to one \nanother. It also links RPI to the Internet. Not everything available on the RPI \nnetwork is available on the Internet. But the network is designed to enable \nstudents to get access to the Internet, as well as more intimate access to other \nmembers of the RPI community.",
        "Search engines are a measure of a network’s intimacy. Google brought the \nInternet much closer to all of us by fantastically improving the quality of \nsearch on the network. Specialty search engines can do this even better. The \nidea of intranet search engines, search engines that search within the network \nof a particular institution, is to provide users of that institution with better \naccess to material from that institution. Businesses do this all the time, \nenabling employees to have access to material that people outside the business \ncan’t get. Universities do it as well.",
        "These engines are enabled by the network technology itself. Microsoft, for \nexample, has a network file system that makes it very easy for search engines \ntuned to that network to query the system for information about the publicly \n(within that network) available content. Jesse’s search engine was built to take \nadvantage of this technology. It used Microsoft’s network file system to build \nan index of all the files available within the RPI network.",
        "Jesse’s wasn’t the first search engine built for the RPI network. Indeed, his \nengine was a simple modification of engines that others had built. His single \nmost important improvement over those engines was to fix a bug within the \nMicrosoft file-sharing system that could cause a user’s computer to crash. With \nthe engines that existed before, if you tried to access a file through a Windows \nbrowser that was on a computer that was off-line, your computer could crash. \nJesse modified the system a bit to fix that problem, by adding a button that a \nuser could click to see if the machine holding the file was still on-line.",
        "Jesse’s engine went on-line in late October. Over the following six months, he \ncontinued to tweak it to improve its functionality. By March, the system was \nfunctioning quite well. Jesse had more than one million files in his directory, \nincluding every type of content that might be on users’ computers.",
        "Thus the index his search engine produced included pictures, which students \ncould use to put on their own Web sites; copies of notes or research; copies of \ninformation pamphlets; movie clips that students might have created; university \nbrochuresbasically anything that users of the RPI network made available in a \npublic folder of their computer.",
        "But the index also included music files. In fact, one quarter of the files that \nJesse’s search engine listed were music files. But that means, of course, that \nthree quarters were not, andso that this point is absolutely clearJesse did \nnothing to induce people to put music files in their public folders. He did \nnothing to target the search engine to these files. He was a kid tinkering with \na Google-like technology at a university where he was studying information \nscience, and hence, tinkering was the aim. Unlike Google, or Microsoft, for that \nmatter, he made no money from this tinkering; he was not connected to any \nbusiness that would make any money from this experiment. He was a kid tinkering \nwith technology in an environment where tinkering with technology was precisely \nwhat he was supposed to do.",
        "On April 3, 2003, Jesse was contacted by the dean of students at RPI. The dean \ninformed Jesse that the Recording Industry Association of America, the RIAA, \nwould be filing a lawsuit against him and three other students whom he didn’t \neven know, two of them at other universities. A few hours later, Jesse was \nserved with papers from the suit. As he read these papers and watched the news \nreports about them, he was increasingly astonished.",
        "It was absurd, he told me. I don’t think I did anything wrong. ... I don’t \nthink there’s anything wrong with the search engine that I ran or ... what I had \ndone to it. I mean, I hadn’t modified it in any way that promoted or enhanced \nthe work of pirates. I just modified the search engine in a way that would make \nit easier to useagain, a search engine, which Jesse had not himself built, \nusing the Windows file-sharing system, which Jesse had not himself built, to \nenable members of the RPI community to get access to content, which Jesse had \nnot himself created or posted, and the vast majority of which had nothing to do \nwith music.",
        "But the RIAA branded Jesse a pirate. They claimed he operated a network and had \ntherefore willfully violated copyright laws. They demanded that he pay them \nthe damages for his wrong. For cases of willful infringement, the Copyright \nAct specifies something lawyers call statutory damages. These damages permit a \ncopyright owner to claim $150,000 per infringement. As the RIAA alleged more \nthan one hundred specific copyright infringements, they therefore demanded that \nJesse pay them at least $15,000,000.",
        "Similar lawsuits were brought against three other students: one other student at \nRPI, one at Michigan Technical University, and one at Princeton. Their \nsituations were similar to Jesse’s. Though each case was different in detail, \nthe bottom line in each was exactly the same: huge demands for damages that \nthe RIAA claimed it was entitled to. If you added up the claims, these four \nlawsuits were asking courts in the United States to award the plaintiffs close \nto $100 billionsix times the total profit of the film industry in 2001. [1]",
        "Jesse called his parents. They were supportive but a bit frightened. An uncle \nwas a lawyer. He began negotiations with the RIAA. They demanded to know how \nmuch money Jesse had. Jesse had saved $12,000 from summer jobs and other \nemployment. They demanded $12,000 to dismiss the case.",
        "The RIAA wanted Jesse to admit to doing something wrong. He refused. They wanted \nhim to agree to an injunction that would essentially make it impossible for him \nto work in many fields of technology for the rest of his life. He refused. They \nmade him understand that this process of being sued was not going to be \npleasant. (As Jesse’s father recounted to me, the chief lawyer on the case, Matt \nOppenheimer, told Jesse, You don’t want to pay another visit to a dentist like \nme.) And throughout, the RIAA insisted it would not settle the case until it \ntook every penny Jesse had saved.",
        "Jesse’s family was outraged at these claims. They wanted to fight. But Jesse’s \nuncle worked to educate the family about the nature of the American legal \nsystem. Jesse could fight the RIAA. He might even win. But the cost of fighting \na lawsuit like this, Jesse was told, would be at least $250,000. If he won, he \nwould not recover that money. If he won, he would have a piece of paper saying \nhe had won, and a piece of paper saying he and his family were bankrupt.",
        "So Jesse faced a mafia-like choice: $250,000 and a chance at winning, or $12,000 \nand a settlement.",
        "The recording industry insists this is a matter of law and morality. Let’s put \nthe law aside for a moment and think about the morality. Where is the morality \nin a lawsuit like this? What is the virtue in scapegoatism? The RIAA is an \nextraordinarily powerful lobby. The president of the RIAA is reported to make \nmore than $1 million a year. Artists, on the other hand, are not well paid. The \naverage recording artist makes $45,900. [2] There are plenty of ways for the \nRIAA to affect and direct policy. So where is the morality in taking money from \na student for running a search engine? [3]",
        "On June 23, Jesse wired his savings to the lawyer working for the RIAA. The case \nagainst him was then dismissed. And with this, this kid who had tinkered a \ncomputer into a $15 million lawsuit became an activist:",
        "I was definitely not an activist [before]. I never really meant to be an \nactivist. ... [But] I’ve been pushed into this. In no way did I ever foresee \nanything like this, but I think it’s just completely absurd what the RIAA has \ndone.",
        "Jesse’s parents betray a certain pride in their reluctant activist. As his \nfather told me, Jesse considers himself very conservative, and so do I. ... \nHe’s not a tree hugger. . . . I think it’s bizarre that they would pick on him. \nBut he wants to let people know that they’re sending the wrong message. And he \nwants to correct the record.",
        "If piracy means using the creative property of others without their \npermissionif if value, then right is truethen the history of the content \nindustry is a history of piracy. Every important sector of big media today\nfilm, records, radio, and cable TVwas born of a kind of piracy so defined. The \nconsistent story is how last generation’s pirates join this generation’s country \nclubuntil now.",
        "Film",
        "The film industry of Hollywood was built by fleeing pirates. [1] Creators and \ndirectors migrated from the East Coast to California in the early twentieth \ncentury in part to escape controls that patents granted the inventor of \nfilmmaking, Thomas Edison. These controls were exercised through a monopoly \ntrust, the Motion Pictures Patents Company, and were based on Thomas Edison’s \ncreative propertypatents. Edison formed the MPPC to exercise the rights this \ncreative property gave him, and the MPPC was serious about the control it \ndemanded. As one commentator tells one part of the story,",
        "A January 1909 deadline was set for all companies to comply with the license. \nBy February, unlicensed outlaws, who referred to themselves as independents \nprotested the trust and carried on business without submitting to the Edison \nmonopoly. In the summer of 1909 the independent movement was in full-swing, with \nproducers and theater owners using illegal equipment and imported film stock to \ncreate their own underground market.",
        "With the country experiencing a tremendous expansion in the number of \nnickelodeons, the Patents Company reacted to the independent movement by forming \na strong-arm subsidiary known as the General Film Company to block the entry of \nnon-licensed independents. With coercive tactics that have become legendary, \nGeneral Film confiscated unlicensed equipment, discontinued product supply to \ntheaters which showed unlicensed films, and effectively monopolized distribution \nwith the acquisition of all U.S. film exchanges, except for the one owned by the \nindependent William Fox who defied the Trust even after his license was \nrevoked. [2]",
        "The Napsters of those days, the independents, were companies like Fox. And no \nless than today, these independents were vigorously resisted. Shooting was \ndisrupted by machinery stolen, and ’accidents’ resulting in loss of negatives, \nequipment, buildings and sometimes life and limb frequently occurred. [3] That \nled the independents to flee the East Coast. California was remote enough from \nEdison’s reach that film- makers there could pirate his inventions without fear \nof the law. And the leaders of Hollywood filmmaking, Fox most prominently, did \njust that.",
        "Of course, California grew quickly, and the effective enforcement of federal law \neventually spread west. But because patents grant the patent holder a truly \nlimited monopoly (just seventeen years at that time), by the time enough \nfederal marshals appeared, the patents had expired. A new industry had been \nborn, in part from the piracy of Edison’s creative property.",
        "Recorded Music",
        "The record industry was born of another kind of piracy, though to see how \nrequires a bit of detail about the way the law regulates music.",
        "At the time that Edison and Henri Fourneaux invented machines for reproducing \nmusic (Edison the phonograph, Fourneaux the player piano), the law gave \ncomposers the exclusive right to control copies of their music and the exclusive \nright to control public performances of their music. In other words, in 1900, if \nI wanted a copy of Phil Russel’s 1899 hit Happy Mose, the law said I would \nhave to pay for the right to get a copy of the musical score, and I would also \nhave to pay for the right to perform it publicly.",
        "But what if I wanted to record Happy Mose, using Edison’s phonograph or \nFourneaux’s player piano? Here the law stumbled. It was clear enough that I \nwould have to buy any copy of the musical score that I performed in making this \nrecording. And it was clear enough that I would have to pay for any public \nperformance of the work I was recording. But it wasn’t totally clear that I \nwould have to pay for a public performance if I recorded the song in my own \nhouse (even today, you don’t owe the Beatles anything if you sing their songs in \nthe shower), or if I recorded the song from memory (copies in your brain are \nnotyet regulated by copyright law). So if I simply sang the song into a \nrecording device in the privacy of my own home, it wasn’t clear that I owed the \ncomposer anything. And more importantly, it wasn’t clear whether I owed the \ncomposer anything if I then made copies of those recordings. Because of this gap \nin the law, then, I could effectively pirate someone else’s song without paying \nits composer anything.",
        "The composers (and publishers) were none too happy about this capacity to \npirate. As South Dakota senator Alfred Kittredge put it,",
        "Imagine the injustice of the thing. A composer writes a song or an opera. A \npublisher buys at great expense the rights to the same and copyrights it. Along \ncome the phonographic companies and companies who cut music rolls and \ndeliberately steal the work of the brain of the composer and publisher without \nany regard for [their] rights. [4]",
        "The innovators who developed the technology to record other people’s works were \nsponging upon the toil, the work, the talent, and genius of American \ncomposers, [5] and the music publishing industry” was thereby at the complete \nmercy of this one pirate. [6] As John Philip Sousa put it, in as direct a way \nas possible, When they make money out of my pieces, I want a share of it. [7]",
        "These arguments have familiar echoes in the wars of our day. So, too, do the \narguments on the other side. The innovators who developed the player piano \nargued that it is perfectly demonstrable that the introduction of automatic \nmusic players has not deprived any composer of anything he had before their \nintroduction. Rather, the machines increased the sales of sheet music. [8] In \nany case, the innovators argued, the job of Congress was to consider first the \ninterest of [the public], whom they represent, and whose servants they are. \nAll talk about ’theft,’ the general counsel of the American Graphophone \nCompany wrote, is the merest claptrap, for there exists no property in ideas \nmusical, literary or artistic, except as defined by statute. [9]",
        "The law soon resolved this battle in favor of the composer and the recording \nartist. Congress amended the law to make sure that composers would be paid for \nthe mechanical reproductions of their music. But rather than simply granting \nthe composer complete control over the right to make mechanical reproductions, \nCongress gave recording artists a right to record the music, at a price set by \nCongress, once the composer allowed it to be recorded once. This is the part of \ncopyright law that makes cover songs possible. Once a composer authorizes a \nrecording of his song, others are free to record the same song, so long as they \npay the original composer a fee set by the law.",
        "American law ordinarily calls this a compulsory license, but I will refer to \nit as a statutory license. A statutory license is a license whose key terms \nare set by law. After Congress’s amendment of the Copyright Act in 1909, record \ncompanies were free to distribute copies of recordings so long as they paid the \ncomposer (or copyright holder) the fee set by the statute.",
        "This is an exception within the law of copyright. When John Grisham writes a \nnovel, a publisher is free to publish that novel only if Grisham gives the \npublisher permission. Grisham, in turn, is free to charge whatever he wants for \nthat permission. The price to publish Grisham is thus set by Grisham, and \ncopyright law ordinarily says you have no permission to use Grisham’s work \nexcept with permission of Grisham.",
        "But the law governing recordings gives recording artists less. And thus, in \neffect, the law subsidizes the recording industry through a kind of piracyby \ngiving recording artists a weaker right than it otherwise gives creative \nauthors. The Beatles have less control over their creative work than Grisham \ndoes. And the beneficiaries of this less control are the recording industry and \nthe public. The recording industry gets something of value for less than it \notherwise would pay; the public gets access to a much wider range of musical \ncreativity. Indeed, Congress was quite explicit about its reasons for granting \nthis right. Its fear was the monopoly power of rights holders, and that that \npower would stifle follow-on creativity. [10]",
        "While the recording industry has been quite coy about this recently, \nhistorically it has been quite a supporter of the statutory license for records. \nAs a 1967 report from the House Committee on the Judiciary relates,",
        "the record producers argued vigorously that the compulsory license system must \nbe retained. They asserted that the record industry is a half-billion-dollar \nbusiness of great economic importance in the United States and throughout the \nworld; records today are the principal means of disseminating music, and this \ncreates special problems, since performers need unhampered access to musical \nmaterial on nondiscriminatory terms. Historically, the record producers pointed \nout, there were no recording rights before 1909 and the 1909 statute adopted the \ncompulsory license as a deliberate anti-monopoly condition on the grant of these \nrights. They argue that the result has been an outpouring of recorded music, \nwith the public being given lower prices, improved quality, and a greater \nchoice. [11]",
        "By limiting the rights musicians have, by partially pirating their creative \nwork, the record producers, and the public, benefit.",
        "Radio",
        "Radio was also born of piracy.",
        "When a radio station plays a record on the air, that constitutes a public \nperformance of the composer’s work. [12] As I described above, the law gives \nthe composer (or copyright holder) an exclusive right to public performances of \nhis work. The radio station thus owes the composer money for that performance.",
        "But when the radio station plays a record, it is not only performing a copy of \nthe composer’s work. The radio station is also performing a copy of the \n/recording artist’s work. It’s one thing to have Happy Birthday sung on the \nradio by the local children’s choir; it’s quite another to have it sung by the \nRolling Stones or Lyle Lovett. The recording artist is adding to the value of \nthe composition performed on the radio station. And if the law were perfectly \nconsistent, the radio station would have to pay the recording artist for his \nwork, just as it pays the composer of the music for his work.",
        "But it doesn’t. Under the law governing radio performances, the radio station \ndoes not have to pay the recording artist. The radio station need only pay the \ncomposer. The radio station thus gets a bit of something for nothing. It gets to \nperform the recording artist’s work for free, even if it must pay the composer \nsomething for the privilege of playing the song.",
        "This difference can be huge. Imagine you compose a piece of music. Imagine it is \nyour first. You own the exclusive right to authorize public performances of that \nmusic. So if Madonna wants to sing your song in public, she has to get your \npermission.",
        "Imagine she does sing your song, and imagine she likes it a lot. She then \ndecides to make a recording of your song, and it becomes a top hit. Under our \nlaw, every time a radio station plays your song, you get some money. But Madonna \ngets nothing, save the indirect effect on the sale of her CDs. The public \nperformance of her recording is not a protected right. The radio station thus \ngets to pirate the value of Madonna’s work without paying her anything.",
        "No doubt, one might argue that, on balance, the recording artists benefit. On \naverage, the promotion they get is worth more than the performance rights they \ngive up. Maybe. But even if so, the law ordinarily gives the creator the right \nto make this choice. By making the choice for him or her, the law gives the \nradio station the right to take something for nothing.",
        "Cable TV",
        "Cable TV was also born of a kind of piracy.",
        "When cable entrepreneurs first started wiring communities with cable television \nin 1948, most refused to pay broadcasters for the content that they echoed to \ntheir customers. Even when the cable companies started selling access to \ntelevision broadcasts, they refused to pay for what they sold. Cable companies \nwere thus Napsterizing broadcasters’ content, but more egregiously than anything \nNapster ever didNapster never charged for the content it enabled others to give \naway.",
        "Broadcasters and copyright owners were quick to attack this theft. Rosel Hyde, \nchairman of the FCC, viewed the practice as a kind of unfair and potentially \ndestructive competition. [13] There may have been a public interest in \nspreading the reach of cable TV, but as Douglas Anello, general counsel to the \nNational Association of Broadcasters, asked Senator Quentin Burdick during \ntestimony, Does public interest dictate that you use somebody else’s property? \n[14] As another broadcaster put it,",
        "The extraordinary thing about the CATV business is that it is the only business \nI know of where the product that is being sold is not paid for. [15]",
        "Again, the demand of the copyright holders seemed reasonable enough:",
        "All we are asking for is a very simple thing, that people who now take our \nproperty for nothing pay for it. We are trying to stop piracy and I don’t think \nthere is any lesser word to describe it. I think there are harsher words which \nwould fit it. [16]",
        "These were free-ride[rs], Screen Actor’s Guild president Charlton Heston said, \nwho were depriving actors of compensation. [17]",
        "But again, there was another side to the debate. As Assistant Attorney General \nEdwin Zimmerman put it,",
        "Our point here is that unlike the problem of whether you have any copyright \nprotection at all, the problem here is whether copyright holders who are already \ncompensated, who already have a monopoly, should be permitted to extend that \nmonopoly. ... The question here is how much compensation they should have and \nhow far back they should carry their right to compensation. [18]",
        "Copyright owners took the cable companies to court. Twice the Supreme Court held \nthat the cable companies owed the copyright owners nothing.",
        "It took Congress almost thirty years before it resolved the question of whether \ncable companies had to pay for the content they pirated. In the end, Congress \nresolved this question in the same way that it resolved the question about \nrecord players and player pianos. Yes, cable companies would have to pay for the \ncontent that they broadcast; but the price they would have to pay was not set by \nthe copyright owner. The price was set by law, so that the broadcasters couldn’t \nexercise veto power over the emerging technologies of cable. Cable companies \nthus built their empire in part upon a piracy of the value created by \nbroadcasters’ content.",
        "These separate stories sing a common theme. If piracy means using value from \nsomeone else’s creative property without permission from that creatoras it is \nincreasingly described today [19]then every industry affected by copyright \ntoday is the product and beneficiary of a certain kind of piracy. Film, records, \nradio, cable TV. ... The list is long and could well be expanded. Every \ngeneration welcomes the pirates from the last. Every generationuntil now.",
        "There is piracy of copyrighted material. Lots of it. This piracy comes in many \nforms. The most significant is commercial piracy, the unauthorized taking of \nother people’s content within a commercial context. Despite the many \njustifications that are offered in its defense, this taking is wrong. No one \nshould condone it, and the law should stop it.",
        "But as well as copy-shop piracy, there is another kind of taking” that is more \ndirectly related to the Internet. That taking, too, seems wrong to many, and it \nis wrong much of the time. Before we paint this taking piracy, however, we \nshould understand its nature a bit more. For the harm of this taking is \nsignificantly more ambiguous than outright copying, and the law should account \nfor that ambiguity, as it has so often done in the past.",
        "Piracy I",
        "All across the world, but especially in Asia and Eastern Europe, there are \nbusinesses that do nothing but take others people’s copyrighted content, copy \nit, and sell itall without the permission of a copyright owner. The recording \nindustry estimates that it loses about $4.6 billion every year to physical \npiracy [1] (that works out to one in three CDs sold worldwide). The MPAA \nestimates that it loses $3 billion annually worldwide to piracy.",
        "This is piracy plain and simple. Nothing in the argument of this book, nor in \nthe argument that most people make when talking about the subject of this book, \nshould draw into doubt this simple point: This piracy is wrong.",
        "Which is not to say that excuses and justifications couldn’t be made for it. We \ncould, for example, remind ourselves that for the first one hundred years of the \nAmerican Republic, America did not honor foreign copyrights. We were born, in \nthis sense, a pirate nation. It might therefore seem hypocritical for us to \ninsist so strongly that other developing nations treat as wrong what we, for the \nfirst hundred years of our existence, treated as right.",
        "That excuse isn’t terribly strong. Technically, our law did not ban the taking \nof foreign works. It explicitly limited itself to American works. Thus the \nAmerican publishers who published foreign works without the permission of \nforeign authors were not violating any rule. The copy shops in Asia, by \ncontrast, are violating Asian law. Asian law does protect foreign copyrights, \nand the actions of the copy shops violate that law. So the wrong of piracy that \nthey engage in is not just a moral wrong, but a legal wrong, and not just an \ninternationally legal wrong, but a locally legal wrong as well.",
        "True, these local rules have, in effect, been imposed upon these countries. No \ncountry can be part of the world economy and choose not to protect copyright \ninternationally. We may have been born a pirate nation, but we will not allow \nany other nation to have a similar childhood.",
        "If a country is to be treated as a sovereign, however, then its laws are its \nlaws regardless of their source. The international law under which these nations \nlive gives them some opportunities to escape the burden of intellectual property \nlaw. [2] In my view, more developing nations should take advantage of that \nopportunity, but when they don’t, then their laws should be respected. And under \nthe laws of these nations, this piracy is wrong.",
        "Alternatively, we could try to excuse this piracy by noting that in any case, it \ndoes no harm to the industry. The Chinese who get access to American CDs at 50 \ncents a copy are not people who would have bought those American CDs at $15 a \ncopy. So no one really has any less money than they otherwise would have had. \n[3]",
        "This is often true (though I have friends who have purchased many thousands of \npirated DVDs who certainly have enough money to pay for the content they have \ntaken), and it does mitigate to some degree the harm caused by such taking. \nExtremists in this debate love to say, You wouldn’t go into Barnes & Noble and \ntake a book off of the shelf without paying; why should it be any different with \non-line music? The difference is, of course, that when you take a book from \nBarnes & Noble, it has one less book to sell. By contrast, when you take an MP3 \nfrom a computer network, there is not one less CD that can be sold. The physics \nof piracy of the intangible are different from the physics of piracy of the \ntangible.",
        "This argument is still very weak. However, although copyright is a property \nright of a very special sort, it is a property right. Like all property \nrights, the copyright gives the owner the right to decide the terms under which \ncontent is shared. If the copyright owner doesn’t want to sell, she doesn’t have \nto. There are exceptions: important statutory licenses that apply to copyrighted \ncontent regardless of the wish of the copyright owner. Those licenses give \npeople the right to take copyrighted content whether or not the copyright \nowner wants to sell. But where the law does not give people the right to take \ncontent, it is wrong to take that content even if the wrong does no harm. If we \nhave a property system, and that system is properly balanced to the technology \nof a time, then it is wrong to take property without the permission of a \nproperty owner. That is exactly what property means.",
        "Finally, we could try to excuse this piracy with the argument that the piracy \nactually helps the copyright owner. When the Chinese steal” Windows, that makes \nthe Chinese dependent on Microsoft. Microsoft loses the value of the software \nthat was taken. But it gains users who are used to life in the Microsoft world. \nOver time, as the nation grows more wealthy, more and more people will buy \nsoftware rather than steal it. And hence over time, because that buying will \nbenefit Microsoft, Microsoft benefits from the piracy. If instead of pirating \nMicrosoft Windows, the Chinese used the free GNU/Linux operating system, then \nthese Chinese users would not eventually be buying Microsoft. Without piracy, \nthen, Microsoft would lose.",
        "This argument, too, is somewhat true. The addiction strategy is a good one. Many \nbusinesses practice it. Some thrive because of it. Law students, for example, \nare given free access to the two largest legal databases. The companies \nmarketing both hope the students will become so used to their service that they \nwill want to use it and not the other when they become lawyers (and must pay \nhigh subscription fees).",
        "Still, the argument is not terribly persuasive. We don’t give the alcoholic a \ndefense when he steals his first beer, merely because that will make it more \nlikely that he will buy the next three. Instead, we ordinarily allow businesses \nto decide for themselves when it is best to give their product away. If \nMicrosoft fears the competition of GNU/Linux, then Microsoft can give its \nproduct away, as it did, for example, with Internet Explorer to fight Netscape. \nA property right means giving the property owner the right to say who gets \naccess to whatat least ordinarily. And if the law properly balances the rights \nof the copyright owner with the rights of access, then violating the law is \nstill wrong.",
        "Thus, while I understand the pull of these justifications for piracy, and I \ncertainly see the motivation, in my view, in the end, these efforts at \njustifying commercial piracy simply don’t cut it. This kind of piracy is rampant \nand just plain wrong. It doesn’t transform the content it steals; it doesn’t \ntransform the market it competes in. It merely gives someone access to something \nthat the law says he should not have. Nothing has changed to draw that law into \ndoubt. This form of piracy is flat out wrong.",
        "But as the examples from the four chapters that introduced this part suggest, \neven if some piracy is plainly wrong, not all piracy is. Or at least, not all \npiracy is wrong if that term is understood in the way it is increasingly used \ntoday. Many kinds of piracy are useful and productive, to produce either new \ncontent or new ways of doing business. Neither our tradition nor any tradition \nhas ever banned all piracy in that sense of the term.",
        "This doesn’t mean that there are no questions raised by the latest piracy \nconcern, peer-to-peer file sharing. But it does mean that we need to understand \nthe harm in peer-to-peer sharing a bit more before we condemn it to the gallows \nwith the charge of piracy.",
        "For (1) like the original Hollywood, p2p sharing escapes an overly controlling \nindustry; and (2) like the original recording industry, it simply exploits a new \nway to distribute content; but (3) unlike cable TV, no one is selling the \ncontent that is shared on p2p services.",
        "These differences distinguish p2p sharing from true piracy. They should push us \nto find a way to protect artists while enabling this sharing to survive.",
        "Piracy II",
        "The key to the piracy that the law aims to quash is a use that rob[s] the \nauthor of [his] profit. [4] This means we must determine whether and how much \np2p sharing harms before we know how strongly the law should seek to either \nprevent it or find an alternative to assure the author of his profit.",
        "Peer-to-peer sharing was made famous by Napster. But the inventors of the \nNapster technology had not made any major technological innovations. Like every \ngreat advance in innovation on the Internet (and, arguably, off the Internet as \nwell [5]), Shawn Fanning and crew had simply put together components that had \nbeen developed independently.",
        "The result was spontaneous combustion. Launched in July 1999, Napster amassed \nover 10 million users within nine months. After eighteen months, there were \nclose to 80 million registered users of the system. [6] Courts quickly shut \nNapster down, but other services emerged to take its place. (Kazaa is currently \nthe most popular p2p service. It boasts over 100 million members.) These \nservices’ systems are different architecturally, though not very different in \nfunction: Each enables users to make content available to any number of other \nusers. With a p2p system, you can share your favorite songs with your best \nfriend or your 20,000 best friends.",
        "According to a number of estimates, a huge proportion of Americans have tasted \nfile-sharing technology. A study by Ipsos-Insight in September 2002 estimated \nthat 60 million Americans had downloaded music28 percent of Americans older \nthan 12. [7] A survey by the NPD group quoted in The New York Times estimated \nthat 43 million citizens used file-sharing networks to exchange content in May \n2003. [8] The vast majority of these are not kids. Whatever the actual figure, a \nmassive quantity of content is being taken on these networks. The ease and \ninexpensiveness of file-sharing networks have inspired millions to enjoy music \nin a way that they hadn’t before.",
        "Some of this enjoying involves copyright infringement. Some of it does not. And \neven among the part that is technically copyright infringement, calculating the \nactual harm to copyright owners is more complicated than one might think. So \nconsidera bit more carefully than the polarized voices around this debate \nusually dothe kinds of sharing that file sharing enables, and the kinds of harm \nit entails.",
        "File sharers share different kinds of content. We can divide these different \nkinds into four types.",
        "A. There are some who use sharing networks as substitutes for purchasing \ncontent. Thus, when a new Madonna CD is released, rather than buying the CD, \nthese users simply take it. We might quibble about whether everyone who takes it \nwould actually have bought it if sharing didn’t make it available for free. Most \nprobably wouldn’t have, but clearly there are some who would. The latter are the \ntarget of category A: users who download instead of purchasing.\nB. There are some who use sharing networks to sample music before purchasing it. \nThus, a friend sends another friend an MP3 of an artist he’s not heard of. The \nother friend then buys CDs by that artist. This is a kind of targeted \nadvertising, quite likely to succeed. If the friend recommending the album gains \nnothing from a bad recommendation, then one could expect that the \nrecommendations will actually be quite good. The net effect of this sharing \ncould increase the quantity of music purchased.\nC. There are many who use sharing networks to get access to copyrighted content \nthat is no longer sold or that they would not have purchased because the \ntransaction costs off the Net are too high. This use of sharing networks is \namong the most rewarding for many. Songs that were part of your childhood but \nhave long vanished from the marketplace magically appear again on the network. \n(One friend told me that when she discovered Napster, she spent a solid weekend \nrecalling” old songs. She was astonished at the range and mix of content that \nwas available.) For content not sold, this is still technically a violation of \ncopyright, though because the copyright owner is not selling the content \nanymore, the economic harm is zerothe same harm that occurs when I sell my \ncollection of 1960s 45-rpm records to a local collector.\nD. Finally, there are many who use sharing networks to get access to content \nthat is not copyrighted or that the copyright owner wants to give away.",
        "How do these different types of sharing balance out?",
        "Let’s start with some simple but important points. From the perspective of the \nlaw, only type D sharing is clearly legal. From the perspective of economics, \nonly type A sharing is clearly harmful. [9] Type B sharing is illegal but \nplainly beneficial. Type C sharing is illegal, yet good for society (since more \nexposure to music is good) and harmless to the artist (since the work is not \notherwise available). So how sharing matters on balance is a hard question to \nanswerand certainly much more difficult than the current rhetoric around the \nissue suggests.",
        "Whether on balance sharing is harmful depends importantly on how harmful type A \nsharing is. Just as Edison complained about Hollywood, composers complained \nabout piano rolls, recording artists complained about radio, and broadcasters \ncomplained about cable TV, the music industry complains that type A sharing is a \nkind of theft that is devastating the industry.",
        "While the numbers do suggest that sharing is harmful, how harmful is harder to \nreckon. It has long been the recording industry’s practice to blame technology \nfor any drop in sales. The history of cassette recording is a good example. As a \nstudy by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young put it, Rather than exploiting this new, \npopular technology, the labels fought it. [10] The labels claimed that every \nalbum taped was an album unsold, and when record sales fell by 11.4 percent in \n1981, the industry claimed that its point was proved. Technology was the \nproblem, and banning or regulating technology was the answer.",
        "Yet soon thereafter, and before Congress was given an opportunity to enact \nregulation, MTV was launched, and the industry had a record turnaround. In the \nend, Cap Gemini concludes, the crisis’ ... was not the fault of the tapers\nwho did not [stop after MTV came into being]but had to a large extent resulted \nfrom stagnation in musical innovation at the major labels. [11]",
        "But just because the industry was wrong before does not mean it is wrong today. \nTo evaluate the real threat that p2p sharing presents to the industry in \nparticular, and society in generalor at least the society that inherits the \ntradition that gave us the film industry, the record industry, the radio \nindustry, cable TV, and the VCRthe question is not simply whether type A \nsharing is harmful. The question is also how harmful type A sharing is, and \nhow beneficial the other types of sharing are.",
        "We start to answer this question by focusing on the net harm, from the \nstandpoint of the industry as a whole, that sharing networks cause. The net \nharm to the industry as a whole is the amount by which type A sharing exceeds \ntype B. If the record companies sold more records through sampling than they \nlost through substitution, then sharing networks would actually benefit music \ncompanies on balance. They would therefore have little static reason to resist \nthem.",
        "Could that be true? Could the industry as a whole be gaining because of file \nsharing? Odd as that might sound, the data about CD sales actually suggest it \nmight be close.",
        "In 2002, the RIAA reported that CD sales had fallen by 8.9 percent, from 882 \nmillion to 803 million units; revenues fell 6.7 percent. [12] This confirms a \ntrend over the past few years. The RIAA blames Internet piracy for the trend, \nthough there are many other causes that could account for this drop. SoundScan, \nfor example, reports a more than 20 percent drop in the number of CDs released \nsince 1999. That no doubt accounts for some of the decrease in sales. Rising \nprices could account for at least some of the loss. From 1999 to 2001, the \naverage price of a CD rose 7.2 percent, from $13.04 to $14.19. [13] Competition \nfrom other forms of media could also account for some of the decline. As Jane \nBlack of BusinessWeek notes, The soundtrack to the film High Fidelity has a \nlist price of $18.98. You could get the whole movie [on DVD] for $19.99. [14]",
        "But let’s assume the RIAA is right, and all of the decline in CD sales is \nbecause of Internet sharing. Here’s the rub: In the same period that the RIAA \nestimates that 803 million CDs were sold, the RIAA estimates that 2.1 billion \nCDs were downloaded for free. Thus, although 2.6 times the total number of CDs \nsold were downloaded for free, sales revenue fell by just 6.7 percent.",
        "There are too many different things happening at the same time to explain these \nnumbers definitively, but one conclusion is unavoidable: The recording industry \nconstantly asks, What’s the difference between downloading a song and stealing \na CD?but their own numbers reveal the difference. If I steal a CD, then there \nis one less CD to sell. Every taking is a lost sale. But on the basis of the \nnumbers the RIAA provides, it is absolutely clear that the same is not true of \ndownloads. If every download were a lost saleif every use of Kazaa rob[bed] \nthe author of [his] profitthen the industry would have suffered a 100 percent \ndrop in sales last year, not a 7 percent drop. If 2.6 times the number of CDs \nsold were downloaded for free, and yet sales revenue dropped by just 6.7 \npercent, then there is a huge difference between downloading a song and \nstealing a CD.",
        "These are the harmsalleged and perhaps exaggerated but, let’s assume, real. \nWhat of the benefits? File sharing may impose costs on the recording industry. \nWhat value does it produce in addition to these costs?",
        "One benefit is type C sharingmaking available content that is technically still \nunder copyright but is no longer commercially available. This is not a small \ncategory of content. There are millions of tracks that are no longer \ncommercially available. [15] And while it’s conceivable that some of this \ncontent is not available because the artist producing the content doesn’t want \nit to be made available, the vast majority of it is unavailable solely because \nthe publisher or the distributor has decided it no longer makes economic sense \n/to the company to make it available.",
        "In real spacelong before the Internetthe market had a simple response to this \nproblem: used book and record stores. There are thousands of used book and used \nrecord stores in America today.16 These stores buy content from owners, then \nsell the content they buy. And under American copyright law, when they buy and \nsell this content, even if the content is still under copyright, the copyright \nowner doesn’t get a dime. Used book and record stores are commercial entities; \ntheir owners make money from the content they sell; but as with cable companies \nbefore statutory licensing, they don’t have to pay the copyright owner for the \ncontent they sell.",
        "Type C sharing, then, is very much like used book stores or used record stores. \nIt is different, of course, because the person making the content available \nisn’t making money from making the content available. It is also different, of \ncourse, because in real space, when I sell a record, I don’t have it anymore, \nwhile in cyberspace, when someone shares my 1949 recording of Bernstein’s Two \nLove Songs, I still have it. That difference would matter economically if the \nowner of the 1949 copyright were selling the record in competition to my \nsharing. But we’re talking about the class of content that is not currently \ncommercially available. The Internet is making it available, through cooperative \nsharing, without competing with the market.",
        "It may well be, all things considered, that it would be better if the copyright \nowner got something from this trade. But just because it may well be better, it \ndoesn’t follow that it would be good to ban used book stores. Or put \ndifferently, if you think that type C sharing should be stopped, do you think \nthat libraries and used book stores should be shut as well?",
        "Finally, and perhaps most importantly, file-sharing networks enable type D \nsharing to occurthe sharing of content that copyright owners want to have \nshared or for which there is no continuing copyright. This sharing clearly \nbenefits authors and society. Science fiction author Cory Doctorow, for example, \nreleased his first novel, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, both free on-line \nand in bookstores on the same day. His (and his publisher’s) thinking was that \nthe on-line distribution would be a great advertisement for the real book. \nPeople would read part on-line, and then decide whether they liked the book or \nnot. If they liked it, they would be more likely to buy it. Doctorow’s content \nis type D content. If sharing networks enable his work to be spread, then both \nhe and society are better off. (Actually, much better off: It is a great book!)",
        "Likewise for work in the public domain: This sharing benefits society with no \nlegal harm to authors at all. If efforts to solve the problem of type A sharing \ndestroy the opportunity for type D sharing, then we lose something important in \norder to protect type A content.",
        "The point throughout is this: While the recording industry understandably says, \nThis is how much we’ve lost, we must also ask, How much has society gained \nfrom p2p sharing? What are the efficiencies? What is the content that otherwise \nwould be unavailable?",
        "For unlike the piracy I described in the first section of this chapter, much of \nthe piracy that file sharing enables is plainly legal and good. And like the \npiracy I described in chapter 4, much of this piracy is motivated by a new way \nof spreading content caused by changes in the technology of distribution. Thus, \nconsistent with the tradition that gave us Hollywood, radio, the recording \nindustry, and cable TV, the question we should be asking about file sharing is \nhow best to preserve its benefits while minimizing (to the extent possible) the \nwrongful harm it causes artists. The question is one of balance. The law should \nseek that balance, and that balance will be found only with time.",
        "But isn’t the war just a war against illegal sharing? Isn’t the target just \nwhat you call type A sharing?",
        "You would think. And we should hope. But so far, it is not. The effect of the \nwar purportedly on type A sharing alone has been felt far beyond that one class \nof sharing. That much is obvious from the Napster case itself. When Napster told \nthe district court that it had developed a technology to block the transfer of \n99.4 percent of identified infringing material, the district court told counsel \nfor Napster 99.4 percent was not good enough. Napster had to push the \ninfringements down to zero. [17]",
        "If 99.4 percent is not good enough, then this is a war on file-sharing \ntechnologies, not a war on copyright infringement. There is no way to assure \nthat a p2p system is used 100 percent of the time in compliance with the law, \nany more than there is a way to assure that 100 percent of VCRs or 100 percent \nof Xerox machines or 100 percent of handguns are used in compliance with the \nlaw. Zero tolerance means zero p2p. The court’s ruling means that we as a \nsociety must lose the benefits of p2p, even for the totally legal and beneficial \nuses they serve, simply to assure that there are zero copyright infringements \ncaused by p2p.",
        "Zero tolerance has not been our history. It has not produced the content \nindustry that we know today. The history of American law has been a process of \nbalance. As new technologies changed the way content was distributed, the law \nadjusted, after some time, to the new technology. In this adjustment, the law \nsought to ensure the legitimate rights of creators while protecting innovation. \nSometimes this has meant more rights for creators. Sometimes less.",
        "So, as we’ve seen, when mechanical reproduction threatened the interests of \ncomposers, Congress balanced the rights of composers against the interests of \nthe recording industry. It granted rights to composers, but also to the \nrecording artists: Composers were to be paid, but at a price set by Congress. \nBut when radio started broadcasting the recordings made by these recording \nartists, and they complained to Congress that their creative property was not \nbeing respected (since the radio station did not have to pay them for the \ncreativity it broadcast), Congress rejected their claim. An indirect benefit was \nenough.",
        "Cable TV followed the pattern of record albums. When the courts rejected the \nclaim that cable broadcasters had to pay for the content they rebroadcast, \nCongress responded by giving broadcasters a right to compensation, but at a \nlevel set by the law. It likewise gave cable companies the right to the content, \nso long as they paid the statutory price.",
        "This compromise, like the compromise affecting records and player pianos, served \ntwo important goalsindeed, the two central goals of any copyright legislation. \nFirst, the law assured that new innovators would have the freedom to develop new \nways to deliver content. Second, the law assured that copyright holders would be \npaid for the content that was distributed. One fear was that if Congress simply \nrequired cable TV to pay copyright holders whatever they demanded for their \ncontent, then copyright holders associated with broadcasters would use their \npower to stifle this new technology, cable. But if Congress had permitted cable \nto use broadcasters’ content for free, then it would have unfairly subsidized \ncable. Thus Congress chose a path that would assure compensation without \ngiving the past (broadcasters) control over the future (cable).",
        "In the same year that Congress struck this balance, two major producers and \ndistributors of film content filed a lawsuit against another technology, the \nvideo tape recorder (VTR, or as we refer to them today, VCRs) that Sony had \nproduced, the Betamax. Disney’s and Universal’s claim against Sony was \nrelatively simple: Sony produced a device, Disney and Universal claimed, that \nenabled consumers to engage in copyright infringement. Because the device that \nSony built had a record button, the device could be used to record copyrighted \nmovies and shows. Sony was therefore benefiting from the copyright infringement \nof its customers. It should therefore, Disney and Universal claimed, be \npartially liable for that infringement.",
        "There was something to Disney’s and Universal’s claim. Sony did decide to design \nits machine to make it very simple to record television shows. It could have \nbuilt the machine to block or inhibit any direct copying from a television \nbroadcast. Or possibly, it could have built the machine to copy only if there \nwere a special copy me” signal on the line. It was clear that there were many \ntelevision shows that did not grant anyone permission to copy. Indeed, if anyone \nhad asked, no doubt the majority of shows would not have authorized copying. And \nin the face of this obvious preference, Sony could have designed its system to \nminimize the opportunity for copyright infringement. It did not, and for that, \nDisney and Universal wanted to hold it responsible for the architecture it \nchose.",
        "MPAA president Jack Valenti became the studios’ most vocal champion. Valenti \ncalled VCRs tapeworms. He warned, When there are 20, 30, 40 million of these \nVCRs in the land, we will be invaded by millions of ’tapeworms,’ eating away at \nthe very heart and essence of the most precious asset the copyright owner has, \nhis copyright. [18] One does not have to be trained in sophisticated marketing \nand creative judgment, he told Congress, to understand the devastation on the \nafter-theater marketplace caused by the hundreds of millions of tapings that \nwill adversely impact on the future of the creative community in this country. \nIt is simply a question of basic economics and plain common sense. [19] Indeed, \nas surveys would later show, 45 percent of VCR owners had movie libraries of ten \nvideos or more [20]a use the Court would later hold was not fair. By \nallowing VCR owners to copy freely by the means of an exemption from copyright \ninfringement without creating a mechanism to compensate copyright owners, \nValenti testified, Congress would take from the owners the very essence of \ntheir property: the exclusive right to control who may use their work, that is, \nwho may copy it and thereby profit from its reproduction. [21]",
        "It took eight years for this case to be resolved by the Supreme Court. In the \ninterim, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes Hollywood in its \njurisdictionleading Judge Alex Kozinski, who sits on that court, refers to it \nas the Hollywood Circuitheld that Sony would be liable for the copyright \ninfringement made possible by its machines. Under the Ninth Circuit’s rule, this \ntotally familiar technologywhich Jack Valenti had called the Boston Strangler \nof the American film industry (worse yet, it was a Japanese Boston Strangler \nof the American film industry)was an illegal technology. [22]",
        "But the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit. And in its \nreversal, the Court clearly articulated its understanding of when and whether \ncourts should intervene in such disputes. As the Court wrote,",
        "Sound policy, as well as history, supports our consistent deference to Congress \nwhen major technological innovations alter the market for copyrighted materials. \nCongress has the constitutional authority and the institutional ability to \naccommodate fully the varied permutations of competing interests that are \ninevitably implicated by such new technology. [23]",
        "Congress was asked to respond to the Supreme Court’s decision. But as with the \nplea of recording artists about radio broadcasts, Congress ignored the request. \nCongress was convinced that American film got enough, this taking \nnotwithstanding.",
        "If we put these cases together, a pattern is clear:",
        "CASE\t\tWHOSE VALUE\tRESPONSE OF\tRESPONSE OF CONGRESS\n\t\tWAS PIRATED \tTHE COURTS",
        "Recordings\tComposers\t\tNo protection\t\tStatutory License\nRadio\t\tRecording Artists\tN/A\t\t\tNothing\nCable TV\tBroadcasters\t\tNo protection\t\tStatutory License\nVCR\t\tFilm Creators\tNo protection\t\tNothing",
        "In each case throughout our history, a new technology changed the way content \nwas distributed. [24] In each case, throughout our history, that change meant \nthat someone got a free ride on someone else’s work.",
        "In none of these cases did either the courts or Congress eliminate all free \nriding. In none of these cases did the courts or Congress insist that the law \nshould assure that the copyright holder get all the value that his copyright \ncreated. In every case, the copyright owners complained of piracy. In every \ncase, Congress acted to recognize some of the legiti macy in the behavior of the \npirates. In each case, Congress allowed some new technology to benefit from \ncontent made before. It balanced the interests at stake.",
        "When you think across these examples, and the other examples that make up the \nfirst four chapters of this section, this balance makes sense. Was Walt Disney a \npirate? Would doujinshi be better if creators had to ask permission? Should \ntools that enable others to capture and spread images as a way to cultivate or \ncriticize our culture be better regulated? Is it really right that building a \nsearch engine should expose you to $15 million in damages? Would it have been \nbetter if Edison had controlled film? Should every cover band have to hire a \nlawyer to get permission to record a song?",
        "We could answer yes to each of these questions, but our tradition has answered \nno. In our tradition, as the Supreme Court has stated, copyright has never \naccorded the copyright owner complete control over all possible uses of his \nwork. [25] Instead, the particular uses that the law regulates have been \ndefined by balancing the good that comes from granting an exclusive right \nagainst the burdens such an exclusive right creates. And this balancing has \nhistorically been done after a technology has matured, or settled into the mix \nof technologies that facilitate the distribution of content.",
        "We should be doing the same thing today. The technology of the Internet is \nchanging quickly. The way people connect to the Internet (wires vs. wireless) is \nchanging very quickly. No doubt the network should not become a tool for \nstealing from artists. But neither should the law become a tool to entrench \none particular way in which artists (or more accurately, distributors) get paid. \nAs I describe in some detail in the last chapter of this book, we should be \nsecuring income to artists while we allow the market to secure the most \nefficient way to promote and distribute content. This will require changes in \nthe law, at least in the interim. These changes should be designed to balance \nthe protection of the law against the strong public interest that innovation \ncontinue.",
        "This is especially true when a new technology enables a vastly superior mode of \ndistribution. And this p2p has done. P2p technologies can be ideally efficient \nin moving content across a widely diverse network. Left to develop, they could \nmake the network vastly more efficient. Yet these potential public benefits, \nas John Schwartz writes in The New York Times, could be delayed in the P2P \nfight. [26]",
        "Yet when anyone begins to talk about balance, the copyright warriors raise a \ndifferent argument. All this hand waving about balance and incentives, they \nsay, misses a fundamental point. Our content, the warriors insist, is our \n/property. Why should we wait for Congress to ’rebalance’ our property rights? \nDo you have to wait before calling the police when your car has been stolen? And \nwhy should Congress deliberate at all about the merits of this theft? Do we ask \nwhether the car thief had a good use for the car before we arrest him?",
        "It is our property, the warriors insist. And it should be protected just as \nany other property is protected.",
        "The copyright warriors are right: A copyright is a kind of property. It can be \nowned and sold, and the law protects against its theft. Ordinarily, the \ncopyright owner gets to hold out for any price he wants. Markets reckon the \nsupply and demand that partially determine the price she can get.",
        "But in ordinary language, to call a copyright a property right is a bit \nmisleading, for the property of copyright is an odd kind of property. Indeed, \nthe very idea of property in any idea or any expression is very odd. I \nunderstand what I am taking when I take the picnic table you put in your \nbackyard. I am taking a thing, the picnic table, and after I take it, you don’t \nhave it. But what am I taking when I take the good idea you had to put a \npicnic table in the backyardby, for example, going to Sears, buying a table, \nand putting it in my backyard? What is the thing I am taking then?",
        "The point is not just about the thingness of picnic tables versus ideas, though \nthat’s an important difference. The point instead is that in the ordinary case\nindeed, in practically every case except for a narrow range of exceptionsideas \nreleased to the world are free. I don’t take anything from you when I copy the \nway you dressthough I might seem weird if I did it every day, and especially \nweird if you are a woman. Instead, as Thomas Jefferson said (and as is \nespecially true when I copy the way someone else dresses), He who receives an \nidea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who \nlights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. [1]",
        "The exceptions to free use are ideas and expressions within the reach of the law \nof patent and copyright, and a few other domains that I won’t discuss here. Here \nthe law says you can’t take my idea or expression without my permission: The law \nturns the intangible into property.",
        "But how, and to what extent, and in what formthe details, in other words\nmatter. To get a good sense of how this practice of turning the intangible into \nproperty emerged, we need to place this property in its proper context. [2]",
        "My strategy in doing this will be the same as my strategy in the preceding part. \nI offer four stories to help put the idea of copyright material is property in \ncontext. Where did the idea come from? What are its limits? How does it function \nin practice? After these stories, the significance of this true statement\ncopyright material is property will be a bit more clear, and its implications \nwill be revealed as quite different from the implications that the copyright \nwarriors would have us draw.",
        "William Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet in 1595. The play was first \npublished in 1597. It was the eleventh major play that Shakespeare had written. \nHe would continue to write plays through 1613, and the plays that he wrote have \ncontinued to define Anglo-American culture ever since. So deeply have the works \nof a sixteenth-century writer seeped into our culture that we often don’t even \nrecognize their source. I once overheard someone commenting on Kenneth Branagh’s \nadaptation of Henry V: I liked it, but Shakespeare is so full of clichés.",
        "In 1774, almost 180 years after Romeo and Juliet was written, the copy-right \nfor the work was still thought by many to be the exclusive right of a single \nLondon publisher, Jacob Tonson. [1] Tonson was the most prominent of a small \ngroup of publishers called the Conger [2] who controlled bookselling in England \nduring the eighteenth century. The Conger claimed a perpetual right to control \nthe copy of books that they had acquired from authors. That perpetual right \nmeant that no one else could publish copies of a book to which they held the \ncopyright. Prices of the classics were thus kept high; competition to produce \nbetter or cheaper editions was eliminated.",
        "Now, there’s something puzzling about the year 1774 to anyone who knows a little \nabout copyright law. The better-known year in the history of copyright is 1710, \nthe year that the British Parliament adopted the first copyright act. Known as \nthe Statute of Anne, the act stated that all published works would get a \ncopyright term of fourteen years, renewable once if the author was alive, and \nthat all works already published by 1710 would get a single term of twenty-one \nadditional years. [3] Under this law, Romeo and Juliet should have been free \nin 1731. So why was there any issue about it still being under Tonson’s control \nin 1774?",
        "The reason is that the English hadn’t yet agreed on what a copy-right was\nindeed, no one had. At the time the English passed the Statute of Anne, there \nwas no other legislation governing copyrights. The last law regulating \npublishers, the Licensing Act of 1662, had expired in 1695. That law gave \npublishers a monopoly over publishing, as a way to make it easier for the Crown \nto control what was published. But after it expired, there was no positive law \nthat said that the publishers, or Stationers, had an exclusive right to print \nbooks.",
        "There was no positive law, but that didn’t mean that there was no law. The \nAnglo-American legal tradition looks to both the words of legislatures and the \nwords of judges to know the rules that are to govern how people are to behave. \nWe call the words from legislatures positive law. We call the words from \njudges common law. The common law sets the background against which \nlegislatures legislate; the legislature, ordinarily, can trump that background \nonly if it passes a law to displace it. And so the real question after the \nlicensing statutes had expired was whether the common law protected a copyright, \nindependent of any positive law.",
        "This question was important to the publishers, or booksellers, as they were \ncalled, because there was growing competition from foreign publishers. The \nScottish, in particular, were increasingly publishing and exporting books to \nEngland. That competition reduced the profits of the Conger, which reacted by \ndemanding that Parliament pass a law to again give them exclusive control over \npublishing. That demand ultimately resulted in the Statute of Anne.",
        "The Statute of Anne granted the author or proprietor of a book an exclusive \nright to print that book. In an important limitation, however, and to the horror \nof the booksellers, the law gave the bookseller that right for a limited term. \nAt the end of that term, the copyright expired, and the work would then be \nfree and could be published by anyone. Or so the legislature is thought to have \nbelieved.",
        "Now, the thing to puzzle about for a moment is this: Why would Parliament limit \nthe exclusive right? Not why would they limit it to the particular limit they \nset, but why would they limit the right at all?",
        "For the booksellers, and the authors whom they represented, had a very strong \nclaim. Take Romeo and Juliet as an example: That play was written by \nShakespeare. It was his genius that brought it into the world. He didn’t take \nanybody’s property when he created this play (that’s a controversial claim, but \nnever mind), and by his creating this play, he didn’t make it any harder for \nothers to craft a play. So why is it that the law would ever allow someone else \nto come along and take Shakespeare’s play without his, or his estate’s, \npermission? What reason is there to allow someone else to steal Shakespeare’s \nwork?",
        "The answer comes in two parts. We first need to see something special about the \nnotion of copyright that existed at the time of the Statute of Anne. Second, \nwe have to see something important about booksellers.",
        "First, about copyright. In the last three hundred years, we have come to apply \nthe concept of copyright ever more broadly. But in 1710, it wasn’t so much a \nconcept as it was a very particular right. The copyright was born as a very \nspecific set of restrictions: It forbade others from reprinting a book. In 1710, \nthe copy-right was a right to use a particular machine to replicate a \nparticular work. It did not go beyond that very narrow right. It did not control \nany more generally how a work could be used. Today the right includes a large \ncollection of restrictions on the freedom of others: It grants the author the \nexclusive right to copy, the exclusive right to distribute, the exclusive right \nto perform, and so on.",
        "So, for example, even if the copyright to Shakespeare’s works were perpetual, \nall that would have meant under the original meaning of the term was that no one \ncould reprint Shakespeare’s work without the permission of the Shakespeare \nestate. It would not have controlled anything, for example, about how the work \ncould be performed, whether the work could be translated, or whether Kenneth \nBranagh would be allowed to make his films. The copy-right was only an \nexclusive right to printno less, of course, but also no more.",
        "Even that limited right was viewed with skepticism by the British. They had had \na long and ugly experience with exclusive rights, especially exclusive \nrights granted by the Crown. The English had fought a civil war in part about \nthe Crown’s practice of handing out monopoliesespecially monopolies for works \nthat already existed. King Henry VIII granted a patent to print the Bible and a \nmonopoly to Darcy to print playing cards. The English Parliament began to fight \nback against this power of the Crown. In 1656, it passed the Statute of \nMonopolies, limiting monopolies to patents for new inventions. And by 1710, \nParliament was eager to deal with the growing monopoly in publishing.",
        "Thus the copy-right, when viewed as a monopoly right, was naturally viewed as \na right that should be limited. (However convincing the claim that it’s my \nproperty, and I should have it forever, try sounding convincing when uttering, \nIt’s my monopoly, and I should have it forever.) The state would protect the \nexclusive right, but only so long as it benefited society. The British saw the \nharms from special-interest favors; they passed a law to stop them.",
        "Second, about booksellers. It wasn’t just that the copyright was a monopoly. It \nwas also that it was a monopoly held by the booksellers. Booksellers sound \nquaint and harmless to us. They were not viewed as harmless in seventeenth-\ncentury England. Members of the Conger were increasingly seen as monopolists of \nthe worst kindtools of the Crown’s repression, selling the liberty of England \nto guarantee themselves a monopoly profit. The attacks against these monopolists \nwere harsh: Milton described them as old patentees and monopolizers in the \ntrade of book-selling; they were men who do not therefore labour in an honest \nprofession to which learning is indetted. [4]",
        "Many believed the power the booksellers exercised over the spread of knowledge \nwas harming that spread, just at the time the Enlightenment was teaching the \nimportance of education and knowledge spread generally. The idea that knowledge \nshould be free was a hallmark of the time, and these powerful commercial \ninterests were interfering with that idea.",
        "To balance this power, Parliament decided to increase competition among \nbooksellers, and the simplest way to do that was to spread the wealth of \nvaluable books. Parliament therefore limited the term of copyrights, and thereby \nguaranteed that valuable books would become open to any publisher to publish \nafter a limited time. Thus the setting of the term for existing works to just \ntwenty-one years was a compromise to fight the power of the booksellers. The \nlimitation on terms was an indirect way to assure competition among publishers, \nand thus the construction and spread of culture.",
        "When 1731 (1710 + 21) came along, however, the booksellers were getting anxious. \nThey saw the consequences of more competition, and like every competitor, they \ndidn’t like them. At first booksellers simply ignored the Statute of Anne, \ncontinuing to insist on the perpetual right to control publication. But in 1735 \nand 1737, they tried to persuade Parliament to extend their terms. Twenty-one \nyears was not enough, they said; they needed more time.",
        "Parliament rejected their requests. As one pamphleteer put it, in words that \necho today,",
        "I see no Reason for granting a further Term now, which will not hold as well \nfor granting it again and again, as often as the Old ones Expire; so that should \nthis Bill pass, it will in Effect be establishing a perpetual Monopoly, a Thing \ndeservedly odious in the Eye of the Law; it will be a great Cramp to Trade, a \nDiscouragement to Learning, no Benefit to the Authors, but a general Tax on the \nPublick; and all this only to increase the private Gain of the Booksellers. [5]",
        "Having failed in Parliament, the publishers turned to the courts in a series of \ncases. Their argument was simple and direct: The Statute of Anne gave authors \ncertain protections through positive law, but those protections were not \nintended as replacements for the common law. Instead, they were intended simply \nto supplement the common law. Under common law, it was already wrong to take \nanother person’s creative property and use it without his permission. The \nStatute of Anne, the booksellers argued, didn’t change that. Therefore, just \nbecause the protections of the Statute of Anne expired, that didn’t mean the \nprotections of the common law expired: Under the common law they had the right \nto ban the publication of a book, even if its Statute of Anne copyright had \nexpired. This, they argued, was the only way to protect authors.",
        "This was a clever argument, and one that had the support of some of the leading \njurists of the day. It also displayed extraordinary chutzpah. Until then, as law \nprofessor Raymond Patterson has put it, The publishers ... had as much concern \nfor authors as a cattle rancher has for cattle. [6] The bookseller didn’t care \nsquat for the rights of the author. His concern was the monopoly profit that the \nauthor’s work gave.",
        "The booksellers’ argument was not accepted without a fight. The hero of this \nfight was a Scottish bookseller named Alexander Donaldson. [7]",
        "Donaldson was an outsider to the London Conger. He began his career in Edinburgh \nin 1750. The focus of his business was inexpensive reprints of standard works \nwhose copyright term had expired, at least under the Statute of Anne. [8] \nDonaldson’s publishing house prospered and became something of a center for \nliterary Scotsmen. [A]mong them, Professor Mark Rose writes, was the young \nJames Boswell who, together with his friend Andrew Erskine, published an \nanthology of contemporary Scottish poems with Donaldson. [9]",
        "When the London booksellers tried to shut down Donaldson’s shop in Scotland, he \nresponded by moving his shop to London, where he sold inexpensive editions of \nthe most popular English books, in defiance of the supposed common law right of \nLiterary Property. [10] His books undercut the Conger prices by 30 to 50 \npercent, and he rested his right to compete upon the ground that, under the \nStatute of Anne, the works he was selling had passed out of protection.",
        "The London booksellers quickly brought suit to block piracy like Donaldson’s. \nA number of actions were successful against the pirates, the most important \nearly victory being Millar v. Taylor.",
        "Millar was a bookseller who in 1729 had purchased the rights to James Thomson’s \npoem The Seasons. Millar complied with the requirements of the Statute of \nAnne, and therefore received the full protection of the statute. After the term \nof copyright ended, Robert Taylor began printing a competing volume. Millar \nsued, claiming a perpetual common law right, the Statute of Anne \nnotwithstanding. [11]",
        "Astonishingly to modern lawyers, one of the greatest judges in English history, \nLord Mansfield, agreed with the booksellers. Whatever protection the Statute of \nAnne gave booksellers, it did not, he held, extinguish any common law right. The \nquestion was whether the common law would protect the author against subsequent \npirates. Mansfield’s answer was yes: The common law would bar Taylor from \nreprinting Thomson’s poem without Millar’s permission. That common law rule thus \neffectively gave the booksellers a perpetual right to control the publication of \nany book assigned to them.",
        "Considered as a matter of abstract justicereasoning as if justice were just a \nmatter of logical deduction from first principlesMansfield’s conclusion might \nmake some sense. But what it ignored was the larger issue that Parliament had \nstruggled with in 1710: How best to limit the monopoly power of publishers? \nParliament’s strategy was to offer a term for existing works that was long \nenough to buy peace in 1710, but short enough to assure that culture would pass \ninto competition within a reasonable period of time. Within twenty-one years, \nParliament believed, Britain would mature from the controlled culture that the \nCrown coveted to the free culture that we inherited.",
        "The fight to defend the limits of the Statute of Anne was not to end there, \nhowever, and it is here that Donaldson enters the mix.",
        "Millar died soon after his victory, so his case was not appealed. His estate \nsold Thomson’s poems to a syndicate of printers that included Thomas Beckett. \n[12] Donaldson then released an unauthorized edition of Thomson’s works. \nBeckett, on the strength of the decision in Millar, got an injunction against \nDonaldson. Donaldson appealed the case to the House of Lords, which functioned \nmuch like our own Supreme Court. In February of 1774, that body had the chance \nto interpret the meaning of Parliament’s limits from sixty years before.",
        "As few legal cases ever do, Donaldson v. Beckett drew an enormous amount of \nattention throughout Britain. Donaldson’s lawyers argued that whatever rights \nmay have existed under the common law, the Statute of Anne terminated those \nrights. After passage of the Statute of Anne, the only legal protection for an \nexclusive right to control publication came from that statute. Thus, they \nargued, after the term specified in the Statute of Anne expired, works that had \nbeen protected by the statute were no longer protected.",
        "The House of Lords was an odd institution. Legal questions were presented to the \nHouse and voted upon first by the law lords, members of special legal \ndistinction who functioned much like the Justices in our Supreme Court. Then, \nafter the law lords voted, the House of Lords generally voted.",
        "The reports about the law lords’ votes are mixed. On some counts, it looks as if \nperpetual copyright prevailed. But there is no ambiguity about how the House of \nLords voted as whole. By a two-to-one majority (22 to 11) they voted to reject \nthe idea of perpetual copyrights. Whatever one’s understanding of the common \nlaw, now a copyright was fixed for a limited time, after which the work \nprotected by copyright passed into the public domain.",
        "The public domain. Before the case of Donaldson v. Beckett, there was no \nclear idea of a public domain in England. Before 1774, there was a strong \nargument that common law copyrights were perpetual. After 1774, the public \ndomain was born. For the first time in Anglo- American history, the legal \ncontrol over creative works expired, and the greatest works in English history\nincluding those of Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton, Johnson, and Bunyanwere free of \nlegal restraint.",
        "It is hard for us to imagine, but this decision by the House of Lords fueled an \nextraordinarily popular and political reaction. In Scotland, where most of the \npirate publishers did their work, people celebrated the decision in the \nstreets. As the Edinburgh Advertiser reported, No private cause has so much \nengrossed the attention of the public, and none has been tried before the House \nof Lords in the decision of which so many individuals were interested. Great \nrejoicing in Edinburgh upon victory over literary property: bonfires and \nilluminations. [13]",
        "In London, however, at least among publishers, the reaction was equally strong \nin the opposite direction. The Morning Chronicle reported:",
        "By the above decision ... near 200,000 pounds worth of what was honestly \npurchased at public sale, and which was yesterday thought property is now \nreduced to nothing. The Booksellers of London and Westminster, many of whom sold \nestates and houses to purchase Copy-right, are in a manner ruined, and those who \nafter many years industry thought they had acquired a competency to provide for \ntheir families now find themselves without a shilling to devise to their \nsuccessors. [14]\n \nRuined is a bit of an exaggeration. But it is not an exaggeration to say that \nthe change was profound. The decision of the House of Lords meant that the \nbooksellers could no longer control how culture in England would grow and \ndevelop. Culture in England was thereafter free. Not in the sense that \ncopyrights would not be respected, for of course, for a limited time after a \nwork was published, the bookseller had an exclusive right to control the \npublication of that book. And not in the sense that books could be stolen, for \neven after a copyright expired, you still had to buy the book from someone. But \n/free in the sense that the culture and its growth would no longer be \ncontrolled by a small group of publishers. As every free market does, this free \nmarket of free culture would grow as the consumers and producers chose. English \nculture would develop as the many English readers chose to let it developchose \nin the books they bought and wrote; chose in the memes they repeated and \nendorsed. Chose in a competitive context, not a context in which the choices \nabout what culture is available to people and how they get access to it are made \nby the few despite the wishes of the many.",
        "At least, this was the rule in a world where the Parliament is anti-monopoly, \nresistant to the protectionist pleas of publishers. In a world where the \nParliament is more pliant, free culture would be less protected.",
        "Jon Else is a filmmaker. He is best known for his documentaries and has been \nvery successful in spreading his art. He is also a teacher, and as a teacher \nmyself, I envy the loyalty and admiration that his students feel for him. (I \nmet, by accident, two of his students at a dinner party. He was their god.)",
        "Else worked on a documentary that I was involved in. At a break, he told me a \nstory about the freedom to create with film in America today.",
        "In 1990, Else was working on a documentary about Wagner’s Ring Cycle. The focus \nwas stagehands at the San Francisco Opera. Stage- hands are a particularly funny \nand colorful element of an opera. During a show, they hang out below the stage \nin the grips’ lounge and in the lighting loft. They make a perfect contrast to \nthe art on the stage.",
        "During one of the performances, Else was shooting some stage- hands playing \ncheckers. In one corner of the room was a television set. Playing on the \ntelevision set, while the stagehands played checkers and the opera company \nplayed Wagner, was The Simpsons. As Else judged it, this touch of cartoon \nhelped capture the flavor of what was special about the scene.",
        "Years later, when he finally got funding to complete the film, Else attempted to \nclear the rights for those few seconds of The Simpsons. For of course, those \nfew seconds are copyrighted; and of course, to use copyrighted material you need \nthe permission of the copyright owner, unless fair use or some other privilege \napplies.",
        "Else called Simpsons creator Matt Groening’s office to get permission. \nGroening approved the shot. The shot was a four-and-a-half-second image on a \ntiny television set in the corner of the room. How could it hurt? Groening was \nhappy to have it in the film, but he told Else to contact Gracie Films, the \ncompany that produces the program.",
        "Gracie Films was okay with it, too, but they, like Groening, wanted to be \ncareful. So they told Else to contact Fox, Gracie’s parent company. Else called \nFox and told them about the clip in the corner of the one room shot of the film. \nMatt Groening had already given permission, Else said. He was just confirming \nthe permission with Fox.",
        "Then, as Else told me, two things happened. First we discovered ... that Matt \nGroening doesn’t own his own creationor at least that someone [at Fox] believes \nhe doesn’t own his own creation. And second, Fox wanted ten thousand dollars \nas a licensing fee for us to use this four-point-five seconds of ... entirely \nunsolicited Simpsons which was in the corner of the shot.",
        "Else was certain there was a mistake. He worked his way up to someone he thought \nwas a vice president for licensing, Rebecca Herrera. He explained to her, There \nmust be some mistake here. ... We’re asking for your educational rate on this. \nThat was the educational rate, Herrera told Else. A day or so later, Else called \nagain to confirm what he had been told.",
        "I wanted to make sure I had my facts straight, he told me. Yes, you have your \nfacts straight, she said. It would cost $10,000 to use the clip of The \nSimpsons in the corner of a shot in a documentary film about Wagner’s Ring \nCycle. And then, astonishingly, Herrera told Else, And if you quote me, I’ll \nturn you over to our attorneys. As an assistant to Herrera told Else later on, \nThey don’t give a shit. They just want the money.",
        "Else didn’t have the money to buy the right to replay what was playing on the \ntelevision backstage at the San Francisco Opera.To reproduce this reality was \nbeyond the documentary filmmaker’s budget. At the very last minute before the \nfilm was to be released, Else digitally replaced the shot with a clip from \nanother film that he had worked on, The Day After Trinity, from ten years \nbefore.",
        "There’s no doubt that someone, whether Matt Groening or Fox, owns the copyright \nto The Simpsons. That copyright is their property. To use that copyrighted \nmaterial thus sometimes requires the permission of the copyright owner. If the \nuse that Else wanted to make of the Simpsons copyright were one of the uses \nrestricted by the law, then he would need to get the permission of the copyright \nowner before he could use the work in that way. And in a free market, it is the \nowner of the copyright who gets to set the price for any use that the law says \nthe owner gets to control.",
        "For example, public performance is a use of The Simpsons that the copyright \nowner gets to control. If you take a selection of favorite episodes, rent a \nmovie theater, and charge for tickets to come see My Favorite Simpsons, then \nyou need to get permission from the copyright owner. And the copyright owner \n(rightly, in my view) can charge whatever she wants$10 or $1,000,000. That’s \nher right, as set by the law.",
        "But when lawyers hear this story about Jon Else and Fox, their first thought is \nfair use. [1] Else’s use of just 4.5 seconds of an indirect shot of a \nSimpsons episode is clearly a fair use of The Simpsonsand fair use does not \nrequire the permission of anyone.",
        "So I asked Else why he didn’t just rely upon fair use. Here’s his reply:",
        "The Simpsons fiasco was for me a great lesson in the gulf between what \nlawyers find irrelevant in some abstract sense, and what is crushingly relevant \nin practice to those of us actually trying to make and broadcast documentaries. \nI never had any doubt that it was clearly fair use in an absolute legal sense. \nBut I couldn’t rely on the concept in any concrete way. Here’s why:",
        "1. Before our films can be broadcast, the network requires that we buy Errors \nand Omissions insurance. The carriers require a detailed visual cue sheet \nlisting the source and licensing status of each shot in the film. They take a \ndim view of fair use, and a claim of fair use can grind the application \nprocess to a halt.",
        "2. I probably never should have asked Matt Groening in the first place. But I \nknew (at least from folklore) that Fox had a history of tracking down and \nstopping unlicensed Simpsons usage, just as George Lucas had a very high \nprofile litigating Star Wars usage. So I decided to play by the book, thinking \nthat we would be granted free or cheap license to four seconds of Simpsons. As \na documentary producer working to exhaustion on a shoestring, the last thing I \nwanted was to risk legal trouble, even nuisance legal trouble, and even to \ndefend a principle.",
        "3. I did, in fact, speak with one of your colleagues at Stanford Law School ... \nwho confirmed that it was fair use. He also confirmed that Fox would depose and \nlitigate you to within an inch of your life, regardless of the merits of my \nclaim. He made clear that it would boil down to who had the bigger legal \ndepartment and the deeper pockets, me or them.",
        "4. The question of fair use usually comes up at the end of the project, when we \nare up against a release deadline and out of money.",
        "In theory, fair use means you need no permission. The theory therefore supports \nfree culture and insulates against a permission culture. But in practice, fair \nuse functions very differently. The fuzzy lines of the law, tied to the \nextraordinary liability if lines are crossed, means that the effective fair use \nfor many types of creators is slight. The law has the right aim; practice has \ndefeated the aim.",
        "This practice shows just how far the law has come from its eighteenth-century \nroots. The law was born as a shield to protect publishers’ profits against the \nunfair competition of a pirate. It has matured into a sword that interferes with \nany use, transformative or not.",
        "In 1993, Alex Alben was a lawyer working at Starwave, Inc. Starwave was an \ninnovative company founded by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen to develop digital \nentertainment. Long before the Internet became popular, Starwave began investing \nin new technology for delivering entertainment in anticipation of the power of \nnetworks.",
        "Alben had a special interest in new technology. He was intrigued by the emerging \nmarket for CD-ROM technologynot to distribute film, but to do things with film \nthat otherwise would be very difficult. In 1993, he launched an initiative to \ndevelop a product to build retrospectives on the work of particular actors. The \nfirst actor chosen was Clint Eastwood. The idea was to showcase all of the work \nof Eastwood, with clips from his films and interviews with figures important to \nhis career.",
        "At that time, Eastwood had made more than fifty films, as an actor and as a \ndirector. Alben began with a series of interviews with Eastwood, asking him \nabout his career. Because Starwave produced those interviews, it was free to \ninclude them on the CD.",
        "That alone would not have made a very interesting product, so Starwave wanted to \nadd content from the movies in Eastwood’s career: posters, scripts, and other \nmaterial relating to the films Eastwood made. Most of his career was spent at \nWarner Brothers, and so it was relatively easy to get permission for that \ncontent.",
        "Then Alben and his team decided to include actual film clips. Our goal was that \nwe were going to have a clip from every one of East-wood’s films, Alben told \nme. It was here that the problem arose. No one had ever really done this \nbefore, Alben explained. No one had ever tried to do this in the context of an \nartistic look at an actor’s career.",
        "Alben brought the idea to Michael Slade, the CEO of Starwave. Slade asked, \nWell, what \nwill it take?",
        "Alben replied, Well, we’re going to have to clear rights from everyone who \nappears in these films, and the music and everything else that we want to use in \nthese film clips. Slade said, Great! Go for it. [1]",
        "The problem was that neither Alben nor Slade had any idea what clearing those \nrights would mean. Every actor in each of the films could have a claim to \nroyalties for the reuse of that film. But CD-ROMs had not been specified in the \ncontracts for the actors, so there was no clear way to know just what Starwave \nwas to do.",
        "I asked Alben how he dealt with the problem. With an obvious pride in his \nresourcefulness that obscured the obvious bizarreness of his tale, Alben \nrecounted just what they did:",
        "So we very mechanically went about looking up the film clips. We made some \nartistic decisions about what film clips to includeof course we were going to \nuse the Make my day clip from Dirty Harry. But you then need to get the guy \non the ground who’s wiggling under the gun and you need to get his permission. \nAnd then you have to decide what you are going to pay him.",
        "We decided that it would be fair if we offered them the day-player rate for the \nright to reuse that performance. We’re talking about a clip of less than a \nminute, but to reuse that performance in the CD-ROM the rate at the time was \nabout $600.",
        "So we had to identify the peoplesome of them were hard to identify because in \nEastwood movies you can’t tell who’s the guy crashing through the glassis it \nthe actor or is it the stuntman? And then we just, we put together a team, my \nassistant and some others, and we just started calling people.",
        "Some actors were glad to helpDonald Sutherland, for example, followed up \nhimself to be sure that the rights had been cleared. Others were dumbfounded at \ntheir good fortune. Alben would ask, Hey, can I pay you $600 or maybe if you \nwere in two films, you know, $1,200? And they would say, Are you for real? \nHey, I’d love to get $1,200. And some of course were a bit difficult (estranged \nex-wives, in particular). But eventually, Alben and his team had cleared the \nrights to this retrospective CD-ROM on Clint Eastwood’s career.",
        "It was one year laterand even then we weren’t sure whether we were totally \nin the clear.",
        "Alben is proud of his work. The project was the first of its kind and the only \ntime he knew of that a team had undertaken such a massive project for the \npurpose of releasing a retrospective.",
        "Everyone thought it would be too hard. Everyone just threw up their hands and \nsaid, Oh, my gosh, a film, it’s so many copyrights, there’s the music, there’s \nthe screenplay, there’s the director, there’s the actors. But we just broke it \ndown. We just put it into its constituent parts and said, Okay, there’s this \nmany actors, this many directors, ... this many musicians, and we just went at \nit very systematically and cleared the rights.",
        "And no doubt, the product itself was exceptionally good. Eastwood loved it, and \nit sold very well.",
        "But I pressed Alben about how weird it seems that it would have to take a year’s \nwork simply to clear rights. No doubt Alben had done this efficiently, but as \nPeter Drucker has famously quipped, There is nothing so useless as doing \nefficiently that which should not be done at all. [2] Did it make sense, I \nasked Alben, that this is the way a new work has to be made?",
        "For, as he acknowledged, very few ... have the time and resources, and the will \nto do this, and thus, very few such works would ever be made. Does it make \nsense, I asked him, from the standpoint of what anybody really thought they were \never giving rights for originally, that you would have to go clear rights for \nthese kinds of clips?",
        "I don’t think so. When an actor renders a performance in a movie, he or she \ngets paid very well. ... And then when 30 seconds of that performance is used in \na new product that is a retrospective of somebody’s career, I don’t think that \nthat person ... should be compensated for that.",
        "Or at least, is this how the artist should be compensated? Would it make \nsense, I asked, for there to be some kind of statutory license that someone \ncould pay and be free to make derivative use of clips like this? Did it really \nmake sense that a follow-on creator would have to track down every artist, \nactor, director, musician, and get explicit permission from each? Wouldn’t a lot \nmore be created if the legal part of the creative process could be made to be \nmore clean?",
        "Absolutely. I think that if there were some fair-licensing mechanismwhere you \nweren’t subject to hold-ups and you weren’t subject to estranged former spouses\nyou’d see a lot more of this work, because it wouldn’t be so daunting to try to \nput together a retrospective of someone’s career and meaningfully illustrate it \nwith lots of media from that person’s career. You’d build in a cost as the \nproducer of one of these things. You’d build in a cost of paying X dollars to \nthe talent that performed. But it would be a known cost. That’s the thing that \ntrips everybody up and makes this kind of product hard to get off the ground. If \nyou knew I have a hundred minutes of film in this product and it’s going to cost \nme X, then you build your budget around it, and you can get investments and \neverything else that you need to produce it. But if you say, Oh, I want a \nhundred minutes of something and I have no idea what it’s going to cost me, and \na certain number of people are going to hold me up for money, then it becomes \ndifficult to put one of these things together.",
        "Alben worked for a big company. His company was backed by some of the richest \ninvestors in the world. He therefore had authority and access that the average \nWeb designer would not have. So if it took him a year, how long would it take \nsomeone else? And how much creativity is never made just because the costs of \nclearing the rights are so high?",
        "These costs are the burdens of a kind of regulation. Put on a Republican hat for \na moment, and get angry for a bit. The government defines the scope of these \nrights, and the scope defined determines how much it’s going to cost to \nnegotiate them. (Remember the idea that land runs to the heavens, and imagine \nthe pilot purchasing fly- through rights as he negotiates to fly from Los \nAngeles to San Francisco.) These rights might well have once made sense; but as \ncircumstances change, they make no sense at all. Or at least, a well-trained, \nregulation-minimizing Republican should look at the rights and ask, Does this \nstill make sense?",
        "I’ve seen the flash of recognition when people get this point, but only a few \ntimes. The first was at a conference of federal judges in California. The judges \nwere gathered to discuss the emerging topic of cyber-law. I was asked to be on \nthe panel. Harvey Saferstein, a well-respected lawyer from an L.A. firm, \nintroduced the panel with a video that he and a friend, Robert Fairbank, had \nproduced.",
        "The video was a brilliant collage of film from every period in the twentieth \ncentury, all framed around the idea of a 60 Minutes episode. The execution was \nperfect, down to the sixty-minute stopwatch. The judges loved every minute of \nit.",
        "When the lights came up, I looked over to my copanelist, David Nimmer, perhaps \nthe leading copyright scholar and practitioner in the nation. He had an \nastonished look on his face, as he peered across the room of over 250 well-\nentertained judges. Taking an ominous tone, he began his talk with a question: \nDo you know how many federal laws were just violated in this room?",
        "For of course, the two brilliantly talented creators who made this film hadn’t \ndone what Alben did. They hadn’t spent a year clearing the rights to these \nclips; technically, what they had done violated the law. Of course, it wasn’t as \nif they or anyone were going to be prosecuted for this violation (the presence \nof 250 judges and a gaggle of federal marshals notwithstanding). But Nimmer was \nmaking an important point: A year before anyone would have heard of the word \nNapster, and two years before another member of our panel, David Boies, would \ndefend Napster before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Nimmer was trying to \nget the judges to see that the law would not be friendly to the capacities that \nthis technology would enable. Technology means you can now do amazing things \neasily; but you couldn’t easily do them legally.",
        "We live in a cut and paste culture enabled by technology. Anyone building a \npresentation knows the extraordinary freedom that the cut and paste architecture \nof the Internet createdin a second you can find just about any image you want; \nin another second, you can have it planted in your presentation.",
        "But presentations are just a tiny beginning. Using the Internet and its \narchives, musicians are able to string together mixes of sound never before \nimagined; filmmakers are able to build movies out of clips on computers around \nthe world. An extraordinary site in Sweden takes images of politicians and \nblends them with music to create biting political commentary. A site called Camp \nChaos has produced some of the most biting criticism of the record industry that \nthere is through the mixing of Flash! and music.",
        "All of these creations are technically illegal. Even if the creators wanted to \nbe legal, the cost of complying with the law is impossibly high. Therefore, \nfor the law-abiding sorts, a wealth of creativity is never made. And for that \npart that is made, if it doesn’t follow the clearance rules, it doesn’t get \nreleased.",
        "To some, these stories suggest a solution: Let’s alter the mix of rights so that \npeople are free to build upon our culture. Free to add or mix as they see fit. \nWe could even make this change without necessarily requiring that the free use \nbe free as in free beer. Instead, the system could simply make it easy for \nfollow-on creators to compensate artists without requiring an army of lawyers to \ncome along: a rule, for example, that says the royalty owed the copyright owner \nof an unregistered work for the derivative reuse of his work will be a flat 1 \npercent of net revenues, to be held in escrow for the copyright owner. Under \nthis rule, the copyright owner could benefit from some royalty, but he would not \nhave the benefit of a full property right (meaning the right to name his own \nprice) unless he registers the work.",
        "Who could possibly object to this? And what reason would there be for objecting? \nWe’re talking about work that is not now being made; which if made, under this \nplan, would produce new income for artists. What reason would anyone have to \noppose it?",
        "In February 2003, DreamWorks studios announced an agreement with Mike Myers, the \ncomic genius of Saturday Night Live and Austin Powers. According to the \nannouncement, Myers and DreamWorks would work together to form a unique \nfilmmaking pact. Under the agreement, DreamWorks will acquire the rights to \nexisting motion picture hits and classics, write new storylines andwith the use \nof state- of-the-art digital technologyinsert Myers and other actors into the \nfilm, thereby creating an entirely new piece of entertainment.",
        "The announcement called this film sampling. As Myers explained, Film Sampling \nis an exciting way to put an original spin on existing films and allow audiences \nto see old movies in a new light. Rap artists have been doing this for years \nwith music and now we are able to take that same concept and apply it to film. \nSteven Spielberg is quoted as saying, If anyone can create a way to bring old \nfilms to new audiences, it is Mike.",
        "Spielberg is right. Film sampling by Myers will be brilliant. But if you don’t \nthink about it, you might miss the truly astonishing point about this \nannouncement. As the vast majority of our film heritage remains under copyright, \nthe real meaning of the DreamWorks announcement is just this: It is Mike Myers \nand only Mike Myers who is free to sample. Any general freedom to build upon the \nfilm archive of our culture, a freedom in other contexts presumed for us all, is \nnow a privilege reserved for the funny and famousand presumably rich.",
        "This privilege becomes reserved for two sorts of reasons. The first continues \nthe story of the last chapter: the vagueness of fair use. Much of sampling \nshould be considered fair use. But few would rely upon so weak a doctrine to \ncreate. That leads to the second reason that the privilege is reserved for the \nfew: The costs of negotiating the legal rights for the creative reuse of content \nare astronomically high. These costs mirror the costs with fair use: You either \npay a lawyer to defend your fair use rights or pay a lawyer to track down \npermissions so you don’t have to rely upon fair use rights. Either way, the \ncreative process is a process of paying lawyersagain a privilege, or perhaps a \ncurse, reserved for the few.",
        "In April 1996, millions of botscomputer codes designed to spider, or \nautomatically search the Internet and copy contentbegan running across the Net. \nPage by page, these bots copied Internet-based information onto a small set of \ncomputers located in a basement in San Francisco’s Presidio. Once the bots \nfinished the whole of the Internet, they started again. Over and over again, \nonce every two months, these bits of code took copies of the Internet and stored \nthem.",
        "By October 2001, the bots had collected more than five years of copies. And at a \nsmall announcement in Berkeley, California, the archive that these copies \ncreated, the Internet Archive, was opened to the world. Using a technology \ncalled the Way Back Machine, you could enter a Web page, and see all of its \ncopies going back to 1996, as well as when those pages changed.",
        "This is the thing about the Internet that Orwell would have appreciated. In the \ndystopia described in 1984, old newspapers were constantly updated to assure \nthat the current view of the world, approved of by the government, was not \ncontradicted by previous news reports. Thousands of workers constantly reedited \nthe past, meaning there was no way ever to know whether the story you were \nreading today was the story that was printed on the date published on the paper.",
        "It’s the same with the Internet. If you go to a Web page today, there’s no way \nfor you to know whether the content you are reading is the same as the content \nyou read before. The page may seem the same, but the content could easily be \ndifferent. The Internet is Orwell’s libraryconstantly updated, without any \nreliable memory.",
        "Until the Way Back Machine, at least. With the Way Back Machine, and the \nInternet Archive underlying it, you can see what the Internet was. You have the \npower to see what you remember. More importantly, perhaps, you also have the \npower to find what you don’t \nremember and what others might prefer you forget. [1]",
        "We take it for granted that we can go back to see what we remember reading. \nThink about newspapers. If you wanted to study the reaction of your hometown \nnewspaper to the race riots in Watts in 1965, or to Bull Connor’s water cannon \nin 1963, you could go to your public library and look at the newspapers. Those \npapers probably exist on microfiche. If you’re lucky, they exist in paper, too. \nEither way, you are free, using a library, to go back and remembernot just what \nit is convenient to remember, but remember something close to the truth.",
        "It is said that those who fail to remember history are doomed to repeat \nit.That’s not quite correct. We all forget history. The key is whether we have \na way to go back to rediscover what we forget. More directly, the key is whether \nan objective past can keep us honest. Libraries help do that, by collecting \ncontent and keeping it, for schoolchildren, for researchers, for grandma. A free \nsociety presumes this knowledge.",
        "The Internet was an exception to this presumption. Until the Internet Archive, \nthere was no way to go back. The Internet was the quintessentially transitory \nmedium. And yet, as it becomes more important in forming and reforming society, \nit becomes more and more important to maintain in some historical form. It’s \njust bizarre to think that we have scads of archives of newspapers from tiny \ntowns around the world, yet there is but one copy of the Internetthe one kept \nby the Internet Archive.",
        "Brewster Kahle is the founder of the Internet Archive. He was a very successful \nInternet entrepreneur after he was a successful computer researcher. In the \n1990s, Kahle decided he had had enough business success. It was time to become a \ndifferent kind of success. So he launched a series of projects designed to \narchive human knowledge. The Internet Archive was just the first of the projects \nof this Andrew Carnegie of the Internet. By December of 2002, the archive had \nover 10 billion pages, and it was growing at about a billion pages a month.",
        "The Way Back Machine is the largest archive of human knowledge in human history. \nAt the end of 2002, it held two hundred and thirty terabytes of materialand \nwas ten times larger than the Library of Congress. And this was just the first \nof the archives that Kahle set out to build. In addition to the Internet \nArchive, Kahle has been constructing the Television Archive. Television, it \nturns out, is even more ephemeral than the Internet. While much of twentieth-\ncentury culture was constructed through television, only a tiny proportion of \nthat culture is available for anyone to see today. Three hours of news are \nrecorded each evening by Vanderbilt Universitythanks to a specific exemption in \nthe copyright law.That content is indexed, and is available to scholars for a \nvery low fee. But other than that, [television] is almost unavailable, Kahle \ntold me. If you were Barbara Walters you could get access to [the archives], \nbut if you are just a graduate student? As Kahle put it,",
        "Do you remember when Dan Quayle was interacting with Murphy Brown? Remember \nthat back and forth surreal experience of a politician interacting with a \nfictional television character? If you were a graduate student wanting to study \nthat, and you wanted to get those original back and forth exchanges between the \ntwo, the 60 Minutes episode that came out after it ... it would be almost \nimpossible. ... Those materials are almost unfindable. ...",
        "Why is that? Why is it that the part of our culture that is recorded in \nnewspapers remains perpetually accessible, while the part that is recorded on \nvideotape is not? How is it that we’ve created a world where researchers trying \nto understand the effect of media on nineteenth-century America will have an \neasier time than researchers trying to understand the effect of media on \ntwentieth-century America?",
        "In part, this is because of the law. Early in American copyright law, copyright \nowners were required to deposit copies of their work in libraries. These copies \nwere intended both to facilitate the spread of knowledge and to assure that a \ncopy of the work would be around once the copyright expired, so that others \nmight access and copy the work.",
        "These rules applied to film as well. But in 1915, the Library of Congress made \nan exception for film. Film could be copyrighted so long as such deposits were \nmade. But the filmmaker was then allowed to borrow back the depositsfor an \nunlimited time at no cost. In 1915 alone, there were more than 5,475 films \ndeposited and borrowed back. Thus, when the copyrights to films expire, there \nis no copy held by any library. The copy existsif it exists at allin the \nlibrary archive of the film company. [2]",
        "The same is generally true about television. Television broadcasts were \noriginally not copyrightedthere was no way to capture the broadcasts, so there \nwas no fear of theft. But as technology enabled capturing, broadcasters relied \nincreasingly upon the law. The law required they make a copy of each broadcast \nfor the work to be copy-righted. But those copies were simply kept by the \nbroadcasters. No library had any right to them; the government didn’t demand \nthem. The content of this part of American culture is practically invisible to \nanyone who would look.",
        "Kahle was eager to correct this. Before September 11, 2001, he and his allies \nhad started capturing television. They selected twenty stations from around the \nworld and hit the Record button. After September 11, Kahle, working with dozens \nof others, selected twenty stations from around the world and, beginning October \n11, 2001, made their coverage during the week of September 11 available free on-\nline. Anyone could see how news reports from around the world covered the events \nof that day.",
        "Kahle had the same idea with film. Working with Rick Prelinger, whose archive of \nfilm includes close to 45,000 ephemeral films (meaning films other than \nHollywood movies, films that were never copyrighted), Kahle established the \nMovie Archive. Prelinger let Kahle digitize 1,300 films in this archive and post \nthose films on the Internet to be downloaded for free. Prelinger’s is a for-\nprofit company. It sells copies of these films as stock footage. What he has \ndiscovered is that after he made a significant chunk available for free, his \nstock footage sales went up dramatically. People could easily find the material \nthey wanted to use. Some downloaded that material and made films on their own. \nOthers purchased copies to enable other films to be made. Either way, the \narchive enabled access to this important part of our culture. Want to see a copy \nof the Duck and Cover film that instructed children how to save themselves in \nthe middle of nuclear attack? Go to archive.org, and you can download the film \nin a few minutesfor free.",
        "Here again, Kahle is providing access to a part of our culture that we otherwise \ncould not get easily, if at all. It is yet another part of what defines the \ntwentieth century that we have lost to history. The law doesn’t require these \ncopies to be kept by anyone, or to be deposited in an archive by anyone. \nTherefore, there is no simple way to find them.",
        "The key here is access, not price. Kahle wants to enable free access to this \ncontent, but he also wants to enable others to sell access to it. His aim is to \nensure competition in access to this important part of our culture. Not during \nthe commercial life of a bit of creative property, but during a second life that \nall creative property hasa noncommercial life.",
        "For here is an idea that we should more clearly recognize. Every bit of creative \nproperty goes through different lives. In its first life, if the creator is \nlucky, the content is sold. In such cases the commercial market is successful \nfor the creator. The vast majority of creative property doesn’t enjoy such \nsuccess, but some clearly does. For that content, commercial life is extremely \nimportant. Without this commercial market, there would be, many argue, much less \ncreativity.",
        "After the commercial life of creative property has ended, our tradition has \nalways supported a second life as well. A newspaper delivers the news every day \nto the doorsteps of America. The very next day, it is used to wrap fish or to \nfill boxes with fragile gifts or to build an archive of knowledge about our \nhistory. In this second life, the content can continue to inform even if that \ninformation is no longer sold.",
        "The same has always been true about books. A book goes out of print very quickly \n(the average today is after about a year [3]). After it is out of print, it can \nbe sold in used book stores without the copyright owner getting anything and \nstored in libraries, where many get to read the book, also for free. Used book \nstores and libraries are thus the second life of a book. That second life is \nextremely important to the spread and stability of culture.",
        "Yet increasingly, any assumption about a stable second life for creative \nproperty does not hold true with the most important components of popular \nculture in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. For thesetelevision, \nmovies, music, radio, the Internetthere is no guarantee of a second life. For \nthese sorts of culture, it is as if we’ve replaced libraries with Barnes & Noble \nsuperstores. With this culture, what’s accessible is nothing but what a certain \nlimited market demands. Beyond that, culture disappears.",
        "For most of the twentieth century, it was economics that made this so. It would \nhave been insanely expensive to collect and make accessible all television and \nfilm and music: The cost of analog copies is extraordinarily high. So even \nthough the law in principle would have restricted the ability of a Brewster \nKahle to copy culture generally, the real restriction was economics. The market \nmade it impossibly difficult to do anything about this ephemeral culture; the \nlaw had little practical effect.",
        "Perhaps the single most important feature of the digital revolution is that for \nthe first time since the Library of Alexandria, it is feasible to imagine \nconstructing archives that hold all culture produced or distributed publicly. \nTechnology makes it possible to imagine an archive of all books published, and \nincreasingly makes it possible to imagine an archive of all moving images and \nsound.",
        "The scale of this potential archive is something we’ve never imagined before. \nThe Brewster Kahles of our history have dreamed about it; but we are for the \nfirst time at a point where that dream is possible. As Kahle describes,",
        "It looks like there’s about two to three million recordings of music. Ever. \nThere are about a hundred thousand theatrical releases of movies, ... and about \none to two million movies [distributed] during the twentieth century. There are \nabout twenty-six million different titles of books. All of these would fit on \ncomputers that would fit in this room and be able to be afforded by a small \ncompany. So we’re at a turning point in our history. Universal access is the \ngoal. And the opportunity of leading a different life, based on this, is ... \nthrilling. It could be one of the things humankind would be most proud of. Up \nthere with the Library of Alexandria, putting a man on the moon, and the \ninvention of the printing press.",
        "Kahle is not the only librarian. The Internet Archive is not the only archive. \nBut Kahle and the Internet Archive suggest what the future of libraries or \narchives could be. When the commercial life of creative property ends, I don’t \nknow. But it does. And whenever it does, Kahle and his archive hint at a world \nwhere this knowledge, and culture, remains perpetually available. Some will draw \nupon it to understand it; some to criticize it. Some will use it, as Walt Disney \ndid, to re-create the past for the future. These technologies promise something \nthat had become unimaginable for much of our pasta future for our past. The \ntechnology of digital arts could make the dream of the Library of Alexandria \nreal again.",
        "Technologists have thus removed the economic costs of building such an archive. \nBut lawyers’ costs remain. For as much as we might like to call these \narchives, as warm as the idea of a library might seem, the content that is \ncollected in these digital spaces is also some-one’s property. And the law of \nproperty restricts the freedoms that Kahle and others would exercise.",
        "Jack Valenti has been the president of the Motion Picture Association of America \nsince 1966. He first came to Washington, D.C., with Lyndon Johnson’s \nadministrationliterally. The famous picture of Johnson’s swearing-in on Air \nForce One after the assassination of President Kennedy has Valenti in the \nbackground. In his almost forty years of running the MPAA, Valenti has \nestablished himself as perhaps the most prominent and effective lobbyist in \nWashington.",
        "The MPAA is the American branch of the international Motion Picture Association. \nIt was formed in 1922 as a trade association whose goal was to defend American \nmovies against increasing domestic criticism. The organization now represents \nnot only filmmakers but producers and distributors of entertainment for \ntelevision, video, and cable. Its board is made up of the chairmen and \npresidents of the seven major producers and distributors of motion picture and \ntelevision programs in the United States: Walt Disney, Sony Pictures \nEntertainment, MGM, Paramount Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, Universal \nStudios, and Warner Brothers.",
        "Valenti is only the third president of the MPAA. No president before him has had \nas much influence over that organization, or over Washington. As a Texan, \nValenti has mastered the single most important political skill of a Southerner\nthe ability to appear simple and slow while hiding a lightning-fast intellect. \nTo this day, Valenti plays the simple, humble man. But this Harvard MBA, and \nauthor of four books, who finished high school at the age of fifteen and flew \nmore than fifty combat missions in World War II, is no Mr. Smith. When Valenti \nwent to Washington, he mastered the city in a quintessentially Washingtonian \nway.",
        "In defending artistic liberty and the freedom of speech that our culture depends \nupon, the MPAA has done important good. In crafting the MPAA rating system, it \nhas probably avoided a great deal of speech-regulating harm. But there is an \naspect to the organization’s mission that is both the most radical and the most \nimportant. This is the organization’s effort, epitomized in Valenti’s every act, \nto redefine the meaning of creative property.",
        "In 1982, Valenti’s testimony to Congress captured the strategy perfectly:",
        "No matter the lengthy arguments made, no matter the charges and the counter-\ncharges, no matter the tumult and the shouting, reasonable men and women will \nkeep returning to the fundamental issue, the central theme which animates this \nentire debate: Creative property owners must be accorded the same rights and \nprotection resident in all other property owners in the nation. That is the \nissue. That is the question. And that is the rostrum on which this entire \nhearing and the debates to follow must rest. [1]",
        "The strategy of this rhetoric, like the strategy of most of Valenti’s rhetoric, \nis brilliant and simple and brilliant because simple. The central theme to \nwhich reasonable men and women will return is this: Creative property owners \nmust be accorded the same rights and protections resident in all other property \nowners in the nation. There are no second-class citizens, Valenti might have \ncontinued. There should be no second-class property owners.",
        "This claim has an obvious and powerful intuitive pull. It is stated with such \nclarity as to make the idea as obvious as the notion that we use elections to \npick presidents. But in fact, there is no more extreme a claim made by anyone \nwho is serious in this debate than this claim of Valenti’s. Jack Valenti, \nhowever sweet and however brilliant, is perhaps the nation’s foremost extremist \nwhen it comes to the nature and scope of creative property. His views have \n/no reasonable connection to our actual legal tradition, even if the subtle \npull of his Texan charm has slowly redefined that tradition, at least in \nWashington.",
        "While creative property is certainly property in a nerdy and precise sense \nthat lawyers are trained to understand, [2] it has never been the case, nor \nshould it be, that creative property owners have been ac- corded the same \nrights and protection resident in all other property owners. Indeed, if \ncreative property owners were given the same rights as all other property \nowners, that would effect a radical, and radically undesirable, change in our \ntradition.",
        "Valenti knows this. But he speaks for an industry that cares squat for our \ntradition and the values it represents. He speaks for an industry that is \ninstead fighting to restore the tradition that the British overturned in 1710. \nIn the world that Valenti’s changes would create, a powerful few would exercise \npowerful control over how our creative culture would develop.",
        "I have two purposes in this chapter. The first is to convince you that, \nhistorically, Valenti’s claim is absolutely wrong. The second is to convince you \nthat it would be terribly wrong for us to reject our history. We have always \ntreated rights in creative property differently from the rights resident in all \nother property owners. They have never been the same. And they should never be \nthe same, because, however counterintuitive this may seem, to make them the same \nwould be to fundamentally weaken the opportunity for new creators to create. \nCreativity depends upon the owners of creativity having less than perfect \ncontrol.",
        "Organizations such as the MPAA, whose board includes the most powerful of the \nold guard, have little interest, their rhetoric notwithstanding, in assuring \nthat the new can displace them. No organization does. No person does. (Ask me \nabout tenure, for example.) But what’s good for the MPAA is not necessarily good \nfor America. A society that defends the ideals of free culture must preserve \nprecisely the opportunity for new creativity to threaten the old.",
        "To get just a hint that there is something fundamentally wrong in Valenti’s \nargument, we need look no further than the United States Constitution itself.",
        "The framers of our Constitution loved property. Indeed, so strongly did they \nlove property that they built into the Constitution an important requirement. If \nthe government takes your propertyif it condemns your house, or acquires a \nslice of land from your farmit is required, under the Fifth Amendment’s \nTakings Clause, to pay you just compensation for that taking. The \nConstitution thus guarantees that property is, in a certain sense, sacred. It \ncannot ever be taken from the property owner unless the government pays for \nthe privilege.",
        "Yet the very same Constitution speaks very differently about what Valenti calls \ncreative property. In the clause granting Congress the power to create \ncreative property, the Constitution requires that after a limited time, \nCongress take back the rights that it has granted and set the creative \nproperty free to the public domain. Yet when Congress does this, when the \nexpiration of a copyright term takes your copyright and turns it over to the \npublic domain, Congress does not have any obligation to pay just compensation \nfor this taking. Instead, the same Constitution that requires compensation for \nyour land requires that you lose your creative property right without any \ncompensation at all.",
        "The Constitution thus on its face states that these two forms of property are \nnot to be accorded the same rights. They are plainly to be treated differently. \nValenti is therefore not just asking for a change in our tradition when he \nargues that creative-property owners should be accorded the same rights as every \nother property-right owner. He is effectively arguing for a change in our \nConstitution itself.",
        "Arguing for a change in our Constitution is not necessarily wrong. There was \nmuch in our original Constitution that was plainly wrong. The Constitution of \n1789 entrenched slavery; it left senators to be appointed rather than elected; \nit made it possible for the electoral college to produce a tie between the \npresident and his own vice president (as it did in 1800). The framers were no \ndoubt extraordinary, but I would be the first to admit that they made big \nmistakes. We have since rejected some of those mistakes; no doubt there could be \nothers that we should reject as well. So my argument is not simply that because \nJefferson did it, we should, too.",
        "Instead, my argument is that because Jefferson did it, we should at least try to \nunderstand why. Why did the framers, fanatical property types that they were, \nreject the claim that creative property be given the same rights as all other \nproperty? Why did they require that for creative property there must be a public \ndomain?",
        "To answer this question, we need to get some perspective on the history of these \ncreative property rights, and the control that they enabled. Once we see \nclearly how differently these rights have been defined, we will be in a better \nposition to ask the question that should be at the core of this war: Not \n/whether creative property should be protected, but how. Not whether we will \nenforce the rights the law gives to creative-property owners, but what the \nparticular mix of rights ought to be. Not whether artists should be paid, but \nwhether institutions designed to assure that artists get paid need also control \nhow culture develops.",
        "To answer these questions, we need a more general way to talk about how property \nis protected. More precisely, we need a more general way than the narrow \nlanguage of the law allows. In Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace, I used a \nsimple model to capture this more general perspective. For any particular right \nor regulation, this model asks how four different modalities of regulation \ninteract to support or weaken the right or regulation. I represented it with \nthis diagram:",
        "[Image: alt text]",
        "At the center of this picture is a regulated dot: the individual or group that \nis the target of regulation, or the holder of a right. (In each case throughout, \nwe can describe this either as regulation or as a right. For simplicity’s sake, \nI will speak only of regulations.) The ovals represent four ways in which the \nindividual or group might be regulatedeither constrained or, alternatively, \nenabled. Law is the most obvious constraint (to lawyers, at least). It \nconstrains by threatening punishments after the fact if the rules set in advance \nare violated. So if, for example, you willfully infringe Madonna’s copyright by \ncopying a song from her latest CD and posting it on the Web, you can be punished \nwith a $150,000 fine. The fine is an ex post punishment for violating an ex ante \nrule. It is imposed by the state.",
        "Norms are a different kind of constraint. They, too, punish an individual for \nviolating a rule. But the punishment of a norm is imposed by a community, not \n(or not only) by the state. There may be no law against spitting, but that \ndoesn’t mean you won’t be punished if you spit on the ground while standing in \nline at a movie. The punishment might not be harsh, though depending upon the \ncommunity, it could easily be more harsh than many of the punishments imposed by \nthe state. The mark of the difference is not the severity of the rule, but the \nsource of the enforcement.",
        "The market is a third type of constraint. Its constraint is effected through \nconditions: You can do X if you pay Y; you’ll be paid M if you do N. These \nconstraints are obviously not independent of law or normsit is property law \nthat defines what must be bought if it is to be taken legally; it is norms that \nsay what is appropriately sold. But given a set of norms, and a background of \nproperty and contract law, the market imposes a simultaneous constraint upon how \nan individual or group might behave.",
        "Finally, and for the moment, perhaps, most mysteriously, architecturethe \nphysical world as one finds itis a constraint on behavior. A fallen bridge \nmight constrain your ability to get across a river. Railroad tracks might \nconstrain the ability of a community to integrate its social life. As with the \nmarket, architecture does not effect its constraint through ex post punishments. \nInstead, also as with the market, architecture effects its constraint through \nsimultaneous conditions. These conditions are imposed not by courts enforcing \ncontracts, or by police punishing theft, but by nature, by architecture. If a \n500-pound boulder blocks your way, it is the law of gravity that enforces this \nconstraint. If a $500 airplane ticket stands between you and a flight to New \nYork, it is the market that enforces this constraint.",
        "So the first point about these four modalities of regulation is obvious: They \ninteract. Restrictions imposed by one might be reinforced by another. Or \nrestrictions imposed by one might be undermined by another.",
        "The second point follows directly: If we want to understand the effective \nfreedom that anyone has at a given moment to do any particular thing, we have to \nconsider how these four modalities interact. Whether or not there are other \nconstraints (there may well be; my claim is not about comprehensiveness), these \nfour are among the most significant, and any regulator (whether controlling or \nfreeing) must consider how these four in particular interact.",
        "So, for example, consider the freedom to drive a car at a high speed. That \nfreedom is in part restricted by laws: speed limits that say how fast you can \ndrive in particular places at particular times. It is in part restricted by \narchitecture: speed bumps, for example, slow most rational drivers; governors in \nbuses, as another example, set the maximum rate at which the driver can drive. \nThe freedom is in part restricted by the market: Fuel efficiency drops as speed \nincreases, thus the price of gasoline indirectly constrains speed. And finally, \nthe norms of a community may or may not constrain the freedom to speed. Drive at \n50 mph by a school in your own neighborhood and you’re likely to be punished by \nthe neighbors. The same norm wouldn’t be as effective in a different town, or at \nnight.",
        "The final point about this simple model should also be fairly clear: While these \nfour modalities are analytically independent, law has a special role in \naffecting the three. [3] The law, in other words, sometimes operates to increase \nor decrease the constraint of a particular modality. Thus, the law might be used \nto increase taxes on gasoline, so as to increase the incentives to drive more \nslowly. The law might be used to mandate more speed bumps, so as to increase the \ndifficulty of driving rapidly. The law might be used to fund ads that stigmatize \nreckless driving. Or the law might be used to require that other laws be more \nstricta federal requirement that states decrease the speed limit, for example\nso as to decrease the attractiveness of fast driving.",
        "[Image: alt text.]",
        "These constraints can thus change, and they can be changed. To understand the \neffective protection of liberty or protection of property at any particular \nmoment, we must track these changes over time. A restriction imposed by one \nmodality might be erased by another. A freedom enabled by one modality might be \ndisplaced by another. [4] ",
        "Why Hollywood Is Right",
        "The most obvious point that this model reveals is just why, or just how, \nHollywood is right. The copyright warriors have rallied Congress and the courts \nto defend copyright. This model helps us see why that rallying makes sense.",
        "Let’s say this is the picture of copyright’s regulation before the Internet:",
        "[Image: alt text.]",
        "There is balance between law, norms, market, and architecture. The law limits \nthe ability to copy and share content, by imposing penalties on those who copy \nand share content. Those penalties are reinforced by technologies that make it \nhard to copy and share content (architecture) and expensive to copy and share \ncontent (market). Finally, those penalties are mitigated by norms we all \nrecognizekids, for example, taping other kids’ records. These uses of \ncopyrighted material may well be infringement, but the norms of our society \n(before the Internet, at least) had no problem with this form of infringement.",
        "Enter the Internet, or, more precisely, technologies such as MP3s and p2p \nsharing. Now the constraint of architecture changes dramatically, as does the \nconstraint of the market. And as both the market and architecture relax the \nregulation of copyright, norms pile on. The happy balance (for the warriors, at \nleast) of life before the Internet becomes an effective state of anarchy after \nthe Internet.",
        "Thus the sense of, and justification for, the warriors’ response. Technology has \nchanged, the warriors say, and the effect of this change, when ramified through \nthe market and norms, is that a balance of protection for the copyright owners’ \nrights has been lost. This is Iraq after the fall of Saddam, but this time no \ngovernment is justifying the looting that results.",
        "[Image: alt text.]",
        "Neither this analysis nor the conclusions that follow are new to the warriors. \nIndeed, in a White Paper prepared by the Commerce Department (one heavily \ninfluenced by the copyright warriors) in 1995, this mix of regulatory modalities \nhad already been identified and the strategy to respond already mapped. In \nresponse to the changes the Internet had effected, the White Paper argued (1) \nCongress should strengthen intellectual property law, (2) businesses should \nadopt innovative marketing techniques, (3) technologists should push to develop \ncode to protect copyrighted material, and (4) educators should educate kids to \nbetter protect copyright.",
        "This mixed strategy is just what copyright neededif it was to preserve the \nparticular balance that existed before the change induced by the Internet. And \nit’s just what we should expect the content industry to push for. It is as \nAmerican as apple pie to consider the happy life you have as an entitlement, and \nto look to the law to protect it if something comes along to change that happy \nlife. Homeowners living in a flood plain have no hesitation appealing to the \ngovernment to rebuild (and rebuild again) when a flood (architecture) wipes away \ntheir property (law). Farmers have no hesitation appealing to the government to \nbail them out when a virus (architecture) devastates their crop. Unions have no \nhesitation appealing to the government to bail them out when imports (market) \nwipe out the U.S. steel industry.",
        "Thus, there’s nothing wrong or surprising in the content industry’s campaign to \nprotect itself from the harmful consequences of a technological innovation. And \nI would be the last person to argue that the changing technology of the Internet \nhas not had a profound effect on the content industry’s way of doing business, \nor as John Seely Brown describes it, its architecture of revenue.",
        "But just because a particular interest asks for government support, it doesn’t \nfollow that support should be granted. And just because technology has weakened \na particular way of doing business, it doesn’t follow that the government should \nintervene to support that old way of doing business. Kodak, for example, has \nlost perhaps as much as 20 percent of their traditional film market to the \nemerging technologies of digital cameras. [5] Does anyone believe the government \nshould ban digital cameras just to support Kodak? Highways have weakened the \nfreight business for railroads. Does anyone think we should ban trucks from \nroads for the purpose of protecting the railroads? Closer to the subject of \nthis book, remote channel changers have weakened the stickiness of television \nadvertising (if a boring commercial comes on the TV, the remote makes it easy to \nsurf ), and it may well be that this change has weakened the television \nadvertising market. But does anyone believe we should regulate remotes to \nreinforce commercial television? (Maybe by limiting them to function only once a \nsecond, or to switch to only ten channels within an hour?)",
        "The obvious answer to these obviously rhetorical questions is no. In a free \nsociety, with a free market, supported by free enterprise and free trade, the \ngovernment’s role is not to support one way of doing business against others. \nIts role is not to pick winners and protect them against loss. If the government \ndid this generally, then we would never have any progress. As Microsoft chairman \nBill Gates wrote in 1991, in a memo criticizing software patents, established \ncompanies have an interest in excluding future competitors. [6] And relative to \na startup, established companies also have the means. (Think RCA and FM radio.) \nA world in which competitors with new ideas must fight not only the market but \nalso the government is a world in which competitors with new ideas will not \nsucceed. It is a world of stasis and increasingly concentrated stagnation. It is \nthe Soviet Union under Brezhnev.",
        "Thus, while it is understandable for industries threatened with new technologies \nthat change the way they do business to look to the government for protection, \nit is the special duty of policy makers to guarantee that that protection not \nbecome a deterrent to progress. It is the duty of policy makers, in other words, \nto assure that the changes they create, in response to the request of those hurt \nby changing technology, are changes that preserve the incentives and \nopportunities for innovation and change.",
        "In the context of laws regulating speechwhich include, obviously, copyright \nlawthat duty is even stronger. When the industry complaining about changing \ntechnologies is asking Congress to respond in a way that burdens speech and \ncreativity, policy makers should be especially wary of the request. It is always \na bad deal for the government to get into the business of regulating speech \nmarkets. The risks and dangers of that game are precisely why our framers \ncreated the First Amendment to our Constitution: Congress shall make no law ... \nabridging the freedom of speech. So when Congress is being asked to pass laws \nthat would abridge the freedom of speech, it should ask carefullywhether \nsuch regulation is justified.",
        "My argument just now, however, has nothing to do with whether the changes that \nare being pushed by the copyright warriors are justified. My argument is about \ntheir effect. For before we get to the question of justification, a hard \nquestion that depends a great deal upon your values, we should first ask whether \nwe understand the effect of the changes the content industry wants.",
        "Here’s the metaphor that will capture the argument to follow.",
        "In 1873, the chemical DDT was first synthesized. In 1948, Swiss chemist Paul \nHermann Müller won the Nobel Prize for his work demonstrating the insecticidal \nproperties of DDT. By the 1950s, the insecticide was widely used around the \nworld to kill disease-carrying pests. It was also used to increase farm \nproduction.",
        "No one doubts that killing disease-carrying pests or increasing crop production \nis a good thing. No one doubts that the work of Müller was important and \nvaluable and probably saved lives, possibly millions.",
        "But in 1962, Rachel Carson published Silent Spring, which argued that DDT, \nwhatever its primary benefits, was also having unintended environmental \nconsequences. Birds were losing the ability to reproduce. Whole chains of the \necology were being destroyed.",
        "No one set out to destroy the environment. Paul Müller certainly did not aim to \nharm any birds. But the effort to solve one set of problems produced another set \nwhich, in the view of some, was far worse than the problems that were originally \nattacked. Or more accurately, the problems DDT caused were worse than the \nproblems it solved, at least when considering the other, more environmentally \nfriendly ways to solve the problems that DDT was meant to solve.",
        "It is to this image precisely that Duke University law professor James Boyle \nappeals when he argues that we need an environmentalism” for culture. [7] His \npoint, and the point I want to develop in the balance of this chapter, is not \nthat the aims of copyright are flawed. Or that authors should not be paid for \ntheir work. Or that music should be given away for free. The point is that \nsome of the ways in which we might protect authors will have unintended \nconsequences for the cultural environment, much like DDT had for the natural \nenvironment. And just as criticism of DDT is not an endorsement of malaria or an \nattack on farmers, so, too, is criticism of one particular set of regulations \nprotecting copyright not an endorsement of anarchy or an attack on authors. It \nis an environment of creativity that we seek, and we should be aware of our \nactions’ effects on the environment.",
        "My argument, in the balance of this chapter, tries to map exactly this effect. \nNo doubt the technology of the Internet has had a dramatic effect on the ability \nof copyright owners to protect their content. But there should also be little \ndoubt that when you add together the changes in copyright law over time, plus \nthe change in technology that the Internet is undergoing just now, the net \neffect of these changes will not be only that copyrighted work is effectively \nprotected. Also, and generally missed, the net effect of this massive increase \nin protection will be devastating to the environment for creativity.",
        "In a line: To kill a gnat, we are spraying DDT with consequences for free \nculture that will be far more devastating than that this gnat will be lost.",
        "Beginnings",
        "America copied English copyright law. Actually, we copied and improved English \ncopyright law. Our Constitution makes the purpose of creative property rights \nclear; its express limitations reinforce the English aim to avoid overly \npowerful publishers.",
        "The power to establish creative property rights is granted to Congress in a \nway that, for our Constitution, at least, is very odd. Article I, section 8, \nclause 8 of our Constitution states that:",
        "Congress has the power to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by \nsecuring for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their \nrespective Writings and Discoveries.",
        "We can call this the Progress Clause, for notice what this clause does not \nsay. It does not say Congress has the power to grant creative property rights. \nIt says that Congress has the power to promote progress. The grant of power is \nits purpose, and its purpose is a public one, not the purpose of enriching \npublishers, nor even primarily the purpose of rewarding authors.",
        "The Progress Clause expressly limits the term of copyrights. As we saw in \nchapter 6, the English limited the term of copyright so as to assure that a few \nwould not exercise disproportionate control over culture by exercising \ndisproportionate control over publishing. We can assume the framers followed the \nEnglish for a similar purpose. Indeed, unlike the English, the framers \nreinforced that objective, by requiring that copyrights extend to Authors \nonly.",
        "The design of the Progress Clause reflects something about the Constitution’s \ndesign in general. To avoid a problem, the framers built structure. To prevent \nthe concentrated power of publishers, they built a structure that kept \ncopyrights away from publishers and kept them short. To prevent the concentrated \npower of a church, they banned the federal government from establishing a \nchurch. To prevent concentrating power in the federal government, they built \nstructures to reinforce the power of the statesincluding the Senate, whose \nmembers were at the time selected by the states, and an electoral college, also \nselected by the states, to select the president. In each case, a structure \nbuilt checks and balances into the constitutional frame, structured to prevent \notherwise inevitable concentrations of power.",
        "I doubt the framers would recognize the regulation we call copyright today. \nThe scope of that regulation is far beyond anything they ever considered. To \nbegin to understand what they did, we need to put our copyright in context: We \nneed to see how it has changed in the 210 years since they first struck its \ndesign.",
        "Some of these changes come from the law: some in light of changes in technology, \nand some in light of changes in technology given a particular concentration of \nmarket power. In terms of our model, we started here:",
        "[Image: alt text.]",
        "We will end here:",
        "[Image: alt text.]",
        "Let me explain how.",
        "When the first Congress enacted laws to protect creative property, it faced the \nsame uncertainty about the status of creative property that the English had \nconfronted in 1774. Many states had passed laws protecting creative property, \nand some believed that these laws simply supplemented common law rights that \nalready protected creative authorship. [8] This meant that there was no \nguaranteed public domain in the United States in 1790. If copyrights were \nprotected by the common law, then there was no simple way to know whether a work \npublished in the United States was controlled or free. Just as in England, this \nlingering uncertainty would make it hard for publishers to rely upon a public \ndomain to reprint and distribute works.",
        "That uncertainty ended after Congress passed legislation granting copyrights. \nBecause federal law overrides any contrary state law, federal protections for \ncopyrighted works displaced any state law protections. Just as in England the \nStatute of Anne eventually meant that the copyrights for all English works \nexpired, a federal statute meant that any state copyrights expired as well.",
        "In 1790, Congress enacted the first copyright law. It created a federal \ncopyright and secured that copyright for fourteen years. If the author was alive \nat the end of that fourteen years, then he could opt to renew the copyright for \nanother fourteen years. If he did not renew the copyright, his work passed into \nthe public domain.",
        "While there were many works created in the United States in the first ten years \nof the Republic, only 5 percent of the works were actually registered under the \nfederal copyright regime. Of all the work created in the United States both \nbefore 1790 and from 1790 through 1800, 95 percent immediately passed into the \npublic domain; the balance would pass into the pubic domain within twenty-eight \nyears at most, and more likely within fourteen years. [9]",
        "This system of renewal was a crucial part of the American system of copyright. \nIt assured that the maximum terms of copyright would be granted only for works \nwhere they were wanted. After the initial term of fourteen years, if it wasn’t \nworth it to an author to renew his copyright, then it wasn’t worth it to society \nto insist on the copyright, either.",
        "Fourteen years may not seem long to us, but for the vast majority of copyright \nowners at that time, it was long enough: Only a small minority of them renewed \ntheir copyright after fourteen years; the balance allowed their work to pass \ninto the public domain. [10]",
        "Even today, this structure would make sense. Most creative work has an actual \ncommercial life of just a couple of years. Most books fall out of print after \none year. [11] When that happens, the used books are traded free of copyright \nregulation. Thus the books are no longer effectively controlled by copyright. \nThe only practical commercial use of the books at that time is to sell the books \nas used books; that usebecause it does not involve publicationis effectively \nfree.",
        "In the first hundred years of the Republic, the term of copyright was changed \nonce. In 1831, the term was increased from a maximum of 28 years to a maximum of \n42 by increasing the initial term of copyright from 14 years to 28 years. In the \nnext fifty years of the Republic, the term increased once again. In 1909, \nCongress extended the renewal term of 14 years to 28 years, setting a maximum \nterm of 56 years.",
        "Then, beginning in 1962, Congress started a practice that has defined copyright \nlaw since. Eleven times in the last forty years, Congress has extended the terms \nof existing copyrights; twice in those forty years, Congress extended the term \nof future copyrights. Initially, the extensions of existing copyrights were \nshort, a mere one to two years. In 1976, Congress extended all existing \ncopyrights by nineteen years. And in 1998, in the Sonny Bono Copyright Term \nExtension Act, Congress extended the term of existing and future copyrights by \ntwenty years.",
        "The effect of these extensions is simply to toll, or delay, the passing of works \ninto the public domain. This latest extension means that the public domain will \nhave been tolled for thirty-nine out of fifty-five years, or 70 percent of the \ntime since 1962. Thus, in the twenty years after the Sonny Bono Act, while one \nmillion patents will pass into the public domain, zero copyrights will pass into \nthe public domain by virtue of the expiration of a copyright term.",
        "The effect of these extensions has been exacerbated by another, little-noticed \nchange in the copyright law. Remember I said that the framers established a two-\npart copyright regime, requiring a copyright owner to renew his copyright after \nan initial term. The requirement of renewal meant that works that no longer \nneeded copyright protection would pass more quickly into the public domain. The \nworks remaining under protection would be those that had some continuing \ncommercial value.",
        "The United States abandoned this sensible system in 1976. For all works created \nafter 1978, there was only one copyright termthe maximum term. For natural \nauthors, that term was life plus fifty years. For corporations, the term was \nseventy-five years. Then, in 1992, Congress abandoned the renewal requirement \nfor all works created before 1978. All works still under copyright would be \naccorded the maximum term then available. After the Sonny Bono Act, that term \nwas ninety-five years.",
        "This change meant that American law no longer had an automatic way to assure \nthat works that were no longer exploited passed into the public domain. And \nindeed, after these changes, it is unclear whether it is even possible to put \nworks into the public domain. The public domain is orphaned by these changes in \ncopyright law. Despite the requirement that terms be limited, we have no \nevidence that anything will limit them.",
        "The effect of these changes on the average duration of copyright is dramatic. In \n1973, more than 85 percent of copyright owners failed to renew their copyright. \nThat meant that the average term of copyright in 1973 was just 32.2 years. \nBecause of the elimination of the renewal requirement, the average term of \ncopyright is now the maximum term. In thirty years, then, the average term has \ntripled, from 32.2 years to 95 years. [12]",
        "Law: Scope",
        "The scope of a copyright is the range of rights granted by the law. The scope \nof American copyright has changed dramatically. Those changes are not \nnecessarily bad. But we should understand the extent of the changes if we’re to \nkeep this debate in context.",
        "In 1790, that scope was very narrow. Copyright covered only maps, charts, and \nbooks. That means it didn’t cover, for example, music or architecture. More \nsignificantly, the right granted by a copyright gave the author the exclusive \nright to publish copyrighted works. That means someone else violated the \ncopyright only if he republished the work without the copyright owner’s \npermission. Finally, the right granted by a copyright was an exclusive right to \nthat particular book. The right did not extend to what lawyers call derivative \nworks. It would not, therefore, interfere with the right of someone other than \nthe author to translate a copyrighted book, or to adapt the story to a different \nform (such as a drama based on a published book).",
        "This, too, has changed dramatically. While the contours of copyright today are \nextremely hard to describe simply, in general terms, the right covers \npractically any creative work that is reduced to a tangible form. It covers \nmusic as well as architecture, drama as well as computer programs. It gives the \ncopyright owner of that creative work not only the exclusive right to publish \nthe work, but also the exclusive right of control over any copies of that \nwork. And most significant for our purposes here, the right gives the copyright \nowner control over not only his or her particular work, but also any derivative \nwork that might grow out of the original work. In this way, the right covers \nmore creative work, protects the creative work more broadly, and protects works \nthat are based in a significant way on the initial creative work.",
        "At the same time that the scope of copyright has expanded, procedural \nlimitations on the right have been relaxed. I’ve already described the complete \nremoval of the renewal requirement in 1992. In addition to the renewal \nrequirement, for most of the history of American copyright law, there was a \nrequirement that a work be registered before it could receive the protection of \na copyright. There was also a requirement that any copyrighted work be marked \neither with that famous © or the word copyright. And for most of the history \nof American copyright law, there was a requirement that works be deposited with \nthe government before a copyright could be secured.",
        "The reason for the registration requirement was the sensible understanding that \nfor most works, no copyright was required. Again, in the first ten years of the \nRepublic, 95 percent of works eligible for copyright were never copyrighted. \nThus, the rule reflected the norm: Most works apparently didn’t need copyright, \nso registration narrowed the regulation of the law to the few that did. The same \nreasoning justified the requirement that a work be marked as copyrightedthat \nway it was easy to know whether a copyright was being claimed. The requirement \nthat works be deposited was to assure that after the copyright expired, there \nwould be a copy of the work somewhere so that it could be copied by others \nwithout locating the original author.",
        "All of these formalities were abolished in the American system when we decided \nto follow European copyright law. There is no requirement that you register a \nwork to get a copyright; the copyright now is automatic; the copyright exists \nwhether or not you mark your work with a ©; and the copyright exists whether or \nnot you actually make a copy available for others to copy.",
        "Consider a practical example to understand the scope of these differences.",
        "If, in 1790, you wrote a book and you were one of the 5 percent who actually \ncopyrighted that book, then the copyright law protected you against another \npublisher’s taking your book and republishing it without your permission. The \naim of the act was to regulate publishers so as to prevent that kind of unfair \ncompetition. In 1790, there were 174 publishers in the United States. [13] The \nCopyright Act was thus a tiny regulation of a tiny proportion of a tiny part of \nthe creative market in the United Statespublishers.",
        "The act left other creators totally unregulated. If I copied your poem by hand, \nover and over again, as a way to learn it by heart, my act was totally \nunregulated by the 1790 act. If I took your novel and made a play based upon it, \nor if I translated it or abridged it, none of those activities were regulated by \nthe original copyright act. These creative activities remained free, while the \nactivities of publishers were restrained.",
        "Today the story is very different: If you write a book, your book is \nautomatically protected. Indeed, not just your book. Every e-mail, every note to \nyour spouse, every doodle, every creative act that’s reduced to a tangible \nformall of this is automatically copyrighted. There is no need to register or \nmark your work. The protection follows the creation, not the steps you take to \nprotect it.",
        "That protection gives you the right (subject to a narrow range of fair use \nexceptions) to control how others copy the work, whether they copy it to \nrepublish it or to share an excerpt.",
        "That much is the obvious part. Any system of copyright would control competing \npublishing. But there’s a second part to the copyright of today that is not at \nall obvious. This is the protection of derivative rights. If you write a book, \nno one can make a movie out of your book without permission. No one can \ntranslate it without permission. CliffsNotes can’t make an abridgment unless \npermission is granted. All of these derivative uses of your original work are \ncontrolled by the copyright holder. The copyright, in other words, is now not \njust an exclusive right to your writings, but an exclusive right to your \nwritings and a large proportion of the writings inspired by them.",
        "It is this derivative right that would seem most bizarre to our framers, though \nit has become second nature to us. Initially, this expansion was created to deal \nwith obvious evasions of a narrower copyright. If I write a book, can you change \none word and then claim a copyright in a new and different book? Obviously that \nwould make a joke of the copyright, so the law was properly expanded to include \nthose slight modifications as well as the verbatim original work.",
        "In preventing that joke, the law created an astonishing power within a free \ncultureat least, it’s astonishing when you understand that the law applies not \njust to the commercial publisher but to anyone with a computer. I understand the \nwrong in duplicating and selling someone else’s work. But whatever that wrong \nis, transforming someone else’s work is a different wrong. Some view \ntransformation as no wrong at allthey believe that our law, as the framers \npenned it, should not protect derivative rights at all. [14] Whether or not you \ngo that far, it seems plain that whatever wrong is involved is fundamentally \ndifferent from the wrong of direct piracy.",
        "Yet copyright law treats these two different wrongs in the same way. I can go to \ncourt and get an injunction against your pirating my book. I can go to court and \nget an injunction against your transformative use of my book. [15] These two \ndifferent uses of my creative work are treated the same.",
        "This again may seem right to you. If I wrote a book, then why should you be able \nto write a movie that takes my story and makes money from it without paying me \nor crediting me? Or if Disney creates a creature called Mickey Mouse, why \nshould you be able to make Mickey Mouse toys and be the one to trade on the \nvalue that Disney originally created?",
        "These are good arguments, and, in general, my point is not that the derivative \nright is unjustified. My aim just now is much narrower: simply to make clear \nthat this expansion is a significant change from the rights originally granted.",
        "Law and Architecture: Reach",
        "Whereas originally the law regulated only publishers, the change in copyright’s \nscope means that the law today regulates publishers, users, and authors. It \nregulates them because all three are capable of making copies, and the core of \nthe regulation of copyright law is copies. [16]",
        "Copies. That certainly sounds like the obvious thing for copy/right law to \nregulate. But as with Jack Valenti’s argument at the start of this chapter, that \ncreative property deserves the same rights as all other property, it is the \n/obvious that we need to be most careful about. For while it may be obvious \nthat in the world before the Internet, copies were the obvious trigger for \ncopyright law, upon reflection, it should be obvious that in the world with the \nInternet, copies should not be the trigger for copyright law. More precisely, \nthey should not always be the trigger for copyright law.",
        "This is perhaps the central claim of this book, so let me take this very slowly \nso that the point is not easily missed. My claim is that the Internet should at \nleast force us to rethink the conditions under which the law of copyright \nautomatically applies, [17] because it is clear that the current reach of \ncopyright was never contemplated, much less chosen, by the legislators who \nenacted copyright law.",
        "We can see this point abstractly by beginning with this largely empty circle.",
        "[Image: large circle containing the word uses’.]",
        "Think about a book in real space, and imagine this circle to represent all its \npotential uses. Most of these uses are unregulated by copyright law, because \nthe uses don’t create a copy. If you read a book, that act is not regulated by \ncopyright law. If you give someone the book, that act is not regulated by \ncopyright law. If you resell a book, that act is not regulated (copyright law \nexpressly states that after the first sale of a book, the copyright owner can \nimpose no further conditions on the disposition of the book). If you sleep on \nthe book or use it to hold up a lamp or let your puppy chew it up, those acts \nare not regulated by copyright law, because those acts do not make a copy.",
        "[Image: alt text.]",
        "Obviously, however, some uses of a copyrighted book are regulated by copyright \nlaw. Republishing the book, for example, makes a copy. It is therefore regulated \nby copyright law. Indeed, this particular use stands at the core of this circle \nof possible uses of a copyrighted work. It is the paradigmatic use properly \nregulated by copyright regulation (see first diagram on next page).",
        "[Image: alt text.]",
        "Finally, there is a tiny sliver of otherwise regulated copying uses that remain \nunregulated because the law considers these fair uses.  These are uses that \nthemselves involve copying, but which the law treats as unregulated because \npublic policy demands that they remain unregulated. You are free to quote from \nthis book, even in a review that is quite negative, without my permission, even \nthough that quoting makes a copy. That copy would ordinarily give the copyright \nowner the exclusive right to say whether the copy is allowed or not, but the law \ndenies the owner any exclusive right over such fair uses for public policy \n(and possibly First Amendment) reasons.",
        "[image: alt text.]\n[image: alt text.]",
        "In real space, then, the possible uses of a book are divided into three sorts: \n(1) unregulated uses, (2) regulated uses, and (3) regulated uses that are \nnonetheless deemed fair regardless of the copyright owner’s views.",
        "Enter the Interneta distributed, digital network where every use of a \ncopyrighted work produces a copy. [18] And because of this single, arbitrary \nfeature of the design of a digital network, the scope of category 1 changes \ndramatically. Uses that before were presumptively unregulated are now \npresumptively regulated. No longer is there a set of presumptively unregulated \nuses that define a freedom associated with a copyrighted work. Instead, each use \nis now subject to the copyright, because each use also makes a copycategory 1 \ngets sucked into category 2. And those who would defend the unregulated uses of \ncopyrighted work must look exclusively to category 3, fair uses, to bear the \nburden of this shift.",
        "So let’s be very specific to make this general point clear. Before the Internet, \nif you purchased a book and read it ten times, there would be no plausible \n/copyright/-related argument that the copyright owner could make to control that \nuse of her book. Copyright law would have nothing to say about whether you read \nthe book once, ten times, or every night before you went to bed. None of those \ninstances of usereadingcould be regulated by copyright law because none of \nthose uses produced a copy.",
        "But the same book as an e-book is effectively governed by a different set of \nrules. Now if the copyright owner says you may read the book only once or only \nonce a month, then copyright law would aid the copyright owner in exercising \nthis degree of control, because of the accidental feature of copyright law that \ntriggers its application upon there being a copy. Now if you read the book ten \ntimes and the license says you may read it only five times, then whenever you \nread the book (or any portion of it) beyond the fifth time, you are making a \ncopy of the book contrary to the copyright owner’s wish.",
        "There are some people who think this makes perfect sense. My aim just now is not \nto argue about whether it makes sense or not. My aim is only to make clear the \nchange. Once you see this point, a few other points also become clear:",
        "First, making category 1 disappear is not anything any policy maker ever \nintended. Congress did not think through the collapse of the presumptively \nunregulated uses of copyrighted works. There is no evidence at all that policy \nmakers had this idea in mind when they allowed our policy here to shift. \nUnregulated uses were an important part of free culture before the Internet.",
        "Second, this shift is especially troubling in the context of transformative uses \nof creative content. Again, we can all understand the wrong in commercial \npiracy. But the law now purports to regulate any transformation you make of \ncreative work using a machine. Copy and paste and cut and paste become \ncrimes. Tinkering with a story and releasing it to others exposes the tinkerer \nto at least a requirement of justification. However troubling the expansion with \nrespect to copying a particular work, it is extraordinarily troubling with \nrespect to transformative uses of creative work.",
        "Third, this shift from category 1 to category 2 puts an extraordinary burden on \ncategory 3 (fair use”) that fair use never before had to bear. If a copyright \nowner now tried to control how many times I could read a book on-line, the \nnatural response would be to argue that this is a violation of my fair use \nrights. But there has never been any litigation about whether I have a fair use \nright to read, because before the Internet, reading did not trigger the \napplication of copyright law and hence the need for a fair use defense. The \nright to read was effectively protected before because reading was not \nregulated.",
        "This point about fair use is totally ignored, even by advocates for free \nculture. We have been cornered into arguing that our rights depend upon fair \nusenever even addressing the earlier question about the expansion in effective \nregulation. A thin protection grounded in fair use makes sense when the vast \nmajority of uses are unregulated. But when everything becomes presumptively \nregulated, then the protections of fair use are not enough.",
        "The case of Video Pipeline is a good example. Video Pipeline was in the business \nof making trailer advertisements for movies available to video stores. The \nvideo stores displayed the trailers as a way to sell videos. Video Pipeline got \nthe trailers from the film distributors, put the trailers on tape, and sold the \ntapes to the retail stores.",
        "The company did this for about fifteen years. Then, in 1997, it began to think \nabout the Internet as another way to distribute these previews. The idea was to \nexpand their selling by sampling technique by giving on-line stores the same \nability to enable browsing. Just as in a bookstore you can read a few pages of \na book before you buy the book, so, too, you would be able to sample a bit from \nthe movie on-line before you bought it.",
        "In 1998, Video Pipeline informed Disney and other film distributors that it \nintended to distribute the trailers through the Internet (rather than sending \nthe tapes) to distributors of their videos. Two years later, Disney told Video \nPipeline to stop. The owner of Video Pipeline asked Disney to talk about the \nmatterhe had built a business on distributing this content as a way to help \nsell Disney films; he had customers who depended upon his delivering this \ncontent. Disney would agree to talk only if Video Pipeline stopped the \ndistribution immediately. Video Pipeline thought it was within their fair use” \nrights to distribute the clips as they had. So they filed a lawsuit to ask the \ncourt to declare that these rights were in fact their rights.",
        "Disney countersuedfor $100 million in damages. Those damages were predicated \nupon a claim that Video Pipeline had willfully infringed” on Disney’s \ncopyright. When a court makes a finding of willful infringement, it can award \ndamages not on the basis of the actual harm to the copyright owner, but on the \nbasis of an amount set in the statute. Because Video Pipeline had distributed \nseven hundred clips of Disney movies to enable video stores to sell copies of \nthose movies, Disney was now suing Video Pipeline for $100 million.",
        "Disney has the right to control its property, of course. But the video stores \nthat were selling Disney’s films also had some sort of right to be able to sell \nthe films that they had bought from Disney. Disney’s claim in court was that the \nstores were allowed to sell the films and they were permitted to list the titles \nof the films they were selling, but they were not allowed to show clips of the \nfilms as a way of selling them without Disney’s permission.",
        "Now, you might think this is a close case, and I think the courts would consider \nit a close case. My point here is to map the change that gives Disney this \npower. Before the Internet, Disney couldn’t really control how people got access \nto their content. Once a video was in the marketplace, the first-sale doctrine \nwould free the seller to use the video as he wished, including showing portions \nof it in order to engender sales of the entire movie video. But with the \nInternet, it becomes possible for Disney to centralize control over access to \nthis content. Because each use of the Internet produces a copy, use on the \nInternet becomes subject to the copyright owner’s control. The technology \nexpands the scope of effective control, because the technology builds a copy \ninto every transaction.",
        "No doubt, a potential is not yet an abuse, and so the potential for control is \nnot yet the abuse of control. Barnes & Noble has the right to say you can’t \ntouch a book in their store; property law gives them that right. But the market \neffectively protects against that abuse. If Barnes & Noble banned browsing, then \nconsumers would choose other bookstores. Competition protects against the \nextremes. And it may well be (my argument so far does not even question this) \nthat competition would prevent any similar danger when it comes to copyright. \nSure, publishers exercising the rights that authors have assigned to them might \ntry to regulate how many times you read a book, or try to stop you from sharing \nthe book with anyone. But in a competitive market such as the book market, the \ndangers of this happening are quite slight.",
        "Again, my aim so far is simply to map the changes that this changed architecture \nenables. Enabling technology to enforce the control of copyright means that the \ncontrol of copyright is no longer defined by balanced policy. The control of \ncopyright is simply what private owners choose. In some contexts, at least, that \nfact is harmless. But in some contexts it is a recipe for disaster.",
        "Architecture and Law: Force",
        "The disappearance of unregulated uses would be change enough, but a second \nimportant change brought about by the Internet magnifies its significance. This \nsecond change does not affect the reach of copyright regulation; it affects how \nsuch regulation is enforced.",
        "In the world before digital technology, it was generally the law that controlled \nwhether and how someone was regulated by copyright law. The law, meaning a \ncourt, meaning a judge: In the end, it was a human, trained in the tradition of \nthe law and cognizant of the balances that tradition embraced, who said whether \nand how the law would restrict your freedom.",
        "There’s a famous story about a battle between the Marx Brothers and Warner \nBrothers. The Marxes intended to make a parody of Casablanca. Warner Brothers \nobjected. They wrote a nasty letter to the Marxes, warning them that there would \nbe serious legal consequences if they went forward with their plan. [19]",
        "This led the Marx Brothers to respond in kind. They warned Warner Brothers that \nthe Marx Brothers were brothers long before you were. [20] The Marx Brothers \ntherefore owned the word brothers, and if Warner Brothers insisted on trying \nto control Casablanca, then the Marx Brothers would insist on control over \n/brothers.",
        "An absurd and hollow threat, of course, because Warner Brothers, like the Marx \nBrothers, knew that no court would ever enforce such a silly claim. This \nextremism was irrelevant to the real freedoms anyone (including Warner Brothers) \nenjoyed.",
        "On the Internet, however, there is no check on silly rules, because on the \nInternet, increasingly, rules are enforced not by a human but by a machine: \nIncreasingly, the rules of copyright law, as interpreted by the copyright owner, \nget built into the technology that delivers copyrighted content. It is code, \nrather than law, that rules. And the problem with code regulations is that, \nunlike law, code has no shame. Code would not get the humor of the Marx \nBrothers. The consequence of that is not at all funny.",

For works under \ncopyright, the copyright owner certainly does have the powerup to the limits of \nthe copyright law. But for work not under copyright, there is no such copyright \npower. [21] When my e-book of Middlemarch says I have the permission to copy \nonly ten text selections into the memory every ten days, what that really means \nis that the eBook Reader has enabled the publisher to control how I use the book \non my computer, far beyond the control that the law would enable.",
        "The control comes instead from the codefrom the technology within which the e-\nbook lives. Though the e-book says that these are permissions, they are not \nthe sort of permissions that most of us deal with.

If some company (call it Elcomsoft) developed a program to disable the \ntechnological protection built into an Adobe eBook so that a blind person, say, \ncould use a computer to read the book aloud, would Adobe agree that such a use \nof an eBook Reader was fair?

        "To see the point in a particularly absurd context, consider a favorite story of \nmine that makes the same point.",
        "Consider the robotic dog made by Sony named Aibo. The Aibo learns tricks, \ncuddles, and follows you around. It eats only electricity and that doesn’t leave \nthat much of a mess (at least in your house).",

        "The SDMI coalition had as its goal a technology to enable content owners to \nexercise much better control over their content than the Internet, as it \noriginally stood, granted them. Using encryption, SDMI hoped to develop a \nstandard that would allow the content owner to say this music cannot be \ncopied, and have a computer respect that command. The technology was to be part \nof a trusted system of control that would get content owners to trust the \nsystem of the Internet much more.",
        "When SDMI thought it was close to a standard, it set up a competition. In \nexchange for providing contestants with the code to an SDMI-encrypted bit of \ncontent, contestants were to try to crack it and, if they did, report the \nproblems to the consortium.",
        "Felten and his team figured out the encryption system quickly. He and the team \nsaw the weakness of this system as a type: Many encryption systems would suffer \nthe same weakness, and Felten and his team thought it worthwhile to point this \nout to those who study encryption.",
        "Let’s review just what Felten was doing. Again, this is the United States. We \nhave a principle of free speech. We have this principle not just because it is \nthe law, but also because it is a really great idea. A strongly protected \ntradition of free speech is likely to encourage a wide range of criticism. That \ncriticism is likely, in turn, to improve the systems or people or ideas \ncriticized.",
        "What Felten and his colleagues were doing was publishing a paper describing the \nweakness in a technology. They were not spreading free music, or building and \ndeploying this technology. The paper was an academic essay, unintelligible to \nmost people. But it clearly showed the weakness in the SDMI system, and why SDMI \nwould not, as presently constituted, succeed.",
        "What links these two, aibopet.com and Felten, is the letters they then received. \nAibopet.com received a letter from Sony about the aibopet.com hack. Though a \njazz-dancing dog is perfectly legal, Sony wrote:",
        "Your site contains information providing the means to circumvent AIBO-ware’s \ncopy protection protocol constituting a violation of the anti-circumvention \nprovisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.",
        "And though an academic paper describing the weakness in a system of encryption \nshould also be perfectly legal, Felten received a letter from an RIAA lawyer \nthat read:",
        "Any disclosure of information gained from participating in the Public Challenge \nwould be outside the scope of activities permitted by the Agreement and could \nsubject you and your research team to actions under the Digital Millennium \nCopyright Act (DMCA”).",
        "In both cases, this weirdly Orwellian law was invoked to control the spread of \ninformation. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act made spreading such \ninformation an offense.",
        "The DMCA was enacted as a response to copyright owners’ first fear about \ncyberspace. The fear was that copyright control was effectively dead; the \nresponse was to find technologies that might compensate. These new technologies \nwould be copyright protection technologies technologies to control the \nreplication and distribution of copyrighted material. They were designed as \n/code to modify the original code of the Internet, to reestablish some \nprotection for copyright owners.",
        "The DMCA was a bit of law intended to back up the protection of this code \ndesigned to protect copyrighted material. It was, we could say, legal code \nintended to buttress software code which itself was intended to support the \n/legal code of copyright.",
        "But the DMCA was not designed merely to protect copyrighted works to the extent \ncopyright law protected them. Its protection, that is, did not end at the line \nthat copyright law drew. The DMCA regulated devices that were designed to \ncircumvent copyright protection measures. It was designed to ban those devices, \nwhether or not the use of the copyrighted material made possible by that \ncircumvention would have been a copyright violation.",
        "Aibopet.com and Felten make the point. The Aibo hack circumvented a copyright \nprotection system for the purpose of enabling the dog to dance jazz. That \nenablement no doubt involved the use of copyrighted material. But as \naibopet.com’s site was noncommercial, and the use did not enable subsequent \ncopyright infringements, there’s no doubt that aibopet.com’s hack was fair use \nof Sony’s copyrighted material. Yet fair use is not a defense to the DMCA. The \nquestion is not whether the use of the copyrighted material was a copyright \nviolation. The question is whether a copyright protection system was \ncircumvented.",
        "The threat against Felten was more attenuated, but it followed the same line of \nreasoning. By publishing a paper describing how a copyright protection system \ncould be circumvented, the RIAA lawyer suggested, Felten himself was \ndistributing a circumvention technology. Thus, even though he was not himself \ninfringing anyone’s copyright, his academic paper was enabling others to \ninfringe others’ copyright.",
        "The bizarreness of these arguments is captured in a cartoon drawn in 1981 by \nPaul Conrad. At that time, a court in California had held that the VCR could be \nbanned because it was a copyright-infringing technology: It enabled consumers to \ncopy films without the permission of the copyright owner. No doubt there were \nuses of the technology that were legal: Fred Rogers, aka Mr. Rogers, for \nexample, had testified in that case that he wanted people to feel free to tape \n/Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood.",
        "Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the \nNeighborhood at hours when some children cannot use it. I think that it’s a \nreal service to families to be able to record such programs and show them at \nappropriate times. I have always felt that with the advent of all of this new \ntechnology that allows people to tape the Neighborhood off-the-air, and I’m \nspeaking for the Neighborhood” because that’s what I produce, that they then \nbecome much more active in the programming of their family’s television life. \nVery frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by others. My whole \napproach in broadcasting has always been You are an important person just the \nway you are. You can make healthy decisions. Maybe I’m going on too long, but I \njust feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in the control of \nhis or her life, in a healthy way, is important. [23] ",
        "Even though there were uses that were legal, because there were some uses that \nwere illegal, the court held the companies producing the VCR responsible.",
        "This led Conrad to draw the cartoon below, which we can adopt to the DMCA.",
        "No argument I have can top this picture, but let me try to get close.",
        "The anticircumvention provisions of the DMCA target copyright circumvention \ntechnologies. Circumvention technologies can be used for different ends. They \ncan be used, for example, to enable massive pirating of copyrighted materiala \nbad end. Or they can be used to enable the use of particular copyrighted \nmaterials in ways that would be considered fair usea good end.",
        "[image]",
        "A handgun can be used to shoot a police officer or a child. Most would agree \nsuch a use is bad. Or a handgun can be used for target practice or to protect \nagainst an intruder. At least some would say that such a use would be good. It, \ntoo, is a technology that has both good and bad uses.",
        "The obvious point of Conrad’s cartoon is the weirdness of a world where guns are \nlegal, despite the harm they can do, while VCRs (and circumvention technologies) \nare illegal. Flash: No one ever died from copyright circumvention. Yet the law \nbans circumvention technologies absolutely, despite the potential that they \nmight do some good, but permits guns, despite the obvious and tragic harm they \ndo.",
        "The Aibo and RIAA examples demonstrate how copyright owners are changing the \nbalance that copyright law grants. Using code, copyright owners restrict fair \nuse; using the DMCA, they punish those who would attempt to evade the \nrestrictions on fair use that they impose through code. Technology becomes a \nmeans by which fair use can be erased; the law of the DMCA backs up that \nerasing.",
        "This is how code becomes law. The controls built into the technology of copy \nand access protection become rules the violation of which is also a violation of \nthe law. In this way, the code extends the lawincreasing its regulation, even \nif the subject it regulates (activities that would otherwise plainly constitute \nfair use) is beyond the reach of the law. Code becomes law; code extends the \nlaw; code thus extends the control that copyright owners effectat least for \nthose copyright holders with the lawyers who can write the nasty letters that \nFelten and aibopet.com received.",
        "There is one final aspect of the interaction between architecture and law that \ncontributes to the force of copyright’s regulation. This is the ease with which \ninfringements of the law can be detected. For contrary to the rhetoric common at \nthe birth of cyberspace that on the Internet, no one knows you’re a dog, \nincreasingly, given changing technologies deployed on the Internet, it is easy \nto find the dog who committed a legal wrong. The technologies of the Internet \nare open to snoops as well as sharers, and the snoops are increasingly good at \ntracking down the identity of those who violate the rules.",
        "For example, imagine you were part of a Star Trek fan club. You gathered every \nmonth to share trivia, and maybe to enact a kind of fan fiction about the show. \nOne person would play Spock, another, Captain Kirk. The characters would begin \nwith a plot from a real story, then simply continue it. [24]",
        "Before the Internet, this was, in effect, a totally unregulated activity. No \nmatter what happened inside your club room, you would never be interfered with \nby the copyright police. You were free in that space to do as you wished with \nthis part of our culture. You were allowed to build on it as you wished without \nfear of legal control.",
        "But if you moved your club onto the Internet, and made it generally available \nfor others to join, the story would be very different. Bots scouring the Net for \ntrademark and copyright infringement would quickly find your site. Your posting \nof fan fiction, depending upon the ownership of the series that you’re \ndepicting, could well inspire a lawyer’s threat. And ignoring the lawyer’s \nthreat would be extremely costly indeed. The law of copyright is extremely \nefficient. The penalties are severe, and the process is quick.",
        "This change in the effective force of the law is caused by a change in the ease \nwith which the law can be enforced. That change too shifts the law’s balance \nradically. It is as if your car transmitted the speed at which you traveled at \nevery moment that you drove; that would be just one step before the state \nstarted issuing tickets based upon the data you transmitted. That is, in effect, \nwhat is happening here.",
        "So copyright’s duration has increased dramaticallytripled in the past thirty \nyears. And copyright’s scope has increased as wellfrom regulating only \npublishers to now regulating just about everyone. And copyright’s reach has \nchanged, as every action becomes a copy and hence presumptively regulated. And \nas technologists find better ways to control the use of content, and as \ncopyright is increasingly enforced through technology, copyright’s force \nchanges, too. Misuse is easier to find and easier to control. This regulation of \nthe creative process, which began as a tiny regulation governing a tiny part of \nthe market for creative work, has become the single most important regulator of \ncreativity there is. It is a massive expansion in the scope of the government’s \ncontrol over innovation and creativity; it would be totally unrecognizable to \nthose who gave birth to copyright’s control.",
        "Still, in my view, all of these changes would not matter much if it weren’t for \none more change that we must also consider. This is a change that is in some \nsense the most familiar, though its significance and scope are not well \nunderstood. It is the one that creates precisely the reason to be concerned \nabout all the other changes I have described.",
        "This is the change in the concentration and integration of the media. In the \npast twenty years, the nature of media ownership has undergone a radical \nalteration, caused by changes in legal rules governing the media. Before this \nchange happened, the different forms of media were owned by separate media \ncompanies. Now, the media is increasingly owned by only a few companies. Indeed, \nafter the changes that the FCC announced in June 2003, most expect that within a \nfew years, we will live in a world where just three companies control more than \n85 percent of the media.",
        "These changes are of two sorts: the scope of concentration, and its nature.",
        "Changes in scope are the easier ones to describe. As Senator John McCain \nsummarized the data produced in the FCC’s review of media ownership, five \ncompanies control 85 percent of our media sources. [25] The five recording \nlabels of Universal Music Group, BMG, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music \nGroup, and EMI control 84.8 percent of the U.S. music market. [26] The five \nlargest cable companies pipe programming to 74 percent of the cable subscribers \nnationwide. [27]",
        "The story with radio is even more dramatic. Before deregulation, the nation’s \nlargest radio broadcasting conglomerate owned fewer than seventy-five stations. \nToday one company owns more than 1,200 stations. During that period of \nconsolidation, the total number of radio owners dropped by 34 percent. Today, in \nmost markets, the two largest broadcasters control 74 percent of that market’s \nrevenues. Overall, just four companies control 90 percent of the nation’s radio \nadvertising revenues.",
        "Newspaper ownership is becoming more concentrated as well. Today, there are six \nhundred fewer daily newspapers in the United States than there were eighty years \nago, and ten companies control half of the nation’s circulation. There are \ntwenty major newspaper publishers in the United States. The top ten film studios \nreceive 99 percent of all film revenue. The ten largest cable companies account \nfor 85 percent of all cable revenue. This is a market far from the free press \nthe framers sought to protect. Indeed, it is a market that is quite well \nprotectedby the market.",
        "Concentration in size alone is one thing. The more invidious change is in the \nnature of that concentration. As author James Fallows put it in a recent article \nabout Rupert Murdoch,",
        "Murdoch’s companies now constitute a production system unmatched in its \nintegration. They supply contentFox movies ... Fox TV shows ... Fox-controlled \nsports broadcasts, plus newspapers and books. They sell the content to the \npublic and to advertisersin newspapers, on the broadcast network, on the cable \nchannels. And they operate the physical distribution system through which the \ncontent reaches the customers. Murdoch’s satellite systems now distribute News \nCorp. content in Europe and Asia; if Murdoch becomes DirecTV’s largest single \nowner, that system will serve the same function in the United States. [28]",
        "The pattern with Murdoch is the pattern of modern media. Not just large \ncompanies owning many radio stations, but a few companies owning as many outlets \nof media as possible. A picture describes this pattern better than a thousand \nwords could do:",
        "[image]",
        "Does this concentration matter? Will it affect what is made, or what is \ndistributed? Or is it merely a more efficient way to produce and distribute \ncontent?",
        "My view was that concentration wouldn’t matter. I thought it was nothing more \nthan a more efficient financial structure. But now, after reading and listening \nto a barrage of creators try to convince me to the contrary, I am beginning to \nchange my mind.",
        "Here’s a representative story that begins to suggest how this integration may \nmatter.",
        "In 1969, Norman Lear created a pilot for All in the Family. He took the pilot \nto ABC. The network didn’t like it. It was too edgy, they told Lear. Make it \nagain. Lear made a second pilot, more edgy than the first. ABC was exasperated. \nYou’re missing the point, they told Lear. We wanted less edgy, not more.",
        "Rather than comply, Lear simply took the show elsewhere. CBS was happy to have \nthe series; ABC could not stop Lear from walking. The copyrights that Lear held \nassured an independence from network control. [29]",
        "The network did not control those copyrights because the law forbade the \nnetworks from controlling the content they syndicated. The law required a \nseparation between the networks and the content producers; that separation would \nguarantee Lear freedom. And as late as 1992, because of these rules, the vast \nmajority of prime time television75 percent of itwas independent of the \nnetworks.",
        "In 1994, the FCC abandoned the rules that required this independence. After that \nchange, the networks quickly changed the balance. In 1985, there were twenty-\nfive independent television production studios; in 2002, only five independent \ntelevision studios remained. In 1992, only 15 percent of new series were \nproduced for a network by a company it controlled. Last year, the percentage of \nshows produced by controlled companies more than quintupled to 77 percent. In \n1992, 16 new series were produced independently of conglomerate control, last \nyear there was one. [30] In 2002, 75 percent of prime time television was owned \nby the networks that ran it. In the ten-year period between 1992 and 2002, the \nnumber of prime time television hours per week produced by network studios \nincreased over 200%, whereas the number of prime time television hours per week \nproduced by independent studios decreased 63%. [31]",
        "Today, another Norman Lear with another All in the Family would find that he \nhad the choice either to make the show less edgy or to be fired: The content of \nany show developed for a network is increasingly owned by the network.",
        "While the number of channels has increased dramatically, the ownership of those \nchannels has narrowed to an ever smaller and smaller few. As Barry Diller said \nto Bill Moyers,",
        "Well, if you have companies that produce, that finance, that air on their \nchannel and then distribute worldwide everything that goes through their \ncontrolled distribution system, then what you get is fewer and fewer actual \nvoices participating in the process. [We u]sed to have dozens and dozens of \nthriving independent production companies producing television programs. Now you \nhave less than a handful. [32]",
        "This narrowing has an effect on what is produced. The product of such large and \nconcentrated networks is increasingly homogenous. Increasingly safe. \nIncreasingly sterile. The product of news shows from networks like this is \nincreasingly tailored to the message the network wants to convey. This is not \nthe communist party, though from the inside, it must feel a bit like the \ncommunist party. No one can question without risk of consequencenot necessarily \nbanishment to Siberia, but punishment nonetheless. Independent, critical, \ndifferent views are quashed. This is not the environment for a democracy.",
        "Economics itself offers a parallel that explains why this integration affects \ncreativity. Clay Christensen has written about the Innovator’s Dilemma: the \nfact that large traditional firms find it rational to ignore new, breakthrough \ntechnologies that compete with their core business. The same analysis could help \nexplain why large, traditional media companies would find it rational to ignore \nnew cultural trends. [33] Lumbering giants not only don’t, but should not, \nsprint. Yet if the field is only open to the giants, there will be far too \nlittle sprinting.",
        "I don’t think we know enough about the economics of the media market to say with \ncertainty what concentration and integration will do. The efficiencies are \nimportant, and the effect on culture is hard to measure.",
        "But there is a quintessentially obvious example that does strongly suggest the \nconcern.",
        "In addition to the copyright wars, we’re in the middle of the drug wars. \nGovernment policy is strongly directed against the drug cartels; criminal and \ncivil courts are filled with the consequences of this battle.",
        "Let me hereby disqualify myself from any possible appointment to any position in \ngovernment by saying I believe this war is a profound mistake. I am not pro \ndrugs. Indeed, I come from a family once wrecked by drugsthough the drugs that \nwrecked my family were all quite legal. I believe this war is a profound mistake \nbecause the collateral damage from it is so great as to make waging the war \ninsane. When you add together the burdens on the criminal justice system, the \ndesperation of generations of kids whose only real economic opportunities are as \ndrug warriors, the queering of constitutional protections because of the \nconstant surveillance this war requires, and, most profoundly, the total \ndestruction of the legal systems of many South American nations because of the \npower of the local drug cartels, I find it impossible to believe that the \nmarginal benefit in reduced drug consumption by Americans could possibly \noutweigh these costs.",
        "You may not be convinced. That’s fine. We live in a democracy, and it is through \nvotes that we are to choose policy. But to do that, we depend fundamentally upon \nthe press to help inform Americans about these issues.",
        "Beginning in 1998, the Office of National Drug Control Policy launched a media \ncampaign as part of the war on drugs. The campaign produced scores of short \nfilm clips about issues related to illegal drugs. In one series (the Nick and \nNorm series) two men are in a bar, discussing the idea of legalizing drugs as a \nway to avoid some of the collateral damage from the war. One advances an \nargument in favor of drug legalization. The other responds in a powerful and \neffective way against the argument of the first. In the end, the first guy \nchanges his mind (hey, it’s television). The plug at the end is a damning attack \non the pro-legalization campaign.",
        "Fair enough. It’s a good ad. Not terribly misleading. It delivers its message \nwell. It’s a fair and reasonable message.",
        "But let’s say you think it is a wrong message, and you’d like to run a \ncountercommercial. Say you want to run a series of ads that try to demonstrate \nthe extraordinary collateral harm that comes from the drug war. Can you do it?",
        "Well,obviously, these ads cost lots of money. Assume you raise the money. Assume \na group of concerned citizens donates all the money in the world to help you get \nyour message out. Can you be sure your message will be heard then?",
        "No.You cannot. Television stations have a general policy of avoiding \ncontroversial ads. Ads sponsored by the government are deemed uncontroversial; \nads disagreeing with the government are controversial. This selectivity might be \nthought inconsistent with the First Amendment, but the Supreme Court has held \nthat stations have the right to choose what they run. Thus, the major channels \nof commercial media will refuse one side of a crucial debate the opportunity to \npresent its case. And the courts will defend the rights of the stations to be \nthis biased. [34]",
        "I’d be happy to defend the networks’ rights, as wellif we lived in a media \nmarket that was truly diverse. But concentration in the media throws that \ncondition into doubt. If a handful of companies control access to the media, and \nthat handful of companies gets to decide which political positions it will allow \nto be promoted on its channels, then in an obvious and important way, \nconcentration matters. You might like the positions the handful of companies \nselects. But you should not like a world in which a mere few get to decide which \nissues the rest of us get to know about.",
        "There is something innocent and obvious about the claim of the copyright \nwarriors that the government should protect my property. In the abstract, it \nis obviously true and, ordinarily, totally harmless. No sane sort who is not an \nanarchist could disagree.",
        "But when we see how dramatically this property has changed when we recognize \nhow it might now interact with both technology and markets to mean that the \neffective constraint on the liberty to cultivate our culture is dramatically \ndifferentthe claim begins to seem less innocent and obvious. Given (1) the \npower of technology to supplement the law’s control, and (2) the power of \nconcentrated markets to weaken the opportunity for dissent, if strictly \nenforcing the massively expanded property rights granted by copyright \nfundamentally changes the freedom within this culture to cultivate and build \nupon our past, then we have to ask whether this property should be redefined.",
        "Not starkly. Or absolutely. My point is not that we should abolish copyright or \ngo back to the eighteenth century. That would be a total mistake, disastrous for \nthe most important creative enterprises within our culture today.",
        "But there is a space between zero and one, Internet culture notwithstanding. And \nthese massive shifts in the effective power of copyright regulation, tied to \nincreased concentration of the content industry and resting in the hands of \ntechnology that will increasingly enable control over the use of culture, should \ndrive us to consider whether another adjustment is called for. Not an adjustment \nthat increases copyright’s power. Not an adjustment that increases its term. \nRather, an adjustment to restore the balance that has traditionally defined \ncopyright’s regulationa weakening of that regulation, to strengthen creativity.",
        "Copyright law has not been a rock of Gibraltar. It’s not a set of constant \ncommitments that, for some mysterious reason, teenagers and geeks now flout. \nInstead, copyright power has grown dramatically in a short period of time, as \nthe technologies of distribution and creation have changed and as lobbyists have \npushed for more control by copyright holders. Changes in the past in response to \nchanges in technology suggest that we may well need similar changes in the \nfuture. And these changes have to be reductions in the scope of copyright, in \nresponse to the extraordinary increase in control that technology and the market \nenable.",
        "For the single point that is lost in this war on pirates is a point that we see \nonly after surveying the range of these changes. When you add together the \neffect of changing law, concentrated markets, and changing technology, together \nthey produce an astonishing conclusion: Never in our history have fewer had a \nlegal right to control more of the development of our culture than now.",
        "Not when copyrights were perpetual, for when copyrights were perpetual, they \naffected only that precise creative work. Not when only publishers had the tools \nto publish, for the market then was much more diverse. Not when there were only \nthree television networks, for even then, newspapers, film studios, radio \nstations, and publishers were independent of the networks. Never has copyright \nprotected such a wide range of rights, against as broad a range of actors, for a \nterm that was remotely as long. This form of regulationa tiny regulation of a \ntiny part of the creative energy of a nation at the foundingis now a massive \nregulation of the overall creative process. Law plus technology plus the market \nnow interact to turn this historically benign regulation into the most \nsignificant regulation of culture that our free society has known. [35]",
        "This has been a long chapter. Its point can now be briefly stated.",
        "At the start of this book, I distinguished between commercial and noncommercial \nculture. In the course of this chapter, I have distinguished between copying a \nwork and transforming it. We can now combine these two distinctions and draw a \nclear map of the changes that copyright law has undergone.",
        "In 1790, the law looked like this:",
        "The act of publishing a map, chart, and book was regulated by copyright law. \nNothing else was. Transformations were free. And as copyright attached only with \nregistration, and only those who intended to benefit commercially would \nregister, copying through publishing of noncommercial work was also free.",
        "By the end of the nineteenth century, the law had changed to this:",
        "Derivative works were now regulated by copyright lawif published, which again, \ngiven the economics of publishing at the time, means if offered commercially. \nBut noncommercial publishing and transformation were still essentially free.",
        "In 1909 the law changed to regulate copies, not publishing, and after this \nchange, the scope of the law was tied to technology. As the technology of \ncopying became more prevalent, the reach of the law expanded. Thus by 1975, as \nphotocopying machines became more common, we could say the law began to look \nlike this:",
        "The law was interpreted to reach noncommercial copying through, say, copy \nmachines, but still much of copying outside of the commercial market remained \nfree. But the consequence of the emergence of digital technologies, especially \nin the context of a digital network, means that the law now looks like this:",
        "Every realm is governed by copyright law, whereas before most creativity was \nnot. The law now regulates the full range of creativitycommercial or not, \ntransformative or notwith the same rules designed to regulate commercial \npublishers.",
        "Obviously, copyright law is not the enemy. The enemy is regulation that does no \ngood. So the question that we should be asking just now is whether extending the \nregulations of copyright law into each of these domains actually does any good.",
        "I have no doubt that it does good in regulating commercial copying. But I also \nhave no doubt that it does more harm than good when regulating (as it regulates \njust now) noncommercial copying and, especially, noncommercial transformation. \nAnd increasingly, for the reasons sketched especially in chapters 7 and 8, one \nmight well wonder whether it does more harm than good for commercial \ntransformation. More commercial transformative work would be created if \nderivative rights were more sharply restricted.",
        "The issue is therefore not simply whether copyright is property. Of course \ncopyright is a kind of property, and of course, as with any property, the \nstate ought to protect it. But first impressions notwithstanding, historically, \nthis property right (as with all property rights [36]) has been crafted to \nbalance the important need to give authors and artists incentives with the \nequally important need to assure access to creative work. This balance has \nalways been struck in light of new technologies. And for almost half of our \ntradition, the copyright did not control at all the freedom of others to \nbuild upon or transform a creative work. American culture was born free, and for \nalmost 180 years our country consistently protected a vibrant and rich free \nculture.",
        "We achieved that free culture because our law respected important limits on the \nscope of the interests protected by property. The very birth of copyright as \na statutory right recognized those limits, by granting copyright owners \nprotection for a limited time only (the story of chapter 6). The tradition of \nfair use is animated by a similar concern that is increasingly under strain as \nthe costs of exercising any fair use right become unavoidably high (the story of \nchapter 7). Adding statutory rights where markets might stifle innovation is \nanother familiar limit on the property right that copyright is (chapter 8). And \ngranting archives and libraries a broad freedom to collect, claims of property \nnotwithstanding, is a crucial part of guaranteeing the soul of a culture \n(chapter 9). Free cultures, like free markets, are built with property. But the \nnature of the property that builds a free culture is very different from the \nextremist vision that dominates the debate today.",
        "Free culture is increasingly the casualty in this war on piracy. In response to \na real, if not yet quantified, threat that the technologies of the Internet \npresent to twentieth-century business models for producing and distributing \nculture, the law and technology are being transformed in a way that will \nundermine our tradition of free culture. The property right that is copyright is \nno longer the balanced right that it was, or was intended to be. The property \nright that is copyright has become unbalanced, tilted toward an extreme. The \nopportunity to create and transform becomes weakened in a world in which \ncreation requires permission and creativity must check with a lawyer.",
        "In a well-known short story by H. G. Wells, a mountain climber named Nunez trips \n(literally, down an ice slope) into an unknown and isolated valley in the \nPeruvian Andes. [1] The valley is extraordinarily beautiful, with sweet water, \npasture, an even climate, slopes of rich brown soil with tangles of a shrub that \nbore an excellent fruit. But the villagers are all blind. Nunez takes this as \nan opportunity. In the Country of the Blind, he tells himself, the One-Eyed \nMan is King. So he resolves to live with the villagers to explore life as a \nking.",
        "Things don’t go quite as he planned. He tries to explain the idea of sight to \nthe villagers. They don’t understand. He tells them they are blind. They don’t \nhave the word blind. They think he’s just thick. Indeed, as they increasingly \nnotice the things he can’t do (hear the sound of grass being stepped on, for \nexample), they increasingly try to control him. He, in turn, becomes \nincreasingly frustrated. You don’t understand,’ he cried, in a voice that was \nmeant to be great and resolute, and which broke. You are blind and I can see. \nLeave me alone!’",
        "The villagers don’t leave him alone. Nor do they see (so to speak) the virtue of \nhis special power. Not even the ultimate target of his affection, a young woman \nwho to him seems the most beautiful thing in the whole of creation, \nunderstands the beauty of sight. Nunez’s description of what he sees seemed to \nher the most poetical of fancies, and she listened to his description of the \nstars and the mountains and her own sweet white-lit beauty as though it was a \nguilty indulgence. She did not believe, Wells tells us, and she could only \nhalf understand, but she was mysteriously delighted.",
        "When Nunez announces his desire to marry his mysteriously delighted love, the \nfather and the village object. You see, my dear, her father instructs, he’s \nan idiot. He has delusions. He can’t do anything right. They take Nunez to the \nvillage doctor.",
        "After a careful examination, the doctor gives his opinion. His brain is \naffected, he reports.",
        "What affects it? the father asks.",
        "Those queer things that are called the eyes ... are diseased ... in such a way \nas to affect his brain.",
        "The doctor continues: I think I may say with reasonable certainty that in order \nto cure him completely, all that we need to do is a simple and easy surgical \noperationnamely, to remove these irritant bodies [the eyes].",
        "Thank Heaven for science! says the father to the doctor. They inform Nunez of \nthis condition necessary for him to be allowed his bride. (You’ll have to read \nthe original to learn what happens in the end. I believe in free culture, but \nnever in giving away the end of a story.)",
        "It sometimes happens that the eggs of twins fuse in the mother’s womb. That \nfusion produces a chimera. A chimera is a single creature with two sets of \nDNA. The DNA in the blood, for example, might be different from the DNA of the \nskin. This possibility is an underused plot for murder mysteries. But the DNA \nshows with 100 percent certainty that she was not the person whose blood was at \nthe scene. ...",
        "Before I had read about chimeras, I would have said they were impossible. A \nsingle person can’t have two sets of DNA. The very idea of DNA is that it is the \ncode of an individual. Yet in fact, not only can two individuals have the same \nset of DNA (identical twins), but one person can have two different sets of DNA \n(a chimera). Our understanding of a person should reflect this reality.",
        "The more I work to understand the current struggle over copyright and culture, \nwhich I’ve sometimes called unfairly, and sometimes not unfairly enough, the \ncopyright wars, the more I think we’re dealing with a chimera. For example, in \nthe battle over the question What is p2p file sharing? both sides have it \nright, and both sides have it wrong. One side says, File sharing is just like \ntwo kids taping each others’ recordsthe sort of thing we’ve been doing for the \nlast thirty years without any question at all. That’s true, at least in part. \nWhen I tell my best friend to try out a new CD that I’ve bought, but rather than \njust send the CD, I point him to my p2p server, that is, in all relevant \nrespects, just like what every executive in every recording company no doubt did \nas a kid: sharing music.",
        "But the description is also false in part. For when my p2p server is on a p2p \nnetwork through which anyone can get access to my music, then sure, my friends \ncan get access, but it stretches the meaning of friends beyond recognition to \nsay my ten thousand best friends can get access. Whether or not sharing my \nmusic with my best friend is what we have always been allowed to do, we have \nnot always been allowed to share music with our ten thousand best friends.",
        "Likewise, when the other side says, File sharing is just like walking into a \nTower Records and taking a CD off the shelf and walking out with it, that’s \ntrue, at least in part. If, after Lyle Lovett (finally) releases a new album, \nrather than buying it, I go to Kazaa and find a free copy to take, that is very \nmuch like stealing a copy from Tower.",
        "But it is not quite stealing from Tower. After all, when I take a CD from Tower \nRecords, Tower has one less CD to sell. And when I take a CD from Tower Records, \nI get a bit of plastic and a cover, and something to show on my shelves. (And, \nwhile we’re at it, we could also note that when I take a CD from Tower Records, \nthe maximum fine that might be imposed on me, under California law, at least, is \n$1,000. According to the RIAA, by contrast, if I download a ten-song CD, I’m \nliable for $1,500,000 in damages.)",
        "The point is not that it is as neither side describes. The point is that it is \nbothboth as the RIAA describes it and as Kazaa describes it. It is a chimera. \nAnd rather than simply denying what the other side asserts, we need to begin to \nthink about how we should respond to this chimera. What rules should govern it?",
        "We could respond by simply pretending that it is not a chimera. We could, with \nthe RIAA, decide that every act of file sharing should be a felony. We could \nprosecute families for millions of dollars in damages just because file sharing \noccurred on a family computer. And we can get universities to monitor all \ncomputer traffic to make sure that no computer is used to commit this crime. \nThese responses might be extreme, but each of them has either been proposed or \nactually implemented. [2]",
        "Alternatively, we could respond to file sharing the way many kids act as though \nwe’ve responded. We could totally legalize it. Let there be no copyright \nliability, either civil or criminal, for making copyrighted content available on \nthe Net. Make file sharing like gossip: regulated, if at all, by social norms \nbut not by law.",
        "Either response is possible. I think either would be a mistake. Rather than \nembrace one of these two extremes, we should embrace something that recognizes \nthe truth in both. And while I end this book with a sketch of a system that does \njust that, my aim in the next chapter is to show just how awful it would be for \nus to adopt the zero-tolerance extreme. I believe either extreme would be \nworse than a reasonable alternative. But I believe the zero-tolerance solution \nwould be the worse of the two extremes.",
        "Yet zero tolerance is increasingly our government’s policy. In the middle of the \nchaos that the Internet has created, an extraordinary land grab is occurring. \nThe law and technology are being shifted to give content holders a kind of \ncontrol over our culture that they have never had before. And in this extremism, \nmany an opportunity for new innovation and new creativity will be lost.",
        "I’m not talking about the opportunities for kids to steal music. My focus \ninstead is the commercial and cultural innovation that this war will also kill. \nWe have never seen the power to innovate spread so broadly among our citizens, \nand we have just begun to see the innovation that this power will unleash. Yet \nthe Internet has already seen the passing of one cycle of innovation around \ntechnologies to distribute content. The law is responsible for this passing. As \nthe vice president for global public policy at one of these new innovators, \neMusic.com, put it when criticizing the DMCA’s added protection for copyrighted \nmaterial,",
        "eMusic opposes music piracy. We are a distributor of copyrighted material, and \nwe want to protect those rights.",
        "But building a technology fortress that locks in the clout of the major labels \nis by no means the only way to protect copyright interests, nor is it \nnecessarily the best. It is simply too early to answer that question. Market \nforces operating naturally may very well produce a totally different industry \nmodel.",
        "This is a critical point. The choices that industry sectors make with respect \nto these systems will in many ways directly shape the market for digital media \nand the manner in which digital media are distributed. This in turn will \ndirectly influence the options that are available to consumers, both in terms of \nthe ease with which they will be able to access digital media and the equipment \nthat they will require to do so. Poor choices made this early in the game will \nretard the growth of this market, hurting everyone’s interests. [3]",

        "To fight piracy, to protect property, the content industry has launched a \nwar. Lobbying and lots of campaign contributions have now brought the government \ninto this war. As with any war, this one will have both direct and collateral \ndamage. As with any war of prohibition, these damages will be suffered most by \nour own people.",
        "My aim so far has been to describe the consequences of this war, in particular, \nthe consequences for free culture. But my aim now is to extend this \ndescription of consequences into an argument. Is this war justified?",
        "In my view, it is not. There is no good reason why this time, for the first \ntime, the law should defend the old against the new, just when the power of the \nproperty called intellectual property is at its greatest in our history.",
        "Yet common sense does not see it this way. Common sense is still on the side \nof the Causbys and the content industry. The extreme claims of control in the \nname of property still resonate; the uncritical rejection of piracy still has \nplay.",
        "There will be many consequences of continuing this war. I want to describe just \nthree. All three might be said to be unintended. I am quite confident the third \nis unintended. I’m less sure about the first two. The first two protect modern \nRCAs, but there is no Howard Armstrong in the wings to fight today’s monopolists \nof culture.",

        "In the next ten years we will see an explosion of digital technologies. These \ntechnologies will enable almost anyone to capture and share content. Capturing \nand sharing content, of course, is what humans have done since the dawn of man. \nIt is how we learn and communicate. But capturing and sharing through digital \ntechnology is different. The fidelity and power are different. You could send an \ne-mail telling someone about a joke you saw on Comedy Central, or you could send \nthe clip. You could write an essay about the inconsistencies in the arguments of \nthe politician you most love to hate, or you could make a short film that puts \nstatement against statement. You could write a poem to express your love, or you \ncould weave together a stringa mash-upof songs from your favorite artists in a \ncollage and make it available on the Net.",
        "This digital capturing and sharing is in part an extension of the capturing \nand sharing that has always been integral to our culture, and in part it is \nsomething new. It is continuous with the Kodak, but it explodes the boundaries \nof Kodak-like technologies. The technology of digital capturing and sharing \npromises a world of extraordinarily diverse creativity that can be easily and \nbroadly shared. And as that creativity is applied to democracy, it will enable a \nbroad range of citizens to use technology to express and criticize and \ncontribute to the culture all around.",
        "Technology has thus given us an opportunity to do something with culture that \nhas only ever been possible for individuals in small groups, isolated from \nothers. Think about an old man telling a story to a collection of neighbors in a \nsmall town. Now imagine that same storytelling extended across the globe.",
        "Yet all this is possible only if the activity is presumptively legal. In the \ncurrent regime of legal regulation, it is not. Forget file sharing for a moment. \nThink about your favorite amazing sites on the Net. Web sites that offer plot \nsummaries from forgotten television shows; sites that catalog cartoons from the \n1960s; sites that mix images and sound to criticize politicians or businesses; \nsites that gather newspaper articles on remote topics of science or culture. \nThere is a vast amount of creative work spread across the Internet. But as the \nlaw is currently crafted, this work is presumptively illegal.",
        "That presumption will increasingly chill creativity, as the examples of extreme \npenalties for vague infringements continue to proliferate. It is impossible to \nget a clear sense of what’s allowed and what’s not, and at the same time, the \npenalties for crossing the line are astonishingly harsh. The four students who \nwere threatened by the RIAA ( Jesse Jordan of chapter 3 was just one) were \nthreatened with a $98 billion lawsuit for building search engines that permitted \nsongs to be copied. Yet WorldComwhich defrauded investors of $11 billion, \nresulting in a loss to investors in market capitalization of over $200 billion\nreceived a fine of a mere $750 million. [1] And under legislation being pushed \nin Congress right now, a doctor who negligently removes the wrong leg in an \noperation would be liable for no more than $250,000 in damages for pain and \nsuffering. [2] Can common sense recognize the absurdity in a world where the \nmaximum fine for downloading two songs off the Internet is more than the fine \nfor a doctor’s negligently butchering a patient?",
        "The consequence of this legal uncertainty, tied to these extremely high \npenalties, is that an extraordinary amount of creativity will either never be \nexercised, or never be exercised in the open. We drive this creative process \nunderground by branding the modern-day Walt Disneys pirates. We make it \nimpossible for businesses to rely upon a public domain, because the boundaries \nof the public domain are designed to be unclear. It never pays to do anything \nexcept pay for the right to create, and hence only those who can pay are allowed \nto create. As was the case in the Soviet Union, though for very different \nreasons, we will begin to see a world of underground artnot because the message \nis necessarily political, or because the subject is controversial, but because \nthe very act of creating the art is legally fraught. Already, exhibits of \nillegal art tour the United States. [3] In what does their illegality \nconsist? In the act of mixing the culture around us with an expression that is \ncritical or reflective.",
        "Part of the reason for this fear of illegality has to do with the changing law. \nI described that change in detail in chapter 10. But an even bigger part has to \ndo with the increasing ease with which infractions can be tracked. As users of \nfile-sharing systems discovered in 2002, it is a trivial matter for copyright \nowners to get courts to order Internet service providers to reveal who has what \ncontent. It is as if your cassette tape player transmitted a list of the songs \nthat you played in the privacy of your own home that anyone could tune into for \nwhatever reason they chose.",
        "Never in our history has a painter had to worry about whether his painting \ninfringed on someone else’s work; but the modern-day painter, using the tools of \nPhotoshop, sharing content on the Web, must worry all the time. Images are all \naround, but the only safe images to use in the act of creation are those \npurchased from Corbis or another image farm. And in purchasing, censoring \nhappens. There is a free market in pencils; we needn’t worry about its effect on \ncreativity. But there is a highly regulated, monopolized market in cultural \nicons; the right to cultivate and transform them is not similarly free.",
        "Lawyers rarely see this because lawyers are rarely empirical. As I described in \nchapter 7, in response to the story about documentary filmmaker Jon Else, I have \nbeen lectured again and again by lawyers who insist Else’s use was fair use, and \nhence I am wrong to say that the law regulates such a use.",
        "But fair use in America simply means the right to hire a lawyer to defend your \nright to create. And as lawyers love to forget, our system for defending rights \nsuch as fair use is astonishingly badin practically every context, but \nespecially here. It costs too much, it delivers too slowly, and what it delivers \noften has little connection to the justice underlying the claim. The legal \nsystem may be tolerable for the very rich. For everyone else, it is an \nembarrassment to a tradition that prides itself on the rule of law.",
        "Judges and lawyers can tell themselves that fair use provides adequate \nbreathing room between regulation by the law and the access the law should \nallow. But it is a measure of how out of touch our legal system has become that \nanyone actually believes this. The rules that publishers impose upon writers, \nthe rules that film distributors impose upon filmmakers, the rules that \nnewspapers impose upon journaliststhese are the real laws governing creativity. \nAnd these rules have little relationship to the law with which judges comfort \nthemselves.",
        "For in a world that threatens $150,000 for a single willful infringement of a \ncopyright, and which demands tens of thousands of dollars to even defend against \na copyright infringement claim, and which would never return to the wrongfully \naccused defendant anything of the costs she suffered to defend her right to \nspeakin that world, the astonishingly broad regulations that pass under the \nname copyright silence speech and creativity. And in that world, it takes a \nstudied blindness for people to continue to believe they live in a culture that \nis free.",
        "As Jed Horovitz, the businessman behind Video Pipeline, said to me,",
        "We’re losing [creative] opportunities right and left. Creative people are being \nforced not to express themselves. Thoughts are not being expressed. And while a \nlot of stuff may [still] be created, it still won’t get distributed. Even if the \nstuff gets made ... you’re not going to get it distributed in the mainstream \nmedia unless you’ve got a little note from a lawyer saying, This has been \ncleared. You’re not even going to get it on PBS without that kind of \npermission. That’s the point at which they control it.",

And if you think that, you \nmight think there’s little in this story to worry you.",
        "But there’s an aspect of this story that is not lefty in any sense. Indeed, it \nis an aspect that could be written by the most extreme pro-market ideologue. And \nif you’re one of these sorts (and a special one at that, 188 pages into a book \nlike this), then you can see this other aspect by substituting free market \nevery place I’ve spoken of free culture. The point is the same, even if the \ninterests affecting culture are more fundamental.",
        "The charge I’ve been making about the regulation of culture is the same charge \nfree marketers make about regulating markets. Everyone, of course, concedes that \nsome regulation of markets is necessaryat a minimum, we need rules of property \nand contract, and courts to enforce both. Likewise, in this culture debate, \neveryone concedes that at least some framework of copyright is also required. \nBut both perspectives vehemently insist that just because some regulation is \ngood, it doesn’t follow that more regulation is better. And both perspectives \nare constantly attuned to the ways in which regulation simply enables the \npowerful industries of today to protect themselves against the competitors of \ntomorrow.",
        "This is the single most dramatic effect of the shift in regulatory strategy that \nI described in chapter 10. The consequence of this massive threat of liability \ntied to the murky boundaries of copyright law is that innovators who want to \ninnovate in this space can safely innovate only if they have the sign-off from \nlast generation’s dominant industries. That lesson has been taught through a \nseries of cases that were designed and executed to teach venture capitalists a \nlesson. That lessonwhat former Napster CEO Hank Barry calls a nuclear pall \nthat has fallen over the Valleyhas been learned.",
        "Consider one example to make the point, a story whose beginning I told in The \nFuture of Ideas and which has progressed in a way that even I (pessimist \nextraordinaire) would never have predicted.",
        "In 1997, Michael Roberts launched a company called MP3.com. MP3.com was keen to \nremake the music business. Their goal was not just to facilitate new ways to get \naccess to content. Their goal was also to facilitate new ways to create content. \nUnlike the major labels, MP3.com offered creators a venue to distribute their \ncreativity, without demanding an exclusive engagement from the creators.",
        "To make this system work, however, MP3.com needed a reliable way to recommend \nmusic to its users. The idea behind this alternative was to leverage the \nrevealed preferences of music listeners to recommend new artists. If you like \nLyle Lovett, you’re likely to enjoy Bonnie Raitt. And so on.",
        "This idea required a simple way to gather data about user preferences. MP3.com \ncame up with an extraordinarily clever way to gather this preference data. In \nJanuary 2000, the company launched a service called my.mp3.com. Using software \nprovided by MP3.com, a user would sign into an account and then insert into her \ncomputer a CD. The software would identify the CD, and then give the user access \nto that content. So, for example, if you inserted a CD by Jill Sobule, then \nwherever you wereat work or at homeyou could get access to that music once you \nsigned into your account. The system was therefore a kind of music-lockbox.",
        "No doubt some could use this system to illegally copy content. But that \nopportunity existed with or without MP3.com. The aim of the my.mp3.com service \nwas to give users access to their own content, and as a by-product, by seeing \nthe content they already owned, to discover the kind of content the users liked.",
        "To make this system function, however, MP3.com needed to copy 50,000 CDs to a \nserver. (In principle, it could have been the user who uploaded the music, but \nthat would have taken a great deal of time, and would have produced a product of \nquestionable quality.) It therefore purchased 50,000 CDs from a store, and \nstarted the process of making copies of those CDs. Again, it would not serve the \ncontent from those copies to anyone except those who authenticated that they had \na copy of the CD they wanted to access. So while this was 50,000 copies, it was \n50,000 copies directed at giving customers something they had already bought.",
        "Nine days after MP3.com launched its service, the five major labels, headed by \nthe RIAA, brought a lawsuit against MP3.com. MP3.com settled with four of the \nfive. Nine months later, a federal judge found MP3.com to have been guilty of \nwillful infringement with respect to the fifth. Applying the law as it is, the \njudge imposed a fine against MP3.com of $118 million. MP3.com then settled with \nthe remaining plaintiff, Vivendi Universal, paying over $54 million. Vivendi \npurchased MP3.com just about a year later.",
        "That part of the story I have told before. Now consider its conclusion.",
        "After Vivendi purchased MP3.com, Vivendi turned around and filed a malpractice \nlawsuit against the lawyers who had advised it that they had a good faith claim \nthat the service they wanted to offer would be considered legal under copyright \nlaw. This lawsuit alleged that it should have been obvious that the courts would \nfind this behavior illegal; therefore, this lawsuit sought to punish any lawyer \nwho had dared to suggest that the law was less restrictive than the labels \ndemanded.",
        "The clear purpose of this lawsuit (which was settled for an unspecified amount \nshortly after the story was no longer covered in the press) was to send an \nunequivocal message to lawyers advising clients in this space: It is not just \nyour clients who might suffer if the content industry directs its guns against \nthem. It is also you. So those of you who believe the law should be less \nrestrictive should realize that such a view of the law will cost you and your \nfirm dearly.",
        "This strategy is not just limited to the lawyers. In April 2003, Universal and \nEMI brought a lawsuit against Hummer Winblad, the venture capital firm (VC) that \nhad funded Napster at a certain stage of its development, its cofounder (John \nHummer), and general partner (Hank Barry). [4] The claim here, as well, was that \nthe VC should have recognized the right of the content industry to control how \nthe industry should develop. They should be held personally liable for funding a \ncompany whose business turned out to be beyond the law. Here again, the aim of \nthe lawsuit is transparent: Any VC now recognizes that if you fund a company \nwhose business is not approved of by the dinosaurs, you are at risk not just in \nthe marketplace, but in the courtroom as well. Your investment buys you not only \na company, it also buys you a lawsuit. So extreme has the environment become \nthat even car manufacturers are afraid of technologies that touch content. In an \narticle in Business 2.0, Rafe Needleman describes a discussion with BMW:",
        "I asked why, with all the storage capacity and computer power in the car, there \nwas no way to play MP3 files. I was told that BMW engineers in Germany had \nrigged a new vehicle to play MP3s via the car’s built-in sound system, but that \nthe company’s marketing and legal departments weren’t comfortable with pushing \nthis forward for release stateside. Even today, no new cars are sold in the \nUnited States with bona fide MP3 players. ... [5]",
        "This is the world of the mafiafilled with your money or your life” offers, \ngoverned in the end not by courts but by the threats that the law empowers \ncopyright holders to exercise. It is a system that will obviously and \nnecessarily stifle new innovation. It is hard enough to start a company. It is \nimpossibly hard if that company is constantly threatened by litigation.",
        "The point is not that businesses should have a right to start illegal \nenterprises. The point is the definition of illegal. The law is a mess of \nuncertainty. We have no good way to know how it should apply to new \ntechnologies. Yet by reversing our tradition of judicial deference, and by \nembracing the astonishingly high penalties that copyright law imposes, that \nuncertainty now yields a reality which is far more conservative than is right. \nIf the law imposed the death penalty for parking tickets, we’d not only have \nfewer parking tickets, we’d also have much less driving. The same principle \napplies to innovation. If innovation is constantly checked by this uncertain and \nunlimited liability, we will have much less vibrant innovation and much less \ncreativity.",
        "The point is directly parallel to the crunchy-lefty point about fair use. \nWhatever the real law is, realism about the effect of law in both contexts is \nthe same. This wildly punitive system of regulation will systematically stifle \ncreativity and innovation. It will protect some industries and some creators, \nbut it will harm industry and creativity generally. Free market and free culture \ndepend upon vibrant competition. Yet the effect of the law today is to stifle \njust this kind of competition. The effect is to produce an overregulated \nculture, just as the effect of too much control in the market is to produce an \noverregulated- regulated market.",
        "The building of a permission culture, rather than a free culture, is the first \nimportant way in which the changes I have described will burden innovation. A \npermission culture means a lawyer’s culturea culture in which the ability to \ncreate requires a call to your lawyer. Again, I am not antilawyer, at least when \nthey’re kept in their proper place. I am certainly not antilaw. But our \nprofession has lost the sense of its limits. And leaders in our profession have \nlost an appreciation of the high costs that our profession imposes upon others. \nThe inefficiency of the law is an embarrassment to our tradition. And while I \nbelieve our profession should therefore do everything it can to make the law \nmore efficient, it should at least do everything it can to limit the reach of \nthe law where the law is not doing any good. The transaction costs buried within \na permission culture are enough to bury a wide range of creativity. Someone \nneeds to do a lot of justifying to justify that result.",
        "The uncertainty of the law is one burden on innovation. There is a second burden \nthat operates more directly. This is the effort by many in the content industry \nto use the law to directly regulate the technology of the Internet so that it \nbetter protects their content.",
        "The motivation for this response is obvious. The Internet enables the efficient \nspread of content. That efficiency is a feature of the Inter-net’s design. But \nfrom the perspective of the content industry, this feature is a bug. The \nefficient spread of content means that content distributors have a harder time \ncontrolling the distribution of content. One obvious response to this efficiency \nis thus to make the Internet less efficient. If the Internet enables piracy, \nthen, this response says, we should break the kneecaps of the Internet.",
        "The examples of this form of legislation are many. At the urging of the content \nindustry, some in Congress have threatened legislation that would require \ncomputers to determine whether the content they access is protected or not, and \nto disable the spread of protected content. [6] Congress has already launched \nproceedings to explore a mandatory broad- cast flag that would be required on \nany device capable of transmitting digital video (i.e., a computer), and that \nwould disable the copying of any content that is marked with a broadcast flag. \nOther members of Congress have proposed immunizing content providers from \nliability for technology they might deploy that would hunt down copyright \nviolators and disable their machines. [7]",
        "In one sense, these solutions seem sensible. If the problem is the code, why not \nregulate the code to remove the problem. But any regulation of technical \ninfrastructure will always be tuned to the particular technology of the day. It \nwill impose significant burdens and costs on the technology, but will likely be \neclipsed by advances around exactly those requirements.",
        "In March 2002, a broad coalition of technology companies, led by Intel, tried to \nget Congress to see the harm that such legislation would impose. [8] Their \nargument was obviously not that copyright should not be protected. Instead, they \nargued, any protection should not do more harm than good.",
        "There is one more obvious way in which this war has harmed innovationagain, a \nstory that will be quite familiar to the free market crowd. ",
        "Copyright may be property, but like all property, it is also a form of \nregulation. It is a regulation that benefits some and harms others. When done \nright, it benefits creators and harms leeches. When done wrong, it is regulation \nthe powerful use to defeat competitors.",
        "As I described in chapter 10, despite this feature of copyright as regulation, \nand subject to important qualifications outlined by Jessica Litman in her book \n/Digital Copyright, [9] overall this history of copyright is not bad. As \nchapter 10 details, when new technologies have come along, Congress has struck a \nbalance to assure that the new is protected from the old. Compulsory, or \nstatutory, licenses have been one part of that strategy. Free use (as in the \ncase of the VCR) has been another.",
        "But that pattern of deference to new technologies has now changed with the rise \nof the Internet. Rather than striking a balance between the claims of a new \ntechnology and the legitimate rights of content creators, both the courts and \nCongress have imposed legal restrictions that will have the effect of smothering \nthe new to benefit the old.",
        "The response by the courts has been fairly universal. [10] It has been mirrored \nin the responses threatened and actually implemented by Congress. I won’t \ncatalog all of those responses here. [11] But there is one example that captures \nthe flavor of them all. This is the story of the demise of Internet radio.",
        "As I described in chapter 4, when a radio station plays a song, the recording \nartist doesn’t get paid for that radio performance unless he or she is also \nthe composer. So, for example if Marilyn Monroe had recorded a version of Happy \nBirthdayto memorialize her famous performance before President Kennedy at \nMadison Square Gardenthen whenever that recording was played on the radio, the \ncurrent copyright owners of Happy Birthday would get some money, whereas \nMarilyn Monroe would not.",
        "The reasoning behind this balance struck by Congress makes some sense. The \njustification was that radio was a kind of advertising. The recording artist \nthus benefited because by playing her music, the radio station was making it \nmore likely that her records would be purchased. Thus, the recording artist got \nsomething, even if only indirectly. Probably this reasoning had less to do with \nthe result than with the power of radio stations: Their lobbyists were quite \ngood at stopping any efforts to get Congress to require compensation to the \nrecording artists.",
        "Enter Internet radio. Like regular radio, Internet radio is a technology to \nstream content from a broadcaster to a listener. The broadcast travels across \nthe Internet, not across the ether of radio spectrum. Thus, I can tune in to \nan Internet radio station in Berlin while sitting in San Francisco, even though \nthere’s no way for me to tune in to a regular radio station much beyond the San \nFrancisco metropolitan area.",
        "This feature of the architecture of Internet radio means that there are \npotentially an unlimited number of radio stations that a user could tune in to \nusing her computer, whereas under the existing architecture for broadcast radio, \nthere is an obvious limit to the number of broadcasters and clear broadcast \nfrequencies. Internet radio could therefore be more competitive than regular \nradio; it could provide a wider range of selections. And because the potential \naudience for Internet radio is the whole world, niche stations could easily \ndevelop and market their content to a relatively large number of users \nworldwide. According to some estimates, more than eighty million users worldwide \nhave tuned in to this new form of radio.",
        "Internet radio is thus to radio what FM was to AM. It is an improvement \npotentially vastly more significant than the FM improvement over AM, since not \nonly is the technology better, so, too, is the competition. Indeed, there is a \ndirect parallel between the fight to establish FM radio and the fight to protect \nInternet radio. As one author describes Howard Armstrong’s struggle to enable FM \nradio,",
        "An almost unlimited number of FM stations was possible in the shortwaves, thus \nending the unnatural restrictions imposed on radio in the crowded longwaves. If \nFM were freely developed, the number of stations would be limited only by \neconomics and competition rather than by technical restrictions. ... Armstrong \nlikened the situation that had grown up in radio to that following the invention \nof the printing press, when governments and ruling interests attempted to \ncontrol this new instrument of mass communications by imposing restrictive \nlicenses on it. This tyranny was broken only when it became possible for men \nfreely to acquire printing presses and freely to run them. FM in this sense was \nas great an invention as the printing presses, for it gave radio the opportunity \nto strike off its shackles. [12]",
        "This potential for FM radio was never realizednot because Armstrong was wrong \nabout the technology, but because he underestimated the power of vested \ninterests, habits, customs and legislation [13] to retard the growth of this \ncompeting technology.",
        "Now the very same claim could be made about Internet radio. For again, there is \nno technical limitation that could restrict the number of Internet radio \nstations. The only restrictions on Internet radio are those imposed by the law. \nCopyright law is one such law. So the first question we should ask is, what \ncopyright rules would govern Internet radio?",
        "But here the power of the lobbyists is reversed. Internet radio is a new \nindustry. The recording artists, on the other hand, have a very powerful lobby, \nthe RIAA. Thus when Congress considered the phenomenon of Internet radio in \n1995, the lobbyists had primed Congress to adopt a different rule for Internet \nradio than the rule that applies to terrestrial radio. While terrestrial radio \ndoes not have to pay our hypothetical Marilyn Monroe when it plays her \nhypothetical recording of Happy Birthday on the air, Internet radio does. \nNot only is the law not neutral toward Internet radiothe law actually burdens \nInternet radio more than it burdens terrestrial radio.",
        "This financial burden is not slight. As Harvard law professor William Fisher \nestimates, if an Internet radio station distributed ad- free popular music to \n(on average) ten thousand listeners, twenty-four hours a day, the total artist \nfees that radio station would owe would be over $1 million a year. [14] A \nregular radio station broadcasting the same content would pay no equivalent fee.",
        "The burden is not financial only. Under the original rules that were proposed, \nan Internet radio station (but not a terrestrial radio station) would have to \ncollect the following data from every listening transaction:",
        "1. name of the service;\n2. channel of the program (AM/FM stations use station ID);\n3. type of program (archived/looped/live);\n4. date of transmission;\n5. time of transmission;\n6. time zone of origination of transmission;\n7. numeric designation of the place of the sound recording within the program;\n8. duration of transmission (to nearest second);\n9. sound recording title;\n10. ISRC code of the recording;\n11. release year of the album per copyright notice and in the case of \ncompilation albums, the release year of the album and copyright date of the \ntrack;\n12. featured recording artist;\n13. retail album title;\n14. recording label;\n15. UPC code of the retail album;\n16. catalog number;\n17. copyright owner information;\n18. musical genre of the channel or program (station format);\n19. name of the service or entity;\n20. channel or program;\n21. date and time that the user logged in (in the user’s time zone);\n22. date and time that the user logged out (in the user’s time zone);\n23. time zone where the signal was received (user);\n24. Unique User identifier;\n25. the country in which the user received the transmissions.",
        "The Librarian of Congress eventually suspended these reporting requirements, \npending further study. And he also changed the original rates set by the \narbitration panel charged with setting rates. But the basic difference between \nInternet radio and terrestrial radio remains: Internet radio has to pay a type \nof copyright fee that terrestrial radio does not.",
        "Why? What justifies this difference? Was there any study of the economic \nconsequences from Internet radio that would justify these differences? Was the \nmotive to protect artists against piracy?",
        "In a rare bit of candor, one RIAA expert admitted what seemed obvious to \neveryone at the time. As Alex Alben, vice president for Public Policy at Real \nNetworks, told me,",
        "The RIAA, which was representing the record labels, presented some testimony \nabout what they thought a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller, and it \nwas much higher. It was ten times higher than what radio stations pay to perform \nthe same songs for the same period of time. And so the attorneys representing \nthe webcasters asked the RIAA, ... How do you come up with a rate that’s so \nmuch higher? Why is it worth more than radio? Because here we have hundreds of \nthousands of webcasters who want to pay, and that should establish the market \nrate, and if you set the rate so high, you’re going to drive the small \nwebcasters out of business. ...",
        "And the RIAA experts said, Well, we don’t really model this as an industry with \nthousands of webcasters, we think it should be an industry with, you know, five \nor seven big players who can pay a high rate and it’s a stable, predictable \nmarket. (Emphasis added.)",
        "Translation: The aim is to use the law to eliminate competition, so that this \nplatform of potentially immense competition, which would cause the diversity and \nrange of content available to explode, would not cause pain to the dinosaurs of \nold. There is no one, on either the right or the left, who should endorse this \nuse of the law. And yet there is practically no one, on either the right or the \nleft, who is doing anything effective to prevent it.",
        "Overregulation stifles creativity. It smothers innovation. It gives dinosaurs a \nveto over the future. It wastes the extraordinary opportunity for a democratic \ncreativity that digital technology enables.",
        "In addition to these important harms, there is one more that was important to \nour forebears, but seems forgotten today. Overregulation corrupts citizens and \nweakens the rule of law.",
        "The war that is being waged today is a war of prohibition. As with every war of \nprohibition, it is targeted against the behavior of a very large number of \ncitizens. According to The New York Times, 43 million Americans downloaded \nmusic in May 2002. [15] According to the RIAA, the behavior of those 43 million \nAmericans is a felony. We thus have a set of rules that transform 20 percent of \nAmerica into criminals. As the RIAA launches lawsuits against not only the \nNapsters and Kazaas of the world, but against students building search engines, \nand increasingly against ordinary users downloading content, the technologies \nfor sharing will advance to further protect and hide illegal use. It is an arms \nrace or a civil war, with the extremes of one side inviting a more extreme \nresponse by the other.",
        "The content industry’s tactics exploit the failings of the American legal \nsystem. When the RIAA brought suit against Jesse Jordan, it knew that in Jordan \nit had found a scapegoat, not a defendant. The threat of having to pay either \nall the money in the world in damages ($15,000,000) or almost all the money in \nthe world to defend against paying all the money in the world in damages \n($250,000 in legal fees) led Jordan to choose to pay all the money he had in the \nworld ($12,000) to make the suit go away. The same strategy animates the RIAA’s \nsuits against individual users. In September 2003, the RIAA sued 261 \nindividualsincluding a twelve-year-old girl living in public housing and a \nseventy-year-old man who had no idea what file sharing was. [16] As these \nscapegoats discovered, it will always cost more to defend against these suits \nthan it would cost to simply settle. (The twelve year old, for example, like \nJesse Jordan, paid her life savings of $2,000 to settle the case.) Our law is an \nawful system for defending rights. It is an embarrassment to our tradition. And \nthe consequence of our law as it is, is that those with the power can use the \nlaw to quash any rights they oppose.",
        "Wars of prohibition are nothing new in America. This one is just something more \nextreme than anything we’ve seen before. We experimented with alcohol \nprohibition, at a time when the per capita consumption of alcohol was 1.5 \ngallons per capita per year. The war against drinking initially reduced that \nconsumption to just 30 percent of its preprohibition levels, but by the end of \nprohibition, consumption was up to 70 percent of the preprohibition level. \nAmericans were drinking just about as much, but now, a vast number were \ncriminals. [17] We have launched a war on drugs aimed at reducing the \nconsumption of regulated narcotics that 7 percent (or 16 million) Americans now \nuse. [18] That is a drop from the high (so to speak) in 1979 of 14 percent of \nthe population. We regulate automobiles to the point where the vast majority of \nAmericans violate the law every day. We run such a complex tax system that a \nmajority of cash businesses regularly cheat. [19] We pride ourselves on our \nfree society, but an endless array of ordinary behavior is regulated within \nour society. And as a result, a huge proportion of Americans regularly violate \nat least some law.",
        "This state of affairs is not without consequence. It is a particularly salient \nissue for teachers like me, whose job it is to teach law students about the \nimportance of ethics. As my colleague Charlie Nesson told a class at Stanford, \neach year law schools admit thousands of students who have illegally downloaded \nmusic, illegally consumed alcohol and sometimes drugs, illegally worked without \npaying taxes, illegally driven cars. These are kids for whom behaving illegally \nis increasingly the norm. And then we, as law professors, are supposed to teach \nthem how to behave ethicallyhow to say no to bribes, or keep client funds \nseparate, or honor a demand to disclose a document that will mean that your case \nis over. Generations of Americansmore significantly in some parts of America \nthan in others, but still, everywhere in America todaycan’t live their lives \nboth normally and legally, since normally entails a certain degree of \nillegality.",
        "The response to this general illegality is either to enforce the law more \nseverely or to change the law. We, as a society, have to learn how to make that \nchoice more rationally. Whether a law makes sense depends, in part, at least, \nupon whether the costs of the law, both intended and collateral, outweigh the \nbenefits. If the costs, intended and collateral, do outweigh the benefits, then \nthe law ought to be changed. Alternatively, if the costs of the existing system \nare much greater than the costs of an alternative, then we have a good reason to \nconsider the alternative.",
        "My point is not the idiotic one: Just because people violate a law, we should \ntherefore repeal it. Obviously, we could reduce murder statistics dramatically \nby legalizing murder on Wednesdays and Fridays. But that wouldn’t make any \nsense, since murder is wrong every day of the week. A society is right to ban \nmurder always and everywhere.",
        "My point is instead one that democracies understood for generations, but that we \nrecently have learned to forget. The rule of law depends upon people obeying the \nlaw. The more often, and more repeatedly, we as citizens experience violating \nthe law, the less we respect the law. Obviously, in most cases, the important \nissue is the law, not respect for the law. I don’t care whether the rapist \nrespects the law or not; I want to catch and incarcerate the rapist. But I do \ncare whether my students respect the law. And I do care if the rules of law sow \nincreasing disrespect because of the extreme of regulation they impose. Twenty \nmillion Americans have come of age since the Internet introduced this different \nidea of sharing. We need to be able to call these twenty million Americans \ncitizens, not felons.",
        "When at least forty-three million citizens download content from the Internet, \nand when they use tools to combine that content in ways unauthorized by \ncopyright holders, the first question we should be asking is not how best to \ninvolve the FBI. The first question should be whether this particular \nprohibition is really necessary in order to achieve the proper ends that \ncopyright law serves. Is there another way to assure that artists get paid \nwithout transforming forty-three million Americans into felons? Does it make \nsense if there are other ways to assure that artists get paid without \ntransforming America into a nation of felons?",
        "This abstract point can be made more clear with a particular example.",
        "We all own CDs. Many of us still own phonograph records. These pieces of plastic \nencode music that in a certain sense we have bought. The law protects our right \nto buy and sell that plastic: It is not a copyright infringement for me to sell \nall my classical records at a used record store and buy jazz records to replace \nthem. That use of the recordings is free.",
        "But as the MP3 craze has demonstrated, there is another use of phonograph \nrecords that is effectively free. Because these recordings were made without \ncopy-protection technologies, I am free to copy, or rip, music from my \nrecords onto a computer hard disk. Indeed, Apple Corporation went so far as to \nsuggest that freedom was a right: In a series of commercials, Apple endorsed \nthe Rip, Mix, Burn capacities of digital technologies.",
        "This use of my records is certainly valuable. I have begun a large process at \nhome of ripping all of my and my wife’s CDs, and storing them in one archive. \nThen, using Apple’s iTunes, or a wonderful program called Andromeda, we can \nbuild different play lists of our music: Bach, Baroque, Love Songs, Love Songs \nof Significant Othersthe potential is endless. And by reducing the costs of \nmixing play lists, these technologies help build a creativity with play lists \nthat is itself independently valuable. Compilations of songs are creative and \nmeaningful in their own right.",
        "This use is enabled by unprotected mediaeither CDs or records. But unprotected \nmedia also enable file sharing. File sharing threatens (or so the content \nindustry believes) the ability of creators to earn a fair return from their \ncreativity. And thus, many are beginning to experiment with technologies to \neliminate unprotected media. These technologies, for example, would enable CDs \nthat could not be ripped. Or they might enable spy programs to identify ripped \ncontent on people’s machines.",
        "If these technologies took off, then the building of large archives of your own \nmusic would become quite difficult. You might hang in hacker circles, and get \ntechnology to disable the technologies that protect the content. Trading in \nthose technologies is illegal, but maybe that doesn’t bother you much. In any \ncase, for the vast majority of people, these protection technologies would \neffectively destroy the archiving use of CDs. The technology, in other words, \nwould force us all back to the world where we either listened to music by \nmanipulating pieces of plastic or were part of a massively complex digital \nrights management system.",
        "If the only way to assure that artists get paid were the elimination of the \nability to freely move content, then these technologies to interfere with the \nfreedom to move content would be justifiable. But what if there were another way \nto assure that artists are paid, without locking down any content? What if, in \nother words, a different system could assure compensation to artists while also \npreserving the freedom to move content easily?",
        "My point just now is not to prove that there is such a system. I offer a version \nof such a system in the last chapter of this book. For now, the only point is \nthe relatively uncontroversial one: If a different system achieved the same \nlegitimate objectives that the existing copyright system achieved, but left \nconsumers and creators much more free, then we’d have a very good reason to \npursue this alternativenamely, freedom. The choice, in other words, would not \nbe between property and piracy; the choice would be between different property \nsystems and the freedoms each allowed.",
        "I believe there is a way to assure that artists are paid without turning forty-\nthree million Americans into felons. But the salient feature of this alternative \nis that it would lead to a very different market for producing and distributing \ncreativity. The dominant few, who today control the vast majority of the \ndistribution of content in the world, would no longer exercise this extreme of \ncontrol. Rather, they would go the way of the horse-drawn buggy.",
        "Except that this generation’s buggy manufacturers have already saddled Congress, \nand are riding the law to protect themselves against this new form of \ncompetition. For them the choice is between forty-three million Americans as \ncriminals and their own survival.",
        "It is understandable why they choose as they do. It is not understandable why we \nas a democracy continue to choose as we do. Jack Valenti is charming; but not so \ncharming as to justify giving up a tradition as deep and important as our \ntradition of free culture.",
        "There’s one more aspect to this corruption that is particularly important to \ncivil liberties, and follows directly from any war of prohibition. As Electronic \nFrontier Foundation attorney Fred von Lohmann describes, this is the collateral \ndamage that arises whenever you turn a very large percentage of the population \ninto criminals. This is the collateral damage to civil liberties generally.",
        "If you can treat someone as a putative lawbreaker, von Lohmann explains,",
        "then all of a sudden a lot of basic civil liberty protections evaporate to one \ndegree or another. ... If you’re a copyright infringer, how can you hope to have \nany privacy rights? If you’re a copyright infringer, how can you hope to be \nsecure against seizures of your computer? How can you hope to continue to \nreceive Internet access? ... Our sensibilities change as soon as we think, Oh, \nwell, but that person’s a criminal, a lawbreaker. Well, what this campaign \nagainst file sharing has done is turn a remarkable percentage of the American \nInternet-using population into law-breakers. ",
        "And the consequence of this transformation of the American public into criminals \nis that it becomes trivial, as a matter of due process, to effectively erase \nmuch of the privacy most would presume.",
        "Users of the Internet began to see this generally in 2003 as the RIAA launched \nits campaign to force Internet service providers to turn over the names of \ncustomers who the RIAA believed were violating copyright law. Verizon fought \nthat demand and lost. With a simple request to a judge, and without any notice \nto the customer at all, the identity of an Internet user is revealed.",
        "The RIAA then expanded this campaign, by announcing a general strategy to sue \nindividual users of the Internet who are alleged to have downloaded copyrighted \nmusic from file-sharing systems. But as we’ve seen, the potential damages from \nthese suits are astronomical: If a family’s computer is used to download a \nsingle CD’s worth of music, the family could be liable for $2 million in \ndamages. That didn’t stop the RIAA from suing a number of these families, just \nas they had sued Jesse Jordan. [20]",
        "Even this understates the espionage that is being waged by the RIAA. A report \nfrom CNN late last summer described a strategy the RIAA had adopted to track \nNapster users. [21] Using a sophisticated hashing algorithm, the RIAA took what \nis in effect a fingerprint of every song in the Napster catalog. Any copy of one \nof those MP3s will have the same fingerprint.",
        "So imagine the following not-implausible scenario: Imagine a friend gives a CD \nto your daughtera collection of songs just like the cassettes you used to make \nas a kid. You don’t know, and neither does your daughter, where these songs came \nfrom. But she copies these songs onto her computer. She then takes her computer \nto college and connects it to a college network, and if the college network is \ncooperating” with the RIAA’s espionage, and she hasn’t properly protected her \ncontent from the network (do you know how to do that yourself ?), then the RIAA \nwill be able to identify your daughter as a criminal. And under the rules that \nuniversities are beginning to deploy, [22] your daughter can lose the right to \nuse the university’s computer network. She can, in some cases, be expelled.",
        "Now, of course, she’ll have the right to defend herself. You can hire a lawyer \nfor her (at $300 per hour, if you’re lucky), and she can plead that she didn’t \nknow anything about the source of the songs or that they came from Napster. And \nit may well be that the university believes her. But the university might not \nbelieve her. It might treat this contraband as presumptive of guilt. And as \nany number of college students have already learned, our presumptions about \ninnocence disappear in the middle of wars of prohibition. This war is no \ndifferent.",
        "Says von Lohmann,",
        "So when we’re talking about numbers like forty to sixty million Americans that \nare essentially copyright infringers, you create a situation where the civil \nliberties of those people are very much in peril in a general matter. [I don’t] \nthink [there is any] analog where you could randomly choose any person off the \nstreet and be confident that they were committing an unlawful act that could put \nthem on the hook for potential felony liability or hundreds of millions of \ndollars of civil liability. Certainly we all speed, but speeding isn’t the kind \nof an act for which we routinely forfeit civil liberties. Some people use drugs, \nand I think that’s the closest analog, [but] many have noted that the war \nagainst drugs has eroded all of our civil liberties because it’s treated so many \nAmericans as criminals. Well, I think it’s fair to say that file sharing is an \norder of magnitude larger number of Americans than drug use. ... If forty to \nsixty million Americans have become lawbreakers, then we’re really on a slippery \nslope to lose a lot of civil liberties for all forty to sixty million of them.",
        "When forty to sixty million Americans are considered criminals” under the law, \nand when the law could achieve the same objectivesecuring rights to authors\nwithout these millions being considered criminals, who is the villain? \nAmericans or the law? Which is American, a constant war on our own people or a \nconcerted effort through our democracy to change our law?",
        "So here’s the picture: You’re standing at the side of the road. Your car is on \nfire. You are angry and upset because in part you helped start the fire. Now you \ndon’t know how to put it out. Next to you is a bucket, filled with gasoline. \nObviously, gasoline won’t put the fire out.",
        "As you ponder the mess, someone else comes along. In a panic, she grabs the \nbucket. Before you have a chance to tell her to stopor before she understands \njust why she should stopthe bucket is in the air. The gasoline is about to hit \nthe blazing car. And the fire that gasoline will ignite is about to ignite \neverything around.",
        "A war about copyright rages all aroundand we’re all focusing on the wrong \nthing. No doubt, current technologies threaten existing businesses. No doubt \nthey may threaten artists. But technologies change. The industry and \ntechnologists have plenty of ways to use technology to protect themselves \nagainst the current threats of the Internet. This is a fire that if let alone \nwould burn itself out.",
        "Yet policy makers are not willing to leave this fire to itself. Primed with \nplenty of lobbyists’ money, they are keen to intervene to eliminate the problem \nthey perceive. But the problem they perceive is not the real threat this culture \nfaces. For while we watch this small fire in the corner, there is a massive \nchange in the way culture is made that is happening all around.",
        "Somehow we have to find a way to turn attention to this more important and \nfundamental issue. Somehow we have to find a way to avoid pouring gasoline onto \nthis fire.",
        "We have not found that way yet. Instead, we seem trapped in a simpler, binary \nview. However much many people push to frame this debate more broadly, it is the \nsimple, binary view that remains. We rubberneck to look at the fire when we \nshould be keeping our eyes on the road.",
        "This challenge has been my life these last few years. It has also been my \nfailure. In the two chapters that follow, I describe one small brace of efforts, \nso far failed, to find a way to refocus this debate. We must understand these \nfailures if we’re to understand what success will require.",
        "In 1995, a father was frustrated that his daughters didn’t seem to like \nHawthorne. No doubt there was more than one such father, but at least one did \nsomething about it. Eric Eldred, a retired computer programmer living in New \nHampshire, decided to put Hawthorne on the Web. An electronic version, Eldred \nthought, with links to pictures and explanatory text, would make this \nnineteenth-century author’s work come alive.",
        "It didn’t workat least for his daughters. They didn’t find Hawthorne any more \ninteresting than before. But Eldred’s experiment gave birth to a hobby, and his \nhobby begat a cause: Eldred would build a library of public domain works by \nscanning these works and making them available for free.",
        "Eldred’s library was not simply a copy of certain public domain works, though \neven a copy would have been of great value to people across the world who can’t \nget access to printed versions of these works. Instead, Eldred was producing \nderivative works from these public domain works. Just as Disney turned Grimm \ninto stories more accessible to the twentieth century, Eldred transformed \nHawthorne, and many others, into a form more accessibletechnically accessible\ntoday.",
        "Eldred’s freedom to do this with Hawthorne’s work grew from the same source as \nDisney’s. Hawthorne’s Scarlet Letter had passed into the public domain in \n1907. It was free for anyone to take without the permission of the Hawthorne \nestate or anyone else. Some, such as Dover Press and Penguin Classics, take \nworks from the public domain and produce printed editions, which they sell in \nbookstores across the country. Others, such as Disney, take these stories and \nturn them into animated cartoons, sometimes successfully (/Cinderella), \nsometimes not (/The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Treasure Planet). These are all \ncommercial publications of public domain works.",
        "The Internet created the possibility of noncommercial publications of public \ndomain works. Eldred’s is just one example. There are literally thousands of \nothers. Hundreds of thousands from across the world have discovered this \nplatform of expression and now use it to share works that are, by law, free for \nthe taking. This has produced what we might call the noncommercial publishing \nindustry, which before the Internet was limited to people with large egos or \nwith political or social causes. But with the Internet, it includes a wide range \nof individuals and groups dedicated to spreading culture generally. [1]",
        "As I said, Eldred lives in New Hampshire. In 1998, Robert Frost’s collection of \npoems New Hampshire was slated to pass into the public domain. Eldred wanted \nto post that collection in his free public library. But Congress got in the way. \nAs I described in chapter 10, in 1998, for the eleventh time in forty years, \nCongress extended the terms of existing copyrightsthis time by twenty years. \nEldred would not be free to add any works more recent than 1923 to his \ncollection until 2019. Indeed, no copyrighted work would pass into the public \ndomain until that year (and not even then, if Congress extends the term again). \nBy contrast, in the same period, more than 1 million patents will pass into the \npublic domain.",
        "This was the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), enacted in memory \nof the congressman and former musician Sonny Bono, who, his widow, Mary Bono, \nsays, believed that copy- rights should be forever. [2]",
        "Eldred decided to fight this law. He first resolved to fight it through civil \ndisobedience. In a series of interviews, Eldred announced that he would publish \nas planned, CTEA notwithstanding. But because of a second law passed in 1998, \nthe NET (No Electronic Theft) Act, his act of publishing would make Eldred a \nfelonwhether or not anyone complained. This was a dangerous strategy for a \ndisabled programmer to undertake.",
        "It was here that I became involved in Eldred’s battle. I was a constitutional \nscholar whose first passion was constitutional interpretation. And though \nconstitutional law courses never focus upon the Progress Clause of the \nConstitution, it had always struck me as importantly different. As you know, the \nConstitution says,",
        "Congress has the power to promote the Progress of Science ... by securing for \nlimited Times to Authors ... exclusive Right to their ... Writings. ...",
        "As I’ve described, this clause is unique within the power-granting clause of \nArticle I, section 8 of our Constitution. Every other clause granting power to \nCongress simply says Congress has the power to do somethingfor example, to \nregulate commerce among the several states” or declare War. But here, the \nsomething is something quite specificto promote ... Progressthrough means \nthat are also specific by securing exclusive Rights (i.e., copyrights) for \nlimited Times.",
        "In the past forty years, Congress has gotten into the practice of extending \nexisting terms of copyright protection. What puzzled me about this was, if \nCongress has the power to extend existing terms, then the Constitution’s \nrequirement that terms be limited will have no practical effect. If every time \na copyright is about to expire, Congress has the power to extend its term, then \nCongress can achieve what the Constitution plainly forbidsperpetual terms on \nthe installment plan, as Professor Peter Jaszi so nicely put it.",
        "As an academic, my first response was to hit the books. I remember sitting late \nat the office, scouring on-line databases for any serious consideration of the \nquestion. No one had ever challenged Congress’s practice of extending existing \nterms. That failure may in part be why Congress seemed so untroubled in its \nhabit. That, and the fact that the practice had become so lucrative for \nCongress. Congress knows that copyright owners will be willing to pay a great \ndeal of money to see their copyright terms extended. And so Congress is quite \nhappy to keep this gravy train going.",
        "For this is the core of the corruption in our present system of \ngovernment.Corruption not in the sense that representatives are bribed. \nRather, corruption in the sense that the system induces the beneficiaries of \nCongress’s acts to raise and give money to Congress to induce it to act. There’s \nonly so much time; there’s only so much Congress can do. Why not limit its \nactions to those things it must doand those things that pay? Extending \ncopyright terms pays.",
        "If that’s not obvious to you, consider the following: Say you’re one of the very \nfew lucky copyright owners whose copyright continues to make money one hundred \nyears after it was created. The Estate of Robert Frost is a good example. Frost \ndied in 1963. His poetry continues to be extraordinarily valuable. Thus the \nRobert Frost estate benefits greatly from any extension of copyright, since no \npublisher would pay the estate any money if the poems Frost wrote could be \npublished by anyone for free.",
        "So imagine the Robert Frost estate is earning $100,000 a year from three of \nFrost’s poems. And imagine the copyright for those poems is about to expire. You \nsit on the board of the Robert Frost estate. Your financial adviser comes to \nyour board meeting with a very grim report:",
        "Next year, the adviser announces, our copyrights in works A, B, and C will \nexpire. That means that after next year, we will no longer be receiving the \nannual royalty check of $100,000 from the publishers of those works.",
        "There’s a proposal in Congress, however, she continues, that could change \nthis. A few congressmen are floating a bill to extend the terms of copyright by \ntwenty years. That bill would be extraordinarily valuable to us. So we should \nhope this bill passes.",
        "Hope? a fellow board member says. Can’t we be doing something about it?",
        "Well, obviously, yes, the adviser responds. We could contribute to the \ncampaigns of a number of representatives to try to assure that they support the \nbill.",
        "You hate politics. You hate contributing to campaigns. So you want to know \nwhether this disgusting practice is worth it. How much would we get if this \nextension were passed? you ask the adviser. How much is it worth?",
        "Well, the adviser says, if you’re confident that you will continue to get at \nleast $100,000 a year from these copyrights, and you use the ’discount rate’ \nthat we use to evaluate estate investments (6 percent), then this law would be \nworth $1,146,000 to the estate.",
        "You’re a bit shocked by the number, but you quickly come to the correct \nconclusion:",
        "So you’re saying it would be worth it for us to pay more than $1,000,000 in \ncampaign contributions if we were confident those contributions would assure \nthat the bill was passed?",
        "Absolutely, the adviser responds. It is worth it to you to contribute up to \nthe ’present value’ of the income you expect from these copyrights. Which for us \nmeans over $1,000,000.",
        "You quickly get the pointyou as the member of the board and, I trust, you the \nreader. Each time copyrights are about to expire, every beneficiary in the \nposition of the Robert Frost estate faces the same choice: If they can \ncontribute to get a law passed to extend copyrights, they will benefit greatly \nfrom that extension. And so each time copyrights are about to expire, there is a \nmassive amount of lobbying to get the copyright term extended.",
        "Thus a congressional perpetual motion machine: So long as legislation can be \nbought (albeit indirectly), there will be all the incentive in the world to buy \nfurther extensions of copyright.",
        "In the lobbying that led to the passage of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term \nExtension Act, this theory about incentives was proved real. Ten of the \nthirteen original sponsors of the act in the House received the maximum \ncontribution from Disney’s political action committee; in the Senate, eight of \nthe twelve sponsors received contributions. [3] The RIAA and the MPAA are \nestimated to have spent over $1.5 million lobbying in the 1998 election cycle. \nThey paid out more than $200,000 in campaign contributions. [4] Disney is \nestimated to have contributed more than $800,000 to reelection campaigns in the \n1998 cycle. [5]",
        "Constitutional law is not oblivious to the obvious. Or at least, it need not be. \nSo when I was considering Eldred’s complaint, this reality about the never-\nending incentives to increase the copyright term was central to my thinking. In \nmy view, a pragmatic court committed to interpreting and applying the \nConstitution of our framers would see that if Congress has the power to extend \nexisting terms, then there would be no effective constitutional requirement that \nterms be limited. If they could extend it once, they would extend it again and \nagain and again.",
        "It was also my judgment that this Supreme Court would not allow Congress to \nextend existing terms. As anyone close to the Supreme Court’s work knows, this \nCourt has increasingly restricted the power of Congress when it has viewed \nCongress’s actions as exceeding the power granted to it by the Constitution. \nAmong constitutional scholars, the most famous example of this trend was the \nSupreme Court’s decision in 1995 to strike down a law that banned the possession \nof guns near schools.",
        "Since 1937, the Supreme Court had interpreted Congress’s granted powers very \nbroadly; so, while the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate only \ncommerce among the several states (aka interstate commerce”), the Supreme \nCourt had interpreted that power to include the power to regulate any activity \nthat merely affected interstate commerce.",
        "As the economy grew, this standard increasingly meant that there was no limit to \nCongress’s power to regulate, since just about every activity, when considered \non a national scale, affects interstate commerce. A Constitution designed to \nlimit Congress’s power was instead interpreted to impose no limit.",
        "The Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Rehnquist’s command, changed that in \n/United States v. Lopez. The government had argued that possessing guns near \nschools affected interstate commerce. Guns near schools increase crime, crime \nlowers property values, and so on. In the oral argument, the Chief Justice asked \nthe government whether there was any activity that would not affect interstate \ncommerce under the reasoning the government advanced. The government said there \nwas not; if Congress says an activity affects interstate commerce, then that \nactivity affects interstate commerce. The Supreme Court, the government said, \nwas not in the position to second-guess Congress.",
        "We pause to consider the implications of the government’s arguments, the Chief \nJustice wrote. [6] If anything Congress says is interstate commerce must \ntherefore be considered interstate commerce, then there would be no limit to \nCongress’s power. The decision in Lopez was reaffirmed five years later in \n/United States v. Morrison. [7]",
        "If a principle were at work here, then it should apply to the Progress Clause as \nmuch as the Commerce Clause. [8] And if it is applied to the Progress Clause, \nthe principle should yield the conclusion that Congress can’t extend an existing \nterm. If Congress could extend an existing term, then there would be no \nstopping point” to Congress’s power over terms, though the Constitution \nexpressly states that there is such a limit. Thus, the same principle applied to \nthe power to grant copyrights should entail that Congress is not allowed to \nextend the term of existing copyrights.",
        "If, that is, the principle announced in Lopez stood for a principle. Many \nbelieved the decision in Lopez stood for politicsa conservative Supreme \nCourt, which believed in states’ rights, using its power over Congress to \nadvance its own personal political preferences. But I rejected that view of the \nSupreme Court’s decision. Indeed, shortly after the decision, I wrote an article \ndemonstrating the fidelity in such an interpretation of the Constitution. The \nidea that the Supreme Court decides cases based upon its politics struck me as \nextraordinarily boring. I was not going to devote my life to teaching \nconstitutional law if these nine Justices were going to be petty politicians. ",
        "Now let’s pause for a moment to make sure we understand what the argument in \n/Eldred was not about. By insisting on the Constitution’s limits to copyright, \nobviously Eldred was not endorsing piracy. Indeed, in an obvious sense, he was \nfighting a kind of piracypiracy of the public domain. When Robert Frost wrote \nhis work and when Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse, the maximum copyright term \nwas just fifty-six years. Because of interim changes, Frost and Disney had \nalready enjoyed a seventy-five-year monopoly for their work. They had gotten the \nbenefit of the bargain that the Constitution envisions: In exchange for a \nmonopoly protected for fifty-six years, they created new work. But now these \nentities were using their powerexpressed through the power of lobbyists’ money\nto get another twenty-year dollop of monopoly. That twenty-year dollop would be \ntaken from the public domain. Eric Eldred was fighting a piracy that affects us \nall.",
        "Some people view the public domain with contempt. In their brief before the \nSupreme Court, the Nashville Songwriters Association wrote that the public \ndomain is nothing more than legal piracy. [9] But it is not piracy when the \nlaw allows it; and in our constitutional system, our law requires it. Some may \nnot like the Constitution’s requirements, but that doesn’t make the Constitution \na pirate’s charter.",
        "As we’ve seen, our constitutional system requires limits on copyright as a way \nto assure that copyright holders do not too heavily influence the development \nand distribution of our culture. Yet, as Eric Eldred discovered, we have set up \na system that assures that copyright terms will be repeatedly extended, and \nextended, and extended. We have created the perfect storm for the public domain. \nCopyrights have not expired, and will not expire, so long as Congress is free to \nbe bought to extend them again.",
        "It is valuable copyrights that are responsible for terms being extended. Mickey \nMouse and Rhapsody in Blue. These works are too valuable for copyright owners \nto ignore. But the real harm to our society from copyright extensions is not \nthat Mickey Mouse remains Disney’s. Forget Mickey Mouse. Forget Robert Frost. \nForget all the works from the 1920s and 1930s that have continuing commercial \nvalue. The real harm of term extension comes not from these famous works. The \nreal harm is to the works that are not famous, not commercially exploited, and \nno longer available as a result.",
        "If you look at the work created in the first twenty years (1923 to 1942) \naffected by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 2 percent of that work \nhas any continuing commercial value. It was the copyright holders for that 2 \npercent who pushed the CTEA through. But the law and its effect were not limited \nto that 2 percent. The law extended the terms of copyright generally. [10]",
        "Think practically about the consequence of this extensionpractically, as a \nbusinessperson, and not as a lawyer eager for more legal work. In 1930, 10,047 \nbooks were published. In 2000, 174 of those books were still in print. Let’s say \nyou were Brewster Kahle, and you wanted to make available to the world in your \niArchive project the remaining 9,873. What would you have to do?",
        "Well, first, you’d have to determine which of the 9,873 books were still under \ncopyright. That requires going to a library (these data are not on-line) and \npaging through tomes of books, cross-checking the titles and authors of the \n9,873 books with the copyright registration and renewal records for works \npublished in 1930. That will produce a list of books still under copyright.",
        "Then for the books still under copyright, you would need to locate the current \ncopyright owners. How would you do that?",
        "Most people think that there must be a list of these copyright owners somewhere. \nPractical people think this way. How could there be thousands and thousands of \ngovernment monopolies without there being at least a list?",
        "But there is no list. There may be a name from 1930, and then in 1959, of the \nperson who registered the copyright. But just think practically about how \nimpossibly difficult it would be to track down thousands of such records\nespecially since the person who registered is not necessarily the current owner. \nAnd we’re just talking about 1930!",
        "But there isn’t a list of who owns property generally, the apologists for the \nsystem respond. Why should there be a list of copyright owners?",
        "Well, actually, if you think about it, there are plenty of lists of who owns \nwhat property. Think about deeds on houses, or titles to cars. And where there \nisn’t a list, the code of real space is pretty good at suggesting who the owner \nof a bit of property is. (A swing set in your backyard is probably yours.) So \nformally or informally, we have a pretty good way to know who owns what tangible \nproperty.",
        "So: You walk down a street and see a house. You can know who owns the house by \nlooking it up in the courthouse registry. If you see a car, there is ordinarily \na license plate that will link the owner to the car. If you see a bunch of \nchildren’s toys sitting on the front lawn of a house, it’s fairly easy to \ndetermine who owns the toys. And if you happen to see a baseball lying in a \ngutter on the side of the road, look around for a second for some kids playing \nball. If you don’t see any kids, then okay: Here’s a bit of property whose owner \nwe can’t easily determine. It is the exception that proves the rule: that we \nordinarily know quite well who owns what property.",
        "Compare this story to intangible property. You go into a library. The library \nowns the books. But who owns the copyrights? As I’ve already described, there’s \nno list of copyright owners. There are authors’ names, of course, but their \ncopyrights could have been assigned, or passed down in an estate like Grandma’s \nold jewelry. To know who owns what, you would have to hire a private detective. \nThe bottom line: The owner cannot easily be located. And in a regime like ours, \nin which it is a felony to use such property without the property owner’s \npermission, the property isn’t going to be used.",
        "The consequence with respect to old books is that they won’t be digitized, and \nhence will simply rot away on shelves. But the consequence for other creative \nworks is much more dire.",
        "Consider the story of Michael Agee, chairman of Hal Roach Studios, which owns \nthe copyrights for the Laurel and Hardy films. Agee is a direct beneficiary of \nthe Bono Act. The Laurel and Hardy films were made between 1921 and 1951. Only \none of these films, The Lucky Dog, is currently out of copyright. But for the \nCTEA, films made after 1923 would have begun entering the public domain. Because \nAgee controls the exclusive rights for these popular films, he makes a great \ndeal of money. According to one estimate, Roach has sold about 60,000 \nvideocassettes and 50,000 DVDs of the duo’s silent films. [11]",
        "Yet Agee opposed the CTEA. His reasons demonstrate a rare virtue in this \nculture: selflessness. He argued in a brief before the Supreme Court that the \nSonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act will, if left standing, destroy a whole \ngeneration of American film.",
        "His argument is straightforward. A tiny fraction of this work has any continuing \ncommercial value. The restto the extent it survives at allsits in vaults \ngathering dust. It may be that some of this work not now commercially valuable \nwill be deemed to be valuable by the owners of the vaults. For this to occur, \nhowever, the commercial benefit from the work must exceed the costs of making \nthe work available for distribution.",
        "We can’t know the benefits, but we do know a lot about the costs. For most of \nthe history of film, the costs of restoring film were very high; digital \ntechnology has lowered these costs substantially. While it cost more than \n$10,000 to restore a ninety-minute black-and-white film in 1993, it can now cost \nas little as $100 to digitize one hour of 8 mm film. [12]",
        "Restoration technology is not the only cost, nor the most important. Lawyers, \ntoo, are a cost, and increasingly, a very important one. In addition to \npreserving the film, a distributor needs to secure the rights. And to secure the \nrights for a film that is under copyright, you need to locate the copyright \nowner.",
        "Or more accurately, owners. As we’ve seen, there isn’t only a single copyright \nassociated with a film; there are many. There isn’t a single person whom you can \ncontact about those copyrights; there are as many as can hold the rights, which \nturns out to be an extremely large number. Thus the costs of clearing the rights \nto these films is exceptionally high.",
        "But can’t you just restore the film, distribute it, and then pay the copyright \nowner when she shows up? Sure, if you want to commit a felony. And even if \nyou’re not worried about committing a felony, when she does show up, she’ll have \nthe right to sue you for all the profits you have made. So, if you’re \nsuccessful, you can be fairly confident you’ll be getting a call from someone’s \nlawyer. And if you’re not successful, you won’t make enough to cover the costs \nof your own lawyer. Either way, you have to talk to a lawyer. And as is too \noften the case, saying you have to talk to a lawyer is the same as saying you \nwon’t make any money.",
        "For some films, the benefit of releasing the film may well exceed these costs. \nBut for the vast majority of them, there is no way the benefit would outweigh \nthe legal costs. Thus, for the vast majority of old films, Agee argued, the film \nwill not be restored and distributed until the copyright expires.",
        "But by the time the copyright for these films expires, the film will have \nexpired. These films were produced on nitrate-based stock, and nitrate stock \ndissolves over time. They will be gone, and the metal canisters in which they \nare now stored will be filled with nothing more than dust.",
        "Of all the creative work produced by humans anywhere, a tiny fraction has \ncontinuing commercial value. For that tiny fraction, the copyright is a \ncrucially important legal device. For that tiny fraction, the copyright creates \nincentives to produce and distribute the creative work. For that tiny fraction, \nthe copyright acts as an engine of free expression.",
        "But even for that tiny fraction, the actual time during which the creative work \nhas a commercial life is extremely short. As I’ve indicated, most books go out \nof print within one year. The same is true of music and film. Commercial culture \nis sharklike. It must keep moving. And when a creative work falls out of favor \nwith the commercial distributors, the commercial life ends.",
        "Yet that doesn’t mean the life of the creative work ends. We don’t keep \nlibraries of books in order to compete with Barnes & Noble, and we don’t have \narchives of films because we expect people to choose between spending Friday \nnight watching new movies and spending Friday night watching a 1930 news \ndocumentary. The noncommercial life of culture is important and valuablefor \nentertainment but also, and more importantly, for knowledge. To understand who \nwe are, and where we came from, and how we have made the mistakes that we have, \nwe need to have access to this history.",
        "Copyrights in this context do not drive an engine of free expression. In this \ncontext, there is no need for an exclusive right. Copyrights in this context do \nno good.",
        "Yet, for most of our history, they also did little harm. For most of our \nhistory, when a work ended its commercial life, there was no copyright-related \nuse that would be inhibited by an exclusive right. When a book went out of \nprint, you could not buy it from a publisher. But you could still buy it from a \nused book store, and when a used book store sells it, in America, at least, \nthere is no need to pay the copyright owner anything. Thus, the ordinary use of \na book after its commercial life ended was a use that was independent of \ncopyright law.",
        "The same was effectively true of film. Because the costs of restoring a filmthe \nreal economic costs, not the lawyer costswere so high, it was never at all \nfeasible to preserve or restore film. Like the remains of a great dinner, when \nit’s over, it’s over. Once a film passed out of its commercial life, it may have \nbeen archived for a bit, but that was the end of its life so long as the market \ndidn’t have more to offer.",
        "In other words, though copyright has been relatively short for most of our \nhistory, long copyrights wouldn’t have mattered for the works that lost their \ncommercial value. Long copyrights for these works would not have interfered with \nanything.",
        "But this situation has now changed.",
        "One crucially important consequence of the emergence of digital technologies is \nto enable the archive that Brewster Kahle dreams of. Digital technologies now \nmake it possible to preserve and give access to all sorts of knowledge. Once a \nbook goes out of print, we can now imagine digitizing it and making it available \nto everyone, forever. Once a film goes out of distribution, we could digitize it \nand make it available to everyone, forever. Digital technologies give new life \nto copyrighted material after it passes out of its commercial life. It is now \npossible to preserve and assure universal access to this knowledge and culture, \nwhereas before it was not.",
        "And now copyright law does get in the way. Every step of producing this digital \narchive of our culture infringes on the exclusive right of copyright. To \ndigitize a book is to copy it. To do that requires permission of the copyright \nowner. The same with music, film, or any other aspect of our culture protected \nby copyright. The effort to make these things available to history, or to \nresearchers, or to those who just want to explore, is now inhibited by a set of \nrules that were written for a radically different context.",
        "Here is the core of the harm that comes from extending terms: Now that \ntechnology enables us to rebuild the library of Alexandria, the law gets in the \nway. And it doesn’t get in the way for any useful copyright purpose, for the \npurpose of copyright is to enable the commercial market that spreads culture. \nNo, we are talking about culture after it has lived its commercial life. In this \ncontext, copyright is serving no purpose at all related to the spread of \nknowledge. In this context, copyright is not an engine of free expression. \nCopyright is a brake.",
        "You may well ask, But if digital technologies lower the costs for Brewster \nKahle, then they will lower the costs for Random House, too. So won’t Random \nHouse do as well as Brewster Kahle in spreading culture widely?",
        "Maybe. Someday. But there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that publishers \nwould be as complete as libraries. If Barnes & Noble offered to lend books from \nits stores for a low price, would that eliminate the need for libraries? Only if \nyou think that the only role of a library is to serve what the market would \ndemand. But if you think the role of a library is bigger than thisif you think \nits role is to archive culture, whether there’s a demand for any particular bit \nof that culture or notthen we can’t count on the commercial market to do our \nlibrary work for us.",
        "I would be the first to agree that it should do as much as it can: We should \nrely upon the market as much as possible to spread and enable culture. My \nmessage is absolutely not antimarket. But where we see the market is not doing \nthe job, then we should allow nonmarket forces the freedom to fill the gaps. As \none researcher calculated for American culture, 94 percent of the films, books, \nand music produced between 1923 and 1946 is not commercially available. However \nmuch you love the commercial market, if access is a value, then 6 percent is a \nfailure to provide that value. [13]",
        "In January 1999, we filed a lawsuit on Eric Eldred’s behalf in federal district \ncourt in Washington, D.C., asking the court to declare the Sonny Bono Copyright \nTerm Extension Act unconstitutional. The two central claims that we made were \n(1) that extending existing terms violated the Constitution’s limited Times \nrequirement, and (2) that extending terms by another twenty years violated the \nFirst Amendment.",
        "The district court dismissed our claims without even hearing an argument. A \npanel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit also dismissed our claims, \nthough after hearing an extensive argument. But that decision at least had a \ndissent, by one of the most conservative judges on that court. That dissent gave \nour claims life.",
        "Judge David Sentelle said the CTEA violated the requirement that copyrights be \nfor limited Times only. His argument was as elegant as it was simple: If \nCongress can extend existing terms, then there is no stopping point to \nCongress’s power under the Copyright Clause. The power to extend existing terms \nmeans Congress is not required to grant terms that are limited. Thus, Judge \nSentelle argued, the court had to interpret the term limited Times to give it \nmeaning. And the best interpretation, Judge Sentelle argued, would be to deny \nCongress the power to extend existing terms.",
        "We asked the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit as a whole to hear the case. \nCases are ordinarily heard in panels of three, except for important cases or \ncases that raise issues specific to the circuit as a whole, where the court will \nsit en banc to hear the case.",
        "The Court of Appeals rejected our request to hear the case en banc. This time, \nJudge Sentelle was joined by the most liberal member of the D.C. Circuit, Judge \nDavid Tatel. Both the most conservative and the most liberal judges in the D.C. \nCircuit believed Congress had over-stepped its bounds.",
        "It was here that most expected Eldred v. Ashcroft would die, for the Supreme \nCourt rarely reviews any decision by a court of appeals. (It hears about one \nhundred cases a year, out of more than five thousand appeals.) And it \npractically never reviews a decision that upholds a statute when no other court \nhas yet reviewed the statute.",
        "But in February 2002, the Supreme Court surprised the world by granting our \npetition to review the D.C. Circuit opinion. Argument was set for October of \n2002. The summer would be spent writing briefs and preparing for argument.",
        "It is over a year later as I write these words. It is still astonishingly hard. \nIf you know anything at all about this story, you know that we lost the appeal. \nAnd if you know something more than just the minimum, you probably think there \nwas no way this case could have been won. After our defeat, I received literally \nthousands of missives by well-wishers and supporters, thanking me for my work on \nbehalf of this noble but doomed cause. And none from this pile was more \nsignificant to me than the e-mail from my client, Eric Eldred.",
        "But my client and these friends were wrong. This case could have been won. It \nshould have been won. And no matter how hard I try to retell this story to \nmyself, I can never escape believing that my own mistake lost it.",
        "The mistake was made early, though it became obvious only at the very end. Our \ncase had been supported from the very beginning by an extraordinary lawyer, \nGeoffrey Stewart, and by the law firm he had moved to, Jones, Day, Reavis and \nPogue. Jones Day took a great deal of heat from its copyright-protectionist \nclients for supporting us. They ignored this pressure (something that few law \nfirms today would ever do), and throughout the case, they gave it everything \nthey could.",
        "There were three key lawyers on the case from Jones Day. Geoff Stewart was the \nfirst, but then Dan Bromberg and Don Ayer became quite involved. Bromberg and \nAyer in particular had a common view about how this case would be won: We would \nonly win, they repeatedly told me, if we could make the issue seem important \nto the Supreme Court. It had to seem as if dramatic harm were being done to free \nspeech and free culture; otherwise, they would never vote against the most \npowerful media companies in the world.",
        "I hate this view of the law. Of course I thought the Sonny Bono Act was a \ndramatic harm to free speech and free culture. Of course I still think it is. \nBut the idea that the Supreme Court decides the law based on how important they \nbelieve the issues are is just wrong. It might be right as in true, I \nthought, but it is wrong as in it just shouldn’t be that way. As I believed \nthat any faithful interpretation of what the framers of our Constitution did \nwould yield the conclusion that the CTEA was unconstitutional, and as I believed \nthat any faithful interpretation of what the First Amendment means would yield \nthe conclusion that the power to extend existing copyright terms is \nunconstitutional, I was not persuaded that we had to sell our case like soap. \nJust as a law that bans the swastika is unconstitutional not because the Court \nlikes Nazis but because such a law would violate the Constitution, so too, in my \nview, would the Court decide whether Congress’s law was constitutional based on \nthe Constitution, not based on whether they liked the values that the framers \nput in the Constitution.",
        "In any case, I thought, the Court must already see the danger and the harm \ncaused by this sort of law. Why else would they grant review? There was no \nreason to hear the case in the Supreme Court if they weren’t convinced that this \nregulation was harmful. So in my view, we didn’t need to persuade them that this \nlaw was bad, we needed to show why it was unconstitutional.",
        "There was one way, however, in which I felt politics would matter and in which I \nthought a response was appropriate. I was convinced that the Court would not \nhear our arguments if it thought these were just the arguments of a group of \nlefty loons. This Supreme Court was not about to launch into a new field of \njudicial review if it seemed that this field of review was simply the preference \nof a small political minority. Although my focus in the case was not to \ndemonstrate how bad the Sonny Bono Act was but to demonstrate that it was \nunconstitutional, my hope was to make this argument against a background of \nbriefs that covered the full range of political views. To show that this claim \nagainst the CTEA was grounded in law and not politics, then, we tried to \ngather the widest range of credible criticscredible not because they were rich \nand famous, but because they, in the aggregate, demonstrated that this law was \nunconstitutional regardless of one’s politics.",
        "The first step happened all by itself. Phyllis Schlafly’s organization, Eagle \nForum, had been an opponent of the CTEA from the very beginning. Mrs. Schlafly \nviewed the CTEA as a sellout by Congress. In November 1998, she wrote a stinging \neditorial attacking the Republican Congress for allowing the law to pass. As she \nwrote, Do you sometimes wonder why bills that create a financial windfall to \nnarrow special interests slide easily through the intricate legislative process, \nwhile bills that benefit the general public seem to get bogged down? The \nanswer, as the editorial documented, was the power of money. Schlafly enumerated \nDisney’s contributions to the key players on the committees. It was money, not \njustice, that gave Mickey Mouse twenty more years in Disney’s control, Schlafly \nargued.",
        "In the Court of Appeals, Eagle Forum was eager to file a brief supporting our \nposition. Their brief made the argument that became the core claim in the \nSupreme Court: If Congress can extend the term of existing copyrights, there is \nno limit to Congress’s power to set terms. That strong conservative argument \npersuaded a strong conservative judge, Judge Sentelle.",
        "In the Supreme Court, the briefs on our side were about as diverse as it gets. \nThey included an extraordinary historical brief by the Free Software Foundation \n(home of the GNU project that made GNU Linux possible). They included a \npowerful brief about the costs of uncertainty by Intel. There were two law \nprofessors’ briefs, one by copyright scholars and one by First Amendment \nscholars. There was an exhaustive and uncontroverted brief by the world’s \nexperts in the history of the Progress Clause. And of course, there was a new \nbrief by Eagle Forum, repeating and strengthening its arguments.",
        "Those briefs framed a legal argument. Then to support the legal argument, there \nwere a number of powerful briefs by libraries and archives, including the \nInternet Archive, the American Association of Law Libraries, and the National \nWriters Union.",
        "But two briefs captured the policy argument best. One made the argument I’ve \nalready described: A brief by Hal Roach Studios argued that unless the law was \nstruck, a whole generation of American film would disappear. The other made the \neconomic argument absolutely clear.",
        "This economists’ brief was signed by seventeen economists, including five Nobel \nPrize winners, including Ronald Coase, James Buchanan, Milton Friedman, Kenneth \nArrow, and George Akerlof. The economists, as the list of Nobel winners \ndemonstrates, spanned the political spectrum. Their conclusions were powerful: \nThere was no plausible claim that extending the terms of existing copyrights \nwould do anything to increase incentives to create. Such extensions were nothing \nmore than rent-seekingthe fancy term economists use to describe special-\ninterest legislation gone wild.",
        "The same effort at balance was reflected in the legal team we gathered to write \nour briefs in the case. The Jones Day lawyers had been with us from the start. \nBut when the case got to the Supreme Court, we added three lawyers to help us \nframe this argument to this Court: Alan Morrison, a lawyer from Public Citizen, \na Washington group that had made constitutional history with a series of seminal \nvictories in the Supreme Court defending individual rights; my colleague and \ndean, Kathleen Sullivan, who had argued many cases in the Court, and who had \nadvised us early on about a First Amendment strategy; and finally, former \nsolicitor general Charles Fried.",
        "Fried was a special victory for our side. Every other former solicitor general \nwas hired by the other side to defend Congress’s power to give media companies \nthe special favor of extended copyright terms. Fried was the only one who turned \ndown that lucrative assignment to stand up for something he believed in. He had \nbeen Ronald Reagan’s chief lawyer in the Supreme Court. He had helped craft the \nline of cases that limited Congress’s power in the context of the Commerce \nClause. And while he had argued many positions in the Supreme Court that I \npersonally disagreed with, his joining the cause was a vote of confidence in our \nargument.",
        "The government, in defending the statute, had its collection of friends, as \nwell. Significantly, however, none of these friends” included historians or \neconomists. The briefs on the other side of the case were written exclusively by \nmajor media companies, congressmen, and copyright holders.",
        "The media companies were not surprising. They had the most to gain from the law. \nThe congressmen were not surprising eitherthey were defending their power and, \nindirectly, the gravy train of contributions such power induced. And of course \nit was not surprising that the copyright holders would defend the idea that they \nshould continue to have the right to control who did what with content they \nwanted to control.",
        "Dr.Seuss’s representatives, for example, argued that it was better for the Dr. \nSeuss estate to control what happened to Dr. Seuss’s workbetter than allowing \nit to fall into the public domainbecause if this creativity were in the public \ndomain, then people could use it to glorify drugs or to create pornography. \n[14] That was also the motive of the Gershwin estate, which defended its \nprotection of the work of George Gershwin. They refuse, for example, to \nlicense Porgy and Bess to anyone who refuses to use African Americans in the \ncast. [15] That’s their view of how this part of American culture should be \ncontrolled, and they wanted this law to help them effect that control.",
        "This argument made clear a theme that is rarely noticed in this debate. When \nCongress decides to extend the term of existing copyrights, Congress is making a \nchoice about which speakers it will favor. Famous and beloved copyright owners, \nsuch as the Gershwin estate and Dr. Seuss, come to Congress and say, Give us \ntwenty years to control the speech about these icons of American culture. We’ll \ndo better with them than anyone else. Congress of course likes to reward the \npopular and famous by giving them what they want. But when Congress gives people \nan exclusive right to speak in a certain way, that’s just what the First \nAmendment is traditionally meant to block.",
        "We argued as much in a final brief. Not only would upholding the CTEA mean that \nthere was no limit to the power of Congress to extend copyrightsextensions that \nwould further concentrate the market; it would also mean that there was no limit \nto Congress’s power to play favorites, through copyright, with who has the right \nto speak.",
        "Between February and October, there was little I did beyond preparing for this \ncase. Early on, as I said, I set the strategy.",
        "The Supreme Court was divided into two important camps. One camp we called the \nConservatives. The other we called the Rest. The Conservatives included Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, Justice O’Connor, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and \nJustice Thomas. These five had been the most consistent in limiting Congress’s \npower. They were the five who had supported the Lopez/Morrison line of cases \nthat said that an enumerated power had to be interpreted to assure that \nCongress’s powers had limits.",
        "The Rest were the four Justices who had strongly opposed limits on Congress’s \npower. These fourJustice Stevens, Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice \nBreyerhad repeatedly argued that the Constitution gives Congress broad \ndiscretion to decide how best to implement its powers. In case after case, these \njustices had argued that the Court’s role should be one of deference. Though the \nvotes of these four justices were the votes that I personally had most \nconsistently agreed with, they were also the votes that we were least likely to \nget.",
        "In particular, the least likely was Justice Ginsburg’s. In addition to her \ngeneral view about deference to Congress (except where issues of gender are \ninvolved), she had been particularly deferential in the context of intellectual \nproperty protections. She and her daughter (an excellent and well-known \nintellectual property scholar) were cut from the same intellectual property \ncloth. We expected she would agree with the writings of her daughter: that \nCongress had the power in this context to do as it wished, even if what Congress \nwished made little sense.",
        "Close behind Justice Ginsburg were two justices whom we also viewed as unlikely \nallies, though possible surprises. Justice Souter strongly favored deference to \nCongress, as did Justice Breyer. But both were also very sensitive to free \nspeech concerns. And as we strongly believed, there was a very important free \nspeech argument against these retrospective extensions.",
        "The only vote we could be confident about was that of Justice Stevens. History \nwill record Justice Stevens as one of the greatest judges on this Court. His \nvotes are consistently eclectic, which just means that no simple ideology \nexplains where he will stand. But he had consistently argued for limits in the \ncontext of intellectual property generally. We were fairly confident he would \nrecognize limits here.",
        "This analysis of the Rest showed most clearly where our focus had to be: on \nthe Conservatives. To win this case, we had to crack open these five and get at \nleast a majority to go our way.Thus, the single overriding argument that \nanimated our claim rested on the Conservatives’ most important jurisprudential \ninnovationthe argument that Judge Sentelle had relied upon in the Court of \nAppeals, that Congress’s power must be interpreted so that its enumerated powers \nhave limits.",
        "This then was the core of our strategya strategy for which I am responsible. We \nwould get the Court to see that just as with the Lopez case, under the \ngovernment’s argument here, Congress would always have unlimited power to extend \nexisting terms. If anything was plain about Congress’s power under the Progress \nClause, it was that this power was supposed to be limited. Our aim would be to \nget the Court to reconcile Eldred with Lopez: If Congress’s power to \nregulate commerce was limited, then so, too, must Congress’s power to regulate \ncopyright be limited.",
        "The argument on the government’s side came down to this: Congress has done it \nbefore. It should be allowed to do it again. The government claimed that from \nthe very beginning, Congress has been extending the term of existing copyrights. \nSo, the government argued, the Court should not now say that practice is \nunconstitutional.",
        "There was some truth to the government’s claim, but not much. We certainly \nagreed that Congress had extended existing terms in 1831 and in 1909. And of \ncourse, in 1962, Congress began extending existing terms regularlyeleven times \nin forty years.",
        "But this consistency should be kept in perspective. Congress extended existing \nterms once in the first hundred years of the Republic. It then extended existing \nterms once again in the next fifty. Those rare extensions are in contrast to the \nnow regular practice of extending existing terms. Whatever restraint Congress \nhad had in the past, that restraint was now gone. Congress was now in a cycle of \nextensions; there was no reason to expect that cycle would end. This Court had \nnot hesitated to intervene where Congress was in a similar cycle of extension. \nThere was no reason it couldn’t intervene here.",
        "Oral argument was scheduled for the first week in October. I arrived in D.C. two \nweeks before the argument. During those two weeks, I was repeatedly mooted by \nlawyers who had volunteered to help in the case. Such moots are basically \npractice rounds, where wannabe justices fire questions at wannabe winners.",
        "I was convinced that to win, I had to keep the Court focused on a single point: \nthat if this extension is permitted, then there is no limit to the power to set \nterms. Going with the government would mean that terms would be effectively \nunlimited; going with us would give Congress a clear line to follow: Don’t \nextend existing terms. The moots were an effective practice; I found ways to \ntake every question back to this central idea.",
        "One moot was before the lawyers at Jones Day. Don Ayer was the skeptic. He had \nserved in the Reagan Justice Department with Solicitor General Charles Fried. He \nhad argued many cases before the Supreme Court. And in his review of the moot, \nhe let his concern speak:",
        "I’m just afraid that unless they really see the harm, they won’t be willing to \nupset this practice that the government says has been a consistent practice for \ntwo hundred years. You have to make them see the harmpassionately get them to \nsee the harm. For if they don’t see that, then we haven’t any chance of \nwinning.",
        "He may have argued many cases before this Court, I thought, but he didn’t \nunderstand its soul. As a clerk, I had seen the Justices do the right thingnot \nbecause of politics but because it was right. As a law professor, I had spent my \nlife teaching my students that this Court does the right thingnot because of \npolitics but because it is right. As I listened to Ayer’s plea for passion in \npressing politics, I understood his point, and I rejected it. Our argument was \nright. That was enough. Let the politicians learn to see that it was also good.",
        "The night before the argument, a line of people began to form in front of the \nSupreme Court. The case had become a focus of the press and of the movement to \nfree culture. Hundreds stood in line for the chance to see the proceedings. \nScores spent the night on the Supreme Court steps so that they would be assured \na seat.",
        "Not everyone has to wait in line. People who know the Justices can ask for seats \nthey control. (I asked Justice Scalia’s chambers for seats for my parents, for \nexample.) Members of the Supreme Court bar can get a seat in a special section \nreserved for them. And senators and congressmen have a special place where they \nget to sit, too. And finally, of course, the press has a gallery, as do clerks \nworking for the Justices on the Court. As we entered that morning, there was no \nplace that was not taken. This was an argument about intellectual property law, \nyet the halls were filled. As I walked in to take my seat at the front of the \nCourt, I saw my parents sitting on the left. As I sat down at the table, I saw \nJack Valenti sitting in the special section ordinarily reserved for family of \nthe Justices.",
        "When the Chief Justice called me to begin my argument, I began where I intended \nto stay: on the question of the limits on Congress’s power. This was a case \nabout enumerated powers, I said, and whether those enumerated powers had any \nlimit.",
        "Justice O’Connor stopped me within one minute of my opening. The history was \nbothering her.",
        "JUSTICE O’CONNOR: Congress has extended the term so often through the years, \nand if you are right, don’t we run the risk of upsetting previous extensions of \ntime? I mean, this seems to be a practice that began with the very first act.",
        "She was quite willing to concede that this flies directly in the face of what \nthe framers had in mind. But my response again and again was to emphasize \nlimits on Congress’s power.",
        "MR. LESSIG: Well, if it flies in the face of what the framers had in mind, then \nthe question is, is there a way of interpreting their words that gives effect to \nwhat they had in mind, and the answer is yes.",
        "There were two points in this argument when I should have seen where the Court \nwas going. The first was a question by Justice Kennedy, who observed,",
        "JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose implicit in the argument that the 76 act, \ntoo, should have been declared void, and that we might leave it alone because of \nthe disruption, is that for all these years the act has impeded progress in \nscience and the useful arts. I just don’t see any empirical evidence for that.",
        "Here follows my clear mistake. Like a professor correcting a student, I \nanswered,",
        "MR. LESSIG: Justice, we are not making an empirical claim at all. Nothing in \nour Copyright Clause claim hangs upon the empirical assertion about impeding \nprogress. Our only argument is this is a structural limit necessary to assure \nthat what would be an effectively perpetual term not be permitted under the \ncopyright laws.",
        "That was a correct answer, but it wasn’t the right answer. The right answer was \ninstead that there was an obvious and profound harm. Any number of briefs had \nbeen written about it. He wanted to hear it. And here was the place Don Ayer’s \nadvice should have mattered. This was a softball; my answer was a swing and a \nmiss.",
        "The second came from the Chief, for whom the whole case had been crafted. For \nthe Chief Justice had crafted the Lopez ruling, and we hoped that he would see \nthis case as its second cousin.",
        "It was clear a second into his question that he wasn’t at all sympathetic. To \nhim, we were a bunch of anarchists. As he asked:",
        "CHIEF JUSTICE: Well, but you want more than that. You want the right to copy \nverbatim other people’s books, don’t you?",
        "MR. LESSIG: We want the right to copy verbatim works that should be in the \npublic domain and would be in the public domain but for a statute that cannot be \njustified under ordinary First Amendment analysis or under a proper reading of \nthe limits built into the Copyright Clause.",
        "Things went better for us when the government gave its argument; for now the \nCourt picked up on the core of our claim. As Justice Scalia asked Solicitor \nGeneral Olson,",
        "JUSTICE SCALIA: You say that the functional equivalent of an unlimited time \nwould be a violation [of the Constitution], but that’s precisely the argument \nthat’s being made by petitioners here, that a limited time which is extendable \nis the functional equivalent of an unlimited time.",
        "When Olson was finished, it was my turn to give a closing rebuttal. Olson’s \nflailing had revived my anger. But my anger still was directed to the academic, \nnot the practical. The government was arguing as if this were the first case \never to consider limits on Congress’s Copyright and Patent Clause power. Ever \nthe professor and not the advocate, I closed by pointing out the long history of \nthe Court imposing limits on Congress’s power in the name of the Copyright and \nPatent Clauseindeed, the very first case striking a law of Congress as \nexceeding a specific enumerated power was based upon the Copyright and Patent \nClause. All true. But it wasn’t going to move the Court to my side.",
        "As I left the court that day, I knew there were a hundred points I wished I \ncould remake. There were a hundred questions I wished I had answered \ndifferently. But one way of thinking about this case left me optimistic.",
        "The government had been asked over and over again, what is the limit? Over and \nover again, it had answered there is no limit. This was precisely the answer I \nwanted the Court to hear. For I could not imagine how the Court could understand \nthat the government believed Congress’s power was unlimited under the terms of \nthe Copyright Clause, and sustain the government’s argument. The solicitor \ngeneral had made my argument for me. No matter how often I tried, I could not \nunderstand how the Court could find that Congress’s power under the Commerce \nClause was limited, but under the Copyright Clause, unlimited. In those rare \nmoments when I let myself believe that we may have prevailed, it was because I \nfelt this Courtin particular, the Conservativeswould feel itself constrained \nby the rule of law that it had established elsewhere.",
        "The morning of January 15, 2003, I was five minutes late to the office and \nmissed the 7:00 A.M.call from the Supreme Court clerk. Listening to the message, \nI could tell in an instant that she had bad news to report.The Supreme Court had \naffirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. Seven justices had voted in the \nmajority. There were two dissents.",
        "A few seconds later, the opinions arrived by e-mail. I took the phone off the \nhook, posted an announcement to our blog, and sat down to see where I had been \nwrong in my reasoning.",
        "My reasoning. Here was a case that pitted all the money in the world against \n/reasoning. And here was the last naïve law professor, scouring the pages, \nlooking for reasoning.",
        "I first scoured the opinion, looking for how the Court would distinguish the \nprinciple in this case from the principle in Lopez. The argument was nowhere \nto be found. The case was not even cited. The argument that was the core \nargument of our case did not even appear in the Court’s opinion.",
        "Justice Ginsburg simply ignored the enumerated powers argument. Consistent with \nher view that Congress’s power was not limited generally, she had found \nCongress’s power not limited here.",
        "Her opinion was perfectly reasonablefor her, and for Justice Souter. Neither \nbelieves in Lopez. It would be too much to expect them to write an opinion \nthat recognized, much less explained, the doctrine they had worked so hard to \ndefeat.",
        "But as I realized what had happened, I couldn’t quite believe what I was \nreading. I had said there was no way this Court could reconcile limited powers \nwith the Commerce Clause and unlimited powers with the Progress Clause. It had \nnever even occurred to me that they could reconcile the two simply by not \naddressing the argument. There was no inconsistency because they would not talk \nabout the two together. There was therefore no principle that followed from the \nLopez case: In that context, Congress’s power would be limited, but in this \ncontext it would not.",
        "Yet by what right did they get to choose which of the framers’ values they would \nrespect? By what right did theythe silent fiveget to select the part of the \nConstitution they would enforce based on the values they thought important? We \nwere right back to the argument that I said I hated at the start: I had failed \nto convince them that the issue here was important, and I had failed to \nrecognize that however much I might hate a system in which the Court gets to \npick the constitutional values that it will respect, that is the system we have.",
        "Justices Breyer and Stevens wrote very strong dissents. Stevens’s opinion was \ncrafted internal to the law: He argued that the tradition of intellectual \nproperty law should not support this unjustified extension of terms. He based \nhis argument on a parallel analysis that had governed in the context of patents \n(so had we). But the rest of the Court discounted the parallelwithout \nexplaining how the very same words in the Progress Clause could come to mean \ntotally different things depending upon whether the words were about patents or \ncopyrights. The Court let Justice Stevens’s charge go unanswered.",
        "Justice Breyer’s opinion, perhaps the best opinion he has ever written, was \nexternal to the Constitution. He argued that the term of copyrights has become \nso long as to be effectively unlimited. We had said that under the current term, \na copyright gave an author 99.8 percent of the value of a perpetual term. Breyer \nsaid we were wrong, that the actual number was 99.9997 percent of a perpetual \nterm. Either way, the point was clear: If the Constitution said a term had to be \nlimited, and the existing term was so long as to be effectively unlimited, \nthen it was unconstitutional.",
        "These two justices understood all the arguments we had made. But because neither \nbelieved in the Lopez case, neither was willing to push it as a reason to \nreject this extension. The case was decided without anyone having addressed the \nargument that we had carried from Judge Sentelle. It was Hamlet without the \nPrince.",
        "Defeat brings depression. They say it is a sign of health when depression gives \nway to anger. My anger came quickly, but it didn’t cure the depression. This \nanger was of two sorts.",
        "It was first anger with the five Conservatives. It would have been one thing \nfor them to have explained why the principle of Lopez didn’t apply in this \ncase. That wouldn’t have been a very convincing argument, I don’t believe, \nhaving read it made by others, and having tried to make it myself. But it at \nleast would have been an act of integrity. These justices in particular have \nrepeatedly said that the proper mode of interpreting the Constitution is \noriginalismto first understand the framers’ text, interpreted in their \ncontext, in light of the structure of the Constitution. That method had produced \nLopez and many other originalist rulings. Where was their originalism” now?",
        "Here, they had joined an opinion that never once tried to explain what the \nframers had meant by crafting the Progress Clause as they did; they joined an \nopinion that never once tried to explain how the structure of that clause would \naffect the interpretation of Congress’s power. And they joined an opinion that \ndidn’t even try to explain why this grant of power could be unlimited, whereas \nthe Commerce Clause would be limited. In short, they had joined an opinion that \ndid not apply to, and was inconsistent with, their own method for interpreting \nthe Constitution. This opinion may well have yielded a result that they liked. \nIt did not produce a reason that was consistent with their own principles.",

        "Most lawyers, and most law professors, have little patience for idealism about \ncourts in general and this Supreme Court in particular. Most have a much more \npragmatic view. When Don Ayer said that this case would be won based on whether \nI could convince the Justices that the framers’ values were important, I fought \nthe idea, because I didn’t want to believe that that is how this Court decides. \nI insisted on arguing this case as if it were a simple application of a set of \nprinciples. I had an argument that followed in logic. I didn’t need to waste my \ntime showing it should also follow in popularity.",
        "As I read back over the transcript from that argument in October, I can see a \nhundred places where the answers could have taken the conversation in different \ndirections, where the truth about the harm that this unchecked power will cause \ncould have been made clear to this Court. Justice Kennedy in good faith wanted \nto be shown. I, idiotically, corrected his question. Justice Souter in good \nfaith wanted to be shown the First Amendment harms. I, like a math teacher, \nreframed the question to make the logical point. I had shown them how they could \nstrike this law of Congress if they wanted to. There were a hundred places where \nI could have helped them want to, yet my stubbornness, my refusal to give in, \nstopped me. I have stood before hundreds of audiences trying to persuade; I have \nused passion in that effort to persuade; but I refused to stand before this \naudience and try to persuade with the passion I had used elsewhere. It was not \nthe basis on which a court should decide the issue.",

        "My friends huddled around me to insist it would not. The Court was not ready, my \nfriends insisted. This was a loss that was destined. It would take a great deal \nmore to show our society why our framers were right. And when we do that, we \nwill be able to show that Court.",
        "Maybe, but I doubt it. These Justices have no financial interest in doing \nanything except the right thing. They are not lobbied. They have little reason \nto resist doing right. I can’t help but think that if I had stepped down from \nthis pretty picture of dispassionate justice, I could have persuaded.",
        "And even if I couldn’t, then that doesn’t excuse what happened in January. For \nat the start of this case, one of America’s leading intellectual property \nprofessors stated publicly that my bringing this case was a mistake. The Court \nis not ready, Peter Jaszi said; this issue should not be raised until it is.",
        "After the argument and after the decision, Peter said to me, and publicly, that \nhe was wrong. But if indeed that Court could not have been persuaded, then that \nis all the evidence that’s needed to know that here again Peter was right. \nEither I was not ready to argue this case in a way that would do some good or \nthey were not ready to hear this case in a way that would do some good. Either \nway, the decision to bring this casea decision I had made four years beforewas \nwrong.",
        "While the reaction to the Sonny Bono Act itself was almost unanimously negative, \nthe reaction to the Court’s decision was mixed. No one, at least in the press, \ntried to say that extending the term of copyright was a good idea. We had won \nthat battle over ideas. Where the decision was praised, it was praised by papers \nthat had been skeptical of the Court’s activism in other cases. Deference was a \ngood thing, even if it left standing a silly law. But where the decision was \nattacked, it was attacked because it left standing a silly and harmful law. The \nNew York Times wrote in its editorial,",

        "The image that will always stick in my head is that evoked by the quote from \n/The New York Times. That grand experiment we call the public domain is \nover? When I can make light of it, I think, Honey, I shrunk the Constitution. \nBut I can rarely make light of it. We had in our Constitution a commitment to \nfree culture.

This was a particularly long flight to my \nleast favorite city. The drive into the city from Dulles was delayed because of \ntraffic, so I opened up my computer and wrote an op-ed piece.",
        "It was an act of contrition. During the whole of the flight from San Francisco \nto Washington, I had heard over and over again in my head the same advice from \nDon Ayer: You need to make them see why it is important. And alternating with \nthat command was the question of Justice Kennedy: For all these years the act \nhas impeded progress in science and the useful arts. I just don’t see any \nempirical evidence for that. And so, having failed in the argument of \nconstitutional principle, finally, I turned to an argument of politics.",
        "The New York Times published the piece. In it, I proposed a simple fix: Fifty \nyears after a work has been published, the copyright owner would be required to \nregister the work and pay a small fee. If he paid the fee, he got the benefit of \nthe full term of copyright. If he did not, the work passed into the public \ndomain.",
        "We called this the Eldred Act, but that was just to give it a name. Eric Eldred \nwas kind enough to let his name be used once again, but as he said early on, it \nwon’t get passed unless it has another name.",
        "Or another two names. For depending upon your perspective, this is either the \nPublic Domain Enhancement Act or the Copyright Term Deregulation Act. Either \nway, the essence of the idea is clear and obvious: Remove copyright where it is \ndoing nothing except blocking access and the spread of knowledge. Leave it for \nas long as Congress allows for those works where its worth is at least $1. But \nfor everything else, let the content go.",
        "The reaction to this idea was amazingly strong. Steve Forbes endorsed it in an \neditorial. I received an avalanche of e-mail and letters expressing support. \nWhen you focus the issue on lost creativity, people can see the copyright system \nmakes no sense. As a good Republican might say, here government regulation is \nsimply getting in the way of innovation and creativity. And as a good Democrat \nmight say, here the government is blocking access and the spread of knowledge \nfor no good reason. Indeed, there is no real difference between Democrats and \nRepublicans on this issue. Anyone can recognize the stupid harm of the present \nsystem.",
        "Indeed, many recognized the obvious benefit of the registration requirement. For \none of the hardest things about the current system for people who want to \nlicense content is that there is no obvious place to look for the current \ncopyright owners. Since registration is not required, since marking content is \nnot required, since no formality at all is required, it is often impossibly hard \nto locate copyright owners to ask permission to use or license their work. This \nsystem would lower these costs, by establishing at least one registry where \ncopyright owners could be identified.",
        "As I described in chapter 10, formalities in copyright law were removed in 1976, \nwhen Congress followed the Europeans by abandoning any formal requirement before \na copyright is granted. [1] The Europeans are said to view copyright as a \nnatural right. Natural rights don’t need forms to exist. Traditions, like the \nAnglo-American tradition that required copyright owners to follow form if their \nrights were to be protected, did not, the Europeans thought, properly respect \nthe dignity of the author. My right as a creator turns on my creativity, not \nupon the special favor of the government.",
        "That’s great rhetoric. It sounds wonderfully romantic. But it is absurd \ncopyright policy. It is absurd especially for authors, because a world without \nformalities harms the creator. The ability to spread Walt Disney creativity is \ndestroyed when there is no simple way to know what’s protected and what’s not.",
        "The fight against formalities achieved its first real victory in Berlin in 1908. \nInternational copyright lawyers amended the Berne Convention in 1908, to require \ncopyright terms of life plus fifty years, as well as the abolition of copyright \nformalities. The formalities were hated because the stories of inadvertent loss \nwere increasingly common. It was as if a Charles Dickens character ran all \ncopyright offices, and the failure to dot an i or cross a t resulted in the \nloss of widows’ only income.",
        "These complaints were real and sensible. And the strictness of the formalities, \nespecially in the United States, was absurd. The law should always have ways of \nforgiving innocent mistakes. There is no reason copyright law couldn’t, as well. \nRather than abandoning formalities totally, the response in Berlin should have \nbeen to embrace a more equitable system of registration.",
        "Even that would have been resisted, however, because registration in the \nnineteenth and twentieth centuries was still expensive. It was also a hassle. \nThe abolishment of formalities promised not only to save the starving widows, \nbut also to lighten an unnecessary regulatory burden imposed upon creators.",
        "In addition to the practical complaint of authors in 1908, there was a moral \nclaim as well. There was no reason that creative property should be a second-\nclass form of property. If a carpenter builds a table, his rights over the table \ndon’t depend upon filing a form with the government. He has a property right \nover the table naturally, and he can assert that right against anyone who \nwould steal the table, whether or not he has informed the government of his \nownership of the table.",
        "This argument is correct, but its implications are misleading. For the argument \nin favor of formalities does not depend upon creative property being second-\nclass property. The argument in favor of formalities turns upon the special \nproblems that creative property presents. The law of formalities responds to the \nspecial physics of creative property, to assure that it can be efficiently and \nfairly spread.",
        "No one thinks, for example, that land is second-class property just because you \nhave to register a deed with a court if your sale of land is to be effective. \nAnd few would think a car is second-class property just because you must \nregister the car with the state and tag it with a license. In both of those \ncases, everyone sees that there is an important reason to secure registration\nboth because it makes the markets more efficient and because it better secures \nthe rights of the owner. Without a registration system for land, landowners \nwould perpetually have to guard their property. With registration, they can \nsimply point the police to a deed. Without a registration system for cars, auto \ntheft would be much easier. With a registration system, the thief has a high \nburden to sell a stolen car. A slight burden is placed on the property owner, \nbut those burdens produce a much better system of protection for property \ngenerally.",
        "It is similarly special physics that makes formalities important in copyright \nlaw. Unlike a carpenter’s table, there’s nothing in nature that makes it \nrelatively obvious who might own a particular bit of creative property. A \nrecording of Lyle Lovett’s latest album can exist in a billion places without \nanything necessarily linking it back to a particular owner. And like a car, \nthere’s no way to buy and sell creative property with confidence unless there is \nsome simple way to authenticate who is the author and what rights he has. Simple \ntransactions are destroyed in a world without formalities. Complex, expensive, \n/lawyer transactions take their place.",
        "This was the understanding of the problem with the Sonny Bono Act that we tried \nto demonstrate to the Court. This was the part it didn’t get. Because we live \nin a system without formalities, there is no way easily to build upon or use \nculture from our past. If copyright terms were, as Justice Story said they would \nbe, short, then this wouldn’t matter much. For fourteen years, under the \nframers’ system, a work would be presumptively controlled. After fourteen years, \nit would be presumptively uncontrolled.",
        "But now that copyrights can be just about a century long, the inability to know \nwhat is protected and what is not protected becomes a huge and obvious burden on \nthe creative process. If the only way a library can offer an Internet exhibit \nabout the New Deal is to hire a lawyer to clear the rights to every image and \nsound, then the copyright system is burdening creativity in a way that has never \nbeen seen before because there are no formalities.",
        "The Eldred Act was designed to respond to exactly this problem. If it is worth \n$1 to you, then register your work and you can get the longer term. Others will \nknow how to contact you and, therefore, how to get your permission if they want \nto use your work. And you will get the benefit of an extended copyright term.",
        "If it isn’t worth it to you to register to get the benefit of an extended term, \nthen it shouldn’t be worth it for the government to defend your monopoly over \nthat work either. The work should pass into the public domain where anyone can \ncopy it, or build archives with it, or create a movie based on it. It should \nbecome free if it is not worth $1 to you.",
        "Some worry about the burden on authors. Won’t the burden of registering the work \nmean that the $1 is really misleading? Isn’t the hassle worth more than $1? \nIsn’t that the real problem with registration?",
        "It is. The hassle is terrible. The system that exists now is awful. I completely \nagree that the Copyright Office has done a terrible job (no doubt because they \nare terribly funded) in enabling simple and cheap registrations. Any real \nsolution to the problem of formalities must address the real problem of \n/governments standing at the core of any system of formalities. In this book, I \noffer such a solution. That solution essentially remakes the Copyright Office. \nFor now, assume it was Amazon that ran the registration system. Assume it was \none-click registration. The Eldred Act would propose a simple, one-click \nregistration fifty years after a work was published. Based upon historical data, \nthat system would move up to 98 percent of commercial work, commercial work that \nno longer had a commercial life, into the public domain within fifty years. What \ndo you think?",
        "When Steve Forbes endorsed the idea, some in Washington began to pay attention. \nMany people contacted me pointing to representatives who might be willing to \nintroduce the Eldred Act. And I had a few who directly suggested that they might \nbe willing to take the first step.",
        "One representative, Zoe Lofgren of California, went so far as to get the bill \ndrafted. The draft solved any problem with international law. It imposed the \nsimplest requirement upon copyright owners possible. In May 2003, it looked as \nif the bill would be introduced. On May 16, I posted on the Eldred Act blog, we \nare close. There was a general reaction in the blog community that something \ngood might happen here.",
        "But at this stage, the lobbyists began to intervene. Jack Valenti and the MPAA \ngeneral counsel came to the congresswoman’s office to give the view of the MPAA. \nAided by his lawyer, as Valenti told me, Valenti informed the congresswoman that \nthe MPAA would oppose the Eldred Act. The reasons are embarrassingly thin. More \nimportantly, their thinness shows something clear about what this debate is \nreally about.",
        "The MPAA argued first that Congress had firmly rejected the central concept in \nthe proposed billthat copyrights be renewed. That was true, but irrelevant, as \nCongress’s firm rejection had occurred long before the Internet made \nsubsequent uses much more likely. Second, they argued that the proposal would \nharm poor copyright ownersapparently those who could not afford the $1 fee. \nThird, they argued that Congress had determined that extending a copyright term \nwould encourage restoration work. Maybe in the case of the small percentage of \nwork covered by copyright law that is still commercially valuable, but again \nthis was irrelevant, as the proposal would not cut off the extended term unless \nthe $1 fee was not paid. Fourth, the MPAA argued that the bill would impose \nenormous costs, since a registration system is not free. True enough, but \nthose costs are certainly less than the costs of clearing the rights for a \ncopyright whose owner is not known. Fifth, they worried about the risks if the \ncopyright to a story underlying a film were to pass into the public domain. But \nwhat risk is that? If it is in the public domain, then the film is a valid \nderivative use.",
        "Finally, the MPAA argued that existing law enabled copyright owners to do this \nif they wanted. But the whole point is that there are thousands of copyright \nowners who don’t even know they have a copyright to give. Whether they are free \nto give away their copyright or nota controversial claim in any caseunless \nthey know about a copyright, they’re not likely to.",
        "At the beginning of this book, I told two stories about the law reacting to \nchanges in technology. In the one, common sense prevailed. In the other, common \nsense was delayed. The difference between the two stories was the power of the \noppositionthe power of the side that fought to defend the status quo. In both \ncases, a new technology threatened old interests. But in only one case did those \ninterest’s have the power to protect themselves against this new competitive \nthreat.",
        "I used these two cases as a way to frame the war that this book has been about. \nFor here, too, a new technology is forcing the law to react. And here, too, we \nshould ask, is the law following or resisting common sense? If common sense \nsupports the law, what explains this common sense?",
        "When the issue is piracy, it is right for the law to back the copyright owners. \nThe commercial piracy that I described is wrong and harmful, and the law should \nwork to eliminate it. When the issue is p2p sharing, it is easy to understand \nwhy the law backs the owners still: Much of this sharing is wrong, even if much \nis harmless. When the issue is copyright terms for the Mickey Mouses of the \nworld, it is possible still to understand why the law favors Hollywood: Most \npeople don’t recognize the reasons for limiting copyright terms; it is thus \nstill possible to see good faith within the resistance.",
        "But when the copyright owners oppose a proposal such as the Eldred Act, then, \nfinally, there is an example that lays bare the naked self-interest driving this \nwar. This act would free an extraordinary range of content that is otherwise \nunused. It wouldn’t interfere with any copyright owner’s desire to exercise \ncontinued control over his content. It would simply liberate what Kevin Kelly \ncalls the Dark Content that fills archives around the world. So when the \nwarriors oppose a change like this, we should ask one simple question:",
        "What does this industry really want?",
        "With very little effort, the warriors could protect their content. So the effort \nto block something like the Eldred Act is not really about protecting their \ncontent. The effort to block the Eldred Act is an effort to assure that nothing \nmore passes into the public domain. It is another step to assure that the public \ndomain will never compete, that there will be no use of content that is not \ncommercially controlled, and that there will be no commercial use of content \nthat doesn’t require their permission first.",
        "The opposition to the Eldred Act reveals how extreme the other side is. The most \npowerful and sexy and well loved of lobbies really has as its aim not the \nprotection of property but the rejection of a tradition. Their aim is not \nsimply to protect what is theirs. Their aim is to assure that all there is is \nwhat is theirs.",
        "It is not hard to understand why the warriors take this view. It is not hard to \nsee why it would benefit them if the competition of the public domain tied to \nthe Internet could somehow be quashed. Just as RCA feared the competition of FM, \nthey fear the competition of a public domain connected to a public that now has \nthe means to create with it and to share its own creation.",
        "What is hard to understand is why the public takes this view. It is as if the \nlaw made airplanes trespassers. The MPAA stands with the Causbys and demands \nthat their remote and useless property rights be respected, so that these remote \nand forgotten copyright holders might block the progress of others.",
        "All this seems to follow easily from this untroubled acceptance of the \nproperty in intellectual property. Common sense supports it, and so long as it \ndoes, the assaults will rain down upon the technologies of the Internet. The \nconsequence will be an increasing permission society. The past can be \ncultivated only if you can identify the owner and gain permission to build upon \nhis work. The future will be controlled by this dead (and often unfindable) hand \nof the past.",
        "There are more than 35 million people with the AIDS virus worldwide. Twenty-five \nmillion of them live in sub-Saharan Africa. Seventeen million have already died. \nSeventeen million Africans is proportional percentage-wise to seven million \nAmericans. More importantly, it is seventeen million Africans.",
        "There is no cure for AIDS, but there are drugs to slow its progression. These \nantiretroviral therapies are still experimental, but they have already had a \ndramatic effect. In the United States, AIDS patients who regularly take a \ncocktail of these drugs increase their life expectancy by ten to twenty years. \nFor some, the drugs make the disease almost invisible.",
        "These drugs are expensive. When they were first introduced in the United States, \nthey cost between $10,000 and $15,000 per person per year. Today, some cost \n$25,000 per year. At these prices, of course, no African nation can afford the \ndrugs for the vast majority of its population: $15,000 is thirty times the per \ncapita gross national product of Zimbabwe. At these prices, the drugs are \ntotally unavailable. [1]",
        "These prices are not high because the ingredients of the drugs are expensive. \nThese prices are high because the drugs are protected by patents. The drug \ncompanies that produced these life-saving mixes enjoy at least a twenty-year \nmonopoly for their inventions. They use that monopoly power to extract the most \nthey can from the market. That power is in turn used to keep the prices high.",
        "There are many who are skeptical of patents, especially drug patents. I am not. \nIndeed, of all the areas of research that might be supported by patents, drug \nresearch is, in my view, the clearest case where patents are needed. The patent \ngives the drug company some assurance that if it is successful in inventing a \nnew drug to treat a disease, it will be able to earn back its investment and \nmore. This is socially an extremely valuable incentive. I am the last person who \nwould argue that the law should abolish it, at least without other changes.",
        "But it is one thing to support patents, even drug patents. It is another thing \nto determine how best to deal with a crisis. And as African leaders began to \nrecognize the devastation that AIDS was bringing, they started looking for ways \nto import HIV treatments at costs significantly below the market price.",
        "In 1997, South Africa tried one tack. It passed a law to allow the importation \nof patented medicines that had been produced or sold in another nation’s market \nwith the consent of the patent owner. For example, if the drug was sold in \nIndia, it could be imported into Africa from India. This is called parallel \nimportation, and it is generally permitted under international trade law and is \nspecifically permitted within the European Union. [2]",
        "However, the United States government opposed the bill. Indeed, more than \nopposed. As the International Intellectual Property Association characterized \nit, The U.S. government pressured South Africa ... not to permit compulsory \nlicensing or parallel imports. [3] Through the Office of the United States \nTrade Representative, the government asked South Africa to change the lawand to \nadd pressure to that request, in 1998, the USTR listed South Africa for possible \ntrade sanctions. That same year, more than forty pharmaceutical companies began \nproceedings in the South African courts to challenge the govern-ment’s actions. \nThe United States was then joined by other governments from the EU. Their claim, \nand the claim of the pharmaceutical companies, was that South Africa was \nviolating its obligations under international law by discriminating against a \nparticular kind of patentpharmaceutical patents. The demand of these \ngovernments, with the United States in the lead, was that South Africa respect \nthese patents as it respects any other patent, regardless of any effect on the \ntreatment of AIDS within South Africa. [4]",
        "We should place the intervention by the United States in context. No doubt \npatents are not the most important reason that Africans don’t have access to \ndrugs. Poverty and the total absence of an effective health care infrastructure \nmatter more. But whether patents are the most important reason or not, the price \nof drugs has an effect on their demand, and patents affect price. And so, \nwhether massive or marginal, there was an effect from our government’s \nintervention to stop the flow of medications into Africa.",
        "By stopping the flow of HIV treatment into Africa, the United States government \nwas not saving drugs for United States citizens. This is not like wheat (if they \neat it, we can’t); instead, the flow that the United States intervened to stop \nwas, in effect, a flow of knowledge: information about how to take chemicals \nthat exist within Africa, and turn those chemicals into drugs that would save 15 \nto 30 million lives.",
        "Nor was the intervention by the United States going to protect the profits of \nUnited States drug companiesat least, not substantially. It was not as if these \ncountries were in the position to buy the drugs for the prices the drug \ncompanies were charging. Again, the Africans are wildly too poor to afford these \ndrugs at the offered prices. Stopping the parallel import of these drugs would \nnot substantially increase the sales by U.S. companies.",
        "Instead, the argument in favor of restricting this flow of information, which \nwas needed to save the lives of millions, was an argument about the sanctity of \nproperty. [5] It was because intellectual property would be violated that \nthese drugs should not flow into Africa. It was a principle about the importance \nof intellectual property that led these government actors to intervene against \nthe South African response to AIDS.",
        "Now just step back for a moment. There will be a time thirty years from now when \nour children look back at us and ask, how could we have let this happen? How \ncould we allow a policy to be pursued whose direct cost would be to speed the \ndeath of 15 to 30 million Africans, and whose only real benefit would be to \nuphold the sanctity of an idea? What possible justification could there ever \nbe for a policy that results in so many deaths? What exactly is the insanity \nthat would allow so many to die for such an abstraction?",
        "Some blame the drug companies. I don’t. They are corporations. Their managers \nare ordered by law to make money for the corporation. They push a certain patent \npolicy not because of ideals, but because it is the policy that makes them the \nmost money. And it only makes them the most money because of a certain \ncorruption within our political systema corruption the drug companies are \ncertainly not responsible for.",
        "The corruption is our own politicians’ failure of integrity. For the drug \ncompanies would lovethey say, and I believe themto sell their drugs as cheaply \nas they can to countries in Africa and elsewhere. There are issues they’d have \nto resolve to make sure the drugs didn’t get back into the United States, but \nthose are mere problems of technology. They could be overcome.",
        "A different problem, however, could not be overcome. This is the fear of the \ngrandstanding politician who would call the presidents of the drug companies \nbefore a Senate or House hearing, and ask, How is it you can sell this HIV drug \nin Africa for only $1 a pill, but the same drug would cost an American $1,500? \nBecause there is no sound bite” answer to that question, its effect would be to \ninduce regulation of prices in America. The drug companies thus avoid this \nspiral by avoiding the first step. They reinforce the idea that property should \nbe sacred. They adopt a rational strategy in an irrational context, with the \nunintended consequence that perhaps millions die. And that rational strategy \nthus becomes framed in terms of this idealthe sanctity of an idea called \nintellectual property.",
        "So when the common sense of your child confronts you, what will you say? When \nthe common sense of a generation finally revolts against what we have done, how \nwill we justify what we have done? What is the argument?",
        "A sensible patent policy could endorse and strongly support the patent system \nwithout having to reach everyone everywhere in exactly the same way. Just as a \nsensible copyright policy could endorse and strongly support a copyright system \nwithout having to regulate the spread of culture perfectly and forever, a \nsensible patent policy could endorse and strongly support a patent system \nwithout having to block the spread of drugs to a country not rich enough to \nafford market prices in any case. A sensible policy, in other words, could be a \nbalanced policy. For most of our history, both copyright and patent policies \nwere balanced in just this sense.",
        "But we as a culture have lost this sense of balance. We have lost the critical \neye that helps us see the difference between truth and extremism. A certain \nproperty fundamentalism, having no connection to our tradition, now reigns in \nthis culturebizarrely, and with consequences more grave to the spread of ideas \nand culture than almost any other single policy decision that we as a democracy \nwill make.",
        "A simple idea blinds us, and under the cover of darkness, much happens that most \nof us would reject if any of us looked. So uncritically do we accept the idea of \nproperty in ideas that we don’t even notice how monstrous it is to deny ideas to \na people who are dying without them. So uncritically do we accept the idea of \nproperty in culture that we don’t even question when the control of that \nproperty removes our ability, as a people, to develop our culture \ndemocratically. Blindness becomes our common sense. And the challenge for anyone \nwho would reclaim the right to cultivate our culture is to find a way to make \nthis common sense open its eyes.",
        "So far, common sense sleeps. There is no revolt. Common sense does not yet see \nwhat there could be to revolt about. The extremism that now dominates this \ndebate fits with ideas that seem natural, and that fit is reinforced by the RCAs \nof our day. They wage a frantic war to fight piracy, and devastate a culture \nfor creativity. They defend the idea of creative property, while transforming \nreal creators into modern-day sharecroppers. They are insulted by the idea that \nrights should be balanced, even though each of the major players in this content \nwar was itself a beneficiary of a more balanced ideal. The hypocrisy reeks. Yet \nin a city like Washington, hypocrisy is not even noticed. Powerful lobbies, \ncomplex issues, and MTV attention spans produce the perfect storm for free \nculture.",
        "In August 2003, a fight broke out in the United States about a decision by the \nWorld Intellectual Property Organization to cancel a meeting. [6] At the request \nof a wide range of interests, WIPO had decided to hold a meeting to discuss \nopen and collaborative projects to create public goods. These are projects \nthat have been successful in producing public goods without relying exclusively \nupon a proprietary use of intellectual property. Examples include the Internet \nand the World Wide Web, both of which were developed on the basis of protocols \nin the public domain. It included an emerging trend to support open academic \njournals, including the Public Library of Science project that I describe in the \nAfterword. It included a project to develop single nucleotide polymorphisms \n(SNPs), which are thought to have great significance in biomedical research. \n(That nonprofit project comprised a consortium of the Wellcome Trust and \npharmaceutical and technological companies, including Amersham Biosciences, \nAstraZeneca, Aventis, Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Hoffmann-La Roche, Glaxo-\nSmithKline, IBM, Motorola, Novartis, Pfizer, and Searle.) It included the Global \nPositioning System, which Ronald Reagan set free in the early 1980s. And it \nincluded open source and free software.",
        "The aim of the meeting was to consider this wide range of projects from one \ncommon perspective: that none of these projects relied upon intellectual \nproperty extremism. Instead, in all of them, intellectual property was balanced \nby agreements to keep access open or to impose limitations on the way in which \nproprietary claims might be used.",
        "From the perspective of this book, then, the conference was ideal. [7] The \nprojects within its scope included both commercial and noncommercial work. They \nprimarily involved science, but from many perspectives. And WIPO was an ideal \nvenue for this discussion, since WIPO is the preeminent international body \ndealing with intellectual property issues.",
        "Indeed, I was once publicly scolded for not recognizing this fact about WIPO. In \nFebruary 2003, I delivered a keynote address to a preparatory conference for the \nWorld Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). At a press conference before the \naddress, I was asked what I would say. I responded that I would be talking a \nlittle about the importance of balance in intellectual property for the \ndevelopment of an information society. The moderator for the event then promptly \ninterrupted to inform me and the assembled reporters that no question about \nintellectual property would be discussed by WSIS, since those questions were the \nexclusive domain of WIPO. In the talk that I had prepared, I had actually made \nthe issue of intellectual property relatively minor. But after this astonishing \nstatement, I made intellectual property the sole focus of my talk. There was no \nway to talk about an Information Society unless one also talked about the \nrange of information and culture that would be free. My talk did not make my \nimmoderate moderator very happy. And she was no doubt correct that the scope of \nintellectual property protections was ordinarily the stuff of WIPO. But in my \nview, there couldn’t be too much of a conversation about how much intellectual \nproperty is needed, since in my view, the very idea of balance in intellectual \nproperty had been lost.",
        "So whether or not WSIS can discuss balance in intellectual property, I had \nthought it was taken for granted that WIPO could and should. And thus the \nmeeting about open and collaborative projects to create public goods seemed \nperfectly appropriate within the WIPO agenda.",
        "But there is one project within that list that is highly controversial, at least \namong lobbyists. That project is open source and free software. Microsoft in \nparticular is wary of discussion of the subject. From its perspective, a \nconference to discuss open source and free software would be like a conference \nto discuss Apple’s operating system. Both open source and free software compete \nwith Microsoft’s software. And internationally, many governments have begun to \nexplore requirements that they use open source or free software, rather than \nproprietary software, for their own internal uses.",
        "I don’t mean to enter that debate here. It is important only to make clear that \nthe distinction is not between commercial and noncommercial software. There are \nmany important companies that depend fundamentally upon open source and free \nsoftware, IBM being the most prominent. IBM is increasingly shifting its focus \nto the GNU/Linux operating system, the most famous bit of free softwareand \nIBM is emphatically a commercial entity. Thus, to support open source and free \nsoftware is not to oppose commercial entities. It is, instead, to support a \nmode of software development that is different from Microsoft’s. [8]",
        "More important for our purposes, to support open source and free software is \nnot to oppose copyright. Open source and free software” is not software in the \npublic domain. Instead, like Microsoft’s software, the copyright owners of free \nand open source software insist quite strongly that the terms of their software \nlicense be respected by adopters of free and open source software. The terms of \nthat license are no doubt different from the terms of a proprietary software \nlicense. Free software licensed under the General Public License (GPL), for \nexample, requires that the source code for the software be made available by \nanyone who modifies and redistributes the software. But that requirement is \neffective only if copyright governs software. If copyright did not govern \nsoftware, then free software could not impose the same kind of requirements on \nits adopters. It thus depends upon copyright law just as Microsoft does.",
        "It is therefore understandable that as a proprietary software developer, \nMicrosoft would oppose this WIPO meeting, and understandable that it would use \nits lobbyists to get the United States government to oppose it, as well. And \nindeed, that is just what was reported to have happened. According to Jonathan \nKrim of the Washington Post, Microsoft’s lobbyists succeeded in getting the \nUnited States government to veto the meeting. [9] And without U.S. backing, the \nmeeting was canceled.",
        "I don’t blame Microsoft for doing what it can to advance its own interests, \nconsistent with the law. And lobbying governments is plainly consistent with the \nlaw. There was nothing surprising about its lobbying here, and nothing terribly \nsurprising about the most powerful software producer in the United States having \nsucceeded in its lobbying efforts.",
        "What was surprising was the United States government’s reason for opposing the \nmeeting. Again, as reported by Krim, Lois Boland, acting director of \ninternational relations for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, explained that \nopen-source software runs counter to the mission of WIPO, which is to promote \nintellectual-property rights. She is quoted as saying, To hold a meeting which \nhas as its purpose to disclaim or waive such rights seems to us to be contrary \nto the goals of WIPO.",
        "These statements are astonishing on a number of levels.",
        "First, they are just flat wrong. As I described, most open source and free \nsoftware relies fundamentally upon the intellectual property right called \ncopyright. Without it, restrictions imposed by those licenses wouldn’t work. \nThus, to say it runs counter to the mission of promoting intellectual property \nrights reveals an extraordinary gap in under- standingthe sort of mistake that \nis excusable in a first-year law student, but an embarrassment from a high \ngovernment official dealing with intellectual property issues.",
        "Second, who ever said that WIPO’s exclusive aim was to promote” intellectual \nproperty maximally? As I had been scolded at the preparatory conference of WSIS, \nWIPO is to consider not only how best to protect intellectual property, but also \nwhat the best balance of intellectual property is. As every economist and lawyer \nknows, the hard question in intellectual property law is to find that balance. \nBut that there should be limits is, I had thought, uncontested. One wants to ask \nMs. Boland, are generic drugs (drugs based on drugs whose patent has expired) \ncontrary to the WIPO mission? Does the public domain weaken intellectual \nproperty? Would it have been better if the protocols of the Internet had been \npatented?",
        "Third, even if one believed that the purpose of WIPO was to maximize \nintellectual property rights, in our tradition, intellectual property rights are \nheld by individuals and corporations. They get to decide what to do with those \nrights because, again, they are their rights. If they want to waive or \ndisclaim their rights, that is, within our tradition, totally appropriate. \nWhen Bill Gates gives away more than $20 billion to do good in the world, that \nis not inconsistent with the objectives of the property system. That is, on the \ncontrary, just what a property system is supposed to be about: giving \nindividuals the right to decide what to do with their property.",
        "When Ms. Boland says that there is something wrong with a meeting which has as \nits purpose to disclaim or waive such rights, she’s saying that WIPO has an \ninterest in interfering with the choices of the individuals who own intellectual \nproperty rights. That somehow, WIPO’s objective should be to stop an individual \nfrom waiving or dis-claiming an intellectual property right. That the \ninterest of WIPO is not just that intellectual property rights be maximized, but \nthat they also should be exercised in the most extreme and restrictive way \npossible.",
        "There is a history of just such a property system that is well known in the \nAnglo-American tradition. It is called feudalism. Under feudalism, not only \nwas property held by a relatively small number of individuals and entities. And \nnot only were the rights that ran with that property powerful and extensive. But \nthe feudal system had a strong interest in assuring that property holders within \nthat system not weaken feudalism by liberating people or property within their \ncontrol to the free market. Feudalism depended upon maximum control and \nconcentration. It fought any freedom that might interfere with that control.",
        "As Peter Drahos and John Braithwaite relate, this is precisely the choice we are \nnow making about intellectual property. [10] We will have an information \nsociety. That much is certain. Our only choice now is whether that information \nsociety will be free or feudal. The trend is toward the feudal.",
        "When this battle broke, I blogged it. A spirited debate within the comment \nsection ensued. Ms. Boland had a number of supporters who tried to show why her \ncomments made sense. But there was one comment that was particularly depressing \nfor me. An anonymous poster wrote,",
        "George, you misunderstand Lessig: He’s only talking about the world as it \nshould be (the goal of WIPO, and the goal of any government, should be to \npromote the right balance of intellectual- property rights, not simply to \npromote intellectual property rights”), not as it is. If we were talking about \nthe world as it is, then of course Boland didn’t say anything wrong. But in the \nworld as Lessig would have it, then of course she did. Always pay attention to \nthe distinction between Lessig’s world and ours.",
        "I missed the irony the first time I read it. I read it quickly and thought the \nposter was supporting the idea that seeking balance was what our government \nshould be doing. (Of course, my criticism of Ms. Boland was not about whether \nshe was seeking balance or not; my criticism was that her comments betrayed a \nfirst-year law student’s mistake. I have no illusion about the extremism of our \ngovernment, whether Republican or Democrat. My only illusion apparently is about \nwhether our government should speak the truth or not.)",
        "Obviously, however, the poster was not supporting that idea. Instead, the poster \nwas ridiculing the very idea that in the real world, the goal of a government \nshould be to promote the right balance of intellectual property. That was \nobviously silly to him. And it obviously betrayed, he believed, my own silly \nutopianism. Typical for an academic, the poster might well have continued.",
        "I understand criticism of academic utopianism. I think utopianism is silly, too, \nand I’d be the first to poke fun at the absurdly unrealistic ideals of academics \nthroughout history (and not just in our own country’s history).",
        "But when it has become silly to suppose that the role of our government should \nbe to seek balance, then count me with the silly, for that means that this has \nbecome quite serious indeed. If it should be obvious to everyone that the \ngovernment does not seek balance, that the government is simply the tool of the \nmost powerful lobbyists, that the idea of holding the government to a different \nstandard is absurd, that the idea of demanding of the government that it speak \ntruth and not lies is just naïve, then who have we, the most powerful democracy \nin the world, become?",
        "It might be crazy to expect a high government official to speak the truth. It \nmight be crazy to believe that government policy will be something more than the \nhandmaiden of the most powerful interests. It might be crazy to argue that we \nshould preserve a tradition that has been part of our tradition for most of our \nhistoryfree culture.",
        "If this is crazy, then let there be more crazies. Soon.",
        "There are moments of hope in this struggle. And moments that surprise. When the \nFCC was considering relaxing ownership rules, which would thereby further \nincrease the concentration in media ownership, an extraordinary bipartisan \ncoalition formed to fight this change. For perhaps the first time in history, \ninterests as diverse as the NRA, the ACLU, Moveon.org, William Safire, Ted \nTurner, and CodePink Women for Peace organized to oppose this change in FCC \npolicy. An astonishing 700,000 letters were sent to the FCC, demanding more \nhearings and a different result.",
        "This activism did not stop the FCC, but soon after, a broad coalition in the \nSenate voted to reverse the FCC decision. The hostile hearings leading up to \nthat vote revealed just how powerful this movement had become. There was no \nsubstantial support for the FCC’s decision, and there was broad and sustained \nsupport for fighting further concentration in the media.",
        "But even this movement misses an important piece of the puzzle. Largeness as \nsuch is not bad. Freedom is not threatened just because some become very rich, \nor because there are only a handful of big players. The poor quality of Big Macs \nor Quarter Pounders does not mean that you can’t get a good hamburger from \nsomewhere else.",
        "The danger in media concentration comes not from the concentration, but instead \nfrom the feudalism that this concentration, tied to the change in copyright, \nproduces. It is not just that there are a few powerful companies that control an \never expanding slice of the media. It is that this concentration can call upon \nan equally bloated range of rightsproperty rights of a historically extreme \nformthat makes their bigness bad.",
        "It is therefore significant that so many would rally to demand competition and \nincreased diversity. Still, if the rally is understood as being about bigness \nalone, it is not terribly surprising. We Americans have a long history of \nfighting big, wisely or not. That we could be motivated to fight big again \nis not something new.",
        "It would be something new, and something very important, if an equal number \ncould be rallied to fight the increasing extremism built within the idea of \nintellectual property. Not because balance is alien to our tradition; indeed, \nas I’ve argued, balance is our tradition. But because the muscle to think \ncritically about the scope of anything called property is not well exercised \nwithin this tradition anymore.",
        "If we were Achilles, this would be our heel. This would be the place of our \ntragedy.",
        "As I write these final words, the news is filled with stories about the RIAA \nlawsuits against almost three hundred individuals.

[13] An \ninsider from Hollywoodwho insists he must remain anonymousreports an amazing \nconversation with these studio guys. They’ve got extraordinary [old] content \nthat they’d love to use but can’t because they can’t begin to clear the rights. \nThey’ve got scores of kids who could do amazing things with the content, but it \nwould take scores of lawyers to clean it first. Congressmen are talking about \ndeputizing computer viruses to bring down computers thought to violate the law. \nUniversities are threatening expulsion for kids who use a computer to share \ncontent.",

        "I divide this map into two parts: that which anyone can do now, and that which \nrequires the help of lawmakers. If there is one lesson that we can draw from the \nhistory of remaking common sense, it is that it requires remaking how many \npeople think about the very same issue.",
        "That means this movement must begin in the streets. It must recruit a \nsignificant number of parents, teachers, librarians, creators, authors, \nmusicians, filmmakers, scientistsall to tell this story in their own words, and \nto tell their neighbors why this battle is so important.",
        "Once this movement has its effect in the streets, it has some hope of having an \neffect in Washington. We are still a democracy. What people think matters. Not \nas much as it should, at least when an RCA stands opposed, but still, it \nmatters. And thus, in the second part below, I sketch changes that Congress \ncould make to better secure a free culture.",
        "Common sense is with the copyright warriors because the debate so far has been \nframed at the extremesas a grand either/or: either property or anarchy, either \ntotal control or artists won’t be paid. If that really is the choice, then the \nwarriors should win.",
        "The mistake here is the error of the excluded middle. There are extremes in this \ndebate, but the extremes are not all that there is. There are those who believe \nin maximal copyrightAll Rights Reservedand those who reject copyrightNo \nRights Reserved. The All Rights Reserved sorts believe that you should ask \npermission before you use a copyrighted work in any way. The No Rights \nReserved sorts believe you should be able to do with content as you wish, \nregardless of whether you have permission or not.",
        "When the Internet was first born, its initial architecture effectively tilted in \nthe no rights reserved direction. Content could be copied perfectly and \ncheaply; rights could not easily be controlled. Thus, regardless of anyone’s \ndesire, the effective regime of copyright under the original design of the \nInternet was no rights reserved. Content was taken regardless of the rights. \nAny rights were effectively unprotected.",
        "This initial character produced a reaction (opposite, but not quite equal) by \ncopyright owners. That reaction has been the topic of this book. Through \nlegislation, litigation, and changes to the network’s design, copyright holders \nhave been able to change the essential character of the environment of the \noriginal Internet. If the original architecture made the effective default no \nrights reserved, the future architecture will make the effective default all \nrights reserved. The architecture and law that surround the Internet’s design \nwill increasingly produce an environment where all use of content requires \npermission. The cut and paste world that defines the Internet today will \nbecome a get permission to cut and paste world that is a creator’s nightmare.",
        "What’s needed is a way to say something in the middleneither all rights \nreserved nor no rights reserved but some rights reservedand thus a way to \nrespect copyrights but enable creators to free content as they see fit.

        "Rebuilding Freedoms Previously Presumed: Examples",
        "If you step back from the battle I’ve been describing here, you will recognize \nthis problem from other contexts. Think about privacy. Before the Internet, most \nof us didn’t have to worry much about data about our lives that we broadcast to \nthe world. If you walked into a bookstore and browsed through some of the works \nof Karl Marx, you didn’t need to worry about explaining your browsing habits to \nyour neighbors or boss. The privacy of your browsing habits was assured.",
        "What made it assured?",
        "Well, if we think in terms of the modalities I described in chapter 10, your \nprivacy was assured because of an inefficient architecture for gathering data \nand hence a market constraint (cost) on anyone who wanted to gather that data. \nIf you were a suspected spy for North Korea, working for the CIA, no doubt your \nprivacy would not be assured. But that’s because the CIA would (we hope) find it \nvaluable enough to spend the thousands required to track you. But for most of us \n(again, we can hope), spying doesn’t pay. The highly inefficient architecture of \nreal space means we all enjoy a fairly robust amount of privacy. That privacy is \nguaranteed to us by friction. Not by law (there is no law protecting privacy \nin public places), and in many places, not by norms (snooping and gossip are \njust fun), but instead, by the costs that friction imposes on anyone who would \nwant to spy.",
        "Enter the Internet, where the cost of tracking browsing in particular has become \nquite tiny. If you’re a customer at Amazon, then as you browse the pages, Amazon \ncollects the data about what you’ve looked at. You know this because at the side \nof the page, there’s a list of recently viewed pages. Now, because of the \narchitecture of the Net and the function of cookies on the Net, it is easier to \ncollect the data than not. The friction has disappeared, and hence any privacy” \nprotected by the friction disappears, too.",
        "Amazon, of course, is not the problem. But we might begin to worry about \nlibraries. If you’re one of those crazy lefties who thinks that people should \nhave the right to browse in a library without the government knowing which \nbooks you look at (I’m one of those lefties, too), then this change in the \ntechnology of monitoring might concern you. If it becomes simple to gather and \nsort who does what in electronic spaces, then the friction-induced privacy of \nyesterday disappears.",
        "It is this reality that explains the push of many to define privacy” on the \nInternet. It is the recognition that technology can remove what friction before \ngave us that leads many to push for laws to do what friction did. [1] And \nwhether you’re in favor of those laws or not, it is the pattern that is \nimportant here. We must take affirmative steps to secure a kind of freedom that \nwas passively provided before. A change in technology now forces those who \nbelieve in privacy to affirmatively act where, before, privacy was given by \ndefault.",
        "A similar story could be told about the birth of the free software movement. \nWhen computers with software were first made available commercially, the \nsoftwareboth the source code and the binarieswas free. You couldn’t run a \nprogram written for a Data General machine on an IBM machine, so Data General \nand IBM didn’t care much about controlling their software.",
        "That was the world Richard Stallman was born into, and while he was a researcher \nat MIT, he grew to love the community that developed when one was free to \nexplore and tinker with the software that ran on machines. Being a smart sort \nhimself, and a talented programmer, Stallman grew to depend upon the freedom to \nadd to or modify other people’s work.",
        "In an academic setting, at least, that’s not a terribly radical idea. In a math \ndepartment, anyone would be free to tinker with a proof that someone offered. If \nyou thought you had a better way to prove a theorem, you could take what someone \nelse did and change it. In a classics department, if you believed a colleague’s \ntranslation of a recently discovered text was flawed, you were free to improve \nit. Thus, to Stallman, it seemed obvious that you should be free to tinker with \nand improve the code that ran a machine. This, too, was knowledge. Why shouldn’t \nit be open for criticism like anything else?",
        "No one answered that question. Instead, the architecture of revenue for \ncomputing changed. As it became possible to import programs from one system to \nanother, it became economically attractive (at least in the view of some) to \nhide the code of your program. So, too, as companies started selling peripherals \nfor mainframe systems. If I could just take your printer driver and copy it, \nthen that would make it easier for me to sell a printer to the market than it \nwas for you.",
        "Thus, the practice of proprietary code began to spread, and by the early 1980s, \nStallman found himself surrounded by proprietary code. The world of free \nsoftware had been erased by a change in the economics of computing. And as he \nbelieved, if he did nothing about it, then the freedom to change and share \nsoftware would be fundamentally weakened.",
        "Therefore, in 1984, Stallman began a project to build a free operating system, \nso that at least a strain of free software would survive. That was the birth of \nthe GNU project, into which Linus Torvalds’s Linux kernel was added to produce \nthe GNU/Linux operating system.",
        "Stallman’s technique was to use copyright law to build a world of software that \nmust be kept free. Software licensed under the Free Software Foundation’s GPL \ncannot be modified and distributed unless the source code for that software is \nmade available as well. Thus, anyone building upon GPL’d software would have to \nmake their buildings free as well. This would assure, Stallman believed, that an \necology of code would develop that remained free for others to build upon. His \nfundamental goal was freedom; innovative creative code was a byproduct.",
        "Stallman was thus doing for software what privacy advocates now do for privacy. \nHe was seeking a way to rebuild a kind of freedom that was taken for granted \nbefore. Through the affirmative use of licenses that bind copyrighted code, \nStallman was affirmatively reclaiming a space where free software would survive. \nHe was actively protecting what before had been passively guaranteed.",
        "Finally, consider a very recent example that more directly resonates with the \nstory of this book. This is the shift in the way academic and scientific \njournals are produced.",
        "As digital technologies develop, it is becoming obvious to many that printing \nthousands of copies of journals every month and sending them to libraries is \nperhaps not the most efficient way to distribute knowledge. Instead, journals \nare increasingly becoming electronic, and libraries and their users are given \naccess to these electronic journals through password-protected sites. Something \nsimilar to this has been happening in law for almost thirty years: Lexis and \nWestlaw have had electronic versions of case reports available to subscribers to \ntheir service. Although a Supreme Court opinion is not copyrighted, and anyone \nis free to go to a library and read it, Lexis and Westlaw are also free to \ncharge users for the privilege of gaining access to that Supreme Court opinion \nthrough their respective services.",
        "There’s nothing wrong in general with this, and indeed, the ability to charge \nfor access to even public domain materials is a good incentive for people to \ndevelop new and innovative ways to spread knowledge. The law has agreed, which \nis why Lexis and Westlaw have been allowed to flourish. And if there’s nothing \nwrong with selling the public domain, then there could be nothing wrong, in \nprinciple, with selling access to material that is not in the public domain.",
        "But what if the only way to get access to social and scientific data was through \nproprietary services? What if no one had the ability to browse this data except \nby paying for a subscription?",
        "As many are beginning to notice, this is increasingly the reality with \nscientific journals. When these journals were distributed in paper form, \nlibraries could make the journals available to anyone who had access to the \nlibrary. Thus, patients with cancer could become cancer experts because the \nlibrary gave them access. Or patients trying to understand the risks of a \ncertain treatment could research those risks by reading all available articles \nabout that treatment. This freedom was therefore a function of the institution \nof libraries (norms) and the technology of paper journals (architecture)namely, \nthat it was very hard to control access to a paper journal.",
        "As journals become electronic, however, the publishers are demanding that \nlibraries not give the general public access to the journals. This means that \nthe freedoms provided by print journals in public libraries begin to disappear. \nThus, as with privacy and with software, a changing technology and market shrink \na freedom taken for granted before.",
        "This shrinking freedom has led many to take affirmative steps to restore the \nfreedom that has been lost. The Public Library of Science (PLoS), for example, \nis a nonprofit corporation dedicated to making scientific research available to \nanyone with a Web connection. Authors of scientific work submit that work to the \nPublic Library of Science. That work is then subject to peer review. If \naccepted, the work is then deposited in a public, electronic archive and made \npermanently available for free. PLoS also sells a print version of its work, but \nthe copyright for the print journal does not inhibit the right of anyone to \nredistribute the work for free.",
        "This is one of many such efforts to restore a freedom taken for granted before, \nbut now threatened by changing technology and markets. There’s no doubt that \nthis alternative competes with the traditional publishers and their efforts to \nmake money from the exclusive distribution of content. But competition in our \ntradition is presumptively a goodespecially when it helps spread knowledge and \nscience.",
        "The same strategy could be applied to culture, as a response to the increasing \ncontrol effected through law and technology.",
        "Enter the Creative Commons. The Creative Commons is a nonprofit corporation \nestablished in Massachusetts, but with its home at Stanford University. Its aim \nis to build a layer of reasonable copyright on top of the extremes that now \nreign. It does this by making it easy for people to build upon other people’s \nwork, by making it simple for creators to express the freedom for others to take \nand build upon their work. Simple tags, tied to human-readable descriptions, \ntied to bullet-proof licenses, make this possible.",
        "Simplewhich means without a middleman, or without a lawyer. By developing a \nfree set of licenses that people can attach to their content, Creative Commons \naims to mark a range of content that can easily, and reliably, be built upon. \nThese tags are then linked to machine-readable versions of the license that \nenable computers automatically to identify content that can easily be shared. \nThese three expressions togethera legal license, a human-readable description, \nand machine-readable tagsconstitute a Creative Commons license. A Creative \nCommons license constitutes a grant of freedom to anyone who accesses the \nlicense, and more importantly, an expression of the ideal that the person \nassociated with the license believes in something different than the All or \nNo extremes. Content is marked with the CC mark, which does not mean that \ncopyright is waived, but that certain freedoms are given.",
        "These freedoms are beyond the freedoms promised by fair use. Their precise \ncontours depend upon the choices the creator makes. The creator can choose a \nlicense that permits any use, so long as attribution is given. She can choose a \nlicense that permits only noncommercial use. She can choose a license that \npermits any use so long as the same freedoms are given to other uses (share and \nshare alike”). Or any use so long as no derivative use is made. Or any use at \nall within developing nations. Or any sampling use, so long as full copies are \nnot made. Or lastly, any educational use.",
        "These choices thus establish a range of freedoms beyond the default of copyright \nlaw. They also enable freedoms that go beyond traditional fair use. And most \nimportantly, they express these freedoms in a way that subsequent users can use \nand rely upon without the need to hire a lawyer. Creative Commons thus aims to \nbuild a layer of content, governed by a layer of reasonable copyright law, that \nothers can build upon. Voluntary choice of individuals and creators will make \nthis content available. And that content will in turn enable us to rebuild a \npublic domain.",
        "This is just one project among many within the Creative Commons. And of course, \nCreative Commons is not the only organization pursuing such freedoms. But the \npoint that distinguishes the Creative Commons from many is that we are not \ninterested only in talking about a public domain or in getting legislators to \nhelp build a public domain. Our aim is to build a movement of consumers and \nproducers of content (content conducers, as attorney Mia Garlick calls them) \nwho help build the public domain and, by their work, demonstrate the importance \nof the public domain to other creativity.",
        "The aim is not to fight the All Rights Reserved sorts. The aim is to \ncomplement them. The problems that the law creates for us as a culture are \nproduced by insane and unintended consequences of laws written centuries ago, \napplied to a technology that only Jefferson could have imagined. The rules may \nwell have made sense against a background of technologies from centuries ago, \nbut they do not make sense against the background of digital technologies. New \nruleswith different freedoms, expressed in ways so that humans without lawyers \ncan use themare needed. Creative Commons gives people a way effectively to \nbegin to build those rules.",
        "Why would creators participate in giving up total control? Some participate to \nbetter spread their content. Cory Doctorow, for example, is a science fiction \nauthor. His first novel, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, was released on-\nline and for free, under a Creative Commons license, on the same day that it \nwent on sale in bookstores.",
        "Why would a publisher ever agree to this? I suspect his publisher reasoned like \nthis: There are two groups of people out there: (1) those who will buy Cory’s \nbook whether or not it’s on the Internet, and (2) those who may never hear of \nCory’s book, if it isn’t made available for free on the Internet. Some part of \n(1) will download Cory’s book instead of buying it. Call them bad-(1)s. Some \npart of (2) will download Cory’s book, like it, and then decide to buy it. Call \nthem (2)-goods. If there are more (2)-goods than bad-(1)s, the strategy of \nreleasing Cory’s book free on-line will probably increase sales of Cory’s \nbook.",
        "Indeed, the experience of his publisher clearly supports that conclusion. The \nbook’s first printing was exhausted months before the publisher had expected. \nThis first novel of a science fiction author was a total success.",
        "The idea that free content might increase the value of nonfree content was \nconfirmed by the experience of another author. Peter Wayner, who wrote a book \nabout the free software movement titled Free for All, made an electronic \nversion of his book free on-line under a Creative Commons license after the book \nwent out of print. He then monitored used book store prices for the book. As \npredicted, as the number of downloads increased, the used book price for his \nbook increased, as well.",
        "These are examples of using the Commons to better spread proprietary content. I \nbelieve that is a wonderful and common use of the Commons. There are others who \nuse Creative Commons licenses for other reasons. Many who use the sampling \nlicense do so because anything else would be hypocritical. The sampling license \nsays that others are free, for commercial or noncommercial purposes, to sample \ncontent from the licensed work; they are just not free to make full copies of \nthe licensed work available to others. This is consistent with their own art\nthey, too, sample from others. Because the legal costs of sampling are so high \n(Walter Leaphart, manager of the rap group Public Enemy, which was born sampling \nthe music of others, has stated that he does not allow Public Enemy to sample \nanymore, because the legal costs are so high [2]), these artists release into \nthe creative environment content that others can build upon, so that their form \nof creativity might grow.",
        "Finally, there are many who mark their content with a Creative Commons license \njust because they want to express to others the importance of balance in this \ndebate. If you just go along with the system as it is, you are effectively \nsaying you believe in the All Rights Reserved model. Good for you, but many do \nnot. Many believe that however appropriate that rule is for Hollywood and \nfreaks, it is not an appropriate description of how most creators view the \nrights associated with their content. The Creative Commons license expresses \nthis notion of Some Rights Reserved, and gives many the chance to say it to \nothers.",
        "In the first six months of the Creative Commons experiment, over 1 million \nobjects were licensed with these free-culture licenses. The next step is \npartnerships with middleware content providers to help them build into their \ntechnologies simple ways for users to mark their content with Creative Commons \nfreedoms. Then the next step is to watch and celebrate creators who build \ncontent based upon content set free.",
        "These are first steps to rebuilding a public domain. They are not mere \narguments; they are action. Building a public domain is the first step to \nshowing people how important that domain is to creativity and innovation. \nCreative Commons relies upon voluntary steps to achieve this rebuilding. They \nwill lead to a world in which more than voluntary steps are possible.",
        "Creative Commons is just one example of voluntary efforts by individuals and \ncreators to change the mix of rights that now govern the creative field. The \nproject does not compete with copyright; it complements it. Its aim is not to \ndefeat the rights of authors, but to make it easier for authors and creators to \nexercise their rights more flexibly and cheaply. That difference, we believe, \nwill enable creativity to spread more easily.",
        "We will not reclaim a free culture by individual action alone. It will also take \nimportant reforms of laws. We have a long way to go before the politicians will \nlisten to these ideas and implement these reforms. But that also means that we \nhave time to build awareness around the changes that we need.",
        "In this chapter, I outline five kinds of changes: four that are general, and one \nthat’s specific to the most heated battle of the day, music. Each is a step, not \nan end. But any of these steps would carry us a long way to our end.",
        "If you buy a house, you have to record the sale in a deed. If you buy land upon \nwhich to build a house, you have to record the purchase in a deed. If you buy a \ncar, you get a bill of sale and register the car. If you buy an airplane ticket, \nit has your name on it.",
        "These are all formalities associated with property. They are requirements that \nwe all must bear if we want our property to be protected.",
        "In contrast, under current copyright law, you automatically get a copyright, \nregardless of whether you comply with any formality. You don’t have to register. \nYou don’t even have to mark your content. The default is control, and \nformalities are banished.",
        "Why?",
        "As I suggested in chapter 10, the motivation to abolish formalities was a good \none. In the world before digital technologies, formalities imposed a burden on \ncopyright holders without much benefit. Thus, it was progress when the law \nrelaxed the formal requirements that a copyright owner must bear to protect and \nsecure his work. Those formalities were getting in the way.",
        "But the Internet changes all this. Formalities today need not be a burden. \nRather, the world without formalities is the world that burdens creativity. \nToday, there is no simple way to know who owns what, or with whom one must deal \nin order to use or build upon the creative work of others. There are no records, \nthere is no system to tracethere is no simple way to know how to get \npermission. Yet given the massive increase in the scope of copyright’s rule, \ngetting permission is a necessary step for any work that builds upon our past. \nAnd thus, the lack of formalities forces many into silence where they \notherwise could speak.",
        "The law should therefore change this requirement [1]but it should not change it \nby going back to the old, broken system. We should require formalities, but we \nshould establish a system that will create the incentives to minimize the burden \nof these formalities.",
        "The important formalities are three: marking copyrighted work, registering \ncopyrights, and renewing the claim to copyright. Traditionally, the first of \nthese three was something the copyright owner did; the second two were something \nthe government did. But a revised system of formalities would banish the \ngovernment from the process, except for the sole purpose of approving standards \ndeveloped by others.",
        "Under the old system, a copyright owner had to file a registration with the \nCopyright Office to register or renew a copyright. When filing that \nregistration, the copyright owner paid a fee. As with most government agencies, \nthe Copyright Office had little incentive to minimize the burden of \nregistration; it also had little incentive to minimize the fee. And as the \nCopyright Office is not a main target of government policy- making, the office \nhas historically been terribly underfunded. Thus, when people who know something \nabout the process hear this idea about formalities, their first reaction is \npanicnothing could be worse than forcing people to deal with the mess that is \nthe Copyright Office.",
        "Yet it is always astonishing to me that we, who come from a tradition of \nextraordinary innovation in governmental design, can no longer think \ninnovatively about how governmental functions can be designed. Just because \nthere is a public purpose to a government role, it doesn’t follow that the \ngovernment must actually administer the role. Instead, we should be creating \nincentives for private parties to serve the public, subject to standards that \nthe government sets.",
        "In the context of registration, one obvious model is the Internet. There are at \nleast 32 million Web sites registered around the world. Domain name owners for \nthese Web sites have to pay a fee to keep their registration alive. In the main \ntop-level domains (.com, .org, .net), there is a central registry. The actual \nregistrations are, however, performed by many competing registrars. That \ncompetition drives the cost of registering down, and more importantly, it drives \nthe ease with which registration occurs up.",
        "We should adopt a similar model for the registration and renewal of copyrights. \nThe Copyright Office may well serve as the central registry, but it should not \nbe in the registrar business. Instead, it should establish a database, and a set \nof standards for registrars. It should approve registrars that meet its \nstandards. Those registrars would then compete with one another to deliver the \ncheapest and simplest systems for registering and renewing copyrights. That \ncompetition would substantially lower the burden of this formalitywhile \nproducing a database of registrations that would facilitate the licensing of \ncontent.",
        "It used to be that the failure to include a copyright notice on a creative work \nmeant that the copyright was forfeited. That was a harsh punishment for failing \nto comply with a regulatory ruleakin to imposing the death penalty for a \nparking ticket in the world of creative rights. Here again, there is no reason \nthat a marking requirement needs to be enforced in this way. And more \nimportantly, there is no reason a marking requirement needs to be enforced \nuniformly across all media.",
        "The aim of marking is to signal to the public that this work is copyrighted and \nthat the author wants to enforce his rights. The mark also makes it easy to \nlocate a copyright owner to secure permission to use the work.",
        "One of the problems the copyright system confronted early on was that different \ncopyrighted works had to be differently marked. It wasn’t clear how or where a \nstatue was to be marked, or a record, or a film. A new marking requirement could \nsolve these problems by recognizing the differences in media, and by allowing \nthe system of marking to evolve as technologies enable it to. The system could \nenable a special signal from the failure to marknot the loss of the copyright, \nbut the loss of the right to punish someone for failing to get permission first.",
        "Let’s start with the last point. If a copyright owner allows his work to be \npublished without a copyright notice, the consequence of that failure need not \nbe that the copyright is lost. The consequence could instead be that anyone has \nthe right to use this work, until the copyright owner complains and demonstrates \nthat it is his work and he doesn’t give permission. [2] The meaning of an \nunmarked work would therefore be use unless someone complains. If someone does \ncomplain, then the obligation would be to stop using the work in any new work \nfrom then on though no penalty would attach for existing uses. This would create \na strong incentive for copyright owners to mark their work.",
        "That in turn raises the question about how work should best be marked. Here \nagain, the system needs to adjust as the technologies evolve. The best way to \nensure that the system evolves is to limit the Copyright Office’s role to that \nof approving standards for marking content that have been crafted elsewhere.",
        "For example, if a recording industry association devises a method for marking \nCDs, it would propose that to the Copyright Office. The Copyright Office would \nhold a hearing, at which other proposals could be made. The Copyright Office \nwould then select the proposal that it judged preferable, and it would base that \nchoice solely upon the consideration of which method could best be integrated \ninto the registration and renewal system. We would not count on the government \nto innovate; but we would count on the government to keep the product of \ninnovation in line with its other important functions.",
        "Finally, marking content clearly would simplify registration requirements. If \nphotographs were marked by author and year, there would be little reason not to \nallow a photographer to reregister, for example, all photographs taken in a \nparticular year in one quick step. The aim of the formality is not to burden the \ncreator; the system itself should be kept as simple as possible.",
        "The objective of formalities is to make things clear. The existing system does \nnothing to make things clear. Indeed, it seems designed to make things unclear.",
        "If formalities such as registration were reinstated, one of the most difficult \naspects of relying upon the public domain would be removed. It would be simple \nto identify what content is presumptively free; it would be simple to identify \nwho controls the rights for a particular kind of content; it would be simple to \nassert those rights, and to renew that assertion at the appropriate time.",
        "The term of copyright has gone from fourteen years to ninety-five years for \ncorporate authors, and life of the author plus seventy years for natural \nauthors.",
        "In The Future of Ideas, I proposed a seventy-five-year term, granted in five-\nyear increments with a requirement of renewal every five years. That seemed \nradical enough at the time. But after we lost Eldred v. Ashcroft, the \nproposals became even more radical. The Economist endorsed a proposal for a \nfourteen-year copyright term. [3] Others have proposed tying the term to the \nterm for patents.",
        "I agree with those who believe that we need a radical change in copyright’s \nterm. But whether fourteen years or seventy-five, there are four principles that \nare important to keep in mind about copyright terms.",
        "(1) Keep it short: The term should be as long as necessary to give incentives \nto create, but no longer. If it were tied to very strong protections for authors \n(so authors were able to reclaim rights from publishers), rights to the same \nwork (not derivative works) might be extended further. The key is not to tie the \nwork up with legal regulations when it no longer benefits an author.",
        "(2) Keep it simple: The line between the public domain and protected content \nmust be kept clear. Lawyers like the fuzziness of fair use, and the \ndistinction between ideas and expression. That kind of law gives them lots \nof work. But our framers had a simpler idea in mind: protected versus \nunprotected. The value of short terms is that there is little need to build \nexceptions into copyright when the term itself is kept short. A clear and active \nlawyer-free zone makes the complexities of fair use and idea/expression \nless necessary to navigate.",
        "(3) Keep it alive: Copyright should have to be renewed. Especially if the \nmaximum term is long, the copyright owner should be required to signal \nperiodically that he wants the protection continued. This need not be an onerous \nburden, but there is no reason this monopoly protection has to be granted for \nfree. On average, it takes ninety minutes for a veteran to apply for a pension. \n[4] If we make veterans suffer that burden, I don’t see why we couldn’t require \nauthors to spend ten minutes every fifty years to file a single form.",
        "(4) Keep it prospective: Whatever the term of copyright should be, the \nclearest lesson that economists teach is that a term once given should not be \nextended. It might have been a mistake in 1923 for the law to offer authors only \na fifty-six-year term. I don’t think so, but it’s possible. If it was a mistake, \nthen the consequence was that we got fewer authors to create in 1923 than we \notherwise would have. But we can’t correct that mistake today by increasing the \nterm. No matter what we do today, we will not increase the number of authors who \nwrote in 1923. Of course, we can increase the reward that those who write now \nget (or alternatively, increase the copyright burden that smothers many works \nthat are today invisible). But increasing their reward will not increase their \ncreativity in 1923. What’s not done is not done, and there’s nothing we can do \nabout that now.",
        "These changes together should produce an average copyright term that is much \nshorter than the current term. Until 1976, the average term was just 32.2 years. \nWe should be aiming for the same.",
        "No doubt the extremists will call these ideas radical. (After all, I call them \nextremists.) But again, the term I recommended was longer than the term under \nRichard Nixon. How radical can it be to ask for a more generous copyright law \nthan Richard Nixon presided over?",
        "As I observed at the beginning of this book, property law originally granted \nproperty owners the right to control their property from the ground to the \nheavens. The airplane came along. The scope of property rights quickly changed. \nThere was no fuss, no constitutional challenge. It made no sense anymore to \ngrant that much control, given the emergence of that new technology.",
        "Our Constitution gives Congress the power to give authors exclusive right to \ntheir writings. Congress has given authors an exclusive right to their \nwritings plus any derivative writings (made by others) that are sufficiently \nclose to the author’s original work. Thus, if I write a book, and you base a \nmovie on that book, I have the power to deny you the right to release that \nmovie, even though that movie is not my writing.",
        "Congress granted the beginnings of this right in 1870, when it expanded the \nexclusive right of copyright to include a right to control translations and \ndramatizations of a work. [5] The courts have expanded it slowly through \njudicial interpretation ever since. This expansion has been commented upon by \none of the law’s greatest judges, Judge Benjamin Kaplan.",
        "So inured have we become to the extension of the monopoly to a large range of \nso-called derivative works, that we no longer sense the oddity of accepting such \nan enlargement of copyright while yet intoning the abracadabra of idea and \nexpression. [6]",
        "I think it’s time to recognize that there are airplanes in this field and the \nexpansiveness of these rights of derivative use no longer make sense. More \nprecisely, they don’t make sense for the period of time that a copyright runs. \nAnd they don’t make sense as an amorphous grant. Consider each limitation in \nturn.",
        "Term: If Congress wants to grant a derivative right, then that right should be \nfor a much shorter term. It makes sense to protect John Grisham’s right to sell \nthe movie rights to his latest novel (or at least I’m willing to assume it \ndoes); but it does not make sense for that right to run for the same term as the \nunderlying copyright. The derivative right could be important in inducing \ncreativity; it is not important long after the creative work is done.",
        "Scope: Likewise should the scope of derivative rights be narrowed. Again, \nthere are some cases in which derivative rights are important. Those should be \nspecified. But the law should draw clear lines around regulated and unregulated \nuses of copyrighted material. When all reuse of creative material was within \nthe control of businesses, perhaps it made sense to require lawyers to negotiate \nthe lines. It no longer makes sense for lawyers to negotiate the lines. Think \nabout all the creative possibilities that digital technologies enable; now \nimagine pouring molasses into the machines. That’s what this general requirement \nof permission does to the creative process. Smothers it. ",
        "This was the point that Alben made when describing the making of the Clint \nEastwood CD. While it makes sense to require negotiation for foreseeable \nderivative rightsturning a book into a movie, or a poem into a musical scoreit \ndoesn’t make sense to require negotiation for the unforeseeable. Here, a \nstatutory right would make much more sense.",
        "In each of these cases, the law should mark the uses that are protected, and the \npresumption should be that other uses are not protected. This is the reverse of \nthe recommendation of my colleague Paul Goldstein. [7] His view is that the law \nshould be written so that expanded protections follow expanded uses.",
        "Goldstein’s analysis would make perfect sense if the cost of the legal system \nwere small. But as we are currently seeing in the context of the Internet, the \nuncertainty about the scope of protection, and the incentives to protect \nexisting architectures of revenue, combined with a strong copyright, weaken the \nprocess of innovation.",
        "The law could remedy this problem either by removing protection beyond the part \nexplicitly drawn or by granting reuse rights upon certain statutory conditions. \nEither way, the effect would be to free a great deal of culture to others to \ncultivate. And under a statutory rights regime, that reuse would earn artists \nmore income.",
        "The battle that got this whole war going was about music, so it wouldn’t be fair \nto end this book without addressing the issue that is, to most people, most \npressingmusic. There is no other policy issue that better teaches the lessons \nof this book than the battles around the sharing of music.",
        "The appeal of file-sharing music was the crack cocaine of the Inter-net’s \ngrowth. It drove demand for access to the Internet more powerfully than any \nother single application. It was the Internet’s killer apppossibly in two \nsenses of that word. It no doubt was the application that drove demand for \nbandwidth. It may well be the application that drives demand for regulations \nthat in the end kill innovation on the network.",
        "The aim of copyright, with respect to content in general and music in \nparticular, is to create the incentives for music to be composed, performed, \nand, most importantly, spread. The law does this by giving an exclusive right to \na composer to control public performances of his work, and to a performing \nartist to control copies of her performance.",
        "File-sharing networks complicate this model by enabling the spread of content \nfor which the performer has not been paid. But of course, that’s not all the \nfile-sharing networks do. As I described in chapter 5, they enable four \ndifferent kinds of sharing:",
        "A. There are some who are using sharing networks as substitutes for purchasing \nCDs.\nB. There are also some who are using sharing networks to sample, on the way to \npurchasing CDs.\nC. There are many who are using file-sharing networks to get access to content \nthat is no longer sold but is still under copyright or that would have been too \ncumbersome to buy off the Net.\nD. There are many who are using file-sharing networks to get access to content \nthat is not copyrighted or to get access that the copyright owner plainly \nendorses.",
        "Any reform of the law needs to keep these different uses in focus. It must avoid \nburdening type D even if it aims to eliminate type A. The eagerness with which \nthe law aims to eliminate type A, moreover, should depend upon the magnitude of \ntype B. As with VCRs, if the net effect of sharing is actually not very harmful, \nthe need for regulation is significantly weakened.",
        "As I said in chapter 5, the actual harm caused by sharing is controversial. For \nthe purposes of this chapter, however, I assume the harm is real. I assume, in \nother words, that type A sharing is significantly greater than type B, and is \nthe dominant use of sharing networks.",
        "Nonetheless, there is a crucial fact about the current technological context \nthat we must keep in mind if we are to understand how the law should respond.",
        "Today, file sharing is addictive. In ten years, it won’t be. It is addictive \ntoday because it is the easiest way to gain access to a broad range of content. \nIt won’t be the easiest way to get access to a broad range of content in ten \nyears. Today, access to the Internet is cumbersome and slowwe in the United \nStates are lucky to have broadband service at 1.5 MBs, and very rarely do we get \nservice at that speed both up and down. Although wireless access is growing, \nmost of us still get access across wires. Most only gain access through a \nmachine with a keyboard. The idea of the always on, always connected Internet is \nmainly just an idea.",
        "But it will become a reality, and that means the way we get access to the \nInternet today is a technology in transition. Policy makers should not make \npolicy on the basis of technology in transition. They should make policy on the \nbasis of where the technology is going. The question should not be, how should \nthe law regulate sharing in this world? The question should be, what law will we \nrequire when the network becomes the network it is clearly becoming? That \nnetwork is one in which every machine with electricity is essentially on the \nNet; where everywhere you areexcept maybe the desert or the Rockiesyou can \ninstantaneously be connected to the Internet. Imagine the Internet as ubiquitous \nas the best cell-phone service, where with the flip of a device, you are \nconnected.",
        "In that world, it will be extremely easy to connect to services that give you \naccess to content on the flysuch as Internet radio, content that is streamed to \nthe user when the user demands. Here, then, is the critical point: When it is \n/extremely easy to connect to services that give access to content, it will be \n/easier to connect to services that give you access to content than it will be \nto download and store content on the many devices you will have for playing \ncontent. It will be easier, in other words, to subscribe than it will be to be \na database manager, as everyone in the download-sharing world of Napster-like \ntechnologies essentially is. Content services will compete with content sharing, \neven if the services charge money for the content they give access to. Already \ncell-phone services in Japan offer music (for a fee) streamed over cell phones \n(enhanced with plugs for headphones). The Japanese are paying for this content \neven though free content is available in the form of MP3s across the Web. [8]",
        "This point about the future is meant to suggest a perspective on the present: It \nis emphatically temporary. The problem with file sharingto the extent there \nis a real problemis a problem that will increasingly disappear as it becomes \neasier to connect to the Internet. And thus it is an extraordinary mistake for \npolicy makers today to be solving this problem in light of a technology that \nwill be gone tomorrow. The question should not be how to regulate the Internet \nto eliminate file sharing (the Net will evolve that problem away). The question \ninstead should be how to assure that artists get paid, during this transition \nbetween twentieth-century models for doing business and twenty-first-century \ntechnologies.",
        "The answer begins with recognizing that there are different problems here to \nsolve. Let’s start with type D contentuncopyrighted content or copyrighted \ncontent that the artist wants shared. The problem with this content is to make \nsure that the technology that would enable this kind of sharing is not rendered \nillegal. You can think of it this way: Pay phones are used to deliver ransom \ndemands, no doubt. But there are many who need to use pay phones who have \nnothing to do with ransoms. It would be wrong to ban pay phones in order to \neliminate kidnapping.",
        "Type C content raises a different problem. This is content that was, at one \ntime, published and is no longer available. It may be unavailable because the \nartist is no longer valuable enough for the record label he signed with to carry \nhis work. Or it may be unavailable because the work is forgotten. Either way, \nthe aim of the law should be to facilitate the access to this content, ideally \nin a way that returns something to the artist.",
        "Again, the model here is the used book store. Once a book goes out of print, it \nmay still be available in libraries and used book stores. But libraries and used \nbook stores don’t pay the copyright owner when someone reads or buys an out-of-\nprint book. That makes total sense, of course, since any other system would be \nso burdensome as to eliminate the possibility of used book stores’ existing. But \nfrom the author’s perspective, this sharing of his content without his being \ncompensated is less than ideal.",
        "The model of used book stores suggests that the law could simply deem out-of-\nprint music fair game. If the publisher does not make copies of the music \navailable for sale, then commercial and noncommercial providers would be free, \nunder this rule, to share that content, even though the sharing involved \nmaking a copy. The copy here would be incidental to the trade; in a context \nwhere commercial publishing has ended, trading music should be as free as \ntrading books.",
        "Alternatively, the law could create a statutory license that would ensure that \nartists get something from the trade of their work. For example, if the law set \na low statutory rate for the commercial sharing of content that was not offered \nfor sale by a commercial publisher, and if that rate were automatically \ntransferred to a trust for the benefit of the artist, then businesses could \ndevelop around the idea of trading this content, and artists would benefit from \nthis trade.",
        "This system would also create an incentive for publishers to keep works \navailable commercially. Works that are available commercially would not be \nsubject to this license. Thus, publishers could protect the right to charge \nwhatever they want for content if they kept the work commercially available. But \nif they don’t keep it available, and instead, the computer hard disks of fans \naround the world keep it alive, then any royalty owed for such copying should be \nmuch less than the amount owed a commercial publisher.",
        "The hard case is content of types A and B, and again, this case is hard only \nbecause the extent of the problem will change over time, as the technologies for \ngaining access to content change. The law’s solution should be as flexible as \nthe problem is, understanding that we are in the middle of a radical \ntransformation in the technology for delivering and accessing content.",
        "So here’s a solution that will at first seem very strange to both sides in this \nwar, but which upon reflection, I suggest, should make some sense.",
        "Stripped of the rhetoric about the sanctity of property, the basic claim of the \ncontent industry is this: A new technology (the Internet) has harmed a set of \nrights that secure copyright. If those rights are to be protected, then the \ncontent industry should be compensated for that harm. Just as the technology of \ntobacco harmed the health of millions of Americans, or the technology of \nasbestos caused grave illness to thousands of miners, so, too, has the \ntechnology of digital networks harmed the interests of the content industry.",
        "I love the Internet, and so I don’t like likening it to tobacco or asbestos. But \nthe analogy is a fair one from the perspective of the law. And it suggests a \nfair response: Rather than seeking to destroy the Internet, or the p2p \ntechnologies that are currently harming content providers on the Internet, we \nshould find a relatively simple way to compensate those who are harmed.",
        "The idea would be a modification of a proposal that has been floated by Harvard \nlaw professor William Fisher. [9] Fisher suggests a very clever way around the \ncurrent impasse of the Internet. Under his plan, all content capable of digital \ntransmission would (1) be marked with a digital watermark (don’t worry about how \neasy it is to evade these marks; as you’ll see, there’s no incentive to evade \nthem). Once the content is marked, then entrepreneurs would develop (2) systems \nto monitor how many items of each content were distributed. On the basis of \nthose numbers, then (3) artists would be compensated. The compensation would be \npaid for by (4) an appropriate tax.",
        "Fisher’s proposal is careful and comprehensive. It raises a million questions, \nmost of which he answers well in his upcoming book, Promises to Keep. The \nmodification that I would make is relatively simple: Fisher imagines his \nproposal replacing the existing copyright system. I imagine it complementing the \nexisting system. The aim of the proposal would be to facilitate compensation to \nthe extent that harm could be shown. This compensation would be temporary, aimed \nat facilitating a transition between regimes. And it would require renewal after \na period of years. If it continues to make sense to facilitate free exchange of \ncontent, supported through a taxation system, then it can be continued. If this \nform of protection is no longer necessary, then the system could lapse into the \nold system of controlling access.",
        "Fisher would balk at the idea of allowing the system to lapse. His aim is not \njust to ensure that artists are paid, but also to ensure that the system \nsupports the widest range of semiotic democracy” possible. But the aims of \nsemiotic democracy would be satisfied if the other changes I described were \naccomplishedin particular, the limits on derivative uses. A system that simply \ncharges for access would not greatly burden semiotic democracy if there were few \nlimitations on what one was allowed to do with the content itself.",
        "No doubt it would be difficult to calculate the proper measure of harm to an \nindustry. But the difficulty of making that calculation would be outweighed by \nthe benefit of facilitating innovation. This background system to compensate \nwould also not need to interfere with innovative proposals such as Apple’s \nMusicStore. As experts predicted when Apple launched the MusicStore, it could \nbeat free by being easier than free is. This has proven correct: Apple has \nsold millions of songs at even the very high price of 99 cents a song. (At 99 \ncents, the cost is the equivalent of a per-song CD price, though the labels have \nnone of the costs of a CD to pay.) Apple’s move was countered by Real Networks, \noffering music at just 79 cents a song. And no doubt there will be a great deal \nof competition to offer and sell music on-line.",
        "This competition has already occurred against the background of free music \nfrom p2p systems. As the sellers of cable television have known for thirty \nyears, and the sellers of bottled water for much more than that, there is \nnothing impossible at all about competing with free. Indeed, if anything, the \ncompetition spurs the competitors to offer new and better products. This is \nprecisely what the competitive market was to be about. Thus in Singapore, though \npiracy is rampant, movie theaters are often luxuriouswith first class seats, \nand meals served while you watch a movieas they struggle and succeed in finding \nways to compete with free.",
        "This regime of competition, with a backstop to assure that artists don’t lose, \nwould facilitate a great deal of innovation in the delivery of content. That \ncompetition would continue to shrink type A sharing. It would inspire an \nextraordinary range of new innovatorsones who would have a right to the \ncontent, and would no longer fear the uncertain and barbarically severe \npunishments of the law.",
        "In summary, then, my proposal is this:",
        "The Internet is in transition. We should not be regulating a technology in \ntransition. We should instead be regulating to minimize the harm to interests \naffected by this technological change, while enabling, and encouraging, the most \nefficient technology we can create.",
        "We can minimize that harm while maximizing the benefit to innovation by",
        "1. guaranteeing the right to engage in type D sharing;\n2. permitting noncommercial type C sharing without liability, and commercial \ntype C sharing at a low and fixed rate set by statute;\n3. while in this transition, taxing and compensating for type A sharing, to the \nextent actual harm is demonstrated.",
        "But what if piracy doesn’t disappear? What if there is a competitive market \nproviding content at a low cost, but a significant number of consumers continue \nto take content for nothing? Should the law do something then?",
        "Yes, it should. But, again, what it should do depends upon how the facts \ndevelop. These changes may not eliminate type A sharing. But the real issue is \nnot whether it eliminates sharing in the abstract. The real issue is its effect \non the market. Is it better (a) to have a technology that is 95 percent secure \nand produces a market of size x, or (b) to have a technology that is 50 \npercent secure but produces a market of five times x? Less secure might \nproduce more unauthorized sharing, but it is likely to also produce a much \nbigger market in authorized sharing. The most important thing is to assure \nartists’ compensation without breaking the Internet. Once that’s assured, then \nit may well be appropriate to find ways to track down the petty pirates.",
        "But we’re a long way away from whittling the problem down to this subset of type \nA sharers. And our focus until we’re there should not be on finding ways to \nbreak the Internet. Our focus until we’re there should be on how to make sure \nthe artists are paid, while protecting the space for innovation and creativity \nthat the Internet is.",
        "I’m a lawyer. I make lawyers for a living. I believe in the law. I believe in \nthe law of copyright. Indeed, I have devoted my life to working in law, not \nbecause there are big bucks at the end but because there are ideals at the end \nthat I would love to live.",
        "Yet much of this book has been a criticism of lawyers, or the role lawyers have \nplayed in this debate. The law speaks to ideals, but it is my view that our \nprofession has become too attuned to the client. And in a world where the rich \nclients have one strong view, the unwillingness of the profession to question or \ncounter that one strong view queers the law.",
        "The evidence of this bending is compelling. I’m attacked as a radical by many \nwithin the profession, yet the positions that I am advocating are precisely the \npositions of some of the most moderate and significant figures in the history of \nthis branch of the law. Many, for example, thought crazy the challenge that we \nbrought to the Copyright Term Extension Act. Yet just thirty years ago, the \ndominant scholar and practitioner in the field of copyright, Melville Nimmer, \nthought it obvious. [10]",
        "However, my criticism of the role that lawyers have played in this debate is not \njust about a professional bias. It is more importantly about our failure to \nactually reckon the costs of the law.",
        "Economists are supposed to be good at reckoning costs and benefits. But more \noften than not, economists, with no clue about how the legal system actually \nfunctions, simply assume that the transaction costs of the legal system are \nslight. [11] They see a system that has been around for hundreds of years, and \nthey assume it works the way their elementary school civics class taught them it \nworks.",
        "But the legal system doesn’t work. Or more accurately, it doesn’t work for \nanyone except those with the most resources. Not because the system is corrupt. \nI don’t think our legal system (at the federal level, at least) is at all \ncorrupt. I mean simply because the costs of our legal system are so \nastonishingly high that justice can practically never be done.",
        "These costs distort free culture in many ways. A lawyer’s time is billed at the \nlargest firms at more than $400 per hour. How much time should such a lawyer \nspend reading cases carefully, or researching obscure strands of authority? The \nanswer is the increasing reality: very little. The law depended upon the careful \narticulation and development of doctrine, but the careful articulation and \ndevelopment of legal doctrine depends upon careful work. Yet that careful work \ncosts too much, except in the most high-profile and costly cases.",
        "The costliness and clumsiness and randomness of this system mock our tradition. \nAnd lawyers, as well as academics, should consider it their duty to change the \nway the law worksor better, to change the law so that it works. It is wrong \nthat the system works well only for the top 1 percent of the clients. It could \nbe made radically more efficient, and inexpensive, and hence radically more \njust.",
        "But until that reform is complete, we as a society should keep the law away from \nareas that we know it will only harm. And that is precisely what the law will \ntoo often do if too much of our culture is left to its review.",
        "Think about the amazing things your kid could do or make with digital \ntechnologythe film, the music, the Web page, the blog. Or think about the \namazing things your community could facilitate with digital technologya wiki, a \nbarn raising, activism to change something. Think about all those creative \nthings, and then imagine cold molasses poured onto the machines. This is what \nany regime that requires permission produces. Again, this is the reality of \nBrezhnev’s Russia.",
        "The law should regulate in certain areas of culturebut it should regulate \nculture only where that regulation does good. Yet lawyers rarely test their \npower, or the power they promote, against this simple pragmatic question: Will \nit do good? When challenged about the expanding reach of the law, the lawyer \nanswers, Why not?",
        "We should ask, Why? Show me why your regulation of culture is needed. Show me \nhow it does good. And until you can show me both, keep your lawyers away.",

The technology of digital audio tape (DAT), for example, was \nregulated by Congress to minimize the risk of piracy.

Thus, my \nproperty right to my car gives me the right to exclusive use, but not the \nright to drive at 150 miles an hour. For the best effort to connect the ordinary \nmeaning of property to lawyer talk, see Bruce Ackerman, Private Property \nand the Constitution (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977), 26-27.\n3. By describing the way law affects the other three modalities, I don’t mean to \nsuggest that the other three don’t affect law. Obviously, they do. Law’s only \ndistinction is that it alone speaks as if it has a right self-consciously to \nchange the other three. The right of the other three is more timidly expressed. \nSee Lawrence Lessig, Code: And Other Laws of Cyberspace (New York: Basic \nBooks, 1999): 90-95; Lawrence Lessig, The New Chicago School, Journal of \nLegal Studies, June 1998.\n4. Some people object to this way of talking about liberty. They object \nbecause their focus when considering the constraints that exist at any \nparticular moment are constraints imposed exclusively by the government. For \ninstance, if a storm destroys a bridge, these people think it is meaningless to \nsay that one’s liberty has been restrained. A bridge has washed out, and it’s \nharder to get from one place to another. To talk about this as a loss of \nfreedom, they say, is to confuse the stuff of politics with the vagaries of \nordinary life.\nI don’t mean to deny the value in this narrower view, which depends upon the \ncontext of the inquiry. I do, however, mean to argue against any insistence that \nthis narrower view is the only proper view of liberty. As I argued in Code, we \ncome from a long tradition of political thought with a broader focus than the \nnarrow question of what the government did when. John Stuart Mill defended \nfreedom of speech, for example, from the tyranny of narrow minds, not from the \nfear of government prosecution; John Stuart Mill, On Liberty (Indiana: Hackett \nPublishing Co., 1978), 19. John R. Commons famously defended the economic \nfreedom of labor from constraints imposed by the market; John R. Commons, The \nRight to Work, in Malcom Rutherford and Warren J. Samuels, eds., John R. \nCommons: Selected Essays (London: Routledge: 1997), 62. The Americans with \nDisabilities Act increases the liberty of people with physical disabilities by \nchanging the architecture of certain public places, thereby making access to \nthose places easier; 42 United States Code, section 12101 (2000). Each of \nthese interventions to change existing conditions changes the liberty of a \nparticular group. The effect of those interventions should be accounted for in \norder to understand the effective liberty that each of these groups might face.\n5.

Although 13,000 titles were published in the United States from 1790 to 1799, \nonly 556 copyright registrations were filed; John Tebbel, A History of Book \nPublishing in the United States, vol. 1, The Creation of an Industry, 1630-\n1865 (New York: Bowker, 1972), 141. Of the 21,000 imprints recorded before \n1790, only twelve were copyrighted under the 1790 act; William J. Maher, \n/Copyright Term, Retrospective Extension and the Copyright Law of 1790 in \nHistorical Context, 7-10 (2002), available at link #25. Thus, the overwhelming \nmajority of works fell immediately into the public domain. Even those works that \nwere copyrighted fell into the public domain quickly, because the term of \ncopyright was short. The initial term of copyright was fourteen years, with the \noption of renewal for an additional fourteen years. Copyright Act of May 31, \n1790, §1, 1 stat. 124.\n10. Few copyright holders ever chose to renew their copyrights. For instance, of \nthe 25,006 copyrights registered in 1883, only 894 were renewed in 1910. For a \nyear-by-year analysis of copyright renewal rates, see Barbara A. Ringer, Study \nNo. 31: Renewal of Copyright, Studies on Copyright, vol. 1 (New York: \nPracticing Law Institute, 1963), 618. For a more recent and comprehensive \nanalysis, see William M.

These statistics are understated. Between the years 1910 and 1962 (the first \nyear the renewal term was extended), the average term was never more than \nthirty-two years, and averaged thirty years. See Landes and Posner, \nIndefinitely Renewable Copyright, loc. cit.\n13. See Thomas Bender and David Sampliner, Poets, Pirates, and the Creation of \nAmerican Literature, 29 New York University Journal of International Law and \nPolitics 255 (1997), and James Gilraeth, ed., Federal Copyright Records, 1790-\n1800 (U.S. G.P.O., 1987).\n14. Jonathan Zittrain, The Copyright Cage, Legal Affairs, July/August 2003, \navailable at link #26.\n15. Professor Rubenfeld has presented a powerful constitutional argument about \nthe difference that copyright law should draw (from the perspective of the First \nAmendment) between mere copies and derivative works. See Jed Rubenfeld, The \nFreedom of Imagination: Copyright’s Constitutionality, Yale Law Journal 112 \n(2002): 1-60 (see especially pp. 53-59).\n16. This is a simplification of the law, but not much of one. The law certainly \nregulates more than copiesa public performance of a copyrighted song, for \nexample, is regulated even though performance per se doesn’t make a copy; 17 \n/United States Code, section 106(4). And it certainly sometimes doesn’t \nregulate a copy; 17 United States Code, section 112(a). But the presumption \nunder the existing law (which regulates copies; 17 United States Code, \nsection 102) is that if there is a copy, there is a right.\n17. Thus, my argument is not that in each place that copyright law extends, we \nshould repeal it. It is instead that we should have a good argument for its \nextending where it does, and should not determine its reach on the basis of \narbitrary and automatic changes caused by technology.\n18. I don’t mean nature in the sense that it couldn’t be different, but rather \nthat its present instantiation entails a copy. Optical networks need not make \ncopies of content they transmit, and a digital network could be designed to \ndelete anything it copies so that the same number of copies remain.\n19.

In principle, a contract might impose a requirement on me. I might, for \nexample, buy a book from you that includes a contract that says I will read it \nonly three times, or that I promise to read it three times. But that obligation \n(and the limits for creating that obligation) would come from the contract, not \nfrom copyright law, and the obligations of contract would not necessarily pass \nto anyone who subsequently acquired the book.\n22.

The Marijuana Policy Project, in February 2003, sought to place ads that \ndirectly responded to the Nick and Norm series on stations within the \nWashington, D.C., area. Comcast rejected the ads as against [their] policy. \nThe local NBC affiliate, WRC, rejected the ads without reviewing them. The local \nABC affiliate, WJOA, originally agreed to run the ads and accepted payment to do \nso, but later decided not to run the ads and returned the collected fees. \nInterview with Neal Levine, 15 October 2003.\nThese restrictions are, of course, not limited to drug policy.

For example, in July 2002, Representative Howard Berman introduced the Peer-\nto-Peer Piracy Prevention Act (H.R. 5211), which would immunize copyright \nholders from liability for damage done to computers when the copyright holders \nuse technology to stop copyright infringement. In August 2002, Representative \nBilly Tauzin introduced a bill to mandate that technologies capable of \nrebroadcasting digital copies of films broadcast on TV (i.e., computers) respect \na broadcast flag that would disable copying of that content. And in March of \nthe same year, Senator Fritz Hollings introduced the Consumer Broadband and \nDigital Television Promotion Act, which mandated copyright protection technology \nin all digital media devices.

        "1. There’s a parallel here with pornography that is a bit hard to describe, but \nit’s a strong one. One phenomenon that the Internet created was a world of \nnoncommercial pornographerspeople who were distributing porn but were not \nmaking money directly or indirectly from that distribution. Such a class didn’t \nexist before the Internet came into being because the costs of distributing porn \nwere so high. Yet this new class of distributors got special attention in the \nSupreme Court, when the Court struck down the Communications Decency Act of \n1996. It was partly because of the burden on noncommercial speakers that the \nstatute was found to exceed Congress’s power. The same point could have been \nmade about noncommercial publishers after the advent of the Internet. The Eric \nEldreds of the world before the Internet were extremely few. Yet one would think \nit at least as important to protect the Eldreds of the world as to protect \nnoncommercial pornographers.\n2.

        "1. Until the 1908 Berlin Act of the Berne Convention, national copyright \nlegislation sometimes made protection depend upon compliance with formalities \nsuch as registration, deposit, and affixation of notice of the author’s claim of \ncopyright. However, starting with the 1908 act, every text of the Convention has \nprovided that the enjoyment and the exercise of rights guaranteed by the \nConvention shall not be subject to any formality. The prohibition against \nformalities is presently embodied in Article 5(2) of the Paris Text of the Berne \nConvention. Many countries continue to impose some form of deposit or \nregistration requirement, albeit not as a condition of copyright. French law, \nfor example, requires the deposit of copies of works in national repositories, \nprincipally the National Museum.

I am thankful as well as to Professor \nNobuhiro Nakayama, and the Tokyo University Business Law Center, for giving me \nthe chance to spend time in Japan, and to Tadashi Shiraishi and Kiyokazu \nYamagami for their generous help while I was there.\nThese are the traditional sorts of help that academics regularly draw upon. But \nin addition to them, the Internet has made it possible to receive advice and \ncorrection from many whom I have never even met. Among those who have responded \nwith extremely helpful advice to requests on my blog about the book are Dr. \nMohammad Al-Ubaydli, David Gerstein, and Peter DiMauro, as well as a long list \nof those who had specific ideas about ways to develop my argument. They included \nRichard Bondi, Steven Cherry, David Coe, Nik Cubrilovic, Bob Devine, Charles \nEicher, Thomas Guida, Elihu M. Gerson, Jeremy Hunsinger, Vaughn Iverson, John \nKarabaic, Jeff Keltner, James Lindenschmidt, K. L. Mann, Mark Manning, Nora \nMcCauley, Jeffrey McHugh, Evan McMullen, Fred Norton, John Pormann, Pedro A. D. \nRezende, Shabbir Safdar, Saul Schleimer, Clay Shirky, Adam Shostack, Kragen \nSitaker, Chris Smith, Bruce Steinberg, Andrzej Jan Taramina, Sean Walsh, Matt \nWasserman, Miljenko Williams, Wink, Roger Wood, Ximmbo da Jazz, and Richard \nYanco. (I apologize if I have missed anyone; with computers come glitches, and a \ncrash of my e-mail system meant I lost a bunch of great replies.)\nRichard Stallman and Michael Carroll each read the whole book in draft, and each \nprovided extremely helpful correction and advice. Michael helped me to see more \nclearly the significance of the regulation of derivitive works. And Richard \ncorrected an embarrassingly large number of errors. While my work is in part \ninspired by Stallman’s, he does not agree with me in important places throughout \nthis book.\nFinally, and forever, I am thankful to Bettina, who has always insisted that \nthere would be unending happiness away from these battles, and who has always \nbeen right. This slow learner is, as ever, grateful for her perpetual patience \nand love.",
