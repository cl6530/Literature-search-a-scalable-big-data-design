        "It was not until it was getting dark that evening that\nGregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep.   He would\nhave woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn’t been\ndisturbed, as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested.\nBut he had the impression that some hurried steps and the\nsound of the door leading into the front room being\ncarefully shut had woken him.  The light from the electric\nstreet lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling\nand tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was,\nit was dark.  He pushed himself over to the door, feeling\nhis way clumsily with his antennae – of which he was now\nbeginning to learn the value – in order to see what had been\nhappening there.  The whole of his left side seemed like\none, painfully stretched scar,  and he limped badly on his\ntwo rows of legs.  One of the legs had been badly injured in\nthe events of that morning – it was nearly a miracle that\nonly one of them had been – and dragged along lifelessly.\nIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised\nwhat it actually was that had drawn him over to it; it was\nthe smell of something to eat.  By the door there was a dish\nfilled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread\nfloating in it.  He was so pleased he almost laughed, as he\nwas even hungrier than he had been that morning, and\nimmediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly covering\nhis eyes with it.  But he soon drew his head back again in\ndisappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left\nside make it difficult to eat the food – he was only able to\neat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole –\nbut the milk did not taste at all nice.  Milk like this was\nnormally his favourite drink, and his sister had certainly\nleft it there for him because of that, but he turned, almost\nagainst his own will, away from the dish and crawled back\ninto the centre of the room.",
        "Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas\nhad been lit in the living room.  His father at this time\nwould normally be sat with his evening paper, reading it out\nin a loud voice to Gregor’s mother, and sometimes to his\nsister, but there was now not a sound to be heard. Gregor’s\nsister would often write and tell him about this reading,\nbut maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times.  It\nwas so quiet all around too, even though there must have\nbeen somebody in the flat.  “What a quiet life it is the\nfamily lead”, said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the\ndarkness, felt a great pride that he was able to provide a\nlife like that in such a nice home for his sister and\nparents.  But what now, if all this peace and wealth and\ncomfort should come to a horrible and frightening end?  That\nwas something that Gregor did not want to think about too\nmuch, so he started to move about, crawling up and down the\nroom.",
        "Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the\nroom was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again;\nlater on the door on the other side did the same; it seemed\nthat someone needed to enter the room but thought better of\nit.  Gregor went and waited immediately by the door,\nresolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room\nin some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door\nwas opened no more that night and Gregor waited in vain.\nThe previous morning while the doors were locked everyone\nhad wanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had\nopened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been\nunlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys\nwere in the other sides.",
        "It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the\nliving room was put out, and now it was easy to see that\nparents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as they\nall could be distinctly heard as they went away together on\ntip-toe.  It was clear that no-one would come into Gregor’s\nroom any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time to\nthink undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his\nlife.  For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was\nforced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat\non the floor, even though he had been living in it for five\nyears.  Hardly aware of what he was doing other than a\nslight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch.  It\npressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able\nto lift his head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at\nease and his only regret was that his body was too broad to\nget it all underneath.  He spent the whole night there.\nSome of the time he passed in a light sleep, although he\nfrequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger, and\nsome of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which,\nhowever, always led to the same conclusion: for the time\nbeing he must remain calm, he must show patience and the\ngreatest consideration so that his family could bear the\nunpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced\nto impose on them.",
        "Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his\ndecisions, as early the next morning, almost before the\nnight had ended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened\nthe door from the front room and looked anxiously in.  She\ndid not see him straight away, but when she did notice him\nunder the couch – he had to be somewhere, for God’s sake, he\ncouldn’t have flown away – she was so shocked that she lost\ncontrol of herself and slammed the door shut again from\noutside.  But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as she\nopened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe\nas if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of\na stranger.  Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to\nthe edge of the couch, and watched her.  Would she notice\nthat he had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not\nfrom any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food\nthat was more suitable?  If she didn’t do it herself he\nwould rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,\nalthough he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from\nunder the couch, throw himself at his sister’s feet and beg\nher for something good to eat.  However, his sister noticed\nthe full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops\nof milk splashed around it with some surprise.  She\nimmediately picked it up – using a rag, not her bare hands –\nand carried it out.  Gregor was extremely curious as to what\nshe would bring in its place, imagining the wildest\npossibilities, but he never could have guessed what his\nsister, in her goodness, actually did bring.  In order to\ntest his taste, she brought him a whole selection of things,\nall spread out on an old newspaper.  There were old, half-\nrotten vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in\nwhite sauce that had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds;\nsome cheese that Gregor had declared inedible two days\nbefore; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and\nsalt.  As well as all that she had poured some water into\nthe dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for\nGregor’s use, and placed it beside them.  Then, out of\nconsideration for Gregor’s feelings, as she knew that he\nwould not eat in front of her, she hurried out again and\neven turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he\ncould make things as comfortable for himself as he liked.\nGregor’s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What’s\nmore, his injuries must already have completely healed as he\nfound no difficulty in moving.  This amazed him, as more\nthan a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a\nknife, he thought of how his finger had still hurt the day\nbefore yesterday.",
        "“Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?”, he thought,\nand was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had\nimmediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much more\nthan the other foods on the newspaper.  Quickly one after\nanother, his eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the\ncheese, the vegetables and the sauce; the fresh foods, on\nthe other hand, he didn’t like at all, and even dragged the\nthings he did want to eat a little way away from them\nbecause he couldn’t stand the smell.  Long after he had\nfinished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his\nsister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to him\nthat he should withdraw.  He was immediately startled,\nalthough he had been half asleep, and he hurried back under\nthe couch.  But he needed great self-control to stay there\neven for the short time that his sister was in the room, as\neating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he\ncould hardly breathe in that narrow space.  Half\nsuffocating, he watched with bulging eyes as his sister\nunselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs,\nmixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all\nas if it could not be used any more.  She quickly dropped it\nall into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried\neverything out.  She had hardly turned her back before\nGregor came out again from under the couch and stretched\nhimself.",
        "This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in\nthe morning while his parents and the maid were still\nasleep, and the second time after everyone had eaten their\nmeal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little while\nthen as well, and Gregor’s sister would send the maid away\non some errand.  Gregor’s father and mother certainly did\nnot want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have\nbeen more than they could stand to have any more experience\nof his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his\nsister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they\nwere indeed suffering enough.",
        "It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told\nthe doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them\nout of the flat.  As nobody could understand him, nobody,\nnot even his sister, thought that he could understand them,\nso he had to be content to hear his sister’s sighs and\nappeals to the saints as she moved about his room.  It was\nonly later, when she had become a little more used to\neverything – there was, of course, no question of her ever\nbecoming fully used to the situation – that Gregor would\nsometimes catch a friendly comment, or at least a comment\nthat could be construed as friendly.   “He’s enjoyed his\ndinner today”, she might say when he had diligently cleared\naway all the food left for him, or if he left most of it,\nwhich slowly became more and more frequent, she would often\nsay, sadly, “now everything’s just been left there again”.",
        "Although Gregor wasn’t able to hear any news directly he did\nlisten to much of what was said in the next rooms, and\nwhenever he heard anyone speaking he would scurry straight\nto the appropriate door and press his whole body against it.\nThere was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that\nwas not about him in some way, even if only in secret.  For\ntwo whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about\nwhat they should do now; but even between meals they spoke\nabout the same subject as there were always at least two\nmembers of the family at home – nobody wanted to be at home\nby themselves and it was out of the question to leave the\nflat entirely empty.  And on the very first day the maid had\nfallen to her knees and begged Gregor’s mother to let her go\nwithout delay.  It was not very clear how much she knew of\nwhat had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour,\ntearfully thanking Gregor’s mother for her dismissal as if\nshe had done her an enormous service.  She even swore\nemphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had\nhappened, even though no-one had asked that of her.  Now\nGregor’s sister also had to help his mother with the\ncooking; although that was not so much bother as no-one ate\nvery much.  Gregor often heard how one of them would\nunsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more\nanswer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough” or something\nsimilar.  No-one drank very much either.  His sister would\nsometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer,\nhoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself.  When his\nfather then said nothing she would add, so that he would not\nfeel selfish, that she could send the housekeeper for it,\nbut then his father would close the matter with a big, loud\n“No”, and no more would be said.",
        "Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had\nexplained to Gregor’s mother and sister what their finances\nand prospects were.  Now and then he stood up from the table\nand took some receipt or document from the little cash box\nhe had saved from his business when it had collapsed five\nyears earlier.  Gregor heard how he opened the complicated\nlock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he\nwanted.  What he heard his father say was some of the  first\ngood news that Gregor heard since he had first been\nincarcerated in his room.  He had thought that nothing at\nall remained from his father’s business, at least he had\nnever told him anything different, and Gregor had never\nasked him about it anyway.  Their business misfortune had\nreduced the family to a state of total despair, and Gregor’s\nonly concern at that time had been to arrange things so that\nthey could all forget about it as quickly as possible.  So\nthen he started working especially hard, with a fiery vigour\nthat raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling\nrepresentative almost overnight, bringing with it  the\nchance to earn money in quite different ways. Gregor\nconverted his success at work straight into cash that he\ncould lay on the table at home for the benefit of his\nastonished and delighted family.  They had been good times\nand they had never come again, at least not with the same\nsplendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that\nhe was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family,\nand did bear them.  They had even got used to it, both\nGregor and the family, they took the money with gratitude\nand he was glad to provide it, although there was no longer\nmuch warm affection given in return.  Gregor only remained\nclose to his sister now.  Unlike him, she was very fond of\nmusic and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was his\nsecret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even\nthough it would cause great expense that would have to be\nmade up for in some other way.  During Gregor’s short\nperiods in town, conversation with his sister would often\nturn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a\nlovely dream that could never be realised.  Their parents\ndid not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought\nabout it quite hard and decided he would let them know what\nhe planned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.\nThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went\nthrough his mind in his present state, pressed upright\nagainst the door and listening.  There were times when he\nsimply became too tired to continue listening, when his head\nwould fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up\nagain with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused\nwould be heard next door and they would all go silent.\n“What’s that he’s doing now”, his father would say after a\nwhile, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then\nwould the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.",
        "When explaining things, his father repeated himself several\ntimes, partly because it was a long time since he had been\noccupied with these matters himself and partly because\nGregor’s mother did not understand everything first time.\nFrom these repeated explanations Gregor learned, to his\npleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was still\nsome money available from the old days.  It was not a lot,\nbut it had not been touched in the meantime and some\ninterest had accumulated.  Besides that, they had not been\nusing up all the money that Gregor had been bringing home\nevery month, keeping only a little for himself, so that\nthat, too, had been accumulating.  Behind the door, Gregor\nnodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected\nthrift and caution.  He could actually have used this\nsurplus money to reduce his father’s debt to his boss, and\nthe day when he could have freed himself from that job would\nhave come much closer, but now it was certainly better the\nway his father had done things.",
        "This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the\nfamily to live off the interest; it was enough to maintain\nthem for, perhaps, one or two years, no more.  That’s to\nsay, it was money that should not really be touched but set\naside for emergencies; money to live on had to be earned.\nHis father was healthy but old, and lacking in self\nconfidence.  During the five years that he had not been\nworking – the first holiday in a life that had been full of\nstrain and no success –  he had put on a lot of weight and\nbecome very slow and clumsy.  Would Gregor’s elderly mother\nnow have to go and earn money?  She suffered from asthma and\nit was a strain for her just to move about the home, every\nother day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa\nby the open window.  Would his sister have to go and earn\nmoney?  She was still a child of seventeen, her life up till\nthen had been very enviable, consisting of wearing nice\nclothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business, joining\nin with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the\nviolin.  Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn\nmoney, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then\nthrow himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he\nbecame quite hot with shame and regret.  He would often lie\nthere the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but\nscratching at the leather for hours on end.  Or he might go\nto all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing\nup onto the sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on\nthe window to stare out of it.  He had used to feel a great\nsense of freedom from doing this, but doing it now was\nobviously something more remembered than experienced,  as\nwhat he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct\nevery day, even things that were quite near; he had used to\ncurse the ever-present view of  the hospital across the\nstreet, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had\nnot known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a\nquiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he\ncould have thought that he was looking out the window at a\nbarren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled\ninseparably.  His observant sister only needed to notice the\nchair twice before she would always push it back to its\nexact position by the window after she had tidied up the\nroom, and even left the inner pane of the window open from\nthen on.",
        "If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and\nthank her for all that she had to do for him it would have\nbeen easier for him to bear it; but as it was it caused him\npain.  His sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to\npretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the\nlonger it went on, of course, the better she was able to do\nso, but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through\nit all so much better.  It had even become very unpleasant\nfor him, now, whenever she entered the room.  No sooner had\nshe come in than she would quickly close the door as a\nprecaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into\nGregor’s room, then she would go straight to the window and\npull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating.\nEven if it was cold, she would stay at the window breathing\ndeeply for a little while.  She would alarm Gregor twice a\nday with this running about and noise making; he would stay\nunder the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well\nthat she would certainly have liked to spare him this\nordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room\nwith him with the windows closed.",
        "One day, about a month after Gregor’s transformation when\nhis sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked\nat his appearance, she came into the room a little earlier\nthan usual and found him still staring out the window,\nmotionless, and just where he would be most horrible.  In\nitself, his sister’s not coming into the room would have\nbeen no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult\nfor her to immediately open the window while he was still\nthere, but not only did she not come in, she went straight\nback and closed the door behind her, a stranger would have\nthought he had threatened her and tried to bite her.  Gregor\nwent straight to hide himself under the couch, of course,\nbut he had to wait until midday before his sister came back\nand she seemed much more uneasy than usual.  It made him\nrealise that she still found his appearance unbearable and\nwould continue to do so, she probably even had to overcome\nthe urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that\nprotruded from under the couch.  One day, in order to spare\nher even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the\nbedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so\nthat he was completely covered and his sister would not be\nable to see him even if she bent down.  If she did not think\nthis sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it\noff again, as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure\nfor Gregor to cut himself off so completely.  She left the\nsheet where it was.  Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look\nof gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from\nunder the sheet to see how his sister liked the new\narrangement.",
        "For the first fourteen days, Gregor’s parents could not\nbring themselves to come into the room to see him.  He would\noften hear them say how they appreciated all the new work\nhis sister was doing even though, before, they had seen her\nas a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been\nannoyed with her.  But now the two of them, father and\nmother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor’s\nroom while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she\nwent out again she would have to tell them exactly how\neverything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved\nthis time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could\nbe seen.  His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor\nrelatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded\nher against it.  Gregor listened very closely to all this,\nand approved fully.  Later, though, she had to be held back\nby force, which made her call out: “Let me go and see\nGregor, he is my unfortunate son!  Can’t you understand I\nhave to see him?”, and Gregor would think to himself that\nmaybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every\nday of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could\nunderstand everything much better than his sister who, for\nall her courage, was still just a child after all, and\nreally might not have had an adult’s appreciation of the\nburdensome job she had taken on.",
        " Gregor’s wish to see his mother was soon realised.  Out of\nconsideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being\nseen at the window during the day, the few square meters of\nthe floor did not give him much room to crawl about, it was\nhard to just lie quietly through the night, his food soon\nstopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain\nhimself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the\nwalls and ceiling.  He was especially fond of hanging from\nthe ceiling; it was quite different from lying on the floor;\nhe could breathe more freely; his body had a light swing to\nit; and up there, relaxed and almost happy, it might happen\nthat he would surprise even himself by letting go of the\nceiling and landing on the floor with a crash.  But now, of\ncourse, he had far better control of his body than before\nand, even with a fall as great as that, caused himself no\ndamage.  Very soon his sister noticed Gregor’s new way of\nentertaining himself – he had, after all, left traces of the\nadhesive from his feet as he crawled about – and got it into\nher head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing\nthe furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of\ndrawers and the desk.",
        "Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by\nherself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father;\nthe sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the\ncook had left but she certainly would not have helped in\nthis, she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen\nlocked at all times and never to have to open the door\nunless it was especially important; so his sister had no\nchoice but to choose some time when Gregor’s father was not\nthere and fetch his mother to help her.  As she approached\nthe room, Gregor could hear his mother express her joy, but\nonce at the door she went silent.  First, of course, his\nsister came in and looked round to see that everything in\nthe room was alright; and only then did she let her mother\nenter.  Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower\nover the couch and put more folds into it so that everything\nreally looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance.\nGregor also refrained, this time, from spying out from under\nthe sheet; he gave up the chance to see his mother until\nlater and was simply glad that she had come.  “You can come\nin, he can’t be seen”, said his sister, obviously leading\nher in by the hand.  The old chest of drawers was too heavy\nfor a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor\nlistened as they pushed it from its place, his sister always\ntaking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and\nignoring her mother’s warnings that she would strain\nherself.  This lasted a very long time.  After labouring at\nit for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be\nbetter to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was\ntoo heavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor’s\nfather got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it\nwould be in his way even more, and for another thing it\nwasn’t even sure that taking the furniture away would really\nbe any help to him.  She thought just the opposite; the\nsight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart; and\nwhy wouldn’t Gregor feel the same way about it, he’d been\nused to this furniture in his room for a long time and it\nwould make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like\nthat.",
        "Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose\nwhereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone of\nher voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand\nher words, she added “and by taking the furniture away,\nwon’t it seem like we’re showing that we’ve given up all\nhope of improvement and we’re abandoning him to cope for\nhimself?  I think it’d be best to leave the room exactly the\nway it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again\nhe’ll find everything unchanged and he’ll be able to forget\nthe time in between all the easier”.",
        "Hearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that\nthe lack of any direct human communication, along with the\nmonotonous life led by the family during these two months,\nmust have made him confused – he could think of no other way\nof explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his\nroom emptied out.  Had he really wanted to transform his\nroom into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice\nfurniture he had inherited?  That would have let him crawl\naround unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have\nlet him quickly forget his past when he had still been\nhuman.  He had come very close to forgetting, and it had\nonly been the voice of his mother, unheard for so long, that\nhad shaken him out of it.  Nothing should be removed;\neverything had to stay; he could not do without the good\ninfluence the furniture had on his condition; and if the\nfurniture made it difficult for him to crawl about\nmindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage.",
        "His sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become\nused to the idea, not without reason, that she was Gregor’s\nspokesman to his parents about the things that concerned\nhim.  This meant that his mother’s advice now was sufficient\nreason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of\ndrawers and the desk, as she had thought at first, but all\nthe furniture apart from the all-important couch.  It was\nmore than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected\nconfidence she had recently acquired, that made her insist;\nshe had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to\ncrawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone\ncould see, was of no use to him at all.",
        "Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about\nthings and feel they must get their way whenever they can.\nPerhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor’s\nsituation seem even more shocking than it was so that she\ncould do even more for him.  Grete would probably be the\nonly one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor\ncrawling about the bare walls by himself.  So she refused to\nlet her mother dissuade her.  Gregor’s mother already looked\nuneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped\nGregor’s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what\nstrength she had.  The chest of drawers was something that\nGregor could do without if he had to, but the writing desk\nhad to stay.  Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of\ndrawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor poked his\nhead out from under the couch to see what he could do about\nit.  He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could,\nbut, unfortunately, it was his mother who came back first\nwhile Grete in the next room had her arms round the chest,\npushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself\nwithout, of course, moving it an inch.  His mother was not\nused to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so\nGregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch.  In\nhis startlement, though, he was not able to prevent the\nsheet at its front from moving a little.  It was enough to\nattract his mother’s attention.  She stood very still,\nremained there a moment, and then went back out to Grete.",
        "Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual\nwas happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being\nmoved after all, but he soon had to admit that the women\ngoing to and fro, their little calls to each other, the\nscraping of the furniture on the floor, all these things\nmade him feel as if  he were being assailed from all sides.\nWith his head and legs pulled in against him and his body\npressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himself that\nhe could not stand all of this much longer.  They were\nemptying his room out; taking away everything that was dear\nto him; they had already taken out the chest containing his\nfretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove the\nwriting desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the\ndesk where he had done his homework as a business trainee,\nat high school, even while he had been at infant school – he\nreally could not wait any longer to see whether the two\nwomen’s intentions were good. He had nearly forgotten they\nwere there anyway, as they were now too tired to say\nanything while they worked and he could only hear their feet\nas they stepped heavily on the floor.",
        "So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other\nroom catching their breath, he sallied out, changed\ndirection four times not knowing what he should save first\nbefore his attention was suddenly caught by the picture on\nthe wall – which was already denuded of everything else that\nhad been on it – of the lady dressed in copious fur.   He\nhurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its\nglass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly.\nThis picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would\ncertainly be taken away by no-one.  He turned his head to\nface the door into the living room so that he could watch\nthe women when they came back.",
        "They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back\nquite soon; Grete had put her arm around her mother and was\nnearly carrying her.  “What shall we take now, then?”, said\nGrete and looked around.  Her eyes met those of Gregor on\nthe wall.  Perhaps only because her mother was there, she\nremained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not\nlook round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in\nher voice: “Come on, let’s go back in the living room for a\nwhile?”  Gregor could see what Grete had in mind, she wanted\nto take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down\nfrom the wall.  Well, she could certainly try it!  He sat\nunyielding on his picture.  He would rather jump at Grete’s\nface.",
        "But Grete’s words had made her mother quite worried, she\nstepped to one side, saw the enormous brown patch against\nthe flowers of the wallpaper, and before she even realised\nit was Gregor that she saw screamed: “Oh God, oh God!”  Arms\noutstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given up\neverything and stayed there immobile.  “Gregor!” shouted his\nsister, glowering at him and shaking her fist.  That was the\nfirst word she had spoken to him directly since his\ntransformation.  She ran into the other room to fetch some\nkind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint;\nGregor wanted to help too – he could save his picture later,\nalthough he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself\noff by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he\ncould advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to\njust stand behind her doing nothing; she was looking into\nvarious bottles, he startled her when she turned round; a\nbottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut Gregor’s\nface, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him;\nnow, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the\nbottles she could and ran with them in to her mother; she\nslammed the door shut with her foot.  So now Gregor was shut\nout from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to\ndeath; he could not open the door if he did not want to\nchase his sister away, and she had to stay with his mother;\nthere was nothing for him to do but wait; and, oppressed\nwith anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, he\ncrawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and\nfinally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin\naround him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table.",
        "He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him\nit was quiet, maybe that was a good sign.  Then there was\nsomeone at the door.  The maid, of course, had locked\nherself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and\nanswer it.  His father had arrived home.  “What’s happened?\"\nwere his first words; Grete’s appearance must have made\neverything clear to him.  She answered him with subdued\nvoice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: “Mother’s\nfainted, but she’s better now. Gregor got out.”  “Just as I\nexpected”, said his father, “just as I always said, but you\nwomen wouldn’t listen, would you.”",
        "It was clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and\nthat his father took it to mean that something bad had\nhappened, that he was responsible for some act of violence.\nThat meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father,\nas he did not have the time to explain things to him even if\nthat had been possible.  So he fled to the door of his room\nand pressed himself against it so that his father, when he\ncame in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor\nhad the best intentions and would go back into his room\nwithout delay, that it would not be necessary to drive him\nback but that they had only to open the door and he would\ndisappear.",
        "His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties\nlike that; “Ah!”, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if\nhe were both angry and glad at the same time.  Gregor drew\nhis head back from the door and lifted it towards his\nfather.  He really had not imagined his father the way he\nstood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling\nabout, he had neglected to pay attention to what was going\non the rest of the flat the way he had done before.  He\nreally ought to have expected things to have changed, but\nstill, still, was that really his father?  The same tired\nman as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when\nGregor came back from his business trips, who would receive\nhim sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came\nback in the evenings; who was hardly even able to stand up\nbut, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raise his arms\nand who, on the couple of times a year when they went for a\nwalk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up\ntightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would\nalways labour his way forward a little more slowly than\nthem, who were already walking slowly for his sake; who\nwould place his stick down carefully and, if he wanted to\nsay something would invariably stop and gather his\ncompanions around him.",
        "He was standing up straight enough now; dressed in a smart\nblue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the\nemployees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff\ncollar of the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the\nbushy eyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and\nalert; his normally unkempt white hair was combed down\npainfully close to his scalp.  He took his cap, with its\ngold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in an\narc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in\nhis trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long\nuniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked\ntowards Gregor.",
        "He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind,\nbut nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high.  Gregor was\namazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but\nwasted no time with that – he knew full well, right from the\nfirst day of his new life, that his father thought it\nnecessary to always be extremely strict with him.  And so he\nran up to his father, stopped when his father stopped,\nscurried forwards again when he moved, even slightly.  In\nthis way they went round the room several times without\nanything decisive happening, without even giving the\nimpression of a chase as everything went so slowly.  Gregor\nremained all this time on the floor, largely because he\nfeared his father might see it as especially provoking if he\nfled onto the wall or ceiling.  Whatever he did, Gregor had\nto admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this\nrunning about for long, as for each step his father took he\nhad to carry out countless movements.  He became noticeably\nshort of breath, even in his earlier life his lungs had not\nbeen very reliable.  Now, as he lurched about in his efforts\nto muster all the strength he could for running he could\nhardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too slow for\nhim to think of any other way of saving himself than\nrunning; he almost forgot that the walls were there for him\nto use although, here, they were concealed behind carefully\ncarved furniture full of notches and protrusions – then,\nright beside him, lightly tossed, something flew down and\nrolled in front of him.  It was an apple; then another one\nimmediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no\nlonger any point in running as his father had decided to\nbombard him.  He had filled his pockets with fruit from the\nbowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time\nfor careful aim, threw one apple after another.  These\nlittle, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into\neach other as if they had electric motors.  An apple thrown\nwithout much force glanced against Gregor’s back and slid\noff without doing any harm.  Another one however,\nimmediately following it, hit squarely and lodged in his\nback; Gregor wanted to drag himself away, as if he could\nremove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing his\nposition; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread\nhimself out, all his senses in confusion.  The last thing he\nsaw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister\nwas screaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her\nblouse (as his sister had taken off some of her clothes\nafter she had fainted to make it easier for her to breathe),\nshe ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding one\nafter another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she\npushed herself to his father, her arms around him, uniting\nherself with him totally – now Gregor lost his ability to\nsee anything – her hands behind his father’s head begging\nhim to spare Gregor’s life.",
