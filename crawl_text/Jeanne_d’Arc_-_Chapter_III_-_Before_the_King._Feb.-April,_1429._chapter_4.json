        "\nSt. Joan of Arc\nIn French Jeanne d’Arc;\nCommonly known as la Pucelle (the Maid) by her contemporaries.\n\n",
        "\n\n",
        "Jeanne and her little party were eleven days on the road, but do not\nseem to have encountered any special peril. They lodged sometimes in\nthe security of a convent, sometimes in a village hostel, pursuing the\nlong and tedious way across the great levels of midland France, which\nhas so few features of beauty except in the picturesque towns with\ntheir castles and churches, which the escort avoided. At length they\npaused in the village of Fierbois not far from Chinon where the Court\nwas, in order to announce their arrival and ask for an audience, which\nwas not immediately accorded. Charles held his Court with incredible\ngaiety and folly, in the midst of almost every disaster that could\novertake a king, in the castle of Chinon on the banks of the Vienne.\nThe situation and aspect of this noble building, now in ruins, is\nwonderfully like that of Windsor Castle. The great walls, interrupted\nand strengthened by huge towers, stretch along a low ridge of rocky\nhill, with the swift and clear river, a little broader and swifter\nthan the Thames, flowing at its foot. The red and high-pitched roofs\nof the houses clustered between the castle hill and the stream, give a\npoint of resemblance the more. The large and ample dwelling,\ndefensible, but with no thought of any need of defence, a midland\ncastle surrounded by many a level league of wealthy country, which no\nhostile force should ever have power to get through, must have looked\nlike the home of a well-established royalty. There was no sound or\nsight of war within its splendid enclosure. Noble lords and gentlemen\ncrowded the corridors; trains of gay ladies, attendant upon two\nqueens, filled the castle with fine dresses and gay voices. There had\nbeen but lately a dreadful and indeed shameful defeat, inflicted by a\nmere English convoy of provisions upon a large force of French and\nScottish soldiers, the former led by such men as Dunois, La Hire,\nXaintrailles, etc., the latter by the Constable of Scotland, John\nStuart–which defeat might well have been enough to subdue every sound\nof revelry: yet Charles’s Court was ringing with music and pleasantry,\nas if peace had reigned around.",
        "It may be believed that there were many doubts and questions how to\nreceive this peasant from the fields, which prevented an immediate\nreply to her demand for an audience. From the first, de la Tremoille,\nCharles’s Prime Minister and chief adviser, was strongly against any\nencouragement of the visionary, or dealings with the supernatural; but\nthere would no doubt be others, hoping if not for a miraculous maid,\nyet at least for a passing wonder, who might kindle enthusiasm in the\ncountry and rouse the ignorant with hopes of a special blessing from\nHeaven. The gayer and younger portion of the Court probably expected a\nlittle amusement, above all, a new butt for their wit, or perhaps a\nsoothsayer to tell their fortunes and promise good things to come.\nThey had not very much to amuse them, though they made the best of it.\nThe joys of Paris were very far off; they were all but imprisoned in\nthis dull province of Touraine; nobody knew at what moment they might\nbe forced to leave even that refuge. For the moment here was a new\nevent, a little stir of interest, something to pass an hour. Jeanne\nhad to wait two days in Chinon before she was granted an audience, but\nconsidering the carelessness of the Court and the absence of any\npatron that was but a brief delay.",
        "The chamber of audience is now in ruins. A wild rose with long,\narching, thorny branches and pale flowers, straggles over the\ngreensward where once the floor was trod by so many gay figures. From\nthe broken wall you look sheer down upon the shining river; one great\nchimney, which at that season must have been still the most pleasant\ncentre of the large, draughty hall, shows at the end of the room, with\na curious suggestion of warmth and light which makes ruin more\nconspicuous. The room must have been on the ground floor almost level\nwith the soil towards the interior of the castle, but raised to the\nheight of the cliffs outside. It was evening, an evening of March, and\nfifty torches lighted up the ample room; many noble personages, almost\nas great as kings, and clothed in the bewildering splendour of the\ntime, and more than three hundred cavaliers of the best names in\nFrance filled it to overflowing. The peasant girl from Domremy in the\nhose and doublet of a servant, a little travel-worn after her tedious\njourney, was led in by one of those splendid seigneurs, dazzled with\nthe grandeur she had never seen before, looking about her in wonder to\nsee which was the King–while Charles, perhaps with boyish pleasure in\nthe mystification, perhaps with a little half-conviction stealing over\nhim that there might be something more in it, stood among the smiling\ncrowd.",
        "The young stranger looked round upon all those amused, light-minded,\nsceptical faces, and without a moment’s hesitation went forward and\nknelt down before him. “Gentil Dauphin,” she said, “God give you good\nlife.” “But it is not I that am the King; there is the King,” said\nCharles. “Gentil Prince, it is you and no other,” she said; then\nrising from her knee: “Gentil Dauphin, I am Jeanne the Maid. I am sent\nto you by the King of Heaven to tell you that you shall be consecrated\nand crowned at Rheims, and shall be lieutenant of the King of Heaven,\nwho is King of France.” The little masquerade had failed, the jest was\nover. There would be little more laughing among the courtiers, when\nthey saw the face of Charles grow grave. He took the new-comer aside,\nperhaps to that deep recess of the window where in the darkening night\nthe glimmer of the clear, flowing river, the great vault of sky would\nstill be visible dimly, outside the circle of the blazing interior\nwith all its smoky lights.",
        "Charles VII. of France was, like many of his predecessors, a pauvre\nSire enough. He had thought more of his amusements than of the\ntroubles of his country; but a wild and senseless gaiety will\nsometimes spring from despair as well as from lightness of heart; and\nafter all, the dread responsibility, the sense that in all his\nhelplessness and inability to do anything he was still the man who\nought to do all, would seem to have moved him from time to time. A\nsecret doubt in his heart, divulged to no man, had added bitterness to\nthe conviction of his own weakness. Was he indeed the heir of France?\nHad he any right to that sustaining confidence which would have borne\nup his heart in the midst of every discouragement? His very mother had\ngiven him up and set him aside. He was described as the so-called\nDauphin in treaties signed by Charles and Isabeau his parents. If\nanyone knew, she knew; and was it possible that more powerful even\nthan the English, more cruel than the Burgundians, this stain of\nillegitimacy was upon him, making all effort vain? There is no telling\nwhere the sensitive point is in any man’s heart, and little worthy as\nwas this King, the story we are here told has a thrill of truth in it.\nIt is reported by a certain Sala, who declares that he had it from the\nlips of Charles’s favourite and close follower, the Seigneur de Boisi,\na courtier who, after the curious custom of the time, shared even the\nbed of his master. This was confided to Boisi by the King in the\ndeepest confidence, in the silence of the wakeful night:",
        "“This was in the time of the good King Charles, when he knew not what\nstep to take, and did nothing but think how to redeem his life: for as\nI have told you he was surrounded by enemies on all sides. The King in\nthis extreme thought, went in one morning to his oratory all alone;\nand there he made a prayer to our Lord, in his heart, without\npronouncing any words, in which he asked of Him devoutly that if he\nwere indeed the true heir, descended from the royal House of France,\nand that justly the kingdom was his, that He would be pleased to guard\nand defend him, or at the worst to give him grace to escape into Spain\nor Scotland, whose people, from all antiquity, were brothers-in-arms,\nfriends and allies of the kings of France, and that he might find a\nrefuge there.”",
        "Perhaps there is some excuse for a young man’s endeavour to forget\nhimself in folly or even in dissipation when his secret thoughts are\nso despairing as these.",
        "It was soon after this melancholy moment that the arrival of Jeanne\ntook place. The King led her aside, touched as all were, by her look\nof perfect sincerity and good faith; but it is she herself, not\nCharles, who repeats what she said to him. “I have to tell you,” said\nthe young messenger of God, “on the part of my Lord (/Messire) that\nyou are the true heir of France and the son of the King; He has sent\nme to conduct you to Rheims that you may receive your consecration and\nyour crown,\"–perhaps here, Jeanne caught some look which she did not\nunderstand in his eyes, for she adds with, one cannot but think a\ntouch of sternness–\"if you will.”",
        "Was it a direct message from God in answer to his prayer, uttered\nwithin his own heart, without words, so that no one could have guessed\nthat secret? At least it would appear that Charles thought so: for how\nshould this peasant maid know the secret fear that had gnawed at his\nheart? “When thou wast in the garden under the fig-tree I saw thee.\"\nGreat was the difference between the Israelite without guile and the\ntroubled young man, with whose fate the career of a great nation was\nentangled; but it is not difficult to imagine what the effect must\nhave been on the mind of Charles when he was met by this strange,\nauthoritative statement, uttered like all that Jeanne said, de la\npart de Dieu.",
        "The impression thus made, however, was on Charles alone, and he was\nsurrounded by councillors, so much the more pedantic and punctilious\nas they were incapable, and placed amidst pressing necessities with\nwhich in themselves they had no power to cope. It may easily be\nallowed, also, that to risk any hopes still belonging to the hapless\nyoung King on the word of a peasant girl was in itself, according to\nevery law of reason, madness and folly. She would seem to have had the\nwomen on her side always and at every point. The Church did not stir,\nor else was hostile; the commanders and military men about, regarded\nwith scornful disgust the idea that an enterprise which they\nconsidered hopeless should be confided to an ignorant woman–all with\nperfect reason we are obliged to allow. Probably it was to gain time–\nyet without losing the aid of such a stimulus to the superstitious\namong the masses–and to retard any rash undertaking–that it was\nproposed to subject Jeanne to an examination of doctors and learned\nmen touching her faith and the character of her visions, which all\nthis time had been of continual recurrence, yet charged with no\nfurther revelation, no mystic creed, but only with the one simple,\nconstantly repeated command.",
        "Accordingly, after some preliminary handling by half a dozen bishops,\nJeanne was taken to Poitiers–where the university and the local\nparliament, all the learning, law, and ecclesiastical wisdom which\nwere on the side of the King, were assembled–to undergo this\ninvestigation. It is curious that the entire history of this wildest\nand strangest of all visionary occurrences is to be found in a series\nof processes at law, each part recorded and certified under oath; but\nso it is. The village maid was placed at the bar, before a number of\nacute legists, ecclesiastics, and statesmen, to submit her to a not-\ntoo-benevolent cross-examination. Several of these men were still\nalive at the time of the Rehabilitation and gave their recollections\nof this examination, though its formal records have not been\npreserved. A Dominican monk, Aymer, one of an order she loved,\naddressed her gravely with the severity with which that institution is\nalways credited. “You say that God will deliver France; if He has so\ndetermined, He has no need of men-at-arms.” “Ah!” cried the girl, with\nperhaps a note of irritation in her voice, “the men must fight; it is\nGod who gives the victory.” To another discomfited Brother, Jeanne,\nexasperated, answered with a little roughness, showing that our Maid,\nthough gentle as a child to all gentle souls, was no piece of subdued\nperfection, but a woman of the fields, and lately much in the company\nof rough-spoken men. He was of Limoges, a certain Brother Seguin,\n“bien aigre homme,” and disposed apparently to weaken the trial by\nquestions without importance: he asked her what language her celestial\nvisitors spoke? “Better than yours,” answered the peasant girl. He\ncould not have been, as we say in Scotland, altogether “an ill man,\"\nfor he acknowledged that he spoke the patois of his district, and\ntherefore that the blow was fair. But perhaps for the moment he was\nirritated too. He asked her, a question equally unnecessary, “do you\nbelieve in God?” to which with more and more impatience she made a\nsimilar answer: “Better than you do.” There was nothing to be made of\none so well able to defend herself. “Words are all very well,” said\nthe monk, “but God would not have us believe you, unless you show us\nsome sign.” To this Jeanne made an answer more dignified, though still\nshowing signs of exasperation, “I have not come to Poitiers to give\nsigns,” she said; “but take me to Orleans–I will then show the signs\nI am sent to show. Give me as small a band as you please, but let me\ngo.”",
        "The situation of Orleans was at the time a desperate one. It was\nbesieged by a strong army of English, who had built a succession of\ntowers round the city, from which to assail it, after the manner of\nthe times. The town lies in the midst of the plain of the Loire, with\nnot so much as a hillock to offer any advantage to the besiegers.\nTherefore these great works were necessary in face of a very strenuous\nresistance, and the possibility of provisioning the besieged, which\ntheir river secured. The English from their high towers kept up a\ndisastrous fire, which, though their artillery was of the rudest kind,\ndid great execution. The siege was conducted by eminent generals. The\nworks were of themselves great fortifications, the assailants\nnumerous, and strengthened by the prestige of almost unbroken success;\nthere seemed no human hope of the deliverance of the town unless by an\noverwhelming army, which the King’s party did not possess, or by some\nwonderful and utterly unexpected event. Jeanne had always declared the\ndestruction of the English and the relief of Orleans to be the first\nstep in her mission.",
        "Besides the formal and official examination of her faith and\ncharacter, held at Poitiers, private inquests of all kinds were made\nconcerning of the claims of the miraculous maid. She was visited by\nevery curious person, man or woman, in the neighbourhood, and plied\nwith endless questions, so that her simple personal story, and that of\nher revelations–/mes voix, as she called them–became familiarly\nknown from her own report, to the whole country round about. The women\npressed a question specially interesting–for no doubt, many a good\nmother half convinced otherwise, shook her head at Jeanne’s costume–\nWhy she wore the dress of a man? for which the Maid gave very good\nreasons: in the first place because it was the only dress for\nfighting, which, though so far from her desires or from the habits of\nher life, was henceforward to be her work; and also because in her\nstrange circumstances, constrained as she was to live among men, she\nconsidered it safest for herself–statements which evidently convinced\nthe minds of the questioners. It was, no doubt, good policy to make\nher thus widely and generally known, and the result was a daily\ngrowing enthusiasm for her and belief in her, in all classes. The\nresult of the formal process was that the doctors could find nothing\nagainst her, and they reluctantly allowed that the King might lawfully\ntake what advantage he could of her offered services.",
        "Jeanne was then brought back to Chinon, where she was lodged in one of\nthe great towers still standing, though no special room is pointed out\nas hers. And there she was subjected to another process, more\npenetrating still than the interrogations of the graver tribunals. The\nQueens and their ladies and all the women of the Court took her in\nhand. They inquired into her history in every subtle and intimate\nfeminine way, testing her innocence and purity; and once more she came\nout triumphant. The final judgment was given as follows: “After\nhearing all these reports, the King taking into consideration the\ngreat goodness that was in the Maid, and that she declared herself to\nbe sent by God, it was by the said Seigneur and his council determined\nthat from henceforward he should make use of her for his wars, since\nit was for this that she was sent.”",
        "It was now necessary to equip Jeanne for her service. She had a\nmaison, an état majeur, or staff, formed for her, the chief of\nwhich, Jean d’Aulon, already distinguished and worthy of such a trust\nnever left her thenceforward until the end of her active career. Her\nchaplain, Jean Pasquerel, also followed her fortunes faithfully.\nCharles would have given her a sword to replace the probably\nindifferent weapon given her by Baudricourt at Vaucouleurs; but Jeanne\nknew where to find the sword destined for her. She gave orders that\nsomeone should be sent to Fierbois, the village at which she had\npaused on her way to Chinon, to fetch a sword which would be found\nthere buried behind the high altar of the church of St. Catherine. To\nmake this as little miraculous as possible, we are told by some\nhistorians that it was common for knights to be buried with their\narms, and that Jeanne, in her visit to this church, where she heard\nthree masses in succession to make up for the absence of constant\nreligious services on her journey–had probably seen some tomb or\nother token that such an interment had taken place. However, as we are\ncompelled to receive the far greater miracle of Jeanne herself and her\nwork, without explanation, it is foolish to take the trouble to\nattempt any explanation of so small a matter as this. The sword in\nfact was found, by the clergy of the church, and was by them cleaned\nand polished and put in a scabbard of crimson velvet, scattered over\nwith fleur-de-lys in gold, for her use. Her standard, which she\nconsidered of the greatest importance was made apparently at Tours. It\nwas of white linen, fringed with silk and embroidered with a figure of\nthe Saviour holding a globe in His hands, while an angel knelt at\neither side in adoration. Jhesus’ Maria was inscribed at the foot. A\nrepetition of this banner, which must have been re-copied from age to\nage is to be seen now at Tours. Having indicated the exact device to\nbe emblazoned upon the banner, as dictated to her by her saints,–\nMargaret and Catherine–Jeanne announced her intention of carrying it\nherself, a somewhat surprising office for one who was to act as a\ngeneral. But it was the command of her heavenly guides. “Take the\nstandard on the part of God, and carry it boldly,” they had said. She\nhad, besides, a simple, half-childish intention of her own in this,\nwhich she explained shame-faced–she had no wish to use her sword\nthough she loved it, and would kill no man. The banner was a more safe\noccupation, and saved her from all possibility of blood-shedding; it\nmust however, have required the robust arm of a peasant to sustain the\nheavy weight.",
        "It will show how long a time all these examinations and preparations\nhad taken when we read that Jeanne set out from Blois, where she had\npassed some time in military preparations, only on the 27th day of\nApril; nearly two whole months had thus been taken up in testing her\ntruth, and arranging details, trifling and unnecessary in her eyes:–a\nperiod which had been passed in great anxiety by the people of\nOrleans, with the huge bastilles of the English–three of which were\nnamed Paris, Rouen, and London–towering round them, their provisions\noften intercepted, all the business of life come to a standstill, and\nthe overwhelming responsibility upon them of being almost the last\nbarrier between the invader and the final subjugation of France. It is\nstrange to add that, judging by ordinary rules, the garrison of\nOrleans ought to have been quite sufficient in itself in numbers and\nscience of war, to have beaten and dispersed the English force which\nhad thus succeeded in shutting them in; there were many notable\ncaptains among them, with Dunois, known as the Bastard of Orleans, one\nof the most celebrated and brave of French generals, at their head.\nDunois was in no way inferior to the generals of the English army; he\nwas popular, beloved by the people and soldiers alike, and though\nillegitimate, of the House of Orleans, one of the native seigneurs of\nthe place. The wonder is how he and his officers permitted the\nbuilding of these towers, and the shutting in of the town which they\nwere quite strong enough to protect. But it was a losing game which\nthey were playing, a part which does not suit the genius of the\nnation; and the superstition in favour of the English who had won so\nmany battles with all the disadvantages on their side,–cutting the\nfinest armies to pieces–was strong upon the imagination of the time.\nIt seemed a fate which no valour or skill upon the side of the French\ncould avert. Dunois, himself an unlikely person, one would have\nthought, to yield the honour of the fight to a woman, seems to have\nperceived that without a strong counter-motive, not within the range\nof ordinary methods, the situation was beyond hope.",
        "Accordingly, on the 27th or 28th of April, Jeanne set out at the head\nof her little army, accompanied by a great number of generals and\ncaptains. She had been equipped by the Queen of Sicily (with a touch\nof that keen sense of decorative effect which belonged to the age) in\nwhite armour inlaid with silver–all shining like her own St. Michael\nhimself, a radiance of whiteness and glory under the sun–armed de\ntoutes pièces sauve la teste, her uncovered head rising in full\nrelief from the dazzling breastplate and gorget. This is the\ndescription given of her by an eye-witness a little later. The country\nis flat as the palm of one’s hand. The white armour must have flashed\nback the sun for miles and miles of the level road, to the eyes which\nfrom the height of any neighbouring tower watched the party setting\nout. It is all fertile now, the richest plain, and even then, corn and\nwine must have been in full bourgeon, the great fresh greenness of the\nbig leaves coming out upon such low stumps of vine as were left in the\nsoil; but the devastated country was in those days covered with a wild\ngrowth like the macchia of Italian wilds, which half hid the\nmovements of the expedition. They went by the Loire to Tours, where\nJeanne had been assigned a dwelling of her own, with the estate of a\ngeneral; and from thence to Blois, where they had to wait for some\ndays while the convoy of provisions, which they were to convey to\nOrleans, was being prepared. And there Jeanne fulfilled one of the\npreliminary duties of her mission. She had informed her examiners at\nPoitiers that she had been commanded to write to the English generals\nbefore attacking them, appealing to them de la part de Dieu, to give\nup their conquests, and leave France to the French. The letter which\nwe quote would seem to have been dictated by her at Poitiers, probably\nto the confessor who now formed part of her suite and who attended her\nwherever she went:",
        "  JHESUS MARIA.",
        "  King of England, and you Duke of Bedford calling yourself Regent\n  of France, you, William de la Poule, Comte de Sulford, John, Lord\n  of Talbot, and you Thomas, Lord of Scales, who call yourself\n  lieutenants of the said Bedford, listen to the King of Heaven:\n  Give back to the Maid who is here sent on the part of God the King\n  of Heaven, the keys of all the good towns which you have taken by\n  violence in His France. She is ready to make peace if you will\n  hear reason and be just towards France and pay for what you have\n  taken. And you archers, brothers-in-arms, gentles and others who\n  are before the town of Orleans, go in peace on the part of God; if\n  you do not so you will soon have news of the Maid who will see you\n  shortly to your great damage. King of England, if you do not this,\n  I am captain in this war, and in whatsoever place in France I find\n  your people I will make them go away. I am sent here on the part\n  of God the King of Heaven to push you all forth of France. If you\n  obey I will be merciful. And be not strong in your own opinion,\n  for you do not hold the kingdom from God the Son of the Holy Mary,\n  but it is held by Charles the true heir, for God, the King of\n  Heaven so wills, and it is revealed by the Maid who shall enter\n  Paris in good company. If you will not believe this news on the\n  part of God and the Maid, in whatever place you may find\n  yourselves we shall make our way there, and make so great a\n  commotion as has not been in France for a thousand years, if you\n  will not hear reason. And believe this, that the King of Heaven\n  will send more strength to the Maid than you can bring against her\n  in all your assaults, to her and to her good men-at-arms. You,\n  Duke of Bedford, the Maid prays and requires you to destroy no\n  more. If you act according to reason you may still come in her\n  company where the French shall do the greatest work that has ever\n  been done for Christianity. Answer then if you will still continue\n  against the city of Orleans. If you do so you will soon recall it\n  to yourself by great misfortunes. Written the Saturday of Holy\n  Week (22 March, 1429).[1]",
        "Jeanne had by this time made a wonderful moral revolution in her\nlittle army; most likely she had not been in the least aware what an\narmy was, until this moment; but frank and fearless, she had\npenetrated into every corner, and it was not in her to permit those\nabuses at which an ordinary captain has to smile. The pernicious and\nshameful crowd of camp followers fled before her like shadows before\nthe day. She stopped the big oaths and unthinking blasphemies which\nwere so common, so that La Hire, one of the chief captains, a rough\nand ready Gascon, was reduced to swear by his bâton, no more sacred\nname being permitted to him. Perhaps this was the origin of the\nharmless swearing which abounds in France, meaning probably just as\nmuch and as little as bigger oaths in careless mouths; but no doubt\nthe soldiers’ language was very unfit for gentle ears. Jeanne moved\namong the wondering ranks, all radiant in her silver armour and with\nher virginal undaunted countenance, exhorting all those rude and noisy\nbrothers to take thought of their duties here, and of the other life\nthat awaited them. She would stop the march of the army that a\nconscience-stricken soldier might make his confession, and desired the\npriests to hear it if necessary without ceremony, or church, under the\nfirst tree. Her tender heart was such that she shrank from any man’s\ndeath, and her hair rose up on her head, as she said, at the sight of\nFrench blood shed–although her mission was to shed it on all sides\nfor a great end. But the one thing she could not bear was that either\nFrenchmen or Englishmen should die unconfessed, “unhouseled,\ndisappointed, unannealed.” The army went along attended by songs of\nchoristers and masses of priests, the grave and solemn music of the\nChurch accompanied strangely by the fanfares and bugle notes. What a\nstrange procession to pass along the great Loire in its spring\nfulness, the raised banners and crosses, and that dazzling white\nfigure, all effulgence, reflected in the wayward, quick flowing\nstream!",
        "La Hire, who is like a figure out of Dumas, and indeed did service as\na model to that delightful romancer, had come from Orleans to escort\nJeanne upon her way, and Dunois met her as she approached the town.\nThere could not be found more unlikely companions than these two, to\nconduct to a great battle the country maid who was to carry the\nhonours of the day from them both, and make men fight like heroes, who\nunder them did nothing but run away. The candour and true courage of\nsuch leaders in circumstances so extraordinary, are beyond praise, for\nit was an offence both to their pride and skill in their profession,\nhad she been anything less than the messenger of God which she claimed\nto be; and these rude soldiers were not men to be easily moved by\ndevout imaginations. There would seem, however, even in the case of\nthe greater of the two, to have arisen a strange friendship and mutual\nunderstanding between the famous man of war and the peasant girl.\nJeanne, always straightforward and simple, speaks to him, not with the\ndowncast eyes of her humility, but as an equal, as if the great Dunois\nhad been a prud’ homme of her own degree. There is no appearance\nindeed that the Maid allowed herself to be overborne now by any\nshyness or undue humility. She speaks loudly, so as to be heard by\nthose fighting men, taking something of their own brief and decisive\ntone, often even impatient, as one who would not be put aside either\nby cunning or force.",
        "Her meeting with Dunois makes this at once evident. She had been\ndeceived in the manner of her approach to Orleans, her companions,\namong whom there were several field-marshals and distinguished\nleaders, taking advantage of her ignorance of the place to lead her by\nthe opposite bank of the river instead of that on which the English\ntowers were built, which she desired to attack at once. This was the\nbeginning of a long series of deceits and hostile combinations, by\nwhich at every step of her way she was met and retarded; but it\nturned, as these devices generally did, to the discomfiture of the\nadverse captains. She crossed the river at Chécy above Orleans, to\nmeet Dunois who had come so far to meet her. It will be seen by the\nconversation which she held with him on his first appearance, how\ncompletely Jeanne had learnt to assert herself, and how much she had\novercome any fear of man. “Are you the Bastard of Orleans?” she said.\n“I am; and glad of your coming,” he replied. “Is it you who have had\nme led to this side of the river and not to the bank on which Talbot\nis and his English?” He answered that he and the wisest of the leaders\nhad thought it the best and safest way. “The counsel of God, our Lord,\nis more sure and more powerful than yours,” she replied. The\nexpedition, as a matter of fact, had to turn back, and to lose\nprecious time, there being, it is to be presumed, no means of\ntransporting so large a force across the river. The large convoy of\nprovisions which Jeanne brought was embarked in boats while the\nmajority of the army returned to Blois, in order to cross by the\nbridge.",
        "Jeanne, however, having freely expressed her opinion, adapted herself\nto the circumstances, though extremely averse to separate herself from\nher soldiers, good men who had confessed and prepared their souls for\nevery emergency. She finally consented, however, to ride on with\nDunois and La Hire. The wind was against the convoy, so that the heavy\nboats, deeply laden with beeves and corn, had a dangerous and slow\nvoyage before them. “Have patience,” cried Jeanne; “by the help of God\nall will go well\"; and immediately the wind changed, to the\nastonishment and joy of all, and the boats arrived in safety “in spite\nof the English, who offered no hindrance whatever,” as she had\npredicted. The little party made their way along the bank, and in the\ntwilight of the April evening, about eight o’clock, entered Orleans.\nThe Deliverer, it need not be said, was hailed with joy indescribable.\nShe was on a white horse, and carried, Dunois says, the banner in her\nhand, though it was carried before her when she entered the town. The\nwhite figure in the midst of those darkly gleaming mailed men, would\nin itself throw a certain glory through the dimness of the night, as\nshe passed the gates and came into view by the blaze of all the\ntorches, and the lights in the windows, over the dark swarming crowds\nof the citizens. Her white banner waving, her white armour shining, it\nwas little wonder that the throng that filled the streets received the\nMaid “as if they had seen God descending among them.” “And they had\ngood reason,” says the Chronicle, “for they had suffered many\ndisturbances, labours, and pains, and, what is worse, great doubt\nwhether they ever should be delivered. But now all were comforted, as\nif the siege were over, by the divine strength that was in this simple\nMaid whom they regarded most affectionately, men, women, and little\nchildren. There was a marvellous press around her to touch her or the\nhorse on which she rode, so much so that one of the torchbearers\napproached too near and set fire to her pennon; upon which she touched\nher horse with her spurs, and turning him cleverly, extinguished the\nflame, as if she had long followed the wars.”",
        "There could have been nothing she resembled so much as St. Michael,\nthe warrior-angel, who, as all the world knew, was her chief\ncounsellor and guide, and who, no doubt, blazed, a familiar figure,\nfrom some window in the cathedral to which this his living picture\nrode without a pause, to give thanks to God before she thought of\nrefreshment or rest. She spoke to the people who surrounded her on\nevery side as she went on through the tumultuous streets, bidding them\nbe of good courage and that if they had faith they should escape from\nall their troubles. And it was only after she had said her prayers and\nrendered her thanksgiving, that she returned to the house selected for\nher–the house of an important personage, Jacques Boucher, treasurer\nto the Duke of Orleans, not like the humble places where she had\nformerly lodged. The houses of that age were beautiful, airy and\nlight, with much graceful ornament and solid comfort, the arched and\nvaulted Gothic beginning to give place to those models of domestic\narchitecture which followed the Renaissance, with their ample windows\nand pleasant space and breadth. There the table was spread with a\njoyous meal in honour of this wonderful guest, to which, let us hope,\nDunois and La Hire and the rest did full justice. But Jeanne was\nindifferent to the feast. She mixed with water the wine poured for her\ninto a silver cup, and dipped her bread in it, five or six small\nslices. The visionary peasant girl cared for none of the dainty meats.\nAnd then she retired to the comfort of a peaceful chamber, where the\nlittle daughter of the house shared her bed: strange return to the\ndays when Hauvette and Mengette in Domremy lay by her side and talked\nas girls love to do, through half the silent night. Perhaps little\nCharlotte, too, lay awake with awe to wonder at that other young head\non the pillow, a little while ago shut into the silver helmet, and\nshining like the archangel’s. The état majeur, the Chevalier\nd’Aulon, Jean de Metz, and Bertrand de Poulengy, who had never left\nher, first friends and most faithful, and her brother Pierre d’Arc,\nwere lodged in the same house. It was the last night of April, 1429.\n\n\n[1] The dates must of course be reckoned by the old style.–This\n    letter was dispatched from Tours, during her pause there.\nContinue...
