        "What Irish man, woman, or child has not heard of our renowned\nHibernian Hercules, the great and glorious Fin M’Coul? Not one, from\nCape Clear to the Giant’s Causeway, nor from that back again to Cape\nClear. And, by-the-way, speaking of the Giant’s Causeway brings me\nat once to the beginning of my story. Well, it so happened that Fin\nand his men were all working at the Causeway, in order to make a\nbridge across to Scotland; when Fin, who was very fond of his wife\nOonagh, took it into his head that he would go home and see how the\npoor woman got on in his absence. So, accordingly, he pulled up a\nfir-tree, and, after lopping off the roots and branches, made a\nwalking-stick of it, and set out on his way to Oonagh.",
        "Oonagh, or rather Fin, lived at this time on the very tip-top of\nKnockmany Hill, which faces a cousin of its own called Cullamore,\nthat rises up, half-hill, half-mountain, on the opposite side.",
        "There was at that time another giant, named Cucullin–some say he\nwas Irish, and some say he was Scotch–but whether Scotch or Irish,\nsorrow doubt of it but he was a targer. No other giant of the day\ncould stand before him; and such was his strength, that, when well\nvexed, he could give a stamp that shook the country about him. The\nfame and name of him went far and near; and nothing in the shape of\na man, it was said, had any chance with him in a fight. By one blow\nof his fists he flattened a thunderbolt and kept it in his pocket,\nin the shape of a pancake, to show to all his enemies, when they\nwere about to fight him. Undoubtedly he had given every giant in\nIreland a considerable beating, barring Fin M’Coul himself; and he\nswore that he would never rest, night or day, winter or summer, till\nhe would serve Fin with the same sauce, if he could catch him.\nHowever, the short and long of it was, with reverence be it spoken,\nthat Fin heard Cucullin was coming to the Causeway to have a trial\nof strength with him; and he was seized with a very warm and sudden\nfit of affection for his wife, poor woman, leading a very lonely,\nuncomfortable life of it in his absence. He accordingly pulled up\nthe fir-tree, as I said before, and having snedded it into a\nwalking-stick, set out on his travels to see his darling Oonagh on\nthe top of Knockmany, by the way.",
        "In truth, the people wondered very much why it was that Fin selected\nsuch a windy spot for his dwelling-house, and they even went so far\nas to tell him as much.",
        "“What can you mane, Mr. M’Coul,” said they, “by pitching your tent\nupon the top of Knockmany, where you never are without a breeze, day\nor night, winter or summer, and where you’re often forced to take\nyour nightcap without either going to bed or turning up your little\nfinger; ay, an’ where, besides this, there’s the sorrow’s own want\nof water?”",
        "“Why,” said Fin, “ever since I was the height of a round tower, I\nwas known to be fond of having a good prospect of my own; and where\nthe dickens, neighbours, could I find a better spot for a good\nprospect than the top of Knockmany? As for water, I am sinking a\npump, and, plase goodness, as soon as the Causeway’s made, I intend\nto finish it.”",
        "Now, this was more of Fin’s philosophy; for the real state of the\ncase was, that he pitched upon the top of Knockmany in order that he\nmight be able to see Cucullin coming towards the house. All we have\nto say is, that if he wanted a spot from which to keep a sharp look-\nout–and, between ourselves, he did want it grievously–barring\nSlieve Croob, or Slieve Donard, or its own cousin, Cullamore, he\ncould not find a neater or more convenient situation for it in the\nsweet and sagacious province of Ulster.",
        "“God save all here!” said Fin, good-humouredly, on putting his\nhonest face into his own door.",
        "“Musha, Fin, avick, an’ you’re welcome home to your own Oonagh, you\ndarlin’ bully.” Here followed a smack that is said to have made the\nwaters of the lake at the bottom of the hill curl, as it were, with\nkindness and sympathy.",
        "Fin spent two or three happy days with Oonagh, and felt himself very\ncomfortable, considering the dread he had of Cucullin. This,\nhowever, grew upon him so much that his wife could not but perceive\nsomething lay on his mind which he kept altogether to himself. Let a\nwoman alone, in the meantime, for ferreting or wheedling a secret\nout of her good man, when she wishes. Fin was a proof of this.",
        "“It’s this Cucullin,” said he, “that’s troubling me. When the fellow\ngets angry, and begins to stamp, he’ll shake you a whole townland;\nand it’s well known that he can stop a thunderbolt, for he always\ncarries one about him in the shape of a pancake, to show to any one\nthat might misdoubt it.”",
        "As he spoke, he clapped his thumb in his mouth, which he always did\nwhen he wanted to prophesy, or to know anything that happened in his\nabsence; and the wife asked him what he did it for.",
        "“He’s coming,” said Fin; “I see him below Dungannon.”",
        "“Thank goodness, dear! an’ who is it, avick? Glory be to God!”",
        "“That baste, Cucullin,” replied Fin; “and how to manage I don’t\nknow. If I run away, I am disgraced; and I know that sooner or later\nI must meet him, for my thumb tells me so.”",
        "“When will he be here?” said she.",
        "“To-morrow, about two o’clock,” replied Fin, with a groan.",
        "“Well, my bully, don’t be cast down,” said Oonagh; “depend on me,\nand maybe I’ll bring you better out of this scrape than ever you\ncould bring yourself, by your rule o’ thumb.”",
        "She then made a high smoke on the top of the hill, after which she\nput her finger in her mouth, and gave three whistles, and by that\nCucullin knew he was invited to Cullamore–for this was the way that\nthe Irish long ago gave a sign to all strangers and travellers, to\nlet them know they were welcome to come and take share of whatever\nwas going.",
        "In the meantime, Fin was very melancholy, and did not know what to\ndo, or how to act at all. Cucullin was an ugly customer to meet\nwith; and, the idea of the “cake” aforesaid flattened the very heart\nwithin him. What chance could he have, strong and brave though he\nwas, with a man who could, when put in a passion, walk the country\ninto earthquakes and knock thunderbolts into pancakes? Fin knew not\non what hand to turn him. Right or left–backward or forward–where\nto go he could form no guess whatsoever.",
        "“Oonagh,” said he, “can you do nothing for me? Where’s all your\ninvention? Am I to be skivered like a rabbit before your eyes, and\nto have my name disgraced for ever in the sight of all my tribe, and\nme the best man among them? How am I to fight this man-mountain–\nthis huge cross between an earthquake and a thunderbolt?–with a\npancake in his pocket that was once–”",
        "“Be easy, Fin,” replied Oonagh; “troth, I’m ashamed of you. Keep\nyour toe in your pump, will you? Talking of pancakes, maybe, we’ll\ngive him as good as any he brings with him–thunderbolt or\notherwise. If I don’t treat him to as smart feeding as he’s got this\nmany a day, never trust Oonagh again. Leave him to me, and do just\nas I bid you.”",
        "This relieved Fin very much; for, after all, he had great confidence\nin his wife, knowing, as he did, that she had got him out of many a\nquandary before. Oonagh then drew the nine woollen threads of\ndifferent colours, which she always did to find out the best way of\nsucceeding in anything of importance she went about. She then\nplatted them into three plats with three colours in each, putting\none on her right arm, one round her heart, and the third round her\nright ankle, for then she knew that nothing could fail with her that\nshe undertook.",
        "Having everything now prepared, she sent round to the neighbours and\nborrowed one-and-twenty iron griddles, which she took and kneaded\ninto the hearts of one-and-twenty cakes of bread, and these she\nbaked on the fire in the usual way, setting them aside in the\ncupboard according as they were done. She then put down a large pot\nof new milk, which she made into curds and whey. Having done all\nthis, she sat down quite contented, waiting for his arrival on the\nnext day about two o’clock, that being the hour at which he was\nexpected–for Fin knew as much by the sucking of his thumb. Now this\nwas a curious property that Fin’s thumb had. In this very thing,\nmoreover, he was very much resembled by his great foe, Cucullin; for\nit was well known that the huge strength he possessed all lay in the\nmiddle finger of his right hand, and that, if he happened by any\nmischance to lose it, he was no more, for all his bulk, than a\ncommon man.",
        "At length, the next day, Cucullin was seen coming across the valley,\nand Oonagh knew that it was time to commence operations. She\nimmediately brought the cradle, and made Fin to lie down in it, and\ncover himself up with the clothes.",
        "“You must pass for your own child,” said she; “so just lie there\nsnug, and say nothing, but be guided by me.”",
        "About two o’clock, as he had been expected, Cucullin came in. “God\nsave all here!” said he; “is this where the great Fin M’Coul lives?”",
        "“Indeed it is, honest man,” replied Oonagh; “God save you kindly–\nwon’t you be sitting?”",
        "“Thank you, ma’am,” says he, sitting down; “you’re Mrs. M’Coul, I\nsuppose?”",
        "“I am,” said she; “and I have no reason, I hope, to be ashamed of my\nhusband.”",
        "“No,” said the other, “he has the name of being the strongest and\nbravest man in Ireland; but for all that, there’s a man not far from\nyou that’s very desirous of taking a shake with him. Is he at home?”",
        "“Why, then, no,” she replied; “and if ever a man left his house in a\nfury, he did. It appears that some one told him of a big basthoon of\na–giant called Cucullin being down at the Causeway to look for him,\nand so he set out there to try if he could catch him. Troth, I hope,\nfor the poor giant’s sake, he won’t meet with him, for if he does,\nFin will make paste of him at once.”",
        "“Well,” said the other, “I am Cucullin, and I have been seeking him\nthese twelve months, but he always kept clear of me; and I will\nnever rest night or day till I lay my hands on him.”",
        "At this Oonagh set up a loud laugh, of great contempt, by-the-way,\nand looked at him as if he was only a mere handful of a man.",
        "“Did you ever see Fin?” said she, changing her manner all at once.",
        "“How could I?” said he; “he always took care to keep his distance.”",
        "“I thought so,” she replied; “I judged as much; and if you take my\nadvice, you poor-looking creature, you’ll pray night and day that\nyou may never see him, for I tell you it will be a black day for you\nwhen you do. But, in the meantime, you perceive that the wind’s on\nthe door, and as Fin himself is from home, maybe you’d be civil\nenough to turn the house, for it’s always what Fin does when he’s\nhere.”",
        "This was a startler even to Cucullin; but he got up, however, and\nafter pulling the middle finger of his right hand until it cracked\nthree times, he went outside, and getting his arms about the house,\nturned it as she had wished. When Fin saw this, he felt the sweat of\nfear oozing out through every pore of his skin; but Oonagh,\ndepending upon her woman’s wit, felt not a whit daunted.",
        "“Arrah, then,” said she, “as you are so civil, maybe you’d do\nanother obliging turn for us, as Fin’s not here to do it himself.\nYou see, after this long stretch of dry weather we’ve had, we feel\nvery badly off for want of water. Now, Fin says there’s a fine\nspring-well somewhere under the rocks behind the hill here below,\nand it was his intention to pull them asunder; but having heard of\nyou, he left the place in such a fury, that he never thought of it.\nNow, if you try to find it, troth I’d feel it a kindness.”",
        "She then brought Cucullin down to see the place, which was then all\none solid rock; and, after looking at it for some time, he cracked\nhis right middle finger nine times, and, stooping down, tore a cleft\nabout four hundred feet deep, and a quarter of a mile in length,\nwhich has since been christened by the name of Lumford’s Glen.",
        "“You’ll now come in,” said she, “and eat a bit of such humble fare\nas we can give you. Fin, even although he and you are enemies, would\nscorn not to treat you kindly in his own house; and, indeed, if I\ndidn’t do it even in his absence, he would not be pleased with me.”",
        "She accordingly brought him in, and placing half-a-dozen of the\ncakes we spoke of before him, together with a can or two of butter,\na side of boiled bacon, and a stack of cabbage, she desired him to\nhelp himself–for this, be it known, was long before the invention\nof potatoes. Cucullin put one of the cakes in his mouth to take a\nhuge whack out of it, when he made a thundering noise, something\nbetween a growl and a yell. “Blood and fury!” he shouted; “how is\nthis? Here are two of my teeth out! What kind of bread this is you\ngave me.”",
        "“What’s the matter?” said Oonagh coolly.",
        "“Matter!” shouted the other again; “why, here are the two best teeth\nin my head gone.”",
        "“Why,” said she, “that’s Fin’s bread–the only bread he ever eats\nwhen at home; but, indeed, I forgot to tell you that nobody can eat\nit but himself, and that child in the cradle there. I thought,\nhowever, that, as you were reported to be rather a stout little\nfellow of your size, you might be able to manage it, and I did not\nwish to affront a man that thinks himself able to fight Fin. Here’s\nanother cake–maybe it’s not so hard as that.”",
        "Cucullin at the moment was not only hungry, but ravenous, so he\naccordingly made a fresh set at the second cake, and immediately\nanother yell was heard twice as loud as the first. “Thunder and\ngibbets!” he roared, “take your bread out of this, or I will not\nhave a tooth in my head; there’s another pair of them gone!”",
        "“Well, honest man,” replied Oonagh, “if you’re not able to eat the\nbread, say so quietly, and don’t be wakening the child in the cradle\nthere. There, now, he’s awake upon me.”",
        "Fin now gave a skirl that startled the giant, as coming from such a\nyoungster as he was supposed to be.",
        "“Mother,” said he, “I’m hungry-get me something to eat.” Oonagh went\nover, and putting into his hand a cake that had no griddle in it,\nFin, whose appetite in the meantime had been sharpened by seeing\neating going forward, soon swallowed it. Cucullin was thunderstruck,\nand secretly thanked his stars that he had the good fortune to miss\nmeeting Fin, for, as he said to himself, “I’d have no chance with a\nman who could eat such bread as that, which even his son that’s but\nin his cradle can munch before my eyes.”",
        "“I’d like to take a glimpse at the lad in the cradle,” said he to\nOonagh; “for I can tell you that the infant who can manage that\nnutriment is no joke to look at, or to feed of a scarce summer.”",
        "“With all the veins of my heart,” replied Oonagh; “get up, acushla,\nand show this decent little man something that won’t be unworthy of\nyour father, Fin M’Coul.”",
        "Fin, who was dressed for the occasion as much like a boy as\npossible, got up, and bringing Cucullin out, “Are you strong?” said\nhe.",
        "“Thunder an’ ounds!” exclaimed the other, “what a voice in so small\na chap!”",
        "“Are you strong?” said Fin again; “are you able to squeeze water out\nof that white stone?” he asked, putting one into Cucullin’s hand.\nThe latter squeezed and squeezed the stone, but in vain.",
        "“Ah, you’re a poor creature!” said Fin. “You a giant! Give me the\nstone here, and when I’ll show what Fin’s little son can do, you may\nthen judge of what my daddy himself is.”",
        "Fin then took the stone, and exchanging it for the curds, he\nsqueezed the latter until the whey, as clear as water, oozed out in\na little shower from his hand.",
        "“I’ll now go in,” said he, “to my cradle; for I scorn to lose my\ntime with any one that’s not able to eat my daddy’s bread, or\nsqueeze water out of a stone. Bedad, you had better be off out of\nthis before he comes back; for if he catches you, it’s in flummery\nhe’d have you in two minutes.”",
        "Cucullin, seeing what he had seen, was of the same opinion himself;\nhis knees knocked together with the terror of Fin’s return, and he\naccordingly hastened to bid Oonagh farewell, and to assure her, that\nfrom that day out, he never wished to hear of, much less to see, her\nhusband. “I admit fairly that I’m not a match for him,” said he,\n“strong as I am; tell him I will avoid him as I would the plague,\nand that I will make myself scarce in this part of the country while\nI live.”",
        "Fin, in the meantime, had gone into the cradle, where he lay very\nquietly, his heart at his mouth with delight that Cucullin was about\nto take his departure, without discovering the tricks that had been\nplayed off on him.",
        "“It’s well for you,” said Oonagh, “that he doesn’t happen to be\nhere, for it’s nothing but hawk’s meat he’d make of you.”",
        "“I know that,” says Cucullin; “divil a thing else he’d make of me;\nbut before I go, will you let me feel what kind of teeth Fin’s lad\nhas got that can eat griddle-bread like that?”",
        "“With all pleasure in life,” said she; “only, as they’re far back in\nhis head, you must put your finger a good way in.”",
        "Cucullin was surprised to find such a powerful set of grinders in\none so young; but he was still much more so on finding, when he took\nhis hand from Fin’s mouth, that he had left the very finger upon\nwhich his whole strength depended, behind him. He gave one loud\ngroan, and fell down at once with terror and weakness. This was all\nFin wanted, who now knew that his most powerful and bitterest enemy\nwas at his mercy. He started out of the cradle, and in a few minutes\nthe great Cucullin, that was for such a length of time the terror of\nhim and all his followers, lay a corpse before him. Thus did Fin,\nthrough the wit and invention of Oonagh, his wife, succeed in\novercoming his enemy by cunning, which he never could have done by\nforce.",
