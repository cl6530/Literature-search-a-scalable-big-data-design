        "Prayer is a difficult matter, both in theory and in practice. But it\nis essential to learn to pray.",
        "It is important to recognize that the scope of Christian prayer is\nmuch wider than mere intercession or petition. It is the communion of\nthe soul with GOD, and its purpose is union with the life of GOD in\nidentity of purpose with His will. The beginning of prayer is a\nsursum corda, a lifting up of the heart to GOD. It is well to\nremember that true prayer is never a solitary act, even when a man\nprays in solitude. We pray not as individuals but as members of a\nFamily, and our prayer is spiritually united and knit together with\nthe common prayer-life of the universal Church, of which it forms a\npart. We pray, moreover, not to wrest to our private ends the purposes\nof GOD, not to induce Him, so to speak, to do our wills instead of\nHis, but to unite our wills with His will, as children who have\nconfidence in their Father. True prayer is offered in the Name of\nChrist–that is, it is prayed in His Spirit, according to His mind and\nwill. It can never, therefore, be selfish or self-centred. The Lord’s\nPrayer is its model and its type. A few words may be said in\nexplanation of this prayer.",
        "It begins with a recognition of the common Fatherhood of GOD. It is\nonly as members of His Family that we can approach Him: He is in no\nsense our personal or private GOD, but the common Father of us all.",
        "And our Father is “in heaven\"–that is, supreme, eternal, the Lord and\nRuler of all things. His Name is holy, and to be hallowed: it is in\nreverence and deepest worship that we bow before Him. He is King, and\nwe pray that His Kingship may be realized, in earth as it is in\nheaven: and that His will may be done–that is the supreme desire of\nour hearts, and the highest object of our petitions.",
        "And therefore we are vowed to His service: and because we are sure\nthat He will supply whatever we really need to that end, we pray in\nconfidence for daily needs both spiritual and bodily–\"Give us this\nday our daily bread.” And remembering that we are unprofitable and\nfaithless and disloyal servants we ask forgiveness for our sins, well\nknowing that we can only be forgiven as we ourselves are ready to\nforgive. And so looking to the future and mindful of our frailty we\npray that GOD will not lead us into “temptation” or trial, without at\nthe same time providing a way of deliverance from the assaults of\nevil. The prayer customarily ends with an ascription of praise and\nglory to GOD.",
        "That is the type and model of Christian prayer: and prayer is truly\nChristian just in so far as the spirit and temper of the Lord’s Prayer\ninspires it. We can only pray rightly in the Holy Spirit. “We know not\nwhat to pray for as we ought: but the Spirit helpeth our infirmities.”",
        "As for the technique of prayer, a man, on kneeling or standing to\npray, will do well to spend a short time first in silence and\nrecollection, waiting in stillness upon GOD, remembering His presence,\nHis holiness, His love, and His responsiveness to His children’s cry.\nLet him next make an act of adoration, spoken or unspoken, and invoke\nGOD the Holy Spirit to enable him to pray aright. Then let him pour\nout before GOD all that is in his heart, his troubles, his anxieties,\nhis perplexities, his sins: let him ask for forgiveness: let him give\nthanks: let him pray for the coming of GOD’S Kingdom, in its various\naspects: commending to GOD’S guidance and protection all right causes\nand aspirations in the world, in things both social and political and\ninternational, in things ecclesiastical, in things moral and religious\nand missionary: let him add personal and private intercessions for\nthose near and dear to him and for those whom he meets in the daily\nintercourse of life: and let him end as he began, in a few moments of\nquiet waiting upon GOD.",
        "That is the general scheme of a Christian’s private prayers. They\nshould include in due proportion the several elements of adoration,\nthanksgiving, penitence, petition, and intercession. They need not be\nlengthy. “Use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think\nthat they shall be heard for their much speaking.” It is quality and\nnot quantity of prayer that counts. And the prayers of a busy man must\nnecessarily be short.",
        "But it is worth while taking time and trouble over the ordering of\none’s prayers. A man’s intercessions, in particular, are not likely in\npractice to have the width, the range, and the variety which are\ndesirable, unless they are planned and ordered in accordance with a\ncoherent scheme which is thought out in advance. It is the part of\nwisdom to keep a note-book, in which names and subjects for\nintercessory prayer may be jotted down and distributed over the days\nof the week for use in due rotation. Such schemes, however, if drawn\nup and used, should be revised from time to time, and not suffered to\nbecome a mechanical burden or a legal bondage. There should be freedom\nand spontaneity in a Christian’s prayers. It is well to have rules,\nand to try not to be prevented by mere slackness from keeping them.\nBut it is important to see to it that the self-imposed rule is so\nframed as to prove genuinely conducive to reality in prayer, and\nsuitably adapted to opportunity and circumstance: and it is very often\na good thing from time to time, in the interests of freedom, quite\ndeliberately to break one’s rules.",
        "With regard to forms and methods of prayer, it is desirable that men\nshould learn to pray freely in their own words, or even in no words at\nall. Provided a man remembers reverence, he need not stand on ceremony\nwith GOD. But it is advisable also to use books and manuals of prayer\n–at any rate in the first instance: to use them, but not to be tied to\nthem. Many such manuals have been compiled and published within recent\nyears: the majority of them are unsatisfactory in varying degrees. A\nfew, however, can confidently be recommended: especially Prayers\nfor the City of God, compiled by G. C. Binyon (Longmans); Prayers\nfor Common Use (Universities Mission to Central Africa, Dartmouth\nSt., Westminster); and Sursum Corda, a Handbook of Intercession and\nThanksgiving, arranged by W. H. Frere and A. L. Illingworth (A. E.\nMowbray and Co., Ltd.).",
        "Prayer need not be confined to stated hours and times. Interpreting\nprayer at its widest, the ideal should be to “pray without ceasing.\"\nIt was said of an early Christian writer that his life was “one\ncontinuous prayer”: and it is well to form the habit of inwardly\nlifting up the heart to GOD from time to time in the midst of daily\ncares and business. Where Churches are kept open it is often possible\nin passing to spare time to enter and kneel for two or three minutes\nin quiet and recollection before GOD: but it is perfectly possible to\npray inwardly at any time and in any environment. Fixed times of\nprayer, nevertheless, there must also be: and a man should at least\npray in the morning upon rising and in the evening before going to\nbed. If a time can also be secured for midday prayer, so much the\nbetter: but this is more difficult. To have formed a really fixed and\nstable habit of daily prayer is an enormous step forwards in Christian\nlife. Much depends upon learning to rise regularly at a fixed hour\nbefore breakfast: and this in turn depends upon a regularity in going\nto bed, which under modern conditions of life it is not always easy to\nachieve. If a man is obliged to be up so late at night that it is\nmorally certain that he will be too tired to pray with much reality\nbefore turning in, he should endeavour, if it is at all possible, to\nsecure some time for prayer at an earlier stage in the evening.",
        "Difficulties in the life of prayer beset everybody. Thoughts have a\nway of wandering, the “saying” of prayers tends to become mechanical,\nmoods vary, and there are times in most men’s lives when they feel it\nalmost impossible to pray with any sense of reality. A man should not\nlightly be discouraged. He may be recommended to remind himself that\nGOD knows all about it, and that the resolute offering of his will to\nGOD at such times, in defiance of distraction and difficulty, has\nspecial value. It is well to take God into one’s confidence. “If GOD\nbores you, tell Him that He does.” He is no exacting tyrant, but a\nFather caring for His sons. Those who care to do so may find Prayer\nand some of its Difficulties, by the Rev. W. J. Carey (Mowbray &\nCo.), a helpful book to read in this connexion.",
        "A final word may be said with regard to a theoretical difficulty which\nmany people feel in connexion with the intercessory and petitionary\nsides of prayer. Since GOD’S will, it may be argued, is presumably\ngoing to be done in any case, and since He knows the real needs both\nof ourselves and of our friends better than we do, what is the point\nof praying for them? To many people it may be a sufficient practical\nanswer to refer to the example and precept of Christ, who both taught\nand practised intercessory prayer. But it is possible to go a little\nfurther, and to point out that it appears to be GOD’S will, not merely\nthat such and such a thing should be done, but that it should be done\nin response to our human prayers. True it is that “your Father knoweth\nwhat things ye have need of, before ye ask Him”: but our Lord\nemphasized this truth, not as a round for regarding prayer as futile\nor unnecessary, but as a reason for praying. For prayer is an\nexpression of the filial spirit towards our Father, and the more\nsimply and naturally we approach GOD as children, making our petitions\nbefore Him with childlike hearts, the more truly will our prayers be\nin accordance with that spirit of sonship which is the mind of Christ.\nAt the same time, the knowledge that our Father is wiser as well as\ngreater than we will forbid us to clamour for what in wisdom is denied\nus, and will in general govern the spirit and scope of our petitions.\nJust as our Lord points out that an earthly father, if asked for\nbread, will not give his child a stone, so conversely in the\nexperience of every Christian it often happens that in his blindness\nhe asks a stone, and is given bread. But no Christian will ask\ndeliberately and knowingly for stones.",
