        "In her home at Frankfurt, Clara, the little daughter of Herr\nSesemann, was lying on the invalid couch on which she spent her\nwhole day, being wheeled in it from room to room. Just now she\nwas in what was known as the study, where, to judge by the\nvarious things standing and lying about, which added to the cosy\nappearance of the room, the family was fond of sitting. A\nhandsome bookcase with glass doors explained why it was called\nthe study, and here evidently the little girl was accustomed to\nhave her lessons.",
        "Clara’s little face was thin and pale, and at this moment her\ntwo soft blue eyes were fixed on the clock, which seemed to her\nto go very slowly this day, and with a slight accent of\nimpatience, which was very rare with her, she asked, “Isn’t it\ntime yet, Fraulein Rottenmeier?”",
        "This lady was sitting very upright at a small work-table, busy\nwith her embroidery. She had on a mysterious-looking loose\ngarment, a large collar or shoulder-cape that gave a certain\nsolemnity to her appearance, which was enhanced by a very lofty\ndome-shaped head dress. For many years past, since the mistress\nof the house had died, the housekeeping and the superintendence\nof the servants had been entrusted by Herr Sesemann to Fraulein\nRottenmeier. He himself was often away from home, and he left\nher in sole charge, with the condition only that his little\ndaughter should have a voice in all matters, and that nothing\nshould be done against her wish.",
        "As Clara was putting her impatient question for the second time,\nDete and Heidi arrived at the front door, and the former\ninquired of the coachman, who had just got down from his box, if\nit was too late to see Fraulein Rottenmeier.",
        "“That’s not my business,” grumbled the coachman; “ring the bell\nin the hall for Sebastian.”",
        "Dete did so, and Sebastian came downstairs; he looked astonished\nwhen he saw her, opening his eyes till they were nearly as big\nas the large round buttons on his coat.",
        "“Is it too late for me to see Fraulein Rottenmeier?” Dete asked\nagain.",
        "“That’s not my business,” answered the man; “ring that other\nbell for the maid Tinette,” and without troubling himself any\nfarther Sebastian disappeared.",
        "Dete rang again. This time Tinette appeared with a spotless\nwhite cap perched on the top of her head and a mocking expression\nof face.",
        "“What is it?” she called from the top of the stairs. Dete\nrepeated her question. Tinette disappeared, but soon came back\nand called down again to Dete, “Come up, she is expecting you.”",
        "Dete and Heidi went upstairs and into the study, Tinette\nfollowing. Dete remained standing politely near the door, still\nholding Heidi tightly by the hand, for she did not know what the\nchild might take it into her head to do amid these new\nsurroundings.",
        "Fraulein Rottenmeier rose slowly and went up to the little new\ncompanion for the daughter of the house, to see what she was\nlike. She did not seem very pleased with her appearance. Heidi\nwas dressed in her plain little woollen frock, and her hat was\nan old straw one bent out of shape. The child looked innocently\nout from beneath it, gazing with unconcealed astonishment at the\nlady’s towering head dress.",
        "“What is your name?” asked Fraulein Rottenmeier, after\nscrutinisingly examining the child for some minutes, while Heidi\nin return kept her eyes steadily fixed upon the lady.",
        "“Heidi,” she answered in a clear, ringing voice.",
        "“What? what? that’s no Christian name for a child; you were not\nchristened that. What name did they give you when you were\nbaptized?” continued Fraulein Rottenmeier.",
        "“I do not remember,” replied Heidi.",
        "“What a way to answer!” said the lady, shaking her head. “Dete,\nis the child a simpleton or only saucy?”",
        "“If the lady will allow me, I will speak for the child, for she\nis very unaccustomed to strangers,” said Dete, who had given\nHeidi a silent poke for making such an unsuitable answer. “She\nis certainly not stupid nor yet saucy, she does not know what it\nmeans even; she speaks exactly as she thinks. To-day she is for\nthe first time in a gentleman’s house and she does not know good\nmanners; but she is docile and very willing to learn, if the\nlady will kindly make excuses for her. She was christened\nAdelaide, after her mother, my sister, who is now dead.”",
        "“Well, that’s a name that one can pronounce,” remarked Fraulein\nRottenmeier. “But I must tell you, Dete, that I am astonished to\nsee so young a child. I told you that I wanted a companion of\nthe same age as the young lady of the house, one who could share\nher lessons, and all her other occupations. Fraulein Clara is now\nover twelve; what age is this child?”",
        "“If the lady will allow me,” began Dete again, in her usual\nfluent manner, “I myself had lost count of her exact age; she is\ncertainly a little younger, but not much; I cannot say\nprecisely, but I think she is ten, or thereabouts.”",
        "“Grandfather told me I was eight,” put in Heidi. Dete gave her\nanother poke, but as the child had not the least idea why she\ndid so she was not at all confused.",
        "“What–only eight!” cried Fraulein Rottenmeier angrily. “Four\nyears too young! Of what use is such a child! And what have you\nlearnt? What books did you have to learn from?”",
        "“None,” said Heidi.",
        "“How? what? How then did you learn to read?” continued the lady.",
        "“I have never learnt to read, or Peter either,” Heidi informed\nher.",
        "“Mercy upon us! you do not know how to read! Is it really so?\"\nexclaimed Fraulein Rottenmeier, greatly horrified. “Is it\npossible–not able to read? What have you learnt then?”",
        "“Nothing,” said Heidi with unflinching truthfulness.",
        "“Young woman,” said the lady to Dete, after having paused for a\nminute or two to recover from her shock, “this is not at all the\nsort of companion you led me to suppose; how could you think of\nbringing me a child like this?”",
        "But Dete was not to be put down so easily, and answered warmly,\n“If the lady will allow me, the child is exactly what I thought\nshe required; the lady described what she wished for, a child\nunlike all other children, and I could find no other to suit,\nfor the greater number I know are not peculiar, but one very much\nthe same as the other, and I thought this child seemed as if made\nfor the place. But I must go now, for my mistress will be waiting\nfor me; if the lady will permit I will come again soon and see\nhow she is getting on.” And with a bow Dete quickly left the room\nand ran downstairs. Fraulein Rottenmeier stood for a moment taken\naback and then ran after Dete. If the child was to stop she had\nmany things yet to say and ask about her, and there the child\nwas, and what was more, Dete, as she plainly saw, meant to leave\nher there.",
        "Heidi remained by the door where she had been standing since she\nfirst came in. Clara had looked on during the interview without\nspeaking; now she beckoned to Heidi and said, “Come here!”",
        "Heidi went up to her.",
        "“Would you rather be called Heidi or Adelaide?” asked Clara.",
        "“I am never called anything but Heidi,” was the child’s prompt\nanswer.",
        "“Then I shall always call you by that name,” said Clara, “it\nsuits you. I have never heard it before, but neither have I ever\nseen a child like you before. Have you always had that short\ncurly hair?”",
        "“Yes, I think so,” said Heidi.",
        "“Are you pleased to come to Frankfurt?” went on Clara.",
        "“No, but I shall go home to-morrow and take grandmother a white\nloaf,” explained Heidi.",
        "“Well, you are a funny child!” exclaimed Clara. “You were\nexpressly sent for to come here and to remain with me and share\nmy lessons; there will be some fun about them now as you cannot\nread, something new to do, for often they are dreadfully dull,\nand I think the morning will never pass away. You know my tutor\ncomes every morning at about ten o’clock, and then we go on with\nlessons till two, and it does seem such a long time. Sometimes\nhe takes up the book and holds it close up to his face, as if he\nwas very short-sighted, but I know it’s only because he wants so\ndreadfully to gape, and Fraulein Rottenmeier takes her large\nhandkerchief out also now and then and covers her face with it,\nas if she was moved by what we had been reading, but that is\nonly because she is longing to gape too. And I myself often want\nto gape, but I am obliged to stop myself, for if Fraulein\nRottenmeier sees me gaping she runs off at once and fetches the\ncod-liver oil and says I must have a dose, as I am getting weak\nagain, and the cod-liver oil is horrible, so I do my best not to\ngape. But now it will be much more amusing, for I shall be able\nto lie and listen while you learn to read.”",
        "Heidi shook her head doubtfully when she heard of learning to\nread.",
        "“Oh, nonsense, Heidi, of course you must learn to read,\neverybody must, and my tutor is very kind, and never cross, and\nhe will explain everything to you. But mind, when he explains\nanything to you, you won’t be able to understand; but don’t ask\nany questions, or else he will go on explaining and you will\nunderstand less than ever. Later when you have learnt more and\nknow about things yourself, then you will begin to understand\nwhat he meant.”",
        "Fraulein Rottenmeier now came back into the room; she had not\nbeen able to overtake Dete, and was evidently very much put out;\nfor she had wanted to go into more details concerning the child,\nand to convince Dete how misleading she had been, and how unfit\nHeidi was as a companion for Clara; she really did not know what\nto be about, or how to undo the mischief, and it made her all\nthe more angry that she herself was responsible for it, having\nconsented to Heidi being fetched. She ran backwards and forwards\nin a state of agitation between the study and the dining-room,\nand then began scolding Sebastian, who was standing looking at\nthe table he had just finished laying to see that nothing was\nmissing.",
        "“You can finish your thoughts to-morrow morning; make haste, or\nwe shall get no dinner to-day at all.”",
        "Then hurrying out she called Tinette, but in such an ill-\ntempered voice that the maid came tripping forward with even more\nmincing steps than usual, but she looked so pert that even\nFraulein Rottenmeier did not venture to scold her, which only\nmade her suppressed anger the greater.",
        "“See that the room is prepared for the little girl who has just\narrived,” said the lady, with a violent effort at self-control.\n“Everything is ready; it only wants dusting.”",
        "“It’s worth my troubling about,” said Tinette mockingly as she\nturned away.",
        "Meanwhile Sebastian had flung open the folding doors leading\ninto the dining-room with rather more noise than he need, for he\nwas feeling furious, although he did not dare answer back when\nFraulein Rottenmeier spoke to him; he then went up to Clara’s\nchair to wheel her into the next room. As he was arranging the\nhandle at the back preparatory to doing so, Heidi went near and\nstood staring at him. Seeing her eyes fixed upon him, he\nsuddenly growled out, “Well, what is there in me to stare at like\nthat?” which he would certainly not have done if he had been\naware that Fraulein Rottenmeier was just then entering the room.\n“You look so like Peter,” answered Heidi. The lady-housekeeper\nclasped her hands in horror. “Is it possible!” she stammered half-\naloud, “she is now addressing the servant as if he were a friend!\nI never could have imagined such a child!”",
        "Sebastian wheeled the couch into the dining-room and helped\nClara on to her chair. Fraulein Rottenmeier took the seat beside\nher and made a sign to Heidi to take the one opposite. They were\nthe only three at table, and as they sat far apart there was\nplenty of room for Sebastian to hand his dishes. Beside Heidi’s\nplate lay a nice white roll, and her eyes lighted up with\npleasure as she saw it. The resemblance which Heidi had noticed\nhad evidently awakened in her a feeling of confidence towards\nSebastian, for she sat as still as a mouse and without moving\nuntil he came up to her side and handed her the dish of fish;\nthen she looked at the roll and asked, “Can I have it?” Sebastian\nnodded, throwing a side glance at Fraulein Rottenmeier to see\nwhat effect this request would have upon her. Heidi immediately\nseized the roll and put it in her pocket. Sebastian’s face became\nconvulsed, he was overcome with inward laughter but knew his\nplace too well to laugh aloud. Mute and motionless he still\nremained standing beside Heidi; it was not his duty to speak, nor\nto move away until she had helped herself. Heidi looked\nwonderingly at him for a minute or two, and then said, “Am I to\neat some of that too?” Sebastian nodded again. “Give me some\nthen,” she said, looking calmly at her plate. At this Sebastian’s\ncommand of his countenance became doubtful, and the dish began to\ntremble suspiciously in his hands.",
        "“You can put the dish on the table and come back presently,\"\nsaid Fraulein Rottenmeier with a severe expression of face.\nSebastian disappeared on the spot. “As for you, Adelaide, I see I\nshall have to teach you the first rules of behavior,” continued\nthe lady-housekeeper with a sigh. “I will begin by explaining to\nyou how you are to conduct yourself at table,” and she went on to\ngive Heidi minute instructions as to all she was to do. “And\nnow,” she continued, “I must make you particularly understand\nthat you are not to speak to Sebastian at table, or at any other\ntime, unless you have an order to give him, or a necessary\nquestion to put to him; and then you are not to address him as\nif he was some one belonging to you. Never let me hear you speak\nto him in that way again! It is the same with Tinette, and for\nmyself you are to address me as you hear others doing. Clara\nmust herself decide what you are to call her.”",
        "“Why, Clara, of course,” put the latter. Then followed a long\nlist of rules as to general behavior, getting up and going to\nbed, going in and out of the room, shutting the doors, keeping\neverything tidy, during the course of which Heidi’s eyes\ngradually closed, for she had been up before five o’clock that\nmorning and had had a long journey. She leant back in her chair\nand fell fast asleep. Fraulein Rottenmeier having at last come\nto the end of her sermonizing said, “Now remember what I have\nsaid, Adelaide! Have you understood it all?”",
        "“Heidi has been asleep for ever so long,” said Clara, her face\nrippling all over with amusement, for she had not had such an\nentertaining dinner for a long time.",
        "“It is really insupportable what one has to go through with this\nchild,” exclaimed Fraulein Rottenmeier, in great indignation,\nand she rang the bell so violently that Tinette and Sebastian\nboth came running in and nearly tumbling over one another; but no\nnoise was sufficient to wake Heidi, and it was with difficulty\nthey could rouse her sufficiently to get her along to her\nbedroom, to reach which she had to pass first through the study,\nthen through Clara’s bedroom, then through Fraulein Rottenmeier’s\nsitting-room, till she came to the corner room that had been set\napart for her.",
