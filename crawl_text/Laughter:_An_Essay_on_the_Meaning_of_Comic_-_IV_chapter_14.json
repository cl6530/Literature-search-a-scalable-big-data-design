        "Eager as we have been to discover the deep-seated cause of the\ncomic, we have so far had to neglect one of its most striking\nphenomena. We refer to the logic peculiar to the comic character and\nthe comic group, a strange kind of logic, which, in some cases, may\ninclude a good deal of absurdity.",
        "Theophile Gautier said that the comic in its extreme form was the\nlogic of the absurd. More than one philosophy of laughter revolves\nround a like idea. Every comic effect, it is said, implies\ncontradiction in some of its aspects. What makes us laugh is alleged\nto be the absurd realised in concrete shape, a “palpable\nabsurdity\";--or, again, an apparent absurdity, which we swallow for\nthe moment only to rectify it immediately afterwards;--or, better\nstill, something absurd from one point of view though capable of a\nnatural explanation from another, etc. All these theories may\ncontain some portion of the truth; but, in the first place, they\napply only to certain rather obvious comic effects, and then, even\nwhere they do apply, they evidently take no account of the\ncharacteristic element of the laughable, that is, the PARTICULAR\nKIND of absurdity the comic contains when it does contain something\nabsurd. Is an immediate proof of this desired? You have only to\nchoose one of these definitions and make up effects in accordance\nwith the formula: twice out of every three times there will be\nnothing laughable in the effect obtained. So we see that absurdity,\nwhen met with in the comic, is not absurdity IN GENERAL. It is an\nabsurdity of a definite kind. It does not create the comic; rather,\nwe might say that the comic infuses into it its own particular\nessence. It is not a cause, but an effect--an effect of a very\nspecial kind, which reflects the special nature of its cause. Now,\nthis cause is known to us; consequently we shall have no trouble in\nunderstanding the nature of the effect.",
        "Assume, when out for a country walk, that you notice on the top of a\nhill something that bears a faint resemblance to a large motionless\nbody with revolving arms. So far you do not know what it is, but you\nbegin to search amongst your IDEAS--that is to say, in the present\ninstance, amongst the recollections at your disposal--for that\nrecollection which will best fit in with what you see. Almost\nimmediately the image of a windmill comes into your mind: the object\nbefore you is a windmill. No matter if, before leaving the house,\nyou have just been reading fairy-tales telling of giants with\nenormous arms; for although common sense consists mainly in being\nable to remember, it consists even more in being able to forget.\nCommon sense represents the endeavour of a mind continually adapting\nitself anew and changing ideas when it changes objects. It is the\nmobility of the intelligence conforming exactly to the mobility of\nthings. It is the moving continuity of our attention to life. But\nnow, let us take Don Quixote setting out for the wars. The romances\nhe has been reading all tell of knights encountering, on the way,\ngiant adversaries. He therefore must needs encounter a giant. This\nidea of a giant is a privileged recollection which has taken its\nabode in his mind and lies there in wait, motionless, watching for\nan opportunity to sally forth and become embodied in a thing. It IS\nBENT on entering the material world, and so the very first object he\nsees bearing the faintest resemblance to a giant is invested with\nthe form of one. Thus Don Quixote sees giants where we see\nwindmills. This is comical; it is also absurd. But is it a mere\nabsurdity,--an absurdity of an indefinite kind?",
        "It is a very special inversion of common sense. It consists in\nseeking to mould things on an idea of one’s own, instead of moulding\none’s ideas on things,--in seeing before us what we are thinking of,\ninstead of thinking of what we see. Good sense would have us leave\nall our memories in their proper rank and file; then the appropriate\nmemory will every time answer the summons of the situation of the\nmoment and serve only to interpret it. But in Don Quixote, on the\ncontrary, there is one group of memories in command of all the rest\nand dominating the character itself: thus it is reality that now has\nto bow to imagination, its only function being to supply fancy with\na body. Once the illusion has been created, Don Quixote develops it\nlogically enough in all its consequences; he proceeds with the\ncertainty and precision of a somnambulist who is acting his dream.\nSuch, then, is the origin of his delusions, and such the particular\nlogic which controls this particular absurdity. Now, is this logic\npeculiar to Don Quixote?",
        "We have shown that the comic character always errs through obstinacy\nof mind or of disposition, through absentmindedness, in short,\nthrough automatism. At the root of the comic there is a sort of\nrigidity which compels its victims to keep strictly to one path, to\nfollow it straight along, to shut their ears and refuse to listen.\nIn Moliere’s plays how many comic scenes can be reduced to this\nsimple type: A CHARACTER FOLLOWING UP HIS ONE IDEA, and continually\nrecurring to it in spite of incessant interruptions! The transition\nseems to take place imperceptibly from the man who will listen to\nnothing to the one who will see nothing, and from this latter to the\none who sees only what he wants to see. A stubborn spirit ends by\nadjusting things to its own way of thinking, instead of\naccommodating its thoughts to the things. So every comic character\nis on the highroad to the above-mentioned illusion, and Don Quixote\nfurnishes us with the general type of comic absurdity.",
        "Is there a name for this inversion of common sense? Doubtless it may\nbe found, in either an acute or a chronic form, in certain types of\ninsanity. In many of its aspects it resembles a fixed idea. But\nneither insanity in general, nor fixed ideas in particular, are\nprovocative of laughter: they are diseases, and arouse our pity.",
        "Laughter, as we have seen, is incompatible with emotion. If there\nexists a madness that is laughable, it can only be one compatible\nwith the general health of the mind,--a sane type of madness, one\nmight say. Now, there is a sane state of the mind that resembles\nmadness in every respect, in which we find the same associations of\nideas as we do in lunacy, the same peculiar logic as in a fixed\nidea. This state is that of dreams. So either our analysis is\nincorrect, or it must be capable of being stated in the following\ntheorem: Comic absurdity is of the same nature as that of dreams.",
        "The behaviour of the intellect in a dream is exactly what we have\njust been describing. The mind, enamoured of itself, now seeks in\nthe outer world nothing more than a pretext for realising its\nimaginations. A confused murmur of sounds still reaches the ear,\ncolours enter the field of vision, the senses are not completely\nshut in. But the dreamer, instead of appealing to the whole of his\nrecollections for the interpretation of what his senses perceive,\nmakes use of what he perceives to give substance to the particular\nrecollection he favours: thus, according to the mood of the dreamer\nand the idea that fills his imagination at the time, a gust of wind\nblowing down the chimney becomes the howl of a wild beast or a\ntuneful melody. Such is the ordinary mechanism of illusion in\ndreams.",
        "Now, if comic illusion is similar to dream illusion, if the logic of\nthe comic is the logic of dreams, we may expect to discover in the\nlogic of the laughable all the peculiarities of dream logic. Here,\nagain, we shall find an illustration of the law with which we are\nwell acquainted: given one form of the laughable, other forms that\nare lacking in the same comic essence become laughable from their\noutward resemblance to the first. Indeed, it is not difficult to see\nthat any PLAY OF IDEAS may afford us amusement if only it bring back\nto mind, more or less distinctly, the play of dreamland.",
        "We shall first call attention to a certain general relaxation of the\nrules of reasoning. The reasonings at which we laugh are those we\nknow to be false, but which we might accept as true were we to hear\nthem in a dream. They counterfeit true reasoning just sufficiently\nto deceive a mind dropping off to sleep. There is still an element\nof logic in them, if you will, but it is a logic lacking in tension\nand, for that very reason, affording us relief from intellectual\neffort. Many “witticisms” are reasonings of this kind, considerably\nabridged reasonings, of which we are given only the beginning and\nthe end. Such play upon ideas evolves in the direction of a play\nupon words in proportion as the relations set up between the ideas\nbecome more superficial: gradually we come to take no account of the\nmeaning of the words we hear, but only of their sound. It might be\ninstructive to compare with dreams certain comic scenes in which one\nof the characters systematically repeats in a nonsensical fashion\nwhat another character whispers in his ear. If you fall asleep with\npeople talking round you, you sometimes find that what they say\ngradually becomes devoid of meaning, that the sounds get distorted,\nas it were, and recombine in a haphazard fashion to form in your\nmind the strangest of meanings, and that you are reproducing between\nyourself and the different speakers the scene between Petit-Jean and\nThe Prompter. [Footnote: Les Plaideurs (Racine).]",
        "There are also COMIC OBSESSIONS that seem to bear a great\nresemblance to dream obsessions. Who has not had the experience of\nseeing the same image appear in several successive dreams, assuming\na plausible meaning in each of them, whereas these dreams had no\nother point in common. Effects of repetition sometimes present this\nspecial form on the stage or in fiction: some of them, in fact,\nsound as though they belonged to a dream. It may be the same with\nthe burden of many a song: it persistently recurs, always unchanged,\nat the end of every verse, each time with a different meaning.",
        "Not infrequently do we notice in dreams a particular CRESCENDO, a\nweird effect that grows more pronounced as we proceed. The first\nconcession extorted from reason introduces a second; and this one,\nanother of a more serious nature; and so on till the crowning\nabsurdity is reached. Now, this progress towards the absurd produces\non the dreamer a very peculiar sensation. Such is probably the\nexperience of the tippler when he feels himself pleasantly drifting\ninto a state of blankness in which neither reason nor propriety has\nany meaning for him. Now, consider whether some of Moliere’s plays\nwould not produce the same sensation: for instance, Monsieur de\nPourceaugnac, which, after beginning almost reasonably, develops\ninto a sequence of all sorts of absurdities. Consider also the\nBourgeois gentilhomme, where the different characters seem to allow\nthemselves to be caught up in a very whirlwind of madness as the\nplay proceeds. “If it is possible to find a man more completely mad,\nI will go and publish it in Rome.” This sentence, which warns us\nthat the play is over, rouses us from the increasingly extravagant\ndream into which, along with M. Jourdain, we have been sinking.",
        "But, above all, there is a special madness that is peculiar to\ndreams. There are certain special contradictions so natural to the\nimagination of a dreamer, and so absurd to the reason of a man wide-\nawake, that it would be impossible to give a full and correct idea\nof their nature to anyone who had not experienced them. We allude to\nthe strange fusion that a dream often effects between two persons\nwho henceforth form only one and yet remain distinct. Generally one\nof these is the dreamer himself. He feels he has not ceased to be\nwhat he is; yet he has become someone else. He is himself, and not\nhimself. He hears himself speak and sees himself act, but he feels\nthat some other “he” has borrowed his body and stolen his voice. Or\nperhaps he is conscious of speaking and acting as usual, but he\nspeaks of himself as a stranger with whom he has nothing in common;\nhe has stepped out of his own self. Does it not seem as though we\nfound this same extraordinary confusion in many a comic scene? I am\nnot speaking of Amphitryon, in which play the confusion is perhaps\nsuggested to the mind of the spectator, though the bulk of the comic\neffect proceeds rather from what we have already called a\n“reciprocal interference of two series.” I am speaking of the\nextravagant and comic reasonings in which we really meet with this\nconfusion in its pure form, though it requires some looking into to\npick it out. For instance, listen to Mark Twain’s replies to the\nreporter who called to interview him:",
        "QUESTION. Isn’t that a brother of yours? ANSWER. Oh! yes, yes, yes!\nNow you remind me of it, that WAS a brother of mine. That’s William-\n-BILL we called him. Poor old Bill!",
        "Q. Why? Is he dead, then? A. Ah! well, I suppose so. We never could\ntell. There was a great mystery about it.",
        "Q. That is sad, very sad. He disappeared, then? A. Well, yes, in a\nsort of general way. We buried him.",
        "Q. BURIED him! BURIED him, without knowing whether he was dead or\nnot? A. Oh no! Not that. He was dead enough.",
        "Q. Well, I confess that I can’t understand this. If you buried him,\nand you knew he was dead--A. No! no! We only thought he was.",
        "Q. Oh, I see! He came to life again? A. I bet he didn’t.",
        "Q. Well, I never heard anything like this. SOMEBODY was dead.\nSOMEBODY was buried. Now, where was the mystery? A. Ah! that’s just\nit! That’s it exactly. You see, we were twins,--defunct and I,--and\nwe got mixed in the bath-tub when we were only two weeks old, and\none of us was drowned. But we didn’t know which. Some think it was\nBill. Some think it was me.",
        "Q. Well, that is remarkable. What do YOU think? A. Goodness knows! I\nwould give whole worlds to know. This solemn, this awful tragedy has\ncast a gloom over my whole life. But I will tell you a secret now,\nwhich I have never revealed to any creature before. One of us had a\npeculiar mark,--a large mole on the back of his left hand: that was\nME. THAT CHILD WAS THE ONE THAT WAS DROWNED! ... etc., etc.",
        "A close examination will show us that the absurdity of this dialogue\nis by no means an absurdity of an ordinary type. It would disappear\nwere not the speaker himself one of the twins in the story. It\nresults entirely from the fact that Mark Twain asserts he is one of\nthese twins, whilst all the time he talks as though he were a third\nperson who tells the tale. In many of our dreams we adopt exactly\nthe same method.",
