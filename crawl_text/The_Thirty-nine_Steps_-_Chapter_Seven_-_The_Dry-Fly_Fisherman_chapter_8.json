        "I sat down on a hill-top and took stock of my position.  I wasn’t\nfeeling very happy, for my natural thankfulness at my escape was\nclouded by my severe bodily discomfort.  Those lentonite fumes had\nfairly poisoned me, and the baking hours on the dovecot hadn’t\nhelped matters.  I had a crushing headache, and felt as sick as a cat.\nAlso my shoulder was in a bad way.  At first I thought it was only a\nbruise, but it seemed to be swelling, and I had no use of my left arm.",
        "My plan was to seek Mr Turnbull’s cottage, recover my garments,\nand especially Scudder’s note-book, and then make for the main\nline and get back to the south.  It seemed to me that the sooner I\ngot in touch with the Foreign Office man, Sir Walter Bullivant, the\nbetter.  I didn’t see how I could get more proof than I had got\nalready.  He must just take or leave my story, and anyway, with him\nI would be in better hands than those devilish Germans.  I had\nbegun to feel quite kindly towards the British police.",
        "It was a wonderful starry night, and I had not much difficulty\nabout the road.  Sir Harry’s map had given me the lie of the land,\nand all I had to do was to steer a point or two west of south-west\nto come to the stream where I had met the roadman.  In all these\ntravels I never knew the names of the places, but I believe this\nstream was no less than the upper waters of the river Tweed.  I\ncalculated I must be about eighteen miles distant, and that meant I\ncould not get there before morning.  So I must lie up a day somewhere,\nfor I was too outrageous a figure to be seen in the sunlight.\nI had neither coat, waistcoat, collar, nor hat, my trousers were\nbadly torn, and my face and hands were black with the explosion.  I\ndaresay I had other beauties, for my eyes felt as if they were\nfuriously bloodshot.  Altogether I was no spectacle for God-fearing\ncitizens to see on a highroad.",
        "Very soon after daybreak I made an attempt to clean myself in a\nhill burn, and then approached a herd’s cottage, for I was feeling\nthe need of food.  The herd was away from home, and his wife was\nalone, with no neighbour for five miles.  She was a decent old body,\nand a plucky one, for though she got a fright when she saw me, she\nhad an axe handy, and would have used it on any evil-doer.  I told\nher that I had had a fall–I didn’t say how–and she saw by my\nlooks that I was pretty sick.  Like a true Samaritan she asked no\nquestions, but gave me a bowl of milk with a dash of whisky in it,\nand let me sit for a little by her kitchen fire.  She would have bathed\nmy shoulder, but it ached so badly that I would not let her touch it.",
        "I don’t know what she took me for–a repentant burglar,\nperhaps; for when I wanted to pay her for the milk and tendered a\nsovereign which was the smallest coin I had, she shook her head\nand said something about ’giving it to them that had a right to it’.\nAt this I protested so strongly that I think she believed me honest,\nfor she took the money and gave me a warm new plaid for it, and\nan old hat of her man’s.  She showed me how to wrap the plaid\naround my shoulders, and when I left that cottage I was the living\nimage of the kind of Scotsman you see in the illustrations to\nBurns’s poems.  But at any rate I was more or less clad.",
        "It was as well, for the weather changed before midday to a thick\ndrizzle of rain.  I found shelter below an overhanging rock in the\ncrook of a burn, where a drift of dead brackens made a tolerable\nbed.  There I managed to sleep till nightfall, waking very cramped\nand wretched, with my shoulder gnawing like a toothache.  I ate the\noatcake and cheese the old wife had given me and set out again just\nbefore the darkening.",
        "I pass over the miseries of that night among the wet hills.  There\nwere no stars to steer by, and I had to do the best I could from my\nmemory of the map.  Twice I lost my way, and I had some nasty\nfalls into peat-bogs.  I had only about ten miles to go as the crow\nflies, but my mistakes made it nearer twenty.  The last bit was\ncompleted with set teeth and a very light and dizzy head.  But I\nmanaged it, and in the early dawn I was knocking at Mr Turnbull’s\ndoor.  The mist lay close and thick, and from the cottage I could\nnot see the highroad.",
        "Mr Turnbull himself opened to me–sober and something more\nthan sober.  He was primly dressed in an ancient but well-tended\nsuit of black; he had been shaved not later than the night before; he\nwore a linen collar; and in his left hand he carried a pocket Bible.\nAt first he did not recognize me.",
        "’Whae are ye that comes stravaigin’ here on the Sabbath mornin’?’\nhe asked.",
        "I had lost all count of the days.  So the Sabbath was the reason\nfor this strange decorum.",
        "My head was swimming so wildly that I could not frame a\ncoherent answer.  But he recognized me, and he saw that I was ill.",
        "’Hae ye got my specs?’ he asked.",
        "I fetched them out of my trouser pocket and gave him them.",
        "’Ye’ll hae come for your jaicket and westcoat,’ he said.  ’Come in-\nbye.  Losh, man, ye’re terrible dune i’ the legs.  Haud up till I get ye\nto a chair.’",
        "I perceived I was in for a bout of malaria.  I had a good deal of\nfever in my bones, and the wet night had brought it out, while my\nshoulder and the effects of the fumes combined to make me feel\npretty bad.  Before I knew, Mr Turnbull was helping me off with\nmy clothes, and putting me to bed in one of the two cupboards that\nlined the kitchen walls.",
        "He was a true friend in need, that old roadman.  His wife was\ndead years ago, and since his daughter’s marriage he lived alone.",
        "For the better part of ten days he did all the rough nursing I\nneeded.  I simply wanted to be left in peace while the fever took its\ncourse, and when my skin was cool again I found that the bout had\nmore or less cured my shoulder.  But it was a baddish go, and\nthough I was out of bed in five days, it took me some time to get\nmy legs again.",
        "He went out each morning, leaving me milk for the day, and\nlocking the door behind him; and came in in the evening to sit\nsilent in the chimney corner.  Not a soul came near the place.  When\nI was getting better, he never bothered me with a question.  Several\ntimes he fetched me a two days’ old SCOTSMAN, and I noticed that the\ninterest in the Portland Place murder seemed to have died down.\nThere was no mention of it, and I could find very little about\nanything except a thing called the General Assembly–some\necclesiastical spree, I gathered.",
        "One day he produced my belt from a lockfast drawer.  ’There’s a\nterrible heap o’ siller in’t,’ he said.  ’Ye’d better coont it to see\nit’s a’ there.’",
        "He never even sought my name.  I asked him if anybody had\nbeen around making inquiries subsequent to my spell at the road-making.",
        "’Ay, there was a man in a motor-cawr.  He speired whae had ta’en\nmy place that day, and I let on I thocht him daft.  But he keepit on\nat me, and syne I said he maun be thinkin’ o’ my gude-brither frae\nthe Cleuch that whiles lent me a haun’.  He was a wersh-lookin’\nsowl, and I couldna understand the half o’ his English tongue.’",
        "I was getting restless those last days, and as soon as I felt myself\nfit I decided to be off.  That was not till the twelfth day of June,\nand as luck would have it a drover went past that morning taking\nsome cattle to Moffat.  He was a man named Hislop, a friend of\nTurnbull’s, and he came in to his breakfast with us and offered to\ntake me with him.",
        "I made Turnbull accept five pounds for my lodging, and a hard\njob I had of it.  There never was a more independent being.  He\ngrew positively rude when I pressed him, and shy and red, and\ntook the money at last without a thank you.  When I told him how\nmuch I owed him, he grunted something about ’ae guid turn\ndeservin’ anither’.  You would have thought from our leave-taking\nthat we had parted in disgust.",
        "Hislop was a cheery soul, who chattered all the way over the pass\nand down the sunny vale of Annan.  I talked of Galloway markets\nand sheep prices, and he made up his mind I was a ’pack-shepherd’\nfrom those parts–whatever that may be.  My plaid and my old hat,\nas I have said, gave me a fine theatrical Scots look.  But driving\ncattle is a mortally slow job, and we took the better part of the day\nto cover a dozen miles.",
        "If I had not had such an anxious heart I would have enjoyed that\ntime.  It was shining blue weather, with a constantly changing\nprospect of brown hills and far green meadows, and a continual\nsound of larks and curlews and falling streams.  But I had no mind\nfor the summer, and little for Hislop’s conversation, for as the\nfateful fifteenth of June drew near I was overweighed with the\nhopeless difficulties of my enterprise.",
        "I got some dinner in a humble Moffat public-house, and walked\nthe two miles to the junction on the main line.  The night express\nfor the south was not due till near midnight, and to fill up the time\nI went up on the hillside and fell asleep, for the walk had tired me.\nI all but slept too long, and had to run to the station and catch the\ntrain with two minutes to spare.  The feel of the hard third-class\ncushions and the smell of stale tobacco cheered me up wonderfully.\nAt any rate, I felt now that I was getting to grips with my job.",
        "I was decanted at Crewe in the small hours and had to wait till six to\nget a train for Birmingham.  In the afternoon I got to Reading, and\nchanged into a local train which journeyed into the deeps of Berkshire.\nPresently I was in a land of lush water-meadows and slow\nreedy streams.  About eight o’clock in the evening, a weary and\ntravel-stained being–a cross between a farm-labourer and a vet–\nwith a checked black-and-white plaid over his arm (for I did not\ndare to wear it south of the Border), descended at the little station\nof Artinswell.  There were several people on the platform, and I\nthought I had better wait to ask my way till I was clear of the place.",
        "The road led through a wood of great beeches and then into a\nshallow valley, with the green backs of downs peeping over the\ndistant trees.  After Scotland the air smelt heavy and flat, but\ninfinitely sweet, for the limes and chestnuts and lilac bushes were domes\nof blossom.  Presently I came to a bridge, below which a clear slow\nstream flowed between snowy beds of water-buttercups.  A little\nabove it was a mill; and the lasher made a pleasant cool sound in\nthe scented dusk.  Somehow the place soothed me and put me at my\nease.  I fell to whistling as I looked into the green depths, and the\ntune which came to my lips was ’Annie Laurie’.",
        "A fisherman came up from the waterside, and as he neared me he\ntoo began to whistle.  The tune was infectious, for he followed my\nsuit.  He was a huge man in untidy old flannels and a wide-brimmed\nhat, with a canvas bag slung on his shoulder.  He nodded to me,\nand I thought I had never seen a shrewder or better-tempered face.\nHe leaned his delicate ten-foot split-cane rod against the bridge,\nand looked with me at the water.",
        "’Clear, isn’t it?’ he said pleasantly.  ’I back our Kenner any day\nagainst the Test.  Look at that big fellow.  Four pounds if he’s an\nounce.  But the evening rise is over and you can’t tempt ’em.’",
        "’I don’t see him,’ said I.",
        "’Look!  There!  A yard from the reeds just above that stickle.’",
        "’I’ve got him now.  You might swear he was a black stone.’",
        "’So,’ he said, and whistled another bar of ’Annie Laurie’.",
        "’Twisdon’s the name, isn’t it?’ he said over his shoulder, his eyes\nstill fixed on the stream.",
        "’No,’ I said.  ’I mean to say, Yes.’  I had forgotten all about\nmy alias.",
        "’It’s a wise conspirator that knows his own name,’ he observed,\ngrinning broadly at a moor-hen that emerged from the bridge’s shadow.",
        "I stood up and looked at him, at the square, cleft jaw and broad,\nlined brow and the firm folds of cheek, and began to think that\nhere at last was an ally worth having.  His whimsical blue eyes\nseemed to go very deep.",
        "Suddenly he frowned.  ’I call it disgraceful,’ he said, raising his\nvoice.  ’Disgraceful that an able-bodied man like you should dare to\nbeg.  You can get a meal from my kitchen, but you’ll get no money\nfrom me.’",
        "A dog-cart was passing, driven by a young man who raised his\nwhip to salute the fisherman.  When he had gone, he picked up his rod.",
        "’That’s my house,’ he said, pointing to a white gate a hundred\nyards on.  ’Wait five minutes and then go round to the back door.’\nAnd with that he left me.",
        "I did as I was bidden.  I found a pretty cottage with a lawn\nrunning down to the stream, and a perfect jungle of guelder-rose\nand lilac flanking the path.  The back door stood open, and a grave\nbutler was awaiting me.",
        "’Come this way, Sir,’ he said, and he led me along a passage and\nup a back staircase to a pleasant bedroom looking towards the\nriver.  There I found a complete outfit laid out for me–dress\nclothes with all the fixings, a brown flannel suit, shirts, collars, ties,\nshaving things and hair-brushes, even a pair of patent shoes.  ’Sir\nWalter thought as how Mr Reggie’s things would fit you, Sir,’ said\nthe butler.  ’He keeps some clothes ’ere, for he comes regular on the\nweek-ends.  There’s a bathroom next door, and I’ve prepared a ’ot\nbath.  Dinner in ’alf an hour, Sir.  You’ll ’ear the gong.’",
        "The grave being withdrew, and I sat down in a chintz-covered\neasy-chair and gaped.  It was like a pantomime, to come suddenly out\nof beggardom into this orderly comfort.  Obviously Sir Walter\nbelieved in me, though why he did I could not guess.  I looked at\nmyself in the mirror and saw a wild, haggard brown fellow, with a\nfortnight’s ragged beard, and dust in ears and eyes, collarless,\nvulgarly shirted, with shapeless old tweed clothes and boots that\nhad not been cleaned for the better part of a month.  I made a fine\ntramp and a fair drover; and here I was ushered by a prim butler\ninto this temple of gracious ease.  And the best of it was that they\ndid not even know my name.",
        "I resolved not to puzzle my head but to take the gifts the gods\nhad provided.  I shaved and bathed luxuriously, and got into the\ndress clothes and clean crackling shirt, which fitted me not so\nbadly.  By the time I had finished the looking-glass showed a not\nunpersonable young man.",
        "Sir Walter awaited me in a dusky dining-room where a little\nround table was lit with silver candles.  The sight of him–so\nrespectable and established and secure, the embodiment of law and\ngovernment and all the conventions–took me aback and made me\nfeel an interloper.  He couldn’t know the truth about me, or he\nwouldn’t treat me like this.  I simply could not accept his hospitality\non false pretences.",
        "’I’m more obliged to you than I can say, but I’m bound to make\nthings clear,’ I said.  ’I’m an innocent man, but I’m wanted by the\npolice.  I’ve got to tell you this, and I won’t be surprised if you kick\nme out.’",
        "He smiled.  ’That’s all right.  Don’t let that interfere with your\nappetite.  We can talk about these things after dinner.’\nI never ate a meal with greater relish, for I had had nothing all\nday but railway sandwiches.  Sir Walter did me proud, for we drank\na good champagne and had some uncommon fine port afterwards.\nit made me almost hysterical to be sitting there, waited on by a\nfootman and a sleek butler, and remember that I had been living\nfor three weeks like a brigand, with every man’s hand against me.  I\ntold Sir Walter about tiger-fish in the Zambesi that bite off your\nfingers if you give them a chance, and we discussed sport up and\ndown the globe, for he had hunted a bit in his day.",
        "We went to his study for coffee, a jolly room full of books and\ntrophies and untidiness and comfort.  I made up my mind that if\never I got rid of this business and had a house of my own, I would\ncreate just such a room.  Then when the coffee-cups were cleared\naway, and we had got our cigars alight, my host swung his long\nlegs over the side of his chair and bade me get started with my yarn.",
        "’I’ve obeyed Harry’s instructions,’ he said, ’and the bribe he\noffered me was that you would tell me something to wake me up.\nI’m ready, Mr Hannay.’",
        "I noticed with a start that he called me by my proper name.",
        "I began at the very beginning.  I told of my boredom in London,\nand the night I had come back to find Scudder gibbering on my\ndoorstep.  I told him all Scudder had told me about Karolides and\nthe Foreign Office conference, and that made him purse his lips and grin.",
        "Then I got to the murder, and he grew solemn again.  He heard\nall about the milkman and my time in Galloway, and my deciphering\nScudder’s notes at the inn.",
        "’You’ve got them here?’ he asked sharply, and drew a long\nbreath when I whipped the little book from my pocket.",
        "I said nothing of the contents.  Then I described my meeting\nwith Sir Harry, and the speeches at the hall.  At that he laughed\nuproariously.",
        "’Harry talked dashed nonsense, did he?  I quite believe it.  He’s as\ngood a chap as ever breathed, but his idiot of an uncle has stuffed\nhis head with maggots.  Go on, Mr Hannay.’",
        "My day as roadman excited him a bit.  He made me describe the\ntwo fellows in the car very closely, and seemed to be raking back in\nhis memory.  He grew merry again when he heard of the fate of that\nass jopley.",
        "But the old man in the moorland house solemnized him.  Again I\nhad to describe every detail of his appearance.",
        "’Bland and bald-headed and hooded his eyes like a bird ...  He\nsounds a sinister wild-fowl!  And you dynamited his hermitage,\nafter he had saved you from the police.  Spirited piece of work, that!’\nPresently I reached the end of my wanderings.  He got up slowly,\nand looked down at me from the hearth-rug.",
        "’You may dismiss the police from your mind,’ he said.  ’You’re in\nno danger from the law of this land.’",
        "’Great Scot!’ I cried.  ’Have they got the murderer?’",
        "’No.  But for the last fortnight they have dropped you from the\nlist of possibles.’",
        "’Why?’ I asked in amazement.",
        "’Principally because I received a letter from Scudder.  I knew\nsomething of the man, and he did several jobs for me.  He was half\ncrank, half genius, but he was wholly honest.  The trouble about\nhim was his partiality for playing a lone hand.  That made him\npretty well useless in any Secret Service–a pity, for he had uncommon\ngifts.  I think he was the bravest man in the world, for he was\nalways shivering with fright, and yet nothing would choke him off.\nI had a letter from him on the 31st of May.’",
        "’But he had been dead a week by then.’",
        "’The letter was written and posted on the 23rd.  He evidently did\nnot anticipate an immediate decease.  His communications usually\ntook a week to reach me, for they were sent under cover to Spain\nand then to Newcastle.  He had a mania, you know, for concealing\nhis tracks.’",
        "’What did he say?’ I stammered.",
        "’Nothing.  Merely that he was in danger, but had found shelter\nwith a good friend, and that I would hear from him before the 15th\nof June.  He gave me no address, but said he was living near\nPortland Place.  I think his object was to clear you if anything\nhappened.  When I got it I went to Scotland Yard, went over the\ndetails of the inquest, and concluded that you were the friend.  We\nmade inquiries about you, Mr Hannay, and found you were respectable.\nI thought I knew the motives for your disappearance–not\nonly the police, the other one too–and when I got Harry’s scrawl I\nguessed at the rest.  I have been expecting you any time this past week.’\nYou can imagine what a load this took off my mind.  I felt a free\nman once more, for I was now up against my country’s enemies\nonly, and not my country’s law.",
        "’Now let us have the little note-book,’ said Sir Walter.",
        "It took us a good hour to work through it.  I explained the\ncypher, and he was jolly quick at picking it up.  He emended my\nreading of it on several points, but I had been fairly correct, on the\nwhole.  His face was very grave before he had finished, and he sat\nsilent for a while.",
        "’I don’t know what to make of it,’ he said at last.  ’He is right\nabout one thing–what is going to happen the day after tomorrow.\nHow the devil can it have got known?  That is ugly enough in itself.\nBut all this about war and the Black Stone–it reads like some wild\nmelodrama.  If only I had more confidence in Scudder’s judgement.\nThe trouble about him was that he was too romantic.  He had the\nartistic temperament, and wanted a story to be better than God\nmeant it to be.  He had a lot of odd biases, too.  Jews, for example,\nmade him see red.  Jews and the high finance.",
        "’The Black Stone,’ he repeated.  ’DER SCHWARZE STEIN.  It’s like a\npenny novelette.  And all this stuff about Karolides.  That is the\nweak part of the tale, for I happen to know that the virtuous\nKarolides is likely to outlast us both.  There is no State in Europe\nthat wants him gone.  Besides, he has just been playing up to Berlin\nand Vienna and giving my Chief some uneasy moments.  No!  Scudder has\ngone off the track there.  Frankly, Hannay, I don’t believe that part of\nhis story.  There’s some nasty business afoot, and he found out too much\nand lost his life over it.  But I am ready to take my oath that it is\nordinary spy work.  A certain great European Power makes a hobby of her\nspy system, and her methods are not too particular.  Since she pays by\npiecework her blackguards are not likely to stick at a murder or two.\nThey want our naval dispositions for their collection at the Marineamt;\nbut they will be pigeon-holed–nothing more.’",
        "Just then the butler entered the room.",
        "’There’s a trunk-call from London, Sir Walter.  It’s Mr ’Eath, and\nhe wants to speak to you personally.’",
        "My host went off to the telephone.",
        "He returned in five minutes with a whitish face.  ’I apologize to\nthe shade of Scudder,’ he said.  ’Karolides was shot dead this evening\nat a few minutes after seven.’",
