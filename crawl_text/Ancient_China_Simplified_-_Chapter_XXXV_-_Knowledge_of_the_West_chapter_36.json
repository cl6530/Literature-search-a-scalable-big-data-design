        "The question of the expedition of the Emperor Muh to the West in\nthe year 984 B.C., or during that year and the two following, is\nworthy of further consideration for many reasons; and after all\nthat has been said about the rise of the Chou dynasty, the decay\nof the patriarchal system, the emulous ambitions of the vassals,\nthe destruction of the feudal Empire, and the substitution of a\ncentralized administration under a new dynasty of numbered August\nEmperors, it will now be comparatively easier to understand.",
        "We have seen that, if any local annals besides those of Lu have\nbeen in part preserved, those of Ts’in at least were deliberately\nintended by the First August Emperor to be wholly preserved, and\nmust therefore hold first rank among all the restored vassal\nannals published by Sz-ma Ts’ien in or about 90 B.C.; and it must\nbe remembered that the original Lu annals have perished equally\nwith those of Ts’i, Sung, and other important states; it is only\nConfucius’ “Springs and Autumns,\"–evidently composed from the Lu\narchives,–that have survived. Well, the Ts’in Annals, as given by\nSz-ma Ts’ien, record that one of the early Ts’in ancestors “was in\nfavour with the Emperor Muh on account of his admirable skill in\nmanipulating horses” [names of four particularly fine horses\ngiven]. The Emperor “went west to examine his fiefs\"; he was so\n“charmed with his experiences that he forgot the administrative\nduties which should have called him back.” Meanwhile, a revolt\nbroke out in East (uncivilized) China, and the manipulator of\nhorses was sent by the Emperor back to China at express speed, in\norder to stave off trouble till the Emperor could get back\nhimself. It is also stated of him that, in spite of remonstrances,\nhe made extensive war upon the Tartars, and that, in consequence,\nhis uncivilized vassals ceased to present themselves at court. No\nother mention is made of this expedition by Sz-ma Ts’ien in the\nimperial annals, and, so (apart from the fictitious importance\nafterwards given to the expedition, and especially by European\ninvestigators in quite recent times), there is really no reason to\nattach any more political weight to it than to the other\ninnumerable exploring expeditions of emperors into the almost\nunknown regions surrounding the nucleus of orthodox China so often\ndefined in these Chapters. We have already (page 184) cited the\ncase in which the father and predecessor of King Muh had ventured\non a tour of inspection as far as modern Hankow on the Yang-tsz\nRiver, or, as some say, as far as some place on the River Han,\nwhere he was murdered; in 656 the First Protector raked up this\naffair against Ts’u, whose capital was very near King-thou Fu,\nabove Hankow. Finally, scant though Sz-ma Ts’ien’s two references\nto this affair may be, they at least agree with each other, i.e.\nthe Emperor did actually go to Tartar regions, and a revolt of\nnon-Chinese tribes did actually break out in the immediate sequel.",
        "But in A.D. 281 a certain tomb at a place once belonging to Wei,\nbut later attached to the kingdom of Ngwei formerly part of Tsin,\nwas desecrated by thieves, and, amongst other books written in\nancient characters found therein (unfortunately all more or less\ninjured by the rummaging thieves), were two of paramount interest.\nOne was an account of, and was entirely devoted to, the Emperor\nMuh’s voyage to the West; the other was the Annals of Ngwei (i.e.\nof that third part of old Tsin which in 403 B.C. was formally\nrecognized by the Emperor as the separate state of Ngwei),\nincluding those of old Tsin, and also what may be termed the\ngeneral history of China, narrated incidentally. These Annals of\nTsin or Ngwei are usually styled the Bamboo Books, because they\nwere written in ink on bamboo tablets strung together at one end\nlike a fan or a narrow Venetian blind. They also speak shortly of\nthe Emperor Muh’s expedition, and thus they also are useful for\ncomparing hiatuses, names, faults, and dates; both in general\nhistory, and in the account of King Muh’s expedition. Since the\ndiscovery of these old documents (which had been buried for well-\nnigh 600 years, and of which no other record whatever had been\npreserved either in writing or by tradition), Chinese literary\nwonder-mongers have exercised their wits upon the task of\nidentifying the unheard-of places mentioned; the more so in that\none place, and one king bearing the same foreign name as the\nplace–Siwangmu–was so written phonetically that it might\nmean “Western-King-Mother.” They endeavoured to show how this and\nother places might have lain in relation to the genuine\nplaces discovered by Chinese generals after these ancient\ndocuments were buried, seven centuries after the events recorded\ntherein. Then came the foreigner with his Jewish Creation,\nConfusion of Tongues, Accadian and Babylonian origin of all\nscience, etc., etc. Of course Marco Polo’s adventures at once\nsuggested to the European, thus biased, that 3000 years ago the\nEmperor Muh might have found his way to Persia, and might\nhave been this or that Babylonian, Egyptian, or Persian hero; in fact,\nProfessor Forke of Berlin even takes his Chinese majesty as far as Africa,\nand introduces him to the Queen of Sheba (= Western-King-Mother).",
        "The distinguished Professor Edouard Chavannes of Paris has\nrecently attempted to show, not only that the Emperor Muh never\ngot beyond the Tarim (which, indeed, is absolutely certain from\nthe text itself), but that it was not the Emperor Muh at all who\nwent, but the semi-Turkish Duke Muh of Ts’in, in the seventh\ncentury B.C., who made the expedition.",
        "To begin with, let us see what the expedition purports to be. In\nthe first place, the thieves used as torches, or otherwise\ndestroyed, the first few pages of the bamboo sheaf book, and we do\nnot know, consequently, whence the Emperor started: there is much\nindirect evidence, however, to show that he started from some\nplace on the headwaters of the Han River, in what must then have\nbeen his own territory (South Shen Si); especially as his three\nexpeditions all ended there. It is certain, however, that he had\nnot travelled many days on his first journey before he reached a\ntribe of Tartars very frequently mentioned in all histories, and\nbearing the same name as the Tartars whom Sz-ma Ts’ien says the\nEmperor Muh did conquer. He crossed the Yellow River on the\n169th day, came to two rivers, the Redwater (222nd day), and the\nBlackwater (248th day), which rivers in after ages have been\nfrequently mentioned in connection with Tibetan, Turkish, and\nOuigour wars, and are apparently in the Si-ning and Kan-chou Fu,\nor possibly Kwa Chou regions (cf. p. 68); but first he passed,\nafter the 170th day, a place called “Piled Stones,” a name which\nhas never been lost to history, and which corresponds to Nien-po,\nbetween Lan-thou Fu and Si-ning, as marked on modern maps.\nIn other words, he went by the only high-road there was in existence,\nand ever since then has continued in existence (just traversed by Bruce),\nleading to the Lob Nor region; whence again he branched off,\npresumably to Turfan, or to Harashar; thence to Urumtsi, and possibly\nKuche, as they are respectively now called; but on the whole it is not\nlikely that he got beyond Harashar and Urumtsi. Even 800 years later,\nwhen the Chinese had thoroughly explored all the west up to the Hindu\nKush, their expeditions had all to proceed from Lob Nor to Khoten, or\nfrom Lob Nor (or near it) via Harashar and Kuche along the\nTarim Valley: it was not for long after the discovery of these routes that\nthe later Chinese discovered the northerly Hami route, and the possibility\nof avoiding Lob Nor altogether. His charioteer is said in this\naccount to have been a man (named) whose name is exactly the name,\nwritten in exactly the same way, as the name of the ancestor of\nTs’in, who, Sz-ma Ts’ien tells us, actually was the charioteer of\nthe Emperor when he marched forth against the Tartars, and who\nhurried back to China when the revolts broke out owing to the\nEmperor’s absence. As the Emperor received, from various princes,\npresents of wine, silk, and rice, it is almost certain that he\nmust have avoided bleak, out-of-the-way places, and have made for\nthe productive regions of Harashar, Turfan, and possibly Kuche,\nany or all three of these. With a little more care and patience we\nmay yet succeed in identifying, and by the same names, several\nmore of the places mentioned by the old chronicler. In about ten\nmonths (286 days from the first day already mentioned, and 17 days\nout from “Piled Stones”) he reached Siwangmu. This is not\nat all unlikely to be Urumtsi, or a place near it, possibly Ku-\nCH’ENg or Gutchen, because Siwangmu (also the name of the\nking of that place), gave him a feast on a certain lake, which\nlake, written in exactly the same way, became the name of a quite\nnew district in 653 A.D., when it was abolished; and that district\nwas at or near Urumtsi; the presumption being that, in the seventh\ncentury A.D., it was so named on account of old traditions, then\nwell known. Roughly speaking, it took the Emperor 300 days to go,\nand a second 300 to get back; stoppages, feasts, functions, all\nincluded. The total distance travelled, as specified from chief\nstation to chief station, is 13,300 li (say 4000 miles) to\nSiwangmu and to the hunting grounds near but beyond it.\nWhen 200 days out he came to the place where his feet were washed\nwith kumiss; this place is frequently mentioned in history; even\nConfucius names it, as one of the northernmost conquests of the\nChou dynasty. The only doubt is whether it is near Lan-thou Fu in\nKan Suh province, or near the northern bend of the Yellow River.\nThe journey back was hurried and shorter (as we might well suppose\nfrom Sz-ma Ts’ien’s accounts above given), that is to say, only\n10,000 li. But the total for the whole double journey of\n660 days in all, including all by-trips, excursions, and hunts,\nwas 38,000 li, or about 12,000 miles–say 20 miles a day. I\nhave myself travelled several thousand miles in China and Tartary,\nalways at the maximum rate of 30 miles a day; more usually 20,\nallowing for delays, bad roads, and accidents. In Dr. Legge’s\ntranslation of the “Book of Odes,” p. 281, there is a song about a\ngreat expedition against the Tartars in 827 B.C., one line of\nwhich is precisely, as translated by Dr. Legge: “and we marched\nthirty li every day,\"-which means only ten miles.",
        "This is the chief journey; and whether the Chou Emperor in 984\nB.C., or the Ts’in Duke in 650 B.C., made it, there are really no\ndifficulties, no contradictions. Four important places at least\nare named which are known by exactly the same names, and are\nfrequently mentioned, in very much later history. The Emperor had\nhundreds of carts or chariots with him, and we have seen that\nthese were a special feature of orthodox China. He came across a\nhuge moulting-ground of birds in the desert regions, and the later\nChinese very frequently speak of it in Tartar-land. Being caught\nin the waterless desert, he had to cut the throats of some of his\nbest horses and drink their warm blood: two friends of my own,\ntravelling through Siberia and Mongolia, were only too glad, when\nnearly starving from cold, to cut a sheep’s throat and drink its\nwarm blood from the newly-gashed throat itself. Fattening up\nhorses for food is mentioned, and washing the feet with kumiss–\nboth incidents purely Tartar. “Cattle,” distinct from horses and\noxen, are alluded to–probably camels, for which no Chinese word\nexisted until about the time of our era.",
        "The second and third journeys, which occupied another 600 days\nbetween them, both ended at, and therefore it is assumed began at,\nthe same place as the first journey’s terminus; that is, at a\nplace marked on modern maps as Pao-CH’ENg, on the Upper Han River.\nIn later times it belonged to the semi-Chinese kingdoms of Shuh\nand Ts’u in turn. One of these narratives is taken up with a\ndescription of the Emperor’s infatuation for a clever wizard from\na far country, and of his liaison with a girl bearing his own\nclan-name, who died about two months before he reached home, and\nwas buried on the road with great pomp. These two later journeys\nhave no geographical value at all; but as the Emperor in each case\nagain crossed the Yellow River, it is plain that he was amusing\nhimself somewhere along the main Tartar roads, as in the first\ncase.",
        "It may be added that the Taoist author Lieh-tsz, in his third\nChapter, repeats the story of the magician, who, he says, came\nfrom the “Extreme West Country.” He also explains that it was\nthrough listening to this man’s wonderful tales that the Emperor\n“neglected state affairs, and abandoned himself to the delights of\ntravel,\"–thus anticipating by three centuries the language of Sz-\nma Ts’ien in 90 B.C. The story of the particular tribe of Tartars\n(named with the same sounds, but not with the same characters) who\nwashed the Emperor’s feet with kumiss is also told by Lieh-tsz.\nThe position of the Redwater River is defined, to which textual\nremarks the commentators add more about the River Blackwater.\nCuriously enough, in himself commenting upon the Emperor Muh’s\nconversations with the chieftain of Siwangmu, Lieh-tsz mentions\nthe traditional departure, west, of the philosopher Lao-tsz, his own\nmaster.",
        "Now, although there is considerable doubt as to the authorship,\ndate, and genuineness of Lieh-tsz’s book, which at any rate was\nwell known to Chinese bibliophiles long before our era, the fact\nthat it mentions and repeats even part of the Emperor Muh’s\ntravels 600 years before the ancient book describing those travels\nwas found, proves that the manipulators of the ancient book thus\nfound did not invent the whole story after our era. It also seems\nto prove that in Lieh-tsz’s time (i.e. immediately after\nConfucius) the story was already known (and probably the book of\ntravels too), Confucius himself having mentioned one of the tribes\nvisited by the Emperor. The Bamboo Books bring history down to 299\nB.C., and were found, together with the travels of the Emperor\nMuh, in A.D. 281. The Bamboo Books not only support part of the\nstory of the Emperor Muh’s travels, but their accuracy in dates\nhas been shown by Professor Chavannes to strengthen the\ncredibility of Confucius’ own history: a reference to Chapter\nXXXII. on the Calendar will explain what is meant by “accuracy in\ndates.” Finally, we have Sz-ma Ts’ien’s history of go B.C.,\nciting the Chou Annals and the Ts’in Annals, or what survived of\nthem after incessant wars between 400 and 200 B.C., and after the\ndestruction of literature in 213 B.C.",
        "This point settled, the next thing is to consider Professor\nChavannes’ reasons for supposing that Duke Muh of Ts’in (650 B.C.)\nand not the Emperor Muh of Chou (984 B.C.) was the real\ntraveller:–",
        "1. He shows that the ruling princes of Ts’in and Chao hailed from\nthe same ancestors, were contiguous states, and, besides being\nlargely Tartar themselves, ruled all the Tartars along the\n(present) Great Wall line: also that the naming of individual\nhorses and other features of the Emperor’s travels recalls\nfeatures equally prominent in later Turkish history. This is all\nundoubtedly true: compare page 206.",
        "2. He shows that the Duke Muh’s chief claim to glory was his\nsuccesses against the Tartars of the West. This is also quite\ncertain. 3. He thinks that in 984 B.C. the literary capacity of\nChina was not equal to the composition of such a sustained work as\nthe Travels.",
        "4. He also thinks that the real Chinese found in Ts’in the\ntraditions relating to Duke Muh, and then, for the glory of China,\nappropriated them to the Emperor Muh, and foisted them upon\northodox history.",
        "There is a great deal to be said for this view, which has,\nbesides, many other minor points of detail in its favour. But it\nmay be answered:–",
        "1. Chou itself was in the eyes of China proper, once a “barbarian\"\ntribe of the west, as the founder of the Chou dynasty in 1122 B.C.\nhimself showed when he addressed his neighbours and allies, the\neight other states of the west, and exhorted them, as equals, to\nassist him in the conquest of China. It was only in 771 B.C. that\nthe original Chou appanage (since 1122 the western half of the\nimperial appanage) had been ceded to Ts’in, which in 984 was a\npetty state, still of the “adjunct-function” (cf. page 144)\ntype, and not “sovereign.” In 984 there was no intermediate\nsovereign “power” between the Emperor and the Tartars, with whom,\nin fact, he had been directly engaged in war independently of\nTs’in. He was as much under Tartar social influences as was Ts’in:\nin fact, the Chou principality, under the Shang dynasty, was a\nsort of first edition of Ts’in principality under the Chou\ndynasty. Just as in 1122 B.C. Chou ousted Shang as the imperial\nhouse, so in 221 B.C. Ts’in definitely replaced Chou.",
        "2. If Duke Muh distinguished himself by Tartar conquests, so did\nthe Emperor Muh before him, and the authorities are all agreed on\nthis point.",
        "3. If in 984 B.C. the long-standing orthodox Chinese literary\ncapacity was unequal to this effort, how is it that semi-barbarous\nTs’in, the least literary of all the states (not only Chinese, but\nalso half-Chinese), into which state records had only been\nintroduced at all in 753 B.C., was able to compose such a book;\nor, if not to write the book, then to dictate so sustained and\nconnected a story? Besides, the Emperor Muh left several\ninscriptions carved on stone during the progress of his travels.",
        "4. The instances M. Chavannes cites of the tombs of Yue and Shun in\nSouth China, as being parallel instances of appropriation by\northodox Chinese of semi-Chinese traditions have already been put\nto quite another use above, as tending to show, on the contrary,\nthat those two Emperors either came from the south, or had\nancestral traditions in the south; (see pp. 138,191).",
        "5. Finally, about a third of the Travels is taken up with a\ndescription of the incestuous intrigue with Lady Ki, and of\nher sumptuous ritual funeral. Why should Duke Muh trouble himself\nabout the rites due to members of the Ki family, to which the\nEmperor belonged, but he himself did not? Why should the warlike\nDuke Muh (who had just then been recommended by an adviser (an ex-\nChinese, since become a Tartar) to adopt simple Tartar ways\ninstead of worrying himself with the Odes and the Book “as the\nChinese did”) waste his time in pomp and ritual? ( see p.\n180). Again, when, as the Travels tell us, various vassal rulers\nfrom orthodox China (even so far as Shan Tung in the extreme east)\narrived to pay their respects to the Emperor as their liege-lord,\nhow is it possible to suppose that these orthodox counts and\nbarons would come to pay court to a semi-barbarian count (for that\nwas all he was) like Duke Muh (as he is posthumously called), one\nof their equals, a man who took no part in the durbar affairs, and\nwho, on account of his human sacrifices, was not even thought fit\nto become an emergency Protector of China? What could the semi-\nTartar ruler of Ts’in have known of all these wearisome\nrefinements in pomp, mourning, and music? Once more, the place the\nEmperor started from and came back to, though part of his\nappanage in 984 B.C. and possessing an ancestral Chou temple, was\nnot part of the Ts’in dominions in 650 B.C., and never possessed a\nTs’in temple: if not independent, it was at that time a bone of\ncontention between Ts’in and Ts’u, and by no means a safe place\nfor equipping pleasure expeditions. Finally, if it is marvellous\nthat the Chou Annals of Sz-ma Ts’ien do not give full details of\nthe voyage, is it not at least equally marvellous that the Ts’in\nAnnals should not mention it in 650 B.C., when M. Chavannes\nsupposes it took place, whilst they do so mention it under 984\nB.C., when he thinks it did not take place? All accounts agree\nthat the ancestor of Ts’in (named) was there with the Emperor as\ncharioteer; he was, as we have seen, equally ancestor of Chao, and\nthe Chao Annals of Sz-ma Ts’ien say exactly what the Ts’in Annals\nsay.",
        "Hence we may gratefully accept Professor Chavannes’ most\nilluminating proofs, so far as they tend to show that the Travels\nof the Emperor Muh are genuine history for a tour no farther than\nthe middle Tarim Valley; but, so far as Duke Muh of Ts’in is\nconcerned, he must be eliminated from all consideration of the\nmatter, and we must ascribe the tour, as the Chinese do, to the\nEmperor Muh. Lastly, are there any proved instances of such\nradical tamperings with history by the Chinese annalists as M.\nChavannes suggests? I do not know of any; and such superficial\ntamperings as there are the Chinese critics always expose, coute\nque coute, even though Confucius himself be the tamperer.",
