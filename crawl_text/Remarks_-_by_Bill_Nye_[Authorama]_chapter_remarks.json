        "Ah Sin was his name;\nAnd I shall not deny,\nIn regard to the same,\nWhat the name might imply:\nBut his smile it was pensive and childlike,\nAs I frequent remarked to Bill Nye.",
        "–Bret Harte.",
        "This book is not designed specially for any one class of people. It is\nfor all. It is a universal repository of thought. Some of my best\nthoughts are contained in this book. Whenever I would think a thought\nthat I thought had better remain unthought, I would omit it from this\nbook. For that reason the book is not so large as I had intended. When\na man coldly and dispassionately goes at it to eradicate from his work\nall that may not come up to his standard of merit, he can make a large\nvolume shrink till it is no thicker than the bank book of an outspoken\nclergyman.",
        "This is the fourth book that I have published in response to the\nclamorous appeals of the public. Whenever the public got to clamoring\ntoo loudly for a new book from me and it got so noisy that I could not\nignore it any more, I would issue another volume. The first was a red\nbook, succeeded by a dark blue volume, after which I published a green\nbook, all of which were kindly received by the American people, and,\nunder the present yielding system of international copyright, greedily\nsnapped up by some of the tottering dynasties.",
        "But I had long hoped to publish a larger, better and, if possible, a\nredder book than the first; one that would contain my better thoughts,\nthoughts that I had thought when I was feeling well; thoughts that I\nhad emitted while my thinker was rearing up on its hind feet, if I may\nbe allowed that term; thoughts that sprang forth with a wild whoop and\ndemanded recognition.",
        "This book is the result of that hope and that wish. It is my greatest\nand best book. It is the one that will live for weeks after other books\nhave passed away. Even to those who cannot read, it will come like a\nbenison when there is no benison in the house. To the ignorant, the\npictures will be pleasing. The wise will revel in its wisdom, and the\nhousekeeper will find that with it she may easily emphasize a statement\nor kill a cockroach.",
        "The range of subjects treated in this book is wonderful, even to me. It\nis a library of universal knowledge, and the facts contained in it are\ndifferent from any other facts now in use. I have carefully guarded,\nall the way through, against using hackneyed and moth-eaten facts. As a\nresult, I am able to come before the people with a set of new and\nattractive statements, so fresh and so crisp that an unkind word would\nwither them in a moment.",
        "I believe there is nothing more to add, except that I most heartily\nendorse the book. It has been carefully read over by the proof-reader\nand myself, so we do not ask the public to do anything that we were not\nwilling to do ourselves.",
        "I cannot be responsible for the board of orphans whose parents read this\nbook and leave their children in destitute circumstances.",
        "Bill Nye",
        "Looking over my own school days, there are so many things that I would\nrather not tell, that it will take very little time and space for me to\nuse in telling what I am willing that the carping public should know about\nmy early history.",
        "I began my educational career in a log school house. Finding that other\ngreat men had done that way, I began early to look around me for a log\nschool house where I could begin in a small way to soak my system full of\nhard words and information.",
        "For a time I learned very rapidly. Learning came to me with very little\neffort at first. I would read my lesson over once or twice and then take\nmy place in the class. It never bothered me to recite my lesson and so I\nstood at the head of the class. I could stick my big toe through a\nknot-hole in the floor and work out the most difficult problem. This\nbecame at last a habit with me. With my knot-hole I was safe, without it I\nwould hesitate.",
        "A large red-headed boy, with feet like a summer squash and eyes like those\nof a dead codfish, was my rival. He soon discovered that I was very\ndependent on that knot-hole, and so one night he stole into the school\nhouse and plugged up the knot-hole, so that I could not work my toe into\nit and thus refresh my memory.",
        "Then the large red-headed boy, who had not formed the knot-hole habit went\nto the head of the class and remained there.",
        "After I grew larger, my parents sent me to a military school. That is\nwhere I got the fine military learning and stately carriage that I still\nwear.",
        "My room was on the second floor, and it was very difficult for me to leave\nit at night, because the turnkey locked us up at 9 o’clock every evening.\nStill, I used to get out once in a while and wander around in the\nstarlight. I did not know yet why I did it, but I presume it was a kind of\nsomnambulism. I would go to bed thinking so intently of my lessons that I\nwould get up and wander away, sometimes for miles, in the solemn night.",
        "One night I awoke and found myself in a watermelon patch. I was never so\nashamed in my life. It is a very serious thing to be awakened so rudely\nout of a sound sleep, by a bull dog, to find yourself in the watermelon\nvineyard of a man with whom you are not acquainted. I was not on terms of\nsocial intimacy with this man or his dog. They did not belong to our set.\nWe had never been thrown together before.",
        "After that I was called the great somnambulist and men who had watermelon\nconservatories shunned me. But it cured me of my somnambulism. I have\nnever tried to somnambule any more since that time.",
        "There are other little incidents of my schooldays that come trooping up in\nmy memory at this moment, but they were not startling in their nature.\nMine is but the history of one who struggled on year after year, trying to\ndo better, but most always failing to connect. The boys of Boston would do\nwell to study carefully my record and then–do differently.",
        "Mr. Webster, no doubt, had the best command of language of any American\nauthor prior to our day. Those who have read his ponderous but rather\ndisconnected romance known as “Websters Unabridged Dictionary, or How One\nWord Led on to Another.” will agree with me that he was smart. Noah never\nlacked for a word by which to express himself. He was a brainy man and a\ngood speller.",
        "It would ill become me at this late day to criticise Mr. Webster’s great\nwork–a work that is now in almost every library, school-room and counting\nhouse in the land. It is a great book. I do believe that had Mr. Webster\nlived he would have been equally fair in his criticism of my books.",
        "I hate to compare my own works with those of Mr. Webster, because it may\nseem egotistical in me to point out the good points in my literary labors;\nbut I have often heard it said, and so do not state it solely upon my own\nresponsibility, that Mr. Webster’s book does not retain the interest of\nthe reader all the way through.",
        "He has tried to introduce too many characters, and so we cannot follow\nthem all the way through. It is a good book to pick up and while away an\nidle hour with, perhaps, but no one would cling to it at night till the\nfire went out, chained to the thrilling plot and the glowing career of its\nhero.",
        "Therein consists the great difference between Mr. Webster and myself. A\nfriend of mine at Sing Sing once wrote me that from the moment he got hold\nof my book, he never left his room till he finished it. He seemed chained\nto the spot, he said, and if you can’t believe a convict, who is entirely\nout of politics, who in the name of George Washington can you believe?",
        "Mr. Webster was most assuredly a brilliant writer, and I have discovered\nin his later editions 118,000 words, no two of which are alike. This shows\ngreat fluency and versatility, it is true, but we need something else. The\nreader waits in vain to be thrilled by the author’s wonderful word\npainting. There is not a thrill in the whole tome. I had heard so much of\nMr. Webster that when I read his book I confess I was disappointed. It is\ncold, methodical and dispassionate in the extreme.",
        "As I said, however, it is a good book to pick up for the purpose of\nwhiling away an idle moment, and no one should start out on a long journey\nwithout Mr. Webster’s tale in his pocket. It has broken the monotony of\nmany a tedious trip for me.",
        "Mr. Webster’s “Speller” was a work of less pretentions, perhaps, and yet\nit had an immense sale. Eight years ago this book had reached a sale of\n40,000,000, and yet it had the same grave defect. It was disconnected,\ncold, prosy and dull. I read it for years, and at last became a close\nstudent of Mr. Webster’s style, yet I never found but one thing in this\nbook, for which there seems to have been such a perfect stampede, that was\neven ordinarily interesting, and that was a little gem. It was so\nthrilling in its details, and so diametrically different from Mr.\nWebster’s style, that I have often wondered who he got to write it for\nhim. It related to the discovery of a boy by an elderly gentleman, in the\ncrotch of an ancestral apple tree, and the feeling of bitterness and\nanimosity that sprung up at the time between the boy and the elderly\ngentleman.",
        "Though I have been a close student of Mr. Webster for years, I am free to\nsay, and I do not wish to do an injustice to a great man in doing so, that\nhis ideas of literature and my own are entirely dissimilar. Possibly his\nbook has had a little larger sale than mine, but that makes no difference.\nWhen I write a book it must engage the interest of the reader, and show\nsome plot to it. It must not be jerky in its style and scattering in its\nstatements.",
        "I know it is a great temptation to write a book that will sell, but we\nshould have a higher object than that.",
        "I do not wish to do an injustice to a man who has done so much for the\nworld, and one who could spell the longest word without hesitation, but I\nspeak of these things just as I would expect people to criticise my work.\nIf we aspire to monkey with the literati of our day we must expect to be\ncriticised. That’s the way I look at it.",
        "P.S.–I might also state that Noah Webster was a member of the\nLegislature of Massachusetts at one time, and though I ought not to throw\nit up to him at this date, I think it is nothing more than right that the\npublic should know the truth.",
        "To Queen Victoria, Regina Dei Gracia and acting mother-in-law on the side:",
        "Dear Madame.–Your most gracious majesty will no doubt be surprised to hear\nfrom me after my long silence. One reason that I have not written for some\ntime is that I had hoped to see you ere this, and not because I had grown\ncold. I desire to congratulate you at this time upon your great success as\na mother-in-law, and your very exemplary career socially. As a queen you\nhave given universal satisfaction, and your family have married well.",
        "But I desired more especially to write you in relation to another matter.\nWe are struggling here in America to establish an authors’ international\ncopyright arrangement, whereby the authors of all civilized nations may be\nprotected in their rights to the profits of their literary labor, and the\nmovement so far has met with generous encouragement. As an author we\ndesire your aid and endorsement. Could you assist us? We are giving this\nseason a series of authors’ readings in New York to aid in prosecuting the\nwork, and we would like to know whether we could not depend upon you to\ntake a part in these readings, rendering selections from your late work.",
        "I assure your most gracious majesty that you would meet some of our best\nliterary people while here, and no pains would be spared to make your\nvisit a pleasant one, aside from the reading itself. We would advertise\nyour appearance extensively and get out a first-class audience on the\noccasion of your debut here.",
        "An effort would be made to provide passes for yourself, and reduced rates,\nI think, could be secured for yourself and suite at the hotels. Of course\nyou could do as you thought best about bringing suite, however. Some of\nus travel with our suites and some do not. I generally leave my suite at\nhome, myself.",
        "You would not need to make any special change as to costume for the\noccasion. We try to make it informal, so far as possible, and though some\nof us wear full dress we do not make that obligatory on those who take a\npart in the exercises. If you decide to wear your every-day reigning\nclothes it will not excite comment on the part of our literati. We do not\njudge an author or authoress by his or her clothes.",
        "You will readily see that this will afford you an opportunity to appear\nbefore some of the best people of New York, and at the same time you will\naid in a deserving enterprise.",
        "It will also promote the sale of your book.",
        "Perhaps you have all the royalty you want aside from what you may receive\nfrom the sale of your works, but every author feels a pardonable pride in\ngetting his books into every household.",
        "I would assure your most gracious majesty that your reception here as an\nauthoress will in no way suffer because you are an unnaturalized\nforeigner. Any alien who feels a fraternal interest in the international\nadvancement of thought and the universal encouragement of the good, the\ntrue and the beautiful in literature, will be welcome on these shores.",
        "This is a broad land, and we aim to be a broad and cosmopolitan people.\nLiterature and free, willing genius are not hemmed in by State or national\nlinos. They sprout up and blossom under tropical skies no less than\nbeneath the frigid aurora borealis of the frozen North. We hail true merit\njust as heartily and uproariously on a throne as we would anywhere else.\nIn fact, it is more deserving, if possible, for one who has never tried it\nlittle knows how difficult it is to sit on a hard throne all day and write\nwell. We are to recognize struggling genius wherever it may crop out. It\nis no small matter for an almost unknown monarch to reign all day and then\nwrite an article for the press or a chapter for a serial story, only,\nperhaps, to have it returned by the publishers. All these things are\ndrawbacks to a literary life, that we here in America know little of.",
        "I hope your most gracious majesty will decide to come, and that you will\npardon this long letter. It will do you good to get out this way for a few\nweeks, and I earnestly hope that you will decide to lock up the house and\ncome prepared to make quite a visit. We have some real good authors here\nnow in America, and we are not ashamed to show them to any one. They are\nnot only smart, but they are well behaved and know how to appear in\ncompany. We generally read selections from our own works, and can have a\nbrass band to play between the selections, if thought best. For myself, I\nprefer to have a full brass band accompany me while I read. The audience\nalso approves of this plan.",
        "We have been having some very hot weather here for the past week, but it is\nnow cooler. Farmers are getting in their crops in good shape, but wheat is\nstill low in price, and cranberries are souring on the vines. All of our\ncanned red raspberries worked last week, and we had to can them over\nagain. Mr. Riel, who went into the rebellion business in Canada last\nwinter, will be hanged in September if it don’t rain. It will be his first\nappearance on the gallows, and quite a number of our leading American\ncriminals are going over to see his debut.",
        "Hoping to hear from you by return mail or prepaid cablegram, I beg leave\nto remain your most gracious and indulgent majesty’s humble and obedient\nservant.",
        "Bill Nye.",
        "The editor of an Eastern health magazine, having asked for information\nrelative to the habits, hours of work, and style and frequency of feed\nadopted by literary men, and several parties having responded who were no\nmore essentially saturated with literature than I am, I now take my pen in\nhand to reveal the true inwardness of my literary life, so that boys, who\nmay yearn to follow in my footsteps and wear a laurel wreath the year round\nin place of a hat, may know what the personal habits of a literary party\nare.",
        "I rise from bed the first thing in the morning, leaving my couch not\nbecause I am dissatisfied with it, but because I cannot carry it with me\nduring the day.",
        "I then seat myself on the edge of the bed and devote a few moments to\nthought. Literary men who have never set aside a few moments on rising for\nthought will do well to try it.",
        "I then insert myself into a pair of middle-aged pantaloons. It is needless\nto say that girls who may have a literary tendency will find little to\ninterest them here.",
        "Other clothing is added to the above from time to time. I then bathe\nmyself. Still this is not absolutely essential to a literary life. Others\nwho do not do so have been equally successful.",
        "Some literary people bathe before dressing.",
        "I then go down stairs and out to the barn, where I feed the horse. Some\nliterary men feel above taking care of a horse, because there is really\nnothing in common between the care of a horse and literature, but\nsimplicity is my watchword. T. Jefferson would have to rise early in the\nday to eclipse me in simplicity. I wish I had as many dollars as I have\ngot simplicity.",
        "I then go in to breakfast. This meal consists almost wholly of food. I am\npassionately fond of food, and I may truly say, with my hand on my heart,\nthat I owe much of my great success in life to this inward craving, this\nconstant yearning for something better.",
        "During this meal I frequently converse with my family. I do not feel above\nmy family, at least, if I do, I try to conceal it as much as possible.\nBuckwheat pancakes in a heated state, with maple syrup on the upper side,\nare extremely conducive to literature. Nothing jerks the mental faculties\naround with greater rapidity than buckwheat pancakes.",
        "After breakfast the time is put in to good advantage looking forward to\nthe time when dinner will be ready. From 8 to 10 A. M., however, I\nfrequently retire to my private library hot-bed in the hay mow, and write\n1,200 words in my forthcoming book, the price of which will be $2.50 in\ncloth and $4 with Russia back.",
        "I then play Copenhagen with some little girls 21 years of age, who live\nnear by, and of whom I am passionately fond.",
        "After that I dig some worms, with a view to angling. I then angle. After\nthis I return home, waiting until dusk, however, as I do not like to\nattract attention. Nothing is more distasteful to a truly good man of\nwonderful literary acquirements, and yet with singular modesty, than the\ncoarse and rude scrutiny of the vulgar herd.",
        "In winter I do not angle. I read the “Pirate Prince” or the “Missourian’s\nMash,” or some other work, not so much for the plot as the style, that I\nmay get my mind into correct channels of thought I then play “old sledge\"\nin a rambling sort of manner. I sometimes spend an evening at home, in\norder to excite remark and draw attention to my wonderful eccentricity.",
        "I do not use alcohol in any form, if I know it, though sometimes I am\nbasely deceived by those who know of my peculiar prejudice, and who do it,\ntoo, because they enjoy watching my odd and amusing antics at the time.",
        "Alcohol should be avoided entirely by literary workers, especially young\nwomen. There can be no more pitiable sight to the tender hearted, than a\nyoung woman of marked ability writing an obituary poem while under the\ninfluence of liquor.",
        "I knew a young man who was a good writer. His penmanship was very good,\nindeed. He once wrote an article for the press while under the influence\nof liquor. He sent it to the editor, who returned it at once with a cold\nand cruel letter, every line of which was a stab. The letter came at a\ntime when he was full of remorse.",
        "He tossed up a cent to see whether he should blow out his brains or go\ninto the ready-made clothing business. The coin decided that he should die\nby his own hand, but his head ached so that he didn’t feel like shooting\ninto it. So he went into the ready-made clothing business, and now he pays\ntaxes on $75,000, so he is probably worth $150,000. This, of course,\nsalves over his wounded heart, but he often says to me that he might have\nbeen in the literary business to-day if he had let liquor alone.",
        "My dear son.–Your letter of last week reached us yesterday, and I enclose\n$13, which is all I have by me at the present time. I may sell the other\nshote next week and make up the balance of what you wanted. I will\nprobably have to wear the old buffalo overcoat to meetings again this\nwinter, but that don’t matter so long as you are getting an education.",
        "I hope you will get your education as cheap as you can, for it cramps your\nmother and me like Sam Hill to put up the money. Mind you, I don’t\ncomplain. I knew education come high, but I didn’t know the clothes cost\nso like sixty.",
        "I want you to be so that you can go anywhere and spell the hardest word. I\nwant you to be able to go among the Romans or the Medes and Persians and\ntalk to any of them in their own native tongue.",
        "I never had any advantages when I was a boy, but your mother and I decided\nthat we would sock you full of knowledge, if your liver held out,\nregardless of expense. We calculate to do it, only we want you to go as\nslow on swallowtail coats as possible till we can sell our hay.",
        "Now, regarding that boat-paddling suit, and that baseball suit, and that\nbathing suit, and that roller-rinktum suit, and that lawn-tennis suit,\nmind, I don’t care about the expense, because you say a young man can’t\nreally educate himself thoroughly without them, but I wish you’d send home\nwhat you get through with this fall, and I’ll wear them through the winter\nunder my other clothes. We have a good deal severer winters here than we\nused to, or else I’m failing in bodily health. Last winter I tried to go\nthrough without underclothes, the way I did when I was a boy, but a\nManitoba wave came down our way and picked me out of a crowd with its eyes\nshet.",
        "In your last letter you alluded to getting injured in a little “hazing\nscuffle with a pelican from the rural districts.” I don’t want any harm to\ncome to you, my son, but if I went from the rural districts and another\nyoung gosling from the rural districts undertook to haze me, I would meet\nhim when the sun goes down, and I would swat him across the back of the\nneck with a fence board, and then I would meander across the pit of his\nstomach and put a blue forget-me-not under his eye.",
        "Your father aint much on Grecian mythology and how to get the square root\nof a barrel of pork, but he wouldn’t allow any educational institutions to\nhaze him with impunity. Perhaps you remember once when you tried to haze\nyour father a little, just to kill time, and how long it took you to\nrecover. Anybody that goes at it right can have a good deal of fun with\nyour father, but those who have sought to monkey with him, just to break\nup the monotony of life, have most always succeeded in finding what they\nsought.",
        "I ain’t much of a pensman, so you will have to excuse this letter. We are\nall quite well, except old Fan, who has a galded shoulder, and hope this\nwill find you enjoying the same great blessing.",
        "Your Father.",
        "Archimedes, whose given name has been accidentally torn off and swallowed\nup in oblivion, was born in Syracuse, 2,171 years ago last spring. He was\na philosopher and mathematical expert. During his life he was never\nsuccessfully stumped in figures. It ill befits me now, standing by his\nnew-made grave, to say aught of him that is not of praise. We can only\nmourn his untimely death, and wonder which of our little band of great men\nwill be the next to go.",
        "Archimedes was the first to originate and use the word “Eureka.” It has\nbeen successfully used very much lately, and as a result we have the\nEureka baking powder, the Eureka suspender, the Eureka bed-bug buster, the\nEureka shirt, and the Eureka stomach bitters. Little did Archimedes wot,\nwhen he invented this term, that it would come into such general use.",
        "Its origin has been explained before, but it would not be out of place\nhere for me to tell it as I call it to mind now, looking back over\nArchie’s eventful life.",
        "King Hiero had ordered an eighteen karat crown, size 7-1/8, and, after\nreceiving it from the hands of the jeweler, suspected that it had been\nadulterated. He therefore applied to Archimedes to ascertain, if possible,\nwhether such was the case or not. Archimedes had just got in on No. 3, two\nhours late, and covered with dust. He at once started for a hot and cold\nbath emporium on Sixteenth street, meantime wondering how the dickens he\nwould settle that crown business.",
        "He filled the bath-tub level full, and, piling up his raiment on the\nfloor, jumped in. Displacing a large quantity of water, equal to his own\nbulk, he thereupon solved the question of specific gravity, and,\nforgetting his bill, forgetting his clothes, he sailed up Sixteenth street\nand all over Syracuse, clothed in shimmering sunlight and a plain gold\nring, shouting “Eureka!” He ran head-first into a Syracuse policeman and\nhowled “Eureka!” The policeman said: “You’ll have to excuse me; I don’t\nknow him.” He scattered the Syracuse Normal school on its way home, and\ntried to board a Fifteenth street bob-tail car, yelling “Eureka!” The\ncar-driver told him that Eureka wasn’t on the car, and referred Archimedes\nto a clothing store.",
        "Everywhere he was greeted with surprise. He tried to pay his car-fare, but\nfound that he had left his money in his other clothes.",
        "Some thought it was the revised statute of Hercules; that he had become\nweary of standing on his pedestal during the hot weather, and had started\nout for fresh air. I give this as I remember it. The story is foundered on\nfact.",
        "Archimedes once said: “Give me where I may stand, and I will move the\nworld.” I could write it in the original Greek, but, fearing that the\nnonpareil delirium tremens type might get short, I give it in the English\nlanguage.",
        "It may be tardy justice to a great mathematician and scientist, but I have\na few resolutions of respect which I would be very glad to get printed on\nthis solemn occasion, and mail copies of the paper to his relatives and\nfriends:",
        "“WHEREAS, It has pleased an All-wise Providence to remove from our midst\nArchimedes, who was ever at the front in all deserving labors and\nenterprises; and",
        "“WHEREAS, We can but feebly express our great sorrow in the loss of\nArchimedes, whose front name has escaped our memory; therefore",
        "“Resolved, That in his death we have lost a leading citizen of Syracuse,\nand one who never shook his friends–never weakened or gigged back on\nthose he loved.",
        "“Resolved, That copies of these resolutions will be spread on the\nmoments of the meeting of the Common Council of Syracuse, and that they be\npublished in the Syracuse papers eodtfpdq&cod, and that marked copies of\nsaid papers be mailed to the relatives of the deceased.”",
        "To the President-Elect.",
        "Dear Sir.–The painful duty of turning over to you the administration of\nthese United States and the key to the front door of the White House has\nbeen assigned to me. You will find the key hanging inside the storm-door,\nand the cistern-pole up stairs in the haymow of the barn. I have made a\ngreat many suggestions to the outgoing administration relative to the\ntransfer of the Indian bureau from the department of the Interior to that\nof the sweet by-and-by. The Indian, I may say, has been a great source of\nannoyance to me, several of their number having jumped one of my most\nvaluable mining claims on White river. Still, I do not complain of that.\nThis mine, however, I am convinced would be a good paying property if\nproperly worked, and should you at any time wish to take the regular army\nand such other help as you may need and re-capture it from our red\nbrothers, I would be glad to give you a controlling interest in it.",
        "You will find all papers in their appropriate pigeon-holes, and a small\njar of cucumber pickles down cellar, which were left over and to which you\nwill be perfectly welcome. The asperities and heart burnings that were the\nimmediate result of a hot and unusually bitter campaign are now all\nburied. Take these pickles and use them as though they were your own. They\nare none too good for you. You deserve them. We may differ politically,\nbut that need not interfere with our warm personal friendship.",
        "You will observe on taking possession of the administration, that the navy\nis a little bit weather-beaten and wormy. I would suggest that it be newly\npainted in the spring.

        "As soon as I learned that Mr. Sweeney had barely escaped being a crowned\nhead, I got acquainted with him and tried to cheer him up, and I told him\nthat people wouldn’t hold him in any way responsible, and that as it\nhadn’t shown itself in his family for years he might perhaps finally wear\nit out.",

        "But I was going to speak more in particular about Mr. Sweeney’s cat. Mr.\nSweeney had a large cat, named Dr. Mary Walker, of which he was very fond.\nDr. Mary Walker remained at the drug store all the time, and was known all\nover St. Paul as a quiet and reserved cat. If Dr. Mary Walker took in the\ntown after office hours, nobody seemed to know anything about it. She\nwould be around bright and cheerful the next morning and attend to her\nduties at the store just as though nothing whatever had happened.",
        "One day last summer Mr. Sweeney left a large plate of fly-paper with water\non it in the window, hoping to gather in a few quarts of flies in a\ndeceased state. Dr. Mary Walker used to go to this window during the\nafternoon and look out on the busy street while she called up pleasant\nmemories of her past life. That afternoon she thought she would call up\nsome more memories, so she went over on the counter and from there jumped\ndown on the window-sill, landing with all four feet in the plate of\nfly-paper.",
        "At first she regarded it as a joke, and treated the matter very lightly,\nbut later on she observed that the fly-paper stuck to her feet with great\ntenacity of purpose. Those who have never seen the look of surprise and\ndeep sorrow that a cat wears when she finds herself glued to a whole sheet\nof fly-paper, cannot fully appreciate the way Dr. Mary Walker felt. She\ndid not dash wildly through a $150 plate-glass window, as some cats would\nhave done. She controlled herself and acted in the coolest manner, though\nyou could have seen that mentally she suffered intensely. She sat down a\nmoment to more fully outline a plan for the future. In doing so, she made\na great mistake. The gesture resulted in glueing the fly-paper to her\nperson in such a way that the edge turned up behind in the most abrupt\nmanner, and caused her great inconvenience.",
        "Some one at that time laughed in a coarse and heartless way, and I wish\nyou could have seen the look of pain that Dr. Mary Walker gave him.",
        "Then she went away. She did not go around the prescription case as the\nrest of us did, but strolled through the middle of it, and so on out\nthrough the glass door at the rear of the store. We did not see her go\nthrough the glass door, but we found pieces of fly-paper and fur on the\nragged edges of a large aperture in the glass, and we kind of jumped at\nthe conclusion that Dr. Mary Walker had taken that direction in retiring\nfrom the room.",
        "Dr. Mary Walker never returned to St. Paul, and her exact whereabouts are\nnot known, though every effort was made to find her. Fragments of flypaper\nand brindle hair were found as far west as the Yellowstone National Park,\nand as far north as the British line, but the doctor herself was not\nfound. My own theory is, that if she turned her bow to the west so as to\ncatch the strong easterly gale on her quarter, with the sail she had set\nand her tail pointing directly toward the zenith, the chances for Dr. Mary\nWalker’s immediate return are extremely slim.",
        "There will always be a slight difference in the opinions of the young and\nthe mature, relative to the general plan on which the solar system should\nbe operated, no doubt. There are also points of disagreement in other\nmatters, and it looks as though there always would be.",

To the young there spreads out\nacross the horizon a glorious range of possibilities. After the youth has\nendorsed for an intimate friend a few times, and purchased the paper at\nthe bank himself later on, the horizon won’t seem to horizon so\ntumultuously as it did aforetime. I remember at one time of purchasing\nsuch a piece of accommodation paper at a bank, and I still have it. I\ndidn’t need it any more than a cat needs eleven tails at one and the same\ntime. Still the bank made it an object for me, and I secured it.

He is a\ngreat worker for political reform, but he cannot spell very well, so he\nhas asked me to write this letter. He knew that I had been thrown among\ngreat men all my life, and that, owing to my high social position and fine\neducation, I would be peculiarly fitted to write you in a way that would\nnot call forth disagreeable remarks, and so he has given me the points and\nI have arranged them for you.",
        "In the first place, my friend desires me to convey to you, Mr. President,\nin a delicate manner, and in such language as to avoid giving offense,\nthat he is somewhat disappointed in your Cabinet. I hate to talk this way\nto a bran-new President, but my friend feels hurt and he desires that I\nshould say to you that he regrets your short-sighted policy. He says that\nit seems to him there is very little in the course of the administration\nso far to encourage a man to shake off old party ties and try to make men\nbetter. He desires to say that after conversing with a large number of the\npurest men, men who have been in both political parties off and on for\nyears and yet have never been corrupted by office, men who have left\nconvention after convention in years past because those conventions were\ncorrupt and endorsed other men than themselves for office, he finds that\nyour appointment of Cabinet officers will only please two classes, viz:\nDemocrats and Republicans.",
        "Now, what do you care for an administration which will only gratify those\ntwo old parties? Are you going to snap your fingers in disdain at men who\nadmit that they are superior to anybody else? Do you want history to\nchronicle the fact that President Cleveland accepted the aid of the pure\nand highly cultivated gentlemen who never did anything naughty or\nunpretty, and then appointed his Cabinet from men who had been known for\nyears as rude, naughty Democrats?",
        "My friend says that he feels sure you would not have done so if you had\nfully realized how he felt about it. He claims that in the first week of\nyour administration you have basely truckled to the corrupt majority. You\nhave shown yourself to be the friend of men who never claimed to be truly\ngood.",
        "If you persist in this course you will lose the respect and esteem of my\nfriend and another man who is politically pure, and who has never smirched\nhis escutcheon with an office. He has one of the cleanest and most\nvigorous escutcheons in that county. He never leaves it out over night\nduring the summer, and in the winter he buries it in sawdust. Both of\nthese men will go back to the Republican party in 1888 if you persist in\nthe course you have thus far adopted. They would go back now if the\nRepublican party insisted on it.",
        "Mr. President, I hate to write to you in this tone of voice, because I\nknow the pain it will give you. I once held an office myself, Mr.\nPresident, and it hurt my feelings very much to have a warm personal\nfriend criticise my official acts.",
        "The worst feature of the whole thing, Mr. President, is that it will\nencourage crime. If men who never committed any crime are allowed to earn\ntheir living by the precarious methods peculiar to manual labor, and if\nthose who have abstained from office for years, by request of many\ncitizens, are to be denied the endorsement of the administration, they\nwill lose courage to go on and do right in the future. My friend desires\nto state vicariously, in the strongest terms, that both he and his wife\nfeel the same way about it, and they will not promise to keep it quiet any\nlonger. They feel like crippling the administration in every way they can\nif the present policy is to be pursued.",
        "He says he dislikes to begin thus early to threaten a President who has\nbarely taken off his overshoes and drawn his mileage, but he thinks it may\nprevent a recurrence of these unfortunate mistakes. He claims that you\nhave totally misunderstood the principles of the mugwumps all the way\nthrough. You seem to regard the reform movement as one introduced for the\npurpose of universal benefit. This was not the case. While fully endorsing\nand supporting reform, he says that they did not go into it merely to kill\ntime or simply for fun. He also says that when he became a reformer and\nsupported you, he did not think there were so many prominent Democrats who\nwould have claims upon you. He can only now deplore the great national\npoverty of offices and the boundless wealth of raw material in the\nDemocratic party from which to supply even that meagre demand.",
        "He wishes me to add, also, that you must have over-estimated the zeal of\nhis party for civil service reform. He says that they did not yearn for\ncivil service reform so much as many people seem to think.",
        "I must now draw this letter to a close. We are all well with the exception\nof colds in the head, but nothing that need give you any uneasiness. Our\nlarge seal-brown hen last week, stimulated by a rising egg market,\nover-exerted herself, and on Saturday evening, as the twilight gathered,\nshe yielded to a complication of pip and softening of the brain and\nexpired in my arms.

Toecorneous & Chilblainicus, alleged millers and wheat\nbuyers of Herculaneum, in which they claim to pay a quarter to a half-cent\nmore per bushel than we do for wheat, and charge us with docking the\nfarmers around Pompeii a pound per bushel more than necessary for cockle,\nwild buck-wheat, and pigeon-grass seed. They make the broad statement that\nwe have made all our money in that way, and claim that Mr. Lucretius, of\nour mill, has erected a fine house, which the farmers allude to as the\n\"wild buckwheat villa.”",

We desire to state to the Roman farmers that we do not test\ntheir wheat with the crooked brass tester that has made more money for\nMessrs. Toecorneous & Chilblainicus than their old mill has. We do not do\nthat kind of business. Neither do we buy a man’s wheat at a cash price and\nthen work off four or five hundred pounds of XXXX Imperial hog feed on him\nin part payment. When we buy a man’s wheat we pay him in money. We do not\nseek to fill him up with sour Carthagenian cracked wheat and orders on the\nstore.",

Last week we put a handle in the upper burr, and we have also\nengaged one of the best head millers in Pompeii to turn the crank\nday-times.

It was also used in a brick-yard here\nnear Pompeii; then an old junk man sold it to a tenderfoot from Jerusalem\nas an ice-cream freezer. He found that it would not work, and so used it\nto grind up potato bugs for blisters. Now it is grinding ostensible flour\nat Herculaneum.",
        "We desire to state to the farmers about Pompeii and Herculaneum that we\naim to please. We desire to make a grade of flour this summer that will\nnot have to be run through the coffee mill before it can be used. We will\nalso pay you the highest price for good wheat, and give you good weight.\nOur capacity is now greatly enlarged, both as to storage and grinding. We\nnow turn out a sack of flour, complete and ready for use, every little\nwhile.

I remember that I wore a large pair of\nMexican spurs, but I forgot them until the saddle turned. Then I\nremembered them. Sitting down on them in an impulsive way brought them to\nmy mind. Then the broncho steed sat down on me, and that gave the spurs an\nopportunity to make a more lasting impression on my mind.",
        "To those who observed the charger with the double “cinch” across his back\nand the saddle in front of him like a big leather corset, sitting at the\nsame time on my person, there must have been a tinge of amusement; but to\nme it was not so frolicsome.",
        "There may be joy in a wild gallop across the boundless plains, in the\ncrisp morning, on the back of a fleet broncho; but when you return with\nyour ribs sticking through your vest, and find that your nimble steed has\nreturned to town two hours ahead of you, there is a tinge of sadness about\nit all.",
        "Broncho Sam, however, made a specialty of doing all the riding himself. He\nwouldn’t enter into any compromise and allow the horse to ride him.",
        "In a reckless moment he offered to bet ten dollars that he could mount and\nride a wild Texas steer. The money was put up. That settled it. Sam never\ntook water. This was true in a double sense. Well, he climbed the\ncross-bar of the corral-gate, and asked the other boys to turn out their\nbest steer, Marquis of Queensbury rules.",
        "As the steer passed out, Sam slid down and wrapped those parenthetical\nlegs of his around that high-headed, broad-horned brute, and he rode him\ntill the fleet-footed animal fell down on the buffalo grass, ran his hot\nred tongue out across the blue horizon, shook his tail convulsively,\nswelled up sadly and died.",

        "The following paper was read by me in a clear, resonant tone of voice,\nbefore the Academy of Science and Pugilism at Erin Prairie, last month,\nand as I have been so continually and so earnestly importuned to print it\nthat life was no longer desirable, I submit it to you for that purpose,\nhoping that you will print my name in large caps, with astonishers at the\nhead of the article, and also in good display type at the close:",
        "No one could possibly, in a brief paper, do the subject of evolution full\njustice. It is a matter of great importance to our lost and undone race.\nIt lies near to every human heart, and exercises a wonderful influence\nover our impulses and our ultimate success or failure. When we pause to\nconsider the opaque and fathomless ignorance of the great masses of our\nfellow men on the subject of evolution, it is not surprising that crime is\nrather on the increase, and that thousands of our race are annually\nfilling drunkards’ graves, with no other visible means of support, while\nmultitudes of enlightened human beings are at the same time obtaining a\nlivelihood by meeting with felons’ dooms.",
        "These I would ask in all seriousness and in a tone of voice that would\nmelt the stoniest heart: “Why in creation do you do it?” The time is\nrapidly approaching when there will be two or three felons for each doom.\nI am sure that within the next fifty years, and perhaps sooner even than\nthat, instead of handing out these dooms to Tom, Dick and Harry as\nformerly, every applicant for a felon’s doom will have to pass through a\ncompetitive examination, as he should do.",
        "It will be the same with those who desire to fill drunkards’ graves. The\ntime is almost here when all positions of profit and trust will be\ncarefully and judiciously handed out, and those who do not fit themselves\nfor those positions will be left in the lurch, whatever that may be.",
        "It is with this fact glaring me in the face that I have consented to\nappear before you to-day and lay bare the whole hypothesis, history, rise\nand fall, modifications, anatomy, physiology and geology of evolution. It\nis for this that I have poured over such works as Huxley, Herbert Spencer,\nMoses in the bulrushes, Anaxagoras, Lucretius and Hoyle. It is for the\npurpose of advancing the cause of common humanity and to jerk the rising\ngeneration out of barbarism into the dazzling effulgence of clashing\nintellects and fermenting brains that I have sought the works of\nPythagoras, Democritus and Epluribus. Whenever I could find any book that\nbore upon the subject of evolution, and could borrow it, I have done so\nwhile others slept.",
        "That is a matter which rarely enters into the minds of those who go easily\nand carelessly through life. Even the general superintendent of the\nAcademy of Science and Pugilism here in Erin Prairie, the hotbed of a free\nand untrammeled, robust democracy, does not stop to think of the midnight\nand other kinds of oil that I have consumed in order to fill myself full\nof information and to soak my porous mind with thought. Even the O’Reilly\nCollege of this place, with its strong mental faculty, has not informed\nitself fully relative to the great effort necessary before a lecturer may\nspeak clearly, accurately and exhaustingly of evolution.",
        "And yet, here in this place, where education is rampant, and the idea is\npatted on the back, as I may say; here in Erin Prairie, where progress and\nsome other sentiments are written on everything; here where I am\naddressing you to-night for $2 and feed for my horse, I met a little child\nwith a bright and cheerful smile, who did not know that evolution\nconsisted in a progress from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous.",
        "So you see that you never know where ignorance lurks. The hydra-headed\nupas tree and bete noir of self-acting progress, is such ignorance as\nthat, lurking in the very shadow of magnificent educational institutions\nand hard words of great cast. Nothing can be more disagreeable to the\nscientist than a bete noir. Nothing gives him greater satisfaction than to\nchase it up a tree or mash it between two shingles.",
        "For this reason, as I said, it gives me great pleasure to address you on\nthe subject of evolution, and to go into details in speaking of it. I\ncould go on for hours as I have been doing, delighting you with the\nintricacies and peculiarities of evolution, but I must desist. It would\nplease me to do so, and you would no doubt remain patiently and listen,\nbut your business might suffer while you were away, and so I will close,\nbut I hope that anyone now within the sound of my voice, and in whose\nbreast a sudden hunger for more light on this great subject may have\nsprung up, will feel perfectly free to call on me and ask me about it or\nimmerse himself in the numerous tomes that I have collected from friends,\nand which relate to this matter.",
        "In closing I wish to say that I have made no statements in this paper\nrelative to evolution which I am not prepared to prove; and, if anything,\nI have been over-conservative. For that reason I say now, that the person\nwho doubts a single fact as I have given it to-night, bearing upon the\ngreat subject of evolution, will have to do so over my dumb remains.",
        "And a man who will do that is no gentleman. I presume that many of these\nstatements will be snapped up and sharply criticised by other theologians\nand many of our foremost thinkers, but they will do well to pause before\nthey draw me into a controversy, for I have other facts in relation to\nevolution, and some personal reminiscences and family history, which I am\nprepared to introduce, if necessary, together with ideas that I have\nthought up myself. So I say to those who may hope to attract notice and\nobtain notoriety by drawing me into a controversy, beware. It will be to\nyour interest to beware!",
        "I presume that I could write an entire library of personal reminiscences\nrelative to the eminent people with whom I have been thrown during a busy\nlife, but I hate to do it, because I always regarded such things as sacred\nfrom the vulgar eye, and I felt bound to respect the confidence of a\nprominent man just as much as I would that of one who was less before the\npeople. I remember very well my first meeting with General W.T. Sherman.\nI would not mention it here if it were not for the fact that the people\nseem so be yearning for personal reminiscences of great men, and that is\nperfectly right, too.",
        "It was since the war that I met General Sherman, and it was on the line of\nthe Union Pacific Railway, at one of those justly celebrated\neating-houses, which I understand are now abandoned. The colored waiter\nhad cut off a strip of the omelette with a pair of shears, the scorched\noatmeal had been passed around, the little rubber door mats fried in\nbutter and called pancakes had been dealt around the table, and the\ncashier at the end of the hall had just gone through the clothes of a\nparty from Vermont, who claimed a rebate on the ground that the waiter had\nrefused to bring him anything but his bill. There was no sound in the\ndining-room except the weak request of the coffee for more air and\nstimulants, or perhaps the cry of pain when the butter, while practicing\nwith the dumb-bells, would hit a child on the head; then all would be\nstill again.",
        "General Sherman sat at one end of the table, throwing a life-preserver to\na fly in the milk pitcher.",
        "We had never met before, though for years we had been plodding along\nlife’s rugged way–he in the war department, I in the postoffice\ndepartment. Unknown to each other, we had been holding up opposite corners\nof the great national fabric, if you will allow me that expression.",
        "I remember, as well as though it were but yesterday, how the conversation\nbegan. General Sherman looked sternly at me and said:",
        "“I wish you would overpower that butter and send it up this way.”",
        "“All right,” said I, “if you will please pass those molasses.”",
        "That was all that was said, but I shall never forget it, and probably he\nnever will. The conversation was brief, but yet how full of food for\nthought! How true, how earnest, how natural! Nothing stilted or false\nabout it. It was the natural expression of two minds that were too great\nto be verbose or to monkey with social, conversational flapdoodle.",
        "I remember, once, a great while ago, I was asked by a friend to go with\nhim in the evening to the house of an acquaintance, where they were going\nto have a kind of musicale, at which there was to be some noted pianist,\nwho had kindly consented to play a few strains, I did not get the name of\nthe professional, but I went, and when the first piece was announced I saw\nthat the light was very uncertain, so I kindly volunteered to get a lamp\nfrom another room. I held that big lamp, weighing about twenty-nine\npounds, for half an hour, while the pianist would tinky tinky up on the\nright hand, or bang, boomy to bang down on the bass, while he snorted and\nslugged that old concert grand piano and almost knocked its teeth down its\nthroat, or gently dawdled with the keys like a pale moonbeam shimmering\nthrough the bleached rafters of a deceased horse, until at last there was\na wild jangle, such as the accomplished musician gives to an instrument to\nshow the audience that he has disabled the piano, and will take a slight\nintermission while it is sent to the junk shop.",
        "With a sigh of relief I carefully put down the twenty-nine pound lamp, and\nmy friend told me that I had been standing there like liberty enlightening\nthe world, and holding that heavy lamp for Blind Tom.",
        "I had never seen him before, and I slipped out of the room before he had a\nchance to see me.",
        "I am glad to notice that in the East there is a growing disfavor in the\npublic mind for selecting a practicing physician for the office of\ncoroner. This matter should have attracted attention years ago. Now it\ngratifies me to notice a finer feeling on the part of the people, and an\nawakening of those sensibilities which go to make life more highly prized\nand far more enjoyable.",
        "I had the misfortune at one time to be under the medical charge of a\ncoroner who had graduated from a Chicago morgue and practiced medicine\nalong with his inquest business with the most fiendish delight. I do not\nknow which he enjoyed best, holding the inquest or practicing on his\npatient and getting the victim ready for the quest.",
        "One day he wrote out a prescription and left it for me to have filled. I\nwas surprised to find that he had made a mistake and left a rough draft of\nthe verdict in my own case and a list of jurors which he had made in\nmemorandum, so as to be ready for the worst. I was alarmed, for I did not\nknow that I was in so dangerous a condition. He had the advantage of me,\nfor he knew just what he was giving me, and how long human life could be\nsustained under his treatment. I did not.",
        "That is why I say that the profession of medicine should not be allowed to\nconflict with the solemn duties of the coroner. They are constantly\nclashing and infringing upon each other’s territory. This coroner had a\nkind of tread-softly-bow-the-head way of getting around the room that made\nmy flesh creep. He had a way, too, when I was asleep, of glancing\nhurriedly through the pockets of my pantaloons as they hung over a chair,\nprobably to see what evidence he could find that might aid the jury in\narriving at a verdict. Once I woke up and found him examining a draft that\nhe had found in my pocket. I asked him what he was doing with my funds,\nand he said that he thought he detected a draft in the room and he had\njust found out where it came from.",
        "After that I hoped that death would come to my relief as speedily as\npossible. I felt that death would be a happy release from the cold touch\nof the amateur coroner and pro tem physician. I could look forward with\npleasure, and even joy, to the moment when my physician would come for the\nlast time in his professional capacity and go to work on me officially.\nThen the county would be obliged to pay him, and the undertaker could take\ncharge of the fragments left by the inquest.",
        "The duties of the physician are with the living, those of the coroner with\nthe dead. No effort, therefore, should be made to unite them. It is in\nviolation of all the finer feelings of humanity. When the physician\ndecides that his tendencies point mostly toward immortality and the names\nof his patients are nearly all found on the moss-covered stones of the\ncemetery, he may abandon the profession with safety and take hold of\npolitics. Then, should his tastes lead him to the inquest, let him\ngravitate toward the office of coroner; but the two should not be united.",
        "No man ought to follow his fellow down the mysterious river that defines\nthe boundary between the known and the unknown, and charge him\nprofessionally till his soul has fled, and then charge a per diem to the\ncounty for prying into his internal economy and holding an inquest over\nthe debris of mortality. I therefore hail this movement with joy and wish\nto encourage it in every way. It points toward a degree of enlightenment\nwhich will be in strong contrast with the darker and more ignorant epochs\nof time, when the practice of medicine was united with the profession of\nthe barber, the well-digger, the farrier, the veterinarian or the coroner.",
        "Why, this physician plenipotentiary and coroner extraordinary that I have\nreferred to, didn’t know when he got a call whether to take his morphine\nsyringe or his venire for a jury. He very frequently went to see a patient\nwith a lung tester under one arm and the revised statutes under the other.\nPeople never knew when they saw him going to a neighbor’s house, whether\nthe case had yielded to the coroner’s treatment or not. No one ever knew\njust when over-taxed nature would yield to the statutes in such case made\nand provided.",
        "When the jury was impanelled, however, we always knew that the medical\ntreatment had been successfully fatal.",
        "Once he charged the county with an inquest he felt sure of, but in the\nnight the patient got delirious, eluded his nurse, the physician and\ncoroner, and fled to the foot-hills, where he was taken care of and\nfinally recovered.",
        "The experiences of some of the patients who escaped from this man read\nmore like fiction than fact. One man revived during the inquest, knocked\nthe foreman of the jury through the window, kicked the coroner in the\nstomach, fed him a bottle of violet ink, and, with a shriek of laughter,\nfled. He is now traveling under an assumed name with a mammoth circus,\nfeeding his bald head to the African lion twice a day at $9 a week and\nfound.",

        "But in Maine none of these common styles of invitation prevail. It is all\nshrouded in mystery. You give the sign of distress to any member in good\nstanding, pound three times on the outer gate, give two hard kicks and one\nsoft one on the inner door, give the password, “Rutherford B.

        "She was perfectly ladylike in her manner, but a little bit drunk. It is\nsingular how drunken people will come hundreds of miles to converse with\nme. I have often been alluded to as the “drunkard’s friend.” Men have been\nknown to get intoxicated and come a long distance to talk with me on some\nsubject, and then they would lean up against me and converse by the hour.\nA drunken man never seems to get tired of talking with me.

        "I once had a friend who was very much liked by every one, so he drifted\ninto politics. For seven years he tried to live on free whiskey and\npopular approval, but it wrecked him at last.

Imagine yourself a child, gentle reader, in a family where\nyou would be called upon, every morning, to select your own cud of spruce\ngum from a collection of seventeen similar cuds stuck on a window sill.\nAnd yet B. Franklin never murmured or repined. He desired to go to sea,\nand to avoid this he was apprenticed to his brother James, who was a\nprinter. It is said that Franklin at once took hold of the great\nArchimedean lever, and jerked it early and late in the interests of\nfreedom. It is claimed that Franklin at this time invented the deadly\nweapon known as the printer’s towel. He found that a common crash towel\ncould be saturated with glue, molasses, antimony, concentrated lye, and\nroller composition, and that after a few years of time and perspiration it\nwould harden so that the “Constant Reader” or “Veritas” could be stabbed\nwith it and die soon.",

In those days you couldn’t sass the king, and then,\nwhen the king came in the office the next day and stopped his paper, and\ntook out his ad., you couldn’t put it off on “our informant” and go right\nalong with the paper.

        "At the age of 17, Ben got disgusted with his brother, and went to\nPhiladelphia and New York, where he got a chance to “sub” for a few weeks,\nand then got a regular “sit.” Franklin was a good printer, and finally got\nto be a foreman. He made an excellent foreman, sitting by the hour in the\ncomposing room and spitting on the stone, while he cussed the make-up and\npress work of the other papers. Then he would go into the editorial rooms\nand scare the editors to death with a wild shriek for more copy.

It looked odd to the English, of course,\nto see him come into the royal presence, and, leaving his wet umbrella up\nagainst the throne, ask the king: “How’s trade?” Franklin never put on any\nfrills, but he was not afraid of a crowned head.

        "Life insurance is a great thing. I would not be without it. My health is\ngreatly improved since I got my new policy. Formerly I used to have a\nseal-brown taste in my mouth when I arose in the morning, but that has\nentirely disappeared. I am more hopeful and happy, and my hair is getting\nthicker on top. I would not try to keep house without life insurance. Last\nSeptember I was caught in one of the most destructive cyclones that ever\nvisited a republican form of government. A great deal of property was\ndestroyed and many lives were lost, but I was spared. People who had no\ninsurance were mowed down on every hand, but aside from a broken leg I was\nentirely unharmed.",
        "I look upon life insurance as a great comfort, not only to the\nbeneficiary, but to the insured, who very rarely lives to realize anything\npecuniarily from his venture. Twice I have almost raised my wife to\naffluence and cast a gloom over the community in which I lived, but\nsomething happened to the physician for a few days so that he could not\nattend to me, and I recovered. For nearly two years I was under the\ndoctor’s care. He had his finger on my pulse or in my pocket all the time.\nHe was a young western physician, who attended me on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nThe rest of the week he devoted his medical skill to horses that were\nmentally broken down. He said he attended me largely for my society. I\nfelt flattered to know that he enjoyed my society after he had been thrown\namong horses all the week that had much greater advantages than I.",
        "My wife at first objected seriously to an insurance on my life, and said\nshe would never, never touch a dollar of the money if I were to die, but\nafter I had been sick nearly two years, and my disposition had suffered a\ngood deal, she said that I need not delay the obsequies on that account.\nBut the life insurance slipped through my fingers somehow, and I\nrecovered.",

        "I have always had a horror of opiates of all kinds. They are so seductive\nand so still in their operations. They steal through the blood like a wolf\non the trail, and they seize upon the heart at last with their white fangs\ntill it is still forever.",
        "Up the Laramie there is a cluster of ranches at the base of the Medicine\nBow, near the north end of Sheep Mountain, and in sight of the glittering,\neternal frost of the snowy range. These ranches are the homes of the young\nmen from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Ohio, and now there are several\n\"younger sons” of Old England, with herds of horses, steers and sheep,\nworth millions of dollars. These young men are not of the kind of whom the\nmetropolitan ass writes as saying “youbetcherlife,” and calling everybody\n\"pardner.” They are many of them college graduates, who can brand a wild\nMaverick or furnish the easy gestures for a Strauss waltz.",

        "Well, a young man whom we will call Curtis lived at one of these ranches\nyears ago, and, though a quiet, mind-your-own-business fellow, who had\nabsolutely no enemies among his companions, he had the misfortune to incur\nthe wrath of a tramp sheep-herder, who waylaid Curtis one afternoon and\nshot him dead as he sat in his buggy. Curtis wasn’t armed. He didn’t dream\nof trouble till he drove home from town, and, as he passed through the\ngates of a corral, saw the hairy face of the herder, and at the same\nmoment the flash of a Winchester rifle. That was all.",
        "A rancher came into town and telegraphed to Curtis’ father, and then a\nhalf dozen citizens went out to help capture the herder, who had fled to\nthe sage brush of the foot-hills.",
        "They didn’t get back till toward daybreak, but they brought the herder\nwith them, I saw him in the gray of the morning, lying in a coarse gray\nblanket, on the floor of the engine house. He was dead.",
        "I asked, as a reporter, how he came to his death, and they told me–opium!\nI said, did I understand you to say “ropium?” They said no, it was opium.\nThe murderer had taken poison when he found that escape was impossible.",
        "I was present at the inquest, so that I could report the case. There was\nvery little testimony, but all the evidence seemed to point to the fact\nthat life was extinct, and a verdict of death by his own hand was\nrendered.",
        "It was the first opium work I had ever seen, and it aroused my curiosity.\nDeath by opium, it seems, leaves a dark purple ring around the neck. I did\nnot know this before. People who die by opium also tie their hands\ntogether before they die. This is one of the eccentricities of opium\npoisoning that I have never seen laid down in the books. I bequeath it to\nmedical science. Whenever I run up against a new scientific discovery, I\njust hand it right over to the public without cost.",
        "Ever since the above incident, I have been very apprehensive about people\nwho seem to be likely to form the opium habit. It is one of the most\ndeadly of narcotics, especially in a new country. High up in the pure\nmountain atmosphere, this man could not secure enough air to prolong life,\nand he expired. In a land where clear, crisp air and delightful scenery\nare abundant, he turned his back upon them both and passed away. Is it not\nsad to contemplate?",
        "My dear son.–I tried to write to you last week, but didn’t get around to\nit, owing to circumstances. I went away on a little business tower for a\nfew days on the cars, and then when I got home the sociable broke loose in\nour once happy home.",
        "While on my commercial tower down the Omehaw railroad buying a new\nwell-diggin’ machine of which I had heard a good deal pro and con, I had\nthe pleasure of riding on one of them sleeping-cars that we read so much\nabout.",
        "I am going on 50 years old, and that’s the first time I ever slumbered at\nthe rate of forty-five miles per hour, including stops.",
        "I got acquainted with the porter, and he blacked my boots in the night\nunbeknownst to me, while I was engaged in slumber. He must have thought\nthat I was your father, and that we rolled in luxury at home all the time,\nand that it was a common thing for us to have our boots blacked by\nmenials. When I left the car this porter brushed my clothes till the hot\nflashes ran up my spinal column, and I told him that he had treated me\nsquare, and I rung his hand when he held it out toards me, and I told him\nthat at any time he wanted a good, cool drink of buttermilk, to just\nholler through our telephone. We had the sociable at our house last week,\nand when I got home your mother set me right to work borryin’ chairs and\ndishes. She had solicited some cakes and other things. I don’t know\nwhether you are on the skedjule by which these sociables are run or not.\nThe idea is a novel one to me.",

        "Well, we had a good time and used up 150 cookies in a short time. Part of\nthese cookies was devoured and the balance was trod into our all-wool\ncarpet. Several of the young people got to playing Copenhagen in the\nsetting-room and stepped on the old cat in such a way as to disfigure him\nfor life. They also had a disturbance in the front room and knocked off\nsome of the plastering.",
        "So your mother is feeling slim and I am not very chipper myself. I hope\nthat you are working hard at your books so that you will be an ornament to\nsociety. Society is needing some ornaments very much. I sincerely hope\nthat you will not begin to monkey with rum. I should hate to have you with\na felon’s doom or fill a drunkard’s grave. If anybody has got to fill a\ndrunkard’s grave, let him do it himself. What has the drunkard ever done\nfor you, that you should fill his grave for him?",
        "I expect you to do right, as near as possible. You will not do exactly\nright all the time, but try to strike a good average. I do not expect you\nto let your studies encroach, too much on your polo, but try to unite the\ntwo so that you will not break down under the strain. I should feel sad\nand mortified to have you come home a physical wreck. I think one physical\nwreck in a family is enough, and I am rapidly getting where I can do the\nentire physical wreck business for our neighborhood.",
        "I see by your picture that you have got one of them pleated coats with a\nbelt around it, and short pants. They make you look as you did when I used\nto spank you in years gone by, and I feel the same old desire to do it now\nthat I did then. Old and feeble as I am, it seems to me as though I could\nspank a boy that wears knickerbocker pants buttoned onto a Garabaldy waist\nand a pleated jacket. If it wasn’t for them cute little camel’s hair\nwhiskers of yours I would not believe that you had grown to be a large,\nexpensive boy, grown up with thoughts. Some of the thoughts you express in\nyour letters are far beyond your years. Do you think them yourself, or is\nthere some boy in the school that thinks all the thoughts for the rest?",
        "Some of your letters are so deep that your mother and I can hardly grapple\nwith them. One of them, especially, was so full of foreign stuff that you\nhad got out of a bill of fare, that we will have to wait till you come\nhome before we can take it in. I can talk a little Chippewa, but that is\nall the foreign language I am familiar with. When I was young we had to\nget our foreign languages the best we could, so I studied Chippewa without\na master. A Chippewa chief took me into his camp and kept me there for\nsome time while I acquired his language. He became so much attached to me\nthat I had great difficulty in coming away. I wish you would write in the\nUnited States dialect as much as possible, and not try to paralize your\nparents with imported expressions that come too high for poor people.",
        "Remember that you are the only boy we’ve got, and we are only going\nthrough the motions of living here for your sake. For us the day is\nwearing out, and it is now way long into the shank of the evening. All we\nask of you is to improve on the old people. You can see where I fooled\nmyself, and you can do better. Read and write, and sifer, and polo, and\nget nolledge, and try not to be ashamed of your uncultivated parents.",
        "When you get that checkered little sawed-off coat on, and that pair of\nknee panties, and that poker-dot necktie, and the sassy little boys holler\n\"rats” when you pass by, and your heart is bowed down, remember that, no\nmatter how foolish you may look, your parents will never sour on you.",

        "When I first came to Utah, I saw one day, in Salt Lake City, a young girl\narrive. She was in the heyday of life, but she couldn’t talk our language.\nHer face was oval; rather longer than it was wide, I noticed, and, though\nshe was still young, there were traces of care and other foreign\nsubstances plainly written there.",
        "She was an emigrant, about seventeen years of age, and, though she had\nbeen in Salt Lake City an hour and a half, she was still unmarried.",
        "She was about the medium height, with blue eyes, that somehow, as you\nexamined them carefully in the full, ruddy light of a glorious September\nafternoon, seemed to resemble each other. Both of them were that way,",
        "I know not what gave me the courage, but I stepped to her side, and in a\nlow voice told her of my love and asked her to be mine.",
        "She looked askance at me. Nobody ever did that to me before and lived to\ntell the tale. But her sex made me overlook it. Had she been any other sex\nthat I can think of, I would have resented it. But I would not strike a\nwoman, especially when I had not been married to her and had no right to\ndo so.",
        "I turned on my heel and I went away. I most always turn on my heel when I\ngo away. If I did not turn on my own heel when I went away, whose heel\nwould a lonely man like me turn upon?",
        "Years rolled by. I did nothing to prevent it. Still that face came to me\nin my lonely hut far up in the mountains. That look still rankled in my\nmemory. Before that my memory had been all right. Nothing had ever rankled\nin it very much. Let the careless reader who never had his memory rankle\nin hot weather, pass this by. This story is not for him.",
        "After our first conversation we did not meet again for three years, and\nthen by the merest accident. I had been out for a whole afternoon, hunting\nan elderly goat that had grown childish and irresponsible. He had wandered\naway, and for several days I had been unable to find him. So I sought for\nhim till darkness found me several miles from my cabin. I realized at once\nthat I must hurry back, or lose my way and spend the night in the\nmountains. The darkness became more rapidly obvious. My way became more\nand more uncertain.",
        "Finally I fell down an old prospect shaft. I then resolved to remain where\nI was until I could decide what was best to be done. If I had known that\nthe prospect shaft was there, I would have gone another way. There was\nanother way that I could have gone, but it did not occur to me until too\nlate.",
        "I hated to spend the next few weeks in the shaft, for I had not locked up\nmy cabin when I left it, and I feared that someone might get in while I\nwas absent and play on the piano. I had also set a batch of bread and two\nhens that morning, and all of these would be in sad knead of me before I\ncould get my business into such shape that I could return.",
        "I could not tell accurately how long I had been in the shaft, for I had no\nmatches by which to see my watch. I also had no watch.",
        "All at once, someone fell down the shaft. I knew that it was a woman,\nbecause she did not swear when she landed at the bottom. Still, this could\nbe accounted for in another way. She was unconscious when I picked her up.",
        "I did not know what to do, I was perfectly beside myself, and so was she.\nI had read in novels that when a woman became unconscious people generally\nchafed her hands, but I did not know whether I ought to chafe the hands of\na person to whom I had never been introduced.",
        "I could have administered alcoholic stimulants to her but I had neglected\nto provide myself with them when I fell down the shaft. This should be a\nwarning to people who habitually go around the country without alcoholic\nstimulants.",
        "Finally she breathed a long sigh and murmured, “where am I?” I told her\nthat I did not know, but wherever it might be, we were safe, and that\nwhatever she might say to me, I would promise her, should go no farther.",
        "Then there was a long pause.",
        "To encourage further conversation I asked her if she did not think we had\nbeen having a rather backward spring. She said we had, but she prophesied\na long, open fall.",
        "Then there was another pause, after which I offered her a seat on an old\nred empty powder can. Still, she seemed shy and reserved. I would make a\nremark to which she would reply briefly, and then there would be a pause\nof a little over an hour. Still it seemed longer.",
        "Suddenly the idea of marriage presented itself to my mind. If we never got\nout of the shaft, of course an engagement need not be announced. No one\nhad ever plighted his or her troth at the bottom of a prospect shaft\nbefore. It was certainly unique, to say the least. I suggested it to her.",
        "She demurred to this on the ground that our acquaintance had been so\nbrief, and that we had never been thrown together before. I told her that\nthis would be no objection, and that my parents were so far away that I\ndid not think they would make any trouble about it.",
        "She said that she did not mind her parents so much as she did the violent\ntemper of her husband.",
        "I asked her if her husband had ever indulged in polygamy. She replied that\nhe had, frequently. He had several previous wives. I convinced her that in\nthe eyes of the law, and under the Edmunds bill, she was not bound to him.\nStill she feared the consequences of his wrath.",
        "Then I suggested a desperate plan. We would elope!",
        "I was now thirty-seven years old, and yet had never eloped. Neither had\nshe. So, when the first streaks of rosy dawn crept across the soft,\nautumnal sky and touched the rich and royal coloring on the rugged sides\nof the grim old mountains, we got out of the shaft and eloped.",
        "I desire to state that my position as United States Cyclonist for this\nJudicial District is now vacant. I resigned on the 9th day of September,\nA.D. 1884.",
        "I have not the necessary personal magnetism to look a cyclone in the eye\nand make it quail. I am stern and even haughty in my intercourse with men,\nbut when a Manitoba simoon takes me by the brow of my pantaloons and\nthrows me across Township 28, Range 18, West of the 5th Principal\nMeridian, I lose my mental reserve and become anxious and even taciturn.\nFor thirty years I had yearned to see a grown up cyclone, of the\nring-tail-puller variety, mop up the green earth with huge forest trees\nand make the landscape look tired. On the 9th day of September, A.D. 1884,\nmy morbid curiosity was gratified.",
        "As the people came out into the forest with lanterns and pulled me out of\nthe crotch of a basswood tree with a “tackle and fall,” I remember I told\nthem I didn’t yearn for any more atmospheric phenomena. The old desire for\na hurricane that would blow a cow through a penitentiary was satiated. I\nremember when the doctor pried the bones of my leg together, in order to\nkind of draw my attention away from the limb, he asked me how I liked the\nfall style of Zephyr in that locality.",
        "I said it was all right, what there was of it. I said this in a tone of\nbitter irony.",
        "Cyclones are of two kinds, viz: the dark maroon cyclone; and the iron gray\ncyclone with pale green mane and tail. It was the latter kind I frolicked\nwith on the above-named date.",
        "My brother and I were riding along in the grand old forest, and I had just\nbeen singing a few bars from the opera of “Whoop ’em Up, Lizzie Jane,\"\nwhen I noticed that the wind was beginning to sough through the trees.\nSoon after that, I noticed that I was soughing through the trees also, and\nI am really no slouch of a sougher, either, when I get started.",
        "The horse was hanging by the breeching from the bough of a large butternut\ntree, waiting for some one to come and pick him.",
        "I did not see my brother at first, but after a while he disengaged himself\nfrom a rail fence and came where I was hanging, wrong end up, with my\npersonal effects spilling out of my pockets. I told him that as soon as\nthe wind kind of softened down, I wished he would go and pick the horse.\nHe did so, and at midnight a party of friends carried me into town on a\nstretcher. It was quite an ovation. To think of a torchlight procession\ncoming way out there into the woods at midnight, and carrying me into town\non their shoulders in triumph! And yet I was once only a poor boy!",
        "It shows what may be accomplished by anyone if he will persevere and\ninsist on living a different life.",
        "The cyclone is a natural phenomenon, enjoying the most robust health. It\nmay be a pleasure for a man with great will power and an iron constitution\nto study more carefully into the habits of the cyclone, but as far as I am\nconcerned, individually, I could worry along some way if we didn’t have a\nphenomenon in the house from one year’s end to another.",
        "As I sit here, with my leg in a silicate of soda corset, and watch the\nmerry throng promenading down the street, or mingling in the giddy\ntorchlight procession, I cannot repress a feeling toward a cyclone that\nalmost amounts to disgust.",

        "The Arabian letter “jeem” or “jim,” which corresponds with our J,\nresembles some of the spectacular wonders seen by the delirium tremons\nexpert. I do not know whether that is the reason the letter is called jeem\nor jim, or not.",
        "The letter “sheen” or “shin,” which is some like our “sh” in its effect,\nis a very pretty letter, and enough of them would make very attractive\ntrimming for pantalets or other clothing. The entire Arabic alphabet, I\nthink, would work up first-rate into trimming for aprons, skirts, and so\nforth.",
        "Still it is not so rich in variety as the Chinese language. A Chinaman who\ndesires to publish a paper in order to fill a long felt want, must have a\nsmall fortune in order to buy himself an alphabet. In this country we get\na press, and then, if we have any money left, we lay it out in type; but\nin China the editor buys himself an alphabet and then regards the press as\na mere annex. If you go to a Chinese type maker and ask him to show you\nhis goods, he will ask you whether you want a two or a three story\nalphabet.",
        "The Chinese compositor spends most of his time riding up and down the\nelevator, seeking for letters and dusting them off with a feather duster.\nIn large and wealthy offices the compositor sits at his case with the copy\nbefore him, and has five or six boys running from one floor to another,\nbringing him the letters of this wild and peculiar alphabet.",
        "Sometimes they have to stop in the middle of a long editorial and send\ndown to Hong Kong and have a letter cast specially for that editorial.",
        "Chinese compositors soon die from heart disease, because they have to run\nup stairs and down so much in order to get the different letters needed.",
        "One large publisher tried to have his case arranged in a high building\nwithout floors, so that the compositor could reach each type by means of a\nlong pole, but one day there was a slight earthquake shock that spilled\nthe entire alphabet out of the case, all over the floor, and although that\nwas ninety-seven years ago last April, there are still two bushels of pi\non the floor of that office. The paper employs rat printers, and as they\nhave been engaged in assorting and distributing this mass of pi, it is\ncalled rat pi in China, and the term is quite popular.",
        "When the editor underscores a word, the Chinese compositor charges $9\nextra for italicizing it. This is nothing more than fair, for he may have\nto go all over the empire, and climb twenty-seven flights of stairs to\nfind the necessary italics. So it is much more economical in China to use\nbody type mostly in setting up a paper, and the old journalist will avoid\ncaps and italics, unless he is very wealthy.",
        "Arabian literature is very rich, and more especially so in verse. How the\nArabian poets succeeded so well in writing their verse in their own\nlanguage, I can hardly understand. I find it very difficult to write\npoetry which will be greedily snapped up and paid for, even when written\nin the English language, but if I had to paw around for an hour to get a\nbutton-hook for the end of the fourth line, so that it would rhyme with\nthe button-hook in the second line of the same verse, I believe it would\ndrive me mad.",
        "The Arabian writer is very successful in a tale of fiction. He loves to\ntake a tale and re-write it for the press by carefully expunging the\nfacts. It is in lyric and romantic writing that he seems to excel.",
        "The Arabian Nights is the most popular work that has survived the harsh\ntouch of time. Its age is not fully known, and as the author has been dead\nseveral hundred years, I feel safe in saying that a number of the\nincidents contained in this book are grossly inaccurate.",
        "It has been translated several times with more or less success by various\nwriters, and some of the statements contained in the book are well worthy\nof the advanced civilization, and wild word painting incident to a heated\npresidential campaign.",
        "We arrived in Verona day before yesterday. Most every one has heard of the\nTwo Gentlemen of Verona. This is the place they came from. They have never\nreturned. Verona is not noted for its gentlemen now. Perhaps that is the\nreason I was regarded as such a curiosity when I came here.",
        "Verona is a good deal older town than Chicago, but the two cities have\npoints of resemblance after all. When the southern simoon from the stock\nyards is wafted across the vinegar orchards of Chicago, and a load of\nMormon emigrants get out at the Rock Island depot and begin to move around\nand squirm and emit the fragrance of crushed Limburger cheese, it reminds\none of Verona.",
        "The sky is similar, too. At night, when it is raining hard, the sky of\nChicago and Verona is not dissimilar. Chicago is the largest place,\nhowever, and my sympathies are with her. Verona has about 68,000 people\nnow, aside from myself. This census includes foreigners and Indians not\ntaxed.",
        "Verona has an ancient skating rink, known in history as the amphitheatre,\nIt is 404-1/2 feet by 516 in size, and the wall is still 100 feet high in\nplaces. The people of Verona wanted me to lecture there, but I refrained.\nI was afraid that some late comers might elbow their way in and leave one\nend of the amphitheatre open and then there would be a draft. I will speak\nmore fully on the subject of amphitheatres in another letter. There isn’t\nroom in this one.",
        "Verona is noted for the Capitular library, as it is called. This is said\nto be the largest collection of rejected manuscripts in the world. I stood\nin with the librarian and he gave me an opportunity to examine this\nwonderful store of literary work. I found a Virgil that was certainly over\n1,600 years old. I also found a well preserved copy of “Beautiful Snow.” I\nread it. It was very touching indeed. Experts said it was 1,700 years old,\nwhich is no doubt correct. I am no judge of the age of MSS. Some can look\nat the teeth of a literary production and tell within two weeks how old it\nis, but I can’t. You can also fool me on the age of wine. My rule used to\nbe to observe how old I felt the next day and to fix that as the age of\nthe wine, but this rule I find is not infallible. One time I found myself\nfeeling the next day as though I might be 138 years old, but on\ninvestigation we found that the wine was extremely new, having been made\nat a drug store in Cheyenne that same day.",
        "Looking these venerable MSS. over, I noticed that the custom of writing\nwith a violet pencil on both sides of the large foolscap sheet, and then\nfolding it in sixteen directions and carrying it around in the pocket for\ntwo or three centuries, is not a late American invention, as I had been\nled to suppose. They did it in Italy fifteen centuries ago. I was\npermitted also to examine the celebrated institutes of Gaius. Gaius was a\npoor penman, and I am convinced from a close examination of his work that\nhe was in the habit of carrying his manuscript around in his pocket with\nhis smoking tobacco. The guide said that was impossible, for smoking\ntobacco was not introduced into Italy until a comparatively late day.\nThat’s all right, however. You can’t fool me much on the odor of smoking\ntobacco.",
        "The churches of Verona are numerous, and although they seem to me a little\ndifferent from our own in many ways, they resemble ours in others. One\nthing that pleased me about the churches of Verona was the total absence\nof the church fair and festival as conducted in America. Salvation seems\nto be handed out in Verona without ice cream and cake, and the odor of\nsancity and stewed oysters do not go inevitably hand in hand. I have\nalready been in the place more than two days and I have not yet been\ninvited to help lift the old church debt on the cathedral. Perhaps they\nthink I am not wealthy, however. In fact there is nothing about my dress\nor manner that would betray my wealth. I have been in Europe now six weeks\nand have kept my secret well. Even my most intimate traveling companions\ndo not know that I am the Laramie City postmaster in disguise.",
        "The cathedral is a most imposing and massive pile. I quote this from the\nguide book. This beautiful structure contains a baptismal font cut out of\none solid block of stone and made for immersion, with an inside diameter\nof ten feet. A man nine feet high could be baptized there without injury.\nThe Venetians have a great respect for water. They believe it ought not to\nbe used for anything else but to wash away sins, and even then they are\nvery economical about it.",
        "There is a nice picture here by Titian. It looks as though it had been\nleft in the smoke house 900 years and overlooked. Titian painted a great\ndeal. You find his works here ever and anon. He must have had all he could\ndo in Italy in an early day, when the country was new. I like his pictures\nfirst rate, but I haven’t found one yet that I could secure at anything\nlike a bed rock price.",
        "I have just received the following letter, which I take the liberty of\npublishing, in order that good may come out of it, and that the public\ngenerally may be on the watch:",
        "William Nye, Esq.–",
        "Dear Sir: There has been a great religious upheaval here, and great\nanxiety on the part of our entire congregation, and I write to you, hoping\nthat you may have some suggestions to offer that we could use at this time\nbeneficially.",
        "All the bitter and irreverent remarks of Bob Ingersoll have fallen\nharmlessly upon the minds of our people. The flippant sneers and wicked\nsarcasms of the modern infidel, wise in his own conceit, have alike passed\nover our heads without damage or disaster. These times that have tried\nmen’s souls have only rooted us more firmly in the faith, and united us\nmore closely as brothers and sisters.",
        "We do not care whether the earth was made in two billion years or two\nminutes, so long as it was made and we are satisfied with it. We do not\ncare whether Jonah swallowed the whale or the whale swallowed Jonah. None\nof these things worry us in the least. We do not pin our faith on such\nlittle matters as those, but we try to so live that when we pass on beyond\nthe flood we may have a record to which we may point with pride.",
        "But last Sabbath our entire congregation was visibly moved. People who had\ngrown gray in this church got right up during the service and went out,\nand did not come in again. Brothers who had heard all kinds of infidelity\nand scorned to be moved by it, got up, and kicked the pews, and slammed\nthe doors, and created a young riot.",
        "For many years we have sailed along in the most peaceful faith, and\nthrough joy or sorrow we came to the church together to worship. We have\nlaughed and wept as one family for a quarter of a century, and an humble\ndignity and Christian style of etiquette have pervaded our incomings and\nour outgoings.",
        "That is the reason why a clear case of disorderly conduct in our church\nhas attracted attention and newspaper comment. That is the reason why we\nwant in some public way to have the church set right before we suffer from\nunjust criticism and worldly scorn.",
        "It has been reported that one of the brothers, who is sixty years of age,\nand a model Christian, and a good provider, rose during the first prayer,\nand, waving his plug hat in the air, gave a wild and blood-curdling whoop,\njumped over the back of his pew, and lit out. While this is in a measure\ntrue, it is not accurate. He did do some wild and startling jumping, but\nhe did not jump over the pew. He tried to, but failed. He was too old.",
        "It has also been stated that another brother, who has done more to build\nup the church and society here than any other one man of his size, threw\nhis hymn book across the church, and, with a loud wail that sounded like\nthe word “Gosh!” hissed through clenched teeth, got out through the window\nand went away. This is overdrawn, though there is an element of truth in\nit, and I do not try to deny it.",
        "There were other similar strong evidences of feeling throughout the\ncongregation, none of which had ever been noticed before in this place.\nOur clergyman was amazed and horrified. He tried to ignore the action of\nthe brethren, but when a sister who has grown old in our church, and been\nsuch a model and example of rectitude that all the girls in the county\nwere perfectly discouraged about trying to be anywhere near equal to her;\nwhen she rose with a wild snort, got up on the pew with her feet, and\nswung her parasol in a way that indicated that she would not go home till\nmorning, he paused and briefly wound up the services.",
        "Of course there were other little eccentricities on the part of the\ncongregation, but these were the ones that people have talked about the\nmost, and have done us the most damage abroad.",
        "Now, my desire is that through the medium of the press you will state that\nthis great trouble which has come upon us, by reason of which the ungodly\nhave spoken lightly of us, was not the result of a general tendency to\ndissent from the statements made by our pastor, and therefore an\nexhibition of our disapproval of his doctrines, but that the janitor had\nstarted a light fire in the furnace, and that had revived a large nest of\ncommon, streaked, hot-nosed wasps in the warm air pipe, and when they came\nup through the register and united in the services, there was more or less\nof an ovation.",
        "Sometimes Christianity gets sluggish and comatose, but not under the above\ncircumstances. A man may slumber on softly with his bosom gently rising\nand falling, and his breath coming and going through one corner of his\nmouth like the death rattle of a bath-tub, while the pastor opens out a\nnew box of theological thunders and fills the air full of the sullen roar\nof sulphurous waves, licking the shores of eternity and swallowing up the\ngreat multitudes of the eternally lost; but when one little wasp, with a\nred-hot revelation, goes gently up the leg of that same man’s pantaloons,\nleaving large, hot tracks whenever he stopped and sat down to think it\nover, you will see a sudden awakening and a revival that will attract\nattention.",
        "I wish that you would take this letter, Mr. Nye, and write something from\nit in your own way, for publication, showing how we happened to have more\nzeal than usual in the church last Sabbath, and that it was not directly\nthe result of the sermon which was preached on that day.",
        "Yours, with great respect,",
        "William Lemons.",
        "I have not written much for publication lately, because I did not feel\nwell, I was fatigued. I took a ride on the cars last week and it shook me\nup a good deal.",
        "The train was crowded somewhat, and so I sat in a seat with a woman who\ngot aboard at Minkin’s Siding. I noticed as we pulled out of Minkin’s\nSiding, that this woman raised the window so that she could bid adieu to a\nman in a dyed moustache. I do not know whether he was her dolce far\nniente, or her grandson by her second husband. I know that if he had been\na relative of mine, however, I would have cheerfully concealed the fact.",
        "She waved a little 2x6 handkerchief out of the window, said “good-bye,\"\nallowed a fresh zephyr from Cape Sabine to come in and play a xylophone\ninterlude on my spinal column, and then burst into a paroxysm of damp, hot\ntears.",
        "I had to go into another car for a moment, and when I returned a pugilist\nfrom Chicago had my seat. When I travel I am uniformly courteous,\nespecially to pugilists. A pugilist who has started out as an obscure boy\nwith no money, no friends, and no one to practice on, except his wife or\nhis mother, with no capital aside from his bare hands; a man who has had\nto fight his way through life, as it were, and yet who has come out of\nobscurity and attracted the attention of the authorities, and won the good\nwill of those with whom he came in contact, will always find me cordial\nand pacific. So I allowed this self-made man with the broad, high,\nintellectual shoulder blades, to sit in my seat with his feet on my new\nand expensive traveling bag, while I sat with the tear-bedewed memento\nfrom Minkin’s Siding.",
        "She sobbed several more times, then hove a sigh that rattled the windows\nin the car, and sat up. I asked her if I might sit by her side for a few\nmiles and share her great sorrow. She looked at me askance. I did not\nresent it. She allowed me to take the seat, and I looked at a paper for a\nfew moments so that she could look me over through the corners of her\neyes. I also scrutinized her lineaments some.",
        "She was dressed up considerably, and, when a woman dresses up to ride in a\nrailway train, she advertises the fact that her intellect is beginning to\ntotter on its throne. People who have more than one suit of clothes should\nnot pick out the fine raiment for traveling purposes. This person was not\nhandsomely dressed, but she had the kind of clothes that look as though\nthey had tried to present the appearance of affluence and had failed to do\nso.",
        "This leads me to say, in all seriousness, that there is nothing so sad as\nthe sight of a man or woman who would scorn to tell a wrong story, but who\nwill persist in wearing bogus clothes and bogus jewelry that wouldn’t fool\nanybody.",
        "My seat-mate wore a cloak that had started out to bamboozle the American\npeople with the idea that it was worth $100, but it wouldn’t mislead\nanyone who might be nearer than half a mile. I also discovered, that it\nhad an air about it that would indicate that she wore it while she cooked\nthe pancakes and fried the doughnuts. It hardly seems possible that she\nwould do this, but the garment, I say, had that air about it.",
        "She seemed to want to converse after awhile, and she began on the subject\nof literature, picking up a volume that had been left in her seat by the\ntrain boy, entitled: “Shadowed to Skowhegan and Back; or, The Child Fiend;\nprice $2,” we drifted on pleasantly into the broad domain of letters.",
        "Incidentally I asked her what authors she read mostly.",
        "“O, I don’t remember the authors so much as I do the books,” said she; “I\nam a great reader. If I should tell you how much I have read, you wouldn’t\nbelieve it.”",
        "I said I certainly would. I had frequently been called upon to believe\nthings that would make the ordinary rooster quail.",
        "If she discovered the true inwardness of this Anglo-American “Jewdesprit,\"\nshe refrained from saying anything about it.",
        "“I read a good deal,” she continued, “and it keeps me all strung up. I\nweep, O so easily.” Just then she lightly laid her hand on my arm, and I\ncould see that the tears were rising to her eyes. I felt like asking her\nif she had ever tried running herself through a clothes wringer every\nmorning? I did feel that someone ought to chirk her up, so I asked her if\nshe remembered the advice of the editor who received a letter from a young\nlady troubled the same way. She stated that she couldn’t explain it, but\nevery little while, without any apparent cause, she would shed tears, and\nthe editor asked her why she didn’t lock up the shed.",
        "We conversed for a long time about literature, but every little while she\nwould get me into deep water by quoting some author or work that I had\nnever read. I never realized what a hopeless ignoramus I was till I heard\nabout the scores of books that had made her shed the scalding, and yet\nthat I had never, never read. When she looked at me with that far-away\nexpression in her eyes, and with her hand resting lightly on my arm in\nsuch a way as to give the gorgeous two karat Rhinestone from Pittsburg\nfull play, and told me how such works as “The New Made Grave; or The Twin\nMurderers” had cost her many and many a copious tear, I told her I was\nglad of it. If it be a blessed boon for the student of such books to weep\nat home and work up their honest perspiration into scalding tears, far be\nit from me to grudge that poor boon.",
        "I hope that all who may read these lines, and who may feel that the pores\nof their skin are getting torpid and sluggish, owing to an inherited\nantipathy toward physical exertion, and who feel that they would rather\nwork up their perspiration into woe and shed it in the shape of common\nred-eyed weep, will keep themselves to this poor boon. People have\ndifferent ways of enjoying themselves, and I hope no one will hesitate\nabout accepting this or any other poor boon that I do not happen to be\nusing at the time.",
        "I have just been through Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin, on a tour of\ninspection. I rode for over ten days in these States in a sleeping-car,\nexamining crops, so that I could write an intelligent report.",
        "Grain in Northern Wisconsin suffered severely in the latter part of the\nseason from rust, chintz bug, Hessian fly and trichina. In the St. Croix\nvalley wheat will not average a half crop. I do not know why farmers\nshould insist upon leaving their grain out nights in July, when they know\nfrom the experience of former years that it will surely rust.",
        "In Southern Wisconsin too much rain has almost destroyed many crops, and\ncattle have been unable to get enough to eat, unless they were fed, for\nseveral weeks. This is a sad outlook for the farmer at this season.",
        "In the northern part of the State many fields of grain were not worth\ncutting, while others barely yielded the seed, and even that of a very\ninferior quality.",
        "The ruta-baga is looking unusually well this fall, but we cannot subsist\nentirely upon the ruta-baga. It is juicy and rich if eaten in large\nquantities, but it is too bulky to be popular with the aristocracy.",
        "Cabbages in most places are looking well, though in some quarters I notice\nan epidemic of worms. To successfully raise the cabbage, it will be\nnecessary at all times to be well supplied with vermifuge that can be\nreadily administered at any hour of the day or night.",
        "The crook-neck squash in the Northwest is a great success this season. And\nwhat can be more beautiful, as it calmly lies in its bower of green vines\nin the crisp and golden haze of autumn, than the cute little crook-neck\nsquash, with yellow, warty skin, all cuddled up together in the cool\nmorning, like the discarded wife of an old Mormon elder–his first attempt\nin the matrimonial line, so to speak, ere he had gained wisdom by\nexperience.",
        "The full-dress, low-neck-and-short-sleeve summer squash will be worn as\nusual this fall, with trimmings of salt and pepper in front and revers of\nbutter down the back.",
        "N.B.–It will not be used much as an outside wrap, but will be worn mostly\ninside.",
        "Hop-poles in some parts of Wisconsin are entirely killed. I suppose that\ncontinued dry weather in the early summer did it.",
        "Hop-lice, however, are looking well. Many of our best hop-breeders thought\nthat when the hop-pole began to wither and die, the hop-louse could not\nsurvive the intense dry heat; but hop-lice have never looked better in\nthis State than they do this fall.",
        "I can remember very well when Wisconsin had to send to Ohio for hop-lice.\nNow she could almost supply Ohio and still have enough to fill her own\ncoffers.",
        "I do not know that hop-lice are kept in coffers, and I may be wrong in\nspeaking thus freely of these two subjects, never having seen either a\nhop-louse or a coffer, but I feel that the public must certainly and\nnaturally expect me to say something on these subjects. Fruit in the\nNorthwest this season is not a great success. Aside from the cranberry and\nchoke-cherry, the fruit yield in the northern district is light. The early\ndwarf crab, with or without, worms, as desired–but mostly with–is\nunusually poor this fall. They make good cider. This cider when put into a\nbrandy flask that has not been drained too dry, and allowed to stand until\nChristmas, puts a great deal of expression into a country dance. I have\ntried it once myself, so that I could write it up for your valuable paper.",
        "People who were present at that dance, and who saw me frolic around there\nlike a thing of life, say that it was well worth the price of admission.\nStone fence always flies right to the weakest spot. So it goes right to my\nhead and makes me eccentric.",
        "The violin virtuoso who “fiddled,” “called off” and acted as justice of\nthe peace that evening, said that I threw aside all reserve and entered\nwith great zest into the dance, and seemed to enjoy it much better than\nthose who danced in the same set with me. Since that, the very sight of a\ncommon crab apple makes my head reel. I learned afterward that this cider\nhad frozen, so that the alleged cider which we drank that night was the\nclear, old-fashioned brandy, which of course would not freeze.",
        "We should strive, however, to lead such lives that we will never be\nashamed to look a cider barrel square in the bung.",
        "People who write for a livelihood get some queer propositions from those\nwho have crude ideas about the operation of the literary machine. There is\na prevailing idea among those who have never dabbled in literature very\nmuch, that the divine afflatus works a good deal like a corn sheller. This\nis erroneous.",
        "To put a bushel of words into the hopper and have them come out a poem or\na sermon, is a more complicated process than it would seem to the casual\nobserver.",
        "I can hardly be called literary, though I admit that my tastes lie in that\ndirection, and yet I have had some singular experiences in that line. For\ninstance, last year I received flattering overtures from three young men\nwho wanted me to write speeches for them to deliver on the Fourth of July.\nThey could do it themselves, but hadn’t the time. If I would write the\nspeeches they would be willing to revise them. They seemed to think it\nwould be a good idea to write the speeches a little longer than necessary\nand then the poorer parts of the effort could be cut out. Various prices\nwere set on these efforts, from a dollar to “the kindest regards.” People\nwho have squeezed through one of our adult winters in this latitude,\nsubsisting on kind regards, will please communicate with the writer,\nstating how they like it.",

Writing gum drop epitaphs may properly belong to the domain of\nliterature, but I doubt it. Surely I do not want to be haughty and above\nmy business, but it seems to me that this is irrelevant.",
        "Another man wanted me to write a “piece for his boy to speak,” and if I\nwould do so, I could come to his house some Saturday night and stay over\nSunday. He said that the boy was “a perfect little case to carry on and\nfolks didn’t know whether he would develop into a condemb fool or a\nyoumerist.” So he wanted a piece of one of them tomfoolery kind for the\nlittle cuss to speak the last day of school.",
        "A coal dealer who had risen to affluence by selling coal to the poor by\napothecaries’ weight, wrote to ask me for a design to be used as a family\ncrest and a motto to emblazon on his arms. I told him I had run out of\ncrests, but that “weight for the wagon, we’ll all take a ride,” would be a\ngood motto; or he might use the following: “The fuel and his money are\nsoon parted.” He might emblazon this on his arms, or tattoo it on any\nother part of his system where he thought it would be becoming to his\ncomplexion. I never heard from him again, and I do not know whether he was\noffended or not.",
        "Two young men in Massachusetts wrote me a letter in which they said they\n\"had a good thing on mother.” They wanted it written up in a facetious\nvein. They said that their father had been on the coast a few weeks\nbefore, engaged in the eeling industry. Being a good man, but partially\nfull, he had mingled himself in the flowing tide and got drowned. Finally,\nafter several days’ search, the neighbors came in sadly and told the old\nlady thai they had found all that was mortal of James, and there were two\neels in the remains. They asked for further instructions as to deceased.\nThe old lady swabbed out her weeping eyes, braced herself against the sink\nand told the men to “bring in the eels and set him again.”",
        "The boys thought that if this could be properly written up, “it would be a\nmighty good joke on mother.” I was greatly shocked when I received this\nletter. It seemed to me heartless for young men to speak lightly of their\nwidowed mother’s great woe. I wrote them how I felt about it, and rebuked\nthem severely for treating their mother’s grief so lightly. Also for\ntrying to impose upon me with an old chestnut.",
        "My dear Henry.–Your pensive favor of the 20th inst., asking for more\nmeans with which to persecute your studies, and also a young man from\nOhio, is at hand and carefully noted.",
        "I would not be ashamed to have you show the foregoing sentence to your\nteacher, if it could be worked, in a quiet way, so as not to look\negotistic on my part. I think myself that it is pretty fair for a man that\nnever had any advantages.",
        "But, Henry, why will you insist on fighting the young man from Ohio? It is\nnot only rude and wrong, but you invariably get licked. There’s where the\nenormity of the thing comes in.",
        "It was this young man from Ohio, named Williams, that you hazed last year,\nor at least that’s what I gether from a letter sent me by your warden. He\nmaintains that you started in to mix Mr. Williams up with the campus in\nsome way, and that in some way Mr. Williams resented it and got his fangs\ntangled up in the bridge of your nose.",

Do you remember how\nyour mother went down there to nuss you for two weeks and I stayed to\nhome, and done my own work and the housework too and cooked my own vittles\nfor the whole two weeks?",
        "And now, Henry, you call yourself a seanyour, and therefore, because you\nare simply older in crime, you want to muss up Mr. Williams’s features so\nthat his mother will have to come over and nuss him. I am glad that your\nlittle pleated coat is ripped up the back, Henry, under the circumstances,\nand I am also glad that you are wearing the belt–over your off eye.

        "Over at Kasota Junction, the other day, I found a living curiosity. He was\na man of about medium height, perhaps 45 years of age, of a quiet\ndisposition, and not noticeable or peculiar in his general manner. He runs\nthe railroad eating-house at that point, and the one odd characteristic\nwhich he has, makes him well known all through three or four States. I\ncould not illustrate his eccentricity any better than by relating a\ncircumstance that occurred to me at the Junction last week. I had just\neaten breakfast there and paid for it. I stepped up to the cigar case and\nasked this man if he had “a rattling good cigar.”",
        "Without knowing it I had struck the very point upon which this man seems\nto be a crank, if you will allow me that expression, though it doesn’t fit\nvery well in this place. He looked at me in a sad and subdued manner and\nsaid, “No, sir; I haven’t a rattling good cigar in the house. I have some\ncigars there that I bought for Havana fillers, but they are mostly filled\nwith pieces of Colorado Maduro overalls. There’s a box over yonder that I\nbought for good, straight ten cent cigars, but they are only a chaos of\nhay and Flora, Fino and Damfino, all socked into a Wisconsin wrapper. Over\nin the other end of the case is a brand of cigars that were to knock the\ntar out of all other kinds of weeds, according to the urbane rustler who\nsold them to me, and then drew on me before I could light one of them.\nWell, instead of being a fine Colorado Claro with a high-priced wrapper,\nthey are common Mexicano stinkaros in a Mother Hubbard wrapper. The\ncommercial tourist who sold me those cigars and then drew on me at sight\nwas a good deal better on the draw than his cigars are. If you will\nnotice, you will see that each cigar has a spinal column to it, and this\nouter debris is wrapped around it. One man bought a cigar out of that box\nlast week. I told him, though, just as I am telling you, that they were no\ngood, and if he bought one he would regret it. But he took one and went\nout on the veranda to smoke it. Then he stepped on a melon rind and fell\nwith great force on his side. When we picked him up he gasped once or\ntwice and expired. We opened his vest hurriedly and found that, in\nfalling, this bouquet de Gluefactoro cigar, with the spinal column, had\nbeen driven through his breast bone and had penetrated his heart. The\nwrapper of the cigar never so much as cracked.”",
        "“But doesn’t it impair your trade to run on in this wild, reckless way\nabout your cigars?”",
        "“It may at first, but not after awhile. I always tell people what my\ncigars are made of, and then they can’t blame me; so, after awhile they\nget to believe what I say about them. I often wonder that no cigar man\never tried this way before. I do just the same way about my lunch counter.\nIf a man steps up and wants a fresh ham sandwich I give it to him if I’ve\ngot it, and if I haven’t it I tell him so. If you turn my sandwiches over,\nyou will find the date of its publication on every one. If they are not\nfresh, and I have no fresh ones, I tell the customer that they are not so\nblamed fresh as the young man with the gauze moustache, but that I can\nremember very well when they were fresh, and if his artificial teeth fit\nhim pretty well he can try one.",

        "My attention was first attracted to insomnia as the foe of the domestic\nanimal, by the strange appearance of a favorite dog named Lucretia Borgia.\nI did not name this animal Lucretia Borgia. He was named when I purchased\nhim. In his eccentric and abnormal thirst for blood he favored Lucretia,\nbut in sex he did not. I got him partly because he loved children. The\nowner said Lucretia Borgia was an ardent lover of children, and I found\nthat he was. He seemed to love them best in the spring of the year, when\nthey were tender. He would have eaten up a favorite child of mine, if the\nyoungster hadn’t left a rubber ball in his pocket which clogged the\nglottis of Lucretia till I could get there and disengage what was left of\nthe child.",
        "Lucretia soon after this began to be restless. He would come to my\ncasement and lift up his voice, and howl into the bosom of the silent\nnight. At first I thought that he had found some one in distress, or\nwanted to get me out of doors and save my life. I went out several nights\nin a weird costume that I had made up of garments belonging to different\nmembers of my family. I dressed carefully in the dark and stole out to\nkill the assassin referred to by Lucretia, but he was not there. Then the\nfaithful animal would run up to me and with almost human, pleading eyes,\nbark and run away toward a distant alley. I immediately decided that some\none was suffering there. I had read in books about dogs that led their\nmasters away to the suffering and saved people’s lives; so, when Lucretia\ncame to me with his great, honest eyes and took little mementoes out of\nthe calf of my leg, and then galloped off seven or eight blocks, I\nfollowed him in the chill air of night and my Mosaic clothes. I wandered\naway to where the dog stopped behind a livery stable, and there, lying in\na shuddering heap on the frosty ground, lay the still, white features of a\nsoup bone that had outlived its usefulness.",
        "On the way back, I met a physician who had been up town to swear in an\nAmerican citizen who would vote twenty-one years later, if he lived. The\nphysician stopped me and was going to take me to the home of the\nfriendless, when he discovered who I was.",
        "You wrap a tall man, with a William H. Seward nose, in a flannel robe, cut\nplain, and then put a plug hat and a sealskin sacque and Arctic overshoes\non him, and put him out in the street, under the gaslight, with his trim,\npurple ankles just revealing themselves as he madly gallops after a\nhydrophobia infested dog, and it is not, after all, surprising that\npeople’s curiosity should be a little bit excited.",
        "After I had introduced myself to the physician and asked him for a cigar,\nexplaining that I could not find any in the clothes I had on, I asked him\nabout Lucretia Borgia. I told the doctor how Lucretia seemed restless\nnights and nervous and irritable days, and how he seemed to be almost a\nmental wreck, and asked him what the trouble was.",
        "He said it was undoubtedly “insomnia.” He said that it was a bad case of\nit, too. I told him I thought so myself. I said I didn’t mind the insomnia\nthat Lucretia had so much as I did my own. I was getting more insomnia on\nmy hands than I could use.",
        "He gave me something to administer to Lucretia. He said I must put it in a\nlink of sausage and leave the sausage where it would appear that I didn’t\nwant the dog to get it, and then Lucretia would eat it greedily.",
        "I did so. It worked well so far as the administration of the remedy was\nconcerned, but it was fatal to my little, high strung, yearnful dog. It\nmust have contained something of a deleterious character, for the next\nmorning a coarse man took Lucretia Borgia by the tail and laid him where\nthe violets blow. Malignant insomnia is fast becoming the great foe to the\nmodern American dog.",
        "I have just returned from a brief visit to Duluth. After strolling along\nthe Bay of Naples and watching old Vesuvius vomit red-hot mud, vapor and\nother campaign documents, Duluth is quite a change. The ice in the bay at\nDuluth was thirty-eight inches in depth when I left there the last week in\nMarch, and we rode across it with the utmost impunity. By the time these\nlines fall beneath the eye of the genial, courteous and urbane reader, the\nnew railroad bridge across the bay, over a mile and a half long, will have\nbeen completed, so that you may ride from Chicago to Duluth over the\nNorthwestern and Omaha railroads with great comfort. I would be glad to\ndigress here and tell about the beauty of the summer scenery along the\nOmaha road, and the shy and beautiful troutlet, and the dark and silent\nChippewa squawlet and her little bleached out pappooselet, were it not for\nthe unkind and cruel thrusts that I would invoke from the scenery cynic\nwho believes that a newspaper man’s opinions may be largely warped with a\npass.",
        "Duluth has been joked a good deal, but she stands it first-rate and takes\nit good naturedly. She claims 16,000 people, some of whom I met at the\nopera house there. If the rest of the 16,000 are as pleasant as those I\nconversed with that evening, Duluth must be a pleasant place to live in.\nDuluth has a very pleasant and beautiful opera house that seats 1,000\npeople. A few more could have elbowed their way into the opera house the\nevening that I spoke there, but they preferred to suffer on at home.",
        "Lake Superior is one of the largest aggregations of fresh wetness in the\nworld, if not the largest. When I stop to think that some day all this\ncold, cold water will have to be absorbed by mankind, it gives me a cramp\nin the geographical center.",
        "Around the west end of Lake Superior there is a string of towns which\nstretches along the shore for miles under one name or another, all waiting\nfor the boom to strike and make the northern Chicago. You cannot visit\nDuluth or Superior without feeling that at any moment the tide of trade\nwill rise and designate the point where the future metropolis of the\nnorthern lakes is to be. I firmly believe that this summer will decide it,\nand my guess is that what is now known as West Superior is to get the\nbenefit. For many years destiny has been hovering over the west end of\nthis mighty lake, and now the favored point is going to be designated.\nDuluth has past prosperity and expensive improvements in her favor, and in\nfact the whole locality is going to be benefited, but if I had a block in\nWest Superior with a roller rink on it, I would wear my best clothes every\nday and claim to be a millionaire in disguise. Ex-President R. B. Hayes\nhas a large brick block in Duluth, but he does not occupy it. Those who go\nto Duluth hoping to meet Mr. Hayes will be bitterly disappointed.",
        "The streams that run into Lake Superior are alive with trout, and next\nsummer I propose to go up there and roast until I have so thoroughly\nsaturated my system with trout that the trout bones will stick out through\nmy clothes in every direction and people will regard me as a beautiful\ntoothpick holder.",
        "Still there will be a few left for those who think of going up there. All\nI will need will be barely enough to feed Albert Victor and myself from\nday to day. People who have never seen a crowned head with a peeled nose\non it are cordially invited to come over and see us during office hours.\nAlbert is not at all haughty, and I intend to throw aside my usual reserve\nthis summer also–for the time. P. Wales’ son and I will be far from the\ncares that crowd so thick and fast on greatness. People who come to our\ncedar bark wigwam to show us their mosquito bites, will be received as\ncordially as though no great social chasm yawned between us.",

There was a man in our car who weighed 300\npounds. He seemed to be boiling out through his clothes everywhere. He was\nthe happiest looking man I ever saw.

He knew a clergyman named Brayley who went up into that region with\nBright’s justly celebrated disease. He was so emaciated that he couldn’t\ncarry a watch. The ticking of the watch rattled his bones so that it made\nhim nervous, and at night they had to pack him in cotton so that he\nwouldn’t break a leg when he turned over.

        "I engaged to learn my profession of a man called Sam Newton, I believe; at\nleast I will call him that for the sake of argument. My business was to\nweigh wheat, deduct as much as possible on account of cockle, pigeon grass\nand wild buckwheat, and to chisel the honest farmer out of all he would\nstand. This was the programme with Mr. Newton; but I am happy to say that\nit met with its reward, and the sheriff afterward operated the mill.",
        "On stormy days I did the book-keeping, with a scoop shovel behind my ear,\nin a pile of middlings on the fifth floor. Gradually I drifted into doing\na good deal of this kind of brain work. I would chop the ice out of the\nturbine wheel at 5 o’clock A.M., and then frolic up six flights of stairs\nand shovel shorts till 9 o’clock P.M.",
        "By shoveling bran and other vegetables 16 hours a day, a general knowledge\nof the milling business may be readily obtained. I used to scoop middlings\ntill I could see stars, and then I would look out at the landscape and\nponder.",

        "One day the proprietor came up stairs and discovered me in a brown study,\nwhereupon he cursed me in a subdued Presbyterian way, abbreviated my\nsalary from $26 per month to $18 and reduced me to the ranks.",
        "Afterward I got together enough desultory information so that I could\nsuperintend the feed stone. The feed stone is used to grind hen feed and\nother luxuries. One day I noticed an odor that reminded me of a hot\novershoe trying to smother a glue factory at the close of a tropical day.\nI spoke to the chief floor walker of the mill about it, and he said “dod\ngammit” or something that sounded like that, in a course and brutal\nmanner. He then kicked my person in a rude and hurried tone of voice, and\ntold me that the feed stone was burning up.",
        "He was a very fierce man, with a violent and ungovernable temper, and,\nfinding that I was only increasing his brutal fury, I afterward resigned\nmy position. I talked it over with the proprietor, and both agreed that it\nwould be best. He agreed to it before I did, and rather hurried up my\ndetermination to go.",
        "I rather hated to go so soon, but he made it an object for me to go, and I\nwent. I started in with the idea that I would begin at the bottom of the\nladder, as it were, and gradually climb to the bran bin by my own\nexertions, hoping by honesty, industry, and carrying two bushels of wheat\nup nine flights of stairs, to become a wealthy man, with corn meal in my\nhair and cracked wheat in my coat pocket, but I did not seem to accomplish\nit.",
        "Instead of having ink on my fingers and a chastened look of woe on my\nclear-cut Grecian features, I might have poured No. 1 hard wheat and\nbuckwheat flour out of my long taper ears every night, if I had stuck to\nthe profession. Still, as I say, it was for another man’s best good that I\nresigned. The head miller had no control over himself and the proprietor\nhad rather set his heart on my resignation, so it was better that way.",
        "Still I like to roll around in the bran pile, and monkey in the cracked\nwheat. I love also to go out in the kitchen and put corn meal down the\nback of the cook’s neck while my wife is working a purple silk Kensington\ndog, with navy blue mane and tail, on a gothic lambrequin.",
        "I can never cease to hanker for the rumble and grumble of the busy mill,\nand the solemn murmur of the millstones and the machinery are music to me.\nMore so than the solemn murmur of the proprietor used to be when he came\nin at an inopportune moment, and in that impromptu and extemporaneous\nmanner of his, and found me admiring the wild and beautiful scenery. He\nmay have been a good miller, but he had no love for the beautiful. Perhaps\nthat is why he was always so cold and cruel toward me. My slender, willowy\ngrace and mellow, bird-like voice never seemed to melt his stony heart.",

The name lacks poetic warmth, but some day the man\nwho has invested in Seattle real estate will have reason to pat himself on\nthe back and say “ha ha,” or words to that effect.

He who has tossed for days upon the\nbriny deep, will understand this and appreciate it; even if he never\ntossed upon the angry deep, if it happened to be all he had, he will be\nglad to know that the Sound is a good piece of water to ride on. The\ngentle reader who has crossed the raging main and borrowed high-priced\nmeals of the steamship company for days and days, will agree with me that\nwhen we can find a smooth piece of water to ride on we should lose no time\nin crossing it.",

        "Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be with you on this day of\nyour general jubilee and to talk over old times with you.",
        "One who has never experienced the thrill of genuine joy that wakens a man\nto a glad realization of the fact that he is a forefather, cannot\nunderstand its full significance. You alone know how it is yourself, you\ncan speak from experience.",
        "In fancy’s dim corridors I see you stand, away back in the early dawn of\nour national day, with the tallow candle drooping and dying in its socket,\nas you waited for the physician to come and announce to you that you were\na forefather.",
        "Forefathers; you have done well. Others have sought to outdo you and wrest\nthe laurels from your brow, but they did not succeed. As forefathers you\nhave never been successfully scooped.",
        "I hope that you will keep up your justly celebrated organization. If a\nforefather allows his dues to get in arrears, go to him kindly and ask him\nlike a brother to put up. If he refuses to do so, fire him. There is no\nreason why a man should presume upon his long standing as a forefather to\nbecome insolent to other forefathers who are far his seniors. As a rule, I\nnotice it is the young amateur forefather who has only been so a few days,\nin fact, who is arrogant and disobedient.",
        "I have often wished that we could observe Forefathers’ day more generally\nin the West. Why we should allow the Eastern cities to outdo us in this\nmatter while we hold over them in other ways, I cannot understand. Our\nchurch sociables and homicides in the West will compare favorably with\nthose of the effeter cities of the Atlantic slope. Our educational\ninstitutions and embezzlers are making rapid strides, especially our\nembezzlers. We are cultivating a certain air of refinement and haughty\nreserve which enables us at times to fool the best judges. Many of our\nWestern people have been to the Atlantic seaboard and remained all summer\nwithout falling into the hands of the bunko artist. A cow gentleman friend\nof mine who bathed his plump limbs in the Atlantic last summer during the\nday, and mixed himself up in the mazy dance at night, told me on his\nreturn that he had enjoyed the summer immensely, but that he had returned\nfinancially depressed.",
        "“Ah,” said I, with an air of superiority which I often assume while\ntalking to men who know more than I do, “you fell into the hands of the\ncultivated confidence man?”",
        "“No, William,” he said sadly, “worse than that. I stopped at a seaside\nhotel. Had I gone to New York City and hunted up the gentlemanly bunko man\nand the Wall street dealer in lamb’s pelts, as my better judgment\nprompted, I might have returned with funds. Now I am almost insolvent. I\nbegin life again with great sorrow, and the same old Texas steer with\nwhich I went into the cattle industry five years ago.”",
        "But why should we, here in the West, take readily to all other\ninstitutions common to the cultured East and ignore the forefather\nindustry? I now make this public announcement, and will stick to it, viz:\nI will be one of ten full-blooded American citizens to establish a branch\nforefather’s lodge in the West, with a separate fund set aside for the\nbenefit of forefathers who are no longer young. Forefathers are just as\napt to become old and helpless as anyone else. Young men who contemplate\nbecoming forefathers should remember this.",

It is not the intrinsic value of the fifteen\ncents that I care for so much, but I would like it as a curiosity.",
        "The book is wonderfully graphic and thorough in all its details, and I was\nespecially pleased with its careful and useful recipe for ointments. One\nstyle of ointment spoken of and recommended by your valuable book, is\nworthy of a place in history. I made some of it according to your formula.\nI tried it on a friend of mine.

Do you not think that\npossibly you have made a mistake and got your ointment and cement formula\nmixed? Your cement certainly smells like a corrupt administration in a\nwarm room.",
        "Your revelations in the liquor manufacture, and how to make any mixed\ndrink with one hand tied, is well worth the price of the book. The chapter\non bar etiquette is also excellent. Very few men know how to properly\nenter a bar-room and what to do after they arrive. How to get into a\nbar-room without attracting attention, and how to get out without police\ninterference, are points upon which our American drunkards are lamentably\nignorant. How to properly address a bar tender, is also a page that no\nstudent of good breeding could well omit.",

Now, with your valuable and scholarly\nwork, price twenty-five cents, he studies over the closing chapter an hour\nor two, then goes out into society and gathers in his victim. And yet I do\nnot grudge the long, long hours I squandered in those years when people\nwere in heathenish darkness. I had no book like yours to tell me how to\nwin the affections of the opposite sex.

        "Boys should never be afraid or ashamed to do little odd jobs by which to\nacquire money. Too many boys are afraid, or at least seem to be\nembarrassed when asked to do chores, and thus earn small sums of money. In\norder to appreciate wealth we must earn it ourselves. That is the reason I\nlabor. I do not need to labor. My parents are still living, and they\ncertainly would not see me suffer for the necessities of life. But life in\nthat way would not have the keen relish that it would if I earned the\nmoney myself.",
        "Sawing wood used to be a favorite pastime with boys twenty years ago. I\nremember the first money I ever earned was by sawing wood. My brother and\nmyself were to receive $5 for sawing five cords of wood. We allowed the\njob to stand, however, until the weather got quite warm, and then we\ndecided to hire a foreigner who came along that way one glorious summer\nday when all nature seemed tickled and we knew that the fish would be apt\nto bite. So we hired the foreigner, and while he sawed, we would bet with\nhim on various “dead sure things” until he got the wood sawed, when he\nwent away owing us fifty cents.",
        "We had a neighbor who was very wealthy. He noticed that we boys earned our\nown spending money, and he yearned to have his son try to ditto. So he\ntold the boy that he was going away for a few weeks and that he would give\nhim $2 per cord, or double price, to saw the wood. He wanted to teach the\nboy to earn and appreciate his money. So, when the old man went away, the\nboy secured a colored man to do the job at $1 per cord, by which process\nthe youth made $10. This he judiciously invested in clothes, meeting his\nfather at the train in a new summer suit and a speckled cane. The old man\nsaid he could see by the sparkle in the boy’s clear, honest eyes, that\nhealthful exercise was what boys needed.",
        "When I was a boy I frequently acquired large sums of money by carrying\ncoal up two flights of stairs for wealthy people who were too fat to do it\nthemselves. This money I invested from time to time in side shows and\nother zoological attractions.",

I waited till I nearly froze to death, for the owner to come\nalong and solicit my aid. Finally he came. He smelled strong of carbolic\nacid, and I afterward learned that he was a physician and surgeon.",
        "We haggled over the price for some time, as I had to carry the coal up two\nflights in an old waste paper basket and it was quite a task. Finally we\nagreed. I proceeded with the work. About dusk I went up the last flight of\nstairs with the last load. My feet seemed to weigh about nineteen pounds\napiece and my face was very sombre.",
        "In the gloaming I saw my employer. He was writing a prescription by the\ndim, uncertain light. He told me to put the last basketful in the little\ncloset off the hall and then come and get my pay. I took the coal into the\ncloset, but I do not know what I did with it. As I opened the door and\nstepped in, a tall skeleton got down off the nail and embraced me like a\nprodigal son. It fell on my neck and draped itself all over me. Its\nglittering phalanges entered the bosom of my gingham shirt and rested\nlightly on the pit of my stomach. I could feel the pelvis bone in the\nsmall of my back. The room was dark, but I did not light the gas. Whether\nit was the skeleton of a lady or gentleman, I never knew; but I thought,\nfor the sake of my good name, I would not remain. My good name and a\nstrong yearning for home were all that I had at that time.",
        "So I went home. Afterwards, I learned that this physician got all his coal\ncarried up stairs for nothing in this way, and he had tried to get rooms\ntwo flights further up in the building, so that the boys would have\nfurther to fall when they made their egress.",
        "Hudson, Wis., August 25, 1885.",
        "Hon. William F. Vilas, Postmaster-General, Washington, D.C.",
        "Dear Sir,–For some time I have been thinking of writing to you and asking\nyou how you were getting along with your department since I left it. I did\nnot wish to write you for the purpose of currying favor with an\nadministration against which I squandered a ballot last fall. Neither do I\ndesire to convey the impression that I would like to open a correspondence\nwith you for the purpose of killing time. If you ever feel like sitting\ndown and answering this letter in an off-hand way it would please me very\nmuch, but do not put yourself out to do so. I wanted to ask you, however,\nhow you like the pictures of yourself recently published by the patent\ninsides. That was my principal object in writing. Having seen you before\nthis great calamity befell you, I wanted to inquire whether you had really\nchanged so much. As I remember your face, it was rather unusually\nintellectual and attractive for a great man. Great men are very rarely\npretty. I guess that, aside from yourself, myself, and Mr. Evarts, there\nis hardly an eminent man in the country who would be considered handsome.\nBut the engraver has done you a great injustice, or else you have sadly\nchanged since I saw you. It hardly seems possible that your nose has\ndrifted around to leeward and swelled up at the end, as the engraver would\nhave us believe. I do not believe that in a few short months the look of\nfirmness and conscious rectitude that I noticed could have changed to that\nof indecision and vacuity which we see in some of your late portraits as\nprinted.",
        "I saw one yesterday, with your name attached to it, and it made my heart\nache for your family. As a resident in your State I felt humiliated. Two\nof Wisconsin’s ablest men have been thus slaughtered by the rude broad-axe\nof the engraver. Last fall, Senator Spooner, who is also a man with a\nfirst-class head and face, was libeled in this same reckless way. It makes\nme mad, and in that way impairs my usefulness. I am not a good citizen,\nhusband or father when I am mad. I am a perfect simoom of wrath at such\ntimes, and I am not responsible for what I do.",
        "Nothing can arouse the indignation of your friends, regardless of party,\nso much as the thought that while you are working so hard in the\npostoffice at Washington with your coat off, collecting box rent and\nmaking up the Western mail, the remorseless engraver and electrotyper are\nseeking to down you by making pictures of you in which you appear either\nas a dude or a tough.",
        "While I have not the pleasure of being a member of your party, having\nbelonged to what has been sneeringly alluded to as the g.o.p., I cannot\nrefrain from expressing my sympathy at this time. Though we may have\ndiffered heretofore upon important questions of political economy, I\ncannot exult over these portraits. Others may gloat over these efforts to\ninjure you, but I do not. I am not much of a gloater, anyhow.",
        "I leave those to gloat who are in the gloat business.",
        "Still, it is one of the drawbacks incident to greatness. We struggle hard\nthrough life that we may win the confidence of our fellow-men, only at\nlast to have pictures of ourselves printed and distributed where they will\ninjure us.",
        "I desire to add before closing this letter, Mr. Vilas, that with those who\nare acquainted with you and know your sterling worth, these portraits will\nmake no difference. We will not allow them to influence us socially or\npolitically. What the effect may be upon offensive partisans who are total\nstrangers to you, I do not know.",
        "My theory in relation to these cuts is, that they are combined and\ninterchangeable, so that, with slight modifications, they are used for all\ngreat men. The cut, with the extras that go with it, consists of one head\nwith hair (front view), one bald head (front view), one head with hair\n(side view), one bald head (side view), one pair eyes (with glasses), one\npair eyes (plain), one Roman nose, one Grecian nose, one turn-up nose, one\nset whiskers (full), one moustache, one pair side-whiskers, one chin, one\nset large ears, one set medium ears, one set small ears, one set\nshoulders, with collar and necktie for above, one monkey-wrench, one set\nquoins, one galley, one oil can, one screwdriver. These different features\nare then arranged so that a great variety of clergymen, murderers,\nsenators, embezzlers, artists, dynamiters, humorists, arsonists,\nlarcenists, poets, statesmen, base ball players, rinkists, pianists,\ncapitalists, bigamists and sluggists are easily represented. No newspaper\noffice should be without them. They are very simple, and any child can\neasily learn to operate it. They are invaluable in all cases, for no one\nknows at what moment a revolting crime may be committed by a comparatively\nunknown man, whose portrait you wish to give, and in this age of rapid\npolitical transformations, presentations and combinations, no enterprising\npaper should delay the acquisition of a combined portrait for the use of\nits readers.",
        "Hoping that you are well, and that you will at once proceed to let no\nguilty man escape, I remain, yours truly,",
        "Bill Nye.",
        "The Old South Meeting House, in Boston, is the most remarkable structure\nin many respects to be found in that remarkable city. Always eager\nwherever I go to search out at once the gospel privileges, it is not to be\nwondered at, that I should have gone to the Old South the first day after\nI landed in Boston.",
        "It is hardly necessary to go over the history of the Old South, except,\nperhaps, to refresh the memory of those who live outside of Boston. The\nOld South Society was organized in 1669, and the ground on which the old\nmeetinghouse now stands was given by Mrs. Norton, the widow of Rev. John\nNorton, since deceased. The first structure was of wood, and in 1729 the\npresent brick building succeeded it. King’s Handbook of Boston says: “It\nis one of the few historic buildings that have been allowed to remain in\nthis iconoclastic age.”",
        "So it seems that they are troubled with iconoclasts in Boston, too. I\nthought I saw one hanging around the Old South on the day I was there, and\nhad a good notion to point him out to the authorities, but thought it was\nnone of my business.",
        "I went into the building and registered, and then from force of habit or\nabsent-mindedness handed my umbrella over the counter and asked how soon\nsupper would be ready. Everybody registers, but very few, I am told, ask\nhow soon supper will be ready. The Old South is now run on the European\nplan, however.",
        "The old meeting-house is chiefly remarkable for the associations that\ncluster around it. Two centuries hover about the ancient weather-vane and\nlook down upon the visitor when the weather is favorable.",
        "Benjamin Franklin was baptized and attended worship here, prior to his\nwonderful invention of lightning. Here on each succeeding Sabbath sat the\nman who afterwards snared the forked lightning with a string and put it\nin a jug for future generations. Here Whitefield preached and the rebels\ndiscussed the tyranny of the British king. Warren delivered his famous\nspeech here upon the anniversary of the Boston massacre and the “tea\nparty” organized in this same building. Two hundred years ago exactly,\nthe British used the Old South as a military riding school, although a\nmajority of the people of Boston were not in favor of it.",
        "It would be well to pause here and consider the trying situation in which\nour ancestors were placed at that time. Coming to Massachusetts as they\ndid, at a time when the country was new and prices extremely high, they\nhad hoped to escape from oppression and establish themselves so far away\nfrom the tyrant that he could not come over here and disturb them without\nsuffering from the extreme nausea incident to a long sea voyage. Alas,\nhowever, when they landed at Plymouth rock there was not a decent hotel in\nthe place. The same stern and rock-bound coast which may be discovered\nalong the Atlantic sea-board to-day was there, and a cruel, relentless sky\nfrowned upon their endeavors.",
        "Where prosperous cities now flaunt to the sky their proud domes and\nfloating debts, the rank jimson weed nodded in the wind and the pumpkin\npie of to-day still slumbered in the bosom of the future. What glorious\nfacts have, under the benign influence of fostering centuries, been born\nof apparent impossibility. What giant certainties have grown through these\nyears from the seeds of doubt and discouragement and uncertainty! (Big\nfirecrackers and applause.)",
        "At that time our ancestors had but timidly embarked in the forefather\nbusiness. They did not know that future generations in four-button\ncutaways would rise up and call them blessed and pass resolutions of\nrespect on their untimely death. If they stayed at home the king taxed\nthem all out of shape, and if they went out of Boston a few rods to get\nenough huckleberries for breakfast, they would frequently come home so\nfull of Indian arrows that they could not get through a common door\nwithout great pain.",
        "Such was the early history of the country where now cultivation and\neducation and refinement run rampant and people sit up all night to print\nnewspapers so that we can have them in the morning.",
        "The land on which the Old South stands is very valuable for business\npurposes, and $400,000 will have to be raised in order to preserve the old\nlandmark to future generations. I earnestly hope that it will be secured,\nand that the old meeting-house–dear not alone to the people of Boston,\nbut to the millions of Americans scattered from sea to sea, who cannot\nforget where first universal freedom plumed its wings–will be spared to\nentertain within its hospitable walls, enthusiastic and reverential\nvisitors for ages without end.",
        "When you come to think of it, it is surprising that so many newspaper men\nwrite so that any one but an expert can read it. The rapid and voluminous\nwork, especially of daily journalism, knocks the beautiful business\ncollege penman, as a rule, higher than a kite. I still have specimens of\nmy own handwriting that a total stranger could read.",
        "I do not remember a newspaper acquaintance whose penmanship is so\ncharacteristic of the exacting neatness and sharp, clear cut style of the\nman, as is that of Eugene Field, of the Chicago News. As the “Nonpareil\nWriter” of the Denver Tribune, it was a mystery to me when he did the\nwork which the paper showed each day as his own. You would sometimes find\nhim at his desk, writing on large sheets of “print paper” with a pen and\nviolet ink, in a hand that was as delicate as the steel plate of a bank\nnote and the kind of work that printers would skirmish for. He would ask\nyou to sit down in the chair opposite his desk, which had two or three old\nexchanges thrown on it. He would probably say, “Never mind those papers.\nI’ve read them. Just sit down on them if you want to.” Encouraged by his\nhearty manner, you would sit down, and you would continue to sit down till\nyou had protruded about three-fourths of your system through that hollow\nmockery of a chair. Then he would run to help you out and curse the chair,\nand feel pained because he had erroneously given you the ruin with no seat\nto it. He always felt pained over such things. He always suffered keenly\nand felt shocked over the accident until you had gone away, and then he\nwould sigh heavily and “set” the chair again.",
        "Frank Pixley, the editor of the San Francisco Argonaut, is not\nbeautiful, though the Argonaut is. He is grim and rather on the Moses\nMontefiore style of countenance, but his hand-writing does not convey the\nidea of the man personally, or his style of dealing with the Chinese\nquestion. It is rather young looking, and has the uncertain manner of an\neighteen-year-old boy.",
        "Robert J. Burdette writes a small but plain hand, though he sometimes\nsuffers from the savage typographical error that steals forth at such a\nmoment as ye think not, and disfigures and tears and mangles the bright\neyed children of the brain.",
        "Very often we read a man’s work and imagine we shall find him like it,\ncheery, bright and entertaining; but we know him and find that personally\nhe is a refrigerator, or an egotist, or a man with a torpid liver and a\nnose like a rose geranium. You will not be disappointed in Bob Burdette,\nhowever, You think you will like him, and you always do. He will never be\ntoo famous to be a gentleman.",
        "George W. Peck’s hand is of the free and independent order of chirography.\nIt is easy and natural, but not handsome. He writes very voluminously,\ndoing his editorial writing in two days of the week, generally Friday and\nSaturday. Then he takes a rapid horse, a zealous bird dog and an improved\ndouble barrel duck destroyer and communes with nature.",
        "Sam Davis, an old time Californian, and now in Nevada, writes the freest\nof any penman I know. When he is deliberate, he may be betrayed into\nmaking a deformed letter and a crooked mark attached to it, which he\ncharacterizes as a word. He puts a lot of these together and actually pays\npostage on the collection under the delusion that it is a letter, that it\nwill reach its destination, and that it will accomplish its object.",
        "He makes up for his bad writing, however, by being an unpublished volume\nof old time anecdotes and funny experiences.",
        "Goodwin, of the old Territorial Enterprise, and Mark Twain’s old\nemployer, writes with a pencil in a methodical manner and very plainly.\nThe way he sharpens a “hard medium” lead pencil and skins the apostle of\nthe so-called Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, makes my heart\nglad. Hardly a day passes that his life is not threatened by the low\nbrowed thumpers of Mormondom, and yet the old war horse raises the\nstandard of monogamy and under the motto, “One country, one flag and one\nwife at a time,” he smokes his old meerschaum pipe and writes a column of\nrazor blades every day. He is the buzz saw upon which polygamy has tried\nto sit. Fighting these rotten institutions hand to hand and fighting a\nreligious eccentricity through an annual message, or a feeble act of\ncongress, are two separate and distinct things.",
        "If I had a little more confidence in my longevity than I now have, I would\ngo down there to the Valley of the Jordan, and I would gird up my loins,\nand I would write with that lonely warrior at Salt Lake, and with the aid\nand encouragement of our brethren of the press who do not favor the right\nof one man to marry an old woman’s home, we would rotten egg the bogus\nTemple of Zion till the civilized world, with a patent clothes pin on its\nnose, would come and see what was the matter.",

        "When I was young and used to roam around over the country, gathering\nwater-melons in the light of the moon, I used to think I could milk\nanybody’s cow, but I do not think so now. I do not milk a cow now unless\nthe sign is right, and it hasn’t been right for a good many years. The\nlast cow I tried to milk was a common cow, born in obscurity; kind of a\nself-made cow. I remember her brow was low, but she wore her tail high and\nshe was haughty, oh, so haughty.",
        "I made a common-place remark to her, one that is used in the very best of\nsociety, one that need not have given offence anywhere. I said “So\"–and\nshe “soed.” Then I told her to “hist” and she histed. But I thought she\noverdid it. She put too much expression in it.",
        "Just then I heard something crash through the window of the barn and fall\nwith a dull, sickening thud on the outside. The neighbors came to see what\nit was that caused the noise. They found that I had done it in getting\nthrough the window.",
        "I asked the neighbors if the barn was still standing. They said it was.\nThen I asked if the cow was injured much. They said she seemed to be quite\nrobust. Then I requested them to go in and calm the cow a little, and see\nif they could get my plug hat off her horns.",
        "I am buying all my milk now of a milkman. I select a gentle milkman who\nwill not kick, and feel as though I could trust him. Then, if he feels as\nthough he could trust me, it is all right.",
        "So many people have shown a pardonable curiosity about the above named\ndisease, and so few have a very clear idea of the thrill of pleasure it\naffords the patient, unless they have enjoyed it themselves, that I have\ndecided to briefly say something in answer to the innumerable inquiries I\nhave received.",
        "Up to the moment I had a notion of getting some meningitis, I had never\nemployed a physician. Since then I have been thrown in their society a\ngreat deal. Most of them were very pleasant and scholarly gentlemen, who\nwill not soon be forgotten; but one of them doctored me first for\npneumonia, then for inflammatory rheumatism, and finally, when death was\ncontiguous, advised me that I must have change of scene and rest.",
        "I told him that if he kept on prescribing for me, I thought I might depend\non both. Change of physicians, however, saved my life. This horse doctor,\na few weeks afterward, administered a subcutaneous morphine squirt in the\narm of a healthy servant girl because she had the headache, and she is now\nwith the rest of this veterinarian’s patients in a land that is fairer\nthan this.",
        "She lived six hours after she was prescribed for. He gave her change of\nscene and rest. He has quite a thriving little cemetery filled with people\nwho have succeeded in cording up enough of his change of scene and rest to\nlast them through all eternity. He was called once to prescribe for a man\nwhose head had been caved in by a stone match-box, and, after treating the\nman for asthma and blind staggers, he prescribed rest and change of scene\nfor him, too. The poor asthmatic is now breathing the extremely rarified\nair of the New Jerusalem.",
        "Meningitis is derived from the Latin Meninges, membrane, and–itis, an\naffix denoting inflammation, so that, strictly speaking, meningitis is the\ninflammation of a membrane, and when applied to the spine, or cerebrum, is\ncalled spinal meningitis, or cerebro-spinal meningitis, etc., according to\nthe part of the spine or brain involved in the inflammation. Meningitis is\na characteristic and result of so-called spotted fever, and by many it is\ndeemed identical with it.",
        "When we come to consider that the spinal cord, or marrow, runs down\nthrough the long, bony shaft made by the vertebrae, and that the brain and\nspine, though connected, are bound up in one continuous bony wall and\ncovered with this inflamed membrane, it is not difficult to understand\nthat the thing is very hard to get at. If your throat gets inflamed, a\ndoctor asks you to run your tongue out into society about a yard and a\nhalf, and he pries your mouth open with one of Rogers Brothers’ spoon\nhandles. Then he is able to examine your throat as he would a page of the\nCongressional Record, and to treat it with some local application. When\nyou have spinal meningitis, however, the doctor tackles you with bromides,\nergots, ammonia, iodine, chloral hydrate, codi, bromide of ammonia,\nhasheesh, bismuth, valerianate of ammonia, morphine sulph., nux vomica,\nturpentine emulsion, vox humana, rex magnus, opium, cantharides, Dover’s\npowders, and other bric-a-brac. These remedies are masticated and acted\nupon by the salivary glands, passed down the esophagus, thrown into the\nsociety of old gastric, submitted to the peculiar motion of the stomach\nand thoroughly chymified, then forwarded through the pyloric orifice into\nthe smaller intestines, where they are touched up with bile, and later on\nhanded over through the lacteals, thoracic duct, etc., to the vast\ncirculatory system. Here it is yanked back and forth through the heart,\nlungs and capillaries, and if anything is left to fork over to the\ndisease, it has to squeeze into the long, bony, air-tight socket that\nholds the spinal cord. All this is done without seeing the patient’s\nspinal cord before or after taking. If it could be taken out, and hung\nover a clothes line and cleansed with benzine, and then treated with\ninsect powder, or rolled in corn meal, or preserved in alcohol, and then\nput back, it would be all right; but you can’t. You pull a man’s spine out\nof his system and he is bound to miss it, no matter how careful you have\nbeen about it. It is difficult to keep house without the spine. You need\nit every time you cook a meal. If the spinal cord could be pulled by a\ndentist and put away in pounded ice every time it gets a hot-box, spinal\nmeningitis would lose its stinger.",
        "I was treated by thirteen physicians, whose names I may give in a future\narticle. They were, as I said, men I shall long remember. One of them said\nvery sensibly that meningitis was generally over-doctored. I told him that\nI agreed with him. I said that if I should have another year of meningitis\nand thirteen more doctors, I would have to postpone my trip to Europe,\nwhere I had hoped to go and cultivate my voice. I’ve got a perfectly\nlovely voice, if I would take it to Europe and have it sand-papered and\nvarnished, and mellowed down with beer and bologna.",
        "But I was speaking of my physicians. Some time I’m going to give their\nbiographies and portraits, as they did those of Dr. Bliss, Dr. Barnes and\nothers. Next year, if I can get railroad rates, I am going to hold a\nreunion of my physicians in Chicago. It will be a pleasant relaxation for\nthem, and will save the lives of a large percentage of their patients.",
        "THE COMET.",
        "The comet is a kind of astronomical parody on the planet. Comets look some\nlike planets, but they are thinner and do not hurt so hard when they hit\nanybody as a planet does. The comet was so called because it had hair on\nit, I believe, but late years the bald-headed comet is giving just as good\nsatisfaction everywhere.",
        "The characteristic features of a comet are: A nucleus, a nebulous light or\ncoma, and usually a luminous train or tail worn high. Sometimes several\ntails are observed on one comet, but this occurs only in flush times.",
        "When I was young I used to think I would like to be a comet in the sky, up\nabove the world so high, with nothing to do but loaf around and play with\nthe little new-laid planets and have a good time, but now I can see where\nI was wrong. Comets also have their troubles, their perihilions, their\nhyperbolas and their parabolas. A little over 300 years ago Tycho Brahe\ndiscovered that comets were extraneous to our atmosphere, and since then\ntimes have improved. I can see that trade is steadier and potatoes run\nless to tows than they did before.",
        "Soon after that they discovered that comets all had more or less\nperiodicity. Nobody knows how they got it. All the astronomers had been\nwatching them day and night and didn’t know when they were exposed, but\nthere was no time to talk and argue over the question. There were two or\nthree hundred comets all down with it at once. It was an exciting time.",
        "Comets sometimes live to a great age. This shows that the night air is not\nso injurious to the health as many people would have us believe. The great\ncomet of 1780 is supposed to have been the one that was noticed about the\ntime of Caesar’s death, 44 B.C., and still, when it appeared in Newton’s\ntime, seventeen hundred years after its first grand farewell tour, Ike\nsaid that it was very well preserved, indeed, and seemed to have retained\nall its faculties in good shape.",
        "Astronomers say that the tails of all comets are turned from the sun. I do\nnot know why they do this, whether it is etiquette among them or just a\nmere habit.",
        "A later writer on astronomy said that the substance of the nebulosity and\nthe tail is of almost inconceivable tenuity. He said this and then death\ncame to his relief. Another writer says of the comet and its tail that\n\"the curvature of the latter and the acceleration of the periodic time in\nthe case of Encke’s comet indicate their being affected by a resisting\nmedium which has never been observed to have the slightest influence on\nthe planetary periods.”",
        "I do not fully agree with the eminent authority, though he may be right.\nMuch fear has been the result of the comet’s appearance ever since the\nworld began, and it is as good a thing to worry about as anything I know\nof. If we could get close to a comet without frightening it away, we would\nfind that we could walk through it anywhere as we could through the glare\nof a torchlight procession. We should so live that we will not be ashamed\nto look a comet in the eye, however. Let us pay up our newspaper\nsubscription and lead such lives that when the comet strikes we will be\nready.",
        "Some worry a good deal about the chances for a big comet to plow into the\nsun some dark, rainy night, and thus bust up the whole universe. I wish\nthat was all I had to worry about. If any respectable man will agree to\npay my taxes and funeral expenses, I will agree to do his worrying about\nthe comet’s crashing into the bosom of the sun and knocking its daylights\nout.",
        "THE SUN.",
        "This luminous body is 92,000,000 miles from the earth, though there have\nbeen mornings this winter when it seemed to me that it was further than\nthat. A railway train going at the rate of 40 miles per hour would be 263\nyears going there, to say nothing of stopping for fuel or water, or\nstopping on side tracks to wait for freight trains to pass. Several years\nago it was discovered that a slight error had been made in the\ncalculations of the sun’s distance from the earth, and, owing to a\nmisplaced logarithm, or something of that kind, a mistake of 3,000,000\nmiles was made in the result. People cannot be too careful in such\nmatters. Supposing that, on the strength of the information contained in\nthe old time-table, a man should start out with only provisions sufficient\nto take him 89,000,000 miles and should then find that 3,0000,000 miles\nstill stretched out ahead of him. He would then have to buy fresh figs of\nthe train boy in order to sustain life. Think of buying nice fresh figs on\na train that had been en route 250 years!",
        "Imagine a train boy starting out at ten years of age, and perishing at the\nage of 60 years with only one-fifth of his journey accomplished. Think of\nfive train boys, one after the other, dying of old age on the way, and the\ntrain at last pulling slowly into the depot with not a living thing on\nboard except the worms in the “nice eating apples!”",
        "The sun cannot be examined through an ordinary telescope with impunity.\nOnly one man every tried that, and he is now wearing a glass eye that cost\nhim $9.",
        "If you examine the sun through an ordinary solar microscope, you discover\nthat it has a curdled or mottled appearance, as though suffering from\nbiliousness. It is also marked here and there by long streaks of light,\ncalled faculae, which look like foam flecks below a cataract. The spots on\nthe sun vary from minute pores the size of an ordinary school district to\nspots 100,000 miles in diameter, visible to the nude eye. The center of\nthese spots is as black as a brunette cat, and is called the umbra, so\ncalled because it resembles an umbrella. The next circle is less dark, and\ncalled the penumbra, because it so closely resembles the penumbra.",
        "There are many theories regarding these spots, but, to be perfectly candid\nwith the gentle reader, neither Prof. Proctor nor myself can tell exactly\nwhat they are. If we could get a little closer, we flatter ourselves that\nwe could speak more definitely. My own theory is they are either, first,\nopen air caucuses held by the colored people of the sun; or, second, they\nmay be the dark horses in the campaign; or, third, they may be the spots\nknocked off the defeated candidate by the opposition.",
        "Frankly, however, I do not believe either of these theories to be tenable.\nProf. Proctor sneers at these theories also on the ground that these spots\ndo not appear to revolve so fast as the sun. This, however, I am prepared\nto explain upon the theory that this might be the result of delays in the\nreturns However, I am free to confess that speculative science is filled\nwith the intangible.",
        "The sun revolves upon his or her axletree, as the case may be, once in 25\nto 28 of our days, so that a man living there would have almost two years\nto pay a 30-day note. We should so live that when we come to die we may go\nat once to the sun.",
        "Regarding the sun’s temperature, Sir John Herschel says that it is\nsufficient to melt a shell of ice covering its entire surface to a depth\nof 40 feet. I do not know whether he made this experiment personally or\nhired a man to do it for him.",
        "The sun is like the star spangled banner–as it is “still there.” You get\nup to-morrow morning just before sunrise and look away toward the east,\nand keep on looking in that direction, and at last you will see a fine\nsight, if what I have been told is true. If the sunrise is as grand as the\nsunset, it indeed must be one of nature’s most sublime phenomena.",
        "The sun is the great source of light and heat for our earth. If the sun\nwere to go somewhere for a few weeks for relaxation and rest, it would be\na cold day for us. The moon, too, would be useless, for she is largely\ndependent on the sun. Animal life would soon cease and real estate would\nbecome depressed in price. We owe very much of our enjoyment to the sun,\nand not many years ago there were a large number of people who worshiped\nthe sun. When a man showed signs of emotional insanity, they took him up\non the observatory of the temple and sacrificed him to the sun. They were\na very prosperous and happy people. If the conqueror had not come among\nthem with civilization and guns and grand juries they would have been very\nhappy, indeed.",
        "THE STARS.",
        "There is much in the great field of astronomy that is discouraging to the\nsavant who hasn’t the time nor means to rummage around through the\nheavens. At times I am almost hopeless, and feel like saying to the great\nyearnful, hungry world: “Grope on forever. Do not ask me for another\nscientific fact. Find it out yourself. Hunt up your own new-laid planets,\nand let me have a rest. Never ask me again to sit up all night and take\ncare of a newborn world, while you lie in bed and reck not.”",
        "I get no salary for examining the trackless void night after night when I\nought to be in bed. I sacrifice my health in order that the public may\nknow at once of the presence of a red-hot comet, fresh from the factory.\nAnd yet, what thanks do I get?",
        "Is it surprising that every little while I contemplate withdrawing from\nscientific research, to go and skin an eight-mule team down through the\ndim vista of relentless years?",
        "Then, again, you take a certain style of star, which you learn from\nProfessor Simon Newcomb is such a distance that it takes 50,000 years for\nits light to reach Boston. Now, we will suppose that after looking over\nthe large stock of new and second-hand stars, and after examining the\nspring catalogue and price list, I decide that one of the smaller size\nwill do me, and I buy it. How do I know that it was there when I bought\nit? Its cold and silent rays may have ceased 49,000 years before I was\nborn and the intelligence be still on the way. There is too much margin\nbetween sale and delivery. Every now and then another astronomer comes to\nme and says: “Professor, I have discovered another new star and intend to\nfile it. Found it last night about a mile and a half south of the zenith,\nrunning loose. Haven’t heard of anybody who has lost a star of the\nfifteenth magnitude, about thirteen hands high, with light mane and tail,\nhave you?” Now, how do I know that he has discovered a brand new star?\nHow can I discover whether he is or is not playing an old, threadbare star\non me for a new one?",
        "We are told that there has been no perceptible growth or decay in the star\nbusiness since man began to roam around through space, in his mind, and\nmake figures on the barn door with red chalk showing the celestial time\ntable.",
        "No serious accidents have occurred in the starry heavens since I began to\nobserve and study their habits. Not a star has waxed, not a star has\nwaned to my knowledge. Not a planet has season-cracked or shown any of\nthe injurious effects of our rigorous climate. Not a star has ripened\nprematurely or fallen off the trees. The varnish on the very oldest stars\nI find on close and critical examination to be in splendid condition.\nThey will all no doubt wear as long as we need them, and wink on long\nafter we have ceased to wink back.",
        "In 1866 there appeared suddenly in the northern crown a star of about the\nthird magnitude and worth at least $250. It was generally conceded by\nastronomers that this was a brand new star that had never been used, but\nupon consulting Argelander’s star catalogue and price list it was found\nthat this was not a new star at all, but an old, faded star of the ninth\nmagnitude, with the front breadths turned wrong side out and trimmed with\nmoonlight along the seams. After a few days of phenomenal brightness, it\ngently ceased to draw a salary as a star of the third magnitude, and\nwalked home with an Uncle Tom’s Cabin company.",
        "It is such things as this that make the life of the astronomer one of\nconstant and discouraging toil. I have long contemplated, as I say, the\nadvisability of retiring from this field of science and allowing others to\nlight the northern lights, skim the milky way and do other celestial\nchores. I would do it myself cheerfully if my health would permit, but for\nyears I have realized, and so has my wife, that my duties as an astronomer\nkept me up too much at night, and my wife is certainly right about it when\nshe says if I insist on scanning the heavens night after night, coming\nhome late with the cork out of my telescope and my eyes red and swollen\nwith these exhausting night vigils, I will be cut down in my prime. So I\nam liable to abandon the great labor to which I had intended to devote my\nlife, my dazzling genius and my princely income. I hope that other savants\nwill spare me the pain of another refusal, for my mind is fully made up\nthat unless another skimmist is at once secured, the milky way will\nhenceforth remain unskum.",
        "I had a very thrilling experience the other evening. I had just filled an\nengagement in a strange city, and retired to my cozy room at the hotel.",
        "The thunders of applause had died away, and the opera house had been\nlocked up to await the arrival of an Uncle Tom’s Cabin Company. The last\nloiterer had returned to his home, and the lights in the palace of the\npork packer were extinguished.",
        "No sound was heard, save the low, tremulous swash of the sleet outside, or\nthe death-rattle in the throat of the bath-tub. Then all was still as the\nbosom of a fried chicken when the spirit has departed.",
        "The swallow-tail coat hung limp and weary in the wardrobe, and the gross\nreceipts of the evening were under my pillow. I needed sleep, for I was\nworn out with travel and anxiety, but the fear of being robbed kept me\nfrom repose. I know how desperate a man becomes when he yearns for\nanother’s gold. I know how cupidity drives a wicked man to mangle his\nvictim, that he may win precarious prosperity, and how he will often take\na short cut to wealth by means of murder, when, if he would enter\npolitics, he might accomplish his purpose as surely and much more safely.",
        "Anon, however, tired nature succumbed. I know I had succumbed, for the\nbell-boy afterward testified that he heard me do so.",
        "The gentle warmth of the steam-heated room, and the comforting assurance\nof duty well done and the approval of friends, at last lulled me into a\ngentle repose.",
        "Anyone who might have looked upon me, as I lay there in that innocent\nslumber, with the winsome mouth slightly ajar and the playful limbs cast\nwildly about, while a merry smile now and then flitted across the regular\nfeatures, would have said that no heart could be so hard as to harbor ill\nfor one so guileless and so simple.",
        "I do not know what it was that caused me to wake. Some slight sound or\nother, no doubt, broke my slumber, and I opened my eyes wildly. The room\nwas in semi-darkness.",
        "Hark!",
        "A slight movement in the corner, and the low, regular breathing of a human\nbeing! I was now wide awake. Possibly I could have opened my eyes wider,\nbut not without spilling them out of their sockets.",
        "Regularly came that soft, low breathing. Each time it seemed like a sigh\nof relief, but it did not relieve me. Evidently it was not done for that\npurpose. It sounded like a sigh of blessed relief, such as a woman might\nheave after she has returned from church and transferred herself from the\nembrace of her new Russia iron, black silk dress into a friendly wrapper.",
        "Regularly, like the rise and fall of a wave on the summer sea, it rose and\nfell, while my pale lambrequin of hair rose and fell fitfully with it.",
        "I know that people who read this will laugh at it, but there was nothing\nto laugh at. At first I feared that the sigh might be that of a woman who\nhad entered the room through a transom in order to see me, as I lay wrapt\nin slumber, and then carry the picture away to gladden her whole life.",
        "But no. That was hardly possible. It was cupidity that had driven some\ncruel villain to enter my apartments and to crouch in the gloom till the\nproper moment should come in which to spring upon me, throttle me, crowd a\nhotel pillow into each lung, and, while I did the Desdemona act, rob me of\nmy hard-earned wealth.",
        "Regularly still rose the soft breathing, as though the robber might be\ntrying to suppress it. I reached gently under the pillow, and securing the\nmoney I put it in the pocket of my robe de nuit. Then, with great care,\nI pulled out a copy of Smith & Wesson’s great work on “How to Ventilate\nthe Human Form.” I said to myself that I would sell my life as dearly as\npossible, so that whoever bought it would always regret the trade.",
        "Then I opened the volume at the first chapter and addressed a thirty-\neight calibre remark in the direction of the breath in the corner.",
        "When the echoes had died away a sigh of relief welled up from the dark\ncorner. Also another sigh of relief later on.",
        "I then decided to light the gas and fight it out. You have no doubt seen a\nman scratch a match on the leg of his pantaloons. Perhaps you have also\nseen an absent-minded man undertake to do so, forgetting that his\npantaloons were hanging on a chair at the other end of the room.",
        "However, I lit the gas with my left hand and kept my revolver pointed\ntoward the dark corner where the breath was still rising and falling.",
        "People who had heard my lecture came rushing in, hoping to find that I had\nsuicided, but they found that, instead of humoring the public in that way,\nI had shot the valve off the steam radiator.",
        "It is humiliating to write the foregoing myself, but I would rather do so\nthan have the affair garbled by careless hands.",
        "A pleasing anecdote is being told through the press columns recently, of\nan encounter on the South Platte, which occurred some years ago between a\nTexan and a buffalo. The recital sets forth the fact that the Texans went\nout to hunt buffalo, hoping to get enough for a mess during the day.\nToward evening they saw two gentlemen buffalo on a neighboring hill near\nthe Platte, and at once pursued their game, each selecting an animal. They\nseparated at once, Jack going one way galloping after his beast, while Sam\nwent in the other direction. Jack soon got a shot at his game, but the\nbullet only tore a large hole in the fleshy shoulder of the bull and\nburied itself in the neck, maddening the animal to such a degree that he\nturned at once and charged upon horse and rider.",
        "The astonished horse, with the wonderful courage, sagacity and sang\nfroid peculiar to the broncho, whirled around two consecutive times,\ntangled his feet in the tall grass and fell, throwing his rider about\nfifty feet. He then rose and walked away to a quiet place, where he could\nconsider the matter and give the buffalo an opportunity to recover.",
        "The infuriated bull then gave chase to Jack, who kept out of the way for a\nfew yards only, when, getting his legs entangled in the grass, he fell so\nsuddenly that his pursuer dashed over him without doing him any bodily\ninjury. However, as the animal went over his prostrate form, Jack felt the\nbuffalo’s tail brush across his face, and, rising suddenly, he caught it\nwith a terrific grip and hung to it, thus keeping out of the reach of his\nenemy’s horns, till his strength was just giving out, when Sam hove in\nsight and put a large bullet through the bull’s heart.",
        "This tale is told, apparently, by an old plainsman and scout, who reels it\noff as though he might be telling his own experience.",
        "Now, I do not wish to seem captious and always sticking my nose into what\nis none of my business, but as a logical and zoological fact, I desire, in\nmy cursory way, to coolly take up the subject of the buffalo tail. Those\nwho have been in the habit of killing buffaloes, instead of running an\naccount at the butcher shop, will remember that this noble animal has a\ngenuine camel’s hair tail about eight inches long, with a chenille tassel\nat the end, which he throws up into the rarified atmosphere of the far\nwest, whenever he is surprised or agitated.",
        "In passing over a prostrate man, therefore, I apprehend that in order to\nbrush his face with the average buffalo tail, it would be necessary for\nhim to sit down on the bosom of the prostrate scout and fan his features\nwith the miniature caudal bud.",
        "The buffalo does not gallop an hundred miles a day, dragging his tail\nacross the bunch grass and alkali of the boundless plains.",
        "He snorts a little, turns his bloodshot eyes toward the enemy a moment and\nthen, throwing his cunning little taillet over the dash-boardlet, he wings\naway in an opposite direction.",
        "The man who could lie on his back and grab that vision by the tail would\nhave to be moderately active. If he succeeded, however, it would be a\nquestion of the sixteenth part of a second only, whether he had his arms\njerked out by the roots and scattered through space or whether he had\nstrength of will sufficient to yank out the withered little frizz and told\nthe quivering ornament in his hands. Few people have the moral courage to\nfollow a buffalo around over half a day holding on by the tail. It is\nsaid that a Sioux brave once tried it, and they say his tracks were\nthirteen miles apart. After merrily sauntering around with the buffalo one\nhour, during which time he crossed the territories of Wyoming and Dakota\ntwice and surrounded the regular army three times, he became discouraged\nand died fiom the injuries he had received. Perhaps, however, it may have\nbeen fatigue.",
        "It might be possible for a man to catch hold of the meager tail of a\nmeteor and let it snatch him through the coming years.",
        "It might be, that a man with a strong constitution could catch a cyclone\nand ride it bareback across the United States and then have a fresh one\nready to ride back again, but to catch a buffalo bull in the full flush of\nmanhood, as it were, and retain his tail while he crossed three\nreservations and two mountain ranges, requires great tenacity of purpose\nand unusual mental equipoise.",
        "Remember, I do not regard the story I refer to as false, at least I do not\nwish to be so understood. I simply say that it recounts an incident that\nis rather out of the ordinary. Let the gentle reader lie down and have a\nJackrabbit driven across his face, for instance. The J. Rabbit is as\nlikely to brush your face with his brief and erect tail as the buffalo\nwould be. Then carefully note how rapidly and promptly instantaneous you\nmust be. Then closely attend to the manner in which you abruptly and\nalmost simultaneously, have not retained the tail in your memory.",
        "A few people may have successfully seized the grieved and startled buffalo\nby the tail, but they are not here to testify to the circumstances. They\nare dead, abnormally and extremely dead.",
        "After viewing the birthplace of the Adamses out at Quincy I felt more\nreconciled to my own birthplace. Comparing the house in which I was born\nwith those in which other eminent philanthropists and high-priced\nstatesmen originated, I find that I have no reason to complain. Neither of\nthe Adamses were born in a larger house than I was, and for general tone\nand eclat of front yard and cook-room on behind, I am led to believe that\nI have the advantage.",
        "John Adams was born before John Quincy Adams. A popular idea seems to\nprevail in some sections of the Union that inasmuch as John Q. was\nbald-headed, he was the eider of the two; but I inquired about that while\non the ground where they were both born, and ascertained from people who\nwere familiar with the circumstances, that John was born first.",
        "John Adams was the second president of the United States. He was a lawyer\nby profession, but his attention was called to politics by the passage of\nthe stamp act in 1765. He was one of the delegates who represented\nMassachusetts in the first Continental Congress, and about that time he\nwrote a letter in which he said: “The die is now cast; I have passed the\nrubicon. Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish with my country is\nmy unalterable determination.” Some have expressed the opinion that “the\nrubicon” alluded to by Mr. Adams in this letter was a law which he had\nsucceeded in getting passed; but this is not true. The idea of passing the\nrubicon first originated with Julius Caesar, a foreigner of some note who\nflourished a good deal B.C.",
        "In June, 1776, Mr. Adams seconded a resolution, moved by Richard Henry\nLee, that the United States “are, and of right ought to be, free and\nindependent.” Whenever Mr. Adams could get a chance to whoop for liberty\nnow and forever, one and inseparable, he invariably did so.",
        "In 1796, Mr. Adams ran for president. In the convention it was nip and\ntuck between Thomas Jefferson and himself, but Jefferson was understood to\nbe a Universalist, or an Universalist, whichever would look the best in\nprint, and so he only got 68 votes out of a possible 139. In 1800,\nhowever, Jefferson turned the tables on him, and Mr. Adams only received\n65 to Jefferson’s 73 votes.",
        "Mr. Adams made a good president and earned his salary, though it wasn’t so\nmuch of a job as it is now. When there was no Indian war in those days the\npresident could put on an old blue flannel shirt and such other clothes as\nhe might feel disposed to adopt, and fish for bull heads in the Potomac\ntill his nose peeled in the full glare of the fervid sun.",
        "Now it is far different. By the time we get through with a president\nnowadays he isn’t good for much. Mr. Hayes stood the fatigue of being\npresident better, perhaps, than any other man since the republic became so\nlarge a machine. Mr. Hayes went home to Fremont with his mind just as\nfresh and his brain as cool as when he pulled up his coat tails to sit\ndown in the presidential chair. The reason why Mr. Hayes saved his mind,\nhis brain and his salary, was plain enough when we stop to consider that\nhe did not use them much during his administration.",
        "John Quincy Adams was the sixth president of the United States and the\neldest son of John Adams. He was one of the most eloquent of orators, and\nshines in history as one of the most polished of our eminent and\nbald-headed Americans. When he began to speak, his round, smooth head, to\nlook down upon it from the gallery, resembled a nice new billiard ball,\nbut as he warmed up and became more thoroughly stirred, his intellectual\ndome changed to a delicate pink. Then, when he rose to the full height of\nhis eloquent flight, and prepared to swoop down upon his adversaries and\ncarry them into camp, it is said that his smooth intellectual rink was as\nred as the flush of rosy dawn on the 5th day of July.",
        "He was educated both at home and abroad. That is the reason he was so\npolished. After he got so that he could readily spell and pronounce the\nmost difficult words to be found in the large stores of Boston, he was\nsent to Europe, where he acquired several foreign tongues, and got so that\nhe could converse with the people of Europe very fluently, if they were\nfamiliar with English as she is spoke.",
        "John Quincy Adams was chosen president by the House of Representatives,\nthere being no choice in the electoral contest, Adams receiving 84 votes,\nAndrew Jackson 99, William H. Crawford 41, and Henry Clay 37. Clay stood\nin with Mr. Adams in the House of Representatives deal, it was said, and\nwas appointed secretary of state under Mr. Adams as a result. This may not\nbe true, but a party told me about it who got it straight from Washington,\nand he also told me in confidence that he made it a rule never to\nprevaricate.",
        "Mr. Adams was opposed to American slavery, and on several occasions in\nCongress alluded to his convictions.",
        "He was in Congress seventeen years, and during that time he was frequently\non his feet attending to little matters in which he felt an interest, and\nwhen he began to make allusions, and blush all over the top of his head,\nand kick the desk, and throw ink-bottles at the presiding officer, they\nsay that John Q. made them pay attention. Seward says, “with unwavering\nfirmness, against a bitter and unscrupulous opposition, exasperated to the\nhighest pitch by his pertinacity–amidst a perfect tempest of vituperation\nand abuse–he persevered in presenting his anti-slavery petitions, one by\none, to the amount sometimes of 200 in one day.” As one of his eminent\nbiographers has truly said: “John Quincy Adams was indeed no slouch.”",
        "The Wail Of A Wife.",
        "“Ethel” has written a letter to me and asked for a printed reply. Leaving\noff the opening sentences, which I would not care to have fall into the\nhands of my wife, her note is about as follows:",
        "“–– Vt., Feb. 28, 1885.",
        "My Dear Sir:",
        "[Tender part of letter omitted for obvious reasons.] Would it be asking\ntoo much for me to request a brief reply to one or two questions which\nmany other married women as well as myself would like to have answered?",
        "I have been married now for five years. To-day is the anniversary of my\nmarriage. When I was single I was a teacher and supported myself in\ncomfort. I had more pocket-money and dressed fully as well if not better\nthan I do now. Why should girls who are abundantly able to earn their own\nlivelihood struggle to become the slave of a husband and children, and tie\nthemselves to a man when they might be free and happy?",
        "I think too much is said by the men in a light and flippant manner about\nthe anxiety of young ladies to secure a home and a husband, and still they\ndo deserve a part of it, as I feel that I do now for assuming a great\nburden when I was comparatively independent and comfortable.",
        "Now, will you suggest any advice that you think would benefit the yet\nunmarried and self-supporting girls who are liable to make the same\nmistake that I did, and thus warn them in a manner that would be so much\nmore universal in its range, and reach so many more people than I could if\nI should raise my voice? Do this and you will be gratefully remembered by",
        "Ethel.”",
        "It would indeed be a tough, tough man who could ignore thy gentle plea,\nEthel; tougher far than the pale, intellectual hired man who now addresses\nyou in this private and underhanded manner, unknown to your husband.\nPlease destroy this letter, Ethel, as soon as you see it in print, so that\nit will not fall into the hands of Mr. Ethel, for if it should, I am gone.\nIf your husband were to run across this letter in the public press I could\nnever look him in the eye again.",
        "You say that you had more pocket-money before you were married than you\nhave since, Ethel, and you regret your rash step. I am sorry to hear it.\nYou also say that you wore better clothes when you were single than you do\nnow. You are also pained over that. It seems that marriage with you has\nnot paid any cash dividends. So that if you married Mr. Ethel as a\nfinancial venture, it was a mistake. You do not state how it has affected\nyour husband. Perhaps he had more pocket-money and better clothes before\nhe married than he has since. Sometimes two people do well in business by\nthemselves, but when they go into partnership they bust higher than a\nkite, if you will allow me the free, English translation of a Roman\nexpression which you might not fully understand if I should give it to you\nin the original Roman.",
        "Lots of self-supporting young ladies have married and had to go very light\non pin-money after that, and still they did not squeal, as you, dear\nEthel. They did not marry for revenue only. They married for protection.\n(This is a little political bon mot which I thought of myself. Some of my\nbest jokes this spring are jokes that I thought of myself.)",
        "No, Ethel, if you married expecting to be a dormant partner during the day\nand then to go through Mr. Ethel’s pantaloons pocket at night and declare\na dividend, of course life is full of bitter, bitter regret and\ndisappointment. Perhaps it is also for Mr. Ethel. Anyhow, I can’t help\nfeeling a pang of sympathy for him. You do not say that he is unkind or\nthat he so far forgets himself as to wake you up in the morning with a\nharsh tone of voice and a yearling club. You do not say that he asks you\nfor pocket-money, or, if so, whether you give it to him or not.",
        "Of course I want to do what is right in the solemn warning business, so I\nwill give notice to all simple young women who are now self-supporting and\nhappy, that there is no statute requiring them to assume the burdens of\nwifehood and motherhood unless they prefer to do so. If they now have\nabundance of pin-money and new clothes, they may remain single if they\nwish without violating the laws of the land. This rule is also good when\napplied to young and self-supporting young men who wear good clothes and\nhave funds in their pockets. No young man who is free, happy and\nindependent, need invest his money in a family or carry a colicky child\ntwenty-seven miles and two laps in one night unless he prefers it. But\nthose who go into it with the right spirit, Ethel, do not regret it.",
        "I would just as soon tell you, Ethel, if you will promise that it shall go\nno farther, that I do not wear as good clothes as I did before I was\nmarried. I don’t have to. My good clothes have accomplished what I got\nthem for. I played them for all they were worth, and since I got married\nthe idea of wearing clothes as a vocation has not occurred to me.",
        "Please give my kind regards to Mr. Ethel, and tell him that although I do\nnot know him personally, I cannot help feeling sorry for him.",
        "Last week for the first time I visited the granite obelisk known all over\nthe civilized world as Bunker Hill monument. Sixty years ago, if my memory\nserves me correctly. General La Fayette, since deceased, laid the\ncorner-stone, and Daniel Webster made a few desultory remarks which I\ncannot now recall. Eighteen years later it was formally dedicated, and\nDaniel spoke a good piece, composed mostly of things that he had thought\nup himself. There has never been a feature of the early history and\nunceasing struggle for American freedom which has so roused my admiration\nas this custom, quite prevalent among congressmen in those days, of\nwriting their own speeches.",
        "Many of Webster’s most powerful speeches were written by himself or at his\nsuggestion. He was a plain, unassuming man, and did not feel above writing\nhis speeches. I have always had the greatest respect and admiration for\nMr. Webster as a citizen, as a scholar and as an extemporaneous speaker,\nand had he not allowed his portrait to appear last year in the Century,\nwearing an air of intense gloom and a plug hat entirely out of style, my\nrespect and admiration would have continued indefinitely.",
        "Bunker Hill monument is a great success as a monument, and the view from\nits summit is said to be well worth the price of admission. I did not\nascend the obelisk, because the inner staircase was closed to visitors on\nthe day of my visit and the lightning rod on the outside looked to me as\nthough it had been recently oiled.",
        "On the following day, however, I engaged a man to ascend the monument and\ntell me his sensations. He assured me that they were first-rate. At the\nfeet of the spectator Boston and its environments are spread out in the\nglad sunshine. Every day Boston spreads out her environments just that\nway.",
        "Bunker Hill monument is 221 feet in height, and has been entirely paid\nfor. The spectator may look at the monument with perfect impunity, without\nbeing solicited to buy some of its mortgage bonds. This adds much to the\ngenuine thrill of pleasure while gazing at it.",
        "There is a Bunker Hill in Macoupin County, Illinois, also in Ingham\nCounty, Michigan, and in Russell County, Kansas, but General Warren was\nnot killed at either of these points.",
        "One hundred and ten years ago, on the 17th day of the present month, one\nof America’s most noted battles with the British was fought near where\nBunker Hill monument now stands. In that battle the British lost 1,050 in\nkilled and wounded, while the American loss numbered but 450. While the\npeople of this country are showing such an interest in our war history, I\nam surprised that something has not been said about Bunker Hill. The\nFederal forces from Roxbury to Cambridge were under command of General\nArtemus Ward, the great American humorist. When the American humorist\nreally puts on his war paint and sounds the tocsin, he can organize a\ngreat deal of mourning.",
        "General Ward was assisted by Putnam, Starke, Prescott, Gridley and\nPomeroy. Colonel William Prescott was sent over from Cambridge to\nCharlestown for the purpose of fortifying Bunker Hill. At a council of war\nit was decided to fortify Breeds Hill, not so high but nearer to Boston\nthan Bunker Hill. So a redoubt was thrown up during the night on the\nground where the monument now stands.",
        "The British landed a large force under Generals Howe and Pigot, and at 2\nP.M. the Americans were reinforced by Generals Warren and Pomeroy. General\nWarren was of a literary turn of mind and during the battle took his hat\noff and recited a little poem beginning:",

        "A man who could deliver an impromptu and extemporaneous address like that\nin public, and while there was such a bitter feeling of hostility on the\npart of the audience, must have been a good scholar. In our great\nfratricidal strife twenty years ago, the inferiority of our generals in\nthis respect was painfully noticeable. We did not have a commander who\ncould address his troops in rhyme to save his neck. Several of them were\npretty good in blank verse, but it was so blank that it was not just the\nthing to fork over to posterity and speak in school afterward.",
        "Colonel Prescott’s statue now stands where he is supposed to have stood\nwhen he told his men to reserve their fire till they saw the whites of the\nenemy’s eyes. Those who have examined the cast-iron flint-lock weapon used\nin those days will admit that this order was wise. Those guns were in\nunion to health, of course, when used to excess, but not necessarily or\nimmediately fatal.",
        "At the time of the third attack by the British, the Americans were out of\nammunition, but they met the enemy with clubbed muskets, and it was found\nthat one end of the rebel flint-lock was about as fatal as the other, if\nnot more so.",

        "I have just returned from a little impromptu farewell tour in the lumber\ncamps toward Lake Superior. It was my idea to wade around in the snow for\na few weeks and swallow baked beans and ozone on the 1/2 shell. The affair\nwas a success. I put up at Bootjack camp on the raging Willow River, where\nthe gay-plumaged chipmunk and the spruce gum have their home.",
        "Winter in the pine woods is fraught with fun and frolic. It is more\nfraught with fatigue than funds, however. This winter a man in the\nMichigan and Wisconsin lumber camps could arise at 4:30 A.M., eat a\npatent pail full of dried apples soaked with Young Hyson and sweetened\nwith Persian glucose, go out to the timber with a lantern, hew down the\ngiants of the forest, with the snow up to the pit of his stomach, till the\ngray owl in the gathering gloom whooped and hooted in derision, and all\nfor $12 per month and stewed prunes.",
        "I did not try to accumulate wealth while I was in camp. I just allowed\nothers to enter into the mad rush and wrench a fortune from the hand of\nfate while I studied human nature and the cook. I had a good many pleasant\ndays there, too. I read such literary works as I could find around the\ncamp, and smoked the royal Havana smoking tobacco of the cookee. Those who\nhave not lumbered much do not know much of true joy and sylvan smoking\ntobacco.",
        "They are not using a very good grade of the weed in the lumber regions\nthis winter. When I say lumber regions I do not refer entirely to the\ncircumstances of a weak back. (Monkey-wrench, oil can and screwdriver sent\nwith this joke; also rules for working it in all kinds of goods.) The\ntobacco used by the pine choppers of the northern forest is called the\nScandihoovian. I do not know why they call it that, unless it is because\nyon can smoke it in Wisconsin and smell it in Scandihoovia.",
        "When night came we would gather around the blazing fire and talk over old\ntimes and smoke this tobacco. I smoked it till last week, then I bought a\nnew mouth and resolved to lead a different life.",
        "I shall never forget the evenings we spent together in that log shack in\nthe heart of the forest. They are graven on my memory where time’s\neffacing fingers can not monkey with them. We would most always converse.\nThe crew talked the Norwegian language and I am using the English language\nmostly this winter. So each enjoyed himself in his own quiet way. This\nseemed to throw the Norwegians a good deal together. It also threw me a\ngood deal together. The Scandinavians soon learn our ways and our\nlanguage, but prior to that they are quite clannish.",
        "The cook, however, was an Ohio man. He spoke the Sandusky dialect with a\nrich, nut brown flavor that did me much good, so that after I talked with\nthe crew a few hours in English, and received their harsh, corduroy\nreplies in Norske, I gladly fled to the cook shanty. There I could rapidly\nchange to the smoothly flowing sentences peculiar to the Ohio tongue, and\nwhile I ate the common twisted doughnut of commerce, we would talk on and\non of the pleasant days we had spent in our native land. I don’t know how\nmany hours I have thus spent, bringing the glad light into the eye of the\ncook as I spoke to him of Mrs. Hayes, an estimable lady, partially\nmarried, and now living at Fremont, Ohio.",
        "I talked to him of his old home till the tears would unbidden start, as he\nrolled out the dough with a common Budweiser beer bottle, and shed the\nscalding into the flour barrel. Tears are always unavailing, but sometimes\nI think they are more so when they are shed into a barrel of flour. He was\nan easy weeper. He would shed tears on the slightest provocation, or\nanything else. Once I told him something so touchful that his eyes were\nblinded with tears for the nonce. Then I took a pie, and stole away so\nthat he could be alone with his sorrow.",
        "He used to grind the coffee at 2 A.M. The coffee mill was nailed up\nagainst a partition on the opposite side from my bed. That is one reason I\ndid not stay any longer at the camp. It takes about an hour to grind\ncoffee enough for thirty men, and as my ear was generally against the pine\nboards when the cook began, it ruffled my slumbers and made me a morose\nman.",
        "We had three men at the camp who snored. If they had snored in my own\nlanguage I could have endured it, but it was entirely unintelligible to me\nas it was. Still, it wasn’t bad either. They snored on different keys, and\nstill there was harmony in it–a kind of chime of imported snore as it\nwere. I used to lie and listen to it for hours. Then the cook would begin\nhis coffee mill overture and I would arise.",

It also\ntreats of the various styles of oratory peculiar to America, with\nspecimens of American oratory that have been pressed and dried especially\nfor this lecture.

Before 8 o’clock 500 people had been\nturned away. Mr. Nye announced that he would deliver a matinee this\nafternoon, but he has been petitioned by tradesmen to refrain from doing\nso, as it will paralyze the business interests of the city to such a\ndegree that they offer to “buy the house,” and allow the lecturer to\ncancel his engagement.",

        "Receiving another notice of assessment on my stock in the Aladdin mine the\nother day, reminded me that I was still interested in a bottomless hole\nthat was supposed at one time to yield funds instead of absorbing them.\nThe Aladdin claim was located in the spring of ’76 by a syndicate of\njournalists, none of whom had ever been openly accused of wealth. If we\nhad been, we could have proved an alibi.",
        "We secured a gang of miners to sink on the discovery, consisting of a\nChinaman named How Long. How Long spoke the Chinese language with great\nfluency. Being perfectly familiar with that language, and a little musty\nin the trans-Missouri English, he would converse with us in his own\nlanguage, sometimes by the hour, courteously overlooking the fact that we\ndid not reply to him in the same tongue. He would converse in this way\ntill he ran down, generally, and then he would refrain for a while.",
        "Finally, How Long signified that he would like to draw his salary. Of\ncourse he was ignorant of our ways, and as innocent of any knowledge of\nthe intricate details peculiar to a mining syndicate as the child unborn.\nSo he had gone to the president of our syndicate and had been referred to\nthe superintendent, and he had sent How Long to the auditor, and the\nauditor had told him to go to the gang boss and get his time, and then\nproceed in the proper manner, after which, if his claim turned out to be\nall right, we would call a meeting of the syndicate and take early action\nin relation to it. By this, the reader will readily see that, although we\nwere not wealthy, we knew how to do business just the same as though we\nhad been a wealthy corporation.",
        "How Long attended one of our meetings and at the close of the session made\na few remarks. As near as I am able to recall his language, it was very\nmuch as follows:",

        "Owing to a strike which then took place in our mine, we found that, in\norder to complete our assessment work, we must get in another crew or do\nthe job ourselves. Owing to scarcity of help and a feeling of antagonism\non the part of the laboring classes toward our giant enterprise, a feeling\nof hostility which naturally exists between labor and capital, we had to\ngo out to the mine ourselves. We had heard of other men who had shoveled\nin their own mines and were afterward worth millions of dollars, so we\ntook some bacon and other delicacies and hied us to the Aladdin.",
        "Buck, our mining expert, went down first. Then he requested us to hoist\nhim out again. We did so. I have forgotten what his first remark was when\nhe got out of the bucket, but that don’t make any difference, for I\nwouldn’t care to use it here anyway.",
        "It seems that How Long, owing to his heathenish ignorance of our customs\nand the unavoidable delay in adjusting his claim for work, labor and\nservices, had allowed his temper to get the better of him, and he had\nplanted a colony of American skunks in the shaft of the Aladdin.",
        "That is the reason we left the Aladdin mine and no one jumped it. We had\nnot done the necessary work in order to hold it, but when we went out\nthere the following spring we found that no one had jumped it.",
        "Even the rough, coarse miner, far from civilizing influences and beyond\nthe reach of social advantages, recognizes the fact that this Little,\nunostentatious animal plodding along through life in its own modest way,\nyet wields a wonderful influence over the destinies of man. So the Aladdin\nmine was not disturbed that summer.",
        "We paid How Long, and in the following spring had a flattering offer for\nthe claim if it assayed as well as we said it would, so Buck, our expert,\nwent out to the Aladdin with an assayer and the purchaser. The assay of\nthe Aladdin showed up very rich indeed, far above anything that I had ever\nhoped for, and so we made a sale. But we never got the money, for when the\nassayer got home he casually assayed his apparatus and found that his\nwhole outfit had been salted prior to the Aladdin assay.",
        "I do not think our expert, Buck, would salt an assayer’s kit, but he was\ncharged with it at this time, and he said he would rather lose his trade\nthan have trouble over it. He would rather suffer wrong than to do wrong,\nhe said, and so the Aladdin came back on our hands.",
        "It is not a very good mine if a man wants it as a source of revenue, but\nit makes a mighty good well. The water is cold and clear as crystal. If it\nstood in Boston, instead of out there in northern Colorado, where you\ncan’t get at it more than three months in the year, it would be worth\n$150. The great fault of the Aladdin mine is its poverty as a mine, and\nits isolation as a well.",
        "Last week we went up to the Coliseum, at Minneapolis, to hear Theodore\nThomas’ orchestra, the Wagner trio and Christine Nilsson. The Coliseum\nis a large rink just out of Minneapolis, on the road between that city\nand St. Paul. It can seat 4,000 people comfortably, but the management\nlike to wedge 4,500 people in there on a warm day, and then watch the\nperspiration trickle out through the clapboards on the outside. On the\nclosing afternoon, during the matinee performance, the building was\nstruck by lightning and a hole knocked out of the Corinthian duplex that\nsurmounts the oblique portcullis on the off side. The reader will see at\nonce the location of the bolt.",
        "The lightning struck the flag-staff, ran down the leg of a man who was\nrepairing the electric light, took a chew of his tobacco, turned his\nboot wrong side out and induced him to change his sock, toyed with a\nchilblain, wrenched out a soft corn and roguishly put it in his ear,\nthen ran down the electric light wire, a part of it filling an\nengagement in the Coliseum and the balance following the wire to the\ndepot, where it made double-pointed toothpicks of a pole fifty feet\nhigh. All this was done very briefly. Those who have seen lightning toy\nwith a cottonwood tree, know that this fluid makes a specialty of it at\nonce and in a brief manner. The lightning in this case, broke the glass\nin the skylight and deposited the broken fragments on a half dozen\nparquette chairs, that were empty because the speculators who owned them\ncouldn’t get but $50 apiece, and were waiting for a man to mortgage his\nresidence and sell a team. He couldn’t make the transfer in time for the\nmatinee, so the seats were vacant when the lightning struck. The\nimmediate and previous fluid then shot athwart the auditorium in the\ndirection of the platform, where it nearly frightened to death a large\nchorus of children. Women fainted, ticket speculators fell $2 on\ndesirable seats, and strong men coughed up a clove. The scene beggared\ndescription. I intended to have said that before, but forgot it.\nTheodore Thomas drew in a full breath, and Christine Nilsson drew her\nsalary. Two thousand strong men thought of their wasted lives, and two\nthousand women felt for their back hair to see if it was still there. I\nsay, therefore, without successful contradiction, that the scene\nbeggared description. Chestnuts!",
        "In the evening several people sang, “The Creation.” Nilsson was Gabriel.\nGabriel has a beautiful voice cut low in the neck, and sings like a\njoyous bobolink in the dew-saturated mead. How’s that? Nilsson is proud\nand haughty in her demeanor, and I had a good notion to send a note up\nto her, stating that she needn’t feel so lofty, and if she could sit up\nin the peanut gallery where I was and look at herself, with her dress\nkind of sawed off at the top, she would not be so vain. She wore a\ndiamond necklace and silk skirt The skirt was cut princesse, I think, to\nharmonize with her salary. As an old neighbor of mine said when he\npainted the top board of his fence green, he wanted it “to kind of\ncorroborate with his blinds.” He’s the same man who went to Washington\nabout the time of the Guiteau trial, and said he was present at the\n\"post mortise” examination. But the funniest thing of all, he said, was\nto see Dr. Mary Walker riding one of these “philosophers” around on the\nstreets.",
        "But I am wandering. We were speaking of the Festival. Theodore Thomas is\ncertainly a great leader. What a pity he is out of politics. He pounded\nthe air all up fine there, Thursday. I think he has 25 small-size\nfiddles, 10 medium-size, and 5 of those big, fat ones that a bald-headed\nman generally annoys. Then there were a lot of wind instruments, drums,\net cetera. There were 600 performers on the stage, counting the chorus,\nwith 4,500 people in the house and 3,000 outside yelling it the ticket\noffice–also at the top of their voices–and swearing because they\ncouldn’t mortgage their immortal souls and hear Nilsson’s coin silver\nnotes. It was frightful. The building settled twelve inches in those\ntwo hours and a half, the electric lights went out nine times for\nrefreshments, and, on the whole, the entertainment was a grand success.\nThe first time the lights adjourned, an usher came in on the stage\nthrough a side entrance with a kerosene lamp. I guess he would have\nstood there and held it for Nilsson to sing by, if 4,500 people hadn’t\nwith one voice laughed him out into the starless night. You might as\nwell have tried to light benighted Africa with a white bean. I shall\nnever forget how proud and buoyant he looked as he sailed in with that\nkerosene lamp with a soiled chimney on it, and how hurt and grieved he\nseemed when he took it and groped his way out, while the Coliseum\ntrembled with ill-concealed merriment. I use the term “ill-concealed\nmerriment” with permission of the proprietors, for this season only.",
        "I take occasion at this time to ask the American people as one man, what\nare we to do to prevent the spread of the most insidious and disagreeable\ndisease known as hydrophobia? When a fellow-being has to be smothered, as\nwas the case the other day right here in our fair land, a land where\ntyrant foot hath never trod nor bigot forged a chain, we look anxiously\ninto each other’s faces and inquire, what shall we do?",
        "Shall we go to France at a great expense and fill our systems full of dog\nvirus and then return to our glorious land, where we may fork over that\nvirus to posterity and thus mix up French hydrophobia with the navy-blue\nblood of free-born American citizens?",
        "I wot not.",
        "If I knew that would be my last wot I would not change it. That is just\nwot it would be.",
        "But again.",
        "What shall we do to avoid getting impregnated with the American dog and\nthen saturating our systems with the alien dog of Paris?",
        "It is a serious matter, and if we do not want to play the Desdemona act we\nmust take some timely precautions. What must those precautions be?",
        "Did it ever occur to the average thinking mind that we might squeeze along\nfor weeks without a dog? Whole families have existed for years after being\ndeprived of dogs. Look at the wealthy of our land. They go on comfortably\nthrough life and die at last with the unanimous consent of their heirs\ndogless.",
        "Then why cannot the poor gradually taper off on dogs? They ought not to\nstop all of a sudden, but they could leave off a dog at a time until at\nlast they overcame the pernicious habit.",
        "I saw a man in St. Paul last week who was once poor, and so owned seven\nvariegated dogs. He was confirmed in that habit. But he summoned all his\nwill-power at last and said he would shake off these dogs and become a\nman. He did so, and to-day he owns a city lot in St. Paul, and seems to be\nthe picture of health.",
        "The trouble about maintaining a dog is that he may go on for years in a\nquiet, gentlemanly way, winning the regard of all who know him, and then\nall of a sudden he may hydrophobe in the most violent manner. Not only\nthat, but he may do so while we have company. He may also bite our twins\nor the twins of our warmest friends. He may bite us now and we may laugh\nat it, but in five years from now, while we are delivering a humorous\nlecture, we may burst forth into the audience and bite a beautiful young\nlady in the parquet or on the ear.",
        "It is a solemn thing to think of, fellow-citizens, and I appeal to those\nwho may read this, as a man who may not live to see a satisfactory\npolitical reform–I appeal to you to refrain from the dog. He is purely\nornamental. We may love a good dog, but we ought to love our children\nmore. It would be a very, very noble and expensive dog that I would agree\nto feed with my only son.",
        "I know that we gradually become attached to a good dog, but some day he\nmay become attached to us, and what can be sadder than the sight of a\nleading citizen drawing a reluctant mad dog down the street by main\nstrength and the seat of his pantaloons? (I mean his own, not the dog’s\npants. This joke will appear in book form in April. The book will be very\nreadable, and there will be another joke in it also. eod tf.)",
        "I have said a good deal about the dog, pro and con, and I am not a rabid\ndog abolitionist, for no one loves to have his clear-cut features licked\nby the warm, wet tongue of a noble dog any more than I do, but rather than\nsee hydrophobia become a national characteristic or a leading industry\nhere, I would forego the dog.",
        "Perhaps all men are that way, however. When they get a little forehanded\nthey forget that they were once poor, and owned dogs. If so, I do not wish\nto be unfair. I want to be just, and I believe I am. Let us yield up our\ndogs and take the affection that we would otherwise bestow on them on some\nhuman being. I have tried it and it works well. There are thousands of\npeople in the world, of both sexes, who are pining and starving for the\nlove and money that we daily shower on the dog.",
        "If the dog would be kind enough to refrain from introducing his justly\ncelebrated virus into the person of those only who kiss him on the cold,\nmoist nose, it would be all right; but when a dog goes mad he is very\nimpulsive, and he may bestow himself on an obscure man. So I feel a little\nnervous myself.",
        "Probably few people have been more successful in the discovering line than\nChristopher Columbus. Living as he did in a day when a great many things\nwere still in an undiscovered state, the horizon was filled with golden\nopportunities for a man possessed of Mr. C.’s pluck and ambition. His life\nat first was filled with rebuffs and disappointments, but at last he grew\nto be a man of importance in his own profession, and the people who wanted\nanything discovered would always bring it to him rather than take it\nelsewhere.",
        "And yet the life of Columbus was a stormy one. Though he discovered a\ncontinent wherein a millionaire attracts no attention, he himself was very\npoor.",
        "Though he rescued from barbarism a broad and beautiful land in whose\nmetropolis the theft of less than half a million of dollars is regarded as\npetty larceny, Chris himself often went to bed hungry. Is it not singular\nthat the gray-eyed and gentle Columbus should have added a hemisphere to\nthe history of our globe, a hemisphere, too, where pie is a common thing,\nnot only on Sunday, but throughout the week, and yet that he should have\ngone down to his grave pieless!",

        "Throughout a long and disastrous war, sometimes referred to as a\nfratricidal war, during which this fair land was drenched in blood, and\nalso during which aforesaid war numerous frightful blunders were made\nwhich are fast coming to the surface–through the courtesy of participants\nin said war who have patiently waited for those who blundered to die off,\nand now admit that said participants who are dead did blunder exceedingly\nthroughout all this long and deadly struggle for the supremacy of liberty\nand right–as I was about to say when my mind began to wobble, the\nAmerican pie has shown forth resplendent in the full glare of a noonday\nsun or beneath the pale-green of the electric light, and she stands forth\nproudly to-day with her undying loyalty to dyspepsia untrammeled and her\ndeep and deadly gastric antipathy still fiercely burning in her breast.",
        "That is the proud history of American pie. Powers, principalities,\nkingdoms and hand-made dynasties may crumble, but the republican form of\npie does not crumble. Tyranny may totter on its throne, but the American\npie does not totter. Not a tot. No foreign threat has ever been able to\nmake our common chicken pie quail. I do not say this because it is smart;\nI simply say it to fill up.",
        "But would it not do Columbus good to come among us to-day and look over\nour free institutions? Would it not please him to ride over this continent\nwhich has been rescued by his presence of mind from the thraldom of\nbarbarism and forked over to the genial and refining influences of\nprohibition and pie?",
        "America fills no mean niche in the great history of nations, and if you\nlisten carefully for a few moments you will hear some American, with his\nmouth full of pie, make that remark. The American is always frank and\nperfectly free to state that no other country can approach this one. We\nallow no little two-for-a-quarter monarchy to excel us in the size of our\nfailures or in the calm and self-poised deliberation with which we erect a\nmonument to the glory of a worthy citizen who is dead, and therefore\npolitically useless.",
        "The careless student of the career of Columbus will find much in these\nlines that he has not yet seen. He will realize when he comes to read this\nlittle sketch the pains and the trouble and the research necessary before\nsuch an article on the life and work of Columbus could be written, and he\nwill thank me for it; but it is not for that that I have done it. It is a\npleasure for me to hunt up and arrange historical and biographical data in\na pleasing form for the student and savant. I am only too glad to please\nand gratify the student and the savant.

        "I look upon the appointment, myself, as a great triumph of eternal truth\nover error and wrong. It is one of the epochs, I may say, in the Nation’s\nonward march toward political purity and perfection. I do not know when I\nhave noticed any stride in the affairs of state, which so thoroughly\nimpressed me with its wisdom.",
        "Now that we are co-workers in the same department, I trust that you will\nnot feel shy or backward in consulting me at any time relative to matters\nconcerning postoffice affairs. Be perfectly frank with me, and feel\nperfectly free to just bring anything of that kind right to me. Do not\nfeel reluctant because I may at times appear haughty and indifferent, cold\nor reserved.

        "Early one summer morning a gawky young tenderfoot, both as to the West and\nthe details of journalism, came into the office and asked me for a job as\ncorrespondent to write up the mines in North Park. He wore his hair\nlongish and tried to make it curl. The result was a greasy coat collar and\nthe general tout ensemble of the genus “smart Aleck.” He had also\nclothed himself in the extravagant clothes of the dime novel scout and\nbeautiful girl-rescuer of the Indian country. He had been driven west by a\nwild desire to hunt the flagrant Sioux warrior, and do a general Wild Bill\nbusiness; hoping, no doubt, before the season closed, to rescue enough\nbeautiful captive maidens to get up a young Vassar College in Wyoming or\nMontana.",
        "I told him that we did not care for a mining correspondent who did not\nknow a piece of blossom rock from a geranium. I knew it took a man a good\nmany years to gain knowledge enough to know where to sink a prospect shaft\neven, and as to passing opinions on a vein, it would seem almost wicked\nand sacriligious to send a man out there among those old grizzly miners\nwho had spent their lives in bitter experience, unless the young man could\nreadily distinguish the points of difference between a chunk of free\nmilling quartz and a fragment of bologna sausage.",
        "He still thought he could write us letters that would do the paper some\neternal good, and though I told him, as he wrung my hand and left, to\nrefrain from writing or doing any work for us, he wrote a letter before he\nhad reached the home station on the stage road, or at least sent us a long\nletter from there. It might have been written before he started, however.",
        "The letter was of the “we-have-went” and “I-have-never-saw” variety, and\nhe spelt curiosity “qrossity.” He worked hard to get the word into his\nalleged letter, and then assassinated it.",
        "Well, we paid no attention whatever to the letter, but meantime he got\ninto the mines, and the way he dead-headed feed and sour mash, on the\nstrength of his relations with the press, made the older miners weep.",
        "Buck Bramel got a little worried and wrote to me about it. He said that\nour soft-eyed mining savant was getting us a good many subscribers, and\nwriting up every little gopher hole in North Park, and living on\nCincinnati quail, as we miners call bacon; but he said that none of these\nfine, blooming letters, regarding the assays on “The Weasel Asleep,” “The\nPauper’s Dream,” “The Mary Ellen” and “The Over Draft,” ever seemed to\ncrop out in the paper.",
        "Why was it?",
        "I wrote back that the white-eyed pelican from the buckwheat-enamelled\nplains of Arkansas had not remitted, was not employed by us, and that I\nwould write and publish a little card of introduction for the bilious\nlitterateur that would make people take in their domestic animals, and\nlock up their front fences and garden fountains.",
        "In the meantime they sent him up the gulch to find some “float.” He had\nwandered away from camp thirty miles before he remembered that he didn’t\nknow what float looked like. Then he thought he would go back and inquire.\nHe got lost while in a dark brown study and drifted into the bosom of the\nunknowable. He didn’t miss the trail until a perpendicular wall of the\nRocky Mountains, about 900 feet high, rose up and hit him athwart the\nnose.",
        "He communed with nature and the coyotes one night and had a pretty tough\ntime of it. He froze his nose partially off, and the coyotes came and\ngnawed his little dimpled toes. He passed a wretched night, and was\ngreatly annoyed by the cold, which at that elevation sends the mercury\ntoward zero all through the summer nights.",
        "Of course he pulled the zodiac partially over him, and tried to button his\nalapaca duster a little closer, but his sleep was troubled by the\nsociability of the coyotes and the midnight twitter of the mountain lion.\nHe ate moss agates rare and spruce gum for breakfast. When he got to the\ncamp he looked like a forty-day starvationist hunting for a job.",
        "They asked him if he found any float, and he said he didn’t find a blamed\ndrop of water, say nothing about float, and then they all laughed a merry\nlaugh, and said that if he showed up at daylight the next morning within\nthe limits of the park, the orders were to burn him at the stake.",
        "The next morning neither he nor the best bay mule on the Troublesome was\nto be seen with naked eye. After that we heard of him in the San Juan\ncountry.",
        "He had lacerated the finer feelings of the miners down there, and had\nviolated the etiquette of San Juan, so they kicked a flour barrel out from\nunder him one day when he was looking the other way, and being a poor\ntight-rope performer, he got tangled up with a piece of inch rope in such\na way that he died of his injuries.",
        "In my opinion every professional man should keep a chest of carpenters’\ntools in his barn or shop, and busy himself at odd hours with them in\nconstructing the varied articles that are always needed about the house.\nThere is a great deal of pleasure in feeling your own independence of\nother trades, and more especially of the carpenter. Every now and then\nyour wife will want a bracket put up in some corner or other, and with\nyour new, bright saw and glittering hammer you can put up one upon which\nshe can hang a cast-iron horse-blanket lambrequin, with inflexible water\nlilies sewed in it.",
        "A man will, if he tries, readily learn to do a great many such little\nthings and his wife will brag on him to other ladies, and they will make\ninvidious comparisons between their husbands who can’t do anything of that\nkind whatever, and you who are “so handy.”",
        "Firstly, you buy a set of amateur carpenter tools. You do not need to say\nthat you are an amateur. The dealer will find that out when you ask him\nfor an easy-running broad-ax or a green-gage plumb line. He will sell you\na set of amateur’s tools that will be made of old sheet-iron with basswood\nhandles, and the saws will double up like a piece of stovepipe.",
        "After you have nailed a board on the fence successfully, you will very\nnaturally desire to do something much better, more difficult. You will\nprobable try to erect a parlor table or rustic settee.",
        "I made a very handsome bracket last week, and I was naturally proud of it.\nIn fastening it together, if I hadn’t inadvertently nailed it to the barn\nfloor, I guess I could have used it very well, but in tearing it loose\nfrom the barn, so that the two could be used separately, I ruined a\nbracket that was intended to serve as the base, as it were, of a\nlambrequin which cost nine dollars, aside from the time expended on it.",
        "During the month of March I built an ice-chest for this summer. It was not\nhandsome, but it was roomy, and would be very nice for the season of 1886,\nI thought. It worked pretty well through March and April, but as the\nweather begins to warm up that ice-chest is about the warmest place around\nthe house. There is actually a glow of heat around that ice-chest that I\ndon’t notice elsewhere. I’ve shown it to several personal friends. They\nseem to think it is not built tightly enough for an ice-chest. My brother\nlooked at it yesterday, and said that his idea of an ice-chest was that it\nought to be tight enough at least to hold the larger chunks of ice so that\nthey would not escape through the pores of the ice-box. He says he never\nbuilt one, but that it stood to reason that a refrigerator like that ought\nto be constructed so that it would keep the cows out of it. You don’t want\nto have a refrigerator that the cattle can get through the cracks of and\neat up your strawberries on ice, he says.",
        "A neighbor of mine who once built a hen resort of laths, and now wears a\nthick thumb-nail that looks like a Brazil nut as a memento of that pullet\ncorral, says my ice-chest is all right enough, only that it is not suited\nto this climate. He thinks that along Behring’s Strait, during the\nholidays, my ice-chest would work like a charm. And even here, he thought,\nif I could keep the fever out of my chest there would be less pain.",
        "I have made several other little articles of vertu this spring, to the\nconstruction of which I have contributed a good deal of time and two\nfinger nails. I have also sawed into my leg two or three times. The leg,\nof course, will get well, but the pantaloons will not. Parties wishing to\nmeet me in my studio during the morning hour will turn into the alley\nbetween Eighth and Ninth streets, enter the third stable door on the left,\npass around behind my Gothic horse, and give the countersign and three\nkicks on the door in an ordinary tone of voice.",
        "I am convinced that there is great economy in keeping hens if we have\nsufficient room for them and a thorough knowledge of how to manage the\nfowl property. But to the professional man, who is not familiar with the\nhabits of the hen, and whose mind does not naturally and instinctively\nturn henward, I would say: Shun her as you would the deadly upas tree of\nPiscataquis county, Me.",
        "Nature has endowed the hen with but a limited amount of brain-force. Any\none will notice that if he will compare the skull of the average self-made\nhen with that of Daniel Webster, taking careful measurements directly over\nthe top from one ear to the other, the well-informed brain student will at\nonce notice a great falling-off in the region of reverence and an abnormal\nbulging out in the location of alimentiveness.",
        "Now take your tape-measure and, beginning at memory, pass carefully over\nthe occiputal bone to the base of the brain in the region of love of home\nand offspring and you will see that, while the hen suffers much in\ncomparison with the statement in the relative size of sublimity,\nreflection, spirituality, time, tune, etc., when it comes to love of home\nand offspring she shines forth with great splendor.",
        "The hen does not care for the sublime in nature. Neither does she care for\nmusic. Music hath no charms to soften her tough old breast. But she loves\nher home and her country. I have sought to promote the interests of the\nhen to some extent, but I have not been a marked success in that line.",
        "I can write a poem in fifteen minutes. I always could dash off a poem\nwhenever I wanted to, and a very good poem, too, for a dashed poem. I\ncould write a speech for a friend in congress–a speech that would be\nprinted in the Congressional Record and go all over the United States and\nbe read by no one. I could enter the field of letters anywhere and attract\nattention, but when it comes to setting a hen I feel that I am not worthy.\nI never feel my utter unworthiness as I do in the presence of a setting\nhen.",
        "When the adult hen in my presence expresses a desire to set I excuse\nmyself and go away. That is the supreme moment when a hen desires to be\nalone. That is no time for me to introduce my shallow levity, I never do\nit is after death that I most fully appreciate the hen. When she has\nbeen cut down early in life and fried I respect her. No one can look upon\nthe still features of a young hen overtaken by death in life’s young\nmorning, snuffed out as it were, like an old tin lantern in a gale of\nwind, without being visibly affected.",
        "But it is not the hen who desires to set for the purpose of getting out an\nearly edition of spring chickens that I am averse to. It is the aged hen,\nwho is in her dotage, and whose eggs, also, are in their second childhood.\nUpon this hen I shower my anathemas. Overlooked by the pruning hook of\ntime, shallow in her remarks, and a wall-flower in society, she deposits\nher quota of eggs in the catnip conservatory, far from the haunts of men,\nand then in August, when eggs are extremely low and her collection of no\nvalue to any one but the antiquarian, she proudly calls attention to her\nsummer’s work.",
        "This hen does not win the general confidence. Shunned by good society\nduring life, her death is only regretted by those who are called upon to\nassist at her obsequies. Selfish through life, her death is regarded as a\ncalamity by those alone who are expected to eat her.",
        "And what has such a hen to look back upon in her closing hours? A long\nlife, perhaps, for longevity is one of the characteristics of this class\nof hens; but of what has that life been productive? How many golden hours\nhas she frittered away hovering over a porcelain door-knob trying to hatch\nout a litter of Queen Anne cottages. How many nights has she passed in\nsolitude on her lonely nest, with a heart filled with bitterness toward\nall mankind, hoping on against hope that in the fall she would come off\nthe nest with a cunning little brick block, perhaps.",
        "Such is the history of the aimless hen. While others were at work she\nstood around with her hands in her pockets and criticised the policy of\nthose who labored, and when the summer waned she came forth with nothing\nbut regret to wander listlessly about and freeze off some more of her feet\nduring the winter. For such a hen death can have no terrors.",
        "We had about as ornery and triflin’ a crop of kids in Calaveras county,\nthirty years ago, as you could gather in with a fine-tooth comb and a\nbrass band in fourteen States. For ways that was kittensome they were\nmoderately active and abnormally protuberant. That was the prevailing\nstyle of Calaveras kid, when Mr. George W. Mulqueen come there and wanted\nto engage the school at the old camp, where I hung up in the days when the\ncountry was new and the murmur of the six-shooter was heard in the land.",
        "“George W. Mulqueen was a slender young party from the effete East, with\nconscientious scruples and a hectic flush. Both of these was agin him for\na promoter of school discipline and square root. He had a heap of\ninformation and big sorrowful eyes.",
        "“So fur as I was concerned, I didn’t feel like swearing around George or\nusing any language that would sound irrelevant in a ladies’ boodore; but\nas for the kids of the school, they didn’t care a blamed cent. They just\nhollered and whooped like a passle of Sioux.",
        "“They didn’t seem to respect literary attainments or expensive knowledge.\nThey just simply seemed to respect the genius that come to that country to\nwin their young love with a long-handled shovel and a blood-shot tone of\nvoice. That’s what seemed to catch the Calaveras kids in the early days.",
        "“George had weak lungs, and they kept to work at him till they drove him\ninto a mountain fever, and finally into a metallic sarcophagus.",
        "“Along about the holidays the sun went down on George W. Mulqueen’s life,\njust as the eternal sunlight lit up the dewy eyes. You will pardon my\nmanner, Nye, but it seemed to me just as if George had climbed up to the\ntop of Mount Cavalry, or wherever it was, with that whole school on his\nback, and had to give up at last.",
        "“It seemed kind of tough to me, and I couldn’t help blamin’ it onto the\nschool some, for there was a half a dozen big snoozers that didn’t go to\nschool to learn, but just to raise Ned and turn up Jack.",
        "“Well, they killed him, anyhow, and that settled it.",
        "“The school run kind of wild till Feboowary, and then a husky young\ntenderfoot, with a fist like a mule’s foot in full bloom, made an\napplication for the place, and allowed he thought he could maintain\ndiscipline if they’d give him a chance. Well, they ast him when he wanted\nto take his place as tutor, and he reckoned he could begin to tute about\nMonday follering.",
        "“Sunday afternoon he went up to the school-house to look over the ground,\nand to arrange a plan for an active Injin campaign agin the hostile\nhoodlums of Calaveras.",
        "“Monday he sailed in about 9 A.M. with his grip-sack, and begun the\ndischarge of his juties.",
        "“He brought in a bunch of mountain-willers, and, after driving a big\nrailroad-spike into the door-casing, over the latch, he said the senate\nand house would sit with closed doors during the morning session. Several\nlarge, white-eyed holy terrors gazed at him in a kind of dumb, inquiring\ntone of voice, but he didn’t say much. He seemed considerably reserved as\nto the plan of the campaign. The new teacher then unlocked his\nalligator-skin grip, and took out a Bible and a new self-cocking weepon\nthat had an automatic dingus for throwing out the empty shells. It was one\nof the bull-dog variety, and had the laugh of a joyous child.",
        "“He read a short passage from the Scriptures, and then pulled off his coat\nand hung it on a nail. Then he made a few extemporaneous remarks, after\nwhich he salivated the palm of his right hand, took the self-cocking\nsongster in his left, and proceeded to wear out the gads over the varied\nprotuberances of his pupils.",
        "“People passing by thought they must be beating carpets in the\nschool-house. He pointed the gun at his charge with his left and\nmanipulated the gad with his right duke. One large, overgrown Missourian\ntried to crawl out of the winder, but, after he had looked down the barrel\nof the shooter a moment, he changed his mind. He seemed to realize that it\nwould be a violation of the rules of the school, so he came back and sat\ndown.",
        "“After he wore out the foliage, Bill, he pulled the spike out of that\ndoor, put on his coat and went away. He never was seen there again. He\ndidn’t ask for any salary, but just walked off quietly, and that summer we\naccidently heard that he was George W. Mulqueen’s brother.”",
        "I have just returned from a polite and recherche party here. Washington is\nthe hot-bed of gayety, and general headquarters for the recherche\nbusiness. It would be hard to find a bontonger aggregation than the one I\nwas just at, to use the words of a gentleman who was there, and who asked\nme if I wrote “The Heathen Chinee.”",
        "He was a very talented man, with a broad sweep of skull and a vague\nyearning for something more tangible–to drink. He was in Washington, he\nsaid, in the interests of Mingo county. I forgot to ask him where Mingo\ncounty might be. He took a great interest in me, and talked with me long\nafter he really had anything to say. He was one of those fluent\nconversationalists frequently met with in society. He used one of these\nweb-perfecting talkers–the kind that can be fed with raw Roman punch,\nand that will turn out punctuated talk in links, like varnished sausages.\nBeing a poor talker myself, and rather more fluent as a listener, I did\nnot interrupt him.",
        "He said that he was sorry to notice how young girls and their parents came\nto Washington as they would to a matrimonial market.",
        "I was sorry also to hear it. It pained me to know that young ladies should\nallow themselves to be bamboozled into matrimony. Why was it, I asked,\nthat matrimony should ever single out the young and fair?",
        "“Ah,” said he, “it is indeed rough!”",
        "He then breathed a sigh that shook the foilage of the speckled geranium\nnear by, and killed an artificial caterpillar that hung on its branches.",
        "“Matrimony is all right,” said he, “if properly brought about. It breaks\nmy heart, though, to notice how Washington is used as a matrimonial\nmarket. It seems to me almost as if these here young ladies were brought\nhere like slaves and exposed for sale.” I had noticed that they were\nsomewhat exposed, but I did not know that they were for sale. I asked him\nif the waists of party dresses had always been so sadly in the minority,\nand he said they had.",
        "I danced with a beautiful young lady whose trail had evidently caught in a\ndoorway. She hadn’t noticed it till she had walked out partially through\nher costume.",
        "I do not think a lady ought to give too much thought to her apparel;\nneither should she feel too much above her clothes. I say this in the\nkindest spirit, because I believe that man should be a friend to woman. No\nfamily circle is complete without a woman. She is like a glad landscape to\nthe weary eye. Individually and collectively, woman is a great adjunct of\ncivilization and progress. The electric light is a good thing, but how\npale and feeble it looks by the light of a good woman’s eyes. The\ntelephone is a great invention. It is a good thing to talk at, and murmur\ninto and deposit profanity in; but to take up a conversation, and keep it\nup, and follow a man out through the front door with it, the telephone has\nstill much to learn from woman.",
        "It is said that our government officials are not sufficiently paid; and I\npresume that is the case, so it became necessary to economize in every\nway; but, why should wives concentrate all their economy on the waist of a\ndress? When chest protectors are so cheap as they now are. I hate to see\npeople suffer, and there is more real suffering, more privation and more\ndestitution, pervading the Washington scapula and clavicle this winter\nthan I ever saw before.",
        "But I do not hope to change this custom, though I spoke to several ladies\nabout it, and asked them to think it over. I do not think they will. It\nseems almost wicked to cut off the best part of a dress and put it at the\nother end of the skirt, to be trodden under feet of men, as I may say.\nThey smiled good humoredly at me as I tried to impress my views upon them,\nbut should I go there again next season and mingle in the mad whirl of\nWashington, where these fair women are also mingling in said mad whirl, I\npresume that I will find them clothed in the same gaslight waist, with\ntrimmings of real vertebrae down the back.",
        "Still, what does a man know about the proper costume of a woman? He knows\nnothing whatever. He is in many ways a little inconsistent. Why does a man\nfrown on a certain costume for his wife, and admire it on the first woman\nhe meets? Why does he fight shy of religion and Christianity and talk very\nfreely about the church, but get mad if his wife is an infidel?",
        "Crops around Washington are looking well. Winter wheat, crocusses and\nindefinite postponements were never in a more thrifty condition. Quite a\nnumber of people are here who are waiting to be confirmed. Judging from\ntheir habits, they are lingering around here in order to become confirmed\ndrunkards.",
        "I leave here to-morrow with a large, wet towel in my plug hat. Perhaps I\nshould have said nothing on this dress reform question while my hat is\nfitting me so immediately. It is seldom that I step aside from the beaten\npath of rectitude, but last evening, on the way home, it seemed to me that\nI didn’t do much else but step aside. At these parties no charge is made\nfor punch. It is perfectly free. I asked a colored man who was standing\nnear the punch bowl, and who replenished it ever and anon, what the damage\nwas, and he drew himself up to his full height.",
        "Possibly I did wrong, but I hate to be a burden on anyone. It seemed odd\nto me to go to a first-class dance and find the supper and the band and\nthe rum all paid for. It must cost a good deal of money to run this\ngovernment.",
        "During the past season I was considerably interested in agriculture. I met\nwith some success, but not enough to madden me with joy. It takes a good\ndeal of success to unscrew my reason and make it totter on its throne.\nI’ve had trouble with my liver, and various other abnormal conditions of\nthe vital organs, but old reason sits there on his or her throne, as the\ncase may be, through it all.",
        "Agriculture has a charm about it which I can not adequately describe.\nEvery product of the farm is furnished by nature with something that loves\nit, so that it will never be neglected. The grain crop is loved by the\nweevil, the Hessian fly, and the chinch bug; the watermelon, the squash\nand the cucumber are loved by the squash bug; the potato is loved by the\npotato bug; the sweet corn is loved by the ant, thou sluggard; the tomato\nis loved by the cut-worm; the plum is loved by the curculio, and so forth,\nand so forth, so that no plant that grows need be a wall-flower. [Early\nblooming and extremely dwarf joke for the table. Plant as soon as there is\nno danger of frosts, in drills four inches apart. When ripe, pull it, and\neat raw with vinegar. The red ants may be added to taste.]",
        "Well, I began early to spade up my angle-worms and other pets, to see if\nthey had withstood the severe winter. I found they had. They were\nunusually bright and cheerful. The potato bugs were a little sluggish at\nfirst, but as the spring opened and the ground warmed up they pitched\nright in, and did first-rate. Every one of my bugs in May looked\nsplendidly. I was most worried about my cut-worms. Away along in April I\nhad not seen a cutworm, and I began to fear they had suffered, and perhaps\nperished, in the extreme cold of the previous winter.",
        "One morning late in the month, however, I saw a cut-worm come out from\nbehind a cabbage stump and take off his ear muff. He was a little stiff in\nthe joints, but he had not lost hope. I saw at once now was the time to\nassist him if I had a spark of humanity left. I searched every work I\ncould find on agriculture to find out what it was that farmers fed their\nblamed cut-worms, but all scientists seemed to be silent. I read the\nagricultural reports, the dictionary, and the encyclopedia, but they\ndidn’t throw any light on the subject. I got wild. I feared that I had\nbrought but one cut-worm through the winter, and I was liable to lose him\nunless I could find out what to feed him. I asked some of my neighbors,\nbut they spoke jeeringly and sarcastically. I know now how it was. All\ntheir cut-worms had frozen down last winter, and they couldn’t bear to see\nme get ahead.",
        "All at once, an idea struck me. I haven’t recovered from the concussion\nyet. It was this: the worm had wintered under a cabbage stalk; no doubt he\nwas fond of the beverage. I acted upon this thought and bought him two\ndozen red cabbage plants, at fifty cents a dozen. I had hit it the first\npop. He was passionately fond of these plants, and would eat three in one\nnight. He also had several matinees and sauerkraut lawn festivals for his\nfriends, and in a week I bought three dozen more cabbage plants. By this\ntime I had collected a large group of common scrub cut-worms, early\nSwedish cut-worms, dwarf Hubbard cut-worms, and short-horn cut-worms, all\ndoing well, but still, I thought, a little hide-bound and bilious. They\nacted languid and listless. As my squash bugs, currant worms, potato bugs,\netc., were all doing well without care, I devoted myself almost\nexclusively to my cut-worms. They were all strong and well, but they\nseemed melancholy with nothing to eat, day after day, but cabbages.",
        "I therefore bought five dozen tomato plants that were tender and large.\nThese I fed to the cut-worms at the rate of eight or ten in one night. In\na week the cut-worms had thrown off that air of ennui and languor that I\nhad I formerly noticed, and were gay and light-hearted. I got them some\nmore tomato plants, and then some more cabbage for change. On the whole I\nwas as proud as any young farmer who has made a success of anything,",
        "One morning I noticed that a cabbage plant was left standing unchanged.\nThe next day it was still there. I was thunderstruck. I dug into the\nground. My cut-worms were gone. I spaded up the whole patch, but there\nwasn’t one. Just as I had become attached to them, and they had learned to\nlook forward each day to my coming, when they would almost come up and eat\na tomato-plant out of my hand, some one had robbed me of them. I was\nalmost wild with despair and grief. Suddenly something tumbled over my\nfoot. It was mostly stomach, but it had feet on each corner. A neighbor\nsaid it was a warty toad. He had eaten up my summer’s work! He had\nswallowed my cunning little cut-worms. I tell you, gentle reader, unless\nsome way is provided, whereby this warty toad scourge can be wiped out, I\nfor one shall relinquish the joys of agricultural pursuits. When a common\ntoad, with a sallow complexion and no intellect, can swallow up my\nsummer’s work, it is time to pause.",
        "This autograph business is getting to be a little bit tedious. It is all\none-sided. I want to get even some how, on some one. If I can’t come back\nat the autograph fiend himself, perhaps I might make some other fellow\ncreature unhappy. That would take my mind off the woes that are inflicted\nby the man who is making a collection of the autographs of “prominent\nmen,” and who sends a printed circular formally demanding your autograph,\nas the tax collector would demand your tax.",
        "John Comstock, the President of the First National Bank, of Hudson, the\nother day suggested an idea. I gave him an autograph copy of my last great\nwork, and he said: “Now, I’m a man of business. You gave me your\nautograph, I give you mine in return. That’s what we call business.” He\nthen signed a brand new $5 national bank note, the cashier did ditto, and\nthe two autographs were turned over to me.",
        "Now, how would it do to make a collection of the signatures of the\npresidents and cashiers of national banks of the United States in the\nabove manner? An album containing the autographs of these bank officials\nwould not only be a handsome heirloom to fork over to posterity, but it\nwould possess intrinsic value. In pursuance of this idea, I have been\nconsidering the advisability of issuing the following letter:",
        "To the Presidents and Cashiers of the National Banks of the United States.",
        "Gentlemen–I am now engaged in making a collection of the autographs of\nthe presidents and cashiers of national banks throughout the Union, and to\nmake the collection uniform, I have decided to ask for autographs written\nat the foot of the national currency bank note of the denomination of $5.\nI am not sectarian in my religious views, and I only suggest this\ndenomination for the sake of uniformity throughout the album.",
        "Card collections, cat albums and so forth, may please others, but I prefer\nto make a collection that shall show future ages who it was that built up\nour finances, and furnished the sinews of war. Some may look upon this\nmove as a mercenary one, but with me it is a passion. It is not simply a\nfreak, it is a desire of my heart.",
        "In return I would be glad to give my own autograph, either by itself or\nattached to some little gem of thought which might occur to my mind at the\ntime.",
        "I have always taken a great interest in the currency of the country. So\nfar as possible I have made it a study. I have watched its growth, and\nnoted with some regret its natural reserve. I may say that, considering\nmeagre opportunities and isolated advantages afforded me, no one is more\nfamiliar with the habits of our national currency than I am. Yet, at times\nmy laboratory has not been so abundantly supplied with specimens as I\ncould have wished. This has been my chief drawback.",
        "I began a collection of railroad passes some time ago, intending to file\nthem away and pass the collection down through the dim vista of coming\nyears, but in a rash moment I took a trip of several thousand miles, and\nthose passes were taken up.",
        "I desire, in conclusion, gentlemen, to call your attention to the fact\nthat I have always been your friend and champion. I have never robbed the\nbank of a personal friend, and if I held your autographs I should deem you\nmy personal friends, and feel in honor bound to discourage any movement\nlooking toward an unjust appropriation of the funds of your bank. The\nautographs of yourselves in my possession, and my own in your hands, would\nbe regarded as a tacit agreement on my part never to rob your bank. I\nwould even be willing to enter into a contract with you not to break into\nyour vaults, if you insist upon it. I would thus be compelled to confine\nmyself to the stage coaches and railroad trains in a great measure, but I\nam getting now so I like to spend my evenings at home, anyhow, and if I do\nwell this year, I shall sell my burglars’ tools and give myself up to the\nauthorities.",
        "You will understand, gentlemen, the delicate nature of this request, I\ntrust, and not misconstrue my motives. My intentions are perfectly\nhonorable, and my idea in doing this is, I may say, to supply a long felt\nwant.",
        "Hoping that what I have said will meet with your approval and hearty\ncooperation, and that our very friendly business relations, as they have\nexisted in the past, may continue through the years to come, and that your\nbank may wallow in success till the cows come home, or words to that\neffect, I beg leave to subscribe myself, yours in favor of one country,\none flag and one bank account.",

At the time I entered upon the\nduties of my office the department was not yet on a paying basis. It was\nnot even self-sustaining. Since that time, with the active co-operation of\nthe chief executive and the heads of the department, I have been able to\nmake our postal system a paying one, and on top of that I am now able to\nreduce the tariff on average-sized letters from three cents to two. I\nmight add that this is rather too too, but I will not say anything that\nmight seem undignified in an official resignation which is to become a\nmatter of history.",

Hatton, a year ago, I removed the feather\nbed with which my predecessor, Deacon Hayford, had bolstered up his\nadministration by stuffing the window, and substituted glass. Finding\nnothing in the book of instructions to postmasters which made the feather\nbed a part of my official duties, I filed it away in an obscure place and\nburned it in effigy, also in the gloaming. This act maddened my\npredecessor to such a degree, that he then and there became a candidate\nfor justice of the peace on the Democratic ticket. The Democratic party\nwas able, however, with what aid it secured from the Republicans, to plow\nthe old man under to a great degree.",
        "It was not long after I had taken my official oath before an era of\nunexampled prosperity opened for the American people. The price of beef\nrose to a remarkable altitude, and other vegetables commanded a good\nfigure and a ready market. We then began to make active preparations for\nthe introduction of the strawberry-roan two-cent stamps and the\nblack-and-tan postal note. One reform has crowded upon the heels of\nanother, until the country is to-day upon the foam-crested wave of\npermanent prosperity.",
        "Mr. President, I cannot close this letter without thanking yourself and\nthe heads of departments at Washington for your active, cheery and prompt\ncooperation in these matters. You can do as you see fit, of course, about\nincorporating this idea into your Thanksgiving proclamation, but rest\nassured it would not be ill-timed or inopportune. It is not alone a credit\nto myself, It reflects credit upon the administration also.",
        "I need not say that I herewith transmit my resignation with great sorrow\nand genuine regret. We have toiled on together month after month, asking\nfor no reward except the innate consciousness of rectitude and the salary\nas fixed by law. Now we are to separate. Here the roads seem to fork, as\nit were, and you and I, and the cabinet, must leave each other at this\npoint.",

        "Mr. President, as an official of this Government I now retire. My term of\noffice would not expire until 1886. I must, therefore, beg pardon for my\neccentricity in resigning.

The results have\nshown that disease is not alone the heritage of the wealthy and the great.\nThe poorest of us may become eminent invalids if we will only go at it in\nthe right way.

Mr. Gladstone has given us the graduated scale, so that we\nknow just what metre a bill of fare goes in as quick as we look at it. In\nthis way the day is not far distant when music and mastication will march\ndown through the dim vista of years together.",
        "The Baked Bean Chant, the Vermicelli Waltz, the Mush and Milk March, the\nsad and touchful Pumpkin Pie Refrain, the gay and rollicking Oxtail Soup\nGallop, and the melting Ice Cream Serenade will yet be common musical\nnames.",

Space, of course, forbids an extended\ndescription of this idea as I propose to carry it out, but the conception\nis certainly grand.

        "The history of Babylon is fraught with sadness. It illustrates, only too\npainfully, that the people of a town make or mar its success rather than\nthe natural resources and advantages it may possess on the start.",
        "Thus Babylon, with 3,000 years the start of Minneapolis, is to-day a hole\nin the ground, while Minneapolis socks her XXXX flour into every corner of\nthe globe, and the price of real estate would make a common dynasty totter\non its throne.",
        "Babylon is a good illustration of the decay of a town that does not keep\nup with the procession. Compare her to-day with Kansas City. While Babylon\nwas the capital of Chaldea, 1,270 years before the birth of Christ, and\nKansas City was organized so many years after that event that many of the\npeople there have forgotten all about it, Kansas City has doubled her\npopulation in ten years, while Babylon is simply a gothic hole in the\nground.",
        "Why did trade and emigration turn their backs upon Babylon and seek out\nMinneapolis, St. Paul, Kansas City and Omaha? Was it because they were\nblest with a bluer sky or a more genial sun? Not by any means. While\nBabylon lived upon what she had been and neglected to advertise, other\ntowns with no history extending back into the mouldy past, whooped with an\nexceeding great whoop and tore up the ground and shed printers’ ink and\nshowed marked signs of vitality. That is the reason that Babylon is no\nmore.",
        "This life of ours is one of intense activity. We cannot rest long in\nidleness without inviting forgetfulness, death and oblivion. “Babylon was\nprobably the largest and most magnificent city of the ancient world.\"\nIsaiah, who lived about 300 years before Herodotus, and whose remarks are\nunusually free from local or political prejudice, refers to Babylon as\n\"the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldic’s excellency,” and, yet,\nwhile Cheyenne has the electric light and two daily papers, Babylon hasn’t\ngot so much as a skating rink.",
        "A city fourteen miles square with a brick wall around it 355 feet high,\nshe has quietly forgotten to advertise, and in turn she, also, is\nforgotten.",
        "Babylon was remarkable for the two beautiful palaces, one on each side of\nthe river, and the great temple of Belus. Connected with one of these\npalaces was the hanging garden, regarded by the Greeks as one of the seven\nwonders of the world, but that was prior to the erection of the Washington\nmonument and civil service reform.",
        "This was a square of 400 Greek feet on each side. The Greek foot was not\nso long as the modern foot introduced by Miss Mills, of Ohio. This garden\nwas supported on several tiers of open arches, built one over the other,\nlike the walls of a classic theatre, and sustaining at each stage, or\nstory, a solid platform from which the arches of the next story sprung.\nThis structure was also supported by the common council of Babylon, who\ncame forward with the city funds, and helped to sustain the immense\nweight.",
        "It is presumed that Nebuchadnezzar erected this garden before his mind\nbecame affected. The tower of Belus, supposed by historians with a good\nmemory to have been 600 feet high, as there is still a red chalk mark in\nthe sky where the top came, was a great thing in its way. I am glad I was\nnot contiguous to it when it fell, and also that I had omitted being born\nprior to that time.",
        "“When we turn from this picture of the past,” says the historian,\nRawlinson, referring to the beauties of Babylon, “to contemplate the\npresent condition of these localities, we are at first struck with\nastonishment at the small traces which remain of so vast and wonderful a\nmetropolis. The broad walls of Babylon are utterly broken down. God has\nswept it with the besom of destruction.”",
        "One cannot help wondering why the use of the besom should have been\nabandoned. As we gaze upon the former site of Babylon we are forced to\nadmit that the new besom sweeps clean. On its old site no crumbling arches\nor broken columns are found to indicate her former beauty. Here and there\nhuge heaps of debris alone indicate that here Godless wealth and wicked,\nselfish, indolent, enervating, ephemeral pomp, rose and defied the supreme\nlaws to which the bloated, selfish millionaire and the hard-handed, hungry\nlaborer alike must bow, and they are dust to-day.",
        "Babylon has fallen. I do not say this in a sensational way or to\ndepreciate the value of real estate there, but from actual observation,\nand after a full investigation, I assent without fear of successful\ncontradiction, that Babylon has seen her best days. Her boomlet is busted,\nand, to use a political phrase, her oriental hide is on the Chaldean\nfence.",
        "Such is life. We enter upon it reluctantly; we wade through it doubtfully,\nand die at last timidly. How we Americans do blow about what we can do\nbefore breakfast, and, yet, even in our own brief history, how we have\ndemonstrated what a little thing the common two-legged man is. He rises up\nrapidly to acquire much wealth, and if he delays about going to Canada he\ngoes to Sing Sing, and we forget about him. There are lots of modern\nBabylonians in New York City to-day, and if it were my business I would\ncall their attention to it. The assertion that gold will procure all\nthings has been so common and so popular that too many consider first the\nbank account, and after that honor, home, religion, humanity and common\ndecency. Even some of the churches have fallen into the notion that first\ncomes the tall church, then the debt and mortgage, the ice cream sociable\nand the kingdom of Heaven. Cash and Christianity go hand in hand\nsometimes, but Christianity ought not to confer respectability on anybody\nwho comes into the church to purchase it.",
        "I often think of the closing appeal of the old preacher, who was more\nearnest than refined, perhaps, and in winding up his brief sermon on the\nChristian life, said: “A man may lose all his wealth and get poor and\nhungry and still recover, he may lose his health and come down close to\nthe dark stream and still git well again, but, when he loses his immortal\nsoul it is good-bye John.”",
        "I dropped in the other day to see New York’s great congress of wax figures\nand soft statuary carnival. It is quite a success. The first thing you do\non entering is to contribute to the pedestal fund. New York this spring is\nmostly a large rectangular box with a hole in the top, through which the\ngenial public is cordially requested to slide a dollar to give the goddess\nof liberty a boom.",

I never\nvisited a town that offered so many inducements for early and judicious\ninvestments as New York.",
        "But we were speaking of the wax works. I did not tarry long to notice the\npresidents of the United States embalmed in wax, or to listen to the band\nof lutists who furnished music in the winter garden. I ascertained where\nthe chamber of horrors was located, and went there at once. It is lovely.\nI have never seen a more successful aggregation of horrors under one roof\nand at one price of admission.",
        "If you want to be shocked at cost, or have your pores opened for a merely\nnominal price, and see a show that you will never forget as long as you\nlive, that is the place to find it. I never invested my money so as to get\nso large a return for it, because I frequently see the whole show yet in\nthe middle of the night, and the cold perspiration ripples down my spinal\ncolumn just as it did the first time I saw it.",
        "The chamber of horrors certainly furnishes a very durable show. I don’t\nthink I was ever more successfully or economically horrified.",
        "I got quite nervous after a while, standing in the dim religious light\nwatching the lovely horrors. But it is the saving of money that I look at\nmost. I have known men to pay out thousands of dollars for a collection of\ndelirium tremens and new-laid horrors no better than these that you get on\nweek days for fifty cents and on Sundays for two bits. Certainly New York\nis the place where you get your money’s worth.",
        "There are horrors there in that crypt that are well worth double the price\nof admission. One peculiarity of the chamber of horrors is that you\nfinally get nervous when anyone touches you, and you immediately suspect\nthat he is a horror who has come out of his crypt to get a breath of fresh\nair and stretch his legs.",
        "That is the reason I shuddered a little when I felt a man’s hand in my\npocket. It was so unexpected, and the surroundings were such that I must\nhave appeared startled. The man was a stranger to me, though I could see\nthat he was a perfect gentleman. His clothes were superior to mine in\nevery way, and he had a certain refinement of manners which betrayed his\nill-concealed Knickerbocker lineage high.",
        "I said, “Sir, you will find my fine cut tobacco in the other pocket.” This\nstartled him so that he wheeled about and wildly dashed into the arms of a\nwax policeman near the door. When he discovered that he was in the\nclutches of a suit of second-hand clothes filled with wax, he seemed to be\ngreatly annoyed and strode rapidly away.",
        "I returned to view a chaste and truthful scene where one man had\nsuccessfully killed another with a club. I leaned pensively against a\ncolumn with my own spinal column, wrapped in thought.",
        "Pretty soon a young gentleman from New Jersey with an Adam’s apple on him\nlike a full-grown yam, and accompanied by a young lady also from the\nmosquito jungles of Jersey, touched me on the bosom with his umbrella and\nbegan to explain me to his companion.",
        "“This,” said the Adam’s apple with the young man attached to it, “is Jesse\nJames, the great outlaw chief from Missouri. How life-like he is. Little\nwould you think, Emeline, that he would as soon disembowel a bank, kill the\nentire board of directors of a railroad company and ride off the rolling\nstock, as you would wrap yourself around a doughnut. How tender and kind\nhe looks. He not only looks gentle and peaceful, but he looks to me as if\nhe wasn’t real bright.”",
        "I then uttered a piercing shriek and the young man from New Jersey went\naway. Nothing is so embarrassing to an eminent man as to stand quietly\nnear and hear people discuss him.",
        "But it is remarkable to see people get fooled at a wax show. Every day a\nwax figure is taken for a live man, and live people are mistaken for wax.\nI took hold of a waxen hand in one corner of the winter garden to see if\nthe ring was a real diamond, and it flew up and took me across the ear in\nsuch a life-like manner that my ear is still hot and there is a roaring in\nmy head that sounds very disagreeable, indeed.",
        "A “Family Physician,” published in 1883, says, for the bite of a mad dog:\n\"Take ash-colored ground liverwort, cleaned, dried, and powdered, half an\nounce; of black pepper, powdered, a quarter of an ounce. Mix these well\ntogether, and divide the powder into four doses, one of which must be\ntaken every morning, fasting, for four mornings successively in half an\nEnglish pint of cow’s milk, warm. After these four doses are taken, the\npatient must go into the cold bath, or a cold spring or river, every\nmorning, fasting, for a month. He must be dipped all over, but not stay in\n(with his head above water) longer than half a minute if the water is very\ncold. After this he must go in three times a week for a fortnight longer.\nHe must be bled before he begins to take the medicine.”",
        "It is very difficult to know just what is best to do when a person is\nbitten by a mad dog, but my own advice would be to kill the dog. After\nthat feel of the leg where bitten, and ascertain how serious the injury\nhas been. Then go home and put on another pair of pantaloons, throwing\naway those that have been lacerated. Parties having but one pair of\npantaloons will have to sequester themselves or excite remarks. Then take\na cold bath, as suggested above, but do not remain in the bath (with the\nhead above water) more than half an hour. If the head is under water, you\nmay remain in the bath until the funeral, if you think best.",
        "When going into the bath it would be well to take something in your pocket\nto bite, in case the desire to bite something should overcome you. Some\nuse a common shingle-nail for this purpose, while others prefer a personal\nfriend. In any event, do not bite a total stranger on an empty stomach. It\nmight make you ill.",
        "Never catch a dog by the tail if he has hydrophobia. Although that end of\nthe dog is considered the most safe, you never know when a mad dog may\nreverse himself.",
        "If you meet a mad dog on the street, do not stop and try to quell him with\na glance of the eye. Many have tried to do that, and it took several days\nto separate the two and tell which was mad dog and which was queller.",
        "The real hydrophobia dog generally ignores kindness, and devotes himself\nmostly to the introduction of his justly celebrated virus. A good thing to\ndo on observing the approach of a mad dog is to flee, and remain fled\nuntil he has disappeared.",
        "Hunting mad dogs in a crowded street is great sport. A young man with a\nnew revolver shooting at a mad dog is a fine sight. He may not kill the\ndog, but he might shoot into a covey of little children and possibly get\none.",
        "It would be a good plan to have a balloon inflated and tied in the back\nyard during the season in which mad dogs mature, and get into it on the\napproach of the infuriated animal (get into the balloon, I mean, not the\ndog).",
        "This plan would not work well, however, in case a cyclone should come at\nthe same time. When we consider all the uncertainties of life, and the\ndanger from hydrophobia, cyclones and breach of promise, it seems\nsometimes as though the penitentiary was the only place where a man could\nbe absolutely free from anxiety.",
        "If you discover that your dog has hydrophobia, it is absolutely foolish to\ntry to cure him of the disease. The best plan is to trade him off at once\nfor anything you can get. Do not stop to haggle over the price, but close\nhim right out below cost.",
        "Do not tie a tin can to the tail of a mad dog. It only irritates him, and\nhe might resent it before you get the can tied on. A friend of mine, who\nwas a practical joker, once sought to tie a tin can to the tail of a mad\ndog on an empty stomach. His widow still points with pride to the marks of\nhis teeth on the piano. If mad dogs would confine themselves exclusively\nto practical jokers, I would be glad to endow a home for indigent mad dogs\nout of my own private funds.",
        "This great man lived in the old romantic days when it was a common thing\nfor a patriot to lay down his life that his country might live. He knew\nnot fear, and in his noble heart his country was always on top. Not alone\nat election did Arnold sacrifice himself, but on the tented field, where\nthe buffalo grass was soaked in gore, did he win for himself a deathless\nname. He was as gritty as a piece of liver rolled in the sand. Where glory\nwaited, there you would always find Arnold Winkelreid at the bat, with\nWilliam Tell on deck.",
        "One day the army of the tyrant got a scoop on the rebel mountaineers and\nit looked bad for the struggling band of chamois shooters. While Arnold’s\ndetachment didn’t seem to amount to a hill of beans, the hosts of the\ntyrannical Austrian loomed up like six bits and things looked forbidding.\nIt occurred to Colonel Winkelreid that the correct thing would be to break\nthrough the war front of the enemy, and then, while in his rear, crash in\nhis cranium with a cross gun while he was looking the other way. Acting on\nthis thought, he asked several of his most trusted men to break through\nthe Austrian line, so that the balance of the command could pass through\nand slaughter enough of the enemy for a mess, but these men seemed a\nlittle reticent about doing so, owing to the inclemency of the weather and\nthe threatening aspect of the enemy. The armed foe swarmed on every\nhillside and their burnished spears glittered below in the canon. You\ncouldn’t throw a stone in any direction without hitting a phalanx. It was\na good year for the phalanx business.",
        "Then Arnold took off his suspenders, and, putting a fresh chew of tobacco\nin among his back teeth, he told his men to follow him and he would show\nthem his little racket. Marching up to the solid line of lances, he\ngathered an armful and put them in the pit of his stomach, and, as he sank\nto the earth, he spoke in a shrill tone of voice to posterity, saying,\n\"Clear the track for Liberty.” He then died.",
        "His remains looked like a toothpick holder.",
        "But he made way for Liberty, and his troops were victorious.",
        "At the inquest it was shown that he might have recovered, had not the\nspears sat so hard on his stomach.",
        "Probably A. Winkelreid will be remembered with gratitude long after the\nname of the Sweet Singer of Michigan shall have rotted in oblivion. He\nrecognized and stuck to his proper spear. (This is a little mirthful\ndeviation of my own.)",
        "I can think of some men now, even in this $ age of the world, who could\nwin glory by doing as A.W. did. They could offer themselves up. They\ncould suffer for the right and have their names passed down to posterity,\nand it would be perfectly splendid.",
        "But the heroes of to-day are different. They are just as courageous, but\nthey take a wheelbarrow and push it from New York to San Francisco, or\nthey starve forty days and forty nights and then eat watermelon and\nlecture, or they eat 800 snipe in 800 years, or get an inspiration and\nkill somebody with it.",
        "The heroes of our day do not wear peaked hats and shoot chamois, and sass\ntyrants and knock the worm out of an apple at fifty-nine yards rise with a\ncross gun, as Tell did, but they know how to be loved by the people and\nget half of the gate money. They are brave, but not mortally. The heroes\nof our day all die of old age or political malaria.",
        "Gov. Murray, the gritty Gentile governor of Utah, would be noticed in a\ncrowd. He is very tall, yet well proportioned, square-built and handsome.\nHe was called fine looking in Kentucky, but the narrow-chested apostle of\nthe abnormally connubial creed does not see anything pretty about him.\nMurray moves about through Salt Lake City in a cool, self-possessed kind\nof way that is very annoying to the church. Full-bearded, with brown\nmoustache and dark hair parted a little to leeward of center; clothed in a\ndiagonal Prince Albert coat, a silk hat and other clothes, he strolls\nthrough Zion like a man who hasn’t got a yelping majority of ignorant\nlepers, led by a remorseless gang of nickel-plated apostles, thirsting for\nhis young blood. I really believe he don’t care a continental. The days of\nthe avenging angel and the meek-eyed Danite, carrying a large sock loaded\nwith buckshot, are over, perhaps; but only those who try to be Gentiles in\na land of polygamous wives and anonymous white-eyed children, know how\nvery unpopular it is. Judge Goodwin, of the Tribune, feels lonesome if he\ngets through the day without a poorly spelled, spattered, daubed and\nprofane valentine threatening his life. The last time I saw him he showed\nme a few of them. They generally referred to him as a blankety blank\n\"skunk,” and a “hound of hell.” He said he hoped I wound pardon him for\nthe apparent egotism, but he felt as though the Tribune was attracting\nattention almost everyday. Some of these little billet-doux invited him to\ncall at a trysting place on Tribune avenue and get his alleged brains\nscattered over a vacant lot. Most all of them threatened him with a\nrectangular head, a tin ear, or a watch pocket under the eye He didn’t\nseem to care much. He felt pleased and proud. Goodwin was always pleased\nwith things that other men didn’t like much. In the old days, when he and\nMark Twain and Dan DeQuille were together, this was noticed in him. Gov.\nMurray is the same way. He feels the public pulse, and says to himself:\n\"Sometime there’s going to be music here by the entire band, and I desire\nto be where I shan’t miss a note.”",
        "There are people who think the Mormons will not fight. Perhaps not. They\nwon’t if they are let alone, and allowed to fill the sage brush and line\nthe banks of the Jordan with juvenile nom de plumes. They are peaceful\nwhile they may populate Utah and invade adjoining territories with their\nherds of ostensible wives and prattling progeny; while they can bring in\nevery year via Castle Garden and the stock yards palace emigrant car,\nthousands of proselyted paupers from every pest house of Europe, and the\nfree-love idiots of America. But when Murray gets an act of congress at\nhis back and a squad of nervy, gamy, law-abiding monogamous assistants\nappointed by the president under that act of congress to knock crosswise\nand crooked the Jim Crow revelations of Utah and Mormondom, you will see\nthe fur fly, and the fragrant follower of a false prophet will rise up\nWilliam Riley and the regular army will feel lonesome. I asked a staff\nofficer in one of the territories last summer what would be the result if\nthe Mormons, with their home drill and their arms and their devotion to\nhome and their fraudulent religion, should awake Nicodemas and begin to\nmassacre the Gentiles, and the regular army should be sent over the\nWasatch range to quell the trouble.",
        "“Why,” said he, “the white-eyed followers of Mormonism would kill the\nregular army with clubs. You can wear out a tribe of hostile Indians when\nthe grass gives out and the antelope hunts the foothills, but the Mormons\nmake everything they eat, drink and wear. They don’t care whether there’s\ntariff or free trade. They can make everything from gunpowder to a knit\nundershirt, from a $250 revelation to a hand-made cocktail. When a church\ngets where it can make such cooking whisky as the Mormons do, it is time\nto call for volunteers and put down the hydra-headed monster.”",
        "If congress don’t step on a technicality and fall down, it looks like\namusement ahead, and if a District of Columbia rule, or martial law, or\ntocsin of war is the result, Gov. Murray is a good style of war governor.\nHe isn’t the kind of a man to put on his wife’s gossamer cloak and meander\nover into Montana. He would give the matter his attention, and you would\nfind him in the neighborhood when the national government decided to sit\ndown on disorderly conduct in Utah. The first lever to be used will be the\ngreat wealth of which the Mormon church and its members privately are\npossessed. Then the oleaginous prophet will get a revelation to gird up\nhis loins and to load the double-barrel shotgun, and fire the culverin,\nand to knock monogamy into a cocked hat. Money first and massacre second.\nThey can draw on their revelation supply house at three days, any time,\nfor authority to fill the irrigation ditches of Zion with the blood of the\nGentile and feed his vital organs to the coyote.",
        "Geology is that branch of natural science which treats of the structure of\nthe earth’s crust and the mode of formation of its rocks. It is a pleasant\nand profitable study, and to the man who has married rich and does not\nneed to work, the amusement of busting geology with the Bible, or busting\nthe Bible with geology is indeed a great boon.",

        "I once prepared a paper in astronomy entitled “The Chronological History\nand Habits of the Spheres.” It was very exhaustive and weighed four\npounds. I sent it to a scientific publication that was supposed to be\nworking for the advancement of our race. The editor did not print it, but\nhe wrote me a crisp and saucy postal card, requesting me to call with a\ndray and remove my stuff before the board of health got after it. In five\nshort years from that time he was a corpse. As I write these lines, I\nlearn with ill-concealed pleasure that he is still a corpse. An awful\ndispensation of Providence, in the shape of a large, wilted cucumber, laid\nhold upon his vitals and cursed him with an inward pain. He has since had\nthe opportunity, by actual personal observation, to see whether the\nstatements by me relating to astronomy were true. His last words were:\n\"Friends, Romans and countrymen, beware of the q-cumber. It will w up.” It\nwas not original, but it was good.",
        "The four great primary periods of the earth’s history are as follows, viz,\nto-wit:",

        "3. The Mesozoic or middle period of life.",
        "4. The Neozoic or recent period of life.",

        "Old timers state that the primitive condition of the earth was extremely\ndamp. With the onward march of time, and after the lapse of millions of\nyears, men found that they could get along with less and less water, until\nat last we see the pleasant, blissful state of things. Aside from the use\nof water at our summer resorts, that fluid is getting to be less and less\npopular. And even here at these resorts it is generally flavored with some\nforeign substance.",
        "The earth’s crust is variously estimated in the matter of thickness. Some\nthink it is 2,500 miles thick, which would make it safe to run heavy\ntrains across the earth anywhere on top of a second mortgage, while other\nscientists say that if we go down one-tenth of that distance we will reach\na place where the worm dieth not. I do not wish to express an opinion as\nto the actual depth or thickness of the earth’s crust, but I believe that\nit is none too thick to suit me.",
        "Thickness in the earth’s crust is a mighty good fault. We estimate the age\nof certain strata of the earth’s formation by means of a union of our\nknowledge of plant and animal life, coupled with our geological research\nand a good memory. The older scientists in the field of geology do not\nrely solely upon the tracks of the hadrasaurus or the cornucopia for their\ndata. They simply use these things to refresh their memory.",

Such an\naggregation of actual, living Silurian monsters, any one of which would\nmake a man a fortune to-day, if it could be kept on ice and exhibited for\none season only. You could take a full grown mastodon to-day, and with no\ncalliope, no lithographs, no bearded lady, no clown with four pillows in\nhis pantaloons and no iron-jawed woman, you could go across this continent\nand successfully compete with the skating rink.",
        "There would be but one difficulty. Tour expenses would not be heavy. The\nmastodon would be willing to board around, and no one would feel like\nturning a mastodon out of doors if he seemed to be hungry; but he might\nget away from you and frolic away so far in one night that you couldn’t\nget him for a day or two, even if you sent a detective for him.",
        "If I had a mastodon I would rather take him when he was young, and then I\ncould make a pet of him, so that he could come and eat out of my hand\nwithout taking the hand off at the same time. A large mastodon weighing a\nhundred tons or so is awkward, too. I suppose that nothing is more painful\nthan to be stepped on by an adult mastodon.",

        "I have just returned after a short tour in the far West. I made the tour\nwith my new lecture, which I am delivering this winter for the benefit,\nand under the auspices, of a young man who was a sufferer in the great\nrise-up-William-Biley-and-come-along-with-me cyclone, which occurred at\nClear Lake, in this State, a year ago last September.",

I therefore started out to deliver a few lectures for his\nbenefit, and in so doing have made a 4,000 mile trip over the Northern\nPacific railway, and the Oregon River and Navigation company’s road. On\nthe former line the passenger is fed by means of the dining-car, a very\ngood style of entertainment, indeed, and well worthy of the age in which\nwe live; but at Wallula Junction I stopped over to catch a west-bound\nOregon Railway and Navigation train.",
        "That was where I fooled myself. I should have taken my valise and a rubber\ndoor mat from the sleeping-car, and crawled into the lee of a snow fence\nfor the night. I did not give the matter enough thought. I just simply\nwent into the hotel and registered my name as a man would in other hotels.\nThis house was kept, or retained, I should say, by a relative of the late\nMr. Shylock. You have heard, no doubt, how some of the American hotels\nhave frowned on Mr. Shylock’s relatives. Well, Mr. Shylock’s family got\neven with the whole American people the night I stopped in No. 2, second\nfloor of the Abomination of Desolation. As a representative of the\nAmerican people, I received for my nation, vicariously, the stripes\nintended for many generations.",

The first thing that attracted my attention\nafter I was left alone, was the fact that other people had occupied this\nroom before I had, and, although they were gone, they had left a kind of\nan air of inferiority that clung to the alleged apartment, an air of plug\ntobacco and perspiration, if you will pardon the expression.",
        "They had also left a pair of Venetian pantaloons. From this clue, my\nactive brain at once worked out the problem and settled the fact that the\nparty who had immediately preceded me was a man. Long and close study of\nthe habits and characteristics of humanity has taught me to reason out\nthese matters, and to reach accurate conclusions with astonishing\nrapidity.",
        "He was not only a man, but he was a short man, with parenthetical legs and\na thoughtful droop to the seat of his pants. I also discovered that more\nof this man’s life had been expended in sitting on a pitch pine log than\nin prayer.",

        "In Wallula there is a marked feeling of childlike trust and confidence\nbetween people. It is a feature of Wallula society, I may say. The people\nof the junction trust strangers to a remarkable extent. In what other town\nin this whole republic would a pair of pantaloons be thus left in the\ncomplete power of a total stranger, a stranger, too, to whom pantaloons\nwere a great boon? I could easily have caught those pantaloons off the\nnail, thrust them into my bosom, and fled past the drowsy night clerk, out\ninto the great, sheltering arms of the silent night, but I did not.",
        "Anon through the long hours I would awake and listen fitfully to the wail\nof damned souls, as it seemed to me, the wail of those who tried to stay\nthere a week, and had starved to death. Here was their favorite wailing\nplace. Here was the place where damned souls seemed to throw aside all\nrestraint and have a good time. I tried to keep out the sound by stuffing\nthe pillow in my ear, but what is a cheap hotel pillow in a man’s ear, if\nhe wants to keep the noise out.",
        "So I lay there and listened to the soft sigh of the bath tub, the loud,\ndefiant challenge of the athletic butler down stairs, the last weak death\nrattle in the throat of the coffee pot in the dining room, and the wail of\nthe damned souls who had formerly stopped at this hotel, but who had been\nrescued at last, and had hilariously gone to perdition, only to come back\nat night and torment the poor guest by bragging over the superiority of\nhell as a refuge from the Wallula hotel.",
        "Now and then in the night I would almost yield to a wild impulse and catch\nthose pantaloons off the hook, to rush out and go to Canada with them, and\nthen I would softly go through the pockets and hang them back again.",
        "It was an awful night. When morning dawned at last, and I took the pillow\nout of my ear and looked in the delirious and soap-spattered mirror, I saw\nthat my beautiful hair, which had been such a source of pride to me ten\nyears ago, had disappeared in places. I paid my bill, called the attention\nof the landlord to the fact that I had not taken those pantaloons and\n’betrayed’ his trust, and then I went away.",

        "In England, during the present century, several inventors produced flying\nmachines, but in an evil hour agreed to rise on them themselves, and so\nthey died from their injuries. Some came down on top of the machines,\nwhile others preceded their inventions by a few feet, but the result was\nthe same. The invention of flying machines has always been handicapped, as\nit were, by this fact Men invent a flying machine and then try to ride it\nand show it off, and thus they are prevented by death from perfecting\ntheir rolling stock and securing their right of way.",
        "In 1842, Mr. William Henderson got out a “two-propeller” machine, and\ntried to incorporate a company to utilize it for the purpose of carrying\nletters, running errands, driving home the cows, lighting the Northern\nLights and skimming the cream off the Milky Way, but it didn’t seem to\ncompete very successfully with other modes of travel, and so Mr. Henderson\nwrapped it up in an old tent and put it away in the hay-mow.",

This society made some\nvaluable calculations and experiments in the interest of aerostation,\nadding much to our scientific knowledge, and filling London with cripples.",
        "In 1869, Mr. Joseph T. Kaufman invented and turned loose upon the people\nof Glasgow an infernal machine intended to soar considerably in a quiet\nkind of way and to be propelled by steam. It looked like the bird known to\nornithology as the flyupithecrick, and had an air brake, patent coupler,\nbuffer and platform. It was intended to hold two men on ice and a rosewood\ncasket with silver handles. It was mounted on wheels, and, as it did not\nseem to skim through the air very much, the people of Glasgow hitched a\nclothes line to it and used it for a band wagon.",
        "Rufus Porter invented an aerial dewdad ten years ago in Connecticut, where\nso many crimes have been committed since Mark Twain moved there. This was\ncalled the “aeraport,” and looked like a seed wart floating through space.\nThis engine was worked by springs connected with propellers. A saloon was\nsuspended beneath it, I presume on the principle that when a man is\nintoxicated he weighs a pound less. This machine flew around the rotunda\nof the Merchants’ Exchange, in New York City, eleven times, like a hen\nwith her head cut off, but has not been on the wing much since then.",
        "Other flying machines have been invented, but the air is not peopled with\nthem as I write. Most of them have folded their pinions and sought the\nseclusion of a hen-house. It is to be hoped that very soon some such\nmachine will be perfected, whereby a man may flit from the fifth story\nwindow of the Grand Pacific Hotel, in Chicago, to Montreal before\nbreakfast, leaving nothing in his room but the furniture and his kind\nregards.",
        "Such an invention would be hailed with much joy, and the sale would be\nenormous. Now, however, the matter is still in its infancy. The mechanical\nbirds invented for the purpose of skimming through the ether blue, have\nnot skum. The machines were built with high hopes and a throbbing heart,\nbut the aforesaid ether remains unskum as we go to press. The Milky Way is\nin the same condition, awaiting the arrival of the fearless skimmer. Will\nmen ever be permitted to pierce the utmost details of the sky and ramble\naround among the stars with a gum overcoat on? Sometimes I trow he will,\nand then again I ween not.",
        "The general passenger agent of a prominent road leading out of Chicago\ntoward the south, tells me that he is getting a good many letters lately\nasking for passes, and he complains bitterly over the awkward and\nunsatisfactory style of the correspondence. Acting on this suggestion and\nthough a little late in the day, perhaps, I have erected the following as\na guide to those who contemplate writing under similar circumstances:",
        "Office of The Evening Squeal, January 14, 1886.",
        "General Passenger Agent, Great North American Gitthere R.R., Chicago, Ill.",
        "Dear Sir.–I desire to know by return mail whether or no you would be\npleased to swap transportation for kind words. I am the editor of “The\nSqueal,” published at this place. It is a paper pure in tone, world wide\nin its scope and irresistible in the broad sweep of its mighty arm.",
        "I desire to visit the great exposition at New Orleans this winter, and\nwould be willing to yield you a few words of editorial opinion, set in\nlong primer type next to pure reading matter, and without advertising\nmarks.",
        "My object in thus addressing you is two-fold. I have always wanted to do\nyour road a kind act that would put it on its feet, but I have never\nbefore had the opportunity. This winter I feel just like it, and am not\nwilling, but anxious. Another object, though trivial, perhaps, to you, is\nvital to me. If I do not get the pass, I am afraid I shall not reach there\ntill the exposition is over. You can see for yourself how important it is\nthat I should have transportation. Day after day the president on to the\ngrounds and ask if I am there. Some official will salute him and answer\nsadly, “No, your highness, he has not yet arrived, but we look for him\nsoon. He is said to be stuck in a mud hole somewhere in Egypt.” Then the\nexposition will drag on again.",
        "You may make the pass read, “For self, Chicago to New Orleans and return,\"\nand I will write the editorial, or you may make it read, “Self and wife\"\nand I will let you write it yourself. Nothing is too good for my friends.\nWhen a man does me a kind act or shows signs of affection, I just allow\nhim to walk all over me and make himself perfectly free with the policy of\nmy paper.",
        "The “Evening Squeal” has been heard everywhere. We send it to the four\nwinds of Heaven, and its influence is felt wherever the English language\nis respected. And yet, if you want to belong to my coterie of friends, you\ncan make yourself just as free with its editorial columns as you would if\nyou owned it.",
        "And yet “The Squeal” is a bad one to stir up. I shudder to think what the\nresult would be if you should incur the hatred of “The Squeal.” Let us\navoid such a subject or the possibility of such a calamity.",
        "“The Squeal” once opposed the candidacy of a certain man for the office of\nschool district clerk, and in less than four years he was a corpse! Struck\ndown in all his wanton pride by one of the popular diseases of the day.",
        "My paper at one time became the foe of a certain road which tapped the\ngreat cranberry vineyards of northern Minnesota, and that very fall the\nberries soured on the vines!",
        "I might go on for pages to show how the pathway of “The Squeal” has been\nstrewn with the ruins of railroads, all prosperous and happy till they\nantagonized us and sought to injure us.",
        "I believe that the great journals and trunk lines of the land should stand\nin with one another. If you have the support and moral encouragement of\nthe press you will feel perfectly free to run over any one who gets on\nyour track. Besides, if I held a pass over your road I should feel very\nmuch reserved about printing the details of any accident, delay or washout\nalong your line. I aim to mould public opinion, but a man can subsidize\nand corrupt me if he goes at it right. I write this to kind of give you a\npointer as to how you can go to work to do so if you see fit.",
        "Should you wish to pervert my high moral notions in relation to railways,\nplease make it good for thirty days, as it may take me a week or so to\nmortgage my property and get ready to go in good style. I will let you\nknow on what day I will be in New Orleans, so that you can come and see me\nat that time. Should you have difficulty in obtaining an audience with me,\nowing to the throng of crowned heads, just show this autograph letter to\nthe doorkeeper, and he will show you right in. Wipe your boots before\nentering.",
        "Yours truly,",
        "Daniel Webster Briggs,\nEditor of “The Squeal.”",
        "It is my opinion that no railroad official, however disobliging, would\nhesitate a moment about which way he would swing after reading an epistle\nafter this pattern. Few, indeed, are the men who would be impolitic enough\nto incur the displeasure of such a paper as I have artfully represented\n\"The Squeal” to be.",
        "The name of George Washington has always had about it a glamour that made\nhim appear more in the light of a god than a tall man with large feet and\na mouth made to fit an old-fashioned, full-dress pumpkin pie. I use the\nword glamour, not so much because I know what glamour means, but because I\nhave never used it before, and I am getting a little tired of the short,\neasy words I have been using so long.",
        "George Washington’s face has beamed out upon us for many years now, on\npostage stamps and currency, in marble, and plaster, and bronze, in\nphotographs of original portraits, paintings, end stereoscopic views. We\nhave seen him on horseback and on foot, on the war-path and on skates,\ncussing his troops for their shiftlessness, and then in the solitude of\nthe forest, with his snorting war-horse tied to a tree, engaged in prayer.",
        "We have seen all these pictures of George, till we are led to believe that\nhe did not breathe our air or eat American groceries. But George\nWashington was not perfect. I say this after a long and careful study of\nhis life, and I do not say it to detract the very smallest iota from the\nproud history of the Father of his Country. I say it simply that the boys\nof America who want to become George Washingtons will not feel so timid\nabout trying it.",
        "When I say that George Washington, who now lies so calmly in the limekiln\nat Mount Vernon, could reprimand and reproach his subordinates at times,\nin a way to make the ground crack open and break up the ice in the\nDelaware a week earlier than usual, I do not mention it in order to show\nthe boys of our day that profanity will make them resemble George\nWashington. That was one of his weak points, and no doubt he was ashamed\nof it, as he ought to have been. Some poets think that if they get drunk,\nand stay drunk, they will resemble Edgar A. Poe and George D. Prentice.\nThere are lawyers who play poker year after year, and get regularly\nskinned, because they have heard that some of the able lawyers of the past\ncentury used to come home at night with poker chips in their pockets.",
        "Whisky will not make a poet, nor poker a great pleader. And yet I have\nseen poets who relied solely on the potency of their breath, and lawyers\nwho knew more of the habits of a bob-tail flush than they ever did of the\nstatutes in such case made and provided.",
        "George Washington was always ready. If you wanted a man to be first in\nwar, you could call on George. If you desired an adult who would be first\nbaseman in time of peace, Mr. Washington could be telephoned at any hour\nof the day or night. If you needed a man to be first in the hearts of his\ncountrymen, George’s postoffice address was at once secured.",
        "Though he was a great man, he was once a poor boy. How often we hear that\nin America! It is the place where it is a positive disadvantage to be born\nwealthy. And yet, sometimes I wish they had experimented a little that way\non me. I do not ask now to be born rich, of course, because it is too\nlate; but it seems to me that, with my natural good sense and keen insight\ninto human nature, I could have struggled along under the burdens and\ncares of wealth with great success. I do not care to die wealthy, but if I\ncould have been born wealthy, it seems to me I would have been tickled\nalmost to death.",
        "I love to believe that true greatness is not accidental. To think and to\nsay that greatness is a lottery is pernicious. Man may be wrong sometimes\nin his judgment of others, both individually and in the aggregate, but he\nwho gets ready to be a great man will surely find the opportunity.",
        "Many who read the above paragraph will wonder who I got to write it for\nme, but they will never find out.",
        "In conclusion, let me say that George Washington was successful for three\nreasons. One was that he never shook the confidence of his friends.\nAnother was that he had a strong will without being a mule. Some people\ncannot distinguish between being firm and being a big blue jackass.",
        "Another reason why Washington is loved and honored to-day, is that he died\nbefore we had a chance to get tired of him. This is greatly superior to\nthe method adopted by many modern statesmen, who wait till their\nconstituency weary of them and then reluctantly and tardily die.",
        "I went into the Chicago Board of Trade awhile ago to see about buying some\nseed wheat for sowing on my farm next spring. I heard that I could get\nwheat cheaper there than anywhere else, so I went over. The members of the\nBoard seemed to be all present. They were on the upper floor of the house,\nabout three hundred of them, I judge, engaged in conversation. All of them\nwere conversing when I entered, with the exception of a sad-looking man\nwho had just been squeezed into a corner and injured, I was told. I told\nhim that arnica was as good as anything I knew of for that, but he seemed\nirritated, and I strode majestically away. Probably he thought I had no\nbusiness to speak to him without an introduction, but I never stand on\nceremony when I see anyone in pain.",
        "I got a ticket when I went in, and began to look around for my wheat. I\ndidn’t see any at first. I then asked one of the conversationalists how\nwheat was.",
        "“Oh, wheat’s pretty steady just now, ’specially October, but yesterday we\nthought the bottom had dropped out. Perfect panic in No. 2, red; No. 2,\nChicago Spring, 73-7/8. Dull, my Christian friend, dull is no name for it.\nMore fellers got pinched yesterday than would patch purgatory fifteen\nmiles. What you doing, buying or selling?”",
        "“Buying.”",
        "“Better let me sell you some choice Chicago Spring way down. Get some man\nyou know on the Board to make the trade for you.”",
        "“Well, if you’ve got something good and cheap, and that you know will\ngrow, I’d like to look at it,” I said.",
        "He took me over by the door where there was a dishpan full of wheat, and\nasked me how that struck me, I said it looked good and asked him how much\nhe could spare of it at .73. He said he had 50,000 bushels that he wasn’t\nusing, and he thought he could get me another 50,000 of a friend, if I\nwanted it. I said no, 100,000 bushels was more than I needed. I told him\nthat if he would let me have that dishpan full, one-half cash and the\nbalance in installments, I might trade with him, but I didn’t want him to\nsell me his last bushel of wheat and rob himself.",
        "“Very likely you’ve got a family,” said I, “and you mustn’t forget that\nwe’ve got a long, cold, hard winter ahead of us. Hang on to your wheat.\nDon’t let Tom, Dick and Harry come along and chisel you out of your last\nkernel, just to be neighborly.”",
        "I remained in the room an hour and a half, the cynosure of all eyes. There\nis a great deal of sociability there. Three hundred men all talking\ndiagonally at each other at the same time, reminds me of a tete-a-tete I\nonce had with a warm personal friend, who was a boiler-maker. He invited\nme to come around to the shop and visit him. He said we could crawl down\nthrough the manhole into the boiler and have a nice visit while he worked.",
        "I remember of following him down through the hole into the boiler;\nthen they began to head boiler rivets, and I knew nothing more till I\nreturned to consciousness the next day to find myself in my own\nluxuriously-furnished apartments.",
        "The family physician was holding my hand. My wife asked: “Is he conscious\nyet, do you think, doctor?”",
        "“Yes,” he replied, “your husband begins to show signs of life. He may live\nfor many years, but his intellect seems to have been mislaid during his\nillness. Do you know whether the cat has carried anything out of this room\nlately?”",
        "Then my wife said: “Yes, the cat did get something out of this room only\nthe other day and ate it. Poor thing!”",
        "The Cow-Boy.",
        "So much amusing talk is being made recently anent the blood-bedraggled\ncow-boy of the wild West, that I rise as one man to say a few things, not\nin a dictatorial style, but regarding this so-called or so esteemed dry\nland pirate who, mounted on a little cow-pony and under the black flag,\nsails out across the green surge of the plains to scatter the rocky shores\nof Time with the bones of his fellow-man.",
        "A great many people wonder where the cow-boy, with his abnormal thirst for\nblood, originated. Where did this young Jesse James, with his gory record\nand his dauntless eye, come from? Was he born in a buffalo wallow at the\nfoot of some rock-ribbed mountain, or did he first breathe the thin air\nalong the brink of an alkali pond, where the horned toad and the centipede\nsang him to sleep, and the tarantula tickled him under the chin with its\nhairy legs?",
        "Careful research and cold, hard statistics show that the cow-boy, as a\ngeneral thing, was born in an unostentatious manner on the farm. I hate to\nsit down on a beautiful romance and squash the breath out of a romantic\ndream; but the cow-boy who gets too much moist damnation in his system,\nand rides on a gallop up and down Main street shooting out the lights of\nthe beautiful billiard palaces, would be just as unhappy if a mouse ran up\nhis pantaloon-leg as you would, gentle reader. He is generally a youth who\nthinks he will not earn his twenty-five dollars per month if he does not\nyell, and whoop, and shoot, and scare little girls into St. Vitus’s dance.\nI’ve known more cow-boys to injure themselves with their own revolvers\nthan to injure anyone else. This is evidently because they are more\nfamiliar with the hoe than they are with the Smith & Wesson.",
        "One night while I had rooms in the business part of a Territorial city in\nthe Rocky Mountain cattle country, I was awakened at about one o’clock A.\nM. by the most blood-curdling cry of “Murder” I ever heard. It was murder\nwith a big “M.” Across the street, in the bright light of a restaurant, a\ndozen cow-boys with broad sombreros and flashing silver braid, huge\nleather chaperajas,",
        "Mexican spurs and orange silk neckties, and with flashing revolvers, were\nstanding. It seemed that a big, red-faced Captain Kidd of the band, with\nhis skin full of valley tan, had marched into an ice-cream resort with a\nself-cocker in his hand, and ordered the vanilla coolness for the gang.\nThere being a dozen young folks at the place, mostly male and female, from\na neighboring hop, indulging in cream, the proprietor, a meek Norwegian\nwith thin white hair, deemed it rude and outre to do so. He said something\nto that effect, whereat the other eleven men of alcoholic courage let off\na yell that froze the cream into a solid glacier, and shook two kerosene\nlamps out of their sockets in the chandeliers.",
        "Thereupon, the little Y.M.C.A. Norwegian said:",
        "“Gentlemans, I kain’t neffer like dot squealinks and dot kaind of a tings,\nand you fellers mit dot ledder pantses on and dot funny glose and such a\ntings like dot, better keep kaind of quiet, or I shall call up the\npolicemen mit my delephone.”",
        "Then they laughed at him, and cried yet again with a loud voice.",
        "This annoyed the ice-cream agriculturist, and he took the old axe-handle\nthat he used to jam the ice down around the freezer with, and peeled a\nlarge area of scalp off the leader’s dome of thought, and it hung down\nover his eyes, so that he could not see to shoot with any degree of\naccuracy.",
        "After he had yelled “Murder!” three or four times, he fell under an\nice-cream table, and the mild-eyed Scandinavian broke a silver-plated\ncastor over the organ of self-esteem, and poured red pepper, and salt, and\nvinegar, and Halford sauce and other relishes, on the place where the\nscalp was loose.",
        "This revived the brave but murderous cow-gentleman, and he begged that he\nmight be allowed to go away.",
        "The gentle Y.M.C.A. superintendent of the ten-stamp ice-cream freezers\nthen took the revolvers away from the bold buccaneer, and kicked him out\nthrough a show-case, and saluted him with a bouquet of July oysters that\nsuffered severely from malaria.",
        "All cow-boys are not sanguinary; but out of twenty you will generally find\none who is brave when he has his revolvers with him; but when he forgot\nand left his shooters at home on the piano, the most tropical violet-eyed\ndude can climb him with the butt-end of a sunflower, and beat his brains\nout and spatter them all over that school district.",
        "In the wild, unfettered West, beware of the man who never carries arms,\nnever gets drunk and always minds his own business. He don’t go around\nshooting out the gas, or intimidating a kindergarten school; but when a\nbrave frontiersman, with a revolver in each boot and a bowie down the back\nof his neck, insults a modest young lady, and needs to be thrown through a\nplate-glass window and then walked over by the populace, call on the\nsilent man who dares to wear a clean shirt and human clothes.",
        "Last night I was awakened by the cry of fire. It was a loud, hoarse cry,\nsuch as a large, adult man might emit from his window on the night air.\nThe town was not large, and the fire department, I had been told, was not\nso effective as it should have been.",
        "For that reason I arose and carefully dressed myself, in order to assist,\nif possible. I carefully lowered myself from my room, by means of a\nstaircase which I found concealed in a dark and mysterious corner of the\npassage.",
        "On the streets all was confusion. The hoarse cry of fire had been taken up\nby others, passed around from one to another, till it had swollen into a\ndull roar. The cry of fire in a small town is always a grand sight.",
        "All along the street in front of Mr. Pendergast’s roller rink the blanched\nfaces of the people could be seen. Men were hurrying to and fro, knocking\nthe bystanders over in their frantic attempts to get somewhere else. With\ngreat foresight, Mr. Pendergast, who had that day finished painting his\nroller rink a dull-roan color, removed from the building the large card\nwhich bore the legend:",

        "The flames spread rapidly, until they threatened the Palace rink of our\nesteemed fellow-townsman, Mr. Pendergast, whose genial and urbane manner\nhas endeared him to all.",
        "With a degree of forethought worthy of a better cause, Mr. Leroy W. Butts\nsuggested the propriety of calling out the hook and ladder company, an\norganization of which every one seemed to be justly proud. Some delay\nensued in trying to find the janitor of Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company\nNo. 1’s building, but at last he was secured, and, after he had gone home\nfor the key, Mr. Butts ran swiftly down the street to awaken the foreman,\nbut, after he had dressed himself and inquired anxiously about the fire,\nhe said that he was not foreman of the company since the 2d of April.",
        "Meantime the firefiend continued to rise up ever and anon on his hind feet\nand lick up salt-barrel after salt-barrel in close proximity to the Palace\nrink, owned by our esteemed fellow-citizen, Mr. Pendergast. Twice Mr.\nPendergast was seen to shudder, after which he went home and filled out a\nblank which he forwarded to the insurance company.",
        "Just as the town seemed doomed, the hook and ladder company came rushing\ndown the street with their navy-blue hook and ladder truck. It is indeed a\nbeauty, being one of the Excelsior noiseless hook and ladder factory’s\nbest instruments, with tall red pails and rich blue ladders.",
        "Some delay ensued, as several of the officers claimed that under a new\nbylaw passed in January they were permitted to ride on the truck to fires.\nThis having been objected to by a gentleman who had lived in Chicago\nseveral years, a copy of the by-laws was sent for and the dispute\nsummarily settled. The company now donned its rubber overcoats with great\ncoolness and proceeded at once to deftly twist the tail of the firefiend.",
        "It was a thrilling sight as James McDonald, a brother of Terrance\nMcDonald, Trombone, Ind., rapidly ascended one of the ladders in the full\nglare of the devouring element and fell off again.",
        "Then a wild cheer arose to a height of about nine feet, and all again\nbecame confused.",
        "It was now past 11 o’clock, and several of the members of the hook and\nladder company who had to get up early the next day in order to catch a\ntrain excused themselves and went home to seek much-needed rest.",
        "Suddenly it was discovered that the brick livery stable of Mr. Abraham\nMcMichaels, a nephew of our worthy assessor, was getting hot. Leaving the\nPalace rink to its fate, the hook and ladder company directed its\nattention to the brick barn, and, after numerous attempts, at last\nsucceeded in getting its large iron prong fastened on the second story\nwindow-sill, which was pulled out. The hook was again inserted, but not so\neffectively, bringing down at this time an armful of hay and part of an\nold horse blanket. Another courageous jab was made with the iron hook,\nwhich succeeded in pulling out about 5 cents worth of brick. This was\ngreeted by a wild burst of applause from the bystanders, during which the\nhook and ladder company fell over each other and added to the horror of\nthe scene by a mad burst of pale-blue profanity.",
        "It was not long before the stable was licked up by the firefiend, and the\nhook and ladder company directed its attention toward the undertaking,\nembalming, and ice-cream parlors of our highly esteemed fellow-townsman,\nMr. A. Burlingame. The company succeeded in pulling two stone window-sills\nout of this building before it burned. Both times they were encored by the\nlarge and aristocratic audience.",
        "Mr. Burlingame at once recognized the efforts of the heroic firemen by\ntapping a keg of beer, which he distributed among them at 25 cents per\nglass.",
        "This morning a space forty-seven feet wide, where but yesterday all was\njoy and prosperity and beauty, is covered over with blackened ruins. Mr.\nPendergast is overcome by grief over the loss of his rink, but assures us\nthat if he is successful in getting the full amount of his insurance he\nwill take the money and build two rinks, either one of which will be far\nmore imposing than the one destroyed last evening.",
        "A movement is on foot to give a literary and musical entertainment at\nBurley’s hall, to raise funds for the purchase of new uniforms for the\n\"fire laddies,” at which Mrs. Butts has consented to sing “When the Robins\nNest Again,” and Miss Mertie Stout will recite “’Ostler Jo,” a selection\nwhich never fails to offend the best people everywhere.

Poverty is not the grand difficulty with the\nlittle barefoot boy of spring. It is the wild, ungovernable desire to\nwiggle his toes in the ambient air, and to soothe his parboiled heels in\nthe yielding mud.",
        "I see him now in my mind’s eye, making his annual appearance like a\nrheumatic housefly, stepping high like a blind horse. He has just left his\nshoes in the woodshed and stepped out on the piazza to proclaim that\nviolet-eyed spring is here. All over the land the gladiolus bulb and the\nice man begin to swell. The south wind and the new-born calf at the barn\nbegin to sigh. The oak tree and the dude begin to put on their spring\napparel. All nature is gay. The thrush is warbling in the asparagus\norchard, and the prima donna does her throat up in a red flannel rag to\nwait for another season.",
        "All these things indicate spring, but they are not so certain and\nunfailing as the little barefoot boy whose white feet are thrust into the\nface of the approaching season. Five months from now those little dimpled\nfeet, now so bleached and tender, will look like a mudturtle’s back and\nthe superior and leading toe will have a bandage around it, tied with a\npiece of thread.",

        "Yet John A. Logan and Samuel J. Tilden were once barefooted boys, with a\nsuspender apiece. It doesn’t seem possible, does it?",
        "How can we imagine at this time Julius Caesar and Hannibal Hamlin and\nLucretia Borgia at some time or other stubbed their bare toes against a\nroot and filled the horizon with pianissimo wails. The barefoot boy of\nspring will also proceed to bathe in the river as soon as the ice and the\npoliceman are out. He will choose a point on the boulevard, where he can\nget a good view of those who pass, and in company with eleven other little\nbarefoot boys, he will clothe himself in an Adam vest, a pair of bare-skin\npantaloons, a Greek slave overcoat and a yard of sunlight, and gaze\nearnestly at those who go by on the other side. Up and down the bank,\npasting each other with mud, the little barefoot boys of spring chase each\nother, with their vertebrae sticking into the warm and sleepy air, while\ndown in the marsh, where the cat-tails and the broad flags and the peach\ncan and the deceased horse grow, the bull-frog is twittering to his mate.",
        "Later on, the hoarse voice of a rude parental snorter is heard\napproaching, and twelve slim Cupids with sunburned backs are inserted into\ntwelve little cotton shirts and twelve despondent pairs of pantaloons hang\nat half-mast to twelve home-made suspenders, and as the gloaming gathers\nabout the old home, twelve boys back up against the ice-house to cool off,\nwhile the enraged parent hangs up the buggy whip in the old place.",
        "Will Taylor, the son of the present American Consul at Marseilles, was a\ngood deal like other boys while at school in his old home, at Hudson, Wis.\nOne day he called his father into the library, and said:",
        "“Pa, I don’t like to tell you, but the teacher and I have had trouble.”",
        "“What’s the matter now?”",
        "“Well, I cut one of the desks a little with my knife, and the teacher says\nI’ve got to pay a dollar or take a lickin’.”",
        "“Well, why don’t you take the licking and say nothing more about it? I can\nstand considerable physical pain, so long as it visits our family in that\nform. Of course, it is not pleasant to be flogged, but you have broken a\nrule of the school, and I guess you’ll have to stand it. I presume that\nthe teacher will in wrath remember mercy, and avoid disabling you so that\nyou can’t get your coat on any more.”",
        "“But, pa, I feel mighty bad about it already, and if you’d pay my fine I’d\nnever do it again. I know a good deal more about it now, and I will never\ndo it again. A dollar ain’t much to you, pa, but it’s a heap to a boy that\nhasn’t got a cent. If I could make a dollar as easy as you can, pa, I’d\nnever let my little boy get flogged that way just to save a dollar. If I\nhad a little feller that got licked bekuz I didn’t put up for him, I’d\nhate the sight of money always. I’d feel as if every dollar in my pocket\nhad been taken out of my little kid’s back.”",
        "“Well, now, I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll give you a dollar to save you\nfrom punishment this time, but if anything of this kind ever occurs again\nI’ll hold you while the teacher licks you, and then I’ll get the teacher\nto hold you while I lick you. That’s the way I feel about that. If you\nwant to go around whittling up our educational institutions you can do so;\nbut you will have to purchase them afterward yourself. I don’t propose to\nbuy any more damaged school furniture. You probably grasp my meaning, do\nyou not? I send you to school to acquire an education, not to acquire\nliabilities, so that you can come around and make an assessment on me. I\nfeel a great interest in you, Willie, but I do not feel as though it\nshould be an assessable interest. I want to go on, of course, and improve\nthe property, but when I pay my dues on it I want to know that it goes\ntoward development work. I don’t want my assessments to go toward the\npurchase of a school-desk with American hieroglyphics carved on it.",
        "“I hope that you will bear this in your mind, my son, and beware. It will\nbe greatly to your interest to beware. If I were in your place I would put\nin a large portion of my time in the beware business.”",
        "The boy took the dollar and went thoughtfully away to school, and no more\nwas ever said about the matter until Mr. Taylor learned casually several\nmonths later that the Spartan youth had received the walloping and filed\naway the dollar for future reference. The boy was afterward heard to say\nthat he favored a much heavier fine in cases of that kind. One whipping\nwas sufficient, he said, but he favored a fine of $5. It ought to be\nsevere enough to make it an object.",
        "“I Spy.”",
        "Dear reader, do you remember the boy of your school who did the heavy\nfalling through the ice and was always about to break his neck, but\nmanaged to live through it all? Do you call to mind the youth who never\nallowed anybody else to fall out of a tree and break his collar bone when\nhe could attend to it himself? Every school has to secure the services of\nsuch a boy before it can succeed, and so our school had one. When I\nentered the school I saw at a glance that the board had neglected to\nprovide itself with a boy whose duty it was to nearly kill himself every\nfew days in order to keep up the interest so I applied for the position. I\nsecured it without any trouble whatever. The board understood at once from\nmy bearing that I would succeed. And I did not betray the trust they had\nreposed in me.",
        "Before the first term was over I had tried to climb two trees at once and\nbeen carried home on a stretcher; been pulled out of the river with my\nlungs full of water, and artificial respiration resorted to; been jerked\naround over the north half of the county by a fractious horse whose halter\nI had tied to my leg, and which leg is now three inches longer than the\nother; together with various other little early eccentricities which I\ncannot at this moment call to mind. My parents at last got so that along\nabout 2 o’clock P.M. they would look anxiously out of the window and say,\n\"Isn’t it about time for the boys to get here with William’s remains? They\ngenerally get here before 2 o’clock.”",
        "One day five or six of us were playing “I spy” around our barn. Every body\nknows how to play “I spy.” One shuts his eyes and counts 100, for\ninstance, while the others hide. Then he must find the rest and say “I\nspy” so-and-so and touch the “goal” before they do. If anybody beats him\nto the goal the victim has to “blind” over again.",
        "Well, I knew the ground pretty well, and could drop twenty feet out of the\nbarn window and strike on a pile of straw so as to land near the goal,\ntouch it, and let the crowd in free without getting found out. I did this\nseveral times and got the blinder, James Bang, pretty mad. After a boy has\ncounted 500 or 600, and worked hard to gather in the crowd, only to get\njeered and laughed at by the boys, he loses his temper. It was so with\nJames Cicero Bang. I knew that he almost hated me, and yet I went on.\nFinally, in the fifth ballot, I saw a good chance to slide down and let\nthe crowd in again as I had done on former occasions. I slipped out of the\nwindow and down the side of the barn about two feet, when I was detained\nunavoidably. There was a “batten” on the barn that was loose at the upper\nend. I think I was wearing my father’s vest on that day, as he was away\nfrom home, and I frequently wore his clothes when he was absent. Anyhow\nthe vest was too large, and when I slid down that loose board ran up\nbetween the vest and my person in such a way as to suspend me about\neighteen feet from the ground, in a prominent but very uncomfortable\nposition.",
        "I remember it quite distinctly. James C. Bang came around where he could\nsee me. He said: “I spy Billy Nye and touch the goal before him.” No one\ncame to remove the barn. No one came to sympathize with me in my great\nsorrow and isolation. Every little while James C. Bang would come around\nthe corner and say: “Oh, I see ye. You needn’t think you’re out of sight\nup there. I can see you real plain. You better come down and blind. I can\nsee ye up there!”",
        "I tried to unbutton my vest and get down there and lick James, but it was\nof no use. It was a very trying time. I can remember how I tried to kick\nmyself loose, but failed. Sometimes I would kick the barn and sometimes I\nwould kick a large hole in the horizon. Finally I was rescued by a\nneighbor who said he didn’t want to see a good barn kicked into chaos just\nto save a long-legged boy that wasn’t worth over six bits.",
        "It affords me great pleasure to add that while I am looked up to and madly\nloved by every one that does not know me, Jas. C. Bang is brevet president\nof a fractured bank, taking a lonely bridal tour by himself in Europe and\nwaiting for the depositors to die of old age.",

        "Mark Anthony.",
        "Marcus Antonius, commonly called Mark Antony, was a celebrated Roman\ngeneral and successful politician, who was born in 83 B.C. His\ngrandfather, on his mother’s side, was L. Julius Caesar, and it is\nthought that to Mark’s sagacity in his selection of a mother, much of\nhis subsequent success was due.",
        "Young Antony was rather gay and festive during his early years, and led a\nlife that in any city but Rome would have occasioned talk. He got into a\ngreat many youthful scrapes, and nothing seemed to please him better than\nto repeatedly bring his father’s gray hairs down in sorrow to the grave.\nDebauchery was a matter to which he gave much thought, and many a time he\nwas found consuming the midnight oil while pursuing his studies in this\nline.",
        "At that time Rome was well provided for in the debauchery department, and\nMr. Antony became a thorough student of the entire curriculum.",
        "About 57 B.C. he obtained command of the cavalry of Gambinino in Syria\nand Egypt. He also acted as legate for Caesar in Gaul about 52 B.C., as\nnearly as I can recall the year. I do not know exactly what a legate is,\nbut it had something to do with the Roman ballet, I understand, and\ncommanded a good salary.",
        "He was also elected, in 50, B.C., as Argus and Tribune–acting as Tribune\nat night and Argus during the day time, I presume, or he may have been\nelected Tribune and ex-officio Argus. He was more successful as Tribune\nthan he was in the Argus business.",
        "Early in 49, B.C., he fled to Caesar’s camp, and the following year was\nappointed commander-in-chief. He commanded the left wing of the army at\nthe battle of Pharsalia, and years afterward used to be passionately fond\nof describing it and explaining how he saved the day, and how everybody\nelse was surprised but him, and how he was awakened by hearing one of the\nenemy’s troops, across the river, stealthily pulling on his pantaloons.",
        "Antony married Fulvia, the widow of a successful demagogue named P.\nClodius. This marriage could hardly be regarded as a success. It would\nhave been better for the widow if she had remained Mrs. P. Clodius, for\nMark Antony was one of those old-fashioned Romans who favored the utmost\nlatitude among men, but heartily enjoyed seeing an unfaithful woman burned\nat the stake. In those days the Roman girl had nothing to do but live a\npure and blameless life, so that she could marry a shattered Roman rake\nwho had succeeded in shunning a blameless life himself, and at last, when\nhe was sick of all kinds of depravity and needed a good, careful wife to\ntake care of him, would come with his dappled, sin-sick soul and shattered\nconstitution, and his vast acquisitions of debts, and ask to be loved by a\nnoble young woman. Nothing pleased a blase Roman so well as to have a\nyoung and beautiful girl, with eyes like liquid night, to take the job of\nreforming him. I frequently get up in the night to congratulate myself\nthat I was not born, 2,000 years ago, a Roman girl.",
        "The historian continues to say, that though Mr. Antony continued to live a\nlife of licentious lawlessness, that occasioned talk even in Rome, he was\nsingularly successful in politics.",
        "He was very successful at funerals, also, and his off-hand obituary works\nwere sought for far and wide. His impromptu remarks at the grave of\nCaesar, as afterward reported by Mr. Shakespeare, from memory, attracted\ngeneral notice and made the funeral a highly enjoyable affair. After this\nno assassination could be regarded as a success, unless Mark Antony could\nbe secured to come and deliver his justly celebrated eulogy.",
        "About 43, B.C., Antony, Octavius and Lepidus formed a co-partnership\nunder the firm name and style of Antony, Octavius & Co., for the purpose\nof doing a general, all-round triumvirate business and dealing in Roman\nrepublican pelts. The firm succeeded in making republicanism extremely\nodious, and for years a republican hardly dared to go out after dark to\nfeed the horse, lest he be jumped on by a myrmidon and assassinated. It\nwas about this time that Cicero had a misunderstanding with Mark’s\nmyrmidons and went home packed in ice.",
        "Mark Antony, when the firm of Antony, Octavius & Co. settled up its\naffairs, received as his share the Asiatic provinces and Egypt. It was at\nthis time that he met Cleopatra at an Egyptian sociable and fell in love\nwith her. Falling in love with fair women and speaking pieces over\nnew-made graves seemed to be Mark’s normal condition. He got into a\nquarrel with Octavius and settled it by marrying Octavia, Octavius’\nsister, but this was not a love match, for he at once returned to\nCleopatra, the author of Cleopatra’s needle and other works.",
        "This love for Cleopatra was no doubt the cause of his final overthrow, for\nhe frequently went over to see her when he should have been at home\nkilling invaders. He ceased to care about slashing around in carnage, and\npreferred to turn Cleopatra’s music for her while she knocked out the\nteeth of her old upright piano and sang to him in a low, passionate, vox\nhumana tone.",
        "So, at last, the great cemetery declaimer and long distance assassin, Mark\nAntony, was driven out of his vast dominions after a big naval defeat at\nActium, in September, 31 B.C., retreated to Alexandria, called for more\nreinforcements and didn’t get them. Deserted by his fleet, and reduced to\na hand-me-down suit of clothes and a two-year-old plug hat, he wrote a\npoetic wail addressed to Cleopatra and sent it to the Alexandria papers;\nthen, closing the door and hanging up his pantaloons on a nail so as to\nreduce the sag in the knees, he blew out the gas and climbed over the high\nboard fence which stands forever between the sombre present and the dark\nblue, mysterious ultimatum.",
        "“Speaking about prohibition,” said Misery Brown one day, while we sat lying\non the damp of the Blue Tail Fly, “I am prone to allow that the more you\nprohibit, the more you–all at once–discover that you have more or less\nfailed to prohibit.",
        "“Now, you can win a man over to your way of thinking, sometimes, but you\nmustn’t do it with the butt-end of a telegraph-pole. You might convert him\nthat way, perhaps, but the mental shock and phrenological concussion of\nthe argument might be disastrous to the convert himself.",
        "“A man once said to me that rum was the devil’s drink, that Satan’s home\nwas filled with the odor of hot rum, that perdition was soaked with spiced\nrum and rum punch. ’You wot not,’ said he, ’the ruin rum has rot. Why,\nMisery Brown,’ said he, ’rum is my bete noir.’ I said I didn’t care what\nhe used it for, he’d always find it very warming to the system. I told him\nhe could use it for a hot bete noir, or a blanc mange, or any of those\nfancy drinks; I didn’t care.",
        "“But the worst time I ever had grappling with the great enemy, I reckon,\nwas in the later years of the war, when I pretty near squashed the\nrebellion. Grim-visaged war had worn me down pretty well. I played the big\ntuba in the regimental band, and I began to sigh for peace.",
        "“We had been on the march all summer, it seemed to me. We’d travel through\ndust ankle-deep all day that was just like ashes, and halt in the red-hot\nsun five minutes to make coffee. We’d make our coffee in five minutes, and\nsometimes we’d make it in the middle of the road; but that’s neither here\nnor there.",
        "“We finally found out that we would make a stand in a certain town, and\nthat the Q.M. had two barrels of old and reliable whisky in store. We\nalso found out that we couldn’t get any for medical purposes nor anything\nelse All we could do was to suffer on and wait till the war closed. I\ndidn’t feel like postponing the thing myself, so I began to investigate.\nThe great foe of humanity was stored in a tobacco-house, and the Q.M.\nslept three nights between the barrels. The chances for a debauch looked\npeaked and slim in the extreme. However, there was a basement below, and I\ngot in there one night with a half-inch auger, and two wash-tubs. Later on\nthere was a sound of revelry by night. There was considerable ’on with the\ndance, let joy be unconfined.’",
        "“The next day there was a spongy appearance to the top of the head, which\nseemed to be confined to our regiment, as a result of the sudden giving\nway, as it were, of prohibitory restrictions. It was a very disagreeable\nday, I remember. All nature seemed clothed in gloom, and R.E. Morse,\nP.D.Q., seemed to be in charge of the proceedings. Redeyed Regret was\neverywhere.",
        "“We then proceeded to yearn for the other barrel of woe, that we might\npile up some more regret, and have enough misery to last us through the\nbalance of the campaign. We acted on this suggestion, and, with a firm\nresolve and the same half-inch auger, we stole once more into the basement\nof the tobacco-house.",
        "“I bored nineteen consecutive holes in the atmosphere, and then an\nintimate friend of mine bored twenty-seven distinct holes in the floor,\nonly to bore through the bosom of the night. Eleven of us spent the most\nof the night boring into the floor, and at three o’clock A.M. it looked\nlike a hammock, it was so full of holes. The quartermaster slept on\nthrough it all. He slept in a very audible tone of voice, and every now\nand then we could hear him slumbering on.",
        "“At last we decided that he was sleeping middling close to that barrel, so\nwe began to bore closer to the snore. It was my turn to bore, I remember,\nand I took the auger with a heavy heart. I bored through the floor, and\nfor the first time bored into something besides oxygen. It was the\nquartermaster. A wild yell echoed through the southern confederacy, and I\npulled out my auger. It had on the point a strawberry mark, and a fragment\nof one of those old-fashioned woven wire gray shirts, such as\nquartermasters used to wear.",
        "“I remember that we then left the tobacco-house. In the hurry we forgot\ntwo wash-tubs, a half-inch auger, and 980,361 new half-inch auger holes\nthat had never been used.”",
        "“Done It A-Purpose.”",
        "At Greeley a young man with a faded cardigan jacket and a look of woe got\non the train, and as the car was a little crowded he sat in the seat with\nme. He had that troubled and anxious expression that a rural young man\nwears when he first rides on the train. When the engine whistled he would\nalmost jump out of that cardigan jacket, and then he would look kind of\nfoolish, like a man who allows his impulses to get the best of him. Most\neveryone noticed the young man and his cardigan jacket, for the latter had\narrived at the stage of droopiness and jaded-across-the-shoulders look\nthat the cheap knit jacket of commerce acquires after awhile, and it had\nshrunken behind and stretched out in front so that the horizon, as you\nstood behind the young man, seemed to be bound by the tail of this\ngarment, which started out at the pocket with good intentions and suddenly\ndecided to rise above the young man’s shoulder blades.",
        "He seemed so diffident and so frightened among strangers, that I began to\ntalk with him.",
        "“Do you live at Greeley?” I inquired.",
        "“No, sir,” he said, in an embarrassed way, as most anyone might in the\npresence of greatness. “I live on a ranch up the Pandre. I was just at\nGreeley to see the circus.”",
        "I thought I would play the tenderfoot and inquiring pilgrim from the\ncultured East, so I said: “You do not see the circus often in the West, I\npresume, the distance is so great between towns and the cost of\ntransportation is so great?”",
        "“No, sir. This is the first circus I ever was to. I have never saw a\ncircus before.”",
        "“How did you like it?”",
        "“O, tip-top. It was a good thing. I’d like to see it every day if I could,\nI laughed and drank lemonade till I’ve got my cloze all pinned up with\npins, and I’d as soon tell you, if you wont give it away, that my pants is\ntied on me with barbed fence wire.”",
        "“Probably that’s what gives you that anxious and apprehensive look?”",
        "“Yes, sir. If I look kind of doubtless about something, its because I’m\nafraid my pantaloons will fall off on the floor and I will have to borrow\na roller towel to wear home.”",
        "“How did you like the animals?”",
        "“I liked that part of the Great Moral Aggregation the best of all. I have\nnot saw such a sight before. I could stand there and watch that there old\nscaly elephant stuff hay into his bosom with his long rubber nose for\nhours. I’d read a good deal first and last about the elephant, the king of\nbeasts, but I had never yet saw one. Yesterday father told me there hadn’t\nbeen much joy into my young life, and so he gave me a dollar and told me\nto go over to the circus and have a grand time. I tell you, I just turned\nmyself loose and gave myself up to pleasure.”",

They get big pay, but they never buy\ncloze with their money. Now, the idea of a woman that gets $2 or $3 a day,\nfor all I know, coming out there before 2,000 total strangers, wearing a\npair of Indian war clubs and a red ribbon in her hair.

        "“Did you go into the side show?”",
        "“No, sir. I studied the oil paintings on the outside, but I didn’t go in,\nI met a handsome looking man there near the side show, though, that seemed\nto take an interest in me. There was a lottery along with the show and he\nwanted me to go and throw for him.”",
        "“Capper, probably?”",
        "“Perhaps so. Anyhow, he gave me a dollar and told me to go and throw for\nhim.”",

I’ll bet he was a man with a velvet coat, and a\nmoustache dyed a dead black and waxed as sharp as a cambric needle.”",
        "“Yes; that’s his description to a dot. I wonder if he really did do that\na-purpose.”",
        "“Well, tell us about it. It does me good to hear a blamed fool tell how he\nlost his money. Don’t you see that your awkward ways and general greenness\nstruck the capper the first thing, and you not only threw away your own\nmoney, but two or three hundred other wappy-jawed pelicans saw you draw a\nbig prize and thought it was yours, then they deposited what little they\nhad and everything was lovely.”",
        "“Well, I’ll tell you how it was, if it’ll do any good and save other young\nmen in the future. You see this capper, as you call him, gave me a $1 bill\nto throw for him, and I put it into my vest pocket so, along with the\ndollar bill father gave me. I always carry my money in my right hand vest\npocket. Well, I sailed up to the game, big as old Jumbo himself, and put a\ndollar into the game. As you say, I drawed a big prize, $20 and a silver\ncup. The man offered me $5 for the cup and I took it.”",
        "“Then it flashed over my mind that I might have got my dollar and the\nother feller’s mixed, so I says to the proprietor, ’I will now invest a\ndollar for a gent who asked me to draw for him.’",

        "“Well, he seemed pained and grieved about something, and he asked me if I\nhadn’t time to go away into a quiet place where we could talk it over by\nourselves; but he had a kind of a cruel, insincere look in his eye, and I\nsaid no, I believed I didn’t care to, and that I was a poor\nconversationalist, anyhow; and so I came away, and left him looking at his\nbrass locket and kicking holes in the ground and using profane language.",
        "“Afterward I saw him talking to the proprietor of the lottery, and I feel,\nsomehow, that they had lost confidence in me. I heard them speak of me in\na jeering tone of voice, and one said as I passed by: ’There goes the\nmeek-eyed rural convict now,’ and he used a horrid oath at the same time.",

        "“We went over from Larmy,” said he, “in July, eight years ago–four of us.\nThere was me and Charcoal Brown, and old Joe and young Joe Connoy. We had\njust got comfortably down on the Lower Fork, out of the reach of everybody\nand sixty miles from a doctor, when Charcoal Brown got sick. Wa’al we had\na big time of it. You can imagine yourself somethin’ about it. Long in the\nnight Brown began to groan and whoop and holler, and I made a diagnosis of\nhim. He didn’t have much sand anyhow. He was tryin’ to git a pension from\nthe government on the grounds of desertion and failure to provide, and\nsome such a blame thing or another, so I didn’t feel much sympathy fur\nhim. But when I lit the gas and examined him, I found that he had a large\nfever on hand, and there we was without a doggon thing in the house but a\njug of emigrant whiskey and a paper of condition powders fur the mule. I\nwas a good deal rattled at first to know what the dickens to do fur him.\nThe whiskey wouldn’t do him any good, and, besides, if he was goin’ to\nhave a long spell of sickness we needed it for the watchers.",
        "“Wa’al, it was rough. I’d think of a thousand things that was good fur\nfevers, and then I’d remember that we hadn’t got ’em. Finally old Joe says\nto me, ’James, why don’t ye soak his feet?’ says he. ’Soak nuthin’,’ says\nI; ’what would ye soak ’em in?’ We had a long-handle frying-pan, and we\ncould heat water in it, of course, but it was too shaller to do any good,\nanyhow; so we abandoned that synopsis right off. First I thought I’d try\nthe condition powders in him, but I hated to go into a case and prescribe\nso recklessly. Finally I thought of a case of rheumatiz that I had up in\nBitter Creek years ago, and how the boys filled their socks full of hot\nashes and put ’em all over me till it started the persbyterian all over me\nand I got over it. So we begun to skirmish around the tent for socks, and\nI hope I may be tee-totally skun if there was a blame sock in the whole\nsyndicate. Ez fur me, I never wore ’em, but I did think young Joe would be\nfixed. He wasn’t though. Said he didn’t want to be considered proud and\nhigh strung, so he left his socks at home.",
        "“Then we begun to look around and finally decided that Brown would die\npretty soon if we didn’t break up the fever, so we concluded to take all\nthe ashes under the camp-fire, fill up his cloze, which was loose, tie his\nsleeves at the wrists, and his pants at the ankles, give him a dash of\ncondition powders and a little whiskey to take the taste out of his mouth,\nand then see what ejosted nature would do.",
        "“So we stood Brown up agin a tree and poured hot ashes down his back till\nhe begun to fit his cloze pretty quick, and then we laid him down in the\ntent and covered him up with everything we had in our humble cot.\nEverything worked well till he begun to perspirate, and then there was\nmusic, and don’t you forget it. That kind of soaked the ashes, don’t you\nsee, and made a lye that would take the peelin’ off a telegraph pole.",
        "“Charcoal Brown jest simply riz up and uttered a shrill whoop that jarred\nthe geology of Colorado, and made my blood run cold. The goose flesh riz\non old Joe Connoy till you could hang your hat on him anywhere. It was\nawful.",
        "“Brown stood up on his feet, and threw things, and cussed us till we felt\nashamed of ourselves. I’ve seen sickness a good deal in my time, but–I\ngive it to you straight–I never seen an invalid stand up in the\nloneliness of the night, far from home and friends, with the concentrated\nlye oozin’ out of the cracks of his boots, and reproach people the way\nCharcoal Brown did us.",
        "“He got over it, of course, before Christmas, but he was a different man\nafter that. I’ve been out campin’ with him a good many times sence, but he\nnever complained of feelin’ indisposed. He seemed to be timid about\ntellin’ us even if he was under the weather, and old Joe Connoy said mebbe\nBrown was afraid we would prescribe fur him or sumthin’.”",
        "Nero, who was a Roman Emperor from 54 to 68 A.D., was said to have been\none of the most disagreeable monarchs to meet that Rome ever had. He was a\nnephew of Culigula, the Emperor, on his mother’s side, and a son of\nDominitius Ahenobarbust, of St. Lawrence county. The above was really\nNero’s name, but in the year 50, A.D., his mother married Claudius and\nher son adopted the name of Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus. This\nname he was in the habit of wearing during the cold weather, buttoned up\nin front. During the hot weather, Nero was all the name he wore. In 53,\nNero married Octavia, daughter of Claudius, and went right to\nhousekeeping. Nero and Octavia did not get along first-rate. Nero soon\nwearied of his young wife and finally transferred her to the New\nJerusalem.",
        "In 54, Nero’s mother, by concealing the rightful heir to the throne for\nseveral weeks and doctoring the returns, succeeded in getting the steady\njob of Emperor for Nero at a good salary.",
        "His reign was quite stormy and several long, bloody wars were carried on\nduring that period. He was a good vicarious fighter and could successfully\nhold a man’s coat all day, while the man went to the front to get killed.\nHe loved to go out riding over the battle fields, as soon as it was safe,\nin his gorgeously bedizened band chariot and he didn’t care if the wheels\nrolled in gore up to the hub, providing it was some other man’s gore. It\ngave him great pleasure to drive about over the field of carnage and gloat\nover the dead. Nero was not a great success as an Emperor, but as a\ngloater he has no rival in history.",
        "Nero’s reign was characterized, also, by the great conflagration and Roman\nfireworks of July, 64, by which two-thirds of the city of Rome was\ndestroyed. The emperor was charged with starting this fire in order to get\nthe insurance on a stock of dry goods on Main street.",
        "Instead of taking off his crown, hanging it up in the hall and helping to\nput out the fire, as other Emperors have done time and again, Nero took\nhis violin up stairs and played, “I’ll Meet You When the Sun Goes Down.\"\nThis occasioned a great deal of adverse criticism on the part of those who\nopposed the administration. Several persons openly criticised Nero’s\npolicy and then died.",
        "A man in those days, would put on his overcoat in the morning and tell his\nwife not to keep dinner waiting. “I am going down town to criticise the\nEmperor a few moments,” he would say. “If I do not get home in time for\ndinner, meet me on the ’evergreen shore.’”",
        "Nero, after the death of Octavia, married Poppaea Sabina. She died\nafterward at her husband’s earnest solicitation. Nero did not care so much\nabout being a bridegroom, but the excitement of being a widower always\ngratified and pleased him.",
        "He was a very zealous monarch and kept Rome pretty well stirred up during\nhis reign. If a man failed to show up anywhere on time, his friends would\nlook sadly at each other and say, “Alas, he has criticised Nero.”",
        "A man could wrestle with the yellow fever, or the small-pox, or the\nAsiatic cholera and stand a chance for recovery, but when he spoke\nsarcastically of Nero, it was good-bye John.",
        "When Nero decided that a man was an offensive partisan, that man would\ngenerally put up the following notice on his office door:",
        "“Gone to see the Emperor in relation to charge of offensive partisanship.\nMeet me at the cemetery at 2 o’clock.”",
        "Finally, Nero overdid this thing and ran it into the ground. He did not\nwant to be disliked and so, those who disliked him were killed. This made\npeople timid and muzzled the press a good deal.",
        "The Roman papers in those days were all on one side. They did not dare to\nbe fearless and outspoken, for fear that Nero would take out his ad. So\nthey would confine themselves to the statement that: “The genial and\nurbane Afranius Burrhus had painted his new and recherche picket fence\nlast week,” or “Our enterprising fellow townsman, Caesar Kersikes, will\nremove the tail of his favorite bulldog next week, if the weather should\nbe auspicious,” or “Miss Agrippina Bangoline, eldest daughter of Romulus\nBangoline, the great Roman rinkist, will teach the school at Eupatorium,\nTrifoliatum Holler, this summer. She is a highly accomplished young lady,\nand a good speller.”",
        "Nero got more and more fatal as he grew older, and finally the Romans\nbegan to wonder whether he would not wipe out the Empire before he died.\nHis back yard was full all the time of people who had dropped in to be\nkilled, so that they could have it off their minds.",
        "Finally, Nero himself yielded to the great strain that had been placed\nupon him and, in the midst of an insurrection in Gaul, Spain and Rome\nitself, he fled and killed himself.",
        "The Romans were very grateful for Nero’s great crowning act in the killing\nline, but they were dissatisfied because he delayed it so long, and\ntherefore they refused to erect a tall monument over his remains. While\nthey admired the royal suicide and regarded it as a success, they censured\nNero’s negligence and poor judgment in suiciding at the wrong end of his\nreign.",
        "I have often wondered what Nero would have done if he had been Emperor of\nthe United States for a few weeks and felt as sensitive to newspaper\ncriticism as he seems to have been. Wouldn’t it be a picnic to see Nero\ncross the Jersey ferry to kill off a few journalists who had adversely\ncriticised his course? The great violin virtuoso and light weight Roman\ntyrant would probably go home by return mail, wrapped in tinfoil,\naccompanied by a note of regret from each journalist in New York, closing\nwith the remark, that “in the midst of life we are in death, therefore now\nis the time to subscribe.”",

The jury said if\nthe rope had been as tight as she was it might have saved her life.",
        "“Since then I’ve been where the sun and the air and the soil were free. It\nkind of soothed me to wear moccasins and throw my biled shirt into the\nMissouri.

Soon I learned how to\nparley-vous in the Indian language, and to wear the clothes of the red\nman. I married the squaw girl who saved me from the mountain fever and my\nfoes. She did not yearn for the equestrian of the white man’s circus. She\ndidn’t know how to raise XxYxZ to the nth power, but she was a wife worthy\nof the President of the United States. She was way off the trail in\nmatters of etiquette, but she didn’t know what it was to envy and hate the\npale faced squaw with the sealskin sacque and the torpid liver, and the\nhigh-priced throne of grace. She never sighed to go where they are filling\nup Connecticut’s celestial exhibit with girls who get mysteriously\nmurdered and the young men who did it go out lecturing. You see I keep\nposted.",

She might look out\nof place before the cross, with her chilblains and her childlike\nconfidence, among the Tom cat sealskin sacques of your camel’s hair\nChristianity, but if the world was supplied with Christians like my wife,\npurgatory would make an assignment, and the Salvation Army would go home\nand hoe corn. Sabe?”",
        "Referring to religious matters, the other day, Squaw Jim said: “I was up\nat the Post yesterday to kind of rub up against royalty, and refresh my\nmemory with a few papers. I ain’t a regular subscriber to any paper, for I\ncan’t always get my mail on time. We’re liable to be here, there and\neverywhere, mebbe at some celebrated Sioux watering place and mebbe on the\nwarpath, so I can’t rely on the mails much, but I manage, generally, to\nget hold of a few old papers and magazines now and then. I don’t always\nknow who’s president before breakfast the day after election, but I manage\nto skirmish around and find out before his term expires.",
        "“Now, speaking about the religion of the day, or, rather, the place where\nit used to be, it seems to me as if there’s a mistake somewhere. It looks\nas if religion meant greenness, and infidelity meant science and\nsmartness, according to the papers. I’m no scientist myself. I don’t know\nevolution from the side of a house. As an evolver I couldn’t earn my\nboard, probably, and I wouldn’t know a protoplasm from a side of sole\nleather; but I know when I get to the end of my picket rope, and I know\njust as sure where the knowable quits and the unknowable begins as\nanybody.

He handed an oilcloth grip\nacross the counter, registered in a bold, bad way and with a flourish that\nscattered the ink all over the clerk’s white shirt front.",

He\ntold him all about Paris and the continent, meanwhile polishing his hands\non the tablecloth and eating everything within reach. While he ate another\nman’s dessert, he chatted on gaily about Cologne and pitied the cattle man\nwho had to stay out on the bleak plains and watch the cows, while others\npaddled around Venice and acquired information in a foreign land.",
        "At first the cattle man showed some interest in Europe, but after awhile\nhe grew quiet and didn’t seem to enjoy it. Later on the European tourist,\nwith soiled cuffs and auburn mane, ordered the waiters around in a\nmajestic way, to impress people with his greatness, tipped over the\nvinegar cruet into the salt and ate a slice of boiled egg out of another\nman’s salad.",

The cattle man, who, by the way, has been abroad\nfive or six times and is as much at home in Paris as he is in Omaha,\ninvestigated the matter, and learned that the fresh French tourist had\nbeen herding hens on a chicken ranch in Kansas for six years, and had\nnever seen blue water. He then took a few personal friends to the\ndining-room door, and they watched the alleged traveler. He had just taken\na long, refreshing drink from the finger bowl of his neighbor on the left\nand was at that moment, trying to scoop up a lump of sugar with the wrong\nend of the tongs.",

Many others\nof my acquaintance have endeavored to maintain a diary, but have only\nadvanced so far as the second week in January. It is my purpose to write\ndown each evening the events of the day as they occur to my mind, in order\nthat in a few years they may be read and enjoyed by my family.

        "December 4.–This morning we have had trouble with the hired girl. It\noccurred in this wise: We had fully two-thirds of a pumpkin pie that had\nbeen baked in a square tin. This major portion of the pie was left over\nfrom our dinner yesterday, and last night, before retiring to rest, I\ndesired my wife to suggest something in the cold pie line, which she did.\nI lit a candle and explored the pantry in vain. The pie was no longer\nvisible. I told Mrs. Adams that I had not been successful, whereupon we\nsought out the hired girl, whose name is Tootie Tooterson, a foreign\ndamsel, who landed in this country Nov. 7, this present year. She does not\nunderstand our language, apparently, especially when we refer to pie. The\nonly thing she does without a strong foreign accent is to eat pumpkin pie\nand draw her salary. She landed on our coast six weeks ago, after a\ntedious voyage across the heaving billows. It was a close fight between\nTootie and the ocean, but when they quit, the heaving billows were one\nheave ahead by the log.",
        "Miss Tooterson landed in Massachusetts in a woolen dress and hollow clear\ndown into the ground. A strong desire to acquire knowledge and cold,\nhand-made American pie seems to pervade her entire being.",
        "She has only allowed Mrs. Adams and myself to eat what she did not want\nherself.",
        "Miss Tooterson has also introduced into my household various European\neccentricities and strokes of economy which deserve a brief notice here.\nAmong other things she has made pie crust with castor oil in it, and\nlubricated the pancake griddle with a pork rind that I had used on my lame\nneck. She is thrifty and saving in this way, but rashly extravagant in the\nuse of doughnuts, pie and Medford rum, which we keep in the house for\nvisitors who are so unfortunate as to be addicted to the doughnut, pie or\nrum habit.",
        "It is discouraging, indeed, for two young people like Mrs. Adams and\nmyself, who have just begun to keep house, to inherit a famine, and such a\nrobust famine, too. It is true that I should not have set my heart upon\nsuch a transitory and evanescent terrestrial object like a pumpkin pie so\nnear to T. Tooterson, imported pie soloist, doughnut mastro and feminine\nvirtuoso, but I did, and so I returned from the pantry desolate.",
        "I told Abigail that unless we poisoned a few pies for Tootie the Adams\nfamily would be a short-lived race. I could see with my prophetic eye that\nunless the Tootersons yielded the Adamses would be wiped out. Abigail\nwould not consent to this, but decided to relieve Miss Tooterson from duty\nin this department, so this morning she went away. Not being at all\nfamiliar with the English language, she took four of Abigail’s sheets and\nquite a number of towels, handkerchiefs and collars. She also erroneously\ntook a pair of my night-shirts in her poor, broken way. Being entirely\nignorant of American customs, I presume that she will put a belt around\nthem and wear them externally to church. I trust that she will not do\nthis, however, without mature deliberation.",
        "I also had a bottle of lung medicine of a very powerful nature which the\ndoctor had prepared for me. By some oversight, Miss Tooterson drank this\nthe first day that she was in our service. This was entirely wrong, as I\ndid not intend to use it for the foreign trade, but mostly for home\nconsumption.",
        "This is a little piece of drollery that I thought of myself. I do not\nthink that a joke impairs the usefulness of a diary, as some do. A diary\nwith a joke in it is just as good to fork over to posterity as one that is\nnot thus disfigured. In fact, what has posterity ever done for me that I\nshould hesitate about socking a little humor into a diary? When has\nposterity ever gone out of its way to do me a favor? Never! I defy the\nhistorian to show a single instance where posterity has ever been the\nfirst to recognize and remunerate ability.",

        "I do not know which I dislike most, foreign usurpation or the oleander. I\nhave carried that plant up and down stairs every time the weather has\nchanged, and the fickle elements of New England have kept me rising and\nfalling with the thermometer, and whenever I raised or fell I most always\nhad that scrawny oleander in my arms.",
        "Richly has it repaid us, however, with its long, green, limber branches\nand its little yellow nubs on the end. How full of promises to the eye\nthat are broken to the heart. The oleander is always just about to meet\nits engagements, but later on it peters out and fails to materialize.",
        "I do not know what we would do if it were not for our house plants. Every\nfall I shall carry them cheerfully down cellar, and in the spring I will\nbring up the pots for Mrs. Adams to weep softly into. Many a night at the\nspecial instance and request of my wife I have risen, clothed in one\nsimple, clinging garment, to go and see if the speckled, double and\ntwisted Rise-up-William-Riley geranium was feeling all right.",
        "Last summer Abigail brought home a slip of English ivy. I do not like\nthings that are English very much, but I tolerated this little sickly\nthing because it seemed to please Abigail. I asked her what were the\nsalient features of the English ivy. What did the English ivy do? What\nmight be its specialty? Mrs. Adams said that it made a specialty of\nclimbing. It was a climber from away back. “All right,” I then to her did\nstraightway say, “let her climb.” It was a good early climber. It climbed\nhigher than Jack’s beanstalk. It climbed the golden stair. Most of our\nplants are actively engaged in descending the cellar stairs or in\nascending the golden stair most all the time.",
        "I descended the stairs with the oleander this morning, though the oleander\ngot there a little more previously than I did. Parties desiring a good,\nsecondhand oleander tub, with castors on it, will do well to give us a\ncall before going elsewhere. Purchasers desiring a good set of second-hand\near muffs for tulips will find something to their advantage by addressing\nthe subscriber.",
        "We also have two very highly ornamental green dogoods for ivy vines to\nramble over. We could be induced to sell these dogoods at a sacrifice, in\norder to make room for our large stock of new and attractive dogoods.\nThese articles are as good as ever. We bought them during the panic last\nfall for our vines to climb over, but, as our vines died of membranous\ncroup in November, these dogoods still remain unclum. Second-hand dirt\nalways on hand. Ornamental geranium stumps at bed-rock prices. Highest\ncash prices paid for slips of black-and-tan foliage plants. We are\nheadquarters for the century plant that draws a salary for ninety-nine\nyears and then dies.",

        "And this last is one of the most important of all. It is the amateur\nstatesman who talks the most. Fearing that he will conceal his identity as\na fool, he babbles in conversation and slashes around in his shallow banks\nin public.",
        "As soon as I get the house plants down cellar and get their overshoes on\nfor the winter, I will more seriously consider the question of our\npolitical affairs here in this new land where we have to tie our scalps on\nat night and where every summer is an Indian summer.",
        "John Adams’ Diary\n(No. 3.)",
        "December 10.–I have put in a long and exhausting day in the court to-day\nin the case of Merkins vs. Merkins, a suit for divorce in which I am the\ncounsel for the plaintiff, Eliza J. Merkins.",
        "The case itself is a peculiarly trying one, and the plaintiff adds to its\nhorrors by consulting me when I want to do something else. I took her case\nat an agreed price, and so Mrs. Merkins is trying to get her money’s worth\nby consulting me in a way I abhor. She has consulted me in every mood and\ntense that I know of; at my office, on the street, in church, at the\nfestive board and at different funerals to which we both happened to be\ncalled. Mrs. Merkins has hung like a pall over several Massachusetts\nfunerals which otherwise had every symptom of success.",
        "I am a great admirer of woman as a woman, but as a client in a suit for\ndivorce she has her peculiarities. I have seen Eliza in every phase of the\ncase. She has been calm and tearful, stormy and snorting, low-spirited and\nred-nosed, violent and menacing, resigned but sobby, trustful and\nconfidential, high strung and haughty, crushed and weepy.",
        "She makes a specialty of shedding the red-hot scalding tear wherever she\ncan obtain permission to do so. She has wept in my wood-box, in my new\nspittoon, on my desk and on my birthday. I told her that I wished she\nwould please weep on something else. There were enough objects in nature\nupon which a poor woman who wept constantly and had no other visible means\nof support could shed the wild torrents of her grief, without weeping on\nmy anniversary. A man wants to keep his birthday as dry as possible. He\nhates to have it wept on by a client who has jewed him down to half price,\nand then insisted on coming in to sob with him in the morning before he\nhas swept the office floor.",
        "One time she came and sobbed on my shoulder. Her tears are of the warm,\ndamp kind, and feel disagreeable as they roll down the neck of a\ncomparative stranger, who never can be aught but a friend. She rested her\nbonnet on my bosom while she wept, and I then discovered that she has been\nin the habit of wearing this bonnet while cooking her buckwheat pancakes.\nI presume she keeps her bonnet on all the time, so that she may be ready\nto dash out and consult me at all times without delay. Still, she ought\nnot to do it, for when she leans her head on the bosom of her counsel in\norder to consult him, he detects the odor of the early sausage and the\nfleeting pancake.",
        "  You may bust such a bonnet and crush it if you will,\n  But the scent of the pancake will cling round it still.",
        "As soon as I saw that her object was to lean up against me and not only\nconvulse herself with sobs, but that she intended to jar me also with her\ngreat woe, I told her that I would have to request her to avaunt. I then,\nas she did not act upon my suggestion, avaunted her myself. I avaunted her\ninto a chair with a sickening thud.",
        "She then burst forth in a torrent of vituperation. When the abnormal\nsobber is suddenly corked up, these sobs rankle in the system and burst\nforth in the shape of vituperation. In the course of her remarks, she\nstated in a violent manner that she would denounce me throughout the\ncountry and retain other counsel. I told her I wished she would, as my\nsympathies were with Mr. Merkins. I told her that she must either pay me a\nlarger fee or I should insist on her weeping in the alley before she came\nup.",
        "She then took her departure with a rising inflection. On the following\nday, however, I found her at the office door, and she stood near and\nconsulted me again, while I took up the ashes and started a fire in the\nstove.",
        "Her case is quite peculiar.",
        "She wants a divorce from her husband on the grounds of cruelty to animals,\nor something of that kind, and when she first told me about it I thought\nshe had a case, but when we came to trial I found that she had had every\nreason to believe that if she could be segregated from Mr. Merkins she\ncould at once become the bride of a gentleman who ploughed the raging\nmain.",
        "Just as we went to the jury to-day with the case, she heard casually that\nthe gentleman who had been in the main-ploughing business had just married\nwithout her knowledge or consent.",
        "“Heap Brain.”",
        "Much trouble has been done by a long haired phrenologist in the West who\nhas, during his life, felt of over a hundred thousand heads. A comparison\nof a large number of charts given in these cases shows that so far no head\nexamined would indicate anything less than a member of the lower house of\ncongress. Artists, orators, prima-donnas and statesmen are plenty, but\nthere are no charts showing the natural-born farmer, carpenter, shoemaker\nor chambermaid.",
        "That is the reason butter is so high west of the Missouri river to-day,\nwhile genius actually runs riot.",
        "What this day and age of the world needs, is a phrenologist who will paw\naround among the intellectual domes of free-born American citizens, and\nsearch out a few men who can milk a cow in a cool and unimpassioned tone\nof voice.",
        "It is true that every man in America is a sovereign, but he had better not\noverdo it. The man who sits up nights to be a sovereign and allows the\ncalves to eat his brown-eyed beans, is not leading his fellow men up to a\nhigher and nobler life. The sovereign business can be run in the ground if\nwe are not careful.",
        "Very likely the white-eyed boy with the hickory dado along the base of his\noveralls is the boy who in future years is to be the president of the\nUnited States. But do not, oh, do not trow, fair young reader, that every\nAlbino youth in our broad land who wears an isosceles triangle in navy\nblue flannel athwart his system, is going to be the chief magistrate of\nthis mighty republic.",
        "We need statesmen and orators and artists very much; but the world at this\nmoment also needs several athletic parties with the horse-sense adequate\nto produce flour and other vegetables necessary to feed the aforesaid\nstatesmen, orators, etc., etc.",
        "Let me say a word to the bright-eyed youth of America, Let me murmur in\nyour ear this never dying truth: When a long-haired crank asks you a\ndollar to tell you, you are a young Demosthenes, stand up and look\nyourself over at a distance before you swallow it all.",
        "There is no use talking, we have got to procure provisions in some manner,\nand in order to do so the natural-born bone and muscle of the country must\ngo at and promote the growth of such things, or else we artists, poets and\nstatesmen, will have to take off our standing collars and do it ourselves.",
        "Phrenology is a good thing, no doubt, if we can purify it. So long as it\ndoes not become the slave of capital, there is nothing about phrenology\nthat is going to do harm; but when it becomes the creature of the trade\ndollar, it looks as though the country would be filled up with wild-eyed\ngenius that hasn’t had a square meal for two weeks. The time will surely\ncome when America will demand less statesmanship and more flour; when less\nstatistics and a purer, nobler and more progressive style of beefsteak\nwill demand our attention.",
        "I had hoped that phrenology would step in and start this reform; but so\nfar it has not, within the range of my observation. It may be, however,\nthat the mental giant bump translator with whom I came in contact was not\na fair representative. Still, he has been in the business for over thirty\nyears, and some of our most polished criminals have passed under his\nhands.",
        "An erroneous phrenologist once told me that I would shine as a revivalist,\nand said that I ought to marry a tall blonde with a nervous, sanguinary\ntemperament. Then he said, “One dollar, please,” and I said, “All right,\ngentle scientist with the tawny mane, I will give you the dollar and marry\nthe tall blonde with the bank account and bilious temperament, when you\ngive me a chart showing me how to dispose of a brown-eyed brunette with a\nthoughtful cast of countenance, who married me in an unguarded moment two\nyears ago.”",
        "He looked at me in a reproachful kind of way, struck at me with a chair in\nan absent-minded manner and stole away.",
        "The following letter has been received, and, as it encloses no unsmirched\npostage stamp to insure a private reply, I take great pleasure in\nanswering it in these pages:",
        "Christiana, Kas., Sept. 22nd, 1884",
        "Dear Sir.–I am studying for a Humorist. Could you help me to some of the\nJoliest Books that are written? With some of the best Jokes of the Day &c\n&c &c.",
        "Also what it would be best for me to do for to become an Humorist.",
        "I am said to be a Natural Born Humorist by my friends and all I need is\nCultivation to make my mark.",
        "Please reply by return mail.",
        "Kindly Yours",
        "Herman A.H.",
        "For some time I have been grieving over the dearth of humor in America,\nand wondering who the great coming humorist was to be. Several papers have\nalready deplored the lack of humor in our land, but they have not been\nable to put their finger on the approaching humorist of the age. Just as\nwe had begun to despair, however, here he comes, quietly and\nunostentatiously, modestly and ungrammatically. Unheralded and silently,\nlike Maud S. or any other eminent man, he slowly rises above the Kansas\nhorizon, and tells us that it will be impossible to conceal his identity\nany longer. He is the approaching humorist of the nineteenth century.",
        "It is a serious matter, Herman, to prescribe a course of study that will\nbe exactly what you need to bring you out. Perhaps you might do well to\ntake a Kindergarten course in spelling and the rudiments of grammar;\nstill, that is not absolutely necessary. A friend of mine named Billings\nhas done well as a humorist, though his knowledge of spelling seems to be\npitiably deficient. Grammar is convenient where a humorist desires to put\non style or show off before crowned heads, but it is not absolutely\nindispensable.",
        "Regarding the “Joliest Books” necessary for your perusal, in order to\nchisel your name on the eternal tablets of fame, tastes will certainly\ndiffer. I am almost sorry that you wrote to me, because we might not\nagree. You write like one of these “Joly” humorists such as people employ\nto go along with a picnic and be the life of the party, and whose presence\nthroughout the country has been so depressing. If one may be allowed to\njudge of your genius by the few autograph lines forwarded, you belong to\nthat class of brain-workers upon whom devolves the solemn duty of pounding\nsand. If you are really a brain-worker, will you kindly inform the writer\nwhose brain you are working now, and how you like it as far as you have\ngone?",
        "American humor has burst forth from all kinds of places, nearly. The\nvarious professions have done their share. One has risen from a tramp\nuntil he is wealthy and dyspeptic, and another was blown up on a steamboat\nbefore he knew that he was a humorist.",
        "Suppose you try that, Herman. M. Quad, one of the very successful\nhumorists of the day, both in a literary and financial way, was blown up\nby a steamboat before he bloomed forth into the full flush and power of\nsuccess. Try that, Herman. It is a severe test, but it is bound to be a\nsuccess. Even if it should be disastrous to you, it will be rich in its\nbeneficial results to those who escape.",
        "On 3d street, St. Paul, there stands a restaurant that has outside as a\nsign, under a glass case, a rib roast, a slice of ham and a roast duck\nthat I remembered distinctly having seen there in 1860 and before the war.\nI asked an epicure the other day if he thought it right to keep those\nthings there year after year when so many were starving throughout the\nlength and breadth of the land. He then straightway did take me up close\nso that I could see that the food was made of plaster and painted, as\nhereinbefore set forth and by me translated, as Walt Whitman would say.",
        "A day or two afterward, at a rural hotel, I struck some of that same roast\nbeef and ham. I thought that the sign had been put on the table by\nmistake, and I made bold to tell the proprietor about it, on the ground\nthat “any neglect or impertinence on the part of servants should be\nreported at the office.” He received the information with great rudeness\nand a most disagreeable air.",
        "There are two kinds of guests who live at the average hotel. One is the\nparty who gets up and walks over the whole corps de hote, from the\nbald-headed proprietor to the bootblack, while the other is the meek and\nmild-eyed man, doomed to sit at the table and bewail the flight of time\nand the horrors of starvation while waiting for the relief party to come\nwith his food.",
        "I belong to the latter class. Born, as I was, in a private family, and\nearly acquiring the habit of eating food that was intended to assuage\nhunger mostly, it takes me a good while to accustom myself to the style of\ndyspeptic microbe used simply to ornament a bill of fare. Of course it is\nmaintained by some hotel men that food solely for eating purposes is\nbecoming obsolete and outre, and that the stuff they put on their bills\nof fare is just as good to pour down the back of a guest as diet that is\ncooked for the common, low, perverted taste of people who have no higher\naspiration than to eat their food.",
        "Of course the genial, urbane and talented reader will see at once the\nstyle of hotel I am referring to. It is the hotel that apes the good hotel\nand prints a bill of fare solely as a literary effort. That is the hotel\nwhere you find the moth-eaten towel and the bed-ridden coffee. There is\nwhere you get butter that runs the elevator day times and sleeps on the\nflannel cakes at night.",
        "It is there that you meet the weary and way-worn steak that bears the\ntoothprints of other guests who are now in a land where the early-rising\nchambermaid cannot enter.",
        "I also refer to the hotel where the bellboy is simply an animated polisher\nof banisters, and otherwise extremely useless. It is likewise the house\nwhere the syrup tastes like tincture of rhubarb, and the pancakes taste\nlike a hektograph.",
        "The traveling man will call to mind the hotel to which I refer, and he\nwill instantly name it and tell you that he has never spent the Sabbath\nthere.",
        "I honestly believe that some hotel men lose money and custom by trying to\nissue a large blanket-sheet bill of fare every day, when a more modest\nlist containing two or three things that a human being could eat with\nimpunity would be far more acceptable, healthy and remunerative.",
        "Some people can live on cracked wheat, bran and skimmed milk, no matter\nwhere they go, and so they always seem to be perfectly happy; but, while\nsimplicity is my watchword, and while I am Old Simplicity himself, as it\nwere, I haven’t been constructed with stomachs enough to successfully\nwrestle with these things. I like a few plain dishes with victuals on\nthem, cooked by a person who has had some experience in that line before.\nI am not so especially tied to high prices and finger-bowls, for I have\nrisen from the common people, and during the first eighteen years of my\nlife I had to dress myself. I was not always the pampered child of\nenervating luxury that I now am, by any means. So I can subsist for weeks\non good, plain food, and never murmur or repine; but where the mistake at\nsome hotels seems to have been made, is in trying to issue a bill of fare\nevery day that will attract the attention of literary minds and excite the\ncuriosity of linguists instead of people who desire to assuage an internal\ncraving for grub.",
        "I use the term grub in its broadest and most comprehensive sense.",
        "So, if I may take the liberty to do so, let me exhort the landlord who is\ngradually accumulating indebtedness and remorse, to use a plainer, less\nelaborate, but more edible list of refreshments. Otherwise his guests will\nall die young.",
        "Let him discard the seamless waffle and the kiln-dried hen. Let him\nabstain from the debris known as cottage pudding, that being its alias,\nwhile the doctors recognize it as old Gastric Disturbance. Too much of our\nhotel food tastes like the second day of January or the fifth day of July.\nThat’s the whole thing in a few words, and unless the good hotels are\nnearer together we shall have to multiply our cemetery facilities.",
        "Poor hotels are responsible for lots of drunkards every year. The only\ntime I am tempted to soak my sorrows in rum is after I have read a\ndelusive bill of fare and eaten a broiled barn-hinge with gravy on it that\ntasted like the broth of perdition. It is then that the demon of\nintemperance and colic comes to me and, in siren tones, says: “Try our\nbourbon, with ’Polly Narius’ on the side.”",
        "Stern winter is the season in which to keep the eye peeled for the fragile\nlittle house plant. It is at that time that the coarse and brutal husband\ncarries the Scandinavian flower known as the Ole Ander, part way down the\ncellar, and allows it to fall the rest of the way. I carried a large Ole\nAndor up and down stairs for nine years, until the spring of 1880. That\nwas rather a backward spring, and a pale red cow, with one horn done up in\na French twist, ate the most of it as it stood on the porch.",
        "This cow was a total stranger to me. I had never done anything for her by\nwhich to win her esteem. It shows how Providence works through the\nhumblest means sometimes to accomplish a great good.",
        "I have tried many times to find the postoffice address of that lonely cow,\nso I might comfort her declining years, but she seemed to have melted away\ninto the bosom of space, for I cannot find her. Anyone knowing the\nwhereabouts of a pale red cow, with one horn done up in a French twist,\nand wearing a look of settled melancholy, will please communicate the same\nto me, as we have another Ole Ander that will just about fit her, I think,\nby spring.",
        "Bulbs may be wrapped in cotton and put in a cool place in the fall, and\nfed to the domestic animals in the spring. Geraniums should put on their\nbuffalo overcoats about the middle of November in our rigid northern\nclime, and in the spring they will have the same luxuriant foliage as the\ntropical hat-rack. Vines may be left in the room during the winter until\nthe furnace slips a cog and then you can pull them down and feed them to\nthe family horses. In changing your plants from the living rooms or\nelsewhere to the cellar in the fall, take great care to avoid injury to\nthe pot. I have experienced some very severe winters in my life, but I\nhave never seen the mercury so low that a flowerpot couldn’t struggle\nthrough and look fresh and robust in the spring. The longevity of the pot\nis surprising when we consider how much death there is all about it. I had\na large brown flower-pot once that originally held the germ of a calla\nlily. This lily emerged from the soil with the light of immortality in its\neye. It got up to where we began to be attached to it, and then it died.\nThen we put a plant in its place which was given us by a friend. I do not\nremember now what this plant was called, but I know it was sent to us\nwrapped up in a piece of moist brown paper, and half an hour later a dray\ndrove up to the house with the name of the plant itself. In the summer it\nrequired very little care, and in the winter I would cover the little\nthing up with its name, and it would be safe till spring. One evening we\nhad a free-for-all musicale at my house, and a corpulent friend of mine\ntried to climb it, and it died. (Tried to climb the plant, not the\nmusicale.) The plant yielded to the severe climb it. This joke now makes\nits debut for the first time before the world. Anyone who feels offended\nwith this joke may wreak his vengeance on a friend of mine named Sullivan,\nwho is passionately fond of having people wreak their vengeance on him.\nPeople having a large amount of unwreaked vengeance on hand will do well\nto give him a call before purchasing elsewhere.",
        "Will L. Visscher always made a specialty of being a peaceable man. He\nwould make most any sacrifice in order to secure general amnesty. I’ve\nknown him to go around six blocks out of his way, to avoid a stormy\ninterview with a belligerant dog. He was always very tender-hearted about\ndogs, especially the open-faced bulldog.",
        "But he had a queer experience years ago, in St. Jo, Missouri. He had been\ncity editor of the Kansas City Journal for some time, but one evening,\nwhile in the composing-room, the foreman told him that the place for the\ncity editor was down stairs, in his office. He therefore ordered Visscher\nto go down there. Visscher said he would do so later on, after he got\nfatigued with the composing-room and wanted change of scene.",
        "The foreman thereupon jumped on Mr. Visscher with a small pica wrought\niron side stick. Visscher allowed that he was a peaceable man, but entered\ninto the general chaos of double-leaded editorial, and hair and brass\ndashes, and dashes for liberty and heterogeneous “pi,” and foot-sticks and\nteeth, with great zeal. He succeeded in putting a large doric head on the\nforeman, and although he was a peaceable man, he went down to the office\nand got his discharge for disturbing the discipline of the office.",
        "He went to St. Jo the same day, and celebrated his debut into the town\nby a little game of what is known as “draw.” He was fortunate in “filling\nhis hand,” and while he was taking in the stakes, a young man from\nArkansas, who was in the game, nipped a two-dollar note in a quiet kind of\nway, which, however, was detected by Mr. V., who mentioned the matter at\nthe time. This maddened the Arkansas man, and later on he put one of his\nlong arms around Mr. Visscher so as to pinion him, and then smote him\nacross the brow with an instrument, known to science as “the brass\nknucks.” This irritated Mr. Visscher, and as soon as he had returned to\nconsciousness he remarked that, although it was rather an up-hill job in\nMissouri, he was trying to be a peaceable man. He then broke the leg of a\ncard-table over the head of the Arkansas man, and went to the doctor to\nget his own brow sewed on again.",
        "While he was sitting in the doctor’s office a friend of the Arkansas man\ncame in and asked him to please stand up while he knocked him down.\nVisscher opened a little dialogue with the man, and drew him into\nconversation till he could open a case of surgical instruments near by,\nthen he took out one of those knives that the surgeons use in removing the\nviscera from the leading gentleman at a post mortem.",
        "“Now,” said he, sharpening the knife on the stove-pipe and handing down a\njar containing alcohol with a tumor in it, “I am a peaceful man and don’t\nwant any fuss; but if you insist on a personal encounter, I will slice off\nfragments of your physiognomy at my leisure, and for twenty minutes I will\nfill this office with your favorite features. I make a specialty of being\na peaceable man, remember; but if you’ll just say the word, I’ll put\novercoat button-holes and eyelet-holes and crazy-quilts all over your\nsystem. If I’ve got to kill off the poker-players of St. Jo before I can\nhave any fun, I guess I might as well begin on you as on any one I know.”",
        "He then made a stab at the man and pinned his coat-tail to the door-frame.\nFear loaned the bad man strength, and, splitting the coat-tail, he fled,\ntaking little mementoes of the tumor-jar and shedding them in his flight.",
        "When Mr. Visscher went up to the Herald office soon after to get a job,\nhe was introduced casually to the foreman, who said:",
        "“Ah, this is the young man who licks the foreman of the paper he works on,\nis it? I am glad to meet you, Mr. Visscher. I am looking for a white-eyed\nson of a sea-cook who goes around over Missouri thumping the foremen of\nour leading journals. Come out into the ante-room, Mr. Visscher, till I\njar your back teeth loose and send you to the morgue in a gunny-sack.” Mr.\nVisscher repeated that he was trying to live in Missouri and be a\npeaceable man, but that if there was anything that he could do to make it\npleasant for the foreman, he would cheerfully do it.",
        "Mr. Visscher was a small man, but when he felt aggrieved about anything he\nwas very harassing to his adversary. They “clinched” and threw each other\nback and forth across the hall with great vigor. When they stopped for\nbreath, the foreman’s coat was pulled over his head and the bosom of Mr.\nVisscher’s shirt was hanging on the gas-jet. There were also two front\nteeth on the floor unaccounted for.",
        "Visscher pinned on his shirt-bosom and said he was a peaceable man, but if\nthe custom seemed to demand four fights in one day, he would try to\nconform to any local usage of the city. Wherever he went, he wanted to\nfall right into line and be one of the party.",
        "When he got well he was employed on the Herald, and for four years\nedited the amnesty column of the paper successfully.",
