        "Having in the former book clearly set forth the character, manners,\nand customs of the British nation, and having collected and\nexplained everything which could redound to its credit or glory; an\nattention to order now requires that, in this second part, we\nshould employ our pen in pointing out those particulars in which it\nseems to transgress the line of virtue and commendation; having\nfirst obtained leave to speak the truth, without which history not\nonly loses its authority, but becomes undeserving of its very name.\nFor the painter who professes to imitate nature, loses his\nreputation, if, by indulging his fancy, he represents only those\nparts of the subject which best suit him.",
        "Since, therefore, no man is born without faults, and he is esteemed\nthe best whose errors are the least, let the wise man consider\neverything human as connected with himself; for in worldly affairs\nthere is no perfect happiness under heaven.  Evil borders upon\ngood, and vices are confounded with virtues; as the report of good\nqualities is delightful to a well-disposed mind, so the relation of\nthe contrary should not be offensive.  The natural disposition of\nthis nation might have been corrupted and perverted by long exile\nand poverty; for as poverty extinguisheth many faults, so it often\ngenerates failings that are contrary to virtue.",
