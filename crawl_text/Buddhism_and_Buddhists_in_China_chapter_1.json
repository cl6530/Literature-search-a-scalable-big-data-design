        "This volume is the third to be published of a series on “The World’s\nLiving Religions,” projected in 1920 by the Board of Missionary\nPreparation of the Foreign Missions Conference of North America. The\nseries seeks to introduce Western readers to the real religious life of\neach great national area of the non-Christian world.",
        "Buddhism is a religion which must be viewed from many angles. Its\noriginal form, as preached by Gautama in India and developed in the\nearly years succeeding, and as embodied in the sacred literature of\nearly Buddhism, is not representative of the actual Buddhism of any land\ntoday. The faithful student of Buddhist literature would be as far\nremoved from understanding the working activities of a busy center of\nBuddhism in Burmah, Tibet or China today as a student of patristic\nliterature would be from appreciating the Christian life of London or\nNew York City.",
        "Moreover Buddhism, like Christianity, has been affected by national\nconditions. It has developed at least three markedly different types,\nrequiring, therefore, as many distinct volumes of this series for its\nfair interpretation and presentation. The volume on the Buddhism of\nSouthern Asia by Professor Kenneth J. Saunders was published in May,\n1923; this volume on the Buddhism of China by Professor Hodous will be\nthe second to appear; a third on the Buddhism of Japan, to be written by\nDr. R. C. Armstrong, will be published in 1924. Each of these is needed\nin order that the would be student of Buddhism as practiced in those\ncountries should be given a true, impressive and friendly picture of\nwhat he will meet.",
        "A missionary no less than a professional student of Buddhism needs to\napproach that religion with a real appreciation of what it aims to do\nfor its people and does do. No one can come into contact with the best\nthat Buddhism offers without being impressed by its serenity, assurance\nand power.",
        "Professor Hodous has written this volume on Buddhism in China out of the\nripe experience and continuing studies of sixteen years of missionary\nservice in Foochow, the chief city of Fukien Province, China, one of the\nimportant centers of Buddhism. His local studies were supplemented by\nthe results of broader research and study in northern China. No other\navailable writer on the subject has gone so far as he in reproducing the\nactual thinking of a trained Buddhist mind in regard to the fundamentals\nof religion. At the same time he has taken pains to exhibit and to\ninterpret the religious life of the peasant as affected by Buddhism. He\nhas sought to be absolutely fair to Buddhism, but still to express his\nown conviction that the best that is in Buddhism is given far more\nadequate expression in Christianity.",
        "The purpose of each volume in this series is impressionistic rather than\ndefinitely educational. They are not textbooks for the formal study of\nBuddhism, but introductions to its study. They aim to kindle interest\nand to direct the activity of the awakened student along sound lines.\nFor further study each volume amply provides through directions and\nliterature in the appendices. It seeks to help the student to\ndiscriminate, to think in terms of a devotee of Buddhism when he\ncompares that religion with Christianity. It assumes, however, that\nChristianity is the broader and deeper revelation of God and the world\nof today.",
        "Buddhism in China undoubtedly includes among its adherents many\nhigh-minded, devout, and earnest souls who live an idealistic life.\nChristianity ought to make a strong appeal to such minds, taking from\nthem none of the joy or assurance or devotion which they possess, but\npromoting a deeper, better balanced interpretation of the active world,\na nobler conception of God, a stronger sense of sinfulness and need, and\na truer idea of the full meaning of incarnation and revelation.",
        "It is our hope that this fresh contribution to the understanding of\nBuddhism as it is today may be found helpful to readers everywhere.",

        "The Committee of Reference and Counsel of the Foreign Missions\nConference of North America has authorized the publication of this\nseries. The author of each volume is alone responsible for the opinions\nexpressed, unless otherwise stated.",
