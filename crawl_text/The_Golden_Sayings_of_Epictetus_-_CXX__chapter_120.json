What Physician applies to men to come and be healed?\n(Though indeed I hear that the Physicians at Rome do nowadays\napply for patients—in my time they were applied to.) I apply to\nyou to come and hear that you are in evil case; that what\ndeserves your attention most is the last thing to gain it; that\nyou know not good from evil, and are in short a hapless wretch; a\nfine way to apply! though unless the words of the Philosopher\naffect you thus, speaker and speech are alike dead.",
