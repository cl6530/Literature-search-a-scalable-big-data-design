        "For several days the captain seemed very much out of humor.\nNothing went right, or fast enough for him.  He quarrelled with\nthe cook, and threatened to flog him for throwing wood on deck;\nand had a dispute with the mate about reeving a Spanish burton;\nthe mate saying that he was right, and had been taught how to do\nit by a man who was a sailor!  This, the captain took in dudgeon,\nand they were at sword’s points at once.  But his displeasure was\nchiefly turned against a large, heavy-moulded fellow from the\nMiddle States, who was called Sam.  This man hesitated in his speech,\nand was rather slow in his motions, but was a pretty good sailor,\nand always seemed to do his best; but the captain took a dislike\nto him, thought he was surly, and lazy; and “if you once give a\ndog a bad name\"–as the sailor-phrase is–\"he may as well jump\noverboard.” The captain found fault with everything this man did,\nand hazed him for dropping a marline-spike from the main-yard,\nwhere he was at work.  This, of course, was an accident, but it\nwas set down against him.  The captain was on board all day Friday,\nand everything went on hard and disagreeably.  “The more you drive\na man, the less he will do,” was as true with us as with any\nother people.  We worked late Friday night, and were turned-to\nearly Saturday morning.  About ten o’clock the captain ordered\nour new officer, Russell, who by this time had become thoroughly\ndisliked by all the crew, to get the gig ready to take him ashore.\nJohn, the Swede, was sitting in the boat alongside, and Russell\nand myself were standing by the main hatchway, waiting for the\ncaptain, who was down in the hold, where the crew were at work,\nwhen we heard his voice raised in violent dispute with somebody,\nwhether it was with the mate, or one of the crew, I could not\ntell; and then came blows and scuffling.  I ran to the side and\nbeckoned to John, who came up, and we leaned down the hatchway;\nand though we could see no one, yet we knew that the captain had\nthe advantage, for his voice was loud and clear–",
        "“You see your condition! You see your condition! Will you ever\ngive me any more of your jaw?”  No answer; and then came\nwrestling and heaving, as though the man was trying to turn him.\n“You may as well keep still, for I have got you,” said the captain.\nThen came the question, “Will you ever give me any more of your jaw?”",
        "“I never gave you any, sir,” said Sam; for it was his voice that\nwe heard, though low and half choked.",
        "“That’s not what I ask you.  Will you ever be impudent to me again?”",
        "“I never have been, sir,” said Sam.",
        "“Answer my question, or I’ll make a spread eagle of you! I’ll\nflog you, by G–d.”",
        "“I’m no negro slave,” said Sam.",
        "“Then I’ll make you one,” said the captain; and he came to the \nhatchway, and sprang on deck, threw off his coat, and rolling\nup his sleeves, called out to the mate–\"Seize that man up, Mr.\nA––-!  Seize him up!  Make a spread eagle of him!  I’ll teach\nyou all who is master aboard!”",
        "The crew and officers followed the captain up the hatchway,\nand after repeated orders the mate laid hold of Sam, who made\nno resistance, and carried him to the gangway.",
        "“What are you going to flog that man for, sir?” said John, the\nSwede, to the captain.",
        "Upon hearing this, the captain turned upon him, but knowing\nhim to be quick and resolute, he ordered the steward to bring the\nirons, and calling upon Russell to help him, went up to John.",
        "“Let me alone,” said John.  “I’m willing to be put in irons.  You\nneed not use any force;” and putting out his hands, the captain\nslipped the irons on, and sent him aft to the quarter-deck.  Sam by\nthis time was seized up, as it is called, that is, placed against the\nshrouds, with his wrists made fast to the shrouds, his jacket off,\nand his back exposed.  The captain stood on the break of the deck,\na few feet from him, and a little raised, so as to have a good swing\nat him, and held in his hand the bight of a thick, strong rope.\nThe officers stood round, and the crew grouped together in the waist.\nAll these preparations made me feel sick and almost faint, angry\nand excited as I was.  A man–a human being, made in God’s likeness–\nfastened up and flogged like a beast!  A man, too, whom I had lived\nwith and eaten with for months, and knew almost as well as a brother.\nThe first and almost uncontrollable impulse was resistance.  But what\nwas to be done?  The time for it had gone by.  The two best men were\nfast, and there were only two beside myself, and a small boy of\nten or twelve years of age.  And then there were (beside the\ncaptain) three officers, steward, agent and clerk.  But beside\nthe numbers, what is there for sailors to do? If they resist, it is\nmutiny; and if they succeed, and take the vessel, it is piracy.\nIf they ever yield again, their punishment must come; and if they\ndo not yield, they are pirates for life.  If a sailor resist his\ncommander, he resists the law, and piracy or submission are his\nonly alternatives.  Bad as it was, it must be borne.  It is what\na sailor ships for.  Swinging the rope over his head, and bending\nhis body so as to give it full force, the captain brought it down\nupon the poor fellow’s back.  Once, twice–six times.  “Will you\never give me any more of your jaw?”  The man writhed with pain,\nbut said not a word.  Three times more.  This was too much, and he\nmuttered something which I could not hear; this brought as many\nmore as the man could stand; when the captain ordered him to be\ncut down, and to go forward.",
        "“Now for you,” said the captain, making up to John and taking\nhis irons off.  As soon as he was loose, he ran forward to the\nforecastle.  “Bring that man aft,” shouted the captain.  The second\nmate, who had been a shipmate of John’s, stood still in the waist,\nand the mate walked slowly forward; but our third officer, anxious\nto show his zeal, sprang forward over the windlass, and laid hold\nof John; but he soon threw him from him.  At this moment I would\nhave given worlds for the power to help the poor fellow; but it\nwas all in vain.  The captain stood on the quarter-deck, bare-headed,\nhis eyes flashing with rage, and his face as red as blood, swinging\nthe rope, and calling out to his officers, “Drag him aft!–Lay hold\nof him!  I’ll sweeten him!” etc., etc.  The mate now went forward\nand told John quietly to go aft; and he, seeing resistance in vain,\nthrew the blackguard third mate from him; said he would go aft\nof himself; that they should not drag him; and went up to the\ngangway and held out his hands; but as soon as the captain began\nto make him fast, the indignity was too much, and he began to\nresist; but the mate and Russell holding him, he was soon seized\nup.  When he was made fast, he turned to the captain, who stood\nturning up his sleeves and getting ready for the blow, and asked\nhim what he was to be flogged for.  “Have I ever refused my duty,\nsir?  Have you ever known me to hang back, or to be insolent, or\nnot to know my work?”",
        "“No,” said the captain, “it is not that that I flog you for; I flog\nyou for your interference–for asking questions.”",
        "“Can’t a man ask a question here without being flogged?”",
        "“No,” shouted the captain; “nobody shall open his mouth aboard\nthis vessel, but myself;” and began laying the blows upon his back,\nswinging half round between each blow, to give it full effect.\nAs he went on, his passion increased, and he danced about the deck,\ncalling out as he swung the rope,–\"If you want to know what I\nflog you for, I’ll tell you.  It’s because I like to do it!–because\nI like to do it!–It suits me!  That’s what I do it for!”",
        "The man writhed under the pain, until he could endure it no\nlonger, when he called out, with an exclamation more common\namong foreigners than with us–\"Oh, Jesus Christ!  Oh, Jesus\nChrist!”",
        "“Don’t call on Jesus Christ,” shouted the captain; “he can’t help\nyou.  Call on Captain T––-, he’s the man!  He can help you!\nJesus Christ can’t help you now!”",
        "At these words, which I never shall forget, my blood ran cold.\nI could look on no longer.  Disgusted, sick, and horror-struck,\nI turned away and leaned over the rail, and looked down into the\nwater.  A few rapid thoughts of my own situation, and of the\nprospect of future revenge, crossed my mind; but the falling of the\nblows and the cries of the man called me back at once.  At length\nthey ceased, and turning round, I found that the mate, at a signal\nfrom the captain had cut him down.  Almost doubled up with pain,\nthe man walked slowly forward, and went down into the forecastle.\nEvery one else stood still at his post, while the captain, swelling\nwith rage and with the importance of his achievement, walked the\nquarter-deck, and at each turn, as he came forward, calling out to\nus,–\"You see your condition!  You see where I’ve got you all, and\nyou know what to expect!\"–\"You’ve been mistaken in me–you didn’t \nknow what I was!  Now you know what I am!\"–\"I’ll make you toe the\nmark, every soul of you, or I’ll flog you all, fore and aft, from the\nboy, up!\"–\"You’ve got a driver over you!  Yes, a slave-driver–\na negro-driver! I’ll see who’ll tell me he isn’t a negro slave!\"\nWith this and the like matter, equally calculated to quiet us, and to\nallay any apprehensions of future trouble, he entertained us for\nabout ten minutes, when he went below.  Soon after, John came aft,\nwith his bare back covered with stripes and wales in every direction,\nand dreadfully swollen, and asked the steward to ask the captain to\nlet him have some salve, or balsam, to put upon it.  “No,” said\nthe captain, who heard him from below; “tell him to put his shirt\non; that’s the best thing for him; and pull me ashore in the boat.\nNobody is going to lay-up on board this vessel.”  He then called to\nMr. Russell to take those men and two others in the boat, and pull\nhim ashore.  I went for one.  The two men could hardly bend their\nbacks, and the captain called to them to “give way,” “give way!” but\nfinding they did their best, he let them alone.  The agent was in\nthe stern sheets, but during the whole pull–a league or more–not\na word was spoken.  We landed; the captain, agent, and officer went\nup to the house, and left us with the boat.  I, and the man with me,\nstaid near the boat, while John and Sam walked slowly away, and sat\ndown on the rocks.  They talked some time together, but at length\nseparated, each sitting alone.  I had some fears of John.  He was\na foreigner, and violently tempered, and under suffering; and he\nhad his knife with him, and the captain was to come down alone\nto the boat.  But nothing happened; and we went quietly on board.\nThe captain was probably armed, and if either of them had lifted a\nhand against him, they would have had nothing before them but flight,\nand starvation in the woods of California, or capture by the soldiers\nand Indian blood-hounds, whom the offer of twenty dollars would\nhave set upon them.",
        "After the day’s work was done, we went down into the forecastle,\nand ate our plain supper; but not a word was spoken.  It was\nSaturday night; but there was no song–no “sweethearts and wives.\"\nA gloom was over everything.  The two men lay in their berths,\ngroaning with pain, and we all turned in, but for myself, not to\nsleep.  A sound coming now and then from the berths of the two\nmen showed that they were awake, as awake they must have been,\nfor they could hardly lie in one posture a moment; the dim,\nswinging lamp of the forecastle shed its light over the dark hole\nin which we lived; and many and various reflections and purposes\ncoursed through my mind.  I thought of our situation, living under a\ntyranny; of the character of the country we were in; of the length\nof the voyage, and of the uncertainty attending our return to\nAmerica; and then, if we should return, of the prospect of obtaining\njustice and satisfaction for these poor men; and vowed that if God\nshould ever give me the means, I would do something to redress the\ngrievances and relieve the sufferings of that poor class of beings,\nof whom I then was one.",
        "The next day was Sunday.  We worked as usual, washing decks, etc.,\nuntil breakfast-time.  After breakfast, we pulled the captain\nashore, and finding some hides there which had been brought down\nthe night before, he ordered me to stay ashore and watch them,\nsaying that the boat would come again before night.  They left me,\nand I spent a quiet day on the hill, eating dinner with the three\nmen at the little house.  Unfortunately, they had no books, and\nafter talking with them and walking about, I began to grow tired\nof doing nothing.  The little brig, the home of so much hardship\nand suffering, lay in the offing, almost as far as one could see;\nand the only other thing which broke the surface of the great bay\nwas a small, desolate-looking island, steep and conical, of a clayey\nsoil, and without the sign of vegetable life upon it; yet which had\na peculiar and melancholy interest to me, for on the top of it were\nburied the remains of an Englishman, the commander of a small merchant\nbrig, who died while lying in this port.  It was always a solemn and\ninteresting spot to me.  There it stood, desolate, and in the midst\nof desolation; and there were the remains of one who died and was\nburied alone and friendless.  Had it been a common burying-place,\nit would have been nothing.  The single body corresponded well with\nthe solitary character of everything around.  It was the only thing\nin California from which I could ever extract anything like poetry.\nThen, too, the man died far from home; without a friend near him;\nby poison, it was suspected, and no one to inquire into it; and\nwithout proper funeral rites; the mate, (as I was told,) glad to\nhave him out of the way, hurrying him up the hill and into the ground,\nwithout a word or a prayer.",
        "I looked anxiously for a boat, during the latter part of the\nafternoon, but none came; until toward sundown, when I saw a\nspeck on the water, and as it drew near, I found it was the\ngig, with the captain. The hides, then, were not to go off.\nThe captain came up the hill, with a man, bringing my monkey\njacket and a blanket.  He looked pretty black, but inquired\nwhether I had enough to eat; told me to make a house out of\nthe hides, and keep myself warm, as I should have to sleep\nthere among them, and to keep good watch over them.  I got\na moment to speak to the man who brought my jacket.",
        "“How do things go aboard?” said I.",
        "“Bad enough,” said he; “hard work and not a kind word spoken.”",
        "“What,” said I, “have you been at work all day?”",
        "“Yes! no more Sunday for us.  Everything has been moved in the\nhold, from stem to stern, and from the waterways to the keelson.”",
        "I went up to the house to supper.  We had frijoles, (the perpetual\nfood of the Californians, but which, when well cooked, are the best\nbean in the world,) coffee made of burnt wheat, and hard bread.\nAfter our meal, the three men sat down by the light of a tallow\ncandle, with a pack of greasy Spanish cards, to the favorite game\nof “treinta uno,” a sort of Spanish “everlasting.” I left them and\nwent out to take up my bivouack among the hides.  It was now dark;\nthe vessel was hidden from sight, and except the three men in the\nhouse, there was not a living soul within a league.  The coati\n(a wild animal of a nature and appearance between that of the fox\nand the wolf) set up their sharp, quick bark, and two owls, at the\nend of two distant points running out into the bay, on different\nsides of the hills where I lay, kept up their alternate, dismal notes.\nI had heard the sound before at night, but did not know what it was,\nuntil one of the men, who came down to look at my quarters, told\nme it was the owl.  Mellowed by the distance, and heard alone, at\nnight, I thought it was the most melancholy, boding sound I had\never heard.  Through nearly all the night they kept it up, answering\none another slowly, at regular intervals.  This was relieved by the\nnoisy coati, some of which came quite near to my quarters, and\nwere not very pleasant neighbors.  The next morning, before sunrise,\nthe long-boat came ashore, and the hides were taken off.",
        "We lay at San Pedro about a week, engaged in taking off hides\nand in other labors, which had now become our regular duties.\nI spent one more day on the hill, watching a quantity of hides\nand goods, and this time succeeded in finding a part of a volume\nof Scott’s Pirate, in a corner of the house; but it failed me at a\nmost interesting moment, and I betook myself to my acquaintances on\nshore, and from them learned a good deal about the customs of the\ncountry, the harbors, etc.  This, they told me, was a worse harbor\nthan Santa Barbara, for south-easters; the bearing of the headland\nbeing a point and a half more to windward, and it being so shallow\nthat the sea broke often as far out as where we lay at anchor.\nThe gale from which we slipped at Santa Barbara, had been so bad a\none here, that the whole bay, for a league out, was filled with the\nfoam of the breakers, and seas actually broke over the Dead Man’s\nisland.  The Lagoda was lying there, and slipped at the first alarm,\nand in such haste that she was obliged to leave her launch behind her\nat anchor.  The little boat rode it out for several hours, pitching at\nher anchor, and standing with her stern up almost perpendicularly.\nThe men told me that they watched her till towards night, when\nshe snapped her cable and drove up over the breakers, high and\ndry upon the beach.",
        "On board the Pilgrim, everything went on regularly, each one \ntrying to get along as smoothly as possible; but the comfort of\nthe voyage was evidently at an end.  “That is a long lane which\nhas no turning\"–-\"Every dog must have his day, and mine will\ncome by-and-by\"–and the like proverbs, were occasionally quoted;\nbut no one spoke of any probable end to the voyage, or of Boston,\nor anything of the kind; or if he did, it was only to draw out the\nperpetual, surly reply from his shipmate–\"Boston, is it? You may\nthank your stars if you ever see that place.  You had better have\nyour back sheathed, and your head coppered, and your feet shod,\nand make out your log for California for life!” or else something of\nthis kind–\"Before you get to Boston the hides will wear the hair\noff your head, and you’ll take up all your wages in clothes, and\nwon’t have enough left to buy a wig with!”",
        "The flogging was seldom if ever alluded to by us, in the forecastle.\nIf any one was inclined to talk about it, the others, with a delicacy\nwhich I hardly expected to find among them, always stopped him,\nor turned the subject.  But the behavior of the two men who were\nflogged toward one another showed a delicacy and a sense of honor,\nwhich would have been worthy of admiration in the highest walks of\nlife.  Sam knew that the other had suffered solely on his account,\nand in all his complaints, he said that if he alone had been flogged,\nit would have been nothing; but that he never could see that man\nwithout thinking what had been the means of bringing that disgrace\nupon him; and John never, by word or deed, let anything escape him\nto remind the other that it was by interfering to save his shipmate,\nthat he had suffered.",
        "Having got all our spare room filled with hides, we hove up our anchor\nand made sail for San Diego.  In no operation can the disposition of\na crew be discovered better than in getting under weigh.",
        "Where things are “done with a will,” every one is like a cat aloft:\nsails are loosed in an instant; each one lays out his strength on\nhis handspike, and the windlass goes briskly round with the loud\ncry of “Yo heave ho! Heave and pawl! Heave hearty ho!”  But with us,\nat this time, it was all dragging work.  No one went aloft beyond\nhis ordinary gait, and the chain came slowly in over the windlass.\nThe mate, between the knight-heads, exhausted all his official\nrhetoric, in calls of “Heave with a will!\"–\"Heave hearty, men!–\nheave hearty!\"–\"Heave and raise the dead!\"–\"Heave, and away!\"\netc., etc.; but it would not do.  Nobody broke his back or his\nhand-spike by his efforts.  And when the cat-tackle-fall was strung\nalong, and all hands–cook, steward, and all–laid hold, to cat the\nanchor, instead of the lively song of “Cheerily, men!” in which all\nhands join in the chorus, we pulled a long, heavy, silent pull,\nand–as sailors say a song is as good as ten men–the anchor came\nto the cat-head pretty slowly.  “Give us ’Cheerily!’” said the\nmate; but there was no “cheerily” for us, and we did without it.\nThe captain walked the quarterdeck, and said not a word.  He must\nhave seen the change, but there was nothing which he could notice\nofficially.",
        "We sailed leisurely down the coast before a light fair wind, keeping\nthe land well aboard, and saw two other missions, looking like blocks\nof white plaster, shining in the distance; one of which, situated on\nthe top of a high hill, was San Juan Campestrano, under which vessels\nsometimes come to anchor, in the summer season, and take off hides.\nThe most distant one was St. Louis Rey, which the third mate said\nwas only fifteen miles from San Diego.  At sunset on the second day,\nwe had a large and well wooded headland directly before us, behind\nwhich lay the little harbor of San Diego.  We were becalmed off this\npoint all night, but the next morning, which was Saturday, the 14th\nof March, having a good breeze, we stood round the point, and hauling\nour wind, brought the little harbor, which is rather the outlet of a\nsmall river, right before us.  Every one was anxious to get a view\nof the new place.  A chain of high hills, beginning at the point,\n(which was on our larboard hand, coming in,) protected the harbor\non the north and west, and ran off into the interior as far as the\neye could reach.  On the other sides, the land was low, and green,\nbut without trees.  The entrance is so narrow as to admit but one\nvessel at a time, the current swift, and the channel runs so near to\na low stony point that the ship’s sides appeared almost to touch it.\nThere was no town in sight, but on the smooth sand beach, abreast,\nand within a cable’s length of which three vessels lay moored,\nwere four large houses, built of rough boards, and looking like the\ngreat barns in which ice is stored on the borders of the large ponds\nnear Boston; with piles of hides standing round them, and men in\nred shirts and large straw hats, walking in and out of the doors.\nThese were the hide-houses.  Of the vessels: one, a short, clumsy,\nlittle hermaphrodite brig, we recognized as our old acquaintance,\nthe Loriotte; another, with sharp bows and raking masts, newly painted\nand tarred, and glittering in the morning sun, with the blood-red\nbanner and cross of St. George at her peak, was the handsome Ayacucho.\nThe third was a large ship, with top-gallant-masts housed, and sails\nunbent, and looking as rusty and worn as two years’ “hide-droghing” could\nmake her.  This was the Lagoda.  As we drew near, carried rapidly\nalong by the current, we overhauled our chain, and clewed up the\ntopsails.  “Let go the anchor!” said the captain but either there was\nnot chain enough forward of the windlass, or the anchor went down\nfoul, or we had too much headway on, for it did not bring us up.\n“Pay out chain!” shouted the captain; and we gave it to her; but it\nwould not do.  Before the other anchor could be let go, we drifted\ndown, broadside on, and went smash into the Lagoda.  Her crew were\nat breakfast in the forecastle, and the cook, seeing us coming,\nrushed out of his galley, and called up the officers and men.",
        "Fortunately no great harm was done.  Her jib-boom ran between our\nfore and main masts, carrying away some of our rigging, and breaking\ndown the rail.  She lost her martingale.  This brought us up, and as\nthey paid out chain, we swung clear of them, and let go the other\nanchor; but this had as bad luck as the first, for, before any one\nperceived it, we were drifting on to the Loriotte.  The captain now\ngave out his orders rapidly and fiercely, sheeting home the topsails,\nand backing and filling the sails, in hope of starting or clearing\nthe anchors; but it was all in vain, and he sat down on the rail,\ntaking it very leisurely, and calling out to Captain Nye, that he was\ncoming to pay him a visit.  We drifted fairly into the Loriotte, her\nlarboard bow into our starboard quarter, carrying away a part of our\nstarboard quarter railing, and breaking off her larboard bumpkin,\nand one or two stanchions above the deck.  We saw our handsome\nsailor, Jackson, on the forecastle, with the Sandwich Islanders,\nworking away to get us clear.  After paying out chain, we swung\nclear, but our anchors were no doubt afoul of hers.  We manned\nthe windlass, and hove, and hove away, but to no purpose.\nSometimes we got a little upon the cable, but a good surge would take\nit all back again.  We now began to drift down toward the Ayacucho,\nwhen her boat put off and brought her commander, Captain Wilson,\non board.  He was a short, active, well-built man, between fifty\nand sixty years of age; and being nearly twenty years older than\nour captain, and a thorough seaman, he did not hesitate to give his\nadvice, and from giving advice, he gradually came to taking the\ncommand; ordering us when to heave and when to pawl, and backing\nand filling the topsails, setting and taking in jib and trysail,\nwhenever he thought best.  Our captain gave a few orders, but as\nWilson generally countermanded them, saying, in an easy, fatherly\nkind of way, “Oh no! Captain T––-, you don’t want the jib on\nher,” or “it isn’t time yet to heave!” he soon gave it up.  We had no\nobjections to this state of things, for Wilson was a kind old man,\nand had an encouraging and pleasant way of speaking to us, which\nmade everything go easily.  After two or three hours of constant\nlabor at the windlass, heaving and “Yo ho!\"-ing with all our might,\nwe brought up an anchor, with the Loriotte’s small bower fast to it,\nHaving cleared this and let it go, and cleared our hawse, we soon\ngot our other anchor, which had dragged half over the harbor.\n“Now,” said Wilson, “I’ll find you a good berth;” and setting both\nthe topsails, he carried us down, and brought us to anchor, in\nhandsome style, directly abreast of the hide-house which we were to \nuse.  Having done this, he took his leave, while we furled the sails,\nand got our breakfast, which was welcome to us, for we had worked\nhard, and it was nearly twelve o’clock.  After breakfast, and until\nnight, we were employed in getting out the boats and mooring ship.",
        "After supper, two of us took the captain on board the Lagoda.\nAs he came alongside, he gave his name, and the mate, in the\ngangway, called out to the captain down the companion-way–\n“Captain T––- has come aboard, sir!”  “Has he brought his brig\nwith him?” said the rough old fellow, in a tone which made itself\nheard fore and aft.  This mortified our captain a little, and it\nbecame a standing joke among us for the rest of the voyage.\nThe captain went down into the cabin, and we walked forward and\nput our heads down the forecastle, where we found the men at supper,\n“Come down, shipmates! Come down!” said they, as soon as they\nsaw us; and we went down, and found a large, high forecastle, well\nlighted; and a crew of twelve or fourteen men, eating out of their\nkids and pans, and drinking their tea, and talking and laughing,\nall as independent and easy as so many “wood-sawyer’s clerks.\"\nThis looked like comfort and enjoyment, compared with the dark\nlittle forecastle, and scanty, discontented crew of the brig.\nIt was Saturday night; they had got through with their work for the\nweek; and being snugly moored, had nothing to do until Monday, again.\nAfter two years’ hard service, they had seen the worst, and all,\nof California;–had got their cargo nearly stowed, and expected to\nsail in a week or two, for Boston.  We spent an hour or more with\nthem, talking over California matters, until the word was passed–\n“Pilgrims, away!” and we went back with our captain.  They were\na hardy, but intelligent crew; a little roughened, and their clothes\npatched and old, from California wear; all able seamen, and between\nthe ages of twenty and thirty-five.  They inquired about our vessel,\nthe usage, etc., and were not a little surprised at the story of\nthe flogging.  They said there were often difficulties in vessels\non the coast, and sometimes knock-downs and fightings, but they\nhad never heard before of a regular seizing-up and flogging.\n“Spread-eagles” were a new kind of bird in California.",
        "Sunday, they said, was always given in San Diego, both at the\nhide-houses and on board the vessels, a large number usually\ngoing up to the town, on liberty.
