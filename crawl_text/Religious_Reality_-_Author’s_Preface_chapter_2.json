        "This book has grown out of the writer’s experience in preparing men\nand officers in military hospitals for Confirmation. It represents, in\na considerably expanded but–as it is hoped–still simple form, the\nkind of things which he would have wished to say to them, and to\nothers with whom he was brought into contact, if he had had more time\nand opportunity than was usually afforded him. It seemed necessary to\nwrite the book, because there did not appear to be in existence any\nreasonably short book on similar lines which covered the ground of\nChristian faith and practice as a whole, and which approached the\nsubject from the point of view which seems to the writer to be the\nmost real.",
        "The writer is consciously indebted in the first chapter to the\ndiscussion of our Lord’s teaching and character in Dr. T. B. Glover’s\nfascinating book, The Jesus of History. It is possible that there\nare other and unconscious obligations which have been overlooked. Here\nand there acknowledgment is made in footnotes, and an occasional\nphrase, “lifted” from some other writer, has been placed in inverted\ncommas.",
        "In Chapter VIII. of Part I. the author has echoed the thought, and to\na certain extent the wording, of parts of his own essay on “The\nPrinciple of Authority” in Foundations.",
        "For help in the correction of the proofs, and for criticisms and\nsuggestions which have led to numerous modifications and improvements\nin matters of detail, the thanks of the writer are due to various\nfriends, and more particularly to his brother, Lieutenant A. C.\nRawlinson, of the Queen’s Own Oxfordshire Hussars; to the Rev. Austin\nThompson, Vicar of S. Peter’s, Eaton Square; and to the Rev. Leonard\nHodgson, Vice-Principal of S. Edmund Hall, Oxford.",
