        "The really essential thing is the Communion. There may be minor\noutward differences as to the manner of its celebration: you shall\nfind in one parish a tradition of Puritan bareness, in another a full\nand rich ceremonial symbolism, with lights and vestments. A man may\nhave his personal preferences, but it is a mistake to attach undue\nimportance either to the presence or to the absence of the external\nadjuncts of worship. What matters is the Body and Blood of Christ.",
        "A man must have his own regular rule with regard to Communion. To\ncommunicate spasmodically or upon impulse at irregular intervals is\nnot the way to build up a stable Christian character. Where\ncircumstances make possible the leading of a fairly regular life and\ngive adequate opportunity for preparation beforehand, weekly communion\nis the best rule. Where this is not possible, a fortnightly or even a\nmonthly rule may in particular cases be the best.",
        "Preparation for Communion should be real, but need not be elaborate.\nIt should be made overnight, and should include a review of the period\nsince the last Communion was made, prayers for pardon and new\nresolves, if possible a short meditation on the essential meaning of\nthe Sacrament, and the selection of some particular theme to be the\nfocus of intercession at the service itself.",
        "At the actual service it is well to arrive early, with a few moments\nto spare for quiet and recollected prayer before the Liturgy begins.\nThe first part of the service is preparatory. Any pauses or intervals\nshould be filled up by private prayers.[Footnote: Forms and\nsuggestions which, may be used by those who find them helpful are\nprovided for this purpose in any manual of devotion.] From the moment\nof consecration until the end of the service the mind should be\nconcentrated as far as possible upon the thought of Christ’s realized\nPresence. A man should go up to the altar to receive Communion as one\ndesiring to meet his Lord and to be renewed in Him, returning\nsubsequently to his place to render thanks for so great a Gift. When\nthe service is over it is best not to hurry out of church, but to\nlinger for further thanksgiving and prayer as occasion serves.",
        "It is an ancient rule or custom of the Church to receive Holy\nCommunion fasting, giving precedence to the food of the soul over that\nof the body. To insist rigidly upon such a rule in any and every set\nof circumstances is a piece of unintelligent and unchristian legalism:\nbut many persons are of opinion that to observe it wherever it is\nreasonably possible to do so makes for reality. There is a real value\nin the element of asceticism and self-discipline involved in the\neffort to rise early and come fasting to church: and the fast may be\ninterpreted as a kind of outward sacrament of the inward reality of\nspiritual preparation–a preparation of the body corresponding to the\npreparation of the soul, It is, moreover, an advantage of the early\nmorning hour that the mind is undistracted by the occupations and\ndiversions of the day. For all these reasons the early morning\nCommunion is to be preferred to Communion at a later hour.",
        "Whether a man is a weekly communicant or not, he should in any case\nbe present as a worshipper at Holy Communion Sunday by Sunday, and\nshould regard attendance at the weekly Eucharist as the most essential\npart of church-going. No one who makes it a rule of his life to be\npresent on Sundays and other festivals of the Church at Holy Communion\never has cause to regret having done so.",
        "A man who for any reason (_e.g. by the nature of his employment) is\ndebarred from attending regularly on Sundays should, if possible,\nsecure an opportunity of regular attendance at Holy Communion on a\nweek-day. There are usually churches to be found, at least in the\ntowns, which have an early morning Eucharist daily throughout the\nweek: and advantage can also be taken of this if on any particular\noccasion the regular Sunday Communion has been missed. If neither\nSunday nor week-day opportunities are available, the need should be\nmet by what is known as “spiritual communion”: that is to say, a man\nshould read over the Liturgy in private, unite himself in spirit with\nthe Eucharist as celebrated in the particular church with which he\nhappens to be most familiar (as representing for him the worship of\nthe Church Universal), and pray that he may receive the spiritual\nbenefits of Communion though deprived for the time being of the actual\nSacrament. Apart from the “early service,” which is now almost\nuniversal, schemes of worship upon Sunday mornings vary in different\nparishes. In some churches Matins and Litany are sung and a sermon\npreached, a late Eucharist without music being commonly celebrated\nabout noon: in other parishes Matins is said quietly without music at\na comparatively early hour, and the Eucharist is solemnly sung, with a\nsermon, as the principal service of the forenoon, usually without more\nthan a very limited number of communicants, partly because if the bulk\nof the congregation communicate at a sung Eucharist the service\nbecomes intolerably long, and partly because the majority of those\ndesiring to receive Communion have done so fasting at an earlier hour.",
        "In large towns a man can usually find churches of either type\naccording to his preference. In “single-church areas” he ought for the\nsake of fellowship and good example to conform, as a rule, to what is\ncustomary. It is desirable, in a general way, to be identified with\nthe corporate worship of the parish: but it is worth remarking that,\napart from the weight due to this general consideration, there is no\nparticular sacredness about the hour of eleven o’clock, and a man who\nhas communicated before breakfast, and perhaps contemplates\nattendance, later on, at Evensong, may not unreasonably feel justified\nin devoting the forenoon of Sunday (which is usually his solitary\nmorning’s leisure in the week) to other purposes than those of\nworship. If the preacher is worth listening to (which is not\ninvariably the case) it is a good thing to go and hear him: and it is\nwell, therefore, to attend one or other of the services (morning or\nevening) at which a sermon is preached. But it is not essential to\nattend both: and the question may be raised whether one sermon a\nSunday is not as much as most men can profitably digest. A sermon is\nin any case (except at the Eucharist) a detachable appendix to a\nChurch service; and it is both possible and legitimate either to\nattend the service and leave the church before the sermon, or to avoid\nthe service and come in time to hear the sermon, according to\npreference or opportunity.",
        "As regards external details of observance, kneeling, and not\nsquatting, should be the attitude adopted for prayer. It is customary\nto turn eastwards for the Creed, and in some churches, though not in\nothers, to kneel at the reference to the Incarnation in the course of\nthe Nicene Creed. It is also a common practice in some churches to\ngenuflect (_i.e. to drop for a moment upon one knee) on rising from\none’s place to go up to the altar to communicate, in reverence for the\nBlessed Sacrament. A man should adapt his personal usage in these\nminor details to whatever appears to be customary in the particular\nchurch in which he is worshipping.",
        "It is often extremely difficult for the clergy to know personally the\nmen of their congregations, since it is rare in most neighbourhoods\nfor the men to be at home during the hours when it is possible for the\nclergy to visit. In these circumstances a man ought to be willing to\ntake the initiative in making himself known to the clergy of his\nparish, and to co-operate as far as possible in any effort which may\nbe made, through parochial Church Councils or otherwise, to develop\nthe spirit of fellowship in a congregation. There is very often about\nAnglican Church worship a stiffness and frigidity which badly needs to\nbe broken down. Appropriated seats, where they exist, are a particular\ncurse, and anything which can be done in the way of abandoning chosen\nseats, even if “bought and paid for,” to strangers in the interests of\ncharity is a real piece of Christian service. A stranger ought not to\nbe made to feel uncomfortable, but to be welcomed in every possible\nway. The ideal is that every church, in every part of it, should be\nfree and open at all times to all comers.",
