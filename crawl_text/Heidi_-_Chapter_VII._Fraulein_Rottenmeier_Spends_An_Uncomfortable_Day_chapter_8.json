        "When Heidi opened her eyes on her first morning in Frankfurt she\ncould not think where she was. Then she rubbed them and looked\nabout her. She was sitting up in a high white bed, on one side\nof a large, wide room, into which the light was falling through\nvery, very long white curtains; near the window stood two chairs\ncovered with large flowers, and then came a sofa with the same\nflowers, in front of which was a round table; in the corner was\na washstand, with things upon it that Heidi had never seen in her\nlife before. But now all at once she remembered that she was in\nFrankfurt; everything that had happened the day before came back\nto her, and finally she recalled clearly the instructions that\nhad been given her by the lady-housekeeper, as far as she had\nheard them. Heidi jumped out of bed and dressed herself; then\nshe ran first to one window and then another; she wanted to see\nthe sky and country outside; she felt like a bird in a cage\nbehind those great curtains. But they were too heavy for her to\nput aside, so she crept underneath them to get to the window. But\nthese again were so high that she could only just get her head\nabove the sill to peer out. Even then she could not see what she\nlonged for. In vain she went first to one and then the other of\nthe windows–she could see nothing but walls and windows and\nagain walls and windows. Heidi felt quite frightened. It was\nstill early, for Heidi was accustomed to get up early and run\nout at once to see how everything was looking, if the sky was\nblue and if the sun was already above the mountains, or if the\nfir trees were waving and the flowers had opened their eyes. As a\nbird, when it first finds itself in its bright new cage, darts\nhither and thither, trying the bars in turn to see if it cannot\nget through them and fly again into the open, so Heidi continued\nto run backwards and forwards, trying to open first one and then\nthe other of the windows, for she felt she could not bear to see\nnothing but walls and windows, and somewhere outside there must\nbe the green grass, and the last unmelted snows on the mountain\nslopes, which Heidi so longed to see. But the windows remained\nimmovable, try what Heidi would to open them, even endeavoring\nto push her little fingers under them to lift them up; but it was\nall no use. When after a while Heidi saw that her efforts were\nfruitless, she gave up trying, and began to think whether she\nwould not go out and round the house till she came to the grass,\nbut then she remembered that the night before she had only seen\nstones in front of the house. At that moment a knock came to the\ndoor, and immediately after Tinette put her head inside and\nsaid, “Breakfast is ready.” Heidi had no idea what an invitation\nso worded meant, and Tinette’s face did not encourage any\nquestioning on Heidi’s part, but rather the reverse. Heidi was\nsharp enough to read its expression, and acted accordingly. So\nshe drew the little stool out from under the table, put it in\nthe corner and sat down upon it, and there silently awaited what\nwould happen next. Shortly after, with a good deal of rustling\nand bustling Fraulein Rottenmeier appeared, who again seemed\nvery much put out and called to Heidi, “What is the matter with\nyou, Adelheid? Don’t you understand what breakfast is? Come along\nat once!”",
        "Heidi had no difficulty in understanding now and followed at\nonce. Clara had been some time at the breakfast table and she\ngave Heidi a kindly greeting, her face looking considerably more\ncheerful than usual, for she looked forward to all kinds of new\nthings happening again that day. Breakfast passed off quietly;\nHeidi ate her bread and butter in a perfectly correct manner,\nand when the meal was over and Clara wheeled back into the study,\nFraulein Rottenmeier told her to follow and remain with Clara\nuntil the tutor should arrive and lessons begin.",
        "As soon as the children were alone again, Heidi asked, “How can\none see out from here, and look right down on to the ground?”",
        "“You must open the window and look out,” replied Clara amused.",
        "“But the windows won’t open,” responded Heidi sadly.",
        "“Yes, they will,” Clara assured her. “You cannot open them, nor\nI either, but when you see Sebastian you can ask him to open\none.”",
        "It was a great relief to Heidi to know that the windows could be\nopened and that one could look out, for she still felt as if she\nwas shut up in prison. Clara now began to ask her questions\nabout her home, and Heidi was delighted to tell her all about the\nmountain and the goats, and the flowery meadows which were so\ndear to her.",
        "Meanwhile her tutor had arrived; Fraulein Rottenmeier, however,\ndid not bring him straight into the study but drew him first\naside into the dining-room, where she poured forth her troubles\nand explained to him the awkward position in which she was\nplaced, and how it had all come about. It appeared that she had\nwritten some time back to Herr Sesemann to tell him that his\ndaughter very much wished to have a companion, and had added how\ndesirable she thought it herself, as it would be a spur to Clara\nat her lessons and an amusement for her in her playtime.\nFraulein Rottenmeier had privately wished for this arrangement on\nher own behalf, as it would relieve her from having always to\nentertain the sick girl herself, which she felt at times was too\nmuch for her. The father had answered that he was quite willing\nto let his daughter have a companion, provided she was treated in\nevery way like his own child, as he would not have any child\ntormented or put upon, “which was a very unnecessary remark,” put\nin Fraulein Rottenmeier, “for who wants to torment children!” But\nnow she went on to explain how dreadfully she had been taken in\nabout the child, and related all the unimaginable things of which\nshe had already been guilty, so that not only would he have to\nbegin with teaching her the A B C, but would have to start with\nthe most rudimentary instruction as regarded everything to do\nwith daily life. She could see only one way out of this\ndisastrous state of affairs, and that was for the tutor to\ndeclare that it was impossible for the two to learn together\nwithout detriment to Clara, who was so far ahead of the other;\nthat would be a valid excuse for getting rid of the child, and\nHerr Sesemann would be sure to agree to the child being sent home\nagain, but she dared not do this without his order, since he was\naware that by this time the companion had arrived. But the tutor\nwas a cautious man and not inclined to take a partial view of\nmatters. He tried to calm Fraulein Rottenmeier, and gave it as\nhis opinion that if the little girl was backward in some things\nshe was probably advanced in others, and a little regular\nteaching would soon set the balance right. When Fraulein\nRottenmeier saw that he was not ready to support her, and\nevidently quite ready to undertake teaching the alphabet, she\nopened the study door, which she quickly shut again as soon as he\nhad gone through, remaining on the other side herself, for she\nhad a perfect horror of the A B C. She walked up and down the\ndining-room, thinking over in her own mind how the servants were\nto be told to address Adelaide. The father had written that she\nwas to be treated exactly like his own daughter, and this would\nespecially refer, she imagined, to the servants. She was not\nallowed, however, a very long interval of time for consideration,\nfor suddenly the sound of a frightful crash was heard in the\nstudy, followed by frantic cries for Sebastian. She rushed into\nthe room. There on the floor lay in a confused heap, books,\nexercise-books, inkstand, and other articles with the table-cloth\non the top, while from beneath them a dark stream of ink was\nflowing all across the floor. Heidi had disappeared.",
        "“Here’s a state of things!” exclaimed Fraulein Rottenmeier,\nwringing her hands. “Table-cloth, books, work-basket, everything\nlying in the ink! It was that unfortunate child, I suppose!”",
        "The tutor was standing looking down at the havoc in distress;\nthere was certainly only one view to be taken of such a matter\nas this and that an unfavorable one. Clara meanwhile appeared to\nfind pleasure in such an unusual event and in watching the\nresults. “Yes, Heidi did it,” she explained, “but quite by\naccident; she must on no account be punished; she jumped up in\nsuch violent haste to get away that she dragged the tablecloth\nalong with her, and so everything went over. There were a number\nof vehicles passing, that is why she rushed off like that;\nperhaps she has never seen a carriage.”",
        "“Is it not as I said? She has not the smallest notion about\nanything! not the slightest idea that she ought to sit still and\nlisten while her lessons are going on. But where is the child\nwho has caused all this trouble? Surely she has not run away!\nWhat would Herr Sesemann say to me?” She ran out of the room and\ndown the stairs. There, at the bottom, standing in the open door-\nway, was Heidi, looking in amazement up and down the street.",
        "“What are you doing? What are you thinking of to run away like\nthat?” called Fraulein Rottenmeier.",
        "“I heard the sound of the fir trees, but I cannot see where they\nare, and now I cannot hear them any more,” answered Heidi,\nlooking disappointedly in the direction whence the noise of the\npassing carriages had reached her, and which to Heidi had seemed\nlike the blowing of the south wind in the trees, so that in\ngreat joy of heart she had rushed out to look at them.",
        "“Fir trees! do you suppose we are in a wood? What ridiculous\nideas are these? Come upstairs and see the mischief you have\ndone!”",
        "Heidi turned and followed Fraulein Rottenmeier upstairs; she was\nquite astonished to see the disaster she had caused, for in her\njoy and haste to get to the fir trees she had been unaware of\nhaving dragged everything after her.",
        "“I excuse you doing this as it is the first time, but do not let\nme know you doing it a second time,” said Fraulein Rottenmeier,\npointing to the floor. “During your lesson time you are to sit\nstill and attend. If you cannot do this I shall have to tie you\nto your chair. Do you understand?”",
        "“Yes,” replied Heidi, “but I will certainly not move again,” for\nnow she understood that it was a rule to sit still while she was\nbeing taught.",
        "Sebastian and Tinette were now sent for to clear up the broken\narticles and put things in order again; the tutor said good-\nmorning and left, as it was impossible to do any more lessons\nthat day; there had been certainly no time for gaping this\nmorning.",
        "Clara had to rest for a certain time during the afternoon, and\nduring this interval, as Fraulein Rottenmeier informed Heidi,\nthe latter might amuse herself as she liked. When Clara had been\nplaced on her couch after dinner, and the lady-housekeeper had\nretired to her room, Heidi knew that her time had come to choose\nher own occupation. It was just what she was longing for, as\nthere was something she had made up her mind to do; but she\nwould require some help for its accomplishment, and in view of\nthis she took her stand in the hall in front of the dining-room\ndoor in order to intercept the person she wanted. In a few\nminutes up came Sebastian from the kitchen with a tray of silver\ntea-things, which he had to put away in the dining-room cupboard.\nAs he reached the top stairs Heidi went up to him and addressed\nhim in the formal manner she had been ordered to use by Fraulein\nRottenmeier.",
        "Sebastian looked surprised and said somewhat curtly, “What is it\nyou want, miss?”",
        "“I only wished to ask you something, but it is nothing bad like\nthis morning,” said Heidi, anxious to conciliate him, for she\nsaw that Sebastian was rather in a cross temper, and quite\nthought that it was on account of the ink she had spilt on the\nfloor.",
        "“Indeed, and why, I should first like to know, do you address me\nlike that?” replied Sebastian, evidently still put out.",
        "“Fraulein Rottenmeier told me always to speak to you like that,\"\nsaid Heidi.",
        "Then Sebastian laughed, which very much astonished Heidi, who\nhad seen nothing amusing in the conversation, but Sebastian, now\nhe understood that the child was only obeying orders, added in a\nfriendly voice, “What is it then that miss wants?”",
        "It was now Heidi’s turn to be a little put out, and she said,\n“My name is not miss, it is Heidi.”",
        "“Quite so, but the same lady has ordered me to call you miss,\"\nexplained Sebastian.",
        "“Has she? oh, then I must be called so,” said Heidi\nsubmissively, for she had already noticed that whatever Fraulein\nRottenmeier said was law. “Then now I have three names,” she\nadded with a sigh.",
        "“What was it little miss wished to ask?” said Sebastian as he\nwent on into the dining-room to put away his silver.",
        "“How can a window be opened?”",
        "“Why, like that!” and Sebastian flung up one of the large\nwindows.",
        "Heidi ran to it, but she was not tall enough to see out, for her\nhead only reached the sill.",
        "“There, now miss can look out and see what is going on below,\"\nsaid Sebastian as he brought her a high wooden stool to stand\non.",
        "Heidi climbed up, and at last, as she thought, was going to see\nwhat she had been longing for. But she drew back her head with a\nlook of great disappointment on her face.",
        "“Why, there is nothing outside but the stony streets,” she said\nmournfully; “but if I went right round to the other side of the\nhouse what should I see there, Sebastian?”",
        "“Nothing but what you see here,” he told her.",
        "“Then where can I go to see right away over the whole valley?”",
        "“You would have to climb to the top of a high tower, a church\ntower, like that one over there with the gold ball above it.\nFrom there you can see right away ever so far.”",
        "Heidi climbed down quickly from her stool, ran to the door, down\nthe steps and out into the street. Things were not, however,\nquite so easy as she thought. Looking from the window the tower\nhad appeared so close that she imagined she had only to run over\nthe road to reach it. But now, although she ran along the whole\nlength of the street, she still did not get any nearer to it,\nand indeed soon lost sight of it altogether; she turned down\nanother street, and went on and on, but still no tower. She\npassed a great many people, but they all seemed in such a hurry\nthat Heidi thought they had not time to tell her which way to go.\nThen suddenly at one of the street corners she saw a boy\nstanding, carrying a hand-organ on his back and a funny-looking\nanimal on his arm. Heidi ran up to him and said, “Where is the\ntower with the gold ball on the top?”",
        "“I don’t know,” was the answer.",
        "“Who can I ask to show me?” she asked again.",
        "“I don’t know.”",
        "“Do you know any other church with a high tower?”",
        "“Yes, I know one.”",
        "“Come then and show it me.”",
        "“Show me first what you will give me for it,” and the boy held\nout his hand as he spoke. Heidi searched about in her pockets\nand presently drew out a card on which was painted a garland of\nbeautiful red roses; she looked at it first for a moment or two,\nfor she felt rather sorry to part with it; Clara had only that\nmorning made her a present of it–but then, to look down into\nthe valley and see all the lovely green slopes! “There,” said\nHeidi, holding out the card, “would you like to have that?”",
        "The boy drew back his hand and shook his head.",
        "“What would you like then?” asked Heidi, not sorry to put the\ncard back in her pocket.",
        "“Money.”",
        "“I have none, but Clara has; I am sure she will give me some;\nhow much do you want?”",
        "“Twopence.”",
        "“Come along then.”",
        "They started off together along the street, and on the way Heidi\nasked her companion what he was carrying on his back; it was a\nhand-organ, he told her, which played beautiful music when he\nturned the handle. All at once they found themselves in front of\nan old church with a high tower; the boy stood still, and said,\n“There it is.”",
        "“But how shall I get inside?” asked Heidi, looking at the fast\nclosed doors.",
        "“I don’t know,” was the answer.",
        "“Do you think that I can ring as they do for Sebastian?”",
        "“I don’t know.”",
        "Heidi had by this time caught sight of a bell in the wall which\nshe now pulled with all her might. “If I go up you must stay\ndown here, for I do not know the way back, and you will have to\nshow me.”",
        "“What will you give me then for that?”",
        "“What do you want me to give you?”",
        "“Another twopence.”",
        "They heard the key turning inside, and then some one pulled open\nthe heavy creaking door; an old man came out and at first looked\nwith surprise and then in anger at the children, as he began\nscolding them: “What do you mean by ringing me down like this?\nCan’t you read what is written over the bell, ’For those who\nwish to go up the tower’?”",
        "The boy said nothing but pointed his finger at Heidi. The latter\nanswered, “But I do want to go up the tower.”",
        "“What do you want up there?” said the old man. “Has somebody\nsent you?”",
        "“No,” replied Heidi, “I only wanted to go up that I might look\ndown.”",
        "“Get along home with you and don’t try this trick on me again,\nor you may not come off so easily a second time,” and with that\nhe turned and was about to shut the door. But Heidi took hold of\nhis coat and said beseechingly, “Let me go up, just once.”",
        "He looked around, and his mood changed as he saw her pleading\neyes; he took hold of her hand and said kindly, “Well, if you\nreally wish it so much, I will take you.”",
        "The boy sat down on the church steps to show that he was content\nto wait where he was.",
        "Hand in hand with the old man Heidi went up the many steps of\nthe tower; they became smaller and smaller as they neared the\ntop, and at last came one very narrow one, and there they were at\nthe end of their climb. The old man lifted Heidi up that she\nmight look out of the open window.",
        "“There, now you can look down,” he said.",
        "Heidi saw beneath her a sea of roofs, towers, and chimney-pots;\nshe quickly drew back her head and said in a sad, disappointed\nvoice, “It is not at all what I thought.”",
        "“You see now, a child like you does not understand anything\nabout a view! Come along down and don’t go ringing at my bell\nagain!”",
        "He lifted her down and went on before her down the narrow\nstairway. To the left of the turn where it grew wider stood the\ndoor of the tower-keeper’s room, and the landing ran out beside\nit to the edge of the steep slanting roof. At the far end of\nthis was a large basket, in front of which sat a big grey cat,\nthat snarled as it saw them, for she wished to warn the passers-\nby that they were not to meddle with her family. Heidi stood\nstill and looked at her in astonishment, for she had never seen\nsuch a monster cat before; there were whole armies of mice,\nhowever, in the old tower, so the cat had no difficulty in\ncatching half a dozen for her dinner every day. The old man\nseeing Heidi so struck with admiration said, “She will not hurt\nyou while I am near; come, you can have a peep at the kittens.”",
        "Heidi went up to the basket and broke out into expressions of\ndelight.",
        "“Oh, the sweet little things! the darling kittens,” she kept on\nsaying, as she jumped from side to side of the basket so as, not\nto lose any of the droll gambols of the seven or eight little\nkittens that were scrambling and rolling and falling over one\nanother.",
        "“Would you like to have one?” said the old man, who enjoyed\nwatching the child’s pleasure.",
        "“For myself to keep?” said Heidi excitedly, who could hardly\nbelieve such happiness was to be hers.",
        "“Yes, of course, more than one if you like–in short, you can\ntake away the whole lot if you have room for them,” for the old\nman was only too glad to think he could get rid of his kittens\nwithout more trouble.",
        "Heidi could hardly contain herself for joy. There would be\nplenty of room for them in the large house, and then how\nastonished and delighted Clara would be when she saw the sweet\nlittle kittens.",
        "“But how can I take them with me?” asked Heidi, and was going\nquickly to see how many she could carry away in her hands, when\nthe old cat sprang at her so fiercely that she shrank back in\nfear.",
        "“I will take them for you if you will tell me where,” said the\nold man, stroking the cat to quiet her, for she was an old\nfriend of his that had lived with him in the tower for many\nyears.",
        "“To Herr Sesemann’s, the big house where there is a gold dog’s\nhead on the door, with a ring in its mouth,” explained Heidi.",
        "Such full directions as these were not really needed by the old\nman, who had had charge of the tower for many a long year and\nknew every house far and near, and moreover Sebastian was an\nacquaintance of his.",
        "“I know the house,” he said, “but when shall I bring them, and\nwho shall I ask for?–you are not one of the family, I am sure.”",
        "“No, but Clara will be so delighted when I take her the\nkittens.”",
        "The old man wished now to go downstairs, but Heidi did not know\nhow to tear herself away from the amusing spectacle.",
        "“If I could just take one or two away with me! one for myself\nand one for Clara, may I?”",
        "“Well, wait a moment,” said the man, and he drew the cat\ncautiously away into his room, and leaving her by a bowl of food\ncame out again and shut the door. “Now take two of them.”",
        "Heidi’s eyes shone with delight. She picked up a white kitten\nand another striped white and yellow, and put one in the right,\nthe other in the left pocket. Then she went downstairs. The boy\nwas still sitting outside on the steps, and as the old man shut\nthe door of the church behind them, she said, “Which is our way\nto Herr Sesemann’s house?”",
        "“I don’t know,” was the answer.",
        "Heidi began a description of the front door and the steps and\nthe windows, but the boy only shook his head, and was not any the\nwiser.",
        "“Well, look here,” continued Heidi, “from one window you can see\na very, very large grey house, and the roof runs like this–\"\nand Heidi drew a zigzag line in the air with her forefinger.",
        "With this the boy jumped up, he was evidently in the habit of\nguiding himself by similar landmarks. He ran straight off with\nHeidi after him, and in a very short time they had reached the\ndoor with the large dog’s head for the knocker. Heidi rang the\nbell. Sebastian opened it quickly, and when he saw it was Heidi,\n“Make haste! make haste,” he cried in a hurried voice.",
        "Heidi sprang hastily in and Sebastian shut the door after her,\nleaving the boy, whom he had not noticed, standing in wonder on\nthe steps.",
        "“Make haste, little miss,” said Sebastian again; “go straight\ninto the dining-room, they are already at table; Fraulein\nRottenmeier looks like a loaded cannon. What could make the\nlittle miss run off like that?”",
        "Heidi walked into the room. The lady housekeeper did not look\nup, Clara did not speak; there was an uncomfortable silence.\nSebastian pushed her chair up for her, and when she was seated\nFraulein Rottenmeier, with a severe countenance, sternly and\nsolemnly addressed her: “I will speak with you afterwards,\nAdelheid, only this much will I now say, that you behaved in a\nmost unmannerly and reprehensible way by running out of the\nhouse as you did, without asking permission, without any one\nknowing a word about it; and then to go wandering about till this\nhour; I never heard of such behavior before.”",
        "“Miau!” came the answer back.",
        "This was too much for the lady’s temper; with raised voice she\nexclaimed, “You dare, Adelheid, after your bad behavior, to\nanswer me as if it were a joke?”",
        "“I did not–” began Heidi–\"Miau! miau!”",
        "Sebastian almost dropped his dish and rushed out of the room.",
        "“That will do,” Fraulein Rottenmeier tried to say, but her voice\nwas almost stifled with anger. “Get up and leave the room.”",
        "Heidi stood up frightened, and again made an attempt to explain.\n“I really did not–” “Miau! miau! miau!”",
        "“But, Heidi,” now put in Clara, “when you see that it makes\nFraulein Rottenmeier angry, why do you keep on saying miau?”",
        "“It isn’t I, it’s the kittens,” Heidi was at last given time to\nsay.",
        "“How! what! kittens!” shrieked Fraulein Rottenmeier. “Sebastian!\nTinette! Find the horrid little things! take them away!” And she\nrose and fled into the study and locked the door, so as to make\nsure that she was safe from the kittens, which to her were the\nmost horrible things in creation.",
        "Sebastian was obliged to wait a few minutes outside the door to\nget over his laughter before he went into the room again. He\nhad, while serving Heidi, caught sight of a little kitten’s head\npeeping out of her pocket, and guessing the scene that would\nfollow, had been so overcome with amusement at the first miaus\nthat he had hardly been able to finish handing the dishes. The\nlady’s distressed cries for help had ceased before he had\nsufficiently regained his composure to go back into the dining-\nroom. It was all peace and quietness there now, Clara had the\nkittens on her lap, and Heidi was kneeling beside her, both\nlaughing and playing with the tiny, graceful little animals.",
        "“Sebastian,” exclaimed Clara as he came in, “you must help us;\nyou must find a bed for the kittens where Fraulein Rottenmeier\nwill not spy them out, for she is so afraid of them that she\nwill send them away at once; but we want to keep them, and have\nthem out whenever we are alone. Where can you put them?”",
        "“I will see to that,” answered Sebastian willingly. “I will make\na bed in a basket and put it in some place where the lady is not\nlikely to go; you leave it to me.” He set about the work at\nonce, sniggling to himself the while, for he guessed there would\nbe a further rumpus about this some day, and Sebastian was not\nwithout a certain pleasure in the thought of Fraulein Rottenmeier\nbeing a little disturbed.",
        "Not until some time had elapsed, and it was nearing the hour for\ngoing to bed, did Fraulein Rottenmeier venture to open the door\na crack and call through, “Have you taken those dreadful little\nanimals away, Sebastian?”",
        "He assured her twice that he had done so; he had been hanging\nabout the room in anticipation of this question, and now quickly\nand quietly caught up the kittens from Clara’s lap and\ndisappeared with them.",
        "The castigatory sermon which Fraulein Rottenmeier had held in\nreserve for Heidi was put off till the following day, as she\nfelt too exhausted now after all the emotions she had gone\nthrough of irritation, anger, and fright, of which Heidi had\nunconsciously been the cause. She retired without speaking, Clara\nand Heidi following, happy in their minds at knowing that the\nkittens were lying in a comfortable bed.",
