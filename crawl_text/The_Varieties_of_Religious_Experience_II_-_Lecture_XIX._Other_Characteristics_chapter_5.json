        "We have wound our way back, after our excursion through mysticism\nand philosophy, to where we were before:  the uses of religion,\nits uses to the individual who has it, and the uses of the\nindividual himself to the world, are the best arguments that\ntruth is in it.  We return to the empirical philosophy:  the true\nis what works well, even though the qualification “on the whole\"\nmay always have to be added.  In this lecture we must revert to\ndescription again, and finish our picture of the religious\nconsciousness by a word about some of its other characteristic\nelements.  Then, in a final lecture, we shall be free to make a\ngeneral review and draw our independent conclusions.",
        "The first point I will speak of is the part which the aesthetic\nlife plays in determining one’s choice of a religion.  Men, I\nsaid awhile ago, involuntarily intellectualize their religious\nexperience.  They need formulas, just as they need fellowship in\nworship.  I spoke, therefore, too contemptuously of the pragmatic\nuselessness of the famous scholastic list of attributes of the\ndeity, for they have one use which I neglected to consider.  The\neloquent passage in which Newman enumerates them[301] puts us on\nthe track of it.  Intoning them as he would intone a cathedral\nservice, he shows how high is their aesthetic value.  It enriches\nour bare piety to carry these exalted and mysterious verbal\nadditions just as it enriches a church to have an organ and old\nbrasses, marbles and frescoes and stained windows.  Epithets lend\nan atmosphere and overtones to our devotion.  They are like a\nhymn of praise and service of glory, and may sound the more\nsublime for being incomprehensible.  Minds like Newman’s[302]\ngrow as jealous of their credit as heathen priests are of that of\nthe jewelry and ornaments that blaze upon their idols.",
        "[301] Idea of a University, Discourse III.  Section 7.",
        "[302] Newman’s imagination so innately craved an ecclesiastical\nsystem that he can write:  “From the age of fifteen, dogma has\nbeen the fundamental principle of my religion:  I know no other\nreligion; I cannot enter into the idea of any other sort of\nreligion.”  And again speaking of himself about the age of\nthirty, he writes:  “I loved to act as feeling myself in my\nBishop’s sight, as if it were the sight of God.”  Apologia, 1897,\npp. 48, 50.",
        "Among the buildings-out of religion which the mind spontaneously\nindulges in, the aesthetic motive must never be forgotten.  I\npromised to say nothing of ecclesiastical systems in these\nlectures.  I may be allowed, however, to put in a word at this\npoint on the way in which their satisfaction of certain aesthetic\nneeds contributes to their hold on human nature.  Although some\npersons aim most at intellectual purity and simplification, for\nothers RICHNESS is the supreme imaginative requirement.[303] When\none’s mind is strongly of this type, an individual religion will\nhardly serve the purpose. The inner need is rather of something\ninstitutional and complex, majestic in the hierarchic\ninterrelatedness of its parts, with authority descending from\nstage to stage, and at every stage objects for adjectives of\nmystery and splendor, derived in the last resort from the Godhead\nwho is the fountain and culmination of the system.  One feels\nthen as if in presence of some vast incrusted work of jewelry or\narchitecture; one hears the multitudinous liturgical appeal; one\ngets the honorific vibration coming from every quarter.  Compared\nwith such a noble complexity, in which ascending and descending\nmovements seem in no way to jar upon stability, in which no\nsingle item, however humble, is insignificant, because so many\naugust institutions hold it in its place, how flat does\nevangelical Protestantism appear, how bare the atmosphere of\nthose isolated religious lives whose boast it is that “man in the\nbush with God may meet.\"[304] What a pulverization and leveling\nof what a gloriously piled-up structure!  To an imagination used\nto the perspectives of dignity and glory, the naked gospel scheme\nseems to offer an almshouse for a palace.",
        "[303] The intellectual difference is quite on a par in practical\nimportance with the analogous difference in character.  We saw,\nunder the head of Saintliness, how some characters resent\nconfusion and must live in purity, consistency, simplicity\n(above, p. 275 ff.).  For others, on the contrary,\nsuperabundance, over-pressure, stimulation, lots of superficial\nrelations, are indispensable.  There are men who would suffer a\nvery syncope if you should pay all their debts, bring it about\nthat their engagements had been kept, their letters answered\ntheir perplexities relieved, and their duties fulfilled, down to\none which lay on a clean table under their eyes with nothing to\ninterfere with its immediate performance.  A day stripped so\nstaringly bare would be for them appalling.  So with ease,\nelegance, tributes of affection, social recognitions–some of us\nrequire amounts of these things which to others would appear a\nmass of lying and sophistication.",
        "[304] In Newman’s Lectures on Justification Lecture VIII. \nSection 6, there is a splendid passage expressive of this\naesthetic way of feeling the Christian scheme.  It is\nunfortunately too long to quote.",
        "It is much like the patriotic sentiment of those brought up in\nancient empires.  How many emotions must be frustrated of their\nobject, when one gives up the titles of dignity, the crimson\nlights and blare of brass, the gold embroidery, the plumed\ntroops, the fear and trembling, and puts up with a president in a\nblack coat who shakes hands with you, and comes, it may be, from\na “home” upon a veldt or prairie with one sitting-room and a\nBible on its centre-table.  It pauperizes the monarchical\nimagination!",
        "The strength of these aesthetic sentiments makes it rigorously\nimpossible, it seems to me, that Protestantism, however superior\nin spiritual profundity it may be to Catholicism, should at the\npresent day succeed in making many converts from the more\nvenerable ecclesiasticism.  The latter offers a so much richer\npasturage and shade to the fancy, has so many cells with so many\ndifferent kinds of honey, is so indulgent in its multiform\nappeals to human nature, that Protestantism will always show to\nCatholic eyes the almshouse physiognomy.  The bitter negativity\nof it is to the Catholic mind incomprehensible.  To intellectual\nCatholics many of the antiquated beliefs and practices to which\nthe Church gives countenance are, if taken literally, as childish\nas they are to Protestants.  But they are childish in the\npleasing sense of “childlike\"–innocent and amiable, and worthy\nto be smiled on in consideration of the undeveloped condition of\nthe dear people’s intellects.  To the Protestant, on the\ncontrary, they are childish in the sense of being idiotic\nfalsehoods.  He must stamp out their delicate and lovable\nredundancy, leaving the Catholic to shudder at his literalness. \nHe appears to the latter as morose as if he were some hard-eyed,\nnumb, monotonous kind of reptile.  The two will never understand\neach other–their centres of emotional energy are too different. \nRigorous truth and human nature’s intricacies are always in need\nof a mutual interpreter.[305] So much for the aesthetic\ndiversities in the religious consciousness.",
        "[305] Compare the informality of Protestantism, where the “meek\nlover of the good,” alone with his God, visits the sick, etc.,\nfor their own sakes, with the elaborate “business” that goes on\nin Catholic devotion, and carries with it the social excitement\nof all more complex businesses.  An essentially worldly-minded\nCatholic woman can become a visitor of the sick on purely\ncoquettish principles, with her confessor and director, her\n“merit” storing up, her patron saints, her privileged relation to\nthe Almighty, drawing his attention as a professional devote, her\ndefinite “exercises,” and her definitely recognized social pose\nin the organization.",
        "In most books on religion, three things are represented as its\nmost essential elements.  These are Sacrifice, Confession, and\nPrayer.  I must say a word in turn of each of these elements,\nthough briefly.  First of Sacrifice.",
        "Sacrifices to gods are omnipresent in primeval worship; but, as\ncults have grown refined, burnt offerings and the blood of\nhe-goats have been superseded by sacrifices more spiritual in\ntheir nature.  Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism get along without\nritual sacrifice; so does Christianity, save in so far as the\nnotion is preserved in transfigured form in the mystery of\nChrist’s atonement.  These religions substitute offerings of the\nheart, renunciations of the inner self, for all those vain\noblations.  In the ascetic practices which Islam, Buddhism, and\nthe older Christianity encourage we see how indestructible is the\nidea that sacrifice of some sort is a religious exercise.  In\nlecturing on asceticism I spoke of its significance as symbolic\nof the sacrifices which life, whenever it is taken strenuously,\ncalls for.[306]  But, as I said my say about those, and as these\nlectures expressly avoid earlier religious usages and questions\nof derivation, I will pass from the subject of Sacrifice\naltogether and turn to that of Confession.",
        "[306] Above, p. 354 ff.",
        "In regard to Confession I will also be most brief, saying my word\nabout it psychologically, not historically.  Not nearly as\nwidespread as sacrifice, it corresponds to a more inward and\nmoral stage of sentiment.  It is part of the general system of\npurgation and cleansing which one feels one’s self in need of, in\norder to be in right relations to one’s deity.  For him who\nconfesses, shams are over and realities have begun; he has\nexteriorized his rottenness.  If he has not actually got rid of\nit, he at least no longer smears it over with a hypocritical show\nof virtue–he lives at least upon a basis of veracity.  The\ncomplete decay of the practice of confession in Anglo-Saxon\ncommunities is a little hard to account for.  Reaction against\npopery is of course the historic explanation, for in popery\nconfession went with penances and absolution, and other\ninadmissible practices.  But on the <453> side of the sinner\nhimself it seems as if the need ought to have been too great to\naccept so summary a refusal of its satisfaction.  One would think\nthat in more men the shell of secrecy would have had to open, the\npent-in abscess to burst and gain relief, even though the ear\nthat heard the confession were unworthy.  The Catholic church,\nfor obvious utilitarian reasons, has substituted auricular\nconfession to one priest for the more radical act of public\nconfession.  We English-speaking Protestants, in the general\nself-reliance and unsociability of our nature, seem to find it\nenough if we take God alone into our confidence.[307]",
        "[307] A fuller discussion of confession is contained in the\nexcellent work by Frank Granger:  The Soul of a Christian,\nLondon, 1900, ch. xii.",
        "The next topic on which I must comment is Prayer–and this time\nit must be less briefly.  We have heard much talk of late against\nprayer, especially against prayers for better weather and for the\nrecovery of sick people.  As regards prayers for the sick, if any\nmedical fact can be considered to stand firm, it is that in\ncertain environments prayer may contribute to recovery, and\nshould be encouraged as a therapeutic measure.  Being a normal\nfactor of moral health in the person, its omission would be\ndeleterious.  The case of the weather is different. \nNotwithstanding the recency of the opposite belief,[308] every\none now knows that droughts and storms follow from physical\nantecedents, and that moral appeals cannot avert them.  But\npetitional prayer is only one department of prayer; and if we\ntake the word in the wider sense as meaning every kind of inward\ncommunion or conversation with the power recognized as divine, we\ncan easily see that scientific criticism leaves it untouched.",
        "[308] Example:  “The minister at Sudbury, being at the Thursday\nlecture in Boston, heard the officiating clergyman praying for\nrain.  As soon as the service was over, he went to the petitioner\nand said ’You Boston ministers, as soon as a tulip wilts under\nyour windows, go to church and pray for rain, until all Concord\nand Sudbury are under water.’”  R. W. Emerson:  Lectures and\nBiographical Sketches, p. 363.",
        "Prayer in this wide sense is the very soul and essence of\nreligion.  “Religion,” says a liberal French theologian, “is an\nintercourse, a conscious and voluntary relation, entered into by\na soul in distress with the mysterious power upon which it feels\nitself to depend, and upon which its fate is contingent.  This\nintercourse with God is realized by prayer.  Prayer is religion\nin act; that is, prayer is real religion.  It is prayer that\ndistinguishes the religious phenomenon from such similar or\nneighboring phenomena as purely moral or aesthetic sentiment. \nReligion is nothing if it be not the vital act by which the\nentire mind seeks to save itself by clinging to the principle\nfrom which it draws its life.  This act is prayer, by which term\nI understand no vain exercise of words, no mere repetition of\ncertain sacred formula, but the very movement itself of the soul,\nputting itself in a personal relation of contact with the\nmysterious power of which it feels the presence–it may be even\nbefore it has a name by which to call it.  Wherever this interior\nprayer is lacking, there is no religion; wherever, on the other\nhand, this prayer rises and stirs the soul, even in the absence\nof forms or of doctrines, we have living religion.  One sees from\nthis why “natural religion, so-called, is not properly a\nreligion.  It cuts man off from prayer.  It leaves him and God in\nmutual remoteness, with no intimate commerce, no interior\ndialogue, no interchange, no action of God in man, no return of\nman to God.  At bottom this pretended religion is only a\nphilosophy.  Born at epochs of rationalism, of critical\ninvestigations, it never was anything but an abstraction.  An\nartificial and dead creation, it reveals to its examiner hardly\none of the characters proper to religion.\"[309]",
        "[309] Auguste Sabatier:  Esquisse d’une Philosophie de la\nReligion. 2me ed., 1897, pp. 24-26, abridged.",
        "It seems to me that the entire series of our lectures proves the\ntruth of M. Sabatier’s contention.  The religious phenomenon,\nstudied as in Inner fact, and apart from ecclesiastical or\ntheological complications, has shown itself to consist\neverywhere, and at all its stages, in the consciousness which\nindividuals have of an intercourse between themselves and higher\npowers with which they feel themselves to be related. This\nintercourse is realized at the time as being both active and\nmutual.  If it be not effective; if it be not a give and take\nrelation; if nothing be really transacted while it lasts; if the\nworld is in no whit different for its having taken place; then\nprayer, taken in this wide meaning of a sense that SOMETHING IS\nTRANSACTING, is of course a feeling of what is illusory, and\nreligion must on the whole be classed, not simply as containing\nelements of delusion–these undoubtedly everywhere exist–but as\nbeing rooted in delusion altogether, just as materialists and\natheists have always said it was.  At most there might remain,\nwhen the direct experiences of prayer were ruled out as false\nwitnesses, some inferential belief that the whole order of\nexistence must have a divine cause.  But this way of\ncontemplating nature, pleasing as it would doubtless be to\npersons of a pious taste, would leave to them but the spectators’\npart at a play, whereas in experimental religion and the\nprayerful life, we seem ourselves to be actors, and not in a\nplay, but in a very serious reality.",
        "The genuineness of religion is thus indissolubly bound up with\nthe question whether the prayerful consciousness be or be not\ndeceitful.  The conviction that something is genuinely transacted\nin this consciousness is the very core of living religion.  As to\nwhat is transacted, great differences of opinion have prevailed. \nThe unseen powers have been supposed, and are yet supposed, to do\nthings which no enlightened man can nowadays believe in.  It may\nwell prove that the sphere of influence in prayer is subjective\nexclusively, and that what is immediately changed is only the\nmind of the praying person.  But however our opinion of prayer’s\neffects may come to be limited by criticism, religion, in the\nvital sense in which these lectures study it, must stand or fall\nby the persuasion that effects of some sort genuinely do occur. \nThrough prayer, religion insists, things which cannot be realized\nin any other manner come about:  energy which but for prayer\nwould be bound is by prayer set free and operates in some part,\nbe it objective or subjective, of the world of facts.",
        "This postulate is strikingly expressed in a letter written by the\nlate Frederic W. H. Myers to a friend, who allows me to quote\nfrom it.  It shows how independent the prayer-instinct is of\nusual doctrinal complications.  Mr. Myers writes:–",
        "“I am glad that you have asked me about prayer, because I have\nrather strong ideas on the subject.  First consider what are the\nfacts.  There exists around us a spiritual universe, and that\nuniverse is in actual relation with the material.  From the\nspiritual universe comes the energy which maintains the material;\nthe energy which makes the life of each individual spirit.  Our\nspirits are supported by a perpetual indrawal of this energy, and\nthe vigor of that indrawal is perpetually changing, much as the\nvigor of our absorption of material nutriment changes from hour\nto hour.",
        "“I call these ’facts’ because I think that some scheme of this\nkind is the only one consistent with our actual evidence; too\ncomplex to summarize here.  How, then, should we ACT on these\nfacts?  Plainly we must endeavor to draw in as much spiritual\nlife as possible, and we must place our minds in any attitude\nwhich experience shows to be favorable to such indrawal.  PRAYER\nis the general name for that attitude of open and earnest\nexpectancy.  If we then ask to whom to pray, the answer\n(strangely enough) must be that THAT does not much matter.  The\nprayer is not indeed a purely subjective thing;–it means a real\nincrease in intensity of absorption of spiritual power or\ngrace;–but we do not know enough of what takes place in the\nspiritual world to know how the prayer operates;–WHO is\ncognizant of it, or through what channel the grace is given. \nBetter let children pray to Christ, who is at any rate the\nhighest individual spirit of whom we have any knowledge.  But it\nwould be rash to say that Christ himself HEARS US; while to say\nthat GOD hears us is merely to restate the first principle–that\ngrace flows in from the infinite spiritual world.”",
        "Let us reserve the question of the truth or falsehood of the\nbelief that power is absorbed until the next lecture, when our\ndogmatic conclusions, if we have any, must be reached. Let this\nlecture still confine itself to the description of phenomena; and\nas a concrete example of an extreme sort, of the way in which the\nprayerful life may still be led, let me take a case with which\nmost of you must be acquainted, that of George Muller of Bristol,\nwho died in 1898.  Muller’s prayers were of the crassest\npetitional order.  Early in life he resolved on taking certain\nBible promises in literal sincerity, and on letting himself be\nfed, not by his own worldly foresight, but by the Lord’s hand. \nHe had an extraordinarily active and successful career, among the\nfruits of which were the distribution of over two million copies\nof the Scripture text, in different languages; the equipment of\nseveral hundred missionaries; the circulation of more than a\nhundred and eleven million of scriptural books, pamphlets, and\ntracts; the building of five large orphanages, and the keeping\nand educating of thousands of orphans; finally, the establishment\nof schools in which over a hundred and twenty-one thousand\nyouthful and adult pupils were taught. In the course of this work\nMr. Muller received and administered nearly a million and a half\nof pounds sterling, and traveled over two hundred thousand miles\nof sea and land.[310]  During the sixty-eight years of his\nministry, he never owned any property except his clothes and\nfurniture, and cash in hand; and he left, at the age of\neighty-six, an estate worth only a hundred and sixty pounds.",
        "[310] My authority for these statistics is the little work on\nMuller, by Frederic G. Warne, New York, 1898.",
        "His method was to let his general wants be publicly known, but\nnot to acquaint other people with the details of his temporary\nnecessities.  For the relief of the latter, he prayed directly to\nthe Lord, believing that sooner or later prayers are always\nanswered if one have trust enough.  “When I lose such a thing as\na key,” he writes, “I ask the Lord to direct me to it, and I look\nfor an answer to my prayer; when a person with whom I have made\nan appointment does not come, according to the fixed time, and I\nbegin to be inconvenienced by it, I ask the Lord to be pleased to\nhasten him to me, and I look for an answer; when I do not\nunderstand a passage of the word of God, I lift up my heart to\nthe Lord that he would be pleased by his Holy Spirit to instruct\nme, and I expect to be taught, though I do not fix the time when,\nand the manner how it should be; when I am going to minister in\nthe Word, I seek help from the Lord, and . . . am not cast down,\nbut of good cheer because I look for his assistance.”",
        "Muller’s custom was to never run up bills, not even for a week. \n“As the Lord deals out to us by the day, . . . the week’s payment\nmight become due and we have no money to meet it; and thus those\nwith whom we deal might be inconvenienced by us, and we be found\nacting against the commandment of the Lord:  ’Owe no man\nanything.’ From this day and henceforward whilst the Lord gives\nto us our supplies by the day, we purpose to pay at once for\nevery article as it is purchased, and never to buy anything\nexcept we can pay for it at once, however much it may seem to be\nneeded, and however much those with whom we deal may wish to be\npaid only by the week.”",
        "The articles needed of which Muller speaks were the food, fuel,\netc., of his orphanages.  Somehow, near as they often come to\ngoing without a meal, they hardly ever seem actually to have done\nso.  “Greater and more manifest nearness of the Lord’s presence I\nhave never had than when after breakfast there were no means for\ndinner for more than a hundred persons; or when after dinner\nthere were no means for the tea, and yet the Lord provided the\ntea; and all this without one single human being having been\ninformed about our need. . . .  Through Grace my mind is so fully\nassured of the faithfulness of the Lord, that in the midst of the\ngreatest need, I am enabled in peace to go about my other work. \nIndeed, did not the Lord give me this, which is the result of\ntrusting in him, I should scarcely be able to work at all; for it\nis now comparatively a rare thing that a day comes when I am not\nin need for one or another part of the work.\"[311]",
        "[311] The Life of Trust; Being a Narrative of the Lord’s Dealings\nwith George Muller, New American edition, N. Y., Crowell, pp.\n228, 194, 219.",
        "In building his orphanages simply by prayer and faith, Muller\naffirms that his prime motive was “to have something to point to\nas a visible proof that our God and Father is the same faithful\nGod that he ever was–as willing as ever to prove himself the\nliving God, in our day as formerly, to all that put their trust\nin him.\"[312]  For this reason he refused to borrow money for any\nof his enterprises.  “How does it work when we thus anticipate\nGod by going our own way?  We certainly weaken faith instead of\nincreasing it; and each time we work thus a deliverance of our\nown we find it more and more difficult to trust in God, till at\nlast we give way entirely to our natural fallen reason and\nunbelief prevails.  How different if one is enabled to wait God’s\nown time, and to look alone to him for help and deliverance! When\nat last help comes, after many seasons of prayer it may be, how\nsweet it is, and what a present recompense!  Dear Christian\nreader, if you have never walked in this path of obedience\nbefore, do so now, and you will then know experimentally the\nsweetness of the joy which results from it.\"[313]",
        "[312] Ibid., p. 126.",
        "[313] Op. cit., p. 383, abridged.",
        "When the supplies came in but slowly, Muller always considered\nthat this was for the trial of his faith and patience When his\nfaith and patience had been sufficiently tried, the Lord would\nsend more means.  “And thus it has proved,\"–I quote from his\ndiary–\"for to-day was given me the sum of 2050 pounds, of which\n2000 are for the building fund [of a certain house], and 50 for\npresent necessities.  It is impossible to describe my joy in God\nwhen I received this donation.  I was neither excited nor\nsurprised; for I LOOK out for answers to my prayers.  I BELIEVE\nTHAT GOD HEARS ME.  Yet my heart was so full of joy that I could\nonly SIT before God, and admire him, like David in 2 Samuel vii. \nAt last I cast myself flat down upon my face and burst forth in\nthanksgiving to God and in surrendering my heart afresh to him\nfor his blessed service.\"[314]",
        "[314] Ibid., p. 323",
        "George Muller’s is a case extreme in every respect, and in no\nrespect more so than in the extraordinary narrowness of the man’s\nintellectual horizon.  His God was, as he often said, his\nbusiness partner.  He seems to have been for Muller little more\nthan a sort of supernatural clergyman interested in the\ncongregation of tradesmen and others in Bristol who were his\nsaints, and in the orphanages and other enterprises, but\nunpossessed of any of those vaster and wilder and more ideal\nattributes with which the human imagination elsewhere has\ninvested him.  Muller, in short, was absolutely unphilosophical. \nHis intensely private and practical conception of his relations\nwith the Deity continued the traditions of the most primitive\nhuman thought.[315]  When we compare a mind like his with such a\nmind as, for example, Emerson’s or Phillips Brooks’s, we see the\nrange which the religious consciousness covers.",
        "[315] I cannot resist the temptation of quoting an expression of\nan even more primitive style of religious thought, which I find\nin Arber’s English Garland, vol. vii. p. 440.  Robert Lyde, an\nEnglish sailor, along with an English boy, being prisoners on a\nFrench ship in 1689, set upon the crew, of seven Frenchmen,\nkilled two, made the other five prisoners, and brought home the\nship.  Lyde thus describes how in this feat he found his God a\nvery present help in time of trouble:–",
        "“With the assistance of God I kept my feet when they three and\none more did strive to throw me down.  Feeling the Frenchman\nwhich hung about my middle hang very heavy, I said to the boy,\n’Go round the binnacle, and knock down that man that hangeth on\nmy back.’  So the boy did strike him one blow on the head which\nmade him fall. . . . Then I looked about for a marlin spike or\nanything else to strike them withal.  But seeing nothing, I said,\n’LORD! what shall I do?’  Then casting up my eye upon my left\nside, and seeing a marlin spike hanging, I jerked my right arm\nand took hold, and struck the point four times about a quarter of\nan inch deep into the skull of that man that had hold of my left\narm.  [One of the Frenchmen then hauled the marlin spike away\nfrom him.]  But through GOD’S wonderful providence! it either\nfell out of his hand, or else he threw it down, and at this time\nthe Almighty GOD gave me strength enough to take one man in one\nhand, and throw at the other’s head:  and looking about again to\nsee anything to strike them withal, but seeing nothing, I said,\n’LORD! what shall I do now?’  And then it pleased GOD to put me\nin mind of my knife in my pocket.  And although two of the men\nhad hold of my right arm, yet GOD Almighty strengthened me so\nthat I put my right hand into my right pocket, drew out the knife\nand sheath, . . . put it between my legs and drew it out, and\nthen cut the man’s throat with it that had his back to my breast: \nand he immediately dropt down, and scarce ever stirred after.\"–I\nhave slightly abridged Lyde’s narrative.",
        "There is an immense literature relating to answers to petitional\nprayer.  The evangelical journals are filled with such answers,\nand books are devoted to the subject,[316] but for us Muller’s\ncase will suffice.",
        "[316] As, for instance, In Answer to Prayer, by the Bishop of\nRipon and others, London, 1898; Touching Incidents and Remarkable\nAnswers to Prayer, Harrisburg, Pa., 1898 (?); H. L. Hastings: \nThe Guiding Hand, or Providential Direction, illustrated by\nAuthentic Instances, Boston, 1898(?).",
        "A less sturdy beggar-like fashion of leading the prayerful life\nis followed by innumerable other Christians.  Persistence in\nleaning on the Almighty for support and guidance will, such\npersons say, bring with it proofs, palpable but much more subtle,\nof his presence and active influence.  The following description\nof a “led” life, by a German writer whom I have already quoted,\nwould no doubt appear to countless Christians in every country as\nif transcribed from their own personal experience.  One finds in\nthis guided sort of life, says Dr. Hilty–",
        "“That books and words (and sometimes people) come to one’s\ncognizance just at the very moment in which one needs them; that\none glides over great dangers as if with shut eyes, remaining\nignorant of what would have terrified one or led one astray,\nuntil the peril is past–this being especially the case with\ntemptations to vanity and sensuality; that paths on which one\nought not to wander are, as it were, hedged off with thorns; but\nthat on the other side great obstacles are suddenly removed; that\nwhen the time has come for something, one suddenly receives a\ncourage that formerly failed, or perceives the root of a matter\nthat until then was concealed, or discovers thoughts, talents,\nyea, even pieces of knowledge and insight, in one’s self, of\nwhich it is impossible to say whence they come; finally, that\npersons help us or decline to help us, favor us or refuse us, as\nif they had to do so against their will, so that often those\nindifferent or even unfriendly to us yield us the greatest\nservice and furtherance.  (God takes often their worldly goods,\nfrom those whom he leads, at just the right moment, when they\nthreaten to impede the effort after higher interests.)",
        "“Besides all this, other noteworthy things come to pass, of which\nit is not easy to give account.  There is no doubt whatever that\nnow one walks continually through ’open doors’ and on the easiest\nroads, with as little care and trouble as it is possible to\nimagine.",
        "“Furthermore one finds one’s self settling one’s affairs neither\ntoo early nor too late, whereas they were wont to be spoiled by\nuntimeliness, even when the preparations had been well laid. In\naddition to this, one does them with perfect tranquillity of\nmind, almost as if they were matters of no consequence, like\nerrands done by us for another person, in which case we usually\nact more calmly than when we act in our own concerns.  Again, one\nfinds that one can WAIT for everything patiently, and that is one\nof life’s great arts.  One finds also that each thing comes duly,\none thing after the other, so that one gains time to make one’s\nfooting sure before advancing farther.  And then every thing\noccurs to us at the right moment, just what we ought to do, etc.,\nand often in a very striking way, just as if a third person were\nkeeping watch over those things which we are in easy danger of\nforgetting.",
        "“Often, too, persons are sent to us at the right time, to offer\nor ask for what is needed, and what we should never have had the\ncourage or resolution to undertake of our own accord.",
        "“Through all these experiences one finds that one is kindly and\ntolerant of other people, even of such as are repulsive,\nnegligent, or ill-willed, for they also are instruments of good\nin God’s hand, and often most efficient ones.  Without these\nthoughts it would be hard for even the best of us always to keep\nour equanimity.  But with the consciousness of divine guidance,\none sees many a thing in life quite differently from what would\notherwise be possible.",
        "“All these are things that every human being KNOWS, who has had\nexperience of them; and of which the most speaking examples could\nbe brought forward.  The highest resources of worldly wisdom are\nunable to attain that which, under divine leading, comes to us of\nits own accord.\"[317]",
        "[317] C. Hilty:  Gluck, Dritter Theil, 1900, pp. 92 ff.",
        "Such accounts as this shade away into others where the belief is,\nnot that particular events are tempered more towardly to us by a\nsuperintending providence, as a reward for our reliance, but that\nby cultivating the continuous sense of our connection with the\npower that made things as they are, we are tempered more towardly\nfor their reception.  The outward face of nature need not alter,\nbut the expressions of meaning in it alter.  It was dead and is\nalive again. It is like the difference between looking on a\nperson without love, or upon the same person with love.  In the\nlatter case intercourse springs into new vitality.  So when one’s\naffections keep in touch with the divinity of the world’s\nauthorship, fear and egotism fall away; and in the equanimity\nthat follows, one finds in the hours, as they succeed each other,\na series of purely benignant opportunities.  It is as if all\ndoors were opened, and all paths freshly smoothed.  We meet a new\nworld when we meet the old world in the spirit which this kind of\nprayer infuses.",
        "Such a spirit was that of Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus.[318]  It\nis that of mind-curers, of the transcendentalists, and of the\nso-called “liberal” Christians.  As an expression of it, I will\nquote a page from one of Martineau’s sermons:–",
        "[318] “Good Heaven!” says Epictetus, “any one thing in the\ncreation is sufficient to demonstrate a Providence, to a humble\nand grateful mind.  The mere possibility of producing milk from\ngrass, cheese from milk, and wool from skins; who formed and\nplanned it?  Ought we not, whether we dig or plough or eat, to\nsing this hymn to God?  Great is God, who has supplied us with\nthese instruments to till the ground; great is God, who has given\nus hands and instruments of digestion, who has given us to grow\ninsensibly and to breathe in sleep.  These things we ought\nforever to celebrate. . . . But because the most of you are\nblind and insensible, there must be some one to fill this\nstation, and lead, in behalf of all men, the hymn to God; for\nwhat else can I do, a lame old man, but sing hymns to God?  Were\nI a nightingale, I would act the part of a nightingale; were I a\nswan, the part of a swan.  But since I am a reasonable creature,\nit is my duty to praise God . . . and I call on you to join the\nsame song.” Works, book i. ch. xvi., Carter-Higginson\n(translation) abridged.",
        "“The universe, open to the eye to-day, looks as it did a thousand\nyears ago:  and the morning hymn of Milton does but tell the\nbeauty with which our own familiar sun dressed the earliest\nfields and gardens of the world.  We see what all our fathers\nsaw.  And if we cannot find God in your house or in mine, upon\nthe roadside or the margin of the sea; in the bursting seed or\nopening flower; in the day duty or the night musing; in the\ngeneral laugh and the secret grief; in the procession of life,\never entering afresh, and solemnly passing by and dropping off; I\ndo not think we should discern him any more on the grass of Eden,\nor beneath the moonlight of Gethsemane.  Depend upon it, it is\nnot the want of greater miracles, but of the soul to perceive\nsuch as are allowed us still, that makes us push all the\nsanctities into the far spaces we cannot reach.  The devout feel\nthat wherever God’s hand is, THERE is miracle:  and it is simply\nan indevoutness which imagines that only where miracle is, can\nthere be the real hand of God.  The customs of Heaven ought\nsurely to be more sacred in our eyes than its anomalies; the dear\nold ways, of which the Most High is never tired, than the strange\nthings which he does not love well enough ever to repeat.  And he\nwho will but discern beneath the sun, as he rises any morning,\nthe supporting finger of the Almighty, may recover the sweet and\nreverent surprise with which Adam gazed on the first dawn in\nParadise.  It is no outward change, no shifting in time or place;\nbut only the loving meditation of the pure in heart, that can\nreawaken the Eternal from the sleep within our souls:  that can\nrender him a reality again, and reassert for him once more his\nancient name of ’the Living God.’\"[319]",

        "When we see all things in God, and refer all things to him, we\nread in common matters superior expressions of meaning.  The\ndeadness with which custom invests the familiar vanishes, and\nexistence as a whole appears transfigured. The state of a mind\nthus awakened from torpor is well expressed in these words, which\nI take from a friend’s letter:–",
        "“If we occupy ourselves in summing up all the mercies and\nbounties we are privileged to have, we are overwhelmed by their\nnumber (so great that we can imagine ourselves unable to give\nourselves time even to begin to review the things we may imagine\nWE HAVE NOT).  We sum them and realize that WE ARE ACTUALLY\nKILLED WITH GOD’S KINDNESS; that we are surrounded by bounties\nupon bounties, without which all would fall.  Should we not love\nit; should we not feel buoyed up by the Eternal Arms?”",
        "Sometimes this realization that facts are of divine sending,\ninstead of being habitual, is casual, like a mystical experience. \nFather Gratry gives this instance from his youthful melancholy\nperiod:–",
        "“One day I had a moment of consolation, because I met with\nsomething which seemed to me ideally perfect.  It was a poor\ndrummer beating the tattoo in the streets of Paris.  I walked\nbehind him in returning to the school on the evening of a\nholiday. His drum gave out the tattoo in such a way that, at that\nmoment at least, however peevish I were, I could find no pretext\nfor fault-finding.  It was impossible to conceive more nerve or\nspirit, better time or measure, more clearness or richness, than\nwere in this drumming.  Ideal desire could go no farther in that\ndirection.  I was enchanted and consoled; the perfection of this\nwretched act did me good.  Good is at least possible, I said.\nsince the ideal can thus sometimes get embodied.\"[320]",
        "[320] Souvenirs de ma Jeunesse, 1897, p. 122.",
        "In Senancour’s novel of Obermann a similar transient lifting of\nthe veil is recorded.  In Paris streets, on a March day, he comes\nacross a flower in bloom, a jonquil:",
        "“It was the strongest expression of desire:  it was the first\nperfume of the year.  I felt all the happiness destined for man.\nThis unutterable harmony of souls, the phantom of the ideal\nworld, arose in me complete.  I never felt anything so great or\nso instantaneous.  I know not what shape, what analogy, what\nsecret of relation it was that made me see in this flower a\nlimitless beauty. . . .  I shall never inclose in a conception\nthis power, this immensity that nothing will express; this form\nthat nothing will contain; this ideal of a better world which one\nfeels, but which, it seems, nature has not made actual.\"[321]",
        "[321] Op. cit., Letter XXX.",
        "We heard in previous lectures of the vivified face of the world\nas it may appear to converts after their awakening.[322] As a\nrule, religious persons generally assume that whatever natural\nfacts connect themselves in any way with their destiny are\nsignificant of the divine purposes with them. Through prayer\nthe purpose, often far from obvious, comes home to them, and if\nit be “trial,” strength to endure the trial is given.  Thus at\nall stages of the prayerful life we find the persuasion that in\nthe process of communion energy from on high flows in to meet\ndemand, and becomes operative within the phenomenal world.  So\nlong as this operativeness is admitted to be real, it makes no\nessential difference whether its immediate effects be subjective\nor objective. The fundamental religious point is that in prayer,\nspiritual energy, which otherwise would slumber, does become\nactive, and spiritual work of some kind is effected really.",
        "[322] Above, p. 243 ff.  Compare the withdrawal of expression\nfrom the world, in Melancholiacs, p. 148.",
        "So much for Prayer, taken in the wide sense of any kind of\ncommunion.  As the core of religion, we must return to it in the\nnext lecture.",
        "The last aspect of the religious life which remains for me to\ntouch upon is the fact that its manifestations so frequently\nconnect themselves with the subconscious part of our existence.\nYou may remember what I said in my opening lecture[323] about the\nprevalence of the psychopathic temperament in religious\nbiography.  You will in point of fact hardly find a religious\nleader of any kind in whose life there is no record of\nautomatisms.  I speak not merely of savage priests and prophets,\nwhose followers regard automatic utterance and action as by\nitself tantamount to inspiration, I speak of leaders of thought\nand subjects of intellectualized experience.  Saint Paul had his\nvisions, his ecstasies, his gift of tongues, small as was the\nimportance he attached to the latter. The whole array of\nChristian saints and heresiarchs, including the greatest, the\nBarnards, the Loyolas, the Luthers, the Foxes, the Wesleys, had\ntheir visions, voices, rapt conditions, guiding impressions, and\n“openings.”    They had these things, because they had exalted\nsensibility, and to such things persons of exalted sensibility\nare liable.  In such liability there lie, however, consequences\nfor theology.  Beliefs are strengthened wherever automatisms\ncorroborate them.  Incursions from beyond the transmarginal\nregion have a peculiar power to increase conviction.  The\ninchoate sense of presence is infinitely stronger than\nconception, but strong as it may be, it is seldom equal to the\nevidence of hallucination.  Saints who actually see or hear their\nSaviour reach the acme of assurance.  Motor automatisms, though\nrarer, are, if possible, even more convincing than sensations. \nThe subjects here actually feel themselves played upon by powers\nbeyond their will.  The evidence is dynamic; the God or spirit\nmoves the very organs of their body.[324]",
        "[323] Above, pp. 25, 26.",
        "[324] A friend of mine, a first-rate psychologist, who is a\nsubject of graphic automatism, tells me that the appearance of\nindependent actuation in the movements of his arm, when he writes\nautomatically, is so distinct that it obliges him to abandon a\npsychophysical theory which he had previously believed in, the\ntheory, namely, that we have no feeling of the discharge\ndownwards of our voluntary motor-centres.  We must normally have\nsuch a feeling, he thinks, or the SENSE OF AN ABSENCE would not\nbe so striking as it is in these experiences.  Graphic automatism\nof a fully developed kind is rare in religious history, so far as\nmy knowledge goes.  Such statements as Antonia Bourignon’s, that\n“I do nothing but lend my hand and spirit to another power than\nmine,” is shown by the context to indicate inspiration rather\nthan directly automatic writing.  In some eccentric sects this\nlatter occurs.  The most striking instance of it is probably the\nbulky volume called, “Oahspe, a new Bible in the Words of Jehovah\nand his angel ambassadors,” Boston and London, 1891, written and\nillustrated automatically by Dr. Newbrough of New York, whom I\nunderstand to be now, or to have been lately, at the head of the\nspiritistic community of Shalam in New Mexico.  The latest\nautomatically written book which has come under my notice is\n“Zertouhem’s Wisdom of the Ages,” by George A. Fuller, Boston,\n1901.",
        "The great field for this sense of being the instrument of a\nhigher power is of course “inspiration.”  It is easy to\ndiscriminate between the religious leaders who have been\nhabitually subject to inspiration and those who have not.  In the\nteachings of the Buddha, of Jesus, of Saint Paul (apart from his\ngift of tongues), of Saint Augustine, of Huss, of Luther, of\nWesley, automatic or semi-automatic composition appears to have\nbeen only occasional.  In the Hebrew prophets, on the contrary,\nin Mohammed, in some of the Alexandrians, in many minor Catholic\nsaints, in Fox, in Joseph Smith, something like it appears to\nhave been frequent, sometimes habitual.  We have distinct\nprofessions of being under the direction of a foreign power, and\nserving as its mouthpiece.  As regards the Hebrew prophets, it is\nextraordinary, writes an author who has made a careful study of\nthem, to see–",
        "“How, one after another, the same features are reproduced in the\nprophetic books.  The process is always extremely different from\nwhat it would be if the prophet arrived at his insight into\nspiritual things by the tentative efforts of his own genius.\nThere is something sharp and sudden about it.  He can lay his\nfinger, so to speak, on the moment when it came.  And it always\ncomes in the form of an overpowering force from without, against\nwhich he struggles, but in vain.  Listen, for instance, [to] the\nopening of the book of Jeremiah.  Read through in like manner the\nfirst two chapters of the prophecy of Ezekiel.",
        "“It is not, however, only at the beginning of his career that the\nprophet passes through a crisis which is clearly not self-\ncaused.  Scattered all through the prophetic writings are\nexpressions which speak of some strong and irresistible impulse\ncoming down upon the prophet, determining his attitude to the\nevents of his time, constraining his utterance, making his words\nthe vehicle of a higher meaning than their own.  For instance,\nthis of Isaiah’s:  ’The Lord spake thus to me with a strong\nhand,’–an emphatic phrase which denotes the overmastering nature\nof the impulse–’and instructed me that I should not walk in the\nway of this people.’ . . . Or passages like this from Ezekiel: \n’The hand of the Lord God fell upon me,’ ’The hand of the Lord\nwas strong upon me.’ The one standing characteristic of the\nprophet is that he speaks with the authority of Jehovah himself. \nHence it is that the prophets one and all preface their addresses\nso confidently, ’The Word of the Lord,’ or ’Thus saith the Lord.’\nThey have even the audacity to speak in the first person, as if\nJehovah himself were speaking.  As in Isaiah:  ’Hearken unto me,\nO Jacob, and Israel my called; I am He, I am the First, I also am\nthe last,’–and so on.  The personality of the prophet sinks\nentirely into the background; he feels himself for the time being\nthe mouthpiece of the Almighty.\"[325]",
        "[325] W. Sanday:  The Oracles of God, London, 1892, pp. 49-56,\nabridged.",
        "“We need to remember that prophecy was a profession, and that the\nprophets formed a professional class.  There were schools of the\nprophets, in which the gift was regularly cultivated.  A group of\nyoung men would gather round some commanding figure–a Samuel or\nan Elisha–and would not only record or spread the knowledge of\nhis sayings and doings, but seek to catch themselves something of\nhis inspiration.  It seems that music played its part in their\nexercises. . . .  It is perfectly clear that by no means all of\nthese Sons of the prophets ever succeeded in acquiring more than\na very small share in the gift which they sought.  It was clearly\npossible to ’counterfeit’ prophecy.  Sometimes this was done\ndeliberately. . . .  But it by no means follows that in all cases\nwhere a false message was given, the giver of it was altogether\nconscious of what he was doing.[326]",
        "[326] Op. cit., p. 91.  This author also cites Moses’s and\nIsaiah’s commissions, as given in Exodus, chaps. iii. and iv.,\nand Isaiah, chap. vi.",
        "Here, to take another Jewish case, is the way in which Philo of\nAlexandria describes his inspiration:–",
        "“Sometimes, when I have come to my work empty, I have suddenly\nbecome full; ideas being in an invisible manner showered upon me,\nand implanted in me from on high; so that through the influence\nof divine inspiration, I have become greatly excited, and have\nknown neither the place in which I was, nor those who were\npresent, nor myself, nor what I was saying, nor what I was\nwriting, for then I have been conscious of a richness of\ninterpretation, an enjoyment of light, a most penetrating\ninsight, a most manifest energy in all that was to be done;\nhaving such effect on my mind as the clearest ocular\ndemonstration would have on the eyes.\"[327]",
        "[327] Quoted by Augustus Clissold:  The Prophetic Spirit in\nGenius and Madness, 1870, p. 67.  Mr. Clissold is a\nSwedenborgian.  Swedenborg’s case is of course the palmary one of\naudita et visa, serving as a basis of religious revelation.",
        "If we turn to Islam, we find that Mohammed’s revelations all came\nfrom the subconscious sphere.  To the question in what way he got\nthem–",
        "“Mohammed is said to have answered that sometimes he heard a\nknell as from a bell, and that this had the strongest effect on\nhim; and when the angel went away, he had received the\nrevelation.  Sometimes again he held converse with the angel as\nwith a man, so as easily to understand his words.  The later\nauthorities, however, . . . distinguish still other kinds.  In\nthe Itgan (103) the following are enumerated:  1, revelations\nwith sound of bell, 2, by inspiration of the holy spirit in M.’s\nheart, 3, by Gabriel in human form, 4, by God immediately, either\nwhen awake (as in his journey to heaven) or in dream. . . . In\nAlmawahib alladuniya the kinds are thus given:  1, Dream, 2,\nInspiration of Gabriel in the Prophet’s heart, 3, Gabriel taking\nDahya’s form, 4, with the bell-sound, etc., 5, Gabriel in propria\npersona (only twice), 6, revelation in heaven, 7, God appearing\nin person, but veiled, 8, God revealing himself immediately\nwithout veil.  Others add two other stages, namely:  1, Gabriel\nin the form of still another man, 2, God showing himself\npersonally in dream.\"[328]",

        "In none of these cases is the revelation distinctly motor. In the\ncase of Joseph Smith (who had prophetic revelations innumerable\nin addition to the revealed translation of the <472> gold plates\nwhich resulted in the Book of Mormon), although there may have\nbeen a motor element, the inspiration seems to have been\npredominantly sensorial.  He began his translation by the aid of\nthe “peep-stones” which he found, or thought or said that he\nfound, with the gold plates –apparently a case of “crystal\ngazing.”  For some of the other revelations he used the\npeep-stones, but seems generally to have asked the Lord for more\ndirect instruction.[329]",
        "[329] The Mormon theocracy has always been governed by direct\nrevelations accorded to the President of the Church and its\nApostles.  From an obliging letter written to me in 1899 by an\neminent Mormon, I quote the following extract:–",
        "“It may be very interesting for you to know that the President\n[Mr. Snow] of the Mormon Church claims to have had a number of\nrevelations very recently from heaven.  To explain fully what\nthese revelations are, it is necessary to know that we, as a\npeople, believe that the Church of Jesus Christ has again been\nestablished through messengers sent from heaven.  This Church has\nat its head a prophet seer, and revelator, who gives to man God’s\nholy will.  Revelation is the means through which the will of God\nis declared directly and in fullness to man.  These revelations\nare got through dreams of sleep or in waking visions of the mind,\nby voices without visional appearance or by actual manifestations\nof the Holy Presence before the eye.  We believe that God has\ncome in person and spoken to our prophet and revelator.”",
        "Other revelations are described as “openings\"–Fox’s, for\nexample, were evidently of the kind known in spiritistic circles\nof to-day as “impressions.”  As all effective initiators of\nchange must needs live to some degree upon this psychopathic\nlevel of sudden perception or conviction of new truth, or of\nimpulse to action so obsessive that it must be worked off, I will\nsay nothing more about so very common a phenomenon.",
        "When, in addition to these phenomena of inspiration, we take\nreligious mysticism into the account, when we recall the striking\nand sudden unifications of a discordant self which we saw in\nconversion, and when we review the extravagant obsessions of\ntenderness, purity, and self-severity met with in saintliness, we\ncannot, I think, avoid the conclusion that in religion we have a\ndepartment of human nature with unusually close relations to the\ntransmarginal or subliminal region.  If the word “subliminal” is\noffensive to any of you, as smelling too much of psychical\nresearch or other aberrations, call it by any other name you\nplease, to distinguish it from the level of full sunlit\nconsciousness.  Call this latter the A-region of personality, if\nyou care to, and call the other the B-region.  The B-region,\nthen, is obviously the larger part of each of us, for it is the\nabode of everything that is latent and the reservoir of\neverything that passes unrecorded or unobserved.  It contains,\nfor example, such things as all our momentarily inactive\nmemories, and it harbors the springs of all our obscurely motived\npassions, impulses, likes, dislikes, and prejudices.  Our\nintuitions, hypotheses, fancies, superstitions, persuasions,\nconvictions, and in general all our non-rational operations, come\nfrom it.  It is the source of our dreams, and apparently they may\nreturn to it.  In it arise whatever mystical experiences we may\nhave, and our automatisms, sensory or motor; our life in hypnotic\nand “hypnoid” conditions, if we are subjects to such conditions;\nour delusions, fixed ideas, and hysterical accidents, if we are\nhysteric subjects; our supra-normal cognitions, if such there be,\nand if we are telepathic subjects.  It is also the fountain-head\nof much that feeds our religion. In persons deep in the religious\nlife, as we have now abundantly seen–and this is my\nconclusion–the door into this region seems unusually wide open;\nat any rate, experiences making their entrance through that door\nhave had emphatic influence in shaping religious history.",
        "With this conclusion I turn back and close the circle which I\nopened in my first lecture, terminating thus the review which I\nthen announced of inner religious phenomena as we find them in\ndeveloped and articulate human individuals.  I might easily, if\nthe time allowed, multiply both my documents and my\ndiscriminations, but a broad treatment is, I believe, in itself\nbetter, and the most important characteristics of the subject\nlie, I think, before us already. In the next lecture, which is\nalso the last one, we must try to draw the critical conclusions\nwhich so much material may suggest.",
