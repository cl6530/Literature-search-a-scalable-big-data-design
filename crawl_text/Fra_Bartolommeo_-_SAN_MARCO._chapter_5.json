        "Padre Marchese, himself a Dominican, speaks thus of his convent:–\"San\nMarco has within its walls the Renaissance, a compendium in two\nartists. Fra Angelico, the painter of the ideal, Fra Bartolommeo, of\nform. The first closes the antique Tuscan school. He who has seen Fra\nAngelico, has seen also Giotto, Cimabue, &c. The second represents the\nmodern school. In him are almost comprised Masaccio, Lorenzo di Credi,\nLeonardo, Buonarroti, and Andrea del Sarto.”",
        "The first, Fra Angelico, “sets himself to contemplate in God the fount\nand architype of the beautiful, and, as much as is possible to mortal\nhands, reproduces and stamps it in those works which a sensual mind\ncannot understand, but which to the heavenly soul speak an eloquent\nlanguage. Fra Bartolommeo, with more analysis, works thoughtfully ...\nhe ascends from the effect to the cause, and in created things\ncontemplates a reflection of spiritual beauty.”",
        "It is true the Dominican order has been as great a patron of arts as\nthe Franciscan of literature. It united with Niccolo Pisano to give\nform to national architecture. It had sculptors, miniaturists, and\nglass painters. As a building San Marco has been a shrine of art; since\nthe time that Michelozzi, with the assistance of the Medici, built the\nconvent for Sant’ Antonino, and Fra Angelico left the impress of his\nsoul on the walls, a long line of artist monks has lived within its\ncloisters. With San Marco our story has now to deal, for it is\nimpossible to write Fra Bartolommeo’s life without touching on the\nwell-known history of Savonarola. The great preacher’s influence in\nthese years, from 1492 to 1497, entered into almost every individual in\nFlorence, either to draw them to devotion, or to stir them up to the\ngreatest opposition.",
        "The artists, whose minds were probably the most impressional, were his\nfervent adherents. He has been accused of being the ruin of art, but\n“this cry has only arisen in our time; the silence of contemporaries,\nalthough not friendly to him, proves that he was not in that century so\naccused.” [Footnote: Gino Capponi, Storia delta Republica di\nFirenze, lib. vi. chap. ii.] The only mention of anything of\nartistic value is a “tavoliere” [Footnote: A chess or draught board.]\nof rich work, spoken of by Burlamacchi and Benivieni, in a “Canzone di\nun Piagnone sul bruciamento delle Vanità.” Savonarola himself was an\nartist and musician in early life, the love of the beautiful was strong\nwithin him, only he would have it go hand in hand with the good and\ntrue. His dominant spirit was that of reform; as he tried to regenerate\nmind, morals, literature, and state government, so he would reform art,\nand fling over it the spiritual light which illumed his own soul.",
        "It was natural that such a mind should act on the devotional character\nof Baccio. What could he do but join when every church was full of\nworshippers, each shrine at the street corners had a crowd of devout\nwomen on their knees before it–when thousands of faces were uplifted\nin the vast expanse of the Duomo, and every face burned with fervour as\nthe divine flame from the preacher lit the lamp of each soul–when in\nthe streets he met long processions of men, women, and children, the\nechoes of whose hymns (Laudi) filled the narrow streets, and went up to\nthe clear air above them?",
        "Then came that strange carnival when there were no maskers in the city,\nbut white-robed boys went from house to house to collect the vanities\nfor the burning–when the flames of the fires, hitherto saturnalian,\nwere the flames of a holocaust, wherein each one cast the sins and\ntemptations, even the pretty things which, though dear to himself,\nwithdrew him from God. And when the white-robed boys came to the studio\nof the friends at the gate of S. Pier Gattolini, with what sighs and\nself-immolation Baccio looked for the last time at some of his studies\nwhich he judged to come under the head of anathemata, and handed\nthem over to the acolytes. How Mariotto’s soul, warm to Pagan art,\nburned within him at this sacrifice! And how he would talk more than\never against the monks, and hang up his own cartoons and studies of the\nGreek Venus in the studio for Baccio’s behoof!",
        "In these years we have no notice of authentic works done by the\nyouthful partners, though biographers talk of their having commissions\nfor madonnas, and other works of art.",
        "In 1497 Francesco Valori, the grand-featured, earnest admirer of\nSavonarola, became Gonfaloniere in the time of Piero de’ Medici’s\nexile, [Footnote: Gino Capponi, Storia delta Republica di\nFirenze, lib. vi. chap. xi. p. 233.] and the friar’s party was in\nthe ascendent. Rosini [Footnote: Storia delta Pittura, chap.\nxvii. p. 48.] says that belonging to a faction was a means of fame, and\nthat the Savonarola party was powerful, giving this as a reason for\nBaccio’s partisanship; but this we can hardly believe, his whole life\nproved his earnestness. He was much beloved in Florence for his calm\nupright nature and good qualities. He delighted in the society of pious\nand learned men, spent much time in the convent, where he had many\nfriends among the monks; yet with all he kept still faithful to his\nearly friend Mariotto, whose life was cast so differently. Savonarola’s\nfaction was powerful, but the Medici had still adherents who stirred up\na strong party against him.",
        "His spirit of reform at length aroused the ire of the Pope, who forbade\nhim to preach. He disobeyed, and the sermons on Ezekiel were scenes of\ntumult; no longer a group of rapt faces dwelling on his words, but\nfrowns, murmurs, and anathemas from a crowd only kept off him by a\ncircle of armed adherents round his pulpit.",
        "At length, on June 22nd, the excommunication by Pope Alessandro VI.\n(Borgia) fell like a thunderclap, and the Medicean youths marched in\ntriumphant procession with torches and secular music to burlesque the\nLaudi; no doubt Albertinelli was one of these, while Baccio grieved\namong the awestruck friars in the convent.",
        "In 1498 Savonarola again lifted up his voice; the church was not large\nenough, so he preached beneath the blue sky on the Piazza San Marco;\nand Fra Domenico Buonvicini da Pescia, in the eagerness of\npartisanship, said that his master’s words would stand the ordeal of\nfire. Then came that tumultuous day of April 7th, the “Sunday of the\nOlives,” when the Franciscans and Dominicans argued while the fire\nburnt out before them, when Savonarola’s great spirit quailed within\nhim, and the ordeal failed; a merciful rain quenching the flames which\nnone dared to brave save the undaunted Fra Domenico himself.",
        "There was no painting done in the studio on that day we may be sure.\nBaccio was one of the surging, conflicting crowd gathered beneath the\nmingling shadows of Orcagna’s arches and Arnolfo’s great palace, and at\neventide he was one of the armed partisans who protected the friar back\nto his convent, menaced not only by rains from heaven, but by the\nstormy wrath of an angry populace, defrauded of the sight they came to\nsee.",
        "The next day was the one which determined the painter’s future life.",
        "There was in the city a curious process of crystallisation of all the\nparticles held in solution round the fire the previous day. The Palazzo\nVecchio attracted about its doors the “Arrabiati.” The “Compagnacci\"\nassembled, armed, by the Duomo. The streets were full of detached\nparties of Piagnoni, treading ways of peril to their centre, San Marco.",
        "Passions raged and seethed all day, till at the hour of vespers a cry\narose, “à San Marco,” and thither the multitude–500 Compagnacci, and\n300 Palleschi–rushed, armed with picks and arquebusses, &c. They killed\nsome stray Piagnoni whom they found praying by a shrine, and placed\nguards at the streets which led to the convent; then the assault began.",
        "The church was dimly lighted. Savonarola and Fra Domenico kneeled on\nthe steps of the altar, with many worshippers around them, singing\ntremulous hymns; amongst these were Francesco Valori, Ridolfi, and\nBaccio della Porta, but all armed, as Cronaca tells us. They still sang\nhymns when the doors were attacked with stones; then leaving the\npriests and women to pray for them the men rushed to the defence.",
        "Old Valori, with a few brave friends, guarded the door; others made\nloop-holes of the windows and fired out; some went up the campanile,\nand some on the roof. Baccio fought bravely among the rest. The\nPalleschi were almost repulsed, but at length succeeded in setting fire\nto the doors. The church was filled with smoke; a turbulent crowd\nrushed wildly in. Savonarola saw his people fall dead beside him on the\naltar steps, and, taking up the Sacrament, he fled to the Greek\nlibrary, where the messengers of the Signoria came and arrested both\nhimself and Fra Domenico. It was in the fierce fight that ensued when\nthe enemies poured in, laying hands sacrilegiously on every thing\nsacred, that Baccio made the vow that if he were saved this peril, he\nwould take the habit–a vow which certainly was not made in a cowardly\nspirit, he fighting to the death, and then espousing the losing cause.\n[Footnote: Gino Capponi, lib. vi. chaps. i. and ii., and Padre\nMarchese, San Marco, p. 147 et seq.]",
        "Then came that sad 23rd of May, the eve of the Ascension, when three\nmartyrs went calmly to their death beneath the shadow of the old\npalace, amidst the insults of an infuriated crowd, and Arno’s yellow\nwaters received their ashes. [Footnote: Capponi, chap. ii. p. 253.]",
        "[Illustration: SAVONAROLO AS PETER MARTYR. BY FRA BARTOLOMMEO. In\nthe Accademia delle Belle Arti, Florence.]",
        "After the death of Savonarola the party had many defaulters; but\nBaccio, the Delia Robbias, Credi, Cronaca, and many other artists, were\nfaithful, and even showed their grief by abandoning for a time the arts\nthey loved. “It almost seemed as if with him they had lost the sacred\nflame from which their fervid imagination drew life and aliment.\"\n[Footnote: Marchese, San Marco, lib. iii. p. 261.]",
        "While all these events had been taking place, Baccio had worked as\noften as his perturbed spirit would allow, at a great fresco of the\nLast Judgment, in a chapel of the cemetery of S. Maria Nuova. A\ncertain Gerozzi, di Monna Venna Dini, gave him the commission, and as\nfar as he had gone, the painter had given entire satisfaction. This\nfresco, his first as far as is known, shows Baccio’s style as fully as\nhis later ones. We have here his great harmony of form, and intense\nsuggestiveness in composition. The infinity of heaven is emblematised\nin circles of saints and cherubim around the enthroned Christ. The\ncross, a link between heaven and earth, is borne by a trinity of\nangels; S. Michael, as the avenging spirit, stands a powerful figure in\nthe foreground dividing the saved from the lost; the whole composition\nforming a heavenward cross on an earthly foundation. There are no caves\nand holes of torture with muscular bodies writhing within them; but in\nthe despairing figures passing away on the right, some with heads bowed\non clasped hands, others lifting up faces and arms in a vain cry for\nmercy, what suggestions there are of infinite remorse!–more dignified\nfar than the distorted sufferers in the torture pits of previous\nmasters. These are just indicated by two demons, and a subterranean\nfire behind the unblest souls. Miss Owen, [Footnote: Art Schools of\nChristendom, edited by Prof. Ruskin.] speaking Mr. Ruskin’s\nsentiments, calls this a great falling off from Giotto and Orcagna’s\nconceptions; but though theirs may be more powerful and terrible, a\ngreater suggestion of Christian religion is here.",
        "They, and later, Michelangelo, flung Dante’s great struggling soul in\ntangible forms upon the walls, and embodied his poem, awful, grand, and\nearnest, with all the human passion intensified into human suffering.\nFra Bartolommeo shows the Christian spirit; his faces look beyond the\npresent judgment, and, instead of wrath, mercy is the predominating\nidea. It is like the difference in spirit between the Old Testament and\nthe New.",
        "The painter’s reverence of Fra Angelico, and estimation of the divinity\nof art, is shown by Fra Angelico being placed among the saints of\nheaven on the right of the Saviour.",
        "Leonardo’s instructions for shading off a light sky will occur to any\none who studies the finely gradated tints mingling with the clouds\naround the celestial group. But grand as the fresco is, and interesting\nas it must have been to the artist at this time, when thoughts of\nSavonarola mingled with every stroke, he felt he was not fulfilling his\ntrue mission in the world. Drawn more and more to the convent, hallowed\nto him by the memory of the martyr-friar, he was also more attuned to\nthoughts of retirement by family bereavements–one young brother,\nPiero, only being left to him out of the whole circle. The reluctance\nto leave this youth alone may have deferred for a time his taking the\nmonastic vows; but having placed him under the guardianship of Santi\nPagnini, a Dominican, he consigned the Last Judgment to Mariotto\nto finish, and leaving his worldly goods to his brother, took the habit\nin the convent of S. Domenico, at Prato, on July 26th, 1500, two years\nafter first making the resolution. His year of probation over, he took\nthe final vows and became Fra Bartolommeo.",
        "A document in S. Marco proves that he was possessed of worldly goods\nwhen he entered, [Footnote: Rosini, Storia della Pittura, chap\nxxvii.] among which were the house of his father in S. Pier Gattolini,\nand the podere at Brozzi. Having once given himself up to monasticism,\nFra Bartolommeo would offer no half-service, his brushes were left\nbehind with all other worldly things, and here closes Baccio della\nPorta’s first artistic career.",
        "His sun was set only to rise again to greater brilliance in the future\nas Fra Bartolommeo, a name famous for ever in the annals of art.",
