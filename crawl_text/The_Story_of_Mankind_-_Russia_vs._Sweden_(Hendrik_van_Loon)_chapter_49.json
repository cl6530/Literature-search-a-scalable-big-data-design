        "RUSSIA AND SWEDEN FIGHT MANY WARS TO\nDECIDE WHO SHALL BE THE LEADING\nPOWER OF NORTH-EASTERN EUROPE",
        "IN the year 1698, Tsar Peter set forth upon his first\nvoyage to western Europe. He travelled by way of Berlin and\nwent to Holland and to England. As a child he had almost\nbeen drowned sailing a homemade boat in the duck pond of\nhis father’s country home. This passion for water remained\nwith him to the end of his life. In a practical way it showed\nitself in his wish to give his land-locked domains access to\nthe open sea.",
        "While the unpopular and harsh young ruler was away\nfrom home, the friends of the old Russian ways in Moscow set\nto work to undo all his reforms. A sudden rebellion among\nhis life-guards, the Streltsi regiment, forced Peter to hasten\nhome by the fast mail. He appointed himself executioner-in-\nchief and the Streltsi were hanged and quartered and killed to\nthe last man. Sister Sophia, who had been the head of the\nrebellion, was locked up in a cloister and the rule of Peter be-\ngan in earnest. This scene was repeated in the year 1716 when\nPeter had gone on his second western trip. That time the\nreactionaries followed the leadership of Peter’s half-witted\nson, Alexis. Again the Tsar returned in great haste. Alexis\nwas beaten to death in his prison cell and the friends of the\nold fashioned Byzantine ways marched thousands of dreary\nmiles to their final destination in the Siberian lead mines.\nAfter that, no further outbreaks of popular discontent took\nplace. Until the time of his death, Peter could reform in peace.",
        "It is not easy to give you a list of his reforms in chronological\norder. The Tsar worked with furious haste. He followed\nno system. He issued his decrees with such rapidity that it is\ndifficult to keep count. Peter seemed to feel that everything\nthat had ever happened before was entirely wrong. The whole\nof Russia therefore must be changed within the shortest possible\ntime. When he died he left behind a well-trained army of\n200,000 men and a navy of fifty ships. The old system of government\nhad been abolished over night. The Duma, or convention\nof Nobles, had been dismissed and in its stead, the Tsar\nhad surrounded himself with an advisory board of state officials,\ncalled the Senate.",
        "Russia was divided into eight large “governments” or provinces.\nRoads were constructed. Towns were built. Industries\nwere created wherever it pleased the Tsar, without any regard\nfor the presence of raw material. Canals were dug and mines\nwere opened in the mountains of the east. In this land of illiterates,\nschools were founded and establishments of higher learning,\ntogether with Universities and hospitals and professional\nschools. Dutch naval engineers and tradesmen and artisans\nfrom all over the world were encouraged to move to Russia.\nPrinting shops were established, but all books must be first read\nby the imperial censors. The duties of each class of society\nwere carefully written down in a new law and the entire system\nof civil and criminal laws was gathered into a series of printed\nvolumes. The old Russian costumes were abolished by Imperial\ndecree, and policemen, armed with scissors, watching\nall the country roads, changed the long-haired Russian mou-\njiks suddenly into a pleasing imitation of smooth-shaven west.\nEuropeans.",
        "In religious matters, the Tsar tolerated no division of\npower. There must be no chance of a rivalry between an\nEmperor and a Pope as had happened in Europe. In the year\n1721, Peter made himself head of the Russian Church. The\nPatriarchate of Moscow was abolished and the Holy Synod\nmade its appearance as the highest source of authority in all\nmatters of the Established Church.",
        "Since, however, these many reforms could not be success-\nful while the old Russian elements had a rallying point in the\ntown of Moscow, Peter decided to move his government to a\nnew capital. Amidst the unhealthy marshes of the Baltic Sea\nthe Tsar built this new city. He began to reclaim the land in\nthe year 1703. Forty thousand peasants worked for years\nto lay the foundations for this Imperial city. The Swedes\nattacked Peter and tried to destroy his town and illness and\nmisery killed tens of thousands of the peasants. But the work\nwas continued, winter and summer, and the ready-made town\nsoon began to grow. In the year 1712, it was officially de-\nclared to be the “Imperial Residence.” A dozen years later\nit had 75,000 inhabitants. Twice a year the whole city was\nflooded by the Neva. But the terrific will-power of the Tsar\ncreated dykes and canals and the floods ceased to do harm.\nWhen Peter died in 1725 he was the owner of the largest city\nin northern Europe.",
        "Of course, this sudden growth of so dangerous a rival had\nbeen a source of great worry to all the neighbours. From his\nside, Peter had watched with interest the many adventures of\nhis Baltic rival, the kingdom of Sweden. In the year 1654,\nChristina, the only daughter of Gustavus Adolphus, the hero\nof the Thirty Years War, had renounced the throne and had\ngone to Rome to end her days as a devout Catholic. A Protestant\nnephew of Gustavus Adolphus had succeeded the last\nQueen of the House of Vasa. Under Charles X and Charles\nXI, the new dynasty had brought Sweden to its highest point\nof development. But in 1697, Charles XI died suddenly and\nwas succeeded by a boy of fifteen, Charles XII.",
        "This was the moment for which many of the northern states\nhad waited. During the great religious wars of the seventeenth\ncentury, Sweden had grown at the expense of her neighbours.\nThe time had come, so the owners thought, to balance the account.\nAt once war broke out between Russia, Poland, Denmark\nand Saxony on the one side, and Sweden on the other.\nThe raw and untrained armies of Peter were disastrously beaten\nby Charles in the famous battle of Narva in November of\nthe year 1700. Then Charles, one of the most interesting military\ngeniuses of that century, turned against his other enemies\nand for nine years he hacked and burned his way through the\nvillages and cities of Poland, Saxony, Denmark and the Baltic\nprovinces, while Peter drilled and trained his soldiers in distant\nRussia.",
        "As a result, in the year 1709, in the battle of Poltawa, the\nMoscovites destroyed the exhausted armies of Sweden. Charles\ncontinued to be a highly picturesque figure, a wonderful hero\nof romance, but in his vain attempt to have his revenge, he\nruined his own country. In the year 1718, he was accidentally\nkilled or assassinated (we do not know which) and when peace\nwas made in 1721, in the town of Nystadt, Sweden had lost all\nof her former Baltic possessions except Finland. The new\nRussian state, created by Peter, had become the leading power\nof northern Europe. But already a new rival was on the\nway. The Prussian state was taking shape.",
