        "A merchant started his son in life with three hundred rupees, and bade\nhim go to another country and try his luck in trade. The son took the\nmoney and departed. He had not gone far before he came across some\nherdsmen quarrelling over a dog, that some of them wished to kill.\n“Please do not kill the dog,” pleaded the young and tender-hearted\nfellow; “I will give you one hundred rupees for it.” Then and there, of\ncourse, the bargain was concluded, and the foolish fellow took the dog,\nand continued his journey. He next met with some people fighting about\na cat. Some of them wanted to kill it, but others not. “Oh! please do\nnot kill it,” said he; “I will give you one hundred rupees for it.” Of\ncourse they at once gave him the cat and took the money. He went on\ntill he reached a village, where some folk were quarrelling over a\nsnake that had just been caught. Some of them wished to kill it, but\nothers did not. “Please do not kill the snake,” said he; “I will give\nyou one hundred rupees.” Of course the people agreed, and were highly\ndelighted.",
        "What a fool the fellow was! What would he do now that all his money was\ngone? What could he do except return to his father? Accordingly he went\nhome.",
        "“You fool! You scamp!” exclaimed his father when he had heard how his\nson had wasted all the money that had been given to him. “Go and live\nin the stables and repent of your folly. You shall never again enter my\nhouse.”",
        "So the young man went and lived in the stables. His bed was the grass\nspread for the cattle, and his companions were the dog, the cat, and\nthe snake, which he had purchased so dearly. These creatures got very\nfond of him, and would follow him about during the day, and sleep by\nhim at night; the cat used to sleep at his feet, the dog at his head,\nand the snake over his body, with its head hanging on one side and its\ntail on the other.",
        "One day the snake in course of conversation said to its master, “I am\nthe son of Raja Indrasha. One day, when I had come out of the ground to\ndrink the air, some people seized me, and would have slain me had you\nnot most opportunely arrived to my rescue. I do not know how I shall\never be able to repay you for your great kindness to me. Would that you\nknew my father! How glad he would be to see his son’s preserver!”",
        "“Where does he live? I should like to see him, if possible,” said the\nyoung man.",
        "“Well said!” continued the snake. “Do you see yonder mountain? At the\nbottom of that mountain there is a sacred spring. If you will come with\nme and dive into that spring, we shall both reach my father’s country.\nOh! how glad he will be to see you! He will wish to reward you, too.\nBut how can he do that? However, you may be pleased to accept something\nat his hand. If he asks you what you would like, you would, perhaps, do\nwell to reply, ’The ring on your right hand, and the famous pot and\nspoon which you possess.’ With these in your possession, you would\nnever need anything, for the ring is such that a man has only to speak\nto it, and immediately a beautiful furnished mansion will be provided\nfor him, while the pot and the spoon will supply him with all manner of\nthe rarest and most delicious foods.”",
        "Attended by his three companions the man walked to the well and\nprepared to jump in, according to the snake’s directions. “O master!\"\nexclaimed the cat and dog, when they saw what he was going to do. “What\nshall we do? Where shall we go?”",
        "“Wait for me here,” he replied. “I am not going far. I shall not be\nlong away.” On saying this, he dived into the water and was lost to\nsight.",
        "“Now what shall we do?” said the dog to the cat. “We must remain here,\"\nreplied the cat, “as our master ordered. Do not be anxious about food.\nI will go to the people’s houses and get plenty of food for both of\nus.” And so the cat did, and they both lived very comfortably till\ntheir master came again and joined them.",
        "The young man and the snake reached their destination in safety; and\ninformation of their arrival was sent to the Raja. His highness\ncommanded his son and the stranger to appear before him. But the snake\nrefused, saying that it could not go to its father till it was released\nfrom this stranger, who had saved it from a most terrible death, and\nwhose slave it therefore was. Then the Raja went and embraced his son,\nand saluting the stranger welcomed him to his dominions. The young man\nstayed there a few days, during which he received the Raja’s right-hand\nring, and the pot and spoon, in recognition of His Highness’s gratitude\nto him for having delivered his son. He then returned. On reaching the\ntop of the spring he found his friends, the dog and the cat, waiting\nfor him. They told one another all they had experienced since they had\nlast seen each other, and were all very glad. Afterwards they walked\ntogether to the river side, where it was decided to try the powers of\nthe charmed ring and pot and spoon.",
        "The merchant’s son spoke to the ring, and immediately a beautiful house\nand a lovely princess with golden hair appeared. He spoke to the pot\nand spoon, also, and the most delicious dishes of food were provided\nfor them. So he married the princess, and they lived very happily for\nseveral years, until one morning the princess, while arranging her\ntoilet, put the loose hairs into a hollow bit of reed and threw them\ninto the river that flowed along under the window. The reed floated on\nthe water for many miles, and was at last picked up by the prince of\nthat country, who curiously opened it and saw the golden hair. On\nfinding it the prince rushed off to the palace, locked himself up in\nhis room, and would not leave it. He had fallen desperately in love\nwith the woman whose hair he had picked up, and refused to eat, or\ndrink, or sleep, or move, till she was brought to him. The king, his\nfather, was in great distress about the matter, and did not know what\nto do. He feared lest his son should die and leave him without an heir.\nAt last he determined to seek the counsel of his aunt, who was an\nogress. The old woman consented to help him, and bade him not to be\nanxious, as she felt certain that she would succeed in getting the\nbeautiful woman for his son’s wife.",
        "She assumed the shape of a bee and went along buzzing, and buzzing, and\nbuzzing. Her keen sense of smell soon brought her to the beautiful\nprincess, to whom she appeared as an old hag, holding in one hand a\nstick by way of support. She introduced herself to the beautiful\nprincess and said, “I am your aunt, whom you have never seen before,\nbecause I left the country just after your birth.” She also embraced\nand kissed the princess by way of adding force to her words. The\nbeautiful princess was thoroughly deceived. She returned the ogress’s\nembrace, and invited her to come and stay in the house as long as she\ncould, and treated her with such honour and attention, that the ogress\nthought to herself, “I shall soon accomplish my errand.” When she had\nbeen in the house three days, she began to talk of the charmed ring,\nand advised her to keep it instead of her husband, because the latter\nwas constantly out shooting and on other such-like expeditions, and\nmight lose it. Accordingly the beautiful princess asked her husband for\nthe ring, and he readily gave it to her.",
        "The ogress waited another day before she asked to see the precious\nthing. Doubting nothing, the beautiful princess complied, when the\nogress seized the ring, and reassuming the form of a bee flew away with\nit to the palace, where the prince was lying nearly on the point of\ndeath. “Rise up. Be glad. Mourn no more,” she said to him. “The woman\nfor whom you yearn will appear at your summons. See, here is the charm,\nwhereby you may bring her before you.” The prince was almost mad with\njoy when he heard these words, and was so desirous of seeing the\nbeautiful princess, that he immediately spoke to the ring, and the\nhouse with its fair occupant descended in the midst of the palace\ngarden. He at once entered the building, and telling the beautiful\nprincess of his intense love, entreated her to be his wife. Seeing no\nescape from the difficulty, she consented on the condition that he\nwould wait one month for her.",
        "Meanwhile the merchant’s son had returned from hunting and was terribly\ndistressed not to find his house and wife. There was the place only,\njust as he knew it before he had tried the charmed ring which Raja\nIndrasha had given him. He sat down and determined to put an end to\nhimself. Presently the cat and dog came up. They had gone away and\nhidden themselves, when they saw the house and everything disappear. “O\nmaster!” they said, “stay your hand. Your trial is great, but it can be\nremedied. Give us one month, and we will go and try to recover your\nwife and house.”",
        "“Go,” said he, “and may the great God aid your efforts. Bring back my\nwife, and I shall live.”",
        "So the cat and dog started off at a run, and did not stop till they\nreached the place whither their mistress and the house had been taken.\n“We may have some difficulty here,” said the cat. “Look, the king has\ntaken our master’s wife and house for himself. You stay here. I will go\nto the house and try to see her.” So the dog sat down, and the cat\nclimbed up to the window of the room, wherein the beautiful princess\nwas sitting, and entered. The princess recognised the cat, and informed\nit of all that had happened to her since she had left them.",
        "“But is there no way of escape from the hands of these people?” she\nasked.",
        "“Yes,” replied the cat, “if you can tell me where the charmed ring is.”",
        "“The ring is in the stomach of the ogress,” she said.",
        "“All right,” said the cat, “I will recover it. If we once get it,\neverything is ours.” Then the cat descended the wall of the house, and\nwent and laid down by a rat’s hole and pretended she was dead. Now at\nthat time a great wedding chanced to be going on among the rat\ncommunity of that place, and all the rats of the neighbourhood were\nassembled in that one particular mine by which the cat had lain down.\nThe eldest son of the king of the rats was about to be married. The cat\ngot to know of this, and at once conceived the idea of seizing the\nbridegroom and making him render the necessary help. Consequently, when\nthe procession poured forth from the hole squealing and jumping in\nhonour of the occasion, it immediately spotted the bridegroom and\npounced down on him. “Oh! let me go, let me go,” cried the terrified\nrat. “Oh! let him go,” squealed all the company. “It is his wedding\nday.”",
        "“No, no,” replied the cat. “Not unless you do some thing for me.\nListen. The ogress, who lives in that house with the prince and his\nwife, has swallowed a ring, which I very much want. If you will procure\nit for me, I will allow the rat to depart unharmed. If you do not, then\nyour prince dies under my feet.”",
        "“Very well, we agree,” said they all. “Nay, if we do not get the ring\nfor you, devour us all.”",
        "This was rather a bold offer. However, they accomplished the thing. At\nmidnight, when the ogress was sound asleep, one of the rats went to her\nbedside, climbed up on her face, and inserted its tail into her throat;\nwhereupon the ogress coughed violently, and the ring came out and\nrolled on to the floor. The rat immediately seized the precious thing\nand ran off with it to its king, who was very glad, and went at once to\nthe cat and released its son.",
        "As soon as the cat received the ring, she started back with the dog to\ngo and tell their master the good tidings. All seemed safe now. They\nhad only to give the ring to him, and he would speak to it, and the\nhouse and beautiful princess would again be with them, and everything\nwould go on as happily as before. “How glad master will be!” they\nthought, and ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Now, on the\nway they had to cross a stream. The dog swam, and the cat sat on its\nback. Now the dog was jealous of the cat, so he asked for the ring, and\nthreatened to throw the cat into the water if it did not give it up;\nwhereupon the cat gave up the ring. Sorry moment, for the dog at once\ndropped it, and a fish swallowed it.",
        "“Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?” said the dog.",
        "“What is done is done,” replied the cat. “We must try to recover it,\nand if we do not succeed we had better drown ourselves in this stream.\nI have a plan. You go and kill a small lamb, and bring it here to me.”",
        "“All right,” said the dog, and at once ran off. He soon came back with\na dead lamb, and gave it to the cat. The cat got inside the lamb and\nlay down, telling the dog to go away a little distance and keep quiet.\nNot long after this a nadhar, a bird whose look can break the bones of\na fish, came and hovered over the lamb, and eventually pounced down on\nit to carry it away. On this the cat came out and jumped on to the\nbird, and threatened to kill it if it did not recover the lost ring.\nThis was most readily promised by the nadhar, who immediately flew off\nto the king of the fishes, and ordered it to make inquiries and to\nrestore the ring. The king of the fishes did so, and the ring was found\nand carried back to the cat.",
        "“Come along now; I have got the ring,” said the cat to the dog.",
        "“No, I will not,” said the dog, “unless you let me have the ring. I can\ncarry it as well as you. Let me have it or I will kill you.” So the cat\nwas obliged to give up the ring. The careless dog very soon dropped it\nagain. This time it was picked up and carried off by a kite.",
        "“See, see, there it goes–away to that big tree,” the cat exclaimed.",
        "“Oh! oh! what have I done?” cried the dog.",
        "“You foolish thing, I knew it would be so,” said the cat. “But stop\nyour barking, or you will frighten away the bird to some place where we\nshall not be able to trace it.”",
        "The cat waited till it was quite dark, and then climbed the tree,\nkilled the kite, and recovered the ring. “Come along,” it said to the\ndog when it reached the ground. “We must make haste now. We have been\ndelayed. Our master will die from grief and suspense. Come on.”",
        "The dog, now thoroughly ashamed of itself, begged the cat’s pardon for\nall the trouble it had given. It was afraid to ask for the ring the\nthird time, so they both reached their sorrowing master in safety and\ngave him the precious charm. In a moment his sorrow was turned into\njoy. He spoke to the ring, and his beautiful wife and house reappeared,\nand he and everybody were as happy as ever they could be.",
