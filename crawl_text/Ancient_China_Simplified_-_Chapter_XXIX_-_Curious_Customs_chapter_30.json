        "In laying stress upon the barbarous, or semi-barbarous, quality of\nthe states (all in our days considered pure Chinese), which\nsurrounded the federal area at even so late a period as 771 B.C.,\nwe wish to emphasize a point which has never yet been made quite\nclear, perhaps not even made patent by their own critics to the\nChinese themselves; that is to say, the very small and modest\nbeginnings of the civilized patriarchal federation called the\nCentral Kingdom, or Chu Hia–\"All the Hia\"–just as we say,\n“All the Russias.”",
        "In allotting precedence to the various states, the historical\neditors, of course, always put the Emperor first in order of\nmention; then comes CHENG, the first ruler of which state was son\nof an Emperor of the then ruling imperial house; next, the three\nProtectors Ts’i, Tsin, and Sung; then follow the petty states of\nWei, Ts’ai, Ts’ao, and T’eng, all of the imperial family name, or,\nas we say in English, “surname,” and all lying between the Hwai\nand the Sz systems (T’eng was a “belonging state” of Lu). Then\ncome half a dozen petty orthodox states of less honourable family\nnames; next, three Eastern barbarian states, which had become\n“Central Kingdom,” or which, once genuine Chinese, had become half\nbarbarian; and finally, Ts’u, Ts’in, Wu, and Yiieh, which were\nfrankly, if vaguely, “outer barbarian-Tartar.”",
        "It has already been demonstrated that there is evidence, however\nimperfect, to show that the mass of the population of Ts’u and Wu\nwere of decidedly foreign origin. Even as to Ts’i, which was\nalways treated as an orthodox principality, it is stated that the\nfounder sent there in or about 1100 B.C. “conformed to the manners\nof the place, and encouraged manufactures, commerce, salt and fish\nindustries.” On the other hand, the son of the Duke of Chou (the\nfirst vassal prince appointed by his brother the Emperor) changed\nthe customs of Lu, modified the local rites, and induced the\npeople to keep on their mourning attire for three full years. It\nwas considered that the Ts’i policy was the wiser of the two, and\nit was foretold that Lu would always “look up to” Ts’i in\nconsequence of this superior judgment on the part of Ts’i. On\nfrequent occasions the petty adjoining “Chinesified” states, of\nwhich Lu was practically the mesne lord, are stated to have been\n“tainted with Eastern barbarian rites.” From and including modern\nSue-chou (North Kiang Su) and eastward, all were “Eastern\nbarbarians\"; in fact, the city just named (mentioned by the name\nof Sue in 1100 B.C., and again about 950 B.C., as revolting\nagainst the Emperor) perpetuates the “Sue barbarians” country,\nwhich was for long a bone of contention between Ts’i and Ts’u, and\nafterwards Wu; and the name “Hwai savages” proves that the Lower\nHwai Valley was also independent. The Hwai savages, who appear in\nthe Tribute of Yue, founder of the Hia dynasty, 2205 B.C., revolted\n1000 years later against the founders of the Chou dynasty. They\nwere present at Ts’u’s first durbar in 538 B.C., and are mentioned\nas barbarians still resisting Chinese methods so late as A.D. 970.\nIn Confucius’ time the Lai barbarians (modern Lai-thou Fu in the\nGerman sphere) were employed by Ts’i, who had conquered them in\n567 B.C., to try and effect the assassination of Confucius’\nmaster. Six hundred years before that, these same barbarians were\namong the first to give in their submission to the founder of\nTs’i; and in 602 B.C. both Ts’i and Lu had endeavoured to crush\nthem.",
        "As to the state of Ts’in, there is not a single instance given of\nany literary conversation or correspondence held by an orthodox\nhigh functionary with a Ts’in statesman. While it is not yet quite\nclear that orthodox China can shake herself entirely free of the\nreproach of human sacrifices in all senses, it is quite certain\nthat Ts’in had a barbarous and exclusive notoriety in this\nregard’; and, as the Hiung-nu Tartars also practised it, and Ts’in\nwas at least half Tartar in blood, it is probable that she derived\nher sanguinary notions from this blood connection with the Turko-\nScythian tribes. On the death of the Ts’in ruler in 678 B.C., the\nfirst recorded human sacrifices were made, “sixty-six individuals\nfollowing the dead.” In 621, on the death of the celebrated Duke\nMuh, 177 persons lost their lives, and the people of Ts’in, in\npity, “composed the Yellow Bird Ode” (of these popular Chinese\nodes more anon). This holocaust was given as one reason why Ts’in\ncould never “rule in the East,” i.e. assume the Protectorate over\nthe orthodox powers all lying to its east, on account of this cruel defect\nin its laws. In 387 B.C., the new Earl of Ts’in (who succeeded a nephew,\nand therefore could, having no paternal duty to fulfil, introduce the\ninnovation more cheaply) abolished the principle of human sacrifices\nat the death of a ruler. Ten years later, the Emperor’s astrologer paid\na visit to Ts’in;–evidence that the imperial civilizing influence was\nstill, at least morally, active, This astrologer and historiographer,\nwhose name was Tan, is interesting, inasmuch as he has been\nconfused with Li Tan (the personal name of the philosopher Lao-\ntsz, who was also an imperial official employed in the historiographical\ndepartment). It is added that, previous to this visit, for five hundred\nyears Ts’in and Chou had kept apart from each other. Notwithstanding\nthis prohibition of human sacrifices, when the First August Emperor of\nUniversal China died in 210 B.C., the old Ts’in custom was reintroduced,\nand all his women who had not given birth to children were buried with\nhim. Besides this, all the workmen who had made the secret door and\npassage to his grave were cemented in alive, so that they might never\ndisclose the secret of its approaches.",
        "It was only after gradually adopting Chinese civilization that\nTs’in began to be a considerable power; thus, when Ki-chah of Wu\nwas entertained at Lu with specimens of the various styles of\nmusic, he observed, on being regaled with Ts’in music: “Ah!\ncivilized sounds; it has succeeded in refining itself; it is in\noccupation of the old Chou appanage.” So late as 361 B.C., when\nNgwei (one of the three royal subdivisions of old Tsin) built a\nwall to keep off Ts’in, both Ngwei and Ts’u (which by this time\nwas quite as good orthodox Chinese as any other state) treated\nTs’in as though the latter were still barbarian, In 326 Ts’in\nfirst introduced into her realm the well-known year-end sacrifices\nof the orthodox Chinese, which fact alone points to a long\nisolation of Ts’in before this date.",
        "The rule of succession in Ts’in seems to have been of the Tartar\nkind at one time. Duke Muh, in 660 B.C., succeeded his brother,\nthough that brother had seven sons of his own living: that brother\nagain, had also succeeded a brother.",
        "As to Yueeh, there is no question as to its barbarism, though the\none single king around whose name centres the whole glory of Yiieh\n(Kou-tsien, 496-475) seems to have been a man of great ability and\nsome fine feeling. The native name for Yiieh was Yue-yueeh,\nas stated in Chapter VII.; and it seems likely that all the coast\nof China down to Tonquin, or Northern Annam, was then inhabited by\ncognate tribes, all having the syllable Yueeh, or Viet, in\ntheir names. The great empire or kingdom of Yiieh, founded upon\nthe ruins of Wu, soon split up into the “Hundred Yiieh,” i.e. (probably)\nit relapsed into its native barbarism, and ceased to cohere as a\npolitical factor. “Southern Yueeh” (the Canton region) has undoubted\nhistorical connections with the Tonquin part of Annam, and several\nother of the subdivisions of Yiieh, corresponding to Foochow, Wenchow,\netc., show distinct traces of having belonged to the same race. But it is\nunsafe to say how the Chinese-transcribed name Yii-yiieh was\npronounced; still more unsafe is it to argue that it must have been U\nor O-viet simply because the Annamese so pronounce the word\nnow. We have seen that, according to one historical statement, the\nWu and Yiieh people spoke the same language; in which case the\nmembers of the ruling Wu caste who fled to Japan in 473 B.C. were\nprobably not of the same race as the “savages around them.” As an\nact of bravado, in 481, the King of Wu made five condemned\ncenturions cut their own throats before the Tsin envoy, in order\nto show what effectively stern discipline he kept, In 484 the King\nof Yiieh had already committed a similar act of bravado; but\nneither of these barbarian states is distinctly recorded to have\nindulged in human sacrifices at the death of a sovereign. Previous\nto the crushing of Wu by Yiieh, in 473 B.C., Yiieh was nearly\nannihilated by Wu, and on this occasion Kou-tsien’s envoy\nadvanced crawling on his knees to beg for mercy; this is hardly an\northodox Chinese custom. However barbarous Yiieh may have been,\nits ruling house possessed traditions of descent, through a\nconcubine, from an emperor of the Hia dynasty; for which reason\nthe founder was enfeoffed, near modern Shao-hing, west of Ningpo,\nin order to fulfil the sacrifices to the founder of the Hia\ndynasty, who was, and is, supposed to be buried there: like the\nfirst colonists who migrated to Wu, he cut his hair, tattooed\nhimself, opened up the jungle, and built a town. In 330 B.C. Kou-\ntsien’s descendant spoke of “taking the road left to Chu-\nhia,” through modern Ho Nan province; that means taking the\nhigh-road to China proper. The term originated in times when Ts’u\nhad not yet become a recognized “Hia.” The fact that Yueeh, with\nits new capital then in Shan Tung, could never govern the Yang-tsz\nand Hwai inland regions, seems to prove that her power was always\npurely a water power, and that she was comparatively ignorant of\nland campaigns.",
