        "  God give us men.  A time like this demands\n  Strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and ready hands;\n  Men whom the lust of office does not kill;\n  Men who possess opinions and a will;\n  Men who have honor;\n  Men who will not lie,\n  Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog\n  In public duly and in private thinking.\n  For, while the rabble, with their thumb-worn creeds,\n  Their large professions and their little deeds,\n  Mingle in selfish strife, lo!  Freedom weeps,\n  Wrong rules the land, and waiting Justice sleeps.\n  God give us men!",
