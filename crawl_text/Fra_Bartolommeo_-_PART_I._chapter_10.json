        "Of these, little more than the names have come down to us. Vasari\nspeaks of Benedetto Cianfanini, Gabbriele Rustici, and Fra Paolo\nPistojese; Padre Marchese mentions two monks, Fra Andrea and Fra\nAgostino. Of these, the two first never became proficient, and have\nleft no works behind them. Fra Andrea seems to have been more a\njourneyman than scholar, being employed to prepare the panels and lay\non the gilding. Fra Agostino assisted his master, and Fra Paolo in the\nsubordinate parts of a few frescoes, especially at Luco in the Mugnone.\nFra Paolo is the most known, but chiefly as a far-off imitator of Fra\nBartolommeo, without his mellowness of execution. His pictures are\nmostly from his master’s designs, which were left him as a legacy, and\nthis ensures a good composition.",
        "He was born at Pistoja in 1490; his father, Bernardino d’ Antonio del\nSignoraccio, a second-rate artist, taught him the first principles of\nart. His knowledge of drawing caused him to be noticed by Fra\nBartolommeo, when at a very early age he entered the order. He was\nremoved from Prato to San Marco, Florence, in 1503; and here he found\nanother friend who assisted his artistic tendencies. This was Fra\nAmbrogio della Robbia, [Footnote: Padre Marchese, Memorie, &c., lib.\nin. chap. ii. p. 246.] who taught him to model in clay; a specimen of\nhis work exists in the Church of Sta. Maddalena in Pian di Mugnone,\nwhere are two statues of S. Domenico and Mary Magdalen by his hand.",
        "His best work is a Crucifixion at Siena, dated 1516, which has\nbeen thought to be Fra Bartolommeo’s; but though that master was asked\nto go and paint it as a memorial of a certain Messer Cherubino Ridolfo,\nhis many occupations prevented his accepting the commission, and his\ndisciples, Fra Paolo and Fra Agostino, went in his place. [Footnote:\nPadre Marchese, Memorie, &c., lib. in. chap. ii. p. 251.] Possibly the\nmaster supplied the design, which is very harmonious. The Virgin and S.\nJohn stand on each side of the cross, and Saint Catherine of Siena and\nMary Magdalen are prostrate before it. One or two of the female saints\nare pleasing, but the nude figure of Christ is hard, exaggerated, and\nfaulty in drawing.",
        "The artists got thirty-five lire for the work, though the record in the\narchives allows that it was worth more. There is an Assumption\nin the Belle Arti of Florence, of which the design is Fra\nBartolommeo’s, but the colouring Fra Paolo’s. It was painted for the\nDominican monks at Santa Maria del Sasso, near Bibbiena. The colouring\nis hard and weak, the shadows heavy, and not fused well in the half\ntints. Two monks on the left are tolerably life-like, probably they\nwere drawn from living models; the S. Catherine on the right is very\ninferior.",
        "The Belle Arti also possesses a Deposition from the Cross, which\nFra Bartolommeo had sketched out and left uncoloured at Pian di\nMugnone. In 1519 Fra Paolo finished it, and it presents the usual\ndisparity between the composition and colouring, the former being good,\nthe latter weak and crude. His best known works are a Nativity in the\nPalazzo Borghese, a Madonna and Child with S. John Baptist in\nthe Sciarra Colonna, also in Rome; a Madonna and Child with S.\nJohn in the Corsini Gallery, Florence, and another of the same\nsubject in the Antinori Palace. He painted also at San Gimignano, Pian\ndi Mugnone, and Pistoja, and died of sunstroke in 1547.",
        "He had as a follower a Suor Plautilla Nelli, born 1523, daughter of a\nnoble Florentine, Piero di Luca Nelli. She took the vows at the age of\nfourteen, in the convent of S. Caterina di Siena, in Via Larga (now\nCavour), Florence. Her sister, Suor Petronilla, in the same convent,\nwas a writer, and her life of Savonarola is still extant. Suor\nPlautilla taught herself to paint. Legend says, that in order to study\nthe nude for a Christ, she drew from the corpse of a nun–which might\naccount for the weak stiffness of her design. Fra Paolo, though there\nis no record of his having taught her, left her as a legacy the designs\nand cartoons of Fra Bartolommeo, one of which, the Pietà, she\nhas evidently made use of in the painting in the Belle Arti. The\ngrouping is that of the Pietà of Fra Bartolommeo, now in the\nPitti, of which she must have had the original sketch, for she has put\nin the two saints in the background, which have been painted out in\nthat of the Frate, but we will give her the entire credit of the\ncolouring, which is extremely crude; the contrasting blues and yellows\nare in inharmonious tones, the shading harsh, and the whole picture\nwanting in chiaroscuro. The Corsini Gallery, Florence, has a Virgin\nand Child by her.",
