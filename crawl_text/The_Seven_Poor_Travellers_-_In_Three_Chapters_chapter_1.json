        "Strictly speaking, there were only six Poor Travellers; but, being a\nTraveller myself, though an idle one, and being withal as poor as I\nhope to be, I brought the number up to seven.  This word of\nexplanation is due at once, for what says the inscription over the\nquaint old door?",
        "\nRICHARD WATTS, Esq.\nby his Will, dated 22 Aug. 1579,\nfounded this Charity\nfor Six poor Travellers,\nwho not being ROGUES, or PROCTORS,\nMay receive gratis for one Night,\nLodging, Entertainment,\nand Fourpence each.",
        "\nIt was in the ancient little city of Rochester in Kent, of all the\ngood days in the year upon a Christmas-eve, that I stood reading\nthis inscription over the quaint old door in question.  I had been\nwandering about the neighbouring Cathedral, and had seen the tomb of\nRichard Watts, with the effigy of worthy Master Richard starting out\nof it like a ship’s figure-head; and I had felt that I could do no\nless, as I gave the Verger his fee, than inquire the way to Watts’s\nCharity.  The way being very short and very plain, I had come\nprosperously to the inscription and the quaint old door.",
        "“Now,” said I to myself, as I looked at the knocker, “I know I am\nnot a Proctor; I wonder whether I am a Rogue!”",
        "Upon the whole, though Conscience reproduced two or three pretty\nfaces which might have had smaller attraction for a moral Goliath\nthan they had had for me, who am but a Tom Thumb in that way, I came\nto the conclusion that I was not a Rogue.  So, beginning to regard\nthe establishment as in some sort my property, bequeathed to me and\ndivers co-legatees, share and share alike, by the Worshipful Master\nRichard Watts, I stepped backward into the road to survey my\ninheritance.",
        "I found it to be a clean white house, of a staid and venerable air,\nwith the quaint old door already three times mentioned (an arched\ndoor), choice little long low lattice-windows, and a roof of three\ngables.  The silent High Street of Rochester is full of gables, with\nold beams and timbers carved into strange faces.  It is oddly\ngarnished with a queer old clock that projects over the pavement out\nof a grave red-brick building, as if Time carried on business there,\nand hung out his sign.  Sooth to say, he did an active stroke of\nwork in Rochester, in the old days of the Romans, and the Saxons,\nand the Normans; and down to the times of King John, when the rugged\ncastle—I will not undertake to say how many hundreds of years old\nthen—was abandoned to the centuries of weather which have so\ndefaced the dark apertures in its walls, that the ruin looks as if\nthe rooks and daws had pecked its eyes out.",
        "I was very well pleased, both with my property and its situation.\nWhile I was yet surveying it with growing content, I espied, at one\nof the upper lattices which stood open, a decent body, of a\nwholesome matronly appearance, whose eyes I caught inquiringly\naddressed to mine.  They said so plainly, “Do you wish to see the\nhouse?” that I answered aloud, “Yes, if you please.”  And within a\nminute the old door opened, and I bent my head, and went down two\nsteps into the entry.",
        "“This,” said the matronly presence, ushering me into a low room on\nthe right, “is where the Travellers sit by the fire, and cook what\nbits of suppers they buy with their fourpences.”",
        "“O!  Then they have no Entertainment?” said I.  For the inscription\nover the outer door was still running in my head, and I was mentally\nrepeating, in a kind of tune, “Lodging, entertainment, and fourpence\neach.”",
        "“They have a fire provided for ’em,” returned the matron—a mighty\ncivil person, not, as I could make out, overpaid; “and these cooking\nutensils.  And this what’s painted on a board is the rules for their\nbehaviour.  They have their fourpences when they get their tickets\nfrom the steward over the way,—for I don’t admit ’em myself, they\nmust get their tickets first,—and sometimes one buys a rasher of\nbacon, and another a herring, and another a pound of potatoes, or\nwhat not.  Sometimes two or three of ’em will club their fourpences\ntogether, and make a supper that way.  But not much of anything is\nto be got for fourpence, at present, when provisions is so dear.”",
        "“True indeed,” I remarked.  I had been looking about the room,\nadmiring its snug fireside at the upper end, its glimpse of the\nstreet through the low mullioned window, and its beams overhead.\n“It is very comfortable,” said I.",
        "“Ill-conwenient,” observed the matronly presence.",
        "I liked to hear her say so; for it showed a commendable anxiety to\nexecute in no niggardly spirit the intentions of Master Richard\nWatts.  But the room was really so well adapted to its purpose that\nI protested, quite enthusiastically, against her disparagement.",
        "“Nay, ma’am,” said I, “I am sure it is warm in winter and cool in\nsummer.  It has a look of homely welcome and soothing rest.  It has\na remarkably cosey fireside, the very blink of which, gleaming out\ninto the street upon a winter night, is enough to warm all\nRochester’s heart.  And as to the convenience of the six Poor\nTravellers—”",
        "“I don’t mean them,” returned the presence.  “I speak of its being\nan ill-conwenience to myself and my daughter, having no other room\nto sit in of a night.”",
        "This was true enough, but there was another quaint room of\ncorresponding dimensions on the opposite side of the entry:  so I\nstepped across to it, through the open doors of both rooms, and\nasked what this chamber was for.",
        "“This,” returned the presence, “is the Board Room.  Where the\ngentlemen meet when they come here.”",
        "Let me see.  I had counted from the street six upper windows besides\nthese on the ground-story.  Making a perplexed calculation in my\nmind, I rejoined, “Then the six Poor Travellers sleep upstairs?”",
        "My new friend shook her head.  “They sleep,” she answered, “in two\nlittle outer galleries at the back, where their beds has always\nbeen, ever since the Charity was founded.  It being so very ill-\nconwenient to me as things is at present, the gentlemen are going to\ntake off a bit of the back-yard, and make a slip of a room for ’em\nthere, to sit in before they go to bed.”",
        "“And then the six Poor Travellers,” said I, “will be entirely out of\nthe house?”",
        "“Entirely out of the house,” assented the presence, comfortably\nsmoothing her hands.  “Which is considered much better for all\nparties, and much more conwenient.”",
        "I had been a little startled, in the Cathedral, by the emphasis with\nwhich the effigy of Master Richard Watts was bursting out of his\ntomb; but I began to think, now, that it might be expected to come\nacross the High Street some stormy night, and make a disturbance\nhere.",
        "Howbeit, I kept my thoughts to myself, and accompanied the presence\nto the little galleries at the back.  I found them on a tiny scale,\nlike the galleries in old inn-yards; and they were very clean.",
        "While I was looking at them, the matron gave me to understand that\nthe prescribed number of Poor Travellers were forthcoming every\nnight from year’s end to year’s end; and that the beds were always\noccupied.  My questions upon this, and her replies, brought us back\nto the Board Room so essential to the dignity of “the gentlemen,\"\nwhere she showed me the printed accounts of the Charity hanging up\nby the window.  From them I gathered that the greater part of the\nproperty bequeathed by the Worshipful Master Richard Watts for the\nmaintenance of this foundation was, at the period of his death, mere\nmarsh-land; but that, in course of time, it had been reclaimed and\nbuilt upon, and was very considerably increased in value.  I found,\ntoo, that about a thirtieth part of the annual revenue was now\nexpended on the purposes commemorated in the inscription over the\ndoor; the rest being handsomely laid out in Chancery, law expenses,\ncollectorship, receivership, poundage, and other appendages of\nmanagement, highly complimentary to the importance of the six Poor\nTravellers.  In short, I made the not entirely new discovery that it\nmay be said of an establishment like this, in dear old England, as\nof the fat oyster in the American story, that it takes a good many\nmen to swallow it whole.",
        "“And pray, ma’am,” said I, sensible that the blankness of my face\nbegan to brighten as the thought occurred to me, “could one see\nthese Travellers?”",
        "“Well!” she returned dubiously, “no!”",
        "“Not to-night, for instance!” said I.",
        "“Well!” she returned more positively, “no.  Nobody ever asked to see\nthem, and nobody ever did see them.”",
        "As I am not easily balked in a design when I am set upon it, I urged\nto the good lady that this was Christmas-eve; that Christmas comes\nbut once a year,—which is unhappily too true, for when it begins to\nstay with us the whole year round we shall make this earth a very\ndifferent place; that I was possessed by the desire to treat the\nTravellers to a supper and a temperate glass of hot Wassail; that\nthe voice of Fame had been heard in that land, declaring my ability\nto make hot Wassail; that if I were permitted to hold the feast, I\nshould be found conformable to reason, sobriety, and good hours; in\na word, that I could be merry and wise myself, and had been even\nknown at a pinch to keep others so, although I was decorated with no\nbadge or medal, and was not a Brother, Orator, Apostle, Saint, or\nProphet of any denomination whatever.  In the end I prevailed, to my\ngreat joy.  It was settled that at nine o’clock that night a Turkey\nand a piece of Roast Beef should smoke upon the board; and that I,\nfaint and unworthy minister for once of Master Richard Watts, should\npreside as the Christmas-supper host of the six Poor Travellers.",
        "I went back to my inn to give the necessary directions for the\nTurkey and Roast Beef, and, during the remainder of the day, could\nsettle to nothing for thinking of the Poor Travellers.  When the\nwind blew hard against the windows,—it was a cold day, with dark\ngusts of sleet alternating with periods of wild brightness, as if\nthe year were dying fitfully,—I pictured them advancing towards\ntheir resting-place along various cold roads, and felt delighted to\nthink how little they foresaw the supper that awaited them.  I\npainted their portraits in my mind, and indulged in little\nheightening touches.  I made them footsore; I made them weary; I\nmade them carry packs and bundles; I made them stop by finger-posts\nand milestones, leaning on their bent sticks, and looking wistfully\nat what was written there; I made them lose their way; and filled\ntheir five wits with apprehensions of lying out all night, and being\nfrozen to death.  I took up my hat, and went out, climbed to the top\nof the Old Castle, and looked over the windy hills that slope down\nto the Medway, almost believing that I could descry some of my\nTravellers in the distance.  After it fell dark, and the Cathedral\nbell was heard in the invisible steeple—quite a bower of frosty\nrime when I had last seen it—striking five, six, seven, I became so\nfull of my Travellers that I could eat no dinner, and felt\nconstrained to watch them still in the red coals of my fire.  They\nwere all arrived by this time, I thought, had got their tickets, and\nwere gone in.—There my pleasure was dashed by the reflection that\nprobably some Travellers had come too late and were shut out.",
        "After the Cathedral bell had struck eight, I could smell a delicious\nsavour of Turkey and Roast Beef rising to the window of my adjoining\nbedroom, which looked down into the inn-yard just where the lights\nof the kitchen reddened a massive fragment of the Castle Wall.  It\nwas high time to make the Wassail now; therefore I had up the\nmaterials (which, together with their proportions and combinations,\nI must decline to impart, as the only secret of my own I was ever\nknown to keep), and made a glorious jorum.  Not in a bowl; for a\nbowl anywhere but on a shelf is a low superstition, fraught with\ncooling and slopping; but in a brown earthenware pitcher, tenderly\nsuffocated, when full, with a coarse cloth.  It being now upon the\nstroke of nine, I set out for Watts’s Charity, carrying my brown\nbeauty in my arms.  I would trust Ben, the waiter, with untold gold;\nbut there are strings in the human heart which must never be sounded\nby another, and drinks that I make myself are those strings in mine.",
        "The Travellers were all assembled, the cloth was laid, and Ben had\nbrought a great billet of wood, and had laid it artfully on the top\nof the fire, so that a touch or two of the poker after supper should\nmake a roaring blaze.  Having deposited my brown beauty in a red\nnook of the hearth, inside the fender, where she soon began to sing\nlike an ethereal cricket, diffusing at the same time odours as of\nripe vineyards, spice forests, and orange groves,—I say, having\nstationed my beauty in a place of security and improvement, I\nintroduced myself to my guests by shaking hands all round, and\ngiving them a hearty welcome.",
        "I found the party to be thus composed.  Firstly, myself.  Secondly,\na very decent man indeed, with his right arm in a sling, who had a\ncertain clean agreeable smell of wood about him, from which I judged\nhim to have something to do with shipbuilding.  Thirdly, a little\nsailor-boy, a mere child, with a profusion of rich dark brown hair,\nand deep womanly-looking eyes.  Fourthly, a shabby-genteel personage\nin a threadbare black suit, and apparently in very bad\ncircumstances, with a dry suspicious look; the absent buttons on his\nwaistcoat eked out with red tape; and a bundle of extraordinarily\ntattered papers sticking out of an inner breast-pocket.  Fifthly, a\nforeigner by birth, but an Englishman in speech, who carried his\npipe in the band of his hat, and lost no time in telling me, in an\neasy, simple, engaging way, that he was a watchmaker from Geneva,\nand travelled all about the Continent, mostly on foot, working as a\njourneyman, and seeing new countries,—possibly (I thought) also\nsmuggling a watch or so, now and then.  Sixthly, a little widow, who\nhad been very pretty and was still very young, but whose beauty had\nbeen wrecked in some great misfortune, and whose manner was\nremarkably timid, scared, and solitary.  Seventhly and lastly, a\nTraveller of a kind familiar to my boyhood, but now almost\nobsolete,—a Book-Pedler, who had a quantity of Pamphlets and\nNumbers with him, and who presently boasted that he could repeat\nmore verses in an evening than he could sell in a twelvemonth.",
        "All these I have mentioned in the order in which they sat at table.\nI presided, and the matronly presence faced me.  We were not long in\ntaking our places, for the supper had arrived with me, in the\nfollowing procession:",
        "\nMyself with the pitcher.\nBen with Beer.\nInattentive Boy with hot plates.  Inattentive Boy with hot plates.\nTHE TURKEY.\nFemale carrying sauces to be heated on the spot.\nTHE BEEF.\nMan with Tray on his head, containing Vegetables and Sundries.\nVolunteer Hostler from Hotel, grinning,\nAnd rendering no assistance.",
        "\nAs we passed along the High Street, comet-like, we left a long tail\nof fragrance behind us which caused the public to stop, sniffing in\nwonder.  We had previously left at the corner of the inn-yard a\nwall-eyed young man connected with the Fly department, and well\naccustomed to the sound of a railway whistle which Ben always\ncarries in his pocket, whose instructions were, so soon as he should\nhear the whistle blown, to dash into the kitchen, seize the hot\nplum-pudding and mince-pies, and speed with them to Watts’s Charity,\nwhere they would be received (he was further instructed) by the\nsauce-female, who would be provided with brandy in a blue state of\ncombustion.",
        "All these arrangements were executed in the most exact and punctual\nmanner.  I never saw a finer turkey, finer beef, or greater\nprodigality of sauce and gravy;—and my Travellers did wonderful\njustice to everything set before them.  It made my heart rejoice to\nobserve how their wind and frost hardened faces softened in the\nclatter of plates and knives and forks, and mellowed in the fire and\nsupper heat.  While their hats and caps and wrappers, hanging up, a\nfew small bundles on the ground in a corner, and in another corner\nthree or four old walking-sticks, worn down at the end to mere\nfringe, linked this smug interior with the bleak outside in a golden\nchain.",
        "When supper was done, and my brown beauty had been elevated on the\ntable, there was a general requisition to me to “take the corner;\"\nwhich suggested to me comfortably enough how much my friends here\nmade of a fire,—for when had I ever thought so highly of the\ncorner, since the days when I connected it with Jack Horner?\nHowever, as I declined, Ben, whose touch on all convivial\ninstruments is perfect, drew the table apart, and instructing my\nTravellers to open right and left on either side of me, and form\nround the fire, closed up the centre with myself and my chair, and\npreserved the order we had kept at table.  He had already, in a\ntranquil manner, boxed the ears of the inattentive boys until they\nhad been by imperceptible degrees boxed out of the room; and he now\nrapidly skirmished the sauce-female into the High Street,\ndisappeared, and softly closed the door.",
        "This was the time for bringing the poker to bear on the billet of\nwood.  I tapped it three times, like an enchanted talisman, and a\nbrilliant host of merry-makers burst out of it, and sported off by\nthe chimney,—rushing up the middle in a fiery country dance, and\nnever coming down again.  Meanwhile, by their sparkling light, which\nthrew our lamp into the shade, I filled the glasses, and gave my\nTravellers, CHRISTMAS!—CHRISTMAS-EVE, my friends, when the\nshepherds, who were Poor Travellers, too, in their way, heard the\nAngels sing, “On earth, peace.  Good-will towards men!”",
        "I don’t know who was the first among us to think that we ought to\ntake hands as we sat, in deference to the toast, or whether any one\nof us anticipated the others, but at any rate we all did it.  We\nthen drank to the memory of the good Master Richard Watts.  And I\nwish his Ghost may never have had worse usage under that roof than\nit had from us.",
        "It was the witching time for Story-telling.  “Our whole life,\nTravellers,” said I, “is a story more or less intelligible,—\ngenerally less; but we shall read it by a clearer light when it is\nended.  I, for one, am so divided this night between fact and\nfiction, that I scarce know which is which.  Shall I beguile the\ntime by telling you a story as we sit here?”",
        "They all answered, yes.  I had little to tell them, but I was bound\nby my own proposal.  Therefore, after looking for awhile at the\nspiral column of smoke wreathing up from my brown beauty, through\nwhich I could have almost sworn I saw the effigy of Master Richard\nWatts less startled than usual, I fired away.",
