        "Herr Sesemann, a good deal irritated and excited, went quickly\nupstairs and along the passage to Fraulein Rottenmeier’s room,\nand there gave such an unusually loud knock at the door that the\nlady awoke from sleep with a cry of alarm. She heard the master\nof the house calling to her from the other side of the door,\n“Please make haste and come down to me in the dining-room; we\nmust make ready for a journey at once.” Fraulein Rottenmeier\nlooked at her clock: it was just half-past four; she had never\ngot up so early before in her life. What could have happened?\nWhat with her curiosity and excitement she took hold of\neverything the wrong way, and it was a case with her of more\nhaste less speed, for she kept on searching everywhere for\ngarments which she had already put on.",
        "Meanwhile Herr Sesemann had gone on farther and rung the bells\nin turn which communicated with the several servants’ rooms,\ncausing frightened figures to leap out of bed, convinced that the\nghost had attacked the master and that he was calling for help.\nOne by one they made their appearance in the dining-room, each\nwith a more terrified face than the last, and were astonished to\nsee their master walking up and down, looking well and cheerful,\nand with no appearance of having had an encounter with a ghost.\nJohn was sent off without delay to get the horses and carriage\nready; Tinette was ordered to wake Heidi and get her dressed for\na journey; Sebastian was hurried off to the house where Dete was\nin service to bring the latter round. Then Fraulein Rottenmeier,\nhaving at last accomplished her toilet, came down, with\neverything well adjusted about her except her cap, which was put\non hind side before. Herr Sesemann put down her flurried\nappearance to the early awakening he had caused her, and began\nwithout delay to give her directions. She was to get out a trunk\nat once and pack up all the things belonging to the Swiss child–\nfor so he usually spoke of Heidi, being unaccustomed to her name–\nand a good part of Clara’s clothes as well, so that the child\nmight take home proper apparel; but everything was to be done\nimmediately, as there was no time for consideration.",
        "Fraulein Rottenmeier stood as if rooted to the spot and stared\nin astonishment at Herr Sesemann. She had quite expected a long\nand private account of some terrible ghostly experience of his\nduring the night, which she would have enjoyed hearing about in\nthe broad daylight. Instead of this there were these prosaic and\ntroublesome directions, which were so unexpected that she took\nsome time to get over her surprise and disappointment, and\ncontinued standing awaiting further explanation.",
        "But Herr Sesemann had no thought or time for explanations and\nleft her standing there while he went to speak to Clara. As he\nanticipated, the unusual commotion in the house had disturbed\nher, and she was lying and listening and wondering what had\nhappened. So he sat down and told her everything that had\noccurred during the past night, and explained that the doctor\nhad given his verdict and pronounced Heidi to be in a very highly\nstrung state, so that her nightly wanderings might gradually\nlead her farther and farther, perhaps even on to the roof, which\nof course would be very dangerous for her. And so they had\ndecided to send her home at once, as he did not like to take the\nresponsibility of her remaining, and Clara would see for herself\nthat it was the only thing to do. Clara was very much\ndistressed, and at first made all kinds of suggestions for\nkeeping Heidi with her; but her father was firm, and promised\nher, if she would be reasonable and make no further fuss, that he\nwould take her to Switzerland next summer. So Clara gave in to\nthe inevitable, only stipulating that the box might be brought\ninto her room to be packed, so that she might add whatever she\nliked, and her father was only too pleased to let her provide a\nnice outfit for the child. Meanwhile Dete had arrived and was\nwaiting in the hall, wondering what extraordinary event had come\nto pass for her to be sent for at such an unusual hour. Herr\nSesemann informed her of the state Heidi was in, and that he\nwished her that very day to take her home. Dete was greatly\ndisappointed, for she had not expected such a piece of news. She\nremembered Uncle’s last words, that he never wished to set eyes\non her again, and it seemed to her that to take back the child to\nhim, after having left it with him once and then taken it away\nagain, was not a safe or wise thing for her to do. So she excused\nherself to Herr Sesemann with her usual flow of words; to-day and\nto-morrow it would be quite impossible for her to take the\njourney, and there was so much to do that she doubted if she\ncould get off on any of the following days. Herr Sesemann\nunderstood that she was unwilling to go at all, and so dismissed\nher. Then he sent for Sebastian and told him to make ready to\nstart: he was to travel with the child as far as Basle that day,\nand the next day take her home. He would give him a letter to\ncarry to the grandfather, which would explain everything, and he\nhimself could come back by return.",
        "“But there is one thing in particular which I wish you to look\nafter,” said Herr Sesemann in conclusion, “and be sure you\nattend to what I say. I know the people of this hotel in Basle,\nthe name of which I give you on this card. They will see to\nproviding rooms for the child and you. When there, go at once\ninto the child’s room and see that the windows are all firmly\nfastened so that they cannot be easily opened. After the child is\nin bed, lock the door of her room on the outside, for the child\nwalks in her sleep and might run into danger in a strange house\nif she went wandering downstairs and tried to open the front\ndoor; so you understand?”",
        "“Oh! then that was it?” exclaimed Sebastian, for now a light was\nthrown on the ghostly visitations.",
        "“Yes, that was it! and you are a coward, and you may tell John\nhe is the same, and the whole household a pack of idiots.” And\nwith this Herr Sesemann went off to his study to write a letter\nto Alm-Uncle. Sebastian remained standing, feeling rather\nfoolish.",
        "“If only I had not let that fool of a John drag me back into the\nroom, and had gone after the little white figure, which I should\ndo certainly if I saw it now!” he kept on saying to himself; but\njust now every corner of the room was clearly visible in the\ndaylight.",
        "Meanwhile Heidi was standing expectantly dressed in her Sunday\nfrock waiting to see what would happen next, for Tinette had\nonly woke her up with a shake and put on her clothes without a\nword of explanation. The little uneducated child was far too much\nbeneath her for Tinette to speak to.",
        "Herr Sesemann went back to the dining-room with the letter;\nbreakfast was now ready, and he asked, “Where is the child?”",
        "Heidi was fetched, and as she walked up to him to say “Good-\nmorning,” he looked inquiringly into her face and said, “Well,\nwhat do you say to this, little one?”",
        "Heidi looked at him in perplexity.",
        "“Why, you don’t know anything about it, I see,” laughed Herr\nSesemann. “You are going home today, going at once.”",
        "“Home,” murmured Heidi in a low voice, turning pale; she was so\novercome that for a moment or two she could hardly breathe.",
        "“Don’t you want to hear more about it?”",
        "“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Heidi, her face now rosy with delight.",
        "“All right, then,” said Herr Sesemann as he sat down and made\nher a sign to do the same, “but now make a good breakfast, and\nthen off you go in the carriage.”",
        "But Heidi could not swallow a morsel though she tried to do what\nshe was told; she was in such a state of excitement that she\nhardly knew if she was awake or dreaming, or if she would again\nopen her eyes to find herself in her nightgown at the front\ndoor.",
        "“Tell Sebastian to take plenty of provisions with him,” Herr\nSesemann called out to Fraulein Rottenmeier, who just then came\ninto the room; “the child can’t eat anything now, which is quite\nnatural. Now run up to Clara and stay with her till the carriage\ncomes round,” he added kindly, turning to Heidi.",
        "Heidi had been longing for this, and ran quickly upstairs. An\nimmense trunk was standing open in the middle of the room.",
        "“Come along, Heidi,” cried Clara, as she entered; “see all the\nthings I have had put in for you–aren’t you pleased?”",
        "And she ran over a list of things, dresses and aprons and\nhandkerchiefs, and all kinds of working materials. “And look\nhere,” she added, as she triumphantly held up a basket. Heidi\npeeped in and jumped for joy, for inside it were twelve\nbeautiful round white rolls, all for grandmother. In their\ndelight the children forgot that the time had come for them to\nseparate, and when some one called out, “The carriage is here,\"\nthere was no time for grieving.",
        "Heidi ran to her room to fetch her darling book; she knew no one\ncould have packed that, as it lay under her pillow, for Heidi\nhad kept it by her night and day. This was put in the basket with\nthe rolls. Then she opened her wardrobe to look for another\ntreasure, which perhaps no one would have thought of packing–and\nshe was right–the old red shawl had been left behind, Fraulein\nRottenmeier not considering it worth putting in with the other\nthings. Heidi wrapped it round something else which she laid on\nthe top of the basket, so that the red package was quite\nconspicuous. Then she put on her pretty hat and left the room.\nThe children could not spend much time over their farewells, for\nHerr Sesemann was waiting to put Heidi in the carriage. Fraulein\nRottenmeier was waiting at the top of the stairs to say good-bye\nto her. When she caught sight of the strange little red bundle,\nshe took it out of the basket and threw it on the ground. “No,\nno, Adelaide,” she exclaimed, “you cannot leave the house with\nthat thing. What can you possibly want with it!” And then she\nsaid good-bye to the child. Heidi did not dare take up her\nlittle bundle, but she gave the master of the house an imploring\nlook, as if her greatest treasure had been taken from her.",
        "“No, no,” said Herr Sesemann in a very decided voice, “the child\nshall take home with her whatever she likes, kittens and\ntortoises, if it pleases her; we need not put ourselves out\nabout that, Fraulein Rottenmeier.”",
        "Heidi quickly picked up her bundle, with a look of joy and\ngratitude. As she stood by the carriage door, Herr Sesemann gave\nher his hand and said he hoped she would remember him and Clara.\nHe wished her a happy journey, and Heidi thanked him for all his\nkindness, and added, “And please say good-bye to the doctor for\nme and give him many, many thanks.” For she had not forgotten\nthat he had said to her the night before, ’It will be all right\nto-morrow,’ and she rightly divined that he had helped to make\nit so for her. Heidi was now lifted into the carriage, and then\nthe basket and the provisions were put in, and finally Sebastian\ntook his place. Then Herr Sesemann called out once more, “A\npleasant journey to you,” and the carriage rolled away.",
        "Heidi was soon sitting in the railway carriage, holding her\nbasket tightly on her lap; she would not let it out of her hands\nfor a moment, for it contained the delicious rolls for\ngrandmother; so she must keep it carefully, and even peep inside\nit from time to time to enjoy the sight of them. For many hours\nshe sat as still as a mouse; only now was she beginning to\nrealize that she was going home to the grandfather, the\nmountain, the grandmother, and Peter, and pictures of all she was\ngoing to see again rose one by one before her eyes; she thought\nof how everything would look at home, but this brought other\nthoughts to her mind, and all of a sudden she said anxiously,\n“Sebastian, are you sure that grandmother on the mountain is not\ndead?”",
        "“No, no,” said Sebastian, wishing to soothe her, “we will hope\nnot; she is sure to be alive still.”",
        "Then Heidi fell back on her own thoughts again. Now and then she\nlooked inside the basket, for the thing she looked forward to\nmost was laying all the rolls out on grandmother’s table. After\na long silence she spoke again, “If only we could know for\ncertain that grandmother is alive!”",
        "“Yes, yes,” said Sebastian, half asleep; “she is sure to be\nalive, there is no reason why she should be dead.”",
        "After a while sleep fell on Heidi too, and after her disturbed\nnight and early rising she slept so soundly that she did not\nwake till Sebastian shook her by the arm and called to her, “Wake\nup, wake up! we shall have to get out directly; we are just in\nBasle!”",
        "There was a further railway journey of many hours the next day.\nHeidi again sat with her basket on her knee, for she would not\nhave given it up to Sebastian on any consideration; to-day she\nnever even opened her mouth, for her excitement, which increased\nwith every mile of the journey, kept her speechless. All of a\nsudden, before Heidi expected it, a voice called out,\n“Mayenfeld.” She and Sebastian both jumped up, the latter also\ntaken by surprise. In another minute they were both standing on\nthe platform with Heidi’s trunk, and the train was steaming away\ndown the valley. Sebastian looked after it regretfully, for he\npreferred the easier mode of travelling to a wearisome climb on\nfoot, especially as there was danger no doubt as well as fatigue\nin a country like this, where, according to Sebastian’s idea,\neverything and everybody were half savage. He therefore looked\ncautiously to either side to see who was a likely person to ask\nthe safest way to Dorfli.",
        "Just outside the station he saw a shabby-looking little cart and\nhorse which a broad-shouldered man was loading with heavy sacks\nthat had been brought by the train, so he went up to him and\nasked which was the safest way to get to Dorfli.",
        "“All the roads about here are safe,” was the curt reply.",
        "So Sebastian altered his question and asked which was the best\nway to avoid falling over the precipice, and also how a box\ncould be conveyed to Dorfli. The man looked at the box, weighing\nit with his eye, and then volunteered if it was not too heavy to\ntake it on his own cart, as he was driving to Dorfli. After some\nlittle interchange of words it was finally agreed that the man\nshould take both the child and the box to Dorfli, and there find\nsome one who could be sent on with Heidi up the mountain.",
        "“I can go by myself, I know the way well from Dorfli,” put in\nHeidi, who had been listening attentively to the conversation.\nSebastian was greatly relieved at not having to do any mountain\nclimbing. He drew Heidi aside and gave her a thick rolled\nparcel, and a letter for her grandfather; the parcel, he told\nher, was a present from Herr Sesemann, and she must put it at the\nbottom of her basket under the rolls and be very careful not to\nlose it, as Herr Sesemann would be very vexed if she did, and\nnever be the same to her again; so little miss was to think well\nof what he said.",
        "“I shall be sure not to lose it,” said Heidi confidently, and\nshe at once put the roll and the letter at the bottom of her\nbasket. The trunk meanwhile had been hoisted into the cart, and\nnow Sebastian lifted Heidi and her basket on to the high seat and\nshook hands with her; he then made signs to her to keep her eye\non the basket, for the driver was standing near and Sebastian\nthought it better to be careful, especially as he knew that he\nought himself to have seen the child safely to her journey’s\nend. The driver now swung himself up beside Heidi, and the cart\nrolled away in the direction of the mountains, while Sebastian,\nglad of having no tiring and dangerous journey on foot before\nhim, sat down in the station and awaited the return train.",
        "The driver of the car was the miller at Dorfli and was taking\nhome his sacks of flour. He had never seen Heidi, but like\neverybody in Dorfli knew all about her. He had known her\nparents, and felt sure at once that this was the child of whom he\nhad heard so much. He began to wonder why she had come back, and\nas they drove along he entered into conversation with her. “You\nare the child who lived with your grandfather, Alm-Uncle, are you\nnot?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Didn’t they treat you well down there that you have come back\nso soon?”",
        "“Yes, it was not that; everything in Frankfurt is as nice as it\ncould be.”",
        "“Then why are you running home again?”",
        "“Only because Herr Sesemann gave me leave, or else I should not\nhave come.”",
        "“If they were willing to let you stay, why did you not remain\nwhere you were better off than at home?”",
        "“Because I would a thousand times rather be with grandfather on\nthe mountain than anywhere else in the world.”",
        "“You will think differently perhaps when you get back there,\"\ngrumbled the miller; and then to himself, “It’s strange of her,\nfor she must know what it’s like.”",
        "He began whistling and said no more, while Heidi looked around\nher and began to tremble with excitement, for she knew every\ntree along the way, and there overhead were the high jagged peaks\nof the mountain looking down on her like old friends. And Heidi\nnodded back to them, and grew every moment more wild with her\njoy and longing, feeling as if she must jump down from the cart\nand run with all her might till she reached the top. But she sat\nquite still and did not move, although inwardly in such\nagitation. The clock was striking five as they drove into\nDorfli. A crowd of women and children immediately surrounded the\ncart, for the box and the child arriving with the miller had\nexcited the curiosity of everybody in the neighborhood,\ninquisitive to know whence they came and whither they were going\nand to whom they belonged. As the miller lifted Heidi down, she\nsaid hastily, “Thank you, grandfather will send for the trunk,\"\nand was just going to run off, when first one and then another of\nthe bystanders caught hold of her, each one having a different\nquestion to put to her. But Heidi pushed her way through them\nwith such an expression of distress on her face that they were\nforced to let her go. “You see,” they said to one another, “how\nfrightened she is, and no wonder,” and then they went on to talk\nof Alm-Uncle, how much worse he had grown that last year, never\nspeaking a word and looking as if he would like to kill\neverybody he met, and if the child had anywhere else to go to she\ncertainly would not run back to the old dragon’s den. But here\nthe miller interrupted them, saying he knew more about it than\nthey did, and began telling them how a kind gentleman had brought\nher to Mayenfeld and seen her off, and had given him his fare\nwithout any bargaining, and extra money for himself; what was\nmore, the child had assured him that she had had everything she\nwanted where she had been, and that it was her own wish to return\nto her grandfather. This information caused great surprise and\nwas soon repeated all over Dorfli, and that evening there was not\na house in the place in which the astounding news was not\ndiscussed, of how Heidi had of her own accord given up a\nluxurious home to return to her grandfather.",
        "Heidi climbed up the steep path from Dorfli as quickly as she\ncould; she was obliged, however, to pause now and again to take\nbreath, for the basket she carried was rather heavy, and the way\ngot steeper as she drew nearer the top. One thought alone filled\nHeidi’s mind, “Would she find the grandmother sitting in her\nusual corner by the spinning-wheel, was she still alive?” At\nlast Heidi caught sight of the grandmother’s house in the hollow\nof the mountain and her heart began to beat; she ran faster and\nfaster and her heart beat louder and louder–and now she had\nreached the house, but she trembled so she could hardly open the\ndoor–and then she was standing inside, unable in her\nbreathlessness to utter a sound.",
        "“Ah, my God!” cried a voice from the corner, “that was how Heidi\nused to run in; if only I could have her with me once again! Who\nis there?”",
        "“It’s I, I, grandmother,” cried Heidi as she ran and flung\nherself on her knees beside the old woman, and seizing her\nhands, clung to her, unable to speak for joy. And the grandmother\nherself could not say a word for some time, so unexpected was\nthis happiness; but at last she put out her hand and stroked\nHeidi’s curly hair, and said, “Yes, yes, that is her hair, and\nher voice; thank God that He has granted my prayer!” And tears\nof joy fell from the blind eyes on to Heidi’s hand. “Is it really\nyou, Heidi; have you really come back to me?”",
        "“Yes, grandmother, I am really here,” answered Heidi in a\nreassuring voice. “Do not cry, for I have really come back and I\nam never going away again, and I shall come every day to see\nyou, and you won’t have any more hard bread to eat for some days,\nfor look, look!”",
        "And Heidi took the rolls from the basket and piled the whole\ntwelve up on grandmother’s lap.",
        "“Ah, child! child! what a blessing you bring with you!” the old\nwoman exclaimed, as she felt and seemed never to come to the end\nof the rolls. “But you yourself are the greatest blessing,\nHeidi,” and again she touched the child’s hair and passed her\nhand over her hot cheeks, and said, “Say something, child, that\nI may hear your voice.”",
        "Then Heidi told her how unhappy she had been, thinking that the\ngrandmother might die while she was away and would never have\nher white rolls, and that then she would never, never see her\nagain.",
        "Peter’s mother now came in and stood for a moment overcome with\nastonishment. “Why, it’s Heidi,” she exclaimed, “and yet can it\nbe?”",
        "Heidi stood up, and Brigitta now could not say enough in her\nadmiration of the child’s dress and appearance; she walked round\nher, exclaiming all the while, “Grandmother, if you could only\nsee her, and see what a pretty frock she has on; you would\nhardly know her again. And the hat with the feather in it is\nyours too, I suppose? Put it on that I may see how you look in\nit?”",
        "“No, I would rather not,” replied Heidi firmly. “You can have it\nif you like; I do not want it; I have my own still.” And Heidi\nso saying undid her red bundle and took out her own old hat,\nwhich had become a little more battered still during the journey.\nBut this was no trouble to Heidi; she had not forgotten how her\ngrandfather had called out to Dete that he never wished to see\nher and her hat and feathers again, and this was the reason she\nhad so anxiously preserved her old hat, for she had never ceased\nto think about going home to her grandfather. But Brigitta told\nher not to be so foolish as to give it away; she would not think\nof taking such a beautiful hat; if Heidi did not want to wear it\nshe might sell it to the schoolmaster’s daughter in Dorfli and\nget a good deal of money for it. But Heidi stuck to her\nintention and hid the hat quietly in a corner behind the\ngrandmother’s chair. Then she took off her pretty dress and put\nher red shawl on over her under-petticoat, which left her arms\nbare; and now she clasped the old woman’s hand. “I must go home\nto grandfather,” she said, “but to-morrow I shall come again. Good-\nnight, grandmother.”",
        "“Yes, come again, be sure you come again tomorrow,” begged the\ngrandmother, as she pressed Heidi’s hands in hers, unwilling to\nlet her go.",
        "“Why have you taken off that pretty dress?” asked Brigitta.",
        "“Because I would rather go home to grandfather as I am or else\nperhaps he would not know me; you hardly did at first.”",
        "Brigitta went with her to the door, and there said in rather a\nmysterious voice, “You might have kept on your dress, he would\nhave known you all right; but you must be careful, for Peter\ntells me that Alm-Uncle is always now in a bad temper and never\nspeaks.”",
        "Heidi bid her good-night and continued her way up the mountain,\nher basket on her arm. All around her the steep green slopes\nshone bright in the evening sun, and soon the great gleaming snow-\nfield up above came in sight. Heidi was obliged to keep on\npausing to look behind her, for the higher peaks were behind her\nas she climbed. Suddenly a warm red glow fell on the grass at\nher feet; she looked back again–she had not remembered how\nsplendid it was, nor seen anything to compare to it in her dreams–\nfor there the two high mountain peeks rose into the air like two\ngreat flames, the whole snow-field had turned crimson, and rosy-\ncolored clouds floated in the sky above. The grass upon the\nmountain sides had turned to gold, the rocks were all aglow, and\nthe whole valley was bathed in golden mist. And as Heidi stood\ngazing around her at all this splendor the tears ran down her\ncheeks for very delight and happiness, and impulsively she put\nher hands together, and lifting her eyes to heaven, thanked God\naloud for having brought her home, thanked Him that everything\nwas as beautiful as ever, more beautiful even than she had\nthought, and that it was all hers again once more. And she was so\noverflowing with joy and thankfulness that she could not find\nwords to thank Him enough. Not until the glory began to fade\ncould she tear herself away. Then she ran on so quickly that in\na very little while she caught sight of the tops of the fir trees\nabove the hut roof, then the roof itself, and at last the whole\nhut, and there was grandfather sitting as in old days smoking\nhis pipe, and she could see the fir trees waving in the wind.\nQuicker and quicker went her little feet, and before Alm-Uncle\nhad time to see who was coming, Heidi had rushed up to him,\nthrown down her basket and flung her arms round his neck, unable\nin the excitement of seeing him again to say more than\n“Grandfather! grandfather! grandfather!” over and over again.",
        "And the old man himself said nothing. For the first time for\nmany years his eyes were wet, and he had to pass his hand across\nthem. Then he unloosed Heidi’s arms, put her on his knee, and\nafter looking at her for a moment, “So you have come back to me,\nHeidi,” he said, “how is that? You don’t look much of a grand\nlady. Did they send you away?”",
        "“Oh, no, grandfather,” said Heidi eagerly, “you must not think\nthat; they were all so kind–Clara, and grandmamma, and Herr\nSesemann. But you see, grandfather, I did not know how to bear\nmyself till I got home again to you. I used to think I should\ndie, for I felt as if I could not breathe; but I never said\nanything because it would have been ungrateful. And then\nsuddenly one morning quite early Herr Sesemann said to me–but I\nthink it was partly the doctor’s doing–but perhaps it’s all in\nthe letter–” and Heidi jumped down and fetched the roll and the\nletter and handed them both to her grandfather.",
        "“That belongs to you,” said the latter, laying the roll down on\nthe bench beside him. Then he opened the letter, read it through\nand without a word put it in his pocket.",
        "“Do you think you can still drink milk with me, Heidi?” he\nasked, taking the child by the hand to go into the hut. “But\nbring your money with you; you can buy a bed and bedclothes and\ndresses for a couple of years with it.”",
        "“I am sure I do not want it,” replied Heidi. “I have got a bed\nalready, and Clara has put such a lot of clothes in my box that\nI shall never want any more.”",
        "“Take it and put it in the cupboard; you will want it some day I\nhave no doubt.”",
        "Heidi obeyed and skipped happily after her grandfather into the\nhouse; she ran into all the corners, delighted to see everything\nagain, and then went up the ladder–but there she came to a\npause and called down in a tone of surprise and distress, “Oh,\ngrandfather, my bed’s gone.”",
        "“We can soon make it up again,” he answered her from below. “I\ndid not know that you were coming back; come along now and have\nyour milk.”",
        "Heidi came down, sat herself on her high stool in the old place,\nand then taking up her bowl drank her milk eagerly, as if she\nhad never come across anything so delicious, and as she put down\nher bowl, she exclaimed, “Our milk tastes nicer than anything\nelse in the world, grandfather.”",
        "A shrill whistle was heard outside. Heidi darted out like a\nflash of lightning. There were the goats leaping and springing\namong the rocks, with Peter in their midst. When he caught sight\nof Heidi he stood still with astonishment and gazed speechlessly\nat her. Heidi called out, “Good-evening, Peter,” and then ran in\namong the goats. “Little Swan! Little Bear! do you know me\nagain?” And the animals evidently recognized her voice at once,\nfor they began rubbing their heads against her and bleating\nloudly as if for joy, and as she called the other goats by name\none after the other, they all came scampering towards her helter-\nskelter and crowding round her. The impatient Greenfinch sprang\ninto the air and over two of her companions in order to get\nnearer, and even the shy little Snowflake butted the Great Turk\nout of her way in quite a determined manner, which left him\nstanding taken aback by her boldness, and lifting his beard in\nthe air as much as to say, You see who I am.",
        "Heidi was out of her mind with delight at being among all her\nold friends again; she flung her arms round the pretty little\nSnowflake, stroked the obstreperous Greenfinch, while she\nherself was thrust at from all sides by the affectionate and\nconfiding goats; and so at last she got near to where Peter was\nstill standing, not having yet got over his surprise.",
        "“Come down, Peter,” cried Heidi, “and say good-evening to me.”",
        "“So you are back again?” he found words to say at last, and now\nran down and took Heidi’s hand which she was holding out in\ngreeting, and immediately put the same question to her which he\nhad been in the habit of doing in the old days when they\nreturned home in the evening, “Will you come out with me again to-\nmorrow?”",
        "“Not to-morrow, but the day after perhaps, for to-morrow I must\ngo down to grandmother.”",
        "“I am glad you are back,” said Peter, while his whole face\nbeamed with pleasure, and then he prepared to go on with his\ngoats; but he never had had so much trouble with them before, for\nwhen at last, by coaxing and threats, he had got them all\ntogether, and Heidi had gone off with an arm over either head of\nher grandfather’s two, the whole flock suddenly turned and ran\nafter her. Heidi had to go inside the stall with her two and shut\nthe door, or Peter would never have got home that night. When\nHeidi went indoors after this she found her bed already made up\nfor her; the hay had been piled high for it and smelt\ndeliciously, for it had only just been got in, and the\ngrandfather had carefully spread and tucked in the clean sheets.\nIt was with a happy heart that Heidi lay down in it that night,\nand her sleep was sounder than it had been for a whole year past.\nThe grandfather got up at least ten times during the night and\nmounted the ladder to see if Heidi was all right and showing no\nsigns of restlessness, and to feel that the hay he had stuffed\ninto the round window was keeping the moon from shining too\nbrightly upon her. But Heidi did not stir; she had no need now\nto wander about, for the great burning longing of her heart was\nsatisfied; she had seen the high mountains and rocks alight in\nthe evening glow, she had heard the wind in the fir trees, she\nwas at home again on the mountain.",
