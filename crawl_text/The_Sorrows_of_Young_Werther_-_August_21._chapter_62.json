        "My sensations are constantly changing. Sometimes a happy prospect\nopens before me; but alas! it is only for a moment; and then, when\nI am lost in reverie, I cannot help saying to myself, “If Albert\nwere to die? — Yes, she would become — and I should be” — and\nso I pursue a chimera, till it leads me to the edge of a precipice\nat which I shudder.",
        "When I pass through the same gate, and walk along the same road\nwhich first conducted me to Charlotte, my heart sinks within me\nat the change that has since taken place. All, all, is altered!\nNo sentiment, no pulsation of my heart, is the same. My sensations\nare such as would occur to some departed prince whose spirit should\nreturn to visit the superb palace which he had built in happy times,\nadorned with costly magnificence, and left to a beloved son, but\nwhose glory he should find departed, and its halls deserted and\nin ruins.",
