        "The danger had now become so imminent that my husband determined to send\nhis family to Fort Howard, a point which was believed to be far out of\nthe range of the enemy. It was in vain that I pleaded to be permitted to\nremain; he was firm.",
        "“I must not leave my post,” said he, “while there is any danger. My\ndeparture would perhaps be the signal for an immediate alliance of the\nWinnebagoes with the Sauks. I am certain that as long as I am here my\npresence will act as a restraint upon them. You wish to remain and share\nmy dangers! Your doing so would expose us both to certain destruction in\ncase of attack By the aid of my friends in both tribes, I could hope to\npreserve my own life if I were alone; but surrounded by my family, that\nwould be impossible–we should all fall victims together. My duty\nplainly is, to send you to a place of safety.”",
        "An opportunity for doing this soon occurred. Paquette, the Interpreter,\nwho was likewise an agent of the American Fur Company, had occasion to\nsend a boat-load of furs to Green Bay, on their way to Mackinac. Mr.\nKinzie, having seen it as comfortably fitted up as an open boat of that\ndescription could be, with a tent-cloth fastened on a frame-work of\nhoop-poles over the centre and lined with a dark-green blanket, and\nhaving placed on board an abundant store of provisions and other\ncomforts, committed us to the joint care of my brother Arthur and our\nfaithful blacksmith, Mâtâ.",
        "This latter was a tall, gaunt Frenchman, with a freckled face, a\nprofusion of crisp, sandy hair, and an inveterate propensity to speak\nEnglish. His knowledge of the language was somewhat limited, and he\nburlesqued it by adding an s to almost every word, and giving out each\nphrase with a jerk.",
        "“Davids,” he was wont to say to the little yellow fiddler, after an\nevening’s frolic at the Interpreter’s, “Davids, clear away the tables\nand the glasses, and play fishes-hornspikes.”[55] He was a kind,\naffectionate creature, and his devotion to “Monsieur Johns” and “Madame\nJohns” knew no bounds.",
        "Besides these two protectors, three trusty Indians, the chief of whom\nwas called Old Smoker, were engaged to escort our party. The crew of\nthe boat consisted entirely of French engagés in the service of the Fur\nCompany. They were six gay-hearted, merry fellows, lightening their\nlabor with their pipe and their songs, in which latter they would have\nesteemed it a great compliment to be joined by the ladies who listened\nto them; but our hearts, alas! were now too heavy to participate in\ntheir enjoyment.",
        "The Fourth of July, the day on which we left our home, was a gloomy one\nindeed to those who departed and to the one left behind. Who knew if we\nshould ever meet again? The experience which some of the circle had had\nin Indian warfare was such as to justify the saddest forebodings. There\nwas not even the consolation of a certainty that this step would secure\nour safety. The Sauks might, possibly, be on the other side of us, and\nthe route we were taking might perhaps, though not probably, carry us\ninto their very midst. It was no wonder, then, that our leave-taking was\na solemn one–a parting which all felt might be for this world.",
        "Not all, however; for the gay, cheerful Frenchmen laughed and sang and\ncracked their jokes, and “assured Monsieur John that they would take\nMadame John and Madame Alum safe to the bay, spite of Sauks or wind or\nweather.”",
        "Thus we set out on our journey. For many miles the Fort was in sight, as\nthe course of the river alternately approached and receded from its\nwalls, and it was not until nearly mid-day that we caught the last\nglimpse of our home.",
        "At the noon-tide meal, or pipe, of the voyageurs, an alarming discovery\nwas made: no bread had been put on board for the crew! How this\noversight had occurred, no one could tell. One was certain that a large\nquantity had been brought from the garrison-bakery for their use that\nvery morning–another had even seen the sacks of loaves standing in\nPaquette’s kitchen. Be that as it may, there we were, many miles on our\njourney, and with no provisions for the six Frenchmen, except some\nsalted pork, a few beans, and some onions. A consultation was held in\nthis emergency. Should they return to the Portage for supplies? The\nsame danger that made their departure necessary, still existed, and the\nutmost dispatch had been enjoined upon them. We found upon examination\nthat the store of bread and crackers with which our party had been\nprovided was far-beyond what we could possibly require, and we thought\nit would be sufficient to allow of rations to the Frenchmen until we\nshould reach Powell’s, at the Butte des Morts, the day but one\nfollowing, where we should undoubtedly be able to procure a fresh\nsupply.",
        "This decided on, we proceeded on our journey, always in profound\nsilence, for a song or a loud laugh was now strictly prohibited until we\nshould have passed the utmost limits of country where the enemy might\npossibly be. We had been warned beforehand that a certain point, where\nthe low marshy meadows, through which the river had hitherto run, rises\ninto a more firm and elevated country, was the border of the Menomonee\nterritory, and the spot where the Sauks, if they had fled north of the\nWisconsin towards the Chippewa country, would be most likely to be\nencountered.",
        "As we received intimation on the forenoon of the second day that we were\ndrawing near this spot, I must confess that “we held our breath for\nawe.”",
        "The three Winnebagoes were in the bow of the boat. Old Smoker, the\nchief, squatted upon his feet on the bench of the foremost rowers. We\nlooked at him. He was gazing intently in the direction of the wooded\npoint we were approaching. Our eyes followed his, and we saw three\nIndians step forward and stand upon the bank. We said in a low voice to\neach other, “If they are Sauks, we are lost, for the whole body must be\nin that thicket.” The boat continued to approach; not a word was spoken;\nthe dip of the paddle, and perhaps the beating hearts of some, were the\nonly sounds that broke the stillness. Again we looked at the chief. His\nnostrils were dilated–his eyes almost glaring.",
        "Suddenly, with a bound, he sprang to his feet and uttered his long,\nshrill whoop.",
        "“Hoh! hoh! hoh! Neechee (friend) Muh-no-mo-nee!“",
        "All was now joy and gladness. Every one was forward to shake hands with\nthe strangers as soon as we could reach them, in token of our\nsatisfaction that they were Menomonees and not Sauks, of the latter of\nwhom, by the way, they could give us no intelligence.",
        "By noon of that day we considered ourselves to be out of the region of\ndanger. Still, caution was deemed necessary, and when at the mid-day\npipe the boat was pushed ashore under a beautiful overhanging bank,\ncrowned with a thick wood, the usual vigilance was somewhat relaxed, and\nthe young people, under the escort of Arthur and Mâtâ, were permitted to\nroam about a little, in the vicinity of the boat.",
        "They soon came back, with the report that the woods were “alive with\npigeons,\"–they could almost knock them down with sticks; and earnestly\ndid they plead to be allowed to shoot at least enough for supper. But\nno–the enemy might be nearer than we imagined–the firing of a gun\nwould betray our whereabouts–it was most prudent to give no notice to\nfriend or foe. So, very reluctantly, they were compelled to return to\nthe boat without their game.",
        "The next morning brought us to Powell’s, at the Butte des Morts. Sad\nwere the faces of the poor Frenchmen at learning that not a loaf of\nbread was to be had. Our own store, too, was by this time quite\nexhausted. The only substitute we could obtain was a bag of dark\nlooking, bitter flour. With this provision for our whole party, we were\nforced to be contented, and we left the Hillock of the Dead, feeling\nthat it had been indeed the grave of our hopes.",
        "By dint of good rowing, our crew soon brought us to the spot where the\nriver enters that beautiful sheet of water, Winnebago Lake. Though there\nwas but little wind when we reached the lake, the Frenchmen hoisted\ntheir sail, in hopes to save themselves the labor of rowing across; but\nin vain did they whistle, with all the force of their lungs–in vain did\nthey supplicate La Vierge, with a comical mixture of fun and\nreverence. As a last resource, it was at length suggested by some one\nthat their only chance lay in propitiating the goddess of the winds with\nan offering of some cast-off garment.",
        "Application was made all round by Guardapié, the chief spokesman of the\ncrew. Alas! not one of the poor voyageurs could boast a spare article. A\nfew old rags were at length rummaged out of the little receptacle of\nfood, clothing, and dirt in the bow of the boat, and cast into the waves\nFor a moment all flattered themselves that the experiment had been\nsuccessful–the sail fluttered, swelled a little, and then flapped idly\ndown against the mast. The party were in despair, until, after a\nwhispered consultation together, Julian and Edwin stepped forward as\nmessengers of mercy. In a trice they divested themselves of jacket and\nvest and made a proffer of their next garment to aid in raising the\nwind.",
        "At first there seemed a doubt in the minds of the boatmen whether they\nought to accept so magnificent an offer; but finding, on giving them a\npreparatory shake, that the value of the contribution was less than they\nhad imagined, they, with many shouts and much laughter, consigned them\nto the waves. To the great delight and astonishment of the boys, a\nbreeze at this moment sprang up, which carried the little vessel\nbeautifully over the waters for about half the distance to Garlic\nIsland. By this time the charm was exhausted, nor was it found possible\nto renew it by a repetition of similar offerings. All expedients were\ntried without success, and, with sundry rather disrespectful reflections\nupon the lady whose aid they had invoked, the Frenchmen were compelled\nto betake themselves to their oars, until they reached the island.",
        "Two or three canoes of Winnebagoes arrived at the same moment, and their\nowners immediately stepped forward with an offering of some sturgeon\nwhich they had caught in the lake. As this promised to be an agreeable\nvariety to the noon-tide meal (at least for the Frenchmen), it was\ndecided to stop and kindle a fire for the purpose of cooking it. We took\nadvantage of this interval to recommend to the boys a stroll to the\nopposite side of the island, where the clear, shallow water and pebbly\nbeach offered temptation to a refreshing bath. While they availed\nthemselves of this, under the supervision of Harry, the black boy, we\namused ourselves with gathering the fine red raspberries with which the\nisland abounded.",
        "Our enjoyment was cut short, however, by discovering that the whole\nplace, vines, shrubs, and even, apparently, the earth itself, was\ninfested with myriads of the wood-tick, a little insect, that, having\nfastened to the skin, penetrates into the very flesh, causing a swelling\nand irritation exceeding painful, and even dangerous. The alarm was\nsounded, to bring the boys back in all haste to the open and more\nfrequented part of the island. But we soon found we had not left our\ntormentors behind. Throughout the day we continued to be sensible of\ntheir proximity. From the effects of their attacks we were not relieved\nfor several succeeding days; those which had succeeded in burying\nthemselves in the flesh having to be removed with the point of a\npenknife or a large needle. After partaking of our dinner, we stepped on\nboard our boat, and, the wind having risen, we were carried by the\nbreeze to the farther verge of the lake, and into the entrance of the\nriver, or, as it was called, the Winnebago Rapids.",
        "On the point of land to the right stood a collection of neat bark\nwigwams–this was Four-Legs’ village.",
        "It was an exciting and somewhat hazardous passage down the rapids and\nover the Grand Chûte, a fall of several feet; but it was safely passed,\nand at the approach of evening the boat reached the settlement of the\nWaubanakees at the head of the Little Chûte. These are the Stockbridge\nor Brothertown Indians, the remains of the old Mohicans, who had, a few\nyears before, emigrated from Oneida County, in the State of New York, to\na tract granted them by the United States, on the fertile banks of the\nFox River. They had already cleared extensive openings in the forest,\nand built some substantial and comfortable houses near the banks of the\nriver, which were here quite high, and covered for the most part with\ngigantic trees.",
        "It was determined to ask hospitality of these people, to the extent of\nborrowing a corner of their fire to boil our tea-kettle, and bake the\nshort-cake which had been now, for nearly two days, our substitute for\nbread. Its manufacture had been a subject of much merriment. The\ningredients, consisting of Powell’s black flour, some salt, and a little\nbutter, were mixed in the tin box which had held our meat. This was then\nreversed, and, having been properly cleansed, supplied the place of a\ndough-board. The vinegar-bottle served the office of rolling-pin, and a\nshallow tin dish formed the appliance for baking. The Waubanakees were\nso good as to lend us an iron bake-kettle, and superintend the cooking\nof our cake after Harry had carried it up to their dwelling.",
        "So kind and hospitable did they show themselves, that the crew of the\nboat took the resolution of asking a lodging on shore, by way of relief\nafter their crowded quarters in the boat for the last three nights.\nArthur and Mâtâ soon adopted the same idea, and we were invited to\nfollow their example, with the assurance that the houses were extremely\nneat and orderly.",
        "We preferred, however, as it was a fine night, and all things were so\ncomfortably arranged in the boat, to remain on board, keeping Edwin and\nJosette with us.",
        "The boat was tightly moored, for the little Chûte was just below, and if\nour craft should break loose in the rapid current, and drift down over\nthe falls, it would be a very serious matter. As an additional\nprecaution, one man was left on board to keep all things safe and in\norder, and, these arrangements having been made, the others ascended the\nbank, and took up their night’s lodgings in the Waubanakee cabins.",
        "It was a beautiful, calm, moonlight night, the air just sufficiently\nwarm to be agreeable, while the gentle murmur of the rapids and of the\nfall, at no great distance, soon lulled our party to repose. How long we\nhad slumbered we knew not, when we were aroused by a rushing wind. It\nbent the poles supporting the awning, snapped them, and, another gust\nsucceeding, tent and blanket were carried away on the blast down the\nstream. The moonlight was gone, but a flash of lightning showed them\nsailing away like a spectre in the distance.",
        "The storm increased in violence. The rain began to pour in torrents, and\nthe thunder and lightning to succeed each other in fearful rapidity. My\nsister sprang to waken the Frenchman. “Get up, Vitelle, quick,” cried\nshe, in French, “run up the bank for Mâtâ and Mr. Arthur–tell them to\ncome and get us instantly.”",
        "The man made her no reply, but fell upon his knees, invoking the Virgin\nmost vociferously.",
        "“Do not wait for the Virgin, but go as quickly as possible. Do you not\nsee we shall all be killed?”",
        "“Oh! not for the world, madame, not for the world,” said Vitelle,\nburying his head in a pack of furs, “would I go up that bank in this\nstorm.” And here he began crying most lustily to all the saints in the\ncalendar.",
        "It Was indeed awful. The roaring of the thunder and the flashing of the\nlightning around us were like the continued discharge of a park of\nartillery. I with some difficulty drew forth my cloak, and enveloped\nmyself and Josette–sister Margaret did the same with Edwin.",
        "“Oh I madame,” said the poor little girl, her teeth chattering with cold\nand fright, “won’t we be drowned?”",
        "“Very well,” said my sister to the Frenchman, “you see that Madame John\nis at the last agony–if you will not go for help I must, and Monsieur\nJohn must know that you left his wife to perish.”",
        "This was too much for Vitelle. “If I must, I must,” said he, and with a\ndesperate bound he leaped on shore and sped up the hill with might and\nmain.",
        "In a few minutes, though it seemed ages to us, a whole posse came flying\ndown the hill. The incessant lightning made all things appear as in the\nglare of day. Mâtâ’s curly hair fairly stood on end, and his eyes rolled\nwith ghastly astonishment at the spectacle.",
        "“Oh, my God, Madame Johns! what would Monsieur Johns say, to see you\nnows?” exclaimed he, as he seized me in his arms and bore me up the\nhill. Arthur followed with sister Margaret, and two others with Edwin\nand Josette. Nobody carried Vitelle, for he had taken care not to risk\nhis precious life by venturing again to the boat.",
        "On arriving at the cabin where Arthur and Mâtâ had been lodged, a fire\nwas, with some difficulty, kindled, and our trunks having been brought\nup from the boat, we were at length able to exchange our drenched\ngarments, and those of the children, for others more comfortable, after\nwhich we laid ourselves upon the clean but homely bed, and slept until\ndaylight.",
        "As it was necessary to ascertain what degree of damage the cargo of furs\nhad sustained, an early start was proposed. Apparently, the inhabitants\nof the cottages had become weary in well-doing, for they declined\npreparing breakfast for us, although we assured them they should be well\ncompensated for their trouble. We, consequently, saw ourselves compelled\nto depart with very slender prospects of a morning meal.",
        "When we reached the boat, what a scene presented itself! Bedclothes,\ncloaks, trunks, mess-basket, packs of furs, all bearing the marks of a\ncomplete deluge! The boat ankle-deep in water–literally no place on\nboard where we could either stand or sit. After some bailing out, and an\nattempt at disposing some of the packs of furs which had suffered least\nfrom the flood, so as to form a sort of divan in the centre of the boat,\nnothing better seemed to offer than to re-embark, and endure what could\nnot be cured.",
        "Our position was not an enviable one. Wherever a foot or hand was\nplaced, the water gushed up, with a bubbling sound, and, oh! the state\nof the bandboxes and work-baskets! Breakfast there was none, for on\nexamining the mess-basket everything it contained was found mingled in\none undistinguishable mass. Tea, pepper, salt, short-cake, all floating\ntogether–it was a hopeless case.",
        "But this was not the worst. As the fervid July sun rose higher in the\nheavens, the steam which exhaled from every object on board was nearly\nsuffocating. The boat was old–the packs of skins were old–their\nvicinity in a dry day had been anything but agreeable–now it was\nintolerable. There was no retreating from it, however; so we encouraged\nthe children to arm themselves with patience, for the short time that\nyet remained of our voyage.",
        "Seated on our odoriferous couch, beneath the shade of a single umbrella,\nto protect our whole party from the scorching sun, we glided wearily\ndown the stream, through that long, tedious day. As we passed\nsuccessively the Kakalin, the Rapids, Dickenson’s, the Agency, with what\nlonging eyes did we gaze at human habitations, where others were\nenjoying the shelter of a roof and the comforts of food–and how eagerly\ndid we count the hours which must elapse before we could reach Port\nHoward!",
        "There were no songs from the poor Frenchmen this day. Music and fasting\ndo not go well together. At length we stopped at Shanty-town, where the\nboat was to be unloaded. All hands fell to work to transfer the cargo to\nthe warehouse of the Fur Company, which stood near the landing. It was\nnot a long operation, for all worked heartily. This being accomplished,\nthe voyageurs, one and all, prepared to take their leave. In vain Mâtâ\nstormed and raved–in vain Arthur remonstrated.",
        "“No,” they said, “they had brought the boat and cargo to the\nwarehouse–that was all of their job.” And they turned to go.",
        "“Guardapié,” said I, “do you intend to leave us here?”",
        "“Bien, madame! it is the place we always stop at.”",
        "“Does Monsieur John pay you for bringing his family down?”",
        "“Oh, yes, Monsieur John has given us an order on the sutler, at the\nFort down below.”",
        "“To be paid when you deliver us safe at the Fort down below. It seems I\nshall be there before you, and I shall arrange that matter. Monsieur\nJohn never dreamed that this would be your conduct.”",
        "The Frenchmen consulted together, and the result was that Guardapié with\ntwo others jumped into the boat, took their oars, and rather sulkily\nrowed us the remaining two miles to Fort Howard.",
