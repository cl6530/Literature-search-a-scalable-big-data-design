        "“The hospital in Sauveterre,” says the guide book, “is, in spite of\nits limited size, one of the best institutions of the kind in the\ndepartment. The chapel and the new additions were built at the expense\nof the Countess de Maupaison, the widow of one of the ministers of\nLouis Philippe.”",
        "But what the guide book does not say is, that the hospital was endowed\nwith three free beds for pregnant women, by Mrs. Seneschal, or that\nthe two wings on both sides of the great entrance-gate have also been\nbuilt by her liberality. One of these wings, the one on the right, is\nused by the janitor, a fine-looking old man, who formerly was beadle\nat the cathedral, and who loves to think of the happy days when he\nadded to the splendor of the church by his magnificent presence, his\nred uniform, his gold bandelaire, his halbert, and his gold-headed\ncane.",
        "This janitor was, on Sunday morning, a little before eight o’clock,\nsmoking his pipe in the yard, when he saw Dr. Seignebos coming in. The\ndoctor was walking faster than usual, his hat over his face, and his\nhands thrust deep into his pockets, evident signs of a storm. Instead\nof coming, as he did every day before making the rounds, into the\noffice of the sister-druggist, he went straight up to the room of the\nlady superior. There, after the usual salutations, he said,–",
        "“They have no doubt brought you, my sister, last night, a patient, an\nidiot, called Cocoleu?”",
        "“Yes, doctor.”",
        "“Where has he been put?”",
        "“The mayor saw him himself put into the little room opposite the linen\nroom.”",
        "“And how did he behave?”",
        "“Perfectly well: the sister who kept the watch did not hear him stir.”",
        "“Thanks, my sister!” said Dr. Seignebos.",
        "He was already in the door, when the lady superior recalled him.",
        "“Are you going to see the poor man, doctor?” she asked.",
        "“Yes, my sister; why?”",
        "“Because you cannot see him.”",
        "“I cannot?”",
        "“No. The commonwealth attorney has sent us orders not to let any one,\nexcept the sister who nurses him, come near Cocoleu,–no one, doctor,\nnot even the physician, a case of urgency, of course, excepted.”",
        "Dr. Seignebos smiled ironically. Then he said, laughing scornfully,–",
        "“Ah, these are your orders, are they? Well, I tell you that I do not\nmind them in the least. Who can prevent me from seeing my patient?\nTell me that! Let the commonwealth attorney give his orders in his\ncourt-house as much as he chooses: that is all right. But in my\nhospital! My sister, I am going to Cocoleu’s room.”",
        "“Doctor, you cannot go there. There is a gendarme at the door.”",
        "“A gendarme?”",
        "“Yes, he came this morning with the strictest orders.”",
        "For a moment the doctor was overcome. Then he suddenly broke out with\nunusual violence, and a voice that made the windows shake,–",
        "“This is unheard of! This is an abominable abuse of power! I’ll have\nmy rights, and justice shall be done me, if I have to go to Thiers!”",
        "Then he rushed out without ceremony, crossed the yard, and disappeared\nlike an arrow, in the direction of the court-house. At that very\nmoment M. Daubigeon was getting up, feeling badly because he had had a\nbad, sleepless night, thanks to this unfortunate affair of M. de\nBoiscoran, which troubled him sorely; for he was almost of M. Galpin’s\nopinion. In vain he recalled Jacques’s noble character, his well-known\nuprightness, his keen sense of honor, the evidence was so strong, so\noverwhelming! He wanted to doubt; but experience told him that a man’s\npast is no guarantee for his future. And, besides, like many great\ncriminal lawyers, he thought, what he would never have ventured to say\nopenly, that some great criminals act while they are under the\ninfluence of a kind of vertigo, and that this explains the stupidity\nof certain crimes committed by men of superior intelligence.",
        "Since his return from Boiscoran, he had kept close in his house; and\nhe had just made up his mind not to leave the house that day, when\nsome one rang his bell furiously. A moment later Dr. Seignebos fell\ninto the room like a bombshell.",
        "“I know what brings you, doctor,” said M. Daubigeon. “You come about\nthat order I have given concerning Cocoleu.”",
        "“Yes, indeed, sir! That order is an insult.”",
        "“I have been asked to give it as a matter of necessity, by M. Galpin.”",
        "“And why did you not refuse? You alone are responsible for it in my\neyes. You are commonwealth attorney, consequently the head of the bar,\nand superior to M. Galpin.”",
        "M. Daubigeon shook his head and said,–",
        "“There you are mistaken, doctor. The magistrate in such a case is\nindependent of myself and of the court. He is not even bound to obey\nthe attorney-general, who can make suggestions to him, but cannot give\nhim orders. M. Galpin, in his capacity as examining magistrate, has\nhis independent jurisdiction, and is armed with almost unlimited\npower. No one in the world can say so well as an examining magistrate\nwhat the poet calls,–",
        " ’Such is my will, such are my orders, and my will is sufficient.’\n ’Hoc volo, hoc jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas.’ “",
        "For once Dr. Seignebos seemed to be convinced by M. Daubigeon’s words.\nHe said,–",
        "“Then, M. Galpin has even the right to deprive a sick man of his\nphysician’s assistance.”",
        "“If he assumes the responsibility, yes. But he does not mean to go so\nfar. He was, on the contrary, about to ask you, although it is Sunday,\nto come and be present at a second examination of Cocoleu. I am\nsurprised that you have not received his note, and that you did not\nmeet him at the hospital.”",
        "“Well, I am going at once.”",
        "And he went back hurriedly, and was glad he had done so; for at the\ndoor of the hospital he came face to face against M. Galpin, who was\njust coming in, accompanied by his faithful clerk, Mechinet.",
        "“You came just in time, doctor,” began the magistrate, with his usual\nsolemnity.",
        "But, short and rapid as the doctor’s walk had been, it had given him\ntime to reflect, and to grow cool. Instead of breaking out into\nrecriminations, he replied in a tone of mock politeness,–",
        "“Yes, I know. It is that poor devil to whom you have given a gendarme\nfor a nurse. Let us go up: I am at your service.”",
        "The room in which Cocoleu had been put was large, whitewashed, and\nempty, except that a bed, a table and two chairs, stood about. The bed\nwas no doubt a good one; but the idiot had taken off the mattress and\nthe blankets, and lain down in his clothes on the straw bed. Thus the\nmagistrate and the physician found him as they entered. He rose at\ntheir appearance; but, when he saw the gendarme, he uttered a cry, and\ntried to hide under the bed. M. Galpin ordered the gendarme to pull\nhim out again. Then he walked up to him, and said,–",
        "“Don’t be afraid, Cocoleu. We want to do you no harm; only you must\nanswer our questions. Do you recollect what happened the other night\nat Valpinson?”",
        "Cocoleu laughed,–the laugh of an idiot,–but he made no reply. And\nthen, for a whole hour, begging, threatening, and promising by turns,\nthe magistrate tried in vain to obtain one word from him. Not even the\nname of the Countess Claudieuse had the slightest effect. At last,\nutterly out of patience, he said,–",
        "“Let us go. The wretch is worse than a brute.”",
        "“Was he any better,” asked the doctor, “when he denounced M. de\nBoiscoran?”",
        "But the magistrate pretended not to hear; and, when they were about to\nleave the room, he said to the doctor,–",
        "“You know that I expect your report, doctor?”",
        "“In forty-eight hours I shall have the honor to hand it to you,\"\nreplied the latter.",
        "But as he went off, he said half aloud,–",
        "“And that report is going to give you some trouble, my good man.”",
        "The report was ready then, and his reason for not giving it in, was\nthat he thought, the longer he could delay it, the more chance he\nwould probably have to defeat the plan of the prosecution.",
        "“As I mean to keep it two days longer,” he thought on his way home,\n“why should I not show it to this Paris lawyer who has dome down with\nthe marchioness? Nothing can prevent me, as far as I see, since that\npoor Galpin, in his utter confusion, has forgotten to put me under\noath.”",
        "But he paused. According to the laws of medical jurisprudence, had he\nthe right, or not, to communicate a paper belonging to the case to the\ncounsel of the accused? This question troubled him; for, although he\nboasted that he did not believe in God, he believed firmly in\nprofessional duty, and would have allowed himself to be cut in pieces\nrather than break its laws.",
        "“But I have clearly the right to do so,” he growled. “I can only be\nbound by my oath. The authorities are clear on that subject. I have in\nmy favor the decisions of the Court of Appeals of 27 November, and 27\nDecember, 1828; those of the 13th June, 1835; of the 3d May, 1844; of\nthe 26th June, 1866.”",
        "The result of this mediation was, that, as soon as he had breakfasted,\nhe put his report in his pocket, and went by side streets to M. de\nChandore’s house. The marchioness and the two aunts were still at\nchurch, where they had thought it best to show themselves; and there\nwas no one in the sitting-room but Dionysia, the old baron, and M.\nFolgat. The old gentleman was very much surprised to see the doctor.\nThe latter was his family physician, it is true; but, except in cases\nof sickness, the two never saw each other, their political opinions\nwere so very different.",
        "“If you see me here,” said the physician, still in the door, “it is\nsimply because, upon my honor and my conscience, I believe M.\nBoiscoran is innocent.”",
        "Dionysia would have liked to embrace the doctor for these words of\nhis; and with the greatest eagerness she pushed a large easy-chair\ntowards him, and said in her sweetest voice,–",
        "“Pray sit down, my dear doctor.”",
        "“Thanks,” he answered bruskly. “I am very much obliged to you.” Then\nturning to M. Folgat, he said, according to his odd notion,–",
        "“I am convinced that M. Boiscoran is the victim of his republican\nopinions which he has so boldly professed; for, baron, your future\nson-in-law is a republican.”",
        "Grandpapa Chandore did not move. If they had come and told him Jacques\nhad been a member of the Commune, he would not have been any more\nmoved. Dionysia loved Jacques. That was enough for him.",
        "“Well,” the doctor went on, “I am a Radical, I, M.\"–",
        "“Folgat,” supplied the young lawyer.",
        "“Yes, M. Folgat, I am a Radical; and it is my duty to defend a man\nwhose political opinions so closely resemble mine. I come, therefore,\nto show you my medical report, if you can make any use of it in your\ndefence of M. Boiscoran, or suggest to me any ideas.”",
        "“Ah!” exclaimed the young man. “That is a very valuable service.”",
        "“But let us understand each other,” said the physician earnestly. “If\nI speak of listening to your suggestions, I take it for granted that\nthey are based upon facts. If I had a son, and he was to die on the\nscaffold I would not use the slightest falsehood to save him.”",
        "He had, meanwhile, drawn the report from a pocket in his long coat,\nand now put in on the table with these words,–",
        "“I shall call for it again to-morrow morning. In the meantime you can\nthink it over. I should like, however, to point out to you the main\npoint, the culminating point, if I may say so.”",
        "At all events he was “saying so” with much hesitation, and looking\nfixedly at Dionysia as if to make her understand that he would like\nher to leave the room. Seeing that she did not take the hint, he\nadded,–",
        "“A medical and legal discussion would hardly interest the young lady.”",
        "“Why, sir, why, should I not be deeply, passionately, interested in\nany thing that regards the man who is to be my husband?”",
        "“Because ladies are generally very sensational,” said the doctor\nuncivilly, “very sensitive.”",
        "“Don’t think so, doctor. For Jacques’s sake, I promise you I will show\nyou quite masculine energy.”",
        "The doctor knew Dionysia well enough to see that she did not mean to\ngo: so he growled,–",
        "“As you like it.”",
        "Then, turning again to M. Folgat, he said,–",
        "“You know there were two shots fired at Count Claudieuse. One, which\nhit him in the side, nearly missed him; the other, which struck his\nshoulder and his neck, hit well.”",
        "“I know,” said the advocate.",
        "“The difference in the effect shows that the two shots were fired from\ndifferent distances, the second much nearer than the first.”",
        "“I know, I know!”",
        "“Excuse me. If I refer to these details, it is because they are\nimportant. When I was sent for in the middle of the night to come and\nsee Count Claudieuse, I at once set to work extracting the particles\nof lead that had lodged in his flesh. While I was thus busy, M. Galpin\narrived. I expected he would ask me to show him the shot: but no, he\ndid not think of it; he was too full of his own ideas. He thought only\nof the culprit, of /his/ culprit. I did not recall to him the A B C of\nhis profession: that was none of my business. The physician has to\nobey the directions of justice, but not to anticipate them.”",
        "“Well, then?”",
        "“Then M. Galpin went off to Boiscoran, and I completed my work. I have\nextracted fifty-seven shot from the count’s wound in the side, and a\nhundred and nine from the wound on the shoulder and the neck; and,\nwhen I had done that, do you know what I found out?”",
        "He paused, waiting to see the effect of his words; and, when\neverybody’s attention seemed to him fully roused, he went on,–",
        "“I found out that the shot in the two wounds was not alike.”",
        "M. de Chandore and M. Folgat exclaimed at one time,–",
        "“Oh!”",
        "“The shot that was first fired,” continued Dr. Seignebos, “and which\nhas touched the side, is the very smallest sized ’dust.’ That in the\nshoulder, on the other hand, is quite large sized, such as I think is\nused in shooting hares. However, I have some samples.”",
        "And with these words, he opened a piece of white paper, in which were\nten or twelve pieces of lead, stained with coagulated blood, and\nshowing at once a considerable difference in size. M. Folgat looked\npuzzled.",
        "“Could there have been two murderers?” he asked half aloud.",
        "“I rather think,” said M. de Chandore, “that the murderer had, like\nmany sportsmen, one barrel ready for birds, and another for hares or\nrabbits.”",
        "“At all events, this fact puts all premeditation out of question. A\nman does not load his gun with small-shot in order to commit murder.”",
        "Dr. Seignebos thought he had said enough about it, and was rising to\ntake leave, when M. de Chandore asked him how Count Claudieuse was\ndoing.",
        "“He is not doing well,” replied the doctor. “The removal, in spite of\nall possible precautions, has worn him out completely; for he is here\nin Sauveterre since yesterday, in a house which M. Seneschal has\nrented for him provisionally. He has been delirious all night through;\nand, when I came to see him this morning, I do not think he knew me.”",
        "“And the countess?” asked Dionysia.",
        "“The countess, madam, is quite as sick as her husband, and, if she had\nlistened to me, she would have gone to bed, too. But she is a woman of\nuncommon energy, who derives from her affection for her husband an\nalmost incomprehensible power of resistance. As to Cocoleu,” he added,\nstanding already near the door, “an examination of his mental\ncondition might produce results which no one seems to expect now. But\nwe will talk of that hereafter. And now, I must bid you all good-by.”",
        "“Well?” asked Dionysia and M. de Chandore, as soon as they had heard\nthe street door close behind Dr. Seignebos.",
        "But M. Folgat’s enthusiasm had cooled off very rapidly.",
        "“Before giving an opinion,” he said cautiously, “I must study the\nreport of this estimable doctor.”",
        "Unfortunately, the report contained nothing that the doctor had not\nmentioned. In vain did the young advocate try all the afternoon to\nfind something in it that might be useful for the defence. There were\narguments in it, to be sure, which might be very valuable when the\ntrial should come on, but nothing that could be used to make the\nprosecution give up the case.",
        "The whole house was, therefore, cruelly disappointed and dejected,\nwhen, about five o’clock, old Anthony came in from Boiscoran. He\nlooked very sad, and said,–",
        "“I have been relieved of my duties. At two o’clock M. Galpin came to\ntake off the seals. He was accompanied by his clerk Mechinet, and\nbrought Master Jacques with him, who was guarded by two gendarmes in\ncitizen’s clothes. When the room was opened, that unlucky man Galpin\nasked Master Jacques if those were the clothes which he wore the night\nof the fire, his boots, his gun, and the water in which he washed his\nhands. When he had acknowledged every thing, the water was carefully\npoured into a bottle, which they sealed, and handed to one of the\ngendarmes. Then they put master’s clothes in a large trunk, his gun,\nseveral parcels of cartridge, and some other articles, which the\nmagistrate said were needed for the trial. That trunk was sealed like\nthe bottle, and put on the carriage; then that man Galpin went off,\nand told me that I was free.”",
        "“And Jacques,” Dionysia asked eagerly,–\"how did he look?”",
        "“Master, madam, laughed contemptuously.”",
        "“Did you speak to him?” asked M. Folgat.",
        "“Oh, no, sir! M. Galpin would not allow me.”",
        "“And did you have time to look at the gun?”",
        "“I could but just glance at the lock.”",
        "“And what did you see?”",
        "The brow of the old servant grew still darker, as he replied sadly,–",
        "“I saw that I had done well to keep silent. The lock is black. Master\nmust have used his gun since I cleaned it.”",
        "Grandpapa Chandore and M. Folgat exchanged looks of distress. One more\nhope was lost.",
        "“Now,” said the young lawyer, “tell me how M. de Boiscoran usually\ncharged his gun.”",
        "“He used cartridges, sir, of course. They sent him, I think, two\nthousand with the gun,–some for balls, some with large shot, and\nothers with shot of every size. At this season, when hunting is\nprohibited, master could shoot nothing but rabbits, or those little\nbirds, you know, which come to our marshes: so he always loaded one\nbarrel with tolerably large shot, and the other with small-shot.”",
        "But he stopped suddenly, shocked at the impression which his statement\nseemed to produce. Dionysia cried,–",
        "“That is terrible! Every thing is against us!”",
        "M. Folgat did not give her time to say any more. He asked,–",
        "“My dear Anthony, did M. Galpin take all of your master’s cartridges\naway with him?”",
        "“Oh, no! certainly not.”",
        "“Well, you must instantly go back to Boiscoran, and bring me three or\nfour cartridges of every number of shot.”",
        "“All right,” said the old man. “I’ll be back in a short time.”",
        "He started immediately; and, thanks to his great promptness, he\nreappeared at seven o’clock, at the moment when the family got up from\ndinner, and put a large package of cartridges on the table.",
        "M. de Chandore and M. Folgat had quickly opened some of them; and,\nafter a few failures, they found two numbers of shot which seemed to\ncorrespond exactly to the samples left them by the doctor.",
        "“There is an incomprehensible fatality in all this,” said the old\ngentleman in an undertone.",
        "The young lawyer, also, looked discouraged.",
        "“It is madness,” he said, “to try to establish M. de Boiscoran’s\ninnocence without having first communicated with him.”",
        "“And if you could do so to-morrow?” asked Dionysia.",
        "“Then, madam, he might give us the key to this mystery, which we are\nin vain trying to solve; or, at least, he might tell us the way to\nfind it all out. But that is not to be thought of. M. de Boiscoran is\nheld in close confinement, and you may rest assured M. Galpin will see\nto it that no communication is held with his prisoner.”",
        "“Who knows?” said the young girl.",
        "And immediately she drew M. de Chandore aside into one of the little\ncard-rooms adjoining the parlor, and asked him,–",
        "“Grandpapa, am I rich?”",
        "Never in her life had she thought of that, and she was to a certain\nextent utterly ignorant of the value of money.",
        "“Yes, you are rich, my child,” replied the old gentleman.",
        "“How much do I have?”",
        "“You have in your own right, as coming to you from your poor father\nand from your mother, twenty-five thousand francs a year, or a capital\nof about five hundred and fifty thousand francs.”",
        "“And is that a good deal?”",
        "“It is so much, that you are one of the richest heiresses of the\ndistrict; but you have, besides, considerable expectations.”",
        "Dionysia was so preoccupied, that she did not even protest. She went\non asking,–",
        "“What do they call here to be well off?”",
        "“That depends, my child. If you will tell me\"–",
        "She interrupted him, putting down her foot impatiently, saying,–",
        "“Nothing. Please answer me!”",
        "“Well, in our little town, an income of eight hundred or a thousand\nfrancs makes anybody very well off.”",
        "“Let us say a thousand.”",
        "“Well, a thousand would make a man very comfortable.”",
        "“And what capital would produce such an income?”",
        "“At five per cent, it would take twenty thousand francs.”",
        "“That is to say, about the income of a year.”",
        "“Exactly.”",
        "“Never mind. I presume that is quite a large sum, and it would be\nrather difficult for you, grandpapa, to get it together by to-morrow\nmorning?”",
        "“Not at all. I have that much in railway coupon-bonds; and they are\njust as good as current money.”",
        "“Ah! Do you mean to say, that, if I gave anybody twenty thousand\nfrancs in such bonds, it would be just the same to him as if I gave\nhim twenty thousand francs in bank-notes?”",
        "“Just so.”",
        "Dionysia smiled. She thought she saw light. Then she went on,–",
        "“If that is so, I must beg you, grandpapa, to give me twenty thousand\nfrancs in coupon-bonds.”",
        "The old gentleman started.",
        "“You are joking,” he said. “What do you want with so much money? You\nare surely joking.”",
        "“Not at all. I have never in my life been more serious,” replied the\nyoung girl in a tone of voice which could not be mistaken. “I beseech\nyou, grandpapa, if you love me, give me these twenty thousand francs\nthis evening, right now. You hesitate? O God! You may kill me if you\nrefuse.”",
        "No, M. de Chandore was hesitating no longer.",
        "“Since you will have it so,” he said, “I am going up stairs to get\nit.”",
        "She clapped her hands with joy.",
        "“That’s it,” she said. “Make haste and dress; for I have to go out,\nand you must go with me.”",
        "Then going up to her aunts and the marchioness, she said to them,–",
        "“I hope you will excuse me, if I leave you; but I must go out.”",
        "“At this hour?” cried Aunt Elizabeth. “Where are you going?”",
        "“To my dressmakers, the Misses Mechinet. I want a dress.”",
        "“Great God!” cried Aunt Adelaide, “the child is losing her mind!”",
        "“I assure you I am not, aunt.”",
        "“Then let me go with you.”",
        "“Thank you, no. I shall go alone; that is to say, alone with dear\ngrandpapa.”",
        "And as M. de Chandore came back, his pockets full of bonds, his hat on\nhis head, and his cane in his hand, she carried him off, saying,–",
        "“Come, quick, dear grandpapa, we are in a great hurry.”",
        "Continue...",
