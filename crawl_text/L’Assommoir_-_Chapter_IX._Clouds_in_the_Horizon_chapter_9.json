        "That winter Mamma Coupeau was very ill with an asthmatic attack,\nwhich she always expected in the month of December.",
        "The poor woman suffered much, and the depression of her spirits was\nnaturally very great. It must be confessed that there was nothing very\ngay in the aspect of the room where she slept. Between her bed and\nthat of the little girl there was just room for a chair. The paper\nhung in strips from the wall. Through a round window near the ceiling\ncame a dreary gray light. There was little ventilation in the room,\nwhich made it especially unfit for the old woman, who at night, when\nNana was there and she could hear her breathe, did not complain, but\nwhen left alone during the day, moaned incessantly, rolling her head\nabout on her pillow.",
        "“Ah,” she said, “how unhappy I am! It is the same as a prison. I wish\nI were dead!”",
        "And as soon as a visitor came in–Virginie or Mme Boche–she poured\nout her grievances. “I should not suffer so much among strangers.\nI should like sometimes a cup of tisane, but I can’t get it; and\nNana–that child whom I have raised from the cradle–disappears in the\nmorning and never shows her face until night, when she sleeps right\nthrough and never once asks me how I am or if she can do anything for\nme. It will soon be over, and I really believe this clearstarcher\nwould smother me herself–if she were not afraid of the law!”",
        "Gervaise, it is true, was not as gentle and sweet as she had been.\nEverything seemed to be going wrong with her, and she had lost heart\nand patience together. Mamma Coupeau had overheard her saying that\nshe was really a great burden. This naturally cut her to the heart,\nand when she saw her eldest daughter, Mme Lerat, she wept piteously\nand declared that she was being starved to death, and when these\ncomplaints drew from her daughter’s pocket a little silver, she\nexpended it in dainties.",
        "She told the most preposterous tales to Mme Lerat about Gervaise–of\nher new finery and of cakes and delicacies eaten in the corner and\nmany other things of infinitely more consequence. Then in a little\nwhile she turned against the Lorilleuxs and talked of them in the most\nbitter manner. At the height of her illness it so happened that her\ntwo daughters met one afternoon at her bedside. Their mother made a\nmotion to them to come closer. Then she went on to tell them, between\nparoxysms of coughing, that her son came home dead drunk the night\nbefore and that she was absolutely certain that Gervaise spent the\nnight in Lantier’s room. “It is all the more disgusting,” she added,\n“because I am certain that Nana heard what was going on quite as well\nas I did.”",
        "The two women did not appear either shocked or surprised.",
        "“It is none of our business,” said Mme Lorilleux. “If Coupeau does not\nchoose to take any notice of her conduct it is not for us to do so.”",
        "All the neighborhood were soon informed of the condition of things by\nher two sisters-in-law, who declared they entered her doors only on\ntheir mother’s account, who, poor thing, was compelled to live amid\nthese abominations.",
        "Everyone accused Gervaise now of having perverted poor Lantier. “Men\nwill be men,” they said; “surely you can’t expect them to turn a cold\nshoulder to women who throw themselves at their heads. She has no\npossible excuse; she is a disgrace to the whole street!”",
        "The Lorilleuxs invited Nana to dinner that they might question her,\nbut as soon as they began the child looked absolutely stupid, and\nthey could extort nothing from her.",
        "Amid this sudden and fierce indignation Gervaise lived–indifferent,\ndull and stupid. At first she loathed herself, and if Coupeau laid\nhis hand on her she shivered and ran away from him. But by degrees\nshe became accustomed to it. Her indolence had become excessive,\nand she only wished to be quiet and comfortable.",
        "After all, she asked herself, why should she care? If her lover\nand her husband were satisfied, why should she not be too? So\nthe household went on much as usual to all appearance. In reality,\nwhenever Coupeau came in tipsy, she left and went to Lantier’s room\nto sleep. She was not led there by passion or affection; it was simply\nthat it was more comfortable. She was very like a cat in her choice\nof soft, clean places.",
        "Mamma Coupeau never dared to speak out openly to the clearstarcher,\nbut after a dispute she was unsparing in her hints and allusions. The\nfirst time Gervaise fixed her eyes on her and heard all she had to say\nin profound silence. Then without seeming to speak of herself, she\ntook occasion to say not long afterward that when a woman was married\nto a man who was drinking himself to death a woman was very much to\nbe pitied and by no means to blame if she looked for consolation\nelsewhere.",
        "Another time, when taunted by the old woman, she went still further\nand declared that Lantier was as much her husband as was Coupeau–that\nhe was the father of two of her children. She talked a little twaddle\nabout the laws of nature, and a shrewd observer would have seen that\nshe–parrotlike–was repeating the words that some other person had\nput into her mouth. Besides, what were her neighbors doing all about\nher? They were not so extremely respectable that they had the right\nto attack her. And then she took house after house and showed her\nmother-in-law that while apparently so deaf to gossip she yet knew\nall that was going on about her. Yes, she knew–and now seemed to\ngloat over that which once had shocked and revolted her.",
        "“It is none of my business, I admit,” she cried; “let each person\nlive as he pleases, according to his own light, and let everybody\nelse alone.”",
        "One day when Mamma Coupeau spoke out more clearly she said with\ncompressed lips:",
        "“Now look here, you are flat on your back and you take advantage of\nthat fact. I have never said a word to you about your own life, but\nI know it all the same–and it was atrocious! That is all! I am not\ngoing into particulars, but remember, you had best not sit in\njudgment on me!”",
        "The old woman was nearly suffocated with rage and her cough.",
        "The next day Goujet came for his mother’s wash while Gervaise was\nout. Mamma Coupeau called him into her room and kept him for an hour.\nShe read the young man’s heart; she knew that his suspicions made\nhim miserable. And in revenge for something that had displeased\nher she told him the truth with many sighs and tears, as if her\ndaughter-in-law’s infamous conduct was a bitter blow to her.",
        "When Goujet left her room he was deadly pale and looked ten years\nolder than when he went in. The old woman had, too, the additional\npleasure of telling Gervaise on her return that Mme Goujet had sent\nword that her linen must be returned to her at once, ironed or\nunironed. And she was so animated and comparatively amiable that\nGervaise scented the truth and knew instinctively what she had done\nand what she was to expect with Goujet. Pale and trembling, she piled\nthe linen neatly in a basket and set forth to see Mme Goujet. Years\nhad passed since she had paid her friends one penny. The debt still\nstood at four hundred and twenty-five francs. Each time she took the\nmoney for her washing she spoke of being pressed just at that time.\nIt was a great mortification for her.",
        "Coupeau was, however, less scrupulous and said with a laugh that if\nshe kissed her friend occasionally in the corner it would keep things\nstraight and pay him well. Then Gervaise, with eyes blazing with\nindignation, would ask if he really meant that. Had he fallen so low?\nNor should he speak of Goujet in that way in her presence.",
        "Every time she took home the linen of these former friends she\nascended the stairs with a sick heart.",
        "“Ah, it is you, is it?” said Mme Goujet coldly as she opened the door.\nGervaise entered with some hesitation; she did not dare attempt to\nexcuse herself. She was no longer punctual to the hour or the\nday–everything about her was becoming perfectly disorderly.",
        "“For one whole week,” resumed the lace mender, “you have kept me\nwaiting. You have told me falsehood after falsehood. You have sent\nyour apprentice to tell me that there was an accident–something had\nbeen spilled on the shirts, they would come the next day, and so on.\nI have been unnecessarily annoyed and worried, besides losing much\ntime. There is no sense in it! Now what have you brought home? Are\nthe shirts here which you have had for a month and the skirt which\nwas missing last week?”",
        "“Yes,” said Gervaise, almost inaudibly; “yes, the skirt is here.\nLook at it!”",
        "But Mme Goujet cried out in indignation.",
        "That skirt did not belong to her, and she would not have it. This was\nthe crowning touch, if her things were to be changed in this way. She\ndid not like other people’s things.",
        "“And the shirts? Where are they? Lost, I suppose. Very well, settle it\nas you please, but these shirts I must have tomorrow morning!”",
        "There was a long silence. Gervaise was much disturbed by seeing that\nthe door of Goujet’s room was wide open. He was there, she was sure,\nand listening to all these reproaches which she knew to be deserved\nand to which she could not reply. She was very quiet and submissive\nand laid the linen on the bed as quickly as possible.",
        "Mme Goujet began to examine the pieces.",
        "“Well! Well!” she said. “No one can praise your washing nowadays.\nThere is not a piece here that is not dirtied by the iron. Look at\nthis shirt: it is scorched, and the buttons are fairly torn off by the\nroot. Everything comes back–that comes at all, I should say–with the\nbuttons off. Look at that sack: the dirt is all in it. No, no, I can’t\npay for such washing as this!”",
        "She stopped talking–while she counted the pieces. Then she exclaimed:",
        "“Two pairs of stockings, six towels and one napkin are missing from\nthis week. You are laughing at me, it seems. Now, just understand,\nI tell you to bring back all you have, ironed or not ironed. If in\nan hour your woman is not here with the rest I have done with you,\nMadame Coupeau!”",
        "At this moment Goujet coughed. Gervaise started. How could she bear\nbeing treated in this way before him? And she stood confused and\nsilent, waiting for the soiled clothes.",
        "Mme Goujet had taken her place and her work by the window.",
        "“And the linen?” said Gervaise timidly.",
        "“Many thanks,” said the old woman. “There is nothing this week.”",
        "Gervaise turned pale; it was clear that Mme Goujet meant to take away\nher custom from her. She sank into a chair. She made no attempt at\nexcuses; she only asked a question.",
        "“Is Monsieur Goujet ill?”",
        "“He is not well; at least he has just come in and is lying down to\nrest a little.”",
        "Mme Goujet spoke very slowly, almost solemnly, her pale face encircled\nby her white cap, and wearing, as usual, her plain black dress.",
        "And she explained that they were obliged to economize very closely.\nIn future she herself would do their washing. Of course Gervaise must\nknow that this would not be necessary had she and her husband paid\ntheir debt to her son. But of course they would submit; they would\nnever think of going to law about it. While she spoke of the debt her\nneedle moved rapidly to and fro in the delicate meshes of her work.",
        "“But,” continued Mme Goujet, “if you were to deny yourself a little\nand be careful and prudent, you could soon discharge your debt to us;\nyou live too well; you spend too freely. Were you to give us only ten\nfrancs each month–”",
        "She was interrupted by her son, who called impatiently, “Mother! Come\nhere, will you?”",
        "When she returned she changed the conversation. Her son had\nundoubtedly begged her to say no more about this money to Gervaise. In\nspite of her evident determination to avoid this subject, she returned\nto it again in about ten minutes. She knew from the beginning just\nwhat would happen. She had said so at the time, and all had turned out\nprecisely as she had prophesied. The tinworker had drunk up the shop\nand had left his wife to bear the load by herself. If her son had\ntaken her advice he would never have lent the money. His marriage\nhad fallen through, and he had lost his spirits. She grew very angry\nas she spoke and finally accused Gervaise openly of having, with her\nhusband, deliberately conspired to cheat her simplehearted son.",
        "“Many women,” she exclaimed, “played the parts of hypocrites and\nprudes for years and were found out at the last!”",
        "“Mother! Mother!” called Goujet peremptorily.",
        "She rose and when she returned said:",
        "“Go in; he wants to see you.”",
        "Gervaise obeyed, leaving the door open behind her. She found the room\nsweet and fresh looking, like that of a young girl, with its simple\npictures and white curtains.",
        "Goujet, crushed by what he had heard from Mamma Coupeau, lay at full\nlength on the bed with pale face and haggard eyes.",
        "“Listen!” he said. “You must not mind my mother’s words; she does not\nunderstand. You do not owe me anything.”",
        "He staggered to his feet and stood leaning against the bed and looking\nat her.",
        "“Are you ill?” she said nervously.",
        "“No, not ill,” he answered, “but sick at heart. Sick when I remember\nwhat you said and see the truth. Leave me. I cannot bear to look at\nyou.”",
        "And he waved her away, not angrily, but with great decision. She went\nout without a word, for she had nothing to say. In the next room she\ntook up her basket and stood still a moment; Mme Goujet did not look\nup, but she said:",
        "“Remember, I want my linen at once, and when that is all sent back\nto me we will settle the account.”",
        "“Yes,” answered Gervaise. And she closed the door, leaving behind her\nall that sweet odor and cleanliness on which she had once placed so\nhigh a value. She returned to the shop with her head bowed down and\nlooking neither to the right nor the left.",
        "Mother Coupeau was sitting by the fire, having left her bed for the\nfirst time. Gervaise said nothing to her–not a word of reproach or\ncongratulation. She felt deadly tired; all her bones ached, as if she\nhad been beaten. She thought life very hard and wished that it were\nover for her.",
        "Gervaise soon grew to care for nothing but her three meals per day.\nThe shop ran itself; one by one her customers left her. Gervaise\nshrugged her shoulders half indifferently, half insolently; everybody\ncould leave her, she said: she could always get work. But she was\nmistaken, and soon it became necessary for her to dismiss Mme Putois,\nkeeping no assistant except Augustine, who seemed to grow more and\nmore stupid as time went on. Ruin was fast approaching. Naturally, as\nindolence and poverty increased, so did lack of cleanliness. No one\nwould ever have known that pretty blue shop in which Gervaise had\nformerly taken such pride. The windows were unwashed and covered with\nthe mud scattered by the passing carriages. Within it was still more\nforlorn: the dampness of the steaming linen had ruined the paper;\neverything was covered with dust; the stove, which once had been kept\nso bright, was broken and battered. The long ironing table was covered\nwith wine stains and grease, looking as if it had served a whole\ngarrison. The atmosphere was loaded with a smell of cooking and of\nsour starch. But Gervaise was unconscious of it. She did not notice\nthe torn and untidy paper and, having ceased to pay any attention to\npersonal cleanliness, was hardly likely to spend her time in scrubbing\nthe greasy floors. She allowed the dust to accumulate over everything\nand never lifted a finger to remove it. Her own comfort and\ntranquillity were now her first considerations.",
        "Her debts were increasing, but they had ceased to give her any\nuneasiness. She was no longer honest or straightforward. She did not\ncare whether she ever paid or not, so long as she got what she wanted.\nWhen one shop refused her more credit she opened an account next\ndoor. She owed something in every shop in the whole _Quartier_. She\ndared not pass the grocer or the baker in her own street and was\ncompelled to make a lengthy circuit each time she went out. The\ntradespeople muttered and grumbled, and some went so far as to call\nher a thief and a swindler.",
        "One evening the man who had sold her the furniture for Lantier’s room\ncame in with ugly threats.",
        "Such scenes were unquestionably disagreeable. She trembled for an hour\nafter them, but they never took away her appetite.",
        "It was very stupid of these people, after all, she said to Lantier.\nHow could she pay them if she had no money? And where could she get\nmoney? She closed her eyes to the inevitable and would not think of\nthe future. Mamma Coupeau was well again, but the household had been\ndisorganized for more than a year. In summer there was more work\nbrought to the shop–white skirts and cambric dresses. There were\nups and downs, therefore: days when there was nothing in the house\nfor supper and others when the table was loaded.",
        "Mamma Coupeau was seen almost daily, going out with a bundle under her\napron and returning without it and with a radiant face, for the old\nwoman liked the excitement of going to the Mont-de-Piete.",
        "Gervaise was gradually emptying the house–linen and clothes, tools\nand furniture. In the beginning she took advantage of a good week\nto take out what she had pawned the week before, but after a while\nshe ceased to do that and sold her tickets. There was only one thing\nwhich cost her a pang, and that was selling her clock. She had sworn\nshe would not touch it, not unless she was dying of hunger, and\nwhen at last she saw her mother-in-law carry it away she dropped\ninto a chair and wept like a baby. But when the old woman came back\nwith twenty-five francs and she found she had five francs more than\nwas demanded by the pressing debt which had caused her to make the\nsacrifice, she was consoled and sent out at once for four sous’ worth\nof brandy. When these two women were on good terms they often drank\na glass together, sitting at the corner of the ironing table.",
        "Mamma Coupeau had a wonderful talent for bringing a glass in the\npocket of her apron without spilling a drop. She did not care to have\nthe neighbors know, but, in good truth, the neighbors knew very well\nand laughed and sneered as the old woman went in and out.",
        "This, as was natural and right, increased the prejudice against\nGervaise. Everyone said that things could not go on much longer;\nthe end was near.",
        "Amid all this ruin Coupeau thrived surprisingly. Bad liquor seemed\nto affect him agreeably. His appetite was good in spite of the amount\nhe drank, and he was growing stout. Lantier, however, shook his head,\ndeclaring that it was not honest flesh and that he was bloated. But\nCoupeau drank all the more after this statement and was rarely or ever\nsober. There began to be a strange bluish tone in his complexion. His\nspirits never flagged. He laughed at his wife when she told him of\nher embarrassments. What did he care, so long as she provided him with\nfood to eat? And the longer he was idle, the more exacting he became\nin regard to this food.",
        "He was ignorant of his wife’s infidelity, at least, so all his friends\ndeclared. They believed, moreover, that were he to discover it there\nwould be great trouble. But Mme Lerat, his own sister, shook her head\ndoubtfully, averring that she was not so sure of his ignorance.",
        "Lantier was also in good health and spirits, neither too stout nor\ntoo thin. He wished to remain just where he was, for he was thoroughly\nwell satisfied with himself, and this made him critical in regard to\nhis food, as he had made a study of the things he should eat and those\nhe should avoid for the preservation of his figure. Even when there\nwas not a cent he asked for eggs and cutlets: nourishing and light\nthings were what he required, he said. He ruled Gervaise with a rod of\niron, grumbled and found fault far more than Coupeau ever did. It was\na house with two masters, one of whom, cleverer by far than the other,\ntook the best of everything. He skimmed the Coupeaus, as it were, and\nkept all the cream for himself. He was fond of Nana because he liked\ngirls better than boys. He troubled himself little about Etienne.",
        "When people came and asked for Coupeau it was Lantier who appeared\nin his shirt sleeves with the air of the man of the house who is\nneedlessly disturbed. He answered for Coupeau, said it was one and\nthe same thing.",
        "Gervaise did not find this life always smooth and agreeable. She had\nno reason to complain of her health. She had become very stout. But\nit was hard work to provide for and please these two men. When they\ncame in, furious and out of temper, it was on her that they wreaked\ntheir rage. Coupeau abused her frightfully and called her by the\ncoarsest epithets. Lantier, on the contrary, was more select in his\nphraseology, but his words cut her quite as deeply. Fortunately people\nbecome accustomed to almost everything in this world, and Gervaise\nsoon ceased to care for the reproaches and injustice of these two men.\nShe even preferred to have them out of temper with her, for then they\nlet her alone in some degree; but when they were in a good humor they\nwere all the time at her heels, and she could not find a leisure\nmoment even to iron a cap, so constant were the demands they made upon\nher. They wanted her to do this and do that, to cook little dishes for\nthem and wait upon them by inches.",
        "One night she dreamed she was at the bottom of a well. Coupeau was\npushing her down with his fists, and Lantier was tickling her to make\nher jump out quicker. And this, she thought, was a very fair picture\nof her life! She said that the people of the _Quartier_ were very\nunjust, after all, when they reproached her for the way of life into\nwhich she had fallen. It was not her fault. It was not she who had\ndone it, and a little shiver ran over her as she reflected that\nperhaps the worst was not yet.",
        "The utter deterioration of her nature was shown by the fact that she\ndetested neither her husband nor Lantier. In a play at the Gaite she\nhad seen a woman hate her husband and poison him for the sake of her\nlover. This she thought very strange and unnatural. Why could the\nthree not have lived together peaceably? It would have been much\nmore reasonable!",
        "In spite of her debts, in spite of the shifts to which her increasing\npoverty condemned her, Gervaise would have considered herself quite\nwell off, but for the exacting selfishness of Lantier and Coupeau.",
        "Toward autumn Lantier became more and more disgusted, declared he\nhad nothing to live on but potato parings and that his health was\nsuffering. He was enraged at seeing the house so thoroughly cleared\nout, and he felt that the day was not far off when he must take his\nhat and depart. He had become accustomed to his den, and he hated to\nleave it. He was thoroughly provoked that the extravagant habits of\nGervaise necessitated this sacrifice on his part. Why could she not\nhave shown more sense? He was sure he didn’t know what would become\nof them. Could they have struggled on six months longer, he could\nhave concluded an affair which would have enabled him to support\nthe whole family in comfort.",
        "One day it came to pass that there was not a mouthful in the house,\nnot even a radish. Lantier sat by the stove in somber discontent.\nFinally he started up and went to call on the Poissons, to whom he\nsuddenly became friendly to a degree. He no longer taunted the police\nofficer but condescended to admit that the emperor was a good fellow\nafter all. He showed himself especially civil to Virginie, whom he\nconsidered a clever woman and well able to steer her bark through\nstormy seas.",
        "Virginie one day happened to say in his presence that she should like\nto establish herself in some business. He approved the plan and paid\nher a succession of adroit compliments on her capabilities and cited\nthe example of several women he knew who had made or were making their\nfortunes in this way.",
        "Virginie had the money, an inheritance from an aunt, but she\nhesitated, for she did not wish to leave the _Quartier_ and she\ndid not know of any shop she could have. Then Lantier led her into\na corner and whispered to her for ten minutes; he seemed to be\npersuading her to something. They continued to talk together in\nthis way at intervals for several days, seeming to have some secret\nunderstanding.",
        "Lantier all this time was fretting and scolding at the Coupeaus,\nasking Gervaise what on earth she intended to do, begging her to\nlook things fairly in the face. She owed five or six hundred francs\nto the tradespeople about her. She was behindhand with her rent, and\nMarescot, the landlord, threatened to turn her out if they did not pay\nbefore the first of January.",
        "The Mont-de-Piete had taken everything; there was literally nothing\nbut the nails in the walls left. What did she mean to do?",
        "Gervaise listened to all this at first listlessly, but she grew angry\nat last and cried out:",
        "“Look here! I will go away tomorrow and leave the key in the door.\nI had rather sleep in the gutter than live in this way!”",
        "“And I can’t say that it would not be a wise thing for you to do!\"\nanswered Lantier insidiously. “I might possibly assist you to find\nsomeone to take the lease off your hands whenever you really conclude\nto leave the shop.”",
        "“I am ready to leave it at once!” cried Gervaise violently. “I am\nsick and tired of it.”",
        "Then Lantier became serious and businesslike. He spoke openly of\nVirginie, who, he said, was looking for a shop; in fact, he now\nremembered having heard her say that she would like just such a\none as this.",
        "But Gervaise shrank back and grew strangely calm at this name of\nVirginie.",
        "She would see, she said; on the whole, she must have time to think.\nPeople said a great many things when they were angry, which on\nreflection were found not to be advisable.",
        "Lantier rang the changes on this subject for a week, but Gervaise said\nshe had decided to employ some woman and go to work again, and if she\nwere not able to get back her old customers she could try for new\nones. She said this merely to show Lantier that she was not so utterly\ndowncast and crushed as he had seemed to take for granted was the\ncase.",
        "He was reckless enough to drop the name of Virginie once more, and she\nturned upon him in a rage.",
        "“No, no, never!” She had always distrusted Virginie, and if she wanted\nthe shop it was only to humiliate her. Any other woman might have it,\nbut not this hypocrite, who had been waiting for years to gloat over\nher downfall. No, she understood now only too well the meaning of the\nyellow sparks in her cat’s eyes. It was clear to her that Virginie had\nnever forgotten the scene in the lavatory, and if she did not look out\nthere would be a repetition of it.",
        "Lantier stood aghast at this anger and this torrent of words, but\npresently he plucked up courage and bade her hold her tongue and told\nher she should not talk of his friends in that way. As for himself, he\nwas sick and tired of other people’s affairs; in future he would let\nthem all take care of themselves, without a word of counsel from him.",
        "January arrived, cold and damp. Mamma Coupeau took to her bed with\na violent cold which she expected each year at this time. But those\nabout her said she would never leave the house again, except feet\nfirst.",
        "Her children had learned to look forward to her death as a happy\ndeliverance for all. The physician who came once was not sent for\nagain. A little tisane was given her from time to time that she might\nnot feel herself utterly neglected. She was just alive; that was all.\nIt now became a mere question of time with her, but her brain was\nclear still, and in the expression of her eyes there were many things\nto be read–sorrow at seeing no sorrow in those she left behind her\nand anger against Nana, who was utterly indifferent to her.",
        "One Monday evening Coupeau came in as tipsy as usual and threw\nhimself on the bed, all dressed. Gervaise intended to remain with\nher mother-in-law part of the night, but Nana was very brave and\nsaid she would hear if her grandmother moved and wanted anything.",
        "About half-past three Gervaise woke with a start; it seemed to her\nthat a cold blast had swept through the room. Her candle had burned\ndown, and she nastily wrapped a shawl around her with trembling hands\nand hurried into the next room. Nana was sleeping quietly, and her\ngrandmother was dead in the bed at her side.",
        "Gervaise went to Lantier and waked him.",
        "“She is dead,” she said.",
        "“Well, what of it?” he muttered, half asleep. “Why don’t you go to\nsleep?”",
        "She turned away in silence while he grumbled at her coming to disturb\nhim by the intelligence of a death in the house.",
        "Gervaise dressed herself, not without tears, for she really loved the\ncross old woman whose son lay in the heavy slumbers of intoxication.",
        "When she went back to the room she found Nana sitting up and rubbing\nher eyes. The child realized what had come to pass and trembled\nnervously in the face of this death of which she had thought much in\nthe last two days, as of something which was hidden from children.",
        "“Get up!” said her mother in a low voice. “I do not wish you to stay\nhere.”",
        "The child slipped from her bed slowly and regretfully, with her eyes\nfixed on the dead body of her grandmother.",
        "Gervaise did not know what to do with her or where to send her. At\nthis moment Lantier appeared at the door. He had dressed himself,\nimpelled by a little shame at his own conduct.",
        "“Let the child go into my room,” he said, “and I will help you.”",
        "Nana looked first at her mother and then at Lantier and then trotted\nwith her little bare feet into the next room and slipped into the bed\nthat was still warm.",
        "She lay there wide awake with blazing cheeks and eyes and seemed to\nbe absorbed in thought.",
        "While Lantier and Gervaise were silently occupied with the dead\nCoupeau lay and snored.",
        "Gervaise hunted in a bureau to find a little crucifix which she had\nbrought from Plassans, when she suddenly remembered that Mamma Coupeau\nhad sold it. They each took a glass of wine and sat by the stove until\ndaybreak.",
        "About seven o’clock Coupeau woke. When he heard what had happened he\ndeclared they were jesting. But when he saw the body he fell on his\nknees and wept like a baby. Gervaise was touched by these tears and\nfound her heart softer toward her husband than it had been for many\na long year.",
        "“Courage, old friend!” said Lantier, pouring out a glass of wine as\nhe spoke.",
        "Coupeau took some wine, but he continued to weep, and Lantier went off\nunder pretext of informing the family, but he did not hurry. He walked\nalong slowly, smoking a cigar, and after he had been to Mme Lerat’s he\nstopped in at a _cremerie_ to take a cup of coffee, and there he\nsat for an hour or more in deep thought.",
        "By nine o’clock the family were assembled in the shop, whose shutters\nhad not been taken down. Lorilleux only remained for a few moments and\nthen went back to his shop. Mme Lorilleux shed a few tears and then\nsent Nana to buy a pound of candles.",
        "“How like Gervaise!” she murmured. “She can do nothing in a proper\nway!”",
        "Mme Lerat went about among the neighbors to borrow a crucifix. She\nbrought one so large that when it was laid on the breast of Mamma\nCoupeau the weight seemed to crush her.",
        "Then someone said something about holy water, so Nana was sent to the\nchurch with a bottle. The room assumed a new aspect. On a small table\nburned a candle, near it a glass of holy water in which was a branch\nof box.",
        "“Everything is in order,” murmured the sisters; “people can come now\nas soon as they please.”",
        "Lantier made his appearance about eleven. He had been to make\ninquiries in regard to funeral expenses.",
        "“The coffin,” he said, “is twelve francs, and if you want a Mass, ten\nfrancs more. A hearse is paid for according to its ornaments.”",
        "“You must remember,” said Mme Lorilleux with compressed lips, “that\nMamma must be buried according to her purse.”",
        "“Precisely!” answered Lantier. “I only tell you this as your guide.\nDecide what you want, and after breakfast I will go and attend to\nit all.”",
        "He spoke in a low voice, oppressed by the presence of the dead. The\nchildren were laughing in the courtyard and Nana singing loudly.",
        "Gervaise said gently:",
        "“We are not rich, to be sure, but we wish to do what she would have\nliked. If Mamma Coupeau has left us nothing it was not her fault and\nno reason why we should bury her as if she were a dog. No, there must\nbe a Mass and a hearse.”",
        "“And who will pay for it?” asked Mme Lorilleux. “We can’t, for we\nlost much money last week, and I am quite sure you would find it\nhard work!”",
        "Coupeau, when he was consulted, shrugged his shoulders with a gesture\nof profound indifference. Mme Lerat said she would pay her share.",
        "“There are three of us,” said Gervaise after a long calculation; “if\nwe each pay thirty francs we can do it with decency.”",
        "But Mme Lorilleux burst out furiously:",
        "“I will never consent to such folly. It is not that I care for the\nmoney, but I disapprove of the ostentation. You can do as you please.”",
        "“Very well,” replied Gervaise, “I will. I have taken care of your\nmother while she was living; I can bury her now that she is dead.”",
        "Then Mme Lorilleux fell to crying, and Lantier had great trouble\nin preventing her from going away at once, and the quarrel grew so\nviolent that Mme Lerat hastily closed the door of the room where\nthe dead woman lay, as if she feared the noise would waken her.\nThe children’s voices rose shrill in the air with Nana’s perpetual\n“Tra-la-la” above all the rest.",
        "“Heavens, how wearisome those children are with their songs,” said\nLantier. “Tell them to be quiet, and make Nana come in and sit down.”",
        "Gervaise obeyed these dictatorial orders while her sisters-in-law went\nhome to breakfast, while the Coupeaus tried to eat, but they were made\nuncomfortable by the presence of death in their crowded quarters. The\ndetails of their daily life were disarranged.",
        "Gervaise went to Goujet and borrowed sixty francs, which, added to\nthirty from Mme Lerat, would pay the expenses of the funeral. In\nthe afternoon several persons came in and looked at the dead woman,\ncrossing themselves as they did so and shaking holy water over the\nbody with the branch of box. They then took their seats in the shop\nand talked of the poor thing and of her many virtues. One said she\nhad talked with her only three days before, and another asked if\nit were not possible it was a trance.",
        "By evening the Coupeaus felt it was more than they could bear.\nIt was a mistake to keep a body so long. One has, after all, only\nso many tears to shed, and that done, grief turns to worry. Mamma\nCoupeau–stiff and cold–was a terrible weight on them all. They\ngradually lost the sense of oppression, however, and spoke louder.",
        "After a while M. Marescot appeared. He went to the inner room and\nknelt at the side of the corpse. He was very religious, they saw.\nHe made a sign of the cross in the air and dipped the branch into\nthe holy water and sprinkled the body. M. Marescot, having finished\nhis devotions, passed out into the shop and said to Coupeau:",
        "“I came for the two quarters that are due. Have you got the money\nfor me?”",
        "“No sir, not entirely,” said Gervaise, coming forward, excessively\nannoyed at this scene taking place in the presence of her\nsisters-in-law. “You see, this trouble came upon us–”",
        "“Undoubtedly,” answered her landlord; “but we all of us have our\ntroubles. I cannot wait any longer. I really must have the money.\nIf I am not paid by tomorrow I shall most assuredly take immediate\nmeasures to turn you out.”",
        "Gervaise clasped her hands imploringly, but he shook his head,\nsaying that discussion was useless; besides, just then it would\nbe a disrespect to the dead.",
        "“A thousand pardons!” he said as he went out. “But remember that\nI must have the money tomorrow.”",
        "And as he passed the open door of the lighted room he saluted the\ncorpse with another genuflection.",
        "After he had gone the ladies gathered around the stove, where a great\npot of coffee stood, enough to keep them all awake for the whole\nnight. The Poissons arrived about eight o’clock; then Lantier,\ncarefully watching Gervaise, began to speak of the disgraceful act\ncommitted by the landlord in coming to a house to collect money at\nsuch a time.",
        "“He is a thorough hypocrite,” continued Lantier, “and were I in Madame\nCoupeau’s place, I would walk off and leave his house on his hands.”",
        "Gervaise heard but did not seem to heed.",
        "The Lorilleuxs, delighted at the idea that she would lose her shop,\ndeclared that Lantier’s idea was an excellent one. They gave Coupeau\na push and repeated it to him.",
        "Gervaise seemed to be disposed to yield, and then Virginie spoke in\nthe blandest of tones.",
        "“I will take the lease off your hands,” she said, “and will arrange\nthe back rent with your landlord.”",
        "“No, no! Thank you,” cried Gervaise, shaking off the lethargy in which\nshe had been wrapped. “I can manage this matter and I can work. No,\nno, I say.”",
        "Lantier interposed and said soothingly:",
        "“Never mind! We will talk of it another time–tomorrow, possibly.”",
        "The family were to sit up all night. Nana cried vociferously when she\nwas sent into the Boche quarters to sleep; the Poissons remained until\nmidnight. Virginia began to talk of the country: she would like to be\nburied under a tree with flowers and grass on her grave. Mme Lerat\nsaid that in her wardrobe–folded up in lavender–was the linen sheet\nin which her body was to be wrapped.",
        "When the Poissons went away Lantier accompanied them in order,\nhe said, to leave his bed for the ladies, who could take turns in\nsleeping there. But the ladies preferred to remain together about\nthe stove.",
        "Mme Lorilleux said she had no black dress, and it was too bad that she\nmust buy one, for they were sadly pinched just at this time. And she\nasked Gervaise if she was sure that her mother had not a black skirt\nwhich would do, one that had been given her on her birthday. Gervaise\nwent for the skirt. Yes, it would do if it were taken in at the waist.",
        "Then Mme Lorilleux looked at the bed and the wardrobe and asked if\nthere was nothing else belonging to her mother.",
        "Here Mme Lerat interfered. The Coupeaus, she said, had taken care of\nher mother, and they were entitled to all the trifles she had left.\nThe night seemed endless. They drank coffee and went by turns to look\nat the body, lying silent and calm under the flickering light of the\ncandle.",
        "The interment was to take place at half-past ten, but Gervaise would\ngladly have given a hundred francs, if she had had them, to anyone who\nwould have taken Mamma Coupeau away three hours before the time fixed.",
        "“Ah,” she said to herself, “it is no use to disguise the fact: people\nare very much in the way after they are dead, no matter how much you\nhave loved them!”",
        "Father Bazonge, who was never known to be sober, appeared with the\ncoffin and the pall. When he saw Gervaise he stood with his eyes\nstarting from his head.",
        "“I beg you pardon,” he said, “but I thought it was for you,” and he\nwas turning to go away.",
        "“Leave the coffin!” cried Gervaise, growing very pale. Bazonge began\nto apologize:",
        "“I heard them talking yesterday, but I did not pay much attention. I\ncongratulate you that you are still alive. Though why I do, I do not\nknow, for life is not such a very agreeable thing.”",
        "Gervaise listened with a shiver of horror and a morbid dread that he\nwould take her away and shut her up in his box and bury her. She had\nonce heard him say that he knew a woman who would be only too thankful\nif he would do exactly that.",
        "“He is horribly drunk,” she murmured in a tone of mingled disgust and\nterror.",
        "“It will come for you another time,” he said with a laugh; “you have\nonly to make me a little sign. I am a great consolation to women\nsometimes, and you need not sneer at poor Father Bazonge, for he has\nheld many a fine lady in his arms, and they made no complaint when\nhe laid them down to sleep in the shade of the evergreens.”",
        "“Do hold your tongue,” said Lorilleux; “this is no time for such talk.\nBe off with you!”",
        "The clock struck ten. The friends and neighbors had assembled in the\nshop while the family were in the back room, nervous and feverish with\nsuspense.",
        "Four men appeared–the undertaker, Bazonge and his three assistants\nplaced the body in the coffin. Bazonge held the screws in his mouth\nand waited for the family to take their last farewell.",
        "Then Coupeau, his two sisters and Gervaise kissed their mother,\nand their tears fell fast on her cold face. The lid was put on and\nfastened down.",
        "The hearse was at the door to the great edification of the\ntradespeople of the neighborhood, who said under their breath that\nthe Coupeaus had best pay their debts.",
        "“It is shameful,” Gervaise was saying at the same moment, speaking\nof the Lorilleuxs. “These people have not even brought a bouquet of\nviolets for their mother.”",
        "It was true they had come empty-handed, while Mme Lerat had brought\na wreath of artificial flowers which was laid on the bier.",
        "Coupeau and Lorilleux, with their hats in their hands, walked at the\nhead of the procession of men. After them followed the ladies, headed\nby Mme Lorilleux in her black skirt, wrenched from the dead, her\nsister trying to cover a purple dress with a large black shawl.",
        "Gervaise had lingered behind to close the shop and give Nana into the\ncharge of Mme Boche and then ran to overtake the procession, while the\nlittle girl stood with the concierge, profoundly interested in seeing\nher grandmother carried in that beautiful carriage.",
        "Just as Gervaise joined the procession Goujet came up a side street\nand saluted her with a slight bow and with a faint sweet smile. The\ntears rushed to her eyes. She did not weep for Mamma Coupeau but\nrather for herself, but her sisters-in-law looked at her as if she\nwere the greatest hypocrite in the world.",
        "At the church the ceremony was of short duration. The Mass dragged\na little because the priest was very old.",
        "The cemetery was not far off, and the cortege soon reached it. A\npriest came out of a house near by and shivered as he saw his breath\nrise with each _De Profundis_ he uttered.",
        "The coffin was lowered, and as the frozen earth fell upon it more\ntears were shed, accompanied, however, by sigh of relief.",
        "The procession dispersed outside the gates of the cemetery, and at\nthe very first cabaret Coupeau turned in, leaving Gervaise alone on\nthe sidewalk. She beckoned to Goujet, who was turning the corner.",
        "“I want to speak to you,” she said timidly. “I want to tell you how\nashamed I am for coming to you again to borrow money, but I was at\nmy wit’s end.”",
        "“I am always glad to be of use to you,” answered the blacksmith. “But\npray never allude to the matter before my mother, for I do not wish\nto trouble her. She and I think differently on many subjects.”",
        "She looked at him sadly and earnestly. Through her mind flitted a\nvague regret that she had not done as he desired, that she had not\ngone away with him somewhere. Then a vile temptation assailed her.\nShe trembled.",
        "“You are not angry now?” she said entreatingly.",
        "“No, not angry, but still heartsick. All is over between us now\nand forever.” And he walked off with long strides, leaving Gervaise\nstunned by his words.",
        "“All is over between us!” she kept saying to herself. “And what more\nis there for me then in life?”",
        "She sat down in her empty, desolate room and drank a large tumbler\nof wine. When the others came in she looked up suddenly and said to\nVirginie gently:",
        "“If you want the shop, take it!”",
        "Virginie and her husband jumped at this and sent for the concierge,\nwho consented to the arrangement on condition that the new tenants\nwould become security for the two quarters then due.",
        "This was agreed upon. The Coupeaus would take a room on the sixth\nfloor near the Lorilleuxs. Lantier said politely that if it would not\nbe disagreeable to the Poissons he should like much to retain his\npresent quarters.",
        "The policeman bowed stiffly but with every intention of being cordial\nand said he decidedly approved of the idea.",
        "Then Lantier withdrew from the discussion entirely, watching Gervaise\nand Virginie out of the corners of his eyes.",
        "That evening when Gervaise was alone again she felt utterly exhausted.\nThe place looked twice its usual size. It seemed to her that in\nleaving Mamma Coupeau in the quiet cemetery she had also left much\nthat was precious to her, a portion of her own life, her pride in her\nshop, her hopes and her energy. These were not all, either, that she\nhad buried that day. Her heart was as bare and empty as her walls and\nher home. She was too weary to try and analyze her sensations but\nmoved about as if in a dream.",
        "At ten o’clock, when Nana was undressed, she wept, begging that she\nmight be allowed to sleep in her grandmother’s bed. Her mother vaguely\nwondered that the child was not afraid and allowed her to do as she\npleased.",
        "Nana was not timid by nature, and only her curiosity, not her fears,\nhad been excited by the events of the last three days, and she curled\nherself up with delight in the soft, warm feather bed.",
