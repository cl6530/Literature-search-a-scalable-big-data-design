        "Percy’s intuitive faculties were keen by nature and had been vastly\nincreased by cultivation. He had never forgotten Father Blackmore’s\nshrewd remarks of a year ago; and one of his first acts as\nCardinal-Protector had been to appoint that priest on the list of\nEnglish correspondents. Hitherto he had received some dozen letters, and\nnot one of them had been without its grain of gold. Especially he had\nnoticed that one warning ran through them all, namely, that sooner or\nlater there would be some overt act of provocation on the part of\nEnglish Catholics; and it was the memory of this that had inspired his\nvehement entreaties to the Pope this morning. As in the Roman and\nAfrican persecutions of the first three centuries, so now, the greatest\ndanger to the Catholic community lay not in the unjust measures of the\nGovernment but in the indiscreet zeal of the faithful themselves. The\nworld desired nothing better than a handle to its blade. The scabbard\nwas already cast away.",
        "When the young man had brought the four closely written sheets, dated\nfrom Westminster, the previous evening, Percy turned at once to the last\nparagraph before the usual Recommendations.",
        "“Mr. Brand’s late secretary, Mr. Phillips, whom your Eminence commended\nto me, has been to see me two or three times. He is in a curious state.\nHe has no faith; yet, intellectually, he sees no hope anywhere but in\nthe Catholic Church. He has even begged for admission to the Order of\nChrist Crucified, which of course is impossible. But there is no doubt\nhe is sincere; otherwise he would have professed Catholicism. I have\nintroduced him to many Catholics in the hope that they may help him. I\nshould much wish your Eminence to see him.”",
        "Before leaving England, Percy had followed up the acquaintance he had\nmade so strangely over Mrs. Brand’s reconciliation to God, and, scarcely\nknowing why, had commended him to the priest. He had not been\nparticularly impressed by Mr. Phillips; he had thought him a timid,\nundecided creature, yet he had been struck by the extremely unselfish\naction by which the man had forfeited his position. There must surely be\na good deal behind.",
        "And now the impulse had come to send for him. Perhaps the spiritual\natmosphere of Rome would precipitate faith. In any case, the\nconversation of Mr. Brand’s late secretary might be instructive.",
        "He struck the bell again.",
        "“Mr. Brent,” he said, “in your next letter to Father Blackmore, tell him\nthat I wish to see the man whom he proposed to send–Mr. Phillips.”",
        "“Yes, Eminence.”",
        "“There is no hurry. He can send him at his leisure.”",
        "“Yes, Eminence.”",
        "“But he must not come till January. That will be time enough, unless\nthere is urgent reason.”",
        "“Yes, Eminence.”",
        "The development of the Order of Christ Crucified had gone forward with\nalmost miraculous success. The appeal issued by the Holy Father\nthroughout Christendom had been as fire among stubble. It seemed as if\nthe Christian world had reached exactly that point of tension at which a\nnew organisation of this nature was needed, and the response had\nstartled even the most sanguine. Practically the whole of Rome with its\nsuburbs–three millions in all–had run to the enrolling stations in\nSt. Peter’s as starving men run to food, and desperate to the storming\nof a breach. For day after day the Pope himself had sat enthroned below\nthe altar of the Chair, a glorious, radiant figure, growing ever white\nand weary towards evening, imparting his Blessing with a silent sign to\neach individual of the vast crowd that swarmed up between the barriers,\nfresh from fast and Communion, to kneel before his new Superior and kiss\nthe Pontifical ring. The requirements had been as stringent as\ncircumstances allowed. Each postulant was obliged to go to confession to\na specially authorised priest, who examined sharply into motives and\nsincerity, and only one-third of the applicants had been accepted. This,\nthe authorities pointed out to the scornful, was not an excessive\nproportion; for it was to be remembered that most of those who had\npresented themselves had already undergone a sifting fierce as fire. Of\nthe three millions in Rome, two millions at least were exiles for their\nfaith, preferring to live obscure and despised in the shadow of God\nrather than in the desolate glare of their own infidel countries.",
        "On the fifth evening of the enrolment of novices an astonishing incident\nhad taken place. The old King of Spain (Queen Victoria’s second son),\nalready on the edge of the grave, had just risen and tottered before his\nRuler; it seemed for an instant as if he would fall, when the Pope\nhimself, by a sudden movement, had risen, caught him in his arms and\nkissed him; and then, still standing, had spread his arms abroad and\ndelivered a fervorino such as never had been heard before in the\nhistory of the basilica.",
        "“_Benedictus Dominus!_” he cried, with upraised face and shining eyes.\n“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He hath visited and redeemed His\npeople. I, John, Vicar of Christ, Servant of Servants, and sinner among\nsinners, bid you be of good courage in the Name of God. By Him Who hung\non the Cross, I promise eternal life to all who persevere in His Order.\nHe Himself has said it. To him that overcometh I will give a crown of\nlife.\n“Little children; fear not him that killeth the body. There is no more\nthat he can do. God and His Mother are amongst us....”",
        "So his voice had poured on, telling the enormous awe-stricken crowd of\nthe blood that already had been shed on the place where they stood, of\nthe body of the Apostle that lay scarcely fifty yards away, urging,\nencouraging, inspiring. They had vowed themselves to death, if that were\nGod’s Will; and if not, the intention would be taken for the deed. They\nwere under obedience now; their wills were no longer theirs but God’s;\nunder chastity–for their bodies were bought with a price; under\npoverty, and theirs was the kingdom of heaven.",
        "He had ended by a great silent Benediction of the City and the World:\nand there were not wanting a half-dozen of the faithful who had seen,\nthey thought, a white shape in the form of a bird that hung in the air\nwhile he spoke white as a mist, translucent as water....",
        "The consequent scenes in the city and suburbs had been unparalleled, for\nthousands of families had with one consent dissolved human ties.\nHusbands had found their way to the huge houses on the Quirinal set\napart for them; wives to the Aventine; while the children, as confident\nas their parents, had swarmed over to the Sisters of St. Vincent who had\nreceived at the Pope’s orders the gift of three streets to shelter them\nin. Everywhere the smoke of burning went up in the squares where\nhousehold property, rendered useless by the vows of poverty, were\nconsumed by their late owners; and daily long trains moved out from the\nstation outside the walls carrying jubilant loads of those who were\ndespatched by the Pope’s delegates to be the salt of men, consumed in\ntheir function, and leaven plunged in the vast measures of the infidel\nworld. And that infidel world welcomed their coming with bitter\nlaughter.",
        "From the rest of Christendom had poured in news of success. The same\nprecautions had been observed as in Rome, for the directions issued were\nprecise and searching; and day after day came in the long rolls of the\nnew Religious drawn up by the diocesan superiors.",
        "Within the last few days, too, other lists had arrived, more glorious\nthan all. Not only did reports stream in that already the Order was\nbeginning its work and that already broken communications were being\nre-established, that devoted missioners were in process of organising\nthemselves, and that hope was once more rising in the most desperate\nhearts; but better than all this was the tidings of victory in another\nsphere. In Paris forty of the new-born Order had been burned alive in\none day in the Latin quarter, before the Government intervened. From\nSpain, Holland, Russia had come in other names. In Dusseldorf eighteen\nmen and boys, surprised at their singing of Prime in the church of Saint\nLaurence, had been cast down one by one into the city-sewer, each\nchanting as he vanished:",
        "“_Christi Fili Dei vivi miserere nobis,“",
        "and from the darkness had come up the same broken song till it was\nsilenced with stones. Meanwhile, the German prisons were thronged with\nthe first batches of recusants. The world shrugged its shoulders, and\ndeclared that they had brought it on themselves, while yet it deprecated\nmob-violence, and requested the attention of the authorities and the\ndecisive repression of this new conspiracy of superstition. And within\nSt. Peter’s Church the workmen were busy at the long rows of new altars,\naffixing to the stone diptychs the brass-forged names of those who had\nalready fulfilled their vows and gained their crowns.",
        "It was the first word of God’s reply to the world’s challenge.",
        "As Christmas drew on it was announced that the Sovereign pontiff would\nsing mass on the last day of the year, at the papal altar of Saint\nPeter’s, on behalf of the Order; and preparations began to be made.",
        "It was to be a kind of public inauguration of the new enterprise; and,\nto the astonishment of all, a special summons was issued to all members\nof the Sacred College throughout the world to be present, unless hindered\nby sickness. It seemed as if the Pope were determined that the world\nshould understand that war was declared; for, although the command would\nnot involve the absence of any Cardinal from his province for more than\nfive days, yet many inconveniences must surely result. However, it had\nbeen said, and it was to be done.",
        "It was a strange Christmas.",
        "Percy was ordered to attend the Pope at his second mass, and himself\nsaid his three at midnight in his own private oratory. For the first\ntime in his life he saw that of which he had heard so often, the\nwonderful old-world Pontifical procession, lit by torches, going through\nthe streets from the Lateran to St. Anastasia, where the Pope for the\nlast few years had restored the ancient custom discontinued for nearly a\ncentury-and-a-half. The little basilica was reserved, of course, in\nevery corner for the peculiarly privileged; but the streets outside\nalong the whole route from the Cathedral to the church–and, indeed, the\nother two sides of the triangle as well, were one dense mass of silent\nheads and flaming torches. The Holy Father was attended at the altar by\nthe usual sovereigns; and Percy from his place watched the heavenly\ndrama of Christ’s Passion enacted through the veil of His nativity at\nthe hands of His old Angelic Vicar. It was hard to perceive Calvary\nhere; it was surely the air of Bethlehem, the celestial light, not the\nsupernatural darkness, that beamed round the simple altar. It was the\nChild called Wonderful that lay there beneath the old hands, rather than\nthe stricken Man of Sorrows.",
        "Adeste fideles sang the choir from the tribune.–Come, let us adore,\nrather than weep; let us exult, be content, be ourselves like little\nchildren. As He for us became a child, let us become childlike for Him.\nLet us put on the garments of infancy and the shoes of peace. For the\nLord hath reigned; He is clothed with beauty: the Lord is clothed with\nstrength and hath girded Himself. He hath established the world which\nshall not be moved: His throne is prepared from of old. He is from\neverlasting. Rejoice greatly then, O daughter of Zion, shout for joy, O\ndaughter of Jerusalem; behold thy King cometh, to thee, the Holy One,\nthe Saviour of the world. It will be time, then, to suffer by and bye,\nwhen the Prince of this world cometh upon the Prince of Heaven.",
        "So Percy mused, standing apart in his gorgeousness, striving to make\nhimself little and simple. Surely nothing was too hard for God! Might\nnot this mystic Birth once more do what it had done before–bring into\nsubjection through the might of its weakness every proud thing that\nexalts itself above all that is called God? It had drawn wise Kings once\nacross the desert, as well as shepherds from their flocks. It had kings\nabout it now, kneeling with the poor and foolish, kings who had laid\ndown their crowns, who brought the gold of loyal hearts, the myrrh of\ndesired martyrdom, and the incense of a pure faith. Could not republics,\ntoo, lay aside their splendour, mobs be tamed, selfishness deny itself,\nand wisdom confess its ignorance?...",
        "Then he remembered Felsenburgh; and his heart sickened within him.",
