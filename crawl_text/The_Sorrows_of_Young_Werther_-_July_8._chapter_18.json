We had been to Walheim: the ladies went in\na carriage; but during our walk I thought I saw in Charlotte’s\ndark eyes — I am a fool — but forgive me! you should see them,\n— those eyes. — However, to be brief (for my own eyes are weighed\ndown with sleep), you must know, when the ladies stepped into their\ncarriage again, young W. Seldstadt, Andran, and I were standing\nabout the door. They are a merry set of fellows, and they were\nall laughing and joking together. I watched Charlotte’s eyes.\nThey wandered from one to the other; but they did not light on me,\non me, who stood there motionless, and who saw nothing but her!\nMy heart bade her a thousand times adieu, but she noticed me not.\nThe carriage drove off; and my eyes filled with tears. I looked\nafter her: suddenly I saw Charlotte’s bonnet leaning out of the\nwindow, and she turned to look back, was it at me? My dear friend,\nI know not; and in this uncertainty I find consolation. Perhaps\nshe turned to look at me. Perhaps! Good-night — what a child I am!",
