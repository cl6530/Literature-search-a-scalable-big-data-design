        "I turned slowly away from where Wagner had disappeared over the side of\nthe wall and faced my captors, the Zards. Chief among them was the King,\nhe being a foot or two taller than the others, with a graceful and\npowerful pose that struck awe into the eyes of the beholder with its\ninnate command and dignity, both of which flowed from it as naturally as\nwater from a well. There were about twenty guards in the squadron that\nprotected the King, but it was not so much from the terror of them that\nthe Canitaurs fled, nor was it because of the guards that patrolled the\nwalls and were sure to join any fray attempted, it was instead an\napparent fear of the King, and rightly so, for his demeanor was fierce\nand sophisticated, as if he were not just a warrior nor solely a\nscholar, but a mixture of the two that gave him an aura that inspired\nfear, some unseen presence that filled the air around him and sent his\nneighbors into a reverencing awe reminiscent of a lover’s sacred\neuphoria, intangible yet undeniable.",
        "As I turned to him, he smiled and greeted me softly and pleasantly, in\nsuch a way that seemed contrary to his nature. Instead of being terrible\nand glorious like the crash of thunder or the din of waves, his voice\nwas melodious, subtly so, like a soft summer rain affecting the dreams\nof a slumbering child as it falls gently on his face. There was a rhythm\nthat ran through it, like poetry, yet not like average poetry, where the\nrhythm is forced and the lines deformed to its ungainly warble, but like\nheavenly poetry, where the rhythm is beyond the conscious and into the\nsubconscious, where it inspires a feeling of quaint remembrance of\nitself, as if it were there and not there at the same time. And while it\nwas soft and pleasant, it was not feminine, for it was a strong\nbaritone, reinforced by its own superiority and strengthened by its wit\nand sobriety.",
        "“Greetings, o’ chosen one,” he said to me, “I see that you have arrived\nsafely.”",
        "“Yes, quite soundly,” I replied, a little taken aback on two fronts:\nfirstly that he was not angry or indignant that I had attempted to\ndestroy his kingdom and take his life in the process, and secondly that\nhe seemed to expect me, as if I were his midday tea partner.",
        "“I am glad, for I would wish you no harm, though your Canitaurian\nfriends obviously felt no such concern. But just as well, for they\nalways were unpredictable. I’m sorry that there is no one here at the\nmoment, or we should have a great welcoming parade for our newly arrived\nkinsman redeemer, but they are off at the lake, inspecting the fire I\nsuppose. I must admit it caught me off guard for a moment or two, and at\nfirst I was actually quite surprised. I soon remembered, though, that\nour friends the Canitaurs would have gotten some notions in their heads\nof a battle, at your arrival. It must be a grand sight in any case, and\nnot one to miss.”",
        "I gave him a strange look, for I was a bit confused myself at the\nattitude he donned towards me, very friendly, as was Wagner, as I\nrecalled, though it seemed as contrary to his nature as it did to the\nKing’s. He saw the expression of my eyes, and seemed to read right\nthrough my thoughts and see my apprehension of punishment, for he\nbeckoned to his guards to leave us alone. They moved quickly and\nuniformly, a well-trained unit, and positioned themselves in a line\nformation along the street. The King and I then strolled down their\nmidst, they walking along with us at a distance of a few yards, which\nwas all that the closely built buildings would permit. In a moment or\ntwo we reached the Temple of Time, which was on the far side of a large\nsquare plaza that opened up between it, the palace, and the government\ncenter. Once we reached it, he led me inside and the guards took up post\naround its outside.",
        "“You need not fear,” he told me when we were alone, “You are among\nfriends here. You see, the Canitaurs were not the only ones waiting for\na kinsman redeemer, the Zards were as well. That day that you were seen\ngoing into the Canitaur’s outpost was a big disappointment for us, I had\nalmost begun to think that you were beyond our reach. I am sure you know\nall about the conflict between us, and the circumstances of your time\nthat brought its beginning about?”",
        "“Yes, I do,” I responded as we walked through the great entry hall of\nthe temple, lined with bookshelves and a rich red carpeting. He was\nsilent for another moment as we crossed into another room that led to a\nchamber with a long table in its center and a great many statues and\nworks of art scattered throughout its whole. There was an altar at the\nfar end, built into a giant statue of a White Eagle that graced the\nentire wall, it holding the altar in its giant claws.",
        "He saw me look at it and told me, “This is the Hall of Time, and that is\nthe altar to Temis, the God of Time. It is a very sacred place, to both\nus and the Canitaurs, for it was built by Temis himself, before the race\nof man inhabited the earth. By the time any men came to live on Daem, it\nhad been buried by the dirt and debris of thousands of years, but when\nthe Great War took place, the shock uncovered it and revealed it to men,\na sort of revelation that came only as it was needed the most. Daem’s\nwar started over the control of it, and to a point still is. To a\ncertain extent is has helped us greatly, since the Canitaurs are afraid\nto lay siege to us in the regular fashion, for fear that it will be laid\nto ruin, and then our fate sealed in flesh and bone as well as earth and\nstone. But come, there is something I want to show you,” he told me.",
        "With that he started over to a door in the wall adjacent to the\nentrance, which, as there were only two doors, was the only other exit.\nIt led to a long, winding stair that went up to the top of the tower\nthat I had seen from below. We walked up it in silence, more from awe of\nits magnificent construction on my part than fatigue in climbing its\nsteep stairs, which wound on and on almost indefinitely. There were no\nwindows in the tower, and only a few paintings to liven up the sparsely\ndecorated walls, yet they needed no adornments, for they were\nbeautifully constructed from a strange stone that split and colored in a\nmarvelous twisting pattern.",
        "At last we came to the top. It was much like it had appeared to be from\nbelow, for it was a large glass sphere that sat on the tower, like the\ndome on top of a light pole. It was divided in two, and the stairs went\nright through the bottom half and opened into a circular foyer that then\nhad a small flight of stairs running up to the main room. There were\nlittle closets and such in the empty spaces on the bottom floor. The\nupper room was a good thirty feet in diameter, and the walls and ceiling\nwere all made of glass, very sturdy and insulating, yet completely\ntransparent. On the floor was an odd carpet that was smooth and thin,\nlike a silk or fine linen, yet very strong. There was a rounded table on\nthe side of the entrance hole opposite the stairs, and a curved couch\nthat sat against the wall behind it, cut perfectly to its circular\noutline. Two cushioned chairs sat at the table and a small end table\nleaned up against the couch, on top of which there was a medium sized\nspyglass, that is, a telescope.",
        "The sun was just coming up and shining its golden hues on the\nsurrounding lands, which were beginning to darken as the fires of Lake\nUmquam Renatusum died down to a faint glow in the center of the forests\nof the near-north. It was the first time that I had gotten a bird’s eye\nview of Daem, and I was amazed at its beauty. The plains stretched on\none side of Nunami like a broad field of gold in the morning light, its\ndew drizzled grasses waving in a solemn and dignified manner to and fro\nlike the constant beating of the earth’s heart, and when looked upon\nabstractly it moved as if one great beast of benevolence, holding itself\nin unison as it chorused back the silent tones of life. Its edges draped\ndown to the ocean like a curtain of woven sunlight on the eastern and\nsouthern sides of the island of Daem, and on the western side of Nunami\nthe great forest came up right to its edge. There was a little of the\nforest between the ocean and the city on that side, while to the north\nthere was a great stretch of trees, all the way until the ocean again\ncame into sight in the far, far north. On the ground the trees of Daem\nseemed like mighty towers and battlements of nature, and on the treeway\none felt suspended in air hundreds of feet above the ground on a cloud\nof green and growing foliage, but from afar and above they were revealed\nin their true splendor, shooting up from the earth as if they were the\narms of the ground itself, grasping huge clusters of leaves and branches\nfar above in their tightened fists. Some way into the forest, the ground\nsprang up into mountains that were as fierce and behemoth as the trees\nthat clothed them. They were terrible to the eye and mind, as evidences\nof the power that exists outside of oneself.",
        "The city of Nunami was also revealed to me for the first time in depth.\nAs I have said, it was surrounded by a thick, tall wall made of stones\nand precious jewels, with four gates, one at the furthest extreme in\neach direction. It was a circular city, made mostly of the same\nmaterials as the wall and temple, which were a plain, silvery stone; a\ndark rock with inherent patterns; a mixture of cobblestone and a\ncolorful compositor rock; and a vast array of metals, everything from\nbrass to silver to platinum. Made in an ancient style, the buildings\nwere tall, the average being what was equivalent to at least a dozen or\ntwo stories in the pre-desolation times, and they were close together,\nbuilt along roads paved with cobblestone and lined with trees whose\ngirth, though not as monstrous as those in the wild, was still great.\nThere were farm fields and vineyards and orchards and meadows for\ngrazing animals all within the city walls, and not just congregated\naround the outside, for there were buildings all around the wall’s\nperimeter, but scattered among the other buildings in a natural and\npleasing way. In the southern part there was a lake that was of fair\nsize, and a fleet of fishing boats anchored at its shore showed that it\ndid its part to contribute to the city’s well-being. Several of the\ntrees throughout the city were especially conspicuous in their grandeur,\nfor they rose hundreds of feet from the ground and had great waterfalls\nflowing down from their tops, as if they were crying great torrents of\ntears down from their aged faces, though if in sadness or joy, I\ncouldn’t tell.",
        "To the east there was land visible from the height at which I found\nmyself, though in the distance it became hazy and I could not make out\nits distinct features. It was evidentially corrupted, however, for it\nhad an uneasy look about it, as did the ocean, which was a faint, pale\nshadow of the rich blue it was in my childhood days. The sky as well was\ntainted, and it looked to be filled with the accumulated atrocities of\ncountless generations. The clouds were thick and bluish, and the\nspherical mural of the sky itself had been greatly dried, cracked, and\ncrumbled since my time, for it bore the marks of pain, the marks of the\nlabor pains of the earth’s last gestating doom. And well they should, I\r\nthought, for in the years since my natural life it had seen much\nsuffering and much destruction.",
        "The King broke the silence, saying, “Lovely, isn’t it, Jehu? And it is\nall yours for the taking.”",
        "“What do you mean,” I asked him.",
        "“Exactly what I said, the whole world is yours, if you want it.”",
        "“But how?”",
        "“All you have to do is join us, the Futurists, and we will reward you\nwith all the power and glory that you can imagine.”",
        "At that I sobered up and replied, “But what of Onan, of my quest to stop\nthe doom of humanity from materializing in this final juncture. He is\nthe one who sent me, and he is the Lord of the Past, whom the Canitaurs\nfollow. I am his agent, why would I turn from him to serve mere\nmortals?”",
        "He laughed a slight, sarcastic laugh, “Tell me, Jehu, to whom did he\nsend you, your ancestors or your offspring?”",
        "“To my ancestors,” I said slowly, “Though the Canitaurs seemed to imply\nthat my time was long ago. To be candid, I do not understand.”",
        "“Of course you do not understand, and how could you, when no one has\ntold you? You see, Jehu, the question of time is not so linear as you\nwould think. You know full well that the conflict between the Zards and\nCanitaurs is over how to address the renewing of the earth: they would\nsend you, our kinsman redeemer, back into time to prevent the nuclear\nwars, while we would send you to the future to bring back its\ncompletion. They hold to traditions as if they were the foundation of\nlife, while our people have no traditions in the traditional sense, if I\nmay use that oxymoronic phrase, but we look to what will come instead of\nwhat has passed. History is unimportant to the present, Jehu, because we\nhave advanced to the point that we do not make the same mistakes as our\nancestors. In the past, they waged war needlessly and did so in the name\nof humanitarian deeds. But today, we are advanced enough that we use\npeaceful and just means to reach our ends. In your day there were many\nabsurd beliefs, for example the so-called ’fats’ that were so vehemently\navoided, are actually quite healthy, while on the other hand,\nprotectionism and socialism are quite absurd ideas, and yet they were\nheld dear. But today we have no such presuppositions, today we\nunderstand the world and know justice where your society knew only its\nshadows. We do not need to be bound by the mistakes of yesterday, for we\nhave the enlightenment of today, and while the Canitaurs cling to the\nold time’s ways, we have progressed to the point where we have no need\nof such traditions.”",
        "He continued, “It may seem to you foolish to follow Zimri instead of\nOnan, because Onan’s realm has already been established and grows\ngreater everyday, while Zimri’s doesn’t exist and never will, but you\nmiss a very important point in the understanding of these matters. For,\nas you probably know, time and matter are the foundations of physical\nexistence, and while the two components are independent, they are also\nparallel. Matter is always revolving, from its simplest form in the atom\nto its greatest in the universe, everything is revolving and rotating.\nSo is time. Imagine time as a galaxy, revolving continually around the\nblack hole at its center, that is, an enigma that is actually devoid of\nall matter. Time is revolving around a great enigma as well, which is\ndevoid of time, that enigma being eternity. Eternity is not a place\nwhere there is infinite time, but rather a place where there is simply\nno time, it is the counter-part in the temporal realm of a black hole in\nthe material realm. And just as a galaxy in the material realm revolves\naround the black hole at its center, in the temporal realm, the flow of\ntime itself revolves around eternity. That means that time repeats\nitself over and over again, just as on earth a year is the amount of\ntime it takes the earth to revolve around the sun once, in the temporal\nrealm, an age is the amount of time that it takes the time continuum to\nrevolve once around eternity. Just as every year the climate on the\nearth is similar, every particular day having its usual temperature and\nweather, and every general period having the same seasons, so is time.\nWhile every age is completely new and original, they all follow the same\npattern, and through every age the same general events happen, though a\nfew of the small details change from one time to the next.",
        "“So you see, it is true that Onan sent you to both the past and the\nfuture of your original time. The Pastites would say that you were sent\nforward in time, because you existed in our past, while the Futurists\nwould say that you were sent backwards in time because you existed in\nour future. While this would seem an unimportant question, it is not,\nfor we have to choose one or the other. You, the kinsman redeemer have\nto choose one or the other. That is why you were sent, you have to\ndecide. Our fate must be decided by a mortal because the gods have vowed\nto never interfere directly in our ways again. You must decide, Jehu,\nfor you hold the fate of humanity in your hands: in all the other ages\nbefore us, the wrong decision was made, and every time some great\ncalamity came that somehow threw the earth into a great ice age that\ndestroyed all life for many millenniums. We know that the wrong decision\nwas made, but we cannot tell what it was that was done. Tell me Jehu,\nwill you join the Futurists? Surely you can see that the Pastites are\njust that, stuck in the past, with their obsession with traditions and\nlegends. They are of the past, but we are of the future, we are the\nprogressive ones. Dear Jehu, choose the future, and when the earth is\nspared from the great impending doom, we will set you up as ruler of the\nworld to show our gratitude. Will you join us, friend?” he asked me with\nthe most entreating eyes, though of somewhat doubtful sincerity.",
        "There was a deathly silence that followed, for I was thinking long and\nhard about what I should do, until at last I spoke, “Your majesty, I am\nafraid that I will have to turn you down and remain with the Pastites.\nOnan sent me, and it is Onan whom I shall follow.”",
        "The King shook his head and sighed dejectedly, for a moment he looked\ndisheartened and crestfallen, but then he again resumed his former\nprideful pose and said to me, less humbly and entreating than before,\n“Very well, I was afraid that you would do that. I have no choice now\nbut to keep you here indefinitely as a prisoner, until such time as you\nrealize the error of your ways and repent. It may seem improper to\nrefuse the decision of the kinsman redeemer, but I must, for I will not\nallow my people to be destroyed by your ignorance.”",
        "With that he turned and walked quickly down the stairs to the door,\nturning to me just as he reached it and adding with an almost spiteful\nintonation, “But then again, what clarity of mind can be expected from\nsomeone from the unenlightened past.” He then left the room, closing the\ndoor with a powerful thud, after which I heard a small metallic click\nand his strong, commanding footsteps fading down the long stairway. As\nsoon as the sound had died away and he was no more to be heard, I ran\ndown to the door and tried to open it, but to no avail, for it was\nlocked. There was no way to escape: I was a prisoner of the Zards.",
