        "By Tomas de Comyn",
        "[Population.] The enumeration of the natives for the assessment\nof tributes, in the manner ordained by the standing regulations\nof the Intendants of New Spain, is not observed in the Philippine\nIslands; nor indeed would this be an easy task. The wide extent of\nthe twenty-seven provinces of which they are composed, scattered, as\nthey are, through the great space comprehended between the southern\npart of Mindanao, and the almost desert islands known by the name of\nBatanes and Babuyanes, to the north of that of Luzon, presents almost\ninsurmountable obstacles, and in some measure affords an excuse for\nthe omission. Among these obstacles may be mentioned the necessity of\nwaiting for the favorable monsoon to set in, in order to perform the\nseveral voyages from one island to the other; the encumbered state\nof the grounds in many parts, the irregular and scattered situations\nof the settlements and dwellings, the variety among the natives and\ntheir dialects, the imperfect knowledge hitherto obtained of the\nrespective limits and extent of many districts, the general want of\nguides and auxiliaries, on whom reliance can be placed, and, above all,\nthe extreme repugnance the natives evince to the payment of tributes,\na circumstance which induces them to resort to all kinds of stratagems,\nin order to elude the vigilance of the collectors, and conceal their\nreal numbers.",
        "[Estimates.] The quinquennial census, as regularly enjoined, being\nthus found impracticable, no other means are left than to deduce from\nthe annual lists, transmitted by the district magistrates to the\nsuperintendent’s office, and those formed by the parish curates, a\nprudent estimate of the total number of inhabitants subject to our laws\nand religion; yet these data, although the only ones, and also the most\naccurate it is possible to obtain, for this reason, inspire so little\nconfidence, that it is necessary to use them with great caution. It is\nevident that all the district magistrates and curates do not possess\nthe same degree of care and minuteness in a research so important,\nand the omission or connivance of their respective delegates, more\nor less general, renders it probable that the number of tributes,\nnot included in the annual returns, is very considerable. If to\nthis we add the leged exemptions from tribute, justly granted to\nvarious individuals for a certain number of years, or during the\nperformance of special service, we shall easily be convinced of the\nimperfection of results, derived from such insecure principles. * * *\nI have carefully formed my estimates corresponding to the year 1810,\nand by confronting them with such data as I possess relating to the\npopulation of 1791, I have deduced the consoling assurance that,\nunder a parity of circumstances, the population of these Islands,\nfar from having diminished, has, in the interval, greatly increased.",
        "[Ratio to tributes.] From the collective returns recently made\nout by the district magistrates, it would appear that the total\nnumber of tributes amounts to 386,654, which multiplied by six and\none-half produces the sum of 2,515,406, at which I estimate the\ntotal population, including old men, women and children. I ought\nhere to observe, that I have chosen this medium of six and one-half\nbetween the five persons estimated in Spain and eight in the Indies,\nas constituting each family, or entire tribute; for although the\nprodigious fecundity of the women in the latter hemisphere, and the\nfacility of maintaining their numerous offspring, both the effects\nof the benignity of the climate and their sober way of living,\nsufficiently warrant the conclusion, that a greater number of persons\nenter into the composition of each family, I have, in this case, been\ninduced to pay deference to the observations of religious persons,\nintrusted with the care of souls, who have assured me that, whether\nit be owing to the great mortality prevailing among children, or\nthe influence of other local causes, in many districts each family,\nor entire tribute, does not exceed four and one-half persons.",
        "[Foreigners and wild tribes.] To the above amount it is necessary to\nadd 7,000 Sangleys (Chinese), who have been enumerated and subjected to\ntribute, for, although in the returns preserved in the public offices,\nthey are not rated at more than 4,700, there are ample reasons for\nconcluding, that many who are wandering about, or hidden in the\nprovinces, have eluded the general census. The European Spaniards,\nand Spanish creoles and mestizos, do not exceed 4,000 persons, of both\nsexes and all ages, and the distinct castes or modifications known in\nAmerica under the name of mulattos, quadroons, etc., although found\nin the Philippine Islands, are generally confounded in the three\nclasses of pure natives, Chinese mestizos, and Chinese. Besides the\nabove distinctions, various infidel and independent nations or tribes\nexist, more or less savage and ferocious, who have their dwellings in\nthe woods and glens, and are distinguished by the respective names of\nAetas, Ingolots, Negrillos, Igorots, Tinguianes, etc., nor is there\nscarcely a province in Luzon, that does not give shelter to some of\nthose isolated tribes, who inhabit and possess many of the mountainous\nranges, which ramificate and divide the wide and extended plains of\nthat beautiful island.",
        "[Origin of race.] The original race by which the Philippines are\npeopled, is beyond doubt Malayan, and the same that is observed\nin Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the other islands of this immense\narchipelago. The Philippine Islanders, very different from the\nMalabars, whose features possess great regularity, sweetness, and even\nbeauty, only resemble the latter in color, although they excel them in\nstature, and the good proportion of their limbs. The local population\nof the capital, in consequence of its continual communication with\nthe Chinese and other Asiatics, with the mariners of various nations,\nwith the soldiery and Mexican convicts, who are generally mulattos,\nand in considerable numbers sent to the Islands yearly in the way\nof transportation, has become a mixture of all kinds of nations and\nfeatures, or rather a degeneration from the primitive races.",
        "[Manila’s population.] Manila, the capital of the Philippine Islands,\nat present contains a population of from one hundred forty to one\nhundred fifty thousand inhabitants, of all classes; but it ought,\nhowever, to be understood, that in this computation are included\nthe populous suburbs of Santa Cruz, San Fernando, Binondo, Tondo,\nQuiapo, San Sebastian, San Anton, and Sampaloc; for although each is\nconsidered as a distinct town, having a separate curate, and civil\nmagistrate of its own, the subsequent union that has taken place rather\nmakes them appear as a prolongation of the city, divided into so many\nwards and parishes, in the center of which their respective churches\nare built. Among the chief provincial towns, several are found to\ncontain a population of from twenty to thirty thousand souls, and\nmany not less than ten to twelve thousaad. Finally, it is a generally\nreceived opinion that, besides the Moros and independent tribes, the\ntotal population of the Philippine Islands, subject to the authority\nof the king, is equal to three millions.",
        "[Cotton.] Among the varied productions of the Philippines, for many\nreasons, none is so deserving of attention as cotton. Its whiteness\nand find staple give to it such a superiority over that of the rest of\nAsia, and possibly of the world, that the Chinese anxiously seek it,\nin order pereferably to employ it in their most perfect textures,\nand purchase it thirty per cent dearer than the best from British\nIndia. Notwithstanding this extraordinary allurement, the vicinity\nof a good market, and the positive certainty that, however great the\nexportation, the growth can never equal the consumption and immense\ndemand for this article, it has, nevertheless, hitherto been found\nimpossible to extend and improve its cultivation, in such a way as to\nrender it a staple commodity of the country. Owing to this lamentable\nneglect, is it, that the annual exportation does not exceed five\nthousand “arrobas” (125,000 lbs.) whereas the British import into\nChina at the annual rate of 100,000 bales, or 1,200,000 “arrobas,\"\nproduced in their establishments at Bombay and Calcutta, and which,\nsold at the medium price of fifteen “taels,” for one hundred thirty\npounds, yield the net amount of $4,800,000.",
        "[Its advantages.] This want of attention to so important a branch\nof agriculture is the more to be regretted, as the Islands abound\nin situations peculiarly adapted for the cultivation of cotton, and\nthe accidental failure of the crops in some provinces, might easily\nbe made up by their success in others. The culture of this plant is\nbesides extremely easy, as it requires no other labor than clearing\nthe grounds from brush-wood, and lightly turning up the earth with a\nplough, before the seeds are scattered, which being done, the planter\nleaves the crop to its own chance, and in five months gathers abundant\nfruit, if, at the time the bud opens, it is not burnt by the north\nwinds, or rotted with unseasonable showers.",
        "[Restricted cultivation.] The provinces of Ilocos and Batangas\nare the only ones in which the cultivation of cotton is pursued\nwith any degree of zeal and care, and it greatly tends to enrich\nthe inhabitants. This successful example has not, however, hitherto\nexcited emulation in those of the other provinces; and thus the only\nproduction of the Philippine Islands, of which the excellence and\nsuperior demand in trade are as well known as its culture is easy,\nowing to strange fatality and causes which will be hereafter noticed,\nis left almost in a neglected state, or, at most, confined to the\nnarrow limits of local consumption.",
        "[Indigo.] Pangasinan, Pampanga, Bataan, La Laguna, Tayabas and\nCamarines produce indigo of various classes, and, although its\npreparation or the extraction of the dye, is in most of the above\nprovinces still performed in an equally imperfect manner, several\nsmall improvements have recently been made, which have bettered the\nquality, more particularly in La Laguna, the only district in which\nattempts have been made to imitate the process used in Guatemala,\nas well with regard to the construction and number of vats necessary,\nas the precipitation of the coloring particles–detached from the plant\nby the agitation of the water. In the other places, the whole of the\noperations are performed in a single vat, and the indigo obtained is\nnot unfrequently impregnated with lime and other extraneous substances.",
        "[Increasing culture.] Whatever may have been the causes of this evident\nbackwardness, from the period of the establishment of the Philippine\nCompany in these Islands, and in consequence of the exertions of some\nof the directors to promote the cultivation of indigo, at that time\nvery little known, the natives have slowly, though gradually, been\nreconciled to it; and discovering it to be one of the most advantageous\nbranches of industry, although accompanied with some labor and exposed\nto the influence of droughts and excessive heats, as well as to the\nrisks attendant on the extraordinary anticipation of the rainy seasons,\nhave of late years paid more attention to it. The quintal of indigo\nof the first class costs the planter from $35 to $40 at most; and in\nthe market of Manila it has been sold from $60 to $130, according to\nthe quality and the greater or lesser demand for the article at the\nseason. As, however, everything in this colony moves within a small\ncircle, it is not possible to obtain large quantities for exportation;\nnot only because of the risk in advancing the Indian sums of money\non account of his crop, but also owing to the annual surplus seldom\nexceeding from two to two thousand five hundred distributed in many\nhands, and collected by numerous agents, equally interested in making\nup their return-cargoes.",
        "[Sugar.] The cultivation of the sugar-cane is more or less extended\nto all the provinces of these Islands, owing to its consumption among\nthe natives being both great and general; but those of La Pampanga and\nPangasinan are more particularly devoted to it. These two provinces\nalone annually produce about 550,000 arrobas (13,750,000 lbs.) of\nwhich one-third is usually exported in Chinese and other foreign\nvessels. In extraordinary seasons, the amount exported greatly\nexceeds the quantity above stated, as, for example, happened in the\nmonsoon of 1796, when the planters came down to the port of Manila,\nand by contract exported upwards of nine millions weight, of the first\nand second qualities. The price of this article has experienced many\nvariations of late years; but the medium may be estimated at $6 for one\nhundred twenty-five pounds of the first quality, and $5 for the second.",
        "[Method of Manufacture.] The superior quality of the sugar of\nthe Philippines is acknowledged, when compared to that produced\nin the Island of Java, China, or Bengal; notwithstanding in the\nlatter countries it may naturally be concluded that greater pains\nand care are bestowed on its manufacture. The pressure of the cane\nin the Philippine Islands is performed by means of two coarse stone\ncylinders, placed on the ground, and moved in opposite directions by\nthe slow and unequal pace of a “carabao,” a species of ox or buffalo,\npeculiar to this and other Asiatic countries. The juice is conveyed to\nan iron caldron, and in this the other operations of boiling, skimming\nand cleansing take place, till the crystallization or adhering of\nthe sugar is completed. All these distinct parts of the process, in\nother colonies, are performed in four separate vessels, confided to\ndifferent hands, and consequently experience a much greater degree of\ncare and dexterity. After being properly clayed, the sugars acquire\nsuch a state of consistency that, when shipped in canvas bags, they\nbecome almost petrified in the course of the voyage, without moistening\nor purging, as I understand is the case with those of Bengal.",
        "[Silk.] Among the useful objects to which the Patriotic Society of\nManila (Amigos del Pais) directed their attention, from the very\nmoment of their formation, the planting of mulberry trees seems to\nhave met with peculiar encouragement. The society rightly judged that\nthe naturalization of so valuable a commodity as silk in these Islands\nwould materially increase the resources of the colony, and there was\nreason to hope that, besides local consumption, the growth might in\ntime be so much extended as to supply the wants of New Spain, which\nare not less than 80,000 lbs., amounting to from $350,000 to $400,000,\nconveyed there in the galleon annually sent to the port of Acapulco,\nby the Manila merchants, which article they are now compelled to\ncontract for in China.",
        "[Mulberry trees.] The Society gave the first impulse to this laudable\nproject, and then the governor of the Islands, Don José Basco, anxious\nto realize it, with this view sent Colonel Charles Conely on a special\ncommission to the province of Camarines. This zealous officer and\ndistrict magistrate, in the years 1786-1788 caused 4,485,782 mulberry\ntrees to be planted in the thirty districts under his jurisdiction;\nand incalculable are the happy results which would have attended a\nplan so extensive, and commenced with so much vigor, if it could have\nbeen continued with the same zeal by his successor, and not at once\ndestroyed, through a mistaken notion of humanity, with which, soon\nafter the departure of Governor Basco, they proceeded to exonerate\nthe Filipinos from all agricultural labor that was not free and\nspontaneous, in conformity, as was then alleged, to the general spirit\nof our Indian legislation. As it was natural to expect, the total\nabandonment of this valuable branch followed a measure so fatal, and\nnotwithstanding the efforts subsequently made by the Royal Company, in\norder to obtain its restoration, as well in Camarines as the Province\nof Tondo, all their exertions were in vain, though it must be allowed\nthat at the time several untoward circumstances contributed to thwart\ntheir anxious wishes. Notwithstanding this failure, the project, far\nfrom being deemed impracticable, would beyond all doubt succeed, and,\nunder powerful patronage, completely answer the well-founded hopes of\nits original conceivers and promoters. The natives themselves would\nsoon be convinced of the advantages to be derived from the possession\nof an article, in so many ways applicable to their own fine textures,\nand besides the variety of districts in the Islands, proved to be\nsuitable to the cultivation of this interesting tree, it is a known\nfact that many of the old mulberry groves are still in existence.",
        "[Beeswax.] The Bisayas, Cagayan, and many other provinces, produce wax\nin considerable abundance, which the Indians collect from the natural\nhives formed in the cavities of the trees, and it is also brought down\nby the infidel natives from the mountains to the neighboring towns. The\nquality certainly is not the best, and notwithstanding attempts have\nbeen made to cleanse it from the extraneous particles with which it\nis mixed, it always leaves a considerable sediment on the lower part\nof the cakes, and never acquires an entire whiteness. Its consumption\nis great, especially in the capital, and after supplying the wants of\nthe country, an annual surplus of from six hundred to eight hundred\nquintals is appropriated for exportation.",
        "[Neglected market.] This certainly might be converted into an article\nof extreme importance, especially for the kingdom of Peru, which\nin peaceable times receives its supplies from Spain, and even from\nthe Island of Cuba; but for this purpose it would be necessary to\nadopt the plan recommended by the enlightened zeal of the Patriotic\nSociety and previously encourage the establishment of artificial\nhives and the plantation of aromatic and flowering shrubs, which so\neasily attract and secure the permanency of the roving swarms, always\nready to undertake fresh labors. This, as well as many other points,\nhas hitherto been entirely overlooked.",
        "[Black pepper.] The production is cultivated in the Provinces of\nTayabas, Batangas, and La Laguna, but in such small quantities, that,\nnotwithstanding the powerful allurements of all kinds constantly held\nout by the Royal Company during the long period of twenty years,\ntheir agents have never been able to collect in more than about\n64,000 lbs. annually. After every encouragement, the most that\nhas been attained with the natives, is confined to their planting\nin some districts fifty to one hundred pepper-vines round their\nhuts, which they cultivate in the same way as they would plots of\nflowers, but without any other labor than supporting the plant with\na proportioned stake, clearing the ground from weeds, and attending\nto daily irrigation.",
        "[A possibility.] This article therefore scarcely deserves a place\namongst the flourishing branches of agriculture, at least till it has\nbeen raised from its present depressed state, and the grounds laid\nout in regular and productive pepper-groves. Till this is done, to\na corresponding extent, it must also be excluded from the number of\nproductions furnished by these Islands to commerce and exportation;\nmore particularly if we consider that, notwithstanding the great\nfragrance of the grain, as well as its general superiority over the\nrest of Asia, so great a difference exists in the actual price, that\nthis can never be compensated by its greater request in the markets of\nEurope, and much less enable it to compete with that of the British and\nDutch, till its abundance has considerably lowered its primitive value.",
        "[Not popular.] Finally, although an infinity of grounds are to be found\nadapted to the rapid propagation of pepper-vines, as may easily be\ninferred from the analogy and proximity of the Philippine Islands to\nthe others of this same archipelago, so well known for their growth\nof spices, it must be confessed that it is a species of culture by\nno means popular among the Philippine natives, and it would be almost\nrequiring too much from their inconstancy of character, to wish them\nto dedicate their lands and time to the raising of a production which,\nbesides demanding considerable care, is greatly exposed to injury,\nand even liable to be destroyed by the severity of the storms, which\nfrequently mark the seasons. With difficulty would they be induced to\nwait five years before they were able to gather the uncertain fruits\nof their labor and patience. If, therefore, it should ever be deemed\na measure of policy to encourage the growth of black pepper, it will\nbe necessary for the government to order the commons belonging to each\ntown, and adapted to this species of plantation, to be appropriated to\nthis use, by imposing on the inhabitants the obligation of taking care\nof them, and drawing from the respective coffers of each community the\nnecessary funds for the payment of the laborers, and the other expenses\nof cultivation. If this cannot be done, it will be necessary to wait\ntill the general condition of the country is improved, when through\nthe spirit of emulation, and the enterprises of the planters being duly\npatronized and supported, present difficulties may be overcome, and the\nprogressive results of future attempts will be then found to combine\nthe interests of individuals with the general welfare of the colony.",
        "[Coffee.] So choice is the quality of the coffee produced in the\nIsland of Luzon, especially in the districts of Indang and Silang,\nin the province of Cavite, that if it is not equal to that of Mocha,\nI at least consider it on parallel with the coffee of Bourbon; but,\nas the consumption and cultivation are extremely limited, it cannot\nwith any propriety be yet numbered among the articles contributing\nto the export-trade.",
        "[Cocoa.] Cocoa is something more attended to, in consequence of the\nuse of chocolate being greatly extended among the natives of easy\ncircumstances. That of the Island of Cebu, is esteemed superior to\nthe cocoa of Guayaquil, and possibly it is not excelled by that of\nSoconusco. As, however, the quantity raised does not suffice for\nthe local consumption, Guayaquil cocoa meets a ready sale, and is\ngenerally brought in return-cargo by the ships coming from Acapulco,\nand those belonging to the Philippine company dispatched from Callao,\nthe shipping port of Lima.",
        "The cultivation of these two articles in the Philippines is on the\nsame footing as that of pepper, which, as above stated, is rather an\nobject of luxury and recreation than one of speculation among the\nFilipinos. The observations and rules pointed out in the preceding\narticle, are, in a general sense, applicable to both these branches\nof industry.",
        "[Cinnamon.] Cinnamon groves, or trees of wild cinnamon, are to be\nfound in every province. In Mindanao, a Dutchman, some years ago,\nwas employed by orders of the government, in examining the forests\nand making experiments, with a view to discover the same tree of\nthis species that has given so much renown to Ceylon; but, whether\nit was owing to a failure in the discovery, or, when the plant was\nfound, as at the time was said to be the case, the same results were\nnot produced, from the want of skill in preparing, or stripping off\nthe bark; certain it is, that the laudable attempt totally failed,\nor rather the only advantage gained, has been the extracting from\nthe bark and more tender parts of the branches of the tree, an oil\nor essence of cinnamon, vigorous and aromatic in the extreme.",
        "[Experiment in Laguna.] About the same time, a land-owner of the name\nSalgado, undertook to form an extensive plantation of the same species\nin the province of La Laguna, and succeeded in seeing upwards of a\nmillion cinnamon trees thrive and grow to a considerable size; but\nat last, he was reluctantly compelled to desist from his enterprise,\nby the same reasons which led to the failure of Mindanao.",
        "[Need of experienced cultivators.] These facts are of sufficient\nauthority for our placing the cinnamon tree among the indigenous\nproductions of the Philippine Islands and considering their general\nexcellence above those of the same nature in the rest of Asia, it may\nreasonably be concluded that, without the tree being identically the\nsame, the cinnamon with which it is clothed will be found finer than\nthat yielded by the native plant of the Island of Ceylon, and this\ncircumstance, consequently, holds out a hope that, in the course of\ntime, it may become an article of traffic, as estimable as it would be\nnew. In order, however, that this flattering prospect may be realized,\nit will be requisite for the government to procure some families,\nor persons from the above island, acquainted with the process of\nstripping off the bark and preparing the cinnamon, by dexterously\noffering allurements, corresponding to the importance of the service,\nwhich, although in itself it may probably be an extremely simple\noperation, as long as it is unknown, will be an insuperable obstacle\nto the propagation of so important an agricultural pursuit.",
        "[Nutmeg.] Two species of nutmeg are known here, the one in shape\nresembling a pigeon’s egg, and the other of a perfectly spherical\nform; but both are wild and little aromatic, and consequently held\nin no great esteem.",
        "[Rice.] Rice is the bread and principal aliment of these natives, for\nwhich reason, although its cultivation is among the most disagreeable\ndepartments of husbandry, they devote themselves to it with astonishing\nconstancy and alacrity, so as to form a complete contrast with their\ncharacteristic indifference in most other respects. This must, however,\nbe taken as a certain indication of the possibility of training them\nup to useful labor; whenever they can be led on in a proper manner.",
        "[High yield.] The earth corresponds with surprising fertility to\nthe labors of the Filipino, rewarding him, in the good seasons, with\nninety, and even as high as one hundred per cent; a fact I have fully\nascertained and of which I besides possess undoubted proofs, obtained\nfrom the parish-curates of La Pampanga. As, however, the provinces are\nfrequently visited with dreadful hurricanes (called in the country,\nbaguios), desolated by locusts, and exposed to the effects of the\ngreat irregularities of nature, which, in these climes, often acts\nin extreme, the crops of this grain are precarious, or at least,\nno reliance can be placed on a certain surplus allowing an annual\nexportation to China. On this account, rice cannot be placed in the\nlist of those articles which give support to the external trade.",
        "[Dye and cabinet woods.] The “sibucao,” or logwood, and ebony, in\nboth which these islands abound, are the only woods in any tolerable\nrequest. The first is sold with advantage in Bengal, and the other\nmeets a ready sale in the ports of China, in the absence of that\nbrought from the Island of Bourbon, which is a quality infinitely\nsuperior. Both are however, articles of no great consumption, for,\nbeing bulky and possessing little intrinsic value, they will not\nbear the high charges of freight and other expenses, attendant on\nthe navigation of the Asiatic seas, and can only suit the shipper,\nas cargo, who is anxious not to return to the above countries in\nballast. Hence, as an object of export trade, these articles cannot\nbe estimated at more than $30,000 per annum.",
        "[Timber.] I deem it superfluous to dwell on a multitude of other\ngood and even precious woods in timber, with which the Philippine\nIslands are gifted, because this is a subject already suficiently well\nunderstood, and a complete collection of specimens, as well as some\nlarge blocks, were besides transmitted some years ago to the king’s\ndockyard. It may, however, be proper to remark, that the establishment\nnear the capital for shipbuilding and masts, are much more expensive\nthan is generally supposed, as well on account of the difficulties\nexperienced in dragging the trees from the interior of the mountains\nto the water’s edge, as the want of regularity and foresight with\nwhich these operations have been usually conducted. Besides these\nreasons, as it is necessary that the other materials requisite for\nthe construction and complete armament of vessels of a certain\nforce, should come from Europe, it is neither easy, nor indeed,\nwould it be economical, as was erroneously asserted, to carry into\neffect the government project of annually building, in the colony,\na ship of the line and a frigate. It ought further to be observed,\nthat no stock of timber, cut at a proper season and well cured, has\nbeen lain in, and although the wages of the native carpenters and\ncaulkers are moderate, no comparison whatever can be made between the\ndaily work they perform, and that which is done in the same space of\ntime in our dock-yards of Spain.",
        "[Ship building advantages.] Notwithstanding, however, the impediments\nabove stated, as it is undeniable that abundance of suitable timber is\nto be obtained, and as the conveyance of the remainder of the necessary\nnaval stores to the Philippine Islands is shorter and more economical\nthan to the coast of California, it possibly might answer, at least,\nmany mariners are of this opinion, in case it is deemed expedient to\ncontinue building at San Blas the brigs and corvettes necessary for the\nprotection of the military posts and missions, situated along the above\ncoasts, to order them preferably to be built in Cavite giving timely\nadvice, and previously taking care to make the necessary arrangements.",
        "[Gold.] Gold abounds in Luzon and in many of the other islands; but as\nthe mountains which conceal it are in possession of the pagan tribes,\nthe mines are not worked; indeed it may be said they are scarcely\nknown. These mountaineers collect it in the brooks and streamlets,\nand in the form of dust, offer it to the Christians who inhabit the\nneighboring plains, in exchange for coarse goods and fire-arms; and it\nhas sometimes happened that they have brought it down in grains of one\nand two ounces weight. The natives of the province of Camarines partly\ndevote themselves to the working of the mines of Mambulao and Paracale,\nwhich have the reputation of being very rich; but, far from availing\nthemselves in the smallest degree of the advantages of art, they\ncontent themselves with extracting the ore by means of an extremley\nimperfect fusion, which is done by placing the mineral in shells and\nthen heating them on embers. A considerable waste consequently takes\nplace, and although the metal obtained is good and high colored,\nit generally, passes into the hands of the district-magistrate, who\ncollects it at a price infinitely lower than it is worth in trade. It\nis a generally received opinion that gold mines are equally to be\nmet with in the Province of Caraga, situated on the coasts of the\ngreat Island of Mindanao, where, as well as in other points, this\nmetal is met with equal to twenty-two karats. The quantity, however,\nhitherto brought down from the mountains by the pagan tribes, and\nthat obtained by the tributary Filipinos, has not been an object of\nvery great importance.",
        "[Copper.] Well-founded reasons exist for presuming that, in\nthe Province of Ilocos, mines of virgin copper exist, a singular\nproduction of nature, or at least, not very common, if the generality\nof combinations under which this metal presents itself in the\nrest of the globe, are duly considered. This is partly inferred\nfrom the circumstance of its having been noticed that the Igorots,\nwho occasionally come down from the mountains to barter with the\nChristians, use certain coarse jars or vessels of copper, evidently\nmade by themselves with the use of a hammer, without any art or\nregularity; and as the ignorance of these demi-savages is too great\nfor them to possess the notions necessary for the separation of the\ncomponent parts which enter into the combination of minerals, and much\nless for the construction of furnaces suitable to the smelting and\nformation of the moulds, it is concluded they must have found some\nvein of copper entirely pure, which, without the necessity of any\nother preparation, they have been able to flatten with the hammer and\nrendered maleable, so as to convert it into the rough vessels above\nspoken of.",
        "[Cinnabar.] The district-magistrate of Caraga, Don Augustin de Ioldi,\nreceived a special commission from the government to explore and\nobtain information respecting a mine of cinnabar, which was said\nto be situated under his jurisdiction; and I have been informed of\nanother of the same species in the Island of Samar, the working of\nwhich has ceased for a considerable time, not because the prospect was\nunfavorable, but for the want of an intelligent person to superintend\nand carry on the operations. The utility of such a discovery is too\nobvious not to deserve, on the part of government, the most serious\nattention and every encouragement to render it available; and it is\nto be hoped that, as the first steps have already been taken in this\nimportant disclosure, the enterprise will not be abandoned, but, on\nthe contrary, that exertions will be made to obtain aid and advice\nfrom the Miners’ College of Mexico, as the best means of removing\ndoubt, and acting with judgment in the affair.",
        "[Iron.] Iron in mineral form is to be found at various points on Luzon,\nand those engaged in working it, without the necessity of digging;\ncollect the iron-bearing stones that constitute the upper stratum,\nthese, when placed in fusion, generally yield about forty per cent\nclear metal. This is the case in the mountains of Angat, situated\nin the Province of Bulacan, and also in the vicinity of the Baliwag\nRiver. In Morong, however, belonging to the Province of La Laguna,\nwhere the cannon-ball factory is established, the ore yields under\ntwenty-two per cent. Its quality is in general better than the Biscayan\niron, according to formal experiments and a report, made in 1798 to\nGovernor Don Rafael Maria de Aguilar, by two Biscayan master-smiths\nfrom the squadron of Admiral Alava. Witnesses to this test were the\nCount de Aviles and Don Felix de la Rosa, proprietors of the mines of\nMorong and Angat, and the factor of the Philippine Company, Don Juan\nFrancisco Urroroz. Notwithstanding its advantages, this interesting\nbranch of industry has not yet passed beyond the most rude principles\nand imperfect practice, owing to the want of correct information\nas to the best process, and scarcity of funds on the part of the\nproprietors to carry on their works. Without the aid of rolling or\nslitting mills, indeed unprovided with the most essential instruments,\nthey have hitherto confined themselves to converting their iron into\nplow shares, bolos, hoes, and such other agricultural implements;\nleaving the Chinese of Amoy in quiet possession of the advantages\nof being allowed to market annual supplies of all kinds of nails,\nthe boilers used on the sugar plantations, pots and pans, as well as\nother articles in this line, which might easily be manufactured in\nthe Islands.",
        "[Sulphur.] In the Island of Leyte, abundance of sulphur is met with,\nand from thence the gunpowder works of Manila are supplied at very\nreasonable prices. Jaspers, cornelians and agates, are also found in\nprofusion in many of these provinces; everything, indeed, promises\nvaried mineral wealth worthy of exciting the curiosity and useful\nresearches of mineralogists, who, unfortunately, have not hitherto\nextended their labors to these remote parts of the globe.",
        "[Pearls.] Pearl fisheries are, from time to time, undertaken off the\ncoast of the Island of Mindanao, and also near smaller islands not\nfar from Cebu, but with little success and less constancy, not because\nthere is a scarcity of fine pearls of a bright color and considerable\nsize, but on account of the divers’ want of skill and their just dread\nof the sharks, which, in great numbers infest these seas. Amber is\nfrequently gathered in considerable lumps in the vicinity of Samar and\nthe other Visayan Islands as well as mother-of-pearl, tortoise-shell,\nand red and black coral, of the latter kind of which, I have seen\nshafts as thick as my finger and six or eight feet long.",
        "[Estates.] The proprietors of estates in the Philippines are of\nfour classes. The most considerable is that of the religious orders,\nAugustinians and Dominicans, who cultivate their respective lands on\njoint account, or let them out at a moderate ground-rent, which the\nplanters pay in kind; but far from living in opulence, and accumulating\nthe immense revenues some of the religious communities enjoy in\nAmerica, they stand in need of all they earn and possess for their\nmaintenance, and in order to be enabled to discharge the various duties\nand obligations annexed to the missions with which they are entrusted.",
        "[Spanish planters.] The second class comprehends the Spanish\nproprietors, whose number possibly does not exceed a dozen of persons,\nand even they labor under such disadvantages, and have to contend with\nso many obstacles, under the existing order of things, that, compelled\nto divide their lands into rice plantations, in consequence of this\nbeing the species of culture to which the natives are most inclined,\nand to devote a considerable portion of them to the grazing of horned\ncattle, no one of them is in a situation to give to agriculture the\nvariety and extent desired, or to attain any progress in a pursuit\nwhich in other colonies rapidly leads to riches.",
        "[Filipino farmers.] The third consists of the principal mestizos\nand natives, and is in fact that which constitutes the real body of\nfarming proprietors. In the fourth and last may be included all the\nother natives, who generally possess a small strip of land situated\nround their dwellings, or at the extremities of the various towns\nand settlements formed by the conquerors; besides what they may\nhave obtained from their ancestors in the way of legal inheritance,\nwhich rights have been confirmed to them by the present sovereign of\nthe colony.",
        "[Aids to agriculture.] It will beyond doubt, in some measure dissipate\nthe distrust by which the Filipino is actuated, when the new and\npaternal exertions of the superior government, to ameliorate his\npresent situation, are fully known, and when that valuable portion of\nour distant population is assured that their rights will henceforth be\nrespected, and those exactions and compulsory levies which formerly\nso much disheartened them, are totally abolished. On the other\nhand, a new stimulus will be given by the living example and fresh\nimpulse communicated to the provinces by other families emigrating\nand settling there, nurtured in the spirit and principles of those\nreforms in the ideas and maxims of government by which the present\nera is distinguished. A practical participation in these advantages\nwill, most assuredly, awaken a spirit of enterprise and emulation\nthat may be extremely beneficial to agriculture, and as the wants\nof the natives increase in proportion as they are enabled to know\nand compare the comforts arising out of the presence and extension\nof conveniences and luxuries in their own towns, they will naturally\nbe led to possess and adopt them.",
        "[Plans for progress.] So salutary a change, however, can only be\nthe work of time, and as long as the government confines itself\nto a system merely protecting, the effects must consequently be\nslow. As it is therefore necessary to put in action more powerful\nsprings than the ordinary ones, it will be found expedient partly to\nrelax from some of those general principles which apply to societies,\ndifferently constituted, or rather formed of other perfectly distinct\nelements. As relating to the subject under discussion, I fortunately\ndiscover two means, pointed out in the laws themselves, essentially\njust, and at the same time capable of producing in this populous\ncolony, more than in any other, the desired results. The legislator,\nfounding himself on the common obligation of the subject to contribute\nsomething in return for the protection he receives, and to co-operate\nin the increase of the power and opulence of the State, proscribes\nidleness as a crime, and points out labor as a duty; and although\nthe regulations touching the natives breathe the spirit of humanity,\nand exhibit the wisdom with which they were originally formed, they\nnevertheless concur and are directed to this primary object. In them\nthe distribution of vacant lands, as well as of the natives at fair\ndaily wages to clear them, is universally allowed, and these it seems\nto me, are the means from an equitable and intelligent application\nof which the most beneficial consequences may be expected.",
        "[Confiscating unused lands.] The first cannot be attended with any\ngreat difficulty, because all the provinces abound in waste and vacant\nlands, and scarcely is there a district in which some are not to be\nfound of private property completely uncultivated and neglected,\nand consequently susceptible, as above stated, of being legally\ntransferred, for this reason alone, to the possession of an active\nowner. Let their nature however, be what it may, in their adjudication,\nit is of the greatest importance to proceed with uniformity, by\nconsecrating, in a most irrevocable manner, the solemnity of all\nsimilar grants. Public interest and reason, in the Philippine Islands,\nrequire that in all such cases deference only should be paid to\ndemands justly interposed, and formally established within a due and\nfixed period; but after full and public notice has been given by the\nrespective judicial authorities, of the titles about to be granted,\nthe counter claims the natives may seek to put in after the lapse of\nthe period prefixed, should be peremptorily disregarded. Although at\nfirst sight this appears a direct infringement on the imprescriptible\nrights of property, it must be considered that in some cases individual\ninterests ought to be sacrifced to the general good, and that the\nbalance used, when treating of the affairs of State, is never of\nthat rigid kind as if applied to those of minor consideration. The\nfact is, that by this means many would be induced to form estates,\nwho have hitherto been withheld by the dread of involving themselves,\nand spending their money in law suits; at the same time the natives,\ngradually accustoming themselves to this new order of things, would\nlay aside that disposition to strife and contention, which forms so\npeculiar a trait in their character, and that antipathy and odium would\nalso disappear with which they have usually viewed the agricultural\nundertakings of Spaniards.",
        "[Compulsory labor.] Proceeding to the consideration of the second\nmeans of accelerating the improvement of agriculture, viz., the\ndistribution of the natives, it will suffice to say that it would be\nequally easy to show that it is absolutely necessary rigorously to\ncarry into effect, in the Philippine Islands, whatever the laws on this\nsubject prescribed, otherwise we must give up all those substantial\nhopes entertained of the felicity of the colony. We are no longer in\na situation to be restricted to the removal of ordinary obstacles,\nand the season is gone by in which, as heretofore, it entered into\nour policy to employ no other than indirect stimulants–in order to\nincline the Filipino to labor. It is evident that admonitions and\noffers of reward no longer suffice; nor indeed have the advantageous\nterms proposed to them by some planters, with a view to withdraw\nthe lower orders of the natives, such as the timauas and caglianes\nplebeians, from the idle indifference in which they are sunk, been of\nany avail. Their wants and wishes being easily supplied, the whole\nof their happiness seems to depend on quiet and repose, and their\nhighest enjoyment on the pleasure of sleep. Energy, however, and a\ncertain degree of severity must be employed, if permanent resources\nare to be called forth, and if the progressive settlement of European\nfamilies and the formation of estates proportioned to the fertility\nof the soil and capabilities of the country are to enter into the\nviews of government. In vain would grants and transfers of vacant and\nuseless lands be made to new and enterprising proprietors, unless at\nthe same time they can be provided with laborers, and experience every\nother possible facility, in order to clear, enclose, and cultivate\nthem. Hence follows the indispensable necessity of appealing to the\nsystem of distributions, as above pointed out; for what class of\nlaborers can be obtained in a country where the whites are so few,\nunless it be the natives? Should they object to personal service,\nshould they refuse to labor for an equitable and daily allowance,\nby which means they would also cease to be burdens to the State\nand to society, are they not to be compelled to contribute by this\nmeans to the prosperity of which they are members; in a word, to\nthe public good, and thus make some provision for old age? If the\nsoldier, conveyed away from his native land, submits to dangers, and\nis unceasingly exposed to death in defence of the State, why should\nnot the Filipino moderately use his strength and activity in tilling\nthe fields which are to sustain him and enrich the commonwealth?",
        "[The undeveloped Philippines.] Besides, things in the Philippine\nIslands wear a very different aspect to what they do on the American\ncontinent, where, as authorized by the said laws, a certain number\nof natives may be impressed for a season, and sent off inland to a\nconsiderable distance from their dwellings, either for the purpose of\nagriculture, or working the mines, provided only they are taken care of\nduring their journeys, maintained, and the price of their daily labor,\nas fixed by the civil authorities, regularly paid to them. The immense\nvalleys and mountains susceptible of cultivation, especially in the\nIsland of Luzon, being once settled, and the facilities of obtaining\nhands increased, such legal acts of compulsion, far from being any\nlonger necessary, will have introduced a spirit of industry that\nwill render the labors of the field supportable and even desirable;\nand in this occupation all the tributary natives of the surrounding\nsettlements can be alternately employed, by the day or week, and thus\ndo their work almost at the door of their own huts, and as it were\nin sight of their wives and children.",
        "[No legal obstacle to forced labor.] If, after what has been above\nstated, the apparent opposition obstacle to which at first sight\nstrikes the eye, in Law 40, Title 12, Book 6, speaking on this subject,\nand expressly referring to the Philippine Islands, should be alleged,\nno more will be necessary than to study its genuine sense, or read it\nwith attention, in order to be convinced of its perfect concordance\nwith the essential parts of the other laws of the Indies, already\nquoted in explanation and support of the system of distributing\nthe laborers. The above-mentioned law does indeed contain a strict\nrecommendation to employ the Chinese and Japanese, not domiciliated,\nin preference to the natives, in the establishments for cutting timber\nand other royal works, and further enjoins that use is only to be made\nin emergencies, and when the preservation of the state should require\nit. It has, however, happened that, since the remote period at which\nthe above was promulgated, not only all contracts and commerce have\nceased, but also every communication with Japan has been interrupted,\nand for a number of years not a single individual of that ferocious\nrace has existed in the Philippine Islands. With regard to the Chinese,\nwho are supposed to be numerous in the capital, of late years they have\ndiminished so much, that according to a census made by orders of the\ngovernment in the year 1807, no more than four thousand seven hundred\nare found on the registers; and, if in consequence of their secreting\nthemselves, or withdrawing into the interior, a third more might be\nadded to the above amount, their total numbers would still remain\nvery inconsiderable, and infinitely inferior to what is required,\nnot only for the tillage of the estates, but even for the royal works.",
        "[Substitute laborers wanting.] As, therefore, the Japanese have totally\ndisappeared, and the number of Chinese is evidently inadequate to the\nwants of agriculture, it almost necessarily follows that the practice\nof distributing the Filipino laborers, as allowed by the aforesaid\nlaws of the Indies, under all circumstances, is the only alternate\nleft. Even if, against the adoption of this measure, it should be\nattempted to urge the ambiguous sense of the concluding part of the\nsecond clause, it would be easy to comprehend its true intent and\nmeaning, by referring to Law 1, Title 13, Book 5, which says:",
        "“That, considering the inconveniences which would arise from doing\naway with certain distributions of grounds, gardens, estates, and\nother plantations, in which the Indians are interested, as a matter\non which the preservation of those distant dominions and provinces\ndepends, it is ordained that compulsory labor, and such distributions\nas are advantageous to the public good, shall continue.”",
        "After so pointed an explanation, and a manifestation so clear of\nthe spirit of our legislation in this respect, all further comments\nwould be useless, and no doubt whatever can be any longer entertained\nof the expediency, and even of the justice of putting the plan of\nwell-regulated distributions in practice, as a powerful means to\npromote the agriculture, and secure to Spain the possession of these\nvaluable dominions of the Indian Seas. ....",
        "[Manufactures.] .... It would be impossible to gainsay Don Juan\nFrancisco Urroz, of the Philippine Company, in his detailed and\naccurate report to the managing committee in 1802, when he observes:",
        "“That the Philippine Islands, from time immemorial, were acquainted\nwith, and still retain, that species of industry peculiar to the\ncountry, adapted to the customs and wants of the natives, and which\nconstitutes the chief branch of their clothing. This, although\nconfined to coarse articles, may in its class be called perfect, as\nfar as it answers the end for which it is intended; and if an attempt\nwere made to enumerate the quantity of mats, handkerchiefs, sheeting,\nand a variety of other cloths manufactured for this purpose only in\nthe Provinces of Tondo, Laguna, Batangas, Ilocos, Cagayan, Camarines,\nAlbay, Visaya, etc., immense supplies of each kind would appear, which\ngive occupation to an incalculable number of looms, indistinctly worked\nby Indians, Chinese, and Sangleyan mestizos, indeed all the classes,\nin their own humble dwellings, built of canes and thatched with palm\nleaves, without any apparatus of regular manufacture.”",
        "[Native cloth weaving.] With equal truth am I enabled to add, that the\nnatural abilities of these natives in the manufacture of all kinds of\ncloths, fine as well as coarse, are really admirable. They succeed\nin reducing the harsh filaments of the palm-tree, known by the name\nof abaca, to such a degree of fineness, that they afterwards convert\nthem into textures equal to the best muslins of Bengal. The beauty\nand evenness of their embroideries and open work excite surprise;\nin short, the damask table-cloths, ornamental weaving, textures of\ncotton and palm-fibres, intermixed with silk, and manufactured in the\nabove-mentioned provinces, clearly prove how much the inhabitants of\nthe Philippine Islands, in natural abilities and dexterity, resemble\nthe other people of the Asiatic regions. It must nevertheless be\nallowed, that a want is noticed of that finish and polish which the\nperfection of art gives to each commodity; but this circumstance\nought not to appear strange, if we consider that, entirely devoid of\nall methodical instruction, and ignorant also of the importance of\nthe subdivision of labor, which contributes so greatly to simplify,\nshorten, and improve the respective excellence of all kinds of works,\nthe same natives gin and clean the cotton, and then spin and weave it,\nwithout any other instruments than their hands and feet, aided only by\nthe course and unsightly looms they themselves construct in a corner\nof their huts, with scarcely anything else than a few canes and sticks.",
        "[Aptitude for, but no development of, manufacturing.] From the\npreceding observations it may easily be deduced that, although\nthe natives succeed in preparing, with admirable dexterity, the\nproductions of their soil, and therewith satisfy the greatest part of\ntheir domestic wants, facts which certainly manifest their talents\nand aptitude to be employed in works of more taste and delicacy,\nmanufacturing industry is nevertheless far from being generalized,\nnor can it be said to be placed with any degree of solidity on its\ntrue and proper basis. Hence arise those great supplies of goods\nannually imported into the country, for the purpose of making up the\ndeficiencies of the local manufactures.",
        "[Improved methods and machinery needed.] The regular distribution or\nclassification of the assemblage of operations which follow each other\nin graduation, from the rough preparation of the first materials, till\nthe same have arrived at their perfect state of manufacture, instead\nof being practiced, is entirely unknown. The want of good machinery\nto free the cotton from the multitude of seeds with which it is\nencumbered, so as to perform the operation with ease and quickness, is\nthe first and greatest obstacle that occurs; and its tediousness to the\nnatives is so repugnant, that many sell their crops to others, without\nseparating the seeds, or decline growing the article altogether, not\nto be plagued with the trouble of cleaning it. As the want of method\nis also equal to the superabundance or waste of time employed, the\nexpenses of the goods manufactured increased in the same proportion,\nunder such evident and great disadvantages; for which reason, far from\nbeing able to compete with those brought from China and British India,\nthey only acquire estimation in the interior, when wanted to supply\nthe place of the latter, or in cases of accidental scarcity.",
        "[Scanty exports.] In a word, the only manufactured articles annually\nexported from the Philippine Islands are eight to twelve thousand\npieces exports of light sail cloth, two hundred thousand pounds of\nabaca cordage assorted, and six hundred carabao hides and deer skins,\nwhich can scarcely be considered in a tanned state/ for, although the\nRoyal Company, from the time of their establishment, long continued to\nexport considerable quantities of dimities, calicos, stripes, checks,\nand coverlids, as well as other cotton and silk goods, it was more\nwith a view to stimulate the districts of Ilocos to continue in the\nhabit of manufacturing, and thus introduce among the inhabitants of\nthat province a taste for industry, than the expectation of gain by\nthe sale of this kind of merchandise either in Spain or any of the\nsections of America. At length, wearied with the losses experienced by\ncarrying on this species of mercantile operations, without answering\nthe principal object in view, they resolved, for the time being,\nto suspend ventures attended with such discouraging circumstances.",
        "[Need of encouragement.] Notwithstanding so many impediments, it\nwould not, however, be prudent in the government entirely to abandon\nthe enterprise, and lose sight of the advantages the country offers,\nor indeed, to neglect turning the habitual facilities of the natives\nto some account. Far from there existing any positive grounds for\ndespairing of the progress of manufacturing industry, it may justly\nbe presumed that, whenever the sovereign, by adopting a different line\nof policy, shall allow the unlimited and indistinct settlement of all\nkinds of foreign colonists, and grant them the same facilities and\nprotection enjoyed by national ones, they will be induced to flock to\nthe Philippine Islands in considerable numbers, lured by the hope of\naccumulating fortunes in a country that presents a thousand attractions\nof every kind. Many, no doubt, will preferably devote themselves\nto commerce, others to agricultural undertakings and also to the\npursuits of mining, but necessarily some will turn their attention\nand employ their funds in the formation of extensive manufactures,\naided by intelligent instructors and suitable machinery. The\nnewly-introduced information and arts being thus diffused, it is\nnatural to expect they will be progressively adopted by a people\nalready possessing a taste and genius for this species of labor,\nby which means manufacturing industry will soon be raised from the\nstate of neglect and unprofitableness in which it is now left.",
        "[Internal commerce handicapped.] The circulation of the country\nproductions and effects of all kinds among the inhabitants of the\nprovinces, which, properly speaking, constitutes their internal\ncommerce, is tolerably active and considerable. Owing to the great\nfacilities of conveyance afforded by the number of rivers and lakes, on\nthe margins of which the Filipinos are fond of fixing their dwellings,\nthis commerce might be infinitely greater, if it was not obstructed\nby the monopoly of the magistrates in their respective districts\nand the unjust prerogative, exercised by the city, of imposing\nrates and arbitrary prices on the very persons who come to bring the\nsupplies. Nevertheless, as the iniquituous operations of the district\nmagistrates, however, active they may be, besides being restricted\nby their financial ability, regularly consist of arrangements to buy\nup only the chief articles, and those which promise most advantage,\nwith least trouble; as that restless inquietude which impels man on,\nunder the hope of bettering his condition, acts even amidst rigor of\noppression, a certain degree of stimulus and scope is still left in\nfavor of internal trade.",
        "[Inter-island traffic.] Hence it follows, that there is scarcely an\nisland or province, that does not carry on some traffic or other,\nby keeping up relations with its neighbors, which sometimes extend\nas far as the capital; where, in proportion as the produce and raw\nmaterials find a ready market, returns suitable and adequate to the\nconsumption of each place, respectively, are obtained. If, however, it\nwould be difficult to form an idea, even in the way of approximation,\nof the exchanges which take place between the various provinces,\na task that would render it necessary to enumerate them, one by one,\nit is equally so to make an estimate of the total amount of this class\nof operation carried on in Manila, their common center. Situated in\nthe bottom of an inmense bay, bathed by a large river, and the country\nround divided by an infinite number of streams and lakes descending\nfrom the provinces by which the capital is surrounded, the produce and\neffects are daily brought in and go out of suburbs so extended in a\ndiversity of small vessels and canoes, without its being possible to\nobtain any exact account of the multiplicity of transactions carried\non at one and the same time, in a city built on so large a scale.",
        "[Local markets.] Besides the traffic founded on ordinary consumption,\nthe necessity of obtaining assortments of home-manufactured as well\nas imported goods, in order to supply the markets, known by the name\nof tianguis, and which are held weekly in almost every town, there\nis another species of speculation, peculiar to the rich natives\nand Sangley mestizos, an industrious race, and also possessed of\nthe largest portion of the specie. This consists in the anticipated\npurchase of the crops of indigo, sugar, rice, etc., with a view to fix\ntheir own prices on the produce thus contracted for, when resold to the\nsecond hand. A propensity to barter and traffic, in all kinds of ways,\nis indeed universal among the natives, and as the principal springs\nwhich urge on internal circulation are already in motion, nothing\nmore is wanting than at once to destroy the obstacles previously\npointed out, and encourage the extension of luxury and comforts,\nin order that, by the number of the people’s wants being increased,\nas well as the means of supplying them, the force and velocity of\naction may in the same proportion be augmented.",
        "[External commerce.] Under “External Commerce” generally are comprised\nthe relations the Philippine Islands keep up with other nations, with\nthe Spanish possessions in America, and with the mother country; or,\nin other words, the sum total of their imports and exports.",
        "[Outside deterrents.] Many are the causes which, within the last\nten or twelve years, have influenced the mercantile relations of\nthese Islands, and prevented their organization on permanent and\nknown principles. The chief one, no doubt, has been the frequent and\nunforeseen changes, from peace to war, which have marked that unhappy\nperiod, and as under similar circumstances merchants, more than\nany other class of persons, are in the habit of acting on extremes,\nthere have been occasions in which, misled by the exaggerated idea\nof the galleon of Acapulco, and anxious to avail themselves of the\nfirst prices, generally also the highest, foreign speculators have\ninundated Manila with goods, by a competition from all quarters; and\nothers, owing to the channels being obstructed, when this market has\nexperienced an absolute scarcity of commodities, as well as of funds\nnecessary to continue the usual and almost only branch of commerce\nleft. The frequent failure of the sugar and indigo crops, has also\nin many instances restrained the North Americans and other neutrals\nfrom coming to these Islands with cargoes, and induced them to prefer\nJava, where they are at all times sure of finding returns. Besides\nthe influence of these extraordinary causes on the uncertainty\nand irregularity of external commerce, no small share must also be\nattributed to the strangeness of the peculiar constitution of the\ncountry, or the principles on which its trade is established.",
        "[Domestic discouragements.] Scarcely will it be believed, in the\ngreater part of civilized Europe, that a Spanish colony exists between\nAsia and America, whose merchants are forbidden to avail themselves\nof their advantageous situation, and that, as a special favor only\nare they allowed to send their effects to Mexico, once a year, but\nunder the following restrictions. It is a necessary condition, that\nevery shipper shall be a member of the Board of Trade (Consulado),\nand therein entitled to a vote, which supposes a residence of some\nyears in the country, besides the possession of property of his own to\nthe amount of $8,000. He is compelled to join with the other members,\nin order to be enabled to ship his goods in bales of a determined\nform and dimensions, in one single vessel, arranged, fitted out,\nand commanded by officers of the royal navy, under the character of a\nwar ship. He has also to contribute his proportion of $20,000, which,\nin the shape of a present, are given to the commander, at the end of\nevery round voyage. He cannot in any way interfere in the choice or\nqualities of the vessel, notwithstanding his property is to be risked\nin her; and what completes the extravagance of the system, is, that\nbefore anything is done he must pay down twenty-five or forty per cent\nfor freight, according to circumstances, which money is distributed\namong certain canons of the church, aldermen, subalterns of the army,\nand widows of Spaniards, to whom a given number of tickets or certified\npermits to ship are granted, either as a compensation for the smallness\nof their pay, or in the way of a privilege; but on express conditions\nthat, although they themselves are not members of the Board of Trade,\nthey shall not be allowed to negotiate and transfer them to persons\nnot having that quality. In the custom house nothing being admitted\nunless the number of bales shipped are accompanied by corresponding\npermits, and as it besides frequently happens that there is a degree\nof competition between the parties seeking to try their fortune in\nthis way, the original holders of the permits very often hang back,\nin such a manner that I have seen $500 offered for the transfer of\na right to ship three bales, which scarcely contained goods to the\namount of $1,000. Such, nevertheless, is the truth, and such the\nexact description of the famous Acapulco ship, which has excited so\nmuch jealousy among the merchants of Seville and Cadiz, and given\nrise to such an infinite number of disputes and lawsuits.",
        "[Business irregularities.] So complete a deviation from the rules\nand maxims usually received in trade, could not fail to produce\nin the Philippine Islands, as in fact it has, effects equally\nextraordinary with regard to those who follow this pursuit. The\nmerchant of Manila is, in fact, entirely different from the one in\nCadiz or Amsterdam. Without any correspondents in the manufacturing\ncountries and consequently possessed of no suitable advices of the\nfavorable variations in the respective markets, without brokers and\neven without regular books he seems to carry on his profession on\nno one fixed principle, and to have acquired his routine of business\nfrom mere habit and vague custom. His contracts are made out on stamped\npaper, and his bills or promissory notes no other than long and diffuse\nwritings or bonds, of which the dates and amounts are kept more in\nthe shape of bundles than by any due entry on his books; and what at\nonce gives the most clear idea of this irregularity is the singular\nfact that, for the space of twenty-five and possibly fifty years,\nonly one bankrupt has presented the state of his affairs to the Board\nof Trade, in conformity to the regulations prescribed by the general\nStatutes of Bankruptcy, whereas, numbers of cases have occurred in\nwhich these merchants have wasted or secreted the property of others\nwith impunity. Hence have arisen those irregularities, subterfuges\nand disputes, in a word, the absence of all mercantile business\ncarried on in a scrupulously punctual and correct manner. Hence, also,\nhave followed that distrust and embarrassment with which commercial\noperations are attended, as well as the difficulty of calculating\ntheir fluctuations. On the other hand, as in order to send off an\nexpedition by the annual ship to Acapulco, the previous consent\nof the majority of the incorporated merchants is necessary, before\nthis point is decided, months are passed in intrigues and disputes,\nthe peremptory period arrives, and if the articles wanted are in the\nmarket, they are purchased up with precipitation and paid for with\nthe monies the shippers have been able to obtain at an interest from\nthe administrators of pious and charitable funds. In this manner,\ncompelled to act almost always without plan or concert, yet accustomed\nto gain in the market of Acapulco, notwithstanding so many impediments\nand the exorbitant premiums paid for the money lent, these merchants\nfollow the strange maxim of risking little or no property of their\nown; and unaware, or rather, disregarding the importance of economy\nin the expenses and regularity of their general method of living,\nit is not possible they can ever accumulate large fortunes, or form\nsolid and well-accredited houses.",
        "[Merchants discouraged.] Thus oppressed by a system, as unjust as it\nis absurd, and conducting their affairs in the way above described,\nit is not strange that these gentlemen, at the same time yielding to\nthe indolence consequent on the climate, should neglect or behold with\nindifference all the other secondary resources which the supplying\nthe wants of the country and the extensive scope and variety of its\nproduce offer to the man of active mind. Hence it follows, as already\nobserved, that the whole of the interior trade is at present absorbed\nby the principal natives, the Sangley mestizos of both sexes, and a\nfew Chinese peddlers.",
        "[The outlook brightening.] Notwithstanding, however, the defective\nmanner in which the generality of the merchants act, some already\nare beginning to distinguish themselves by the prudence of their\nconduct, by forwarding, in time, their orders to the manufacturers\nof India and China, and, in other respects guiding themselves by the\nprinciples which characterize the intelligent merchant. Finally, it\nis to be presumed that, as soon as the government shall have thrown\ndown this singular and preposterous system that has been the cause of\nso many disorders, and proclaimed the unlimited freedom of Philippine\ncommerce, the greater part of these people will rise up from the state\nof inaction in which they now live, and the relations of the colony\nwill then assume the course and extent corresponding to its advantages\nof position. At least, if our national merchants should not act up\nto the impulse given to all kinds of mercantile enterprises by the\nbeneficial hand of the sovereign, foreigners will not be wanting, who,\nrelying on due toleration, will be induced to convey their fortunes\nand families to the Philippine Islands, and, vigorously encouraging\nthe exportation of their valuable productions, amply secure the fruits\nof their laudable activity and well-combined speculations.",
        "[Capital employed in commerce.] Were a person, judging from the\nnumbers constituting the body of registered merchants, and supposing\nall of them to possess the essential requisites prescribed by our\ncommercial regulations, to form a prudent estimate of the amount of\ncapital employed by them, his calculations would turn out extremely\nerroneous, for besides the case with which regulations of this kind\nare eluded, many are merely nominal traders, and there are others whose\nmercantile existence is purely artificial for they are sustained in a\ntemporary manner, by means of a forced species of circulation peculiar\nto this country. This consists in obtaining the acquiescence of the\nadministrators of pious and charitable funds, let out at interest,\nto renew the bonds they hold during other successive risks, waiting,\nas it were, till some fatal tempest has swallowed up the vessel in\nwhich these merchants suppose their property to be embarked, and\nat once cancel all their obligations. On the other hand, neither\nexcessive expenses nor the shipment of large quantities of goods to\nAcapulco can in any way be taken as a just criterion whereby to judge\nof the fortunes of individuals; because, in the first, there is great\nuniformity, every one, more or less, enjoying, exteriorly, the same\neasy circumstances, notwithstanding the disparity of real property;\nand in the second, considerable fiction prevails, many persons\nshipping under the same mark, and even when the shipper stands alone,\nhe might have been provided with the necessary funds from the pious\nand charitable establishments, possibly without risking a dollar\nof his own in the whole operation. Under circumstances so dubious,\nfar from presuming to give a decided opinion on the subject, I am\ncompelled to judge from mere conjectures, and guided only by the\nknowledge and experience I have been able to acquire during my long\nresidence there. In conformity thereto, I am inclined to believe,\nthat the total amount of capital belonging to and employed in the\ntrade of the Philippine Islands, does not at present exceed two\nand a half million dollars, with evident signs of rapid decline, if\nthe merchants do not in time abandon the ruinous systems of chiefly\ncarrying on their speculations with money obtained at interest.",
        "[Large sums hoarded.] The two and a half million dollars thus\nattributed to the merchants, form, however, the smaller part of the\nfunds distributed among the other classes, and the total amount of\nthe circulating medium of the colony might be considered an object\nsufficiently worthy of being ascertained, owing to the great light\nit would throw on the present state of the inhabitants; but it is in\nvain to attempt any calculation of the kind, at least without the aid\nof data possessing a certain degree of accuracy. The only thing that\ncan be affirmed is, that during the period of more than two hundred\nand fifty years which have elapsed since the conquest, the ingress of\nspecie into the Philippine Islands has been constant. Their annual\nships have seldom come from New Spain without bringing considerable\nsums in return, and if some of them have been lost, many others,\nwithout being confined to the one million of dollars constituting\nthe ordinary amount of the permit, have not unfrequently come back\nwith triple that sum; for which reason there are ample grounds of\njudging the estimates correct, which fix the total importation of\ndollars, during the whole of that long period of years, to be equal\nto four hundred millions. It may further be observed that, as in\nthe Sangley mestizos economy and avarice compete with intelligence\nand activity in accumulating wealth and as they are scattered, among\nthe principal islands, and in possession of the best lands and the\nmost lucrative business of the interior, there are ample motives for\npresuming that these industrious and sagacious people have gradually,\nalthough incessantly, amassed immense sums in specie; but it would\nbe impossible to point out their amount, distribution, or the secret\nplaces in which they are hoarded.",
        "[Pious and charitable funds’ capital.] The assemblage of pious\nlegacies, temporalities, and other funds and property placed under\nthe care of several administrative committees, for purposes as well\nreligious as charitable, constitute the chief capital employed in\nexternal trade; and notwithstanding the failures, which from time\nto time occur, the subsequent accumulation of the enormous premiums\nobtained for funds laid out in maritime speculations, both in time of\npeace and war, not only suffices to make up all losses of the above\nkind, but also to secure the punctual payment of such charitable\npensions and other charges as are to be deducted from the respective\nprofits of this species of stock, its total amount, according to an\nofficial report made by order of the head committee of the sinking\nfund, including temporalities, and Queen Maria of Austria’s endowment\nfor the College of Las Marianas, together with other funds of the same\nkind, not comprehended in the decree of abolition, at the commencement\nof the year 1809, amounted to $2,470,390, and as the sea-risks of that\nand the following year were successful, and the outstanding amounts\npunctually recovered, the aggregate sum, arising out of the above\ndescription of property, may now be estimated at more than three\nmillions. Of these funds three distributions are generally made,\nviz., one part is appropriated to the China risks, at from twelve\nto eighteen per cent. premium, according to circumstances, and also\nthose to Madras, Calcutta and Batavia, at from sixteen to twenty-two\nper cent. The second, which generally is in the largest proportion,\nis employed in risks to Acapulco, at various premiums, from 27 to 45\nper cent.; and the third is left in hand, as a kind of guarantee of\nthe stability of the original endowments.",
        "[Coveted by Spanish treasury.] In the great exigencies of the Royal\nTreasury, experienced during the last years of the administration\nof Sr. Soler, the royal decree of Consolidación was extended to the\nPhilippine Islands, under the pretext of guarding the funds belonging\nto public charities and religious endowments ... sea-risks, the\nincome of which, when secured on good mortgages, does not generally\nexceed five per cent, many in Spain not yielding above four; but the\nremarkable difference between this plan and the one above described,\ntogether with various and other weighty reasons alleged by the\nadministrators, caused the dreaded effect of this new regulation to\nbe suspended, and whilst the head committee of Manila were consulting\ntheir doubts and requesting fresh instructions from the court at home,\norders came out not to make any alteration in measures relating to\nthis description of property.",
        "[Easy capital but lessened profits.] Accustomed, in their limited\ncalculations, to identify the resources, offered by the funds belonging\nto this class of establishments, with the very existence of the\ncolony, the needy merchants easily confound their personal with the\ngeneral interest; and few stop to consider that the identical means\nof carrying on trade, without any capital of their own, although they\nhave accidentally enriched a small number of persons, eventually have\nabsorbed the principal profits, and possibly been the chief cause\nof the unflourishing state of the colony at large. Without fearing\nthe charge of rashness, it may, in fact, be asserted, that if these\ncharities and pious endowments had never existed, public prosperity\nin the Philippine Islands would, as in other parts, have been the\nimmediate effect of the united efforts of the individual members\nof the community and of the experience acquired in the constant\nprosecution of the same object. As, however, a progress of this kind,\nalthough certain, must necessarily have been at first extremely\nslow, and as, on the other hand, the preference given to mercantile\noperations undertaken with the funds belonging to public charities,\nhas its origin in the assemblage of vices so remarkable in the very\norganization of the body of Philippine merchants, any new measure on\nthis subject might be deemed inconsistent, that at once deprived them\nof the use of resources on which they had been accustomed to rely,\nwithout removing those other defects which excuse, if not encourage,\nthe continuation of the present system. Without, therefore, appealing\nto violent remedies, it is to be hoped that, in order to render plans\nof reform effectual, it will be sufficient, under more propitious\ncircumstances, to see property brought from other countries to these\nIslands, as well as persons coming to settle in them, capable of\nmanaging it with that intelligence and economy required by trade. The\ncompetition of those who speculate at random would then cease, or\nwhat is the same, as money obtained at a premium could not then be\nlaid out with the same advantages by the merchants as if it was their\nown, it will be necessary to renounce the fallacious profits held out\nby the public charities, till at least they are placed on a level\nwith existing circumstances, and brought in to be of real service\nto the honorable planter and laborious merchant, in their accidental\nexigencies, ceasing to be, as hitherto, the indirect cause of idleness,\ndissipation, and the ruin of an infinite number of families.",
        "[Mercantile shipping.] The vessels which the district magistrates of\nthe provinces employ in carrying on their trade with the capital and\nthose belonging to some of the richer merchants, together with such as\nare owned by the natives and mestizos, on an approximate calculation,\namount to twelve thousand tons, including ships, brigs, schooners,\ngalleys, barges, etc. For the want of better data, this estimate\nis founded only on reasonable conjecture, aided by the advice of\nexperienced persons, for although the greatest part of these vessels\nare built by the natives in the neighborhood of their own towns, no\nregister is kept of their number and dimensions, nor do they carry\nwith them the usual certificates. Those belonging to the merchants,\nthat is, ships and brigs of a certain size, have already begun to\nfrequent the ports of China, Java, the coast of Coromandel, Bengal,\nand the Isle of France, availing themselves of the lucrative freights\nwhich formerly enriched and encouraged foreign shipping. The other\nclass of vessels, although perfectly adequate to the coasting trade,\ncannot in general be applied to larger enterprises, on account of\ntheir not being sufficiently strong and capacious. The seamen are\nnot apprenticed, or as it is usually called, matriculated, but\ntheir frequent crossing from island to island, their familiarity\nwith regional tempests, voyages to various parts of America, and\nthe occupation of fishing followed by the inhabitants of the coast,\nserve to train up a large body of dexterous and able mariners who at\nall times can be had, without any compulsion, to complete the crews.",
        "[Need of nautical school.] The want of a public school for the\nteaching of navigation, is, however, sensibly felt, as well as great\ninconvenience from the scarcity of persons capable of being trusted\nwith the command of vessels, and the ignorance that prevails of the\nwaters of this dangerous Archipelago. Repeated royal orders have\nbeen sent over for the board of trade to proceed to the institution\nof so useful an establishment, and in the meantime, a medium has\nbeen resorted to in order to supply the deficiency, by allowing\nthe free admission of foreign mates, provided they exhibit proofs\nof their acquaintance with navigation, and profess the Catholic\nworship. Shipowners nevertheless experience great difficulties,\nparticularly at times when the Acapulco ship is fitting out, for\nalthough she is considered as a vessel of war, and commanded by\nofficers of the royal navy, the plan of her equipment is so singular,\nthat in addition, she requires the extra aid of one chief mate,\nand three under ones.",
        "[Royal Phillipine company.] The various modifications this corporate\nbody has successively experienced, have, in great measure, changed\nthe essence of its original constitution, and the remonstrances of\nits directors, founded on the experience of a long series of years, at\nlength induced the government at home to sanction alterations dictated\nby existing circumstances. The project of raising these Islands\nfrom the neglected state in which they were, and in some measure to\nplace them in contact with the mother country, accompanied by a wish\nto give a new and great impulse to the various branches of industry\nwhich constitute the importance of a colony, could not have been more\nlaudable; but, as was afterwards seen, the instrument employed was\nnot adequate to the object in view. At the same time that the company\nwere charged to promote, and, by means of their funds, to vivify the\nagriculture and industry of these provinces, the necessary powers\nand facilities to enable them to reap the fruits of their sacrifices\nwere withheld. The protection granted to this establishment, did not\ngo beyond a general recommendation in favor of its enterprises, and,\nin short, far from enjoying the exclusive preponderance obtained at\ntheir commencement by all the other Asiatic companies, that of the\nPhilippine Islands labored under particular disadvantages.",
        "[Local progress under adverse conditions.] Notwithstanding an\norganization so imperfect, scarcely had the agents of the new\nCompany arrived at Manila, when they distributed through the country\ntheir numerous dependents, commissioned to encourage the natives\nby advances of money. They established subaltern factories in the\nProvinces of Ilocos, Bataan, Cavite, and Camarines; purchased lands;\ndelivered out agricultural implements; founded manufacturies of cotton\ncloths; contracted for the crops of produce at very high prices;\noffered rewards and, in short, they put in motion every partial\nresources they were able to avail themselves of and their limited\nmeans allowed. It would be extremely easy for me, in this place,\nto enter a particular enumeration of the important services of this\nkind rendered by the company, and to exhibit, in the most evident\npoint of view, the advantages thence derived to these Islands,\nif, besides being slightly touched upon in the preceding articles,\nthis task had not been already ably performed by the Factor Don Juan\nFrancisco Urroz, in his accurate report on this subject, addressed\nto the governing committee of the company, in 1803. In justice I will\nnevertheless observe, that this establishment, anxiously resolved to\nattain the end proposed, in spite of so many obstacles, constantly\nfollowed up its expensive system without being disheartened; nor\ndid the contrarieties with which the Royal Audiencia, or High Court\nof Justice, frequently paralyzed its plans, the indifference of the\ngovernors, or the general opposition and jealousy of the other classes,\nin any way tend to relax its efforts, till at length, convinced of\nthe impossibility of successfully contending, alone and without any\nother arms than its own reduced capital; and, on the other hand,\nwell aware that a political body of this kind in vain seeks to unite\nwithin itself the triple and opposite characters of agriculturalist,\nmanufaturer, and merchant, a determination was taken to alter the\nplan, and withdraw the factories established in the provinces, and\nby adopting a rigid economy and confining the operations in future\nto the purchase of such produce and manufactured articles as suited\ntheir trade, and were voluntarily brought by the natives to their\nstores, the expenses of the Company were curtailed, and a plan of\nreform introduced into all their speculations. By this means also\nthey always secured an advantageous vent for the productions of the\ncountry, after having been the chief spring by which agriculture was\npromoted and encouraged in a direct manner.",
        "[Handicapped in outside trade] The most beneficial reform, however,\nintroduced by this establishment into its system, has, in reality,\nbeen derived from the variation or rather correction of its plans and\nenterprises, purely maritime. The government being desirous to increase\nthe relations of this colony by every possible means, and to convert it\ninto a common center of all the operations of the new company, at first\nrequired of the agents that the purchases and collection of goods from\nthe coast of Coromandel, Bengal, and China, destined for Spain, should\ntake place at Manila, either by purchasing the articles in that market,\nor through the medium of previous contracts to deliver them there. From\nthis it is easy to infer, that the company was infallibly exposed to\nthe harsh terms the respective contractors sought to impose upon them,\nas well with regard to prices as qualities, unless, in many cases,\nthey preferred being left without the necessary assortments. Hence may\nit, without the smallest exaggeration, be affirmed, that, summing up\nall the surcharges under which the shipments left the port of Manila,\nand comparing them with those which might have been sent direct from\nthe above-mentioned points, and without so extraordinary a détour\nas the one prescribed by law, the difference that followed in the\nprime cost of the cargos was not less than 80 per cent. The urgent\nmanner, however, in which the directors of the company did not\ncease to deplore and complain of so evident a hardship, at length\nhad the desired effect, and after existing ten or twelve years, so\npreposterous a system was successfully overthrown, and permission\nobtained from the king for the establishment of Spanish factories in\nthe neighborhood of the China and India manufactures, as well as the\npower of addressing shipments direct to those foreign dominions. The\nenlightened policy of their respective governments did not allow them\nto hesitate in giving a favorable reception to our factors and vessels,\nand the purchases and shipments of Asiatic goods being thus realized\nwithout the old obstructions, the Company was reasonably led to hope\nbeing able soon to increase its operations, and progressively present\nmore satisfactory results to the shareholders, when those political\nconvulsions succeeding soon after, which have unhinged or destroyed\nall the ordinary relations of trade, compelled them to abandon their\nhopes, till the wished-for calm should be again restored.",
        "[Temporary expedient of 1803.] In consequence of the new character\nand route given to the commercial enterprises of the Company, as\nauthorized by a royal decree of July 12, 1803, the functions of\nthe Manila factors were reduced to the annual shipment of a cargo\nof Asiatic goods to Peru, valued at $500,000, but only as long\nas the war lasted, and till the expiration of the extraordinary\npermits granted through the goodness of the king, and also to the\ntransmitting to China and Bengal of the specie brought from America,\nand the collecting of certain quantities of indigo, sugar, or other\nproduce of the Islands, with a view to gain by reselling it in the\nsame market. Consequently, the moment things return to their pacific\nand ordinary course, will be the period when the necessity of the\nfuture existence of this establishment will cease, or at least,\nwhen the propriety will be evident of its reform or assimilation to\nthe other commission houses, carrying on trade in Vera Cruz, Mexico,\netc., which, not being hired establishments, do not create expenses\nwhen they cease to transact business.",
