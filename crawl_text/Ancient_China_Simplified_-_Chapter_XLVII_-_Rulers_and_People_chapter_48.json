        "A feature of the times was the remarkably personal character of\nthe wars, and the apparent utter indifference to humble popular\ninterests; Quidquid delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi; stress\nis laid upon this point by the democratic philosopher Lao-tsz, who,\nhowever, in his book (be it genuine or not), is wise enough never\nto name a person or place; probably that prudence saved it from\nthe flames in 213 B.C.",
        "In 684 B.C. the ruler of Ts’ai (imperial clan) treated very rudely\nhis own wife’s sister, married to a petty prince (imperial clan)\nclose by; the sister was simply passing through as a traveller;\nthe result was that this petty prince, her husband, induced Ts’u\nto make war upon Ts’ai, whose reigning prince was captured, and\ndied a prisoner. In 657 the ruler of Ts’ai had a sister\nmarried in Ts’i. The First Protector, offended at some act of\nplayful disobedience, sent her back, but without actually\ndivorcing her. Her brother was so angry that he found her another\nhusband. On this Ts’i declared war, and captured the brother, who,\nhowever, at the intercession of the other vassal princes, was\nrestored to his kingdom. In 509 and 506 B.C. Ts’ai induces Tsin to\nmake war on Ts’u, and also assists Wu in her hostilities against\nTs’u, because a Ts’u minister had detained the ruler of Ts’ai for\nrefusing to part with a handsome fur coat. It is like the stealing\nof the Golden Fleece by Jason, and similar Greek squabbles. In 675\nB.C. the Emperor, for the third time, had to fly from his capital,\nthe immediate cause of the trouble being an attempt on his part to\nseize a vassal’s rice-field for including in his own park–a\nChinese version of the Naboth’s vineyard dispute. Nothing could\nbetter prove the pettiness of the ancient state-horizon; no busily\nactive great power could find time for such trifles.",
        "When the Second Protector came to the throne, the orthodox states\nof Wei, Ts’ao, and Cheng (all of the imperial clan), which had\ntreated him scurvily as a wanderer, had all three of them to pay\ndearly for their meanness. In 632, when the Protector had secured\nthe Tsin throne, the ruler of Ts’ao was promptly captured, and\npart of his territory was given to Sung (where the wanderer had\nbeen well treated). The same year Tsin wished to assist Sung, and\naccordingly asked right of way through the state of Wei, which was\ncurtly refused; the Tsin army therefore crossed the Yellow River\nto the south of Wei: as a punishment for this refusal, and also\nfor the previous rude treatment, Wei also had to give part of her\nterritory to the favoured Sung. In 630 Tsin induced Ts’in to join\nin an attack upon Cheng, the object being, of course, to revenge\nsimilar personal rudenesses; however, Cheng diplomacy was\nsuccessful in inducing Ts’in to abandon Tsin in the nick of time:\nthis was one of the very few cases in which Ts’in interfered, or\nwas about to interfere, in “orthodox” affairs. In 592 Tsin sent a\nhunchback envoy to Ts’i; it so happened that at the same time Lu\nsent one who was lame, and Wei a third who was blind of one eye.\nThe Ts’i ruler thereupon appointed an officer mutilated in some\nother way to do the duties of host to this sorry trio. The Tsin\nenvoy swore: “If I do not revenge this upon Ts’i, may the God of\nthe Yellow River take note of it!” Reaching his own country, he\ntried to induce the ruler to make war on Ts’i; but the prince\nsaid: “Your personal pique should hardly suffice for ground to\ntrouble the whole country”: and he refused.",
        "The principle of the divinity that doth hedge a king was early\nestablished, but there are certainly more numerous evidences of\nroyal absolutism in Ts’u than in orthodox China, where responsibility\nof rulers before Heaven and the People (symbolical of Heaven also)\nwas an accepted axiom. For instance, in 522 B.C., an officer, knowing\nthat the King of Ts’u was sending for him in order to kill him, said to his\nbrother: “As the king orders it, one of us two must go, but you can\navenge me later on.” When the next Ts’u king was a fugitive, and it\nwas a question in a subject’s mind of killing him because his father\nhad taken a brother’s life, it was objected: “No! if the king slays one\nof his officers, who can avenge it? His commands emanate from Heaven.\nIt is unpardonable to cut off the ancestral sacrifice of a whole house\nin this way.”",
        "In still more ancient times, when the last Emperor of the Shang\ndynasty was being warned of the rising popular feeling in favour\nof the rising Chou power, he remarked: “Have I not Heaven’s\nmandate? What can they do to me?” When the Martial King achieved\nhis conquest, he smeared the god of the soil with the sacrificial\nvictims’ blood, and announced the crimes of the dead tyrant to\nHeaven. In the war of 589 between Tsin and Ts’i, the ruler of\nTs’i, who had changed places with his charioteer in order to\nescape detection, was hotly pursued; but his chariot caught in a\ntree. Seeing this, the Tsin captain prostrated himself before the\nchariot, and said: “My princely master’s orders are to assist the\nstates of Lu and Wei” (i.e. not to attack your person). Meanwhile\nthe disguised charioteer ordered the disguised king to fetch a\ndrink of water, and the king thus escaped even the humiliation of\na favour from his generous victor. When in 548 a worthless Ts’i\nruler was assassinated, the philosopher Yen-tsz said: “When the\nruler dies or is exiled for the gods of the land and its harvests,\none dies or is exiled with him; but if he dies or is exiled for\nprivate reasons, then only his personal friends die with him.” He\ntherefore contented himself with wailing, and with laying his head\non the royal body. The same Tsin captain who was so tender to the\nTs’i duke in 589 had an opportunity fourteen years later of taking\nprisoner the ruler of CHENG in battle; but he said: “Evil cometh\nto him who toucheth a crowned head! I have already committed\nsacrilege once against the ruler of Ts’i; preserve me from\ncommitting this crime a second time!” And he turned promptly back.\nDuring the same fight, the King of Ts’u’s body-guard was attacked\nby the Tsin generalissimo, who, when he discerned the king in the\ncentre of the guards, got out of his chariot, doffed his helmet,\nand fled in horror, “such was his respect for the person of\nroyalty.” It was a ritual rule in China for the distinguished men\nnot to remove the official head-covering in death; for instance,\nin 481, when one of Confucius’ pupils was killed in war, his last\npatriotic act was to tie his hat-strings tighter. Though rulers\nwere supposed to owe duties to the gods in general, yet the power\nof the gods was limited. Thus when Tsz-ch’an of CHENG was sent as\nenvoy to Tsin in 541, the sick Tsin ruler asked him: “How can the\ntwo gods who, they say, are responsible for my malady, be\nconjured?” Tsz-ch’an replied: “These particular gods cannot injure\nyou; we sacrifice to them in connection with natural phenomena,\nsuch as drought, flood, or other disaster; just as in matters of\nsnow, hail, rain, or wind we sacrifice to the gods of the sun,\nmoon, planets, and constellations. Your illness is the result of\ndrink, over-feeding, women, passionate anger, excessive pleasure.\"\nShuh Hiang approved this common-sense view of the situation.",
