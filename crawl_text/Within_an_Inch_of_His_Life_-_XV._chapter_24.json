        "During all this time, they were suffering intense anxiety at M. de\nChandore’s house. Ever since eight o’clock in the morning the two\naunts, the old gentleman, the marchioness, and M. Folgat had been\nassembled in the dining-room, and were there waiting for the result of\nthe interview. Dionysia had only come down later; and her grandfather\ncould not help noticing that she had dressed more carefully than\nusual.",
        "“Are we not going to see Jacques again?” she replied with a smile full\nof confidence and joy.",
        "She had actually persuaded herself that one word from Jacques would\nsuffice to convince the celebrated lawyer, and that he would reappear\ntriumphant on M. Magloire’s arm. The others did not share these\nexpectations. The two aunts, looking as yellow as their old laces, sat\nimmovable in a corner. The marchioness was trying to hide her tears;\nand M. Folgat endeavored to look absorbed in a volume of engravings.\nM. de Chandore, who possessed less self-control, walked up and down in\nthe room, repeating every ten minutes,–",
        "“It is wonderful how long time seems when you are waiting!”",
        "At ten o’clock no news had come.",
        "“Could M. Magloire have forgotten his promise?” said Dionysia,\nbecoming anxious.",
        "“No, he has not forgotten it,” replied a newcomer, M. Seneschal. It\nwas really the excellent mayor, who had met M. Magloire about an hour\nbefore, and who now came to hear the news, for his own sake, as he\nsaid, but especially for his wife’s sake, who was actually ill with\nanxiety.",
        "Eleven o’clock, and no news. The marchioness got up, and said,–",
        "“I cannot stand this uncertainty a minute longer. I am going to the\nprison.”",
        "“And I will go with you, dear mother,” declared Dionysia.",
        "But such a proceeding was hardly suitable. M. de Chandore opposed it,\nand was supported by M. Folgat, as well as by M. Seneschal.",
        "“We might at least send somebody,” suggested the two aunts timidly.",
        "“That is a good idea,” replied M. de Chandore.",
        "He rang the bell; and old Anthony came in. He had established himself\nthe evening before in Sauveterre, having heard that the preliminary\ninvestigation was finished.",
        "As soon as he had been told what they wanted him to do, he said,–",
        "“I shall be back in half an hour.”",
        "He nearly ran down the steep street, hastened along National Street,\nand then climbed up more slowly Castle Street. When M. Blangin, the\nkeeper, saw him appear, he turned very pale; for M. Blangin had not\nslept since Dionysia had given him the seventeen thousand francs. He,\nonce upon a time the special friend of all gendarmes, now trembled\nwhen one of them entered the jail. Not that he felt any remorse about\nhaving betrayed his duty; oh, no! but he feared discovery.",
        "More than ten times he had changed the hiding-place of his precious\nstocking; but, wherever he put it, he always fancied that the eyes of\nhis visitors were riveted upon that very spot. He recovered, however,\nfrom his fright when Anthony told him his errand, and replied in the\nmost civil manner,–",
        "“M. Magloire came here at nine o’clock precisely. I took him\nimmediately to M. de Boiscoran’s cell; and ever since they have been\ntalking, talking.”",
        "“Are you quite sure?”",
        "“Of course I am. Must I not know every thing that happens in my jail?\nI went and listened. You can hear nothing from the passage: they have\nshut the wicket, and the door is massive.”",
        "“That is strange,” murmured the old servant.",
        "“Yes, and a bad sign,” declared the keeper with a knowing air. “I have\nnoticed that the prisoners who take so long to state their case to\ntheir advocate always catch the maximum of punishment.”",
        "Anthony, of course, did not report to his masters the jailer’s\nmournful anticipations; but what he told them about the length of the\ninterview did not tend to relieve their anxiety.",
        "Gradually the color had faded from Dionysia’s cheeks; and the clear\nring of her voice was half drowned in tears, when she said, that it\nwould have been better, perhaps, if she had put on mourning, and that\nseeing the whole family assembled thus reminded her of a funeral.",
        "The sudden arrival of Dr. Seignebos cut short her remarks. He was in a\ngreat passion, as usual; and as soon as he entered, he cried,–",
        "“What a stupid town Sauveterre is! Nothing but gossip and idle\nreports! The people are all of them old women. I feel like running\naway, and hiding myself. On my way here, twenty curious people have\nstopped me to ask me what M. de Boiscoran is going to do now. For the\ntown is full of rumors. They know that Magloire is at the jail now;\nand everybody wants to be the first to hear Jacques’s story.”",
        "He had put his immense broad brimmed hat on the table, and, looking\naround the room at all the sad faces he asked,–",
        "“And you have no news yet?”",
        "“Nothing,” replied M. Seneschal and M. Folgat at the same breath.",
        "“And we are frightened by this delay,” added Dionysia.",
        "“And why?” asked the physician.",
        "Then taking down his spectacles, and wiping them diligently, he\nsaid,–",
        "“Did you think, my dear young lady, that Jacques de Boiscoran’s affair\ncould be settled in five minutes? If they let you believe that, they\ndid wrong. I, who despise all concealment, I will tell you the truth.\nAt the bottom of all these occurrences at Valpinson, there lies, I am\nperfectly sure, some dark intrigue. Most assuredly we shall put\nJacques out of his trouble; but I fear it will be hard work.”",
        "“M. Magloire!” announced old Anthony.",
        "The eminent advocate of Sauveterre entered. He looked so undone, and\nbore so evidently the traces of his excitement, that all had the same\nterrible thought which Dionysia expressed.",
        "“Jacques is lost!”",
        "M. Magloire did not say no.",
        "“I believe he is in danger.”",
        "“Jacques,” murmured the old marchioness,–\"my son!”",
        "“I said in danger,” repeated the advocate; “but I ought to have said,\nhe is in a strange, almost incredible, unnatural position.”",
        "“Let us hear,” said the marchioness.",
        "The lawyer was evidently very much embarrassed; and he looked with\nunmistakable distress, first at Dionysia, and then at the two old\naunts. But nobody noticed this, and so he said,–",
        "“I must ask to be left alone with these gentlemen.”",
        "In the most docile manner the Misses Lavarande rose, and took their\nniece and Jacques’s mother with them: the latter was evidently near\nfainting. As soon as the door was shut, Grandpapa Chandore, half mad\nwith grief, exclaimed,–",
        "“Thanks, M. Magloire, thanks for having given me time to prepare my\npoor child for the terrible blow. I see but too well what you are\ngoing to say. Jacques is guilty.”",
        "“Stop,” said the advocate: “I have said nothing of the kind. M. de\nBoiscoran still protests energetically that he is innocent; but he\nstates in his defence a fact which is so entirely improbable, so\nutterly inadmissible\"–",
        "“But what does he say?” asked M. Seneschal.",
        "“He says that the Countess Claudieuse has been his mistress.”",
        "Dr. Seignebos started, and, readjusting his spectacles, he cried\ntriumphantly,–",
        "“I said so! I have guessed it!”",
        "M. Folgat had, on this occasion, very naturally, no deliberative\nvoice. He came from Paris, with Paris ideas; and, whatever he might\nhave been told, the name of the Countess Claudieuse revealed to him\nnothing. But, from the effect which it produced upon the others, he\ncould judge what Jacques’s accusation meant. Far from being of the\ndoctor’s opinion M. de Chandore and M. Seneschal both seemed to be as\nmuch shocked as M. Magloire.",
        "“That is incredible,” said one.",
        "“That is impossible,” added the other.",
        "M. Magloire shook his head, and said,–",
        "“That is exactly what I told Jacques.”",
        "But the doctor was not the man to be surprised at what public opinion\nsaid, much less to fear it. He exclaimed,–",
        "“Don’t you hear what I say? Don’t you understand me? The proof that\nthe thing is neither so incredible nor so impossible is, that I had\nsuspected it. And there were signs of it, I should think. Why on earth\nshould a man like Jacques, young, rich, well made, in love with a\ncharming girl, and beloved by her, why should he amuse himself with\nsetting houses on fire, and killing people? You tell me he did not\nlike Count Claudieuse. Upon my word! If everybody who does not like\nDr. Seignebos were to come and fire at him forthwith, do you know my\nbody would look like a sieve! Among you all, M. Folgat is the only one\nwho has not been struck with blindness.”",
        "The young lawyer tried modestly to protest.",
        "“Sir\"–",
        "But the other cut him short, and went on,–",
        "“Yes, sir, you saw it all; and the proof of it is, that you at once\nwent to work in search of the real motive, the heart,–in fine, the\nwoman at the bottom of the riddle. The proof of it is, that you went\nand asked everybody,–Anthony, M. de Chandore, M. Seneschal, and\nmyself,–if M. de Boiscoran had not now, or had not had, some love-\naffair in the country. They all said No, being far from suspecting the\ntruth. I alone, without giving you a positive answer, told you that I\nthought as you did, and told you so in M. de Chandore’s presence.”",
        "“That is so!” replied the old gentleman and M. Folgat.",
        "Dr. Seignebos was triumphant. Gesticulating, and continually handling\nhis spectacles, he added,–",
        "“You see I have learnt to mistrust appearances; and hence I had my\nmisgivings from the beginning. I watched the Countess Claudieuse the\nnight of the fire; and I saw that she looked embarrassed, troubled,\nsuspicious. I wondered at her readiness to yield to M. Galpin’s whim,\nand to allow Cocoleu to be examined; for I knew that she was the only\none who could ever make that so-called idiot talk. You see I have good\neyes, gentlemen, in spite of my spectacles. Well, I swear by all I\nhold most sacred, on my Republican faith, I am ready to affirm upon\noath, that, when Cocoleu uttered Jacques de Boiscoran’s name, the\ncountess exhibited no sign of surprise.”",
        "Never before, in their life, had the mayor of Sauveterre and Dr.\nSeignebos been able to agree on any subject. This question was not\nlikely to produce such an effect all of a sudden: hence M. Seneschal\nsaid,–",
        "“I was present at Cocoleu’s examination, and I noticed, on the\ncontrary, the amazement of the countess.”",
        "The doctor raised his shoulders, and said,–",
        "“Certainly she said, ’Ah!’ But that is no proof. I, also, could very\neasily say, ’Ah!’ if anybody should come and tell me that the mayor of\nSauveterre was in the wrong; and still I should not be surprised.”",
        "“Doctor!” said M. de Chandore, anxious to conciliate,–\"doctor!”",
        "But Dr. Seignebos had already turned to M. Magloire, whom he was\nanxious to convert, and went on,–",
        "“Yes, the face of the Countess Claudieuse, expressed amazement; but\nher eyes spoke of bitter, fierce hatred, of joy, and of vengeance. And\nthat is not all. Will you please tell me, Mr. Mayor, when Count\nClaudieuse was roused by the fire, was the countess by him? No, she\nwas nursing her youngest daughter, who had the measles. Hm! What do\nyou think of measles which make sitting up at night necessary? And\nwhen the two shots were fired, where was the countess then? Still with\nher daughter, and on the other side of the house from where the fire\nwas.”",
        "The mayor of Sauveterre was no less obstinate than the doctor. He at\nonce objected,–",
        "“I beg you will notice, doctor, that Count Claudieuse himself deposed\nhow, when he ran to the fire, he found the door shut from within, just\nas he had left it a few hours before.”",
        "Dr. Seignebos returned a most ironical bow, and then asked,–",
        "“Is there really only one door in the chateau at Valpinson?”",
        "“To my knowledge,” said M. de Chandore, “there are at least three.”",
        "“And I must say,” added M. Magloire, “that according to M. de\nBoiscoran’s statement, the countess, on that evening, had gone out by\nthe laundry-door when she came to meet him.”",
        "“What did I say?” exclaimed the doctor.",
        "And, wiping his glasses in a perfect rage, he added,–",
        "“And the children! Does Mr. Mayor think it natural that the Countess\nClaudieuse, this incomparable mother in his estimation, should forget\nher children in the height of the fire?”",
        "“What! The poor woman is called out by the discharge of fire-arms; she\nsees her house on fire; she stumbles over the lifeless body of her\nhusband: and you blame her for not having preserved all her presence\nof mind.”",
        "“That is one view of it; but it is not the one I take. I rather think\nthat the countess, having been delayed out of doors, was prevented by\nthe fire from getting in again. I think, also, that Cocoleu came very\nopportunely; and that it was very lucky Providence should inspire his\nmind with that sublime idea of saving the children at the risk of his\nlife.”",
        "This time M. Seneschal made no reply.",
        "“Supported by all these facts,” continued the doctor, “my suspicions\nbecame so strong that I determined to ascertain the truth, if I could.\nThe next day I questioned the countess, and, I must confess, rather\ntreacherously. Her replies and her looks were not such as to modify my\nviews. When I asked her, looking straight into her eyes, what she\nthought of Cocoleu’s mental condition, she nearly fainted; and she\ncould hardly make me hear her when she said that she occasionally\ncaught glimpses of intelligence in him. When I asked her if Cocoleu\nwas fond of her, she said, in a most embarrassed manner, that his\ndevotion was that of an animal which is grateful for the care taken of\nhim. What do you think of that, gentlemen? To me it appeared that\nCocoleu was at the bottom of the whole affair; that he knew the truth;\nand that I should be able to save Jacques, if I could prove Cocoleu’s\nimbecility to be assumed, and his speechlessness to be an imposture.\nAnd I would have proved it, if they had associated with me any one\nelse but this ass and this jackanapes from Paris.”",
        "He paused for a few seconds; but, without giving anybody time to\nreply, he went on,–",
        "“Now, let us go back to our point of departure, and draw our\nconclusions. Why do you think it so improbable and impossible that the\ncountess Claudieuse should have betrayed her duties? Because she has a\nworld-wide reputation for purity and prudence. Well. But was not\nJacques de Boiscoran’s reputation as a man of honor also above all\ndoubt? According to your views, it is absurd to suspect the countess\nof having had a lover. According to my notions, it is absurd that\nJacques should, overnight, have become a scoundrel.”",
        "“Oh! that is not the same thing,” said M. Seneschal.",
        "“Certainly not!” replied the doctor; “and there you are right, for\nonce. If M. de Boiscoran had committed this crime, it would be one of\nthose absurd crimes which are revolting to us; but, if committed by\nthe countess, it is only the catastrophe prepared by Count Claudieuse\non the day when he married a woman thirty years younger than he was.”",
        "The great wrath of Dr. Seignebos was not always as formidable as it\nlooked. Even when he appeared to be almost beside himself, he never\nsaid more than he intended to say, possessed as he was of that\nadmirable southern quality, which enabled him to pour forth fire and\nflames, and to remain as cold as ice within, But in this case he\nshowed what he thought fully. He had said quite enough, too, and had\npresented the whole affair under such a new aspect, that his friends\nbecame very thoughtful.",
        "“You would have converted me, doctor,” said M. Folgat, “if I had not\nbeen of your opinion before.”",
        "“I am sure,” added M. de Chandore, after hearing the doctor, “the\nthing no longer looks impossible.”",
        "“Nothing is impossible,” said M. Seneschal, like a philosopher.",
        "The eminent advocate of Sauveterre alone remained unmoved.",
        "“Well,” said he, “I had rather admit one hour of utter insanity even\nthan five years of such monstrous hypocrisy. Jacques may have\ncommitted the crime, and be nothing but a madman; but, if the countess\nis guilty, one might despair of mankind, and renounce all faith in\nthis world. I have seen her, gentlemen, with her husband and her\nchildren. No one can feign such looks of tenderness and affection.”",
        "“He will never give her up!” growled Dr. Seignebos,–",
        "And touching his friend on the shoulder,–for M. Magloire had been his\nfriend for many years, and they were quite intimate,–he said,–",
        "“Ah! There I recognize my friend, the strange lawyer, who judges\nothers by himself, and refuses to believe any thing bad. Oh, do not\nprotest! For we love and honor you for that very faith, and are proud\nto see you among us Republicans. But I must confess you are not the\nman to bring light into such a dark intrigue. At twenty-eight you\nmarried a girl whom you loved dearly: you lost her, and ever since you\nhave remained faithful to her memory, and lived so far from all\npassions that you no longer believe in their existence. Happy man!\nYour heart is still at twenty; and with your grey hair you still\nbelieve in the smiles and looks of woman.”",
        "There was much truth in this; but there are certain truths which we\nare not overfond of hearing.",
        "“My simplicity has nothing to do with the matter,” said M. Magloire.\n“I affirm and maintain that a man who has been for five years the\nlover of a woman must have some proof of it.”",
        "“Well, there you are mistaken, master,” said the physician, arranging\nhis spectacles with an air of self-conceit, which, under other\ncircumstances, would have been irresistibly ludicrous.",
        "“When women determine to be prudent and suspicious,” remarked M. de\nChandore, “they never are so by halves.”",
        "“It is evident, besides,” added M. Folgat, “that the Countess\nClaudieuse would never have determined upon so bold a crime, if she\nhad not been quite sure, that after the burning of her letters, no\nproof could be brought against her.”",
        "“That is it!” cried the doctor.",
        "M. Magloire did not conceal his impatience. He said dryly,–",
        "“Unfortunately, gentlemen, it does not depend on you to acquit or\ncondemn M. de Boiscoran. I am not here to convince you, or to be\nconvinced: I came to discuss with M. de Boiscoran’s friends our line\nof conduct, and the basis of or defence.”",
        "And M. Magloire was evidently right in this estimate of his duty. He\nwent and leaned against the mantelpiece; and, when the others had\ntaken their seats around him, he began,–",
        "“In the first place, I will admit the allegations made by M. de\nBoiscoran. He is innocent. He has been the lover of Countess\nClaudieuse; but he has no proof. This being granted, what is to be\ndone? Shall I advise him to send for the magistrate, and to confess it\nall?”",
        "No one replied at first. It was only after a long silence that Dr.\nSeignebos said,–",
        "“That would be very serious.”",
        "“Very serious, indeed,” repeated the famous lawyer. “Our own feelings\ngive us the measure of what M. Galpin will think. First of all, he,\nalso, will ask for proof, the evidence of a witness, any thing, in\nfact. And, when Jacques tells him that he has nothing to give but his\nword, M. Galpin will tell him that he does not speak the truth.”",
        "“He might, perhaps, consent to extend the investigation,” said M.\nSeneschal. “He might possibly summon the countess.”",
        "M. Magloire nodded, and said,–",
        "“He would certainly summon her. But, then, would she confess? It would\nbe madness to expect that. If she is guilty, she is far too strong-\nminded to let the truth escape her. She would deny every thing,\nhaughtily, magnificently, and in such a manner as not to leave a\nshadow of doubt.”",
        "“That is only too probable,” growled the doctor. “That poor Galpin is\nnot the strongest of men.”",
        "“What would be the result of such a step?” asked M. Magloire. “M. de\nBoiscoran’s case would be a hundred times worse; for to his crime\nwould now be added the odium of the meanest, vilest calumny.”",
        "M. Folgat was following with the utmost attention. He said,–",
        "“I am very glad to hear my honorable colleague give utterance to that\nopinion. We must give up all hope of delaying the proceedings, and let\nM. de Boiscoran go into court at once.”",
        "M. de Chandore raised his hands to heaven, as if in sheer despair.",
        "“But Dionysia will die of grief and shame,” he exclaimed.",
        "M. Magloire, absorbed in his own views, went on,–",
        "“Well, here we are now before the court at Sauveterre, before a jury\ncomposed of people from this district, incapable of prevarication, I\nam sure, but, unfortunately, under the influence of that public\nopinion which has long since condemned M. de Boiscoran. The\nproceedings begin; the judge questions the accused. Will he say what\nhe told me,–that, after having been the lover of the Countess\nClaudieuse, he had gone to Valpinson to carry her back her letters,\nand to get his own, and that they are all burnt? Suppose he says so.\nImmediately then there will arise a storm of indignation; and he will\nbe overwhelmed with curses and with contempt. Well, thereupon, the\npresident of the court uses his discretionary powers, suspends the\ntrial, and sends for the Countess Claudieuse. Since we look upon her\nas guilty, we must needs endow her with supernatural energy. She had\nforeseen what is coming, and has read over her part. When summoned,\nshe appears, pale, dressed in black; and a murmur of respectful\nsympathy greets her at her entrance. You see her before you, don’t\nyou? The president explains to her why she has been sent for, and she\ndoes not comprehend. She cannot possibly comprehend such an abominable\ncalumny. But when she has comprehended it? Do you see the lofty look\nby which she crushes Jacques, and the grandeur with which she replies,\n’When this man had failed in trying to murder my husband, he tried to\ndisgrace his wife. I intrust to you my honor as a mother and a wife,\ngentlemen. I shall not answer the infamous charges of this abject\ncalumniator.’ “",
        "“But that means the galleys for Jacques,” exclaimed M. de Chandore,\n“or even the scaffold!”",
        "“That would be the maximum, at all events,” replied the advocate of\nSauveterre. “But the trial goes on; the prosecuting attorney demands\nan overwhelming punishment; and at last the prisoner’s council is\ncalled upon to speak. Gentlemen, you were impatient at my persistence.\nI do not credit, I confess, the statement made by M. de Boiscoran. But\nmy young colleague here does credit it. Well, let him tell us\ncandidly. Would he dare to plead this statement, and assert that the\nCountess Claudieuse had been Jacques’s mistress?”",
        "M. Folgat looked annoyed.",
        "“I don’t know,” he said in an undertone.",
        "“Well, I know you would not,” exclaimed M. Magloire; “and you would be\nright, for you would risk your reputation without the slightest chance\nof saving Jacques. Yes, no chance whatever! For after all, let us\nsuppose, what can hardly be even supposed, you should prove that\nJacques has told the truth, that he has been the lover of the\ncountess. What would happen then? They arrest the countess. Do they\nrelease M. de Boiscoran on that account? Certainly not! They keep him\nin prison, and say to him. ’This woman has attempted her husband’s\nlife; but she had been your mistress, and you are her accomplice.’",
        "“That is the situation, gentlemen!”",
        "M. Magloire had stripped it of all unnecessary comments, of idle\nconjecture, and all sentimental phraseology, and placed it before them\nas it had to be looked at, in all its fearful simplicity.",
        "Grandpapa Chandore was terrified. He rose, and said in an almost\ninaudible voice,–",
        "“Ah, all is over indeed! Innocent, or guilty, Jacques de Boiscoran\nwill be condemned.”",
        "M. Magloire made no reply.",
        "“And that is,” continued the old gentleman, “what you call justice!”",
        "“Alas!” sighed M. Seneschal, “it is useless to deny it: trials by jury\nare a lottery.”",
        "M. de Chandore, driven nearly to madness by his despair, interrupted\nhim,–",
        "“In other words, Jacques’s honor and life depend at this hour on a\nchance,–on the weather on the day of the trial, or the health of a\njuror. And if Jacques was the only one! But there is Dionysia’s life,\ngentlemen, my child’s life, also at stake. If you strike Jacques, you\nstrike Dionysia!”",
        "M. Folgat could hardly restrain a tear. M. Seneschal, and even the\ndoctor, shuddered at such grief in an old man, who was threatened in\nall that was dearest to him,–in his one great love upon earth. He had\ntaken the hand of the great advocate of Sauveterre, and, pressing it\nconvulsively, he went on,–",
        "“You will save him, Magloire, won’t you? What does it matter whether\nhe be innocent or guilty, since Dionysia loves him? You have saved so\nmany in your life! It is well known the judges cannot resist the\nweight of your words. You will find means to save a poor, unhappy man\nwho once was your friend.”",
        "The eminent lawyer looked cast-down, as if he had been guilty himself.\nWhen Dr. Seignebos saw this, he exclaimed,–",
        "“What do you mean, friend Magloire? Are you no longer the man whose\nmarvellous eloquence is the pride of our country? Hold your head up:\nfor shame! Never was a nobler cause intrusted to you.”",
        "But he shook his head, and murmured,–",
        "“I have no faith in it; and I cannot plead when my conscience does not\nfurnish the arguments.”",
        "And becoming more and more embarrassed, he added,–",
        "“Seignebos was right in saying just now, I am not the man for such a\ncause. Here all my experience would be of no use. It will be better to\nintrust it to my young brother here.”",
        "For the first time in his life, M. Folgat came here upon a case such\nas enables a man to rise to eminence, and to open a great future\nbefore him. For the first time, he came upon a case in which were\nunited all the elements of supreme interest,–greatness of crime,\neminence of victim, character of the accused, mystery, variety of\nopinions, difficulty of defence, and uncertainty of issue,–one of\nthose causes for which an advocate is filled with enthusiasm, which he\nseizes upon with all his energies, and in which he shares all the\nanxiety and all the hopes with his client.",
        "He would readily have given five years’ income to be offered the\nmanagement of this case; but he was, above all, an honest man. He\nsaid, therefore,–",
        "“You would not think of abandoning M. de Boiscoran, M. Magloire?”",
        "“You will be more useful to him than I can be,” was the reply.",
        "Perhaps M. Folgat was inwardly of the same opinion. Still he said,–",
        "“You have not considered what an effect this would have.”",
        "“Oh!”",
        "“What would the public think if they heard all of a sudden that you\nhad withdrawn? ’This affair of M. de Boiscoran must be a very bad one\nindeed,’ they would say, ’that M. Magloire should refuse to plead in\nit.’ And that would be an additional burden laid upon the unfortunate\nman.”",
        "The doctor gave his friend no time to reply.",
        "“Magloire is not at liberty to withdraw,” he said, “but he has the\nright to associate a brother-lawyer with himself. He must remain the\nadvocate and counsel of M. de Boiscoran; but M. Folgat can lend him\nthe assistance of his advice, the support of his youth and his\nactivity, and even of his eloquence.”",
        "A passing blush colored the cheeks of the young lawyer.",
        "“I am entirely at M. Magloire’s service,” he said.",
        "The famous advocate of Sauveterre considered a while. After a few\nmoments he turned to his young colleague, and asked him,–",
        "“Have you any plan? Any idea? What would you do?”",
        "To the astonishment of all, M. Folgat now revealed his true character\nto some extent. He looked taller, his face brightened up, his eyes\nshone brightly, and he said in a full, sonorous voice,–a voice which\nby its metallic ring made all hearts vibrate,–",
        "“First of all, I should go and see M. de Boiscoran. He alone should\ndetermine my final decision. But my plan is formed now. I, gentlemen,\nI have faith, as I told you before. The man whom Miss Dionysia loves\ncannot be a criminal. What would I do? I would prove the truth of M.\nde Boiscoran’s statement. Can that be done? I hope so. He tells us\nthat there are no proofs or witnesses of his intimacy with the\nCountess Claudieuse. I am sure he is mistaken. She has shown, he says,\nextraordinary care and prudence. That may be. But mistrust challenges\nsuspicion; and, when you take the greatest precautions, you are most\nlikely to be watched. You want to hide, and you are discovered. You\nsee nobody; but they see you.",
        "“If I were charged with the defence, I should commence to-morrow a\ncounter-investigation. We have money, the Marquis de Boiscoran has\ninfluential connections; and we should have help everywhere. Before\nforty-eight hours are gone, I should have experienced agents at work.\nI know Vine Street in Passy: it is a lonely street; but it has eyes,\nas all streets have. Why should not some of these eyes have noticed\nthe mysterious visits of the countess? My agents would inquire from\nhouse to house. Nor would it be necessary to mention names. They would\nnot be charged with a search after the Countess Claudieuse, but after\nan unknown lady, dressed so and so; and, if they should discover any\none who had seen her, and who could identify her, that man would be\nour first witness.",
        "“In the meantime, I should go in search of this friend of M. de\nBoiscoran’s, this Englishman, whose name he assumed; and the London\npolice would aid me in my efforts. If that Englishman is dead, we\nwould hear of it, and it would be a misfortune. If he is only at the\nother end of the world, the transatlantic cable enables us to question\nhim, and to be answered in a week.",
        "“I should, at the same time, have sent detectives after that English\nmaid-servant who attended to the house in Vine Street. M. de Boiscoran\ndeclares that she has never even caught a glimpse of the countess. I\ndo not believe it. It is out of question that a servant should not\nwish for the means, and find them, of seeing the face of the woman who\ncomes to see her master.",
        "“And that is not all. There were other people who came to the house in\nVine Street. I should examine them one by one,–the gardener and his\nhelp, the water-carrier, the upholsterer, the errand-boys of all the\nmerchants. Who can say whether one of them is not in possession of\nthis truth which we are seeking?",
        "“Finally, when a woman has spent so many days in a house, it is almost\nimpossible that she should not have left some traces of her passage\nbehind her. Since then, you will say, there has been the war, and then\nthe commune. Nevertheless, I should examine the ruins, every tree in\nthe garden, every pane in the windows: I should compel the very\nmirrors that have escaped destruction to give me back the image which\nthey have so often reflected.”",
        "“Ah, I call that speaking!” cried the doctor, full of enthusiasm.",
        "The others trembled with excitement. They felt that the struggle was\ncommencing. But, unmindful of the impression he had produced, M.\nFolgat went on,–",
        "“Here in Sauveterre, the task would be more difficult; but, in case of\nsuccess, the result, also, would be more decided. I should bring down\nfrom Paris one of those keen, subtle detectives who have made an art\nof their profession, and I should know how to stimulate his vanity.\nHe, of course, would have to know every thing, even the names; but\nthere would be no danger in that. His desire to succeed, the splendor\nof the reward, even his professional habits, would be our security. He\nwould come down secretly, concealed under whatever disguise would\nappear to him most useful for his purpose; and he would begin once\nmore, for the benefit of the defence, the investigation carried on by\nM. Galpin for the benefit of the prosecution. Would he find out any\nthing? We can but hope so. I know detectives, who, by the aid of\nsmaller material, have unravelled far deeper mysteries.”",
        "Grandpapa Chandore, excellent M. Seneschal, Dr. Seignebos, and even M.\nMagloire, were literally drinking in the words of the Paris lawyer.",
        "“Is that all, gentlemen?” he continued. “By no means! Thanks to his\ngreat experience, Dr. Seignebos had, on the very first day,\ninstinctively guessed who was the most important personage of this\nmysterious drama.”",
        "“Cocoleu!”",
        "“Exactly, Cocoleu. Whether he be actor, confident, or eye-witness,\nCocoleu has evidently the key to this mystery. This key we must make\nevery effort to obtain from him. Medical experts have just declared\nhim idiotic; nevertheless, we protest. We claim that the imbecility of\nthis wretch is partly assumed. We maintain that his obstinate silence\nis a vile imposture. What! he should have intelligence enough to\ntestify against us, and yet not have left enough of it now to explain,\nor even to repeat his evidence? That is inadmissible. We maintain that\nhe keeps silent now just as he spoke that night,–by order. If his\nsilence was less profitable for the prosecution, they would soon find\nmeans to break it. We demand that such means should be employed. We\ndemand that the person who has before been able to loosen his tongue\nshould be sent for, and ordered to try the experiment over again. We\ncall for a new examination by experts: we cannot judge all of a\nsudden, and in forty-eight hours, what is the true mental condition of\na man, especially when that man is suspected of being an impostor. And\nwe require, above all, that these new experts should be qualified by\nknowledge and experience.”",
        "Dr. Seignebos was quivering with excitement. He heard all his own\nideas repeated in a concise, energetic manner.",
        "“Yes,” he cried, “that is the way to do it! Let me have full power,\nand in less than a fortnight Cocoleu is unmasked.”",
        "Less expansive, the eminent advocate of Sauveterre simply shook hands\nwith M. Folgat, and said,–",
        "“You see, M. de Boiscoran’s case ought to be put in your hands.”",
        "The young lawyer made no effort to protest. When he began to speak,\nhis determination was already formed.",
        "“Whatever can humanly be done,” he replied, “I will do. If I accept\nthe task, I shall devote myself body and soul to it. But I insist upon\nit, it is understood, and must be publicly announced, that M. Magloire\ndoes not withdraw from the case, and that I act only as his junior.”",
        "“Agreed,” said the old advocate.",
        "“Well. When shall we go and see M. de Boiscoran?”",
        "“To-morrow morning.”",
        "“I can, of course, take no steps till I have seen him.”",
        "“Yes, but you cannot be admitted, except by a special permission from\nM. Galpin; and I doubt if we can procure that to-day.”",
        "“That is provoking.”",
        "“No, since we have our work all cut out for to-day. We have to go over\nall the papers of the proceedings, which the magistrate has placed in\nmy hands.”",
        "Dr. Seignebos was boiling over with impatience. He broke in,–",
        "“Oh, what words! Go to work, Mr. Advocate, to work, I say. Come, shall\nwe go?”",
        "They were leaving the room when M. de Chandore called them back by a\ngesture. He said,–",
        "“So far, gentlemen, we have thought of Jacques alone. And Dionysia?”",
        "The others looked at him, full of surprise.",
        "“What am I to day if she asks me what the result of M. Magloire’s\ninterview with Jacques has been, and why you would say nothing in her\npresence?”",
        "Dr. Seignebos had confessed it more than once: he was no friend of\nconcealment.",
        "’You will tell her the truth,” was his advice.",
        "“What? How can I tell her that Jacques has been the lover of the\nCountess Claudieuse?”",
        "“She will hear of it sooner or later. Miss Dionysia is a sensible,\nenergetic girl.”",
        "“Yes; but Miss Dionysia is as ignorant as a holy angel,” broke in M.\nFolgat eagerly, “and she loves M. de Boiscoran. Why should we trouble\nthe purity of her thoughts and her happiness? Is she not unhappy\nenough? M. de Boiscoran is no longer kept in close confinement. He\nwill see his betrothed, and, if he thinks proper, he can tell her. He\nalone has the right to do so. I shall, however, dissuade him. From\nwhat I know of Miss Chandore’s character, it would be impossible for\nher to control herself, if she should meet the Countess Claudieuse.”",
        "“M. de Chandore ought not to say any thing,” said M. Magloire\ndecisively. “It is too much already, to have to intrust the\nmarchioness with the secret; for you must not forget, gentlemen, that\nthe slightest indiscretion would certainly ruin all of M. Folgat’s\ndelicate plans.”",
        "Thereupon all went out; and M. de Chandore, left alone, said to\nhimself,–",
        "“Yes, they are right; but what am I to say?”",
        "He was thinking it over almost painfully, when a maid came in, and\ntold him that Miss Dionysia wanted to see him.",
        "“I am coming,” he said.",
        "And he followed her with heavy steps, and trying to compose his\nfeatures so as to efface all traces of the terrible emotions through\nwhich he had passed. The two aunts had taken Dionysia and the\nmarchioness to the parlor in the upper story. Here M. de Chandore\nfound them all assembled,–the marchioness, pale and overcome,\nextended in an easy-chair; but Dionysia, walking up and down with\nburning cheeks and blazing eyes. As soon as he entered, she asked him\nin a sharp, sad voice,–",
        "“Well? There is no hope, I suppose.”",
        "“More hope than ever, on the contrary,” he replied, trying to smile.",
        "“Then why did M. De Magloire send us all out?”",
        "The old gentleman had had time to prepare a fib.",
        "“Because M. Magloire had to tell us a piece of bad news. There is no\nchance of no true bill being found. Jacques will have to appear in\ncourt.”",
        "The marchioness jumped up like a piece of mechanism, and cried,–",
        "“What! Jacques before the assizes? My son? A Boiscoran?” And she fell\nback into her chair. Not a muscle in Dionysia’s face had moved. She\nsaid in a strange tone of voice,–",
        "“I was prepared for something worse. One may avoid the court.”",
        "With these words she left the room, shutting the door so violently,\nthat both the Misses Lavarande hastened after her. Now M. de Chandore\nthought he might speak freely. He stood up before the marchioness, and\ngave vent to that fearful wrath which had been rising within him for a\nlong time.",
        "“Your son,” he cried, “your Jacques, I wish he were dead a thousand\ntimes! The wretch who is killing my child, for you see he is killing\nher.”",
        "And, without pity, he told her the whole story of Jacques and the\nCountess Claudieuse. The marchioness was overcome. She had even ceased\nto sob, and had not strength enough left to ask him to have pity on\nher. And, when he had ended, she whispered to herself with an\nexpression of unspeakable suffering,–",
        "“Adultery! Oh, my God! what punishment!”",
