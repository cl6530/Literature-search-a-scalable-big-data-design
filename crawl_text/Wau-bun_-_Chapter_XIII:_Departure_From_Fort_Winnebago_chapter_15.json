        "Having taken a tender leave of our friends, the morning of the 8th of\nMarch saw us mounted and equipped for our journey. The weather was\nfine–the streams, already fringed with green, were sparkling in the\nsun–everything gave promise of an early and genial season. In vain,\nwhen we reached the ferry at the foot of the hill on which the fort\nstood, did Major Twiggs repeat his endeavors to dissuade us from\ncommencing a journey which he assured me would be perilous beyond what I\ncould anticipate. I was resolute.",
        "Our party was augmented by an escort of all the young officers, who\npolitely insisted on accompanying us as far as Duck Creek, four miles\ndistant. Indeed, there were some who would gladly have prosecuted the\nwhole journey with us, and escaped the monotony of their solitary,\nuneventful life. In our rear followed an ox cart, on which was perched a\ncanoe, destined to transport us over the creek, and also an extensive\nmarsh beyond it, which was invariably, at this season, overflowed with\nwater to a considerable depth. We had much amusement in watching the\nprogress of this vehicle as it bumped and thumped over the road,\nunconscious hitherto of the dignity of a wheeled carriage.",
        "Our little, shock-headed, sunburnt, thick-lipped Canadian (who happened\nmost miraculously to be the husband of my pretty servant, Mrs. Pillon)\nshouted vociferously as the animals lagged in their pace, or jolted\nagainst a stump, ’Marchez, don-g,” ’regardez,” ’prenez garde,” to\nour infinite diversion. I was in high spirits, foreseeing no hardships\nor dangers, but rather imagining myself embarked on a pleasure excursion\nacross the prairies. It had not even suggested itself to me that a straw\nbonnet and kid gloves were no suitable equipment for such an expedition.\nNever having travelled at so inclement a season, I was heedlessly\nignorant of the mode of preparing against it, and had resisted or\nlaughed at my husband’s suggestions to provide myself with blanket\nsocks, and a woollen capuchon for my head and shoulders. And now,\nalthough the wind occasionally lifted my head-gear with a rude puff, and\nmy hands ere long became swollen and stiffened with the cold, I\npersuaded myself that these were trifling evils, to which I should soon\nget accustomed. I was too well pleased with the novelty of my outfit,\nwith my hunting-knife in a gay scabbard hanging from my neck, and my tin\ncup at my saddle-bow, to regard minor inconveniences.",
        "On reaching Duck Creek, we took leave of our young friends, who remained\non the bank long enough to witness our passage across–ourselves in the\ncanoe, and the poor horses swimming the stream, now filled with cakes of\nfloating ice.",
        "Beyond the rising ground which formed the opposite bank of the stream,\nextended a marsh of perhaps three hundred yards across. To this the men\ncarried the canoe which was to bear us over. The water was not deep, so\nour attendants merely took off the pack from Brunet and my side-saddle\nfrom Le Gris, for fear of accidents, and then mounted their own steeds,\nleading the two extra ones. My husband placed the furniture of the\npack-horse and my saddle in the centre of the canoe, which he was to\npaddle across.",
        "“Now, wifie,” said he, “jump in, and seat yourself flat in the bottom of\nthe canoe.”",
        "“Oh, no,” said I; “I will sit on the little trunk in the centre; I shall\nbe so much more comfortable, and I can balance the canoe exactly.”",
        "“As you please; but I think you will find it is not the best way.”",
        "A vigorous push sent us a few feet from the bank. At that instant two\nfavorite greyhounds whom we had brought with us, and who had stood\nwhining upon the bank, reluctant to take to the water as they were\nordered, gave a sudden bound, and alighted full upon me. The canoe\nbalanced a moment–then yielded–and, quick as thought, dogs, furniture,\nand lady were in the deepest of the water.",
        "My husband, who was just preparing to spring into the canoe when the\ndogs thus unceremoniously took precedence of him, was at my side in a\nmoment, and, seizing me by the collar of my cloak, begged me not to be\nfrightened. I was not, in the least, and only laughed as he raised and\nplaced me again upon the bank.",
        "The unfortunate saddle and little trunk were then rescued, but not until\nthey had received a pretty thorough wetting. Our merriment was still\nfurther increased by the sight of the maladroit Pillon, who was\nattempting to ride my spirited Jerry across the marsh. He was clinging\nto the neck of the animal, with a countenance distorted with terror, as\nhe shouted forth all manner of French objurgations. Jerry pranced and\ncurveted, and finally shot forward his rider, or rather his burden,\nheadforemost, a distance of several feet into the water.",
        "A general outcry of mirth saluted the unfortunate Frenchman, which was\nredoubled as he raised himself puffing and snorting from his watery bed\nand waddled back to his starting-place, the horse, meanwhile, very\nsensibly making his way to join his companions, who had already reached\nthe farther bank.",
        "“Well, wifie,” said Mr. Kinzie, “I cannot trust you in the canoe again.\nThere is no way but to carry you across the marsh like a pappoose. Will\nyou take a ride on my shoulders?”",
        "“With all my heart, if you will promise to take me safely.” And I was\nsoon mounted.",
        "I most confess that the gentleman staggered now and then under his\nburden, which was no slight one, and I was sadly afraid, more than once,\nthat I should meet a similar fate to old Pillon, but happily we reached\nthe other side in safety.",
        "There my husband insisted on my putting on dry shoes and stockings, and\n(must I confess it?) drinking a little brandy, to obviate the effects of\nmy icy bath. He would fain have made a halt to kindle a fire and dry my\napparel and wardrobe properly, but this I would not listen to. I\nendeavored to prove to him that the delay would expose me to more cold\nthan riding in my wet habit and cloak, and so indeed it might have been,\nbut along with my convictions upon the subject there was mingled a spice\nof reluctance that our friends at the fort should have an opportunity,\nas they certainly would have done, of laughing at our inauspicious\ncommencement.",
        "Soon our horses were put in order, and our march recommenced. The day\nwas fine for the season. I felt no inconvenience from my wet garments,\nthe exercise of riding taking away all feeling of chilliness. It was to\nme a new mode of travelling, and I enjoyed it the more from having been\nsecluded for more than five months within the walls of the fort,\nscarcely varying the tenor of our lives by an occasional walk of half a\nmile into the surrounding woods.",
        "We had still another detention upon the road, from meeting Lapierre, the\nblacksmith, from Sugar Creek, who with one of his associates was going\nto the Portage for supplies, so that we had not travelled more than\ntwenty-three miles when we came to our proposed encamping-ground. It was\nupon a beautiful stream, a tributary of one of the Four Lakes,[14] that\nchain whose banks are unrivalled for romantic loveliness.",
        "I could not but admire the sagacity of the horses, who seemed, with\nhuman intelligence, to divine our approach to the spot where their toils\nwere to cease. While still remote from the point of woods which foretold\na halt, they pricked up their ears, accelerated their pace, and finally\narrived at the spot on a full gallop.",
        "We alighted at an open space, just within the verge of the wood, or, as\nit is called by Western travellers, “the timber.” My husband recommended\nto me to walk about until a fire should be made, which was soon\naccomplished by our active and experienced woodsmen, to whom the felling\nof a large tree was the work of a very few minutes. The dry grass around\nfurnished an excellent tinder, which, ignited by the sparks from the\nflint (there were no loco-focos in those days), and aided by the\nbroken branches and bits of light-wood, soon produced a cheering flame.\n“The bourgeois,” in the mean time, busied himself in setting up the\ntent, taking care to place it opposite the fire, but in such a direction\nthat the wind would carry the smoke and flame away from the opening or\ndoor. Within upon the ground were spread, first a bear-skin, then two\nor three blankets (of which each equestrian had carried two, one under\nthe saddle and one above it), after which, the remainder of the luggage\nbeing brought in, I was able to divest myself of all my wet clothing and\nreplace it with dry. Some idea of the state of the thermometer may be\nformed from the fact that my riding-habit, being placed over the end of\nthe huge log against which our fire was made, was, in a very few\nminutes, frozen so stiff as to stand upright, giving the appearance of a\ndress out of which a lady had vanished in some unaccountable manner.",
        "It would be but a repetition of our experience upon the Fox River to\ndescribe the ham broiled upon the “broches,” the toasted bread, the\nsteaming coffee, the primitive table-furniture. There is, however, this\ndifference, that of the latter we carry with us in our journeys on\nhorseback only a coffee-pot, a tea-kettle, and each rider his tin cup\nand hunting-knife. The deportment at table is marked by an absence of\nceremony. The knife is drawn from the scabbard–those who remember to do\nso, vouchsafe it a wipe upon the napkin. Its first office is to stir the\ncup of coffee–next, to divide the piece of ham which is placed on the\nhalf of a travelling biscuit, held in the left hand, to fulfil the\noffice of a plate. It is an art only to be acquired by long practice, to\ncut the meat so skilfully as not at the same time to destroy the dish.",
        "We take our places around the mat to enjoy what, after our fatiguing\nride, we find delicious food. The Frenchmen are seated at a little\ndistance, receiving their supplies of coffee, meat, and bread, and\noccasionally passing jokes with the bourgeois, who is their demi-god,\nand for whom their respect and devotion are never lessened by his\naffability or condescension.",
        "The meal being finished, the table-furniture is rinsed in hot water and\nset aside until morning. A wisp of dry prairie-grass is supposed in most\ncases to render the knife fit to be restored to the scabbard, and there\nbeing, at this season of the year, no amusement but that of watching the\nawkward movements of the spancelled horses in their progress from spot\nto spot in search of pasturage, we are usually soon disposed to arrange\nour blankets and retire to rest.",
        "At break of day we are aroused by the shout of the bourgeois,–",
        "“How! how! how!”",
        "All start from their slumbers. The fire, which has been occasionally\nreplenished through the night, is soon kindled into a flame. The horses\nare caught and saddled, while a breakfast, similar in kind to the meal\nof the preceding evening, is preparing–the tent is struck–the\npack-horse loaded–”tout démanché,” as the Canadian says. The\nbreakfast finished, we rinse our kettles and cups, tie them to our\nsaddle-bows, and then mount and away, leaving our fire, or rather our\nsmoke, to tell of our visit.",
        "March 9th.–Our journey this day led us past the first of the Four\nLakes. Scattered along its banks was an encampment of Winnebagoes. They\ngreeted their Father with vociferous joy–”Bon-jour, bon-jour,\nShaw-nee-aw-kee,” ’Hee-nee-kar-ray-kay-noo?” (how do you do?)",
        "To this succeeded the usual announcement, ’Wys-kap-rah\ntshoonsh-koo-nee-noh!” (I have no bread.)",
        "This is their form of begging; but we could not afford to be generous,\nfor the uncertainty of obtaining a supply, should our own be exhausted,\nobliged us to observe the strictest economy.",
        "How beautiful the entrapment looked in the morning sun! The matted\nlodges, with the blue smoke curling from their tops–the trees and\nbushes powdered with a light snow which had fallen through the\nnight–the lake, shining and sparkling, almost at our feet–even the\nIndians, in their peculiar costume, adding to the picturesque!",
        "I was sorry to leave it, as we were compelled to do, in all haste,\nSouris, the pack-horse, having taken it into his head to decamp while we\nwere in conversation with our red friends. As he had, very sensibly,\nconcluded to pursue his journey in the right direction, we had the good\nfortune to overtake him after a short race, and, having received much\nscolding and some blows from young Roy, whose charge he specially was,\nhe was placed in the middle of the cavalcade, as a mark of disgrace for\nhis breach of duty.",
        "Our road, after leaving the lake, lay over a “rolling prairie,” now bare\nand desolate enough. The hollows were filled with snow, which, being\npartly thawed, furnished an uncertain footing for the horses, and I\ncould not but join in the ringing laughter of oar Frenchmen as\noccasionally Brunet and Souris, the two ponies, would flounder, almost\nimbedded, through the yielding mass. Even the vainglorious Plante, who\npiqued himself on his equestrian skill, was once or twice nearly\nunhorsed, from having chosen his road badly. Sometimes the elevations\nwere covered with a thicket or copse, in which our dogs would generally\nrouse up one or more deer. Their first bound, or “lope,” was the signal\nfor a chase. The horses seemed to enter into the spirit of it, as\n“halloo” answered “halloo;” but we were never so fortunate as to get a\nshot at one, for although the dogs once or twice caught they were not\nstrong enough to hold them. It was about the middle of the afternoon\nwhen we reached the Blue Mound. I rejoiced much to have got so far, for\nI was sadly fatigued, and every mile now seemed like two to me. In fact,\nthe miles are unconscionably long in this country. When I was told that\nwe had still seven miles to go, to “Morrison’s,” where we proposed\nstopping for the night, I was almost in despair. It was my first journey\non horseback, and I had not yet become inured to the exercise.",
        "When we reached Morrison’s I was so much exhausted that, as my husband\nattempted to lift me from the saddle, I fell into his arms.",
        "“This will never do,” said he. “To-morrow we must turn our faces towards\nFort Winnebago again.”",
        "The door opened hospitably to receive us. We were welcomed by a lady\nwith a most sweet, benignant countenance, and by her companion, some\nyears younger. The first was Mrs. Morrison–the other, Miss Elizabeth\nDodge, daughter of General Dodge.",
        "My husband laid me upon a small bed, in the room where the ladies had\nbeen sitting at work. They took off my bonnet and riding-dress, chafed\nmy hands, and prepared me some warm wine and water, by which I was soon\nrevived. A half-hour’s repose so refreshed me that I was able to\nconverse with the ladies, and to relieve my husband’s mind of all\nanxiety on my account. Tea was announced soon after, and we repaired to\nan adjoining building, for Morrison’s, like the establishment of all\nsettlers of that period, consisted of a group of detached log houses or\ncabins, each containing one or at most two apartments.",
        "The table groaned with good cheer, and brought to mind some that I had\nseen among the old-fashioned Dutch residents on the banks of the Hudson.",
        "I had recovered my spirits, and we were quite a cheerful party. Mrs.\nMorrison told us that during the first eighteen months she passed in\nthis country she did not speak with a white woman, the only society she\nhad being that of her husband and two black servant-women.",
        "A Tennessee woman had called in with her little son just before tea,\nand we amused Mr. Kinzie with a description of the pair. The mother’s\nvisit was simply one of courtesy. She was a little, dumpy woman, with a\ncomplexion burned perfectly red by the sun, and hair of an exact\ntow-color, braided up from her forehead in front and from her neck\nbehind. These tails, meeting on the top of her head, were fastened with\na small tin comb. Her dress was of checkered homespun, a “very tight\nfit,” and, as she wore no ruff or handkerchief around her neck, she\nlooked as if just prepared for execution. She was evidently awestruck at\nthe sight of visitors, and seemed inclined to take her departure at\nonce; but the boy, not so easily intimidated, would not understand her\nsigns and pinches until he had sidled up to Mrs. Morrison, and, drawing\nhis old hat still farther over his eyes, begged for a whang, meaning a\nnarrow strip of deer-skin. The lady very obligingly cut one from a large\nsmoked skin, which she produced from its receptacle, and mother and son\ntook their leave, with a smiling but rather a scared look.",
        "After tea we returned to Mrs. Morrison’s parlor, where she kindly\ninsisted on my again reposing myself on the little bed, to recruit me,\nas she said, for the ensuing day’s journey. My husband, in the mean\ntime, went to look after the accommodation of his men and horses.",
        "During the conversation that ensued, I learned that Mrs. Morrison had\npassed much time in the neighborhood of my recent home in Oneida County,\nthat many of the friends I had loved and valued were likewise her\nfriends, and that she had even proposed to visit me at Fort Winnebago on\nhearing of my arrival there, in order to commence an acquaintance which\nhad thus been brought about by other and unexpected means.",
        "Long and pleasant was the discourse we held together until a late hour,\nand mutual was the satisfaction with which we passed old friends and\nby-gone events in review, much to the edification of Miss Dodge, and of\nthe gentlemen when they once more joined us.",
