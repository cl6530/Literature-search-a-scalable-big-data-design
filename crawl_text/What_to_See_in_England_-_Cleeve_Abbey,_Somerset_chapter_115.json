        "At Cleeve the Cistercian abbey church has disappeared, save for the\nbases of the pillars in the nave, but the conventual buildings are some\nof the most perfect in England, those of Beaulieu in Hampshire and\nFountains in Yorkshire being the only ones able to compare with them.\nOne first passes through the magnificent old gatehouse pictured here.\nInside is a large grassy space, with the mass of buildings facing one.\nThey are arranged in a quadrangular form, enclosing a grassy cloister\ngarth. On the south side is the refectory, a magnificent hall above some\nsmall rooms on the ground floor. It is believed to have been built by\nAbbot Dovell in the sixteenth century. The roof, of carved walnut, is in\na perfect state of preservation. From the refectory one may pass into\nthe Abbots’ Lodge, then descending to the cloister garth again, one may\npenetrate all the different portions of the buildings–the day-room,\nwhere the monks did all sorts of work; the dormitory, where they slept;\nthe chapter-house, where they conducted the business of the abbey; the\nsacristy, the parlour, and other smaller rooms. The buildings are so\nperfect that it is quite easy to obtain a comprehensive idea of the\ninner workings of one of these great mediaeval institutions.",
        "The monks’ day-room is a large building 60 feet long by 22 feet wide.\nThe upper floor, forming one half of the dormitory, has disappeared, but\nthere still remain the bases of the two central pillars which supported\nthe groined roof. The restoration of Cleeve Abbey was carried out\nseveral years ago by Mr. G.F. Luttrell of Dunster Castle. Before that\ntime the whole place was used as a farm, and floors of encaustic tiles\nwere buried deep in farm-yard rubbish. There is practically no recorded\nhistory of Cleeve Abbey.",
        "One shilling is charged for admission for one person, or sixpence each\nfor a party of two or more.",
