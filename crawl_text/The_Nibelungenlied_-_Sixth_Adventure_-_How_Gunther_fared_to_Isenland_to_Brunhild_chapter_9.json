        "Tidings unknown to any / from over Rhine now come,\nHow winsome maids a many / far yonder had their home.\nWhereof the royal Gunther / bethought him one to win,\nAnd o’er the thought the monarch / of full joyous mood was seen.",
        "326",
        "There was a queenly maiden / seated over sea,\nLike her nowhere another / was ever known to be.\nShe was in beauty matchless, / full mickle was her might;\nHer love the prize of contest, / she hurled the shaft with valiant\n      knight.",
        "327",
        "The stone she threw far distant, / wide sprang thereafter too.\nWho turned to her his fancy / with intent to woo,\nThree times perforce must vanquish / the lady of high degree;\nFailed he in but one trial, / forfeited his head had he.",
        "328",
        "This same the lusty princess / times untold had done.\nWhen to a warrior gallant / beside the Rhine ’twas known,\nHe thought to take unto him / the noble maid for wife:\nThereby must heroes many / since that moment lose their life.",
        "329",
        "Then spake of Rhine the master: / “I’ll down unto the sea\nUnto Brunhild journey, / fare as ’twill with me.\nFor her unmeasured beauty / I’ll gladly risk my life,\nReady eke to lose it, / if she may not be my wife.”",
        "330",
        "“I counsel thee against it,\" / spake then Siegfried.\n“So terrible in contest / the queen is indeed,\nWho for her love is suitor / his zeal must dearly pay.\nSo shalt thou from the journey / truly be content to stay.”",
        "331",
        "“So will I give thee counsel,\" / outspake Hagen there,\n“That thou beg of Siegfried / with thee to bear\nThe perils that await thee: / that is now my rede,\nTo him is known so fully / what with Brunhild will be thy need.”",
        "332",
        "He spake: “And wilt thou help me, / noble Siegfried,\nTo win the lovely maiden? / Do what now I plead;\nAnd if in all her beauty / she be my wedded wife,\nTo meet thy fullest wishes / honor will I pledge and life.”",
        "333",
        "Thereto answered Siegfried, / the royal Siegmund’s son:\n“Giv’st thou me thy sister, / so shall thy will be done,\n–Kriemhild the noble princess, / in beauty all before.\nFor toils that I encounter / none other meed I ask thee more.”",
        "334",
        "“That pledge I,” spake then Gunther, / “Siegfried, in thy hand.\nAnd comes the lovely Brunhild / thither to this land,\nThereunto thee my sister / for wife I’ll truly give,\nThat with the lovely maiden / thou may’st ever joyful live.”",
        "335",
        "Oaths the knight full noble / upon the compact swore,\nWhereby to them came troubles / and dangers all the more,\nEre they the royal lady / brought unto the Rhine.\nStill should the warriors valiant / in sorest need and sorrow pine.",
        "336",
        "With him carried Siegfried / that same mantle then,\nThe which with mickle trouble / had won the hero keen\nFrom a dwarf in struggle, / Alberich by name.\nThey dressed them for the journey, / the valiant thanes of lofty fame.",
        "337",
        "And when the doughty Siegfried / the sightless mantle wore,\nHad he within it / of strength as good a store\nAs other men a dozen / in himself alone.\nThe full stately princess / anon by cunning art he won.",
        "338",
        "Eke had that same mantle / such wondrous properties\nThat any man whatever / might work whate’er he please\nWhen once he had it on him, / yet none could see or tell.\n’Twas so that he won Brunhild; / whereby him evil since befell.",
        "339",
        "“Ere we begin our journey, / Siegfried, tell to me,\nThat we with fullest honor / come unto the sea,\nShall we lead warriors with us / down to Brunhild’s land?\nThanes a thirty thousand / straightway shall be called to hand.”",
        "340",
        "“Men bring we ne’er so many,\" / answered Siegfried then.\n“So terrible in custom / ever is the queen,\nThat all would death encounter / from her angry mood.\nI’ll give thee better counsel, / thane in valor keen and good.",
        "341",
        "“Like as knights-errant journey / down the Rhine shall we.\nThose now will I name thee / who with us shall be;\nBut four in all the company / seaward shall we fare:\nThus shall we woo the lady, / what fortune later be our share.",
        "342",
        "“Myself one of the company, / a second thou shalt be,\nHagen be the third one / –so fare we happily;\nThe fourth let it be Dankwart, / warrior full keen.\nNever thousand others / dare in fight withstand us then.”",
        "343",
        "“The tale I would know gladly,\" / the king then further said,\n“Ere we have parted thither / –of that were I full glad–\nWhat should we of apparel, / that would befit us well,\nWear in Brunhild’s presence: / that shalt thou now to Gunther tell.”",
        "344",
        "“Weeds the very finest / that ever might be found\nThey wear in every season / in Brunhild’s land:\nSo shall we rich apparel / before the lady wear,\nThat we have not dishonor / where men the tale hereafter hear.”",
        "345",
        "Then spake he to the other: / “Myself will go unto\nMy own loving mother, / if I from her may sue\nThat her fair tendant maidens / help that we be arrayed\nAs we may go in honor / before the high majestic maid.”",
        "346",
        "Then spake of Tronje Hagen / with noble courtliness:\n“Why wilt thou of thy mother / beg such services?\nOnly let thy sister / hear our mind and mood:\nSo shall for this our journey / her good service be bestowed.”",
        "347",
        "Then sent he to his sister / that he her would see,\nAnd with him also Siegfried. / Ere that such might be,\nHerself had there the fair one / in rich apparel clad.\nSooth to tell, the visit / but little did displease the maid.",
        "348",
        "Then also were her women / decked as for them was meet.\nThe princes both were coming: / she rose from off her seat,\nAs doth a high-born lady / when that she did perceive,\nAnd went the guest full noble / and eke her brother to receive.",
        "349",
        "“Welcome be my brother / and his companion too.\nI’d know the story gladly,\" / spake the maiden so,\n“What ye now are seeking / that ye are come to me:\nI pray you straightway tell me / how ’t with you valiants twain may be.”",
        "350",
        "Then spake the royal Gunther: / “Lady, thou shall hear:\nSpite of lofty spirits / have we yet a care.\nTo woo a maid we travel / afar to lands unknown;\nWe should against the journey / have rich apparel for our own.”",
        "351",
        "“Seat thee now, dear brother,\" / spake the princess fair;\n“Let me hear the story, / who the ladies are\nThat ye will seek as suitors / in stranger princes’ land.\"\nBoth good knights the lady / took in greeting by the hand.",
        "352",
        "With the twain then went she / where she herself had sat,\nTo couches rich and costly, / in sooth believe ye that,\nWrought in design full cunning / of gold embroidery.\nAnd with these fair ladies / did pass the time right pleasantly.",
        "353",
        "Many tender glances / and looks full many a one\nFondly knight and lady / each other cast upon.\nWithin his heart he bore her, / she was as his own life.\nAnon the fairest Kriemhild / was the doughty Siegfried’s wife.",
        "354",
        "Then spake the mighty monarch: / “Full loving sister mine,\nThis may we ne’er accomplish / without help of thine.\nUnto Brunhild’s country / as suitor now we fare:\n’Tis fitting that ’fore ladies / we do rich apparel wear.”",
        "355",
        "Then spake the royal maiden: / “Brother dear to me,\nIn whatsoever manner / my help may given be,\nOf that I well assure you, / ready thereto am I.\nTo Kriemhild ’twere a sorrow / if any should the same deny.",
        "356",
        "“Of me, O noble brother, / thou shalt not ask in vain:\nCommand in courteous manner / and I will serve thee fain.\nWhatever be thy pleasure, / for that I’ll lend my aid\nAnd willingly I’ll do it,\" / spake the fair and winsome maid.",
        "357",
        "“It is our wish, dear sister, / apparel good to wear;\nThat shall now directing / the royal hand prepare;\nAnd let thy maids see to it / that all is done aright,\nFor we from this same journey / turn not aside for word of wight.”",
        "358",
        "Spake thereupon the maiden: / “Now mark ye what I say:\nMyself have silks in plenty; / now send us rich supply\nOf stones borne on bucklers, / so vesture we’ll prepare.\"\nTo do it royal Gunther / and Siegfried both right ready were.",
        "359",
        "“And who are your companions,\" / further questioned she,\n“Who with you apparelled / now for court shall be?\"\n“I it is and Siegfried, / and of my men are two,\nDankwart and Hagen, / who with us to court shall go.",
        "360",
        "“Now rightly what we tell thee, / mark, O sister dear:\n’Tis that we four companions / for four days may wear\nThrice daily change of raiment / so wrought with skilful hand\nThat we without dishonor / may take our leave of Brunhild’s land.”",
        "361",
        "After fair leave-taking / the knights departed so.\nThen of her attendants / thirty maids to go\nForth from her apartments / Kriemhild the princess bade,\nOf those that greatest cunning / in such skilful working had.",
        "362",
        "The silks that were of Araby / white as the snow in sheen,\nAnd from the land of Zazamank / like unto grass so green,\nWith stones of price they broidered; / that made apparel rare.\nHerself she cut them, Kriemhild / the royal maiden debonair.",
        "363",
        "Fur linings fashioned fairly / from dwellers in the sea\nBeheld by people rarely, / the best that e’er might be,\nWith silken stuffs they covered / for the knights to wear.\nNow shall ye of the shining / weeds full many a wonder hear.",
        "364",
        "From land of far Morocco / and eke from Libya\nOf silks the very finest / that ever mortal saw\nWith any monarch’s kindred, / they had a goodly store.\nWell showed the Lady Kriemhild / that unto them good will she bore.",
        "365",
        "Since they unto the journey / had wished that so it be,\nSkins of costly ermine / used they lavishly,\nWhereon were silken pieces / black as coal inlaid.\nTo-day were any nobles / in robes so fashioned well arrayed.",
        "366",
        "From the gold of Araby / many a stone there shone.\nThe women long were busy / before the work was done;\nBut all the robes were finished / ere seven weeks did pass,\nWhen also trusty armor / for the warriors ready was.",
        "367",
        "When they at length were ready / adown the Rhine to fare,\nA ship lay waiting for them / strong built with mickle care,\nWhich should bear them safely / far down unto the sea.\nThe maidens rich in beauty / plied their work laboriously.",
        "368",
        "Then ’twas told the warriors / for them was ready there\nThe finely wrought apparel / that they were to wear;\nJust as they had wished it, / so it had been made;\nAfter that the heroes / there by the Rhine no longer stayed.",
        "369",
        "To the knights departing / went soon a messenger:\nWould they come in person / to view their new attire,\nIf it had been fitted / short and long aright.\n’Twas found of proper measure, / and thanked those ladies fair each\n      knight.",
        "370",
        "And all who there beheld them / they must needs confess\nThat in the world they never / had gazed on fairer dress:\nAt court to wear th’ apparel / did therefore please them well.\nOf warriors better furnished / never could a mortal tell.",
        "371",
        "Thanks oft-times repeated / were there not forgot.\nLeave of parting from them / the noble knights then sought:\nLike thanes of noble bearing / they went in courteous wise.\nThen dim and wet with weeping / grew thereat two shining eyes.",
        "372",
        "She spake: “O dearest brother, / still here thou mightest stay,\nAnd woo another woman– / that were the better way–\nWhere so sore endangered / stood not thus thy life.\nHere nearer canst thou find thee / equally a high-born wife.”",
        "373",
        "I ween their hearts did tell them / what later came to pass.\nThey wept there all together, / whatever spoken was.\nThe gold upon their bosoms / was sullied ’neath the tears\nThat from their eyes in plenty / fell adown amid their fears.",
        "374",
        "She spake: “O noble Siegfried, / to thee commended be\nUpon thy truth and goodness / the brother dear to me,\nThat he come unscathed / home from Brunhild’s land.\"\nThat plighted the full valiant / knight in Lady Kriemhild’s hand.",
        "375",
        "The mighty thane gave answer: / “If I my life retain,\nThen shall thy cares, good Lady, / all have been in vain.\nAll safe I’ll bring him hither / again unto the Rhine,\nBe that to thee full sicker.\" / To him did the fair maid incline.",
        "376",
        "Their shields of golden color / were borne unto the strand,\nAnd all their trusty armor / was ready brought to hand.\nThey bade their horses bring them: / they would at last depart.\n–Thereat did fairest women / weep with sad foreboding heart.",
        "377",
        "Down from lofty casement / looked many a winsome maid,\nAs ship and sail together / by stirring breeze were swayed.\nUpon the Rhine they found them, / the warriors full of pride.\nThen outspake King Gunther: / “Who now is here the ship to guide?”",
        "378",
        "“That will I,” spake Siegfried; / “I can upon the flood\nLead you on in safety, / that know ye, heroes good;\nFor all the water highways / are known right well to me.\"\nWith joy they then departed / from the land of Burgundy.",
        "379",
        "A mighty pole then grasped he, / Siegfried the doughty man,\nAnd the ship from shore / forth to shove began.\nGunther the fearless also / himself took oar in hand.\nThe knights thus brave and worthy / took departure from the land.",
        "380",
        "They carried rich provisions, / thereto the best of wine\nThat might in any quarter / be found about the Rhine.\nTheir chargers stood in comfort / and rested by the way:\nThe ship it moved so lightly / that naught of injury had they.",
        "381",
        "Stretched before the breezes / were the great sail-ropes tight,\nAnd twenty miles they journeyed / ere did come the night,\nBy fair breezes favored / down toward the sea.\nTheir toil repaid thereafter / the dauntless knights full grievously.",
        "382",
        "Upon the twelfth morning, / as we in story hear,\nHad they by the breezes / thence been carried far,\nUnto Castle Isenstein / and Brunhild’s country:\nThat to Siegfried only / was known of all the company.",
        "383",
        "As soon as saw King Gunther / so many towers rise\nAnd eke the boundless marches / stretch before his eyes,\nHe spake: “Tell me, friend Siegfried, / is it known to thee\nWhose they are, the castles / and the majestic broad country?”",
        "384",
        "Thereto gave answer Siegfried: / “That well to me is known:\nBrunhild for their mistress / do land and people own\nAnd Isenstein’s firm towers, / as ye have heard me say.\nLadies fair a many / shall ye here behold to-day.",
        "385",
        "“And I will give you counsel: / be it well understood\nThat all your words must tally / –so methinks ’twere good.\nIf ere to-day is over / our presence she command,\nMust we leave pride behind us, / as before Brunhild we stand.",
        "386",
        "“When we the lovely lady / ’mid her retainers see,\nThen shall ye, good companions, / in all your speech agree\nThat Gunther is my master / and I his serving-man:\n’Tis thus that all he hopeth / shall we in the end attain.”",
        "387",
        "To do as he had bidden / consented straight each one,\nAnd spite of proudest spirit / they left it not undone.\nAll that he wished they promised, / and good it proved to be\nWhen anon King Gunther / the fair Brunhild came to see.",
        "388",
        "“Not all to meet thy wishes / do I such service swear,\nBut most ’tis for thy sister, / Kriemhild the maiden fair;\nJust as my soul unto me / she is my very life,\nAnd fain would I deserve it / that she in truth become my wife.”",
