        "A violent ringing of the bell awakened the concierge of number\nnine, avenue Hoche. She pulled the doorstring, grumbling:",
        "“I thought everybody was in. It must be three o’clock!”",
        "“Perhaps it is some one for the doctor,” muttered her husband.",
        "“Third floor, left. But the doctor won’t go out at night.”",
        "“He must go to-night.”",
        "The visitor entered the vestibule, ascended to the first floor, the\nsecond, the third, and, without stopping at the doctor’s door, he\ncontinued to the fifth floor. There, he tried two keys. One of\nthem fitted the lock.",
        "“Ah! good!” he murmured, “that simplifies the business wonderfully.\nBut before I commence work I had better arrange for my retreat.\nLet me see....have I had sufficient time to rouse the doctor\nand be dismissed by him? Not yet....a few minutes more.”",
        "At the end of ten minutes, he descended the stairs, grumbling\nnoisily about the doctor. The concierge opened the door for him\nand heard it click behind him. But the door did not lock, as the\nman had quickly inserted a piece of iron in the lock in such a\nmanner that the bolt could not enter. Then, quietly, he entered\nthe house again, unknown to the concierge. In case of alarm, his\nretreat was assured. Noiselessly, he ascended to the fifth floor\nonce more. In the antechamber, by the light of his electric\nlantern, he placed his hat and overcoat on one of the chairs, took\na seat on another, and covered his heavy shows with felt slippers.",
        "“Ouf! Here I am--and how simple it was! I wonder why more people do\nnot adopt the profitable and pleasant occupation of burglar. With\na little care and reflection, it becomes a most delightful\nprofession. Not too quiet and monotonous, of course, as it would\nthen become wearisome.”",
        "He unfolded a detailed plan of the apartment.",
        "“Let me commence by locating myself. Here, I see the vestibule in\nwhich I am sitting. On the street front, the drawing-room, the\nboudoir and dinning-room. Useless to waste any time there, as it\nappears that the countess has a deplorable taste....not a\nbibelot of any value!...Now, let’s get down to business!...\nAh! here is a corridor; it must lead to the bed chambers. At a\ndistance of three metres, I should come to the door of the\nwardrobe-closet which connects with the chamber of the countess.\"\nHe folded his plan, extinguished his lantern, and proceeded down\nthe corridor, counting his distance, thus:",
        "“One metre....two metres....three metres....Here is\nthe door....Mon Dieu, how easy it is! Only a small, simple bolt\nnow separates me from the chamber, and I know that the bolt is\nlocated exactly one metre, forty-three centimeters, from the floor.\nSo that, thanks to a small incision I am about to make, I can soon\nget rid of the bolt.”",
        "He drew from his pocket the necessary instruments. Then the\nfollowing idea occurred to him:",
        "“Suppose, by chance, the door is not bolted. I will try it first.”",
        "He turned the knob, and the door opened.",
        "“My brave Lupin, surely fortune favors you....What’s to be\ndone now? You know the situation of the rooms; you know the place\nin which the countess hides the black pearl. Therefore, in order\nto secure the black pearl, you have simply to be more silent than\nsilence, more invisible than darkness itself.”",
        "Arsene Lupin was employed fully a half-hour in opening the second\ndoor--a glass door that led to the countess’ bedchamber. But he\naccomplished it with so much skill and precaution, that even had\nhad the countess been awake, she would not have heard the slightest\nsound. According to the plan of the rooms, that he holds, he has\nmerely to pass around a reclining chair and, beyond that, a small\ntable close to the bed. On the table, there was a box of letter-\npaper, and the black pearl was concealed in that box. He stooped\nand crept cautiously over the carpet, following the outlines of the\nreclining-chair. When he reached the extremity of it, he stopped\nin order to repress the throbbing of his heart. Although he was\nnot moved by any sense of fear, he found it impossible to overcome\nthe nervous anxiety that one usually feels in the midst of profound\nsilence. That circumstance astonished him, because he had passed\nthrough many more solemn moments without the slightest trace of\nemotion. No danger threatened him. Then why did his heart throb\nlike an alarm-bell? Was it that sleeping woman who affected him?\nWas it the proximity of another pulsating heart?",
        "He listened, and thought he could discern the rhythmical breathing\nof a person asleep. It gave him confidence, like the presence of a\nfriend. He sought and found the armchair; then, by slow, cautious\nmovements, advanced toward the table, feeling ahead of him with\noutstretched arm. His right had touched one of the feet of the\ntable. Ah! now, he had simply to rise, take the pearl, and escape.\nThat was fortunate, as his heart was leaping in his breast like a\nwild beast, and made so much noise that he feared it would waken\nthe countess. By a powerful effort of the will, he subdued the\nwild throbbing of his heart, and was about to rise from the floor\nwhen his left hand encountered, lying on the floor, an object which\nhe recognized as a candlestick--an overturned candlestick. A moment\nlater, his hand encountered another object: a clock--one of those\nsmall traveling clocks, covered with leather.",
        "Well! What had happened? He could not understand. That\ncandlestick, that clock; why were those articles not in their\naccustomed placed? Ah! what had happened in the dread silence of\nthe night?",
        "Suddenly a cry escaped him. He had touched--oh! some strange,\nunutterable thing! “No! no!” he thought, “it cannot be. It is\nsome fantasy of my excited brain.” For twenty seconds, thirty\nseconds, he remained motionless, terrified, his forehead bathed\nwith perspiration, and his fingers still retained the sensation of\nthat dreadful contact.",
        "Making a desperate effort, he ventured to extend his arm again.\nOnce more, his hand encountered that strange, unutterable thing.\nHe felt it. He must feel it and find out what it is. He found\nthat it was hair, human hair, and a human face; and that face was\ncold, almost icy.",
        "However frightful the circumstances may be, a man like Arsene Lupin\ncontrols himself and commands the situation as soon as he learns\nwhat it is. So, Arsene Lupin quickly brought his lantern into use.\nA woman was lying before him, covered with blood. Her neck and\nshoulders were covered with gaping wounds. He leaned over her and\nmade a closer examination. She was dead.",
        "“Dead! Dead!” he repeated, with a bewildered air.",
        "He stared at those fixed eyes, that grim mouth, that livid flesh,\nand that blood--all that blood which had flowed over the carpet and\ncongealed there in thick, black spots. He arose and turned on the\nelectric lights. Then he beheld all the marks of a desperate\nstruggle. The bed was in a state of great disorder. One the\nfloor, the candlestick, and the clock, with the hands pointing to\ntwenty minutes after eleven; then, further away, an overturned\nchair; and, everywhere, there was blood, spots of blood and pools\nof blood.",
        "“And the black pearl?” he murmured.",
        "The box of letter-paper was in its place. He opened it, eagerly.\nThe jewel-case was there, but it was empty.",
        "“Fichtre!” he muttered. “You boasted of your good fortune much too\nsoon, my friend Lupin. With the countess lying cold and dead, and\nthe black pearl vanished, the situation is anything but pleasant.\nGet out of here as soon as you can, or you may get into serious\ntrouble.”",
        "Yet, he did not move.",
        "“Get out of here? Yes, of course. Any person would, except Arsene\nLupin. He has something better to do. Now, to proceed in an\norderly way. At all events, you have a clear conscience. Let us\nsuppose that you are the commissary of police and that you are\nproceeding to make an inquiry concerning this affair----Yes, but\nin order to do that, I require a clearer brain. Mine is muddled\nlike a ragout.”",
        "He tumbled into an armchair, with his clenched hands pressed\nagainst his burning forehead.",
        "The murder of the avenue Hoche is one of those which have recently\nsurprised and puzzled the Parisian public, and, certainly, I should\nnever have mentioned the affair if the veil of mystery had not been\nremoved by Arsene Lupin himself. No one knew the exact truth of\nthe case.",
        "Who did not know--from having met her in the Bois--the fair Leotine\nZalti, the once-famous cantatrice, wife and widow of the Count\nd’Andillot; the Zalti, whose luxury dazzled all Paris some twenty\nyears ago; the Zalti who acquired an European reputation for the\nmagnificence of her diamonds and pearls? It was said that she wore\nupon her shoulders the capital of several banking houses and the\ngold mines of numerous Australian companies. Skilful jewelers\nworked for Zelti as they had formerly wrought for kings and queens.\nAnd who does not remember the catastrophe in which all that wealth\nwas swallowed up? Of all that marvelous collection, nothing\nremained except the famous black pearl. The black pearl! That is\nto say a fortune, if she had wished to part with it.",
        "But she preferred to keep it, to live in a commonplace apartment\nwith her companion, her cook, and a man-servant, rather than sell\nthat inestimable jewel. There was a reason for it; a reason she\nwas not afraid to disclose: the black pearl was the gift of an\nemperor! Almost ruined, and reduced to the most mediocre\nexistence, she remained faithful to the companion of her happy and\nbrilliant youth. The black pearl never left her possession. She\nwore it during the day, and, at night, concealed it in a place\nknown to her alone.",
        "All these facts, being republished in the columns of the public\npress, served to stimulate curiosity; and, strange to say, but\nquite obvious to those who have the key to the mystery, the arrest\nof the presumed assassin only complicated the question and\nprolonged the excitement. Two days later, the newspapers published\nthe following item:",
        "“Information has reached us of the arrest of Victor Danegre, the\nservant of the Countess d’Andillot. The evidence against him is\nclear and convincing. On the silken sleeve of his liveried\nwaistcoat, which chief detective Dudouis found in his garret\nbetween the mattresses of his bed, several spots of blood were\ndiscovered. In addition, a cloth-covered button was missing from\nthat garment, and this button was found beneath the bed of the\nvictim.",
        "“It is supposed that, after dinner, in place of going to his own\nroom, Danegre slipped into the wardrobe-closet, and, through the\nglass door, had seen the countess hide the precious black pearl.\nThis is simply a theory, as yet unverified by any evidence. There\nis, also, another obscure point. At seven o’clock in the morning,\nDanegre went to the tobacco-shop on the Boulevard de Courcelles;\nthe concierge and the shop-keeper both affirm this fact. On the\nother hand, the countess’ companion and cook, who sleep at the end\nof the hall, both declare that, when they arose at eight o’clock,\nthe door of the antechamber and the door of the kitchen were\nlocked. These two persons have been in the service of the countess\nfor twenty years, and are above suspicion. The question is: How\ndid Danegre leave the apartment? Did he have another key? These\nare matters that the police will investigate.”",
        "As a matter of fact, the police investigation threw no light on the\nmystery. It was learned that Victor Danegre was a dangerous\ncriminal, a drunkard and a debauchee. But, as they proceeded with\nthe investigation, the mystery deepened and new complications\narose. In the first place, a young woman, Mlle. De Sincleves, the\ncousin and sole heiress of the countess, declared that the\ncountess, a month before her death, had written a letter to her and\nin it described the manner in which the black pearl was concealed.\nThe letter disappeared the day after she received it. Who had\nstolen it?",
        "Again, the concierge related how she had opened the door for a\nperson who had inquired for Doctor Harel. On being questioned, the\ndoctor testified that no one had rung his bell. Then who was that\nperson? And accomplice?",
        "The theory of an accomplice was thereupon adopted by the press and\npublic, and also by Ganimard, the famous detective.",
        "“Lupin is at the bottom of this affair,” he said to the judge.",
        "“Bah!” exclaimed the judge, “you have Lupin on the brain. You see\nhim everywhere.”",
        "“I see him everywhere, because he is everywhere.”",
        "“Say rather that you see him every time you encounter something you\ncannot explain. Besides, you overlook the fact that the crime was\ncommitted at twenty minutes past eleven in the evening, as is shown\nby the clock, while the nocturnal visit, mentioned by the\nconcierge, occurred at three o’clock in the morning.”",
        "Officers of the law frequently form a hasty conviction as to the\nguilt of a suspected person, and then distort all subsequent\ndiscoveries to conform to their established theory. The deplorable\nantecedents of Victor Danegre, habitual criminal, drunkard and\nrake, influenced the judge, and despite the fact that nothing new\nwas discovered in corroboration of the early clues, his official\nopinion remained firm and unshaken. He closed his investigation,\nand, a few weeks later, the trial commenced. It proved to be slow\nand tedious. The judge was listless, and the public prosecutor\npresented the case in a careless manner. Under those circumstances,\nDanegre’s counsel had an easy task. He pointed out the defects and\ninconsistencies of the case for the prosecution, and argued that the\nevidence was quite insufficient to convict the accused. Who had made\nthe key, the indispensable key without which Danegre, on leaving the\napartment, could not have locked the door behind him? Who had ever\nseen such a key, and what had become of it? Who had seen the\nassassin’s knife, and where is it now?",
        "“In any event,” argued the prisoner’s counsel, “the prosecution\nmust prove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the prisoner\ncommitted the murder. The prosecution must show that the\nmysterious individual who entered the house at three o’clock in the\nmorning is not the guilty party. To be sure, the clock indicated\neleven o’clock. But what of that? I contend, that proves nothing.\nThe assassin could turn the hands of the clock to any hour he\npleased, and thus deceive us in regard to the exact hour of the\ncrime.”",
        "Victor Danegre was acquitted.",
        "He left the prison on Friday about dusk in the evening, weak and\ndepressed by his six months’ imprisonment. The inquisition, the\nsolitude, the trial, the deliberations of the jury, combined to\nfill him with a nervous fear. At night, he had been afflicted with\nterrible nightmares and haunted by weird visions of the scaffold.\nHe was a mental and physical wreck.",
        "Under the assumed name of Anatole Dufour, he rented a small room on\nthe heights of Montmartre, and lived by doing odd jobs wherever he\ncould find them. He led a pitiful existence. Three times, he\nobtained regular employment, only to be recognized and then\ndischarged. Sometimes, he had an idea that men were following him--\ndetectives, no doubt, who were seeking to trap and denounce him.\nHe could almost feel the strong hand of the law clutching him by\nthe collar.",
        "One evening, as he was eating his dinner at a neighboring\nrestaurant, a man entered and took a seat at the same table. He\nwas a person about forty years of age, and wore a frock-coat of\ndoubtful cleanliness. He ordered soup, vegetables, and a bottle of\nwine. After he had finished his soup, he turned his eyes on\nDanegre, and gazed at him intently. Danegre winced. He was\ncertain that this was one of the men who had been following him for\nseveral weeks. What did he want? Danegre tried to rise, but\nfailed. His limbs refused to support him. The man poured himself\na glass of wine, and then filled Danegre’s glass. The man raised\nhis glass, and said:",
        "“To your health, Victor Danegre.”",
        "Victor started in alarm, and stammered:",
        "“I!....I!....no, no....I sweat to you....”",
        "“You will swear what? That you are not yourself? The servant of\nthe countess?”",
        "“What servant? My name is Dufour. Ask the proprietor.”",
        "“Yes, Anatole Dufour to the proprietor of this restaurant, but\nVictor Danegre to the officers of the law.”",
        "“That’s not true! Some one has lied to you.”",
        "The new-comer took a card from his pocket and handed it to Victor,\nwho read on it: “Grimaudan, ex-inspector of the detective force.\nPrivate business transacted.” Victor shuddered as he said:",
        "“You are connected with the police?”",
        "“No, not now, but I have a liking for the business and I continue\nto work at it in a manner more--profitable. From time to time I\nstrike upon a golden opportunity--such as your case presents.”",
        "“My case?”",
        "“Yes, yours. I assure you it is a most promising affair, provided\nyou are inclined to be reasonable.”",
        "“But if I am not reasonable?”",
        "“Oh! my good fellow, you are not in a position to refuse me\nanything I may ask.”",
        "“What is it....you want?” stammered Victor, fearfully.",
        "“Well, I will inform you in a few words. I am sent by Mademoiselle\nde Sincleves, the heiress of the Countess d’Andillot.”",
        "“What for?”",
        "“To recover the black pearl.”",
        "“Black pearl?”",
        "“That you stole.”",
        "“But I haven’t got it.”",
        "“You have it.”",
        "“If I had, then I would be the assassin.”",
        "“You are the assassin.”",
        "Danegre showed a forced smile.",
        "“Fortunately for me, monsieur, the Assizecourt was not of your\nopinion. The jury returned an unanimous verdict of acquittal. And\nwhen a man had a clear conscience and twelve good men in his favor--\n“",
        "The ex-inspector seized him by the arm and said:",
        "“No fine phrases, my boy. Now, listen to me and weigh my words\ncarefully. You will find they are worthy of your consideration.\nNow, Danegre, three weeks before the murder, you abstracted the\ncook’s key to the servants’ door, and had a duplicate key made by a\nlocksmith named Outard, 244 rue Oberkampf.”",
        "“It’s a lie--it’s a lie!” growled Victor. “No person has seen that\nkey. There is no such key.”",
        "“Here it is.”",
        "After a silence, Grimaudan continued:",
        "“You killed the countess with a knife purchased by you at the Bazar\nde la Republique on the same day as you ordered the duplicate key.\nIt has a triangular blade with a groove running from end to end.”",
        "“That is all nonsense. You are simply guessing at something you\ndon’t know. No one ever saw the knife.”",
        "“Here it is.”",
        "Victor Danegre recoiled. The ex-inspector continued:",
        "“There are some spots of rust upon it. Shall I tell you how they\ncame there?”",
        "“Well!....you have a key and a knife. Who can prove that they\nbelong to me?”",
        "“The locksmith, and the clerk from whom you bought the knife. I\nhave already refreshed their memories, and, when you confront them,\nthey cannot fail to recognize you.”",
        "His speech was dry and hard, with a tone of firmness and precision.\nDanegre was trembling with fear, and yet he struggled desperately\nto maintain an air of indifference.",
        "“Is that all the evidence you have?”",
        "“Oh! no, not at all. I have plenty more. For instance, after the\ncrime, you went out the same way you had entered. But, in the\ncentre of the wardrobe-room, being seized by some sudden fear, you\nleaned against the wall for support.”",
        "“How do you know that? No one could know such a thing,” argues the\ndesperate man.",
        "“The police know nothing about it, of course. They never think of\nlighting a candle and examining the walls. But if they had done\nso, they would have found on the white plaster a faint red spot,\nquite distinct, however, to trace in it the imprint of your thumb\nwhich you had pressed against the wall while it was wet with blood.\nNow, as you are well aware, under the Bertillon system, thumb-marks\nare one of the principal means of identification.”",
        "Victor Danegre was livid; great drops of perspiration rolled down\nhis face and fell upon the table. He gazed, with a wild look, at\nthe strange man who had narrated the story of his crime as\nfaithfully as if he had been an invisible witness to it. Overcome\nand powerless, Victor bowed his head. He felt that it was useless\nto struggle against this marvelous man. So he said:",
        "“How much will you give me, if I give you the pearl?”",
        "“Nothing.”",
        "“Oh! you are joking! Or do you mean that I should give you an\narticle worth thousands and hundreds of thousands and get nothing\nin return?”",
        "“You will get your life. Is that nothing?”",
        "The unfortunate man shuddered. Then Grimaudan added, in a milder\ntone:",
        "“Come, Danegre, that pearl has no value in your hands. It is quite\nimpossible for you to sell it; so what is the use of your keeping\nit?”",
        "“There are pawnbrokers....and, some day, I will be able to get\nsomething for it.”",
        "“But that day may be too late.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Because by that time you may be in the hands of the police, and,\nwith the evidence that I can furnish--the knife, the key, the thumb-\nmark--what will become of you?”",
        "Victor rested his head on his hands and reflected. He felt that he\nwas lost, irremediably lost, and, at the same time, a sense of\nweariness and depression overcame him. He murmured, faintly:",
        "“When must I give it to you?”",
        "“To-night---within an hour.”",
        "“If I refuse?”",
        "“If you refuse, I shall post this letter to the Procureur of the\nRepublic; in which letter Mademoiselle de Sincleves denounces you\nas the assassin.”",
        "Danegre poured out two glasses of wine which he drank in rapid\nsuccession, then, rising, said:",
        "“Pay the bill, and let us go. I have had enough of the cursed\naffair.”",
        "Night had fallen. The two men walked down the rue Lepic and\nfollowed the exterior boulevards in the direction of the Place de\nl’Etoile. They pursued their way in silence; Victor had a stooping\ncarriage and a dejected face. When they reached the Parc Monceau,\nhe said:",
        "“We are near the house.”",
        "“Parbleu! You only left the house once, before your arrest, and\nthat was to go to the tobacco-shop.”",
        "“Here it is,” said Danegre, in a dull voice.",
        "They passed along the garden wall of the countess’ house, and\ncrossed a street on a corner of which stood the tobacco-shop. A\nfew steps further on, Danegre stopped; his limbs shook beneath him,\nand he sank to a bench.",
        "“Well! what now?” demanded his companion.",
        "“It is there.”",
        "“Where? Come, now, no nonsense!”",
        "“There--in front of us.”",
        "“Where?”",
        "“Between two paving-stones.”",
        "“Which?”",
        "“Look for it.”",
        "“Which stones?”",
        "Victor made no reply.",
        "“Ah; I see!” exclaimed Grimaudan, “you want me to pay for the\ninformation.”",
        "“No....but....I am afraid I will starve to death.”",
        "“So! that is why you hesitate. Well, I’ll not be hard on you. How\nmuch do you want?”",
        "“Enough to buy a steerage pass to America.”",
        "“All right.”",
        "“And a hundred francs to keep me until I get work there.”",
        "“You shall have two hundred. Now, speak.”",
        "“Count the paving-stones to the right from the sewer-hole. The\npearl is between the twelfth and thirteenth.”",
        "“In the gutter?”",
        "“Yes, close to the sidewalk.”",
        "Grimaudan glanced around to see if anyone were looking. Some tram-\ncars and pedestrians were passing. But, bah, they will not suspect\nanything. He opened his pocketknife and thrust it between the\ntwelfth and thirteenth stones.",
        "“And if it is not there?” he said to Victor.",
        "“It must be there, unless someone saw me stoop down and hide it.”",
        "Could it be possible that the back pearl had been cast into the mud\nand filth of the gutter to be picked up by the first comer? The\nblack pearl--a fortune!",
        "“How far down?” he asked.",
        "“About ten centimetres.”",
        "He dug up the wet earth. The point of his knife struck something.\nHe enlarged the hole with his finger. Then he abstracted the black\npearl from its filthy hiding-place.",
        "“Good! Here are your two hundred francs. I will send you the\nticket for America.”",
        "On the following day, this article was published in the `Echo de\nFrance,’ and was copied by the leading newspapers throughout the\nworld:",
        " “Yesterday, the famous black pearl came into the possession of\n Arsene Lupin, who recovered it from the murderer of the Countess\n d’Andillot. In a short time, fac-similes of that precious jewel\n will be exhibited in London, St. Petersburg, Calcutta, Buenos Ayres\n and New York.",
        " “Arsene Lupin will be pleased to consider all propositions\n submitted to him through his agents.”",
        "“And that is how crime is always punished and virtue rewarded,\"\nsaid Arsene Lupin, after he had told me the foregoing history of\nthe black pearl.",
        "“And that is how you, under the assumed name of Grimaudan,\nex-inspector of detectives, were chosen by fate to deprive the\ncriminal of the benefit of his crime.”",
        "“Exactly. And I confess that the affair gives me infinite\nsatisfaction and pride. The forty minutes that I passed in the\napartment of the Countess d’Andillot, after learning of her death,\nwere the most thrilling and absorbing moments of my life. In those\nforty minutes, involved as I was in a most dangerous plight, I\ncalmly studied the scene of the murder and reached the conclusion\nthat the crime must have been committed by one of the house\nservants. I also decided that, in order to get the pearl, that\nservant must be arrested, and so I left the wainscoat button; it\nwas necessary, also, for me to hold some convincing evidence of his\nguilt, so I carried away the knife which I found upon the floor,\nand the key which I found in the lock. I closed and locked the\ndoor, and erased the finger-marks from the plaster in the wardrobe-\ncloset. In my opinion, that was one of those flashes--”",
        "“Of genius,” I said, interrupting.",
        "“Of genius, if you wish. But, I flatter myself, it would not have\noccurred to the average mortal.
