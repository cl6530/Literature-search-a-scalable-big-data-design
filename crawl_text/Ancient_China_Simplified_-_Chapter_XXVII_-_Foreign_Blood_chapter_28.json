        "The history of China may be for our present purposes accordingly\nsummed up as follows. The pure Chinese race from time immemorial\nhad been confined to the flat lands of the Yellow River, and its\none tributary on the south, the River Loh, the Tartars possessing\nmost of the left bank from the Desert to the sea. However, from\nthe beginning of really historical times the Chinese had been in\nunmistakable part-possession of the valleys of the Yellow River’s\ntwo great tributaries towards the west and north, the Wei (in Shen\nSi) and the Fen (in Shan Si). Little, if any, Chinese colonizing\nwas done much before the Ts’in conquests in any other parts of\nTartarland; none in Sz Ch’wan that we know of; little, if any,\nalong the coasts, except perhaps from Ts’i and Lu (in Shan Tung),\nboth of which states seem to have always been open to the sea,\nthough many barbarian coast tribes still required gathering into\nthe Chinese fold. The advance of Chinese civilization had been\nfirst down the Yellow River; then down the River Han towards the\nMiddle Yang-tsz; and lastly, down the canals and the Hwai network\nof streams to the Shanghai coast. Old colonies of Chinese had,\nmany centuries before the conquest of China by the Chou dynasty,\nevidently set out to subdue or to conciliate the southern tribes:\nthese adventurous leaders had naturally taken Chinese ideas with\nthem, but had usually found it easier for their own safety\nand success to adopt barbarian customs in whole or in part. These\nmixed or semi-Chinese states of the navigable Yang-tsz Valley,\nfrom the Ich’ang gorges to the sea, had generally developed in\nisolation and obscurity, and only appeared in force as formidable\ncompetitors with orthodox Chinese when the imperial power began to\ncollapse after 771 B.C. The isolation of half-Roman Britain for\nseveral centuries after the first Roman conquest, and the\ndeparture of the last Roman legions, may be fitly compared with\nthe position of the half-Chinese states. Ts’u, Wu, and Yueeh all\nhad pedigrees, more or less genuine, vying in antiquity with the\npedigree of the imperial Chou family; and therefore they did not\nsee why they also should not aspire to the overlordship when it\nappeared to be going a-begging. Even orthodox Tsin and Ts’i in\nthe north and north-east were in a sense colonial extensions,\ninasmuch as they were governed by new families appointed thereto\nby the Chou dynasty in 1122 B.C., in place of the old races of\nrulers, presumably more or less barbarian, who had previously to\n1122 B.C. been vassal–in name at least–to the earlier imperial\nHia and Shang dynasties: but these two great states were never\nconsidered barbarian under Chou sway; and, indeed, some of the\nmost ancient mythological Chinese emperors anterior to the Hia\ndynasty had their capitals in Tsin and Lu, on the River Fen and\nthe River Sz.",
        "It is not easy to define the exact amount of “foreignness” in\nTs’u. One unmistakable non-Chinese expression is given; that is\nkou-u-du, or “suckled by a tigress.” Then, again, the syllable\nngao occurs phonetically in many titles and in native personal\nnames, such as jo-ngao, tu-ngao, kia-ngao, mo-ngao.\nThere are no Ts’u songs in the Odes as edited by Confucius,  and\nthe Ts’u music is historically spoken of as being “in the southern\nsound\"; which may refer, it is true, to the accent, but also possibly\nto a strange language. The Ts’u name for “Annals,” or history, was\nquite different from the terms used in Tsin and Lu, respectively;\nand the Ts’u word for a peculiar form of lameness, or locomotor\nataxy, is said to differ from the expressions used in either Wei and\nTs’i. So far aspossible, all Ts’u dignities were kept in the royal family,\nand the king’s uncle was usually premier. The premier of Ts’u was\ncalled Zing-yin, a term unknown to federal China; and Ts’u\nconsidered the left-hand side more honourable than the right,\nwhich at that time was not the case in China proper, though it is\nnow. The “Borough-English” rule of succession in Ts’u was to give\nit to one of the younger sons; this statement is repeated in\npositive terms by Shuh Hiang, the luminous statesman of Tsin, and\nwill be further illustrated when we come to treat of that subject\nspecially. The Lu rule was “son after father; or, if none, then\nyounger after eldest brother; if the legitimate heir dies, then\nnext son by the same mother; failing which, the eldest son by any\nmother; if equal claims, then the wisest; if equally wise, cast\nlots”: Lu rules would probably hold good for all federal China,\nbecause the Duke of Chou, founder of Lu, was the chief moral force\nin the original Chou administration. In the year 587 Lu, when\ncoquetting between Tsin and Ts’u, was at last persuaded not to\nabandon Tsin for Ts’u, “who is not of our family, and can never\nhave any real affection.” Once in Tsin it was asked, about a\nprisoner: “Who is that southernhatted fellow?” It was explained\nthat he was a Ts’u man. They then handed him a guitar, and made\nhim sing some “national songs.” In 597 a Ts’u envoy to the Tsin\nmilitary durbar said: “My prince is not formed for the fine and\ndelicate manners of the Chinese”: here is distinct evidence of\nsocial if not ethnological cleaving. The Ts’u men had beards,\nwhilst those of Wu were not hirsute: this statement proves that\nthe two barbarian populations differed between themselves. In 635\nthe King of Ts’u spoke of himself as “the unvirtuous” and the\n“royal old man\"–designations both appropriate only to barbarians\nunder Chinese ritual. In 880 B.C., when the imperial power was\nalready waning, and the first really historical King of Ts’u was\nbeginning to bring under his authority the people between the Han\nand the Yang-tsz, he said: “I am a barbarian savage, and do not\nconcern myself with Chinese titles, living or posthumous.” In 706,\nwhen the reigning king made his first conquest of a petty Chinese\nprincipality (North Hu Peh), he said again: “I am a barbarian\nsavage; all the vassals are in rebellion and attacking each other;\nI want with my poor armaments to see for myself how Chou governs,\nand to get a higher title.” On being refused, he said: “Do you\nforget my ancestor’s services to the father of the Chou founder?\"\nLater on, as has already been mentioned, he put in a claim for the\nNine Tripods because of the services his ancestor, “living in rags\nin the Jungle, exposed to the weather,” had rendered to the\nfounder himself. In 637, when the future Second Protector and\nruler of Tsin visited Ts’u as a wanderer, the King of Ts’u\nreceived him with all the hospitalities “under the Chou rites,\"\nwhich fact shows at least an effort to adopt Chinese civilization.\nIn 634 Lu asked Ts’u’s aid against Ts’i, a proceeding condemned by\nthe historical critics on the ground that Ts’u was a “barbarian\nsavage” state. On the other hand, by the year 560 the dying King\nof Ts’u was eulogized as a man who had successfully subdued the\nbarbarian savages. But against this, again, in 544 the ruler of Lu\nexpressed his content at having got safely back from his visit to\nTs’u, i.e. his visit to such an uncouth and distant court. Thus\nTs’u’s emancipation from “savagery” was gradual and of uncertain\ndate. In 489 the King of Ts’u declined to sacrifice to the Yellow\nRiver, on the ground that his ancestors had never presumed to\nconcern themselves with anything beyond the Han and Yang-tsz\nvalleys. Even Confucius, (then on his wanderings in the petty\nstate of CH’EN) declared his admiration at this, and said: “The\nKing of Ts’u is a sage, and understands the Great Way (tao).\"\nOn the other hand, only fifty years before this, when in 538 Ts’u,\nwith Tsin’s approval, first tried her hand at durbar work, the king\nwas horrified to hear from a fussy chamberlain (evidently orthodox)\nthat there were six different ways of receiving visitors according to\ntheir rank; so that Ts’u’s ritual decorum could not have been of\nvery long standing. The following year (537) a Tsin princess is\ngiven in marriage to Ts’u– a decidedly orthodox feather in Ts’u’s\ncap. Confucius affects a particular style in his history when he speaks\nof barbarians; thus an orthodox prince “beats” a barbarian, but “battles\"\nwith an orthodox equal. However, in 525, Ts’u and Wu “battle” together,\nthe commentator explaining that Ts’u is now “promoted” to battle\nrank, though the strict rule is that two barbarians, or China and\none barbarian, “beat” rather than “battle.” In 591 Confucius had\nalready announced the “end” of the King of Ts’u, not as such, but\nas federal viscount. Under ordinary circumstances “death” would\nhave been good enough: it is only in speaking of his own ruler’s\ndeath that the honorific word “collapse” is used. All these fine\ndistinctions, and many others like them, hold good for modern\nChinese. These (apparently to us) childish gradations in mere\nwording run throughout Confucius’ book; but we must remember that\nhis necessarily timid object was to “talk at” the wicked, and to\n“hint” at retribution. Even a German recorder of events would\nshrink from applying the word haben to the royal act of a\nHottentot King, for whom hat is more than good enough, without\nthe allergnaedigst. And we all remember Bismarck’s story of the\nway mouth-washes and finger-bowls were treated at Frankfurt by those\nabove and below the grade of serene highness. Toutes les vices et\ntoutes les moeurs sont respectables.",
        "In 531 the barbarian King of Ts’u is honoured by being “named” for\nenticing and murdering a “ruler of the central kingdoms.” The\npedants are much exercised over this, but as the federal prince in\nquestion was a parricide, he had a lupinum caput, and so\neven a savage could without outraging orthodox feelings wreak the\nlaw on him. On the other hand, in 526, when Ts’u enticed and\nkilled a mere barbarian prince, the honour of “naming” was\nwithheld. This delicate question will be further elucidated in the\nChapter on “Names.”",
        "It will be observed that none of the testimony brought forward\nhere to show that Ts’u was, in some undefined way, a non-Chinese\nstate is either clear or conclusive: its cumulative effect,\nhowever, certainly leaves a very distinct impression that ’there\nwas a profound difference of some sort both in race and in\nmanners, though we are as yet quite unable to say whether the bulk\nof the Ts’u population was Annamese, Shan, or Siamese; Lolo or\nNosu; Miao-tsz, Tibetan, or what. There is really no use in\nattempting to advance one step beyond the point to which we are\ncarried by specific evidence, either in this or in other matters.\nIt has been said that no great discovery was ever made without\nimagination, which may be true; but evidence and imagination must\nbe kept rigidly separate. What we may reasonably hope is that, by\ngradually ascertaining and sifting definite facts and data\ntouching ancient Chinese history, we shall at least avoid coming\nto wrong positive conclusions, even if the right negative ones are\npretty clearly indicated. It is better to leave unexplained\nmatters in suspense than to base conclusions upon speculative\nsubstructures which will not carry the weight set upon them.",
