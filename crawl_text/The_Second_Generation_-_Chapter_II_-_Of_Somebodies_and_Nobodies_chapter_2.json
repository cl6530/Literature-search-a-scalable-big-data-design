        "At the second turning Arthur rounded the tandem out of Jefferson Street\ninto Willow with a skill that delighted both him and his sister. “But why\ngo that way?” said she. “Why not through Monroe street? I’m sure the\nhorses would behave.”",
        "“Better not risk it,” replied Arthur, showing that he, too, had had, but\nhad rejected, the temptation to parade the crowded part of town. “Even if\nthe horses didn’t act up, the people might, they’re such jays.”",
        "Adelaide’s estimate of what she and her brother had acquired in the East\nwas as high as was his, and she had the same unflattering opinion of\nthose who lacked it. But it ruffled her to hear him call the home folks\njays–just as it would have ruffled him had she been the one to make the\nslighting remark. “If you invite people’s opinion,” said she, “you’ve no\nright to sneer at them because they don’t say what you wanted.”",
        "“But I’m not driving for show if you are,” he retorted, with a\ntestiness that was confession.",
        "“Don’t be silly,” was her answer. “You know you wouldn’t take all this\ntrouble on a desert island.”",
        "“Of course not,” he admitted, “but I don’t care for the opinion of any\nbut those capable of appreciating.”",
        "“And those capable of appreciating are only those who approve,” teased\nAdelaide. “Why drive tandem among these ’jays?’”",
        "“To keep my hand in,” replied he; and his adroit escape restored his\ngood humor.",
        "“I wish I were as free from vanity as you are, Arthur, dear,” said she.",
        "“You’re just as fond of making a sensation as I am,” replied he. “And,\nmy eye, Del! but you do know how.” This with an admiring glance at\nher most becoming hat with its great, gracefully draped chiffon veil,\nand at her dazzling white dust-coat with its deep blue facings that\nmatched her eyes.",
        "She laughed. “Just wait till you see my new dresses–and hats.”",
        "“Another shock for your poor father.”",
        "“Shock of joy.”",
        "“Yes,” assented Arthur, rather glumly; “he’ll take anything off you.\nBut when I–”",
        "“It’s no compliment to me,” she cut in, the prompter to admit the truth\nbecause it would make him feel better. “He thinks I’m ’only a woman,’\nfit for nothing but to look pretty as long as I’m a girl, and then to\ndevote myself to a husband and children, without any life or even ideas\nof my own.”",
        "“Mother always seems cheerful enough,” said Arthur. His content with the\nchanged conditions which the prosperity and easy-going generosity of the\nelder generation were making for the younger generation ended at his own\nsex. The new woman–idle and frivolous, ignorant of all useful things,\nfit only for the show side of life and caring only for it, discontented\nwith everybody but her own selfish self–Arthur had a reputation among\nhis friends for his gloomy view of the American woman and for his courage\nin expressing it.",
        "“You are so narrow-minded, Artie!” his sister exclaimed impatiently.\n“Mother was brought up very differently from the way she and father have\nbrought me up–”",
        "“Have let you bring yourself up.”",
        "“No matter; I am different.”",
        "“But what would you do? What can a woman do?”",
        "“I don’t know,” she admitted. “But I do know I hate a humdrum life.\"\nThere was the glint of the Ranger will in her eyes as she added:\n“Furthermore, I shan’t stand for it.”",
        "He looked at her enviously. “You’ll be free in another year,” he said.\n“You and Ross Whitney will marry, and you’ll have a big house in Chicago\nand can do what you please and go where you please.”",
        "“Not if Ross should turn out to be the sort of man you are.”",
        "He laughed. “I can see Ross–or any man–trying to manage you! You’ve\ngot too much of father in you.”",
        "“But I’ll be dependent until–” Adelaide paused, then added a\nsatisfactorily vague, “for a long time. Father won’t give me anything.\nHow furious he’d be at the very suggestion of dowry. Parents out here\ndon’t appreciate that conditions have changed and that it’s necessary\nnowadays for a woman to be independent of her husband.”",
        "Arthur compressed his lips, to help him refrain from comment. But he felt\nso strongly on the subject that he couldn’t let her remarks pass\nunchallenged. “I don’t know about that, Del,” he said. “It depends on the\nwoman. Personally, I’d hate to be married to a woman I couldn’t control\nif necessary.”",
        "“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” cried Del, indignant. “Is thatyour idea of control–to make a woman mercenary and hypocritical? You’d\nbetter change your way of thinking if you don’t want Janet to be very\nunhappy, and yourself, too.”",
        "“That sounds well,” he retorted, “but you know better. Take our case, for\ninstance. Is it altogether love and affection that make us so cautious\nabout offending father?”",
        "“Speak for yourself,” said Adelaide. ’I’m not cautious.”",
        "“Do try to argue fair, even if you are a woman. You’re as cautious in\nyour way as I am in mine.”",
        "Adelaide felt that he was offended, and justly. “I didn’t mean quite what\nI said, Artie. You are cautious, in a way, and sometimes. But often\nyou’re reckless. I’m frightened every once in a while by it, and I’m\nhaunted by the dread that there’ll be a collision between father and you.\nYou’re so much alike, and you understand each other less and less, all\nthe time.”",
        "After a silence Arthur said, thoughtfully: “I think I understand him.\nThere are two distinct persons inside of me. There’s the one that was\nmade by inheritance and by my surroundings as a boy–the one that’s like\nhim, the one that enables me to understand him. Then, there’s this other\nthat’s been made since–in the East, and going round among people that\neither never knew the sort of life we had as children or have grown away\nfrom it. The problem is how to reconcile those two persons so that\nthey’ll stop wrangling and shaming each other. That’s my problem, I\nmean. Father’s problem–He doesn’t know he has one. I must do as he\nwishes or I’ll not be at all, so far as he is concerned.”",
        "Another and longer silence; then Adelaide, after an uneasy, affectionate\nlook at his serious profile, said: “I’m often ashamed of myself,\nArtie–about father; I don’t think I’m a hypocrite, for I do love him\ndearly. Who could help it, when he is so indulgent and when even in his\nanger he’s kind? But you–Oh, Artie, even though you are less, much less,\nuncandid with him than I am, still isn’t it more–more–less manly in\nyou? After all, I’m a woman and helpless; and, if I seriously offend him,\nwhat would become of me? But you’re a man. The world was made for men;\nthey can make their own way. And it seems unworthy of you to be afraid to\nbe yourself before anybody. And I’m sure it’s demoralizing.”",
        "She spoke so sincerely that he could not have resented it, even had her\nwords raised a far feebler echo within him. “I don’t honestly believe,\nDel, that my caution with father is from fear of his shutting down on me,\nany more than yours is,” he replied. “I know he cares for me. And often I\ndon’t let him see me as I am simply because it’d hurt him if he knew how\ndifferently I think and feel about a lot of things.”",
        "“But are you right?–or is he?”",
        "Arthur did not answer immediately. He had forgotten his horses; they were\njogging along, heads down and “form” gone. “What do you think?” he\nfinally asked.",
        "“I–I can’t quite make up my mind.”",
        "“Do you think I ought to drudge and slave, as he has? Do you think I\nought to spend my life in making money, in dealing in flour? Isn’t there\nsomething better than that?”",
        "“I don’t think it’s what a man deals in; I think it’s how he deals.\nAnd I don’t believe there’s any sort of man finer and better than\nfather, Arthur.”",
        "“That’s true,” he assented warmly. “I used to envy the boys at\ncollege–some of them–because their fathers and mothers had so much\nculture and knowledge of the world. But when I came to know their\nparents better–and them, too–I saw how really ignorant and\nvulgar–yes, vulgar–they were, under their veneer of talk and manner\nwhich they thought was everything. ’They may be fit to stand before\nkings’ I said to myself, ’but my father is a king–and of a sort they\nain’t fit to stand before.’”",
        "The color was high in Del’s cheeks and her eyes were brilliant. “You’ll\ncome out all right, Artie,” said she. “I don’t know just how, but you’ll\ndo something, and do it well.”",
        "“I’d much rather do nothing–well,” said he lightly, as if not sure\nwhether he was in earnest or not. “It’s so much nicer to dream than to\ndo.” He looked at her with good-humored satire. “And you–what’s the\nmatter with your practising some of the things you preach? Why don’t you\nmarry–say, Dory Hargrave, instead of Ross?”",
        "She made a failure of a stout attempt to meet his eyes and to smile\neasily. “Because I don’t love Dory Hargrave,” she said.",
        "“But you wouldn’t let yourself if you could–would you, now?”",
        "“It’s a poor love that lags for let,” she replied. “Besides, why talk\nabout me? I’m ’only a woman.’ I haven’t any career, or any chance to\nmake one.”",
        "“But you might help some man,” he teased.",
        "“Then you’d like me to marry Dory–if I could?”",
        "“I’m just showing you how vain your theorizing is,” was his not\naltogether frank reply. “You urge me to despise money when you\nyourself–”",
        "“That isn’t fair, Arthur. If I didn’t care for Ross I shouldn’t think of\nmarrying him, and you know it.”",
        "“He’s so like father!” mocked Arthur.",
        "“No, but he’s so like you,” she retorted. “You know he was your ideal\nfor years. It was your praising him that–that first made me glad to do\nas father and mother wished. You know father approves of him.”",
        "Arthur grinned, and Del colored. “A lot father knows about Ross as he\nreally is,” said he. “Oh, he’s clever about what he lets father see.\nHowever, you do admit there’s some other ideal of man than successful\nworkingman.”",
        "“Of course!” said Adelaide. “I’m not so silly and narrow as you try to\nmake out. Only, I prefer a combination of the two. And I think Ross is\nthat, and I hope and believe he’ll be more so–afterwards.”",
        "Adelaide’s tone was so judicial that Arthur thought it discreet not to\ndiscuss his friend and future brother-in-law further. “He isn’t good\nenough for Del,” he said to himself. “But, then, who is? And he’ll\nhelp her to the sort of setting she’s best fitted for. What side\nthey’ll put on, once they get going! She’ll set a new pace–and it’ll\nbe a grand one.”",
        "At the top of the last curve in the steep road up from Deer Creek the\nhorses halted of themselves to rest; Arthur and his sister gazed out upon\nthe vast, dreamy vision–miles on miles of winding river shimmering\nthrough its veil of silver mist, stately hills draped in gauziest blue.\nIt was such uplifting vistas that inspired the human imagination, in the\ndays of its youth, to breathe a soul into the universe and make it a\nliving thing, palpitant with love and hope; it was an outlook that would\nhave moved the narrowest, the smallest, to think in the wide and the\nlarge. Wherever the hills were not based close to the water’s edge or\nrose less abruptly, there were cultivated fields; and in each field, far\nor near, men were at work. These broad-hatted, blue-shirted toilers in\nthe ardent sun determined the turn of Adelaide’s thoughts.",
        "“It doesn’t seem right, does it,” said she, “that so many–almost\neverybody–should have to work so hard just to get enough to eat and to\nwear and a place to sleep, when there’s so much of everything in the\nworld–and when a few like us don’t have to work at all and have much\nmore than they need, simply because one happened to be born in such or\nsuch conditions. I suppose it’s got to be so, but it certainly looks\nunjust–and silly.”",
        "“I’m not sure the workers haven’t the best of it,” replied Arthur. “They\nhave the dinner; we have only the dessert; and I guess one gets tired of\nonly desserts, no matter how great the variety.”",
        "“It’s a stupid world in lots of ways, isn’t it?”",
        "“Not so stupid as it used to be, when everybody said and thought it was\nas good as possible,” replied he. “You see, it’s the people in the world\nthat make it stupid. For instance, do you suppose you and I, or anybody,\nwould care for idling about and doing all sorts of things our better\njudgment tells us are inane, if it weren’t that most of our fellow-beings\nare stupid enough to admire and envy that sort of thing, and that we are\nstupid enough to want to be admired and envied by stupid people?”",
        "“Did you notice the Sandys’s English butler?” asked Adelaide.",
        "“Did I? I’ll bet he keeps every one in the Sandys family up to\nthe mark.”",
        "“That’s it,” continued Adelaide. “He’s a poor creature, dumb and\nignorant. He knows only one thing–snobbishness. Yet every one of us was\nin terror of his opinion. No doubt kings feel the same way about the\npeople around them. Always what’s expected of us–and by whom? Why, by\npeople who have little sense and less knowledge. They run the world,\ndon’t they?”",
        "“As Dory Hargrave says,” said her brother, “the only scheme for making\nthings better that’s worth talking about is raising the standards of the\nmasses because their standards are ours. We’ll be fools and unjust as\nlong as they’ll let us. And they’ll let us as long as they’re ignorant.”",
        "By inheritance Arthur and Adelaide had excellent minds, shrewd and with\nthat cast of humor which makes for justice of judgment by mocking at the\nsolemn frauds of interest and prejudice. But, as is often the case with\nthe children of the rich and the well-to-do, there had been no necessity\nfor either to use intellect; their parents and hirelings of various\ndegrees, paid with their father’s generously given money, had done their\nthinking for them. The whole of animate creation is as lazy as it dares\nbe, and man is no exception. Thus, the Ranger children, like all other\nnormal children of luxury, rarely made what would have been, for their\nfallow minds, the arduous exertion of real thinking. When their minds\nwere not on pastimes or personalities they were either rattling round in\ntheir heads or exchanging the ideas, real and reputed, that happened to\nbe drifting about, at the moment, in their “set.” Those ideas they and\ntheir friends received, and stored up or passed on with never a thought\nas to whether they were true or false, much as they used coins or notes\nthey took in and paid out. Arthur and Adelaide soon wearied of their\ngroping about in the mystery of human society–how little direct interest\nit had for them then! They drove on; the vision which had stimulated them\nto think vanished; they took up again those personalities about friends,\nacquaintances and social life that are to thinking somewhat as massage is\nto exercise–all the motions of real activity, but none of its spirit.\nThey stopped for two calls and tea on the fashionable Bluffs.",
        "When they reached home, content with tandem, drive, themselves, their\nfriends, and life in general, they found Hiram Ranger returned from work,\nthough it was only half-past five, and stretched on the sofa in the\nsitting room, with his eyes shut. At this unprecedented spectacle of\ninactivity they looked at each other in vague alarm; they were stealing\naway, when he called: “I’m not asleep.”",
        "His expression made Adelaide impulsively kneel beside him and gaze\nanxiously into his face. He smiled, roused himself to a sitting posture,\nwell concealing the effort the exertion cost him.",
        "“Your father’s getting old,” he said, hiding his tragedy of aching body\nand aching heart and impending doom in a hypocrisy of cheerfulness that\nwould have passed muster even had he not been above suspicion. “I’m not\nup to the mark of the last generation. Your grandfather was fifty when I\nwas born, and he didn’t die till I was fifty.”",
        "His face shadowed; Adelaide, glancing round for the cause, saw Simeon,\nhalf-sitting, half-standing in the doorway, humble apology on his\nweazened, whiskered face. He looked so like her memory-picture of her\ngrandfather that she burst out laughing. “Don’t be hard on the poor old\ngentleman, father,” she cried. “How can you resist that appeal? Tell him\nto come in and make himself at home.”",
        "As her father did not answer, she glanced at him. He had not heard her;\nhe was staring straight ahead with an expression of fathomless\nmelancholy. The smile faded from her face, from her heart, as the light\nfades before the oncoming shadow of night. Presently he was\nabsent-mindedly but tenderly stroking her hair, as if he were thinking of\nher so intensely that he had become unconscious of her physical presence.\nThe apparition of Simeon had set him to gathering in gloomy assembly a\nvast number of circumstances about his two children; each circumstance\nwas so trivial in itself that by itself it seemed foolishly\ninconsequential; yet, in the mass, they bore upon his heart, upon his\nconscience, so heavily that his very shoulders stooped with the weight.\n“Put your house in order,” the newcomer within him was solemnly warning;\nand Hiram was puzzling over his meaning, was dreading what that meaning\nmight presently reveal itself to be. “Put my house in order?” muttered\nHiram, an inquiring echo of that voice within.",
        "“What did you say, father?” asked Adelaide, timidly laying her hand on\nhis arm. Though she knew he was simple, she felt the vastness in him that\nwas awe-inspiring–just as a mountain or an ocean, a mere aggregation of\nsimple matter, is in the total majestic and incomprehensible. Beside him,\nthe complex little individualities among her acquaintances seemed like\nthe acrostics of a children’s puzzle column.",
        "“Leave me with your brother awhile,” he said.",
        "She glanced quickly, furtively at Arthur and admired his\nself-possession–for she knew his heart must be heavier than her own. She\nrose from her knees, laid her hand lingeringly, appealingly upon her\nfather’s broad shoulder, then slowly left the room. Simeon, forgotten,\nlooked up at her and scratched his head; he turned in behind her, caught\nthe edge of her skirt and bore it like a queen’s page.",
        "The son watched the father, whose powerful features were set in an\nexpression that seemed stern only because his eyes were hid, gazing\nsteadily at the floor. It was the father who broke the silence. “What do\nyou calculate to do–now?”",
        "“Tutor this summer and have another go at those exams in September. I’ll\nhave no trouble in rejoining my class. I sailed just a little too close\nto the wind–that’s all.”",
        "“What does that mean?” inquired the father. College was a mystery to\nhim, a deeply respected mystery. He had been the youngest of four sons.\nTheir mother’s dream was the dream of all the mothers of those pioneer\nand frontier days–to send her sons to college. Each son in turn had,\nwith her assistance, tried to get together the sum–so small, yet so\nhugely large–necessary to make the start. But fate, now as sickness,\nnow as crop failure, now as flood, and again as war, had been too\nstrong for them. Hiram had come nearest, and his defeat had broken his\nmother’s heart and almost broken his own. It was therefore with a sense\nof prying into hallowed mysteries that he began to investigate his\nson’s college career.",
        "“Well, you know,” Arthur proceeded to explain; “there are five\ngrades–A, B, C, D, and E. I aimed for C, but several things came\nup–interfered–and I–just missed D.”",
        "“Is C the highest?”",
        "Arthur smiled faintly. “Well–not in one sense. It’s what’s called the\ngentleman’s grade. All the fellows that are the right sort are in\nit–or in D.”",
        "“And what did you get?”",
        "“I got E. That means I have to try again.”",
        "Hiram began to understand. So this was the hallowed mystery of higher\neducation. He was sitting motionless, his elbows on his knees, his big\nchest and shoulders inclined forward, his gaze fixed upon a wreath of red\nroses in the pattern of the moquette carpet–that carpet upon which\nAdelaide, backed by Arthur, had waged vain war as the worst of the many,\nto cultured nerves, trying exhibitions of “primitive taste” in Ellen’s\nbest rooms. When Hiram spoke his lips barely opened and his voice had no\nexpression. His next question was: “What does A mean?”",
        "“The A men are those that keep their noses in their books. They’re a\nnarrow set–have no ideas–think the book side is the only side of a\ncollege education.”",
        "“Then you don’t go to college to learn what’s in the books?”",
        "“Oh, of course, the books are part of it. But the real thing is\nassociation–the friendships one makes, the knowledge of human nature and\nof–of life.”",
        "“What does that mean?”",
        "Arthur had been answering Hiram’s questions in a flurry, though he had\nbeen glib enough. He had had no fear that his father would appreciate\nthat he was getting half-truths, or, rather, truths prepared skillfully\nfor paternal consumption; his flurry had come from a sense that he was\nhimself not doing quite the manly, the courageous thing. Now, however,\nsomething in the tone of the last question, or, perhaps, some element\nthat was lacking, roused in him a suspicion of depth in his simple\nunworldly father; and swift upon this awakening came a realization that\nhe was floundering in that depth–and in grave danger of submersion. He\nshifted nervously when his father, without looking up and without putting\nany expression into his voice, repeated: “What do you mean by\nassociations–and life–and–all that?”",
        "“I can’t explain exactly,” replied Arthur. “It would take a long time.”",
        "“I haven’t asked you to be brief.”",
        "“I can’t put it into words.”",
        "“Why not?”",
        "“You would misunderstand.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "Arthur made no reply.",
        "“Then you can’t tell me what you go to college for?”",
        "Again the young man looked perplexedly at his father. There was no anger\nin that tone–no emotion of any kind. But what was the meaning of the\nlook, the look of a sorrow that was tragic?",
        "“I know you think I’ve disgraced you, father, and myself,” said Arthur.\n“But it isn’t so–really, it isn’t. No one, not even the faculty, thinks\nthe less of me. This sort of thing often occurs in our set.”",
        "“Your ’set’?”",
        "“Among the fellows I travel with. They’re the nicest men in Harvard.\nThey’re in all the best clubs–and lead in supporting the athletics\nand–and–their fathers are among the richest, the most distinguished men\nin the country. There are only about twenty or thirty of us, and we make\nthe pace for the whole show–the whole university, I mean. Everybody\nadmires and envies us–wants to be in our set. Even the grinds look up to\nus, and imitate us as far as they can. We give the tone to the\nuniversity!”",
        "“What is ’the tone’?”",
        "Again Arthur shifted uneasily. “It’s hard to explain that sort of\nthing. It’s a sort of–of manner. It’s knowing how to do the–the right\nsort of thing.”",
        "“What is the right sort of thing?”",
        "“I can’t put it into words. It’s what makes you look at one man and say,\n’He’s a gentleman’; and look at another and see that he isn’t.”",
        "“What is a ’gentleman’–at Harvard?”",
        "“Just what it is anywhere.”",
        "“What is it anywhere?”",
        "Again Arthur was silent.",
        "“Then there are only twenty or thirty gentlemen at Harvard? And the\ncatalogue says there are three thousand or more students.”",
        "“Oh–of course,” began Arthur. But he stopped short.",
        "How could he make his father, ignorant of “the world” and dominated by\nprimitive ideas, understand the Harvard ideal? So subtle and evanescent,\nso much a matter of the most delicate shadings was this ideal that he\nhimself often found the distinction quite hazy between it and that which\nlooked disquietingly like “tommy rot.”",
        "“And these gentlemen–these here friends of yours–your ’set,’ as you\ncall ’em–what are they aiming for?”",
        "Arthur did not answer. It would be hopeless to try to make Hiram Ranger\nunderstand, still less tolerate, an ideal of life that was elegant\nleisure, the patronage of literature and art, music, the drama, the turf,\nand the pursuit of culture and polite extravagance, wholly aloof from the\nfrenzied and vulgar jostling of the market place.",
        "With a mighty heave of the shoulders which, if it had found outward\nrelief, would have been a sigh, Hiram Ranger advanced to the hard part of\nthe first task which the mandate, “Put your house in order,” had set for\nhim. He took from the inside pocket of his coat a small bundle of papers,\nthe records of Arthur’s college expenses. The idea of accounts with his\nchildren had been abhorrent to him. The absolute necessity of business\nmethod had forced him to make some records, and these he had expected to\ndestroy without anyone but himself knowing of their existence. But in the\nnew circumstances he felt he must not let his own false shame push the\nyoung man still farther from the right course. Arthur watched him open\neach paper in the bundle slowly, spread it out and, to put off the\nhateful moment for speech, pretend to peruse it deliberately before\nlaying it on his knee; and, dim though the boy’s conception of his father\nwas, he did not misjudge the feelings behind that painful reluctance.\nHiram held the last paper in a hand that trembled. He coughed, made\nseveral attempts to speak, finally began: “Your first year at Harvard,\nyou spent seventeen hundred dollars. Your second year, you spent\nfifty-three hundred. Last year–Are all your bills in?”",
        "“There are a few–” murmured Arthur.",
        "“How much?”",
        "He flushed hotly.",
        "“Don’t you know?” With this question his father lifted his eyes without\nlifting his shaggy eyebrows.",
        "“About four or five thousand–in all–including the tailors and other\ntradespeople.”",
        "A pink spot appeared in the left cheek of the old man–very bright\nagainst the gray-white of his skin. Somehow, he did not like that word\n“tradespeople,” though it seemed harmless enough. “This last year, the\ntotal was,” said he, still monotonously, “ninety-eight hundred odd–if\nthe bills I haven’t got yet ain’t more than five thousand.”",
        "“A dozen men spend several times that much,” protested Arthur.",
        "“What for?” inquired Hiram.",
        "“Not for dissipation, father,” replied the young man, eagerly.\n“Dissipation is considered bad form in our set.”",
        "“What do you mean by dissipation?”",
        "“Drinking–and–all that sort of thing,” Arthur replied. “It’s considered\nungentlemanly, nowadays–drinking to excess, I mean.”",
        "“What do you spend the money for?”",
        "“For good quarters and pictures, and patronizing the sports, and\nclub dues, and entertainments, and things to drive in–for living as\na man should.”",
        "“You’ve spent a thousand, three hundred dollars for tutoring since you’ve\nbeen there.”",
        "“Everybody has to do tutoring–more or less.”",
        "“What did you do with the money you made?”",
        "“What money, father?”",
        "“The money you made tutoring. You said everybody had to do tutoring. I\nsuppose you did your share.”",
        "Arthur did not smile at this “ignorance of the world\"; he grew red, and\nstammered: “Oh, I meant everybody in our set employs tutors.”",
        "“Then who does the tutoring? Who’re the nobodies that tutor the\neverybodies?”",
        "Arthur grew cold, then hot. He was cornered, therefore roused. He stood,\nleaned against the table, faced his father defiantly. “I see what you’re\ndriving at, father,” he said. “You feel I’ve wasted time and money at\ncollege, because I haven’t lived like a dog and grubbed in books day in\nand day out, and filled my head with musty stuff; because I’ve tried to\nget what I believe to be the broadest knowledge and experience; because\nI’ve associated with the best men, the fellows that come from the good\nfamilies. You accept the bluff the faculty puts up of pretending the A\nfellows are really the A fellows, when, in fact, everybody there and all\nthe graduates and everyone everywhere who knows the world knows that the\nfellows in our set are the ones the university is proud of–the fellows\nwith manners and appearance and–”",
        "“The gentlemen,” interjected the father, who had not changed either his\nposition or his expression.",
        "“Yes–the gentlemen!” exclaimed Arthur. “There are other ideals of life\nbesides buying and selling.”",
        "“And working?” suggested Hiram.",
        "“Yes–and what you call working,” retorted Arthur, angry through and\nthrough. “You sent me East to college to get the education of a man in my\nposition.”",
        "“What is your position?” inquired Hiram–simply an inquiry.",
        "“Your son,” replied the young man; “trying to make the best use of the\nopportunities you’ve worked so hard to get for me. I’m not you, father.\nYou’d despise me if I didn’t have a character, an individuality, of my\nown. Yet, because I can’t see life as you see it, you are angry with me.”",
        "For answer Hiram only heaved his great shoulders in another suppressed\nsigh. He knew profoundly that he was right, yet his son’s\nplausibilities–they could only be plausibilities–put him clearly in the\nwrong. “We’ll see,” he said; “we’ll see. You’re wrong in thinking I’m\nangry, boy.” He was looking at his son now, and his eyes made his son’s\npassion vanish. He got up and went to the young man and laid his hand on\nhis shoulder in a gesture of affection that moved the son the more\nprofoundly because it was unprecedented. “If there’s been any wrong\ndone,” said the old man–and he looked very, very old now–\"I’ve done it.\nI’m to blame–not you.”",
        "A moment after Hiram left the room, Adelaide hurried in. A glance at her\nbrother reassured her. They stood at the window watching their father as\nhe walked up and down the garden, his hands behind his back, his\nshoulders stooped, his powerful head bent.",
        "“Was he very angry?” asked Del.",
        "“He wasn’t angry at all,” her brother replied. “I’d much rather he had\nbeen.” Then, after a pause, he added: “I thought the trouble between us\nwas that, while I understood him, he didn’t understand me. Now I know\nthat he has understood me but that I don’t understand him\"–and, after a\npause–\"or myself.”",
