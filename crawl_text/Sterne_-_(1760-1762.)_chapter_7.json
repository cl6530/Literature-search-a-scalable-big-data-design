        "Sterne alighted from the York mail, just as Byron “awoke one morning,\"\nto “find himself famous.” Seldom indeed has any lion so suddenly\ndiscovered been pursued so eagerly and by such a distinguished crowd\nof hunters. The chase was remarkable enough to have left a lasting\nimpression on the spectators; for it was several years after (in 1773)\nthat Dr. Johnson, by way of fortifying his very just remark that “any\nman who has a name or who has the power of pleasing will be generally\ninvited in London,” observed gruffly that “the man Sterne,” he was\ntold, “had had engagements for three months.” And truly it would\nappear from abundant evidence that “the man Sterne” gained such a\nsocial triumph as might well have turned a stronger head than his.\nWithin twenty-four hours after his arrival his lodgings in Pall Mall\nwere besieged by a crowd of fashionable visitors; and in a few weeks\nhe had probably made the acquaintance of “everybody who was anybody\"\nin the London society of that day.",
        "How thoroughly he relished the delights of celebrity is revealed, with\na simple vanity which almost disarms criticism, in many a passage\nof his correspondence. In one of his earliest letters to Miss\nFourmantelle we find him proudly relating to her how already he “was\nengaged to ten noblemen and men of fashion.” Of Garrick, who had\nwarmly welcomed the humourist whose merits he had been the first to\ndiscover, Sterne says that he had “promised him at dinner to numbers\nof great people.” Amongst these great people who sought him out for\nthemselves was that discerning patron of ability in every shape, Lord\nRockingham. In one of the many letters which Madame de Medalle flung\ndateless upon the world, but which from internal evidence we can\nassign to the early months of 1760, Sterne writes that he is about to\n“set off with a grand retinue of Lord Rockingham’s (in whose suite I\nmove) for Windsor” to witness, it should seem, an installation of\na Knight of the Garter. It is in his letters to Miss Fourmantelle,\nhowever, that his almost boyish exultation at his London triumph\ndiscloses itself most frankly. “My rooms,” he writes, “are filling\nevery hour with great people of the first rank, who strive who shall\nmost honour me.” Never, he believes, had such homage been rendered to\nany man by devotees so distinguished. “The honours paid me were the\ngreatest that were ever known from the great.”",
        "The self-painted portrait is not, it must be confessed, altogether\nan attractive one. It is somewhat wanting in dignity, and its air of\nover-inflated complacency is at times slightly ridiculous. But we must\nnot judge Sterne in this matter by too severe a standard. He was by\nnature neither a dignified nor a self-contained man: he had a head\nparticularly unfitted to stand sudden elevation; and it must be\nallowed that few men’s power of resisting giddiness at previously\nunexplored altitudes was ever so severely tried. It was not only “the\ngreat” in the sense of the high in rank and social distinction by\nwhom he was courted; he was welcomed also by the eminent in genius and\nlearning; and it would be no very difficult task for him to flatter\nhimself that it was the latter form of recognition which, he really\nvalued most. Much, at any rate, in the way of undue elation may be\nforgiven to a country clergyman who suddenly found himself the centre\nof a court, which was regularly attended by statesmen, wits, and\nleaders of fashion, and with whom even bishops condescended to open\ngracious diplomatic communication. “Even all the bishops,” he writes,\n“have sent their compliments;” and though this can hardly have been\ntrue of the whole Episcopal Bench, it is certain that Sterne received\nsomething more than a compliment from one bishop, who was a host in\nhimself. He was introduced by Garrick to Warburton, and received high\nencouragement from that formidable prelate.[1]",
        "[Footnote 1: It is admitted, moreover, in the correspondence with Miss\nFourmantelle that Sterne received something more substantial from the\nBishop, in the shape of a purse of gold; and this strange present gave\nrise to a scandal on which something will be said hereafter.]",
        "The year 1760, however, was to bring to Sterne more solid gains than\nthat of mere celebrity, or even than the somewhat precarious money\nprofits which depend on literary vogue. Only a few weeks after his\narrival in town he was presented by Lord Falconberg with the curacy of\nCoxwold, “a sweet retirement,” as he describes it, “in comparison of\nSutton,” at which he was in future to pass most of the time spent\nby him in Yorkshire. What obtained him this piece of preferment is\nunknown. It may be that Tristram Shandy drew the Yorkshire peer’s\nattention to the fact that there was a Yorkshireman of genius living\nwithin a few miles of a then vacant benefice in his lordship’s gift,\nand that this was enough for him. But Sterne himself says–in writing\na year or so afterwards to a lady of his acquaintance–\"I hope I have\nbeen of some service to his lordship, and he has sufficiently requited\nme;” and in the face of this plain assertion, confirmed as it is by\nthe fact that Lord Falconberg was on terms of friendly intimacy with\nthe Vicar of Coxwold at a much later date than this, we may dismiss\nidle tales about Sterne’s having “black-mailed” the patron out of a\npresentation to a benefice worth no more, after all, than some 70£ a\nyear net.",
        "There is somewhat more substance, however, in the scandal which got\nabroad with reference to a certain alleged transaction between Sterne\nand Warburton. Before Sterne had been many days in London, and while\nyet his person and doings were the natural subjects of the newest\ngossip, a story found its way into currency to the effect that the\nnew-made Bishop of Gloucester had found it advisable to protect\nhimself against the satiric humour of the author of the Tristram\nShandy by a substantial present of money. Coming to Garrick’s ears,\nit was repeated by him–whether seriously or in jest–to Sterne,\nfrom whom it evoked a curious letter, which in Madame de Medalle’s\ncollection has been studiously hidden away amongst the correspondence\nof seven years later. “’Twas for all the world,” he began, “like a cut\nacross my finger with a sharp pen-knife. I saw the blood–gave it a\nsuck, wrapt it up, and thought no more about it.... The story you told\nme of Tristram’s pretended tutor this morning\"–(the scandal was, that\nWarburton had been threatened with caricature in the next volume of\nthe novel, under the guise of the hero’s tutor)–\"this vile story, I\nsay, though I then saw both how and where it wounded, I felt little\nfrom it at first, or, to speak more honestly (though it ruins my\nsimile), I felt a great deal of pain from it, but affected an air,\nusual in such accidents, of feeling less than I had.” And he goes on\nto repudiate, it will be observed, not so much the moral offence of\ncorruption, in receiving money to spare Warburton, as the intellectual\nsolecism of selecting him for ridicule. “What the devil!” he\nexclaims, “is there no one learned blockhead throughout the schools\nof misapplied science in the Christian world to make a tutor of for\nmy Tristram–are we so run out of stock that there is no one\nlumber-headed, muddle-headed, mortar-headed, pudding-head chap amongst\nour doctors...but I must disable my judgment by choosing a Warburton?\"\nLater on, in a letter to his friend, Mr. Croft, at Stillington, whom\nthe scandal had reached through a “society journal” of the time, he\nasks whether people would suppose he would be “such a fool as to fall\nfoul of Dr. Warburton, my best friend, by representing him so weak a\nman; or by telling such a lie of him as his giving me a purse to buy\noff the tutorship of Tristram–or that I should be fool enough to own\nthat I had taken a purse for that purpose?” It will be remarked that\nSterne does not here deny having received a purse from Warburton,\nbut only his having received it by way of black-mail: and the most\nmysterious part of the affair is that Sterne did actually receive the\nstrange present of a “purse of gold” from Warburton (whom at that time\nhe did not know nor had ever seen); and that he admits as much in one\nof his letters to Miss Fourmantelle. “I had a purse of guineas given\nme yesterday by a Bishop,” he writes, triumphantly, but without\nvolunteering any explanation of this extraordinary gift. Sterne’s\nletter to Garrick was forwarded, it would seem, to Warburton; and the\nBishop thanks Garrick for having procured for him “the confutation of\nan impertinent story the first moment I heard of it.” This, however,\ncan hardly count for much. If Warburton had really wished Sterne to\nabstain from caricaturing him, he would be as anxious–and for much\nthe same reasons–to conceal the fact as to suppress the caricature.\nHe would naturally have the disclosure of it reported to Sterne\nfor formal contradiction, as in fulfilment of a virtual term in the\nbargain between them. The epithet of “irrevocable scoundrel,” which\nhe afterwards applied to Sterne, is of less importance, as proceeding\nfrom Warburton, than it would have been had it come from any one not\nhabitually employing Warburton’s peculiar vocabulary; but it at least\nargues no very cordial feeling on the Bishop’s side. And, on the\nwhole, one regrets to feel, as I must honestly confess that I do feel,\nfar less confident of the groundlessness of this rather unpleasant\nstory than could be wished. It is impossible to forget, however, that\nwhile the ethics of this matter were undoubtedly less strict in those\ndays than they are–or, at any rate, are recognized as being–in our\nown, there is nothing in Sterne’s character to make us suppose him to\nhave been at all in advance of the morality of his time.",
        "The incumbent-designate did not go down at once to take possession of\nhis temporalities. His London triumph had not yet run its course. The\nfirst edition of Vols. I. and II. of Tristram Shandy was exhausted\nin some three months. In April, Dodsley brought out a second; and,\nconcurrently with the advertisement of its issue, there appeared–in\nsomewhat incongruous companionship–the announcement, “Speedily will\nbe published, The Sermons of Mr. Yorick.” The judicious Dodsley, or\npossibly the judicious Sterne himself (acute enough in matters of\nthis kind), had perceived that now was the time to publish a series of\nsermons by the very unclerical lion of the day. There would–they,\nno doubt, thought–be an undeniable piquancy, a distinct flavour of\nsemi-scandalous incongruity in listening to the Word of Life from the\nlips of this loose-tongued droll; and the more staid and serious the\nsermon, the more effective the contrast. There need not have been\nmuch trouble in finding the kind of article required; and we may be\ntolerably sure that, even if Sterne did not perceive that fact for\nhimself, his publisher hastened to inform him that “anything would\ndo.” Two of his pulpit discourses, the Assize Sermon and the Charity\nSermon, had already been thought worthy of publication by their author\nin a separate form; and the latter of these found a place in the\nseries; while the rest seem to have been simply the chance sweepings\nof the parson’s sermon-drawer. The critics who find wit, eccentricity,\nflashes of Shandyism, and what not else of the same sort in these\ndiscourses, must be able–or so it seems to me–to discover these\nphenomena anywhere. To the best of my own judgment the Sermons\nare–with but few and partial exceptions–of the most commonplace\ncharacter; platitudinous with the platitudes of a thousand pulpits,\nand insipid with the crambe repetita of a hundred thousand homilies.\nA single extract will fully suffice for a specimen of Sterne’s\npre-Shandian homiletic style; his post-Shandian manner was very\ndifferent, as we shall see. The preacher is discoursing upon the\nwell-worn subject of the inconsistencies of human character:",
        "  “If such a contrast was only observable in the different stages of\n  a man’s life, it would cease to be either a matter of wonder or of\n  just reproach. Age, experience, and much reflection may naturally\n  enough be supposed to alter a man’s sense of things, and so entirely\n  to transform him that, not only in outward appearance but in the\n  very cast and turn of his mind, he may be as unlike and different\n  from the man he was twenty or thirty years ago as he ever was from\n  anything of his own species. This, I say, is naturally to be accounted\n  for, and in some cases might be praiseworthy too; but the observation\n  is to be made of men in the same period of their lives that in\n  the same day, sometimes on the very same action, they are utterly\n  inconsistent and irreconcilable with themselves. Look at the man in\n  one light, and he shall seem wise, penetrating, discreet, and brave;\n  behold him in another point of view, and you see a creature all over\n  folly and indiscretion, weak and timorous as cowardice and\n  indiscretion can make him. A man shall appear gentle, courteous,\n  and benevolent to all mankind; follow him into his own house,\n  maybe you see a tyrant morose and savage to all whose happiness\n  depends upon his kindness. A third, in his general behaviour,\n  is found to be generous, disinterested, humane, and friendly. Hear\n  but the sad story of the friendless orphans too credulously trusting\n  all their whole substance into his hands, and he shall appear more\n  sordid, more pitiless and unjust than the injured themselves have\n  bitterness to paint him. Another shall be charitable to the poor,\n  uncharitable in his censures and opinions of all the rest of the\n  world besides: temperate in his appetites, intemperate in his tongue;\n  shall have too much conscience and religion to cheat the man who\n  trusts him, and perhaps as far as the business of debtor and creditor\n  extends shall be just and scrupulous to the uttermost mite; yet in\n  matters of full or great concern, where he is to have the handling\n  of the party’s reputation and good name, the dearest, the tenderest\n  property the man has, he will do him irreparable damage, and rob him\n  there without measure or pity.\"–Sermon XI.–On Evil Speaking.",
        "There is clearly nothing particularly striking in all that, even\nconveyed as it is in Sterne’s effective, if loose and careless, style;\nand it is no unfair sample of the whole. The calculation, however, of\nthe author and his shrewd publisher was that, whatever the intrinsic\nmerits or demerits of these sermons, they would “take” on the strength\nof the author’s name; nor, it would seem, was their calculation\ndisappointed. The edition of this series of sermons now lying before\nme is numbered the sixth, and its date is 1764; which represents a\ndemand for a new edition every nine months or so, over a space of\nfour years. They may, perhaps, have succeeded, too, in partially\nreconciling a certain serious-minded portion of the public to the\nauthor. Sterne evidently hoped that they might; for we find him\nsending a copy to Warburton, in the month of June, immediately after\nthe publication of the book, and receiving in return a letter of\ncourteous thanks, and full of excellent advice as to the expediency\nof avoiding scandal by too hazardous a style of writing in the future.\nSterne, in reply, protests that he would “willingly give no offence to\nmortal by anything which could look like the least violation of either\ndecency or good manners;” but–and it is an important “but\"–he cannot\npromise to “mutilate everything” in Tristram “down to the prudish\nhumour of every particular” (individual), though he will do his best;\nbut, in any case, “laugh, my Lord, I will, and as loudly as I can.\"\nAnd laugh he did, and in such Rabelaisian fashion that the Bishop\n(somewhat inconsistently for a critic who had welcomed Sterne on\nthe appearance of the first two volumes expressly as the “English\nRabelais”) remarked of him afterwards with characteristic vigour, in\na letter to a friend, that he fears the fellow is an “irrevocable\nscoundrel.”",
        "The volumes, however, which earned “the fellow” this Episcopal\nbenediction were not given to the world till the next year. At the\nend of May or beginning of June, 1760, Sterne went to his new home\nat Coxwold, and his letters soon begin to show him to us at work upon\nfurther records of Mr. Shandy’s philosophical theory-spinning and the\nsimpler pursuits of his excellent brother. It is probable that this\nyear, 1760, was, on the whole, the happiest year of Sterne’s life.\nHis health, though always feeble, had not yet finally given way;\nand though the “vile cough” which was to bring him more than once to\ndeath’s door, and at last to force it open, was already troubling him,\nhe had that within him which made it easy to bear up against all\nsuch physical ills. His spirits, in fact, were at their highest. His\nworldly affairs were going at least as smoothly as they ever went.\nHe was basking in that sunshine of fame which was so delightful to a\ntemperament differing from that of the average Englishman, as does the\nphysique of the Southern races from that of the hardier children of\nthe North; and lastly, he was exulting in a new-born sense of creative\npower which no doubt made the composition of the earlier volumes of\nTristram a veritable labour of love.",
        "But the witty division of literary spinners into silkworms and\nspiders–those who spin because they are full, and those who do so\nbecause they are empty–is not exhaustive. There are human silk-worms\nwho become gradually transformed into spiders–men who begin writing\nin order to unburden a full imagination, and who, long after that\nprocess has been completely performed, continue writing in order to\nfill an empty belly; and though Sterne did not live long enough to\n“write himself out,” there are certain indications that he would\nnot have left off writing if and when he felt that this stage of\nexhaustion had arrived. His artistic impulses were curiously combined\nwith a distinct admixture of the “potboiler” spirit; and it was with\nsomething of the complacency of an annuitant that he looked forward to\ngiving the public a couple of volumes of Tristram Shandy every year\nas long as they would stand it. In these early days, however, there\nwas no necessity even to discuss the probable period either of the\nwriter’s inspiration or of the reader’s appetite. At present the\npublic were as eager to consume more Shandyism as Sterne was ready to\nproduce it: the demand was as active as the supply was easy. By the\nend of the year Vols. III. and IV. were in the press, and on January\n27, 1761, they made their appearance. They had been disposed of in\nadvance to Dodsley for 380_l.–no bad terms of remuneration in\nthose days; but it is still likely enough that the publisher made\na profitable bargain. The new volumes sold freely, and the public\nlaughed at them as heartily as their two predecessors. Their author’s\nvogue in London, whither he went in December, 1760, to superintend\npublication, was as great during the next spring as it had been in\nthe last. The tide of visitors again set in all its former force and\nvolume towards the “genteel lodgings.” His dinner list was once more\nfull, and he was feasted and flattered by wits, beaux, courtiers,\npoliticians, and titled-lady lion-hunters as sedulously as ever. His\nletters, especially those to his friends the Crofts, of Stillington,\nabound, as before, in touches of the same amusing vanity. With how\ndelicious a sense of self-importance must he have written these words:\n“You made me and my friends very merry with the accounts current at\nYork of my being forbad the Court, but they do not consider what a\nconsiderable person they make of me when they suppose either my going\nor not going there is a point that ever enters the K.’s head; and\nfor those about him, I have the honour either to stand so personally\nwell-known to them, or to be so well represented by those of the first\nrank, as to fear no accident of the kind.” Amusing, too, is it to note\nthe familiarity, as of an old habitué of Ministerial antechambers,\nwith which this country parson discusses the political changes of\nthat interesting year; though scarcely more amusing, perhaps, than the\nsolemnity with which his daughter disguises the identity of the new\nPremier under the title B––e; and by a similar use of initials\nattempts to conceal the momentous state secret that the D. of R. had\nbeen removed from the place of Groom of the Chambers, and that Sir\nF.D. had succeeded T. as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Occasionally,\nhowever, the interest of his letters changes from personal to public,\nand we get a glimpse of scenes and personages that have become\nhistorical. He was present in the House of Commons at the first grand\ndebate on the German war after the Great Commoner’s retirement from\noffice–\"the pitched battle,” as Sterne calls it, “wherein Mr. P.\nwas to have entered and thrown down the gauntlet” in defence of his\nmilitary policy. Thus he describes it:",
        "  “There never was so full a House–the gallery full to the top–I\n  was there all the day; when lo! a political fit of the gout seized the\n  great combatant–he entered not the lists. Beckford got up and\n  begged the House, as he saw not his right honourable friend there,\n  to put off the debate–it could not be done: so Beckford rose up\n  and made a most long, passionate, incoherent speech in defence of\n  the German war, but very severe upon the unfrugal manner it was\n  carried on, in which he addressed himself principally to the C[hancellor]\n  of the E[xchequer], and laid on him terribly.... Legge\n  answered Beckford very rationally and coolly. Lord K. spoke long.\n  Sir F. D[ashwood] maintained the German war was most pernicious....\n  Lord B[arrington] at last got up and spoke half an hour\n  with great plainness and temper, explained many hidden things relating\n  to these accounts in favour of the late K., and told two or\n  three conversations which had passed between the K. and himself\n  relative to these expenses, which cast great honour upon the K.’s\n  character. This was with regard to the money the K. had secretly\n  furnished out of his own pocket to lessen the account of the\n  Hanover-score brought us to discharge. Beckford and Barrington\n  abused all who fought for peace and joined in the cry for it,\n  and Beckford added that the reasons of wishing a peace now were\n  the same as at the Peace of Utrecht–that the people behind the\n  curtain could not both maintain the war and their places too, so\n  were for making another sacrifice of the nation to their own interests.\n  After all, the cry for a peace is so general that it will certainly\n  end in one.”",
        "And then the letter, recurring to personal matters towards the close,\nrecords the success of Vols. III. and IV.:",
        "“One half of the town abuse my book as bitterly as the other half cry\nit up to the skies–the best is they abuse and buy it, and at such a\nrate that we are going on with a second edition as fast as possible.\"\nThis was written only in the first week of March, so that the edition\nmust have been exhausted in little more than a month. It was, indeed,\nanother triumph; and all through this spring up to midsummer did\nSterne remain in London to enjoy it. But, with three distinct flocks\nawaiting a renewal of his pastoral ministrations in Yorkshire, it\nwould scarcely have done for him, even in those easy-going days of\nthe Establishment, to take up his permanent abode at the capital; and\nearly in July he returned to Coxwold.",
        "From the middle of this year, 1761, the scene begins to darken, and\nfrom the beginning of the next year onward Sterne’s life was little\nbetter than a truceless struggle with the disease to which he was\ndestined, prematurely, to succumb. The wretched constitution which,\nin common with his short-lived brothers and sisters, he had inherited\nprobably from his father, already began to show signs of breaking\nup. Invalid from the first, it had doubtless been weakened by the\nhardships of Sterne’s early years, and yet further, perhaps, by the\nexcitements and dissipations of his London life; nor was the change\nfrom the gaieties of the capital to hard literary labour in a country\nparsonage calculated to benefit him as much as it might others. Shandy\nHall, as he christened his pretty parsonage at Coxwold, and as the\nhouse, still standing, is called to this day, soon became irksome\nto him. The very reaction begotten of unwonted quietude acted on his\ntemperament with a dispiriting rather than a soothing effect. The\nchange from his full and stimulating life in London to the dull\nround of clerical duties in a Yorkshire village might well have been\ndepressing to a mind better balanced and ballasted than his. To him,\nwith his light, pleasure-loving nature, it was as the return of the\nschoolboy from pantomimes and pony-riding to the more sober delights\nof Dr. Swishtail’s; and, in a letter to Hall Stevenson, Sterne reveals\nhis feelings with all the juvenile frankness of one of the Doctor’s\npupils:",
        "  “I rejoice you are in London–rest you there in peace; here ’tis the\n  devil. You were a good prophet. I wish myself back again, as you\n  told me I should, but not because a thin, death-doing, pestiferous\n  north-east wind blows in a line directly from Crazy Castle turret\n  fresh upon me in this cuckoldly retreat (for I value the north-east\n  wind and all its powers not a straw), but the transition from rapid\n  motion to absolute rest was too violent. I should have walked about\n  the streets of York ten days, as a proper medium to have passed\n  through before I entered upon my rest; I stayed but a moment, and\n  I have been here but a few, to satisfy me. I have not managed my\n  miseries like a wise man, and if God for my consolation had not\n  poured forth the spirit of Shandyism unto me, which will not suffer\n  me to think two moments upon any grave subject, I would else just\n  now lay down and die.”",
        "It is true he adds, in the next sentence, that in half an hour’s time\n“I’ll lay a guinea I shall be as merry as a monkey, and forget it\nall,” but such sudden revulsions of high spirits can hardly be allowed\nto count for much against the prevailing tone of discontented ennuiwhich pervades this letter.",
        "Apart, moreover, from Sterne’s regrets of London, his country home\nwas becoming from other causes a less pleasant place of abode. His\nrelations with his wife were getting less and less cordial every year.\nWith a perversity sometimes noticeable in the wives of distinguished\nmen, Mrs. Sterne had failed to accept with enthusiasm the rôleof distant and humbly admiring spectator of her brilliant husband’s\ntriumphs. Accept it, of course, she did, being unable, indeed, to help\nherself; but it is clear that when Sterne returned home after one of\nhis six months’ revels in the gaieties of London, his wife, who had\nbeen vegetating the while in the retirement of Yorkshire, was not in\nthe habit of welcoming him with effusion. Perceiving so clearly that\nher husband preferred the world’s society to hers, she naturally,\nperhaps, refused to disguise her preference of her own society to his.\nTheir estrangement, in short, had grown apace, and had already\nbrought them to that stage of mutual indifference which is at once so\ncomfortable and so hopeless–secure alike against the risk of “scenes\"\nand the hope of reconciliation, shut fast in its exemption from\namantium irae against all possibility of redintegratio amoris.To such perfection, indeed, had the feeling been cultivated on both\nsides, that Sterne, in the letter above quoted, can write of his\nconjugal relations in this philosophic strain:",
        "  “As to matrimony I should be a beast to rail at it, for my wife is\n  easy, but the world is not, and had I stayed from her a second longer\n  it would have been a burning shame–else she declares herself\n  happier without me. But not in anger is this declaration made (the\n  most fatal point, of course, about it), but in pure, sober, good sense,\n  built on sound experience. She hopes you will be able to strike a\n  bargain for me before this twelvemonth to lead a bear round Europe,\n  and from this hope from you I verily believe it is that you are\n  so high in her favour at present. She swears you are a fellow of wit,\n  though humorous;[2] a funny, jolly soul, though somewhat splenetic,\n  and (hating the love of women) as honest as gold. How do you\n  like the simile?”",
        "There is, perhaps, a touch of affected cynicism in the suggestion that\nMrs. Sterne’s liking for one of her husband’s friends was wholly based\nupon the expectation that he would rid her of her husband; but mutual\nindifference must, it is clear, have reached a pretty advanced stage\nbefore such a remark could, even half in jest, be possible. And with\none more longing, lingering look at the scenes which he had quitted\nfor a lot like that of the Duke of Buckingham’s dog, upon whom his\nmaster pronounced the maledictory wish that “he were married and lived\nin the country,” this characteristic letter concludes:",
        "  “Oh, Lord! now are you going to Ranelagh to-night, and I am sitting\n  sorrowful as the prophet was when the voice cried out to him\n  and said, ’What do’st thou here, Elijah?’ ’Tis well that the spirit\n  does not make the same at Coxwold, for unless for the few sheep\n  left me to take care of in the wilderness, I might as well, nay, better,\n  be at Mecca. When we find we can, by a shifting of places, run\n  away from ourselves, what think you of a jaunt there before we\n  finally pay a visit to the Vale of Jehoshaphat? As ill a fame as we\n  have, I trust I shall one day or other see you face to face, so tell the\n  two colonels if they love good company to live righteously and soberly,\n  as you do, and then they will have no doubts or dangers within\n  or without them. Present my best and warmest wishes to them,\n  and advise the eldest to prop up his spirits, and get a rich dowager\n  before the conclusion of the peace. Why will not the advice suit\n  both, par nobile fratrum?_”",
        "[Footnote 1: It is curious to note, as a point in the chronology of\nlanguage, how exclusive is Sterne’s employment of the words “humour,\"\n“humourists,” in their older sense of “whimsicality,” “an eccentric.\"\nThe later change in its meaning gives to the word “though” in the\nabove passage an almost comic effect.]",
        "In conclusion, he tells his friend that the next morning, if Heaven\npermit, he begins the fifth volume of Shandy, and adds, defiantly,\nthat he “cares not a curse for the critics,” but “will load my vehicle\nwith what goods He sends me, and they may take ’em off my hands or let\n’em alone.”",
        "The allusions to foreign travel in this letter were made with,\nsomething more than a jesting intent. Sterne had already begun to be\nseriously alarmed, and not without reason, about the condition of his\nhealth. He shrank from facing another English winter, and meditated\na southward flight so soon as he should have finished his fifth\nand sixth volumes, and seen them safe in the printer’s hands. His\npublisher he had changed, for what reason is not known, and the firm\nof Becket & De Hondt had taken the place of Dodsley. Sterne hoped by\nthe end of the year to be free to depart from England, and already he\nhad made all arrangements with his ecclesiastical superiors for the\nnecessary leave of absence. He seems to have been treated with all\nconsideration in the matter. His Archbishop, on being applied to, at\nonce excused him from parochial work for a year, and promised, if\nit should be necessary, to double that term. Fortified with this\npermission, Sterne bade farewell to his wife and daughter, and betook\nhimself to London, with his now completed volumes, at the setting in\nof the winter. On the 21st of December they made their appearance, and\nin about three weeks from that date their author left England,\nwith the intention of wintering in the South of France. There were\ndifficulties, however, of more kinds than one which had first to be\nfaced–a pecuniary difficulty, which Garrick met by a loan of 20£.,\nand a political difficulty, for the removal of which Sterne had to\nemploy the good offices of new acquaintance later on. He reached Paris\nabout the 17th of January, 1762, and there met with a reception\nwhich interposed, as might have been expected, the most effectual of\nobstacles to his further progress southward. He was received in Paris\nwith open arms, and stepped at once within the charmed circle of the\nphilosophic salons. Again was the old intoxicating cup presented to\nhis lips–this time, too, with more dexterous than English hands–and\nagain did he drink deeply of it. “My head is turned,” he writes to\nGarrick, “with what I see, and the unexpected honour I have met with\nhere. Tristram was almost as much known here as in London, at least\namong your men of condition and learning, and has got me introduced\ninto so many circles (’tis comme à Londres_) I have just now a\nfortnight’s dinners and suppers on my hands.” We may venture to doubt\nwhether French politeness had not been in one respect taken somewhat\ntoo seriously by the flattered Englishman, and whether it was much\nmore than the name and general reputation of Tristram, which was\n“almost as much known” in Paris as in London. The dinners and suppers,\nhowever, were, at any rate, no figures of speech, but very liberal\nentertainments, at which Sterne appears to have disported himself with\nall his usual unclerical abandon. “I Shandy it away,” he writes in\nhis boyish fashion to Garrick, “fifty times more than I was ever wont,\ntalk more nonsense than ever you heard me talk in all your days,\nand to all sorts of people. ’Qui le diable est cet homme-là?’ said\nChoiseul, t’other day, ’ce Chevalier Shandy?’” [We might be listening\nto one of Thackeray’s Irish heroes.] “You’ll think me as vain as a\ndevil was I to tell you the rest of the dialogue.” But there were\ndistinguished Frenchmen who were ready to render to the English author\nmore important services than that of offering him hospitality and\nflattery. Peace had not been formally concluded between France and\nEngland, and the passport with which Sterne had been graciously\nfurnished by Pitt was not of force enough to dispense him from making\nspecial application to the French Government for permission to remain\nin the country. In this request he was influentially backed. “My\napplication,” he writes, “to the Count de Choiseul goes on swimmingly,\nfor not only M. Pelletière (who by-the-bye sends ten thousand\ncivilities to you and Mrs. G.) has undertaken my affair, but the Count\nde Limbourg. The Baron d’Holbach has offered any security for the\ninoffensiveness of my behaviour in France–’tis more, you rogue! than\nyou will do.” And then the orthodox, or professedly orthodox, English\ndivine, goes on to describe the character and habits of his strange\nnew friend: “This Baron is one of the most learned noblemen here, the\ngreat protector of wits and of the savans who are no wits; keeps\nopen house three days a week–his house is now, as yours was to me, my\nown–he lives at great expense.” Equally communicative is he as to his\nother great acquaintances. Among these were the Count de Bissie, whom\nby an “odd incident” (as it seemed to his unsuspecting vanity) “I\nfound reading Tristram when I was introduced to him, which I was,\"\nhe adds (without perceiving the connexion between this fact and the\n“incident”), “at his desire;” Mr. Fox and Mr. Macartney (afterwards\nthe Lord Macartney of Chinese celebrity), and the Duke of Orleans (not\nyet Égalité) himself, “who has suffered my portrait to be added to the\nnumber of some odd men in his collection, and has had it taken most\nexpressively at full length by a gentleman who lives with him.” Nor\nwas it only in the delights of society that Sterne was now revelling.\nHe was passionately fond of the theatre, and his letters to\nGarrick are full of eager criticism of the great French performers,\nintermingled with flatteries, sometimes rather full-bodied than\ndelicate, of their famous English rival. Of Clairon, in Iphigénie,\nhe says “she is extremely great. Would to God you had one or two\nlike her. What a luxury to see you with one of such power in the same\ninteresting scene! But ’tis too much.” Again he writes: “The French\ncomedy I seldom visit; they act scarce anything but tragedies; and the\nClairon is great, and Mdlle. Dumesmil in some parts still greater than\nher. Yet I cannot bear preaching–I fancy I got a surfeit of it in my\nyounger days.” And in a later letter:",
        "  “After a vile suspension of three weeks, we are beginning with\n  our comedies and operas. Yours I hear never flourished more; here\n  the comic actors were never so low; the tragedians hold up their\n  heads in all senses. I have known one little man support the theatrical\n  world like a David Atlas upon his shoulders, but Préville can’t\n  do half as much here, though Mad. Clairon stands by him and sets\n  her back to his. She is very great, however, and highly improved\n  since you saw her. She also supports her dignity at table, and has\n  her public day every Thursday, when she gives to eat (as they say\n  here) to all that are hungry and dry. You are much talked of here,\n  and much expected, as soon as the peace will let you. These two\n  last days you have happened to engross the whole conversation at\n  the great houses where I was at dinner. ’Tis the greatest problem\n  in nature in this meridian that one and the same man should possess\n  such tragic and comic powers, and in such an equilibrio as to divide\n  the world for which of the two Nature intended him.”",
        "And while on this subject of the stage let us pause for a moment\nto glance at an incident which connects Sterne with one of the most\nfamous of his French contemporaries. He has been asked “by a lady of\ntalent,” he tells Garrick, “to read a tragedy, and conjecture if it\nwould do for you. ’Tis from the plan of Diderot; and, possibly, half\na translation of it: The Natural Son, or the Triumph of Virtue,\nin five acts. It has too much sentiment in it (at least for me); the\nspeeches too long, and savour too much of preaching. This may be\na second reason it is not to my taste–’tis all love, love, love\nthroughout, without much separation in the characters. So I fear it\nwould not do for your stage, and perhaps for the very reason which\nrecommends it to a French one.” It is curious to see the “adaptator\ncerebrosuga” at work in those days as in these; though not, in this\ninstance, as it seems, with as successful results. The Natural Son,\nor the Triumph of Virtue, is not known to have reached either English\nreaders or English theatrical audiences. The French original, as we\nknow, fared scarcely better. “It was not until 1771,” says Diderot’s\nlatest English biographer, “that the directors of the French Comedy\ncould be induced to place Le Fils Naturel on the stage. The actors\ndetested their task, and, as we can well believe, went sulkily through\nparts which they had not taken the trouble to master. The public felt\nas little interest in the piece as the actors had done, and after one\nor two representations, it was put aside.[1]”",
        "[Footnote 1: Morley: Diderot and the Encyclopaedists, ii. 305.]",
        "Another, and it is to be guessed a too congenial, acquaintance formed\nby Sterne in Paris was that of Crébillon; and with him he concluded “a\nconvention,” unedifying enough, whether in jest or earnest: “As soon\nas I get to Toulouse he has agreed to write me an expostulatory\nletter upon the indecorums of T. Shandy, which is to be answered\nby recrimination upon the liberties in his own works. These are to\nbe printed together–Crébillon against Sterne, Sterne against\nCrébillon–the copy to be sold, and the money equally divided. This\nis good Swiss-policy,” he adds; and the idea (which was never carried\nout) had certainly the merit of ingenuity, if no other.",
        "The words “as soon as I get to Toulouse,” in a letter written from\nParis on the 10th of April, might well have reminded Sterne of the\nstrange way in which he had carried out his intention of “wintering\nin the South.” He insists, however, upon the curative effects of his\nwinter of gaiety in Paris. “I am recovered greatly,” he says; “and if\nI could spend one whole winter at Toulouse, I should be fortified in\nmy inner man beyond all danger of relapsing.” There was another, too,\nfor whom this change of climate had become imperatively necessary.\nFor three winters past his daughter Lydia, now fourteen years old,\nhad been suffering severely from asthma, and needed to try “the last\nremedy of a warmer and softer air.” Her father, therefore, was about\nto solicit passports for his wife and daughter, with a view to their\njoining him at once in Paris, whence, after a month’s stay, they were\nto depart together for the South. This application for passports he\nintended, he said, to make “this week:” and it would seem that the\nintention was carried out; but, for reasons explained in a letter\nwhich Mr. Fitzgerald was the first to publish, it was not till the\nmiddle of the next month that he was able to make preparation for\ntheir joining him. From this letter–written to his Archbishop, to\nrequest an extension of his leave–we learn that while applying for\nthe passports he was attacked with a fever, “which has ended the worst\nway it could for me, in a défluxion (de) poitrine, as the French\nphysicians call it. It is generally fatal to weak lungs, so that I\nhave lost in ten days all I have gained since I came here; and from\na relaxation of my lungs have lost my voice entirely, that ’twill\nbe much if I ever quite recover it. This evil sends me directly to\nToulouse, for which I set out from this place directly my family\narrives.” Evidently there was no time to be lost, and a week after the\ndate of this letter we find him in communication with Mrs. and\nMiss Sterne, and making arrangements for what was, in those days, a\nsomewhat formidable undertaking–the journey of two ladies from the\nNorth of England to the centre of France. The correspondence which\nensued may be said to give us the last pleasant glimpse of Sterne’s\nrelations with his wife. One can hardly help suspecting, of course,\nthat it was his solicitude for the safety and comfort of his\nmuch-loved daughter that mainly inspired the affectionate anxiety\nwhich pervades these letters to Mrs. Sterne; but their writer is, at\nthe very least, entitled to credit for allowing no difference of tone\nto reveal itself in the terms in which he speaks of wife and child.\nAnd, whichever of the two he was mainly thinking of, there is\nsomething very engaging in the thoughtful minuteness of his\ninstructions to the two women travellers, the earnestness of his\nattempts to inspire them with courage for their enterprise, and\nthe sincere fervour of his many commendations of them to the Divine\nkeeping. The mixture of “canny” counsel and pious invocation\nhas frequently a droll effect: as when the advice to “give the\ncustom-house officers what I told you, and at Calais more, if you have\nmuch Scotch snuff;” and “to drink small Rhenish to keep you cool, that\nis, if you like it,” is rounded off by the ejaculation, “So God in\nHeaven prosper and go along with you!” Letter after letter did he\nsend them, full of such reminders as that “they have bad pins and vile\nneedles here,” that it would be advisable to bring with them a strong\nbottle-screw, and a good stout copper tea-kettle; till at last, in\nthe final words of preparation, his language assumes something of the\nsolemnity of a general addressing his army on the eve of a well-nigh\ndesperate enterprise: “Pluck up your spirits–trust in God, in me,\nand yourselves; with this, was you put to it, you would encounter all\nthese difficulties ten times told. Write instantly, and tell me you\ntriumph over all fears–tell me Lydia is better, and a help-mate to\nyou. You say she grows like me: let her show me she does so in her\ncontempt of small dangers, and fighting against the apprehensions of\nthem, which is better still.”",
        "At last this anxiously awaited journey was taken; and, on Thursday,\nJuly 7, Mrs. Sterne and her daughter arrived in Paris. Their stay\nthere was not long–not much extended, probably, beyond the proposed\nweek. For Sterne’s health had, some ten days before the arrival of his\nfamily, again given him warning to depart quickly. He had but a few\nweeks recovered from the fever of which he spoke in his letter to\nthe Archbishop, when he again broke a blood-vessel in his lungs. It\nhappened in the night, and “finding in the morning that I was likely\nto bleed to death, I sent immediately,” he says, in a sentence which\nquaintly brings out the paradox of contemporary medical treatment,\n“for a surgeon to bleed me at both arms. This saved me\"–i.e. did\nnot kill me–\"and, with lying speechless three days, I recovered upon\nmy back in bed: the breach healed, and in a week after I got out.\"\nBut the weakness which ensued, and the subsequent “hurrying about,” no\ndoubt as cicerone of Parisian sights to his wife and daughter, “made\nme think it high time to haste to Toulouse.” Accordingly, about the\n20th of the month, and “in the midst of such heats that the oldest\nFrenchman never remembers the like,” the party set off by way of Lyons\nand Montpellier for their Pyrenean destination. Their journey seems to\nhave been a journey of many mischances, extraordinary discomfort, and\nincredible length; and it is not till the second week in August that\nwe again take up the broken thread of his correspondence. Writing to\nMr. Foley, his banker in Paris, on the 14th of that month, he speaks\nof its having taken him three weeks to reach Toulouse; and adds that\n“in our journey we suffered so much from the heats, it gives me pain\nto remember it. I never saw a cloud from Paris to Nismes half as\nbroad as a twenty-four sols piece. Good God! we were toasted, roasted,\ngrilled, stewed, carbonaded, on one side or other, all the way: and\nbeing all done through (_assez cuits_) in the day, we were eat up at\nnight by bugs and other unswept-out vermin, the legal inhabitants, if\nlength of possession give right, at every inn on the way.” A few miles\nfrom Beaucaire he broke a hind wheel of his carriage, and was obliged\nin consequence “to sit five hours on a gravelly road without one\ndrop of water, or possibility of getting any;” and here, to mend the\nmatter, he was cursed with “two dough-hearted fools” for postilions,\nwho “fell a-crying ’nothing was to be done!’” and could only be\nrecalled to a worthier and more helpful mood by Sterne’s “pulling off\nhis coat and waistcoat,” and “threatening to thrash them both within\nan inch of their lives.”",
        "The longest journey, however, must come to an end; and the party found\nmuch to console them at Toulouse for the miseries of travel. They were\nfortunate enough to secure one of those large, old comfortable houses\nwhich were and, here and there, perhaps, still are to be hired on the\noutskirts of provincial towns, at a rent which would now be thought\nabsurdly small; and Sterne writes in terms of high complacency of\nhis temporary abode. “Excellent,” “well furnished,” “elegant beyond\nanything I ever looked for,” are some of the expressions of praise\nwhich it draws from him. He observes with pride that the “very great\nsalle à compagnie is as large as Baron d’Holbach’s;” and he records\nwith great satisfaction–as well he might–that for the use of this\nand a country house two miles out of town, “besides the enjoyment of\ngardens, which the landlord engaged to keep in order,” he was to pay\nno more than thirty pounds a year. “All things,” he adds, “are cheap\nin proportion: so we shall live here for a very, very little.”",
        "And this, no doubt, was to Sterne a matter of some moment at this\ntime. The expenses of his long and tedious journey must have been\nheavy; and the gold-yielding vein of literary popularity, which he\nhad for three years been working, had already begun to show signs of\nexhaustion. Tristram Shandy had lost its first vogue; and the fifth\nand sixth volumes, the copyright of which he does not seem to have\ndisposed of, were “going off” but slowly.",
