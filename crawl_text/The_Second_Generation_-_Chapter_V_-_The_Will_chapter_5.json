        "When Hiram had so far improved that his period of isolation was obviously\nwithin a few days of its end, Adelaide suggested to Arthur, somewhat\ntimidly, “Don’t you think you ought to go to work at the mills?”",
        "He frowned. It was bad enough to have the inward instinct to this, and to\nfight it down anew each day as a temptation to weakness and cowardice.\nThat the traitor should get an ally in his sister–it was intolerable.\nThe frown deepened into a scowl.",
        "But Del had been doing real thinking since she saw her father stricken\ndown, and she was beginning clearly to see his point of view as to\nArthur. That angry frown was discouraging, but she felt too strongly to\nbe quite daunted. “It might help father toward getting well,” she urged,\n“and make such a difference–in every way.”",
        "“No more hypocrisy. I was right; he was wrong,” replied her brother. He\nhad questioned Dr. Schulze anxiously about his father’s seizure; and\nSchulze, who had taken a strong fancy to him and had wished to put him at\nease, declared that the attack must have begun at the mills, and would\nprobably have brought Hiram down before he could have reached home, had\nhe not been so powerful of body and of will. And Arthur, easily reassured\nwhere he must be assured if he was to have peace of mind, now believed\nthat his outburst had had no part whatever in causing his father’s\nstroke. So he was all for firm stand against slavery. “If I yield an inch\nnow,” he went on to Adelaide, “he’ll never stop until he has made me his\nslave. He has lorded it over those workingmen so long that the least\nopposition puts him in a frenzy.”",
        "Adelaide gave over, for the time, the combat against a stubbornness which\nwas an inheritance from his father. “I’ve only made him more set by what\nI’ve said,” thought she. “Now, he has committed himself. I ought not to\nhave been so tactless.”",
        "Long after Hiram got back in part the power of speech, he spoke only when\ndirectly addressed, and then after a wait in which he seemed to have cast\nabout for the fewest possible words. After a full week of this emphasized\nreticence, he said, “Where is Arthur?”",
        "Arthur had kept away because–so he told himself and believed–while he\nwas not in the least responsible for his father’s illness, still seeing\nhim and being thus reminded of their difference could not but have a bad\neffect. That particular day, as luck would have it, he for the first time\nsince his father was stricken had left the grounds. “He’s out driving,\"\nsaid his mother.",
        "“In the tandem?” asked Hiram.",
        "“Yes,” replied Ellen, knowing nothing of the last development of the\nstrained relations between her husband and her “boy.”",
        "“Then he hasn’t gone to work?”",
        "“He’s stayed close to the house ever since you were taken sick, Hiram,\"\nsaid she, with gentle reproach. “He’s been helping me nurse you.”",
        "Hiram did not need to inquire how little that meant. He knew that, when\nanyone Ellen Ranger loved was ill, she would permit no help in the\nnursing, neither by day nor by night. He relapsed into his brooding over\nthe problem which was his sad companion each conscious moment, now that\nthe warning “Put your house in order” had been so sternly emphasized.",
        "The day Dr. Schulze let them bring him down to the first floor, Mrs.\nHastings–\"Mrs. Fred,” to distinguish her from “Mrs. Val\"–happened to\ncall. Mrs. Ranger did not like her for two reasons–first, she had\nmarried her favorite cousin, Alfred Hastings, and had been the\n“ruination” of him; second, she had a way of running on and on to\neveryone and anyone about the most intimate family affairs, and\nclose-mouthed Ellen Ranger thought this the quintessence of indiscretion\nand vulgarity. But Hiram liked her, was amused by her always interesting\nand at times witty thrusts at the various members of her family,\nincluding herself. So, Mrs. Ranger, clutching at anything that might\nlighten the gloom thick and black upon him, let her in and left them\nalone together. With so much to do, she took advantage of every moment\nwhich she could conscientiously spend out of his presence.",
        "At sight of Henrietta, Hiram’s face brightened; and well it might. In\nold-fashioned Saint X it was the custom for a married woman to “settle\ndown” as soon as she returned from her honeymoon–to abandon all\nthoughts, pretensions, efforts toward an attractive exterior, and to\nbecome a “settled” woman, “settled” meaning purified of the last grain of\nthe vanity of trying to please the eye or ear of the male. And\nconversation with any man, other than her husband–and even with him, if\na woman were soundly virtuous, through and through–must be as clean\nshorn of allurement as a Quaker meetinghouse. Mrs. Fred had defied this\nancient and sacred tradition of the “settled” woman. She had kept her\nlooks; she frankly delighted in the admiration of men. And the fact that\nthe most captious old maid in Saint X could not find a flaw in her\ncharacter as a faithful wife, aggravated the offending. For, did not her\ndevotion to her husband make dangerous her example of frivolity retained\nand flaunted, as a pure private life in an infidel made his heresies\nplausible and insidious? At “almost” forty, Mrs. Hastings looked “about\"\nthirty and acted as if she were a girl or a widow. Each group of gods\nseems ridiculous to those who happen not to believe in it. Saint X’s set\nof gods of conventionality doubtless seems ridiculous to those who knock\nthe dust before some other set; but Saint X cannot be blamed for having a\nsober face before its own altars, and reserving its jeers and pitying\nsmiles for deities of conventionality in high dread and awe elsewhere.\nAnd if Mrs. Fred had not been “one of the Fuller heirs,” Saint X would\nhave made her feel its displeasure, instead of merely gossiping and\nthreatening.",
        "“I’m going the round of the invalids to-day,” began Henrietta, after she\nhad got through the formula of sick-room conversation. “I’ve just come\nfrom old John Skeffington. I found all the family in the depths. He\nfooled ’em again last night.”",
        "Hiram smiled. All Saint X knew what it meant for old Skeffington to “fool\n’em again.” He had been dying for three years. At the first news that he\nwas seized of a mortal illness his near relations, who had been driven\nfrom him by his temper and his parsimony, gathered under his roof from\nfar and near, each group hoping to induce him to make a will in its\nfavor. He lingered on, and so did they–watching each other, trying to\noutdo each other in complaisance to the humors of the old miser. And he\ngot a new grip on life through his pleasure in tyrannizing over them and\nin putting them to great expense in keeping up his house. He favored\nfirst one group, then another, taking fagots from fires of hope burning\ntoo high to rekindle fires about to expire.",
        "“How is he?” asked Hiram.",
        "“They say he can’t last till fall,” replied Henrietta; “but he’ll last\nanother winter, maybe ten. He’s having more and more fun all the time. He\nhas made them bring an anvil and hammer to his bedside, and whenever he\nhappens to be sleeping badly–and that’s pretty often–he bangs on the\nanvil until the last one of his relations has got up and come in; then,\nmaybe he’ll set ’em all to work mending his fishing tackle–right in the\ndead of night.”",
        "“Are they all there still?” asked Hiram. “The Thomases, the Wilsons, the\nFrisbies, and the two Cantwell old maids?”",
        "“Everyone–except Miss Frisbie. She’s gone back home to Rushville, but\nshe’s sending her sister on to take her place to-morrow. I saw Dory\nHargrave in the street a while ago. You know his mother was a first\ncousin of old John’s. I told him he ought not to let strangers get the\nold man’s money, that he ought to shy his castor into the ring.”",
        "“And what did Dory say?” asked Hiram.",
        "“He came back at me good and hard,” said Mrs. Fred, with a good-humored\nlaugh. “He said there’d been enough people in Saint X ruined by\ninheritances and by expecting inheritances. You know the creek that flows\nthrough the graveyard has just been stopped from seeping into the\nreservoir. Well, Dory spoke of that and said there was, and always had\nbeen, flowing from every graveyard a stream far more poisonous than any\ngraveyard creek, yet nobody talked of stopping it.”",
        "The big man, sitting with eyes downcast, began to rub his hands, one over\nthe other–a certain sign that he was thinking intently.",
        "“There’s a good deal of truth in what he said,” she went on. “Look at our\nfamily, for instance. We’ve been living on an allowance from Grandfather\nFuller in Chicago for forty years. None of us has ever done a stroke of\nwork; we’ve simply been waiting for him to die and divide up his\nmillions. Look at us! Bill and Tom drunkards, Dick a loafer without even\nthe energy to be a drunkard; Ed dead because he was too lazy to keep\nalive. Alice and I married nice fellows; but as soon as they got into our\nfamily they began to loaf and wait. We’ve been waiting in decent, or I\nshould say, indecent, poverty for forty years, and we’re still waiting.\nWe’re a lot of paupers. We’re on a level with the Wilmots.”",
        "“Yes–there are the Wilmots, too,” said Hiram absently.",
        "“That’s another form of the same disease,” Henrietta went on. “Did you\nknow General Wilmot?”",
        "“He was a fine man,” said Hiram, “one of the founders of this town, and\nhe made a fortune out of it. He got overbearing, and what he thought was\nproud, toward the end of his life. But he had a good heart and worked for\nall he had–honest work.”",
        "“And he brought his family up to be real down-East gentlemen and\nladies,” resumed Henrietta. “And look at ’em. They lost the money,\nbecause they were too gentlemanly and too ladylike to work to hold on to\nit. And there they live in the big house, half-starved. Why, really, Mr.\nRanger, they don’t have enough to eat. And they dress in clothes that\nhave been in the family for a generation. They make their underclothes\nout of old bed linen. And the grass on their front lawns is three feet\nhigh, and the moss and weeds cover and pry up the bricks of their walks.\nThey’re too ’proud’ to work and too poor to hire. How much have they\nborrowed from you?”",
        "“I don’t know,” said Hiram. “Not much.”",
        "“I know better–and you oughtn’t to have lent them a cent. Yesterday old\nWilmot was hawking two of his grandfather’s watches about. And all the\nWilmots have got brains, just as our family has. Nothing wrong with\neither of us, but that stream Dory Hargrave was talking about.”",
        "“There’s John Dumont,” mused Ranger.",
        "“Yes–he is an exception. But what’s he doing with what his father left\nhim? I don’t let them throw dust in my eyes with his philanthropy as they\ncall it. The plain truth is he’s a gambler and a thief, and he uses what\nhis father left him to be gambler and thief on the big scale, and so keep\nout of the penitentiary–’finance,’ they call it. If he’d been poor, he’d\nhave been in jail long ago–no, he wouldn’t–he’d have done differently.\nIt was the money that started him wrong.”",
        "“A great deal of good can be done with money,” said Hiram.",
        "“Can it?” demanded Mrs. Fred. “It don’t look that way to me. I’m full of\nthis, for I was hauling my Alfred over the coals this very morning\"–she\nlaughed–\"for being what I’ve made him, for doing what I’d do in his\nplace–for being like my father and my brothers. It seems to me, precious\nlittle of the alleged good that’s done with wealth is really good; and\nwhat little isn’t downright bad hides the truth from people. Talk about\nthe good money does! What does it amount to–the good that’s good, and\nthe good that’s rotten bad? What does it all amount to beside the good\nthat having to work does? People that have to work hard are usually\nhonest and have sympathy and affection and try to amount to something.\nAnd if they are bad, why at least they can’t hurt anybody but themselves\nvery much, where a John Dumont or a Skeffington can injure\nhundreds–thousands. Take your own case, Mr. Ranger. Your money has never\ndone you any good. It was your hard work. All your money has ever done\nhas been–Do you think your boy and girl will be as good a man and woman,\nas useful and creditable to the community, as you and Cousin Ellen?”",
        "Hiram said nothing; he continued to slide his great, strong,\nuseful-looking hands one over the other.",
        "“A fortune makes a man stumble along if he’s in the right road, makes him\nrace along if he’s in the wrong road,” concluded Henrietta.",
        "“You must have been talking a great deal to young Hargrave lately,” said\nHiram shrewdly.",
        "She blushed. “That’s true,” she admitted, with a laugh. “But I’m not\naltogether parroting what he said. I do my own thinking.” She rose. “I’m\nafraid I haven’t cheered you up much.”",
        "“I’m glad you came,” replied Hiram earnestly; then, with an\nadmiring look, “It’s a pity some of the men of your family haven’t\ngot your energy.”",
        "She laughed. “They have,” said she. “Every one of us is a first-rate\ntalker–and that’s all the energy I’ve got–energy to wag my tongue.\nStill–You didn’t know I’d gone into business?”",
        "“Business?”",
        "“That is, I’m backing Stella Wilmot in opening a little shop–to sell\nmillinery.”",
        "“A Wilmot at work!” exclaimed Hiram.",
        "“A Wilmot at work,” affirmed Henrietta. “She’s more like her great\ngrandfather; you know how a bad trait will skip several generations and\nthen show again. The Wilmots have been cultivating the commonness of work\nout of their blood for three generations, but it has burst in again. She\nmade a declaration of independence last week. She told the family she\nwas tired of being a pauper and beggar. And when I heard she wanted to do\nsomething I offered to go in with her in a business. She’s got a lot of\ntaste in trimming hats. She certainly has had experience enough.”",
        "“She always looks well,” said Hiram.",
        "“And you’d wonder at it, if you were a woman and knew what she’s had to\nwork on. So I took four hundred dollars grandfather sent me as a birthday\npresent, and we’re going to open up in a small way. She’s to put her name\nout–my family won’t let me put mine out, too. ’Wilmot & Hastings’ would\nsound well, don’t you think? But it’s got to be ’Wilmot & Co.’ We’ve\nhired a store–No. 263 Monroe Street. We have our opening in August.”",
        "“Do you need any–” began Hiram.",
        "“No, thank you,” she cut in, with a laugh. “This is a close corporation.\nNo stock for sale. We want to hold on to every cent of the profits.”",
        "“Well,” said Hiram, “if you ever do need to borrow, you know where to\ncome.”",
        "“Where the whole town comes when it’s hard up,” said Henrietta; and she\nastonished the old man by giving him a shy, darting kiss on the brow.\n“Now, don’t you tell your wife!” she exclaimed, laughing and blushing\nfuriously and making for the door.",
        "When Adelaide, sent by her mother, came to sit with him, he said: “Draw\nthe blinds, child, and leave me alone. I want to rest.” She obeyed him.\nAt intervals of half an hour she opened the door softly, looked in at\nhim, thought he was asleep, and went softly away. But he had never been\nfurther from sleep in his life. Henrietta Hastings’s harum-scarum\ngossiping and philosophizing happened to be just what his troubled mind\nneeded to precipitate its clouds into a solid mass that could be clearly\nseen and carefully examined. Heretofore he had accepted the conventional\nexplanations of all the ultimate problems, had regarded philosophers as\ntime wasters, own brothers to the debaters who whittled on dry-goods\nboxes at the sidewalk’s edge in summer and about the stoves in the rear\nof stores in winter, settling all affairs save their own. But now,\nsitting in enforced inaction and in the chill and calm which diffuses\nfrom the tomb, he was using the unused, the reflective, half of his mind.",
        "Even as Henrietta was talking, he began to see what seemed to him the\nhidden meaning in the mysterious “Put your house in order” that would\ngive him no rest. But he was not the man to make an important decision in\nhaste, was the last man in the world to inflict discomfort, much less\npain, upon anyone, unless the command to do it came unmistakably in the\none voice he dared not disobey. Day after day he brooded; night after\nnight he fought to escape. But, slowly, inexorably, his iron inheritance\nfrom Covenanter on one side and Puritan on the other asserted itself.\nHeartsick, and all but crying out in anguish, he advanced toward the\nstern task which he could no longer deny or doubt that the Most High God\nhad set for him.",
        "He sent for Dory Hargrave’s father.",
        "Mark Hargrave was president of the Tecumseh Agricultural and Classical\nUniversity, to give it its full legal entitlements. It consisted in a\nfaculty of six, including Dr. Hargrave, and in two meager and modest,\nalmost mean “halls,” and two hundred acres of land. There were at that\ntime just under four hundred students, all but about fifty working their\nway through. So poor was the college that it was kept going only by\nefforts, the success of which seemed miraculous interventions of\nProvidence. They were so regarded by Dr. Hargrave, and the stubbornest\ninfidel must have conceded that he was not unjustified.",
        "As Hargrave, tall and spare, his strong features illumined by life-long\nunselfish service to his fellow-men, came into Hiram Ranger’s presence,\nHiram shrank and grew gray as his hair. Hargrave might have been the\nofficer come to lead him forth to execution.",
        "“If you had not sent for me, Mr. Ranger,” he began, after the greetings,\n“I should have come of my own accord within a day or two. Latterly God\nhas been strongly moving me to lay before you the claims of my boys–of\nthe college.”",
        "This was to Hiram direct confirmation of his own convictions. He tried to\nforce his lips to say so, but they would not move.",
        "“You and Mrs. Ranger,” Hargrave went on, “have had a long life, full of\nthe consciousness of useful work well done. Your industry, your fitness\nfor the just use of God’s treasure, has been demonstrated, and He has\nmade you stewards of much of it. And now approaches the final test, the\ngreatest test, of your fitness to do His work. In His name, my old\nfriend, what are you going to do with His treasure?”",
        "Hiram Ranger’s face lighted up. The peace that was entering his soul lay\nupon the tragedy of his mental and physical suffering soft and serene\nand sweet as moonlight beautifying a ruin. “That’s why I sent for you,\nMark,” he said.",
        "“Hiram, are you going to leave your wealth so that it may continue to do\ngood in the world? Or, are you going to leave it so that it may tempt\nyour children to vanity and selfishness, to lives of idleness and folly,\nto bring up their children to be even less useful to mankind than they,\neven more out of sympathy with the ideals which God has implanted? All of\nthose ideals are attainable only through shoulder-to-shoulder work such\nas you have done all your life.”",
        "“God help me!” muttered Hiram. The sweat was beading his forehead and his\nhands were clasped and wrenching each at the other, typical of the two\nforces contending in final battle within him. “God help me!”",
        "“Have you ever looked about you in this town and thought of the meaning\nof its steady decay, moral and physical? God prospered the hard-working\nmen who founded it; but, instead of appreciating His blessings, they\nregarded the wealth He gave them as their own; and they left it to their\nchildren. And see how their sin is being visited upon the third and\nfourth generations! Industry has been slowly paralyzing. The young\npeople, whose wealth gave them the best opportunities, are leading idle\nlives, are full of vanity of class and caste, are steeped in the sins\nthat ever follow in the wake of idleness–the sins of selfishness and\nindulgence. Instead of being workers, leading in the march upward,\ninstead of taking the position for which their superior opportunities\nshould have fitted them, they set an example of idleness and indolence.\nThey despise their ancestry of toil which should be their pride. They\npride themselves upon the parasitism which is their shame. And they set\nbefore the young an example of contempt for work, of looking on it as a\ncurse and a disgrace.”",
        "“I have been thinking of these things lately,” said Hiram.",
        "“It is the curse of the world, this inherited wealth,” cried Hargrave.\n“Because of it humanity moves in circles instead of forward. The ground\ngained by the toiling generations, is lost by the inheriting generations.\nAnd this accursed inheritance tempts men ever to long for and hope for\nthat which they have not earned. God gave man a trial of the plan of\nliving in idleness upon that which he had not earned, and man fell. Then\nGod established the other plan, and through it man has been rising–but\nrising slowly and with many a backward slip, because he has tried to\nthwart the Divine plan with the system of inheritance. Fortunately, the\ngreat mass of mankind has had nothing to leave to heirs, has had no hope\nof inheritances. Thus, new leaders have ever been developed in place of\nthose destroyed by inherited prosperity. But, unfortunately, the law of\ninheritance has been able to do its devil’s work upon the best element in\nevery human society, upon those who had the most efficient and exemplary\nparents, and so had the best opportunity to develop into men and women of\nthe highest efficiency. No wonder progress is slow, when the leaders of\neach generation have to be developed from the bottom all over again, and\nwhen the ideal of useful work is obscured by the false ideal of living\nwithout work. Waiting for dead men’s shoes! Dead men’s shoes instead of\nshoes of one’s own.”",
        "“Dead men’s shoes,” muttered Hiram.",
        "“The curse of unearned wealth,” went on his friend. “Your life, Hiram,\nleaves to your children the injunction to work, to labor cheerfully and\nequally, honestly and helpfully, with their brothers and sisters; but\nyour wealth–If you leave it to them, will it not give that injunction\nthe lie, will it not invite them to violate that injunction?”",
        "“I have been watching my children, my boy, especially,” said Hiram. “I\ndon’t know about all this that you’ve been saying. It’s a big subject;\nbut I do know about this boy of mine. I wish I’d ’a’ taken your advice,\nMark, and put him in your school. But his mother was set on the East–on\nHarvard.” Tears were in his eyes at this. He remembered how she, knowing\nnothing of college, but feeling it was her duty to have her children\neducated properly, a duty she must not put upon others, had sent for the\ncatalogues of all the famous colleges in the country. He could see her\nporing over the catalogues, balancing one offering of educational\nadvantage against another, finally deciding for Harvard, the greatest of\nthem all. He could hear her saying: “It’ll cost a great deal, Hiram. As\nnear as I can reckon it out it’ll cost about a thousand dollars a\nyear–twelve hundred if we want to be v-e-r-y liberal, so the catalogue\nsays. But Harvard’s the biggest, and has the most teachers and scholars,\nand takes in all the branches. And we ought to give our Arthur the best.\"\nAnd now–By what bitter experience had he learned that the college is not\nin the catalogue, is a thing apart, unrelated and immeasurably different!\nHis eyes were hot with anger as he thought how the boy’s mother, honest,\nconscientious Ellen, had been betrayed.",
        "“Look here, Mark,” he blazed out, “if I leave money to your college I\nwant to see that it can’t ever be like them eastern institutions of\nlearning.” He made a gesture of disgust. “Learning!”",
        "“If you leave us anything, Hiram, leave it so that any young man who gets\nits advantages must work for them.”",
        "“That’s it!” exclaimed Hiram. “That’s what I want. Can you draw me up\nthat kind of plan? No boy, no matter what he has at home, can come to\nthat there college without working his way through, without learning to\nwork, me to provide the chance to earn the living.”",
        "“I have just such a plan,” said Hargrave, drawing a paper from his\npocket. “I’ve had it ready for years waiting for just such an\nopportunity.”",
        "“Read it,” said Hiram, sinking deep in his big chair and closing his eyes\nand beginning to rub his forehead with his great hand.",
        "And Hargrave read, forgetting his surroundings, forgetting everything in\nhis enthusiasm for this dream of his life–a university, in fact as well\nas in name, which would attract the ambitious children of rich and\nwell-to-do and poor, would teach them how to live honestly and nobly,\nwould give them not only useful knowledge to work with but also the light\nto work by. “You see, Hiram, I think a child ought to begin to be a man\nas soon as he begins to live–a man, standing on his own feet, in his own\nshoes, with the courage that comes from knowing how to do well something\nwhich the world needs.”",
        "He looked at Hiram for the first time in nearly half an hour. He was\nalarmed by the haggard, ghastly gray of that majestic face; and his\nthought was not for his plan probably about to be thwarted by the man’s\npremature death, but of his own selfishness in wearying and imperiling\nhim by importunity at such a time. “But we’ll talk of this again,” he\nsaid sadly, putting the paper in his pocket and rising for instant\ndeparture.",
        "“Give me the paper,” said Hiram, putting out his trembling hand, but not\nlifting his heavy, blue-black lids.",
        "Mark gave it to him hesitatingly. “You’d better put it off till you’re\nstronger, Hiram.”",
        "“I’ll see,” said Hiram. “Good morning, Mark.”",
        "Judge Torrey was the next to get Ranger’s summons; it came toward\nmid-afternoon of that same day. Like Hargrave, Torrey had been his\nlife-long friend.",
        "“Torrey,” he said, “I want you to examine this plan\"–and he held up the\npaper Hargrave had left–\"and, if it is not legal, put it into legal\nshape, and incorporate it into my will. I feel I ain’t got much time.\"\nWith a far-away, listening look–\"I must put my house in order–in order.\nDraw up a will and bring it to me before five o’clock. I want you to\nwrite it yourself–trust no one–no one!” His eyes were bright, his\ncheeks bluish, and he spoke in a thick, excited voice that broke and\nshrilled toward the end of each sentence.",
        "“I can’t do it to-day. Too much haste–”",
        "“To-day!” commanded Hiram. “I won’t rest till it’s done!”",
        "“Of course, I can–”",
        "“Read the paper now, and give me your opinion.”",
        "Torrey put on his glasses, opened the paper. “Oh!” he exclaimed. “I\nremember this. It’s in my partner’s handwriting. Hargrave had Watson\ndraw it up about five years ago. We were very careful in preparing it.\nIt is legal.”",
        "“Very well,” continued Hiram. “Now I’ll give you the points of my will.”",
        "Torrey took notebook and pencil from his pocket.",
        "“First,” began Hiram, as if he were reciting something he had learned by\nheart, “to my wife, Ellen, this house and everything in it, and the\ngrounds and all the horses and carriages and that kind of thing.”",
        "“Yes,” said Torrey, looking up from his note making.",
        "“Second, to my wife an income of seven thousand a year for life–that is\nwhat it cost her and me to live last year, and the children–except the\nextras. Seven thousand for life–but only for life.”",
        "“Yes,” said Torrey, his glance at Hiram now uneasy and expectant.",
        "“Third, to my daughter, Adelaide, two thousand a year for her life–to be\ndivided among her daughters equally, if she have any; if not, to revert\nto my estate at her death.”",
        "“Yes,” said Torrey.",
        "“Fourth, to my son, five thousand dollars in cash.”",
        "A long pause, Torrey looking at his old friend and client as if he\nthought one or the other of them bereft of his senses. At last, he said,\n“Yes, Hiram.”",
        "“Fifth, to my brothers, Jacob and Ezra, four hundred dollars each,\"\ncontinued Hiram, in his same voice of repeating by rote, “and to my\nsister Prudence, five thousand dollars–so fixed that her husband can’t\ntouch it.”",
        "“Yes,” said Torrey.",
        "“Sixth, the rest of my estate to be made into a trust, with Charles\nWhitney and Mark Hargrave and Hampden Scarborough trustees, with power to\nselect their successors. The trust to be administered for the benefit of\nTecumseh University under the plan you have there.”",
        "Torrey half-rose from his chair, his usually calm features reflecting his\ninner contention of grief, alarm, and protest. But there was in Hiram’s\nface that which made him sink back without having spoken.",
        "“Seventh,” continued Hiram, “the mills and the cooperage to be continued\nas now, and not to be sold for at least fifteen years. If my son Arthur\nwishes to have employment in them, he is to have it at the proper wages\nfor the work he does. If at the end of fifteen years he wishes to buy\nthem, he to have the right to buy, that is, my controlling interest in\nthem, provided he can make a cash payment of ten per cent of the then\nvalue; and, if he can do that, he is to have ten years in which to\ncomplete the payment–or longer, if the trustees think it wise.”",
        "A long pause; Hiram seemed slowly to relax and collapse like a man\nstretched on the rack, who ceases to suffer either because the torture is\nended or because his nerves mercifully refuse to register any more pain.\n“That is all,” he said wearily.",
        "Torrey wiped his glasses, put them on, wiped them again, hung them on the\nhook attached to the lapel of his waistcoat, put them on, studied the\npaper, then said hesitatingly: “As one of your oldest friends, Hiram, and\nin view of the surprising nature of the–the–”",
        "“I do not wish to discuss it,” interrupted Hiram, with that gruff\nfinality of manner which he always used to hide his softness, and which\ndeceived everyone, often even his wife. “Come back at five o’clock with\ntwo witnesses.”",
        "Torrey rose, his body shifting with his shifting mind as he cast about\nfor an excuse for lingering. “Very well, Hiram,” he finally said. As he\nshook hands, he blurted out huskily, “The boy’s a fine young fellow, Hi.\nIt don’t seem right to disgrace him by cutting him off this way.”",
        "Hiram winced. “Wait a minute,” he said. He had been overlooking the\npublic–how the town would gossip and insinuate. “Put in this, Torrey,\"\nhe resumed after reflecting. And deliberately, with long pauses to\nconstruct the phrases, he dictated: “I make this disposal of my estate\nthrough my love for my children, and because I have firm belief in the\nsoundness of their character and in their capacity to do and to be. I\nfeel they will be better off without the wealth which would tempt my son\nto relax his efforts to make a useful man of himself and would cause my\ndaughter to be sought for her fortune instead of for herself.”",
        "“That may quiet gossip against your children,” said Torrey, when he had\ntaken down Hiram’s slowly enunciated words, “but it does not change the\nextraordinary character of the will.”",
        "“John,” said Hiram, “can you think of a single instance in which\ninherited wealth has been a benefit, a single case where a man has become\nmore of a man than he would if he hadn’t had it?”",
        "Hiram waited long. Torrey finally said: “That may be, but–” But what?\nTorrey did not know, and so came to a full stop.",
        "“I’ve been trying for weeks to think of one,” continued Hiram, “and\nwhenever I thought I’d found one, I’d see, on looking at all the facts,\nthat it only seemed to be so. And I recalled nearly a hundred instances\nright here in Saint X where big inheritances or little had been ruinous.”",
        "“I have never thought on this aspect of the matter before,” said Torrey.\n“But to bring children up in the expectation of wealth, and then to leave\nthem practically nothing, looks to me like–like cheating them.”",
        "“It does, John,” Hiram answered. “I’ve pushed my boy and my girl far\nalong the broad way that leads to destruction. I must take the\nconsequences. But God won’t let me divide the punishment for my sins with\nthem. I see my duty clear. I must do it. Bring the will at five o’clock.”",
        "Hiram’s eyes were closed; his voice sounded to Torrey as if it were the\nutterance of a mind far, far away–as far away as that other world which\nhad seemed vividly real to Hiram all his life; it seemed real and near to\nTorrey, looking into his old friend’s face. “The power that’s guiding\nhim,” Torrey said to himself, “is one I daren’t dispute with.” And he\nwent away with noiseless step and with head reverently bent.",
