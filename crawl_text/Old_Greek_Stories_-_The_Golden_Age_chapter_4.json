        "Jupiter and his Mighty Folk had not always dwelt amid the clouds on the\nmountain top. In times long past, a wonderful family called Titans had\nlived there and had ruled over all the world. There were twelve of\nthem–six brothers and six sisters–and they said that their father was\nthe Sky and their mother the Earth. They had the form and looks of men\nand women, but they were much larger and far more beautiful.",
        "The name of the youngest of these Titans was Saturn; and yet he was so\nvery old that men often called him Father Time. He was the king of the\nTitans, and so, of course, was the king of all the earth besides.",
        "Men were never so happy as they were during Saturn’s reign. It was the\ntrue Golden Age then. The springtime lasted all the year. The woods and\nmeadows were always full of blossoms, and the music of singing birds was\nheard every day and every hour. It was summer and autumn, too, at the\nsame time. Apples and figs and oranges always hung ripe from the trees;\nand there were purple grapes on the vines, and melons and berries of\nevery kind, which the people had but to pick and eat.",
        "Of course nobody had to do any kind of work in that happy time. There\nwas no such thing as sickness or sorrow or old age. Men and women lived\nfor hundreds and hundreds of years and never became gray or wrinkled or\nlame, but were always handsome and young. They had no need of houses,\nfor there were no cold days nor storms nor anything to make them afraid.",
        "Nobody was poor, for everybody had the same precious things–the\nsunlight, the pure air, the wholesome water of the springs, the grass\nfor a carpet, the blue sky for a roof, the fruits and flowers of the\nwoods and meadows. So, of course, no one was richer than another, and\nthere was no money, nor any locks or bolts; for everybody was\neverybody’s friend, and no man wanted to get more of anything than his\nneighbors had.",
        "When these happy people had lived long enough they fell asleep, and\ntheir bodies were seen no more. They flitted away through the air, and\nover the mountains, and across the sea, to a flowery land in the distant\nwest. And some men say that, even to this day, they are wandering\nhappily hither and thither about the earth, causing babies to smile in\ntheir cradles, easing the burdens of the toilworn and sick, and blessing\nmankind everywhere.",
        "What a pity it is that this Golden Age should have come to an end! But\nit was Jupiter and his brothers who brought about the sad change.",
        "It is hard to believe it, but men say that Jupiter was the son of the\nold Titan king, Saturn, and that he was hardly a year old when he began\nto plot how he might wage war against his father. As soon as he was\ngrown up, he persuaded his brothers, Neptune and Pluto, and his sisters,\nJuno, Ceres, and Vesta, to join him; and they vowed that they would\ndrive the Titans from the earth.",
        "Then followed a long and terrible war. But Jupiter had many mighty\nhelpers. A company of one-eyed monsters called Cyclopes were kept busy\nall the time, forging thunderbolts in the fire of burning mountains.\nThree other monsters, each with a hundred hands, were called in to throw\nrocks and trees against the stronghold of the Titans; and Jupiter\nhimself hurled his sharp lightning darts so thick and fast that the\nwoods were set on fire and the water in the rivers boiled with the heat.",
        "Of course, good, quiet old Saturn and his brothers and sisters could\nnot hold out always against such foes as these. At the end of ten years\nthey had to give up and beg for peace. They were bound in chains of the\nhardest rock and thrown into a prison in the Lower Worlds; and the\nCyclopes and the hundred-handed monsters were sent there to be their\njailers and to keep guard over them forever.",
        "Then men began to grow dissatisfied with their lot. Some wanted to be\nrich and own all the good things in the world. Some wanted to be kings\nand rule over the others. Some who were strong wanted to make slaves of\nthose who were weak. Some broke down the fruit trees in the woods, lest\nothers should eat of the fruit. Some, for mere sport, hunted the timid\nanimals which had always been their friends. Some even killed these poor\ncreatures and ate their flesh for food.",
        "At last, instead of everybody being everybody’s friend, everybody was\neverybody’s foe.",
        "So, in all the world, instead of peace, there was war; instead of\nplenty, there was starvation; instead of innocence, there was crime; and\ninstead of happiness, there was misery.",
        "And that was the way in which Jupiter made himself so mighty; and that\nwas the way in which the Golden Age came to an end.",
