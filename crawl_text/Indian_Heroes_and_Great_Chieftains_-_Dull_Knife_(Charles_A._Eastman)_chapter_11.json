        "The life of Dull Knife, the Cheyenne, is a true hero tale.  Simple,\nchild-like yet manful, and devoid of selfish aims, or love of gain,\nhe is a pattern for heroes of any race.",
        "Dull Knife was a chief of the old school.  Among all the\nIndians of the plains, nothing counts save proven worth.  A man’s\ncaliber is measured by his courage, unselfishness and intelligence. \nMany writers confuse history with fiction, but in Indian history\ntheir women and old men and even children witness the main events,\nand not being absorbed in daily papers and magazines, these events\nare rehearsed over and over with few variations.  Though orally\npreserved, their accounts are therefore accurate.  But they have\nseldom been willing to give reliable information to strangers,\nespecially when asked and paid for.",
        "Racial prejudice naturally enters into the account of a man’s\nlife by enemy writers, while one is likely to favor his own race. \nI am conscious that many readers may think that I have idealized\nthe Indian.  Therefore I will confess now that we have too many\nweak and unprincipled men among us.  When I speak of the Indian\nhero, I do not forget the mongrel in spirit, false to the ideals of\nhis people.  Our trustfulness has been our weakness, and when the\nvices of civilization were added to our own, we fell heavily.",
        "It is said that Dull Knife as a boy was resourceful and\nself-reliant.  He was only nine years old when his family was\nseparated from the rest of the tribe while on a buffalo hunt.  His\nfather was away and his mother busy, and he was playing with his\nlittle sister on the banks of a stream, when a large herd of\nbuffalo swept down upon them on a stampede for water.  His mother\nclimbed a tree, but the little boy led his sister into an old\nbeaver house whose entrance was above water, and here they remained\nin shelter until the buffalo passed and they were found by their\ndistracted parents.",
        "Dull Knife was quite a youth when his tribe was caught one\nwinter in a region devoid of game, and threatened with starvation. \nThe situation was made worse by heavy storms, but he secured help\nand led a relief party a hundred and fifty miles, carrying bales of\ndried buffalo meat on pack horses.",
        "Another exploit that made him dear to his people occurred in\nbattle, when his brother-in-law was severely wounded and left lying\nwhere no one on either side dared to approach him.  As soon as Dull\nKnife heard of it he got on a fresh horse, and made so daring a\ncharge that others joined him; thus under cover of their fire he\nrescued his brother-in-law, and in so doing was wounded twice.",
        "The Sioux knew him as a man of high type, perhaps not so\nbrilliant as Roman Nose and Two Moon, but surpassing both in\nhonesty and simplicity, as well as in his war record.  (Two Moon,\nin fact, was never a leader of his people, and became distinguished\nonly in wars with the whites during the period of revolt.)  A story\nis told of an ancestor of the same name that illustrates well the\nspirit of the age.",
        "It was the custom in those days for the older men to walk\nahead of the moving caravan and decide upon all halts and camping \nplaces.  One day the councilors came to a grove of wild cherries\ncovered with ripe fruit, and they stopped at once.  Suddenly a\ngrizzly charged from the thicket.  The men yelped and hooted, but\nthe bear was not to be bluffed.  He knocked down the first warrior\nwho dared to face him and dragged his victim into the bushes.",
        "The whole caravan was in the wildest excitement.  Several of\nthe swiftest-footed warriors charged the bear, to bring him out\ninto the open, while the women and dogs made all the noise they\ncould.  The bear accepted the challenge, and as he did so, the man\nwhom they had supposed dead came running from the opposite end of\nthe thicket.  The Indians were delighted, and especially so when in\nthe midst of their cheers, the man stopped running for his life and\nbegan to sing a Brave Heart song as he approached the grove with\nhis butcher knife in his hand.  He would dare his enemy again!",
        "The grizzly met him with a tremendous rush, and they went down\ntogether.  Instantly the bear began to utter cries of distress, and\nat the same time the knife flashed, and he rolled over dead.  The\nwarrior was too quick for the animal; he first bit his sensitive\nnose to distract his attention, and then used the knife to stab him\nto the heart.  He fought many battles with knives thereafter and\nclaimed that the spirit of the bear gave him success.  On one\noccasion, however, the enemy had a strong buffalo-hide shield which\nthe Cheyenne bear fighter could not pierce through, and he was\nwounded; nevertheless he managed to dispatch his foe.  It was from\nthis incident that he received the name of Dull Knife, which was\nhanded down to his descendant.",
        "As is well known, the Northern Cheyennes uncompromisingly\nsupported the Sioux in their desperate defense of the Black Hills\nand Big Horn country.  Why not?  It was their last buffalo region\n– their subsistence.  It was what our wheat fields are to a\ncivilized nation.",
        "About the year 1875, a propaganda was started for confining\nall the Indians upon reservations, where they would be practically\ninterned or imprisoned, regardless of their possessions and rights. \nThe men who were the strongest advocates of the scheme generally\nwanted the Indians’ property – the one main cause back of all\nIndian wars.  From the warlike Apaches to the peaceful Nez Perces,\nall the tribes of the plains were hunted from place to place; then\nthe government resorted to peace negotiations, but always with an\narmy at hand to coerce.  Once disarmed and helpless, they were to\nbe taken under military guard to the Indian Territory.",
        "A few resisted, and declared they would fight to the death\nrather than go.  Among these were the Sioux, but nearly all the\nsmaller tribes were deported against their wishes.  Of course those\nIndians who came from a mountainous and cold country suffered\nseverely.  The moist heat and malaria decimated the exiles.  Chief\nJoseph of the Nez Perces and Chief Standing Bear of the Poncas\nappealed to the people of the United States, and finally succeeded\nin having their bands or the remnant of them returned to their own\npart of the country.  Dull Knife was not successful in his plea,\nand the story of his flight is one of poignant interest.",
        "He was regarded by the authorities as a dangerous man, and\nwith his depleted band was taken to the Indian Territory without\nhis consent in 1876.  When he realized that his people were dying\nlike sheep, he was deeply moved.  He called them together.  Every\nman and woman declared that they would rather die in their own\ncountry than stay there longer, and they resolved to flee to their\nnorthern homes.",
        "Here again was displayed the genius of these people.  From the\nIndian Territory to Dakota is no short dash for freedom.  They knew\nwhat they were facing.  Their line of flight lay through a settled\ncountry and they would be closely pursued by the army.  No sooner\nhad they started than the telegraph wires sang one song: “The\npanther of the Cheyennes is at large.  Not a child or a woman in\nKansas or Nebraska is safe.”  Yet they evaded all the pursuing and\nintercepting troops and reached their native soil.  The strain was\nterrible, the hardship great, and Dull Knife, like Joseph, was\nremarkable for his self-restraint in sparing those who came within\nhis power on the way.",
        "But fate was against him, for there were those looking for\nblood money who betrayed him when he thought he was among friends. \nHis people were tired out and famished when they were surrounded\nand taken to Fort Robinson.  There the men were put in prison, and\ntheir wives guarded in camp.  They were allowed to visit their men\non certain days.  Many of them had lost everything; there were but\na few who had even one child left.  They were heartbroken.",
        "These despairing women appealed to their husbands to die\nfighting: their liberty was gone, their homes broken up, and only\nslavery and gradual extinction in sight.  At last Dull Knife\nlistened.  He said: “I have lived my life.  I am ready.”  The\nothers agreed.  “If our women are willing to die with us, who is\nthere to say no?  If we are to do the deeds of men, it rests with\nyou women to bring us our weapons.",
        "As they had been allowed to carry moccasins and other things\nto the men, so they contrived to take in some guns and knives under\nthis disguise.  The plan was to kill the sentinels and run to the\nnearest natural trench, there to make their last stand.  The women\nand children were to join them.  This arrangement was carried out. \nNot every brave had a gun, but all had agreed to die together. \nThey fought till their small store of ammunition was exhausted,\nthen exposed their broad chests for a target, and the mothers even\nheld up their little ones to be shot.  Thus died the fighting\nCheyennes and their dauntless leader.",
