        "IT is not easy to characterize Sitting Bull, of all Sioux chiefs\nmost generally known to the American people.  There are few to whom\nhis name is not familiar, and still fewer who have learned to\nconnect it with anything more than the conventional notion of a\nbloodthirsty savage.  The man was an enigma at best.  He was not\nimpulsive, nor was he phlegmatic.  He was most serious when he\nseemed to be jocose.  He was gifted with the power of sarcasm, and\nfew have used it more artfully than he.",
        "His father was one of the best-known members of the Unkpapa\nband of Sioux.  The manner of this man’s death was characteristic. \nOne day, when the Unkpapas were attacked by a large war party of\nCrows, he fell upon the enemy’s war leader with his knife.  In a\nhand-to-hand combat of this sort, we count the victor as entitled\nto a war bonnet of trailing plumes.  It means certain death to one\nor both.  In this case, both men dealt a mortal stroke, and Jumping\nBuffalo, the father of Sitting Bull, fell from his saddle and died\nin a few minutes.  The other died later from the effects of the\nwound.",
        "Sitting Bull’s boyhood must have been a happy one.  It was\nlong after the day of the dog-travaux, and his father owned many\nponies of variegated colors.  It was said of him in a joking way\nthat his legs were bowed like the ribs of the ponies that he rode\nconstantly from childhood.  He had also a common nickname that was\nmuch to the point.  It was “Hunkeshnee”, which means “Slow”,\nreferring to his inability to run fast, or more probably to the\nfact that he seldom appeared on foot.  In their boyish games he was\nwont to take the part of the “old man”, but this does not mean that\nhe was not active and brave.  It is told that after a buffalo hunt\nthe boys were enjoying a mimic hunt with the calves that had been\nleft behind.  A large calf turned viciously on Sitting Bull, whose\npony had thrown him, but the alert youth got hold of both ears and\nstruggled until the calf was pushed back into a buffalo wallow in\na sitting posture.  The boys shouted: “He has subdued the buffalo\ncalf!  He made it sit down!”  And from this incident was derived\nhis familiar name of Sitting Bull.",
        "It is a mistake to suppose that Sitting Bull, or any other\nIndian warrior, was of a murderous disposition.  It is true that\nsavage warfare had grown more and more harsh and cruel since the\ncoming of white traders among them, bringing guns, knives, and\nwhisky.  Yet it was still regarded largely as a  sort of game,\nundertaken in order to develop the manly qualities of their youth. \nIt was the degree of risk which brought honor, rather than the\nnumber slain, and a brave must mourn thirty days, with blackened\nface and loosened hair, for the enemy whose life he had taken. \nWhile the spoils of war were allowed, this did not extend to\nterritorial aggrandizement, nor was there any wish to overthrow\nanother nation and enslave its people.  It was a point of honor\nin the old days to treat a captive with kindness.  The common\nimpression that the Indian is naturally cruel and revengeful is\nentirely opposed to his philosophy and training.  The revengeful\ntendency of the Indian was aroused by the white man.  It is not the\nnatural Indian who is mean and tricky; not Massasoit but King\nPhilip; not Attackullakulla but Weatherford; not Wabashaw but\nLittle Crow; not Jumping Buffalo but Sitting Bull!  These men\nlifted their hands against the white man, while their fathers held\ntheirs out to him with gifts.",
        "Remember that there were councils which gave their decisions\nin accordance with the highest ideal of human justice before there\nwere any cities on this continent; before there were bridges to\nspan the Mississippi; before this network of railroads was dreamed\nof!  There were primitive communities upon the very spot where\nChicago or New York City now stands, where men were as children,\ninnocent of all the crimes now committed there daily and nightly. \nTrue morality is more easily maintained in connection with the\nsimple life.  You must accept the truth that you demoralize any\nrace whom you have subjugated.",
        "From this point of view we shall consider Sitting Bull’s\ncareer.  We say he is an untutored man: that is true so far as\nlearning of a literary type is concerned; but he was not an\nuntutored man when you view him from the standpoint of his nation. \nTo be sure, he did not learn his lessons from books.  This is\nsecond-hand information at best.  All that he learned he verified\nfor himself and put into daily practice.  In personal appearance he\nwas rather commonplace and made no immediate impression, but as he\ntalked he seemed to take hold of his hearers more and more.  He was\nbull-headed; quick to grasp a situation, and not readily induced to\nchange his mind.  He was not suspicious until he was forced to be\nso.  All his meaner traits were inevitably developed by the events\nof his later career.",
        "Sitting Bull’s history has been written many times by\nnewspaper men and army officers, but I find no account of him which\nis entirely correct.  I met him personally in 1884, and since his\ndeath I have gone thoroughly into the details of his life with his\nrelatives and contemporaries.  It has often been said that he was\na physical coward and not a warrior.  Judge of this for yourselves\nfrom the deed which first gave him fame in his own tribe, when he\nwas about twenty-eight years old.",
        "In an attack upon a band of Crow Indians, one of the enemy\ntook his stand, after the rest had fled, in a deep ditch from \nwhich it seemed impossible to dislodge him.  The situation had\nalready cost the lives of several warriors, but they could not let\nhim go to repeat such a boast over the Sioux!",
        "“Follow me!” said Sitting Bull, and charged.  He raced his\nhorse to the brim of the ditch and struck at the enemy with his\ncoup-staff, thus compelling him to expose himself to the fire of\nthe others while shooting his assailant.  But the Crow merely poked\nhis empty gun into his face and dodged back under cover.  Then\nSitting Bull stopped; he saw that no one had followed him, and he\nalso perceived that the enemy had no more ammunition left.  He rode\ndeliberately up to the barrier and threw his loaded gun over it;\nthen he went back to his party and told them what he thought of\nthem.",
        "“Now,” said he, “I have armed him, for I will not see a brave\nman killed unarmed.  I will strike him again with my coup-staff to\ncount the first feather; who will count the second?”",
        "Again he led the charge, and this time they all followed him. \nSitting Bull was severely wounded by his own gun in the hands of\nthe enemy, who was killed by those that came after him.  This is a\nrecord that so far as I know was never made by any other warrior.",
        "The second incident that made him well known was his taking of\na boy captive in battle with the Assiniboines.  He saved this boy’s\nlife and adopted him as his brother.  Hohay, as he was called, was\ndevoted to Sitting Bull and helped much in later years to spread\nhis fame.  Sitting Bull was a born diplomat, a ready speaker, and\nin middle life he ceased to go upon the warpath, to become the\ncouncilor of his people.  From this time on, this man represented\nhim in all important battles, and upon every brave deed done was\nwont to exclaim aloud:",
        "“I, Sitting Bull’s boy, do this in his name!”",
        "He had a nephew, now living, who resembles him strongly, and\nwho also represented him personally upon the field; and so far as\nthere is any remnant left of his immediate band, they look upon\nthis man One Bull as their chief.",
        "When Sitting Bull was a boy, there was no thought of trouble\nwith the whites.  He was acquainted with many of the early traders,\nPicotte, Choteau, Primeau, Larpenteur, and others, and liked them,\nas did most of his people in those days.  All the early records\nshow this friendly attitude of the Sioux, and the great fur\ncompanies for a century and a half depended upon them for the bulk\nof their trade.  It was not until the middle of the last century\nthat they woke up all of a sudden to the danger threatening their\nvery existence.  Yet at that time many of the old chiefs had been\nalready depraved by the whisky and other vices of the whites, and\nin the vicinity of the forts and trading posts at Sioux City, Saint\nPaul, and Cheyenne, there was general demoralization.  The\ndrunkards and hangers-on were ready to sell almost anything they\nhad for the favor of the trader.  The better and stronger element\nheld aloof.  They would not have anything of the white man except\nhis hatchet, gun, and knife.  They utterly refused to cede their\nlands; and as for the rest, they were willing to let him alone as\nlong as he did not interfere with their life and customs, which was\nnot long.",
        "It was not, however, the Unkpapa band of Sioux, Sitting Bull’s\nband, which first took up arms against the whites; and this was not\nbecause they had come less in contact with them, for they dwelt on\nthe Missouri River, the natural highway of trade.  As early as\n1854, the Ogallalas and Brules had trouble with the soldiers near\nFort Laramie; and again in 1857 Inkpaduta massacred several\nfamilies of settlers at Spirit Lake, Iowa.  Finally, in 1869, the\nMinnesota Sioux, goaded by many wrongs, arose and murdered many of\nthe settlers, afterward fleeing into the country of the Unkpapas\nand appealing to them for help, urging that all Indians should make\ncommon cause against the invader.  This brought Sitting Bull face\nto face with a question which was not yet fully matured in his own\nmind; but having satisfied himself of the justice of their cause,\nhe joined forces with the renegades during the summer of 1863, and\nfrom this time on he was an acknowledged leader.",
        "In 1865 and 1866 he met the Canadian half-breed, Louis Riel,\ninstigator of two rebellions, who had come across the line for\nsafety; and in fact at this time he harbored a number of outlaws\nand fugitives from justice.  His conversations with these,\nespecially with the French mixed-bloods, who inflamed his\nprejudices against the Americans, all had their influence in making\nof the wily Sioux a determined enemy to the white man.  While among\nhis own people he was always affable and genial, he became boastful\nand domineering in his dealings with the hated race.  He once\nremarked that “if we wish to make any impression upon the pale-face,\nit is necessary to put on his mask.”",
        "Sitting Bull joined in the attack on Fort Phil Kearny and in\nthe subsequent hostilities; but he accepted in good faith the\ntreaty of 1868, and soon after it was signed he visited Washington\nwith Red Cloud and Spotted Tail, on which occasion the three\ndistinguished chiefs attracted much attention and were entertained\nat dinner by President Grant and other notables.  He considered\nthat the life of the white man as he saw it was no life for his\npeople, but hoped by close adherence to the terms of this treaty to\npreserve the Big Horn and Black Hills country for a permanent\nhunting ground.  When gold was discovered and the irrepressible\ngold seekers made their historic dash across the plains into this\nforbidden paradise, then his faith in the white man’s honor was\ngone forever, and he took his final and most persistent stand in\ndefense of his nation and home.  His bitter and at the same time\nwell-grounded and philosophical dislike of the conquering race is\nwell expressed in a speech made before the purely Indian council\nbefore referred to, upon the Powder River.  I will give it in brief\nas it has been several times repeated to me by men who were\npresent.",
        "“Behold, my friends, the spring is come; the earth has gladly\nreceived the embraces of the sun, and we shall soon see the results\nof their love!  Every seed is awakened, and all animal life.  It is\nthrough this mysterious power that we too have our being, and we\ntherefore yield to our neighbors, even to our animal neighbors, the\nsame right as ourselves to inhabit this vast land.",
        "“Yet hear me, friends! we have now to deal with another\npeople, small and feeble when our forefathers first met with them,\nbut now great and overbearing.  Strangely enough, they have a mind\nto till the soil, and the love of possessions is a disease in them. \nThese people have made many rules that the rich may break, but the\npoor may not!  They have a religion in which the poor worship, but\nthe rich will not!  They even take tithes of the poor and weak to\nsupport the rich and those who rule.  They claim this mother of\nours, the Earth, for their own use, and fence their neighbors away\nfrom her, and deface her with their buildings and their refuse. \nThey compel her to produce out of season, and when sterile she is\nmade to take medicine in order to produce again.  All this is\nsacrilege.",
        "“This nation is like a spring freshet; it overruns its banks\nand destroys all who are in its path.  We cannot dwell side by\nside.  Only seven years ago we made a treaty by which we were\nassured that the buffalo country should be left to us forever.  Now\nthey threaten to take that from us also.  My brothers, shall we\nsubmit? or shall we say to them: ’First kill me, before you can\ntake possession of my fatherland!’”",
        "As Sitting Bull spoke, so he felt, and he had the courage to\nstand by his words.  Crazy Horse led his forces in the field; as\nfor him, he applied his energies to state affairs, and by his\nstrong and aggressive personality contributed much to holding the\nhostiles together.",
        "It may be said without fear of contradiction that Sitting Bull\nnever killed any women or children.  He was a fair fighter, and\nwhile not prominent in battle after his young manhood, he was the\nbrains of the Sioux resistance.  He has been called a “medicine\nman” and a “dreamer.”  Strictly speaking, he was neither of these,\nand the white historians are prone to confuse the two.  A medicine\nman is a doctor or healer; a dreamer is an active war prophet who\nleads his war party according to his dream or prophecy.  What is\ncalled by whites “making medicine” in war time is again a wrong\nconception.  Every warrior carries a bag of sacred or lucky charms,\nsupposed to protect the wearer alone, but it has nothing to do with\nthe success or safety of the party as a whole.  No one can make any\n“medicine” to affect the result of a battle, although it has been\nsaid that Sitting Bull did this at the battle of the Little Big\nHorn.",
        "When Custer and Reno attacked the camp at both ends, the chief\nwas caught napping.  The village was in danger of surprise, and the\nwomen and children must be placed in safety.  Like other men of his\nage, Sitting Bull got his family together for flight, and then\njoined the warriors on the Reno side of the attack.  Thus he was\nnot in the famous charge against Custer; nevertheless, his voice\nwas heard exhorting the warriors throughout that day.",
        "During the autumn of 1876, after the fall of Custer, Sitting\nBull was hunted all through the Yellowstone region by the military. \nThe following characteristic letter, doubtless written at his\ndictation by a half-breed interpreter, was sent to Colonel Otis\nimmediately after a daring attack upon his wagon train.",
        "“I want to know what you are doing, traveling on this road. \nYou scare all the buffalo away.  I want to hunt in this place.  I\nwant you to turn back from here.  If you don’t, I will fight you\nagain.  I want you to leave what you have got here and turn back\nfrom here.",
        "    I am your friend",
        "    Sitting Bull.\nI mean all the rations you have got and some powder.  Wish you\nwould write me as soon as you can.”",
        "Otis, however, kept on and joined Colonel Miles, who followed\nSitting Bull with about four hundred soldiers.  He overtook him at\nlast on Cedar Creek, near the Yellowstone, and the two met midway\nbetween the lines for a parley.  The army report says: “Sitting\nBull wanted peace in his own way.”  The truth was that he wanted\nnothing more than had been guaranteed to them by the treaty of 1868\n– the exclusive possession of their last hunting ground.  This the\ngovernment was not now prepared to grant, as it had been decided to\nplace all the Indians under military control upon the various\nreservations.",
        "Since it was impossible to reconcile two such conflicting\ndemands, the hostiles were driven about from pillar to post for\nseveral more years, and finally took refuge across the line in\nCanada, where Sitting Bull had placed his last hope of justice and\nfreedom for his race.  Here he was joined from time to time by\nparties of malcontents from the reservation, driven largely by\nstarvation and ill-treatment to seek another home.  Here, too, they\nwere followed by United States commissioners, headed by General\nTerry, who endeavored to persuade him to return, promising\nabundance of food and fair treatment, despite the fact that the\nexiles were well aware of the miserable condition of the “good\nIndians” upon the reservations.  He first refused to meet them at\nall, and only did so when advised to that effect by Major Walsh of\nthe Canadian mounted police.  This was his characteristic remark:\n“If you have one honest man in Washington, send him here and I will\ntalk to him.”",
        "Sitting Bull was not moved by fair words; but when he found\nthat if they had liberty on that side, they had little else, that\nthe Canadian government would give them protection but no food;\nthat the buffalo had been all but exterminated and his starving\npeople were already beginning to desert him, he was compelled at\nlast, in 1881, to report at Fort Buford, North Dakota, with his\nband of hungry, homeless, and discouraged refugees.  It was, after\nall, to hunger and not to the strong arm of the military that he\nsurrendered in the end.",
        "In spite of the invitation that had been extended to him in\nthe name of the “Great Father” at Washington, he was immediately\nthrown into a military prison, and afterward handed over to Colonel\nCody (\"Buffalo Bill”) as an advertisement for his “Wild West Show.” \nAfter traveling about for several years with the famous showman,\nthus increasing his knowledge of the weaknesses as well as the\nstrength of the white man, the deposed and humiliated chief settled\ndown quietly with his people upon the Standing Rock agency in North\nDakota, where his immediate band occupied the Grand River district\nand set to raising cattle and horses.  They made good progress;\nmuch better, in fact, than that of the “coffee-coolers” or “loafer\"\nIndians, received the missionaries kindly and were soon a\nchurch-going people.",
        "When the Commissions of 1888 and 1889 came to treat with the\nSioux for a further cession of land and a reduction of their\nreservations, nearly all were opposed to consent on any terms. \nNevertheless, by hook or by crook, enough signatures were finally\nobtained to carry the measure through, although it is said that\nmany were those of women and the so-called “squaw-men”, who had no\nrights in the land.  At the same time, rations were cut down, and\nthere was general hardship and dissatisfaction.  Crazy Horse was\nlong since dead; Spotted Tail had fallen at the hands of one of his\nown tribe; Red Cloud had become a feeble old man, and the\ndisaffected among the Sioux began once more to look to Sitting Bull\nfor leadership.",
        "At this crisis a strange thing happened.  A half-breed Indian\nin Nevada promulgated the news that the Messiah had appeared to him\nupon a peak in the Rockies, dressed in rabbit skins, and bringing\na message to the red race.  The message was to the effect that\nsince his first coming had been in vain, since the white people had\ndoubted and reviled him, had nailed him to the cross, and trampled\nupon his doctrines, he had come again in pity to save the Indian. \nHe declared that he would cause the earth to shake and to overthrow\nthe cities of the whites and destroy them, that the buffalo would\nreturn, and the land belong to the red race forever!  These events\nwere to come to pass within two years; and meanwhile they were to\nprepare for his coming by the ceremonies and dances which he\ncommanded.",
        "This curious story spread like wildfire and met with eager\nacceptance among the suffering and discontented people.  The\nteachings of Christian missionaries had prepared them to believe in\na Messiah, and the prescribed ceremonial was much more in accord\nwith their traditions than the conventional worship of the\nchurches.  Chiefs of many tribes sent delegations to the Indian\nprophet; Short Bull, Kicking Bear, and others went from among the\nSioux, and on their return all inaugurated the dances at once. \nThere was an attempt at first to keep the matter secret, but it\nsoon became generally known and seriously disconcerted the Indian\nagents and others, who were quick to suspect a hostile conspiracy\nunder all this religious enthusiasm.  As a matter of fact, there\nwas no thought of an uprising; the dancing was innocent enough, and\npathetic enough their despairing hope in a pitiful Saviour who\nshould overwhelm their oppressors and bring back their golden age.",
        "When the Indians refused to give up the “Ghost Dance” at the\nbidding of the authorities, the growing suspicion and alarm focused\nupon Sitting Bull, who in spirit had never been any too submissive,\nand it was determined to order his arrest.  At the special request\nof Major McLaughlin, agent at Standing Rock, forty of his Indian\npolice were sent out to Sitting Bull’s home on Grand River to\nsecure his person (followed at some little distance by a body of\nUnited States troops for reinforcement, in case of trouble).  These\npolice are enlisted from among the tribesmen at each agency, and\nhave proved uniformly brave and faithful.  They entered the cabin\nat daybreak, aroused the chief from a sound slumber, helped him to\ndress, and led him unresisting from the house; but when he came out\nin the gray dawn of that December morning in 1890, to find his\ncabin surrounded by armed men and himself led away to he knew not\nwhat fate, he cried out loudly:",
        "“They have taken me: what say you to it?”",
        "Men poured out of the neighboring houses, and in a few minutes\nthe police were themselves surrounded with an excited and rapidly\nincreasing throng.  They harangued the crowd in vain; Sitting\nBull’s blood was up, and he again appealed to his men.  His adopted\nbrother, the Assiniboine captive whose life he had saved so many\nyears before, was the first to fire.  His shot killed Lieutenant\nBull Head, who held Sitting Bull by the arm.  Then there was a\nshort but sharp conflict, in which Sitting Bull and six of his\ndefenders and six of the Indian police were slain, with many more\nwounded.  The chief’s young son, Crow Foot, and his devoted\n“brother” died with him.  When all was over, and the terrified\npeople had fled precipitately across the river, the soldiers\nappeared upon the brow of the long hill and fired their Hotchkiss\nguns into the deserted camp.",
        "Thus ended the life of a natural strategist of no mean courage\nand ability.  The great chief was buried without honors outside the\ncemetery at the post, and for some years the grave was marked by a\nmere board at its head.  Recently some women have built a cairn of\nrocks there in token of respect and remembrance.",
