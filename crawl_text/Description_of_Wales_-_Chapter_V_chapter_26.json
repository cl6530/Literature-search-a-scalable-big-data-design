Immoderate in their love of food and\nintoxicating drink, they say with the Apostle, “We are instructed\nboth to abound, and to suffer need;” but do not add with him,\n“becoming all things to all men, that I might by all means save\nsome.”  As in times of scarcity their abstinence and parsimony are\ntoo severe, so, when seated at another man’s table, after a long\nfasting, (like wolves and eagles, who, like them, live by plunder,\nand are rarely satisfied,) their appetite is immoderate.  They are\ntherefore penurious in times of scarcity, and extravagant in times\nof plenty; but no man, as in England, mortgages his property for\nthe gluttonous gratification of his own appetite.  They wish,\nhowever, that all people would join with them in their bad habits\nand expenses; as the commission of crimes reduces to a level all\nthose who are concerned in the perpetration of them.",
