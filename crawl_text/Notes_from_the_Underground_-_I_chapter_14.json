        "\nAT THAT TIME I was only twenty-four.  My life was even then gloomy, ill-\nregulated, and as solitary as that of a savage.  I made friends with no one\nand positively avoided talking, and buried myself more and more in my\nhole.  At work in the office I never looked at anyone, and was perfectly\nwell aware that my companions looked upon me, not only as a queer\nfellow, but even looked upon me—I always fancied this—with a sort of\nloathing.  I sometimes wondered why it was that nobody except me\nfancied that he was looked upon with aversion?  One of the clerks had a\nmost repulsive, pock-marked face, which looked positively villainous.  I\nbelieve I should not have dared to look at anyone with such an unsightly\ncountenance.  Another had such a very dirty old uniform that there was\nan unpleasant odour in his proximity.  Yet not one of these gentlemen\nshowed the slightest self-consciousness—either about their clothes or\ntheir countenance or their character in any way.  Neither of them ever\nimagined that they were looked at with repulsion; if they had imagined it\nthey would not have minded—so long as their superiors did not look at\nthem in that way.  It is clear to me now that, owing to my unbounded\nvanity and to the high standard I set for myself, I often looked at myself\nwith furious discontent, which verged on loathing, and so I inwardly\nattributed the same feeling to everyone.  I hated my face, for instance: I\nthought it disgusting, and even suspected that there was something base\nin my expression, and so every day when I turned up at the office I tried to\nbehave as independently as possible, and to assume a lofty expression, so\nthat I might not be suspected of being abject.  “My face may be ugly,” I\nthought, “but let it be lofty, expressive, and, above all, EXTREMELY\nintelligent.”  But I was positively and painfully certain that it was\nimpossible for my countenance ever to express those qualities.  And what was\nworst of all, I thought it actually stupid looking, and I would have been quite\nsatisfied if I could have looked intelligent.  In fact, I would even have put\nup with looking base if, at the same time, my face could have been\nthought strikingly intelligent.",
        "Of course, I hated my fellow clerks one and all, and I despised them all,\nyet at the same time I was, as it were, afraid of them.  In fact, it happened at\ntimes that I thought more highly of them than of myself.  It somehow\nhappened quite suddenly that I alternated between despising them and\nthinking them superior to myself.  A cultivated and decent man cannot be\nvain without setting a fearfully high standard for himself, and without\ndespising and almost hating himself at certain moments.  But whether I\ndespised them or thought them superior I dropped my eyes almost every\ntime I met anyone.  I even made experiments whether I could face so and\nso’s looking at me, and I was always the first to drop my eyes.  This worried\nme to distraction.  I had a sickly dread, too, of being ridiculous, and so had\na slavish passion for the conventional in everything external.  I loved to fall\ninto the common rut, and had a whole-hearted terror of any kind of\neccentricity in myself.  But how could I live up to it?  I was morbidly\nsensitive as a man of our age should be.  They were all stupid, and as like\none another as so many sheep.  Perhaps I was the only one in the office who\nfancied that I was a coward and a slave, and I fancied it just because I was\nmore highly developed.  But it was not only that I fancied it, it really was so. \nI was a coward and a slave.  I say this without the slightest embarrassment.\nEvery decent man of our age must be a coward and a slave.  That is his\nnormal condition.  Of that I am firmly persuaded.  He is made and constructed\nto that very end.  And not only at the present time owing to some\ncasual circumstances, but always, at all times, a decent man is bound to\nbe a coward and a slave.  It is the law of nature for all decent people all over\nthe earth.  If anyone of them happens to be valiant about something, he\nneed not be comforted nor carried away by that; he would show the white\nfeather just the same before something else.  That is how it invariably and\ninevitably ends.  Only donkeys and mules are valiant, and they only till\nthey are pushed up to the wall.  It is not worth while to pay attention to\nthem for they really are of no consequence.",
        "Another circumstance, too, worried me in those days: that there was no\none like me and I was unlike anyone else.  “I am alone and they are\nEVERYONE,” I thought—and pondered.",
        "From that it is evident that I was still a youngster.",
        "The very opposite sometimes happened.  It was loathsome sometimes\nto go to the office; things reached such a point that I often came home ill. \nBut all at once, A PROPOS of nothing, there would come a phase of\nscepticism and indifference (everything happened in phases to me), and I\nwould laugh myself at my intolerance and fastidiousness, I would reproach\nmyself with being ROMANTIC.  At one time I was unwilling to speak\nto anyone, while at other times I would not only talk, but go to the length\nof contemplating making friends with them.  All my fastidiousness would\nsuddenly, for no rhyme or reason, vanish.  Who knows, perhaps I never\nhad really had it, and it had simply been affected, and got out of books.  I\nhave not decided that question even now.  Once I quite made friends with\nthem, visited their homes, played preference, drank vodka, talked of\npromotions ....  But here let me make a digression.",
        "We Russians, speaking generally, have never had those foolish\ntranscendental “romantics\"—German, and still more French—on whom\nnothing produces any effect; if there were an earthquake, if all France\nperished at the barricades, they would still be the same, they would not\neven have the decency to affect a change, but would still go on singing\ntheir transcendental songs to the hour of their death, because they are\nfools.  We, in Russia, have no fools; that is well known.  That is what\ndistinguishes us from foreign lands.  Consequently these transcendental\nnatures are not found amongst us in their pure form.  The idea that they\nare is due to our “realistic” journalists and critics of that day, always on\nthe look out for Kostanzhoglos and Uncle Pyotr Ivanitchs and foolishly\naccepting them as our ideal; they have slandered our romantics, taking\nthem for the same transcendental sort as in Germany or France.  On the\ncontrary, the characteristics of our “romantics” are absolutely and directly\nopposed to the transcendental European type, and no European\nstandard can be applied to them.  (Allow me to make use of this word\n“romantic\"—an old-fashioned and much respected word which has\ndone good service and is familiar to all.)  The characteristics of our\nromantic are to understand everything, TO SEE EVERYTHING AND TO SEE IT\nOFTEN INCOMPARABLY MORE CLEARLY THAN OUR MOST REALISTIC MINDS SEE IT; to\nrefuse to accept anyone or anything, but at the same time not to despise\nanything; to give way, to yield, from policy; never to lose sight of a useful\npractical object (such as rent-free quarters at the government expense,\npensions, decorations), to keep their eye on that object through all the\nenthusiasms and volumes of lyrical poems, and at the same time to preserve\n“the sublime and the beautiful” inviolate within them to the hour of\ntheir death, and to preserve themselves also, incidentally, like some precious\njewel wrapped in cotton wool if only for the benefit of “the sublime\nand the beautiful.”  Our “romantic” is a man of great breadth and the\ngreatest rogue of all our rogues, I assure you ....  I can assure you from\nexperience, indeed.  Of course, that is, if he is intelligent.  But what am I\nsaying!  The romantic is always intelligent, and I only meant to observe\nthat although we have had foolish romantics they don’t count, and they\nwere only so because in the flower of their youth they degenerated into\nGermans, and to preserve their precious jewel more comfortably, settled\nsomewhere out there—by preference in Weimar or the Black Forest.",
        "I, for instance, genuinely despised my official work and did not openly\nabuse it simply because I was in it myself and got a salary for it.  Anyway,\ntake note, I did not openly abuse it.  Our romantic would rather go out of\nhis mind—a thing, however, which very rarely happens—than take to\nopen abuse, unless he had some other career in view; and he is never\nkicked out.  At most, they would take him to the lunatic asylum as “the\nKing of Spain” if he should go very mad.  But it is only the thin, fair people\nwho go out of their minds in Russia.  Innumerable “romantics” attain later\nin life to considerable rank in the service.  Their many-sidedness is\nremarkable!  And what a faculty they have for the most contradictory\nsensations!  I was comforted by this thought even in those days, and I am of\nthe same opinion now.  That is why there are so many “broad natures” among\nus who never lose their ideal even in the depths of degradation; and though\nthey never stir a finger for their ideal, though they are arrant thieves and\nknaves, yet they tearfully cherish their first ideal and are extraordinarily\nhonest at heart.  Yes, it is only among us that the most incorrigible rogue\ncan be absolutely and loftily honest at heart without in the least ceasing to\nbe a rogue.  I repeat, our romantics, frequently, become such accomplished\nrascals (I use the term “rascals” affectionately), suddenly display\nsuch a sense of reality and practical knowledge that their bewildered superiors\nand the public generally can only ejaculate in amazement.",
        "Their many-sidedness is really amazing, and goodness knows what it\nmay develop into later on, and what the future has in store for us.  It is not\na poor material!  I do not say this from any foolish or boastful patriotism. \nBut I feel sure that you are again imagining that I am joking.  Or perhaps\nit’s just the contrary and you are convinced that I really think so.  Anyway,\ngentlemen, I shall welcome both views as an honour and a special favour. \nAnd do forgive my digression.",
        "I did not, of course, maintain friendly relations with my comrades and\nsoon was at loggerheads with them, and in my youth and inexperience I\neven gave up bowing to them, as though I had cut off all relations.  That,\nhowever, only happened to me once.  As a rule, I was always alone.",
        "In the first place I spent most of my time at home, reading.  I tried to\nstifle all that was continually seething within me by means of external\nimpressions.  And the only external means I had was reading.  Reading, of\ncourse, was a great help—exciting me, giving me pleasure and pain.  But\nat times it bored me fearfully.  One longed for movement in spite of\neverything, and I plunged all at once into dark, underground, loathsome\nvice of the pettiest kind.  My wretched passions were acute, smarting,\nfrom my continual, sickly irritability I had hysterical impulses, with\ntears and convulsions.  I had no resource except reading, that is, there was\nnothing in my surroundings which I could respect and which attracted\nme. I was overwhelmed with depression, too; I had an hysterical craving\nfor incongruity and for contrast, and so I took to vice.  I have not said all\nthis to justify myself ....  But, no!  I am lying.  I did want to justify\nmyself.  I make that little observation for my own benefit, gentlemen.  I don’t\nwant to lie.  I vowed to myself I would not.",
        "And so, furtively, timidly, in solitude, at night, I indulged in filthy\nvice, with a feeling of shame which never deserted me, even at the most\nloathsome moments, and which at such moments nearly made me curse. \nAlready even then I had my underground world in my soul.  I was\nfearfully afraid of being seen, of being met, of being recognised.  I visited\nvarious obscure haunts.",
        "One night as I was passing a tavern I saw through a lighted window\nsome gentlemen fighting with billiard cues, and saw one of them thrown\nout of the window.  At other times I should have felt very much disgusted,\nbut I was in such a mood at the time, that I actually envied the gentleman\nthrown out of the window—and I envied him so much that I even went\ninto the tavern and into the billiard-room.  “Perhaps,” I thought, “I’ll\nhave a fight, too, and they’ll throw me out of the window.”",
        "I was not drunk—but what is one to do—depression will drive a man\nto such a pitch of hysteria?  But nothing happened.  It seemed that I was\nnot even equal to being thrown out of the window and I went away\nwithout having my fight.",
        "An officer put me in my place from the first moment.",
        "I was standing by the billiard-table and in my ignorance blocking up\nthe way, and he wanted to pass; he took me by the shoulders and without a\nword—without a warning or explanation—moved me from where I was\nstanding to another spot and passed by as though he had not noticed me.  I\ncould have forgiven blows, but I could not forgive his having moved me\nwithout noticing me.",
        "Devil knows what I would have given for a real regular quarrel—a\nmore decent, a more LITERARY one, so to speak.  I had been treated like a\nfly.  This officer was over six foot, while I was a spindly little fellow.  But\nthe quarrel was in my hands.  I had only to protest and I certainly would\nhave been thrown out of the window.  But I changed my mind and\npreferred to beat a resentful retreat.",
        "I went out of the tavern straight home, confused and troubled, and the\nnext night I went out again with the same lewd intentions, still more\nfurtively, abjectly and miserably than before, as it were, with tears in my\neyes—but still I did go out again.  Don’t imagine, though, it was coward-\nice made me slink away from the officer; I never have been a coward at\nheart, though I have always been a coward in action.  Don’t be in a hurry\nto laugh—I assure you I can explain it all.",
        "Oh, if only that officer had been one of the sort who would consent to\nfight a duel!  But no, he was one of those gentlemen (alas, long extinct!)\nwho preferred fighting with cues or, like Gogol’s Lieutenant Pirogov,\nappealing to the police.  They did not fight duels and would have thought\na duel with a civilian like me an utterly unseemly procedure in any\ncase—and they looked upon the duel altogether as something impossible,\nsomething free-thinking and French.  But they were quite ready to\nbully, especially when they were over six foot.",
        "I did not slink away through cowardice, but through an unbounded\nvanity.  I was afraid not of his six foot, not of getting a sound thrashing and\nbeing thrown out of the window; I should have had physical courage\nenough, I assure you; but I had not the moral courage.  What I was afraid of\nwas that everyone present, from the insolent marker down to the lowest\nlittle stinking, pimply clerk in a greasy collar, would jeer at me and fail to\nunderstand when I began to protest and to address them in literary language.\nFor of the point of honour—not of honour, but of the point of\nhonour (POINT D’HONNEUR)—one cannot speak among us except in literary\nlanguage.  You can’t allude to the “point of honour” in ordinary language. \nI was fully convinced (the sense of reality, in spite of all my romanticism!)\nthat they would all simply split their sides with laughter, and that the\nofficer would not simply beat me, that is, without insulting me, but would\ncertainly prod me in the back with his knee, kick me round the billiard-\ntable, and only then perhaps have pity and drop me out of the window.",
        "Of course, this trivial incident could not with me end in that.  I often\nmet that officer afterwards in the street and noticed him very carefully.  I\nam not quite sure whether he recognised me, I imagine not; I judge from\ncertain signs.  But I—I stared at him with spite and hatred and so it went\non ... for several years!  My resentment grew even deeper with years.  At\nfirst I began making stealthy inquiries about this officer.  It was difficult\nfor me to do so, for I knew no one.  But one day I heard someone shout his\nsurname in the street as I was following him at a distance, as though I\nwere tied to him—and so I learnt his surname.  Another time I followed\nhim to his flat, and for ten kopecks learned from the porter where he\nlived, on which storey, whether he lived alone or with others, and so\non—in fact, everything one could learn from a porter.  One morning,\nthough I had never tried my hand with the pen, it suddenly occurred to\nme to write a satire on this officer in the form of a novel which would unmask\nhis villainy.  I wrote the novel with relish.  I did unmask his villainy,\nI even exaggerated it; at first I so altered his surname that it could easily be\nrecognised, but on second thoughts I changed it, and sent the story to the\nOTETCHESTVENNIYA ZAPISKI.  But at that time such attacks were not the\nfashion and my story was not printed.  That was a great vexation to me.",
        "Sometimes I was positively choked with resentment.  At last I determined\nto challenge my enemy to a duel.  I composed a splendid, charming\nletter to him, imploring him to apologise to me, and hinting rather\nplainly at a duel in case of refusal.  The letter was so composed that if the\nofficer had had the least understanding of the sublime and the beautiful\nhe would certainly have flung himself on my neck and have offered me\nhis friendship.  And how fine that would have been!  How we should have\ngot on together!  “He could have shielded me with his higher rank, while I\ncould have improved his mind with my culture, and, well ... my ideas,\nand all sorts of things might have happened.”  Only fancy, this was two\nyears after his insult to me, and my challenge would have been a\nridiculous anachronism, in spite of all the ingenuity of my letter in\ndisguising and explaining away the anachronism.  But, thank God (to this\nday I thank the Almighty with tears in my eyes) I did not send the letter to\nhim.  Cold shivers run down my back when I think of what might have\nhappened if I had sent it.",
        "And all at once I revenged myself in the simplest way, by a stroke of\ngenius!  A brilliant thought suddenly dawned upon me.  Sometimes on\nholidays I used to stroll along the sunny side of the Nevsky about four\no’clock in the afternoon.  Though it was hardly a stroll so much as a series of\ninnumerable miseries, humiliations and resentments; but no doubt that\nwas just what I wanted.  I used to wriggle along in a most unseemly fashion,\nlike an eel, continually moving aside to make way for generals, for officers\nof the guards and the hussars, or for ladies.  At such minutes there used to be\na convulsive twinge at my heart, and I used to feel hot all down my back at\nthe mere thought of the wretchedness of my attire, of the wretchedness and\nabjectness of my little scurrying figure.  This was a regular martyrdom, a\ncontinual, intolerable humiliation at the thought, which passed into an\nincessant and direct sensation, that I was a mere fly in the eyes of all this\nworld, a nasty, disgusting fly—more intelligent, more highly developed,\nmore refined in feeling than any of them, of course—but a fly that was\ncontinually making way for everyone, insulted and injured by everyone. \nWhy I inflicted this torture upon myself, why I went to the Nevsky, I don’t\nknow.  I felt simply drawn there at every possible opportunity.",
        "Already then I began to experience a rush of the enjoyment of which I\nspoke in the first chapter.  After my affair with the officer I felt even more\ndrawn there than before: it was on the Nevsky that I met him most frequently,\nthere I could admire him.  He, too, went there chiefly on holidays,\nHe, too, turned out of his path for generals and persons of high rank, and\nhe too, wriggled between them like an eel; but people, like me, or even\nbetter dressed than me, he simply walked over; he made straight for them\nas though there was nothing but empty space before him, and never, under\nany circumstances, turned aside.  I gloated over my resentment watching\nhim and ... always resentfully made way for him.  It exasperated me that\neven in the street I could not be on an even footing with him.",
        "“Why must you invariably be the first to move aside?” I kept asking\nmyself in hysterical rage, waking up sometimes at three o’clock in the\nmorning.  “Why is it you and not he?  There’s no regulation about it;\nthere’s no written law.  Let the making way be equal as it usually is when\nrefined people meet; he moves half-way and you move half-way; you pass\nwith mutual respect.”",
        "But that never happened, and I always moved aside, while he did not\neven notice my making way for him.  And lo and behold a bright idea\ndawned upon me!  “What,” I thought, “if I meet him and don’t move on\none side?  What if I don’t move aside on purpose, even if I knock up\nagainst him?  How would that be?” This audacious idea took such a hold\non me that it gave me no peace.  I was dreaming of it continually, horribly,\nand I purposely went more frequently to the Nevsky in order to picture\nmore vividly how I should do it when I did do it.  I was delighted.  This\nintention seemed to me more and more practical and possible.",
        "“Of course I shall not really push him,” I thought, already more good-\nnatured in my joy.  “I will simply not turn aside, will run up against him,\nnot very violently, but just shouldering each other—just as much as\ndecency permits.  I will push against him just as much as he pushes\nagainst me.”  At last I made up my mind completely.  But my preparations\ntook a great deal of time.  To begin with, when I carried out my plan I\nshould need to be looking rather more decent, and so I had to think of my\nget-up.  “In case of emergency, if, for instance, there were any sort of\npublic scandal (and the public there is of the most RECHERCHE: the Countess\nwalks there; Prince D. walks there; all the literary world is there), I must\nbe well dressed; that inspires respect and of itself puts us on an equal\nfooting in the eyes of the society.”",
        "With this object I asked for some of my salary in advance, and bought at\nTchurkin’s a pair of black gloves and a decent hat.  Black gloves seemed to\nme both more dignified and BON TON than the lemon-coloured ones which\nI had contemplated at first.  “The colour is too gaudy, it looks as though one\nwere trying to be conspicuous,” and I did not take the lemon-coloured\nones.  I had got ready long beforehand a good shirt, with white bone studs;\nmy overcoat was the only thing that held me back.  The coat in itself was a\nvery good one, it kept me warm; but it was wadded and it had a raccoon\ncollar which was the height of vulgarity.  I had to change the collar at any\nsacrifice, and to have a beaver one like an officer’s.  For this purpose I\nbegan visiting the Gostiny Dvor and after several attempts I pitched upon a\npiece of cheap German beaver.  Though these German beavers soon grow\nshabby and look wretched, yet at first they look exceedingly well, and I\nonly needed it for the occasion.  I asked the price; even so, it was too\nexpensive.  After thinking it over thoroughly I decided to sell my raccoon\ncollar.  The rest of the money—a considerable sum for me, I decided to\nborrow from Anton Antonitch Syetotchkin, my immediate superior, an\nunassuming person, though grave and judicious.  He never lent money to\nanyone, but I had, on entering the service, been specially recommended\nto him by an important personage who had got me my berth.  I was\nhorribly worried.  To borrow from Anton Antonitch seemed to me monstrous\nand shameful.  I did not sleep for two or three nights.  Indeed, I did\nnot sleep well at that time, I was in a fever; I had a vague sinking at my heart\nor else a sudden throbbing, throbbing, throbbing!  Anton Antonitch was\nsurprised at first, then he frowned, then he reflected, and did after all lend\nme the money, receiving from me a written authorisation to take from my\nsalary a fortnight later the sum that he had lent me.",
        "In this way everything was at last ready.  The handsome beaver replaced\nthe mean-looking raccoon, and I began by degrees to get to work.  It\nwould never have done to act offhand, at random; the plan had to be\ncarried out skilfully, by degrees.  But I must confess that after many efforts\nI began to despair: we simply could not run into each other.  I made every\npreparation, I was quite determined—it seemed as though we should run\ninto one another directly—and before I knew what I was doing I had\nstepped aside for him again and he had passed without noticing me.  I\neven prayed as I approached him that God would grant me determination.\nOne time I had made up my mind thoroughly, but it ended in my\nstumbling and falling at his feet because at the very last instant when I\nwas six inches from him my courage failed me.  He very calmly stepped\nover me, while I flew on one side like a ball.  That night I was ill again,\nfeverish and delirious.",
        "And suddenly it ended most happily.  The night before I had made up\nmy mind not to carry out my fatal plan and to abandon it all, and with\nthat object I went to the Nevsky for the last time, just to see how I would\nabandon it all.  Suddenly, three paces from my enemy, I unexpectedly\nmade up my mind—I closed my eyes, and we ran full tilt, shoulder to\nshoulder, against one another!  I did not budge an inch and passed him on\na perfectly equal footing!  He did not even look round and pretended not\nto notice it; but he was only pretending, I am convinced of that.  I am\nconvinced of that to this day!  Of course, I got the worst of it—he was\nstronger, but that was not the point.  The point was that I had attained my\nobject, I had kept up my dignity, I had not yielded a step, and had put\nmyself publicly on an equal social footing with him.  I returned home\nfeeling that I was fully avenged for everything.  I was delighted.  I was\ntriumphant and sang Italian arias.  Of course, I will not describe to you\nwhat happened to me three days later; if you have read my first chapter\nyou can guess for yourself.  The officer was afterwards transferred; I have\nnot seen him now for fourteen years.  What is the dear fellow doing now?\nWhom is he walking over?",
