        "    “No pleasure is comparable to the standing upon the\n    vantage ground of truth.\"–BACON.",
        "                   “Divine Philosophy!\n    Not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose,\n    But musical as is Apollo’s lute,\n    And a perpetual feast of nectar’d sweets\n    Where no crude surfeit reigns.\"–MILTON.",
        "It may seem rather surprising to include education among the pleasures of\nlife; for in too many cases it is made odious to the young, and is\nsupposed to cease with school; while, on the contrary, if it is to be\nreally successful it must be suitable, and therefore interesting, to\nchildren, and must last through life. The very process of acquiring\nknowledge is a privilege and a blessing. It used to be said that there was\nno royal road to learning; it would be more true to say that the avenues\nleading to it are all royal.",
        "“It is not,” says Jeremy Taylor, “the eye that sees the beauties of\nheaven, nor the ear that hears the sweetness of music, or the glad tidings\nof a prosperous accident; but the soul that perceives all the relishes of\nsensual and intellectual perceptions: and the more noble and excellent the\nsoul is, the greater and more savory are its perceptions. And if a child\nbehold the rich ermine, or the diamonds of a starry night, or the order of\nthe world, or hears the discourses of an apostle; because he makes no\nreflex act on himself and sees not what he sees, he can have but the\npleasure of a fool or the deliciousness of a mule.”",
        "Herein lies the importance of education. I say education rather than\ninstruction, because it is far more important to cultivate the mind than\nto store the memory. Studies are a means and not an end. “To spend too\nmuch time in studies is sloth; to use them too much for ornament is\naffectation; to make judgment wholly by their rules is the humor of a\nscholar: they perfect nature, and are perfected by experience.... Crafty\nmen contemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them.” [1]",
        "Moreover, though, as Mill says, “in the comparatively early state of human\ndevelopment in which we now live, a person cannot indeed feel that\nentireness of sympathy with all others which would make any real\ndiscordance in the general direction of their conduct in life impossible,\"\nyet education might surely do more to root in us the feeling of unity with\nour fellow-creatures. At any rate, if we do not study in this spirit, all\nour learning will but leave us as weak and sad as Faust.",
        "  “I’ve now, alas! Philosophy,\n     Medicine and Jurisprudence too,\n   And to my cost Theology,\n     With ardent labor studied through,\n   And here I stand, with all my lore\n     Poor fool, no wiser than before.” [2]",
        "Our studies should be neither “a couch on which to rest; nor a cloister in\nwhich to promenade alone; nor a tower from which to look down on others;\nnor a fortress whence we may resist them; nor a workshop for gain and\nmerchandise; but a rich armory and treasury for the glory of the creator\nand the ennoblement of life.” [3]",
        "For in the noble words of Epictetus, “you will do the greatest service to\nthe state if you shall raise, not the roofs of the houses, but the souls\nof the citizens: for it is better that great souls should dwell in small\nhouses rather than for mean slaves to lurk in great houses.”",
        "It is then of great importance to consider whether our present system of\neducation is the one best calculated to fulfil these great objects. Does\nit really give that love of learning which is better than learning itself?\nDoes all the study of the classics to which our sons devote so many years\ngive any just appreciation of them; or do they not on leaving college too\noften feel with Byron–",
        "    “Then farewell, Horace; whom I hated so!”",
        "Too much concentration on any one subject is a great mistake, especially\nin early life. Nature herself indicates the true system, if we would but\nlisten to her. Our instincts are good guides, though not infallible, and\nchildren will profit little by lessons which do not interest them. In\ncheerfulness, says Pliny, is the success of our studies–\"studia\nhilaritate proveniunt\"–and we may with advantage take a lesson from\nTheognis, who, in his Ode on the Marriage of Cadmus and Harmonia, makes\nthe Muses sing:",
        "  “What is good and fair,\n  Shall ever be our care;\n    Thus the burden of it rang,\n  That shall never be our care,\n  Which is neither good nor fair.\n    Such were the words your lips immortal sang.”",
        "There are some who seem to think that our educational system is as good as\npossible, and that the only remaining points of importance are the number\nof schools and scholars, the question of fees, the relation of voluntary\nand board schools, etc. “No doubt,” says Mr. Symonds, in his Sketches in\nItaly and Greece, “there are many who think that when we not only\nadvocate education but discuss the best system we are simply beating the\nair; that our population is as happy and cultivated as can be, and that no\nsubstantial advance is really possible. Mr. Galton, however, has expressed\nthe opinion, and most of those who have written on the social condition of\nAthens seem to agree with him, that the population of Athens, taken as a\nwhole, was as superior to us as we are to Australian savages.”",
        "That there is, indeed, some truth in this, probably no student of Greek\nhistory will deny. Why, then, should this be so? I cannot but think that\nour system of education is partly responsible.",
        "Manual and science teaching need not in any way interfere with instruction\nin other subjects. Though so much has been said about the importance of\nscience and the value of technical instruction, or of hand-training, as I\nshould prefer to call it, it is unfortunately true that in our system of\neducation, from the highest schools downward, both of them are sadly\nneglected, and the study of language reigns supreme.",
        "This is no new complaint. Ascham, in The Schoolmaster, long ago lamented\nit; Milton, in his letter to Mr. Samuel Hartlib, complained “that our\nchildren are forced to stick unreasonably in these grammatick flats and\nshallows;” and observes that, “though a linguist should pride himself to\nhave all the tongues Babel cleft the world into, yet, if he have not\nstudied the solid things in them as well as the words and lexicons, he\nwere nothing so much to be esteemed a learned man as any yeoman or\ntradesman competently wise in his mother dialect only;” and Locke said\nthat “schools fit us for the university rather than for the world.\"\nCommission after commission, committee after committee, have reiterated\nthe same complaint. How then do we stand now?",
        "I see it indeed constantly stated that, even if the improvement is not so\nrapid as could be desired, still we are making considerable progress. But\nis this so? I fear not. I fear that our present system does not really\ntrain the mind, or cultivate the power of observation, or even give the\namount of information which we may reasonably expect from the time devoted\nto it.",
        "Sir M. E. Grant-Duff has expressed the opinion that a boy or girl of\nfourteen might reasonably be expected to “read aloud clearly and\nagreeably, to write a large distinct round hand, and to know the ordinary\nrules of arithmetic, especially compound addition–a by no means universal\naccomplishment; to speak and write French with ease and correctness, and\nhave some slight acquaintance with French literature; to translate ad\naperturam libri from an ordinary French or German book; to have a\nthoroughly good elementary knowledge of geography, under which are\ncomprehended some notions of astronomy–enough to excite his curiosity; a\nknowledge of the very broadest facts of geology and history–enough to\nmake him understand, in a clear but perfectly general way, how the larger\nfeatures of the world he lives in, physical and political, came to be like\nwhat they are; to have been trained from earliest infancy to use his\npowers of observation on plants, or animals, or rocks, or other natural\nobjects; and to have gathered a general acquaintance with what is most\nsupremely good in that portion of the more important English classics\nwhich is suitable to his time of life; to have some rudimentary\nacquaintance with drawing and music.”",
        "To effect this, no doubt, “industry must be our oracle, and reason our\nApollo,” as Sir T. Browne says; but surely it is no unreasonable estimate;\nyet how far do we fall short of it? General culture is often deprecated\nbecause it is said that smatterings are useless. But there is all the\ndifference in the world between having a smattering of, or being well\ngrounded in, a subject. It is the latter which we advocate–to try to\nknow, as Lord Brougham well said, “everything of something, and something\nof everything.”",
        "“It can hardly,” says Sir John Herschel, “be pressed forcibly enough on\nthe attention of the student of nature, that there is scarcely any natural\nphenomenon which can be fully and completely explained, in all its\ncircumstances, without a union of several, perhaps of all, the sciences.”",
        "The present system in most of our public schools and colleges sacrifices\neverything else to classics and arithmetic. They are most important\nsubjects, but ought not to exclude science and modern languages. Moreover,\nafter all, our sons leave college unable to speak either Latin or Greek,\nand too often absolutely without any interest in classical history or\nliterature. But the boy who has been educated without any training in\nscience has grave reason to complain of “knowledge to one entrance quite\nshut out.”",
        "By concentrating the attention, indeed, so much on one or two subjects, we\ndefeat our own object, and produce a feeling of distaste where we wish to\ncreate an interest.",
        "Our great mistake in education is, as it seems to me, the worship of\nbook-learning–the confusion of instruction and education. We strain the\nmemory instead of cultivating the mind. The children in our elementary\nschools are wearied by the mechanical act of writing, and the interminable\nintricacies of spelling; they are oppressed by columns of dates, by lists\nof kings and places, which convey no definite idea to their minds, and\nhave no near relation to their daily wants and occupations; while in our\npublic schools the same unfortunate results are produced by the weary\nmonotony of Latin and Greek grammar. We ought to follow exactly the\nopposite course with children–to give them a wholesome variety of mental\nfood, and endeavor to cultivate their tastes, rather than to fill their\nminds with dry facts. The important thing is not so much that every child\nshould be taught, as that every child should be given the wish to learn.\nWhat does it matter if the pupil know a little more or a little less? A\nboy who leaves school knowing much, but hating his lessons, will soon have\nforgotten almost all he ever learned; while another who had acquired a\nthirst for knowledge, even if he had learned little, would soon teach\nhimself more than the first ever knew. Children are by nature eager for\ninformation. They are always putting questions. This ought to be\nencouraged. In fact, we may to a great extent trust to their instincts,\nand in that case they will do much to educate themselves. Too often,\nhowever, the acquirement of knowledge is placed before them in a form so\nirksome and fatiguing that all desire for information is choked, or even\ncrushed out; so that our schools, in fact, become places for the\ndiscouragement of learning, and thus produce the very opposite effect from\nthat at which we aim. In short, children should be trained to observe and\nto think, for in that way there would be opened out to them a source of\nthe purest enjoyment for leisure hours, and the wisest judgment in the\nwork of life.",
        "Another point in which I venture to think that our system of education\nmight be amended, is that it tends at present to give the impression that\neverything is known.",
        "Dr. Busby is said to have kept his hat on in the presence of King Charles,\nthat the boys might see what a great man he was. I doubt, however, whether\nthe boys were deceived by the hat; and am very skeptical about Dr. Busby’s\ntheory of education.",
        "Master John of Basingstoke, who was Archdeacon of Leicester in 1252,\nlearned Greek during a visit to Athens, from Constantina, daughter of the\nArchbishop of Athens, and used to say afterwards that though he had\nstudied well and diligently at the University of Paris, yet he learned\nmore from an Athenian maiden of twenty. We cannot all study so pleasantly\nas this, but the main fault I find with Dr. Busby’s system is that it\nkeeps out of sight the great fact of human ignorance.",
        "Boys are given the impression that the masters know everything. If, on the\ncontrary, the great lesson impressed on them was that what we know is as\nnothing to what we do not know, that the “great ocean of truth lies all\nundiscovered before us,” surely this would prove a great stimulus, and\nmany would be nobly anxious to enlarge the boundaries of human knowledge,\nand extend the intellectual kingdom of man. Philosophy, says Aristotle,\nbegins in wonder, for Iris is the child of Thaumas.",
        "Education ought not to cease when we leave school; but if well begun\nthere, will continue through life.",
        "Moreover, whatever our occupation or profession in life may be, it is most\ndesirable to create for ourselves some other special interest. In the\nchoice of a subject every one should consult his own instincts and\ninterests, I will not attempt to suggest whether it is better to pursue\nart or science; whether we should study the motes in the sunbeam, or the\nheavenly bodies themselves. Whatever may be the subject of our choice, we\nshall find enough, and more than enough, to repay the devotion of a\nlifetime. Life no doubt is paved with enjoyments, but we must all expect\ntimes of anxiety, of suffering, and of sorrow; and when these come it is\nan inestimable comfort to have some deep interest which will, at any rate\nto some extent, enable us to escape from ourselves.",
        "“A cultivated mind,” says Mill–\"I do not mean that of a philosopher, but\nany mind to which the fountains of knowledge have been opened, and which\nhas been taught in any tolerable degree to exercise its faculties–will\nfind sources of inexhaustible interest in all that surrounds it; in the\nobjects of nature, the achievements of art, the imaginations of poetry,\nthe incidents of history, the ways of mankind, past and present, and their\nprospects in the future. It is possible, indeed, to become indifferent to\nall this, and that too without having exhausted a thousandth part of it;\nbut only when one has had from the beginning no moral or human interest in\nthese things, and has sought in them only the gratification of curiosity.”",
        "I have been subjected to some good-natured banter for having said that I\nlooked forward to a time when our artisans and mechanics would be great\nreaders. But it is surely not unreasonable to regard our social condition\nas susceptible of great improvement. The spread of schools, the cheapness\nof books, the establishment of free libraries will, it may be hoped,\nexercise a civilizing and ennobling influence. They will even, I believe,\ndo much to diminish poverty and suffering, so much of which is due to\nignorance and to the want of interest and brightness in uneducated life.\nSo far as our elementary schools are concerned, there is no doubt much\ndifficulty in apportioning the National Grant without unduly stimulating\nmere mechanical instruction. But this is not the place to discuss the\nsubject of religious or moral training, or the system of apportioning the\ngrant.",
        "If we succeed in giving the love of learning, the learning itself is sure\nto follow.",
        "We should therefore endeavor to educate our children so that every country\nwalk may be a pleasure; that the discoveries of science may be a living\ninterest; that our national history and poetry may be sources of\nlegitimate pride and rational enjoyment. In short, our schools, if they\nare to be worthy of the name–if they are to fulfil their high\nfunction–must be something more than mere places of dry study; they must\ntrain the children educated in them so that they may be able to appreciate\nand enjoy those intellectual gifts which might be, and ought to be, a\nsource of interest and of happiness, alike to the high and to the low, to\nthe rich and to the poor.",
        "A wise system of education will at least teach us how little man yet\nknows, how much he has still to learn; it will enable us to realize that\nthose who complain of the tiresome monotony of life have only themselves\nto blame; and that knowledge is pleasure as well as power. It will lead us\nall to try with Milton “to behold the bright countenance of truth in the\nquiet and still air of study,” and to feel with Bacon that “no pleasure is\ncomparable is the standing upon the vantage ground of truth.”",
        "We should then indeed realize in part, for as yet we cannot do so fully,\nthe “sacred trusts of health, strength, and time,” and how thankful we\nought to be for the inestimable gift of life.",
