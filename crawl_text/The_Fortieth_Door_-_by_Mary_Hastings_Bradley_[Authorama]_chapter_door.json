        "A RASH PROMISE",
        "He didn’t want to go. He loathed the very thought of it. Every\nflinching nerve in him protested.",
        "A masked ball–a masked ball at a Cairo hotel! Grimacing through\npeep-holes, self-conscious advances, flirtations ending in giggles!\nTourists as nuns, tourists as Turks, tourists as God-knows-what, all\npreening and peacocking!",
        "Unhappily he gazed upon the girl who was proposing this horror as a\nbright delight. She was a very engaging girl–that was the mischief\nof it. She stood smiling there in the bright, Egyptian sunshine, gay\nconfidence in her gray eyes. He hated to shatter that confidence.",
        "And he had done little enough for her during her stay in Cairo. One\ntea at the Gezireh Palace Hotel, one trip to the Sultan al Hassan\nMosque, one excursion through the bazaars–not exactly an orgy of\nentertainment for a girl from home!",
        "He had evaded climbing the Pyramids and fled from the ostrich farm.\nHe had withheld from inviting her to the camp on the edge of the\nLibyan desert where he was excavating, although her party had shown\nunmistakable signs of a willingness to be diverted from the beaten\npath of its travel.",
        "And he was not calling on her now. He had come to Cairo for supplies\nand she had encountered him by chance upon a corner of the crowded\nMograby, and there promptly she had invited him to to-night’s ball.",
        "“But it’s not my line, you know, Jinny,” he was protesting. “I’m so\nfearfully out of dancing–”",
        "“More reason to come, Jack. You need a change from digging up ruins\nall the time–it must be frightfully lonely out there on the desert.\nI can’t think how you stand it.”",
        "Jack Ryder smiled. There was no mortal use in explaining to Jinny\nJeffries that his life on the desert was the only life in the world,\nthat his ruins held more thrills than all the fevers of her tourist\ncrowds, and that he would rather gaze upon the mummied effigy of any\nlady of the dynasty of Amenhotep than upon the freshest and fairest\nof the damsels of the present day.",
        "It would only tax Jinny’s credulity and hurt her feelings. And he\nliked Jinny–though not as he liked Queen Hatasu or the little\nnameless creature he had dug out of a king’s ante-room.",
        "Jinny was an interfering modern. She was the incarnation of\nimpossible demands.",
        "But of course there was no real reason why he should not stop over\nand go to the dance.",
        "Ten minutes later, when she had extracted his promise and abandoned\nhim to the costumers, he was scourging his weakness.",
        "He had known better! Very well, then, let him take his medicine. Let\nhim go as–here he disgustedly eyed the garment that the Greek was\npresenting–as Little Lord Fauntleroy! He deserved it.",
        "Shudderingly he looked away from the pretty velvet suit; he scorned\nthe monk’s robes that were too redolent of former wearers; he\nrejected the hot livery of a Russian mujik; he flouted the banality\nof the Pierrot pantaloons.",
        "Thankfully he remembered McLean. Kilts, that was the thing. Tartans,\nthe real Scotch plaids. Some use, now, McLean’s precious\nsporrans.... He’d look him up at once.",
        "Out of the crowded Mograby he made his way on foot to the Esbekeyih\nquarters where the streets were wider and emptier of Cairene\ntraffickers and shrill itinerates and laden camels and jostling\ndonkeys.",
        "It was a glorious day, a day of Egypt’s blue and gold. The sky was a\nwash of water color; the streets a flood of molten amber. A little\nwind from the north rustled the acacias and blew in his bronzed face\ncool reminders of the widening Nile and dancing waves.",
        "He remembered a chap he knew, who had a sailing canoe–but no, he\nwas going to get a costume for a fool ball!",
        "Disgustedly he turned into the very modern and official-looking\nresidence that was the home of his friend, Andrew McLean, and the\noffices of that far-reaching institution, the Agricultural Bank.",
        "A white-robed, red-sashed and red-fezed houseboy led him across the\ntiled entrance into the long room where McLean was concluding a\nconference with two men.",
        "“Not the least trace,” McLean was saying. “We’ve questioned all our\nnative agents–”",
        "Afterwards Ryder remembered that indefinite little pause. If the two\nmen had not lingered–if McLean had not remembered that he was an\nexcavator–if chance had not brushed the scales with lightning\nwings–!",
        "“Ever hear of a chap called Delcassé, Paul Delcassé, a French\nexcavator?” McLean suddenly asked of him. “Disappeared in the desert\nabout fifteen years ago.”",
        "“He was reported, monsieur, to have died of the fever,” one of the\nmen explained.",
        "McLean introduced him as a special agent from France. His companion\nwas one of the secretaries of the French legation. They were trying\nevery quarter for traces of this Delcassé.",
        "Ryder’s memory darted back to old library shelves. He saw a thin,\nbrown volume, almost uncut....",
        "“He wrote a book on the Tomb of Thi,” he said suddenly. “Paul\nDelcassé–I remember it very well.”",
        "Now that he thought of it, the memory was clear. It was one of those\nbooks that had whetted his passion for the past, when his student\nmind was first kindling to buried cities and forgotten tombs and all\nthe strange store and loot of time.",
        "Paul Delcassé. He didn’t remember a word of the book, but he\nremembered that he had read it with absorption. And now the special\nagent, delighted at the recognition, was talking eagerly of the\nwriter.",
        "“He was a brilliant young man, monsieur, but he was of no importance\nto his generation–and he becomes so now through the whim of a\ncapricious woman to disinherit her other heirs. After all this time\nshe has decided to make active inquiries.”",
        "“But you said that Delcassé had died–”",
        "“He left a wife and child. Her letters of her husband’s death\nreached his relatives in France, then nothing more. They feared that\nthe same fever–but nothing, positively, was known.... A sad story,\nmonsieur.... This Delcassé was young and adventurous and an ardent\nexplorer. An ardent lover, too, for he brought a beautiful French\nwife to share the hazards of his expedition–”",
        "“An ardent idiot,” thrust in McLean unfeelingly. “Knocking a woman\nabout the desert.... Not much chance of a clue after all these\nyears,” he concluded with a very British air of dismissal.",
        "But the French agent was not to be sundered from the American who\nremembered the book of Delcassé.",
        "From his pocket he brought a leather case and from the case a large\nand ornate gold locket.",
        "“His picture, monsieur.” He pressed the spring and offered Ryder the\nminiature. “It was done in France before he returned on that last\ntrip, and was left with the aunt. It is said to be a good likeness.”",
        "Ryder looked down upon the young face presented to his gaze with a\nfeeling of sympathy for this unlucky searcher of the past who had\nleft his own secret in the sands he had come to conquer–sympathy\nmingled with blank wonder at the insanity which had brought a woman\nwith it....",
        "McLean couldn’t understand a man’s doing it.",
        "Jack Ryder couldn’t understand a man’s wanting to do it. Love to\nRyder was incomprehensible idiocy. Woman, as far as he was\nconcerned, had never been created. She was still a spectacle, an\nhistorical record, an uncomprehended motive.",
        "“Nice looking chap,” he commented briefly, fingering the curious old\ncase as he handed it back.",
        "“I’ll keep up the inquiries,” McLean assured them, “but, as I said,\nnothing will come of it.... It’s been fifteen years. One more grain\nlost in the desert of sand.... By luck, you know, you might just\nstumble on something, some native who knew the story, but if fever\ncarried them off and the Arabs rifled their camp, as I fancy,\nthey’ll jolly well keep their mouths shut. No white man will\nknow.... I don’t advise your people to spend much money on the\nsearch.”",
        "“Odd, the inquiries we get,” he commented to Ryder when the\nFrenchmen had completed their courteous farewells. “You’d think the\nBank was a Bureau of Information! Yesterday there was a stir about\ntwo crazy lads who are supposed to have joined the Mecca pilgrims in\ndisguise.... Of course our clerks are Copts and do pick up a bit\nand the Copts will talk.... I say, Jack, what are you doing?” he\nbroke off to demand in astonishment, for Jack Ryder had seated\nhimself upon a divan and was absorbedly rolling up his trouser leg.",
        "“The dear Egyptian flea?” he added.",
        "“Not at all. I am looking at my knees,” said Ryder glumly. “I just\nremembered that I have to show them to-night.... A ball–in\nmasquerade. At a hotel. Tourist crowd.... How do you think they’ll\nlook with one of your Scotch plaidies atop?” he inquired feelingly.",
        "“Fascinating, Jack, fascinating,” said the promptly sardonic McLean.\n\"You–at a masquerade!... So that’s what brought you to town.”",
        "He cocked a taunting eye at him. “Well, well, she must be a most\nengaging young person–you’ll be taking her out on the desert with\nyou now, like our friend Delcassé–a pleasant, retired spot for a\nbody to have his honeymoon ... no distractions of society ...\nundiluted companionship, you might say.... Now what made you think\nshe’d like your knees?” he murmured contemplatively. “Aren’t you\njust a bit–previous? Apt to startle and frighten the lady?”",
        "“Oh, go on, go on,” Ryder exhorted bitterly. “I like it. It’s better\nthan I can do myself. Go on.... But while you are talking trot out\nyour tartans. Something clannish now–one of those ancestral rigs\nthat you are always cherishing ... Rich and red, to set off my dark,\nhandsome type.”",
        "“Set off you’ll be, Jack dear,” promised McLean, dragging out a huge\nchest. “Set off you’ll be.”",
        "Set off he was.",
        "And a fool he felt himself that night, as he confronted his\nbrilliant image in the glass. A Scot of the Scots, kilted in vivid\nplaid, a rakish cap on his black hair, a tartan draped across his\nshoulder, short, heavy stockings clasping his legs and low shoes gay\nwith big buckles.",
        "“Oh, young Lochinvar has come out of the west,” warbled McLean\nmerrily, as he straightened the shoulder pin of silver and Scotch\ntopaz.",
        "“Out of Hades,” said Ryder, rather pointlessly, for he felt it was\nHades he was going into.",
        "Chiefly he was concerned with his knees and the striking contrast\nbetween their sheltered whiteness and the desert brown of his\nface.... Milky pale they gleamed at him from the glass.... Bony\nhard, they flaunted their angles at every move.... He was grateful\nthat he was not a centipede.",
        "     “Oh, ’twas all for my rightful king,\n       That I gaed o’er the border;\n       Twas all for–",
        "“You didn’t tell me her name, now, Jack.”",
        "“Where’s my mask?” Ryder was muttering. “I say, aren’t there any\npockets in these confounded petticoats?”",
        "“In the sporran, man.... There!” McLean at last withheld his hand\nfrom its handiwork. “Jock, you’re a grand sight,” he pronounced with\na special Scottish burr. “If ye dinna win her now–’Bonny Charley’s\nnow awa,’” he sung as Ryder, with a last darkling look at his vivid\nimage, strode towards the door.",
        "“He’s awa’ all right–and he’ll be back again as soon as he can make\nit.”",
        "With this cheerless anticipation of the evening’s promise, the\ndeparting one stalked, like an exiled Stuart, to his waiting\ncarriage.",
        "For a moment more McLean kept the ironic smile alive upon his lips,\nas he listened to the rattle of the wheels and the harsh gutturals\nof the driver, then the smile died as he turned back into the room.",
        "“Eh, but wouldn’t you like it, though, Andy,” he said to himself,\n\"if some girl now liked you enough to get you to go to one of those\ndamned things.... The lucky dog!”",
        "MASKS AND MASKERS",
        "Moors and Juliets and Circassian slaves and Knights at Arms were\nfast emerging from lift or cloak room, and confronting each other\nthrough their masks in sheepish defiance and curiosity. Adventurous\nspirits were circulating. Voices, lowered and guarded, began to\nengage in nervous, tittering banter.... Laughter, belatedly\nsmothered, flared to betrayals....",
        "The orchestra was playing a Viennese waltz and couple after couple\nslipped out upon the floor.",
        "Lounging against the wall, Ryder glowered mockingly through his mask\nholes at the motley. It was so exactly as he had foreseen. He was\nbored–and he was going to be more bored. He was jostled–and he was\ngoing to be more jostled. He was hot–and he was going to be hotter.",
        "Where in the world was Jinny Jeffries? He deserved, he felt,\nexhilaratingly kind treatment to compensate him for this insanity.\nHe gazed about, and encountering a plump shepherdess ogling him he\nstepped hastily behind a palm.",
        "He fairly stepped upon a very small person in black. A phantom-like\nsmall person, with the black silk hubarah of the Mohammedan\nhigh-caste woman drawn down to her very brows, and over the entire\nface the black street veil. Not a feature visible. Not an eyebrow.\nNot an eyelash, not a hint of the small person herself, except a\nvery small white, ringed hand, lifted as if in defense of his\nclumsiness.",
        "“Sorry,” said Ryder quickly, and driven by the instinct of\nreparation. “Won’t you dance?”",
        "A mute shake of the head.",
        "Well, his duty was done. But something, the very lack of all\ninvitation in the black phantom, made him linger. He repeated his\nrequest in French.",
        "From behind the veil came a liquidly soft voice with a note of\nmirth. “I understand the English, monsieur,” it informed him.",
        "“Enough, then, to say yes in it?”",
        "The black phantom shook its head. “My education, alas! has only\nproceeded to the N.” Her speech was quaint, unhesitating, but oddly\ninflected. “I regret–but I am not acquainted with the yes.”",
        "A gay character for a masked ball! Indifference and pique swung\nRyder towards a geisha girl, but a trace of irritation lingered and\nhe found her, “You likee plink gleisha?” singularly witless.",
        "He’d tell McLean just how darned captivating his outfit was, he\npromised himself.",
        "And then he caught sight of a familiar pair of gray eyes smiling\nover the white veil of an odalisque. Jinny Jeffries was wearing one\nof the many costumes there that passed for Oriental, a glittering\nassemblage of Turkish trousers and Circassian veils, silver shawls\nand necklaces and wide bracelets banding bare arms.",
        "As an effect it was distinctly successful.",
        "“Ten thousand dinars could not pay for the chicken she has eaten,\"\nuttered Ryder appreciatively in the language of the old slave\nmarket, and stepped promptly ahead of a stout Pantalon.",
        "“Jack! You did come!” There was a note in the girl’s voice as if she\nhad disbelieved in her good fortune. “Oh, and beautiful as Roderick\nDhu! Didn’t I tell you that you could find something in that shop?\"\nshe declared in triumph.",
        "“Do you imagine that this came out of a costumer’s?” Ryder swung her\nswiftly out in the fox trot before the crowd invaded the floor. “If\nAndy McLean could hear you! Why this, this is the real thing, the\nScots-wha-hae-wi’-Wallace-bled stuff.”",
        "“Who is Andy McLean?”",
        "“Andrew is Scotch, Single, and Skeptical. He is a great pal of mine\nand also an official of the Agricultural Bank which is by way of\nbeing a Government institution. These are the togs of his Hieland\nGrandsire–”",
        "“Why didn’t you bring him?”",
        "“Too dead, unfortunately–grandsires often are–”",
        "“I mean Andrew McLean.”",
        "“It would take you, my dear Jinny, to do that. You brought me–and\nI can believe in anything after the surprise of finding myself\nhere.”",
        "Jinny Jeffries laughed. “If I could only believe what you say!”",
        "“Oh, you can believe anything I say,” Jack obligingly assured her.\n\"I’m very careful what I say–”",
        "“I wish I were.”",
        "“You’d have to be careful how you look, Jinny–and you can’t help\nthat. The Lord who gave you red hair must provide the way to elude\nits consequences.... I suppose the Orient isn’t exactly a manless\nSahara for you?”",
        "She countered, her bright eyes intent, “Is it a girl-less Sahara for\nyou, Jack?”",
        "“The only woman I have laid a hand on, in kindness or unkindness,\ndied before Ptolemy rebuilt Denderah.”",
        "“That’s not right–”",
        "“No? And I thought it such a virtuous record!”",
        "“I mean,” Jinny laughed, “that you really ought to be seeing more of\nlife–like to-night–”",
        "“To-night? Do you imagine this is a place for seeing life?”",
        "“Why not?” she retorted to the irony in his voice. “It’s real\npeople–not just dead and gone things in cases with their lives all\nlived. I don’t care if you are going to be a very famous person,\nJack, you ought to see more of the world. You have just been buried\nout here for two years, ever since you left college–”",
        "Beneath his mask the young man was smiling. A quaint feminine\nnotion, that life was to be encountered at a masquerade! This motley\nof hot, over-dressed, wrought up idiots a human contact!",
        "Life? Living?... Thank you, he preferred the sane young English\nofficials ... the comradeship of his chief ... the glamor of his\ndesert tombs.",
        "Of course there was a loneliness in the desert. That was part of the\nbig feeling of it, the still, stealing sense of immensity reaching\nout its shadowy hands for you.... Loneliness and restlessness....\nThese tropic nights, when the stars burned low and bright, and the\nhot sands seemed breathing.... Loneliness and restlessness–but they\ngave a man dreams.... And were those dreams to be realized here?",
        "The music stopped and the ever-watchful Pantalon bore down upon\nthem. Abandoning Jinny to her fate, Ryder sought refuge and a\ncigarette.",
        "The hall was crowded now; the ball was a flash of color, a whirl of\nsatins and spangles and tulle and gauze, gold and green and rose and\nsapphire, gyrating madly in vivid projection against the black and\nwhite stripes of the Moorish walls. The color and the music had sent\ntheir quickening reactions among the throng. Masks were lending\naudacity to mischief and high spirits.",
        "Three little Pierrettes scampered through the crowd, pelting right\nand left with confetti and balloons, and two stalwart monks and a\nthin Hamlet pursued them, keeping up the bombardment amid a great\ncombustion of balloons. A spangled Harlequin snatched his hands\nfull of confetti and darted behind a palm.",
        "It was the palm of the black phantom, the palm of Ryder’s rebuff.\nPerhaps the Harlequin had met repulse here, too, and cherished\nresentment, not a very malicious resentment but a mocking feint of\nit, for when Ryder turned sharply after him–oddly, he himself was\nstrolling toward that nook–he found Harlequin circling with mock\nentreaties about the stubbornly refusing black domino.",
        "“Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the\ndance?” chanted Harlequin, with a shower of confetti flung at the\ngirl’s averted face.",
        "There was such a shrinking of genuine fright in her withdrawal that\nRyder had a fine thrill of rescue.",
        "“My dance,” he declared, laying an intervening hand on her muffled\narm.",
        "His tartan-draped shoulder crowded the Harlequin from sight.",
        "She raised her head. The black street veil was flung back, but a\nblack yashmak was hiding all but her eyes. Great dark eyes they\nwere, deep as night and soft as shadows, arched with exquisitely\ncurved brows like the sweep of wild birds’ wings.... The most lovely\neyes that dreams could bring.",
        "A flash of relief shone through their childish fright. With sudden\nconfidence she turned to Ryder.",
        "“Thank you.... My education, monsieur, has proceeded to the Ts,” she\ntold him with a nervous little laugh over her chagrin, drowned in a\nburst of louder laughter from the discomfited Harlequin, who turned\non his heel and then bounded after fresh prey.",
        "“Shall we dance or promenade?” asked Ryder.",
        "Hesitatingly her gaze met his. Red and gold and green and blue\nflecks of confetti were glimmering like fishscales over her black\nwrap and were even entangled drolly in the absurd lengths of her\neye-lashes.",
        "“It is–if I have not forgotten how to dance,” she murmured. “If it\nis a waltz, perhaps–”",
        "It was a waltz. Ryder had an odd impression of her irresolution\nbefore, with strange eagerness, he swept her into the music. Within\nthe clumsy bulk of her draperies his arm felt the slightness of her\nyoung form. She was no more than a child.... No child, either, at a\nmasquerade, but a fairy, dancing in the moonlight.... She was a leaf\nblowing in the breeze.... She was the very breeze and the moonlight.",
        "And then, to his astonishment, the dance was over. Those moments had\nseemed no more than one.",
        "“We must have the next,” he said quickly. “What made you think you\nhad forgotten?”",
        "“It is nearly four years, monsieur, since I danced with a man.”",
        "“With a man? You have been dancing with girls, then?”",
        "She nodded.",
        "“At a school?”",
        "“At a–a sort of school.” The black domino laughed with ruefulness.\n\"At a very dull sort of school.”",
        "“To which, I hope, you are not to return?”",
        "She made no answer to that–unless it was a sigh that slipped out.",
        "“At any rate,” he said cheerily, “you are dancing to-night.”",
        "“To-night–yes, to-night I am dancing!” There was triumph in her\nyoung voice, triumph and faint defiance, and gayety again in her\nchanging eyes.",
        "Extraordinary, those eyes. Innocent, audacious, bewildering.... To\nlook down into them produced the oddest of excitement.",
        "He took off his mask. Masks were hindering things–he could see so\nmuch better without.",
        "She, too, could see better–could see him better. Shyly, yet\nintently, her gaze took note of him, of the clean, clear-cut young\nface, bronzed and rather thin, of the dark hair that looked darker\nagainst the scarlet cap, of the deep-set eyes, hazel-brown, that met\nhers so often and were so full of contradictory things ... life ...\nand humor ... and frank simplicity ... and subtle eagerness.",
        "He looked so young and confident and handsome....",
        "“You are–a Scotchman?” slipped out from her black yashmak.",
        "“Only in costume. I am an American.”",
        "She repeated it a little musingly. “I do not think I ever met an\nAmerican young man.” She added, “I have met old ones–yes, and\nmiddle-aged ones and the women–but a young one, no.”",
        "“A retired spot, that school of yours,” said Ryder appreciatively.\n\"You are French?”",
        "“That is for your imagination!” Teasingly, she laughed. “I am,\nmonsieur, only a black domino!”",
        "It was the loveliest laugh, Ryder was instantly aware, and the\nloveliest voice in the world. Yes, and the loveliest eyes.",
        "He forgot the crowd. He forgot the heat. He forgot–alas!–Jinny\nJeffries. He was aware of an intense exhilaration, a radiant sense\nof well-being, and–at the music’s beginning–of a small palm\npressed again to his, a light form within his arm ... of shy,\nenchanting eyes out from the shrouding black.",
        "“Do put that veil away,” he youthfully entreated. “It’s quite time.\nThe others are almost all unmasked.”",
        "Her glance about the room returned to him with mock plaintiveness.\nShe shook her head as they spun lightly about a corner.",
        "“Perhaps, monsieur, I have an unfortunate nose.”",
        "“My nerves are strong.”",
        "“But why afflict them?” Prankishly her eyes sparkled up at him over\nthe black veil that made her a mystery. “Enjoy the present,\nmonsieur!”",
        "“Are you enjoying it?”",
        "Her lashes dropped, like black butterflies. She was a changeling of\na girl, veering from gayety to shyness.... Her gaze was now on her\nwrist watch, a slender blaze of platinum and diamonds.",
        "“The present–yes,” she said in a muffled little voice.",
        "He bent his head to hear her through the veil.",
        "A tormenting curiosity was assailing him. It had become not enough\nto know that she was young and slender, with enchanting eyes and a\nteasing spirit of wit.... Vaguely he had thought her to be French,\none of the quaint jeunes filles so rarely taken traveling.",
        "But who was she? A child at her first ball? But what in the world\nwas she doing, back in the palms, away from her chaperon?",
        "He realized, even in the cloud of his fascination, that French\njeunes filles are not wonted to lurk about palms at a ball.",
        "Was she a little Cinderella, then, slipping among the guests? Some\npoor companion, stealing in for fun?... She was too young. And there\nwas that watch, that glitter of diamonds upon her wrist.",
        "“Have you just come to Cairo?”",
        "She shook her head. “For some time–I have been here.”",
        "“Up the Nile yet?”",
        "“The Nile–no, monsieur.”",
        "“But you are going?”",
        "“That–that I do not know. Sometime, perhaps.”",
        "She sounded guarded.... He hurried into revelations.",
        "“I am staying not far from Cairo, myself. I am an excavator–on an\nexpedition from an American museum.”",
        "“Ah, you dig?”",
        "“Well, not personally.... But the expedition digs.... We’ve had some\nbully finds.”",
        "“And you came from America–to dig in the sands?” The black domino\nlaughed softly. “For how long, monsieur?”",
        "“This is my second year.”",
        "Still laughing, she shook her shrouded little head at him. “But I\ncannot understand! What wonderful thing do you hope to find–what\nburied secret–?”",
        "“Nothing half as wonderful as to know who you are,” he said boldly.",
        "“That, too, is–is buried, monsieur!”",
        "“But not beyond discovery,” he told her very gayly and confidently,\nand danced the music out.",
        "As the last strains died, they paused for an instant as if the spell\nstill bound them, then his arms fell slowly away, and he heard the\ngirl draw a quick, startled breath. Her eyes sped to that tiny,\nblazing watch; when she lifted them he thought he surprised a gleam\nof panic.",
        "“How fast is an hour!” she said with an excited little laugh. “Time\nis a–a very sudden thing!”",
        "Sudden, indeed! How long since he had been a badly bored, impatient\nyoung man, mocking the follies of the masquerade? How long since he\nhad danced with Jinny, flouting her notion of this sort of thing as\nlife? How long since he had looked into a pair of dark disquieting\neyes ... listened to a gay little voice....",
        "Many important things in life happen suddenly. Juliet happened very\nsuddenly to Romeo. Romeo happened as suddenly to Juliet.",
        "But Jack Ryder was not remembering anything about Romeo and Juliet.\nHe was watching that glance steal to the wrist watch again.",
        "Then, as if with a determination of the spirit, they smiled up at\nhim.",
        "“Monsieur the American,” said the black domino, “you have been most\nkind to an–an incognita–of a masque. I hope that you dig out of\nyour sands all the secrets that you most desire.”",
        "“You sound as if you were saying good-bye,” said Jack Ryder with\nquick denial in his blood.",
        "The smile in her eyes flickered.",
        "“Perhaps I have kept you too long from the other guests.”",
        "He shook his head. “They don’t exist.”",
        "“Ah! I will give you the chance to say such nice things to them.”",
        "“But I never say nice things–unless I mean them!”",
        "“Never–monsieur?”",
        "“Never. I am very careful what I say,” he assured her, even as he\nhad assured another girl, in what different meaning, hours or\ncenturies before. “You can believe anything that I say.”",
        "“A young man of character! Perhaps that goes with the Scotch\ncostume. I have read the Scots are a noble people.”",
        "“They haven’t a thing on the Americans. You must know me better and\ndiscover–”",
        "But again her eyes had gone, almost guiltily, to that watch. And\nwhen she raised them again they were not smiling but very strangely\nresolved.",
        "“Monsieur, it is so hot–if you would get me a glass of sherbet?”",
        "“Certainly.” Convention brought out the assent; convention turned\nhim about and marched him dutifully toward the crowded table she\nindicated.",
        "But something deeper than convention, some warning born of that\ntoo-often consulted watch and that strange look in her eyes, that\nuneasy fear and swift resolve, turned him quickly about again.",
        "Other couples had strolled between them. He hurried through and\nstepped back among the palms.",
        "The place was empty. The black domino was gone.",
        "He wasted one minute in assuring himself that she was not hidden in\nsome corner, not mingled with the crowd. But the niche was deserted\nas a rifled nest. Then his eyes spied the door that the green\ndecorations had conspired to hide and he wrenched it open.",
        "He found himself on a little balcony overlooking the hotel garden.\nHe knew the place in daytime–palms and shrubs and a graveled walk\nand painted chairs where he had drunk tea with Jinny and watched a\nRussian tourist beautifully smoking cigarettes.",
        "Now the place was strange. Night and a crescent moon had wrought\ntheir magic, and the garden was a mystery of velvet dusks and ivory\npallors. The graveled path ran glimmering beneath the magnolias.\nOver the wall’s blankness the eucalyptus defined its crooked lines\nagainst the blue Egyptian sky.",
        "No living thing was there ... nothing ... or did that shadow stir?\nThere, just at the path’s end.",
        "Ryder’s lithe strength was swift. There was one breathless moment of\npursuit, then his hand fell with gripping fierceness upon the\nhuddled dark figure that had sped so frantically to the tiny door in\nthe garden’s end.... A moment more and she would have been through.",
        "His hand on her shoulder turned her towards him. Her eyes met his\nwith a dash of desperation.... He was unconscious how his own were\nblazing ... how queerly white his face had gone under its desert\nbrown.",
        "She was actually running away. She had meant never to see him again.\nHe had frustrated her, but the blow she had meant to deal him was\nstill felt.",
        "His voice, when it came, sounded shaken.",
        "“You were going to leave me?”",
        "Strangely her eyes changed. The defiance, the panic fear, faded. A\ncloud of slow despair welled up in them.",
        "“What else?” she said very softly.",
        "He did not lose his hold on her. He drew her back into the shadows\nwith involuntary caution, and he felt her slender body trembling in\nhis grasp. The tremors seemed to pass into his own.",
        "A sense of urgency was pressing upon him. He was not himself, not\nany self that he had known. He stood there, in the Egyptian night,\nin the motley of a Scotch chieftain, grasping this mysterious\ncreature of the masquerade, and he heard a voice that he did not\nknow ask of her again and again, “But why? Why? Why were you going?”",
        "It was not, he was telling himself, and her eyes were telling him,\nas if she wanted to go. He knew what he knew.... Those had been\nenchanted hours.... Yet she had deceived and fled from him.",
        "Her eyes looked darkly back at him through the dusk.",
        "“Because I must return to my own life.” Her voice was a whisper.\n\"And I did not want you to know–”",
        "“To know what? Who are you? Where were you going?” A confusion of\nconjecture, fantastic, horrible, impossible, was surging in him.\nDim, vague, terrible things....",
        "“Who are you, anyway?”",
        "She looked away from him, to the door which she had tried to gain.",
        "“No masker, monsieur.... For me, there is no unveiling.”",
        "Ryder’s hand stiffened. He felt his blood stop a moment, as if his\nheart stood still.",
        "And then it beat on again in a furious turmoil of contradiction of\nthis impossible thing that she was telling him.",
        "“That door, monsieur, is to the lane, and in the lane another door\nleads to another garden–the garden of a girl you can never know.”",
        "He was no novice to Egypt. Even while his credulity was still\nbattling with belief, his mind had realized this thing that had\nhappened ... the astounding, unbelievable thing.... He had heard\nsomething of those Turkish girls, daughters of rich officials, whose\nlives were such strange opposition of modernity and tradition.",
        "Indulgence and luxury. French governesses and French frocks ...\nfreedom, travel, often,–Paris, London, perhaps–and then, as the\ngirl eclipses the child–the veil. Still indulgence and luxury,\nstill books and governesses and frocks and motors and society–but a\nfeminine society.",
        "Not a man in it. Not a caller. Not a friend. Not a lover.... Not an\ninterview, even, with the man who is to be the husband–until the\nbride is safe in the husband’s home. Hidden women. Secret, secluded\nlives.... Extinguished by tradition–a tradition against which their\nearlier years only had won modern emancipation.",
        "And she–this slim creature in the black domino–one of those\ninvisibles?",
        "Stark amazement looked out of his eyes into hers.",
        "“You–a Turk?” he blurted.",
        "“I–a Turk!” Her head went suddenly high; she stiffened with\ndefensive pride. “I am ashamed–but for the thing I have done. That\nis a shameful thing. To steal out at night–to a hotel–to a\nball–And to dance with a man! To tell him who I am–Oh, yes, I am\nmuch ashamed. I am as bold as a Christian!” she tossed at him\nsuddenly, between mockery and malice.",
        "Still his wonder and his trouble found no words and the shadow on\nhis face was reflected swiftly in her own.",
        "“I beg you to believe, monsieur, that never before–never have I\ndone such a thing. My greatest fault was to be out in the garden\nafter sunset–when all Moslem women should be within. But my nurse\nwas indulgent.”",
        "Almost pleadingly she looked up at the young man. “Believe this of\nme, monsieur. I would not have you think of me lightly. But to-night\nsomething possessed me. I had heard of the masque, and I remembered\nthe balls of the Embassy where I danced when I was so young and so I\nslipped away–there was a garden key that I had stolen, long ago,\nand kept for another thing.... I did not mean to dance. Only to look\non at the world again.”",
        "“Oh, my good Lord,” said Jack Ryder.",
        "And then suddenly he asked, “Are you–do you–whom do you live\nwith?”",
        "And when she answered in surprise, “But with whom but my father–he\nis Tewfick Pasha,” he drew a long breath.",
        "“I thought you’d tell me next you were married,” he said limply.",
        "The next moment they were laughing the sudden, incredibly absorbed\nlaughter of youth.",
        "“No husband. I am one of the young revoltées–the moderns–and I am\nthe only daughter of a most indulgent father.”",
        "“Well, that’s something to the good,” was Ryder’s comment upon that.\nHe added, “But if that most indulgent father caught you–”",
        "He looked down at her. The secret trouble of her answering look told\nhim more than its assumption of courage.",
        "This was no boarding school girl lingering beyond hours.... This was\na high-born Moslem, risking more than he could well know.",
        "The escapade was suddenly serious, tremendously menacing.",
        "She answered faintly, “I have no idea–the thing is so impossible!\nBut of course,” she rallied her spirit to protest, “I do not think\nthey would sew me in a sack with a stone and drop me in the river,\nlike the odalisques of yesterday!”",
        "She added, her voice uncertain in spite of her, “I meant only to\nstay a moment.”",
        "“Which is the way?” said Jack briefly.",
        "With caution he opened the gate into the black canyon of the lane.\nSilence and darkness. Not a loiterer, only one of the furtive\nstarved dogs, slinking back from some rubbish....",
        "The girl moved forward and keeping closely at her side he followed;\nthey crossed to the other wall, and turned towards the right,\nstopping before the deeper shadow of a small, pointed door set into\nthe heavy brick of the high wall. From her draperies the girl drew\nout a huge key.",
        "She fitted it into the ancient lock and turned it; carefully she\npressed open the gate and stared anxiously into the gloom of the\nshadowy garden that it disclosed.",
        "Relief colored her voice as she turned to him.",
        "“All is quiet.... I am safe, now.... And so–good-bye, monsieur.”",
        "“And this is where you live?” Ryder whispered.",
        "“There–in that wing,” she murmured, slipping within the gate, and\nhe stole after her, and looked across the garden, through a fringe\nof date palms, to the outlines of the buildings.",
        "Dim and dark showed the high walls, black as a prison, only here and\nthere the pale orange oblong of a lighted window.",
        "“Did you climb out the window?” he murmured.",
        "From beneath the veil came a little sound of soft derision.",
        "“But there are always bars, even in the garden windows of the\nharemlik!... No, I stole down by an old stair.... That wing, there,\non the right.”",
        "Barred on the garden, and on the street the impregnable wooden\nscreens of the mashrubiyeh, those were the rooms where this girl\nbeside him was to spend her life–until that most indulgent father\nwearied of her modernity and transferred her to other rooms, as\nbarred and screened, in the palace of some husband!... That thought\nwas brushing Ryder ... with other thoughts of her present risk ...\nof her lovely eyes, visible again, above the veil, thoughts of the\nstrangeness and unreality of it all ... there in the shrubbery of a\npasha’s garden, the pasha’s daughter whispering at his side.",
        "“What about your mother–?” he asked her. “Is she–?”",
        "“She is dead,” the girl told him, with a drop in her voice.",
        "And after a long moment of silence, “When I was so little–but I\nremember her, oh, indeed I do ... She was French, monsieur.”",
        "“Oh! And so you–”",
        "“I am French-Turk,” she whispered back. “That is very often so–in\nthe harems of Cairo.... She was so lovely,” said the girl wistfully.\n\"My father must have loved her very much ... he never brought\nanother wife here. Always I lived alone with my old nurse and the\ngovernesses–”",
        "“You had–lessons?”",
        "“Oh, nothing but lessons–all of that world which was shut away so\nsoon.... French and English and music and the philosophy–Oh, we\nTurks are what you call blue stockings, monsieur, shut away with our\nbooks and our dreams ... and our memories ... We are so young and\nalready the real world is a memory.... Sometimes,” she said, with a\ntremor of suppressed passion in her still little tones, “I could\nwish that I had died when I was very young and so happy when my\nfather took me traveling in Europe.... I played games on the decks\nof the ships ... I had my tea with the English children.... I went\ndown into the hold to play with their dogs...”",
        "She broke off, between a laugh and a sigh, “Dogs are forbidden to\nMoslems–but of course you know, if you have been here two years....\nAnd emancipated as we may be, there is no changing the customs. We\nmust live as our grandmothers lived ... though we are not as our\ngrandmothers are...”",
        "“With a French mother, you must be very far from what some of your\ngrandmothers were!”",
        "“My poor French mother!” Whimsically the girl sighed. “Must I blame\nit on her–the spirit that took me to the ball?... To-morrow\nthis will be a dream to me.... I shall not believe in my\nshamelessness.... And you, too, must forget–”",
        "“Forget?” said Ryder under his breath.",
        "“Forget–and go. Positively you must go now, monsieur. It is very\ndangerous here–”",
        "“It is.” There was a light dancing in his hazel eyes. “It is more\ndangerous every moment–”",
        "“But I mean–” Her confusion betrayed itself.",
        "“But I mean–that you are magic–black magic,” he murmured bending\nover the black domino.",
        "The crescent moon had found its way through a filigree of boughs.\nFaintly its exploring ray lighted the contour of that shrouded head,\ntouched the lovely curves of her arched brows and the tender pallor\nof the skin about those great wells of dark eyes.... From his own\neyes a flame seemed to pass into hers.... Breathlessly they gazed at\neach other ... like dim shadows in a garden of still enchantment.",
        "And then, as from a palpable clasp, she tried to slip away. “Truly,\nI must go! It is so late–”",
        "Ryder’s heart was pounding within him. He did not recognize this\nstate of affairs; it was utterly unrelated to anything that had gone\nbefore in his merry, humorous, rather clear-sighted and wary young\nlife.... He felt dazed and wondering at himself ... and\nirresponsible ... and appalled ... but deeper than all else, he felt\neager and exultant and strangely, furtively determined about\nsomething that he was not owning to himself ... something that\nleaped off his lips in the low murmur to her, “But to-morrow\nnight–I shall see you again–”",
        "She caught her breath. “Oh, never again! To-night has no\nto-morrow–”",
        "“Outside this gate,” he persisted. “I shall wait–and other nights\nafter that. For I must know–if you are safe–”",
        "“See, I am very safe now. For if I were missed there would be\nrunning and confusion–”",
        "He only drew a little closer to her. “To-morrow night–or another–I\nshall come to this door–”",
        "“It must not open to you.... It is a forbidden door–forbidden as\nthat fortieth door in the old story.... There are thirty and nine\ndoors in your life, monsieur, that you may open, but this is the\nforbidden–”",
        "“I shall be waiting,” he insisted. “To-morrow night–or another–”",
        "She moved her head in denial.",
        "“Neither to-morrow nor another night–”",
        "Again their eyes met. He bent over her. He knew a gleam of sharpest\nwonder at himself as his arms went swiftly round that shrouding\ndrapery, and then all duality of consciousness was blotted out in\nthe rush of his young madness. For within that drapery was the soft,\nhuman sweetness of her; his arms tightened, his face bent close, and\nthrough the sheer gauze of her veil his lips pressed her lips....",
        "Some one was coming down the walk: Footsteps crunched the gravel.",
        "Like a wraith the girl was out of his arms ... in anger or alarm\nhis whirling senses could not know, although it was their passionate\nconcern. But his last gleam of prudence got him through the gate he\nheard her locking after.",
        "And then, for her sake, he fled.",
        "IN THE PASHA’S PALACE",
        "Nearer sounded the footsteps on the graveled walk and in frightened\nhaste the girl drew out the key from the gate and slipped away into\nthe shrubbery, grateful for the blotting shadows.",
        "At the foot of a rose bush she crouched to thrust the key into a\nhole in the loose earth, covering the top and drawing the low\nbranches over it.",
        "“Aimée,” came a guarded call. “Aimée!”",
        "Still stooping, she tried to steal through the bushes, but the\nthorns held her and she stood up, pulling at her robes.",
        "“Yes? Miriam?” she said faintly, and desperately freeing herself,\nshe hurried forward towards the dark, bulky figure of her old nurse,\nemerging now into the moonlight.",
        "“_Alhamdolillah–Glory to God!” ejaculated the old woman, but\ncautiously under her breath. “Come quickly–he is here–thy father!\nAnd thou in the garden, at this hour.... But come,” and urgently she\ngripped the girl’s wrist as if afraid that she would vanish again\ninto the shadows of the shrubbery.",
        "Aimée felt her knees quake under her. “My father!” she murmured,\nand her voice died in her throat.",
        "Had he discovered? Had some one seen her slip out? Or recognized her\nat the ball?",
        "The panic-stricken conjectures surged through her in dismaying\nconfusion. She tried to beat down her fear, to think quickly, to\nrally her force, but her swimming senses were still invaded with the\nsurprise of those last moments at the gate, her heart still beating\nwith the touch of Ryder’s arms about her ... of that long, deep look\n... that kiss, beyond all else, that kiss....",
        "Little rivers of fire were running through her veins. Shame and\nproud anger set up their swift reactions. Oh, what wings of wild,\nincredible folly had brought her to this! To be kissed like–like a\ndancing girl–by a man, an unknown, an American!",
        "How could he, how could he! After all his kindness–to hold her so\nlightly.... And yet there had been no lightness in his eyes, those\neager, shining young eyes, so gravely concerned....",
        "But she could not stop to think of this thing. Her father was\nwaiting.",
        "“He came in like a fury,” the old nurse was panting, as they\nscurried up the walk together, “and asked for you ... and your room\nempty, your bed not touched!... Oh, Allah’s ruth upon me, I went\ntrotting through the house, mad with fear.... Up to the roofs then\ndown to the garden ... sending him word that you were dressing that\nhe should not know the only child of his house was a shameless one,\ndevoid of sense.”",
        "“But there is no harm in a garden,” breathed the girl, her face hot\nwith shame. “To-night was so hot–”",
        "“Is there no coolth upon the roof?”",
        "“But the roses–”",
        "“Can roses not be brought you? Have you no maids to attend you?”",
        "“I am tired of being attended! Can I never be alone–”",
        "“Alone in the garden!... A pretty talk! Eh, I will tell thy father,\nI will have a stop put to this–hush, would you have him hear?\"\nshe admonished, in a sudden whisper, as they opened the little door\nat the foot of the dark well of spiral steps.",
        "Like conspirators they fled up the staircase, and then with fumbling\nhaste the old nurse dragged off the girl’s mantle and veil,\nmuttering at the pins that secured it. She shook out the\npale-flowered chiffon of her rumpled frock and gathered back a\nstrand of her dark, disordered hair.",
        "“Say that you were on the roofs,” she besought her.",
        "For a moment the girl put the warm rose of her cheek against the old\nwoman’s dark, wrinkled one.",
        "“But you are good, Dadi,” she said softly, using the Turkish word\nfor familiar old servants.",
        "With a sound of mingled vexation and affection Miriam pushed her\nahead of her into the drawing-room.",
        "It was a long, dark room, on whose soft, buff carpet the little gilt\nchairs and sofas were set about with the empty expectancy of a stage\nscene in a French salon. French were the shirred, silk shades upon\nthe electric lamps, French the music upon the chic rosewood piano.",
        "And then, as if some careless property man had overlooked them in\nchanging the act, two window balconies of closely carved old wood,\nof solidly screening mashrubiyeh wood, jutted out from one\ncream-tinted wall, and above a gilded sofa, upholstered in the\ndelicate fabric of the Rue de la Paix, hung a green satin banner\nembroidered in silver with a phrase from the Koran.",
        "Tewfick Pasha was at one side of the room, filling his match case.\nHe was in evening dress, a ribbon of some order across a rather\nswelling shirt bosom, a red fez upon his dark head.",
        "At his daughter’s entrance he turned quickly, with so sharp a gleam\nfrom his full, somewhat protuberant black eyes that her guilty heart\nfairly turned over in her.",
        "It made matters no more comforting to have Miriam packed from the\nroom.",
        "She would deny it all, she thought desperately ... No, she would\nadmit it, and implore his indulgence.... She would admit nothing but\nthe garden.... She would admit the ball.... She would never admit\nthe young man....",
        "With conscious eyes and flushing cheeks, woefully aware of\ndew-drenched satin slippers and an upsettingly hammering heart,\nAimée presented the young image of irresolute confusion.",
        "To her surprise there was no outburst. Her father was suddenly gay\nand smiling, with a flow of pleasant phrases that invited her\naffection. In his good humor–and Tewfick Pasha liked always to be\nkept in good humor–he had touches of that boyish charm that had\nmade him the enfant gâté of Paris and Vienna as well as Cairo and\nConstantinople. An enfant no more, in the robustly rotund forties,\nhis cheerful self-indulgence demanded still of his environment that\nsmiling acquiescence that kept life soft and comfortable.",
        "And now it suddenly struck Aimée, through her tense alarm, that his\nsmile was not a spontaneous smile, but was silently, uneasily asking\nhis daughter not to make something too unpleasant for him ... that\nsomething that had brought him here, at an unprecedented midnight\n... that had kept him waiting until she, supposedly, should rise and\ndress....",
        "If it were not then a knowledge of her escapade–?",
        "The relief from that fear made everything else bearable. She was\neven able to entertain, with a certain welcome, the alternative\nalarm that he had decided to marry again–that nightmare from whose\nrealization the unknown gods (or more truly, the unknown goddesses\nof the Cairene demi-monde!) had assisted to save her.",
        "There was a furtive excitement about him that fanned the\nsupposition.",
        "Then, quite suddenly, the illuminating lightning cut the clouds.",
        "“My dear child, I have news, really important news for you. If I\nhave not been discussing your future,” said Tewfick Pasha, staring\nwith stern nonchalance ahead and determinedly unaware of her instant\nstiffening of attention, “I have by no means been neglectful of\nit.... To-day–indeed to-night–there has been a consummation of my\nplans.... It is not to every daughter that a father may hurry with\nsuch an announcement.”",
        "Her first feeling was a merciful relief. He knew nothing then of the\nball! She could breathe again.... It was her marriage that had\nbrought him.",
        "No new danger, that, but the eternal menace that she had always to\ndread.... But how many times had he promised that she should have no\nunknown husband, imposed by tradition! How many times had she\nindulged dreams of Europe, of bright, free romance!",
        "And now he was off on some tangent from which it would need all her\ncoaxing wit to divert him. With wide eyes painfully intent, her\nlittle, jeweled fingers very still in their locked grip in her lap,\nthe color draining from her cheeks, she sat waiting for the\nrevelation.",
        "What was it all? Had he really decided upon something? Upon some\none?",
        "Tewfick Pasha appeared in no hurry to inform her. He wandered\nrather confusedly into a rambling speech about her age and her\nposition and the responsibilities of life and his inabilities to\nprevent their reaching her, and about his very tender affection for\nher and his understanding of all those girlish reticences and\nreluctances which made innocent youth so exquisite, while silently\nhis daughter hung her head and wondered what he would be saying if\nhe knew that she had broken every canon of seclusion and convention,\nhad talked and danced with a man....",
        "His astonishment would be so horrific that she flinched even from\nthe thought.",
        "And if he knew, moreover, that this man had caught her and kissed\nher–!",
        "She told herself that she was disgraced for life. She had a dreamy\ndesire to close her eyes and lean back and dream on about that\ndisgrace....",
        "But she must listen to her father. He was talking now about the\npowers of wealth, not merely the nominal riches of his somewhat\nprecarious political affiliations, but solid, sustaining, invested\nand invulnerable wealth.",
        "Unexpectedly Aimée laughed. “He must be very plain,” she declared,\nher face brightening with mockery, “if you take so long to tell me\nhis name!”",
        "Not, she added to herself under her breath, that any name would\nweigh a feather’s difference!",
        "“On the contrary,” and the pasha’s eyes met hers frankly for the\nfirst time and he seemed delighted to indulge a laugh, “he has the\nreputation of good looks. He is much à la mode.”",
        "“Beautiful and golden–did you meet him just to-night, my father?\"\nAimée went on, in that light audacity which he had loved to indulge.",
        "Now he smiled, but his glance went uneasily away from her.",
        "“Not at all. This is a serious affair, you understand–the devil of\na serious affair!” and for the first time she felt she heard the\naccents of his candor.",
        "But again he was back to voluble protestation. This man was really\nan old friend. He boggled over the word, then got it out resonantly.\nA man he knew well. Not a young man, perhaps–certainly he was not\ngoing to hand his only daughter to any boy, a mere novice in\nlife!–but a man who could give her the position she deserved. Not\nonly a rich man, but an influential one.",
        "His name, he brought out at last, was Hamdi Bey. He was a general in\nthe armies of the sultan.",
        "It was a long moment before she could piece any shreds of\nrecollection together.",
        "Hamdi Bey ... A general.... Why, that was a man her father had\ndisliked ... more than once he had dropped resentful phrases of his\nairs, his arrogance ... had recounted certain clashes with malicious\njoy.",
        "And now he was planning–no, seriously announcing–",
        "A general ... He must be terribly old....",
        "Not that it made any difference. Old or young, black or white,\ngeneral or ghikar, would mean nothing in her life. She would have\nnone of him ... none of him.... Never would she endure the\nhumiliation of being handed over like a toy, an odalisque, a\nslave....",
        "What had happened? She could only suppose that her father had been\novercome by that wealth of the general’s on which he had made her\nsuch a speech. Or perhaps his dislike of Hamdi had been founded on\nnothing but resentment of Hamdi’s airs of superiority, and now that\nthe bey was condescending to ask for her hand her father’s flattered\nappeasement was rushing into genial acceptance.",
        "Anything might be possible to Tewfick Pasha’s eternally youthful\nenthusiasms.",
        "She told her frightened heart that she was not afraid.... Her father\nwould never really fail her.... And she would never surrender to\nthis degradation; for all her fright and all her flinching from\ndefiance she divined in herself some hidden stuff of resistance,\ntenacious to endure ... some strain of daring which had made her\nbrave that wild escapade to-night.",
        "Was it still the same night? Were the violins still playing, the\npeople still dancing in their fairy land of freedom?... Was that\nyoung man in the Highland dress, that unknown American, was he back\nthere dancing with some other girl?",
        "What was it he had said? To-morrow night, and another night, he\nwould be there in the lane.... If she would come! As if she would\ndemean herself, after his rude affront, to steal again to the gate,\nlike a gardener’s daughter–!",
        "Her thoughts were so full of him. And now she had this new horror to\nface, this marriage to Hamdi Bey. Did her father dream that she\nwould not resist? It was against such a danger that she had long ago\nstolen a garden key, a key to the outer world in which she had\nneither a friend nor a piaster to save her....",
        "“My dear father,” she said entreatingly, “please do not tell me that\nyou really mean–that you really think you would like to–that you\nwould consider–this man–”",
        "He turned on her a suddenly direct, confessing look.",
        "“Aimée, I have arranged this matter.”",
        "He added heavily, “To-night. That is what I came to tell you.”",
        "In the silence that settled upon them he finally ceased his effort\nto ignore her shocked dismay. He abandoned his airy pretense that\nthe affair could possibly evoke her enthusiasm. He sucked at his\ncigarette like a rather sullen little boy.",
        "“I have always indulged you, Aimée,” he said at last, without\nlooking round at her. “I hope you are not going to make me\ninfernally sorry.”",
        "“I think you are m-making me inf-fernally sorry,” said an unsteady\nlittle voice.",
        "He looked about. His daughter was sitting very still upon the\ngilded sofa beneath the banner of Mahomet; as he regarded her two\ngreat tears formed in her dark eyes and ran slowly down her cheeks.",
        "With a sound of impatience he jumped to his feet and began to pace\nup and down the room.",
        "This, he pointed out heatedly, to her, was what a man got who\nindulged his daughter. This is what came of French and English\ngovernesses and modern ideas.... After all he had done–more than\nany other father! To sit and weep! Weep–at such a marriage! What\ndid she expect of life? Was she not as other women? Did she never\nlook ahead? Had she no pride, no ambition–no hopes? Did she wish\nnever to marry, then, to become an old mees like her English\ncompanion?",
        "“I am but eighteen,” she said quiveringly. “Oh, my father, do not\ngive me to this unknown–”",
        "“Unknown–unknown! Do I not know him?”",
        "“But you promised–”",
        "Angrily he gestured with his cigarette. “Do I know what is good for\nyou or do I not? Have I your interest at heart–tell me! Am I a\nsavage, a dolt–”",
        "“But you do not know what it is to be unhappy. I beg of you, my\nfather,–I should die with such a life before me, with such a man\nfor my husband. I am too French, too like my mother–”",
        "“Ah, your mother!... Too French, are you?... But what would you have\nin France?” he demanded with the bursting appearance of a man\nmaking every effort to restrain himself within unreasonable bounds.\n\"Would not your parents there arrange your marriage? You might see\nthe fiancé,” he caught the words out of her mouth, “but only for a\ntime or two–after the arrangements–and what is that? What more\nwould you know than what your father knows? Are you a thing to be\nexhibited–given to a man to gaze at and appraise? I tell you,\nno.... You are my daughter. You bear my name. And when you marry you\nmarry in the sanctity of the custom of your father–and you go to\nyour husband’s house as his mother went to his father.”",
        "Timidly she protested, “But my mother–and you–”",
        "“Do not speak of your mother! If she were here she would counsel\ngratitude and obedience.” He turned his back on her. “This is what\ncomes,” he muttered, “of this modernity, this education....”",
        "He pitched away his stub as if he were casting all that he hated\naway with it.",
        "She had never seen him so angry. Helplessly she felt that his vanity\nand his word were engaged with the general more than she had\ndreamed. She felt a surge of panic at the immensity of the trouble\nbefore her.",
        "“But, my father, if you love me–”",
        "“No, my little one, if you love me!”",
        "With a sudden assumption of good humor over the angry red mottling\nhis olive cheeks, he came and sat beside her, putting his arm about\nher silently shrinking figure.",
        "“I am a weak fool to stay and drink a woman’s tears, as the saying\ngoes,” he told her, “but this is what a man gets for being good\nnatured.... But, tears or not, I know what is best.... Come, Aimée,\nhave I not ever been fond of you–?”",
        "He patted her hand with his own plump one where bright rings were\nsparkling deep in the encroaching flesh. Aimée looked down with a\nsudden wild dislike.... That soft, ingratiating hand, with its\ndimples and polished nails, which thought it could pat her so easily\ninto submission....",
        "It was nothing to him, she thought, chokingly, whether she was happy\nor unhappy. He had decided on the match–perhaps he had foreseen her\nprotests and plunged into it, so as to be committed against her\nentreaties!–and he was not stopped by any thought of her feelings.",
        "After all her hopes! After all he had promised!",
        "But she told herself that she had never been secure. Beneath all her\ntrust there had always been the silent fear, slipping through the\nshadows like a serpent.... Some instinct for character, more\nprecocious than her years, had whispered through her fond blindness,\nand initiated her into foreboding.",
        "“Come now, my dear,” he said heartily, “this is a surprise, of\ncourse, but after all you will find it is for the best–much for the\nbest–”",
        "His voice died away. After a long pause, “You may make the\narrangements,” she told him in a still, tenacious little voice, “but\nyou cannot make me marry him.... I will never put on the marriage\ndress.... Never wear the diadem.... Never stir one step within his\nhouse.”",
        "A complete silence succeeded this declaration. He got up violently\nfrom beside her. She did not dare look at him. He was going away,\nshe thought.",
        "It would be the beginning of war. She did not know what he would do\nbut she knew that she would endure it.",
        "And the gossip of the harems would be her protection. Her\nopposition, bruited through those feminine channels, would not be\nlong in reaching Hamdi Bey.... And no man could to-day be so callous\nof his pride or the world’s opinion that he would be willing to\nreceive such a revolting bride.",
        "Did her father think of that, that poor, pale power of hers? He\nstood irresolute, as if meditating a last exhortation, and then\nsuddenly turned on her the haggard face of a violent despair.",
        "“Would you see me ruined?” he said passionately.",
        "Sharply he glanced about the room, at the far, closed doors where it\nwas not inconceivable that old Miriam was lurking, and strode over\nto her and began talking very jerkily and huskily, over her bent\nhead.",
        "“I tell you that Hamdi is making this a condition–it is the price\nof silence, of those papers back.... He came to me to-night. I knew\nthat hound of Satan had been smelling about, but I could not\nimagine–as if, between gentlemen–”",
        "At that, she lifted her stupefied head.... Her father, with the face\nof a cornered fox!... She caught her breath with the shock of it.\nHer lips parted, but only her mute eyes asked their startled\nquestions.",
        "Hurriedly, shamefacedly, with angry resentments and\nself-justifications, he was pouring a flood of broken phrases at\nher. She caught unintelligible references to narrow laws and the\nimbecile English, to impositions binding only upon the fools.... And\nthen the word hasheesh.",
        "Sharply then the truth took its outlines. Her father had been\nsmuggling in hasheesh. Hamdi Bey had discovered this, and Hamdi Bey,\nunless silenced, had threatened betrayal.",
        "The danger was real. English laws were stringent. Vaguely the\nhorrors loomed–arrest, trial.... Even if he escaped the scandal was\nruin....",
        "Small wonder that her father had come flying upon the wings of his\ndanger and its deliverance, small wonder that his brow was wet and\nhis lips dry and his eyes hard with terror.",
        "Thrown to the winds now his pretense of affection for Hamdi Bey! He\nhated and feared him. The old fox had done this, he declared, to get\na hold upon him, for always there had been bad blood.",
        "And the bey had heard, of course, of the beauty of the pasha’s\ndaughter. Some cousin had babbled.... And undoubtedly the rumor of\nthat beauty–Tewfick Pasha received his inspiration upon the moment,\nbut that was not gainsaying its truth–had determined the bey to\nfind some vulnerable hold.",
        "He was like that, a soft-voiced, sardonic devil! And this accursed\nbusiness of the hasheesh had served his ends. To-night, he had come\nwith his proofs....",
        "“So you see,” muttered Tewfick Pasha, “what the devil of a serious\nbusiness this is. And how any talk of–of unreadiness–if you were\nnot amiable, for example, to his cousin when she calls upon\nyou–might serve to anger him.... And so–”",
        "Significantly his glance met hers. Her eyes fell, stricken. The\ncolor flooded her trembling face. She quivered with confused pain,\nwith shame for his shame, with terror and fright ... with a hot,\nprotective compassion that tore at her pride....",
        "She struggled against her dismay, trying for reassuring little words\nthat would not come. Her heart seemed beating thickly in her throat.",
        "She never knew just what she said, what little broken words of pity,\nof understanding, of promise, she achieved. But her father suddenly\ndropped beside her, with an abandon reminiscent of the enfant gâtéof his Paris days, and drew her hands to his lips, kissing their\nsoft, quiescent palms.... She drew one away and placed it upon his\ndark head from which the fez had tumbled.",
        "For the moment she was sorry, as one is sorry for a hurt child. And\nher sorriness held her heart warm, in the glow of giving comfort.",
        "She had need of that warmth. For a cold tide was rising in her, a\ntide of chill, irresistible foreboding....",
        "For all the years of her life.... For all the years....",
        "EXPLANATIONS",
        "The remaining hours of Jack Ryder’s night might be divided into\nthree periods. There was an interval of astounding exhilaration\ncoupled with complete mental vacancy, during which a figure in a\nScots costume might have been observed by the astonished Egyptian\nmoon striding obliviously along the silent road to the Nile, past\nsleeping camels and snoring dhurra merchants–a period during\nwhich his sole distinguishable sensation was the memory of\nenchanting eyes, of a voice, low and lovely ... of a slender figure\nin a muffling tcharchaf ... of the touch of soft lips beneath a\ngauzy veil....",
        "This period was succeeded by hours of utter incredulity, in which he\nlay wide-eyed on the sleeping porch of McLean’s domicile and stared\ninto the white cloud of his fly net and questioned high heaven and\nhimself.",
        "Had he really done this? Had he actually caught and kissed this\ngirl, this girl whose name he did not know, whose face he had never\nseen, of whom he knew nothing but that she was the daughter of a\nTurk and utterly forbidden by every canon of sanity and\nself-preservation?",
        "In the name of wonder, what had possessed him? The night? The moon?\nThe mystery of the unknown?... If he had never really kissed her he\nmight have convinced himself that he had never really wanted to. But\nhaving kissed her–!",
        "He looked upon himself as a stranger. A stranger of whom he would be\nremarkably wary, in the days and nights to come ... but a stranger\nfor whom he entertained a sort of secret, amazed respect. There had\nbeen an undeniable dash and daring to that stranger....",
        "During the third period he slept.",
        "When he awoke, late in the morning, and descended from a cold tub to\na breakfast room from which McLean had long since departed, he\nbrought yet another mood with him, a mood of dark, deep disgust and\na shamed inclination to dismiss these events very speedily from\nmemory. For that shadowy and rather shady affair he had abandoned\nthe merry and delightful Jinny Jeffries and got himself involved now\nin the duty of explanations and peacemaking.",
        "What in the world was he going to say?",
        "He meditated a note–but he hated a lie on paper. It looked so\nthunderingly black and white. Besides, he could not think of any.\n\"Dear Jinny–Awfully sorry I was called away.”",
        "No, that wouldn’t do. He could take refuge in no such vagueness.\nUnfortunately, he and Jinny were on such terms of old intimacy that\na certain explicitness of detail was expected.",
        "“Dear Jinny–I had to leave last night and take a girl home–”",
        "No, she would ask about the girl. Jinny had a propensity for\nlocating people. It wouldn’t do.",
        "His masculine instinct for saying the least possible in a matter\nwith a woman, and his ripening experience which taught him to leave\nno mystery to awaken suspicion, wrestled with the affair for some\ntime and then retired from the field.",
        "He compromised by telephoning Jinny briefly–and Jinny was equally\nas brief and twice as cool and cryptic–and promising to take her\nout to tea.",
        "He reflected that if he took her to tea he would really have to stay\nover another night, for it would be too late to regain his desert\ncamp. But the circumstances seemed to call for some social amend....\nAnd no matter how many nights he stayed he certainly was not going\nto lurk about that lane, outside garden doors!",
        "He must have been mad, stark, staring, March-hatter mad!",
        "That morning, during its remainder, he concluded his buying of\nsupplies and saw to their shipment upon the boat that left upon the\nfollowing morning. That noon he lunched with an assistant curator of\nthe Cairo museum who found him a good listener.",
        "That afternoon he escorted Jinny Jeffries and her uncle and aunt,\nthe Josiah Pendletons, to tea upon the little island in the Cairo\npark, where white-robed Arabs brought them tea over the tiny bridge\nand violins played behind the shrubbery and white swans glided upon\nthe blue lake, and then he carried them off in a victoria to view\nthe sunset from the Citadel heights.",
        "Not a word about the dance–except a general affirmative to Mrs.\nPendleton’s question if he had enjoyed himself. The Pendletons had\nnot stayed to look on for long, and Jinny had apparently not worn\nher bleeding heart upon her sleeve.",
        "But this immunity could not last. He could not hug the protecting\nPendletons to him forever.",
        "Nor did he want to. They waned upon him. Mrs. Pendleton’s\nconversation was a perpetual, “Do look at–!” or dissertations from\nthe guide books–already she had imparted a great deal of Flinders\nPetrie to him about his tombs. Mr. Pendleton was neither\nenthusiastic nor voluble, but he was attacking the objects of their\ntravels in the same thorough-going spirit that he had attacked and\nsurmounted the industrial obstacles of his career, and he went to a\ngreat deal of persistent trouble to ascertain the exact dates of\npassing mosques and the conformations of their arches.",
        "The travelers had already “done” the Citadel. They had climbed its\nrocky hill, they had viewed the Mahomet Ali mosque and its columns\nand its carpets and had taken their guide’s and their guidebook’s\nword that it was an inferior structure although so amazingly\neffective from below; they had looked studiously down upon the city\nand tried to distinguish its minarets and towers and ancient gates,\nthey had viewed with proper quizzicalness the imprint in the stone\nparapet of the hoof of that blindfolded horse which the last of the\nMamelukes, cornered and betrayed, had spurred from the heights.",
        "So now, no duty upon them, Ryder led them past the Citadel, up the\nMokattam hills behind it, to that hilltop on which stood the little\nancient mosque of the Sheykh-el-Gauchy, where the sunset spaces\nflowed round them like a sea of light and the world dropped into\nminiature at their feet.",
        "Below them, in a golden haze, Cairo’s domes and minarets were\nshining like a city of dreams. To the north, toy fields, vivid\ngreen, of rice and cotton lands, and the silver thread of the\nwinding Nile, and all beyond, west and southwest, the vast,\nillimitable stretch of desert, shimmering in the opalescent air,\nsweeping on to the farthest edge of blue horizon.",
        "“A nice resting place,” said Jack Ryder appreciatively of the tomb\nof the Sheykh-el-Gauchy.",
        "“I presume the date is given,” Mr. Pendleton was murmuring, as he\nbegan to ferret with his Baedecker.",
        "Mrs. Pendleton sighed sentimentally. “He must have been very fond of\nnature.”",
        "“He was very distrustful of his wives,” said Ryder, grinning. “He\nhad three of them, all young and beautiful.”",
        "“I thought you said he was a saint?” murmured Jinny, to which\ninterpolation he responded, “Wouldn’t three wives make any man a\nsaint?” and resumed his narrative.",
        "“And so he had his tomb made where he could overlook the whole city\nand observe the conduct of his widows.”",
        "“They could move,” objected Miss Jeffries.",
        "“The female of the Mohammedan species is not the free agent that you\nimagine,” Ryder retorted, beginning with a smile and ending with a\nqueer, reminiscent pang. He had a moment’s rather complicated twinge\nof amusement at her reactions if she should know that to an\nencounter with a female of the Mohammedan species was to be\nattributed his departure from her party last night.",
        "And then he remembered that he hadn’t decided yet what to tell her\nand the time was undoubtedly at hand.",
        "The time was at hand. The Pendletons were too thorough-going\nAmericans not to abdicate before the young. They did not saunter\nself-consciously away and make any opportunity for Jack and Jinny,\nas sympathetic European chaperons might have done; they sat\nmatter-of-factedly upon the rocks while their competent young people\nbetook themselves to higher heights.",
        "Conscientiously Ryder was pointing out the pyramid fields.",
        "“Gizeh, Abusir, Sakkara, Dahsur–and now here, if you look–that’s\nthe Medun pyramid–that tiny, sharp prick. If we had glasses....”",
        "“Yes; but why didn’t you like the ball?” murmured Jinny the direct.",
        "“I did like the ball. Very much.”",
        "“Then why didn’t you stay?”",
        "“I–I wasn’t feeling top-hole,” he murmured lamely, wondering why\ngirls always wanted to go back and stir up dogs that had gone\ncomfortably to sleep.",
        "“Did it come on suddenly?” said Jinny, unsympathetically, her eyes\nstill upon the pyramids.",
        "Something whimsical twitched at Jack Ryder’s lips. “Very suddenly.\nLike thunder, out of China crost the bay.”",
        "“I suppose that dancing with the same girl in succession brings on\nthe seizures?”",
        "So she had noticed that!... Not for nothing were those bright, gray\neyes of hers! Not for nothing the red hair.",
        "“Well, I rather think it did,” he said deliberately. “That girl was\na child who hadn’t danced in four years–so she said, and I believe\nher.”",
        "And Jinny received what he intended to convey. “Stepped on your\nbuckled shoon and you felt a martyr?... But why bolt? There were\nother girls who had danced within four years–”",
        "“I went into the garden,” he murmured. “The fact is, I was feeling\nawfully–queer,” he brought out in an odd tone.",
        "Queer was a good word for it. He let it go at that. He couldn’t do\nbetter.",
        "Jinny looked suddenly uncertain. Her pique was streaked with\ncompunction. She had been horribly angry with him for running away,\nand she remembered his opposition to the idea enough to be\nsuspicious of any disappearance–but there was certainly an accent\nof embarrassed sincerity about him.",
        "Perhaps he had been ill. Sudden seizures were not unknown in\nEgypt. And for all his desert brown he didn’t look very rugged.",
        "She murmured, “I hope you hadn’t taken anything that disagreed with\nyou.”",
        "“H’m–it rather agreed with me at the time,” said Jack, and then\nbrought himself up short. “I expect I haven’t looked very sharp\nafter myself–”",
        "But Jinny did not wholly renounce her idea. “Does it always take you\nat dances you don’t want to go to?”",
        "“That’s unfair. I came, you know.”",
        "“You came–and went.”",
        "“I’d have been all right if I hadn’t come,” he murmured, and Jinny\nfelt suddenly ashamed of herself.",
        "“Do you suppose that you would stay all right if you came to\ndinner?” she offered pacificably. “It’s our last night, you know,\ntill we come back from the Nile.”",
        "“I wish I could.” Ryder stopped short. Now, why didn’t he? Certainly\nhe didn’t intend–",
        "But his tongue took matters promptly out of his hesitation’s hands.\n\"Fact is, I’ve an engagement.” He added, appeasingly, “That’s why I\nwas so keen on getting you for tea.” And Jinny told him\nappreciatively that it was a lovely tea and a lovely view.",
        "“We’re going to be at the hotel, I expect,” she threw out,\ncarelessly, “and if you get through in time–”",
        "Rather hastily he assured her that indeed, if he got through in\ntime–",
        "She was a nice girl, was Jinny. A pretty girl, with just the right\namount of red in her hair. Sanity would have sent him to the hotel\nto dine with her.",
        "Sanity would also have sent him to the Jockey Club with McLean.",
        "Certainly sanity had nothing to do with the way that he kept himself\nto himself, after his farewells at the hotel with the Pendletons,\nand took him to an out-of-the-way Greek café where he dined very\nbadly upon stringy lamb and sodden baklava.",
        "Later he wandered restlessly about dark, medieval streets where\nsquat groups were clustered about some coffee house door, intent\nupon a game of checkers or some patriarchal story teller,\nrecounting, very probably, a bandied narration of the Thousand and\nOne Nights. Through other open doors drifted the exasperating nasal\ntwang of Cairene music, and idly pausing, Ryder could see above the\nred fezes and turbans that topped the cross-legged audiences the\ndark, sleek, slowly-revolving body of some desert dancing girl.",
        "Irresolutely he drifted on to the Esbekeyih quarters, to the streets\nwhere the withdrawn camels and donkeys had left pre-eminent the\ncarriages and motors of that stream of Continental night life which\nsets towards Cairo in the season, Russian dukes and German\nmillionaires, Viennese actresses and French singers and ladies of no\navowed profession, gamblers, idlers, diplomats, drifters, vivid\nflashes of color in the bizarre, kaleidoscopic spectacle.",
        "It was quite dark now. The last pale gleam of the afterglow had\nfaded, and the blue of the sky, deepening and darkening, was pierced\nwith the thronging stars. It was very warm; no breeze, but a fitful\nstirring in the tops of the feathery palms.",
        "The streets were growing still. Only from some of the hotels came\nthe sound of music from lighted, open windows.",
        "Jinny would be rather expectant at her hotel. He could, of course,\ndrop in for a few minutes since he was so near.... He walked past\nthe hotel.... Jinny would be packing–or ought to be. A pity to\ndisturb her.... And his dusty tweeds and traveling cap was no\ncalling costume....",
        "He walked past again. And this time he paused, on the brink of a\ndark canyon of a lane, running back between walls hung with\nbougainvillea.",
        "Quite suddenly he remembered that he had told that girl, whose name\nhe did not know, that he would come. It was a definite promise. It\nwas an obligation.",
        "He could do nothing less. It might be unwelcome, absurd, a nuisance,\nbut really it was an obligation.",
        "He sauntered down the lane, keeping carefully in the shadow. He\nloitered within that deep-set door–and felt a queer throb of\nemotion at the sight of it–and so, sauntering and loitering, he\nwaited in the darkening night, promising himself disgustedly through\nthe dragging moments to clear out and be done with this, but still\ninterminably lingering, his pulses throbbing with that disowned\nexpectancy.",
        "Very cautiously, the gate began to open.",
        "AT THE GARDEN GATE",
        "Inch by inch the gate edged open. Warily he presented himself. The\nfurtive crack gave him an instant’s glimpse of a dark form within\nthe shadows, then, in his face, it closed.",
        "Ryder waited. In a moment it was opened wider, and he saw the\ndark-shrouded head and the veiled face of the Turkish girl, and out\nfrom the blackness the sparkle of young eyes.",
        "“Is it–but who is it?” whispered a doubtful voice, and at his, “Why\nit is I–the American,” quickly drawing off his cap, a little hand\ndarted out of the darkness to pluck him swiftly within and the door\nwas closed to within an inch of its opening.",
        "Then the black phantom, drawing him back among the shrubbery,\nagainst the wall, turned with a muffled note of laughter.",
        "“But the costume! Imagine that I–I was looking again for a Scottish\nchieftain with red kilts and a feather in his cap!”",
        "“And instead–” Ryder glanced down at his tweeds with humorous\nrecognition of his change of figure. Then his eyes returned to her.",
        "“But you are the same,” he murmured.",
        "She was indeed the same. The same black street mantle, down to her\nvery brows. The same black veil, up to her very eyes. And the\neyes–! Their soft mysterious loveliness–the little winged tilt of\nthe brows!",
        "Apparently their effect was disconcertingly the same. He was\nconscious of a feeling that was far from a normal calm.",
        "“So you were all right?” he half whispered. “Those steps, last\nnight, you know, made me horribly afraid for you–”",
        "“But, yes, I am all right.”",
        "As excitement gained upon him, a constraint was falling upon her.\nThey were both remembering that moment, overlooked in the rush of\nrecognition, when they had parted in this place, when he had had the\ntemerity to clasp and kiss her.",
        "Aimée was standing rigid and wary, ready for flight at the first\nfear. She told herself that she had only come through pride, the\npride that insisted upon humbling his presumption. She would let him\nsee how bitterly he had offended.... She had only come for this, she\ntold herself–and to see if he had come.",
        "If he had not come! That would have dealt a sorrily humiliating\nblow.",
        "But he was here. And reassured and haughty, repeating that she was\nmortally offended, her spirit alternating between pride and shame\nand a delicious fear, she stood there in the shrubbery, fascinated,\nlike a wild, shy thing of another age.",
        "“That was old Miriam,” she explained constrainedly. “My father had\ncome in–with unexpectedness.”",
        "“Lord, it was lucky you were back!”",
        "“Yes, it was–lucky,” she assented. “If it had been half an hour\nbefore–”",
        "She broke off. There came to the young man a sobering perception of\nthe risk she ran, of the supreme folly of this escapade to which\nthey were entrusting themselves.",
        "It was a realization that deserved some consideration. But,\nobstinately, with young carelessness, he shook it off. After all,\nthis was comparatively safe for her. She was not out of bounds. At\nan alarm he could slip away and no one could ever know. What risk\nthere might be was chiefly his own.",
        "“When you asked who it was,” he murmured, “it occurred to me that\nyou did not know my name–nor I yours. My own,” he added, as she\nstood unresponsive, “is Ryder–Jack Ryder. You can always get a\nletter to me at the Agricultural Bank. That is the quickest way. My\nfriend, McLean there, always knows where my diggings are. When in\nCairo I stop with him; or at the Rossmore House.”",
        "“I shall not need to get a letter to you, monsieur,” she told him\nstiffly.",
        "“But, if you did, how would you sign it?”",
        "“Aimée.... That is French–after my mother.”",
        "“Aimée. That means Beloved, doesn’t it?”",
        "She was silent.",
        "Surely, she thought with a swelling heart, if he were sorry he would\ntell her now. It was the moment for contrition, for appeasement, for\nwhatever explanation his American ways might have.",
        "She had thought about him all night. She had given his declaration a\nhundred forms–but always it had been a declaration.",
        "Now she waited, flagellating her sensitive pride.",
        "Ryder was conscious of the constraint tightening about them and in\nthe dragging pause an uncomfortable common sense had time to put its\ndisconcerting questions.",
        "What did it matter what her name meant? What in the world was he\ndoing here?.... And what did she think she was doing here?... Not\nthat he wanted her to go....",
        "And suddenly it didn’t matter–whatever they thought. It was enough\nthat they were together in that still, soft, jasmine-scented dark.\nHe was breathing quickly; his pulses were beating; he had a feeling\nof strange, heady delight.",
        "The crescent moon was up at last, sailing clear of the house tops,\nsending its bright rays through the filigree of tall shrubs. A\nfinger of light edged the contour of her shrouded head.",
        "He bent a little closer.",
        "“Won’t you,” he said softly, “take off your veil for me?”",
        "Appalled, she clasped it to her. He had no idea in the world of the\nshock of that request. It would be only a faint parallel of its\nimpropriety to suggest to Jinny Jeffries that she discard her frock.\nEven Ryder’s acquaintance with Egypt could not tell him how that\nswift, confident eagerness of his could startle and affront.",
        "“I want to see you so very much,” he was murmuring, and met the\nchill disdain of her retort, “But it is not for you to see my face,\nmonsieur!”",
        "“Who is to see it?” he demanded.",
        "“Who but the man I am to marry,” she gave distinctly back.",
        "The word hit him like stone.",
        "He was conscious of a shock. Did she intend to rebuke–or to\nimply–to question his intention? The steadiness of her low voice\nsuggested a certain steadiness of design.... He had heard of girls\nwho knew their own minds ... girls with unexpectedly far-sighted\nvision.... Perhaps, poor child, she looked upon him as romantic\nescape from all that was restrictive in her life. Secluded women go\nfast–when they start.",
        "The devil take him for that kiss!",
        "A somewhat set look upon his thin face guarded the fluctuations of\nhis soul, but the blood rose strongly under his dark skin.",
        "For a moment he did not venture upon a reply, and in that moment he\nwas suddenly aware that she had caught his meaning from him–and\nthat it was a horrible mistake. It was one of those instants of\nhighly-charged exchanges of meanings whose revelation was as useless\nto be denied as powerless to be explained.",
        "Then her words came in tumultuous, passionate refutation of his\nthought. “That is what my father had come to tell me–that he had\narranged my marriage. It is a very splendid thing. To a general–a\nrich general!”",
        "She had not meant to tell him like that! But for the moment she was\nsavagely glad to hurl it at him.",
        "He made no answer. His eyes were inscrutably intent. A variety of\nthings were rearranging themselves in his head.",
        "“You’re–you’re going to marry him?” he said slowly.",
        "“What else?” But she felt the phrase unfortunate and plunged past\nit. “It is not for me to say no, monsieur. It is for my father to\narrange.”",
        "“But his indulgence–? You were telling me, you know, that he was so\nfond of you. And that you were one of the moderns–the revolting\nmoderns–”",
        "Jack Ryder’s tone was questioningly cynical and its raillery cut\nthrough her brief sham of pride.",
        "“So I thought, too, last night.” A tinge of infinite disillusionment\nwas in her young voice. “But it is not so.”",
        "“Then you accept–?”",
        "The shrouded head nodded.",
        "“But you can’t want to,” he broke out with sudden heat. “You don’t\nknow him at all, do you–this general?”",
        "“Know him? I have never seen his face nor heard his voice–and I\nwould die first,” she added with bitter, helpless fierceness under\nher breath.",
        "The veil muffled that from him. “But why–why?” he repeated in an\nangrily puzzled way.",
        "She made a little gesture of weary impotence. Out of the dark\ndraperies her hands were like white fluttering butterflies.",
        "“What can I do?”",
        "“I should think you could do the Old Harry of a lot.”",
        "“Weep?” said the girl with a pale irony not lost upon him.",
        "“Weep–or row. Or run,” he added, almost reluctantly.",
        "She turned away her head. “I know, I thought once that I could run.\nFor that I stole the key to this gate. But where would I run,\nmonsieur? I have neither friends, nor–nor the resources.... There\nhave been girls–two sisters–who ran away last year–but they were\nalready married and they had cousins in France. For me, my cousins\ndo not exist. I do not know my mother’s family. They disowned her\nfor her marriage, my father says. And so–but it is not possible to\nevade this.... It is not possible. This marriage is required.”",
        "“Required–rot! Can’t you–don’t you–” he paused, looking down upon\nher in tremendous and serious uncertainty. The impulse was strong\nupon him to tell her that he would help her. The accents of her\nvoice had seemed to tear at his very heart.",
        "It was utter madness. Where, in the map of Africa, would he hide\nher? And how would he take care of her? What would he do to her?\nMake love to her? Marry her? Take home a wife from an Egyptian\nharem–a surprising acquisition with which to startle and enchant\nhis decorous family in East Middleton!",
        "And a pretty end to his work here, his reputation, his\nresponsibilities–",
        "It was madness. And the fact that the thought had presented itself,\neven for his flouting mockery, indicated that he was mad. He told\nhimself to be careful. Better men than he had everlastingly done for\nthemselves because upon a night of stars and moonshine some\ndark-eyed girl had played the very devil with their common sense.",
        "He reminded himself that he had never set eyes on her until last\nnight, that she might be the consummate perfection of a minx, that\nthere might not be a word of truth in all of this.",
        "This general, now! Sudden. Not a word about it last night. And now–",
        "He had an inkling that even Mohammedan fathers do not rush matters\nat such a pace.",
        "For all he knew the girl might be inventing this general–for some\nartless reasons of her own. For all he knew she might be married to\nhim and desirous of escape.",
        "But he didn’t believe it. She was too young and shy and virginal.\nThe accents of her candor rebuked his skepticism. He merely told\nhimself these things because the last vestige of his expiring common\nsense was prompting him.",
        "And after all these creditable and excellent exhortations, to the\nutter extinction of the last vestige of that common sense he heard\nhimself saying abruptly, “But isn’t there anything in the world that\nI can do–?”",
        "“Nothing, monsieur.”",
        "“But for you to submit–like this–”",
        "“It is not to be helped.”",
        "“But it is to be helped–if you really dislike it,” he added\njealously.",
        "“I cannot help it, because–because my father–” She hesitated. The\nhonor of her father and her family pride and affection were all\ninvolved, yet suddenly the sacrifice of these became more tolerable\nthan to consent to that image of herself which she saw swiftly\ndefining itself in his mind, that slight, weak creature, whose\nacquiescent passivity submitted to this marriage.",
        "The thought was unbearable. She was burning beneath her veil. She\nwould tell him.... And perhaps she was not averse, in her childish\npride, to the pitiful glory of having him see her in the beauty of\nher filial sacrifice.",
        "“My father has–has done something against the English laws,” she\nfaltered, “and Hamdi Bey, this general, knows of it, and will inform\nunless–unless my father makes this marriage. A cousin of his has\nseen me,” she added, her young vanity forlornly rearing its head,\n\"and told Hamdi that I am not–not too ill-looking a girl–”",
        "Her essay of a laugh died.",
        "Ryder’s look deepened its sharp, defensive concentration.",
        "“This is true–I mean your father is not just putting something\nover–telling you to get your consent?”",
        "Her thoughts flew back to her father’s haggard face. “Oh, it is\ntrue! I know.”",
        "“And he’s going to hand you over–What sort is this Hamdi?”",
        "“A general. Old. Evil enough to lay traps to obtain me.”",
        "“It’s abomination.” The anger in the young man surged beyond his\ncontrol. “You must not do it.... If your father is clever enough to\nbreak a law let him be clever enough to mend it–by himself. Such a\nsacrifice is not required.... You must realize what this means to\nyou. You must realize–Look here, I’ll help you. I’ll plan some\nescape. There must be ways. I have friends–”",
        "She stifled the leap of her heart. She held her head high and made\nwhat she thought was a very noble little speech. “It is for my\nfather, monsieur. You do not understand. It is to save my father.”",
        "He looked at her in silence. He was afraid to answer for a moment;\nhe could feel the unruly blood beating even in the lips he pressed\ntogether.",
        "“But don’t you understand–” he blurted at last and broke off.",
        "After all, he did not know this girl. If he swayed her judgment now,\nand dragged her away, what life, what compensation could he offer\nher? How did he know that she would not regret it? Would she be\nhappier in a world unknown?....",
        "She had been brought up to this sort of thing. It was bred in\nher.... Marriage was her inevitable game. This very charm she\nexercised, this subtle, haunting invasion of his senses, what was\nthat but another proof of the harem existence where all influences\nwere forced to serve the ends of sex ...",
        "And she was so maddeningly resigned to taking this general!",
        "A queer hot rage was gaining possession of him. “Oh, well, if you\nprefer this,” he said brutally, with a youthful desire to wreak pain\nin return for that strange pain which something was inflicting upon\nhim.",
        "A girl who would let him kiss her one night–and on the next inform\nhim that she was giving herself to an unknown–an old Turk.... If\nshe could go like that, to some other’s arms and lips ...",
        "He wanted to take her fiercely in his arms and crush her lips\nagainst his and then fling her away and say, “Oh, go to him now–if\nyou can!”",
        "And at the same time he wanted to gather her to him as tenderly as\nif she were a flower he was guarding and tell her that he would\nprotect her against all the world.",
        "He was divided and confused and blindly angry. He felt baffled and\nfrustrated. He was both aching and raging. And yet he was capable of\nreminding himself, in some corner of his uninvaded mind, that this\nwas undoubtedly the best thing for them both.",
        "What else? For him? For her?",
        "And yet his tongue went on stabbing her.",
        "“If this is what you are determined to do–” he heard himself saying\nhardly, yet with a hint of deferred finality.",
        "It was as if he had said, “If this, then, is what you are like! If\nyou are the soft, submissive harem creature, the toy, the\nodalisque–If you will endure undesired love rather than face the\nworld–”",
        "And she knew that was what he was saying to her. The injustice\nbrought a lump of self-pity to her throbbing throat.... That he\nshould not realize and honor the courage of her sacrifice.... That\nhe should reproach, despise.... She had expected other entreaties\n... protestations....",
        "Her heart ached with a throb of steady dreariness.",
        "But she did not stir. Not a line of her drooping draperies wavered\ntowards him. And swallowing that lump in her throat, she achieved a\ntoneless, “That is what I am going to do.”",
        "At the other end of the garden a sound came from the house.",
        "Ryder seemed to rouse himself. “Good-bye, then,” he said,\nuncertainly.",
        "“Good-bye, monsieur.”",
        "He looked oddly at her. “Good-bye,” he muttered again, and turned,\nand stumbled out of the gate.",
        "A pool of moonlight lay without its arches, and he stepped into it\nas if coming out of the shadows of an enchanted garden. He stood and\nstraightened himself as if throwing off that garden’s spell. He put\nback his shoulders and took a quick step down the lane.",
        "A slight sound drew his eyes back.",
        "She had followed him to the gate; she stood there, in the moonlight,\nagainst the inky wells of shadow into which her black robe flowed,\nand in the moonlight her face, gazing after him, was an exquisite,\nethereal apparition, like a spirit of the garden.",
        "She had cast off her veil. He had a vision of her dark eyes shining\nover rose-flushed cheeks, of deeper-rose-red lips in curves of\nhaunting sweetness, of the tender contour of her young face, fixed\nunforgettingly in the radiant moonlight–only an instant’s vision,\nfor while the blood stopped in his veins the darkness engulfed her,\nlike a magician’s curtain.",
        "But he waited while he heard the gate closed. Still he waited while\nhe heard her locking it. And then for all his hot young pride, he\nturned back and knocked upon it. He called softly. He whispered\nentreaties.",
        "Not a sound. Not an answer.",
        "In a revulsion of feeling he turned and made his way blindly from\nthe lane.",
        "She had heard his voice. Like a creature utterly spent, she had been\nleaning against the great gate from which she had withdrawn the key.\nBut she uttered not a breath in answer, and after she had heard his\nfootsteps die away she turned slowly back and groped among the rose\nroots for the key’s hiding place.",
        "Mechanically she smoothed it over and moved on towards the house.\nAll was quiet there. That sound had been no alarm. Unobserved she\nslipped within the little door, and up the spiral steps.",
        "She had not seen the dark eyes that were watching her, from the\nother side of the rose thicket. After the girl had gained the house,\nthe old woman came forward and stooped before the marked bush,\nmuttering under her breath at the thorns. After a few moments she\ngave a little grunt of satisfaction and her exploring hand drew out\nthe key.",
        "Smoothing again the rifled hiding place among the roses, she made\nher careful way into the house.",
        "A SECRET OF THE SANDS",
        "The siesta was past. The sun was tilting towards the west and\nshadows were beginning to jut out across the blazing sands.",
        "Over the mounds of rubbish the bearers had resumed their slow\nprocession, a picturesque frieze of tattered, indigo-robed, ebony\nfigures, baskets on heads, against a cloudless cobalt sky, and again\nthe hot air was invaded with the monotonous rise and fall of their\nlabor chant.",
        "A man with a short, pointed red beard and an academic face beneath a\npith helmet was stooping over the siftings from those baskets,\nintent upon the stream of sand through the wire screens. Patiently\nhe discarded the unending pebbles, discovering at rare intervals\nsome lost bead, some splinter of old sycamore wood, some fragment of\npottery in which a Ptolemy had sipped his wine–or a kitchen wench\nhad soaked her lentils.",
        "Beyond the man were traces of the native camp, a burnt-out fire, a\nroll of rags, a tattered shelter cloth stuck on two tottering\nsticks, and distributed indiscriminatingly were a tethered goat, a\nwhite donkey with motionless, drooping ears, and a few supercilious\ncamels.",
        "The camp was in the center of a broken line of foothills on the\ndesert’s edge. North and south and west the wide sands swept out to\nmeet the sky, and to the east, shutting out the Nile valley, the\nhills reared their red rock from the yellow drift.",
        "Among the jutting rock in the foreground yawned dark mouths that\nwere the entrances of the discovered tombs, and within one of these\ntombs was another white man. He was conducting his own siftings in\nhigh solitude, a lean, bronzed young man, with dark hair and eyes\nand, at the present moment, an unexhilarated expression.",
        "It had been two weeks since Jack Ryder had returned to camp. Two\ninterminable weeks. They were the longest, the dullest, the\ndreariest, the most irritatingly undelighting weeks that he had ever\nlived through.",
        "But bitterly he resented any aspersion from the long-suffering\nThatcher upon his disposition. He wanted it distinctly understood\nthat he was not low-spirited. Not in the least. A man wasn’t in\nthe dumps just because he wasn’t–well, garrulous. Just because he\ndidn’t go about whistling like a steam siren or exult like a cheer\nleader when some one dug up the effigy of a Hathor-cow.... Just\nbecause he objected when the natives twanged their fool strings all\nnight and wailed at the moon.",
        "The moon was full now. Round and white it went sailing blandly over\nthe eternal monotony of desert.... Round and white, it lighted up\nthe eternal sameness of life.... He had never noticed it before, but\na moon was a poignantly depressing phenomenon.",
        "He couldn’t help it. A man couldn’t make himself be a comedian. It\nwasn’t as if he wanted to be a grump. He would have been glad to be\nglad. He wanted Thatcher to make him glad. He defied him to.",
        "He didn’t enjoy this flat, insipid taste of things, this dull grind,\nthis feeling of sameness and dullness that made nothing seem worth\nwhile.... A feeling that he had been marooned on a desert island,\nfar from all stir and throb of life.",
        "Suppose he did dig up a Hathor-cow? Suppose he dug up Hathor\nherself, or Cleopatra, or ten little Ptolemies? What was the good of\nit?",
        "Not Jinny Jeffries herself could have cast more aspersions upon the\npersonal value of excavations.",
        "When he was tired of denying to himself that there was anything\nunusual the matter with him, he shifted the inner argument and took\nup the denial that anything which had happened in Cairo those two\nweeks before had anything to do with it. As if that rash encounter\nmattered! As if he were the silly, senseless sentimental sort of\nidiot to go mooning about his work because of a girl–and a girl\nfrom a harem with a taste for secret masquerades and Turkish\nmarriages!",
        "As if he cared–!",
        "Of course–he admitted this logically and coldly now to himself, as\nhe sat there in the ray of his excavator’s lantern, on the sanded\nfloor at the end of the Hall of Offerings–of course, he was sorry\nfor the girl. It was no life for any young girl–especially a\nspirited one, with her veins bubbling with French blood.",
        "The system was wrong. If they were going to shut up those girls,\nthey had no business to bring them up on modern ideas. If they kept\nthe mashrubiyeh on the windows and the yashmak on their faces they\nought to keep the kohl on their eyes and the henna on their fingers\nand education out of their hidden heads.",
        "It was too bad.... But, of course, they were brought up to it. Look\nhow quickly that girl had given in. She was Turkish, through and\nthrough. Submissive. Docile.... And a darned good thing she was,\ntoo! Suppose she had taken him at his fool word. Suppose she had\nreally wanted to get away!",
        "Lucky, that’s what he’d been. And it would be a lesson to him. Never\nagain. No more masked young things with their stolen keys and their\nharem entrances. No more whispered tales of woe in a shady garden.\nNo more–",
        "Violently he wrenched himself from his No Mores. Recollection had a\nway of stirring an unpleasant tumult.",
        "But it was all over. He had forgotten it–he would forget it. He\nwould forget her. Work, that was the thing. Normal, sensible,\nevery day work.",
        "But there was no joy in this tonic work. Somewhere, between a night\nand a morning, he had lost that glow of accomplishment which had\nbuoyed him, which had made him fairly ecstatic over the discovery of\nthis very tomb.",
        "For this tomb was his own find. It had been found long before by the\nplundering Persians, and it had been found by Arabs who had\nplundered the Persian remains–but between and after those findings\nthe oblivious sands had swept over it, blotting it from the world,\nchoking the entrance hall and the shafts, seeping through\nhalf-sealed entrances and packing its dry drift over the rifled\nsarcophagus of the king and over the withered mummy of the young\ngirl in the ante-room. The tombs had been cleared now, down almost\nto the stone floors, and Ryder was busy with the drifts that had\nlodged in the crevices about the entrance to the shaft.",
        "It was really an important find. Although much plundered, the walls\nwere intact, and the delicate carvings in the white limestone walls\nwere exceptional examples. And there were some very interesting\nthings to decipher. A scholar and an explorer could well be\nenthusiastic.",
        "But Ryder continued to look far from enthusiastic. Even when his\ngroping fingers, searching a cranny, came in contact with a hard\nsubstance his face did not change to any lightning radiance.\nUnexpectantly he picked up the sand-encrusted lump and brushed it\noff. A gleam of gold shone in his hand. But it was no ancient amulet\nor necklace or breast guard–nor was it any bit of the harness of\nthe plundering Persians. It was a locket, very heavily and ornately\ncarved.",
        "He stood a moment staring down at the thing with a curious feeling\nof having stood staring down at exactly the same thing before–that\nsubconscious feeling of the repetition of events which supports the\ntheories of reincarnationists–and then, quite suddenly, memory came\nto his aid.",
        "In McLean’s office. That day of the masquerade. Those visiting\nFrenchmen and that locket they had shown him. Of course the thing\nreminded him–",
        "And it was remarkably alike. The same thick oval, the same ponderous\neffect of the coat of arms–if it should prove the same coat of arms\nthat would be a clue!",
        "With his mind still piecing the recollection and surmise together\nhis fingers pressed the spring. There was a miniature within, but it\nwas not the picture of Monsieur Delcassé. Ryder was looking down\nupon the face of a girl, a beautiful, spirited face, with merry eyes\nand wistful lips–dark eyes, with a lovely arch of brow, and\nrose-red lips with haunting curves.",
        "And eyes and brows and lips and curves, it was the face of the girl\nwho had gazed after him in the moonlight against the shadows of the\npasha’s garden.",
        "TO McLEAN’S ASTONISHMENT",
        "“It is no end of good of you, Jack, to take this trouble,” Andrew\nMcLean remarked appreciatively, looking up from his scrutiny of the\npacket which his unexpected luncheon guest had pushed over to his\nplate.",
        "“Uncommon thoughtful. It’s undoubtedly a twin to that locket, the\nportrait of the man’s wife–whatever his name was.”",
        "“Delcassé,” said Jack Ryder promptly.",
        "Gratefully he drained the second lemon squash which the\nsilent-footed Mohammed had placed at his elbow. It had been a hard\nmorning’s trip, this coming in from camp in high haste, and he was\nhot and dusty.",
        "“You might have sent the thing,” McLean mentioned. “I daresay that\nspecial agent chap has left the country, for I recollect he said he\nwas at the end of his search.... And, of course, this isn’t much of\na clue–eh, what?”",
        "“It’s everything of a clue,” insisted Ryder. “It shows where this\nFrenchman was working, for the first thing–”",
        "“Unless it had been stolen by some native who lost it in that\ntomb.”",
        "“Natives don’t lose gold lockets. Of course it might have been\nstolen and hidden–but that’s far-fetched. It’s much more likely\nthat this was the very tomb where Delcassé was working at the time\nof his death. For one thing, the place showed signs of previous\nexcavation up to the inner corridor, and there I’ll swear no modern\ngot ahead of me. And for another thing, it’s a perfect specimen of\nthe limestone carving of the Tomb of Thi which Delcassé wrote his\nbook about–looks very much as if it might be by the same artist.\nThere’s a flock of hippopotami in a marsh scene with the identical\ndrawing, and there’s the same lovely boat in full sail–but there,\nyou bounder, you don’t know the Tomb of Thi from a thyroid gland.\nYou’re here to administer financial justice, the middle, the high,\nand the low; your soul is with piasters, not the past. But take my\nword for it, it’s exactly the spot where an enthusiast of the Thi\nTomb would be grubbing away.... Lord, they could choose their find\nin those days!”",
        "“It’s uncommonly likely,” McLean conceded, abandoning his demolished\ncherry tart and pulling out his briar. “And if the locket proves the\nduplicate of the other it indicates that it’s a portrait of Madame\nDelcassé, but it doesn’t indicate what has become of Madame\nDelcassé.... Though in a general way,” McLean deduced with Scotch\njudicialness, “it supports the theory of foul play. The woman would\nhardly have lost her miniature, or have sold it, except under\npressing conditions. In fact–”",
        "Ryder was brusque with his facts.",
        "“That doesn’t matter–Madame Delcassé doesn’t matter. The thing that\nmatters is–”",
        "As brusquely he broke off. His tongue balked before the revelation\nbut he goaded it on.",
        "“That there is a girl–the living image of that picture.”",
        "“I say!” McLean looked up at that, distinctly intrigued. “That’s\ngetting on.... You mean you’ve seen her?”",
        "Ryder nodded, suddenly busy with his cigarette.",
        "“Where is she, now? In Cairo? That’s luck, man!... And you say she’s\nlike?”",
        "“You’d think it her picture.”",
        "“It’s an uncommon face.” McLean bent over it again. “I fancied the\nartist had just been making a bit of beauty, but if there’s a girl\nlike that–! Fancy stumbling on that!... But where is she? And what\nname does she go by?”",
        "“Oh, her name–she doesn’t know her own, of course.” Ryder paused\nuncertainly. “She’s in Cairo,” he began again vaguely. “She’d be\njust about the right age–eighteen or so. She–she’s had awf’ly\nhard, luck.” Distressfully he hesitated.",
        "The shrewd eyes of McLean dwelt upon him in sorrowful silence. “Eh,\nJock,” he said at last, with mock scandal scarcely veiling rebuke.\n\"I did not know that you knew any of that sort–the poor, wee lost\nthing.... Tell me, now–”",
        "“Tell you you’re off your chump,” said Jack rudely. “She’s no lost\nlamb. Fact is, she’s never spoken to a man–except myself.” He\nrather enjoyed the start this gave McLean after his insinuations. It\nhelped him on with his story.",
        "“The girl doesn’t know her own name at all, I gather. She thinks\nshe’s the daughter of Tewfick Pasha. Her mother married the Turk and\ndied very soon afterwards and he brought up this girl as his own.\nShe says she’s his only child.”",
        "He paused, ostensibly to blow an elaborate smoke ring, but actually\nto enjoy McLean’s astonishment. As astonishment, it was distinctly\nvivid. It verged upon a genuine horror as Ryder’s meaning sank into\nhis friend’s mind.",
        "McLean knew–slightly–Tewfick Pasha. He knew–supremely–the\ninviolable seclusion of a daughter of such a household. He knew the\nutter impossibility of any man’s speech with her.",
        "Yet here was Ryder telling him–",
        "Ryder’s telling him was a sketchy performance. He mentioned the\ngirl’s appearance at the masquerade and their acquaintance. He\ntouched lightly upon her attempted flight and his pursuit. Even more\nlightly he passed over those lingering moments at her garden gate\nand the exchange of confidences.",
        "“She said that her dead mother had been French. And that her name\nwas her mother’s–Aimée. So there is–”",
        "“But the likeness, man–her face? She never unveiled to you?”",
        "“Well, the next night–”",
        "“The next night?”",
        "It was at this point that Ryder began to lose his relish of McLean’s\nastonishment.",
        "“Yes, the next night,” he repeated with careful carelessness.... “I\ntold the girl I would come and see if she got in all right–there\nhad been some footsteps the night before–”",
        "“And you went? And she came?”",
        "“Do you suppose she sent her father?”",
        "“You’re lucky she didn’t send her father’s eunuch,” McLean retorted\ngrimly. “Well, get on with your damning story. The girl took off her\nveil–”",
        "“Nothing of the kind,” said Jack a trifle testily–so soon does\nconventional masculinity champion the conservatism of the other sex!\n\"That was just as I was going–gone, in fact. I looked back and she\nhad drawn her veil aside. The moon was bright on her face–I saw her\nas clear as daylight, and I tell you that this miniature is a\npicture of her. She is Delcassé’s daughter and she doesn’t know it.\nHer mother was stolen by that disgusting old Turk–”",
        "“Hold on a bit. Fifteen years ago Tewfick could hardly have been\nthirty and he has the rep of a Don Juan. It may have been a love\naffair or it may have been plunder.... The girl remembers her?”",
        "“Very little. She was so young when her mother died. She said that\nthe father was so in love that he never married again.”",
        "“H’m ... It seems to me that I’ve heard tales of our Tewfick and of\npretty ladies in apartments. Cairo is a city of secrets and\ntattlers. However–as to this Delcassé inheritance, I’ll just notify\nthe French legation–”",
        "“We’ll have to look sharp,” said Ryder quickly. “There’s no time to\nlose. The girl is to be married.”",
        "“Married?... But she’ll inherit the money just the same.”",
        "“But she doesn’t want to be married,” Ryder insisted anxiously. “Her\nfather–her alleged father–has just sprung this on her. Says there\nare political or financial reasons. He’s been caught in some dirty\nwork by this Hamdi Bey and he’s stopping Hamdi’s mouth with the\ngirl.... And we’ve got to stop that.”",
        "“I wonder if we can,” said McLean thoughtfully.",
        "“If we can? When the girl is French? When she’s been lied to and\ndeceived?”",
        "“She seems to have been taken jolly well care of. Brought up as his\nown and all that. Keep your shirt on, Jack,” McLean advised dryly\nwith a shrewd glance from his gray eyes at the other’s unguarded\nheat.",
        "Then his eyes dropped to the miniature again. A lovely face. A\nlovely unfortunate creature.... And if the daughter looked like\nthat, small wonder that Jack was touched.... Beauty in distress.",
        "Some men had all the luck, McLean reflected. He had never taken Jack\nfor the gallivanting kind, either, yet here he was going to\nmasquerades with one girl and coming home with another....",
        "Jack was too good looking, that was the trouble with the youngster.\nGood looking and gay humored. The kind that attracted women....\nWomen and romance were never fluttering about lank, light-eyed,\nuninteresting old Scotchmen of twenty-nine!",
        "A mild and wistful pang, which McLean refused to name, made itself\nknown.",
        "“I’ll see the legation,” he began.",
        "“At once. I’ll wait,” urged Ryder.",
        "And at once McLean went.",
        "The result was what he had foreseen. The legation was appreciative\nof his interest. That special agent had returned to France but his\naddress was left, and undoubtedly the family of Delcassé would be\ngrateful for any information which Monsieur McLean could send.",
        "“Send!” repudiated Ryder hotly. “Write to France and back–wait for\nsomebody to come over! Can’t the legation do something now?”",
        "“The legation has no authority. They can’t take the girl away from\nthe man who is, at any rate, her step-father.”",
        "“They can put the fear of God into him about this marriage. They\ncan deny his right to hand her over to one of his pals. They can\nthreaten him with an inquiry into the circumstances of her mother’s\nmarriage.”",
        "“And why should they? They may regard it as a very natural marriage.\nAnd remember, my dear Jack, that the legation has no desire to\nalienate the affections of influential Turks, or criticize\nfifteen-years-ago romances. You have a totally wrong impression of\nthe responsibilities of foreign representatives.”",
        "“But to let him dispose of a French girl–”",
        "“He is disposing of her, as his daughter, in honorable marriage to a\nwealthy and aristocratic general. There can be no question of his\nmotives–”",
        "“Of course, if you think that sort of thing is all right–”",
        "Carefully McLean ignored the other’s wrath.",
        "Patiently he explained. “It’s not what I think, my dear fellow, it’s\nwhat the legation thinks. There’s not a chance in the world of\ngetting the marriage stopped.”",
        "“Then I’ll do it myself,” declared Ryder. “I’ll see this Tewfick\nPasha and talk to him. Tell him the money is to come to the girl\nonly when she is single. Tell him the French law gives the father’s\nrepresentatives full charge. Tell him that he kidnapped the mother\nand the government will prosecute unless the girl is given her\nliberty. Tell him anything. A man with a guilty conscience can\nalways be bluffed.”",
        "In silence McLean gazed upon him, perplexed and clouded, his\nquizzical twinkle gone. Jack was taking this thing infernally to\nheart.... And it was a bad business.",
        "“You will let me do the telling,” he stated at last, grimly. “What\ncan be said, I’ll say. Like a fool, I will meddle.”",
        "And so it happened that within another hour two very stiff and\nconstrained young men were ringing the bell at the entrance door of\nTewfick Pasha.",
        "TEWFICK RECEIVES",
        "A huge Soudanese admitted them. They found themselves in a tiled\nvestibule, looking through open arches into the green of a\ngarden–that garden, Ryder hardly needed to remind himself, with\nwhose back door he had made such unconventional acquaintance.",
        "Now he had a glimpse of a sunny fountain and fluttering pigeons,\nand, on either side of the garden, of the two wings of the building,\ngay white walls with green shutters more suggestive of a French\nvilla than an Egyptian palace, before the Soudanese marshaled them\ntoward the stairs upon the right.",
        "The left, then, was the way to the haremlik. And somewhere in those\nsecluded rooms, to which no man bat the owner of the palace ever\ngained admission, was Aimée.",
        "The Soudanese mounted the stairs before them and held open a door\ninto a long drawing-room from which the pasha’s modernity had\nstripped every charm except the color of some worn old rugs; the\nwindows were draped in European style, the walls exhibited paper\ninstead of paneling; in one corner was a Victrola and in another,\nbeside a lounge chair, stood a table littered with cigarette trays\nand French novels with explicit titles.",
        "The only Egyptian touch to the place was four enormous oil portraits\nof pompous turbaned gentlemen, in one of whom Ryder recognized the\nfamiliar rotundity of Mahomet Ali in his grand robes.",
        "As a pasha’s palace it was a blow, and Ryder’s vague, romantic\nnotions of high halls and gilded arches, suffered a collapse.",
        "Tewfick Pasha came in with haste. He had been going out when these\ncallers were announced and he was dressed for parade, in a very\nlight, very tight suit, gardenia in his button-hole, cane in his\ngloved hands, fez upon his head. For all their smiling welcome, his\nfull, dark eyes were uneasy.",
        "He had grown distrustful of surprises.",
        "It was McLean’s affair to reassure him. Far from fulminating any\naccusations the canny Scot announced himself as the bearer of glad\ntidings. A fortune, he announced, was coming to the pasha–or to the\npasha’s family. A very rich old woman in France had decided to\nchange her will.",
        "There he paused and the pasha continued to smile non-committally,\nbut the word fortune was operating. In the back of his mind he was\nhastily trying to think of rich old women in France who might change\ntheir wills.",
        "“I am afraid that it is my stupidity which has kept you from the\nknowledge of this for some weeks,” McLean went on. “I had so many\nother matters to look up that I did not at once consult my records.\nAnd it has been so many years since you married Madame Delcassé that\nthe name had slipped general recollection.... It was twelve years\nago, I believe, that she died?”",
        "Casually he waited and Jack Ryder held his breath. He felt the full\nsuspense of a pause long enough for the pasha’s thoughts to dart\ndown several avenues and back. If the man should deny it! But why\nshould he? What harm in the admission, after all these years, with\nMadame Delcassé dead and buried? And with a fortune involved in the\nadmission.",
        "The Turk bowed and Ryder breathed again.",
        "“Ten years,” said Tewfick softly.",
        "“Ah–ten. But there has been no communication with France for twelve\nyears or even longer?”",
        "“Possibly not, monsieur.”",
        "“This old aunt,” pursued McLean, “was a person of prejudice as well\nas fortune–hence it has taken a little time for her to adjust\nherself.” He paused and looked understandingly at the Turk, who\nnodded amiably as one whose comprehension met him more than half\nway.",
        "“My own aunt was of a similar obstinacy,” he murmured. He added,\n\"This fortune you speak of–it comes through my wife?”",
        "“For her inheritors. Madame Delcassé–the former Madame Delcassé I\nshould say–left but one daughter?”",
        "Again the pasha bowed and again Ryder felt the throb of triumph. He\nlooked upon his friend with admiration. How marvelously McLean had\nworked the miracle. No accusations, no threats, no obstacles, no\nblank walls of denial! Not a ruffle of discord in the establishment\nof these salient facts–the marriage of Madame Delcassé to the pasha\nand the existence of the daughter.",
        "Wonderful man–McLean. He had never half appreciated him.",
        "But the pasha was not wholly the simple assenter.",
        "“Do I understand,” he inquired, “that there is a fortune coming from\nFrance for my daughter?” And at McLean’s confirmation, “And when you\nsay fortune,” he continued, “you intend to say–?” and his glance\nnow took in the silent American, considering that some cue must be\nhis.",
        "But McLean responded. “The figures are not to be divulged–not until\nthe aunt is in communication with her niece. But they will be large,\nmonsieur, for this aunt is a person of great wealth.”",
        "“And yet alive to enjoy it,” said Tewfick with smiling eyes.",
        "“An aged and dying woman,” thrust in Ryder in haste. “Her only care\nnow is to see her niece before she dies.”",
        "“Ah!... But that could be arranged,” said Tewfick amiably.",
        "“We have at once communicated with France,” McLean told him, “but we\ncame instantly to you, to, inform you–”",
        "“A thousand thanks and a thousand! The bearers of good tidings,\"\nsmiled their host.",
        "“Because we understand that there is a question of the young lady’s\nmarriage,” pursued McLean, “and you would, of course, wish to defer\nthis until these new circumstances are complied with.”",
        "The pasha stared. “Not at all. A fortune is as pleasant to a wife as\nto a maid.”",
        "“There are so many questions of law,” offered McLean with purposeful\nvagueness. “French wardship and trusteeship and all that. It would\nbe advisable, I think, to wait.”",
        "“Absurd,” said the pasha easily.",
        "“You would want no doubts cast upon the legality of the marriage,\"\nMcLean persisted thoughtfully, “and since mademoiselle is under age\nand the French law has certain restrictions–”",
        "“Pff! We are not under the French law–at least I have not heard\nthat England has relinquished her power,” retorted Tewfick not\nwithout malice.",
        "“But Mademoiselle Delcassé is French,” thrust in Ryder. He knew that\nMcLean had ventured as far as he, an official and responsible\nperson, could go, and that the burden of intimation must rest upon\nhimself. “And under her father’s will his family there is\nconsidered in trusteeship. So there would be certain technicalities\nthat must be considered before any marriage can be arranged, the\nsignature of the French guardian, the settlement of the dot–this\ninheritance, for instance–all mere formalities but involving a\nlittle delay.”",
        "Tewfick Pasha turned in his chair and cocked his eyes at this\nstrange young man who had dropped from the blue with this extensive\nadvice. He looked puzzled. This American fitted into no type of his\nacquaintance. He was so very young and slim and boyish ... with not\nat all the air of a legal representative.... But McLean’s position\nvouched for him.",
        "“You speak for the French family, monsieur?”",
        "Unhesitatingly Ryder declared that he did.",
        "“Then you may inform the family,” announced Tewfick, bristling,\n\"that my daughter has been very well cared for all these years\nwithout advice from France.”",
        "“I haven’t a doubt of it,” said Ryder quickly, “but the French law\nmight begin to entertain doubts of it, if mademoiselle were married\noff now without consultation with the authorities.... Already,” he\nadded a little meaningly, as the other shrugged the suggestion away,\n\"there have been questions raised concerning the mother’s marriage\nand the separation of the little Mademoiselle Delcassé from her\nrelatives in France, and now if she were to be married without any\nlegal settlement of her estate–”",
        "Steadily he sustained the other’s gaze, while his unfinished thought\nseemed to float significantly in the air about them.",
        "“Have a cigarette,” said the pasha hospitably, extending a gold case\nmonogrammed with diamonds and emeralds. “Ah, coffee!” he announced,\nwelcomingly, as a little black boy entered with a brass tray of\nsteaming cups.",
        "“I hope, gentlemen, that you like my coffee. It is not the usual\nTurkish brew. No, this comes from Aden, the finest coffee in the\nworld. A ship captain brings it to me, especially.”",
        "Beamingly he sipped the scalding stuff, then darted back to that\nsuspended sentence. “But you were saying–something of a\ntrusteeship?... Do I understand that it is an aunt of Madame\nDelcassé–the former Madame Delcassé–who is leaving this money?”",
        "“Not of Madame but of Monsieur Delcassé,” McLean informed him.",
        "“Ah!... That accounts ... But in that case, then, there need be no\nconcern in France over my daughter’s marriage....” He turned his\nround eyes from one to the other a moment.",
        "“There is no Mademoiselle Delcassé.”",
        "“Sir?” said Ryder sharply.",
        "“There is no Mademoiselle Delcassé,” repeated the pasha, his eyes\nfrankly enlivened.",
        "“But–we have just been speaking–you cannot mean to say–”",
        "“We have been speaking of my daughter–the daughter of the former\nMadame Delcassé.”",
        "Smilingly he looked upon them. “A pity that we did not understand\neach other. But you appear to know so much–and I supposed that you\nknew that, too, that the daughter of Monsieur Delcassé was dead.”",
        "Neither of the young men spoke. McLean looked politely attentive;\nRyder’s face maintained that look of concentration which guarded the\nfluctuations of his feelings.",
        "“It was many years ago,” the pasha murmured, putting down his coffee\ncup and selecting another cigarette. “Not long after her mother’s\nmarriage to me.... A very charming little girl–I was positively\nattached to her,” Tewfick added reminiscently.",
        "“Well, well, well, what a pity now,” said McLean very slowly.\n\"This will be a great disappointment.... And so the present\nmademoiselle–”",
        "“Is my daughter.”",
        "McLean was silent. Ryder could hardly trust himself to speak.",
        "“What did she die of?” he asked at last, in a voice whose edged\nquality brought the pasha’s glance to him with a flash of hostility\nbehind its veil.",
        "But he answered calmly enough. “Of the fever, monsieur.... She was\nnever strong.”",
        "“And her grave... I should like to make a report.”",
        "“It was in the south ... desert burial, I am afraid. You must know\nthat the little one was hardly a true believer for our cemetery.”",
        "“And you would say that she was only five or six years old?” Ryder\npersisted.",
        "The pasha nodded.",
        "“I should like to get as near as possible to the date if it is not\ntoo much trouble.... The father died about fifteen years ago and the\nmother was married to you soon after?”",
        "“Really, monsieur, you–”",
        "Tewfick was frankly restive.",
        "“I know nothing of the father,” he said sullenly. “And as to the\nchild’s death–how can one recall after these years? In one, two\nyears after she came to me–one does not grave these things upon the\neyeballs.”",
        "“But you do remember that it was long ago–when your own daughter\nwas very little?”",
        "“Exactly. That is my recollection, monsieur.... And I recall,” said\nthe pasha, suddenly obliging and sentimental, “that even my little\none cried for the child. It was afflicting.... Assure the family in\nFrance of my sympathy in their disappointment.”",
        "“I am sorry that my news is after all of no interest to you,\"\nobserved McLean, setting the example for rising. “You will pardon my\nerror of information–and accept my appreciation of your courtesy.”",
        "“It is I who am indebted for your trouble,” their host assured\nthem, all smiles again.",
        "But Ryder was not to be led away without a parting shot.",
        "“The name of the Delcassé child–was Aimée?”",
        "Imperceptibly Tewfick hesitated. Then bowed in assent.",
        "“Odd,” said young Ryder thoughtfully. “And your own daughter’s name,\nalso, is Aimée.... Two little ones with the same name.”",
        "With a slight, vexed laugh, as one despairing of understanding, the\npasha turned to McLean. “Your young friend, monsieur, is uninformed\nthat Turkish children have many names.... After the loss of the\nelder we called the little one by the same name.... I trust I have\nmade everything perfectly clear to you?”",
        "“As crystal,” said McLean politely.",
        "“As lightning,” said Jack Ryder hotly, striding down the street. “It\nwas a flash of invention, that yarn. When I spoke about the\nquestions raised by his marriage the old fox sniffed the wind and\nwas afraid of trouble–he decided on the instant that no future\nfortune was worth interference with his plans, and he cut the ground\nfrom under our feet.... Lord, what a lie!”",
        "“Masterly, you must admit.”",
        "“Oh, I admired the beggar, even while I choked on it. But\nfever–desert burial–two Aimées! And the sentimental face he\npulled–he ought to have had a spot-light and wailing woodwinds.”",
        "McLean chuckled.",
        "“I’ll believe anything of him now,” Ryder rushed on. “I’ll bet he\nmurdered Delcassé and kidnapped the mother–and now he is selling\ntheir daughter–”",
        "“I fancy murder’s a bit beyond our Tewfick. That’s too thick. He’s\nprobably telling the truth there–he may never have known Delcassé.\nAnd as for the widow–she must have been in no end of trouble with a\ndead man and a wrecked expedition and a baby on her hands, and\nTewfick may have offered himself as a grateful solution to her.\nYou’d be surprised at the things I’ve heard. And if she looked like\nher picture Tewfick probably laid himself out to be lovely to\nher.... I rather like the chap, myself.”",
        "“I love him,” Ryder snorted. “The infernal liar–”",
        "“Steady now–suppose it’s all the truth? Nothing impossible to it.\nFact is, I rather believe it,” said McLean imperturbably. “It hangs\ntogether. If this girl you met thinks she’s his daughter, that’s\nconclusive. She’d have some idea–servants’ gossip or family\nwhisperings.... And why should he have brought her up as his own?”",
        "“No other children. And he’d grown fond of her, of course. If you\ncould see her!” retorted Ryder.",
        "“Just as well, I can’t.... And I think he could hardly have kept her\nin the dark.... We’d better call it a wild goose chase and say the\nman’s telling the truth.”",
        "“If this girl were his daughter she couldn’t be more than fourteen\nyears old. And I’ve seen the girl and she’s eighteen if she’s a\nday–you might take her for twenty. Fourteen!” said Ryder in\nrepudiating scorn.",
        "Hesitating McLean murmured something about the early maturity of the\nnatives.",
        "“Natives?” Ryder flung angrily back. “This girl’s French!”",
        "“As far as we are concerned, Jack, this girl is Turkish–and\nfourteen.... We can’t get around that, and you had better not forget\nit,” his friend quietly advised. “We’ve done everything that we can\nand there is no use working yourself up.... If anybody’s to blame in\nthis business, I don’t think it’s Tewfick–he’s done the handsome\nthing by her–but the fool Frenchman who took his baby and his wife\ninto the desert, and it’s too late to rag him. Cheer up, old top,\nand forget it. There’s nothing more to be done.”",
        "It was sound advice, Jack Ryder knew it. They had done all that they\ncould. McLean had been a brick. There remained nothing now but to\nnotify the Delcassé aunt that Tewfick Pasha claimed the child.",
        "“And I’ve a notion, Jack,” said McLean thoughtfully, “that he might\nnot have done that if you hadn’t rushed him so, trying to break off\nthe marriage. That was what frightened him.”",
        "“I thought you said she was his own daughter,” Ryder responded\nindignantly, and to that McLean merely murmured, “She will be now,\nto all time.”",
        "It was a haunting thought. It left Ryder with the bitter taste of\nblame in his mouth, the gall and wormwood of blame and a baffled\ndefeat.",
        "But for that sense of blame he might have taken McLean’s advice. He\nmight–but for that–have gone the way of wisdom, and accepted the\ninevitable.",
        "As it was, he did none of these things.",
        "He said to himself that all that he could do now–and the least that\nhe could do–was to let the girl know as much of the story as he\nknew and draw her own conclusions. Then, if she wanted to go on and\nsacrifice herself for Tewfick, very well. That was none of his\naffair.",
        "But she had a right to the truth and to the chance of choice.",
        "He did not know what he could do, but secretly and defiantly he\npromised himself that he would do something, and in the back of his\nmind an idea was already taking shape. It was manifest in the\ntenacity with which he refused to send the locket to the Delcassés.\nHe had the case and the miniature photographed very carefully by the\nman who did the reproductions for museum illustrations, and he sent\nthat, conscious of McLean’s silent thought that he was cherishing\nthe portrait for a sentimental memory.",
        "But he had other plans for it.",
        "He did not return to his diggings. He sent a message to the deserted\nThatcher, faking errands in Cairo, and he took a room at the hotel\nwhere Jinny Jeffries–now up the Nile–had stayed. He spent a great\ndeal of time evenings in the hotel garden, staring over the brick\nwalls to the tops of distant palms beyond, and not infrequently he\nslipped out the garden’s back door and wandered up and down the dark\ncanyon of a lane.",
        "He might as well have walked up and down the veranda of Shepheard’s\nHotel.",
        "And yet the girl had her key. She could get away if she wanted to\nand she might want to if she knew the truth.",
        "But how to get that truth to her? That was his problem. A dozen\nplans he considered and rejected. There were the mails–simple and\nobvious channel–but he had a strong idea that maidens in Mohammedan\nseclusion do not receive their letters directly. And now,\nespecially, Tewfick would be on his guard.",
        "Then there was the chance of a message through some native’s hands.\nThe house servants–? There were hours, one day, when Ryder\nsauntered about the streets, covertly eyeing the baggy-trousered\nsais who stood holding a horse in the sun or the tattered baker’s\nboy, approaching the entrance with his long loaves upon his head,\nbut Ryder’s Arabic was not of a power or subtlety to corrupt any\ncreature, and he stayed his tongue.",
        "Bitterly he regretted his wasted years. If he had not misspent them\nin godly living he would now be upon such terms of intimacy with\nsome official’s pretty wife who had the entrée to a pasha’s daughter\nthat she could be induced to make use of it for him.",
        "Desperately he thought of remedying this defect. There were several\ncharming young matrons not averse to devoted young men, but the time\nwas short for establishing those confidential relations which were\nwhat he required now.",
        "Jinny Jeffries would do it for him if she could, but Jinny would not\nreturn for another week. And if she changed her mind and took the\nboat back–as he, alack! had advised–instead of the express, then\nshe would be longer.",
        "And meanwhile the days were passing, four of them now since he and\nMcLean had heard the Soudanese locking the door behind them.",
        "There seemed nothing for it but to trust to that idea which had been\nslowly shaping in his mind.",
        "A WEDDING PRESENT",
        "In a room high in the palace a young girl was trying on a frock.\nBefore a tall pier glass she stood indifferently, one hip sagging to\nthe despair of the kneeling seamstress, her face turned listlessly\nfrom the image in the glass.",
        "Through the open window, banded with three bars, she looked into the\nrustling tops of palms, from which the yellow date fruit hung, and\nbeyond the palms the hot, bright, blue sky and the far towers of a\nminaret.",
        "“A bit more to the left, h’if you please, miss,” the woman entreated\nthrough a mouthful of pins, and apathetically the young figure\nmoved.",
        "“A bit of h’all right, now, that drape,” the woman chirped, sitting\nback on her heels to survey her work.",
        "She was an odd gnome-like figure, with a sharp nose on one side of\nher head and an outstanding knob of hair on the other. Into that\nknob the thin locks were so tightly strained that her pointed\nfeatures had an effect of popping out of bondage.",
        "She was London born, brought out by an English official’s wife as\ndressmaker to the children, remaining in Cairo as wife of a British\ncorporal. Since no children had resulted to require her care and\nthe corporal maintained his distaste for thrift, Mrs. Hendricks had\nresumed her old trade, and had become a familiar figure to many\nfashionable Turkish harems, slipping in and out morning and evening,\nsewing busily away behind the bars upon frocks that would have\ngraced a court ball, and lunching in familiar sociability with the\nfamily, sometimes having a bey or a captain or a pasha for a\nvis-à-vis when the men in the family dropped in for luncheon.",
        "As the girl did not turn her head she looked for approbation to the\nthird person in the room, a tall, severely handsome Frenchwoman in\nblack, whose face had the beauty of chiseled marble and the same\nquality of cold perfection. This was Madame de Coulevain, teacher of\nFrench and literature to the jeunes filles of Cairo, former\ngoverness of Aimée, returned now to her old room in the palace for\nthe wedding preparations.",
        "There was history behind madame’s sculptured face. In an incredibly\nimpulsive youth she had fled from France with a handsome captain of\nAlgerian dragoons; after a certain matter at cards he had ceased to\nbe a captain and became petty official in a Cairo importing house;\nlater yet, he became an invalid.",
        "Life, for the Frenchwoman, was a matter of paying for her husband’s\nillness, then for his funeral expenses, and then of continuing to\npay for the little one which the climate had required them to send\nto a convent in France.",
        "There was, at first, the hope of reunion, extinguished by each\nadded year. What could madame, unknown, unfriended, unaccredited,\naccomplish in France? The mere getting there was impossible–the\nlittle one required so much. Her daughter was no dependent upon\ncharity. And in Cairo madame had a clientèle, she commanded a price.\nAnd so for the child’s sake she taught and saved, concentrating now\nupon a dot, and feeding her heart with the dutifully phrased letters\narriving each week of the years, and the occasional photographs of\nan ever-growing, unknown young creature.",
        "It was to madame’s care that Aimée had been given when the\nmotherless girl had grown beyond old Miriam’s ministrations, and for\nnearly nine years in the palace madame had maintained her courteous\nand tactful supervision. Indeed, it was only this last year that\nmadame had undertaken new relations with the world outside,\nperceiving that Aimée would not longer require her.",
        "“Excellent,” she said now in her careful, unfamiliar English to Mrs.\nHendricks, and in French to Aimée she added, with a hint of\nasperity, “Do give her a word. She is trying to please you.”",
        "“It is very nice, Mrs. Hendricks,” said the girl dutifully, bringing\nher glance back from that far sky.",
        "The little seamstress was instantly all vivacity. “H’and now for the\nsash–shall we ’ave it so–or so?” she demanded, attaching the wisp\nof tulle experimentally.",
        "“As you wish it.... It is very nice,” Aimée repeated vaguely. She\npicked up a bit of the shimmering stuff and spread it curiously\nacross her fingers. A dinner gown.... When she wore this she would\nbe a wife.... The wife of Hamdi Bey.... A shiver went through her\nand she dropped the tulle swiftly.",
        "In ten days more....",
        "Gone was her first rush of sustaining compassion. Gone was her\nfear for her father and her tenderness to him. Only this numb\ncoldness, this dumb, helpless certainty of a destiny about to be\naccomplished.... Only this hopeless, useless brooding upon that\nstrange brief past.",
        "There was a stir at the door and on her shuffling, slippered feet\nold Miriam entered, handing some packages to Madame de Coulevain.\nThen she turned to revolve about the bright figure of her young\nmistress, her eyes glistening fondly, her dark fingers touching a\nsoft fold of silver ribbon, while under her breath she chanted in a\ncroon like a lullaby, “Beautiful as the dawn ... she will walk upon\nthe heart of her husband with foot of rose petals ... she will\ndazzle him with the beams of her eyes and with the locks of her\nhair, she will bind him to her ... beautiful as the dawn....”",
        "It was the marriage chant of Miriam’s native village, an old love\nsong that had come down the wind of centuries.",
        "Mrs. Hendricks, thrusting in the final pins, paid not the slightest\nattention and Madame de Coulevain displayed interest only in the\npackages. If she saw the stiffening of the girl’s face and the rigid\naversion of her eyes from the old nurse’s adulation she gave no\nsign.",
        "Towards Aimée’s moods madame preserved a calm and sensible\ndetachment. Never had she invited confidence, and for all the young\ngirl’s charm she had never taken her to her heart in the place of\nthat absent daughter. As if jealously she had held herself aloof\nfrom such devotion.",
        "Perhaps in Aimée’s indulged and petted childhood, with a fond pasha\nextolling her small triumphs, her dances, her score at tennis at the\nlegation, madame found a bitter contrast to the lot of that lonely\nchild in France. Certainly there was nothing in Aimée’s life then to\ninvite compassion, and later, during those hard, mutinous months of\nthe girl’s first veiling and seclusion, she had not tried to soften\nthe inevitable for her with a useless compassion.",
        "So now, perceiving this marriage as one more step in the\nirresistible march of destiny for her charge, she overlooked the\nyouthful fretting and offered the example of her own unmoved\nacceptance.",
        "“What diamonds!” she said now admiringly, holding up a pin, and,\nexamining the card. “From Seniha Hanum–the cousin of Hamdi Bey.”",
        "A moment more she held up the pin but the girl would not give it a\nlook.",
        "“And this, from the same jeweler’s,” continued madame, while the\ndressmaker was unfastening the frock, aided by Miriam, anxious that\nno scratch should mar that milk-white skin.",
        "“How droll–the box is wrapped in cloth, a cloth of plaid.”",
        "Aimée spun about. The dress fell, a glistening circle at her feet,\nand with regardless haste she tripped over it to madame.",
        "“How–strange!” she said breathlessly.",
        "A plaid ... A Scotch plaid. Memories of an erect, tartan-draped\nyoung figure, of a thin, bronzed face and dark hair where a tilted\ncap sat rakishly ... memories of smiling, boyish eyes, darkening\nwith sudden emotion ... memories of eager lips....",
        "She took the box from madame. Within the cloth lay a jeweler’s case\nand within the case a locket of heavily ornamented gold.",
        "Her heart beating, she opened it. For a moment she did not\nunderstand. Her own face–her own face smiling back. Yet unfamiliar,\nthat oddly piled hair, that black velvet ribbon about the throat....",
        "Murmuring, madame shared her wonder.",
        "It was Miriam’s cry of recognition that told them.",
        "“Thy mother–the grace of Allah upon her!–It is thy mother! Eh,\nthose bright eyes, that long, dark hair that I brushed the many hot\nnights upon the roof!”",
        "“But you are her image, Aimée,” murmured the Frenchwoman, but half\nunderstanding the nurse’s rapid gutturals, and then, “Your father’s\ngift?”",
        "With the box in her hands the girl turned from them, fearful of the\ntell-tale color in her cheeks. “But whose else–his thought, of\ncourse,” she stammered.",
        "That plaid was warning her of mystery.",
        "The dressmaker was creating a diversion. Leaving, she wished to\nconsult about the purchases for to-morrow’s work, and madame moved\ntowards the hall with her, talking in her careful English, while\nMiriam bent towards the dropped finery.",
        "Aimée slipped through another door, into the twilight of her\nbedroom, whose windows upon the street were darkened by those\nfine-wrought screens of wood. Swiftly she thrust the box from sight,\ninto the hollow in the mashrubiyeh made in old days to hold a water\nbottle where it could be cooled by breezes from the street.",
        "Leaning against the woodwork, her fingers curving through the tiny\nopenings, she stared toward the west. The sky was flushing. Broken\nby the circles, the squares, the minute interstices of the\nmashrubiyeh, she saw the city taking on the hues of sunset.",
        "Suddenly the cry of a muezzin from a nearby minaret came rising and\nfalling through the streets.",
        "“_La illahé illallah Mohammedun Ressoulallah–”",
        "The call swelled and died away and rose again ... There is no God\nbut the God and Mahomet is the Prophet of God ... From farther\ntowers it sounded, echoing and re-echoing, vibrant, insistent,\nfalling upon crowded streets, penetrating muffling walls.",
        "“_La illahé illallah–”",
        "In the avenue beneath her two Arabs, leading their camels to market,\nwere removing their shoes and going through the gestures of\nceremonial washing with the dust of the street.",
        "“_La illahé–”",
        "The city was ringing with it.",
        "The seamstress and the Frenchwoman, still talking, had passed down\nthe hall. In the next room Miriam’s lips were moving in pious\ntestimony.",
        "“_Ech hedu en la illahé–! I testify that there is no God but theGod.”",
        "In the street the Arabs were bowing towards the east, their heads\ntouching the earth.",
        "And in the window above them a girl was reading a note.",
        "The last call of the muezzin, falling from the tardy towers of Kait\nBey drifted faintly through the colored air. With resounding whacks\nthe Arabs were urging on their beast; Miriam, her prayers concluded,\nwas shaking out silks and tulle with a sidelong glance for that\nstill figure in the next room, pressing so close against the\nguarding screens.",
        "She could not see the pallor in the young face. She could not see\nthe tumult in the dark eyes. She could not see the note, crushed\nconvulsively against the beating breast, in the fingers which so few\nmoments ago had drawn it from the hiding place in the box.",
        "Ryder had not dared a personal letter. But clearly, and distinctly,\nhe stated the story of the Delcassés. He gave the facts which the\npasha admitted and the ingenious explanation of the two Aimées. And\nfor reference he gave the address of the Delcassé aunt and agent in\nFrance and of Ryder and McLean at the Agricultural Bank.",
        "The pasha did not dine with his daughter that night. He had been\navoiding her of late, a natural reaction from the strain of\ntoo-excessive gratitude. A man cannot be continually humble before\nthe young! And it was no pleasure to be reminded by her candid eyes\nof his late misfortunes and of her absurd reluctance towards\nmatrimony.",
        "As if this marriage were not the best thing for her! As if it were a\nhardship! To make sad eyes and draw a mouth because one is to be the\nwife of a rich general.... Irrational ... The little sweetmeat was\nirritating.",
        "To this point Tewfick’s buoyancy had brought him, and all the more\nhastily because of his eagerness to escape the pangs of that\nuncomfortable self-reproach. To Aimée, in her new clear-sightedness\nof misery, it was bitterly apparent that he was reconciled with her\nlot and careless of it.",
        "So blinded had been her young affection that it was a hard\nawakening, and she was too young, too cruelly involved, to feel for\nhis easy humors that amused tolerance of larger acquaintance with\nhuman nature. She had grown swiftly bitter and resentful, and deeply\ncold.",
        "And now this letter. It dazed her, like a flame of lightning before\nher eyes, and then, like lightning, it lit up the world with\nterrifying luridity. Fiery colored, unfamiliar, her life trembled\nabout her.",
        "Truth or lies? Custom and habit stirred incredulously to reject the\nsupposition. The romance, the adventure of youth, dared its swift\nacceptance. How could she know? Intuitively she shrank from any\nquestion to the pasha, realizing the folly and futility of exposing\nher suspicion. If he needed to lie, lie he would–and in her\nunderstanding of that, she read her own acceptance of the\npossibility of his needing to lie.",
        "Madame de Coulevain? Madame had never known her mother. Only old\nMiriam had known her mother and Miriam was the pasha’s slave. But\nthe old woman was unsuspecting now, and full of disarming comfort in\nthis marriage of her wild darling.",
        "Through dinner she planned the careless-seeming questions. And then\nin her negligée, as the old nurse brushed out her hair for the\nnight, “Dadi,” said the girl, in a faint voice, “am I truly like my\nmother?” and when Miriam had finished her fond protestation that\nthey were as like as two roses, as two white roses, bloom and bud,\nshe launched that little cunning phrase on which she had spent such\neager hoping.",
        "“And was I like her when I was little–when first she came to my\nfather?”",
        "“Eh–yes. Always thou wast the tiny image which Allah–Glory to his\nName!–had made of her,” came the nurse’s assurance.",
        "“I am glad,” said Aimée, in a trembling voice.",
        "She dared not press that more. Confronted with her unconscious\nadmission the old woman would destroy it, feigning some evasion. But\nthere it was, for as much as it was worth....",
        "Presently then, she found another question to slip into the old\nwoman’s narrative of the pasha’s grief.",
        "“Eh, to hear a man weep,” Miriam was murmuring. “Her beauty had set\nits spell upon him, and–”",
        "“And he lost her so soon. Three or four years only, was it not,\"\nventured Aimée, “that they had of life together?”",
        "It seemed that Miriam’s brush missed a stroke.",
        "“Years I forget,” the nurse muttered, “but tears I remember,” and\nshe began to talk of other things.",
        "But it seemed to Aimée that she had answered. As for that other\nmatter, of the dead Delcassé child, she dared not refer to it, lest\nMiriam tell the pasha. But how many times, she remembered, had she\nbeen told that she was her mother’s only one!",
        "Yet, oh, to know, to hear all the story, to learn Ryder’s discovery\nof it! It was all as strange and startling as a tale of Djinns. And\nthe life that it held out to her, the enchanted hope of freedom, of\naid–Oh, not again would she refuse his aid!",
        "She had no plans, no purposes. But that night over her\nhastily-donned frock she slipped the black street mantle and when at\nlast, after endless waiting, the murmuring old palace was safely\nstill and dark, she stole down the spiral stair and gained the\ngarden. And then, a phantom among its shadows, she fled to the rose\nbushes by the gate.",
        "Breathlessly she knelt and dug into the hiding place of that gate’s\nkey. To the furthest corner her fingers explored the hole, pushing\nfuriously against the earth. And then she drew back her hand and\ncrushed it against her face to check the nervous sobs.",
        "The hole was empty. The key was gone.",
        "THE RECEPTION",
        "In Tewfick Pasha’s harem everything was astir.",
        "It was the morning of the marriage, almost the very hour when the\nwedding cortège would bear the bride from her father’s home to the\nhouse of her husband.",
        "The invited guests were already arrived and streaming through the\nreception rooms, a bright, feminine tide in evening toilettes,\nsurrounding the exhibited gifts or pausing about tables of cool\nsyrups, and their soft, low voices, the delicious musical tones of\nhighbred Turkish women, rose like a murmuring of somnolent bees to\nthe tenser regions about, tightening the excitement of haste.",
        "The bride was not yet ready. Still and white, she was the only image\nof calm in that fluttering, confusing room. Her nearer friends were\nhovering about her, and her maids of honor, two charming little\nTurks in rose robes, were draping her veil while old Miriam,\nresplendent in green and silver, endeavored jealously to outmaneuver\nthem.",
        "On her knees, the gnome-like Mrs. Hendricks was adding an orange\nblossom to the laces on the train. Then she sat back on her heels,\nher head a-tilt like a curious bird’s, her eyes beaming\nsentimentally upon the bride.",
        "“The prettiest h’I h’ever did see,” she pronounced with\nsatisfaction, “H’as pretty as a wax figger now–h’only a thought\ntoo waxy.”",
        "And like a wax figure indeed, immobile, rigid, the bride was\nstanding before them, arrayed at last in the shimmering white of the\nsweeping satin, overrich of lace and orange flowers, and shrouded in\nthe clouding waves of her veil. White as her robes, pale as death\nand as still, the girl looked out at them, and only that sick pallor\nof her face and the glitter of her dark eyes betrayed the tumult\nwithin.",
        "“Your diadem, my dear–you are keeping us attending,” came Madame de\nCoulevain’s voice from the door.",
        "The diadem, that heavy circlet of brilliants which crowned the\nEastern bride in place of the orange wreath of Western convention,\nmust not be touched by the bride’s fingers but placed by one of her\nfriends, married and married but once, and exceptionally happy in\nthat marriage.",
        "Ghul-al-Din, Aimée’s selection from her friends, stepped hastily\nforward now, a soft, dimpled, slow-smiling girl, her eyes drowsy\nwith domesticity. No question of Ghul-al-Din’s happiness! She\nextolled her husband, a young captain of cavalry, and she adored her\ninfant son, a prodigy among children. Life for her was a rosy,\nunquestioning absorption.",
        "A shaft of irony sped through Aimée, as she bent her head for its\ncrowning at this young wife’s hands, and received the ceremonial\nwishes for her crowning of happiness, a crowning occurring but once\nin her lifetime. Irony was the only salvation for the hour; without\nthat outlet for her tortured spirit she felt she would grow suddenly\nmad, hysterical and babbling or passionate and wild.",
        "So many moods had stormed through her since that night when she had\nfound all hope of rescue gone with her lost key! So many impulses\nseethed frantically now beneath her quiet, as she faced for the last\ntime that white-misted image in the glass. She had a furious longing\nto tear off that diadem and veil and heavy robe, to scatter the\nornaments and drive out all those maddening spectators, all those\ninterested, eager, unknowing, uncaring spectators of her\nhumiliation.",
        "Arranging her veil, draping her satins, as if gauze and silk were\nall that mattered to this hour! Wishing her happiness–as if\nhappiness could ever be hers now for the wishing! Smiling,\nfluttering, complimenting, lending to the ghastly sacrifice the\nfamiliar acceptances of every day....",
        "If only she could wake from this nightmare and find that it was all\na dream. If only she could brush this confusion from her senses and\nfrom her heart its dumb terrors.... If only she had the courage for\nsome desperate revolt, some outburst of strength–",
        "“I am ready,” she said faintly, turning from the glass, and moved\ntowards the door, while a young eunuch bent for her train, that\ntrain of three yards length, which stretched so regally behind her\nin her slow descent of the stairs.",
        "In the French drawing-room below her father was waiting for the\nceremonial farewell, in which the father received the daughter’s\nthanks for all his care of her.",
        "Mechanically Aimée advanced. She stood before him, she lifted her\neyes–and there passed from them a look of such strange, breathless,\nquestioning intensity that it was like something palpable.... She\nhad not foreseen this, sudden crisping of her nerves, this defiant\npassion of her spirit....",
        "Her father? Was he her father? Was it a father who had sold her so,\ncareless, callous–or was it only a father’s semblance, and did\nthere lie in the background of those petted, childish years some\ndarker shadow, of a tragedy that had wrecked her mother’s life and\nbroken her heart–?",
        "Like flashing light that look passed between them. It penetrated\nTewfick’s nonchalant guard and brought the unaccustomed color to his\nolive cheeks. His handsome eyes turned uneasily aside. A girl’s\npique perhaps, at the situation, her last defiance of his\npower,–but for all his reassurance there was something deeper in\nthat look, something tenable, accusing, which went into his soul.",
        "It was a moment in which the last cord of their relationship was\nsevered forever.",
        "She did not speak a word. She bent, not to kiss his hand as custom\ndictated, but to sweep a long, slow courtesy, that salutation of a\nmaid of spirit to a conqueror, a bending of the pliant back, but\nwith the head held high and the spirit unsurrendered.",
        "And yet there was wretchedness in those proud eyes and a blind fear\nand supplication.",
        "Useless to beg now. She knew it, and yet the eyes implored.",
        "And then she smiled. And before that smile Tewfick faltered in his\npaternal benediction and hastened the phrases.",
        "Little murmurs flew back and forth as she turned away, and then a\nhasty chatter sprang up as the guests hurried into their tcharchafs\nfor the journey to the bridegroom’s house.",
        "That day Aimée did not put on her veil. On either side of her, as\nshe went out her father’s gate, huge negroes held up silken walls of\ndamask, and between those walls she walked into the carriage that\nawaited her, followed by Madame de Coulevain and the two little\nmaids of honor.",
        "It was when the carriage began to move that the panic inside of her\ngrew to whirlwind. The horse’ hoofs, trotting, trotting, the motion\nof the wheels, seemed to be the onbearing rush of fate itself. If\nshe could only stop it! If she could only cry out, tear open the\nwindows, scream to the passers by. She knew these were only the\nimpotent visions of hysteria, but she indulged them pitifully.",
        "She saw herself, in those moments, helpless, and hopeless, passing\non into the slavery of this marriage–Aimée, no longer the daughter\nof Tewfick Pasha, but Aimée Delcassé, child of a dead Frenchman,\ninheritor of freedom, sold like any dancing girl....",
        "And her own lips had assented. In the supreme, silly uselessness of\nsacrifice she had given herself for the safety of that man who had\nspent such careless indulgence upon her ... that man whom perhaps\nher mother had loved and perhaps had hated....",
        "Faster and faster the horses were trotting, leading the long file of\ncarriages and impatient motors that bore the relatives and guests\nand trousseau, rolling on under the lebbeks and sycamores of the\nwide Shubra Avenue, once the delight of fashionables before the\nGezireh Drive had drained it of its throngs and its prestige.",
        "Now some bright-eyed urchins ran out from their games in the dust to\ncurious attention, and through a half open gate Aimée caught once a\nglimpse of a young, unveiled girl watching eagerly from the tangled\ngreens and ruined statuary of an old garden. Farther on came\nglimpses of farm lands, the wheat rising in bright spears, and of\nwell-wooded heights and in the distance the white houses of\nDemerdache against the Gibel Achmar beyond.",
        "But where were they bearing her? Aimée had a despairing sense of\ndistance and desolation as the carriage turned again–Abdullah, the\ncoachman, having traversed unnecessary miles to gratify his pride\nbefore the house of his parents–and made a zigzag way towards the\nriver, where old palaces rose from the backwaters, their faces\nhidden by high walls or covered with heavy vines and moss.",
        "Deeper and deeper grew the girl’s dismay. It was a different world\nfrom that bright, modern Cairo that she knew; this was as remote\nfrom her daily life as the old streets of Al Raschid. Her thoughts\nflew forward to that unknown lord, that Hamdi Bey, whose image she\nhad refused to assemble to her consciousness. Now she comforted her\nterror with a sudden assumption of age and dignity and kindness, of\na courtesy that would protect her and a deference that would assuage\nthe horror of a life together, when unknown, fearful familiarities\nwould alone vibrate in the empty monotonies.",
        "Before a high wall the carriage had stopped. A huge, repellent\nEthiopian was standing before an opened doorway, through which a\nrich carpet was spread.",
        "“Ah, but he looks like an ogre, that new eunuch of yours, Aimée,\"\nmurmured one of the little Turks. The other, more touched with\nthought, gave her a disturbed glance, and laughed in nervousness.",
        "Madame, alone serene, ignored the dismaying impression.",
        "“The palace is of a fine, ancient beauty, I am told,” she mentioned\ncheerfully.",
        "For one wild instant Aimée thought to plead with her, to implore her\nto tell Abdullah to drive on, to give her the freedom of flight, if\nonly flight down those deserted streets. And then a mad vision of\nherself in her bridal robes in flight, brought the hysterical\nlaughter to her throat. The time for flight had gone by ... And as\nfor madame’s pity on her–this was not the first time that Aimée had\nthought of invoking her aid, but she had always known, too well,\nthat thought’s supreme futility.",
        "Sympathetic as Madame de Coulevain might be in her inmost heart–and\nAimée divined in her an understanding pity for the necessities of\nexistence–never would that sympathy betray her to rashness. She\nnever would believe that in serving Aimée she would not be ruining\nher; and even if assured of Aimée’s safety, she could never be\nbrought to betray her own reputation for truthworthiness among the\nharems of Cairo.... As well appeal to the rocks of the Mokattam\nhills.",
        "The carriage stopped. The negroes extended the damask walls, and one\nsprang to open the carriage door and bear the bride’s train. In one\nmoment’s parting of the silken walls the girl saw a sun-flooded\ncluster of staring faces, thronging for her arrival, and then the\ndamask intervened and through its lane, followed by her duenna and\nher maids of honor, she entered the arched doorway.",
        "She was in a garden, a great gloomy place, over-spread with ancient,\nmoss-encrusted trees. A broken, marble fountain flung up waters into\nwhich no sunlight flashed, and the heavy stepping stones, leading to\nit, were buried in untrodden grass. A garden in which no one\nlingered.",
        "The Ethiopian was marshaling them to the left, to an entrance in the\ndark palace walls before them. Behind them the oncoming guests were\nstreaming out in veiled procession.",
        "He opened a door. Ancient, beautiful arches framed a long vestibule\nand against a background of profuse cut flowers a man’s figure\nstepped forward in the glittering uniform of the Sultan’s guard.\nAimée had a confused impression of a thin, meager, dandified figure\nwith a waspish waist ... of a blond mustache with upstanding ends\n... of sallow cheek-bones and small, light eyes smiling at her in a\nstrained, eager curiosity....",
        "Through all her sinking dismay she had a flash of clear,\nenlightening irony at that look’s suspense. If she were not as\nrepresented! If his cousin’s fervor had misled his hope–!",
        "But in that instant’s encounter his eyes cleared to triumph and\ngayety, and he smiled–a smile curiously feline, ironic, for all its\nintended ingratiation–a conqueror’s smile, winged to reassure and\nmelt.",
        "He stepped forward. There were formal words of welcome to which she\nreturned a speechless bow, and then he offered his arm and conducted\nher slowly up the stairs, his sword rattling in its scabbard, to the\napartment which was to be her home, and the prison for the spirit\nand the body.",
        "She knew in a moment that she hated this man and that he inspired\nher with fear and horror.",
        "Across a long expanse of drawing-room he conducted her to the\nancient marriage throne upon its platform, surmounted by a pompous\ncrown from which old, embroidered silks hung heavily.",
        "Then with an unheard phrase, and another bow, he left her to the\nday-long ordeal of the reception while he withdrew to his own\nentertainment at her father’s house. She would not see him again\nuntil night, when he would pay her a call of ceremony.",
        "She saw his figure hesitating a moment, as he faced the oncoming\nguests, such a flood of femininity, unmantled now and unveiled,\nsparkling in rainbow hues of silks and tulle and gauze that he had\nnever before faced and never would again. Like a bright wave the\nthrong closed about him and then surged on towards the bride upon\nthe throne.",
        "How often, in the last years, Aimée had pitied that poor puppet of a\nbride, stuck there like some impaled, winged creature, helpless for\nflight, to the exhibition of the long stream of passersby! How often\nshe had promised herself that never would this be her fate, never\nwould she be given to an unknown! And now–",
        "She was smiling as she faced them, that light, fixed smile she had\nseen so often on others’ lips, the smile of pride trying desperately\nto hide its wounds from the penetrating glances of the curious.\nSatiric, cynical, or sympathetic, that light smile defied them all,\nbut beneath its guard she felt she was slowly bleeding to death of\nsome mortal hurt.",
        "The sympathy unconsciously betrayed, was hardest. The whispers of\nher young maids of honor, “Really, Aimée, he looks so young! One\nwould never surmise,” were more galling in their intended\nconsolation, more revealing in their betrayal of her friends’ own\nshrinking from that arrogant, dandified old man than the barbed dart\nof the uncaring, inquisitive, “How do you find him, my dear? He has\nthe reputation for conquest!”",
        "They were all there, her friends, young, slim, modish Turkish girls\nwhose time had not yet come, glancing quizzically about the ancient\ndrawing room, with its solid side of mashrubiyeh, its old wall\npanelings of carvings and rare inlay, and then pointing their\nglances back at her, as if to ask, “And is this our revoltée? Is\nthis her end, in this dim, old palace among the ghosts of the past?”",
        "Some, the frankest, murmured, “But why did you not refuse?” and\nothers attempted consolation with a light, “As well the first as the\nlast–since we must all come to it.”",
        "Of the married women there were those who raised blank, bitter eyes\nto her, and others, more mild, romantic, affectionate, tried to\ninfuse encouragement into their smiles as if they said,\n\"Come–courage–it’s not so bad. And what would you? We are women,\nafter all; we do not need so much for happiness.",
        "“Those dreams of yours for love, for a spirit to delight in your\nspirit in place of a master delighting in your beauty alone, what\nare they, those dreams, but the childish stuff of fancies? For other\nraces, perhaps–but for you, take hold of life. There are realities\nyet in it to bring you joy.”",
        "It was all in their eyes, their voices, their intonations, their\npressure of her hands.",
        "And she stood there among them all, smiling always that smile\ndemanded of the bride, looking unseeingly into their eyes, listening\nunhearingly to the sea of voices breaking on her ears, responding in\nvague monosyllables and a wider smile, while all the time her eyes\nsaw only that face, that smirking, cynical old face, and the tide of\nterror rose higher and higher in her soul.",
        "Never had she given way to her fear, never since the black night\nwhen she found the key was gone.",
        "Then, after frenzied searching in impossible places she had stolen\nback to her room and buried her face in her pillow to stifle the\nbreaking sobs of rebellion and despair–and of a longing so deep and\nso terrible that it seemed to rend her with a physical anguish, a\npain so fiery that her heart would forever bear the scar.",
        "Never again would she see him now.... Never would she know–never\nwould she know all. She had refused his aid. And he might believe\nher still aloof, incredulous.... It was finished–forever and ever.",
        "She had told herself that before. But always there had been the key.\nAnd now there was no key and no escape and her heart broke itself\nagainst the iron of necessity.",
        "She had cried the night through. Morning had brought her exhaustion,\nnot peace but a despairing submission. Why struggle when the prison\ngate is shut? And if there was never to be freedom for her ... never\nagain the sight of that too-remembered face and the sound of that\nvoice–why, then, as well one fate as another. And it was too late\nnow to recede.",
        "So she had called upon her pride and summoned her spirit to play its\npart to protect her from whispers, and surmise and half-contemptuous\npity. She would surrender to this man because she must, and she\nwould win his respect by her dignity and worth, but her soul she\nwould keep its own, in its unsullied dreams ... and in its\nmemories.... Life would be nothing but a hardship, nobly borne.",
        "But now she had seen the man. Now this wild dislike, this sickening\nterror.",
        "To be alone with him, to have only the few days grace of courtship\nwhich the Mohammadan custom imposes upon the bridegroom, to be\nforever at his mercy in this solitary palace, with its echoing\ncorridors, its blackened walla, its damp breath of age....",
        "She thought wildly of death.",
        "And all the time she was smiling, bending her cheek to the kiss of a\nfriend, feeling the fingers of some well-wisher press upon her,\nlistening to praises of her beauty....",
        "For she was beautiful. No image of wax now. The scarlet of her\nfrightened blood was staining her cheeks, her eyes were bright as\nthe jewels in her diadem, and beneath the thrown-back veil her dark\nhair revealed its lovely wealth.",
        "“Is she not a rose–will he not adore her, our Hamdi?” she heard\nthat stout cousin of Hamdi’s say to a companion, and the two stared\non appraisingly at the young girl, in her freshness and virginal\nyouth, as if at some toy to invite the jaded appetite of a satiated\nmaster.",
        "And still the throng filed by, a strange throng beneath the\nflickering light and shadow of the mashrubiyeh, slender young Turks\nor blonde Circassians in their Paris frocks, their eyes tormented or\nmalicious, and here and there, like a green island of calm, some\nrotund matron grave and serene, her head encircled with an old\nfashioned turban of gauze, her stout flesh encased in heavy silks,\nbought at Damask so as not to enrich the Unbelievers at Lyons.",
        "And then the spectacle changed, the black street mantles appeared,\nyashmaks and tcharchafs, for now the doors were opened to all the\nfeminine world, and there came strange, unknown women, slipping out\nfrom their grills for this pleasuring in a palace, old-timers often,\ndraped and turbaned in the fashion of some far province of their\nyouth; women, incredibly fat, in rich stuffs of Asia, their bright,\ndeep-sunken eyes spying delightedly upon the scene, or furtive, poor\nwomen, keeping courage in twos and threes.",
        "Now, too, at four, came the women from the Embassies, a Russian girl\nwith whom Aimée had played tennis in ages past, rosy now with\nyesterday’s sun and sleepy with last night’s dance, who touched the\nbride’s hand as if it were the hand of one half-dead, already\nconsigned to the tomb; other girls she did not know, who stared at\nher with the avid eyes of their young curiosities; older women,\nexperienced, unstirred, drinking their tea and smoking cigarettes\nand gossiping of their own affairs, and occasionally among them a\ntourist agog with wonder and exultation, storing away details for a\nlifetime of talk, asking amiably the most incredible questions....",
        "“And is it true you have never met your husband? Listen, Jane–she\nsays she has never met him–”",
        "A girl in a creamy white silk came forward a little uncertainly. She\nwas a pretty girl, with a curve of ruddy hair visible under her\nsmart straw, and very bright eyes, where shyness was at variance\nwith a friendly smile.",
        "Indeed Jinny Jeffries was extraordinarily intimidated by the\noccasion. She had a distinct sense of intrusion mingling with her\ndelight at having intruded, and she murmured her good wishes in an\nalmost inaudible tone.",
        "“It is very good of you to let us come ... I wish you every\nhappiness,” she said.",
        "Beside her a tall slender figure, in black tcharchaf and yashmak,\nmade its appearance.",
        "Aimée’s eyes slipped past the pretty American; the mechanical smile\nwas frozen on her lips. Over the black veil she saw the hazel eyes,\nbright with excitement, vivid as speech; the eyes of the masquerader\nin the Scotch costume, the eyes of the man at the garden gate–Jack\nRyder’s eyes ... the eyes of her dreams.",
        "THE FORTY DOORS",
        "When Ryder had despatched from the jeweler’s who had polished the\nlocket for him, that package with its secret note, and its warning\nplaid, he had no real assurance that the message would fall into\nAimée’s hands. But he could think of nothing better, and he argued\nvery favorably for his stratagem.",
        "That miniature should have some effect, and given the miniature, and\nthe bit of plaid cloth, Aimée’s quick wit ought to divine a message.",
        "She had always the key, he remembered, and the power of egress from\nher prison. And surely it ought not to be difficult for her to\ndevise some way of getting a letter into the post.",
        "So his hope fluctuated between the garden gate and the daily mail at\nthe Bank, and he rather surprised McLean by the frequency and\nbrevity of his visits, and by the duration of his stay in Cairo.",
        "For that he had an excuse, both to McLean and to the deserted\nThatcher, at the excavation camp, two excuses in fact–some belated\nidentification work to be done at the Museum and a cracked wisdom\ntooth.",
        "Chiefly he spoke of the necessity for dentistry and accounted for\nhis moods with his molar.",
        "Of moods he had many. Moods when he contemplated his behavior\nlightly and brightly or darkly, in unrelieved disgust, moods when he\nrefused to contemplate it at all. But he stayed. That was the\nconspicuous and enduring thing. He stayed.",
        "Jinny Jeffries returned from the Nile by express to find him\nensconced at her hotel, and her bright confidence suffered no\ndiminution of its self respect. And it was through Jinny that chance\nset another straw of circumstance dancing his way.",
        "Jinny had a frock she wished repaired. Mrs. Heath-Brown, whom she\nhad met upon the Nile, recommended to her a Mrs. Hendricks, wife of\na British soldier and a most clever little needle woman. Jinny\nlooked up Mrs. Hendricks and found it impossible to secure her for\nsome days as she was busy refitting for a fashionable wedding in the\nMohammedan world.",
        "A night later, and two nights before the wedding, Jinny made a\nnarrative of the circumstances for Jack Ryder’s benefit.",
        "“Such frocks h’as h’I ’ave to do–and the young lady no more\ncaring!” had been a saying of the Hendricks that Jinny passed\ninterestedly on to Jack. She had no memory of the young lady’s name,\nbut distinctly she recalled that she was young and beautiful and to\nmarry a general.",
        "It was enough to launch Jinny’s eager interest in Mohammedan\nmarriages and foster the wish that she might attend one. She\nregretted Mrs. Heath-Brown’s absence and her lack of acquaintance,\nand suggested that Jack ought to know some one–",
        "“Better than that, I’ll take you,” said Jack with a promptness\nthat brought a light to Miss Jeffries’ eyes.",
        "There was also a light in Jack Ryder’s eyes, a swift burning of\nexcitement and adventure.",
        "Why not? The thing was possible. Muffled in a tcharchaf and veiled\nwith a heavy yashmak, armed with enough Arabic for the briefest of\nencounters, he might dare the danger. Who in the world would\ndiscover him? Who would ever know?",
        "The thing was unthinkable. It was a desperate desecration,\ncomparable only, in his vague analogies, to the Mecca pilgrimage and\nprofanation of a Holy Tomb. But its very improbability would prevent\ndetection.",
        "Only Jinny had to keep her mouth extremely shut–before and\nafterwards.",
        "He impressed this upon her so thoroughly, as they did their shopping\nfor the costume together the next morning, that she had compunctious\nmoments of solicitude when she said he really ought not to.... She\nwould feel responsible....",
        "Thereupon he laughed, and dared her to be game, and she grew all\nmirthful confidence again.",
        "But that night, sitting alone in a native café over his Turkish\ncoffee, Ryder was grimly serious.",
        "He knew that it was a mad thing to do. He felt, not so much the\ndanger he ran from discovery, but the danger to his already\nshattered peace of mind from another glimpse of that strange girl\n... that young unknown, on whom he had spent such time and thought,\nof late, that she seemed a very part of his existence.",
        "What was the good of going to her wedding reception? Feebly he told\nhimself that it was his only chance to inform her upon the history\nof the Delcassés. There might have been reasons for her\nnon-appearance at the gate, for her not writing.... He could have no\nglimmering of what went on behind those barred windows. This was his\nonly chance–he meant to say, to tell her–but his eager senses\nmurmured, to see her again.",
        "That was it–to see her again. He owned the lure, at last, with a\nbitter ruefulness. But–he brightened up at that–it was partly his\nduty to himself. Now he had all sorts of fool imaginings about this\ngirl. He was remembering her as something lovelier than a Houri,\nmore enchanting than fairy magic, more sweet than spring. He owed it\nto himself to rout these imbecile prepossessions and prove clearly\nand dispassionately that the girl was just a very nice little girl,\na pretty bride, marrying into a very distinct life from his own–and\na girl with whom he would not have an idea in common. A girl, in\nfact, far inferior to any American. A girl not to be compared to\nJinny Jeffries.",
        "Besides, there was fun in the thing. It tempted him tremendously.\nIt was adventurous, romantic forbidden.",
        "He heard the word echoed in Turkish behind him.",
        "So engrossed in his thoughts had he been that he had been\ninattentive to the rhythm of old Khazib, the tale teller’s voice, as\nhe held forth, from the divan, beside his long-stemmed pipe, to his\nnightly audience, of men and boys, camel drivers, small merchants,\ndesert men from the long caravans who were the frequenters of this\ncafé.",
        "To-night there were few about the old man, and Ryder had small\ndifficulty in drawing nearer the circle. A green-turbaned Arab, with\nthe profile of a Washington and the naïve eyes of youth, whispered\nto him courteously that it was the tale of the Third Kaland, and the\nPrince Azib was in the palace of the forty damsels who were\nfarewelling him, as they were to depart, according to custom, for\nforty days.",
        "Khazib, with a faint salutation of his turban towards the newcomer,\nwent slowly, sonorously on with his tale.",
        "“We fear,” said the damsel unto Azib, “lest thou contraire our\ncharge and disobey our injunctions. Here now we commit to thee the\nkeys of the palace which containeth forty chambers and thou mayest\nopen of these thirty and nine, but beware (and we conjure thee by\nAllah and by the lives of us!) lest thou open the fortieth door, for\ntherein is that which shall separate us forever.”",
        "For a moment the café faded from Ryder’s eyes. He was in the gloom\nof a garden, a shadowy darkness just touched by a crescent moon, and\nbeside him in the shrubbery a dark-shrouded form, shaking its\nshawled head at him in denial, and whispering, lightly but\ntremblingly. “It is a forbidden door ... forbidden as that\nfortieth.... There are thirty and nine doors in your life, monsieur,\nthat you may open, but this is the forbidden....”",
        "He had meant to look up that tale. And now chance was reminding him\nof it again. A superstitious man–Ryder’s great grandfather,\nperhaps, would have felt it an omen of warning, and a devout\nman–Ryder’s grandfather, perhaps–would have taken it for a sign\nfrom Heaven to divert his steps. Ryder reflected upon coincidence.",
        "“When I saw her weeping,” Khazib was intoning, and now Ryder\nattended, his scanty knowledge of the vernacular straining and\noverleaping the blanks, “Prince Azib said to himself, ’By Allah, I\nwill never open that fortieth door, never, and in no wise!’”",
        "“A wise bird,” thought Ryder to himself, drawing on his cigarette.",
        "“And I bade her farewell,” continued the voice slipping into the\nfirst person. “Thereupon all departed, flying like birds, leaving me\nalone in the palace. When evening drew near, I opened the door of\nthe first chamber and found myself in a place like one of the\npleasances of Paradise. It was a garden with trees of freshest\ngreen and ripe fruits of yellow sheen. And I walked among the trees\nand I smelt the breath of the flowers and heard the birds sing their\npraise to Allah, the One, the Almighty.”",
        "“_Allhamdollillah,” murmured Ryder’s neighbors reverently.",
        "“And I looked upon the apple, whose hue is parcel red and parcel\nyellow ... and I looked upon the quince whose fragrance putteth to\nshame musk and ambergris ... and upon the pear whose taste\nsurpasseth sherbet and sugar, and the apricot, whose beauty striketh\nthe eye as she were a polished ruby....",
        "“On the morrow I opened the second door and found myself in a\nspacious plain set with tall date palms and watered by a running\nstream whose banks were shrubbed with rose and jasmine, while privet\nand eglantine, oxe-eye, violet and lily, narcissus, origane and the\nwinter gilliflower carpeted the borders; and the breath of the\nbreeze swept over those sweet-smelling growths....”",
        "How inadequate, Ryder realized, had been the description given by\nthe Book of Genesis to the Garden of Eden.",
        "“And the third door,” droned on the rhythmic voice, “into an open\nhall, hung with cages of sandal-wood and eagle-wood; full of birds\nwhich made sweet music, such as the mocking bird, and the cusha, the\nmerle, the turtle dove–and the Nubian ring-dove.”",
        "A trifle restively Ryder stirred. He liked birds but he wanted to\nbe getting on to that fortieth door and this was slow progress. Not\na sign of impatience marred the bright, absorbed content of the\nother listeners, intent now upon the wonders behind that the fourth\nchamber revealed, stores of “pearls and jacinths and beryls, and\nemeralds and corals and carbuncles and all manner of precious gems\nand jewels such as the tongue of man could not describe.”",
        "The story teller proceeded, “Then, quoth Prince Azib, now verily am\nI the monarch of the age, since by Allah’s grace this enormous\nwealth is mine; and I have forty damsels under my hand nor is there\nany to claim them save myself.”",
        "The handsome Arab beside Ryder inhaled his pipe luxuriously. “By the\ngrace of Allah!” he said reverently.",
        "“Then I gave not over opening place after place until nine and\nthirty days were passed and in that time I had entered every chamber\nexcept that one whose door I was charged not to open. But my\nthoughts ever ran upon that forbidden fortieth and Satan urged me to\nopen it for my own undoing....”",
        "“I see his finish,” said Ryder interestedly to himself–and he\nthought of the analogy.",
        "“So I stood before the chamber, and after a few moments’ hesitation,\nopened the door which was plated with red gold and entered. I was\nmet by a perfume whose like I had never before smelt; and so sharp\nand subtle was the odor that it made my senses drunken as with\nstrong wine, and I fell to the ground in a fainting fit which lasted\na full hour. When I came to myself I strengthened my heart, and\nentering found myself in a chamber bespread with saffron and blazing\nwith light.... Presently, I spied a noble steed, black as the murks\nof night when murkiest, standing ready saddled and bridled (and his\nsaddle was of red gold) before two mangers one of clear crystal\nwherein was husked sesame, and the other, also of crystal containing\nwater of the rose scented with musk. When I saw this I marveled and\nsaid to myself, ’Doubtless in this animal must be some wondrous\nmystery, and Satan–’”",
        "“Satan the Stoned!” murmured Ryder’s neighbor religiously.",
        "“Satan cozened me, so I led him without and mounted him ... and\nstruck him withal. When he felt the blow he neighed a neigh with a\nsound like deafening thunder and opening a pair of wings flew up\nwith me in the firmament of heaven far beyond the eyesight of man.\nAfter a full hour of flight he descended and shaking me off his back\nlashed me on the face with his tail, and gouged out my left eye,\ncausing it to roll along my cheek. Then he flew away.”",
        "On rolled the voice, narrating the prince’s descent to the table of\nthe other one-eyed youths, but Ryder was unheeding. And at the close\nhe inclined his head with the other listeners, murmuring “May Allah\nincrease thy prosperity,” as he felt in his pockets for the silver\nwhich the others were drawing from turban and sleeves and sash to\nlay in the patriarch’s lap, and then raised his head to question\ndiffidently, “Would you interpret, O Khazib, the meaning of that\ndoor? For I hear that it hath now become a saying of a forbidden\nthing.”",
        "The sage hesitated, sucking at his pipe. Then he said slowly, “To\nevery man, O Youth, is there a forbidden door, beyond which waits\nthe steed of high adventure ... with wings beyond man’s riding. And\nso the rider is lost and his vision is gone.”",
        "“But for him who could ride?” Ryder suggested.",
        "“Inshallah! Who can say till he has tried his destiny–and better\nare the nine and thirty chambers of safe pleasance than the lonely\nsightlessness of the outcast one.... It is a tale which if it were\nwritten upon the eye-corners with needle-gravers, were a warning to\nthose who would be warned.”",
        "For a moment their eyes held each other, smiling but grave. Ryder’s\nthoughts were of the morrow, of that forbidden entry he was planning\nto make, of the risks, the wild uncertainties....",
        "Wisdom and counsel looked significantly out at him out of those\npatriarchal eyes. Prudence and sanity clamored within him for a\nhearing.",
        "And then he smiled, the whimsical, boyish smile of young\nadventuring.",
        "“But whoever, O, my father, had opened that forbidden door\nthe veriest crack, and breathed its scent and glimpsed its\ndazzlement–then for him there is no turning back,” he confided.",
        "He rose and Khazib’s eyes followed him.",
        "“Luck go with you, my son,” he said clearly, “in Allah’s name,” and\nsmiling in faint ruefulness, “May Allah heed thee!” Ryder murmured\npiously.",
        "THE UNINVITED GUEST",
        "Now as he stood before Aimée, and saw her eyes widen with\nrecognition, he knew that he would have need of all his luck and all\nhis wit. He stepped hastily forward.",
        "“_Alhamdolillah–Glory to God that he has permitted me to behold\nyou this day,” he murmured, in the studiously sing-song Arabic that\nmight be expected from a humble Turkish woman in plain mantle and\nyashmak. “May Allah continue to spread before thee the carpet of\nenjoyment–” and then lower, almost muffled by the thick veil, “Can\nyou give me a moment–?”",
        "Eagerly, significantly, his eyes met hers.",
        "Half fearfully, Aimée flashed an excited look around her. The space\nbefore the marriage throne had thinned, for there were no more\narrivals waiting to offer their congratulations and the guests were\nclustering now about the tables for refreshment or drifting into the\nnext salon where behind firmly stretched silken walls a stringed\norchestra was playing.",
        "Miss Jeffries alone was lingering near, but she moved off now–at a\nsecret look from Ryder–with an appearance of unconcern.",
        "“I am going to try my vernacular on the bride,” Ryder had told her.\n\"Don’t linger or look alarmed. I won’t give the show away.”",
        "So there was no one to overhear a low-toned colloquy between the\nbride and the veiled woman, no one to note or wonder that the veiled\nwoman was speaking, strangely enough, in rapid English.",
        "“When I didn’t hear from you I had to come, to know if you received\nthe package and letter I sent–”",
        "With a swift gesture of her little ringed hand Aimée drew from the\nlaces on her bosom that heavy gold locket.",
        "“Indeed I have it–and the note, too, I found. But I could not write\nyou. There was no way–no one to trust to mail it. And they had\nstolen my key,” she whispered, and the confessing words with their\nquiver of forlornness told Ryder something of the story of those\nhelpless days and nights.",
        "He murmured, “I didn’t dare write you more personally for fear they\nwould find the note.”",
        "“I understood. That plaid about the box–that was so clever a\nwarning. I kept the box and hunted in it.”",
        "“I wanted to tell you more about that locket. I dug it up myself\nfrom the tomb I was excavating–do you remember how you wished that\nI would dig from the sands whatever secret I most desired? And I\nfound that.... And it happened that at McLean’s I had met the French\nagent who was searching for any trace of the Delcassés, of the wife\nand child of the explorer who had disappeared fifteen years before.\nThat miniature was your image, and I guessed at once. McLean and I\nwent to the pasha–Oh, I didn’t tell him I’d met you!” he flung in,\nhis eyes twinkling, “and we pretended we knew all about his marriage\nto Madame Delcassé and he owned up without a quiver. But when we\ntried to claim you for the French family, he doubled like a hare. He\nsaid the Delcassé child was dead, died when his own child was a\nbaby, and that you were his own. But I was sure that you were more\nthan fourteen, and that he was simply putting it over on us so as to\nhave this marriage go on without interference–and so I tried to get\nthe story to you. Even now I thought you ought to know,” he added,\nas if in palliation of his invasion here.",
        "For he realized now how tremendous an invasion it was.",
        "All the guests about him had not given him that feeling, all that\nsea of femininity, those grave matrons whose serenely unveiled faces\nwould burn with shame to be beheld by this stranger, those bright,\nslim girls in their extravagant frocks, their tulle, their lace,\ntheir pearls, their diamonds, all the hidden charms that no man had\nyet seen stirred in him no more than an excited and adventurous\ncuriosity.",
        "But the vision of Aimée–that delicate beauty in its tragic irony\nof throne and diadem! It touched him to tenderness and to an actual\nsense of sacrilege at the freedom of his gaze. No moonlight vision\nthis, ethereal and dream-like, but a vivid, disquieting radiance of\ndark, shining eyes and rose-flushed cheeks. He had never seen her\nhair before, midnight hair, escaping little curls from the veil and\nthe diadem. And he had never really seen her mouth–wistful and gay,\nlike the mouth of the miniature ... nor her chin, so tender and\nwillful ... nor her skin, satin-soft, in its veiling from the\ndaylight....",
        "She was more than young and sweet and fair. She was beauty, beauty\nwith its elusive, ineluctable spell, entangled with the appeal of\nher helplessness.",
        "A bright blush flooded her now and her eyes fell in confusion,\nbefore the prolonging of his look.",
        "“But it is dangerous–your being here,” she murmured.",
        "“The fortieth door,” he reminded her.",
        "Under her breath, “Ah, you remember?”",
        "“I remember. And but last night I heard Khazib, the story teller,\ntell the tale, and I thought of you and your warning–of the door\nthat hid you, that it was forbidden for me to open.”",
        "“And so you opened it, monsieur.” Faintly she smiled, with downcast\nlashes.",
        "“And I came as you first came to me–in mantle and veil.”",
        "For a moment their thoughts fled back to that masquerade, which\nseemed so long ago.",
        "“But it is too late,” she said tremulously.",
        "“_Is it too late–for me to help you?”",
        "At that her eyes rose to his again in a swift flash of hunted fear.",
        "“Oh, take me away from him!” she breathed suddenly, unpremeditately.\n\"Somehow–somewhere–”",
        "Another figure came towards them. Madame De Coulevain in all her\nsevere elegance of black.",
        "“Come and join your friends at the supper, my dear; there is no need\nfor you to be pilloried here any longer,” she observed with an\nindifferent scrutiny of the persistent veiled woman, and Ryder moved\nslowly away while Aimée came dutifully down from the throne, a huge\nblack bending to hold her train.",
        "“I thought you were never coming! What were you talking about?\"\ndemanded a voice in Ryder’s ear, and he found Jinny Jeffries at his\nside, her bright gray eyes pouncing upon him with curiosity.",
        "“Oh, I wished her joy–native phrases–that sort of thing,” he\nanswered mechanically as they drew back into an embrasure of the\nmashrubiyeh that formed one side of the great room.",
        "“But you were talking forever. I saw you holding forth at a\ntremendous rate. Why wouldn’t you let me stay and listen–?”",
        "“You’d have put me off my shot, I had to feel unobserved to play\nup.”",
        "“You must be fearfully good at Arabic,” said Jinny guilelessly.\n\"And what did she say?”",
        "“Why–she didn’t say anything in particular–”",
        "“But what was that she was showing you? I saw her bend forward with\na locket or something–?”",
        "A plague upon Jinny’s bright eyes! “Oh, yes, the locket,” said Ryder\nwith an effort. “She–ah–she showed it to me.”",
        "“But why? Wasn’t that awfully funny–”",
        "“Oh, I believe it’s a custom, courtesy stunt you know, to show a\npoor guest some of the presents,” he explained, manufacturing under\npressure.",
        "“I wish she’d show me her rings. Did you ever see so many? It was\nthe only thing about her you’d call really Eastern–all those\nglittering diamonds on her fingers. And did you notice her hands?\"\nJinny went on enthusiastically. “Jack, I never knew there was\nanything so lovely as that girl in the world. She’s simply\nexquisite.... I suppose it’s her whole life,” Miss Jeffries\nreflected, “keeping herself beautiful.” Her eyes rested curiously on\nthe feminine groups before them. “They haven’t anything else to do\nor think about, have they?”",
        "“I understand some of them are remarkably educated young women.”",
        "“What’s the use of it?” said the practical daughter of an American\ncollege. “They can’t ever meet any men, but just a husband–”",
        "“They can read for themselves, can’t they? And talk to each other.\nAnd–well, what do you girls do with your education anyway? You\ndon’t lug anything very heavy about the golf course and the ball\nroom.”",
        "“Who wants us to? But we do bring something to committees and clubs\nand–and welfare work,” Miss Jeffries maintained stoutly. “And we\nare always into arguments at dinners. While these girls, they can’t\ndine out, they haven’t anybody but themselves to argue with, and it\ndoesn’t matter a straw politically what they think–they can’t even\nchange the customs that their great, great, great grandfathers\nimposed.",
        "“If I were one of these girls,” she declared positively, “I wouldn’t\nbother about Kant and chemistry and history–I’d stuff myself full\nof sweetmeats and loll around on a divan and not care what happened\noutside. Or else I’d be miserable.”",
        "“Perhaps they are miserable.”",
        "“They ought to fight. Think, think,” said Jinny dramatically, “of\nmarrying some man you’ve never seen–the way that lovely girl is\ndoing. Suppose she doesn’t like him? Suppose he’s dull and cranky\nand mean and greedy? Suppose he bores her? Suppose she actually\nhates him? Why, Jack, it’s horrible! And yet she submits–she\nsubmits to it–”",
        "“Suppose she has to submit, that she hasn’t a soul on earth to help\nher? How would you fight, I wonder–”",
        "“Well, you don’t need to shout about it! That woman’s looking\nnow–that one with the green turban and the stuffed-date eyes.”",
        "Nervously Jinny glanced around.",
        "“It’s a fearful lark,” she murmured, “but I don’t believe I’d ever\nhave had the nerve if I’d realized.... What do you suppose they\nwould do, Jack, if they found you out?... Those big blacks look\nso–so uncivilized.”",
        "Her eyes rested upon the huge eunuch at the far entrance of the\nsalon, a huge hideous fellow, with red fez, baggy blouse and\ntrousers, and a knife handle sticking piratically from a sash.",
        "“He has on English oxfords,” said Ryder lightly. “That’s a saving\nsomething. But they aren’t going to find out..... I have an idea we\nought to make our getaway now, and that we had better not go\ntogether. You go first and then I’ll stroll along, and whisk off\nthese duds in some quiet corner.... I have to meet a man to-night,\nbut I’ll probably see you to-morrow. And don’t,” he entreated,\n\"don’t as you love your life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\nbreathe a word of my being here like this to any one–any\ntime–anywhere. I was an unmitigated ass to link you up with it. So\nbe wary.”",
        "“Oh, I shall!” Jinny Jeffries promised vividly and with a last look\nabout the old palace, the empty marriage throne and the dissolving\nknots of guests, she gave a little nod to her veiled companion,\nsauntered without visible trepidation past the staring eunuch at\nthe door, went down the long stairs where other departing guests\nwere drawing on mantles and veils, and so made her way across a\nshadowy garden and out the gate that another black opened.",
        "And then she drew a sudden breath of relief and glanced up at a sky\nof sunset fires and felt the free airs play with her hair and face\nand so shook off, lightly and gratefully, that darkening impression\nof shuttered rooms and guarding blacks.",
        "Little rivers of wine and fire were bubbling in Aimée’s veins. She\nwas gay at supper, as a bride should be gay. It was enough, for\nthose first few moments, that she had seen him again, that he had\ndared to come and try to help her–that he cared enough to come!",
        "Her heart sang little pæans of joy and triumph. She sketched\nimpossible scenes of escape–she saw herself, in a shrouding mantle,\nslipping with him past the guests at the door, she saw them speeding\naway in a motor, she saw France, the unknown Delcassés–a bright,\ngay world of freedom and romance.",
        "Or, perhaps, if not to-night, then to-morrow.... They would plan ...\nshe would obtain permission to take a drive and there would be a\nsignal, a waiting car....",
        "But, better now. She could not endure even the call of ceremony from\nthat man who called himself her husband. The very memory of his eyes\non her....",
        "Decidedly, it must be to-night. And Ryder would think of a way. She\nmust get back to him ... he would be lingering. She must get away\nfrom this hateful table, these guests and companions....",
        "A wild impatience tore at her. She grew uneasy, anxious, fretted at\nthe frightening way that time was slipping past....",
        "Her radiance vanished, her smile was nervous, forced, as she sat at\nher table of honor, amid the circle of her friends, with a linked\nwreath of candelabra sending its sparkle of lights over the young\nfaces and jewel-clasped throats, over the glittering silver on the\nwhite satin cloth among the drift of pink and white rose petals.",
        "She began to bite her lips nervously... she did not hear what her\nbridesmaids were chattering about ... her eyes went often, with that\nstealth that invites regard, to the tiny platinum and diamond watch\nupon her wrist.",
        "Would they never finish? Would they never be free? She wondered if\nshe dared feign an illness to rise and leave them; but no, that\nwould mean solicitude, companions....",
        "And now the slaves were bringing still another round of trays....",
        "Oh, hurry, hurry, her tightening nerves besought.",
        "At last! The older women were going. Not even for a wedding would\nthey deeply infringe upon that rule which keeps the Moslem women\nindoors after the sun has set. Ceremoniously each made to the bride\nher adieux and good wishes, and ceremoniously a frantically\nimpatient Aimée returned the formal thanks due for “assistance at\nthe humble fête.”",
        "She did not see that black mantle anywhere.",
        "Her heart sank. Stupid, she told herself with quivering lips, to\ndream that he could dare to linger, that he had any way to get her\nout. By help he meant no more than getting letters to France for\nher.... And yet his eyes when they had met hers.... Surely he had\nmeant–but when she had disappeared from the reception room to\nattend the supper, when there seemed no way of speaking again to\nher, and all the outsiders, all but the invited guests were\ndeparted, he had been, obliged to go, too.",
        "Perhaps some one had begun to notice him.... She wondered if he had\nbeen careful about his shoes, his hands.... How had he managed about\nthe dress anyway?",
        "And then she remembered that girl, that pretty American with the\nruddy hair to whom she had seen him talking, and she conjectured\nthat there was feminine aid and confidence....",
        "A wave of bitterness swept over her. He had told that girl about\nher–he knew that girl well enough to tell her! And perhaps he was\nonly sorry for the poor little French girl in the Turkish harem,\nperhaps they were both sorry....",
        "Had he told that girl, she thought with bitter mutiny, that he had\nkissed her?",
        "That girl must have been very sure of him not to be jealous of his\ninterest in herself!",
        "And now they could be somewhere together, perhaps talking her over,\nwhile she was here ... here forever....",
        "She was so white now, so silent, so distrait, that all the chatter\nof the younger girls who were lingering around her could not dispel\nthe feeling of depression. They cast covert glances of discomfort at\neach other, begged for more music from the orchestra, tallied with\nan effort of the size and spaciousness of the palace and the\nmagnificence of the feast.",
        "She had told herself that she had ceased to hope. She did not know\nhow false it was until the eunuch brought his message. Then hope\nreally died.",
        "The general was below and begged to be announced to madame.",
        "“We fly!” whispered a lingerer with nervous laughter, and hastily\nthe young people hurried into their tcharchafs and veils, murmuring\namong themselves, with sidelong glances at that white figure whose\ncold hand and cheek they had just touched, hastily they sped, like\nlight-footed nymphs in some witches’ robes, down the long room,\nwhile Madame de Coulevain drew back a strand of the girl’s dark hair\nand murmured, “But smile, my dear,” to the still figure and escaped\nwith the guests.",
        "And then Aimée was alone in the great room, deserted of its throngs,\na darkening room, full of burned-down candles and fallen flower\npetals, with here and there the traces of the revelers, a scented\nhandkerchief ... a fan ... a buckle from some French slipper ... or\na feather from some ancient turban clasp....",
        "Like the ghost of some deserted queen, with her regal satins and\nglittering circlet, she waited. There was a moment of grace in which\nshe tried, to turn a gallant face toward the next moment.",
        "Then he came, advancing.... It may have been her distorted fancy,\nbut down the long perspective, that figure looked more mincing, more\nwaspish, more unreal than ever. And she was conscious of that swift\nrising of dislike, of antagonism touched with reasonless fear.",
        "THE BEY RETURNS",
        "He kissed her hands. She caught the murmur of compliments and the\nmingled scent of musk and wine. He had been dining at his reception\nfor the men, but he called now for a table and more refreshment.",
        "A small table was brought to the end of the room near the marriage\nthrone where all the day she had paraded; a richly embroidered cloth\nof satin was flung over it, and from crowding candelabra fresh\nlights shed down a little circle of brilliance.",
        "Faintly Aimée protested that eat she could not, and then she made a\nfeint of eating, lingering over her sherbets, because eating was,\nafter all, so safe and uncomplicated a thing.",
        "The black brought champagne in its jacket of ice and filled their\nglasses.",
        "The general rose. ’À notre bonheur–to our happiness,” he\ndeclared, holding out his glass, and she clinked her own to it and\nbrought her lips to touch the brim, but not to that toast could she\nswallow a single one of the bubbles that went winking up and down\nthe hollow stem.",
        "The glass trembled suddenly in her hand as she set it down. An\noverpowering sense of fatigue was upon her. With the death of her\npoor hope, with the collapse of all those flighty, childish dreams,\nthe leaden weight of realities seemed to descend crushingly upon\nher. She felt stricken, inert, apathetic.",
        "It was all so unreal, so bizarre. This could not possibly be taking\nplace in her life, this fantastic scene, this table set with lights\nand food at the end of a dark, deserted old room opposite this\ngrimacing, foppish stranger....",
        "She could barely master strength for her replies. How had it all\ngone? Excellently? She was satisfied with her new home? With the\nservice? The appointments?",
        "He plied her with questions and she tried to summon her spirit: she\nachieved a few perfunctory phrases, the words of a frightened child\nstruggling for its manners. She tried to smile, unconscious of the\nbetrayal of her eyes.",
        "He told her, sketchily, of his day. A bore, those affairs, those\nspeeches, he told her, gazing at her, his wine glass in his hand, a\nflush of wine and excitement in his face. She found it unpleasant to\nlook at him. Her glance evaded his.",
        "She stammered a word of praise for the palace. It must be very\nancient, she told him. Very–interesting.",
        "He waved a hand on which an enormous ruby glittered. He could tell\nher stories of it, he promised. It had been built by one of the\nMamelukes, his ancestor. Its old banqueting hall was still\nuntouched–the collectors would give much to rifle that, but they\nwould never get their sharks’ noses in. Nothing had been changed,\nbut something added. Once the Mad Khedive had borrowed it for some\nyears and begun his eternal additions.",
        "“Forty girls, they say, he kept here,” smiled Hamdi Bey. “They\ngulped their pleasure, in those days. It is better to sip, is it\nnot?”",
        "He smiled. “But these are no stories for a bride! I only trust that\nyou will not find your palace dull. It is very quiet now, very much\nof the old school. You may miss your pianos, your electricity, all\nyour pretty Parisian modernity.”",
        "She glanced at the glittering table.",
        "“But I do not find this so–so much of the old school. Here one does\nnot eat rice with the fingers!”",
        "“And I?” said the bey, leaning suddenly towards her on his outspread\narm. “Do you find me too much of the old school? Eh? eh?”",
        "“But you, monsieur,” she stammered, still looking down, “you–I do\nnot know you–not yet.”",
        "“Not–yet. Excellent! There will be time.”",
        "“I confess that now I am weary–”",
        "“Ah,–and that diadem is heavy. Your head must ache with it,” he\nsaid solicitously.",
        "Perhaps it was the diadem that gave her that leaden, constricted\nsense of a band tightening about her forehead. She put up her hands\nto it.",
        "“Permit me,” he said quickly, springing to his feet. “Permit me to\naid you.”",
        "He stepped behind her and bent over her. She held her head very\nstill, stiff with distaste, and felt the weight lifted. He surveyed\nthe circlet a moment then placed it upon the marriage throne behind\nher. She had an ironic memory of the false omen of her crowning, of\nsoft, satisfied little Ghul-al-Din’s bestowal of her own\nhappiness.... Happiness, indeed....",
        "“And that veil–surely that is incommoding?” suggested the suave\nvoice, and she felt the touch of his hands on her hair where the\nmisty veil was secured.",
        "She stammered that it was quite light–she would not trouble him–",
        "Then she held herself rigid, for suddenly he had swept the veil\naside and bent to press his lips to that most hidden of all veiled\nsanctities, for a Moslem, the back of her neck.",
        "She did not stir. She sat fixed and tense. Then slowly the blood\ncame back to her heart, for he was moving away from her again to his\nplace at the table.",
        "Laughing a little, pulling at his blond mustache in a gesture of\nconquest, his kindling eyes glinting down at her, “You must forgive\nthe precipitateness–of a lover,” he murmured. “You do not know your\nown beauty. You are like a crystal in which the world has thrown no\nreflections. All is pure and transparent–”",
        "If she did not find words to answer him, to divert his admiration,\nshe felt that she was lost.",
        "“You are not complimentary–a bit of glass, monsieur, instead of a\ndiamond! But I am too weary to be exacting.... If now, you will\npermit me to bid you good evening and withdraw–”",
        "“Little trembler,” said the general facetiously, and reached out a\nhand to touch her cheek, the light, reassuring caress that one might\ngive a petted child, but it almost brought a cry of nervous terror\nfrom her lips.",
        "She thought that if he touched her again she would scream. He\ninspired her with a horrible fear. There was something so false, so\nsmiling in him... he was like an ogre sitting down to a delicate\ndish of her young innocence, her childish terrors, her frank\nfears....",
        "She could not have told why she found him so horrible, but\neverything in her shrank convulsively from him.",
        "And the need of courtesy to him, of propititation–!",
        "The cup was bitterer than her darkest dreams.... She wondered how\nmany other women had drained such deadly brews... had sat in such\nghastly despair, before some other bridegroom, affable, confident,\nmasterful....",
        "She told herself that she was overwrought, hysterical. The man was\ncourteous. He was trying to be agreeable, to make a little expected\nlove. He had drank a little too much–another time she might find\nhim different. He was probably no worse than any other man of her\nworld.",
        "It was not in her world, each young Turkish girl said in those days,\nthat one could find love.",
        "But it was not her world! It was an alien world, enforced,\nimprisoning.... That was the bitterest gall of all the deadly cup.",
        "“There is no need for haste,” he was assuring her. “In a moment I\nwill call your woman. Fatima, her name is, an old slave of our\nhouse.”",
        "“I could wish,” said Aimée, “that I had been permitted to bring my\nold nurse, Miriam, without whom I feel strange–”",
        "“No old nurses–I know their wiles,” laughed the bey, setting down\nhis drained cup with a wavering hand. “They are never for the\nhusbands, those old nurses–we will have no old trot’s tricks here!”",
        "He laughed again. “This Fatima is a watch dog, I warn you, my little\none ... but if she does not please you, we can find another. And as\nfor the rooms–I have assigned this suite to you, the suite of\nhonor. This is the salon, and there,” he pointed to a curtained door\nbehind them, opening into a small room that Aimée had already seen,\n\"there is your boudoir and beyond that, your sleeping apartment. I\nhave had them done over for you, but you shall choose your own\nfurnishings–everything shall be to your taste, I promise you. You\nare too sweet to deny. You have but to ask–”",
        "Certainly, she thought, he was drunk. He moved his head so jerkily\nand his whole body swayed so queerly. Desperately she fought against\nher horror. Perhaps it was better for him to be drunk.",
        "Drunken men grow sleepy. Perhaps he would fall down and sleep.\nPerhaps she ought to urge him to drink. Long ago the black had left\nthe bottle at his elbow and gone out of his room.",
        "But she did not move. She sat back in her chair, withdrawn and\nshrinking, watching him out of those dark, terrified eyes.",
        "“You are beautiful as dreams,” he told her, leaning towards her with\nsuch abruptness that his sword struck clankingly against the table.\n\"Beyond even the words of my babbling cousin–eh, Allah reward\nher!–but she did me a good turn with her talk of you!”",
        "Fixedly he stared at her, out of those intent, inflamed eyes.",
        "“I did not know that there was anything like you in the harems of\nCairo. You are like a vision of the old poets–but I suppose that\nyou do not know the ancient poetry. You little moderns are brought\nup upon French and English and music and know little of the Arabic\nand the Persian.... I daresay that you have never heard of the poet\nUtayyah.”",
        "Still leaning towards her he began to intone the stanzas in a very\nfair tenor voice, and if his movements were at all unsteady, his\nspeech was most precise and accurate.",
        "     “From her radiance the sun taketh increase when\n      She unveileth and shameth the moonlight bright.”",
        "He chuckled.... “Ah, I shall put the triple veil upon you, my little\nmoon.... How Is this one?",
        "     “’On Sun and Moon of Palace cast thy sight,\n        Enjoy her flower-like face, her fragrant light,\n      Thine eyes shall never see in hair so black\n        Beauty encase a brow so purely white.’”",
        "He got up and drew his chair closer to her. “That is the song for\nyou, little white rose of beauty.”",
        "Back went her own chair, and she rose to her feet.",
        "“I thank you for the compliment, monsieur. But now have I your\npermission to retire? For it has been a long day and I am indeed\nfatigued–”",
        "To her vexation her voice was trembling, but she steadied it\nproudly.",
        "“I bid you good evening.”",
        "“Nonsense, my little white rose. This is not so fatiguing–a few\nwords more. But you are like the flower that flies before the\nwind.... But your room, yes, to be sure. Shall I show you the way?”",
        "“I can discover it, monsieur.”",
        "“Monsieur–fie on you, my little dove.... Hamdi, I tell you, your\nlover Hamdi.”",
        "He laughed unsteadily, and put a hand on her arm. “You are running\naway, I know that. And I have so much to tell you ... Oh, it was\ntedious in that villa of your father’s! ’Yes,’ I thought to myself,\n’that is a fine story, a funny story, but I have heard them all\nbefore. And you are in no haste, you revelers–you have no little\nbride waiting for you at home.’... That one glance at you–I tell you\nit was the glance of which the poet sings–the glance that cost him\na thousand sighs. I was on fire with impatience.... For I am\nbeauty’s slave, little dove.... You may have heard–but no matter. A\nwife must be a pearl unspotted.... I am not as the English who take\ntheir wives from the highways, where all men’s glances have rested\nupon them. Have I not been at their balls? Their women dance in\nother men’s arms. They marry wives whose hands other men have\npressed. Sometimes–who knows?–their lips have been kissed.... And\nthen a husband takes her.... Oh, many thanks!”",
        "He laughed sardonically and waved his hands a little wildly. “Oh, I\nknow English–all the Europeans. I have seen their women. I have\nseen them selling their wares–stripping themselves half bare in the\nevenings, the shameless–For me, never! My wife is a hidden\ntreasure. You know what the poet says:",
        "     “’An’ there be one who shares with me her love\n        I’d strangle Love tho’ Life by Love were slain,\n     Saying, O Soul, Death were the nobler choice,\n        For ill is Love when shared twixt partners twain.’”",
        "“You are fond of your poets,” said Aimée with stiff lips.",
        "“You–you kindle poetic fires, my little one. You–I–” He stammered\na moment, then forgot his fierce speech against foreign ways. “You\nhave the raven hair–”",
        "His hand went out to it. He smoothed it back out of her eyes, then\ntried to draw her to him.",
        "Desperately she resisted. “Monsieur, one does not expect a\ngentleman–”",
        "“Expect! Ho–what should one expect when a man has such a little\nsweetmeat, such a little syrup drop, such a rose petal–Come, come,\nyou would not struggle–”",
        "But it was not the struggling hand of the frightened girl that sent\nthe general back.",
        "It was a brown, sinewy hand on his shoulder, a hand protruding from\na well tailored gray sleeve and lilac striped cuff, that caught\nHamdi Bey by the epauleted shoulder and sent him spinning about.",
        "Another hand was holding a revolver very directly at him.",
        "“Silence!” said Jack Ryder in his best Turkish and repeated it, with\namplification, in English. “Not a sound–or I’ll blow your head\noff.”",
        "Aimée gave a strangled gasp.",
        "He had not gone, then! He had hidden there, in some nook of that\nboudoir behind those shadowy curtains, waiting to protect her, to\nrescue....",
        "Over one arm he had the black mantle and veil, “Better put these\non,” he suggested, without taking his eyes from the rigid bey, “and\nthen run for it.”",
        "“But you–you–?”",
        "“I’ll take care of myself. After you are out of the way. Dare you\ntry that? Or what do you suggest?”",
        "“Oh, not alone. Together–”",
        "“So–so–” said Hamdi Bey inarticulately, his head nodded, he\nstaggered, his knees gave way and he crumpled very completely upon\nthe floor, and lay like a felled log.",
        "After a quick look down at him Ryder turned to Aimée. “Quick, then.\nWe’ll make a run for it–”",
        "He did not finish. Hamdi Bey, upon the floor, fallen half under the\nfolds of the white cloth, made a swift and very expert roll and\ndarted to his feet beside Aimée, whirling her about, with pinioned\nelbows, for his shield.",
        "And so screened, he gave a shrill whistle.",
        "WITHIN THE WALLS",
        "Ryder sprang forward, trying to reach the bey, but he dodged\nskillfully; his holding Aimée blocked Ryder in his attack.",
        "He knew that high, peculiar whistle had been a signal, a call for\naid, and he flung a lightning glance down that long room, tightening\nhis hold on the revolver–but he did not see the small door that\nopened in the shadowy paneling behind him, nor the shadow that grew\ninto the gorilla-like shape of the black as it launched itself\nthrough the air upon his back.",
        "He only heard Aimée’s scream, and then before the crashing weight\nupon his shoulders he staggered and went down.",
        "The bey flung Aimée aside and rushed upon the prostrate figure,\nkicking the revolver from the outspread hand. The black knelt\nswiftly down, unfastening his silken sash.",
        "Giddily the room whirled about Aimée.... In the candle light,\nleaping in the rush of conflict, she saw the bey and the black, and\ntheir distorted shadows in a goblin blur.... And beneath them she\nsaw Ryder, helpless, his hands and feet pinioned.... With the\nmadness of despair she rushed forward, but the general intercepted\nher.",
        "“He is quite helpless.... You need not be alarmed for my safety,\nmadame!”",
        "The cold, biting fury of his voice steadied her. She saw his face\nwas distorted, livid with anger. His breathing was stertorous.",
        "She stood helplessly by the table; the general turned and looked\ndown upon the face of the man who had dared to violate the sanctity\nof his harem and attempt to steal his bride; beyond the man’s head\nYussuf, the black, was squatting with a grinning, dog-like\nwatchfulness.",
        "But Ryder did not require watching. That sash had been tied strongly\nabout his hands and feet. He was as helpless as a baby.",
        "But the peculiar flavor of his helplessness was not so much fear\nbefore the fanatic fury of this man he had outraged, although he had\na clear notion that his position was not enviably secure, but a\nbitter, black chagrin.",
        "To have had the game in his hands and have bungled it! To have been\nsurprised by that simple strategy, taken off his guard by a feigned\ncollapse! The wily old Turk for all his champagne had the clearer,\nquicker brain....",
        "To have let him get to Aimée and call in his black! To have been\nthrown, disarmed.... It was crass stupidity. It was outrageous\nmismanagement, abominable, maddening....",
        "And Aimée must pay for it. He tried to think very quickly what could\nbest clear her.",
        "He fixed his eyes on those glittering eyes, staring down upon him.",
        "“I realize I owe you an explanation,” he said grimly. “If you will\nlet me tell you–”",
        "The bey turned to Aimée with a smile that was the lifting of a lip\nand the distention of his nostrils.",
        "“This fool thinks he has the time to talk–his English.”",
        "Desperately Ryder grasped for his vernacular. “I want to tell\nyou–why I came. This–this young lady doesn’t know me.”",
        "Past the general he shot a look of warning at the girl.",
        "“I was trying to get hold of her for her family in France–She is\nreally a French girl. Tewfick Pasha is not her father but her–\"\nhe could not find the word and dropped into English. “Her\nstep-father–do you understand? And he had no business to marry her\noff, so I tried to steal her for the French family. It was a mad\nattempt which has failed–but for which the young lady should not be\nblamed. She had never seen me before. She had no idea I was here.”",
        "After a pause, “A remarkable story,” said the general distinctly. He\nturned about to the table and drank off the last of a glass of\nchampagne, then wiped his mouth with the back of a hand that\ntrembled.",
        "He turned back to stand over his prostrate invader. “Now, you–you\ndog of Satan,” he snarled in a sudden snapping of restraint, “how\ndid you get here? Who admitted you?”",
        "And at that, for all his trussed and helpless plight, Jack Ryder\ngrinned. He moved his head slightly. “That blackbird of yours here.”",
        "“Yussuf–never!”",
        "“The very one. But he didn’t know it–I was in that black\nmantle–and veil.”",
        "“Oh, the mantle, I had forgot. So you stole in, disguised, to\nviolate my hospitality, to outrage my harem, to gaze upon the\nforbidden faces of women and to steal the bride–”",
        "“I tell you I was trying to rescue the girl for her French family.\nShe is French and Tewfick Pasha is only–”",
        "“And what is that to me? Do I–” the bey broke off and then turned\nto the silent girl who stood leaning towards them, a trembling ghost\nin white.",
        "“And you, my little one,” he murmured sardonically with a savage\nirony of restraint, “you, the little dove secluded from the world,\nwho trembled at a kiss, the crystal vase who had never reflected the\nblush of love, whose virginal praises I was chanting when I was so\noddly assaulted, do you support this idiot’s story?”",
        "Mechanically her head moved in assent, her eyes, dilated with fear,\nwere like the dark, fascinated eyes of some helpless bird.",
        "“You never saw this young man?” the bey pursued. “And yet you were\nready to run off with him–a pretty character you give yourself, my\nsnowdrop!–and you liked his eyes and hastened to obey?”",
        "Aimée was silent. From his ignominy upon the floor Ryder hastened to\ninterpose.",
        "“It is true she had never seen me, but I had already written to her\nand acquainted her with the story. I tried to reach her first\nthrough her father but that was useless so I resorted to these\ndesperate means.”",
        "“Oh you wrote! And you told her you would be here, and murder her\nhusband–”",
        "“I told her nothing of the kind. She didn’t know that I was coming\nuntil I spoke to her here, and then she had no idea that I was going\nto wait and carry her off–”",
        "“In the name of Allah! Do you take me for a dolt, an ass? You, with\nyour writing and your masquerade and your secrets! Do any families\ntry to recover their relatives with such means? Daughter or\nstep-daughter, it is nothing to me–”",
        "“But it is true,” Aimée insisted, in a trembling voice. “My father\nwas Paul Delcassé–”",
        "“_Yahrak Kiddisak man rabbabk–curse the man who brought thee up!\nDelcassé or devil, it is Tewfick Pasha who is your step-father, your\nguardian, who gave you to me for wife–what has your genealogy to\ndo with this affront upon my honor?”",
        "“But he did not intend to affront your honor–only to aid the family\nin France–”",
        "“I ask you again, do I resemble an ass that you should put such a\nburden of lies upon me? As if I did not know why young men risked\ntheir lives, in the dead of night, in other men’s rooms! If I did\nnot know what turns their brains to mush and their hearts to leading\nstrings! And you–you–you little white rose of seclusion–!”",
        "His venom leaped out at her in his voice. It was a terrible voice,\nthe cold, grating menace of a madman.",
        "“You, who had never seen this man but who fluttered to him like a\nwhite moth to a fire, you who cowered from your husband’s hand but\nwho turned to follow this strange dog into the streets–there will\nbe care taken of you later. But now–you complained of fatigue.\nSurely this scene is overtaxing for your delicacy. If you will come\nto your rooms–”",
        "She drew back from the hand he laid upon her. “Do not injure him!\nBy Allah’s truth! He is rash, mad, but a stranger. He did not\nknow–”",
        "“He needs enlightenment. He needs to learn that a nobleman’s harem\nis not a café of dancing girls, where all may enter and stare and\nfondle. Bismallah–he shall learn!... And now come–”",
        "“I shall not go,” she said breathlessly.",
        "“What–struggle? But your father has been strangely remiss with his\ndiscipline.... Permit me.”",
        "His hand tightened in a grasp of iron.",
        "“My train is caught,” she said in a tone of sudden pettishness; she\nstooped to lift it with her hand that was free.",
        "“My train–!” he mimicked her in a quivering falsetto. “Have a care\nof my frock–do not crush my chiffons.... And these are the women\nfor whom men break their heads and hearts!”",
        "“I tell you, sir,” came urgently from Ryder, “that the girl is\ninnocent of all–”",
        "“Keep your tongue from her name–and your eyes from her face!...\nCome, madame.”",
        "With his iron grasp on her elbow he thrust her towards the boudoir\nat the end of the drawing-room, behind whose curtains Ryder had so\nlong been hiding.",
        "The chamber was in darkness, lighted only by a pale gleam from the\nother room. Aimée stumbled across the rug and found herself upon a\nhuge divan against a window screen.",
        "“Fatima is in the next room to come at a call. But perhaps you would\nprefer to wait for me alone? I shall not be long.”",
        "Desperately she caught at his arm, imploring, “I beg you, monsieur.\nHe has done no real harm. Let him go. He is a stranger–he\ndid not know. And he will never trouble you again. I will do\nanything–everything you desire–if only you will not injure him–”",
        "“You trouble yourself strangely for a stranger.”",
        "“He is a stranger in danger for my sake. For it was in his duty to\nmy–my family–” her trembling lips stumbled over the ridiculous\nlies, “that he has blundered into this. He has no idea how shocking\na thing he has–”",
        "“And you had no idea, either, I suppose. You had never heard of\nhonor or treachery or–”",
        "“I was wrong, oh, I was wrong! I did want to go to France–I own it.\nAnd I was not ready for marriage. And I had heard that you–I was\nafraid. But now–if you will let him go for my sake, if you will not\nvisit my sins upon him, oh, I should be so grateful–so grateful\nthat anything I can ever do–”",
        "“But you will be grateful, anyway, my little blossom. I promise you\nthat you will learn to be very grateful–”",
        "“It is easier to die than to learn to love a hated one,” she\nreminded him softly, leaning towards him. “I can die very willingly,\nmonsieur.... And you would not want a wife before whom there was\nalways an object of terror–”",
        "Through the dusk her great eyes sought his.",
        "“Be generous–and harm him not,” she breathed. “I beg of you, I\nimplore–”",
        "“And if I am–lenient–you will always be grateful?”",
        "Mutely she nodded, her eyes trying pitifully to read that shadowy\nmask of mockery he turned towards her.",
        "“And how grateful could you be, little dove?”",
        "Pitifully she smiled.",
        "“Could you,” he murmured, “could you learn to kiss?”",
        "He leaned nearer and involuntarily she shrank back. Faintly, “At\nthis moment–I beg of you, monsieur–”",
        "“Oh, if it is to be an affair of moments! We shall never find the\nright one. But you were so full of promises–”",
        "“I will do anything,” said Aimée, convulsively, “if you will promise\nme–”",
        "“Come, then a kiss. A peck from my little dove.”",
        "She looked at him out of wretched eyes.",
        "“And you promise to free him, not to hurt him–”",
        "“I promise not to hurt a hair of his head. Come, that is generous,\nisn’t it? As to freeing him–h’m–that is for later. Perhaps, if you\nare very good. A kiss then... and later....”",
        "He bent over her. She shut her eyes and heard the taunt of his\nlaugh. She kissed him, and he laughed again.",
        "“What is it the Afghan poets say? ’Kissed lips lose no sweetness,\nbut renew their freshness with the moon.’ Certainly if you have ever\nbeen kissed, little bud, you have lost no dew.... Delicious.... I\nshall hurry back.”",
        "He cast a hard look down at her as she sat there, her arms drooping\nat her sides. He looked about the room as if consideringly, then\nnodded at an unseen door at the right.",
        "“Fatima is there if you want lights or assistance.... And Alsamit,\nYussuf’s brother, is at the other door beyond. Do not stir, little\nbird. I shall be back very soon.”",
        "“And he–you promised–”",
        "“I shall not hurt a hair of his head.”",
        "But he was smiling evilly in the darkness as he drew shut the door\nand returned to the bound figure by the guarding black.",
        "For a moment he stood silent, considering, while Yussuf looked up\nwith glistening-eyed intentness like an eager dog ready for the word\nof attack.",
        "Then in hasty Turkish the general gave his directions and the black\nnodded and strode to a portière, jerking it down, which he wrapped\nabout Ryder’s helpless form.",
        "Then he hoisted his burden over his huge shoulder and bore it on\nafter the general.",
        "Across the great room they went and down the long stairs up which\nthat day a most complacent Hamdi Bey had escorted his just-glimpsed\nbride.",
        "Now at the bottom of the stairs a shadowy figure of a sleeping\neunuch was stretched.",
        "Hamdi Bey spoke sharply, giving a quick order. The black scrambled\nto his feet, yawned, nodded, and strode away into the main vestibule\nand out into the garden to investigate a shadow which the general\nhad just reported, and when he was out of sight the general and\nYussuf, with his unwieldy burden, came quietly down the stairs and\nturned back into a long, dark hall.",
        "For a moment they paused outside a wide, many-columned banqueting\nroom, and there Hamdi Bey stood listening, straining attentive ears\nfor the faint sounds from the service quarters on the other side of\nthe room. He caught the guttural of a half inaudible voice, and the\nwash of water and clink of a dish, showing that the belated work of\nthe reception was going draggingly on, but it was all far away and\ninvisible.",
        "Satisfied he went on a few steps to a pointed door set in the heavy\nstone. From a nail he took down a lantern of heavy, fretted brass\nand lighted it, not without some difficulty, for his hands were\nstill trembling. Then he took from the black a cumbersome key which\nhe fitted into the lock and turned heavily.",
        "Drawing back the door he motioned Yussuf ahead, and followed,\ndrawing the door shut. Down a steep, stone spiral stair they went,\nand at the bottom, at the general’s order, the black set Ryder down\nfrom his shoulder and flung aside the portière.",
        "From its muffling folds Ryder looked out bewilderedly into the\ndarkness about him, illumined only by the yellow flare of the\nancient lantern. The general cautioned him to silence while Yussuf\nknelt and untied the strip that bound his feet, then, his arms still\nbound, he was ordered to march on before them.",
        "This, he said to himself, as he silently obeyed that order, this\nreally was the time to pinch himself and wake up! Of all the dark,\neerie nightmares! This slow procession through these underground\nhalls, the giant black on his heels, the general’s lantern throwing\nits flickering rays over the huge, seamed blocks of granite\nfoundations.",
        "It made him think of the Catacombs. It made him think of the\nSerapeum. It made him think of those damp, tortuous underground ways\nof the Villa Bordoni....",
        "They seemed to be in the wine cellars. He saw bins and barrels and\nbarred vaults that would have done credit to an English squire, and\nhe reflected fleetly that wine bibbing was forbidden to Mohammedans\nand that Hamdi Bey was a fanatic Moslem.... Then he saw open spaces\nof ancient stuffs, broken tables and dismantled caiques and a broken\noar. His earlier observation of the palace had told him that it had\na water gate and he thought now that they might be near some\nopening.",
        "He wondered if they were going to throw him, pinioned, into the\nriver. He wouldn’t put it past this livid, silent, shaking man–and\nyet the thing appeared so impossible, so theatric, so utterly\nunrelated to any of the ways that he, Jack Ryder, might be expected\nto end his days, that it couldn’t possibly send more than a shiver\nof speculation down his spine.",
        "And yet men had been thrown into rivers–this very river. And men\nhad disappeared from just such palaces as this. There was the story\nabout young Monkton. He knew it perfectly; he had reminded himself\nof it the last evening while he reflected upon this escapade, but he\nhad never actually appreciated the peculiar poignancy of the thing\nuntil now.",
        "Monkton had met–so rumor reported–a Turkish lady of position,\nflirted with her, it was said, while on horseback outside her motor\nwhen caught in the crush at Kasr-el-Nil bridge. There had been a\nmeeting or two in the back of shops, and then he had boasted,\nlightheartedly, of a design to take tea in her harem.",
        "He had never boasted about the tea. No one had ever seen Monkton\nagain and he was generally reported, after a stifled inquiry, to\nhave been thrown from his horse in the desert, or spilled out of his\nsailing canoe.",
        "The government, English or Egyptian, assumed no interest in the\nmatter of gentlemen found in other gentlemen’s harems.",
        "There were other stories, too. There was one of a little Viennese\nactress who after a dramatic escape reported a whole winter of\ncaptivity in one of these old palaces, and there was a vaguer rumor\nof a rash young American girl, detained for days....",
        "Ryder had always known these stories. They were part of the gossip\nand thrill of Cairo. But he had never till now realized how\nexquisitely possible was their occurrence.",
        "Anything, everything might happen in these hidden, secret chambers.\nThese Turks were as much masters here as their old predecessors who\nhad reared these stones. This black upon his heels might have been\nthe grinning, faithful executioner of some Khedive or Caliph–he\nmight have been the very Masrur, the Sworder of Vengeance of Al\nRaschid.",
        "He told himself that it was no time to think of the past. His\nbusiness–acutely–was the present. If only he could get his hands\nuntied! If only he could get those untied hands upon that demoniac\nTurk!",
        "But, strain as he could upon the knots, they held.",
        "It seemed to him that they had been walking for an interminable\ndistance, in odd, roundabout ways. Once they had stopped and he had\ninvoluntarily glanced back over his shoulder, but at a word from the\ngeneral he had kept his head forward again, while he heard the black\nbehind him gathering something that clinked. Later, a stolen glance\nhad revealed the eunuch with some tools in one hand and bag slung\nover his shoulder.",
        "The bag disquieted him. Bags filled a foreboding place in the\nEastern literature of vengeance. He wondered if he were to go into\nthe river in that bag, with the tools for weight.",
        "He decided, feeling now a very odd and definite disturbance in the\nregion of his stomach, that he would tell that general that he was a\ncousin of the late Lord Cromer and a nephew of Lord Kitchener.\nSomething insistent would have to be done about this.",
        "They were passing now through a strange, open space, between old\narches that for an instant arrested his excavator’s interest. He saw\nin the shadows about them, a crumpled, crumbling dome and broken\nshafts, with half a wall of masonry pierced with Arabesques. Traces\nof old ruins, fragments of some old, forgotten mosque over which the\npalace had spread its foundations in bygone days.... Buried\ntreasure, looted, some of it, for the palace overhead, but still\nrare and lovely.... That was a gleam of lapis lazuli that winked at\nhim from the crumbling mortar under his feet.",
        "Then they were between other walls, not crumbling ones, but the\nsolid, pillared blocks of the palace masonry with here and there\nbroad arches of old brick.",
        "They stopped. Between two arches the general held his lantern high,\nflashing it over the surface while Yussuf swung down his sack and\nknocked with the handle of his tool.",
        "Suddenly he stopped and looked at his master, nodding cheerfully.\nThe general lowered his light and stepped back and Yussuf reared the\npickaxe in his powerful arms and sent it dexterously at the wall,\nbetween two broken bits of brick.",
        "It caught, and sent the mortar spraying; another blow and another\nloosened a hole in which the black inserted a short iron and began\nnervously grinding and prying.",
        "Ryder, watching with oppressed and helpless fury, saw the bricks at\nlast break and tumble faster and faster in a cloud of dust, and saw\na pocket in the wall become revealed, a long, upright niche, the\nsize, perhaps, of a man’s coffin, on end.",
        "He tried, very suddenly, to talk. His tongue felt thick and swollen\nand there seemed no words in all the world to fit his need of\novercoming this fanatic madman,–and after all, he had no chance for\nthem, for Yussuf, with a huge palm upon his mouth, urged him\nsuddenly backwards towards that horrible niche.",
        "“Gently, Yussuf, gently,” said the general, suavely and with a slow\ndistinctness that was for Ryder’s ears. “I gave my word that I would\nnot hurt a hair of his head–”",
        "Grinning, the black lifted him over the remaining wall, and set him\ndown into the niche, leaving him standing in there like a helpless\nstatue, tasting to the full fury of his heart the bitterness of his\nhelplessness and the ludicrous impotence of all struggle.",
        "“Good God, sir, you must be mad,” he said in a strained sharp\nvoice that his ears would not have known as his own. “Do you\nrealize–there will be an inquiry–there is such a thing as law–”",
        "It seemed to him that he talked, in English and stammering Arabic,\nfor a long time. The black was kneeling, out of sight, stooping over\na basin of water and his abominable sack, and Ryder was facing that\nsilent, sardonic face, with its fantastic mustache, its evil,\ngloating eyes....",
        "He stopped for very shame. The man was mad. Mad and drunk–and there\nwas no appeal from Philip drunk to Philip sober.... Mad or drunk, he\nhad devised his vengeance shrewdly.",
        "Upon Ryder’s helpless body a cold sweat of incredulous horror broke\nsoftly out.",
        "At his feet he heard the black beginning to fit his bricks and\nsmooth his mortar.",
        "“You do well to save your breath,” said Hamdi Bey at last, as Ryder\nstill stood silent. “You will need it in this chamber I am\nproviding.... But it may be,” he said thoughtfully, “that your\nbreath will last your need. Thirst may be the more impatient for her\nvictim; they tell me thirst is an obtrusive visitor. As you were,\nthis evening.... Still, why do you not cry out a little? It will\namuse my black.”",
        "Yes, this was real, Ryder reminded himself. And these things could\nhappen–had happened. He remembered suddenly the hideous scene,\noutside the dungeons, in “Francesca da Rimini,” when that bestial\nbrother goes in to the helpless prisoners. He remembered the sick\nhorror of those groans....",
        "He remembered also various excursions of his in the Tower of London\nand the Seigniory of Florence, and the sight of old rings and stakes\nand racks and the feeling of their total unrelatedness to every\nactuality.",
        "And yet they had happened. And this thing, for all its fantastic\nmedieval horror, was happening. Brick by brick the imprisoning wall\nwas rising. Brick by brick it intervened between him and sane,\nsensible, happy, normal life.",
        "Eye for eye he gave the general back his look. He had always\nwondered about the poor devils in underground torture chambers. Had\nwondered how they had the stuff to hold out, against such odds, for\nsome belief, some information.... Now he knew the stiffening stuff\nof a personal hate, upholding to the very grave....",
        "That sardonic, devil’s face.... That face which was going back\nupstairs to Aimée.... But he must not think of that or he should\ngive way and begin to babble, to plead.... He must simply stand and\nmeet that glance....",
        "And there came the incredible, insane moment when Ryder looked out\non that face through one last breathing space, and then saw the\nfitted brick, settled into place, blot the world to darkness before\nhis eyes.",
        "UNDERGROUND",
        "Alone in the gloom of that strange room, Aimée sat rigid. Listening.\nNot a sound, beyond the closed door, from the long drawing room. Not\na sound, beyond the other door, from the room where the slave,\nFatima, waited to assist in her disrobing.",
        "Silence everywhere–save for a low lapping of water against the\nmasonry beneath her windows.",
        "The palace was on the river, then, or on some old backwater. She\nremembered glimpses of dark canals on her drive that morning–had it\nonly been that morning? The sound of that soft, hidden water added\nto her feeling of isolation and remoteness from everything that had\nbeen her life before–she thought fleetingly, almost indifferently\nof her friends, Azima, who to-day had crowned her for happiness, and\nfond, foolish old Miriam and Madame de Coulevain and Tewfick Pasha,\nweakly cruel, but amiable; she thought of them all, as unreal\nfigures from whom she had long taken leave.",
        "The old life was over. It had died for her when she passed through\nthe dark doorway and met that arrogant, sardonic, fatuous man, the\nmaster of this palace....",
        "Or more truly that old life had died for her when she had flung a\nblack mantle about her chiffon frock and a street veil across her\nsparkling face and had stolen, daring and breathless, into the\nlights and revelry of that hotel masquerade. There, when she had\nshrunk back from the Harlequin and had looked up to meet the\nkindling glance of that mask in tartans–yes, there, the old life\nhad died for her forever if only she had known it.",
        "And now–she would only like to die, too, she thought miserably,\nafter she had been assured of Ryder’s safety. She was tense with\nfear for him, distrusting in every fiber the assurance of that\nfanatic, outraged Turk.",
        "She was not utterly resourceless. When Ryder’s revolver had dropped\nto the floor she had maneuvered, unseen by Hamdi Bey, to get her\ntrain over it, and when she had stooped for her train her one free\nhand had closed over the revolver handle beneath the satin and lace.",
        "Now the revolver lay on the divan, and very eagerly she drew it out,\nfeeling it in the darkness, curling her finger about the trigger.\nNever in her life had she fired a shot, for her most formidable\nweapon had been the bows and arrows of the Children’s Archery\nContest of the English Club, but she felt in herself now that\nhighstrung tensity which at all cost would carry her on.",
        "Carefully she bestowed the small, steel thing in the bosom of her\ndress, then she stared questioningly at the dress itself, hastily\nunpinning the veil, and tying the long train up to her girdle. Then,\nwith a wary glance for the closed door behind which waited that\nFatima she dreaded, she stole to the door the general had shut and\npressed it softly ajar, peering out into the deserted throne room.",
        "Like a great cave of darkness the room stretched before her, peopled\nwith goblin shadows from the dying candles upon the disordered,\nabandoned table; she saw the chair pushed back where she had risen\nto struggle with the bey, the long folds of white cloth, sweeping\nthe floor, behind which Hamdi had rolled so agilely; a stain was\nstill spreading about an upset glass, and from the overturned cooler\nthe ice water was dripping, dripping with a steady, sinister\nimplication.",
        "She thought of flight.... There was another black, the general had\nwarned her, beyond the door, and there would be bars and bolts on\nany egress from the harem, but with the revolver in her possession\nsome desperate escape might be achieved.",
        "But Ryder.... No, the gun was for another purpose.... She would not\nsquander it yet upon herself....",
        "From the boudoir she moved slowly, carrying one of the gilt\ncandelabra from the table to light the room. She would need light\nfor her plan....",
        "For ages, long, unending ages, she sat there, waiting.... A hundred\ntimes it seemed to her that she could stand no more, that she must\nmake her way out at all costs, must discover what fate they were\ndealing to Ryder, but still she forced herself to sit there, her\npulses racing, her heart sick with suspense, but desperately\nwaiting....",
        "She felt a sudden wave of weakness go through her at an advancing\nstep from the next room. But her chin was up, her eyes fixed and\ndesperate as the figure of the general appeared in her opening door.",
        "“Ah, light! This is more cheerful, little one.”",
        "She had risen, half moved towards him. “Is he safe?”",
        "“The stranger? Safe as treasure–buried treasure, little one.”",
        "The bey laughed, and that laughter and the glittering satisfaction\nof his eyes, filled her with foreboding although his next words came\nwith smiling reassurance.",
        "“Not a hair of his head is hurt, I give you my word.”",
        "“But where is he–what have you done?”",
        "“Shut him up, to be sure. Kept him as hostage for your sweet\nhumility–a novel way to win a bride, oh, essence of shyness!”",
        "Malevolently he smiled down at her and in the back of her frightened\nmind she realized that this man did well to be angry, that the\naffront to him had been immeasurable, and that many a Turk would\nhave simply driven his dagger through the intruder’s heart–and her\nown, too.",
        "But though she tried to tell herself that there was forbearance in\nhim, she felt, instinctively, that there was deeper kindness in\ndirect, thrusting fury than in this man’s sinister mockery.",
        "She had sunk back upon the divan on the bey’s approach; now as he\nstood before her with that mask of a smile upon his face, drawing a\nsilk handkerchief across a forehead she saw glistening in the\ncandlelight, she leaned towards him again, her hands involuntarily\nclasping.",
        "“Monsieur, I seem to have done you a great wrong,” she said\ntremblingly, “but it is not so great as you suppose. Will you listen\nto me? I–”",
        "“Useless, useless.” He waved the handkerchief negligently at her. “I\nhave had words enough. You are not the daughter of Tewfick\nPasha–you are his step-daughter–your French family desires to\ncapture you–I know the rigmarole by heart, you observe. And of\ncourse when a French family desires to obtain possession of a\ncharming step-daughter, on the eve of her marriage, that family\nalways employs a handsome young man to break into the bride’s\nchamber–and point a gun at the husband–”",
        "His mustache lifted in a grimacing sneer.",
        "“But it is true, and I am French,” she interposed swiftly.",
        "“Excellent–I do not object in the least.” He shot his handkerchief\nup his cuff, and turned to her with eyes that lightly mocked\nthe agonized appeal of the young face. “French blood is\ndelightful–quicksilver and champagne. You will enliven me, I\npromise you.”",
        "“But the marriage–it is not legal, monsieur,” she said desperately,\nsummoning all her courage. “Tewfick Pasha has no right to give me to\nyou–”",
        "Indulgently he smiled down at her, then his narrowed eyes traveled\nslowly about the room.",
        "“But this is a strange time–and place!–to talk of legalities. Do\nnot distress yourself–your step-father is your guardian and your\nmarriage will be as binding as the oaths of the prophet. Have no\nqualms.... And now, if your French blood will smile a little–”",
        "He started to seat himself beside her, but in that instant she was\non her feet. With all the courage in her beating heart she whipped\nout that revolver and pointed it at him.",
        "“If you call–I shoot,” she said breathlessly.",
        "The round mouth of the gun shook ever so slightly in the excited\nhand gripping it, but in the blazing look she turned on him was the\nunshaken, imperious passion of a woman swept absolutely beyond all\nfear.",
        "Meeting that look Hamdi Bey stood extremely still and made no sound.",
        "“There are plenty of shots–for you, at the first noise, and for\nthe servants, if they come,” she went on in that fierce undertone,\nand then, passionately, “What did you do to him? Take me to him–at\nonce!”",
        "Irresolutely the man stood and looked up at her under his\nhalf-lowered lids. He was near enough for a spring–and yet if that\nexcited finger should press.... The girl was capable of anything.\nShe was possessed.... And men had died of such accidents before\nthat....",
        "“May I speak?” he murmured, in a tone scarcely audible, yet\npreserving somehow its flavor of sardonic amusement.",
        "“Under your breath. One sound, remember–and I am a very good shot.”",
        "“But what a wife,” he sighed. “All the talents–”",
        "“I tell you that I will see him for myself. Take me to him, this\nmoment–”",
        "“Shall I give orders and have him brought here? He is quite safe, I\nassure you.”",
        "“Orders? If you summon a servant I will shoot. No, lead the way, and\nI will follow you. And if you make one sound–one false move–”",
        "Decidedly the girl was possessed. She stood there like a white image\nof war, her hand on that infernal automatic.... He hesitated, gnawed\nhis mustache, then swung sullenly upon his heel.",
        "Like some fantastic sculpture from an Amazonian triumph, they\ncrossed the long drawing-room, the erect, gilt-braided general\npreceding, very slowly, the white-clad feminine creature, who held\none hand extended, with something boring almost into his shoulder\nblades.",
        "He did not lead her down the long stairs, past the guarding eunuch.\nHe took, instead, an inner way through the late supper room which\nled down into the pillared hall of banquets. That way was safe of\nservants now; crossing the pillared hall there were no more sounds\nof late work from the service quarters beyond. Oblivious of the wild\ndevelopments of that wedding reception, the tired servants, stuffed\nwith the last pasty, warmed with the last surreptitious drop of\nwine, were asleep at last.",
        "Outside the door in the stone wall the bey took down the lantern\nwhich so short a time before he had replaced upon its nail and\nlighted its still smoking wick. He had not restored the key to\nYussuf, and he drew it now from his pocket and fitted it into the\nlock, drawing back the door.",
        "“These stairs are steep,” he murmured. “I hardly like you to descend\nthem unaided, but if you insist–”",
        "“Go on,” she said imperiously.",
        "Down he went, and after him she came, following the way he led her\ndown the long stone underground ways.",
        "“We have, of course, very pleasant stairs down to our water gate,\"\nhe murmured apologetically, “but since you prefer this way–really\nnot the way that I would have chosen to have you first explore your\npalace, madame! These, you perceive, are the cellars and old\nstorerooms–”",
        "“I do not want you to talk,” she said urgently.",
        "“But you would not shoot me for it? Only for raising an alarm? And\nsurely you cannot be unreasonable about a few words–you must be\nvery careful, here, this doorway is low–”",
        "It was not past the old ruined mosque, included in the palace’s\nunderground world, that he was leading her, but down a narrow\nbranching way, between walls so low that the general’s head was\nbowed in caution.",
        "“This part of the palace is very old,” he murmured, over his\nshoulder. “An ancestor of mine, Sharyar the Wazir, raised these\nwalls during the wars–for the dispensing of that sacred duty of\nhospitality which Allah enjoins upon the faithful. It is reported\nthat he was host here to fifty of the enemy during their remaining\nlifetime–although they had the delicacy not to cumber him with\noverlong living. It is not, as I said, a pleasant place, but the\nwalls are strong and so I selected a spot here–”",
        "Here, somewhere, then, in these grim ruins, Ryder was penned,\nhelpless and questioning the to-morrow. The girl trembled with\nexcitement when she thought of his joy, his deliverance–and at her\nhands. For their escape she had no plans, only the decision to\nthrust the gun into his hands and follow him unquestioningly ...\nPerhaps they could leave the general in his place and he could wear\nthe general’s uniform for disguise....",
        "Everything was possible now that she was nearing him and his safety\nwas at hand. She thrilled with a reanimating excitement that flew\nits scarlet banners in her cheeks ... Only a few steps now....",
        "“Go on,” she said breathlessly.",
        "The bey had stopped and now flashed his lantern over a low, timbered\ndoor, studded with ancient nail heads in a design whose artistry did\nnot arrest her. From a peg beside it he took down a key of brass,\nfitted it to the lock and turned it with a deliberation maddening to\nher tense nerves.",
        "Her heart was beating as if it would burst its bounds. Only a moment\nor two–",
        "He had trouble with that door. It took his shoulder; at last he set\nit swinging inward slowly on its creaking hinges. Then he stepped\nback and with a wave of his hand invited her to enter.",
        "“Not a chamber of luxury, you understand, but substantial, as you\nwill see–”",
        "“Go first,” she ordered.",
        "He laughed. “Ever distrustful, little thorn-of-the-rose! Follow,\nthen,” and he stepped within, into the darkness, which his failing\nlantern but little illumined, calling out in a louder tone in his\nhalting English, “A visitor, my friend. A tourist of the\nsubterranean.”",
        "She had followed him to the threshold, seeing nothing in the\nblackness but the seamed blocks of stone within the lantern’s rays,\nafraid always to turn her eyes from him or her hand from its\noutstretched pointing.",
        "He said very quickly to her in Turkish, “If you will wait by the\ndoor. The floor is bad and there is another lantern, here on the\nwall–”",
        "At her left he fumbled along the stone wall. She heard him mutter\n... and then reach.... And then–she did not know what was\nhappening. For the very ground on which she stood, the solid block\nof stone began to slip swiftly beneath her feet–she staggered–and\nfelt herself falling, falling, into some precipitately opened\nabyss....",
        "She gave a wild scream, flinging out her arms in terror, and then\ncold waters closed above her, and the scream ended in a gurgling\ncry.",
        "It was no great distance that she fell. What the dropped stone had\nrevealed, answering the signal of the old lever in the wall that the\ngeneral had pressed, was a stone well, narrow, deep, implanted there\nby some ingenious lord of the palace in by-gone days, for the subtle\nelimination of friend or foe or rival.",
        "But it was not part of Hamdi’s plan to leave the young girl there\nand close the obliterating stone. Scarcely had the waters met above\nher head than he was flinging down a rope ladder whose upper ends\nwere fastened to rings in the floor and descending this with swift\nagility until the waters reached his waist.",
        "Then he leaned out and clutched the floating satin bubbling and\nballooning yet unsubmerged above the stagnant depths and drew it\ntowards him. As the struggling girl came gasping within his reach,\nhe carried her panting up the ladder again, and laid her down in the\ndarkness, while he drew up the ladder and closed the stone by\npressing that hidden lever.",
        "But the stone which had dropped so swiftly, was slow and heavy in\nslipping back in place, and when he turned again to Aimée, she had\nceased her choking cough and was sitting up, thrusting back the\ndripping hair from her black eyes, staring bewilderedly about the\ngloom as murky as any genie’s cave.",
        "The lantern light was almost out. In its expiring gleams she saw no\nmore inky water, but only the damp, moss-grown stones, on which a\npool was widening from her wet garments, and the half-defined figure\nof the general stooping over to squeeze the streams from his own wet\nclothes.",
        "The nightmarish horror of it overwhelmed her. For a moment she could\nhave screamed with horror, and then she felt a cold and terrible\ndespair lay its paralyzing hand upon her heart.",
        "Somewhere, she felt, beneath those secret stones lay Ryder, drowned\n... And she was living, in her helplessness ... No revolver now.\nThat was gone ... in the water, perhaps....",
        "There was no resource, now, no refuge.... Strength went out of her,\nand passive in a dream of evil darkness she felt herself being\nhurried, stumblingly, back through the secret corridors and the dark\nhalls.",
        "OUT OF THE DARKNESS",
        "There was no measure of time for Ryder in that walled coffin of\ndeath. The seconds seemed hours, the minutes ages.",
        "He drew quick, short breaths as if economizing the air that was so\nsoon to fail him; he tugged at his bonds till the veins rose on his\nforehead, but the silk held and the confines of the prison permitted\nhim no room for struggle; then he leaned forward, to press with all\nhis might upon the bricks before him; he grunted, he sweated with\nthe agony of his exertions, but not a brick was stirred, not a crack\nwas made in the mortar that gripped them tighter every instant.",
        "He died a thousand deaths in the horror that invaded him then.\nAlready he felt strangling, and the painful pumping of his heart\nseemed the beginning of the end.",
        "Cold sweat stood out all over him; it ran down his face in trickling\nstreams and his body was drenched with that clammy dew of fear.",
        "He tried to count the minutes, the hours, to estimate how long he\nwould hold out....",
        "And then he heard his own voice saying very distinctly and clearly\nand dispassionately, “This thing is absurd.”",
        "It was absurd. It was idiotic. It was utterly irrational. It was an\nimpossible end for an able-bodied young American, an excavator of no\nmean attainments, a young scholar and explorer of twentieth century\nscience, a sane, modern, harmless young man, to die immured in the\nancient walls of a Turkish palace–because he had invaded a marriage\nreception and intervened between man and wife.",
        "Violent death in any form must always appear absurd to the young and\nenergetic. And the fantastic horror of his death removed it\ndefinitely from any realm of possibility. The thing simply could not\nhappen.... He thought of the amazement and the incredulity of his\nfriends....",
        "Dangers in plenty they had warned him against, to his youthful\namusement–sand storms and chills and raw fruit and unboiled waters,\nbut they had not warned him against veiled women and the resentments\nof outraged lords and masters.",
        "He thought of his mother’s consternation and dismay. He thought of\nhis father’s stern amazement.... What an awful jolt it would give\nthem, he reflected, with an irrational tickling of young humor.",
        "But no, it would not. They would never know. Not a word of this fate\nwould percolate into the world without. Not a comment upon his true\nend would enliven the daily columns of the East Middleton\nMonitor. Never would it regret the tragic and romantic interment\nof a young native son of talent, buried alive by a revengeful\ngeneral of the Sultan....",
        "He amused himself by writing the paragraph that would never be\nwritten. Then he told himself that he was lightheaded and hysterical\nand that he had better wonder what would actually be written. What\nexplanation would be found?",
        "A desert storm perhaps, or some accident. McLean would poke\nabout–but for all McLean knew he might be on his way back to camp\nthat very moment. And sometimes he went by sailing canoe, and a\nrented horse, and sometimes by the accredited steamer and a camel,\nand sometimes by tram or train to the nearest station. Even McLean’s\nmind and McLean’s Copts wouldn’t make much of all the alternatives\nthat his unsettled habits had afforded.",
        "Was there any possibility of his being traced, of any rescue\nreaching him? He thought hard and long upon his last free moments.\nJinny Jeffries knew that he was in the palace, and Jinny had been\nreiteratedly warned about the danger of betraying that knowledge. It\nwould take some little time for alarm before Jinny said anything.\nAnd it would take a little time for Jinny to begin to worry.",
        "He had not been so instant in attendance upon Jinny of late, for all\ntheir residence in the same hotel, that she would suspect that his\nabsence of twenty-four hours was due to actual incarceration.",
        "His cursed passion for freedom in which to ramble up and down that\ndeserted lane without Tewfick Pasha’s garden! His inane love of\nsolitary mooning....",
        "No, Jinny would not soon wonder about him. She had not expected to\nsee him that evening, anyway–he had muttered something to her about\na man and an engagement.",
        "She would rather look to see him the next day and talk about their\nadventure.... But still she would feel no more than pique at his\nabsence; positive worry would not develop until later.",
        "Besides, all the revelations that Jinny could make would do no good.\nJinny could only report that he had maintained a disguise at a\nwedding reception, and talked a few moments, apparently undetected,\nto a bride. Hamdi Bey, and Hamdi’s eunuchs, would be blandly\nignorant of such a scandal. What his disappearance would indicate\nwould be some further frolic on his part, some tempting of a later\nProvidence before he had abandoned his disguise.... If he were\ndiscovered, for instance, in some of those native quarters, behind a\nwoman’s veil....",
        "Decidedly the only effect of Jinny’s revelations would be an\nunsavory cloud upon his character.",
        "There was no hope to be looked for.",
        "And yet he could not believe it. There were moments when the black\nterror mastered him, but involuntarily his young strength shook it\noff. He could not believe in its reality. He could not believe that\nhe was actually here, bricked and bound, in this infernal coffin....",
        "But, indisputably, the evidence was in favor of belief.... Only to\nbelieve was to feel again that horror....",
        "He tried to tell himself that it didn’t matter. One had to die some\ntime. Everybody did. One might as well go out young and strong and\nstill interested in life.",
        "But that was remarkably cold comfort. He didn’t want to go out at\nall. He didn’t want to die, not for fifty or sixty years yet, and of\nall the ways of dying, he wanted least to smother and choke and\nstifle like a rat walled in its hole in the wall.",
        "He recalled, with peculiar pain, a woodchuck that he had penned up\nas a boy, and he hoped with extraordinary passion that the poor\nbeast had made another hole. Never again, he resolved, would he pen\nup a living creature, never again, if only again he could see the\nlight of day and breathe the free air....",
        "He thought of Aimée. And when he thought of her his heart seemed to\nturn to water. Useless to repeat to himself now those old reminders\nthat he had seen her so little, known her so slightly. Useless to\nmeasure that strange feeling that drew him by any artifice of time\nand acquaintance.",
        "She was Aimée. She was enchantment and delight. She was appeal and\ntenderness. She was blind longing and mystery. She was beauty and\ndesire....",
        "Even to think of her now, in the infernal horror of this cramping\ngrave, was to feel his heart quicken and his blood grow hot in a\nhelpless passion of dread and fear. She was alone, there, helpless,\nwith that madman.",
        "He tried to tell himself that she was not wholly helpless, that she\nhad wit and spirit and courage, and that somehow she would manage to\nquell the storm; she might persuade Hamdi to their story, make him\nremember that this was the twentieth century wherein one does not go\nabout immuring inconvenient trespassers as in the earlier years of\nthe Mad Khedive–years which had probably formed the general’s\nimpulses–but in telling himself this there was no comfort for the\nthought of the price that Aimée would have to pay.",
        "It was pleasanter to pretend that Hamdi was really only joking, in a\nshockingly exaggerated, practical way, and that presently, when the\nsuitable time had elapsed, he would present himself, smiling, to end\nthe ghastly, antiquated jest.",
        "For some time he continued to tell himself that.",
        "And then suddenly he told himself that the time for intervention had\nsurely come. It was very hard to breathe.",
        "The next minute he was assuring himself that this was merely some\ndevil’s trick of his apprehensive imagination. There must be a\ngreat deal of air left.... But he was distressingly ignorant of the\ncontents of air, and his calculations were lamentably unsupported by\nany sound basis of fact.",
        "Mistake, not to have gone in for chemistry and physics. A chap who’d\ndone time in those subjects wouldn’t now be rocking with suspense;\nhe’d comfortably and satisfactorily know just how many hours,\nminutes and seconds were allotted before his finish and he could\nthink his thoughts accordingly.",
        "Undoubtedly, so he insisted to himself, there was air enough here to\nlast him till morning. This gasping stuff was all imagination. He\nwanted to keep cool and quiet. But for all his reassurance there\nwas something a little queer with his lungs, and his heart was\nlurching sickeningly in his side, like a runaway ship’s engine.",
        "And then he heard his own voice repeating very tonelessly, “O God, O\nGod,” and the horror of it all came blackly over him and a feeling\nof profound and awful sickness....",
        "It was a sound. The faintest scraping and knocking without that\nwall. It went through him like an electric current.... And then a\nroar burst from him that fairly split his ears, the reaction of his\nquivered nerves and racking fears of his uncertainties, his\ntightening terrors.",
        "But now–nothing. He could not hear a thing. A delusion? A torture\nof his final hours?... No, it came again. More definitely now, a\nlittle grinding and scraping.",
        "Faster and faster, a muffled, driving thud.",
        "A jubilant reassurance sang gayly through him. He had expected\nthis–this was what he had predicted. Hamdi was no foul friend. He\nwas a devilish uncomfortable customer with antiquated notions of\nrevenge, but now he had shot his wad and was going to undo his\ntricks.",
        "Ryder braced himself to present a carefree jauntiness–an air\nsomewhat difficult to assume when one is trussed like a spitted\nbird, in a hot coffin space, with hair falling dankly over a\nsteaming brow, with a collar like a string, and an indescribable\npallor beneath the bronze of one’s face.",
        "Something stirred. One end of a brick was driven in against his\nchest. Then he felt the blind working of some tool that caught it\nand worried it free.",
        "It seemed to him that through that dark aperture a current of cold,\ndelicious air came rushing in about him. The blows sounded against\nthe adjoining bricks and he thought of the glorious joy of seeing\nout again, feeling that he would welcome even the sight of Hamdi’s\nblond mustache and the eunuch’s hideous grin.",
        "Now the aperture admitted a pale gleam upon his chest. Staring\nsteadily down he caught a glimpse of the fingers curving about a\nbrick, and his heart that had steadied, began to race again wildly.\nFor they were not the fingers of the black nor yet the wiry joints\nof the general.",
        "They were soft, white fingers, with a gleam of rings.",
        "Aimée! Somehow, somewhere, she had managed to come to him, to\nachieve this rescue....",
        "“Aimée!” He breathed the name.",
        "“S-sh!” came a warning little whisper, and impatiently he waited\nuntil that opening should be greater and permit of sight and speech.",
        "His helplessness was maddening. If only he could raise his hands,\ncould get those bonds off! He twisted, he writhed, he tried to lift\nhis elbows and get his wrists in reach of the opening, but the\ncoffin was too diabolically cramped for movement until the hole was\nvery much larger. Then with a convulsive pressure he swung his\nwrists within reach and after a moment’s wait he felt a thin blade\ndrawn across the silk.",
        "The relief was glorious. He swung his hands free, rubbing the chafed\nwrists, then thrust an opened hand out into the opening, and with\ninstant comprehension a short, pointed bit of iron was put within\nit.",
        "Now he could do something! With furious strength he attacked the\nbricks edging the hole and as he pried free each brick he could\nagain get a glimpse of those white delicate fingers lifting it\ncarefully away.",
        "And now the hole was large enough. He twisted about and thrust out a\nleg, and then, with a feeling of ecstasy which made the official\nliterary raptures of saints and conquerors but pale, dim moods, he\nwormed his way out of that jagged hole and turned, erect and free,\nto the shrouded figure of his rescuer.",
        "She had drawn back a little against the wall, a gauzy veil across\nher face. Beside her, upon the stone floor, a solitary candle sent\nits flickering rays into the shadows, edging with light her slender\noutlines.",
        "Ryder took one quick step to her, his heart in his throat, and put\nout eager arms. But in the very moment that he was gathering her to\nhim, even when he felt her pliant body, at first resistant, then\nsoftly yielding, swept against his own, he felt, too, a little palm\nsuddenly upon his mouth.",
        "“Hsh!” said the soft, whispering voice, cutting into his low murmur\nof “Aimée!” and then, in slow emphatic caution, “Be–careful!”",
        "He had need of that caution. For under the saffron veil was not the\nface of Aimée. He was clasping a young creature that he had never\nseen before, a girl with flaming henna hair and kohl darkened brows,\na vivid blazoning face that smiled enigmatically with a certain\nmockery of delight at the amazement he reflected so unguardedly.",
        "AZIZA",
        "From the slackening grip of his astounded arms she stepped backward,\nstill smiling faintly and holding up in admonishment the palm she\nhad pressed against his mouth.",
        "“But what–what the dev–” muttered Ryder.",
        "She nodded mysteriously, and beckoned.",
        "“Come,” she whispered, catching up her candle, and after holding it\nhigh for a moment, staring at him, she extinguished it suddenly, and\nturned to lead the cautious way across the stone spaces while Ryder\nclosely followed.",
        "Not Aimée, then. But some messenger, he could only suppose. Some\nconfidante, at need. A handmaid? The whisper of her silks, the\nremembered gleam of jewels in the henna hair flouted that thought,\nand not troubling his ingenuity with alternatives he was content to\nfollow her swift steps.",
        "They were now in those open rubbishy spaces where he remembered the\ncrumbling masonry and broken arches of old, disregarded mosques; now\nthey were again enclosed in narrow stone walls, winding past cellars\nand store rooms.",
        "The girl’s advance grew more cautious. Often she stopped and\nlistened, peering ahead into the darkness, and now, as she took\nanother turning, her care redoubled and Ryder needed no exhortation\nto imitate it. Obeying a gesture of her arm, he followed at a\ngreater distance, prepared, at the warning of a sound, to flatten\nhimself against the wall or dart into some cranny of retreat.",
        "They were now in the cellars. The corridor was widening out before\nthem with a pallid showing of light, crossed with many bars, at some\nfar end.... They stole towards it. It was a window, or barred gate,\nhe saw, and he heard again that lapping of restless water against\nstone.",
        "He could see, too, in the dimness the curve of a stair near the\ngate.",
        "Abruptly his guide checked him. Wary and noiseless he waited while\nshe stole forward to those stairs, peering up into the gloom,\nattentive for any sound from above.... Apparently satisfied, she\nwent on towards the barred gate, and bent down over a spot of\ndarkness which Ryder had taken for a shadow.",
        "He saw now that it had some semblance to a human outline.",
        "Closely the girl bent and he caught the pallor of her hands,\nsearching swiftly, and then a muffled clink.... Next moment, a\nwraith with soundless steps, she was back at his side again, urging\nhim on with her. They passed the stairs; he felt the soft yield of\ncarpet beneath his feet; they passed that recumbent figure and now\nhe heard the rhythm of a sleeper’s heavy breath, escaping muffledly\nfrom the folds of a thick mantle which the sleeper’s habits had\nwrapped about his head. For all the mantle he was aware of the fumes\nof wine.",
        "“I saw that Ja’afar had his drink,” said the girl suddenly in softly\nwhispered Turkish, her head close to his. “He is my friend. I do not\nneglect him,” and under her breath she laughed, as she exhibited the\ngreat bunch of keys she had taken from the imbiber.",
        "Stooping now before the gate she fitted the key into the lock. Then\nover her shoulder she looked up at the young man, and asked him a\nquick question.",
        "He did not understand. That was the trouble with his vernacular. It\nwould go on very well for a time, when he had a clue to the sense,\nor when it was a question of every day expression, but a sudden\ndivergence, an unexpected word, was apt to prove a hopeless\nobstacle.",
        "Now she repeated her question again, more slowly, and again he shook\nhis head.",
        "Now she stood up, frowning a little and began again in English,\n\"You–no, I not know–This way? You do it?” A sudden smile broke\nover her face as she made a swift pushing gesture with her hands,\nthat, with her pointing to the water outside, sent Ryder a sudden\nenlightenment.",
        "“Swim? You mean–do I swim?”",
        "She nodded. “Not go–” She made a swift downward movement of her\nhands and then pointed again to that water just outside the gate.",
        "“Not go down–not sink?” interpreted Ryder. “No, indeed, I can\nswim,” he assured her, and revisited with smiling satisfaction she\nknelt again before the barred gate.",
        "Open it swung with so sharp a crack that both glanced at the figure\nbehind them, and then at the shadowy gloom of the stairs. But no\nalarm sounded. Outside the gate Ryder saw the darkness of fairly\nwide rippling waters, visited with floating stars, and beyond a\nlow-lying, dun bank.",
        "Escape was there. Freedom. Safety. He felt an exultant longing to\nplunge in and strike out, but he turned, questioningly, to the\nmysterious rescuer.",
        "“Aimée?” he asked, under his breath. “Where is she?” He repeated it\nin the vernacular, distrusting her English, and in the vernacular\nshe answered, “You want her? You want to take her away with you?”",
        "She laughed softly at the quick flash in his eyes and hardly waited\nfor his speech.",
        "“Good–what a lover! You are not afraid?”",
        "Mendaciously he assured her that he was not.",
        "“Good!” she said again, with a showing of white teeth between her\ncarmined lips. “You take her–you take her away from him. That is\nwhat I want. You understand?”",
        "Very suddenly he understood.",
        "AZIZA IS OFFENDED",
        "This was no emissary from Aimée. This was no philanthropic\nbystander. It was some girl of the palace, jealous and daring,\nconspiring shrewdly for the removal of her rival.",
        "“Take her away,” she was saying urgently. “Out of this palace. We\nwant no brides here.” Lowering and sullen, she turned bitter on the\nword.",
        "“To-night, I was watching,” she went on swiftly. “I heard–the\nnoise–and then the whispering.... The darkness has ears and\neyes–and a tongue. And so I waited out there....”",
        "He could not distinguish all the quick flow of her speech, but he\ncaught enough to understand how she had lurked in the halls,\njealously spying, defying the eunuchs’ authority, and how she had\ncaught with passionate delight that stifled alarm of scandal. Later,\nhanging over some banister, she had seen the Ethiopian pass with his\nburden and had stolen down afterwards, stalking like a cat, and had\ndiscovered the lantern gone, the door unlocked.... And then she had\nwatched until the pair emerged without the burden.",
        "She had not been able to get hold of the key to the door. But she\nhad resolved to explore and so she had furnished the waterman with\nhis wine, drugged, Ryder gathered, and so stolen past him on the\nother route to those underground foundations to which her suspicions\nhad been directed by the mortar and dust upon Yussuf.",
        "Evidently she knew the possibilities of the place and the mind of\nits master. And when she found the old niche freshly bricked and the\nmortar at hand she had not needed more to assure her that here was\nthe burial place of her rival’s lover.",
        "Now, for the boon of his life, he was to relieve her of that rival.\nOr try to.",
        "“For once–he might not kill her,” she whispered, “but if again–\"\nHer eyes glowed like a cat’s in the dark. “Take her away. Make her\nname a spitting and a disgrace.... Her memory a shame and a\nsting.... Is she beautiful?” she broke off to demand. “They say–but\nslaves lie–”",
        "“Can you believe a lover?” he said whimsically for all his\nimpatience. “She is a pearl–a rose–a crescent moon–”",
        "“They say she is very pale and thin–”",
        "“She is an Houri from Paradise,” he said distinctly. “And now, in\nthe name of Allah, let me get to her. Tell me the way–”",
        "“Will she go gladly with you?” the low, insistent voice went on, and\nat his quick nod, “Holy Prophet, what a bride!”",
        "She clapped her two ringed hands to smother the impish joy of her\nlaugh. “A warning to those who can be warned–he will not be so\neager for another stripe from that same stick!–It was his cousin,\nSeniha Hanum–Satan devour her!–who made this marriage. Always she\nhated me.... But now I will tell you how to get to her. Look out,\nwith me.”",
        "Kneeling at the gate, over the dark flow of the water, she drew him\ndown beside her, and thrusting out her veiled head, she pointed\nupward and to the right to a jutting balcony of mashrubiyeh, where a\npale light showed through the fretwork.",
        "“There–you see? That is my room. And if you climb up, I can let you\nin.... There... Up,” she repeated in English, resolved to make\ncertain.",
        "“I see. I can get there,” he assured her, measuring with his eye the\ndim distance.",
        "“At once,” she said. “I will be there. I cannot take you with me\nthrough the upper hall–it is dangerous even for me to be caught.\nBut no eunuch wants my displeasure.”",
        "He could believe it, watching the subtle, malicious daring of her\nface. Even in the gloom he caught the steady-lidded arrogance of her\nkohl-darkened eyes and the bold insolence of a high cheek bone. She\nhad a hint of gypsy....",
        "“And you can get me in? You’re a wonder!” he whispered. “I can’t\nthank you enough–”",
        "“Rid me of her,” said the girl swiftly. “But not–not him. You must\nswear–what is it that Christians swear by?” she broke off to\ndemand. “By the grave of your father? Yes? You will swear not to\nhurt him, to hurt Hamdi, by the grave of your father? Yes?”",
        "Ryder nodded quickly. His father, to be sure, was in no grave at\nall. He was, allowing hastily for the difference in time, in his\ntreasurer’s cage at the bank in East Middleton, but he did not wait\nto explain this to the girl.",
        "“I swear it,” he repeated. “I won’t hurt your Hamdi, since that’s\nyour condition. But we’re wasting time–”",
        "“Up, then. And if you fall down–do like this.”",
        "Smiling mischievously, she made the gesture of swimming. “Allah go\nwith thee–and with me also,” he heard her murmur, as he stepped out\nto the ledge of the entrance, twisted himself agilely about and\nclimbing up the opened gate swung himself up to the stone carving\noverhead.",
        "Below him, he heard the gate swing shut. He did not hear her lock\nit. Fervently he hoped she had not, since it was a possible exit for\nany one in a hurry, but at any rate, he need not worry about a way\nout of the place until he had got into it again.",
        "And the getting in was not any too simple. It was work for a\nmountain goat, he reflected, after a short interval devoted to\ntentative reaches and balancing and digging in of hands and feet.\nThe distances were far greater than the first-glimpsed,\nforeshortened perspective had allowed him to guess, and there was\nonly the starlight to illumine the gray face of the palace.",
        "He had no idea of the time. Somewhere about the middle of the night\nor early morning, he judged vaguely by the stars, although it seemed\nimpossible that so few hours had passed.",
        "The river was all silence and darkness. No nuggars with their\nsleeping crews were moored below. He seemed the only living,\nbreathing thing clambering across the face of time and space.",
        "Gingerly he kicked off the nondescript black shoes he had worn with\nhis disguise that afternoon and essayed a perilous toehold while he\nreached for the interstices of a mashrubiyeh window just overhead.",
        "Once gripping the rounds he pulled himself up, reflecting that it\nwas well it was night and that no lady was sitting within her\nshelter to be affrighted at this intrusion of fingers and toes.",
        "From the jutting top of this projection he surveyed his further\nfield of operation. The window with a light was two stories higher\nyet and to the right. There were two other windows with lights on\nthe second story, very much farther along, and he wondered painfully\nif these were the rooms of Aimée.",
        "That boudoir in which he had hidden through the end of the long\nreception had been upon the water. And there had been a door into an\nadjoining room, for he had seen a sallow-faced attendant passing in\nand out.",
        "A wild longing seized him to crawl on and over into those windows.\nBut it was a difficult, almost an impossible distance, and even when\nthere he would be like a fly on the outside of a pane with no way of\ngetting in.",
        "The unknown girl had promised him a way through her window and he\nhad confidence in her ingenuity and daring.",
        "So he went on, worming cautiously along old gutters and ledges and\njutting balconies until at last he was clasping the lower grill of\nthat mashrubiyeh from which her light gleamed.",
        "Instantly the light went out.",
        "“Wait!” he heard her voice say sharply over his head. She was\nstanding by the window fumbling with the woodwork, and in a moment\nhe heard the click of a knob and then, just opposite his head, the\nscreening grill slipped aside and an aperture appeared.",
        "“Quick!” admonished the voice, and quickly indeed he drew himself up\nand in, reflecting whimsically as he did so that this girl had first\nhelped him out of a hole and then into one.",
        "The next moment she had moved the grill into place and lifted the\ncover she had placed over her triplet of candles on a stand.",
        "Triumphant, her eyes dancing, her teeth a gleam of light between\nthose scarlet lips of hers, she looked at him for the admiration\nshe saw twinkling back at her in his eyes.",
        "“But not me–no!” she protested, her supple hands gesturing towards\nthe magic casement. “I found it here. It is very old–you\nunderstand? Some other, long ago, found time dull and so–”",
        "Delightedly she shared the flavor of that secret of the vagabond\nlady of long ago who had devised this cunning entrance for her\nlover.",
        "On some dark night like this, with the gatekeeper drowsy with old\nwine, some other stripling had climbed that worn façade before him\nand slipped through the secret space and stood triumphantly before\nsome daring, laughing girl who had cast aside for him her veil and\nher fear of death.",
        "What ingenuity, Ryder wondered fleetly, had smuggled in the\ncarpenter for the contrivance, what jewels had gone to the bribing,\nwhat lies had been told!... And what had been the end of it all?",
        "Evidently not the discovery of the opening....",
        "He hoped, with singular intensity, for the safety of the daring\nyoung lovers, that unknown youth whose feet had foreworn the path\nfor his feet and that dead and gone young girl, who had dared\nanything rather than endure the mortal ennui of those hours behind\nthe veil....",
        "These thoughts all went through him like one thought as he stood\nthere, his eyes roving about the dim, shadowy room of old divans and\nEastern hangings, and then turning back to the glimmering figure of\nits mistress.",
        "She was staring frankly at him, her eyes boldly curious and\nexamining. They were not dark eyes, he saw now; that had been the\nimpression given by the kohl about them and the black line of the\nbrows penciled into one line; they were yellow eyes, golden and\nglowing, scornful and lazy-lidded.",
        "As she looked at him, these eyes smiled slowly. She was seeing in\nthis lover of her rival a singularly delightful looking young man,\nfor all his dust and disarray, a slender, bronzed, hardy-looking\nyoung man, with dark, disordered hair straying across a white brow,\nand audacious, eager eyes in which the fear of death, so lately\nglimpsed, had left no daunting refection.",
        "Slowly she lifted her hand and with deliberate softness put back\nthat straying hair of his.",
        "“Poor boy,” she said slowly in English, and then, smiling ruefully,\nshe held out her hands for his inspection. The grime of the bricks\nhad discolored their scented delicacy and he saw bruised finger tips\nand a torn nail.",
        "“I’m infernally sorry,” he said quickly.",
        "Her smile deepened at his look of concern, as he held, a little\nhelplessly, the witnesses of her work of rescue which seemed somehow\nto stray into his keeping.",
        "“It is nothing–but you–poor boy,” she said again, in that English\nof which she seemed naïvely proud.",
        "“If you could give me some water,” he suggested, and drank deep\nwith delight the last drop she brought him from an earthen jar. It\nseemed to wash from his throat the taste of that dust and fear.",
        "“I can’t begin to thank you,” he murmured. “I only wish that I could\ndo something for you–”",
        "She looked up at him. They were standing close together, their\nvoices cautiously low.",
        "“Perhaps, yes, you can–”",
        "“It’s not doing anything for you to save Aimée,” he told her.\n\"That’s what you are doing for her and for me.... But if ever you\nwant me for anything after this–my name is Ryder, Jack Ryder, and\nyou can reach me at the Agricultural Bank.”",
        "He had a vague vision of some day repaying his enormous debt by\nassisting this girl, grown tired of her Hamdi, out of this aperture\nand into a waiting boat. He would do it like a shot, he told himself\ngladly; he would do anything on God’s green earth if only she helped\nhim get Aimée away from that infernal villain.",
        "“Jack,” she repeated, under her breath, and then in her slow\nEnglish, “I like–Jack.”",
        "“Don’t forget it. I’ll always come and do anything for you. And if\nyou’ll tell me your name–”",
        "“Aziza.”",
        "“Aziza. I’ll never forget that. And now, if you’ll tell me how I can\nget to her and then the best way out–”",
        "“Why you so hurry–”",
        "“Why?” he looked a little blank. “I can’t lose a minute–he may be\nwith her–”",
        "She came a little nearer to him, her head tilting back with a slow,\nindolent challenge.",
        "Gone was the silken mantle that had been about her below stairs and\nhe saw now that she was a vivid, exotic shimmer of gauzy green\nagainst the saffron veil that fell from her henna hair. There was\nbarbaric beauty in her, in the bold, painted face, the bare,\ngold-banded arms, the slender, sinuous lines, and there was barbaric\nsplendor in the heavy jewels that winked and flashed....",
        "It struck Ryder that she was gotten up regardless.... In pride,\nperhaps, on her rival’s wedding night?... Or had there been some\ndefiant, desperate design upon Hamdi–?",
        "She did not miss that sudden prolonging of his look upon her.",
        "“You like me–yes?” she murmured, and then slipping back into\nthe vernacular, “I–I am not the stupid veiled girl of the\nseclusion–not forever. I come from the west, the deserts. I have\nseen the world: Men–men, I know ... I danced before them, not the\ndances of the Cairene cafés,” she uttered with swift scorn, “but the\ndance of the two swords, the dance of the serpents.... Men threw the\ngold from their turbans about my feet when I had danced to them ...\nAnd others, English, French–”",
        "She broke off, but her eyes told many things. “Then–Hamdi,” she\nsaid slowly. “Him I ruled–and his palace.... But I have known other\nthings.”",
        "Closer yet she came to him. Her eyes, golden fires of eyes, were\nsmiling up into his, her scarlet lips gathered in soft, sensual\ncurves ... her whole silken scented body seemed to slip into his\nembrace. A bare arm touched his neck, resting heavily.",
        "“Sweet–heart,” she said slowly, in her difficult English.",
        "It was the deuce of a position.",
        "No man can rudely snatch from his neck the arm of the lady who has\njust saved him from a harrowing death. And a lady who was risking\nmore than her life in sheltering him–decidedly the situation was\ndelicate.",
        "It was not the lady’s fault that her impetuosity, the impetuosity\nwhich had been his salvation, now plunged her into amorous caprice.\nThere were obvious handicaps, moral, social and ethical, in her\nupbringing. She was a child of nature, a nature undisciplined,\nunruly, tempestuous.",
        "And even queening over Hamdi and his palace must have offered little\ndiversion to a wild dancing girl familiar with the excitement of\nmore varied conquest.",
        "Ryder was horribly embarrassed. He was visited with a fearful\nconstraint, a chivalrous wish not to hurt her feelings, and a sharp\nprevision of the danger of offending her.",
        "He took the first turn of least resistance.",
        "He did not need to bend his head; their eyes were on a level. He\nsimply kissed her. And she kissed him back.",
        "He hated himself for the leap of his blood... and for the\nPuritanical discomfort of his nature....",
        "Her arm about his neck was pressing closer. It was the moment for\naction and Ryder acted. Very firmly he put his hand upon her hand,\nwithdrew it from its clasp about him, and raised it to his lips.",
        "His kiss was respectful gratitude and an abdication of the delights\nof dalliance.",
        "“Good-bye, my dear,” he murmured. “Now, if you will show me the way\nout–”",
        "Her eyes agleam between half-closed lids, she studied him. It\noccurred to Ryder that probably never before had her hands been\ndetached–and kissed–and put away. He must be a phenomenon, an\nenigma.",
        "Then her lips parted in a faintly scornful smile.",
        "“You afraid–you? You want–run?”",
        "“I’m horribly afraid,” he said earnestly. “I want to get out of here\nas quick as I can.”",
        "That was putting, he considered, the very wisest construction upon\nit.",
        "Negligently her gesture reminded him of the opening in the window.\n\"Here you are safe.” she murmured in the vernacular. “And the doors\nare locked–”",
        "“Yes, but–but Aimée isn’t safe, you know–and I must get her out of\nhere.”",
        "“Aimée?” In those yellow eyes he caught the flash of capricious\nresentment at the reminder. Then, indifferently, she brushed the\ndistraction away.",
        "“There is time enough for Aimée. She is not lonely now.”",
        "“Not lonely?” he shivered at the cold carelessness of her tone. “I\nmust get to her quickly then.”",
        "“But that is not safe.... A little–later.”",
        "Uncomfortably he tried to infuse his glance with innate innocence\nand utter lack of understanding.",
        "“I shan’t hurt him–if I have the chance,” he told her. “I’ve given\nyou my word–”",
        "“And I trust you–much.” Her gaze sought his in a trifle of\nimpatience at such simplicity. “But it is not safe for you now....\nLater ... By and by.”",
        "“You don’t want him to have a chance to make love to her, do you?\"\nsaid Ryder sharply. “I thought that was the very thing you\ndidn’t–”",
        "Her smile was a subtle, confessing caress. “I shall have my\nrevenge,” she murmured, and pressed closer to him again, every\nsensuous, sumptuous line of her a challenge and an enticement.",
        "“I give you life,” she whispered, very low in her throat. “You give\nme, perhaps, an hour–?”",
        "“I haven’t an hour,” said Ryder very desperately and unhappily.\n\"Not when Aimée is with that devil–”",
        "It took every thought of Aimée to get the words out.",
        "He felt a brute about it, a low, ungrateful dog. She had given him\nlife and every fiber in him clamored to save her pride and champion\nher caprice.",
        "It seemed so dastardly to wrench away from her now, like some\nself-centered Joseph, leaving that beastly stab in her vanity....\nAnd she was a stunning creature, lawless, elemental, hot and cold\nlike the seventh wind of the inferno....",
        "But it was Aimée who was in his blood like a fever.... Aimée, that\nfrail white rose of a girl, in her bonds of terror....",
        "He saw the flame in Aziza’s eyes. He saw the stiffening of her\ndefiance, of half-incredulous affront. Then, her form drawn up, her\nbared arms outflung, her vivid, painted, furious face challenging\nhim. “I am not beautiful–like Aimée?” she said in a voice of venom,\nand in the English, for double measure, “You not like me–no?”",
        "“You are beautiful and I do like you,” Ryder combated, feeling a\nbungling fool. And then went on to thrust into that half-second of\nsuspended fury, a faint breath of appeasing. “But–don’t you\nsee–it’s my duty–”",
        "“You go–?” she said clearly.",
        "Even in that moment he had a sharp prescience of the unwisdom of his\nrejection. A cold calculator of chance and probabilities would have\nreckoned that a half hour of assuagement here would have been a\nwiser investment of his mortal moments than any virtuous plunge into\nsingle-hearted duty.",
        "But Ryder did not calculate. He could not, with Aimée under that\nbeast’s hand. His heart and soul were possessed with her danger and\nhis heart and soul carried his body instinctively back from the\ndancing girl’s advance, and he whispered, “I must go. There is no\ntime–”",
        "She flung back her fiery-hued head with a gesture of intolerable\nrage. Her eyes were lightnings.",
        "“Dog of a Christian!” she said chokingly and flew to the doors.",
        "Back she thrust the heavy hangings, turning a quick key in the lock\nand wrenching the door wide. And before Ryder could understand,\nbefore he could bring himself to realize that she was not simply\nviolently expelling him from her room, she gave a shriek that rang\nwildly down the long-unseen corridors.",
        "At the top of her lungs, with one hand out to thrust him back or\ncling to him if he attempted to pass, she shrieked again and again.",
        "Instantly there came a running of feet.",
        "AN INTERRUPTION",
        "When Hamdi Bey had taken Aimée back to her apartments he pulled\nsharply upon a bellcord. In a few moments the slave woman, Fatima,\nmade her appearance, no kindly-eyed old crone like Miriam, but a\nsallow, furtive-faced creature, with an old disfiguring scar across\na cheek.",
        "The general pointed to the wet and fainting girl huddling weakly\nupon the divan.",
        "“Your new mistress has met with an accident, out boating–a curse\nupon me for gratifying forbidden caprice!” he said crisply. “Be\nsilent of this and array her quickly in garments of rest. I will\nreturn.”",
        "Very hurriedly he took himself and his own wet condition away. He\nwas furious, through and through. What a night–what a wedding\nnight! Scandal and frustration... a bride with a desperate lover...\na bride who, herself, drew revolvers and threatened.",
        "It was beyond any old tale of the palace. For less, girls had had\nhis father’s dagger driven through their hearts–his grandfather, at\na mere whisper from a eunuch, had given his favorite to the lion.\nThe whisper was found incorrect at a later–too late–date, and the\neunuch had furnished the lion another meal.",
        "His modern leniency in this case would have outraged his ancestors.",
        "But it was not in the bey’s nature to deal the finishing stroke to\nanything so soft and lovely as Aimée. He had no intention of\ndepriving himself of her. If she were red with guilt he would feign\nbelief in her, to save his face until his infatuation was gratified.",
        "But actually he did not believe in any great guilt of hers. Tewfick\nPasha, for all his indulgent modernity, would keep too strict a\nharem for that. What he rather believed, had happened was that the\nyoung American–now so happily immured in his masonry–had become\naware of the girl through the story of her French father, and in\nthat connection had struck up the clandestine and romantic\ncorrespondence which had led to their mutual infatuation and his\ndesperate venture there that afternoon.",
        "The young man had been dealt with–and the thought of the very\nsummary and competent way he had been dealt with drew the fangs from\nthe bite of that night’s invasion.",
        "His fury felt soothingly glutted.",
        "He had been a match for them both. He recalled his own subtlety and\nagility with a genuine smile as he exchanged his dripping uniform\nfor more informal trousers and a house coat. He had taught that\nyoung man a lesson–a final and ultimate lesson. And he was\nbeginning to teach one to that girl. Before he was done with\nher ...",
        "He felt for her a mingled passion for her beauty and a lust for\nconquest of her resistant spirit that fed every base and cruel\ninstinct of his nature.",
        "A find–a rare find–even with her circumvented lover! He would have\nhis sport with her.... But though he promised this to himself with\nfeline relish, apprehension and chagrin were still working.",
        "The fond fatuity with which he had welcomed that starry-eyed little\ncreature had been rudely overthrown. And his pride smarted at the\nidea of the whispers that might echo and re-echo through his palace.\nHe was too wise an old hand to flatter himself that it would\npreserve its bland and silent unawareness of this night.",
        "So far, he believed, he had been unobserved. In Yussuf’s silence he\nhad absolute confidence.... But of course there were a hundred other\nchances–some spying, back-stairs eye, some curious, straining\near....",
        "And for this matter of the boating mishap–he cursed himself now, as\nhe combed up his fair mustaches and settled a scarlet fez upon his\nthinned thatch of graying hair, cursed himself roundly for his\nmalicious resort to that old oubliette. Anything else would have\ndone to frighten and overwhelm her and yet he had gratified his\ndramatic itch–and now had paid for it with that idiotic story of\nthe boating expedition.",
        "He had reason to trust Fatima–there was history behind the old\nsword scar upon her cheek, and he had a hold over her through her\nambition for a son. But Fatima was a woman. And she–or some other\nwho would see that drenched satin would be curious of that boating\nstory....",
        "And of course they could find out from the boatman.",
        "It occurred to him to go and see the boatman and order him away so\nthat afterward the man could say he had been sent off duty, and the\nstory of a nocturnal river trip would not appear too incredible. It\nwas a small concession to stop gossip’s mouth.",
        "So drawing on a swinging military cloak, the general stole down\nthrough the stair of the water entrance into the lower hall, where\nthe pale light gleamed through the cross-barred iron of the gate and\nthe gatekeeper slept like a log in his muffling cloak.",
        "The soundness of that slumber–loudly attested by the fumes of\nwine–afforded the general a profound pleasure. He took the man’s\nkeys softly, and went to the gate; it afforded him less pleasure to\nobserve that the gate was unlocked, but he put this down to the\nkeeper’s muddleheadedness.",
        "Carefully he turned the lock and pocketed the keys–for a lesson to\nthe man’s overdeep sleep in the morning and to attest his own\npresence there that night; then he went back and brought out an oar,\nwhich he placed conspicuously beside the smallest boat, drawn up\njust within the gates.",
        "He was afraid to alter the boat’s position lest the noise should\nprove too wakening, but he considered he had laid an artistic\nfoundation for his story and with a gratifying sense of triumph he\nmounted the stairs.",
        "He was not conscious of fatigue. He had always been a wiry,\nindefatigable person, and the alarms and emotions of this night had\ncleared his head of its wines and drowsiness. He felt the sense of\ntense, highstrung power which came to him in war, in fighting, in\nany element of danger.",
        "Youth! He snapped his fingers at it. Youth was buried in\nhis masonry–and helpless in its shuttered room. Power was\nmaster–power, craft, subtlety.",
        "But his elation ebbed as he crossed again that long drawing room\nwith its faded flowers about the marriage throne, and its abandoned\ntable with its cloth askew, its crystal disarrayed, its candles\ngutted and spent.",
        "The memory of that insolent moment when a man’s hand had gripped\nhim, had whirled him from Aimée–when a man’s voice and gun had\nthreatened him–that memory was too overpowering for even his\ntriumph over the invader to lay wholly its smart of outrage.",
        "He felt again the tightening of his nerves, like quivering wires, as\nhe crossed the violated reception room and entered the boudoir. It\nwas empty, but on the divan the flickering candle light revealed the\ndamp, spreading stain where Aimée’s drenched satins had been.",
        "He thrust aside a hanging and pushed open the door into the room\nbeyond.",
        "It was a small bedroom evidently very recently furnished in new and\nwhite shining lacquer of French design, elaborately inlaid with\npainted porcelains and draped with a profusion of rosy taffeta.\nAmong this elegance, surprisingly unrelated to the ancient paneled\nwalls, stood the hastily opened trunk and bags of the bride, their\nraised lids and disarranged trays heaped with the confusion of\nunaccustomed, swiftly searching hands.",
        "Aimée herself, in a gay little French boudoir robe of jade and\ncitron, sat huddled in a chair, like a mute, terrified child, in the\nhand of her dresser, who was shaking out the long, damp hair and\nfanning it with a peacock fan.",
        "At the bey’s entrance Fatima suspended the fanning, but with easy\nfamiliarity exhibited the long ringlets.",
        "Curtly the bey nodded, and gestured in dismissal; the woman laid\ndown her fan, and with a last slant-eyed look at that strangely\nstill new mistress she went noiselessly out a small service door.",
        "With an air of negligent assurance Hamdi Bey gazed about the room\nand yawned. “Truly a fatiguing evening,” he remarked in his dry,\nsardonic voice. “But you look so untouched! What a thing is radiant\nyouth.”",
        "He sauntered over to her, who drew a little closer together at his\napproach, and lifted one of the long dark curls that the serving\nwoman had exhibited.",
        "“The ringlets of loveliness,” he murmured. “You know the old saying\nof the Sadi? ’The ringlets of the lovely are a chain on the feet of\nreason and a snare for the bird of wisdom.’... How long ago he said\nit–and how true to-day ... Yet such a charming chain! Suppose,\nthen, I forgive you, little one, since sages have forgiven beauty\nbefore?”",
        "She was silent, her eyes fixed on him with the silent terror with\nwhich a trapped bird sees its captor, in their bright darkness the\nsame mute apprehension, the same filming of helpless despair.",
        "Ryder was dead, she thought. This cruel, incensed old madman had\nkilled him, for all his oaths. Somewhere beneath those ancient\nstones he was lying drowned and dead, a strange, pitiable addition\nto the dark secrets of those grim walls.",
        "He had died for her sake, and all that she asked now of life, she\nthought in the utter agony of her youth, was death. And very\nquickly.",
        "“I am so soft hearted,” he sighed, still with that ringlet in his\nlifted hand, his hand which wanted palpably to settle upon her and\nyet was withheld by some strange inhibition of those fixed, helpless\neyes. “Who knows–perhaps I may forgive you yet? You might persuade\nme–”",
        "“He is dead,” she said shiveringly.",
        "“Dead? He?... Ah, the invader, the intruder, the young man who\nwanted you for a family in France!” The bey laughed gratingly. “No,\nI assure you he is not dead–I have not harmed a hair of his head.\nHe is alive–only not with quite the widest range of liberty–”",
        "He broke off to laugh again. “Ah, you disbelieve?” he said politely.\n\"Shall I send, then, for some proof–an ear, perhaps, or a little\nfinger, still very warm and bleeding, to convince you?... In five\nminutes it will be here.”",
        "Then terror stirred again in her frozen heart. If Ryder were alive\nand still in this man’s power–",
        "“You are horrible,” she said to him in a voice that was suddenly\nclear and unshaken. “What is it you want of me–fear and hate–and\nutter loathing?”",
        "Her unexpected spirit was briefly disconcerting. The Turk looked\ndown upon her in arrested irony and then he smiled beneath his\nmustaches and bent nearer with kindling gaze.",
        "“Not at all–nothing at all like that, little dove with talons. I\nwant sweetness and repentance–and submission. And–”",
        "“You have a strange way to win them,” she said desperately.",
        "“You have taken a strange way with me, my love! Little did I\nforesee, when I escorted you up the stairs this morning–” He broke\noff. “There are men,” he reminded her, “who would not consider a\ncold bath as a complete recompense for your bridal plans.”",
        "She was silent.",
        "“But I,” he murmured, “I am soft hearted.” He dropped on one knee\nbefore her and tried to smile into her averted face. “I can never\nresist a charming penitent.... I assure you I am pliability itself\nin delicate fingers–although iron and steel to a threatening\nhand.... If you should woo me very sweetly, little one–”",
        "She could not overcome and she could not hide from his mocking eyes\nthe sick shrinking that drew her back from his least touch. But she\ndid fight down the wild hysteria of her repugnance so that her voice\nwas not the trembling gasp it wanted to be.",
        "“How can I know what you are?” she told him. “You mock me–you\nthreaten to torture that man–it would be folly not to think that\nyou are deceiving me. If you would only prove to me so that I could\nbelieve–”",
        "“If you would but prove to me so that I could believe–! Prove\nthat you are mine–and not that infidel’s. Prove that you bring me a\nwife’s devotion–not a wanton’s indifference.” He caught her cold\nhands, trying to draw her forward to him. “Prove that you only pity\nhim,” he whispered, “but that your love will be mine–”",
        "She felt as if a serpent clasped her. And yet, if that were the only\nway to win Ryder’s safety–if it were possible for her sickened\nsenses to allay this madman’s suspicions and undermine his revenge–",
        "Quiveringly she thought that to save Ryder she would go through\nfire.",
        "But the hideous, mocking uncertainties! Her utter helplessness–her\nlost deference....",
        "It was not a sudden sound that broke in upon them but rather the\nperception of many sounds, muffled, half heard, but gaining upon\ntheir consciousness. Running feet–a stifled voice–something faint\nand shrill–",
        "Aimée sprang to her feet; the general rose with her and turned his\nhead inquiringly in the direction. Then he jerked open the door\nthrough which Fatima had disappeared; it led to a dark service\ncorridor and small anteroom, from whose bed the attendant was\nabsent. An outer door was ajar.",
        "No need to question the sounds now. Faint, but piercingly shrill\nshrieks were sounding from above, while the footsteps were racing,\nsome down, some up–",
        "The bey flung shut the door behind him and hurried towards the\nconfusion.",
        "BEYOND THE DOOR",
        "Ryder had stood stock still with amazement when the girl began to\nscream. She had gone mad, he thought for an instant, in masculine\nbewilderment, and then her madness revealed its treacherous cunning,\nfor she began crying wildly for help against an invader, an infidel,\na dog of a Christian who had stolen into her rooms.",
        "She had chucked him to the lions, Ryder perceived; one furious flash\nof lightning jealousy and Oriental anger had overthrown, in that\nwild and lawless head, every other design for him for which she had\nrisked so much.",
        "He had scorned her.... He had flouted her caprice.... He had dared\nto refuse the languors of those dangerous eyes....",
        "The hurrying footsteps appeared to him the tread of a legion in\naction, and he had no desire to rush out upon the oncomers; he had,\nindeed, distinct doubts of his ruthless ability to pass that supple,\nclawing, incensed creature at the door.",
        "He whirled and made a bolt for the window, striking at the fastened\ngrill. He heard the snapping of wooden bolts and the splintering of\nwood and out through the hole he climbed to a precipitous, head-long\nflight that fairly felt the clutching hands upon his ankle.",
        "He had meant to make a jump for it. A three-story plunge into the\nNile appeared a gentle exercise compared to the alternative within\nthe palace, but in the very act of releasing his hold he changed his\nmind.",
        "Quicker than he had ever moved before, in any vicissitude of his\nlithe and agile youth, he clambered up, not down, and crouching back\nfrom sight upon the jutting top of the window, he sent his coat\nsailing violently through space.",
        "He dared not look over for its descent upon the water, for other\nheads were peering from below and he could hear an excited outburst\nof speech, that broke sharply off.",
        "Evidently they were hurrying down to the water gate. Swiftly he\nutilized this misdirection for his own ends.",
        "The roofs. That was the refuge to make for. Flat, long-reaching\nroofs, from which one could climb off onto a wall or a palm or a\nside street.",
        "He had only a story to ascend and he made it in record time, fearful\nthat the searchers whom he heard now launching a boat below would\nturn their eyes skywards.",
        "But he gained the top without an outcry being raised and found\nhimself upon the roof where the ladies of the harem took their air\nunseen of any save the blind eyes of the muezzin in the Sultan\nmosque upon the hill. There were divans and a little taboret or two\nand a framework where an awning could be raised against the sun.",
        "There was also a trap door.",
        "And here, tempestuously he changed his mind again. He abandoned the\ngoal of outer walls and chances of escape. He wrenched violently at\nthat trap door. It was bolted but the bolt was an ancient one and\ngave at his furious exertions, letting him down into a narrow spiral\nstaircase between walls.",
        "Down he plunged in haste, before some confused searcher should dash\nup. It was no place to meet an opposing force. Nor was the corridor\nin which he found himself much better.",
        "It was black and baffling as a labyrinth, with unexpected turnings,\nand he kept gingerly close to the wall with one hand clutching a bit\nof iron which he had taken into his possession and his pocket when\nAziza had led him out of the underground walls–the very bit of\npointed iron, it was, with which the volatile creature had effected\nhis rescue.",
        "He considered it an invaluable souvenir and twice, in his nervous\napprehension, he almost brought it down upon shadows.",
        "Direction he judged vaguely by the screaming which was still going\non at a tremendous rate–evidently the girl had gone off into\ngenuine hysterics or else she had determined not to leave her\nagitation at the intrusion in any manner of question. No doubt the\noutcries were a relief to her mingled emotions–remorse at her\nimpetuosity and chagrin that her thwarted plans might conceivably be\nnow among those emotions–and since the vicinity of those shrieks\nmust be a gathering place to be avoided by him he stole on, down the\nupper hall, and finding a stair, he went down for two continuous\nflights.",
        "Aimée’s rooms, he knew, had been upon the water, and recalling the\ngeneral direction of those two lighted windows that he had seen so\nrecently from without, his excavator’s instinct led him on. Once he\nsaw the flitting figure of a turbaned woman in time to draw back\ninto a heaven-sent niche and again he flattened into a soundless\nshadow against the wall as two young serving girls ran by on\nslippered feet, their anklets tinkling, chattering to each other in\ndelighted excitement.",
        "And then the stealthy opening of a door–it was the very door by\nwhich Yussuf had precipitated himself upon the struggle at the\nsupper table some age-long hours ago–gave him a glimpse into the\nfar glooms of the reception room, where its long side of mashrubiyeh\nwindows revealed now between its fretwork tiny chinks of a paling\nsky.",
        "He could make out the dark-draped marriage throne and the pallor of\nthe disordered cloth upon the abandoned table below, and behind the\ntable the dark draperies of the remaining portières before the\ndoorway into the boudoir where he had hidden himself and into which\nhe had last seen Aimée thrust.",
        "At the other end of the great room were the entrance stairs to the\nharem, and there, he imagined, a watchman was stationed, or else\nstout bolts and bars were guarding the situation. There remained an\narched doorway into other formal rooms through which he had seen\nAimée and the guests disappear for the wedding supper, and that way\nled, he surmised, down into the service quarters.",
        "A sorry choice of exits! He could form no plan in advance but trust\nblindly to the amazing chances of adventure. And first, before he\nrushed for escape, there was Aimée to find.",
        "Yet for all the mad hazard of the situation he was elated with life.\nHe felt as if he had never fully lived until now, when every breath\nwas informed with the sharp prescience of danger. He was at once\ncool and exultant, wary yet reckless, with the joyous recklessness\nof utter desperation.",
        "With cat-like care he surveyed the drawing-room; it appeared\ndeserted but as he watched his tense nerves could see the shadows\nforming, taking furtive, crouching shape–and then dissolving\nharmlessly into a rug, a chair, or a stirring drapery. His eyes\ngrown used to the dimness he identified the mantle upon the floor in\nwhich he had come and which he had extended to Aimée in that brief\nmoment of fatuous triumph, and beyond it, across a chair, was the\nportière which the black had torn down from the doorway to wrap\nabout Ryder’s helpless form as he had carried him down to living\ndeath.",
        "That mantle, he thought, might yet be useful, and he stole forward\nand recovered it, but, as he straightened, another shadow darted out\nfrom the boudoir door and silhouetted for an instant against the\nlighted, room he saw a figure in a long, swinging military cloak.",
        "Discovery was inevitable and Ryder made a swift plunge to take the\ncloaked figure by surprise, but even as one hand shot out and\ngripped the throat while the other held his threatening iron aloft,\nhis clutch relaxed, his arm fell nervelessly at his side.",
        "For from the figure had come the broken gasp of a soft voice, and\nthe face upturned to his was a pale oval under dark, disordered\nhair.",
        "“Aimée!” he breathed in exultant, still half-incredulous joy.\n\"Aimée!... Did I hurt you–?”",
        "“Oh, no, no!” came Aimée’s shaken voice. “Oh, you are safe!”",
        "He felt her trembling in his clasp and he swept her close to him.\nFor one breathless instant they clung together, in a sharp,\npassionate gladness which blurred every sense of dread or danger.\nThey were safe–they were together–and for the moment it was\nenough. Every obstacle was surmounted, every terror conquered.",
        "They clung, obliviously, like children, her pale face against his\nshoulder, her hair brushing his lips, her wild heartbeats throbbing\nagainst his own.",
        "Then the girl, remembering, lifted her head.",
        "“Quick–we must go,” she whispered. “For there I made a fire–”",
        "He fallowed her frightened, backward glance at the boudoir door and\nsuddenly saw its cracks and key hole strangely radiant with light.",
        "“He left me, to go to those screams,” she was saying rapidly. “I\ntried to run that way–and found that woman coming back. And I told\nher to wait–in her own room–and I slipped back in there–and\nsuddenly it came to me to thrust the candle about. I thought I would\nrun out and if I met any one I would call, ’Fire’, and say the\ngeneral was burning and perhaps in the confusion–”",
        "The terrible desperation of her both stirred and wrung him. She was\nso little, so helpless, so trembling in his clasp ... so made for\nlove and tenderness.... And to think of her in such fear and horror\nthat she went thrusting reckless candles into her hangings, setting\na palace on fire in the blind fury for escape....",
        "To such work had this night brought her.... This night, and three\nmen–for he and the craven Tewfick and the fanatic bey were all\nlinked in this night’s work. Yes, and another man–and he thought\nswiftly, in a lightning flash of wonder, how little that Paul\nDelcassé had known when he set his eager face toward the Old World,\nwith his wife and baby with him, that he was setting his feet into\nsuch a web ... that his wife would die, languishing in a pasha’s\nharem, and his little daughter would one night be flying in mad\nterror from the cruel beast the weak pasha had sold her to!",
        "And how little, for that matter, he had known when he had set his\nown face toward those same sands what secrets he would discover\nthere and what forbidden ways his heart would know.",
        "These thoughts all went through him like one thought, in some clear,\nremote background of his mind, while he was swiftly drawing on the\nmilitary cloak she gave him and wrapping her in the black mantle.\nThere was a veil on the mantle’s hood that she could fling across\nher face when she wished, but Ryder had no fez to complete the\ndeceptive outline of his masquerade. He must trust to the dark and\nto the concealment of the high, military collar of the cloak.",
        "“Do you know a way?” he whispered and at her shaken head, “The water\ngate,” he said, thinking swiftly.",
        "There would be a crowd now about the gate, but if they could only\nmanage to gain those cellars and hide somewhere they could steal out\nlater upon that waterman.",
        "It seemed the most feasible of all the desperate plans. The roofs\nmight be a trap. The harem entrance led into a garden and the garden\nwas guarded by an impassable wall. But if he could only get to the\nriver he knew that he was a strong enough swimmer to save Aimée, or\nhe might even terrorize the watchman into furnishing a boat.",
        "She did not question but guided him swiftly through the arch that\nled down into the banqueting hall. Twice that day she had gone down\nthose stairs. Once in her bridal state, her eyes shining, her cheeks\nglowing with the wild joy of Ryder’s arrival and dreams of escape,\nand again, scarcely an hour gone by, she had descended them, tense\nand desperate, her revolver at the general’s head, seeking vainly\nRyder’s rescue.",
        "And now a third time, a guilty, reckless fugitive in the night, she\nstole down those stairs into the many-columned hall where she had\nbeen fêted in state among her guests. Here her only knowledge was of\nthe stone corridor and the locked door through which the bey had led\nher, but Ryder knew the way that Aziza had brought him and he turned\ncautiously toward those wide, curving stairs.",
        "Keeping Aimée a few steps behind him, he went down the soft carpet\nand peered out at the bottom towards the water gate. He saw no bars;\nthe gate was open and against the pale square of the water were the\nblack silhouettes of the general and the gateman, both leaning out\nat some splashing in the river.",
        "He knew a boy’s reckless impulse to shove them both in. It was an\nunholy thought his better judgment rejected–unless driven to\nit–yet some prankish element in his roused recklessness would not\nhave deplored the necessity.",
        "If they looked about–!",
        "But they did not stir as, with Aimée’s cold hand in his, he made the\ntiptoed descent and slipped softly about the corner of the steps.\nThen, instead of going on down the hall to some hiding place in the\nruins, he took a suddenly revealed, sharper turn into a narrow\npassage just beyond the stairs.",
        "It might lead to another gate, some service entrance, perhaps, it\nran so straight and direct between its walls.",
        "Intuitively that excavator’s sense of his defined the direction.\nThey were going parallel with the river, although a little way back\nfrom the water wall, and in the direction of the men’s part of the\npalace, the selamlik.",
        "He recalled the selamlik vaguely as an irregular mass of buildings,\nand though the formal entrance was of course through the garden from\nthe avenue, there was a narrow side street or lane leading back to\nthe water’s edge between this part of the palace and the nest\nbuilding, and very likely there was some entrance on that lane.",
        "Bitterly he blamed himself for his lack of complete inspection that\nmorning. To be sure he had told himself, then, as he strolled about\nthe high garden walls and peered down the narrow lane on one side of\nthe Nile backwaters, that he didn’t need a map of the place for his\narrival at an afternoon reception; he was simply going in and out,\nand clothes and speech were his only real concern.",
        "He had even said to himself that he might not reveal himself to\nAimée–if she did not discover him. He wanted merely to see her\nagain, and be sure that she understood her own history–he had no\nnotion of attempting any further relations with her, any resumption\nof their forbidden and dangerous acquaintance.",
        "And it was true that had been the defiant and protesting surface of\nhis thoughts, but deep within himself there had always been that\nhot, hidden spark, ready to kindle to a flame at her word–and with\nit the unowned, secret longing that she would speak the word.",
        "And when she had called on him for help, when the trembling appeal\nhad sprung past her stricken pride, and he had seen the terror in\nher soft, child’s eyes, then the spark had struck its conflagration.\nHe had become nothing but a hot, headstrong fury of devotion.",
        "And he said to himself now that he might have known it was going to\nhappen, and that if he had not been so concerned that morning about\nsaving his face and preserving this fiction of indifference he would\nknow a little more about the labyrinth they were poking about\nin–the little more that tips the scale between safety and\ndestruction.",
        "But he did not know and blind Chance was his only goddess.",
        "The passage had brought him to a wall and a narrow stairs while\nanother passage led off to the right, apparently to the forward\nregions of the place.",
        "He took the stairs. He had had enough of underground regions when\nthey did not lead to water gates and the stairs promised novelty at\nleast.",
        "He wished he knew more about Turkish palaces. He supposed they had a\nfairly consistent ground plan, but beyond a few main features of\ninner courts and halls he was culpably ignorant of their intentions.\nIf it were an early Egyptian tomb or temple now! But then, perhaps\nthe Turks were more indefinite in their building and rebuilding.",
        "At the head of the stairs a door stood half ajar. Through the crack\nhe strained his eyes, but his anxious glance met only the darkness\nof utter night. Not a gleam of light. And not a sound–except the\nfar, hollow stamping of some stabled horse.",
        "Softly he pushed the door open and he and Aimée slipped within. The\nplace, whatever it was, appeared deserted, a dark, bare, backstairs\nregion–for he stumbled over a bucket–from which to the right he\ncould just discern a hall leading into the forward part of the\npalace, wanly lighted some distance on, with the pale flicker of an\nold ceiling lamp.",
        "They seemed to be at the end of the hall and the darker shadows in\nthe walls about them appeared to be a number of doors–closed, so\nhis groping hands informed him.",
        "Oh, for his excavator’s steady light, or a pocket flash! Oh, for a\nlight of any kind, even a temporary match! But he dared not risk the\nscratch, for now he caught the thud of footfalls overhead, heavy\nfootfalls, and there might be stairs unexpectedly close at hand.",
        "He turned to Aimée but the girl shook her head helplessly and\nhesitant and dashed, for all their young confidence, they wavered a\nmoment hand in hand in the dark, fearful of what a rash move might\nbring upon them. And in the beating stillness Ryder became conscious\nthat the muffled, monotonous stamping of a horse is a gloomy,\ndisheartening thing in the night, and that footsteps overhead are of\nall noises the most nervous and unsettling.",
        "What was behind those doors? Not a spark of light came from them,\nthat was one comfort. The rooms, kitchen, service, store rooms or\nwhatever they were, appeared in the same blackness and oblivion....\nBut any door might open on a roomful of sleeping gardeners and\ngrooms....",
        "Life and more than life hung on the blind goddess.",
        "It was only an instant that they hesitated there, yet it appeared an\neternity of indecision, then nearer footsteps sounded, coming down\nthat hall. No more wavering of the scales!",
        "Ryder turned to the door at his left, at the very end of the wall\nbeyond which came that far stamping, and wrenched it open, closing\nit swiftly behind him. He saw a light now, a mild, yellow ray\nthrough an opened door ahead that vaguely illumined the strange old\nvehicles of the palace, and the stables were beyond.",
        "Some one else was beyond, too, in the stables, for that very instant\nhe saw a black horse backed restively into sight, its tossing head\nevading the hands that were trying to bridle it.",
        "“The Fortieth Door!” said Ryder to himself with an involuntary\nthrust of humor.",
        "The door of the horse! The door of forbidden daring! He knew now the\nvague associations that had stirred in him as he had stared blindly\nabout that place of doors.... But he had opened so many forbidden\ndoors of late that this last was welcome as the supreme test.",
        "And nothing in the world could have been more welcome than a\nhorse–a horse with a way out behind it!",
        "“Stay back,” he said under his breath to Aimée, and clasping his bit\nof iron he moved toward the door.",
        "He could see the attendant now, who was finishing his bridling, and\nit was Yussuf, the eunuch, so busy gentling and soothing the horse\nthat he cast only one glance in the direction of the sounds he heard\nand that one glance misled him in its glimpse of the general’s\ncloak.",
        "“By your favor–but an instant,” he called out, “and he is ready–”",
        "“Stand aside,” said Ryder very clearly, emerging from the shadows at\nthe horse’s heels. “Out of the way with you. The horse is for me.”",
        "A moment Yussuf gaped. Then he dropped the bridle and his hand went\nswiftly to the knife hilt in his belt.",
        "“Fool!” said Ryder contemptuously. “Would you tempt fate? Do you\nthink I am such that your knife could harm me? Must I prove to you\nagain that walls are nothings–that I but let myself be taken to\nprove my powers?”",
        "Ethiopians are superstitious. And Yussuf knew that his brick and\nmortar had been strong.... Yet they have great trust in a crooked,\nshort-bladed knife, and Yussuf did not relax his hold upon his and\nfor all that Ryder could See there was no hesitation in the grinning\nferocity of his black face.",
        "Yet his spring was an instant delayed and in that instant Ryder\nspoke again.",
        "“Look, now at the wall behind you,” he said quickly.",
        "Yussuf looked. And as he turned his bullet head Ryder jumped close\nand brought his iron down upon it with a sickening force he thought\nscarcely short of murder.",
        "To his amazement the black did not fall, but staggered only, and\nRyder had need to send the knife spinning from his grasp and strike\nagain before the eunuch’s knees sagged and his huge bulk sank at\nRyder’s feet.",
        "This time Ryder took no chance with a shammed unconsciousness. He\nsnatched down bits of leather from the wall and bound the man’s\nhands and feet in tight security and seeing that he was breathing,\nalthough heavily, he thrust a gagging handkerchief into his mouth.",
        "Then he dragged the heavy body towards a pile of hay he saw\nin a vacant stall and concealed it effectively but not too\nsmotheringly–although Yussuf, he felt, would be no grievous loss\nto society.",
        "Vaguely in the back of his consciousness he had been aware of the\nexcited plunge of the horse and then of a low, soothing murmur of\nspeech, and now he turned to find Aimée holding the bridle and\nstroking the quivering creature with gentle, fearless hands.",
        "“Is he dead?” she asked quietly of the eunuch.",
        "“Stunned,” said Ryder, meaning reassurement and was startled by the\npassion of her cry, “Oh, I could kill them all–all!”",
        "“I will–if they try to stop us,” he promised grimly, forgetful of\nthat oath to Aziza.",
        "Hastily he glanced about the stalls. There was no other horse there,\nonly a pair of mild-eyed donkeys, and though there might conceivably\nbe other horses behind other doors there was no instant to spare in\nsearch.",
        "This luck was too prodigious to risk.",
        "The door to the street had already been unbolted and now he threw\nit back with a quick look into the dark emptiness of the narrow side\nstreet, and then, with a tight hold of the reins, he swung himself\ninto the saddle and Aimée up into his arms, her head on his\nshoulder, her arms clasping him.",
        "It was a huge Bedouin saddle with high-arched back and curved pummel\nand the slender pair no more than filled it, making apparently no\nweight at all for the spirited beast which tore out of the stalls at\nthe charging gallop beloved of Eastern horsemen.",
        "For a moment Ryder felt wildly that he might meet the fate of the\nrash youth in his patron story. He had never ridden a horse like\nthis, which, like all high-mettled Arabs, resented the authority of\nany but his master, and though a good horseman Ryder had all he\ncould do to keep his seat and Aimée in his arms.",
        "Around the corner of the lane the horse went racing, and down the\ndark, lebbek-lined avenue his flying feet struck back their sparks\nof fire. Across an open square he plunged, while irate camels\nscreamed at him and a harsh voice shouted back loud curses. It\nseemed to Ryder that other voices joined in–that there was a\npursuit, an outcry–and then they were out down an open road, wildly\ngalloping, like a mad highwayman under a pale morning sky.",
        "MISS JEFFRIES MAKES A CALL",
        "That morning Miss Jeffries ate two eggs. She ate them successively,\nwith increasing deliberation, and afterwards she lingered\ninterminably over her toast and marmalade.",
        "Still Ryder made no appearance and since the Arab waiter had\ninformed her that he had not yet breakfasted she concluded that he\nwas not at the hotel but had spent the night with some friend of\nhis–probably that Andrew McLean to whom he was always running off.",
        "Nor was he in to luncheon. That was rank extravagance because he was\npaying at pension rates. His extravagance, however, was no affair of\nhers. Neither, she informed herself frigidly, was his appearance or\nhis non-appearance. It was only rather dull of Jack to lose so many,\nwell, opportunities.",
        "She was not going to be in Cairo forever. Not much longer, in fact.\nThere were adages about gathering rosebuds while ye may and making\nhay while the sun shone that Jack Ryder would do well to observe.",
        "Other men did, reflected Jinny Jeffries with a proud lift of her\nruddy head. Only somehow, the other men–",
        "Well, Jack was provokingly attractive! Only of course, if he was\ngoing to rely upon his attraction and not upon his attentions–",
        "Deliberately Miss Jeffries smiled upon a stalwart tourist from New\nYork and promised her society for a foursome at bridge in the hotel\nlounge that evening.",
        "Later, when Jack still failed to materialize and behold her\ninaccessibility, the exhibition seemed hardly to have been worth\nwhile.... And there were difficulties getting rid of the New Yorker\nthe next day. He had ideas about excursions.",
        "It was during the forenoon of the next day that the first twinge of\ngenuine worry shot across the sustained resentment which she was\npleased to call her complete indifference. She recalled the vigor of\nRyder’s warnings about mentioning his adventure and the grave\ndangers of disclosure, and she began to wonder.",
        "She wished, rather, that he had gone safely out of the house before\nshe went away.",
        "Of course nothing could happen. He had done nothing to give himself\naway. He was simply a veiled shadow, moving humbly as befitted a\nlowly stranger among the high and hospitable surroundings.",
        "But still, it would have been better if he had gone....",
        "Those turbaned women had looked queerly at them when they were\ntalking so long in the window. Perhaps it was not simply at the\nintimacy between a young American and a veiled Oriental. Perhaps\ntheir voices had been unguarded or Jack’s tones had awakened\nsuspicion. Perhaps he had given himself away in his long talk with\nthe bride. She remembered a Frenchwoman who had come to interrupt\nthat talk who had looked rather sharply at Jack.... And that\ndreadful eunuch was always staring....",
        "She thought of a great many things now, more and more things every\nminute.",
        "And still she told herself that she was absurd, that Jack would be\nthe first to ridicule her alarm. He was probably enjoying himself,\nstaying on with his friends, forgetting all about herself.... Still\nhis room at the hotel had not been slept in for two nights now nor\nhad he called at the hotel and he certainly didn’t have an extensive\nsupply of clothes and linen upon him beneath the mantle.",
        "Particularly she remembered that he had exhibited some funny black\ntennis shoes which he had thought would go appropriately with a\nwoman’s robes. Absurd, to think of him as spending two days in\ntennis shoes, and absurd to say that he would go to the shops and\nbuy more when he had plenty of footgear in his hotel room.",
        "Unless he wore McLean’s.",
        "She had always regarded the unknown McLean as a most unnecessary\nabsorbent of Jack Ryder’s time and attention and now that view was\ndeeply reinforced.",
        "By noon she decided to do something. She would telephone that\nAndrew McLean and see if Jack had been there. The Agricultural Bank,\nthat was the place. An obliging hotel clerk–clerks were always\nobliging to Miss Jeffries–gave her the number and she slipped into\nthe booth feeling a ridiculous amount of excitement and suspense.",
        "She had never telephoned in Cairo–only been telephoned to–and she\nwas not prepared for the fact that the telephone company was French.\nAt the phone girl’s ’Numero?–Quel numero, s’il vous plait?_” Jinny\nhastily choked back the English response and clutched violently at\nFrench numerals.",
        "“_Huit cent–no, quatre vingt–un moment!_” she demanded desperately\nand hanging up the receiver, sat down to write out her number in\nFrench correctly.",
        "And then she got the Bank, and, still clinging to her French, she\nrequested to speak to Monsieur McLean and was informed that it was\nMonsieur McLean himself.",
        "“_Je suis–oh, how absurd! Of course you speak English,” she\nexclaimed. “This French telephone upset me.... I wanted to speak to\nMr. Ryder if he is there–or else leave a message for him, if you\nknow when he will come in.”",
        "“Ryder?” There was a faint intonation of surprise in the voice.\n\"I’ve no idea really when he’ll be in,” said McLean, “but you may\nleave the message if you like.”",
        "“Hasn’t he–haven’t you seen him for some time?” stammered Jinny,\nfeeling that McLean must be taking her for a pursuing adventuress.",
        "“Well–not for some time.”",
        "Her heart sank.",
        "“Not–not for two days?”",
        "“It might be that,” said the Scotchman cautiously.",
        "Two days. Forty-eight hours, almost, since she had left him in that\nharem! And McLean had not seen him. Of course there might be other\nfriends who had and McLean might know of them.",
        "“I’m afraid I’ll have to see you,” she said desperately. “It’s\nrather important about Jack Ryder–and if I could just talk with you\na minute–this afternoon–?”",
        "“I have no appointment for three fifteen,” McLean told her\nconcisely.",
        "Evidently he expected her to call at the Bank.... He was used to\nbeing called on.... “Shall I come–?” she began.",
        "“I can see you at three fifteen,” McLean reassured her, and she\nrepeated “Three fifteen,” with an odd vibration in her voice.",
        "“I wonder,” she murmured, “if I came at three ten–or three\ntwenty–?”",
        "But she didn’t. She was humorously careful to make it exactly a\nquarter past the hour when she left her cab before McLean’s\nofficial looking residence and stepped into the tiled entrance.",
        "She had no very clear notion of Andrew McLean except that he was, as\nJack had said, Scotch, single, and skeptical, that he was Jack’s\nintimate friend and an official sort of banker–and the word banker\nhad unconsciously prepared her for stout dignity and middle age.",
        "She was not at all prepared for the lean, sandy-haired, rather\nabrupt young man who came forward from the depths of the gratefully\ncool reception room, and after a nervous hand clasp waved her to a\nchair.",
        "He was still holding her card, and as he glanced covertly at it she\nrecalled that she had given him no name over the telephone and that\nhe had known her only by the time of her appointment. Decidedly she\nmust have made an odd impression!",
        "Well, he could see for himself now, she thought, a trifle defiantly.\nCertainly he was taking stock of her out of those shrewd swift gray\neyes of his. He could see that she was, well–certainly a nice girl!",
        "As a matter of fact McLean could see that she was considerably more.\nRather disconcertingly more! It was not often that such white-clad\napparitions, piquant of face and coppery of hair, teased the eyes in\nhis receiving room.",
        "“You wanted to see me–?” he offered mechanically.",
        "“Perhaps you have heard Jack Ryder speak of me–of Jinny Jeffries?\"\nbegan the girl, determined to put the affair on a sound social\nfooting as soon as possible.",
        "McLean considered and, in honesty, shook his head. “He very seldom\nmentioned young ladies.”",
        "“Oh–!” Jinny tried not to appear dashed. “We are very old\nfriends–in America–and of course I’ve seen a good deal of him\nsince I’ve been in Cairo. In fact, he is stopping now at the same\nhotel with us–with my aunt and uncle and myself.”",
        "McLean smiled. “He said it was a tooth,” he mentioned dryly.",
        "In Jinny’s eyes a little flicker answered him, but her words were\ningenuous. “Oh, of course he has been having a time with the\ndentist. That’s why he couldn’t return to his camp. What I meant\nwas, that at the hotel we have been seeing him every day until–he\nhas just disappeared since day before yesterday and we–that is,\nI–am very much concerned about it.”",
        "“Disappeared? You mean, he–”",
        "“Just disappeared, that’s all. He hasn’t been at the hotel–he\nhasn’t been anywhere that I know of, and I haven’t heard a word from\nhim–so I telephoned you and then when I found he hadn’t been\nhere–”",
        "McLean looked off into space. “Eh, well, he’ll turn up,” he said\ncomfortingly. “Jack’s erratic, you may say, in his comings and\ngoings. He means nothing by it.... I’ve known him do the same to\nme.... Any time, now; you’re likely to hear–”",
        "Miss Jeffries sat up a little straighter and her cheeks burned with\nbrighter warmth.",
        "“It isn’t just that I want to see him, Mr. McLean,” she took quietly\ndistinct pains to explain. “It’s because I am anxious–”",
        "“Not a need, not a need in the world. Jack knows his way about....\nHe may have been called back to the diggings, you know–if they dug\nup a bit porcelain there or a few grains of corn the boy would\nforget the sun was shining.”",
        "Perhaps his caller’s burnished hair had shaped that thought. “Jack\nknows his way about,” he repeated encouragingly, as one who\ndemolishes the absurd fears of women and children.",
        "“You don’t quite understand.” Jinny’s tones were silken smooth. “You\nsee, I left him in rather unusual circumstances. It was a place\nwhere he had no business in the world to be–”",
        "At McLean’s unguardedly startled gaze her humor overtook her wrath.",
        "“Oh, it was quite all right for me_” she replied mischievously to\nthat look. “Only not for him. You see, he was masquerading–”",
        "“Again?” thought McLean, involuntarily. Lord, what a hand for the\nlassies that lad was–and he had thought him such an aloof one!",
        "“Masquerading as a woman–so he could take me to a reception.”",
        "Jinny began to falter. Just putting that escapade into words\nportrayed its less commendable features.",
        "“It was a woman’s reception,” she began again, “at a Turkish house.\nA marriage reception–”",
        "She had certainly secured McLean’s whole-hearted attention.",
        "“A marriage reception–a Turkish marriage reception?” he said very\nsharply and amazedly as his caller continued to pause. “Do you mean\nto say that Jack Ryder went into a Turkish house dressed as a\nwoman–?”",
        "There was a pronounced angularity of feature about the young\nScotchman which now took on a chiseled sternness.",
        "Swiftly Jinny interposed. “Oh, you mustn’t blame him, Mr. McLean!\nYou see, I wanted very much to go to a Turkish reception and I\ndidn’t have the courage to go alone or drag some other tourist as\ninexperienced as myself, and so Jack–why, there didn’t seem any\nharm in his dressing up. Just for fun, you know. He put on a Turkish\nmantle and a veil up to his eyes and he was sure he’d never be found\nout. I ought not to have let him, I know–it was my fault–”",
        "She looked so flushed and innocent and distressed that McLean’s\nchivalry rose swiftly to her need.",
        "“Indeed you mustn’t blame yourself Miss–Miss Jeffries. You don’t\nknow Egypt–and Jack does. He knew that if he had been discovered\nthere would have been no help for him–and no questions asked\nafterwards. And it might have been very dangerous for you. The\nblame is just his now,” he said decisively, yet not without a\ncertain weak-kneed sympathy with the culprit.",
        "For if the girl had looked like this ... he could see that she would\nbe a difficult little piece to withstand ... though any man with an\nounce of sense in his head would have behaved as a responsible\nprotector and not as a reckless school boy.",
        "“What happened?” he said quickly.",
        "“Oh, nothing happened–nothing that I know of. We got along very\nwell, I thought, although now I remember that some people didstare.... But I wasn’t worried at the time. I thought it was just\nbecause I was an American and he was apparently a Turkish woman, but\nthere was no reason why an American might not get a Turkish woman to\nact as a guide, was there?... And then Jack told me to go home\nfirst–he said it would be simpler that way and that he would slip\nover to some friend’s or to some safe place and take his disguise\noff. He wore a gray suit beneath it, and the only funny thing was\nsome black tennis shoes.... So I left him. And he hasn’t been back\nsince.”",
        "She added as McLean was silent, “He told me that he had some\nengagement for that evening, so I did not begin to worry until the\nnext day.”",
        "“Now just how long ago was this?”",
        "“Two days ago. Day before yesterday afternoon.”",
        "She looked anxiously at McLean’s face and took alarm at his careful\nabsence of expression.",
        "“Oh, Mr. McLean, do you think–”",
        "He brushed that aside. “And where was it–this reception?”",
        "“At an old palace, forever away on the edge of the city. I don’t\nremember the street–we drove and I had the cab wait. But it\nbelonged to a Turkish general. Hamdi Bey,” she brought out\ntriumphantly. “General Hamdi Bey.”",
        "McLean did not correct her idea of the title. His expression was\nmore carefully non-committal than ever, while behind its quiet guard\nhis thoughts were breaking out like a revolution.",
        "Hamdi Bey.... A wedding reception.... The daughter of Tewfick\nPasha....",
        "In the secret depths of his soul he uttered profane and troubled\nwords. That French girl, again.... So Ryder had not forgotten that\naffair, although he had kept silent about it of late. He had bided\nhis time and taken that rash means of seeing the girl again–and he\nhad involved this unknowing young American in a risk of scandal and\ndeceived her into believing herself responsible for this caprice\nwhile all the time she had been a mere cloak and it had been his own\ndiabolical desire....",
        "Miss Jeffries was surprised to see a sudden sorry softness dawn in\nthe young man’s look upon her. And she was surprised, too, at his\nnext question.",
        "“I wonder, now, if you were the young lady who took him to a\nmasquerade ball–some time ago?”",
        "Lightly she acknowledged it. “You’ll think I’m always taking him to\nthings,” she said brightly, but McLean’s troubled gaze did not\nquicken with a smile.",
        "He was experiencing a vast compassion. She was so innocent, so\nunconscious of the quicksands about her.... Probably she had never\nheard a breath of that first adventure.",
        "And it was this fair Christian creature whom Jack Ryder had\nabandoned for a veiled girl from a Turk’s harem!",
        "McLean filled with cold, antagonistic wonder. He forgot the lovely\nimage of the French miniature, and remembering Tewfick’s rounded\neyes and olive features he thought of the veiled girl–most\nillogically, for he knew that Tewfick was not her father–as some\nbold-eyed, warm-skinned image of base allure.",
        "Sorrowfully he shook his head over his friend. He determined to\nprotect him and to protect this girl’s innocence of his behavior. He\nwould help her to save him.... She could do it yet–if only she did\nnot learn the truth and turn from him. If ever she had been able to\nmake Jack go to a masquerade–that cursed masquerade!–she could\nwork other, more beneficent, miracles.",
        "So now he asked, very cautiously, his mind on divided paths, “Do you\nsay there was nothing to draw suspicion–he did not talk to any\none, the guests or the bride–?”",
        "“Oh, yes, he did talk to the bride,” said Miss Jeffries with such\nutter unconsciousness that McLean’s heart hardened against the\nrenegade.",
        "“He talked quite a while to her,” she said.",
        "“Did you notice anything–?”",
        "“Oh, I couldn’t hear what was said. He was the last in line and he\nstayed for some time. He said afterward that it was all right. She\nwas very nice to him,” said Jinny earnestly, producing every scrap\nof incident for McLean’s judgment. “She showed him some of her\npresents–something about her neck.”",
        "In mid-speech McLean changed a startled “God!” to “Good!”",
        "“She wasn’t suspicious, then?” he said weakly.",
        "“Not as far as I could see. Oh, nothing seemed to be wrong. But I\ndid feel uneasy until I got away and then, Jack hasn’t come back–”",
        "Again she looked at the young Scotchman for confirmation of her fear\nand again she saw that careful expressionless calm.",
        "“It’s no need for alarm,” he told her slowly, “since nothing went\nwrong. I see no reason why Jack couldn’t have walked out of that\nreception. If we only knew where he was going later–”",
        "“Yes, something might have happened later,” Jinny took up. “I\nthought of that. He might have wanted some more fun and felt more\nreckless–Oh, I am worried,” she confessed, her gray eyes very\nround and childlike.",
        "And if anything had happened she would always blame herself, thought\nMcLean ironically.... The unthinking deviltry of the young\nscoundrel!... When he found him he’d have a few things to say!",
        "“That’s why I came to you,” Jinny went on. “I hesitated, for he had\nwarned me so against telling any one, but no one else knows–”",
        "“And no one must know,” McLean assured her crisply. “I daresay it’s\na mare’s nest and Jack will be found safe and sound at his diggings\nor off on a lark with some friend or other, but it’s well to make\nsure and you did quite right in coming to me.”",
        "Jinny thought she had done quite right, too.",
        "There was a satisfying strength about McLean. She resented a trifle\nhis masculine way of trying to keep the dark side from her; she was\nnot greatly misled by that untroubled look of his and yet she was\nunconsciously reassured by it.... And although he refused to be\nstampeded by alarm he was not incredulous of it, for his manner was\nfrankly grave.",
        "“I’ll send out at once,” he said decisively, “and see if I can pick\nup any gossip of that reception. I’ve a very clever clerk with\nbrothers in the bazaars who is a perfect wireless for information.\nHe has told me the night before a man was to be murdered.”",
        "He paused, reflecting that was not a happy suggestion.",
        "“Then I’ll send out to Jack’s diggings. That express doesn’t stop\nto-night, but I’ll find a way. And I’ll let you know as soon as I\ncan.”",
        "“You’re very kind,” said Jinny gratefully.",
        "His competent manner brought her a light-hearted sensation of\ndifficulties already solved. Jack was as good as found, she felt in\nswift reaction. If he was in any trouble this forceful young man\nwould settle it.",
        "But probably he wasn’t in any trouble. Probably he was just at his\ndiggings–rushing off from her in the exasperating way he seemed to\ndo whenever they were getting on particularly well.... She\nremembered how he had bolted from that masquerade which had begun so\nhappily. He had said he was ill, but she had never completely slain\nthe suspicion that his illness sprang from ennui and disinclination.",
        "She rose. “I mustn’t take any more of your time, Mr. McLean–and you\nprobably have a four fifteen engagement.”",
        "But her light raillery failed of its mark.",
        "“Eh? No, I have not,” seriously he assured her. “You are quite the\nlast one I took on–the last before tea.”",
        "He paused confused with a strange suggestion.... Tea.... His servant\ndid it rather well.... And it was time–",
        "Usually he had it in the garden. It was a charming garden, full of\nroses, with a nice view of the Citadel–and his strange suggestion\nexpanded with a rosy vision of Jinny among the roses, beside his\nwicker table.... Would she possibly care to–?",
        "He struggled with his idea–and with his shyness. And then the sense\nthat it wasn’t quite decent, somehow, to be offering tea to this\ngirl whom anxiety for Ryder’s unknown lot had brought to him\novercame that unwonted impulse.",
        "He dismissed the idea. And like all shy men he was oddly relieved at\nthe passing of the necessity for initiative, even while he felt his\nmild hope’s expiring pang.",
        "He stepped before her to open the doors to which she was now taking\nherself.",
        "In the entrance he saw his clerk–the clever one–going out, and\nexcusing himself he went forward to detain the man. For a moment\nthere ensued a low-toned colloquy. Then the clerk, a dark-browned\nkeen-featured fellow in European clothes with a red fez, began to\nrelate something.",
        "When McLean turned back to Jinny Jeffries she saw that his look was\nsharply altered. There was a transfixed air about him and when he\nspoke his voice told her that he had had a shock.",
        "“My man tells me,” he said, “that Hamdi Bey’s bride is dead. He\nburied her yesterday.”",
        "FROM THE BAZAARS",
        "There was a moment’s pause.",
        "“What? That lovely girl?” said Jinny in startled pity. She added\nincredulously, “Yesterday?... And only the day before–why, what\ncould have happened?”",
        "That was what McLean was asking himself very grimly.",
        "Aloud he told her slowly. “They say that fire happened. Some\naccident–a candle overturned in her apartments. And of course the\nwindows were screened–”",
        "“_Fire–how terrible! That lovely girl,” said Jinny again. She was\ngenuinely horrified and pitiful, yet she found a moment to wonder at\nthe evident depths of McLean’s consternation. For of course he had\nnever seen the girl.",
        "Yet he looked utterly upset.",
        "“It’s one of the most dreadful things I ever heard of,” Jinny\nmurmured. “On her wedding night.... And she was so young, Mr.\nMcLean, and so exquisite. She didn’t look like a real girl.... She\nwas a fairy creature.... I never dreamed there really were\nrose-leaf skins before but hers was just like flower petals. Jack\nand I talked about it, I remember. And her face had something so\nbewitching about it, something so sweet and delicate–”",
        "She broke off revisited with that vision of Aimée’s sprite-like\nbeauty.... How little that poor girl had thought, as she stood there\nin the bright splendor of her robes and diadem, that in a few hours\nmore–",
        "“Oh, I hope that fire–that it was merciful–that she didn’t\nsuffer,” she said almost inaudibly.",
        "But speech itself was too definitive of horrors.",
        "“It’s tragic,” she finished simply.",
        "It was tragic, with a complicated tragedy, thought Andrew McLean as\nhe stood there, his eyes narrowing, his lips compressed, his mind\ninvaded with a dark swarm of conjecture, surmise, suspicion, his\nvision possessed by a flitting rush of pictures.",
        "He saw Jack talking with the girl at the reception.... The girl\nshowing him something about her neck–that accursed locket, he\nthought acutely.... Jack sending Miss Jeffries home.... Had he\narranged that purposely? Was there some mad, improvised scheme of\nescape in the air?",
        "The pictures became mere flitting wraiths of conjecture, yet touched\nwith horrifying possibility.... Jack lingering, hiding.... Jack\nmaking love to the girl, attempting flight.... Jack discovered–and\nthe quick saber thrust–for both.",
        "A fire?... Very likely–to screen the darker tragedy. Hamdi was\ncapable of it to save his pride. And it would dispose so easily of\nthe–evidence.",
        "McLean’s thoughts flinched from the grim outcome of his fear. He\ntried to tell himself that he was inventing horrors, that the fire\nmight be the simple truth, that Ryder’s talk with the girl might\nactually have ended in farewell–at least a temporary farewell–and\nthat his consequent low spirits had taken him off to mope in camp.",
        "That was undoubtedly the thing to believe, at least until there was\nactual necessity to disbelieve it, and looking at the story in that\nway, McLean’s Scotch sense of Providence was capable of pointing out\nthe stern benefits of the sad visitation.",
        "Whatever mischief might have been afoot between his friend and that\nunfortunate young girl the fire had prevented. And however hard Jack\nmight take this now, decidedly the poor girl’s death was better for\nhim than her life.",
        "No more wasting himself now on sad romance and adventure. No more\ndesire and danger. No more lurking about barred gates and secret\ndoors and forbidden palaces. No more clandestine trysts. No more\nfury of mind, beating against the bars of fate.",
        "Jack was saved.",
        "Even if he had succeeded in rescuing the girl–what then? McLean was\nskeptical of felicity from such contrasting lives. Better the\nfinality, the sharp pain, the utter separation. And then–",
        "His eyes returned to the young American before him. She was the\nunconscious answer to that future. She would save Ryder from regret\nand retrospection.... In after years, looking back from a happy and\nwell-ordered domesticity, this would all become to him a fantastic,\nfar-off adventure, sad with the remembered but unfelt sadness of\nyouth, yet mercifully dim and softened with young beauty.",
        "Jack must never tell this girl the story. McLean had read somewhere\nof the mistakes of too-open revelation to women and now he was very\nsure of it.... She must never receive this hurt, never know that\nwhen she had been troubling over Jack’s disappearance he had been\nagonizing over another girl–that the escapade she thought so\nintimate a lark had been a trick to see the other–that the young\ncreature whose loveliness she so innocently praised had been her\nrival, drawing Jack from her....",
        "McLean would speak clearly to Ryder about this and seal his lips....\nBut first he would have to be found.",
        "He became conscious that he had been a long time silent, following\nthese thoughts, while Jinny waited.",
        "“I’ll do everything I can to find out about that fire,” he told her.\n\"I mean, about any discovery of Jack in the palace,” he quickly\namended as her face was touched with instant question. “And I’ll see\nif any one in Cairo knows where he is. Then if nothing turns up I’ll\njust pop out to his diggings in the morning and make sure he’s all\nright.... I’ll get back that night and telephone you. And until\nthen, not a word about it. Much better not.”",
        "“Not a word,” Jinny promised. “And if you should happen to find out\nanything to-night–”",
        "“I’ll let you know at once. Well, rather. But don’t count on that.\nThe old boy is out in his tombs, dusting off his mummies. You may\nget a letter, yourself, in the morning,” he threw out with\nheartening inspiration, “And while you are reading it, I’ll be\ntearing along to the infernal desert–”",
        "He had brought the smile to her eyes as well as lips. Bright and\nreassured and comfortably dependent upon his resourceful strength,\nshe took her leave.",
        "But there was no smile remaining upon Andrew McLean’s visage.",
        "Twenty-four hours. Two nights and a day.... And the girl was dead\nand in her grave–Moslems wasted no time before interment–and Jack\nwas–where?",
        "IN THE DESERT",
        "Clinging to that plunging horse Ryder made little attempt at first\nto guide the flight. It was enough to keep himself in the saddle and\nAimée in his arms while every galloping moment flung a farther\ndistance between them and that palace of horror.",
        "His heart was beating in a wild, triumphant exultation. Glorious to\nbe out under the free sky, the wind in his face, the open world\nahead! He felt one with that dashing creature beneath him.",
        "And Aimée was in his arms, untouched, unhurt, out from the power of\nthat sinister man and the expectation of dread things.",
        "The moment was a supreme and glorious emotion.",
        "They were headed south. And to Ryder’s exhilaration this seemed\ngood. Cairo offered no hiding place for that fugitive girl. Even the\nharbor that McLean could give would not be proof against the legal\nforces of the Turks. Law and order, power and police were all in the\nhands of the husband or father. Even now the alarm might be given,\nthe telephones ringing.",
        "Aimée must be hidden until she could be smuggled to France–or\nuntil the French authorities could get out their protective\ndocuments. The hiding place that occurred to Ryder was a wild and\ndesperate expedient.",
        "The American hospital at Siut. The isolation ward–the pretense of\ncontagious illness. And then later travel north, in the care of\nnurses–",
        "All this, if he could win over one of the doctors. At that moment\nwinning over a doctor appeared a sane and simple thing to Ryder’s\nmind. The only difficulty he recognized was getting Aimée into that\nhospital.",
        "But they would not be looking for him in the south. He could manage\nit, he felt jubilantly. He could smuggle her into his diggings at\nnight and then make his arrangements. Anything, everything was\npossible, now that the nightmare of a palace was left behind them.",
        "South they went then, at a quieter pace, the Arab’s rhythmic\nfootfalls ringing through the still, gray world of before dawn.\nAcross the Nile they made their way, working out on sandbars to the\nnarrow depths, where Ryder swam beside the swimming horse while\nAimée clung to the saddle. Then south again along the river road.",
        "The sky was light now. And the river was light. Only the palms and\nthe villages and the flat dhurra fields were dark. And in the east\nbehind the Mokattam hills a thin band of gold began to brighten.",
        "Life was stirring. Small black boys on huge black buffaloes\nsplashed in the river. Veiled girls with water jars on their\nhigh-held heads from which the shawls trailed down to the dust filed\npast from the villages like a Parthenon frieze. On the high banks\nthe naked fellaheen were already stooping to the incessant dipping\nof the shadouf, while from the fields came the plaintive creaking of\nthe well sweep, as some harnessed camel or bullock began its eternal\nround.",
        "A flock of sheep came down the river road, driven by their ragged\nshepherds, and a string of camels, burdened beyond all semblance to\nthemselves, bobbed by like rhythmic haystacks, led by a black-robed,\nbare-footed child, carrying a live turkey in her arms while before\nher rode her father, in shining pongee robes on a white donkey\nstrung with beads of blue.",
        "And by these travelers there passed in that brightening dawn two\nother travelers from the north, a pair on a powerful but tired black\nhorse, a man in a military cloak and a green and gold turban about\nhis bronzed head, and behind him, on a pillion, a black-mantled,\nblack-veiled girl, with bare, dangling feet.",
        "It was Aimée who had evolved the disguise, constructing the turban\nfrom the negligee beneath her mantle, and it was Aimée who bargained\nwith the villagers for their breakfast, eggs and goats’ milk and\nbread and rice, while her lord, as befitted his dignity, stayed\naloof upon his steed, returning a courteous response of ’Allah\nsalimak–God bless you” to their greetings.",
        "Then as the day brightened and the last soft veil of mist was\nburned away before a blood-red sun, that pair of travelers left the\nhighroad and turned west upon a byway that led past fields of corn\nand yellow water and mud villages where goats and naked babies and\nragged women squatted idly in the dust, and on through low,\nred-granite hills swirled about with yellow sand drift and out into\nthe desert beyond.",
        "Here fresh vigor came to the Arab horse, and tossing his mane and\nstretching out his nostrils to the dry air he broke into a gallop\nthat sent sand and pebbles flying from his hoofs. To right and left\nthe startled desert hares scattered, and from the clumps of spiky\nhelga the black vultures rose in heavy-winged flight.",
        "Then the breeze dropped, and the swift-coming heat rushed at them\nlike a furnace breath, and slower and slower they made their way,\nRyder leading the jaded horse and Aimée nodding in the saddle, mere\ncrawling specks across the immensity of sand.",
        "Then, in the shade of a huge clump of gray-green mit minan beside\na jutting boulder they stopped at last to rest. The horse sank on\nhis knees; Ryder spread out his cloak and Aimée dropped down upon\nits folds, lost in exhausted sleep as soon as her head touched the\nsands. Ryder, his back against the rock, kept watch.",
        "It was not the exultant Ryder of that first hour of flight. The\nexcitement of the night had subsided and withdrawn its wild\nstimulation. It was a hot and tired and immensely sobered young man\nwho sat there with eyes that burned from lack of sleep and a brow\nknit into a taut and anxious line.",
        "Realization flooded him with the sun. Responsibility burned in upon\nhim with the heat.",
        "Alone in the Libyan desert he sat there, and at his feet there slept\nthe young girl whose life he had snapped utterly off from its roots.",
        "He was overwhelmingly responsible for her. If she had never met him,\nif he had never continued to thrust himself upon her, she would have\ngone on her predestined way, safe, secluded, luxurious–vaguely\nunhappy and mutinous at times, perhaps, in the secret stirrings of\nher blood, but still an indulged and wealthy little Moslem.",
        "And now–she lay there, like a sleeping child, the dark tendrils of\nhair clinging to her moist, sun-flushed cheeks, her long lashes\nmingling their shadows with the purple underlining of the night’s\nterrors, homeless, exhausted, resourceless but for that anxious-eyed\nyoung man.",
        "Desperately he hoped that she would not wake to regret. Even a\nsardonic tyrant in a palace might be preferable in the merciless\ndaylight to a helpless young man in the Libyan desert.",
        "And she was so slight, so delicate, so made for rich and lovely\nluxury.... Looking down at her he felt a lump in his throat ... a\nlump of queer, choking tenderness....",
        "He wanted to protect her, to save her, to spend himself for her....\nHe felt for her a reverent wonder, a stirring that was at once\nprotective and possessive and denying of all self.",
        "He would die to save her. He tried to tell himself reassuringly that\nhe had saved her.... If only he could keep her safe....",
        "He thought of the life before her. He thought of that family in\nFrance in whose name he had urged his interference. That unknown\nDelcassé aunt who had sent out her agents for her lost heirs–would\nshe welcome and endow this lovely girl?",
        "He could not doubt it.... Aimée’s youth and beauty would be treasure\ntrove to a jaded lonely woman with money to invest in futures. Aimée\nwould be a belle, an heiress....",
        "He looked down at her with a sudden darkness in his young eyes....\nAnd still she slept, wrapped in the sorry mantle of his masquerade,\nthe torn chiffons of her negligée fluttering over her slim, bare\nfeet.",
        "THE TOMB OF A KING",
        "There were several approaches to the American excavations. McLean,\non that morning after his visit from Jinny Jeffries, chose to borrow\na friend’s motor and man and break the speed laws of Upper Egypt,\nand then shift to an agile donkey at the little village from which\nthe gulleys ran west through the red hills into the desert.",
        "It was a still, hot day without cloud or wind and the sun had an air\nof standing permanently high in the heavens, holding the day at\nnoon. Shimmering heat waves quivered about the base of the farther\nhills and veiled the desert reaches. It was not conducive to comfort\nand Andrew McLean was not comfortable. He was hot and sticky and\nsandy and abominably harassed.",
        "Not a creature, as far as he could discover, had seen Jack Ryder in\nCairo since the afternoon of that reception at Hamdi Bey’s. He had\nnot been seen at the Museum nor the banks, nor at Cook’s, nor the\nusual restaurants, nor at the clubs with his friends. And the clever\nclerk–with the two brothers in the bazaar–had unearthed quite a\nbit of disquieting news about that reception–disquieting, that is,\nto one with secret fears.",
        "There had been a fire in the apartments of the bride of Hamdi Bey\nand the bride had been killed instantly–that much was known to all\nthe world. The general had been distracted. He had sat brooding\nbeside his bride’s coffin, allowing no one, not even her father, to\nlook upon the poor charred remains that he had placed within. He had\nbeen a man out of his mind with grief, gnawing his nails, beating\nhis slaves,–Oh, assuredly, it had been a calamity of a very high\norder!",
        "One of the brothers in the bazaar had himself talked with an old\ncrone whose sister’s child was employed in the general’s kitchen,\nand the fourth-hand story had lost nothing on the route.",
        "The bride’s youth and beauty, her jewels, her robes, the general’s\ninfatuation, and the general’s grief, the reports of these ran\nthrough the city like wildfire. And from the particular channel of\nthe kitchen maid and the old aunt and the brother in the bazaars\ncame news of the very especial means that Allah had taken to\npreserve the general from destruction.",
        "For he had been in the bride’s apartments just before the fire. But\nthe power of Allah, the Allseeing, had sent a thief, a prowler, by\nnight, upon the palace roofs, and the screams of a girl in the upper\nstory had called the general to that direction.",
        "And so his preservation had been accomplished.",
        "It was that rumor of the thief upon the roofs which sent the chill\nof apprehension down McLean’s spine. For though the bazaars knew\nnothing of the thief’s identity and it was reported he had escaped\nby the river yet McLean felt the sinister finger of suspicion. If\nthe thief had not been a thief–unless of brides!–and if he had\nnot escaped–?",
        "Impatiently the young Scotchman clapped his heels against the\ndonkey’s sides, enhancing the efforts of the runner with the\ngesticulating stick.",
        "Suppose, now, that he should not find Jack at the excavations?",
        "It was encouraging, somehow, to hear the monotonous rise and fall of\nthe labor song proceeding as usual, although McLean immediately told\nhimself that the work would naturally be going on under Thatcher’s\ndirection whether Ryder were there or not. The camp knew nothing of\nCairo. The camp would be as usual.",
        "And yet, after his first moment’s survey, he had an indefinite but\nuneasy idea that the camp was not as usual.",
        "True, the tatterdemalion frieze of basket bearers still wove its\nrhythmic way over the mounds to the siftings where Thatcher was\npresiding as was his wont, but in the native part of the encampment\nthere appeared a sly stir and excitement.",
        "The unoccupied, of all ages and sexes, that usually were squatting\ninterminably about some fire or sleeping like mummies in\nhermetically wrapped black mantles, now were gathered in little\nwhispering knots whose backward glances betrayed a sense of\nuneasiness, and as McLean rode past, a young Arab who had been the\ncenter of attention drew back with such carefulness to escape\nobservation that McLean’s shrewd eyes marked him closely.",
        "It might be that his nerves were deceiving him, but there did seem\nto be something surreptitious in the air.",
        "Over his shoulder he glimpsed the young Arab hurrying out of the\ncamp.",
        "It might be anything or nothing, he told himself. The man might be\ngoing shopping to the village and the others giving him their\ncommissions, or he might be an illicit dealer in curios trying to\npick up some dishonest treasure. In native diggings those hangers on\nwere thick as flies.",
        "He dismounted and hurried forward to meet Thatcher’s advance.\nThe men had rarely met and Thatcher’s air of hesitation and\nabsent-mindedness made McLean proffer his name promptly with a\nsense of speeding through the preliminaries. Then with a manner\nhe strove to make casual he put his question.",
        "“I say, is Ryder back?”",
        "He knew, in the moment’s pause, how tight suspense was gripping him.\nThen Thatcher glanced toward the black yawning mouth of a tomb\nentrance.",
        "“Why, yes–he’s down there.” He added. “Been a bit sick. Complains\nof the sun.”",
        "For a moment his relief was so great that McLean did not believe in\nit. Jack here–Jack absolutely safe–",
        "Mechanically he put, “When did he come in?”",
        "“When?” Thatcher hesitated, trying to recall. “Oh, night before\nlast–rode in after dark.” He added reassuringly, as the other swung\nabout towards the tomb, “He says there’s nothing really wrong with\nhim. There’s no temperature.”",
        "McLean nodded. His relief now was acutely compounded with disgust.\nHe felt no lightning leap of thanksgiving that his friend was safe,\nbut rather that flash of irritated reaction which makes the\nprimitive parent smack a recovered child.",
        "Not a thing in the world the matter! A mare’s nest–just as he had\nprophesied to Miss Jeffries. Why in heaven’s name hadn’t Jack the\ndecency to send that over-anxious young lady a card when he\nabandoned town so suddenly?... Not that McLean blamed Miss Jeffries.\nGiven the masquerade and Jack’s disappearance and a zealous feminine\ninterest her concern was perfectly natural.",
        "But McLean had left a busy office and taken an anxious and\nuncomfortable excursion, and his voice had no genial ring as he\nshouted his friend’s name down the dark entrance of the tomb shaft.",
        "In a moment he heard a voice shouting hollowly back, then a\nwavering spot of light appeared upon the inclined floor and Ryder’s\nfigure emerged like an apparition from the gloom.",
        "“I say! That you, Andy?”",
        "Evidently he had been snatched from sleep. His dark hair was\nrumpled, his face flushed, and he yawned with complete frankness.",
        "McLean knew a sudden yearning to put an arm about him.... Dear old\nJack.... Dear, irresponsible scamp.... His reaction of the\nirritation vanished.... It was so darned good to see the old chap\nagain....",
        "He muttered something about being in the vicinity while Ryder,\nrousing to hostship, called directions to the cook boy to bring a\ntray of luncheon.",
        "“It’s cool down here,” he told McLean, leading the way back.",
        "It was cool indeed, in the Hall of Offerings. It was also, McLean\nthought, satisfying a recovered appetite, a trifle depressing.",
        "They sat in a small island of light in an ocean of gloom while about\nthem shadowy columns towered to indistinguishable heights and\nhalf-seen carvings projected their strange suggestions.",
        "It seemed incongruous to be smoking cigarettes so unconcernedly at\nthe feet of the ancient gods.",
        "But McLean’s feeling of depression might have been due to his\nrenewed awareness of catastrophe. For though Jack was here, safe and\nsound enough, although a bit unlike himself in manner, yet Jack\nhad been at that confounded reception in a woman’s rig and Jack\nhad seen the girl and talked with her–apparently on terms of\nunderstanding.",
        "And if Jack had left Cairo that night, as he said he did–claiming\ndelay on the way due to a tired horse–then Jack knew nothing in the\nworld of the palace fire, and the girl’s sudden and tragic death.",
        "And McLean would have to tell him. He would have to tell him that\nthe girl he was probably dreaming of in some fool’s paradise of\nmemory and hope was now only a little mound of dust in an Oriental\ncemetery. That a shaft of temporary wood already marked the grave of\nAimée Marie Dejane, daughter of Tewfick Pasha and wife of Hamdi\nBey....",
        "And however much McLean’s sound senses might disapprove of the whole\nfantastic affair and his sober judgment commend the workings of\nProvidence, he loved his friend, and he feared that his friend loved\nthis lost girl.",
        "He had to end love and hope and romance and implant a desperate\ngrief....",
        "He thought very steadily of Jinny Jeffries. He cleared his throat.",
        "“Jack, old man–”",
        "He started to tell him that there had been a fire in Cairo, a most\nshocking fire in a haremlik. It seemed to him that Jack was not\nlistening, that he had a faraway, yet intent look upon his face, as\nof one attending to other things. And then suddenly Jack seemed to\ngather resolution and turned to his friend with an air of narration\nof his own.",
        "“Look here, McLean, there’s something I want to tell you–”",
        "“Wait a minute now,” said McLean quietly. “I want you to hear\nthis.... It was a fire in the palace of your friend, Hamdi Bey.”",
        "He had Jack’s attention now–he was fairly conscious of arrested\nbreath. Not looking about him he went grimly on, “The night of the\nwedding a fire started in the haremlik.... It was a bad business, a\nvery bad business, Jack. For the girl–the girl Hamdi had just\nmarried–”",
        "He was conscious of Jack’s look upon him but he did not turn to meet\nit.",
        "“She died,” he said heavily. “He buried her yesterday.”",
        "He thought that Jack was never going to speak.",
        "Then, “Died?” said Ryder in an odd voice.",
        "“I expect she breathed in a bit of smoke,” said McLean, trying for a\nmerciful suggestion.",
        "“And he buried her–?”",
        "Jack was like a child, trying to fit bewildering facts together.\nMcLean’s sympathy hurt him like a physical pain. He wondered what it\ncould be like to realize that some loved one you had just talked\nwith, in radiant life, was now gone utterly....",
        "And then he heard Jack laugh. Mad, he thought quickly, turning now\nto look at him.",
        "Ryder’s head was tilted back; Ryder’s shoulders were shaking. “Oh,\nmy Aunt!” he gasped hysterically. “My Aunt Clarissa–is that what\nHamdi says!”",
        "He sobered instantly and leaned towards McLean. “That looks as if\nhe’s done with her–what? Saving his face that way? You’re sure it\nwas Aimée–the girl he had just married? Not some other girl–some\nco-wife or something?”",
        "And as McLean bewilderedly muttered that he was sure, Ryder began to\nlaugh again. To laugh jubilantly, joyously, triumphantly.",
        "“He’s given her up–he’s got a saving explanation to thrust in the\nworld’s face! Oh, blessed Allah, Veiler of all that should be\nveiled! The man’s through. He’s had enough. He isn’t going to try\nto–”",
        "Across the bright oblong of the entrance a shadow appeared.",
        "“Ryder–I say, Ryder,” said a hurried voice–Thatcher’s voice–and\nThatcher came hastily forward in perturbed urgency.",
        "“There’s a lot of men outside–police and natives and what not. With\nwarrants. They’re searching the place. And they want to see you....\nHang it all, Ryder,” said Thatcher explosively but apologetically,\n\"they say you’ve made off with some sheik’s daughter.”",
        "He paused, shocked at the monstrosity of the accusation. He was a\ndelicate-minded man–outside of his knowledge of antiquities–and he\nevidently expected his young associate to fall upon him and slay him\nfor the slander.",
        "“A sheik’s daughter–?” said Ryder in a mildly wondering voice. From\nhis emphasis one might have inferred he was saying, “How odd! I\ndon’t remember any sheik’s daughter–”",
        "A queer uncomfortable flush spread fanways from Thatcher’s thin\ntemples and rayed across his high cheekbones. He did not look at\neither of the men as he murmured, “It’s most peculiar, but that Arab\nhorse–the sheik claims the horse is his, too. He says you rode off\non it, with his daughter.”",
        "“That’s all right,” said Ryder absently. “I don’t want the horse....\nBut you say the sheik’s there? What does he look like? Thin–with\nblond mustaches?”",
        "“Oh, no, no, not at all. He is quite heavy and bearded–one-eyed, if\nI recollect. But there is a man with a blond mustache who appears\nto do the directing–”",
        "“And you mean they are searching?” said Ryder abruptly. “You’ve let\nthem in–?”",
        "“They have warrants,” Thatcher protested. “And there are proper\npolicemen conducting the search–”",
        "“My good God! Where are they now? Not coming here? I don’t have\nany policemen trampling here and meddling with my finds–tell them\nto clear out, Thatcher, you know there’s no sheik’s daughter here!”",
        "Ryder gave a quick laugh but the impression of his laughter was not\nas sharp as the impression of his alarm.",
        "“I did tell them it was preposterous,” Thatcher began, “but, you\nsee, after finding the horse–”",
        "“Oh, the horse! I got him for a song–of course the beggar is\nstolen. Give him back, if they claim him. But as for any sheik’s\ndaughter–keep the crowd out, Thatcher, I won’t have them here, not\nin these tombs–”",
        "“I tell you they are policemen–they are armed–you can’t resist–”",
        "“How many are they? A lot? But they’ll take your word, won’t they?\nLook here, McLean, can’t you settle this for me and keep them out?”",
        "“The natives have been talking,” murmured Thatcher, reddening still\ndeeper, “and they have said enough about your riding in at night\nand–and keeping to this tomb all day to make the men very\nsuspicious. They are watching this one now–”",
        "“Then keep them back–long as you can. For God’s sake,” entreated\nRyder with that strange passionate violence. “Andy–you do\nsomething–hold them back. Give me time. I–I’ve got to get some\nthings together–I won’t have them at my things–hold them back–out\nhere–till I come.”",
        "He was gone. Gone tearing back into the gloom and silence of his\ntomb. And McLean and Thatcher, astounded witnesses of his outburst,\nturned speedily to the entrance, avoiding each other’s eyes.",
        "Agitatedly Thatcher was murmuring that Ryder’s finds were valuable,\nimmensely valuable, and it was disturbing to contemplate any\ninvasion, and with equal agitation but more mechanical calm McLean\nwas murmuring back that he understood–he quite understood–",
        "As for understanding he was stunned and dazed. A sheik’s daughter!\nAnd the father himself claiming her–under the direction of a\nblond-mustached man.... And a stolen horse.... Jack conceding the\nhorse.... Jack utterly upset at the search party....",
        "But he himself had seen that new-placed shaft with its inscription\nto Aimée Marie Dejane.... What then in the name of wonders did this\nmean? There couldn’t be another girl? McLean’s imagination\nfaltered then dashed on at a gallop. Some–some hand-maiden,\nperhaps, whom Jack had rescued in mistaken chivalry? Perhaps the\nFrench girl has sent a maid on ahead?",
        "McLean’s head was whirling now. One thing appeared quite as possible\nas another. Pasha’s daughters and sheik’s daughters, stolen horses\nand Djinns and Afrits and palaces and masquerades at wedding\nreceptions appeared upon the same plane of feasibility.",
        "Outwardly he was extremely calm. Calm and cold and crisp.",
        "At the mouth of the tomb he detained the party of native policemen\nwith their hangers-on of curious natives and examined, with great\nshow of circumspection and authority, the perfectly regular search\nwarrants which had been issued for them at the instigation of an\napparently bereft parent.",
        "He conversed with the alleged parent, a stolid, taciturn native\ndignitary whose accusations were confirmed by eagerly assenting\nfollowers. He lived in a small village, not far north of the camp.\nHe had a young daughter, very beautiful. Three nights ago he had\nsurprised her with this young American and they had fled upon his\nnoblest horse.",
        "It was a simple and direct story. And Jack–by his own report–had\nbeen out upon the desert that night, had appeared, upon the next\nnight, with this unknown and beautiful horse, and had since kept to\nthe tomb, claiming illness, in a most persistent way.",
        "The camp boys had testified that he had been vividly critical of the\nfood sent in to him, and that he had required extraordinary amounts\nof heated water.",
        "“All of which,” McLean said sternly, in the vernacular, “amounts to\nnothing–unless you can discover the girl.”",
        "“And that, monsieur,” said a Turk in the uniform of the Sultan’s\nguards, appearing beside the desert sheik, “that is exactly what we\nare here to do.”",
        "McLean found himself looking into a thin, menacing face, capped\nwith a red fez, a face deeply lined, marked by light, arrogant eyes\nand embellished with a huge, blond mustache.",
        "“And your interest in this, monsieur?” he questioned.",
        "“I am a friend of Sheik Hassan’s,” said the Turk loftily. “I shall\nsee that my friend obtains his rights.”",
        "And in McLean’s other ear a distraught Thatcher was murmuring “That\nofficer chap is Hamdi Bey–a General of the Guards. You know, Mr.\nMcLean, this really is–you know, it is–”",
        "Hamdi Bey ... Hamdi Bey, two days after his distressing loss,\nbefriending this sheik and trying to involve Jack Ryder in disgrace.",
        "Mystifying. Mystifying and disquieting–yes, disquieting, in the\nface of Jack’s alarm. But for that alarm McLean could have believed\nthe whole thing a farcical attempt of Hamdi’s to revenge himself\nupon Ryder–supposing that Hamdi had discovered Ryder in his\nmasquerade or else as the prowler by night–but Jack’s furious\nanxiety to keep the party out, and his dashing back, ostensibly to\npreserve his things–",
        "Was it actually possible that he had that sheik’s daughter\nconcealed in some nook or cranny of the place?",
        "McLean told himself that it was preposterous. It waspreposterous–but Ryder had been doing preposterous things.... And\nglancing at Thatcher he perceived that that perturbed and\ntransparent gentleman was also telling himself that hissuspicions were preposterous.",
        "The search party, tiring of parley, was moving about the hall in\nbusinesslike inspection.",
        "And then Ryder reappeared, a distinctly alert but self-contained\nRyder, who met the interrogations of the police with scoffing and\nabsolute denial.",
        "But McLean was conscious that there was something tense and nervous\nin his alertness, something wary and defensive in his readiness, and\nhis own nerves began to tighten apprehensively.",
        "It did not add to his composure to see Ryder salute Hamdi Bey with\nan ironic and overdone politeness.",
        "“Ah, monsieur le general! We meet as we parted–in the depths!”",
        "The general appeared to smile as at some amiable pleasantry, but\nMcLean caught the snarl of his lifted lip, and felt the currents of\nanimosity.",
        "So those two had met! Ryder had been discovered then.... McLean\ntried, in futile bewilderment, to recall just what amazing thing\nRyder had been saying when this party had appeared.",
        "He kept very close at that young man’s side as the strange party\nmoved on into the inner chamber. The searchers were scrupulously\ncareful of the excavator’s finds; they did not finger a frieze nor\ndisturb a single small box of the tenderly packed potteries and\nbeads and miniature boats, but they scraped every heap of dust to\nsee if it concealed an entrance, they exhausted the resources of\neach corner, they circled every pillar, shook out every rug of\nJack’s blankets and required the opening of the large chest in which\nthe wax reproductions of the friezes were placed, awaiting\ntransportation.",
        "“You will perceive, messieurs,” declared Ryder in mocking irony,\n\"that no human being is within this last fold of wax–especially a\nbeing,” he added thoughtfully with a glance at the stolid sheik, “of\nthe proportions of her papa.... This daughter, was she a large young\nlady?” he inquired politely of the Arab.",
        "The sheik vouchsafed no reply, but from across his ample person the\ngeneral leaned forward.",
        "“She was small, Monsieur Ryder,” he said in silken tones, “but she\ncan raise a man as high as the gallows–or as low as the grave.”",
        "“A marvel!” returned young Ryder smoothly. “And was she also of\ncharm–a charm that could kindle fires–?”",
        "It appeared to McLean that he caught the flaunting implications of\nthe taunt.",
        "He wished to heaven that Ryder would hold his reckless tongue.",
        "Ryder was turning now to the official in charge of the police.",
        "“If you have satisfied yourselves that this place is empty–”",
        "The man, a rather apologetic, pleasant fellow, shrugged and smiled.\n\"We have examined all–”",
        "There was a moment in which the searchers regarded one another\nthrough the gloom in the inquiring embarrassment of the\ndiscountenanced and considered departure. But Hamdi Bey had more\ninsistent eyes.",
        "He was circling the place again like a wolf for the scent, flashing\nhis search light over the carved walls, the dancing gleam picking\nout now a relief of Osiris, now a fishing boat upon the Nile, now\nthe judgment hall of Maat. Suddenly he stopped and began examining a\nlimestone slab.",
        "“These stones–these have been merely piled here,” he cried\nexcitedly. “This is a hole–an entrance. Dig them out, men. There is\na door there, I tell you.”",
        "Hastily Ryder addressed the police. “It is simply the burial vault,\"\nhe told them. “The sarcophagi are there, ready for transportation.\nMr. Thatcher will tell you–”",
        "“I assure you it is merely the actual tomb,” said Thatcher\nnervously. “I have myself assisted my colleague with the\npreparation.”",
        "The slabs had been displaced now, disclosing the small door, with\nits fine wrought stele. Hamdi flashed a look of triumph upon the man\nwho had obviously tried to conceal that door from them, a look which\nRyder ignored as he turned to McLean.",
        "“That is the door which is sealed forever upon the dead, and upon\nthe Ka, the spiritual double,” he said in a low conversational\ntone. “It has some remarkable representations of the jackal\nAnubis–”",
        "It seemed to McLean a most extraordinary time for a disquisition\nupon Anubis. If Ryder was attempting to prove himself at his ease he\nhad certainly misjudged his manner.",
        "“Damn Anubis,” McLean gave back under his breath. “He’s not the only\njackal–What the devil’s the meaning of this?”",
        "Ryder made no reply. The stone had been pushed back and the\nsearchers were stooping beneath the narrow entrance. Then as\nMcLean’s head bent at the door he heard his friend whispering, “I\nsay–you haven’t a gun you could slip me–?”",
        "Mutely he shook his head. And that agitated whisper died away with\nthe last vestige of belief in Ryder’s innocence. Apprehensively\nMcLean glanced about that inner chamber he was entering, dreading to\nencounter instant and damning evidence of a girl.",
        "He found himself in the presence of the dead. The chamber was a\nsmall, square, walled-up affair, and at one side stood the three\nsarcophagi. The other halls had been in total darkness, but the\nblackness of this place appeared something palpable and weighty. And\nthe air had the dry, acrid tang of dust which has lain waiting for\ncenturies.",
        "It was hot, whereas the other chambers had been cool–or else\nMcLean’s disturbed blood was pumping too furiously through his\npulses. Instinctively he drew close to Jack, as the party stood\nflashing their lights over the bare walls and empty corners, and\nthen concentrated the pale illumination upon those caskets of the\ndead.",
        "“I told you that the place was empty,” Ryder said with distinct\nimpatience in his voice. “And now, if you have satisfied\nyourselves–”",
        "“You are in haste, monsieur,” said Hamdi Bey’s smooth voice. “If you\nwill permit us to see what is within–”",
        "He approached the first sarcophagus.",
        "The sheik, who appeared to have committed the restoration of his\ndaughter into the other’s hands, remained imperturbably beside the\nentrance while the head of the police came forward to assist Hamdi\nin raising the painted lid.",
        "“I protest,” said Ryder very sharply. He stood upon the other side\nof the case, eying them combatively. “It is useless to disturb this\nlid–I tell you that the Persians have been considerably before\nyou.”",
        "And indeed the case was empty. Hamdi moved to the next and again\nRyder took up his post opposite.",
        "“Again I protest,” he insisted. “The least jar or injury–”",
        "But the men raised the lid, and after the briefest look, moved on.",
        "“And now,” Ryder spoke very clearly and authoritatively, addressing\nthe head of the police, “I must ask you to stop. Even the dust that\nyou are disturbing is precious. This thing has gone beyond all\nreason.”",
        "The police official looked as if he agreed with him, but Hamdi Bey\nhad moved determinedly to the third sarcophagus. The official\nhesitated, evidenced discomfort, but moved finally after the bey.",
        "“If there is nothing here,” he murmured, “surely you cannot\nobject–”",
        "“There is precious dust here,” Ryder repeated. “You must\nunderstand–”",
        "“We see for ourselves,” said Hamdi Bey, and now his voice had a ring\nof triumphant steel through its soft smoothness. “Stand aside. This\nis in the name of the law.”",
        "It seemed to McLean that for one mad moment Ryder was tempted to\nresist. In the flickering light of the torches he stood defiantly\nabove the painted mummy case, his eyes steadily upon the bey, his\nhands pressing down upon the vivid bloom of the dead woman’s\npictured face.",
        "Then with a beaten but ironic smile he stood aside.",
        "Slowly the men lifted the lid.... In that moment McLean became aware\nthat his heart was pumping thickly somewhere in his throat and that\nthe rest of him was a hollow, horrible void of suspense.",
        "Hamdi Bey turned his arrogant stare from young Ryder and looked\ndown.... Drawing closer, fearfully McLean’s eyes followed him.",
        "He could not believe their evidence. His heart could not stop its\nidiotic pumping.",
        "But there he saw no terror-stricken girl, no pallid runaway of the\nharems, but a still, dark-shrouded form, swathed in the tight\nbandages of the ancient embalmer, a dry, dusty little mummy creature\nblankly and inscrutably confronting this unforeseen resurrection.",
        "Over their dumbfounded heads he heard young Ryder’s mocking laugh.",
        "IN CAIRO",
        "“It’s good news!” said Miss Jeffries with bright positives.",
        "It was her response to Andrew McLean’s greeting that evening. He\nhad made rather a tardy appearance at the hotel, for there had\nbeen an important dinner with an important bank official passing\nthrough Cairo to escape from, but he arrived at last, looking\nextraordinarily well in his very best dinner clothes.",
        "And Miss Jeffries, for all her harassment of suspense, was no woeful\nobject in a vivacious blue evening frock with silvery gleams.",
        "“He’s safe–absolutely safe,” McLean confirmed.",
        "He expected radiance. Miss Jeffries’ expression was arrested\njudgment.",
        "“Safe–where?”",
        "“At his camp ... I just returned–just in time to dine. I motored\nout this morning.”",
        "“Oh!... It took your whole day. I am so sorry!” For a moment the\ngirl appeared to concentrate her sympathetic interest upon McLean.",
        "“You must simply hate me,” she told him repentantly, dropping into\none of the chairs in the drawing-room corner she had long been\nguarding. “Do sit down and tell me all the horrid details....–Uncle\nand Aunt are in the Lounge, and I should like you to meet them, but\nthey’ll be there forever and I do want to hear first.... Was it\nfearfully hot?”",
        "“Oh, rather,” murmured the young man, confused by this change of\ninterest. “I mean, that’s quite the usual thing, isn’t it, for\ndeserts? I got up a good breeze going, for I was a bit wrought up,\nyou know–not a soul in Cairo had seen Jack since that day.”",
        "“And he was out at his camp,” said Jinny thoughtfully. “How–how\nlong had he been there?”",
        "“He says he started that night,” said McLean non-committally.",
        "“Oh!... That night.... That was rather sudden, wasn’t it?”",
        "“Jack’s sudden, you know,” mentioned his friend uncomfortably. “And\nhe had a lot of finds to pack up for transport–they are taking\ntheir stuff to the museum and Jack had been away so long, here in\nthe city–”",
        "“No wonder I didn’t hear then!” said the girl with a laugh in which\nit would have taken an acuter ear than McLean’s to detect the secret\nclamor of chagrin and humiliation.",
        "Of course she had wanted Jack to be safe.... But he might have\nbeen ill–or away on some official summons–",
        "Just back at his diggings. Gone off on an impulse, with no thought\nto let her know....",
        "And she had rushed to McLean with her silly worries and her anxious\nconcern which he had probably taken for a tender interest....",
        "Heaven knows what disillusionizing thing Jack had said to him that\nday!... Men were too hateful.",
        "And now McLean had come dutifully to report that the man she was so\nworried about was quite well and busy, thank you, only he had\noverlooked any friendship for her, and so had sent no word–",
        "In Jinny’s ears was the rush of the furies’ wings. But on Jinny’s\nlips was a proud little smile, and her bright look was a shining\nshield for the wounds of the spirit.",
        "“That is a comfort,” she said with pleasant, friendly warmth. “You\ndon’t know how horridly responsible I felt! Really, Jack ought to\nhave let me know–but that’s Jack all over. He’s never grown up.”",
        "“He’s not had much time,” returned McLean from the height of his\ntwenty-nine years.",
        "“He never will,” said Jinny sagely, “not until–well, not until\nhe meets some girl, you know, who will make him feel really\nresponsible.”",
        "It occurred unhappily to McLean that the girl Jack had been meeting\nso assiduously of late had certainly not added to his claims to\nresponsibility!",
        "Steadily he guarded silence. There are ice fields, on Mont Blanc,\nwhere a whisper precipitates an avalanche, and McLean had no\nintention of starting anything in his friend’s slippery field of\naffairs.",
        "“I have spent more time,” Miss Jeffries was confiding brightly, for\nthose imperative reasons of her own so obscure to the bewildered\nyoung man, “introducing Jack to nice girls–but it never takes! Not\nseriously. He’s a perfectly dear friend, but he doesn’t care\nanything really about girls–and he does need somebody to get him\nout of his antiquities and his dusty old diggings ... But of course\nyou think I am a sentimental thing!”",
        "McLean did not tell her what he thought. He was still fascinatedly\nengrossed with her revelation of the impeccable Platonic basis of\nher friendship. His mood of complicated emotion lightened and\nbrightened and at the same time an amazed wonder unfolded its\nastonishment.",
        "He marveled at his friend. To turn to something fantastic, something\nbizarre–for so he thought of that veiled girl of the harem–when he\nhad this Miss Jeffries for a friend–but probably the young lady\nherself had never given him the least encouragement. Women are not\neasily moved to romance for men they have always regarded as\nbrothers and he could see that her feeling for Jack was the warm,\nhonest, sisterly affection of utter frankness.",
        "The worse for Jack. For now there seemed no ministering angel to\nmend his troubled future.",
        "It was not only Ryder’s troubled future that troubled McLean–it\nwas also Ryder’s troubled present. He was very far from easy in his\nmind about him. After that mystifying performance in the tomb he had\nnot wanted to leave without a frank explanation, but there had been\nno moment for revelation; Thatcher had hung about them and Hamdi\nBey, of all men, had requested a place in McLean’s motor for the\nreturn to Cairo.",
        "And that dinner engagement had pressed. He could have abandoned it\nfor any real reason, but Jack had assured him that there was none.",
        "“Get the old devil out of here,” had been Jack’s furious appeal,\nreferring to Hamdi. “Deny everything to him. Only get him out.”",
        "And McLean had got him out.",
        "The sheik and his followers after a murmurous conference with the\nbey had galloped off; the police had turned towards their post and\nHamdi had accompanied McLean to the nearest village and his waiting\nmotor.",
        "Clearly he had wanted to talk to McLean and McLean was not sorry for\nthe opportunity to exchange implications. The bey had unfolded his\nsympathetic friendship for the sheik; McLean had unfolded a cold\nsurprise that anything so disgraceful should be attributed to such a\nprominent archaeologist. The bey had produced the evidence and\nMcLean had produced a skeptical wonder, and then a thoughtful wonder\nif the British government had not better take the matter up and sift\nit, for the benefit of all concerned.",
        "Clearly the thing could not go on. Ryder could not accept such a\nrumor against his reputation. Yes, he thought he would advise Ryder\nto take the matter up.",
        "And there he perceived that even the suave and politic Hamdi\nsquirmed. Doubtless to the Turk, McLean represented British prestige\nand political power and all sorts of unknown influence.... And\nnative testimony, while voluable and unscrupulous, had a way of\noffering confused discrepancies to the coldly questioning\ninvestigators of the law.",
        "And with no real evidence against Ryder–",
        "The matter of the sheik’s daughter, McLean perceived, would be\ndropped. Unless the girl–whatever girl they sought–could be\ndiscovered.",
        "If Hamdi wished to pay off some score against the American he would\nchoose other weapons. McLean reflected upon the bey’s capacity for\nassassination or poisoning while he bade him farewell before the\ndark wall of his palace entrance.",
        "Between them had passed no reference to the bey’s recent loss. Since\nit would not have been etiquette for him to mention the bey’s wife,\nhe judged it equally inadvisable to refer to her ashes.",
        "The whole affair was so wrapped in darkness that he could not decide\nupon any creditable explanation. It would have to wait until he saw\nRyder in the next day or two–for Ryder had told him he would try to\nget in with his finds as soon as possible.",
        "But no matter how he tried to dismiss the matter from his mind he\nhad found himself asking, through the courses of that important\ndinner and now in the pauses of his conversation with Miss\nJeffries–Was there really some girl? Had he only dreamed that tense\nanxiety of Jack’s–had Jack led them on for his own young amusement?",
        "But it was not long possible to maintain an inner communion with\nJinny Jeffries for a vis-à-vis.",
        "A divided mind could not companion her swift flights and sudden\ntangents. Deriding now her silly anxieties and deploring McLean’s\nunnecessary trip, she had branched into the consideration of how\nbusy McLean must be–and McLean found himself somehow embarked in\nsketchy descriptions of the institution of which Miss Jeffries\nseemed to think he was the backbone and of its very interesting work\nthroughout the country.",
        "And as he had talked he found himself noticing things that he had\nnever noticed before about girls, the wave of bright hair against a\nflushed cheek, the dimples in a rounded arm, the slim grace of\ncrossed ankles and silver-slippered feet.",
        "“And you live all alone in that big house?” Jinny was murmuring.",
        "“Not exactly alone.” McLean smiled. “There’s Mohammed and Hassan and\nAbdullah and Alewa and Saord-el-Tawahi–”",
        "“What do you call him when you are in a hurry?” laughed the girl.",
        "It was a tremendously pleasant evening. He had expected constraint\nand secret embarrassment and he had discovered this delightful\ninterest and bright vivacity.",
        "And if beneath that interest and vivacity something lay forever\nstilled and chilled in Miss Jeffries’ breast–like a poor hidden\ncorpse beneath bright roses–why at two and twenty expectancies\nflourish so gayly that one lone bud is not long missed. And chagrin\nis sometimes a salutary transient shower, and self-confidence is all\nthe more delicate for a dimming cloud.",
        "Moreover McLean’s unconscious absorption was balm and blessing.",
        "When in startled realization of time and place he rose at last and\nshe murmured laughing, “And after all you never met Aunt and Uncle!\"\nhe felt a queer blush tingle his cheek bones and a daring impulse\nshape the thought aloud that in that case he must come again.",
        "“We’re here five days more,” said Jinny, the explicit.",
        "Thoughtfully he repeated, “Five days,” and said farewell.",
        "“Now if he decorously waits to the next to the last day–!” murmured\nJinny to herself, her opinion of the Scots race hanging in the\nbalance.",
        "He didn’t. But it was not the initiative of the Scots race which\nbrought him to her, late that very next afternoon, but a soiled\nlooking note which he held crumpled in his hand.",
        "He found her at tea upon the veranda with her aunt and uncle and\nwhile he made conversation with the Pendletons he gave Miss Jeffries\nthe note.",
        "“From our friend Ryder,” he said with forced lightness. “It explains\nitself.”",
        "But it certainly did not. It was a hasty scrawl to McLean, saying\nthat Ryder was on his way with the museum finds and sending this\nahead by runner, and that McLean must positively be at the Cairo\nMuseum to meet him at five and would he please stop on the way and\ncall at his hotel upon a Miss Jeffries and borrow a woman’s cloak\nand hat and veil, or if she wasn’t in, get them elsewhere.",
        "“What is it–another masquerade?” said Jinny blankly.",
        "McLean looked mutely at her and shook his head, but within him\nhorrific suspicion was raging like a forest fire.",
        "He continued his converse with the Pendletons while Jinny went for\nthe things; she returned with a small bag containing coat and hat\nand veil, and the announcement that she would go right over with\nhim.",
        "“If the things aren’t right I’ll know what he wants,” she declared,\nand then, smiling, “What do you suppose he is up to now?”",
        "McLean felt that he didn’t want to know. And most positively he\ndidn’t want her to know. But having lacked the instant inspiration\nto deny her, he could only acquiesce and wonder why he hadn’t\nthought up some brilliant excuse.",
        "He looked helplessly at the Pendletons, but they merely murmured\ntheir adieux and their independent niece accompanied McLean to his\nwaiting carriage as if it were the most natural thing in the world.",
        "The caravan was before them. A long line of camels was just turning\nin the gates and before the steps of a back entrance other camels,\nkneeling with that profound and squealing resentment with which even\nthe camel’s most exhausted moments oppose commands, were being\nrelieved of their huge loads by natives under the very minute and\nexact direction of Thatcher.",
        "And within the entrance a young man with rumpled dark hair and a\nthin, bronzed face flushed with impatience was imperiously conveying\nthe Arabs who were bearing the precious sarcophagi.",
        "Over his shoulder he caught sight of the two arrivals.",
        "“I asked for motors–and they furnished these!” he cried\ndisgustedly, gesturing at the enduring camels. “It took us all day\nthough we half killed the brutes.... Hello, Jinny, did you bring the\nthings?”",
        "With light casualness he accepted her appearance on the scene. That\nglitter in his bright hazel eyes was not for that. “Come in, both\nof you,” he called, plunging after his men.",
        "At the foot of the stairs McLean waited with Miss Jeffries until the\nmen had reached the top and deposited their burdens in the room and\nin the manner which Ryder was specifying so crisply, and then they\ncame mechanically up.",
        "McLean had the automatic feeling of a mere super in a well rehearsed\nscene. He had no idea of plot or appearance but his rôle of dumb\nsubservience was clearly defined.",
        "“You understand,” Ryder was calling to the men, “nothing more goes\nin this room. All else down stairs.... Come in,” he said hurriedly\nto his waiting friends, and shutting the door swiftly behind them,\n\"of course–this doesn’t lock!” he muttered. “Jinny, you stand here,\ndo, and if any one tries to come in tell them they can’t.”",
        "“Tell them you say they can’t?” questioned Jinny a little\nhelplessly.",
        "“No–no–not that. Tell them you are using the room; tell them,\"\nsaid Ryder with very brisk and serious inspiration, “tell them your\npetticoat is coming off!”",
        "“Why Jack Ryder!” said Jinny indignantly.",
        "“Nonsense,” said he to her indignation. “Don’t you remember when\nyour aunt’s petticoat came off on the way to church? It happens.”",
        "“But it doesn’t run in families!”",
        "Her protest fell apparently upon the back of his head. He had\nturned to the last sarcophagus and was slipping his fingers beneath\nthe lid. “Here, Andy,” he said quickly. “I had it wedged so it\nwasn’t tight shut, but it’s been so infernally hot and dusty–”",
        "He was tremendously troubled. It was not the heat which had brought\nthose fine beads of moisture to his brow, white above the line of\nbrown, and drawn such a pale ring about his mouth. McLean saw that\nthe slim, wiry wrists which supported the case’s top were shaking.",
        "“Gently now,” he murmured and the lid was lifted and laid aside.",
        "The same dark, unstirring form of the tomb scene. The same dry,\ndusty little mummy.... But with hands strangely reckless for an\narchaeologist dealing with the priceless stuff of time Ryder tore at\nthose bandages; he unwrapped, he unwound, and in a lightning’s\nflash–",
        "To McLean’s tense, expectant nerves it was like a scene at the\npantomime. He had divined it; he had foreseen and yet there was the\nshock and eerie thrill of magic, the appealing unreality of the\nsupernatural in the revelation.",
        "In a wave of an enchanter’s wand the mummy was gone. And in its\nplace lay a Sleeping Beauty, the dark hair in sculptured closeness\nto the head, the long, black lashes sweeping the still cheeks.",
        "THE PAINTED CASE",
        "“She’s fainted,” said Ryder in a voice that shook. From his pocket\nhe drew swiftly a thermos bottle but before the top was off those\nlong lashes fluttered, and from under their shadow the soft, dark\neyes looked up at him with a smile of very gallant reassurance.",
        "“Not–faint,” said the girl, in a breath of a voice. “But it was so\nlong–so hot–”",
        "“Drink this.” Ryder slipped an arm about her, offering the filled\ntop of the thermos. “It’s over, all over,” he murmured as she drank.\n\"You’re safe now, safe.... You’re at the museum.... Then we’ll get\nyou to the hotel–”",
        "“Hotel–?” the girl echoed with a faint implication of humor in that\nsilver bell of a voice.",
        "She put her hands to her hair and to her face in which the hues of\nlife mingled with the pallor of exhaustion; on her small fingers\nsparkled the gleam of diamonds and from her slender arms fell back\nthe gold and jade tissues of her chiffon robe.",
        "To McLean she had increasingly the appearance of a creature of\nenchantments. And to see that young loveliness in its strange gleam\nof color lying against his friend’s supporting tan linen arm–",
        "Sardonically his eyes sought Ryder.",
        "“So that was your mummy!”",
        "“There was nothing else to do.” Ryder had withdrawn his arm; the two\nmen faced each other across the girl. “I was in a blue funk–you\nsee, I was hiding her in the inner chamber until I could smuggle her\naway. And when those wolves came on the scent, and not an instant to\nlose–I got the bandages off the real mummy and about Aimée....\nLord, it was a close call!”",
        "He drew a long breath. “I hadn’t a gun. I hadn’t a thing–and I had\nto grin and play it through ... And I was deathly afraid of\nThatcher.”",
        "“Thatcher?”",
        "“Yes, Thatcher. You see I’d popped the mummy into a case without its\nbandages and if Thatcher had glimpsed that he’d have said\nsomething–Oh, innocently–that would have given the show away. He\nknew there was only one mummy and it was wrapped. But the Lord was\nwith me. The men opened the empty case first and at the second they\nsaid nothing to show it wasn’t empty and Thatcher didn’t look in.\nThen they went on to the third.”",
        "“And me–when I heard those voices–I stopped breathing,” said the\ngirl. “But I shook so–I thought they would think that mummy was\ncoming to life! And the dust–Oh, it was almost beyond my force not\nto sneeze–”",
        "“You’d have sneezed us to Kingdom Come,” said Ryder, gayly now.",
        "“But I did not,” she protested. “I lay there and thought of Hamdi\nlooking down upon me, and my flesh crept.... Oh, it was terrible!\nAnd yet it was funny.”",
        "Funny.... McLean gazed in sardonic astonishment upon the two young\ncreatures with such misguided humor that they found something funny\nin this appalling business. Flying from palaces ... hiding in tombs\n... taking a mummy’s place beneath the dusty bandages of the dead\n... Funny....",
        "And yet there was laughter in their young eyes when they looked at\neach other and a curve of astounding amusement in their lips.",
        "It touched McLean to wonder. It touched him–queerly–to an odd and\naching pain. For he saw suddenly that he was looking upon something\ndeathless and imperishable, yet fragile and fleeting as the breath\nof time....",
        "They were so young, so absorbed, so oblivious....",
        "He had forgotten Jinny Jeffries. So too,–not for the first time,\nalas!–had Ryder. Now her clear voice from the doorway made them\nstart.",
        "“You might present me, Jack.”",
        "Ryder turned, so did the girl in the painted case, and her eyes\nwidened with a startled surprise. The doorway had not been within\nher vision.",
        "Jinny was leaning back against the door, her hand behind her on the\nknob she was to guard, her figure still rigid with astonishment.",
        "“I didn’t know you–you dug them up–alive,” she said with a quiver\nof uncertain humor.",
        "“My dear Jinny, I had for–Miss Jeffries, let me present you to\nMademoiselle Delcassé,” said Jack gravely. “I know that you met her\nthe day of her reception–”",
        "Only in that moment did Jinny place the haunting recollection.",
        "“But she was burned–she was killed,” she protested, shaken now with\nexcitement.",
        "“She was not burned–although there was a fire. The man who called\nhimself her husband pretended she was killed in order to save his\npride. For she escaped from him. And he tried to get her back,\nsetting another man, a false father, after her with lying\nwitnesses–Oh, it’s a long story!–so I had to hide her in this\ncase.”",
        "“But Jack, you–why were you hiding her–? Did you get her out?\"\nstammered Jinny.",
        "“The night of that reception. You see, I knew she was truly a French\ngirl who had been stolen by Tewfick Pasha and brought up as his\ndaughter–Oh, that’s a long story, too! But at McLean’s I had\nhappened on the agents who were searching for her from her aunt in\nFrance, and so I knew.... And at the reception when I found she\nhated that marriage I stayed behind and–and managed to get her\naway,\"–thus lightly did Ryder indicate the dangers of that\nnight!–\"so she could escape to France.”",
        "“Oh–France!” said Jinny.",
        "She could be forgiven for the tone. She had been kept shamefully in\nthe dark, misled, ignored.... She had been a catspaw, a bystander.",
        "Not that she cared. Not that she would let them think for a minute\nthat she cared....",
        "But as for this talk of France–",
        "Her eyes met the eyes of the girl in the mummy case. And Jinny found\nherself looking, not at the interloper, the enchantress, but at a\nvery young, frightened girl, lost in a strange world, but resolved\nupon courage. She saw more than the men could see. She saw the\nloveliness, the helplessness, and she saw too the sensitive dignity,\nthe delicate, defensive spirit....",
        "Really, she was a child.",
        "And to have gone through so much, dared such danger.... She\nremembered that dark, forbidding palace, the guarded doors, the\nhideous blacks–and that bright, smiling figure in its misty\nveil.... And now that little figure sat in its strange hiding place,\nconfronting her with a lost child’s eyes....",
        "Into Jinny’s bright gray eyes came a mist of tears. She was queerly\nmoved. It was a mingled emotion, but if some drops for her own\ndisconcertment were mingled with the warm prompting of pity, her\ncompassion was none the less true.",
        "“I’ll be so glad to do anything I can to help,” she said\nimpulsively. “If you have no friends to trust in Cairo–”",
        "“I have no friends to trust–beyond this room,” said the girl.",
        "“Then I’ll take you to the hotel with me. You can register as one of\nour party and keep your room till we leave–we are going in four\ndays now. And, oh, I know! You can cross on the same steamer with us\nto Europe, for there’s a woman at the hotel who wants to give up her\ntransportation and go on to the Holy Land–she was moaning about it\nonly this noon. It would all fit in beautifully.”",
        "It seemed to McLean that an angel from Heaven was revealing her\nblessed goodness.",
        "Ryder took the revelation delightedly for granted.",
        "“Bully for you, Jinny,” he said warmly. “I knew I could count on\nyou.”",
        "If for one moment a twinge of wry reminder recalled that she had\nnever been able exactly to count upon him it did not dim his mood.\nHe was alight with triumph.",
        "“I’ll see to the transportation,” he said quickly, doing mental\narithmetic about present sums in the bank. “And we won’t wire your\naunt until you’re safely out of Egypt–better send a wireless from\nthe ship. I think your aunt is near Paris–”",
        "“We are going to hurry to Paris,” said Jinny, “That was our regular\nplan–”",
        "“And London?” said McLean.",
        "“London, later, of course. Cathedrals, lakes and universities–then\nLondon.”",
        "“I shall be in London,” said McLean thoughtfully, “in June.... If\nyou are not too occupied–”",
        "“With cathedrals?” said Miss Jeffries.",
        "“Where are the things?” demanded Ryder ruthlessly, and thus\nrecalled, Jinny produced the bag.",
        "McLean moved toward the door. “We might go and mount guard in the\ncorridor,” he suggested, and he and Jinny stepped outside, back into\nthe everyday world of Egypt where nothing at all had been happening\nbut the arrival of a caravan from the excavations.",
        "Within the room Ryder stooped and lifted the girl from the case and\nset her lightly on the floor. Ruefully she shook out the torn\nchiffons of that French audacity of a robe, and with a whimsical\nsmile surveyed the soiled little slippers that she had discarded in\nher disguise when she had ridden behind the turbaned Ryder upon the\nArab horse.",
        "So little time ago, and yet so long away–",
        "Under her long lashes she looked up at the young man, who had set\nthe old life crumbling about her at a touch. Wistfulness edged the\nbrave smile with which she murmured, “And so it is all arranged–so\nquick. I am safe–I go to the hotel with that nice girl–”",
        "“And I won’t be able to see you,” he said suddenly.",
        "“But you have seen me, monsieur, these many days–”",
        "“Seen you? I haven’t seen you. I’ve sat outside a tomb on guard,\nI’ve marched beside a mummy case–and–and we’ve said so little–”",
        "It was true. They had said little. The hours had been absorbed in\naction. Their words had always been of explanation, of reassurance,\nof anxious planning. Of the future, the future after safety had been\nachieved, they had said nothing. It had all been uncertain,\nnebulous, vague....",
        "And now it was upon them.",
        "“And I have never said Thank you,” she murmured. “I–I think I began\nby saying Thank you, monsieur. I remember saying that my education\nhad proceeded to the Ts!”",
        "“If–if only you never want to unsay it,” he muttered. “You don’t\nknow what’s ahead–life’s so uncertain–”",
        "“No, I do not know what is ahead,” she told him, “but I am\nfree–free for whatever will come.”",
        "The brightness of that freedom shone suddenly from her upturned\nface.",
        "“Anything is better than that man,” she vowed. “Even if my aunt,\nthat Madame Delcassé, should not like me–you see, I have thought of\neverything, and I am not afraid.”",
        "“Like you–? She’ll love you,” said Ryder bitterly. “She’ll go mad\nover you and give you all she has–she’ll marry you to a count–”",
        "“Another marriage?” Aimée raised brows of mockery. “But I am through\nwith the marriages of convenience–”",
        "“You’re so lovely, darling, that you’ll have the world at your\nfeet,” said the young man huskily.",
        "He looked at her with eyes that could not hide their pain. “Oh,\nI–you–it’s not fair–” he muttered incoherently.",
        "He had meant–ever since that sobering moment of guardianship in the\ndesert–to be very fair. He would not bind her with a word, a touch.\nNot since that impulsive clasp of reunion in the palace had he\ntouched her in caress. With the reverence of his deep tenderness he\nhad served her in the tomb, meaning to deny his heart, to delay its\nrevelation, to wait upon her freedom and her youth....",
        "Nobly he had resolved.... But now parting was upon him.",
        "“It’s not fair to you,” he said desperately–and drew closer.",
        "For at his blurted words her look had magically changed. The\ndefensive lightness was fled. A breathless wonder shone out at him\n... a delicious shyness brushed with dancing expectation like the\ngleam of a butterfly’s wing.",
        "No glamorous moonlight was about them now. No scented shadowy\ngarden.... But the enchantment was there, in the bare and dusty\nroom, with its grim old mummy cases, the enchantment and the very\nflame of youth.",
        "“Sweet, I’ll be on the ship–I’ll wait till you are ready,” he vowed\nand at her low murmur, “Ready–?” he gave back, “Ready–for love,\"\nwith a boy’s stammer over the first sound of that word between them.",
        "“But what is this now,” she said wondering, yet with a little elfish\ngleam of laughter, “but–love?”",
        "His last resolve went to the winds.",
        "And as his arms closed about her, as he held to his heart all that\nyoung loveliness that had been his despair and his delight, there\nwas more than joy in the confused tumult of his youth, there was\nthe supreme exultation of triumphant daring.",
        "For he had opened the forbidden door; he had challenged the\nadventure and overcome the risk.",
        "He had won. And he would hold his winnings.",
        "“Aimée,” he whispered. “Aimée–Beloved.”",
