        "1. While the great sovereigns of Europe were busy in fighting the\nMoslems in Palestine, they did not entirely neglect affairs at home.\nSome of them were very good rulers, protecting their subjects and\nmaintaining good order, and others were tyrannical and imposed all\nsorts of taxes and heavy burdens upon the people. Up among the Alps,\nwhere the country is made up of rough, rocky mountains and narrow\nvalleys, lived a people who were practically free. They lived in\nlittle communities, each one of which elected its own magistrate or\ngovernor, and made its own laws. The region was so poor and rough that\nthe neighboring kings little cared to get possession of it, and the\nAlpine dwellers had a greater amount of freedom than any other people\nof Europe. The country was divided into little separate communities,\none of which was called Schwytz, and this afterward gave the name to\nthe whole country–Switzerland.",
        "2. This country of the Swiss was really a part of the German empire,\nbut the emperors had extended their rule over the lower parts of the\ncountry, leaving the forest cantons free. And a brave, courageous, and\nindustrious people grew up there. No pauper-house among the Alps, for\nevery able-bodied person worked, and no body tried to rob his neighbor\nof his honest earnings. They were a strong athletic race, and the\nmonarchs of the surrounding countries were glad to secure Swiss\nsoldiers, for it was said that the Swiss never deserted. In 1298,\nwhile Wallace was struggling for freedom in Scotland, Albert of\nAustria, the second of the house of Hapsburg, resolved to get\npossession of the free forest cantons. He observed great secrecy in\ncarrying out his designs, and it was not until a tax-gatherer or\nbailiff was permanently established in the country, supported by\nAustrian soldiers, that the people awakened to their danger. The story\nthat follows is one that all true Swiss delight to believe, and,\nthough it may not be true in regard to names and details, yet as a\nrecord of the main incidents of history it is substantially correct.",
        "3. The first Austrian bailiff was Hermann Gessler, who built a strong\nfortress at Küssnacht, in Uri. At first he professed great love for\nthe people, but when he became firmly established he threw off the\nmask, and showed himself to be a cruel, cowardly, mean-spirited\ntyrant. He was both vain and greedy, and he exacted both homage and\ntribute from the surrounding peasantry. Property was seized by the\nsoldiers, and, should the owner venture to remonstrate, he was\nmercilessly beaten or killed on the spot. Complaints to the governor\nwere followed by fresh outrages, until no one, even in the most\nsecluded valleys, considered himself safe. Here tyranny as usual\noverstepped the bounds of safety. The free spirit, born of toil and\nprivations in the mountain-fastnesses, would not long endure the\noutrages to which the people were subjected. A leader only was needed\nto induce a general revolt, and this leader was found in the person of\nWilliam Tell.",
        "4. William Tell, according to the received accounts, was born at\nBürgelen, a secluded hamlet in the canton of Uri, near the lake of\nLucerne, about the year 1275; and, like his forefathers, was the\nproprietor of a cottage, a few small fields, a vineyard, and an\norchard. When William had reached the age of twenty, his father is\nsaid to have died, bequeathing to him these humble possessions.\nEndowed by nature with a lofty and energetic mind, Tell was\ndistinguished also by great physical strength and manly beauty. He was\ntaller by a head than most of his companions; he loved to climb the\nrugged rocks of his native mountains in pursuit of the chamois, and to\nsteer his boat across the lake in time of storm and of danger. The\nload of wood which he could bear upon his shoulders was double that\nwhich any ordinary man could support.",
        "5. With other sources of happiness, Tell combined that of possessing\nan intimate friend, who dwelt amid the rocky heights separating Uri\nfrom Unterwalden. Arnold Auderhalden, of Melchthal, was this\nassociate. Although similar in many salient points of character, there\nwas still an essential difference between the two men. Arnold, of\nMelchthal, while he loved his country with an ardor equal to that of\nTell, and was capable of very great actions, was not prepared for much\npatient suffering or long endurance of wrong. Tell, whose temperament\nwas more calm, and whose passions were more influenced by reason than\nimpulse, only succeeded in restraining his friend’s impulsive\ncharacter by the stern force of example. Meantime the two friends\npassed their days in the enjoyment of one another’s society, visiting\nat intervals each other’s humble residence. Tell foresaw, on the\narrival of Gessler, many of the misfortunes which must inevitably\nfollow his iron rule, and without explaining his views even to Arnold,\nof Melchthal, without needlessly alarming his family, endeavored to\ndevise some means, not of bearing the yoke patiently, but of\ndelivering his country from the galling oppression which Albert had\nbrought upon it. The hero felt satisfied that the evil deeds of the\ngovernor would sooner or later bring just retribution upon him; for\nthis, and many other reasons, therefore, despite his own secret\nwishes, when Arnold poured out his fiery wrath in the ear of his\nfriend, he listened calmly, and, to avoid inflaming him more, avowed\nnone of his own views, or even feelings, in return.",
        "6. One evening, however, William Tell and his wife sat in front of\ntheir cottage, watching their son amusing himself amid the flocks,\nwhen the former grew more thoughtful and sad than usual. Presently\nTell spoke, and for the first time imparted to his wife some of his\nmost secret designs. While the conversation was still proceeding, the\nparents saw their son rush toward them crying for help, and shouting\nthe name of old Melchthal. As he spoke, Arnold’s father appeared in\nsight, led by his grand-child, and feeling his way with a stick. Tell\nand his wife hastened forward, and discovered, to their inconceivable\nhorror, that their friend was blind, his eyes having been put out with\nhot irons. The hero of Bürgelen, burning with just indignation, called\non the old man to explain the fearful sight, and also the cause of\nArnold’s absence.",
        "7. It appeared that that very morning the father, son, and\ngrand-daughter were in the fields loading a couple of oxen with\nproduce for the market-town, when an Austrian soldier presented\nhimself, and, having examined the animals, which appeared to suit his\nfancy, ordered their owner to unyoke the beasts preparatory to his\ndriving them off. Adding insolence to tyranny, he further remarked\nthat such clod-poles might very well draw their own plows and carts.\nArnold, furious at the man’s daring impertinence, was only restrained\nby his father’s earnest entreaties from sacrificing the robber on the\nspot; nothing, however, could prevent him from aiming a blow at the\nsoldier, which broke two of his fingers.",
        "8. The enraged soldier then retreated; but old Melchthal, who well\nknew the character of Gessler, immediately forced Arnold, much against\nhis inclination, to go and conceal himself for some days in the Righi.\nScarcely had Arnold departed in this direction, when a detachment of\nguards from Altorf surrounded their humble tenement, and dragged old\nMelchthal before Gessler, who ordered him to give up his son. Furious\nat the refusal which ensued, the tyrant commanded the old man’s eyes\nto be put out, and then sent him forth blind to deplore his\nmisfortunes.",
        "9. Tell heard the story of Melchthal in silence, and, when he had\nfinished, inquired the exact spot of his son’s concealment. The father\nreplied that it was in a particular cavern of Mount Righi, the desert\nrocks of which place are unknown to the emissaries of the governor,\nand there he had promised to remain until he received his parent’s\npermission to come forth. This Tell requested might be granted\nimmediately; and, turning to his son, ordered him to start at once for\nthe Righi with a message to Arnold. Walter obeyed gladly; and,\nproviding himself with food, and receiving private instructions from\nhis father, went on his journey under cover of the night.",
        "10. Tell himself then threw around his own person a cloak of\nwolf-skin, seized his quiver full of sharp arrows, and, taking his\nterrible bow, which few could bend, in hand, bade adieu to his wife\nfor a few days, and took his departure in an opposite direction from\nthat pursued by his son. It was quite dawn when Walter reached the\nRighi, and a slight column of blue smoke speedily directed him to the\nspot where Arnold lay concealed. The intrusion at first startled the\nfugitive; but, recognizing Tell’s son, he listened eagerly to his\ndismal story, the conclusion of which roused in him so much fury that\nhe would have rushed forth at once to assassinate Gessler had not\nWalter restrained him.",
        "11. Schooled by Tell, he informed him that his father was engaged in\npreparing vengeance for the tyrant’s crime, being at that moment with\nWerner Stauffacher concerting proper measures of resistance. “’Go,’\nsaid my father, ’and tell Arnold of this new villany of the\ngovernor’s, and say that it is not rage which can give us just\nrevenge, but the utmost exertion of courage and prudence. I leave\nSchwytz to bid Werner arm his canton: let Melchthal go to Stautz and\nprepare the men of Unterwalden for the outbreak; having done this, let\nhim meet me, with Fürst and Werner, in the field of Grütli!’”",
        "12. Arnold, scarcely taking time to refresh himself with food, sent\nWalter on his homeward journey, while he started for Stautz. Walter,\nwhen alone, turned his steps toward Altorf, where unfortunately, and\nunknown to himself, he came into the presence of Gessler, to whom he\nuttered somewhat hard things about the state of the country, being led\nto commit himself by the artful questions of the tyrant, who\nimmediately ordered the lad into confinement, with strict injunctions\nto the guards to seize whomsoever should claim him.",
        "13. Meanwhile, certain doubts and fears, from he knew not what cause,\narose in the mind of Gessler, and struck him with a presentiment that\nall was not right. He imagined that the people wore in their looks\nless abject submission to his authority, and, the better to satisfy\nhimself of the correctness or erroneousness of this view, he commanded\nBerenger to erect at dawn of day, in the market-place of Altorf, a\npole, on the point of which he was to place the ducal cap of Austria.\nAn order was further promulgated, to the effect that every one passing\nnear or within sight of it should make obeisance, in proof of his\nhonor and fealty to the duke.",
        "14. Numerous soldiers under arms were directed to surround the place,\nto keep the avenues, and to compel the passers-by to bend with proper\nrespect to the emblem of the governing power of the three cantons.\nGessler likewise determined that whoever should disobey the mandate\nshould be accused of disaffection, and treated accordingly; a measure\nwhich promised both to discover the discontented, and furnish\nsufficient grounds for their punishment. Numerous detachments of\ntroops, among whom money had been previously distributed, were then\nplaced around to see that his commands were scrupulously obeyed.\nHistory scarcely records another instance of tyranny so galling and\nhumiliating to the oppressed, and so insolent on the part of its\nauthor.",
        "15. The proceedings of Tell in the interval were of the deepest\nconcern to the country. Having arrived within the territory of\nSchwytz, and at the village of Stainea, he called at the house of\nWerner, and, being admitted, threw at his feet a heavy bundle of\nlances, arrows, cross-bows, and swords. “Werner Stauffacher,” cried\nTell, “the time is come for action!” and without a moment’s delay he\ninformed his friend of all that had passed, dwelling minutely on every\ndetail. And, when he had at length finished, the cautious Werner could\nrestrain his wrath no longer, but exclaimed, clasping the hero’s hand,\n“Friend, let us begin; I am ready!” After further brief conference,\nthey, by separate ways, carried round arms to their friends in the\ntown and neighboring villages. Many hours were thus consumed; and,\nwhen their weapons were at last distributed, they both returned to\nStauffacher’s house, snatched some slight refreshment, and then sped\non their way to Grütli, accompanied by ten of their most tried\nadherents.",
        "16. The lake of Lucerne was soon reached, and a boat procured. Werner,\nperceiving the furious tempest, inquired of Tell if his skill would\nenable him to struggle against the storm. “Arnold awaits us!” cried\nWilliam; “and the fate of our country depends on this interview!” With\nthese words he leaped into the boat, Werner jumped after him, and the\nrest followed. Tell cast loose the agitated vessel, seized the tiller,\nand, hoisting sail, the little craft flew along the waves.",
        "17. Presently, it is said, the wind moderated, and ere they reached\nthe opposite side had ceased altogether–a phenomenon common in these\nmountain lakes. The boat was now made fast, and the conspirators\nhastened to the field of Grütli, where, at the mouth of a cavern of\nthe same name, Arnold and Walter Fürst awaited them, each with ten\nother companions. Tell allowed no consideration of natural feeling to\nsilence the calls of duty, but at once came to the point. He first\ngave a brief sketch of the state of the country under the Austrian\nbailiffs, and, having shown to the satisfaction of his companions the\nnecessity for immediate and combined action, is related to have added:\n“We may have our plans frustrated by delay, and the time has come for\naction. I ask only a few days for preparation. Unterwalden and Schwytz\nare armed. Three hundred and fifty warriors are, I am assured, ready.\nI will remain in Altorf, and, as soon as I receive tidings from Fürst,\nwill fire a huge pile of wood near my house. At this signal let all\nmarch to the rendezvous, and, when united, we will pour down upon\nAltorf, where I will then strive to rouse the people!”",
        "18. This plan of the campaign was agreed to; and it was further\nresolved that, in the enterprise upon which they were now embarked, no\none should be guided by his own private opinion, nor ever forsake his\nfriends; that they should jointly live or jointly die in defense of\nthe common cause; that each should in his own vicinity promote the\nobject in view, trusting that the whole nation would one day have\ncause to bless their friendly union; that the Count of Hapsburg should\nbe deprived of none of his lands, vassals, or prerogatives; that the\nfreedom which they had inherited from their fathers they were\ndetermined to assert, and to hand down to their children untainted and\nundiminished. Then Stauffacher, Fürst, and Melcthal, and the other\nconspirators, stepped forward, and, raising their hands, swore that\nthey would die in defense of that freedom. After this solemn oath, and\nafter an agreement that New Year’s Day should be chosen for the\noutbreak, unless, in the meantime, a signal fire should arouse the\ninhabitants on some sudden emergency, the heroes separated. Arnold\nreturned to Stautz, Werner to Schwytz, while Tell and Fürst took their\nway to Altorf. The sun already shone brightly as Tell entered the\ntown, and he at once advanced into the public place, where the first\nobject which caught his eye was a handsome cap embroidered with gold\nstuck upon the end of a long pole. Soldiers walked around it in\nrespectful silence, and the people of Altorf, as they passed, bowed\ntheir heads profoundly to the symbol of power.",
        "19. Tell was much surprised at this new and strange manifestation of\nservility, and, leaning on his cross-bow, gazed contemptuously both on\nthe people and the soldiers. Berenger, captain of the guard, at length\nobserved this man, who alone, amid a cringing populace, carried his\nhead erect. He went to him, and fiercely asked why he neglected to pay\nobedience to the orders of Hermann Gessler? Tell replied that he saw\nno reason why he should bow to a hat, or even to the one which the hat\nrepresented. This bold language surprised Berenger, who ordered Tell\nto be disarmed, and then, surrounded by guards, he was carried before\nthe governor. “Wherefore,” demanded the incensed bailiff, “Hast thou\ndisobeyed my orders, and failed in thy respect to the emperor? Why\nhast thou dared to pass before the sacred badge of thy sovereign\nwithout the evidence of homage required of thee?” “Verily,” answered\nTell, with mock humility, “how this happened I know not; ’tis an\naccident, and no mark of contempt. Suffer me, therefore, in thy\nclemency to depart.”",
        "20. Gessler was irritated at this reply, feeling assured that there\nwas something beneath the tranquil and bitter smile of the prisoner\nwhich he could not fathom. Suddenly he was struck by the resemblance\nwhich existed between him and the boy Walter, whom he had met the\nprevious day, and immediately ordered him to be brought forward.",
        "21. Gessler now inquired the prisoner’s name, which he no sooner\nlearned than he recognized as that of the archer so celebrated\nthroughout the canton. As soon as the youth arrived, the governor\nturned to Tell and told him that he had heard of his extraordinary\ndexterity, and was accordingly determined to put it to proof. “While\nbeholding justice done, the people of Altorf shall also admire thy\nskill. Thy son shall be placed a hundred yards distant, with an apple\non his head; if thou hast the good fortune to carry off the apple in\ntriumph with one of thy arrows, I pardon both, and restore your\nliberty. If thou refusest this trial, thy son shall die before thine\neyes!”",
        "22. Tell implored Gessler to spare him so cruel an experiment, but,\nfinding the governor inexorable, the hero submitted to the trial. He\nwas conducted into the public place, where the required distance was\nmeasured by Berenger–a double row of soldiers shutting up three sides\nof the square. The people, awe-stricken and trembling, pressed behind.\nWalter stood with his back to a linden tree, patiently awaiting the\nexciting moment. Hermann Gessler, some distance behind, watched every\nmotion. His cross-bow and belt were handed to Tell; he tried the\npoint, broke the weapon, and demanded his quiver. It was brought to\nhim, and emptied at his feet. William stooped down, and, taking a long\ntime to choose one, managed to hide a second in his girdle; the other\nhe held in his hand, and proceeded to string his bow, while Berenger\ncleared away the remaining arrows. After hesitating, he drew the bow,\naimed, shot, and the apple, struck through the core, was carried away\nby the arrow.",
        "23. The market-place was filled by loud cries of admiration. Walter\nflew to embrace his father, who, overcome by the excess of his\nemotions, fell insensible to the ground, thus exposing the second\narrow to view. Gessler stood over him awaiting his recovery, which\nspeedily took place. Tell rose, and turned away from the governor,\nwho, however, thus addressed him: “Incomparable archer! I will keep my\npromise; but,” added he, “tell me what needed you with that second\narrow which you have, I see, secreted in your girdle? One was surely\nenough.” “The second shaft,” replied Tell, “was to pierce thy heart,\ntyrant, if I had chanced to harm my son!” At these words the terrified\ngovernor retired behind his guards, revoked his promise of pardon,\ncommanding him further to be placed in irons, and to be reconducted to\nthe fort. He was obeyed, and, as slight murmurs rose among the people,\ndouble patrols of Austrian soldiers paraded the streets, and forced\nthe citizens to retire to their houses. Walter, released, fled to join\nArnold, of Melchthal, according to a whispered order from his father.",
        "24. Gessler, reflecting on the aspect of the people, and fearful that\nsome plot was in progress, which his accidental shortness of\nprovisions rendered more unfortunate, determined to rid his citadel of\nthe object which might induce an attack. With this in view, he\nsummoned Berenger, and said to him: “I am about to leave Altorf, and\nyou shall command during my absence. I leave my brave soldiers, who\nwill readily obey your voice; and soon, returning with supplies and\nreinforcements, we will crush this vile people, and punish them for\ntheir insolent murmurings. Prepare me a large boat, in which thirty\nmen, picked from my guard, may depart with me. As soon as night comes\non, load this audacious Tell with chains, and send him on board. I\nwill myself take him where he can expiate his crimes!”",
        "25. The evening was fine and promising; the boat danced along the\nplacid waters. The air was pure, the waves tranquil, the stars shone\nbrightly in the sky. A light southern breeze aided the efforts of the\noarsmen, and tempered the rigor of the cold, which night in that\nseason rendered almost insupportable so near the glaciers. All\nappeared in Gessler’s favor. The extent of the first section of the\nlake was soon passed, and the boat headed for Brunnen. Tell, meantime,\nloaded with irons, gazed with eager eye on the desert rocks of Grütli,\nwhere the day before he had planned with his friends for the\ndeliverance of his country. While painful thoughts crossed his mind,\nhis looks were attracted by a dim light which burst forth near his own\nhouse. Presently this light increased, and before long a blaze arose\nvisible all over Uri. The heart of the prisoner beat with joy, for he\nfelt that all efforts were making to rescue him. Gessler observed the\nflame, which in reality was a signal-fire to arouse the cantons, but\nsupposed it some Swiss peasant’s house accidentally in flames.",
        "26. Suddenly, however, between Fluelen and Sissigen, when in deep\nwater, intermingled with shoals, the south wind ceased to blow, and\none of those storms which are common on the lake commenced. A north\nwind burst upon them, raised the waves to a great height, and dashed\nthem over the gunwale of the boat, which, giving way to the fury of\nthe storm, flew toward the shore that, rocky and precipitous, menaced\ntheir lives. The bleak wind brought also frost, snow, and sleet, which\nspread darkness over the waters, and covered the hands and faces of\nthe rowers with ice. The soldiers, inert and panic-stricken, prayed\nfor life, while Gessler, but ill prepared for death, was profuse in\nhis offers of money and other rewards if they would rouse themselves\nto save him.",
        "27. In this emergency the Austrian bailiff was reminded by one of his\nattendants that the prisoner Tell was no less skillful in the\nmanagement of a boat than in the exercise of the bow. “And, see, my\nlord,” said one of the men, representing to Gessler the imminent peril\nthey were all incurring, “all are paralyzed with terror, and even the\npilot is unable to manage the helm!”",
        "28. Gessler’s fear of Tell induced him at first to hesitate, but, the\nprayers of the soldiers becoming pressing, he told the prisoner that\nif he could take them safely through the storm he should be at once\nunbound. Tell having replied that, by the grace of God, he could still\nsave them, was instantly freed from his shackles and placed at the\nhelm, when the boat, answering to a master-hand, kept its course\nsteadily through the bellowing surge, as if conscious of the free\nspirit which had now taken the command.",
        "29. Guiding the obedient tiller at his will, Tell pointed the head of\nthe boat in the direction whence they came, which he knew to be the\nonly safe course; and, encouraging and cheering the rowers, made rapid\nand steady progress through the water. The darkness which now wrapped\nthem round prevented Gessler from discovering that he had turned his\nback on his destination. Tell continued on his way nearly the whole\nnight, the dying light of the signal-fire on the mountain serving as a\nbeacon in enabling him to approach the shores of Schwytz, and to avoid\nthe shoals.",
        "30. Between Sissigen and Fluelen are two mountains, the greater and\nthe lesser Achsenberg, whose sides, hemmed in and rising\nperpendicularly from the bed of the lake, offer not a single platform\nwhere human foot can stand. When near this place dawn broke in the\neastern sky, and Gessler–the danger appearing to decrease–scowled\nupon Tell in sullen silence. As the prow of the vessel was driven\ninland, Tell perceived a solitary table-rock, and called to the\nrowers to redouble their efforts till they should have passed the\nprecipice ahead, observing with ominous truth that it was the most\ndangerous point on the whole lake.",
        "31. The soldiers here recognized their position, and pointed it out to\nGessler, who demanded of Tell what he meant by taking them back to\nAltorf. William, without answering him, brought the bow suddenly close\nupon the rock, seized his bow, and, with an effort which sent the\nunguided craft back into the lake, sprang on shore, scaled the rocks,\nand took the direction of Schwytz.",
        "32. Having thus escaped the clutches of the governor, he made for the\nmain road between Art and Küssnacht, and there hid himself until such\na time as the bailiff should pass that way. Gessler and his attendants\nhaving, with great difficulty, effected a landing at Brunnen,\nproceeded toward Küssnacht. In the spot still known as “the hollow\nway,” and marked by a chapel, Tell overheard the threats pronounced\nagainst himself should he once more be caught, and, in default of his\napprehension, vengeance was vowed against his family. Tell felt that\nthe safety of himself and his wife and children, to say nothing of the\nduty he owed to his country, required the tyrant’s death; and, seizing\nan arrow, he pierced Gessler to the heart.",
        "33. The bold deed accomplished, the hero effected his escape to\nStemen, where he found Werner Stauffacher preparing to march.\nImmediate action was now necessary, but the original decision of the\nconspirators remained unchanged. Accordingly, on the morning of New\nYear’s Day, 1308, the castle of Rostberg, in Obwalden, was taken\npossession of, its keeper, Berenger, of Landasberg, made prisoner, and\ncompelled to promise that he would never again set foot within the\nterritory of the three cantons, after which he was allowed to retire\nto Lucerne.",
        "34. Stauffacher, the same morning, at the head of the men of Schwytz,\ndestroyed the fortress of Schwanan, while Tell and the men of Uri took\npossession of Altorf. On the following Sunday the deputies of Uri,\nSchwytz, and Unterwalden met, and renewed that fraternal league which\nhas endured to this day.",
        "35. In 1315 Leopold, second son of Albert, determined to punish the\nconfederate cantons for their revolt, and accordingly marched against\nthem at the head of a considerable army, accompanied by a numerous\nretinue of nobles. Count Otho, of Strasberg, one of his ablest\ngenerals, crossed the Brunig with a body of four thousand men,\nintending to attack Upper Unterwalden. The bailiffs of Willisan, of\nWodhausen, and of Lucerne meantime armed a fourth of that number to\nmake a descent on the lower division of the same canton, while the\nemperor in person, at the head of his army of reserve, poured down\nfrom Egerson on Mogarten, in the country of Schwytz, ostentatiously\ndisplaying an extensive supply of rope where with to hang the chiefs\nof the rebels.",
        "36. The confederates, in order to oppose this formidable invasion,\noccupied a position in the mountains bordering on the convent of Our\nLady of the Hermits. Four hundred men of Uri, and three hundred of\nUnterwalden, had effected a junction with the warriors of Schwytz, who\nformed the principal force of the little army. Fifty men, banished\nfrom this latter canton, offered themselves to combat beneath their\nbanner, intending to efface by their valor the remembrance of past\nfaults. Early on the morning of November 15, 1315, some thousands of\nwell-armed Austrian knights slowly ascended the hill on which the\nSwiss were posted, with the hope of dislodging them; the latter,\nhowever, advanced to meet their enemies, uttering the most terrific\ncries. The band of banished men, having precipitated large stones and\nfragments of rocks from the hillsides and from overhanging cliffs,\nrushed from behind the sheltering influence of a thick fog and threw\nthe advancing columns into confusion. The Austrians immediately broke\ntheir ranks, and presently a complete rout, with terrible slaughter,\nensued. The flower of the Austrian chivalry perished on the field of\nMorgarten, beneath the halberts, arrows, and iron-headed clubs of the\nshepherds. Leopold, himself, though he succeeded in gaining the\nshattered remnant of his forces, had a narrow escape, while the Swiss,\nanimated by victory, hastened to Unterwalden, where they defeated\nanother body of Austrians. In this instance Count Otho had as narrow\nan escape as the emperor.",
        "37. After these two well-fought fields, the confederates hastened to\nrenew their ancient alliance, which was solemnly sworn to in an\nassembly held at Brunnen on the eighth day of December.",
        "38. After the battle of Morgarten one canton after another threw off\nthe Austrian yoke, and joined the forest cantons, until nearly all\nSwitzerland was joined in a confederacy. A later war waged by Albert\nproved disastrous to the Austrian cause, and ended by a further\nconsolidation of the Swiss cantons. In 1356, seventy years after\nMorgarten, the Austrians made another attempt to bring the brave\nmountaineers into subjection. An army of nine thousand men, the best\ntrained soldiers of the empire, under the lead of the Archduke\nLeopold, invaded the country. To these the confederates opposed a\nforce of fourteen hundred. They met in a valley near the lake of\nSempach. The Austrians had learned something of Swiss warfare, and\nknew that they stood no chance in a hand-to-hand conflict with the\nSwiss, and so they formed their men into squares, with a wall of\nbristling spears on every side. Upon this solid mass of men the Swiss\ncould make no impression. In vain they charged with the fiery courage\nwhich had so often gained them the victory; they could find no\nvulnerable point in the serried columns, and it seemed that the brave\nmountaineers must all perish, and leave their homes again to the mercy\nof the Austrian soldiers. But, when almost in despair, the tide of\nbattle was turned by the acts of a single Swiss soldier, Arnold\nWinkelried, of Unterwalden. He communicated his plan to his immediate\nneighbors, and then, rushing forward, he grasped as many of the\nAustrian spears as he could reach; and, gathering them together, he\nbowed to the ground with the spears buried in his breast. Into the\nbreach his companions rushed, and with their powerful swords they soon\nwidened the space, so that the whole Swiss force had room for action.\nThe Austrians were almost annihilated, Leopold himself being slain.\nThe poet Montgomery has given the following version of this event:",
        "  39. “Make way for liberty!” he cried;\n  “Make way for liberty!” and died.\n\n  40. In arms the Austrian phalanx stood,\n  A living wall, a human wood!\n  A wall where every conscious stone\n  Seemed to its kindred thousands grown;\n  A rampart all assaults to bear,\n  Till time to dust their frames should wear!\n  A wood, like that enchanted grove\n  In which with fiends Rinaldo strove,\n  Where every silent tree possessed\n  A spirit prisoned in its breast,\n  Which the first stroke of coming strife\n  Would startle into hideous life;\n  So dense, so still, the Austrians stood,\n  A living wall, a human wood!\n  Impregnable their front appears,\n  All horrent with projected spears,\n  Whose polished points before them shine,\n  From flank to flank, one brilliant line,\n  Bright as the breakers’ splendors run\n  Along the billows, to the sun.\n\n  41. Opposed to these, a hovering band\n  Contended for their native land;\n  Peasants, whose new-found strength had broke\n  From manly necks the ignoble yoke,\n  And forged their fetters into swords,\n  On equal terms to fight their lords\n  And what insurgent rage had gained,\n  In many a mortal fray maintained!\n  Marshaled at morn at Freedom’s call,\n  They come to conquer or to fall,\n  Where he who conquered, he who fell,\n  Was deemed a dead, or living Tell!\n  Such virtue had that patriot breathed,\n  So to the soil his soul bequeathed,\n  That wheresoe’er his arrows flew,\n  Heroes in his own likeness grew,\n  And warriors sprang from every sod\n  Which his awakening footstep trod.\n\n  42. And now the work of life and death\n  Hung on the passing of a breath;\n  The fire of conflict burnt within,\n  The battle trembled to begin;\n  Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,\n  Point for attack was nowhere found.\n  Where’er the impatient Switzers gazed,\n  The unbroken line of lances blazed;\n  That line ’twere suicide to meet,\n  And perish at their tyrant’s feet\n  How could they rest within their graves,\n  And leave their homes the homes of slaves?\n  Would they not feel their children tread\n  With clanging chains above their head?\n\n  43. It must not! This day, this hour,\n  Annihilates the oppressor’s power;\n  All Switzerland is in the field,\n  She will not fly, she can not yield–\n  She must not fall; her better fate\n  Here gives her an immortal date.\n  Few were the numbers she could boast;\n  But every freeman was a host,\n  And felt as though himself were he\n  On whose sole arm hung victory!\n\n  44. It did depend on one, indeed,\n  Behold him–Arnold Winkelried\n  There sounds not to the tramp of fame\n  The echo of a nobler name.\n  Unmarked he stood amid the throng,\n  In rumination deep and long,\n  Till you might see, with sudden grace,\n  The very thought come o’er his face,\n  And by the motion of his form\n  Anticipate the coming storm;\n  And by the uplifting of his brow\n  Tell where the bolt would strike, and how.\n\n  45. But ’twas no sooner thought and done,\n  The field was in a moment won.\n\n  46. “Make way for Liberty!” he cried;\n  Then ran with arms extended wide\n  As if his dearest friend to clasp;\n  Ten spears he swept within his grasp.\n  “Make way for Liberty!” he cried:\n  Their keen points met from side to side;\n  He bowed among them like a tree,\n  And thus made way for Liberty!\n\n  47. Swift to the breach his comrades fly;\n  “Make way for Liberty!” they cry.\n  And through the Austrian phalanx dart,\n  As rushed the spears through Arnold’s heart!\n  While instantaneous as his fall,\n  Rout, ruin, panic, scattered all\n  An earthquake could not overthrow\n  A city with a surer blow.\n\n  48. Thus Switzerland again was free,\n  Thus death made way for Liberty!",
        "49. In the next fifty years the Swiss were engaged in a war with\nAustria and another with France, and in both cases they were\nvictorious. But, while they were exhausted by the incessant wars that\nhad been urged upon them, they were threatened with a more formidable\ninvasion than ever. Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, resolved to\nattach Switzerland to his domain. Crossing the Jura, the duke found\nhimself in possession of Yverdun, it having been betrayed into his\nhands; but the citadel still held out. Charles, irritated that his\nprogress should be stayed by such a handful of men, offered to let\nthem retire home if they would surrender, but if they still held out\nhe would hang them all! The Swiss, knowing prolonged defense was\nuseless, surrendered. As they marched out of the citadel they were\nseized, by order of the duke, and all murdered.",
        "50. Aroused by these horrors, an army of twenty thousand advanced to\nmeet the duke at the head of three times that number. In the battle\nthat ensued the Burgundians were entirely defeated, and Charles\nnarrowly escaped with his life. Writhing under his disgrace, and\nvowing revenge, the duke raised a much more numerous army, and again\ninvaded Switzerland.",
        "51. He advanced by the way of the lake of Neufchatel, and paused a few\ndays to capture the fortress on the banks of Lake Morat. While the\nsiege was going on the Swiss army concentrated, and marched to meet\ntheir foes. Thirty thousand men were to fight the battle of freedom\nagainst one hundred thousand. It was on Saturday, June 22, 1476. The\nweather was threatening, the sky overcast, and rain fell in torrents.\nA vanguard was formed, commanded by John Hallwyl, who knelt and\nbesought a blessing from on high. While they yet prayed the sun broke\nthrough the clouds, upon which the Swiss commander rose, sword in\nhand, crying: “Up, up, Heaven smiles on our victory!” The artillery\nthundered forth as he spoke, and the whole plain, from the lake to the\nrocky heights, became one vast battle-field! Toward the main body of\nthe Burgundians the Swiss army poured down with irresistible force and\ncourage; and, clearing all difficulties, they reached the line of the\nenemy. A fearful slaughter now ensued. The Burgundians were utterly\nvanquished. The haughty duke, pale and dispirited, fled with a few\nfollowers, and never stopped till he reached the banks of Lake Leman.\nThe rout was so complete that many of the Burgundians, in terror and\ndespair, threw themselves into the Lake of Morat, the banks of which\nwere strewed with the bodies of the slain.",
        "52. The battle of Morat lives in history with the victories of\nMarathon and Bannockburn. In each, freedom for the nation was secured,\nand liberty for man was preserved and transmitted. As a deed, the\nSwiss victory for ever freed a people from a grasping foreign tyrant;\nand it is a matter of rejoicing to all who love liberty till to-day,\nand, like other great events, it is the subject of national traditions.",
        "53. According to one of these, a young native of Friburg, who had been\nengaged in the battle, keenly desirous of being the first to carry\nhome tidings of the victory, ran the whole way–a distance of ten or\ntwelve miles–and with such overhaste that on his arrival at the\nmarket-place he dropped with fatigue, and, barely able to shout that\nthe Swiss were victorious, immediately expired. A twig of lime-tree,\nwhich he carried in his hand, was planted on the spot in commemoration\nof this event; and till the present day are seen, in the market-place\nof Friburg, the aged and propped-up remains of the venerable tree\nwhich grew from this twig. In most of the towns of Switzerland a “tree\nof Liberty” is preserved, which came from scions of the original tree\nat Friburg.",
