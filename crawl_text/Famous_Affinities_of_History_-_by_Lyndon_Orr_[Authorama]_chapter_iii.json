        "\nGermaine de Staël\nBy Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun\n\n",
        "Sixty or seventy years ago it was considered a great joke to chalk\nup on any man’s house-door, or on his trunk at a coaching-station,\nthe conspicuous letters “G. T. T.” The laugh went round, and every\none who saw the inscription chuckled and said: “They’ve got it on\nyou, old hoss!” The three letters meant “gone to Texas\"; and for\nany man to go to Texas in those days meant his moral, mental, and\nfinancial dilapidation. Either he had plunged into bankruptcy and\nwished to begin life over again in a new world, or the sheriff had\na warrant for his arrest.",
        "The very task of reaching Texas was a fearful one. Rivers that\noverran their banks, fever-stricken lowlands where gaunt faces\npeered out from moldering cabins, bottomless swamps where the mud\noozed greasily and where the alligator could be seen slowly moving\nhis repulsive form–all this stretched on for hundreds of miles to\nhorrify and sicken the emigrants who came toiling on foot or\nstruggling upon emaciated horses. Other daring pioneers came by\nboat, running all manner of risks upon the swollen rivers. Still\nothers descended from the mountains of Tennessee and passed\nthrough a more open country and with a greater certainty of self-\nprotection, because they were trained from childhood to wield the\nrifle and the long sheath-knife.",
        "It is odd enough to read, in the chronicles of those days, that\namid all this suffering and squalor there was drawn a strict line\nbetween “the quality” and those who had no claim to be patricians.\n\"The quality” was made up of such emigrants as came from the more\ncivilized East, or who had slaves, or who dragged with them some\nrickety vehicle with carriage-horses–however gaunt the animals\nmight be. All others–those who had no slaves or horses, and no\ntraditions of the older states–were classed as “poor whites\"; and\nthey accepted their mediocrity without a murmur.",
        "Because he was born in Lexington, Virginia, and moved thence with\nhis family to Tennessee, young Sam Houston–a truly eponymous\nAmerican hero–was numbered with “the quality” when, after long\nwandering, he reached his boyhood home. His further claim to\ndistinction as a boy came from the fact that he could read and\nwrite, and was even familiar with some of the classics in\ntranslation.",
        "When less than eighteen years of age he had reached a height of\nmore than six feet. He was skilful with the rifle, a remarkable\nrough-and-tumble fighter, and as quick with his long knife as any\nIndian. This made him a notable figure–the more so as he never\nabused his strength and courage. He was never known as anything\nbut “Sam.” In his own sphere he passed for a gentleman and a\nscholar, thanks to his Virginian birth and to the fact that he\ncould repeat a great part of Pope’s translation of the “Iliad.”",
        "His learning led him to teach school a few months in the year to\nthe children of the white settlers. Indeed, Houston was so much\ntaken with the pursuit of scholarship that he made up his mind to\nlearn Greek and Latin. Naturally, this seemed mere foolishness to\nhis mother, his six strapping brothers, and his three stalwart\nsisters, who cared little for study. So sharp was the difference\nbetween Sam and the rest of the family that he gave up his\nyearning after the classics and went to the other extreme by\nleaving home and plunging into the heart of the forest beyond\nsight of any white man or woman or any thought of Hellas and\nancient Rome.",
        "Here in the dimly lighted glades he was most happy. The Indians\nadmired him for his woodcraft and for the skill with which he\nchased the wild game amid the forests. From his copy of the\n\"Iliad” he would read to them the thoughts of the world’s greatest\npoet.",
        "It is told that nearly forty years after, when Houston had long\nled a different life and had made his home in Washington, a\ndeputation of more than forty untamed Indians from Texas arrived\nthere under the charge of several army officers. They chanced to\nmeet Sam Houston.",
        "One and all ran to him, clasped him in their brawny arms, hugged\nhim like bears to their naked breasts, and called him “father.\"\nBeneath the copper skin and thick paint the blood rushed, and\ntheir faces changed, and the lips of many a warrior trembled,\nalthough the Indian may not weep.",
        "In the gigantic form of Houston, on whose ample brow the\nbeneficent love of a father was struggling with the sternness of\nthe patriarch and warrior, we saw civilization awing the savage at\nhis feet. We needed no interpreter to tell us that this impressive\nsupremacy was gained in the forest.",
        "His family had been at first alarmed by his stay among the\nIndians; but when after a time he returned for a new outfit they\nsaw that he was entirely safe and left him to wander among the red\nmen. Later he came forth and resumed the pursuits of civilization.\nHe took up his studies; he learned the rudiments of law and\nentered upon its active practice. When barely thirty-six he had\nwon every office that was open to him, ending with his election to\nthe Governorship of Tennessee in 1827.",
        "Then came a strange episode which changed the whole course of his\nlife. Until then the love of woman had never stirred his veins.\nHis physical activities in the forests, his unique intimacy with\nIndian life, had kept him away from the social intercourse of\ntowns and cities. In Nashville Houston came to know for the first\ntime the fascination of feminine society. As a lawyer, a\npolitician, and the holder of important offices he could not keep\naloof from that gentler and more winning influence which had\nhitherto been unknown to him.",
        "In 1828 Governor Houston was obliged to visit different portions\nof the state, stopping, as was the custom, to visit at the homes\nof “the quality,” and to be introduced to wives and daughters as\nwell as to their sportsman sons. On one of his official journeys\nhe met Miss Eliza Allen, a daughter of one of the “influential\nfamilies” of Sumner County, on the northern border of Tennessee.\nHe found her responsive, charming, and greatly to be admired. She\nwas a slender type of Southern beauty, well calculated to gain the\naffection of a lover, and especially of one whose associations had\nbeen chiefly with the women of frontier communities.",
        "To meet a girl who had refined tastes and wide reading, and who\nwas at the same time graceful and full of humor, must have come as\na pleasant experience to Houston. He and Miss Allen saw much of\neach other, and few of their friends were surprised when the word\nwent forth that they were engaged to be married.",
        "The marriage occurred in January, 1829. They were surrounded with\nfriends of all classes and ranks, for Houston was the associate of\nJackson and was immensely popular in his own state. He seemed to\nhave before him a brilliant career. He had won a lovely bride to\nmake a home for him; so that no man seemed to have more attractive\nprospects. What was there which at this time interposed in some\nmalignant way to blight his future?",
        "It was a little more than a month after his marriage when he met a\nfriend, and, taking him out into a strip of quiet woodland, said\nto him:",
        "“I have something to tell you, but you must not ask me anything\nabout it. My wife and I will separate before long. She will return\nto her father’s, while I must make my way alone.”",
        "Houston’s friend seized him by the arm and gazed at him with\nhorror.",
        "“Governor,” said he, “you’re going to ruin your whole life! What\nreason have you for treating this young lady in such a way? What\nhas she done that you should leave her? Or what have you done that\nshe should leave you? Every one will fall away from you.”",
        "Houston grimly replied:",
        "“I have no explanation to give you. My wife has none to give you.\nShe will not complain of me, nor shall I complain of her. It is no\none’s business in the world except our own. Any interference will\nbe impertinent, and I shall punish it with my own hand.”",
        "“But,” said his friend, “think of it. The people at large will not\nallow such action. They will believe that you, who have been their\nidol, have descended to insult a woman. Your political career is\nended. It will not be safe for you to walk the streets!”",
        "“What difference does it make to me?” said Houston, gloomily.\n\"What must be, must be. I tell you, as a friend, in advance, so\nthat you may be prepared; but the parting will take place very\nsoon.”",
        "Little was heard for another month or two, and then came the\nannouncement that the Governor’s wife had left him and had\nreturned to her parents’ home. The news flew like wildfire, and\nwas the theme of every tongue. Friends of Mrs. Houston begged her\nto tell them the meaning of the whole affair. Adherents of\nHouston, on the other hand, set afloat stories of his wife’s\ncoldness and of her peevishness. The state was divided into\nfactions; and what really concerned a very few was, as usual, made\neverybody’s business.",
        "There were times when, if Houston had appeared near the dwelling\nof his former wife, he would have been lynched or riddled with\nbullets. Again, there were enemies and slanderers of his who, had\nthey shown themselves in Nashville, would have been torn to pieces\nby men who hailed Houston as a hero and who believed that he could\nnot possibly have done wrong.",
        "However his friends might rage, and however her people might\nwonder and seek to pry into the secret, no satisfaction was given\non either side. The abandoned wife never uttered a word of\nexplanation. Houston was equally reticent and self-controlled. In\nlater years he sometimes drank deeply and was loose-tongued; but\nnever, even in his cups, could he be persuaded to say a single\nword about his wife.",
        "The whole thing is a mystery and cannot be solved by any evidence\nthat we have. Almost every one who has written of it seems to have\nindulged in mere guesswork. One popular theory is that Miss Allen\nwas in love with some one else; that her parents forced her into a\nbrilliant marriage with Houston, which, however, she could not\nafterward endure; and that Houston, learning the facts, left her\nbecause he knew that her heart was not really his.",
        "But the evidence is all against this. Had it been so she would\nsurely have secured a divorce and would then have married the man\nwhom she truly loved. As a matter of fact, although she did\ndivorce Houston, it was only after several years, and the man whom\nshe subsequently married was not acquainted with her at the time\nof the separation.",
        "Another theory suggests that Houston was harsh in his treatment of\nhis wife, and offended her by his untaught manners and extreme\nself-conceit. But it is not likely that she objected to his\nmanners, since she had become familiar with them before she gave\nhim her hand; and as to his conceit, there is no evidence that it\nwas as yet unduly developed. After his Texan campaign he sometimes\nshowed a rather lofty idea of his own achievements; but he does\nnot seem to have done so in these early days.",
        "Some have ascribed the separation to his passion for drink; but\nhere again we must discriminate. Later in life he became very fond\nof spirits and drank whisky with the Indians, but during his\nearlier years he was most abstemious. It scarcely seems possible\nthat his wife left him because he was intemperate.",
        "If one wishes to construct a reasonable hypothesis on a subject\nwhere the facts are either wanting or conflicting, it is not\nimpossible to suggest a solution of this puzzle about Houston.\nAlthough his abandoned wife never spoke of him and shut her lips\ntightly when she was questioned about him, Houston, on his part,\nwas not so taciturn. He never consciously gave any direct clue to\nhis matrimonial mystery; but he never forgot this girl who was his\nbride and whom he seems always to have loved. In what he said he\nnever ceased to let a vein of self-reproach run through his words.",
        "I should choose this one paragraph as the most significant. It was\nwritten immediately after they had parted:",
        "Eliza stands acquitted by me. I have received her as a virtuous,\nchaste wife, and as such I pray God I may ever regard her, and I\ntrust I ever shall. She was cold to me, and I thought she did not\nlove me.",
        "And again he said to an old and valued friend at about the same\ntime:",
        "“I can make no explanation. I exonerate the lady fully and do not\njustify myself.”",
        "Miss Allen seems to have been a woman of the sensitive American\ntype which was so common in the early and the middle part of the\nlast century. Mrs. Trollope has described it for us with very\nlittle exaggeration. Dickens has drawn it with a touch of malice,\nand yet not without truth. Miss Martineau described it during her\nvisit to this country, and her account quite coincides with those\nof her two contemporaries.",
        "Indeed, American women of that time unconsciously described\nthemselves in a thousand different ways. They were, after all,\nonly a less striking type of the sentimental Englishwomen who read\nL. E. L. and the earlier novels of Bulwer-Lytton. On both sides of\nthe Atlantic there was a reign of sentiment and a prevalence of\nwhat was then called “delicacy.” It was a die-away, unwholesome\nattitude toward life and was morbid to the last degree.",
        "In circles where these ideas prevailed, to eat a hearty dinner was\nconsidered unwomanly. To talk of anything except some gilded\n\"annual,” or “book of beauty,” or the gossip of the neighborhood\nwas wholly to be condemned. The typical girl of such a community\nwas thin and slender and given to a mild starvation, though she\nmight eat quantities of jam and pickles and saleratus biscuit. She\nhad the strangest views of life and an almost unnatural shrinking\nfrom any usual converse with men.",
        "Houston, on his side, was a thoroughly natural and healthful man,\nhaving lived an outdoor life, hunting and camping in the forest\nand displaying the unaffected manner of the pioneer. Having lived\nthe solitary life of the woods, it was a strange thing for him to\nmeet a girl who had been bred in an entirely different way, who\nhad learned a thousand little reservations and dainty graces, and\nwhose very breath was coyness and reserve. Their mating was the\nmating of the man of the forest with the woman of the sheltered\nlife.",
        "Houston assumed everything; his bride shrank from everything.\nThere was a mutual shock amounting almost to repulsion. She, on\nher side, probably thought she had found in him only the brute\nwhich lurks in man. He, on the other, repelled and checked, at\nonce grasped the belief that his wife cared nothing for him\nbecause she would not meet his ardors with like ardors of her own.\nIt is the mistake that has been made by thousands of men and women\nat the beginning of their married lives–the mistake on one side\nof too great sensitiveness, and on the other side of too great\nwarmth of passion.",
        "This episode may seem trivial, and yet it is one that explains\nmany things in human life. So far as concerns Houston it has a\ndirect bearing on the history of our country. A proud man, he\ncould not endure the slights and gossip of his associates. He\nresigned the governorship of Tennessee, and left by night, in such\na way as to surround his departure with mystery.",
        "There had come over him the old longing for Indian life; and when\nhe was next visible he was in the land of the Cherokees, who had\nlong before adopted him as a son. He was clad in buckskin and\narmed with knife and rifle, and served under the old chief\nOolooteka. He was a gallant defender of the Indians.",
        "When he found how some of the Indian agents had abused his adopted\nbrothers he went to Washington to protest, still wearing his\nfrontier garb. One William Stansberry, a Congressman from Ohio,\ninsulted Houston, who leaped upon him like a panther, dragged him\nabout the Hall of Representatives, and beat him within an inch of\nhis life. He was arrested, imprisoned, and fined; but his old\nfriend, President Jackson, remitted his imprisonment and gruffly\nadvised him not to pay the fine.",
        "Returning to his Indians, he made his way to a new field which\npromised much adventure. This was Texas, of whose condition in\nthose early days something has already been said. Houston found a\nrough American settlement, composed of scattered villages\nextending along the disputed frontier of Mexico. Already, in the\ntrue Anglo-Saxon spirit, the settlers had formed a rudimentary\nstate, and as they increased and multiplied they framed a simple\ncode of laws.",
        "Then, quite naturally, there came a clash between them and the\nMexicans. The Texans, headed by Moses Austin, had set up a\nrepublic and asked for admission to the United States. Mexico\nregarded them as rebels and despised them because they made no\nmilitary display and had no very accurate military drill. They\nwere dressed in buckskin and ragged clothing; but their knives\nwere very bright and their rifles carried surely. Furthermore,\nthey laughed at odds, and if only a dozen of them were gathered\ntogether they would “take on” almost any number of Mexican\nregulars.",
        "In February, 1836, the acute and able Mexican, Santa Anna, led\nacross the Rio Grande a force of several thousand Mexicans showily\nuniformed and completely armed. Every one remembers how they fell\nupon the little garrison at the Alamo, now within the city limits\nof San Antonio, but then an isolated mission building surrounded\nby a thick adobe wall. The Americans numbered less than three\nhundred men.",
        "A sharp attack was made with these overwhelming odds. The\nAmericans drove the assailants back with their rifle fire, but\nthey had nothing to oppose to the Mexican artillery. The contest\ncontinued for several days, and finally the Mexicans breached the\nwall and fell upon the garrison, who were now reduced by more than\nhalf. There was an hour of blood, and every one of the Alamo’s\ndefenders, including the wounded, was put to death. The only\nsurvivors of the slaughter were two negro slaves, a woman, and a\nbaby girl.",
        "When the news of this bloody affair reached Houston he leaped\nforth to the combat like a lion. He was made commander-in-chief of\nthe scanty Texan forces. He managed to rally about seven hundred\nmen, and set out against Santa Anna with little in the way of\nequipment, and with nothing but the flame of frenzy to stimulate\nhis followers. By march and countermarch the hostile forces came\nface to face near the shore of San Jacinto Bay, not far from the\npresent city of Houston. Slowly they moved upon each other, when\nHouston halted, and his sharpshooters raked the Mexican battle-\nline with terrible effect. Then Houston uttered the cry:",
        "“Remember the Alamo!”",
        "With deadly swiftness he led his men in a charge upon Santa Anna’s\nlines. The Mexicans were scattered as by a mighty wind, their\ncommander was taken prisoner, and Mexico was forced to give its\nrecognition to Texas as a free republic, of which General Houston\nbecame the first president.",
        "This was the climax of Houston’s life, but the end of it leaves us\nwith something still to say. Long after his marriage with Miss\nAllen he took an Indian girl to wife and lived with her quite\nhappily. She was a very beautiful woman, a half-breed, with the\nEnglish name of Tyania Rodgers. Very little, however, is known of\nher life with Houston. Later still–in 1840–he married a lady\nfrom Marion, Alabama, named Margaret Moffette Lea. He was then in\nhis forty-seventh year, while she was only twenty-one; but again,\nas with his Indian wife, he knew nothing but domestic\ntranquillity. These later experiences go far to prove the truth of\nwhat has already been given as the probable cause of his first\nmysterious failure to make a woman happy.",
        "After Texas entered the Union, in 1845, Houston was elected to the\nUnited States Senate, in which he served for thirteen years. In\n1852, 1856, and 1860, as a Southerner who opposed any movement\nlooking toward secession, he was regarded as a possible\npresidential candidate; but his career was now almost over, and in\n1863, while the Civil War–which he had striven to prevent–was at\nits height, he died.",
        "Lola Montez! The name suggests dark eyes and abundant hair, lithe\nlimbs and a sinuous body, with twining hands and great eyes that\ngleam with a sort of ebon splendor. One thinks of Spanish beauty\nas one hears the name; and in truth Lola Montez justified the\nmental picture.",
        "She was not altogether Spanish, yet the other elements that\nentered into her mercurial nature heightened and vivified her\nCastilian traits. Her mother was a Spaniard–partly Moorish,\nhowever. Her father was an Irishman. There you have it–the dreamy\nromance of Spain, the exotic touch of the Orient, and the daring,\nunreasoning vivacity of the Celt.",
        "This woman during the forty-three years of her life had adventures\ninnumerable, was widely known in Europe and America, and actually\nlost one king his throne. Her maiden name was Marie Dolores Eliza\nRosanna Gilbert. Her father was a British officer, the son of an\nIrish knight, Sir Edward Gilbert. Her mother had been a danseuse\nnamed Lola Oliver. “Lola” is a diminutive of Dolores, and as\n\"Lola” she became known to the world.",
        "She lived at one time or another in nearly all the countries of\nEurope, and likewise in India, America, and Australia. It would be\nimpossible to set down here all the sensations that she achieved.\nLet us select the climax of her career and show how she overturned\na kingdom, passing but lightly over her early and her later years.",
        "She was born in Limerick in 1818, but her father’s parents cast\noff their son and his young wife, the Spanish dancer. They went to\nIndia, and in 1825 the father died, leaving his young widow\nwithout a rupee; but she was quickly married again, this time to\nan officer of importance.",
        "The former danseuse became a very conventional person, a fit match\nfor her highly conventional husband; but the small daughter did\nnot take kindly to the proprieties of life. The Hindu servants\ntaught her more things than she should have known; and at one time\nher stepfather found her performing the danse du ventre. It was\nthe Moorish strain inherited from her mother.",
        "She was sent back to Europe, however, and had a sort of education\nin Scotland and England, and finally in Paris, where she was\ndetected in an incipient flirtation with her music-master. There\nwere other persons hanging about her from her fifteenth year, at\nwhich time her stepfather, in India, had arranged a marriage\nbetween her and a rich but uninteresting old judge. One of her\nnumerous admirers told her this.",
        "“What on earth am I to do?” asked little Lola, most naively.",
        "“Why, marry me,” said the artful adviser, who was Captain Thomas\nJames; and so the very next day they fled to Dublin and were\nspeedily married at Meath.",
        "Lola’s husband was violently in love with her, but, unfortunately,\nothers were no less susceptible to her charms. She was presented\nat the vice-regal court, and everybody there became her victim.\nEven the viceroy, Lord Normanby, was greatly taken with her. This\nnobleman’s position was such that Captain James could not object\nto his attentions, though they made the husband angry to a degree.\nThe viceroy would draw her into alcoves and engage her in\nflattering conversation, while poor James could only gnaw his\nnails and let green-eyed jealousy prey upon his heart. His only\nrecourse was to take her into the country, where she speedily\nbecame bored; and boredom is the death of love.",
        "Later she went with Captain James to India. She endured a campaign\nin Afghanistan, in which she thoroughly enjoyed herself because of\nthe attentions of the officers. On her return to London in 1842,\none Captain Lennox was a fellow passenger; and their association\nresulted in an action for divorce, by which she was freed from her\nhusband, and yet by a technicality was not able to marry Lennox,\nwhose family in any case would probably have prevented the\nwedding.",
        "Mrs. Mayne says, in writing on this point:",
        "Even Lola never quite succeeded in being allowed to commit bigamy\nunmolested, though in later years she did commit it and took\nrefuge in Spain to escape punishment.",
        "The same writer has given a vivid picture of what happened soon\nafter the divorce. Lola tried to forget her past and to create a\nnew and brighter future. Here is the narrative:",
        "Her Majesty’s Theater was crowded on the night of June 10,1843. A\nnew Spanish dancer was announced–\"Dona Lola Montez.” It was her\ndebut, and Lumley, the manager, had been puffing her beforehand,\nas he alone knew how. To Lord Ranelagh, the leader of the\ndilettante group of fashionable young men, he had whispered,\nmysteriously:",
        "“I have a surprise in store. You shall see.”",
        "So Ranelagh and a party of his friends filled the omnibus boxes,\nthose tribunes at the side of the stage whence success or failure\nwas pronounced. Things had been done with Lumley’s consummate art;\nthe packed house was murmurous with excitement. She was a raving\nbeauty, said report–and then, those intoxicating Spanish dances!\nTaglioni, Cerito, Fanny Elssler, all were to be eclipsed.",
        "Ranelagh’s glasses were steadily leveled on the stage from the\nmoment her entrance was imminent. She came on. There was a murmur\nof admiration–but Ranelagh made no sign. And then she began to\ndance. A sense of disappointment, perhaps? But she was very\nlovely, very graceful, “like a flower swept by the wind, she\nfloated round the stage\"–not a dancer, but, by George, a beauty!\nAnd still Ranelagh made no sign.",
        "Yet, no. What low, sibilant sound is that? And then what confused,\nangry words from the tribunal? He turns to his friends, his eyes\nablaze with anger, opera-glass in hand. And now again the terrible\n\"Hiss-s-s!” taken up by the other box, and the words repeated\nloudly and more angrily even than before–the historic words which\nsealed Lola’s doom at Her Majesty’s Theater: “WHY, IT’S BETTY\nJAMES!”",
        "She was, indeed, Betty James, and London would not accept her as\nLola Montez. She left England and appeared upon the Continent as a\nbeautiful virago, making a sensation–as the French would say, a\nsucces de scandale–by boxing the ears of people who offended her,\nand even on one occasion horsewhipping a policeman who was in\nattendance on the King of Prussia. In Paris she tried once more to\nbe a dancer, but Paris would not have her. She betook herself to\nDresden and Warsaw, where she sought to attract attention by her\neccentricities, making mouths at the spectators, flinging her\ngarters in their faces, and one time removing her skirts and still\nmore necessary garments, whereupon her manager broke off his\nengagement with her.",
        "An English writer who heard a great deal of her and who saw her\noften about this time writes that there was nothing wonderful\nabout her except “her beauty and her impudence.” She had no talent\nnor any of the graces which make women attractive; yet many men of\ntalent raved about her. The clever young journalist, Dujarrier,\nwho assisted Emile Girardin, was her lover in Paris. He was killed\nin a duel and left Lola twenty thousand francs and some\nsecurities, so that she no longer had to sing in the streets as\nshe did in Warsaw.",
        "She now betook herself to Munich, the capital of Bavaria. That\ncountry was then governed by Ludwig I., a king as eccentric as\nLola herself. He was a curious compound of kindliness, ideality,\nand peculiar ways. For instance, he would never use a carriage\neven on state occasions. He prowled around the streets, knocking\noff the hats of those whom he chanced to meet. Like his\nunfortunate descendant, Ludwig II., he wrote poetry, and he had a\npicture-gallery devoted to portraits of the beautiful women whom\nhe had met.",
        "He dressed like an English fox-hunter, with a most extraordinary\nhat, and what was odd and peculiar in others pleased him because\nhe was odd and peculiar himself. Therefore when Lola made her\nfirst appearance at the Court Theater he was enchanted with her.\nHe summoned her at once to the palace, and within five days he\npresented her to the court, saying as he did so:",
        "“Meine Herren, I present you to my best friend.”",
        "In less than a month this curious monarch had given Lola the title\nof Countess of Landsfeld. A handsome house was built for her, and\na pension of twenty thousand florins was granted her. This was in\n1847. With the people of Munich she was unpopular. They did not\nmind the eccentricities of the king, since these amused them and\ndid the country no perceptible harm; but they were enraged by this\nbeautiful woman, who had no softness such as a woman ought to\nhave. Her swearing, her readiness to box the ears of every one\nwhom she disliked, the huge bulldog which accompanied her\neverywhere–all these things were beyond endurance.",
        "She was discourteous to the queen, besides meddling with the\npolitics of the kingdom. Either of these things would have been\nsufficient to make her hated. Together, they were more than the\ncity of Munich could endure. Finally the countess tried to\nestablish a new corps in the university. This was the last touch\nof all. A student who ventured to wear her colors was beaten and\narrested. Lola came to his aid with all her wonted boldness; but\nthe city was in commotion.",
        "Daggers were drawn; Lola was hustled and insulted. The foolish\nking rushed out to protect her; and on his arm she was led in\nsafety to the palace. As she entered the gates she turned and\nfired a pistol into the mob. No one was hurt, but a great rage\ntook possession of the people. The king issued a decree closing\nthe university for a year. By this time, however, Munich was in\npossession of a mob, and the Bavarians demanded that she should\nleave the country.",
        "Ludwig faced the chamber of peers, where the demand of the\npopulace was placed before him.",
        "“I would rather lose my crown!” he replied.",
        "The lords of Bavaria regarded him with grim silence; and in their\neyes he read the determination of his people. On the following day\na royal decree revoked Lola’s rights as a subject of Bavaria, and\nstill another decree ordered her to be expelled. The mob yelled\nwith joy and burned her house. Poor Ludwig watched the tumult by\nthe light of the leaping flames.",
        "He was still in love with her and tried to keep her in the\nkingdom; but the result was that Ludwig himself was forced to\nabdicate. He had given his throne for the light love of this\nbeautiful but half-crazy woman. She would have no more to do with\nhim; and as for him, he had to give place to his son Maximilian.\nLudwig had lost a kingdom merely because this strange, outrageous\ncreature had piqued him and made him think that she was unique\namong women.",
        "The rest of her career was adventurous. In England she contracted\na bigamous marriage with a youthful officer, and within two weeks\nthey fled to Spain for safety from the law. Her husband was\ndrowned, and she made still another marriage. She visited\nAustralia, and at Melbourne she had a fight with a strapping\nwoman, who clawed her face until Lola fell fainting to the ground.\nIt is a squalid record of horse-whippings, face-scratchings–in\nshort, a rowdy life.",
        "Her end was like that of Becky Sharp. In America she delivered\nlectures which were written for her by a clergyman and which dealt\nwith the art of beauty. She had a temporary success; but soon she\nbecame quite poor, and took to piety, professing to be a sort of\npiteous, penitent Magdalen. In this role she made effective use of\nher beautiful dark hair, her pallor, and her wonderful eyes. But\nthe violence of her disposition had wrecked her physically; and\nshe died of paralysis in Astoria, on Long Island, in 1861. Upon\nher grave in Greenwood Cemetery, Brooklyn, there is a tablet to\nher memory, bearing the inscription: “Mrs. Eliza Gilbert, born\n1818, died 1861.”",
        "What can one say of a woman such as this? She had no morals, and\nher manners were outrageous. The love she felt was the love of a\nshe-wolf. Fourteen biographies of her have been written, besides\nher own autobiography, which was called The Story of a Penitent,\nand which tells less about her than any of the other books. Her\nbeauty was undeniable. Her courage was the blended courage of the\nCelt, the Spaniard, and the Moor. Yet all that one can say of her\nwas said by the elder Dumas when he declared that she was born to\nbe the evil genius of every one who cared for her. Her greatest\nfame comes from the fact that in less than three years she\noverturned a kingdom and lost a king his throne.",
        "The present French Republic has endured for over forty years.\nWithin that time it has produced just one man of extraordinary\npower and parts. This was Leon Gambetta. Other men as remarkable\nas he were conspicuous in French political life during the first\nfew years of the republic; but they belonged to an earlier\ngeneration, while Gambetta leaped into prominence only when the\nempire fell, crashing down in ruin and disaster.",
        "It is still too early to form an accurate estimate of him as a\nstatesman. His friends praise him extravagantly. His enemies still\nrevile him bitterly. The period of his political career lasted for\nlittle more than a decade, yet in that time it may be said that he\nlived almost a life of fifty years. Only a short time ago did the\nFrench government cause his body to be placed within the great\nPantheon, which contains memorials of the heroes and heroines of\nFrance. But, though we may not fairly judge of his political\nmotives, we can readily reconstruct a picture of him as a man, and\nin doing so recall his one romance, which many will remember after\nthey have forgotten his oratorical triumphs and his statecraft.",
        "Leon Gambetta was the true type of the southern Frenchman–what\nhis countrymen call a meridional. The Frenchman of the south is\ndifferent from the Frenchman of the north, for the latter has in\nhis veins a touch of the viking blood, so that he is very apt to\nbe fair-haired and blue-eyed, temperate in speech, and self-\ncontrolled. He is different, again, from the Frenchman of central\nFrance, who is almost purely Celtic. The meridional has a marked\nvein of the Italian in him, derived from the conquerors of ancient\nGaul. He is impulsive, ardent, fiery in speech, hot-tempered, and\nvivacious to an extraordinary degree.",
        "Gambetta, who was born at Cahors, was French only on his mother’s\nside, since his father was of Italian birth. It is said also that\nsomewhere in his ancestry there was a touch of the Oriental. At\nany rate, he was one of the most southern of the sons of southern\nFrance, and he showed the precocious maturity which belongs to a\ncertain type of Italian. At twenty-one he had already been\nadmitted to the French bar, and had drifted to Paris, where his\naudacity, his pushing nature, and his red-hot un-restraint of\nspeech gave him a certain notoriety from the very first.",
        "It was toward the end of the reign of Napoleon III. that Gambetta\nsaw his opportunity. The emperor, weakened by disease and yielding\nto a sort of feeble idealism, gave to France a greater freedom of\nspeech than it had enjoyed while he was more virile. This\nrelaxation of control merely gave to his opponents more courage to\nattack him and his empire. Demagogues harangued the crowds in\nwords which would once have led to their imprisonment. In the\nNational Assembly the opposition did all within its power to\nhamper and defeat the policy of the government.",
        "In short, republicanism began to rise in an ominous and\nthreatening way; and at the head of republicanism in Paris stood\nforth Gambetta, with his impassioned eloquence, his stinging\nphrases, and his youthful boldness. He became the idol of that\npart of Paris known as Belleville, where artisans and laborers\nunited with the rabble of the streets in hating the empire and in\ncrying out for a republic.",
        "Gambetta was precisely the man to voice the feelings of these\npeople. Whatever polish he acquired in after years was then quite\nlacking; and the crudity of his manners actually helped him with\nthe men whom he harangued. A recent book by M. Francis Laur, an\nardent admirer of Gambetta, gives a picture of the man which may\nbe nearly true of him in his later life, but which is certainly\ntoo flattering when applied to Gambetta in 1868, at the age of\nthirty.",
        "How do we see Gambetta as he was at thirty? A man of powerful\nframe and of intense vitality, with thick, clustering hair, which\nhe shook as a lion shakes its mane; olive-skinned, with eyes that\ndarted fire, a resonant, sonorous voice, and a personal magnetism\nwhich was instantly felt by all who met him or who heard him\nspeak. His manners were not refined. He was fond of oil and\ngarlic. His gestures were often more frantic than impressive, so\nthat his enemies called him “the furious fool.” He had a trick of\nspitting while he spoke. He was by no means the sort of man whose\nhabits had been formed in drawing-rooms or among people of good\nbreeding. Yet his oratory was, of its kind, superb.",
        "In 1869 Gambetta was elected by the Red Republicans to the Corps\nLegislatif. From the very first his vehemence and fire gained him\na ready hearing. The chamber itself was arranged like a great\ntheater, the members occupying the floor and the public the\ngalleries. Each orator in addressing the house mounted a sort of\nrostrum and from it faced the whole assemblage, not noticing, as\nwith us, the presiding officer at all. The very nature of this\narrangement stimulated parliamentary speaking into eloquence and\nflamboyant oratory.",
        "After Gambetta had spoken a few times he noticed in the gallery a\ntall, graceful woman, dressed in some neutral color and wearing\nlong black gloves, which accentuated the beauty of her hands and\narms. No one in the whole assembly paid such close attention to\nthe orator as did this woman, whom he had never seen before and\nwho appeared to be entirely alone.",
        "When it came to him to speak on another day he saw sitting in the\nsame place the same stately and yet lithe and sinuous figure. This\nwas repeated again and again, until at last whenever he came to a\npeculiarly fervid burst of oratory he turned to this woman’s face\nand saw it lighted up by the same enthusiasm which was stirring\nhim.",
        "Finally, in the early part of 1870, there came a day when Gambetta\nsurpassed himself in eloquence. His theme was the grandeur of\nrepublican government. Never in his life had he spoken so boldly\nas then, or with such fervor. The ministers of the emperor shrank\nback in dismay as this big-voiced, strong-limbed man hurled forth\nsentence after sentence like successive peals of irresistible\nartillery.",
        "As Gambetta rolled forth his sentences, superb in their rhetoric\nand all ablaze with that sort of intense feeling which masters an\norator in the moment of his triumph, the face of the lady in the\ngallery responded to him with wonderful appreciation. She was no\nlonger calm, unmoved, and almost severe. She flushed, and her eyes\nas they met his seemed to sparkle with living fire. When he\nfinished and descended from the rostrum he looked at her, and\ntheir eyes cried out as significantly as if the two had spoken to\neach other.",
        "Then Gambetta did what a person of finer breeding would not have\ndone. He hastily scribbled a note, sealed it, and called to his\nside one of the official pages. In the presence of the great\nassemblage, where he was for the moment the center of attention,\nhe pointed to the lady in the gallery and ordered the page to take\nthe note to her.",
        "One may excuse this only on the ground that he was completely\ncarried away by his emotion, so that to him there was no one\npresent save this enigmatically fascinating woman and himself. But\nthe lady on her side was wiser; or perhaps a slight delay gave her\ntime to recover her discretion. When Gambetta’s note was brought\nto her she took it quietly and tore it into little pieces without\nreading it; and then, rising, she glided through the crowd and\ndisappeared.",
        "Gambetta in his excitement had acted as if she were a mere\nadventuress. With perfect dignity she had shown him that she was a\nwoman who retained her self-respect.",
        "Immediately upon the heels of this curious incident came the\noutbreak of the war with Germany. In the war the empire was\nshattered at Sedan. The republic was proclaimed in Paris. The\nFrench capital was besieged by a vast German army. Gambetta was\nmade minister of the interior, and remained for a while in Paris\neven after it had been blockaded. But his fiery spirit chafed\nunder such conditions. He longed to go forth into the south of\nFrance and arouse his countrymen with a cry to arms against the\ninvaders.",
        "Escaping in a balloon, he safely reached the city of Tours; and\nthere he established what was practically a dictatorship. He flung\nhimself with tremendous energy into the task of organizing armies,\nof equipping them, and of directing their movements for the relief\nof Paris. He did, in fact, accomplish wonders. He kept the spirit\nof the nation still alive. Three new armies were launched against\nthe Germans. Gambetta was everywhere and took part in everything\nthat was done. His inexperience in military affairs, coupled with\nhis impatience of advice, led him to make serious mistakes.\nNevertheless, one of his armies practically defeated the Germans\nat Orleans; and could he have had his own way, even the fall of\nParis would not have ended the war.",
        "“Never,” said Gambetta, “shall I consent to peace so long as\nFrance still has two hundred thousand men under arms and more than\na thousand cannon to direct against the enemy!”",
        "But he was overruled by other and less fiery statesmen. Peace was\nmade, and Gambetta retired for a moment into private life. If he\nhad not succeeded in expelling the German hosts he had, at any\nrate, made Bismarck hate him, and he had saved the honor of\nFrance.",
        "It was while the National Assembly at Versailles was debating the\nterms of peace with Germany that Gambetta once more delivered a\nnoble and patriotic speech. As he concluded he felt a strange\nmagnetic attraction; and, sweeping the audience with a glance, he\nsaw before him, not very far away, the same woman with the long\nblack gloves, having about her still an air of mystery, but again\nmeeting his eyes with her own, suffused with feeling.",
        "Gambetta hurried to an anteroom and hastily scribbled the\nfollowing note:",
        "At last I see you once more. Is it really you?",
        "The scrawl was taken to her by a discreet official, and this time\nshe received the letter, pressed it to her heart, and then slipped\nit into the bodice of her gown. But this time, as before, she left\nwithout making a reply.",
        "It was an encouragement, yet it gave no opening to Gambetta–for\nshe returned to the National Assembly no more. But now his heart\nwas full of hope, for he was convinced with a very deep conviction\nthat somewhere, soon, and in some way he would meet this woman,\nwho had become to him one of the intense realities of his life. He\ndid not know her name. They had never exchanged a word. Yet he was\nsure that time would bring them close together.",
        "His intuition was unerring. What we call chance often seems to\nknow what it is doing. Within a year after the occurrence that has\njust been narrated an old friend of Gambetta’s met with an\naccident which confined him to his house. The statesman strolled\nto his friend’s residence. The accident was a trifling one, and\nthe mistress of the house was holding a sort of informal\nreception, answering questions that were asked her by the numerous\nacquaintances who called.",
        "As Gambetta was speaking, of a sudden he saw before him, at the\nextremity of the room, the lady of his dreams, the sphinx of his\nwaking hours, the woman who four years earlier had torn up the\nnote which he addressed to her, but who more recently had kept his\nwritten words. Both of them were deeply agitated, yet both of them\ncarried off the situation without betraying themselves to others,\nGambetta approached, and they exchanged a few casual commonplaces.\nBut now, close together, eye and voice spoke of what was in their\nhearts.",
        "Presently the lady took her leave. Gambetta followed closely. In\nthe street he turned to her and said in pleading tones:",
        "“Why did you destroy my letter? You knew I loved you, and yet all\nthese years you have kept away from me in silence.”",
        "Then the girl–for she was little more than a girl–hesitated for\na moment. As he looked upon her face he saw that her eyes were\nfull of tears. At last she spoke with emotion:",
        "“You cannot love me, for I am unworthy of you. Do not urge me. Do\nnot make promises. Let us say good-by. At least I must first tell\nyou of my story, for I am one of those women whom no one ever\nmarries.”",
        "Gambetta brushed aside her pleadings. He begged that he might see\nher soon. Little by little she consented; but she would not see\nhim at her house. She knew that his enemies were many and that\neverything he did would be used against him. In the end she agreed\nto meet him in the park at Versailles, near the Petit Trianon, at\neight o’clock in the morning.",
        "When she had made this promise he left her. Already a new\ninspiration had come to him, and he felt that with this woman by\nhis side he could accomplish anything.",
        "At the appointed hour, in the silence of the park and amid the\nsunshine of the beautiful morning, the two met once again.\nGambetta seized her hands with eagerness and cried out in an\nexultant tone:",
        "“At last! At last! At last!”",
        "But the woman’s eyes were heavy with sorrow, and upon her face\nthere was a settled melancholy. She trembled at his touch and\nalmost shrank from him. Here was seen the impetuosity of the\nmeridional. He had first spoken to this woman only two days\nbefore. He knew nothing of her station, of her surroundings, of\nher character. He did not even know her name. Yet one thing he\nknew absolutely–that she was made for him and that he must have\nher for his own. He spoke at once of marriage; but at this she\ndrew away from him still farther.",
        "“No,” she said. “I told you that you must not speak to me until\nyou have heard my story.”",
        "He led her to a great stone bench near by; and, passing his arm\nabout her waist, he drew her head down to his shoulder as he said:",
        "“Well, tell me. I will listen.”",
        "Then this girl of twenty-four, with perfect frankness, because she\nwas absolutely loyal, told him why she felt that they must never\nsee each other any more-much less marry and be happy. She was the\ndaughter of a colonel in the French army. The sudden death of her\nfather had left her penniless and alone. Coming to Paris at the\nage of eighteen, she had given lessons in the household of a high\nofficer of the empire. This man had been attracted by her beauty,\nand had seduced her.",
        "Later she had secured the means of living modestly, realizing more\ndeeply each month how dreadful had been her fate and how she had\nbeen cut off from the lot of other girls. She felt that her life\nmust be a perpetual penance for what had befallen her through her\nignorance and inexperience. She told Gambetta that her name was\nLeonie Leon. As is the custom of Frenchwomen who live alone, she\nstyled herself madame. It is doubtful whether the name by which\nshe passed was that which had been given to her at baptism; but,\nif so, her true name has never been disclosed.",
        "When she had told the whole of her sad story to Gambetta he made\nnothing of it. She said to him again:",
        "“You cannot love me. I should only dim your fame. You can have\nnothing in common with a dishonored, ruined girl. That is what I\ncame here to explain to you. Let us part, and let us for all time\nforget each other.”",
        "But Gambetta took no heed of what she said. Now that he had found\nher, he would not consent to lose her. He seized her slender hands\nand covered them with kisses. Again he urged that she should marry\nhim.",
        "Her answer was a curious one. She was a devoted Catholic and would\nnot regard any marriage as valid save a religious marriage. On the\nother hand, Gambetta, though not absolutely irreligious, was\nleading the opposition to the Catholic party in France. The Church\nto him was not so much a religious body as a political one, and to\nit he was unalterably opposed. Personally, he would have no\nobjections to being married by a priest; but as a leader of the\nanti-clerical party he felt that he must not recognize the\nChurch’s claim in any way. A religious marriage would destroy his\ninfluence with his followers and might even imperil the future of\nthe republic.",
        "They pleaded long and earnestly both then and afterward. He urged\na civil marriage, but she declared that only a marriage according\nto the rites of the Church could ever purify her past and give her\nback her self-respect. In this she was absolutely stubborn, yet\nshe did not urge upon Gambetta that he should destroy his\ninfluence by marrying her in church.",
        "Through all this interplay of argument and pleading and emotion\nthe two grew every moment more hopelessly in love. Then the woman,\nwith a woman’s curious subtlety and indirectness, reached a\nsomewhat singular conclusion. She would hear nothing of a civil\nmarriage, because a civil marriage was no marriage in the eyes of\nPope and prelate. On the other hand, she did not wish Gambetta to\nmar his political career by going through a religious ceremony.\nShe had heard from a priest that the Church recognized two forms\nof betrothal. The usual one looked to a marriage in the future and\ngave no marriage privileges until after the formal ceremony. But\nthere was another kind of betrothal known to the theologians as\nsponsalia de praesente. According to this, if there were an actual\nbetrothal, the pair might have the privileges and rights of\nmarriage immediately, if only they sincerely meant to be married\nin the future.",
        "The eager mind of Leonie Leon caught at this bit of ecclesiastical\nlaw and used it with great ingenuity.",
        "“Let us,” she said, “be formally betrothed by the interchange of a\nring, and let us promise each other to marry in the future. After\nsuch a betrothal as this we shall be the same as married; for we\nshall be acting according to the laws of the Church.”",
        "Gambetta gladly gave his promise. A betrothal ring was purchased;\nand then, her conscience being appeased, she gave herself\ncompletely to her lover. Gambetta was sincere. He said to her:",
        "“If the time should ever come when I shall lose my political\nstation, when I am beaten in the struggle, when I am deserted and\nalone, will you not then marry me when I ask you?”",
        "And Leonie, with her arms about his neck, promised that she would.\nYet neither of them specified what sort of marriage this should\nbe, nor did it seem at the moment as if the question could arise.",
        "For Gambetta was very powerful. He led his party to success in the\nelection of 1877. Again and again his triumphant oratory mastered\nthe National Assembly of France. In 1879 he was chosen to be\npresident of the Chamber of Deputies. He towered far above the\npresident of the republic–Jules Grevy, that hard-headed, close-\nfisted old peasant–and his star had reached its zenith.",
        "All this time he and Leonie Leon maintained their intimacy, though\nit was carefully concealed save from a very few. She lived in a\nplain but pretty house on the Avenue Perrichont in the quiet\nquarter of Auteuil; but Gambetta never came there. Where and when\nthey met was a secret guarded very carefully by the few who were\nhis close associates. But meet they did continually, and their\naffection grew stronger every year. Leonie thrilled at the\nvictories of the man she loved; and he found joy in the hours that\nhe spent with her.",
        "Gambetta’s need of rest was very great, for he worked at the\nhighest tension, like an engine which is using every pound of\nsteam. Bismarck, whose spies kept him well informed of everything\nthat was happening in Paris, and who had no liking for Gambetta,\nsince the latter always spoke of him as “the Ogre,” once said to a\nFrenchman named Cheberry:",
        "“He is the only one among you who thinks of revenge, and who is\nany sort of a menace to Germany. But, fortunately, he won’t last\nmuch longer. I am not speaking thoughtlessly. I know from secret\nreports what sort of a life your great man leads, and I know his\nhabits. Why, his life is a life of continual overwork. He rests\nneither night nor day. All politicians who have led the same life\nhave died young. To he able to serve one’s country for a long time\na statesman must marry an ugly woman, have children like the rest\nof the world, and a country place or a house to one’s self like\nany common peasant, where he can go and rest.”",
        "The Iron Chancellor chuckled as he said this, and he was right.\nAnd yet Gambetta’s end came not so much through overwork as by an\naccident.",
        "It may be that the ambition of Mme. Leon stimulated him beyond his\npowers. However this may be, early in 1882, when he was defeated\nin Parliament on a question which he considered vital, he\nimmediately resigned and turned his back on public life. His\nfickle friends soon deserted him. His enemies jeered and hooted\nthe mention of his name.",
        "He had reached the time which with a sort of prophetic instinct he\nhad foreseen nearly ten years before. So he turned to the woman\nwho had been faithful and loving to him; and he turned to her with\na feeling of infinite peace.",
        "“You promised me,” he said, “that if ever I was defeated and alone\nyou would marry me. The time is now.”",
        "Then this man, who had exercised the powers of a dictator, who had\nlevied armies and shaken governments, and through whose hands\nthere had passed thousands of millions of francs, sought for a\ncountry home. He found for sale a small estate which had once\nbelonged to Balzac, and which is known as Les Jardies. It was in\nwretched repair; yet the small sum which it cost Gambetta–twelve\nthousand francs–was practically all that he possessed. Worn and\nweary as he was, it seemed to him a haven of delightful peace; for\nhere he might live in the quiet country with the still beautiful\nwoman who was soon to become his wife.",
        "It is not known what form of marriage they at last agreed upon.\nShe may have consented to a civil ceremony; or he, being now out\nof public life, may have felt that he could be married by the\nChurch. The day for their wedding had been set, and Gambetta was\nalready at Les Jardies. But there came a rumor that he had been\nshot. Still further tidings bore the news that he was dying.\nParis, fond as it was of scandals, immediately spread the tale\nthat he had been shot by a jealous woman.",
        "The truth is quite the contrary. Gambetta, in arranging his\neffects in his new home, took it upon himself to clean a pair of\ndueling-pistols; for every French politician of importance must\nfight duels, and Gambetta had already done so. Unfortunately, one\ncartridge remained unnoticed in the pistol which Gambetta cleaned.\nAs he held the pistol-barrel against the soft part of his hand the\ncartridge exploded, and the ball passed through the base of the\nthumb with a rending, spluttering noise.",
        "The wound was not in itself serious, but now the prophecy of\nBismarck was fulfilled. Gambetta had exhausted his vitality; a\nfever set in, and before long he died of internal ulceration.",
        "This was the end of a great career and of a great romance of love.\nLeonie Leon was half distraught at the death of the lover who was\nso soon to be her husband. She wandered for hours in the forest\nuntil she reached a convent, where she was received. Afterward she\ncame to Paris and hid herself away in a garret of the slums. All\nthe light of her life had gone out. She wished that she had died\nwith him whose glory had been her life. Friends of Gambetta,\nhowever, discovered her and cared for her until her death, long\nafterward, in 1906.",
        "She lived upon the memories of the past, of the swift love that\nhad come at first sight, but which had lasted unbrokenly; which\nhad given her the pride of conquest, and which had brought her\nlover both happiness and inspiration and a refining touch which\nhad smoothed away his roughness and made him fit to stand in\npalaces with dignity and distinction.",
        "As for him, he left a few lines which have been carefully\npreserved, and which sum up his thought of her. They read:",
        "To the light of my soul; to the star, of my life–Leonie Leon. For\never! For ever!",
        "Often there has arisen some man who, either by his natural gifts\nor by his impudence or by the combination of both, has made\nhimself a recognized leader in the English fashionable world. One\nof the first of these men was Richard Nash, usually known as “Beau\nNash,” who flourished in the eighteenth century. Nash was a man of\ndoubtful origin; nor was he attractive in his looks, for he was a\nhuge, clumsy creature with features that were both irregular and\nharsh. Nevertheless, for nearly fifty years Beau Nash was an\narbiter of fashion. Goldsmith, who wrote his life, declared that\nhis supremacy was due to his pleasing manners, “his assiduity,\nflattery, fine clothes, and as much wit as the ladies had whom he\naddressed.” He converted the town of Bath from a rude little\nhamlet into an English Newport, of which he was the social\nautocrat. He actually drew up a set of written rules which some of\nthe best-born and best-bred people follow slavishly.",
        "Even better known to us is George Bryan Brummel, commonly called\n\"Beau Brummel,” who by his friendship with George IV.–then Prince\nRegent–was an oracle at court on everything that related to dress\nand etiquette and the proper mode of living. His memory has been\nkept alive most of all by Richard Mansfield’s famous impersonation\nof him. The play is based upon the actual facts; for after Brummel\nhad lost the royal favor he died an insane pauper in the French\ntown of Caen. He, too, had a distinguished biographer, since\nBulwer-Lytton’s novel Pelham is really the narrative of Brummel’s\ncurious career.",
        "Long after Brummel, Lord Banelagh led the gilded youth of London,\nand it was at this time that the notorious Lola Montez made her\nfirst appearance in the British capital.",
        "These three men–Nash, Brummel, and Ranelagh–had the advantage of\nbeing Englishmen, and, therefore, of not incurring the old-time\nEnglish suspicion of foreigners. A much higher type of social\narbiter was a Frenchman who for twenty years during the early part\nof Queen Victoria’s reign gave law to the great world of fashion,\nbesides exercising a definite influence upon English art and\nliterature.",
        "This was Count Albert Guillaume d’Orsay, the son of one of\nNapoleon’s generals, and descended by a morganatic marriage from\nthe King of Wurttemburg. The old general, his father, was a man of\nhigh courage, impressive appearance, and keen intellect, all of\nwhich qualities he transmitted to his son. The young Count\nd’Orsay, when he came of age, found the Napoleonic era ended and\nFrance governed by Louis XVIII. The king gave Count d’Orsay a\ncommission in the army in a regiment stationed at Valence in the\nsoutheastern part of France. He had already visited England and\nlearned the English language, and he had made some distinguished\nfriends there, among whom were Lord Byron and Thomas Moore.",
        "On his return to France he began his garrison life at Valence,\nwhere he showed some of the finer qualities of his character. It\nis not merely that he was handsome and accomplished and that he\nhad the gift of winning the affections of those about him. Unlike\nNash and Brummel, he was a gentleman in every sense, and his\ncourtesy was of the highest kind. At the balls given by his\nregiment, although he was more courted than any other officer, he\nalways sought out the plainest girls and showed them the most\nflattering attentions. No “wallflowers” were left neglected when\nD’Orsay was present.",
        "It is strange how completely human beings are in the hands of\nfate. Here was a young French officer quartered in a provincial\ntown in the valley of the Rhone. Who would have supposed that he\nwas destined to become not only a Londoner, but a favorite at the\nBritish court, a model of fashion, a dictator of etiquette, widely\nknown for his accomplishments, the patron of literary men and of\ndistinguished artists? But all these things were to come to pass\nby a mere accident of fortune.",
        "During his firsts visit to London, which has already been\nmentioned, Count d’Orsay was invited once or twice to receptions\ngiven by the Earl and Countess of Blessington, where he was well\nreceived, though this was only an incident of his English sojourn.\nBefore the story proceeds any further it is necessary to give an\naccount of the Earl and of Lady Blessington, since both of their\ncareers had been, to say the least, unusual.",
        "Lord Blessington was an Irish peer for whom an ancient title had\nbeen revived. He was remotely descended from the Stuarts of\nScotland, and therefore had royal blood to boast of. He had been\nwell educated, and in many ways was a man of pleasing manner. On\nthe other hand, he had early inherited a very large property which\nyielded him an income of about thirty thousand pounds a year. He\nhad estates in Ireland, and he owned nearly the whole of a\nfashionable street in London, with the buildings erected on it.",
        "This fortune and the absence of any one who could control him had\nmade him wilful and extravagant and had wrought in him a curious\nlove of personal display. Even as a child he would clamor to be\ndressed in the most gorgeous uniforms; and when he got possession\nof his property his love of display became almost a monomania. He\nbuilt a theater as an adjunct to his country house in Ireland and\nimported players from London and elsewhere to act in it. He loved\nto mingle with the mummers, to try on their various costumes, and\nto parade up and down, now as an oriental prince and now as a\nRoman emperor.",
        "In London he hung about the green-rooms, and was a well-known\nfigure wherever actors or actresses were collected. Such was his\nlove of the stage that he sought to marry into the profession and\nset his heart on a girl named Mary Campbell Browne, who was very\nbeautiful to look at, but who was not conspicuous either for her\nmind or for her morals. When Lord Blessington proposed marriage to\nher she was obliged to tell him that she already had one husband\nstill alive, but she was perfectly willing to live with him and\ndispense with the marriage ceremony. So for several years she did\nlive with him and bore him two children.",
        "It speaks well for the earl that when the inconvenient husband\ndied a marriage at once took place and Mrs. Browne became a\ncountess. Then, after other children had been born, the lady died,\nleaving the earl a widower at about the age of forty. The only\nlegitimate son born of this marriage followed his mother to the\ngrave; and so for the third time the earldom of Blessington seemed\nlikely to become extinct. The death of his wife, however, gave the\nearl a special opportunity to display his extravagant tastes. He\nspent more than four thousand pounds on the funeral ceremonies,\nimporting from France a huge black velvet catafalque which had\nshortly before been used at the public funeral of Napoleon’s\nmarshal, Duroc, while the house blazed with enormous wax tapers\nand glittered with cloth of gold.",
        "Lord Blessington soon plunged again into the busy life of London.\nHaving now no heir, there was no restraint on his expenditures,\nand he borrowed large sums of money in order to buy additional\nestates and houses and to experience the exquisite joy of spending\nlavishly. At this time he had his lands in Ireland, a town house\nin St. James’s Square, another in Seymour Place, and still another\nwhich was afterward to become famous as Gore House, in Kensington.",
        "Some years before he had met in Ireland a lady called Mrs. Maurice\nFarmer; and it happened that she now came to London. The earlier\nstory of her still young life must here be told, because her name\nafterward became famous, and because the tale illustrates\nwonderfully well the raw, crude, lawless period of the Regency,\nwhen England was fighting her long war with Napoleon, when the\nPrince Regent was imitating all the vices of the old French kings,\nwhen prize-fighting, deep drinking, dueling, and dicing were\npractised without restraint in all the large cities and towns of\nthe United Kingdom. It was, as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has said,\n\"an age of folly and of heroism\"; for, while it produced some of\nthe greatest black-guards known to history, it produced also such\nmen as Wellington and Nelson, the two Pitts, Sheridan, Byron,\nShelley, and Sir Walter Scott.",
        "Mrs. Maurice Farmer was the daughter of a small Irish landowner\nnamed Robert Power–himself the incarnation of all the vices of\nthe time. There was little law in Ireland, not even that which\ncomes from public opinion; and Robert Power rode hard to hounds,\ngambled recklessly, and assembled in his house all sorts of\nreprobates, with whom he held frightful orgies that lasted from\nsunset until dawn. His wife and his young daughters viewed him\nwith terror, and the life they led was a perpetual nightmare\nbecause of the bestial carousings in which their father engaged,\nwasting his money and mortgaging his estates until the end of his\nwild career was in plain sight.",
        "There happened to be stationed at Clonmel a regiment of infantry\nin which there served a captain named Maurice St. Leger Farmer. He\nwas a man of some means, but eccentric to a degree. His temper was\nso utterly uncontrolled that even his fellow officers could\nscarcely live with him, and he was given to strange caprices. It\nhappened that at a ball in Clonmel he met the young daughter of\nRobert Power, then a mere child of fourteen years. Captain Farmer\nwas seized with an infatuation for the girl, and he went almost at\nonce to her father, asking for her hand in marriage and proposing\nto settle a sum of money upon her if she married him.",
        "The hard-riding squireen jumped at the offer. His own estate was\nbeing stripped bare. Here was a chance to provide for one of his\ndaughters, or, rather, to get rid of her, and he agreed that she\nshould be married out of hand. Going home, he roughly informed the\ngirl that she was to be the wife of Captain Farmer. He so bullied\nhis wife that she was compelled to join him in this command.",
        "What was poor little Margaret Power to do? She was only a child.\nShe knew nothing of the world. She was accustomed to obey her\nfather as she would have obeyed some evil genius who had her in\nhis power. There were tears and lamentations. She was frightened\nhalf to death; yet for her there was no help. Therefore, while not\nyet fifteen her marriage took place, and she was the unhappy slave\nof a half-crazy tyrant. She had then no beauty whatsoever. She was\nwholly undeveloped–thin and pale, and with rough hair that fell\nover her frightened eyes; yet Farmer wanted her, and he settled\nhis money on her, just as he would have spent the same amount to\ngratify any other sudden whim.",
        "The life she led with him for a few months showed him to be more\nof a devil than a man. He took a peculiar delight in terrifying\nher, in subjecting her to every sort of outrage; nor did he\nrefrain even from beating her with his fists. The girl could stand\na great deal, but this was too much. She returned to her father’s\nhouse, where she was received with the bitterest reproaches, but\nwhere, at least, she was safe from harm, since her possession of a\ndowry made her a person of some small importance.",
        "Not long afterward Captain Farmer fell into a dispute with his\ncolonel, Lord Caledon, and in the course of it he drew his sword\non his commanding officer. The court-martial which was convened to\ntry him would probably have had him shot were it not for the very\ngeneral belief that he was insane. So he was simply cashiered and\nobliged to leave the service and betake himself elsewhere. Thus\nthe girl whom, he had married was quite free–free to leave her\nwretched home and even to leave Ireland.",
        "She did leave Ireland and establish herself in London, where she\nhad some acquaintances, among them the Earl of Blessington. As\nalready said, he had met her in Ireland while she was living with\nher husband; and now from time to time he saw her in a friendly\nway. After the death of his wife he became infatuated with\nMargaret Farmer. She was a good deal alone, and his attentions\ngave her entertainment. Her past experience led her to have no\nreal belief in love. She had become, however, in a small way\ninterested in literature and art, with an eager ambition to be\nknown as a writer. As it happened, Captain Farmer, whose name she\nbore, had died some months before Lord Blessington had decided to\nmake a new marriage. The earl proposed to Margaret Farmer, and the\ntwo were married by special license.",
        "The Countess of Blessington–to give the lady her new title–was\nnow twenty-eight years of age and had developed into a woman of\ngreat beauty. She was noted for the peculiarly vivacious and\nradiant expression which was always on her face. She had a kind of\nvivid loveliness accompanied by grace, simplicity, and a form of\nexquisite proportions. The ugly duckling had become a swan, for\nnow there was no trace of her former plainness to be seen.",
        "Not yet in her life had love come to her. Her first husband had\nbeen thrust upon her and had treated her outrageously. Her second\nhusband was much older than she; and, though she was not without a\ncertain kindly feeling for one who had been kind to her, she\nmarried him, first of all, for his title and position.",
        "Having been reared in poverty, she had no conception of the value\nof money; and, though the earl was remarkably extravagant, the new\ncountess was even more so. One after another their London houses\nwere opened and decorated with the utmost lavishness. They gave\ninnumerable entertainments, not only to the nobility and to men of\nrank, but–because this was Lady Blessington’s peculiar fad–to\nartists and actors and writers of all degrees. The American, N. P.\nWillis, in his Pencilings by the Way, has given an interesting\nsketch of the countess and her surroundings, while the younger\nDisraeli (Lord Beaconsfield) has depicted D’Orsay as Count Mirabel\nin Henrietta Temple. Willis says:",
        "In a long library, lined alternately with splendidly bound books\nand mirrors, and with a deep window of the breadth of the room\nopening upon Hyde Park, I found Lady Blessington alone. The\npicture, to my eye, as the door opened, was a very lovely one–a\nwoman of remarkable beauty, half buried in a fauteuil of yellow\nsatin, reading by a magnificent lamp suspended from the center of\nthe arched ceiling. Sofas, couches, ottomans, and busts, arranged\nin rather a crowded sumptuousness through the room; enameled\ntables, covered with expensive and elegant trifles in every\ncorner, and a delicate white hand in relief on the back of a book,\nto which the eye was attracted by the blaze of diamond rings.",
        "All this “crowded sumptuousness” was due to the taste of Lady\nBlessington. Amid it she received royal dukes, statesmen such as\nPalmerston, Canning, Castlereagh, Russell, and Brougham, actors\nsuch as Kemble and Matthews, artists such as Lawrence and Wilkie,\nand men of letters such as Moore, Bulwer-Lytton, and the two\nDisraelis. To maintain this sort of life Lord Blessington raised\nlarge amounts of money, totaling about half a million pounds\nsterling, by mortgaging his different estates and giving his\npromissory notes to money-lenders. Of course, he did not spend\nthis vast sum immediately. He might have lived in comparative\nluxury upon his income; but he was a restless, eager, improvident\nnobleman, and his extravagances were prompted by the urgings of\nhis wife.",
        "In all this display, which Lady Blessington both stimulated and\nshared, there is to be found a psychological basis. She was now\nverging upon the thirties–a time which is a very critical period\nin a woman’s emotional life, if she has not already given herself\nover to love and been loved in return. During Lady Blessington’s\nearlier years she had suffered in many ways, and it is probable\nthat no thought of love had entered her mind. She was only too\nglad if she could escape from the harshness of her father and the\ncruelty of her first husband. Then came her development into a\nbeautiful woman, content for the time to be languorously stagnant\nand to enjoy the rest and peace which had come to her.",
        "When she married Lord Blessington her love life had not yet\ncommenced; and, in fact, there could be no love life in such a\nmarriage–a marriage with a man much older than herself, scatter-\nbrained, showy, and having no intellectual gifts. So for a time\nshe sought satisfaction in social triumphs, in capturing political\nand literary lions in order to exhibit them in her salon, and in\nspending money right and left with a lavish hand. But, after all,\nin a woman of her temperament none of these things could satisfy\nher inner longings. Beautiful, full of Celtic vivacity,\nimaginative and eager, such a nature as hers would in the end be\nstarved unless her heart should be deeply touched and unless all\nher pent-up emotion could give itself up entirely in the great\nsurrender.",
        "After a few years of London she grew restless and dissatisfied.\nHer surroundings wearied her. There was a call within her for\nsomething more than she had yet experienced. The earl, her\nhusband, was by nature no less restless; and so, without knowing\nthe reason–which, indeed, she herself did not understand–he\nreadily assented to a journey on the Continent.",
        "As they traveled southward they reached at length the town of\nValence, where Count d’Orsay was still quartered with his\nregiment. A vague, indefinable feeling of attraction swept over\nthis woman, who was now a woman of the world and yet quite\ninexperienced in affairs relating to the heart. The mere sound of\nthe French officer’s voice, the mere sight of his face, the mere\nknowledge of his presence, stirred her as nothing had ever stirred\nher until that time. Yet neither he nor she appears to have been\nconscious at once of the secret of their liking. It was enough\nthat they were soothed and satisfied with each other’s company.",
        "Oddly enough, the Earl of Blessington became as devoted to D’Orsay\nas did his wife. The two urged the count to secure a leave of\nabsence and to accompany them to Italy. This he was easily\npersuaded to do; and the three passed weeks and months of a\nlanguorous and alluring intercourse among the lakes and the\nseductive influence of romantic Italy. Just what passed between\nCount d’Orsay and Margaret Blessington at this time cannot be\nknown, for the secret of it has perished with them; but it is\ncertain that before very long they came to know that each was\nindispensable to the other.",
        "The situation was complicated by the Earl of Blessington, who,\nentirely unsuspicious, proposed that the Count should marry Lady\nHarriet Gardiner, his eldest legitimate daughter by his first\nwife. He pressed the match upon the embarrassed D’Orsay, and\noffered to settle the sum of forty thousand pounds upon the bride.\nThe girl was less than fifteen years of age. She had no gifts\neither of beauty or of intelligence; and, in addition, D’Orsay was\nnow deeply in love with her stepmother.",
        "On the other hand, his position with the Blessingtons was daily\ngrowing more difficult. People had begun to talk of the almost\nopen relations between Count d’Orsay and Lady Blessington. Lord\nByron, in a letter written to the countess, spoke to her openly\nand in a playful way of “YOUR D’Orsay.” The manners and morals of\nthe time were decidedly irregular; yet sooner or later the earl\nwas sure to gain some hint of what every one was saying.\nTherefore, much against his real desire, yet in order to shelter\nhis relations with Lady Blessington, D’Orsay agreed to the\nmarriage with Lady Harriet, who was only fifteen years of age.",
        "This made the intimacy between D’Orsay and the Blessingtons appear\nto be not unusual; but, as a matter of fact, the marriage was no\nmarriage. The unattractive girl who had become a bride merely to\nhide the indiscretions of her stepmother was left entirely to\nherself; while the whole family, returning to London, made their\nhome together in Seymour Place.",
        "Could D’Orsay have foreseen the future he would never have done\nwhat must always seem an act so utterly unworthy of him. For\nwithin two years Lord Blessington fell ill and died. Had not\nD’Orsay been married he would now have been free to marry Lady\nBlessington. As it was, he was bound fast to her stepdaughter; and\nsince at that time there was no divorce court in England, and\nsince he had no reason for seeking a divorce, he was obliged to\nlive on through many years in a most ambiguous situation. He did,\nhowever, separate himself from his childish bride; and, having\ndone so, he openly took up his residence with Lady Blessington at\nGore House. By this time, however, the companionship of the two\nhad received a sort of general sanction, and in that easy-going\nage most people took it as a matter of course.",
        "The two were now quite free to live precisely as they would. Lady\nBlessington became extravagantly happy, and Count d’Orsay was\naccepted in London as an oracle of fashion. Every one was eager to\nvisit Gore House, and there they received all the notable men of\nthe time. The improvidence of Lady Blessington, however, was in no\nrespect diminished. She lived upon her jointure, recklessly\nspending capital as well as interest, and gathering under her roof\na rare museum of artistic works, from jewels and curios up to\nmagnificent pictures and beautiful statuary.",
        "D’Orsay had sufficient self-respect not to live upon the money\nthat had come to Lady Blessington from her husband. He was a\nskilful painter, and he practised his art in a professional way.\nHis portrait of the Duke of Wellington was preferred by that\nfamous soldier to any other that had been made of him. The Iron\nDuke was, in fact, a frequent visitor at Gore House, and he had a\nvery high opinion of Count d’Orsay. Lady Blessington herself\nengaged in writing novels of “high life,” some of which were very\npopular in their day. But of all that she wrote there remains only\none book which is of permanent value–her Conversations with Lord\nByron, a very valuable contribution to our knowledge of the\nbrilliant poet.",
        "But a nemesis was destined to overtake the pair. Money flowed\nthrough Lady Blessington’s hands like water, and she could never\nbe brought to understand that what she had might not last for\never. Finally, it was all gone, yet her extravagance continued.\nDebts were heaped up mountain-high. She signed notes of hand\nwithout even reading them. She incurred obligations of every sort\nwithout a moment’s hesitation.",
        "For a long time her creditors held aloof, not believing that her\nresources were in reality exhausted; but in the end there came a\ncrash as sudden as it was ruinous. As if moved by a single\nimpulse, those to whom she owed money took out judgments against\nher and descended upon Gore House in a swarm. This was in the\nspring of 1849, when Lady Blessington was in her sixtieth year and\nD’Orsay fifty-one.",
        "It is a curious coincidence that her earliest novel had portrayed\nthe wreck of a great establishment such as her own. Of the scene\nin Gore House Mr. Madden, Lady Blessington’s literary biographer,\nhas written:",
        "Numerous creditors, bill-discounters, money-lenders, jewelers,\nlace-venders, tax-collectors, gas-company agents, all persons\nhaving claims to urge pressed them at this period simultaneously.\nAn execution for a debt of four thousand pounds was at length put\nin by a house largely engaged in the silk, lace, India-shawl, and\nfancy-jewelry business.",
        "This sum of four thousand pounds was only a nominal claim, but it\nopened the flood-gates for all of Lady Blessington’s creditors.\nMr. Madden writes still further:",
        "On the 10th of May, 1849, I visited Gore House for the last time.\nThe auction was going on. There was a large assemblage of people\nof fashion. Every room was thronged; the well-known library-salon,\nin which the conversaziones took place, was crowded, but not with\nguests. The arm-chair in which the lady of the mansion was wont to\nsit was occupied by a stout, coarse gentleman of the Jewish\npersuasion, busily engaged in examining a marble hand extended on\na book, the fingers of which were modeled from a cast of those of\nthe absent mistress of the establishment. People, as they passed\nthrough the room, poked the furniture, pulled about the precious\nobjects of art and ornaments of various kinds that lay on the\ntable; and some made jests and ribald jokes on the scene they\nwitnessed.",
        "At this compulsory sale things went for less than half their\nvalue. Pictures by Lawrence and Landseer, a library consisting of\nthousands of volumes, vases of exquisite workmanship, chandeliers\nof ormolu, and precious porcelains–all were knocked down\nrelentlessly at farcical prices. Lady Blessington reserved nothing\nfor herself. She knew that the hour had struck, and very soon she\nwas on her way to Paris, whither Count d’Orsay had already gone,\nhaving been threatened with arrest by a boot-maker to whom he owed\nfive hundred pounds.",
        "D’Orsay very naturally went to Paris, for, like his father, he had\nalways been an ardent Bonapartist, and now Prince Louis Bonaparte\nhad been chosen president of the Second French Republic. During\nthe prince’s long period of exile he had been the guest of Count\nd’Orsay, who had helped him both with money and with influence.\nD’Orsay now expected some return for his former generosity. It\ncame, but it came too late. In 1852, shortly after Prince Louis\nassumed the title of emperor, the count was appointed director of\nfine arts; but when the news was brought to him he was already\ndying. Lady Blessington died soon after coming to Paris, before\nthe end of the year 1849.",
        "Comment upon this tangled story is scarcely needed. Yet one may\nquote some sayings from a sort of diary which Lady Blessington\ncalled her “Night Book.” They seem to show that her supreme\nhappiness lasted only for a little while, and that deep down in\nher heart she had condemned herself.",
        "A woman’s head is always influenced by her heart; but a man’s\nheart is always influenced by his head.",
        "The separation of friends by death is less terrible than the\ndivorce of two hearts that have loved, but have ceased to\nsympathize, while memory still recalls what they once were to each\nother.",
        "People are seldom tired of the world until the world is tired of\nthem.",
        "A woman should not paint sentiment until she has ceased to inspire\nit.",
        "It is less difficult for a woman to obtain celebrity by her genius\nthan to be pardoned for it.",
        "Memory seldom fails when its office is to show us the tombs of our\nburied hopes.",
        "In 1812, when he was in his twenty-fourth year, Lord Byron was\nmore talked of than any other man in London. He was in the first\nflush of his brilliant career, having published the early cantos\nof “Childe Harold.” Moreover, he was a peer of the realm,\nhandsome, ardent, and possessing a personal fascination which few\nmen and still fewer women could resist.",
        "Byron’s childhood had been one to excite in him strong feelings of\nrevolt, and he had inherited a profligate and passionate nature.\nHis father was a gambler and a spendthrift. His mother was\neccentric to a degree. Byron himself, throughout his boyish years,\nhad been morbidly sensitive because of a physical deformity–a\nlame, misshapen foot. This and the strange treatment which his\nmother accorded him left him headstrong, wilful, almost from the\nfirst an enemy to whatever was established and conventional.",
        "As a boy, he was remarkable for the sentimental attachments which\nhe formed. At eight years of age he was violently in love with a\nyoung girl named Mary Duff. At ten his cousin, Margaret Parker,\nexcited in him a strange, un-childish passion. At fifteen came one\nof the greatest crises of his life, when he became enamored of\nMary Chaworth, whose grand-father had been killed in a duel by\nByron’s great-uncle. Young as he was, he would have married her\nimmediately; but Miss Chaworth was two years older than he, and\nabsolutely refused to take seriously the devotion of a school-boy.",
        "Byron felt the disappointment keenly; and after a short stay at\nCambridge, he left England, visited Portugal and Spain, and\ntraveled eastward as far as Greece and Turkey. At Athens he wrote\nthe pretty little poem to the “maid of Athens\"–Miss Theresa\nMacri, daughter of the British vice-consul. He returned to London\nto become at one leap the most admired poet of the day and the\ngreatest social favorite. He was possessed of striking personal\nbeauty. Sir Walter Scott said of him: “His countenance was a thing\nto dream of.” His glorious eyes, his mobile, eloquent face,\nfascinated all; and he was, besides, a genius of the first rank.",
        "With these endowments, he plunged into the social whirlpool,\ndenying himself nothing, and receiving everything-adulation,\nfriendship, and unstinted love. Darkly mysterious stories of his\nadventures in the East made many think that he was the hero of\nsome of his own poems, such as “The Giaour” and “The Corsair.” A\nGerman wrote of him that “he was positively besieged by women.\"\nFrom the humblest maid-servants up to ladies of high rank, he had\nonly to throw his handkerchief to make a conquest. Some women did\nnot even wait for the handkerchief to be thrown. No wonder that he\nwas sated with so much adoration and that he wrote of women:",
        "I regard them as very pretty but inferior creatures. I look on\nthem as grown-up children; but, like a foolish mother, I am\nconstantly the slave of one of them. Give a woman a looking-glass\nand burnt almonds, and she will be content.",
        "The liaison which attracted the most attention at this time was\nthat between Byron and Lady Caroline Lamb. Byron has been greatly\nblamed for his share in it; but there is much to be said on the\nother side. Lady Caroline was happily married to the Right Hon.\nWilliam Lamb, afterward Lord Melbourne, and destined to be the\nfirst prime minister of Queen Victoria. He was an easy-going,\ngenial man of the world who placed too much confidence in the\nhonor of his wife. She, on the other hand, was a sentimental fool,\nalways restless, always in search of some new excitement. She\nthought herself a poet, and scribbled verses, which her friends\npolitely admired, and from which they escaped as soon as possible.\nWhen she first met Byron, she cried out: “That pale face is my\nfate!” And she afterward added: “Mad, bad, and dangerous to know!”",
        "It was not long before the intimacy of the two came very near the\npoint of open scandal; but Byron was the wooed and not the wooer.\nThis woman, older than he, flung herself directly at his head.\nNaturally enough, it was not very long before she bored him\nthoroughly. Her romantic impetuosity became tiresome, and very\nsoon she fell to talking always of herself, thrusting her poems\nupon him, and growing vexed and peevish when he would not praise\nthem. As was well said, “he grew moody and she fretful when their\nmutual egotisms jarred.”",
        "In a burst of resentment she left him, but when she returned, she\nwas worse than ever. She insisted on seeing him. On one occasion\nshe made her way into his rooms disguised as a boy. At another\ntime, when she thought he had slighted her, she tried to stab\nherself with a pair of scissors. Still later, she offered her\nfavors to any one who would kill him. Byron himself wrote of her:",
        "You can have no idea of the horrible and absurd things that she\nhas said and done.",
        "Her story has been utilized by Mrs. Humphry Ward in her novel,\n\"The Marriage of William Ashe.”",
        "Perhaps this trying experience led Byron to end his life of\ndissipation. At any rate, in 1813, he proposed marriage to Miss\nAnne Millbanke, who at first refused him; but he persisted, and in\n1815 the two were married. Byron seems to have had a premonition\nthat he was making a terrible mistake. During the wedding ceremony\nhe trembled like a leaf, and made the wrong responses to the\nclergyman. After the wedding was over, in handing his bride into\nthe carriage which awaited them, he said to her:",
        "“Miss Millbanke, are you ready?”",
        "It was a strange blunder for a bridegroom, and one which many\nregarded at the time as ominous for the future. In truth, no two\npersons could have been more thoroughly mismated–Byron, the human\nvolcano, and his wife, a prim, narrow-minded, and peevish woman.\nTheir incompatibility was evident enough from the very first, so\nthat when they returned from their wedding-journey, and some one\nasked Byron about his honeymoon, he answered:",
        "“Call it rather a treacle moon!”",
        "It is hardly necessary here to tell over the story of their\ndomestic troubles. Only five weeks after their daughter’s birth,\nthey parted. Lady Byron declared that her husband was insane;\nwhile after trying many times to win from her something more than\na tepid affection, he gave up the task in a sort of despairing\nanger. It should be mentioned here, for the benefit of those who\nrecall the hideous charges made many decades afterward by Mrs.\nHarriet Beecher Stowe on the authority of Lady Byron, that the\nlatter remained on terms of friendly intimacy with Augusta Leigh,\nLord Byron’s sister, and that even on her death-bed she sent an\namicable message to Mrs. Leigh.",
        "Byron, however, stung by the bitter attacks that were made upon\nhim, left England, and after traveling down the Rhine through\nSwitzerland, he took up his abode in Venice. His joy at leaving\nEngland and ridding himself of the annoyances which had clustered\nthick about him, he expressed in these lines:",
        "Meanwhile he enjoyed himself in reckless fashion. Money poured in\nupon him from his English publisher. For two cantos of “Childe\nHarold” and “Manfred,” Murray paid him twenty thousand dollars.\nFor the fourth canto, Byron demanded and received more than twelve\nthousand dollars. In Italy he lived on friendly terms with Shelley\nand Thomas Moore; but eventually he parted from them both, for he\nwas about to enter upon a new phase of his curious career.",
        "He was no longer the Byron of 1815. Four years of high living and\nmuch brandy-and-water had robbed his features of their refinement.\nHis look was no longer spiritual. He was beginning to grow stout.\nYet the change had not been altogether unfortunate. He had lost\nsomething of his wild impetuosity, and his sense of humor had\ndeveloped. In his thirtieth year, in fact, he had at last become a\nman.",
        "It was soon after this that he met a woman who was to be to him\nfor the rest of his life what a well-known writer has called “a\nstar on the stormy horizon of the poet.” This woman was Teresa,\nCountess Guiccioli, whom he first came to know in Venice. She was\nthen only nineteen years of age, and she was married to a man who\nwas more than forty years her senior. Unlike the typical Italian\nwoman, she was blonde, with dreamy eyes and an abundance of golden\nhair, and her manner was at once modest and graceful. She had\nknown Byron but a very short time when she found herself thrilling\nwith a passion of which until then she had never dreamed. It was\nwritten of her:",
        "She had thought of love but as an amusement; yet she now became\nits slave.",
        "To this love Byron gave an immediate response, and from that time\nuntil his death he cared for no other woman. The two were\nabsolutely mated. Nevertheless, there were difficulties which\nmight have been expected. Count Guiccioli, while he seemed to\nadmire Byron, watched him with Italian subtlety. The English poet\nand the Italian countess met frequently. When Byron was prostrated\nby an attack of fever, the countess remained beside him, and he\nwas just recovering when Count Guiccioli appeared upon the scene\nand carried off his wife. Byron was in despair. He exchanged the\nmost ardent letters with the countess, yet he dreaded assassins\nwhom he believed to have been hired by her husband. Whenever he\nrode out, he went armed with sword and pistols.",
        "Amid all this storm and stress, Byron’s literary activity was\nremarkable. He wrote some of his most famous poems at this time,\nand he hoped for the day when he and the woman whom he loved might\nbe united once for all. This came about in the end through the\npersistence of the pair. The Countess Guiccioli openly took up her\nabode with him, not to be separated until the poet sailed for\nGreece to aid the Greeks in their struggle for independence. This\nwas in 1822, when Byron was in his thirty-fifth year. He never\nreturned to Italy, but died in the historic land for which he gave\nhis life as truly as if he had fallen upon the field of battle.",
        "Teresa Guiccioli had been, in all but name, his wife for just\nthree years. Much, has been said in condemnation of this love-\naffair; but in many ways it is less censurable than almost\nanything in his career. It was an instance of genuine love, a love\nwhich purified and exalted this man of dark and moody moments. It\nsaved him from those fitful passions and orgies of self-indulgence\nwhich had exhausted him. It proved to be an inspiration which at\nlast led him to die for a cause approved by all the world.",
        "As for the woman, what shall we say of her? She came to him\nunspotted by the world. A demand for divorce which her husband\nmade was rejected. A pontifical brief pronounced a formal\nseparation between the two. The countess gladly left behind “her\npalaces, her equipages, society, and riches, for the love of the\npoet who had won her heart.”",
        "Unlike the other women who had cared for him, she was unselfish in\nher devotion. She thought more of his fame than did he himself.\nEmilio Castelar has written:",
        "She restored him and elevated him. She drew him from the mire and\nset the crown of purity upon his brow. Then, when she had\nrecovered this great heart, instead of keeping it as her own\npossession, she gave it to humanity.",
        "For twenty-seven years after Byron’s death, she remained, as it\nwere, widowed and alone. Then, in her old age, she married the\nMarquis de Boissy; but the marriage was purely one of convenience.\nHer heart was always Byron’s, whom she defended with vivacity. In\n1868, she published her memoirs of the poet, filled with\ninteresting and affecting recollections. She died as late as 1873.",
        "Some time between the year 1866 and that of her death, she is said\nto have visited Newstead Abbey, which had once been Byron’s home.\nShe was very old, a widow, and alone; but her affection for the\npoet-lover of her youth was still as strong as ever.",
        "Byron’s life was short, if measured by years only. Measured by\nachievement, it was filled to the very full. His genius blazes\nlike a meteor in the records of English poetry; and some of that\nsplendor gleams about the lovely woman who turned him away from\nvice and folly and made him worthy of his historic ancestry, of\nhis country, and of himself.",
        "Each century, or sometimes each generation, is distinguished by\nsome especial interest among those who are given to fancies–not\nto call them fads. Thus, at the present time, the cultivated few\nare taken up with what they choose to term the “new thought,” or\nthe “new criticism,” or, on the other hand, with socialistic\ntheories and projects. Thirty years ago, when Oscar Wilde was\nregarded seriously by some people, there were many who made a cult\nof estheticism. It was just as interesting when their leader–",
        "or when Sir William Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan guyed him as\nBunthorne in “Patience.”",
        "When Charles Kingsley was a great expounder of British common\nsense, “muscular Christianity” was a phrase which was taken up by\nmany followers. A little earlier, Puseyism and a primitive form of\nsocialism were in vogue with the intellectuals. There are just as\nmany different fashions in thought as in garments, and they come\nand go without any particular reason. To-day, they are discussed\nand practised everywhere. To-morrow, they are almost forgotten in\nthe rapid pursuit of something new.",
        "Forty years before the French Revolution burst forth with all its\nthunderings, France and Germany were affected by what was\ngenerally styled “sensibility.” Sensibility was the sister of\nsentimentality and the half-sister of sentiment. Sentiment is a\nfine thing in itself. It is consistent with strength and humor and\nmanliness; but sentimentality and sensibility are poor cheeping\ncreatures that run scuttering along the ground, quivering and\nwhimpering and asking for perpetual sympathy, which they do not at\nall deserve.",
        "No one need be ashamed of sentiment. It simply gives temper to the\nblade, and mellowness to the intellect. Sensibility, on the other\nhand, is full of shivers and shakes and falsetto notes and\nsqueaks. It is, in fact, all humbug, just as sentiment is often\nall truth.",
        "Therefore, to find an interesting phase of human folly, we may\nlook back to the years which lie between 1756 and 1793 as the era\nof sensibility. The great prophets of this false god, or goddess,\nwere Rousseau in France and Goethe with Schiller in Germany,\ntogether with a host of midgets who shook and shivered in\nimitation of their masters. It is not for us to catalogue these\npersons. Some of them were great figures in literature and\nphilosophy, and strong enough to shake aside the silliness of\nsensibility; but others, while they professed to be great as\nwriters or philosophers, are now remembered only because their\ndevotion to sensibility made them conspicuous in their own time.\nThey dabbled in one thing and another; they “cribbed” from every\npopular writer of the day. The only thing that actually belonged\nto them was a high degree of sensibility.",
        "And what, one may ask, was this precious thing–this sensibility?",
        "It was really a sort of St. Vitus’s dance of the mind, and almost\nof the body. When two persons, in any way interested in each\nother, were brought into the same room, one of them appeared to be\nseized with a rotary movement. The voice rose to a higher pitch\nthan usual, and assumed a tremolo. Then, if the other person was\nalso endowed with sensibility, he or she would rotate and quake in\nsomewhat the same manner. Their cups of tea would be considerably\nagitated. They would move about in as unnatural a manner as\npossible; and when they left the room, they would do so with\ngaspings and much waste of breath.",
        "This was not an exhibition of love–or, at least, not necessarily\nso. You might exhibit sensibility before a famous poet, or a\ngallant soldier, or a celebrated traveler–or, for that matter,\nbefore a remarkable buffoon, like Cagliostro, or a freak, like\nKaspar Hauser.",
        "It is plain enough that sensibility was entirely an abnormal\nthing, and denoted an abnormal state of mind. Only among people\nlike the Germans and French of that period, who were forbidden to\ntake part in public affairs, could it have flourished so long, and\nhave put forth such rank and fetid outgrowths. From it sprang the\n\"elective affinities” of Goethe, and the loose morality of the\nFrench royalists, which rushed on into the roaring sea of\ninfidelity, blasphemy, and anarchy of the Revolution.",
        "Of all the historic figures of that time, there is just one which\nto-day stands forth as representing sensibility. In her own time\nshe was thought to be something of a philosopher, and something\nmore of a novelist. She consorted with all the clever men and\nwomen of her age. But now she holds a minute niche in history\nbecause of the fact that Napoleon stooped to hate her, and because\nshe personifies sensibility.",
        "Criticism has stripped from her the rags and tatters of the\nphilosophy which was not her own. It is seen that she was indebted\nto the brains of others for such imaginative bits of fiction as\nshe put forth in Delphine and Corinne; but as the exponent of\nsensibility she remains unique. This woman was Anne Louise\nGermaine Necker, usually known as Mme. de Stael.",
        "There was much about Mile. Necker’s parentage that made her\ninteresting. Her father was the Genevese banker and minister of\nLouis XVI, who failed wretchedly in his attempts to save the\nfinances of France. Her mother, Suzanne Curchod, as a young girl,\nhad won the love of the famous English historian, Edward Gibbon.\nShe had first refused him, and then almost frantically tried to\nget him back; but by this time Gibbon was more comfortable in\nsingle life and less infatuated with Mlle. Curchod, who presently\nmarried Jacques Necker.",
        "M. Necker’s money made his daughter a very celebrated “catch.” Her\nmother brought her to Paris when the French capital was brilliant\nbeyond description, and yet was tottering to its fall. The\nrumblings of the Revolution could be heard by almost every ear;\nand yet society and the court, refusing to listen, plunged into\nthe wildest revelry under the leadership of the giddy Marie\nAntoinette.",
        "It was here that the young girl was initiated into the most\nelegant forms of luxury, and met the cleverest men of that time–\nVoltaire, Rousseau, Lamartine, Chateaubriand, Volney. She set\nherself to be the most accomplished woman of her day, not merely\nin belles lettres, but in the natural and political sciences.\nThus, when her father was drawing up his monograph on the French\nfinances, Germaine labored hard over a supplementary report,\nstudying documents, records, and the most complicated statistics,\nso that she might obtain a mastery of the subject.",
        "“I mean to know everything that anybody knows,” she said, with an\narrogance which was rather admired in so young a woman.",
        "But, unfortunately, her mind was not great enough to fulfil her\naspiration. The most she ever achieved was a fair knowledge of\nmany things–a knowledge which seemed surprising to the average\nman, but which was superficial enough to the accomplished\nspecialist.",
        "In her twentieth year (1786) it was thought best that she should\nmarry. Her revels, as well as her hard studies, had told upon her\nhealth, and her mother believed that she could not be at once a\nblue-stocking and a woman of the world.",
        "There was something very odd about the relation that existed\nbetween the young girl and this mother of hers. In the Swiss\nprovince where they had both been born, the mother had been\nconsidered rather bold and forward. Her penchant for Gibbon was\nonly one of a number of adventures that have been told about her.\nShe was by no means coy with the gallants of Geneva. Yet, after\nher marriage, and when she came to Paris, she seemed to be\ntransformed into a sort of Swiss Puritan.",
        "As such, she undertook her daughter’s bringing up, and was\nextremely careful about everything that Germaine did and about the\ncompany she kept. On the other hand, the daughter, who in the city\nof Calvin had been rather dull and quiet in her ways, launched out\ninto a gaiety such as she had never known in Switzerland. Mother\nand daughter, in fact, changed parts. The country beauty of Geneva\nbecame the prude of Paris, while the quiet, unemotional young\nGenevese became the light of all the Parisian salons, whether\nsocial or intellectual.",
        "The mother was a very beautiful woman. The daughter, who was to\nbecome so famous, is best described by those two very\nuncomplimentary English words, “dumpy” and “frumpy.” She had\nbulging eyes–which are not emphasized in the flattering portrait\nby Gerard–and her hair was unbecomingly dressed. There are\nreasons for thinking that Germaine bitterly hated her mother, and\nwas intensely jealous of her charm of person. It may be also that\nMme. Necker envied the daughter’s cleverness, even though that\ncleverness was little more, in the end, than the borrowing of\nbrilliant things from other persons. At any rate, the two never\ncared for each other, and Germaine gave to her father the\naffection which her mother neither received nor sought.",
        "It was perhaps to tame the daughter’s exuberance that a marriage\nwas arranged for Mlle. Necker with the Baron de Stael-Holstein,\nwho then represented the court of Sweden at Paris. Many eyebrows\nwere lifted when this match was announced. Baron de Stael had no\npersonal charm, nor any reputation for wit. His standing in the\ndiplomatic corps was not very high. His favorite occupations were\nplaying cards and drinking enormous quantities of punch. Could he\nbe considered a match for the extremely clever Mlle. Necker, whose\nfather had an enormous fortune, and who was herself considered a\ngem of wit and mental power, ready to discuss political economy,\nor the romantic movement of socialism, or platonic love?",
        "Many differed about this. Mlle. Necker was, to be sure, rich and\nclever; but the Baron de Stael was of an old family, and had a\ntitle. Moreover, his easy-going ways–even his punch-drinking and\nhis card-playing–made him a desirable husband at that time of\nFrench social history, when the aristocracy wished to act exactly\nas it pleased, with wanton license, and when an embassy was a very\nconvenient place into which an indiscreet ambassadress might\nretire when the mob grew dangerous. For Paris was now approaching\nthe time of revolution, and all “aristocrats” were more or less in\ndanger.",
        "At first Mme. de Stael rather sympathized with the outbreak of the\npeople; but later their excesses drove her back into sympathy with\nthe royalists. It was then that she became indiscreet and abused\nthe privilege of the embassy in giving shelter to her friends. She\nwas obliged to make a sudden flight across the frontier, whence\nshe did not return until Napoleon loomed up, a political giant on\nthe horizon–victorious general, consul, and emperor.",
        "Mme. de Stael’s relations with Napoleon have, as I remarked above,\nbeen among her few titles to serious remembrance. The Corsican\neagle and the dumpy little Genevese make, indeed, a peculiar pair;\nand for this reason writers have enhanced the oddities of the\npicture.",
        "“Napoleon,” says one, “did not wish any one to be near him who was\nas clever as himself.”",
        "“No,” adds another, “Mme. de Stael made a dead set at Napoleon,\nbecause she wished to conquer and achieve the admiration of\neverybody, even of the greatest man who ever lived.”",
        "“Napoleon found her to be a good deal of a nuisance,” observes a\nthird. “She knew too much, and was always trying to force her\nknowledge upon others.”",
        "The legend has sprung up that Mme. de Stael was too wise and witty\nto be acceptable to Napoleon; and many women repeated with unction\nthat the conqueror of Europe was no match for this frowsy little\nwoman. It is, perhaps, worth while to look into the facts, and to\ndecide whether Napoleon was really of so petty a nature as to feel\nhimself inferior to this rather comic creature, even though at the\ntime many people thought her a remarkable genius.",
        "In the first place, knowing Napoleon, as we have come to know him\nthrough the pages of Mme. de Remusat, Frederic Masson, and others,\nwe can readily imagine the impatience with which the great soldier\nwould sit at dinner, hastening to finish his meal, crowding the\nwhole ceremony into twenty minutes, gulping a glass or two of wine\nand a cup of coffee, and then being interrupted by a fussy little\nfemale who wanted to talk about the ethics of history, or the\npossibility of a new form of government. Napoleon, himself, was\nmaking history, and writing it in fire and flame; and as for\ngovernments, he invented governments all over Europe as suited his\nimperial will. What patience could he have with one whom an\nEnglish writer has rather unkindly described as “an ugly coquette,\nan old woman who made a ridiculous marriage, a blue-stocking, who\nspent much of her time in pestering men of genius, and drawing\nfrom them sarcastic comment behind their backs?”",
        "Napoleon was not the sort of a man to be routed in discussion, but\nhe was most decidedly the sort of man to be bored and irritated by\npedantry. Consequently, he found Mme. de Stael a good deal of a\nnuisance in the salons of Paris and its vicinity. He cared not the\nleast for her epigrams. She might go somewhere else and write all\nthe epigrams she pleased. When he banished her, in 1803, she\nmerely crossed the Rhine into Germany, and established herself at\nWeimar.",
        "The emperor received her son, Auguste de Stael-Holstein, with much\ngood humor, though he refused the boy’s appeal on behalf of his\nmother.",
        "“My dear baron,” said Napoleon, “if your mother were to be in\nParis for two months, I should really be obliged to lock her up in\none of the castles, which would be most unpleasant treatment for\nme to show a lady. No, let her go anywhere else and we can get\nalong perfectly. All Europe is open to her–Rome, Vienna, St.\nPetersburg; and if she wishes to write libels on me, England is a\nconvenient and inexpensive place. Only Paris is just a little too\nnear!”",
        "Thus the emperor gibed the boy–he was only fifteen or sixteen–\nand made fun of the exiled blue-stocking; but there was not a sign\nof malice in what he said, nor, indeed, of any serious feeling at\nall. The legend about Napoleon and Mme. de Stael must, therefore,\ngo into the waste-basket, except in so far as it is true that she\nsucceeded in boring him.",
        "For the rest, she was an earlier George Sand–unattractive in\nperson, yet able to attract; loving love for love’s sake, though\nseldom receiving it in return; throwing herself at the head of\nevery distinguished man, and generally finding that he regarded\nher overtures with mockery. To enumerate the men for whom she\nprofessed to care would be tedious, since the record of her\npassions has no reality about it, save, perhaps, with two\nexceptions.",
        "She did care deeply and sincerely for Henri Benjamin Constant, the\nbrilliant politician and novelist. He was one of her coterie in\nParis, and their common political sentiments formed a bond of\nfriendship between them. Constant was banished by Napoleon in\n1802, and when Mme. de Stael followed him into exile a year later\nhe joined her in Germany.",
        "The story of their relations was told by Constant in Adolphe,\nwhile Mme. de Stael based Delphine on her experiences with him. It\nseems that he was puzzled by her ardor; she was infatuated by his\ngenius. Together they went through all the phases of the tender\npassion; and yet, at intervals, they would tire of each other and\nseparate for a while, and she would amuse herself with other men.\nAt last she really believed that her love for him was entirely\nworn out.",
        "“I always loved my lovers more than they loved me,” she said once,\nand it was true.",
        "Yet, on the other hand, she was frankly false to all of them, and\nhence arose these intervals. In one of them she fell in with a\nyoung Italian named Rocca, and by way of a change she not only\namused herself with him, but even married him. At this time–1811\n–she was forty-five, while Rocca was only twenty-three–a young\nsoldier who had fought in Spain, and who made eager love to the\nshe-philosopher when he was invalided at Geneva.",
        "The marriage was made on terms imposed by the middle-aged woman\nwho became his bride. In the first place, it was to be kept\nsecret; and second, she would not take her husband’s name, but he\nmust pass himself off as her lover, even though she bore him\nchildren. The reason she gave for this extraordinary exhibition of\nher vanity was that a change of name on her part would put\neverybody out.",
        "“In fact,” she said, “if Mme. de Stael were to change her name, it\nwould unsettle the heads of all Europe!”",
        "And so she married Rocca, who was faithful to her to the end,\nthough she grew extremely plain and querulous, while he became\ndeaf and soon lost his former charm. Her life was the life of a\nwoman who had, in her own phrase, “attempted everything\"; and yet\nshe had accomplished nothing that would last. She was loved by a\nman of genius, but he did not love her to the end. She was loved\nby a man of action, and she tired of him very soon. She had a\nwonderful reputation for her knowledge of history and philosophy,\nand yet what she knew of those subjects is now seen to be merely\nthe scraps and borrowings of others.",
        "Something she did when she introduced the romantic literature into\nFrance; and there are passages from her writings which seem worthy\nof preservation. For instance, we may quote her outburst with\nregard to unhappy marriages. “It was the subject,” says Mr.\nGribble, “on which she had begun to think before she was married,\nand which continued to haunt her long after she was left a widow;\nthough one suspects that the word ’marriage’ became a form of\nspeech employed to describe her relations, not with her husband,\nbut with her lovers.” The passage to which I refer is as follows:",
        "In an unhappy marriage, there is a violence of distress surpassing\nall other sufferings in the world. A woman’s whole soul depends\nupon the conjugal tie. To struggle against fate alone, to journey\nto the grave without a friend to support you or to regret you, is\nan isolation of which the deserts of Arabia give but a faint and\nfeeble idea. When all the treasure of your youth has been given in\nvain, when you can no longer hope that the reflection of these\nfirst rays will shine upon the end of your life, when there is\nnothing in the dusk to remind you of the dawn, and when the\ntwilight is pale and colorless as a livid specter that precedes\nthe night, your heart revolts, and you feel that you have been\nrobbed of the gifts of God upon earth.",
        "Equally striking is another prose passage of hers, which seems\nless the careful thought of a philosopher than the screeching of a\ntermagant. It is odd that the first two sentences recall two\nfamous lines of Byron:",
        "The passage by Mme. de Stael is longer and less piquant:",
        "Love is woman’s whole existence. It is only an episode in the\nlives of men. Reputation, honor, esteem, everything depends upon\nhow a woman conducts herself in this regard; whereas, according to\nthe rules of an unjust world, the laws of morality itself are\nsuspended in men’s relations with women. They may pass as good\nmen, though they have caused women the most terrible suffering\nwhich it is in the power of one human being to inflict upon\nanother. They may be regarded as loyal, though they have betrayed\nthem. They may have received from a woman marks of a devotion\nwhich would so link two friends, two fellow soldiers, that either\nwould feel dishonored if he forgot them, and they may consider\nthemselves free of all obligations by attributing the services to\nlove–as if this additional gift of love detracted from the value\nof the rest!",
        "One cannot help noticing how lacking in neatness of expression is\nthis woman who wrote so much. It is because she wrote so much that\nshe wrote in such a muffled manner. It is because she thought so\nmuch that her reflections were either not her own, or were never\nclear. It is because she loved so much, and had so many lovers–\nBenjamin Constant; Vincenzo Monti, the Italian poet; M. de\nNarbonne, and others, as well as young Rocca–that she found both\nlove and lovers tedious.",
        "She talked so much that her conversation was almost always mere\npersonal opinion. Thus she told Goethe that he never was really\nbrilliant until after he had got through a bottle of champagne.\nSchiller said that to talk with her was to have a “rough time,\"\nand that after she left him, he always felt like a man who was\njust getting over a serious illness. She never had time to do\nanything very well.",
        "There is an interesting glimpse of her in the recollections of Dr.\nBollmann, at the period when Mme. de Stael was in her prime. The\nworthy doctor set her down as a genius–an extraordinary,\neccentric woman in all that she did. She slept but a few hours out\nof the twenty-four, and was uninterruptedly and fearfully busy all\nthe rest of the time. While her hair was being dressed, and even\nwhile she breakfasted, she used to keep on writing, nor did she\never rest sufficiently to examine what she had written.",
        "Such then was Mme. de Stael, a type of the time in which she\nlived, so far as concerns her worship of sensibility–of\nsensibility, and not of love; for love is too great to be so\nscattered and made a thing to prattle of, to cheapen, and thus\ndestroy. So we find at the last that Germaine de Stael, though she\nwas much read and much feted and much followed, came finally to\nthat last halting-place where confessedly she was merely an old\nwoman, eccentric, and unattractive. She sued her former lovers for\nthe money she had lent them, she scolded and found fault–as\nperhaps befits her age.",
        "But such is the natural end of sensibility, and of the woman who\ntypifies it for succeeding generations.",
        "Some time ago I entered a fairly large library–one of more than\ntwo hundred thousand volumes–to seek the little brochure on Karl\nMarx written by his old friend and genial comrade Wilhelm\nLiebknecht. It was in the card catalogue. As I made a note of its\nnumber, my friend the librarian came up to me, and I asked him\nwhether it was not strange that a man like Marx should have so\nmany books devoted to him, for I had roughly reckoned the number\nat several hundred.",
        "“Not at all,” said he; “and we have here only a feeble nucleus of\nthe Marx literature–just enough, in fact, to give you a glimpse\nof what that literature really is. These are merely the books\nwritten by Marx himself, and the translations of them, with a few\nexpository monographs. Anything like a real Marx collection would\ntake up a special room in this library, and would have to have its\nown separate catalogue. You see that even these two or three\nhundred books contain large volumes of small pamphlets in many\nlanguages–German, English, French, Italian, Russian, Polish,\nYiddish, Swedish, Hungarian, Spanish; and here,” he concluded,\npointing to a recently numbered card, “is one in Japanese.”",
        "My curiosity was sufficiently excited to look into the matter\nsomewhat further. I visited another library, which was appreciably\nlarger, and whose managers were evidently less guided by their\nprejudices. Here were several thousand books on Marx, and I spent\nthe best part of the day in looking them over.",
        "What struck me as most singular was the fact that there was\nscarcely a volume about Marx himself. Practically all the books\ndealt with his theory of capital and his other socialistic views.\nThe man himself, his personality, and the facts of his life were\ndismissed in the most meager fashion, while his economic theories\nwere discussed with something that verged upon fury. Even such\nstandard works as those of Mehring and Spargo, which profess to be\npartly biographical, sum up the personal side of Marx in a few\npages. In fact, in the latter’s preface he seems conscious of this\ndefect, and says:",
        "Whether socialism proves, in the long span of centuries, to be\ngood or evil, a blessing to men or a curse, Karl Marx must always\nbe an object of interest as one of the great world-figures of\nimmortal memory. As the years go by, thoughtful men and women will\nfind the same interest in studying the life and work of Marx that\nthey do in studying the life and work of Cromwell, of Wesley, or\nof Darwin, to name three immortal world-figures of vastly\ndivergent types.",
        "Singularly little is known of Karl Marx, even by his most ardent\nfollowers. They know his work, having studied his Das Kapital with\nthe devotion and earnestness with which an older generation of\nChristians studied the Bible, but they are very generally\nunacquainted with the man himself. Although more than twenty-six\nyears have elapsed since the death of Marx, there is no adequate\nbiography of him in any language.",
        "Doubtless some better-equipped German writer, such as Franz\nMehring or Eduard Bernstein, will some day give us the adequate\nand full biography for which the world now waits.",
        "Here is an admission that there exists no adequate biography of\nKarl Marx, and here is also an intimation that simply as a man,\nand not merely as a great firebrand of socialism, Marx is well\nworth studying. And so it has occurred to me to give in these\npages one episode of his career that seems to me quite curious,\ntogether with some significant touches concerning the man as apart\nfrom the socialist. Let the thousands of volumes already in\nexistence suffice for the latter. The motto of this paper is not\nthe Vergilian “Arms and the man I sing,” but simply “The man I\nsing\"–and the woman. Karl Marx was born nearly ninety-four years\nago–May 5, 1818–in the city which the French call Treves and the\nGermans Trier, among the vine-clad hills of the Moselle. Today,\nthe town is commonplace enough when you pass through it, but when\nyou look into its history, and seek out that history’s evidences,\nyou will find that it was not always a rather sleepy little place.\nIt was one of the chosen abodes of the Emperors of the West, after\nRome began to be governed by Gauls and Spaniards, rather than by\nRomans and Italians. The traveler often pauses there to see the\nPorta Nigra, that immense gate once strongly fortified, and he\nwill doubtless visit also what is left of the fine baths and\namphitheater.",
        "Treves, therefore, has a right to be termed imperial, and it was\nthe birthplace of one whose sway over the minds of men has been\nboth imperial and imperious.",
        "Karl Marx was one of those whose intellectual achievements were so\ngreat as to dwarf his individuality and his private life. What he\ntaught with almost terrific vigor made his very presence in the\nContinental monarchies a source of eminent danger. He was driven\nfrom country to country. Kings and emperors were leagued together\nagainst him. Soldiers were called forth, and blood was shed\nbecause of him. But, little by little, his teaching seems to have\nleavened the thought of the whole civilized world, so that to-day\nthousands who barely know his name are deeply affected by his\nideas, and believe that the state should control and manage\neverything for the good of all.",
        "Marx seems to have inherited little from either of his parents.\nHis father, Heinrich Marx, was a provincial Jewish lawyer who had\nadopted Christianity, probably because it was expedient, and\nbecause it enabled him to hold local offices and gain some social\nconsequence. He had changed his name from Mordecai to Marx.",
        "The elder Marx was very shrewd and tactful, and achieved a fair\nposition among the professional men and small officials in the\ncity of Treves. He had seen the horrors of the French Revolution,\nand was philosopher enough to understand the meaning of that\nmighty upheaval, and of the Napoleonic era which followed.",
        "Napoleon, indeed, had done much to relieve his race from petty\noppression. France made the Jews in every respect the equals of\nthe Gentiles. One of its ablest marshals–Massena–was a Jew, and\ntherefore, when the imperial eagle was at the zenith of its\nflight, the Jews in every city and town of Europe were\nenthusiastic admirers of Napoleon, some even calling him the\nMessiah.",
        "Karl Marx’s mother, it is certain, endowed him with none of his\ngifts. She was a Netherlandish Jewess of the strictly domestic and\nconservative type, fond of her children and her home, and\ndetesting any talk that looked to revolutionary ideas or to a\nchange in the social order. She became a Christian with her\nhusband, but the word meant little to her. It was sufficient that\nshe believed in God; and for this she was teased by some of her\nskeptical friends. Replying to them, she uttered the only epigram\nthat has ever been ascribed to her.",
        "“Yes,” she said, “I believe in God, not for God’s sake, but for my\nown.”",
        "She was so little affected by change of scene that to the day of\nher death she never mastered German, but spoke almost wholly in\nher native Dutch. Had we time, we might dwell upon the unhappy\nparadox of her life. In her son Karl she found an especial joy, as\ndid her husband. Had the father lived beyond Karl’s early youth,\nhe would doubtless have been greatly pained by the radicalism of\nhis gifted son, as well as by his personal privations. But the\nmother lived until 1863, while Karl was everywhere stirring the\nfires of revolution, driven from land to land, both feared and\npersecuted, and often half famished. As Mr. Spargo says:",
        "It was the irony of life that the son, who kindled a mighty hope\nin the hearts of unnumbered thousands of his fellow human beings,\na hope that is today inspiring millions of those who speak his\nname with reverence and love, should be able to do that only by\ndestroying his mother’s hope and happiness in her son, and that\nevery step he took should fill her heart with a great agony.",
        "When young Marx grew out of boyhood into youth, he was attractive\nto all those who met him. Tall, lithe, and graceful, he was so\nextremely dark that his intimates called him “der neger\"–\"the\nnegro.” His loosely tossing hair gave to him a still more exotic\nappearance; but his eyes were true and frank, his nose denoted\nstrength and character, and his mouth was full of kindliness in\nits expression. His lineaments were not those of the Jewish type.",
        "Very late in life–he died in 1883–his hair and beard turned\nwhite, but to the last his great mustache was drawn like a bar\nacross his face, remaining still as black as ink, and making his\nappearance very striking. He was full of fun and gaiety. As was\nonly natural, there soon came into his life some one who learned\nto love him, and to whom, in his turn, he gave a deep and unbroken\naffection.",
        "There had come to Treves–which passed from France to Prussia with\nthe downfall of Napoleon–a Prussian nobleman, the Baron Ludwig\nvon Westphalen, holding the official title of “national adviser.\"\nThe baron was of Scottish extraction on his mother’s side, being\nconnected with the ducal family of Argyll. He was a man of genuine\nrank, and might have shown all the arrogance and superciliousness\nof the average Prussian official; but when he became associated\nwith Heinrich Marx he evinced none of that condescending manner.\nThe two men became firm friends, and the baron treated the\nprovincial lawyer as an equal.",
        "The two families were on friendly terms. Von Westphalen’s infant\ndaughter, who had the formidable name of Johanna Bertha Julie\nJenny von Westphalen, but who was usually spoken of as Jenny,\nbecame, in time, an intimate of Sophie Marx. She was four years\nolder than Karl, but the two grew up together–he a high-spirited,\nmanly boy, and she a lovely and romantic girl.",
        "The baron treated Karl as if the lad were a child of his own. He\ninfluenced him to love romantic literature and poetry by\ninterpreting to him the great masterpieces, from Homer and\nShakespeare to Goethe and Lessing. He made a special study of\nDante, whose mysticism appealed to his somewhat dreamy nature, and\nto the religious instinct that always lived in him, in spite of\nhis dislike for creeds and churches.",
        "The lore that he imbibed in early childhood stood Karl in good\nstead when he began his school life, and his preparation for the\nuniversity. He had an absolute genius for study, and was no less\nfond of the sports and games of his companions, so that he seemed\nto be marked out for success. At sixteen years of age he showed a\nprecocious ability for planning and carrying out his work with\nthoroughness. His mind was evidently a creative mind, one that was\nable to think out difficult problems without fatigue. His taste\nwas shown in his fondness for the classics, in studying which he\nnoted subtle distinctions of meaning that usually escape even the\nmature scholar. Penetration, thoroughness, creativeness, and a\ncapacity for labor were the boy’s chief characteristics.",
        "With such gifts, and such a nature, he left home for the\nuniversity of Bonn. Here he disappointed all his friends. His\nstudies were neglected; he was morose, restless, and dissatisfied.\nHe fell into a number of scrapes, and ran into debt through sundry\nsmall extravagances. All the reports that reached his home were\nmost unsatisfactory. What had come over the boy who had worked so\nhard in the gymnasium at Treves?",
        "The simple fact was that he had became love-sick. His separation\nfrom Jenny von Westphalen had made him conscious of a feeling\nwhich he had long entertained without knowing it. They had been\nclose companions. He had looked into her beautiful face and seen\nthe luminous response of her lovely eyes, but its meaning had not\nflashed upon his mind. He was not old enough to have a great\nconsuming passion, he was merely conscious of her charm. As he\ncould see her every day, he did not realize how much he wanted\nher, and how much a separation from her would mean.",
        "As “absence makes the heart grow fonder,” so it may suddenly draw\naside the veil behind which the truth is hidden. At Bonn young\nMarx felt as if a blaze of light had flashed before him; and from\nthat moment his studies, his companions, and the ambitions that he\nhad hitherto cherished all seemed flat and stale. At night and in\nthe daytime there was just one thing which filled his mind and\nheart–the beautiful vision of Jenny von Westphalen.",
        "Meanwhile his family, and especially his father, had become\nanxious at the reports which reached them. Karl was sent for, and\nhis stay at Bonn was ended.",
        "Now that he was once more in the presence of the girl who charmed\nhim so, he recovered all his old-time spirits. He wooed her\nardently, and though she was more coy, now that she saw his\npassion, she did not discourage him, but merely prolonged the\necstasy of this wonderful love-making. As he pressed her more and\nmore, and no one guessed the story, there came a time when she was\nurged to let herself become engaged to him.",
        "Here was seen the difference in their ages–a difference that had\nan effect upon their future. It means much that a girl should be\nfour years older than the man who seeks her hand. She is four\nyears wiser; and a girl of twenty is, in fact, a match for a youth\nof twenty-five. Brought up as she had been, in an aristocratic\nhome, with the blood of two noble families in her veins, and being\nwont to hear the easy and somewhat cynical talk of worldly people,\nshe knew better than poor Karl the un-wisdom of what she was about\nto do.",
        "She was noble, the daughter of one high official and the sister of\nanother. Those whom she knew were persons of rank and station. On\nthe other hand, young Marx, though he had accepted Christianity,\nwas the son of a provincial Jewish lawyer, with no fortune, and\nwith a bad record at the university. When she thought of all these\nthings, she may well have hesitated; but the earnest pleading and\nintense ardor of Karl Marx broke down all barriers between them,\nand they became engaged, without informing Jenny’s father of their\ncompact. Then they parted for a while, and Karl returned to his\nhome, filled with romantic thoughts.",
        "He was also full of ambition and of desire for achievement. He had\nwon the loveliest girl in Treves, and now he must go forth into\nthe world and conquer it for her sake. He begged his father to\nsend him to Berlin, and showed how much more advantageous was that\nnew and splendid university, where Hegel’s fame was still in the\nascendent.",
        "In answer to his father’s questions, the younger Marx replied:",
        "“I have something to tell you that will explain all; but first you\nmust give me your word that you will tell no one.”",
        "“I trust you wholly,” said the father. “I will not reveal what you\nmay say to me.”",
        "“Well,” returned the son, “I am engaged to marry Jenny von\nWestphalen. She wishes it kept a secret from her father, but I am\nat liberty to tell you of it.”",
        "The elder Marx was at once shocked and seriously disturbed. Baron\nvon Westphalen was his old and intimate friend. No thought of\nromance between their children had ever come into his mind. It\nseemed disloyal to keep the verlobung of Karl and Jenny a secret;\nfor should it be revealed, what would the baron think of Marx?\nTheir disparity of rank and fortune would make the whole affair\nstand out as something wrong and underhand.",
        "The father endeavored to make his son see all this. He begged him\nto go and tell the baron, but young Marx was not to be persuaded.",
        "“Send me to Berlin,” he said, “and we shall again be separated;\nbut I shall work and make a name for myself, so that when I return\nneither Jenny nor her father will have occasion to be disturbed by\nour engagement.”",
        "With these words he half satisfied his father, and before long he\nwas sent to Berlin, where he fell manfully upon his studies. His\nfather had insisted that he should study law; but his own tastes\nwere for philosophy and history. He attended lectures in\njurisprudence “as a necessary evil,” but he read omnivorously in\nsubjects that were nearer to his heart. The result was that his\nofficial record was not much better than it had been at Bonn.",
        "The same sort of restlessness, too, took possession of him when he\nfound that Jenny would not answer his letters. No matter how\neagerly and tenderly he wrote to her, there came no reply. Even\nthe most passionate pleadings left her silent and unresponsive.\nKarl could not complain, for she had warned him that she would not\nwrite to him. She felt that their engagement, being secret, was\nanomalous, and that until her family knew of it she was not free\nto act as she might wish.",
        "Here again was seen the wisdom of her maturer years; but Karl\ncould not be equally reasonable. He showered her with letters,\nwhich still she would not answer. He wrote to his father in words\nof fire. At last, driven to despair, he said that he was going to\nwrite to the Baron von Westphalen, reveal the secret, and ask for\nthe baron’s fatherly consent.",
        "It seemed a reckless thing to do, and yet it turned out to be the\nwisest. The baron knew that such an engagement meant a social\nsacrifice, and that, apart from the matter of rank, young Marx was\nwithout any fortune to give the girl the luxuries to which she had\nbeen accustomed. Other and more eligible suitors were always\nwithin view. But here Jenny herself spoke out more strongly than\nshe had ever done to Karl. She was willing to accept him with what\nhe was able to give her. She cared nothing for any other man, and\nshe begged her father to make both of them completely happy.",
        "Thus it seemed that all was well, yet for some reason or other\nJenny would not write to Karl, and once more he was almost driven\nto distraction. He wrote bitter letters to his father, who tried\nto comfort him. The baron himself sent messages of friendly\nadvice, but what young man in his teens was ever reasonable? So\nviolent was Karl that at last his father wrote to him:",
        "I am disgusted with your letters. Their unreasonable tone is\nloathsome to me. I should never had expected it of you. Haven’t\nyou been lucky from your cradle up?",
        "Finally Karl received one letter from his betrothed–a letter that\ntransfused him with ecstatic joy for about a day, and then sent\nhim back to his old unrest. This, however, may be taken as a part\nof Marx’s curious nature, which was never satisfied, but was\nalways reaching after something which could not be had.",
        "He fell to writing poetry, of which he sent three volumes to\nJenny–which must have been rather trying to her, since the verse\nwas very poor. He studied the higher mathematics, English and\nItalian, some Latin, and a miscellaneous collection of works on\nhistory and literature. But poetry almost turned his mind. In\nlater years he wrote:",
        "Everything was centered on poetry, as if I were bewitched by some\nuncanny power.",
        "Luckily, he was wise enough, after a time, to recognize how\nhalting were his poems when compared with those of the great\nmasters; and so he resumed his restless, desultory work. He still\nsent his father letters that were like wild cries. They evoked, in\nreply, a very natural burst of anger:",
        "Complete disorder, silly wandering through all branches of\nscience, silly brooding at the burning oil-lamp! In your wildness\nyou see with four eyes–a horrible setback and disregard for\neverything decent. And in the pursuit of this senseless and\npurposeless learning you think to raise the fruits which are to\nunite you with your beloved one! What harvest do you expect to\ngather from them which will enable you to fulfil your duty toward\nher?",
        "Writing to him again, his father speaks of something that Karl had\nwritten as “a mad composition, which denotes clearly how you waste\nyour ability and spend nights in order to create such\nmonstrosities.” The young man was even forbidden to return home\nfor the Easter holidays. This meant giving up the sight of Jenny,\nwhom he had not seen for a whole year. But fortune arranged it\notherwise; for not many weeks later death removed the parent who\nhad loved him and whom he had loved, though neither of them could\nunderstand the other. The father represented the old order of\nthings; the son was born to discontent and to look forward to a\nnew heaven and a new earth.",
        "Returning to Berlin, Karl resumed his studies; but as before, they\nwere very desultory in their character, and began to run upon\nsocial questions, which were indeed setting Germany into a\nferment. He took his degree, and thought of becoming an instructor\nat the university of Jena; but his radicalism prevented this, and\nhe became the editor of a liberal newspaper, which soon, however,\nbecame so very radical as to lead to his withdrawal.",
        "It now seemed best that Marx should seek other fields of activity.\nTo remain in Germany was dangerous to himself and discreditable to\nJenny’s relatives, with their status as Prussian officials. In the\nsummer of 1843, he went forth into the world–at last an\n\"international.” Jenny, who had grown to believe in him as against\nher own family, asked for nothing better than to wander with him,\nif only they might be married. And they were married in this same\nsummer, and spent a short honeymoon at Bingen on the Rhine–made\nfamous by Mrs. Norton’s poem. It was the brief glimpse of sunshine\nthat was to precede year after year of anxiety and want.",
        "Leaving Germany, Marx and Jenny went to Paris, where he became\nknown to some of the intellectual lights of the French capital,\nsuch as Bakunin, the great Russian anarchist, Proudhon, Cabet, and\nSaint-Simon. Most important of all was his intimacy with the poet\nHeine, that marvelous creature whose fascination took on a\nthousand forms, and whom no one could approach without feeling his\nstrange allurement.",
        "Since Goethe’s death, down to the present time, there has been no\nfigure in German literature comparable to Heine. His prose was\nexquisite. His poetry ran through the whole gamut of humanity and\nof the sensations that come to us from the outer world. In his\npoems are sweet melodies and passionate cries of revolt, stirring\nballads of the sea and tender love-songs–strange as these last\nseem when coming from this cynic.",
        "For cynic he was, deep down in his heart, though his face, when in\nrepose, was like the conventional pictures of Christ. His\nfascinations destroyed the peace of many a woman; and it was only\nafter many years of self-indulgence that he married the faithful\nMathilde Mirat in what he termed a “conscience marriage.” Soon\nafter he went to his “mattress-grave,” as he called it, a hopeless\nparalytic.",
        "To Heine came Marx and his beautiful bride. One may speculate as\nto Jenny’s estimate of her husband. Since his boyhood, she had not\nseen him very much. At that time he was a merry, light-hearted\nyouth, a jovial comrade, and one of whom any girl would be proud.\nBut since his long stay in Berlin, and his absorption in the\ntheories of men like Engels and Bauer, he had become a very\ndifferent sort of man, at least to her.",
        "Groping, lost in brown studies, dreamy, at times morose, he was by\nno means a sympathetic and congenial husband for a high-bred,\nspirited girl, such as Jenny von Westphalen. His natural drift was\ntoward a beer-garden, a group of frowsy followers, the reek of\nvile tobacco, and the smell of sour beer. One cannot but think\nthat his beautiful wife must have been repelled by this, though\nwith her constant nature she still loved him.",
        "In Heinrich Heine she found a spirit that seemed akin to hers. Mr.\nSpargo says–and in what he says one must read a great deal\nbetween the lines:",
        "The admiration of Jenny Marx for the poet was even more ardent\nthan that of her husband. He fascinated her because, as she said,\nhe was “so modern,” while Heine was drawn to her because she was\n\"so sympathetic.”",
        "It must be that Heine held the heart of this beautiful woman in\nhis hand. He knew so well the art of fascination; he knew just how\nto supply the void which Marx had left. The two were indeed\naffinities in heart and soul; yet for once the cynical poet stayed\nhis hand, and said no word that would have been disloyal to his\nfriend. Jenny loved him with a love that might have blazed into a\nlasting flame; but fortunately there appeared a special providence\nto save her from herself. The French government, at the request of\nthe King of Prussia, banished Marx from its dominions; and from\nthat day until he had become an old man he was a wanderer and an\nexile, with few friends and little money, sustained by nothing but\nJenny’s fidelity and by his infinite faith in a cause that crushed\nhim to the earth.",
        "There is a curious parallel between the life of Marx and that of\nRichard Wagner down to the time when the latter discovered a royal\npatron. Both of them were hounded from country to country; both of\nthem worked laboriously for so scanty a living as to verge, at\ntimes, upon starvation. Both of them were victims to a cause in\nwhich they earnestly believed–an economic cause in the one case,\nan artistic cause in the other. Wagner’s triumph came before his\ndeath, and the world has accepted his theory of the music-drama.\nThe cause of Marx is far greater and more tremendous, because it\nstrikes at the base of human life and social well-being.",
        "The clash between Wagner and his critics was a matter of poetry\nand dramatic music. It was not vital to the human race. The cause\nof Marx is one that is only now beginning to be understood and\nrecognized by millions of men and women in all the countries of\nthe earth. In his lifetime he issued a manifesto that has become a\nclassic among economists. He organized the great International\nAssociation of Workmen, which set all Europe in a blaze and\nextended even to America. His great book, “Capital\"–Das Kapital–\nwhich was not completed until the last years of his life, is read\nto-day by thousands as an almost sacred work.",
        "Like Wagner and his Minna, the wife of Marx’s youth clung to him\nthrough his utmost vicissitudes, denying herself the necessities\nof life so that he might not starve. In London, where he spent his\nlatest days, he was secure from danger, yet still a sort of\npersecution seemed to follow him. For some time, nothing that he\nwrote could find a printer. Wherever he went, people looked at him\naskance. He and his six children lived upon the sum of five\ndollars a week, which was paid him by the New York Tribune,\nthrough the influence of the late Charles A. Dana. When his last\nchild was born, and the mother’s life was in serious danger, Marx\ncomplained that there was no cradle for the baby, and a little\nlater that there was no coffin for its burial.",
        "Marx had ceased to believe in marriage, despised the church, and\ncared nothing for government. Yet, unlike Wagner, he was true to\nthe woman who had given up so much for him. He never sank to an\nartistic degeneracy. Though he rejected creeds, he was\nnevertheless a man of genuine religious feeling. Though he\nbelieved all present government to be an evil, he hoped to make it\nbetter, or rather he hoped to substitute for it a system by which\nall men might get an equal share of what it is right and just for\nthem to have.",
        "Such was Marx, and thus he lived and died. His wife, who had long\nbeen cut off from her relatives, died about a year before him.\nWhen she was buried, he stumbled and fell into her grave, and from\nthat time until his own death he had no further interest in life.",
        "He had been faithful to a woman and to a cause. That cause was so\ntremendous as to overwhelm him. In sixty years only the first\ngreat stirrings of it could be felt. Its teachings may end in\nnothing, but only a century or more of effort and of earnest\nstriving can make it plain whether Karl Marx was a world-mover or\na martyr to a cause that was destined to be lost.",
        "The middle part of the nineteenth century is a period which has\nbecome more or less obscure to most Americans and Englishmen. At\none end the thunderous campaigns of Napoleon are dying away. In\nthe latter part of the century we remember the gorgeousness of the\nTuileries, the four years’ strife of our own Civil War, and then\nthe golden drift of peace with which the century ended. Between\nthese two extremes there is a stretch of history which seems to\nlack interest for the average student of to-day.",
        "In America, that was a period when we took little interest in the\nmovement of affairs on the continent of Europe. It would not be\neasy, for instance, to imagine an American of 1840 cogitating on\nproblems of socialism, or trying to invent some new form of\narbeiterverein. General Choke was still swindling English\nemigrants. The Young Columbian was still darting out from behind a\ntable to declare how thoroughly he defied the British lion. But\nneither of these patriots, any more than their English compeers,\nwas seriously disturbed about the interests of the rest of the\nworld. The Englishman was contentedly singing “God Save the\nQueen!” The American, was apostrophizing the bird of freedom with\nthe floridity of rhetoric that reached its climax in the “Pogram\nDefiance.” What the Dutchies and Frenchies were doing was little\nmore to an Englishman than to an American.",
        "Continental Europe was a mystery to English-speaking people. Those\nwho traveled abroad took their own servants with them, spoke only\nEnglish, and went through the whole European maze with absolute\nindifference. To them the socialist, who had scarcely received a\nname, was an imaginary being. If he existed, he was only a sort of\noffspring of the Napoleonic wars–a creature who had not yet\nfitted into the ordinary course of things. He was an anomaly, a\nperson who howled in beer-houses, and who would presently be\nregulated, either by the statesmen or by the police.",
        "When our old friend, Mark Tapley, was making with his master a\nhomeward voyage to Britain, what did he know or even care about\nthe politics of France, or Germany, or Austria, or Russia? Not the\nslightest, you may he sure. Mark and his master represented the\ncomplete indifference of the Englishman or American–not\nnecessarily a well-bred indifference, but an indifference that was\ninsular on the one hand and republican on the other. If either of\nthem had heard of a gentleman who pillaged an unmarried lady’s\nluggage in order to secure a valuable paper for another lady, who\nwas married, they would both have looked severely at this abnormal\nperson, and the American would doubtless have added a remark which\nhad something to do with the matchless purity of Columbia’s\ndaughters.",
        "If, again, they had been told that Ferdinand Lassalle had joined\nin the great movement initiated by Karl Marx, it is absolutely\ncertain that neither the Englishman nor the American could have\ngiven you the slightest notion as to who these individuals were.\nThrones might be tottering all over Europe; the red flag might\nwave in a score of cities–what would all this signify, so long as\nBritannia ruled the waves, while Columbia’s feathered emblem\nshrieked defiance three thousand miles away?",
        "And yet few more momentous events have happened in a century than\nthe union which led one man to give his eloquence to the social\ncause, and the other to suffer for that cause until his death.\nMarx had the higher thought, but his disciple Lassalle had the\nmore attractive way of presenting it. It is odd that Marx, today,\nshould lie in a squalid cemetery, while the whole western world\nechoes with his praises, and that Lassalle–brilliant, clear-\nsighted, and remarkable for his penetrating genius–should have\nlived in luxury, but should now know nothing but oblivion, even\namong those who shouted at his eloquence and ran beside him in the\nglory of his triumph.",
        "Ferdinand Lassalle was a native of Breslau, the son of a wealthy\nJewish silk-merchant. Heymann Lassal–for thus the father spelled\nhis name–stroked his hands at young Ferdinand’s cleverness, but\nhe meant it to be a commercial cleverness. He gave the boy a\nthorough education at the University of Breslau, and later at\nBerlin. He was an affectionate parent, and at the same time\ntyrannical to a degree.",
        "It was the old story where the father wishes to direct every step\nthat his son takes, and where the son, bursting out into youthful\nmanhood, feels that he has the right to freedom. The father thinks\nhow he has toiled for the son; the son thinks that if this toil\nwere given for love, it should not be turned into a fetter and\nrestraint. Young Lassalle, instead of becoming a clever silk-\nmerchant, insisted on a university career, where he studied\nearnestly, and was admitted to the most cultured circles.",
        "Though his birth was Jewish, he encountered little prejudice\nagainst his race. Napoleon had changed the old anti-Semitic\nfeeling of fifty years before to a liberalism that was just\nbeginning to be strongly felt in Germany, as it had already been\nin France. This was true in general, but especially true of\nLassalle, whose features were not of a Semitic type, who made\nfriends with every one, and who was a favorite in many salons. His\nportraits make him seem a high-bred and high-spirited Prussian,\nwith an intellectual and clean-cut forehead; a face that has a\nsense of humor, and yet one capable of swift and cogent thought.",
        "No man of ordinary talents could have won the admiration of so\nmany compeers. It is not likely that such a keen and cynical\nobserver as Heinrich Heine would have written as he did concerning\nLassalle, had not the latter been a brilliant and magnetic youth.\nHeine wrote to Varnhagen von Ense, the German historian:",
        "My friend, Herr Lassalle, who brings you this letter, is a young\nman of remarkable intellectual gifts. With the most thorough\nerudition, with the widest learning, with the greatest penetration\nthat I have ever known, and with the richest gift of exposition,\nhe combines an energy of will and a capacity for action which\nastonish me. In no one have I found united so much enthusiasm and\npractical intelligence.",
        "No better proof of Lassalle’s enthusiasm can be found than a few\nlines from his own writings:",
        "I love Heine. He is my second self. What audacity! What\noverpowering eloquence! He knows how to whisper like a zephyr when\nit kisses rose-blooms, how to breathe like fire when it rages and\ndestroys; he calls forth all that is tenderest and softest, and\nthen all that is fiercest and most daring. He has the sweep of the\nwhole lyre!",
        "Lassalle’s sympathy with Heine was like his sympathy with every\none whom he knew. This was often misunderstood. It was\nmisunderstood in his relations with women, and especially in the\ncelebrated affair of the Countess von Hatzfeldt, which began in\nthe year 1846–that is to say, in the twenty-first year of\nLassalle’s age.",
        "In truth, there was no real scandal in the matter, for the\ncountess was twice the age of Lassalle. It was precisely because\nhe was so young that he let his eagerness to defend a woman in\ndistress make him forget the ordinary usage of society, and expose\nhimself to mean and unworthy criticism which lasted all his life.\nIt began by his introduction to the Countess von Hatzfeldt, a lady\nwho was grossly ill-treated by her husband. She had suffered\ninsult and imprisonment in the family castles; the count had\ndeprived her of medicine when she was ill, and had forcibly taken\naway her children. Besides this, he was infatuated with another\nwoman, a baroness, and wasted his substance upon her even contrary\nto the law which protected his children’s rights.",
        "The countess had a son named Paul, of whom Lassalle was extremely\nfond. There came to the boy a letter from the Count von Hatzfeldt\nordering him to leave his mother. The countess at once sent for\nLassalle, who brought with him two wealthy and influential\nfriends–one of them a judge of a high Prussian court–and\ntogether they read the letter which Paul had just received. They\nwere deeply moved by the despair of the countess, and by the\ncruelty of her dissolute husband in seeking to separate the mother\nfrom her son.",
        "In his chivalrous ardor Lassalle swore to help the countess, and\npromised that he would carry on the struggle with her husband to\nthe bitter end. He took his two friends with him to Berlin, and\nthen to Dusseldorf, for they discovered that the Count von\nHatzfeldt was not far away. He was, in fact, at Aix-la-Chapelle\nwith the baroness.",
        "Lassalle, who had the scent of a greyhound, pried about until he\ndiscovered that the count had given his mistress a legal document,\nassigning to her a valuable piece of property which, in the\nordinary course of law, should be entailed on the boy, Paul. The\ncountess at once hastened to the place, broke into her husband’s\nroom, and secured a promise that the deed would be destroyed.",
        "No sooner, however, had she left him than he returned to the\nbaroness, and presently it was learned that the woman had set out\nfor Cologne.",
        "Lassalle and his two friends followed, to ascertain whether the\ndocument had really been destroyed. The three reached a hotel at\nCologne, where the baroness had just arrived. Her luggage, in\nfact, was being carried upstairs. One of Lassalle’s friends opened\na trunk, and, finding a casket there, slipped it out to his\ncompanion, the judge.",
        "Unfortunately, the latter had no means of hiding it, and when the\nbaroness’s servant shouted for help, the casket was found in the\npossession of the judge, who could give no plausible account of\nit. He was, therefore, arrested, as were the other two. There was\nno evidence against Lassalle; but his friends fared badly at the\ntrial, one of them being imprisoned for a year and the other for\nfive years.",
        "From this time Lassalle, with an almost quixotic devotion, gave\nhimself up to fighting the Countess von Hatzfeldt’s battle against\nher husband in the law-courts. The ablest advocates were pitted\nagainst him. The most eloquent legal orators thundered at him and\nat his client, but he met them all with a skill, an audacity, and\na brilliant wit that won for him verdict after verdict. The case\nwent from the lower to the higher tribunals, until, after nine\nyears, it reached the last court of appeal, where Lassalle wrested\nfrom his opponents a magnificently conclusive victory–one that\nmade the children of the countess absolutely safe. It was a battle\nfought with the determination of a soldier, with the gallantry of\na knight errant, and the intellectual acumen of a learned lawyer.",
        "It is not surprising that many refuse to believe that Lassalle’s\nfeeling toward the Countess von Hatzfeldt was a disinterested one.\nA scandalous pamphlet, which was published in French, German, and\nRussian, and written by one who styled herself “Sophie Solutzeff,\"\ndid much to spread the evil report concerning Lassalle. But the\nvery openness and frankness of the service which he did for the\ncountess ought to make it clear that his was the devotion of a\nyouth drawn by an impulse into a strife where there was nothing\nfor him to gain, but everything to lose. He denounced the\nbrutality of her husband, but her letters to him always addressed\nhim as “my dear child.” In writing to her he confides small love-\nsecrets and ephemeral flirtations–which he would scarcely have\ndone, had the countess viewed him with the eye of passion.",
        "Lassalle was undoubtedly a man of impressionable heart, and had\nmany affairs such as Heine had; but they were not deep or lasting.\nThat he should have made a favorable impression on the women whom\nhe met is not surprising, because of his social standing, his\nchivalry, his fine manners, and his handsome face. Mr. Clement\nShorter has quoted an official document which describes him as he\nwas in his earlier years:",
        "Ferdinand Lassalle, aged twenty-three, a civilian born at Breslau\nand dwelling recently at Berlin. He stands five feet six inches in\nheight, has brown, curly hair, open forehead, brown eyebrows, dark\nblue eyes, well proportioned nose and mouth, and rounded chin.",
        "We ought not to be surprised, then, if he was a favorite in\ndrawing-rooms; if both men and women admired him; if Alexander von\nHumboldt cried out with enthusiasm that he was a wunderkind, and\nif there were more than Sophie Solutzeff to be jealous. But the\nrather ungrateful remark of the Countess von Hatzfeldt certainly\ndoes not represent him as he really was.",
        "“You are without reason and judgment where women are concerned,\"\nshe snarled at him; but the sneer only shows that the woman who\nuttered it was neither in love with him nor grateful to him.",
        "In this paper we are not discussing Lassalle as a public agitator\nor as a Socialist, but simply in his relations with the two women\nwho most seriously affected his life. The first was the Countess\nvon Hatzfeldt, who, as we have seen, occupied–or rather wasted–\nnine of the best years of his life. Then came that profound and\nthrilling passion which ended the career of a man who at thirty-\nnine had only just begun to be famous.",
        "Lassalle had joined his intellectual forces with those of Heine\nand Marx. He had obtained so great an influence over the masses of\nthe people as to alarm many a monarch, and at the same time to\nattract many a statesman. Prince Bismarck, for example, cared\nnothing for Lassalle’s championship of popular rights, but sought\nhis aid on finding that he was an earnest advocate of German\nunity.",
        "Furthermore, he was very far from resembling what in those early\ndays was regarded as the typical picture of a Socialist. There was\nnothing frowzy about him; in his appearance he was elegance\nitself; his manners were those of a prince, and his clothing was\nof the best. Seeing him in a drawing-room, no one would mistake\nhim for anything but a gentleman and a man of parts. Hence it is\nnot surprising that his second love was one of the nobility,\nalthough her own people hated Lassalle as a bearer of the red\nflag.",
        "This girl was Helene von Donniges, the daughter of a Bavarian\ndiplomat. As a child she had traveled much, especially in Italy\nand in Switzerland. She was very precocious, and lived her own\nlife without asking the direction of any one. At twelve years of\nage she had been betrothed to an Italian of forty; but this dark\nand pedantic person always displeased her, and soon afterward,\nwhen she met a young Wallachian nobleman, one Yanko Racowitza, she\nwas ready at once to dismiss her Italian lover. Racowitza–young,\na student, far from home, and lacking friends–appealed at once to\nthe girl’s sympathy.",
        "At that very time, in Berlin, where Helene was visiting her\ngrandmother, she was asked by a Prussian baron:",
        "“Do you know Ferdinand Lassalle?”",
        "The question came to her with a peculiar shock. She had never\nheard the name, and yet the sound of it gave her a strange\nemotion. Baron Korff, who perhaps took liberties because she was\nso young, went on to say:",
        "“My dear lady, have you really never seen Lassalle? Why, you and\nhe were meant for each other!”",
        "She felt ashamed to ask about him, but shortly after a gentleman\nwho knew her said:",
        "“It is evident that you have a surprising degree of intellectual\nkinship with Ferdinand Lassalle.”",
        "This so excited her curiosity that she asked her grandmother:",
        "“Who is this person of whom they talk so much–this Ferdinand\nLassalle?”",
        "“Do not speak of him,” replied her grandmother. “He is a shameless\ndemagogue!”",
        "A little questioning brought to Helene all sorts of stories about\nLassalle–the Countess von Hatzfeldt, the stolen casket, the\nmysterious pamphlet, the long battle in the courts–all of which\nexcited her still more. A friend offered to introduce her to the\n\"shameless demagogue.” This introduction happened at a party, and\nit must have been an extraordinary meeting. Seldom, it seemed, was\nthere a better instance of love at first sight, or of the true\naffinity of which Baron Korff had spoken. In the midst of the\npublic gathering they almost rushed into each other’s arms; they\ntalked the free talk of acknowledged lovers; and when she left, he\ncalled her love-names as he offered her his arm.",
        "“Somehow it did not appear at all remarkable,” she afterward\ndeclared. “We seemed to be perfectly fitted to each other.”",
        "Nevertheless, nine months passed before they met again at a\nsoiree. At this time Lassaller gazing upon her, said:",
        "“What would you do if I were sentenced to death?”",
        "“I should wait until your head was severed,” was her answer, “in\norder that you might look upon your beloved to the last, and then\n–I should take poison!”",
        "Her answer delighted him, but he said that there was no danger. He\nwas greeted on every hand with great consideration; and it seemed\nnot unlikely that, in recognition of his influence with the\npeople, he might rise to some high position. The King of Prussia\nsympathized with him. Heine called him the Messiah of the\nnineteenth century. When he passed from city to city, the whole\npopulation turned out to do him honor. Houses were wreathed;\nflowers were thrown in masses upon him, while the streets were\nspanned with triumphal arches.",
        "Worn out with the work and excitement attending the birth of the\nDeutscher Arbeiterverein, or workmen’s union, which he founded in\n1863, Lassalle fled for a time to Switzerland for rest. Helene\nheard of his whereabouts, and hurried to him, with several\nfriends. They met again on July 25,1864, and discussed long and\nintensely the possibilities of their marriage and the opposition\nof her parents, who would never permit her to marry a man who was\nat once a Socialist and a Jew.",
        "Then comes a pitiful story of the strife between Lassalle and the\nDonniges family. Helene’s father and mother indulged in vulgar\nwords; they spoke of Lassalle with contempt; they recalled all the\nscandals that had been current ten years before, and forbade\nHelene ever to mention the man’s name again.",
        "The next scene in the drama took place in Geneva, where the family\nof Herr von Donniges had arrived, and where Helene’s sister had\nbeen betrothed to Count von Keyserling–a match which filled her\nmother with intense joy. Her momentary friendliness tempted Helene\nto speak of her unalterable love for Lassalle. Scarcely had the\nwords been spoken when her father and mother burst into abuse and\ndenounced Lassalle as well as herself.",
        "She sent word of this to Lassalle, who was in a hotel near by.\nScarcely had he received her letter, when Helene herself appeared\nupon the scene, and with all the intensity of which she was\npossessed, she begged him to take her wherever he chose. She would\ngo with him to France, to Italy–to the ends of the earth!",
        "What a situation, and yet how simple a one for a man of spirit! It\nis strange to have to record that to Lassalle it seemed most\ndifficult. He felt that he or she, or both of them, had been\ncompromised. Had she a lady with her? Did she know any one in the\nneighborhood?",
        "What an extraordinary answer! If she were compromised, all the\nmore ought he to have taken her in his arms and married her at\nonce, instead of quibbling and showing himself a prig.",
        "Presently, her maid came in to tell them that a carriage was ready\nto take them to the station, whence a train would start for Paris\nin a quarter of an hour. Helene begged him. with a feeling that\nwas beginning to be one of shame. Lassalle repelled her in words\nthat were to stamp him with a peculiar kind of cowardice.",
        "Why should he have stopped to think of anything except the\nbeautiful woman who was at his feet, and to whom he had pledged\nhis love? What did he care for the petty diplomat who was her\nfather, or the vulgar-tongued woman who was her mother? He should\nhave hurried her and the maid into the train for Paris, and have\nforgotten everything in the world but his Helene, glorious among\nwomen, who had left everything for him.",
        "What was the sudden failure, the curious weakness, the paltriness\nof spirit that came at the supreme moment into the heart of this\nhitherto strong man? Here was the girl whom he loved, driven from\nher parents, putting aside all question of appearances, and\nclinging to him with a wild and glorious desire to give herself to\nhim and to be all his own! That was a thing worthy of a true\nwoman. And he? He shrinks from her and cowers and acts like a\nsimpleton. His courage seems to have dribbled through his finger-\ntips; he is no longer a man–he is a thing.",
        "Out of all the multitude of Lassalle’s former admirers, there is\nscarcely one who has ventured to defend him, much less to laud\nhim; and when they have done so, their voices have had a sound of\nmockery that dies away in their own throats.",
        "Helene, on her side, had compromised herself, and even from the\nview-point of her parents it was obvious that she ought to be\nmarried immediately. Her father, however, confined her to her room\nuntil it was understood that Lassalle had left Geneva. Then her\nfamily’s supplications, the statement that her sister’s marriage\nand even her father’s position were in danger, led her to say that\nshe would give up Lassalle.",
        "It mattered very little, in one way, for whatever he might have\ndone, Lassalle had killed, or at least had chilled, her love. His\nfailure at the moment of her great self-sacrifice had shown him to\nher as he really was–no bold and gallant spirit, but a cringing,\nspiritless self-seeker. She wrote him a formal letter to the\neffect that she had become reconciled to her “betrothed\nbridegroom\"; and they never met again.",
        "Too late, Lassalle gave himself up to a great regret. He went\nabout trying to explain his action to his friends, but he could\nsay nothing that would ease his feeling and reinstate him in the\neyes of the romantic girl. In a frenzy, he sought out the\nWallachian student, Yanko von Racowitza, and challenged him to a\nmortal duel. He also challenged Helene’s father. Years before, he\nhad on principle declined to fight a duel; but now he went raving\nabout as if he sought the death of every one who knew him.",
        "The duel was fought on August 28, 1864. There was some trouble\nabout pistols, and also about seconds; but finally the combatants\nleft a small hotel in a village near Geneva, and reached the\ndueling-grounds. Lassalle was almost joyous in his manner. His old\nconfidence had come back to him; he meant to kill his man.",
        "They took their stations high up among the hills. A few spectators\nsaw their figures outlined against the sky. The command to fire\nrang out, and from both pistols gushed the flame and smoke.",
        "A moment later, Lassalle was seen to sway and fall. A chance shot,\nglancing from a wall, had struck him to the ground. He suffered\nterribly, and nothing but opium in great doses could relieve his\npain. His wound was mortal, and three days later he died.",
        "Long after, Helene admitted that she still loved Lassalle, and\nbelieved that he would win the duel; but after the tragedy, the\ntenderness and patience of Racowitza won her heart. She married\nhim, but within a year he died of consumption. Helene, being\ndisowned by her relations, prepared herself for the stage. She\nmarried a third husband named Shevitch, who was then living in the\nUnited States, but who has since made his home in Russia.",
        "Let us say nothing of Lassalle’s political career. Except for his\nwork as one of the early leaders of the liberal movement in\nGermany, it has perished, and his name has been almost forgotten.\nAs a lover, his story stands out forever as a warning to the timid\nand the recreant. Let men do what they will; but there is just one\nthing which no man is permitted to do with safety in the sight of\nwoman–and that is to play the craven.",
        "Outside of the English-speaking peoples the nineteenth century\nwitnessed the rise and triumphant progress of three great tragic\nactresses. The first two of these–Rachel Felix and Sarah\nBernhardt–were of Jewish extraction; the third, Eleanor Duse, is\nItalian. All of them made their way from pauperism to fame; but\nperhaps the rise of Rachel was the most striking.",
        "In the winter of 1821 a wretched peddler named Abraham–or Jacob–\nFelix sought shelter at a dilapidated inn at Mumpf, a village in\nSwitzerland, not far from Basel. It was at the close of a stormy\nday, and his small family had been toiling through the snow and\nsleet. The inn was the lowest sort of hovel, and yet its\nproprietor felt that it was too good for these vagabonds. He\nconsented to receive them only when he learned that the peddler’s\nwife was to be delivered of a child. That very night she became\nthe mother of a girl, who was at first called Elise. So\nunimportant was the advent of this little waif into the world that\nthe burgomaster of Mumpf thought it necessary to make an entry\nonly of the fact that a peddler’s wife had given birth to a female\nchild. There was no mention of family or religion, nor was the\nrecord anything more than a memorandum.",
        "Under such circumstances was born a child who was destined to\nexcite the wonder of European courts–to startle and thrill and\nutterly amaze great audiences by her dramatic genius. But for ten\nyears the family–which grew until it consisted of one son and\nfive daughters–kept on its wanderings through Switzerland and\nGermany. Finally, they settled down in Lyons, where the mother\nopened a little shop for the sale of second-hand clothing. The\nhusband gave lessons in German whenever he could find a pupil. The\neldest daughter went about the cafes in the evening, singing the\nsongs that were then popular, while her small sister, Rachel,\ncollected coppers from those who had coppers to spare.",
        "Although the family was barely able to sustain existence, the\nfather and mother were by no means as ignorant as their squalor\nwould imply. The peddler Felix had studied Hebrew theology in the\nhope of becoming a rabbi. Failing this, he was always much\ninterested in declamation, public reading, and the recitation of\npoetry. He was, in his way, no mean critic of actors and\nactresses. Long before she was ten years of age little Rachel–who\nhad changed her name from Elise–could render with much feeling\nand neatness of eloquence bits from the best-known French plays of\nthe classic stage.",
        "The children’s mother, on her side, was sharp and practical to a\nhigh degree. She saved and scrimped all through her period of\nadversity. Later she was the banker of her family, and would never\nlend any of her children a sou except on excellent security.\nHowever, this was all to happen in after years.",
        "When the child who was destined to be famous had reached her tenth\nyear she and her sisters made their way to Paris. For four years\nthe second-hand clothing-shop was continued; the father still\ntaught German; and the elder sister, Sarah, who had a golden\nvoice, made the rounds of the cafes in the lowest quarters of the\ncapital, while Rachel passed the wooden plate for coppers.",
        "One evening in the year 1834 a gentleman named Morin, having been\ntaken out of his usual course by a matter of business, entered a\nBRASSERIE for a cup of coffee. There he noted two girls, one of\nthem singing with remarkable sweetness, and the other silently\nfollowing with the wooden plate. M. Morin called to him the girl\nwho sang and asked her why she did not make her voice more\nprofitable than by haunting the cafes at night, where she was sure\nto meet with insults of the grossest kind.",
        "“Why,” said Sarah, “I haven’t anybody to advise me what to do.”",
        "M. Morin gave her his address and said that he would arrange to\nhave her meet a friend who would be of great service to her. On\nthe following day he sent the two girls to a M. Choron, who was\nthe head of the Conservatory of Sacred Music. Choron had Sarah\nsing, and instantly admitted her as a pupil, which meant that she\nwould soon be enrolled among the regular choristers. The beauty of\nher voice made a deep impression on him.",
        "Then he happened to notice the puny, meager child who was standing\nnear her sister. Turning to her, he said:",
        "“And what can you do, little one?”",
        "“I can recite poetry,” was the reply.",
        "“Oh, can you?” said he. “Please let me hear you.”",
        "Rachel readily consented. She had a peculiarly harsh, grating\nvoice, so that any but a very competent judge would have turned\nher away. But M. Choron, whose experience was great, noted the\ncorrectness of her accent and the feeling which made itself felt\nin every line. He accepted her as well as her sister, but urged\nher to study elocution rather than music.",
        "She must, indeed, have had an extraordinary power even at the age\nof fourteen, since not merely her voice but her whole appearance\nwas against her. She was dressed in a short calico frock of a\npattern in which red was spotted with white. Her shoes were of\ncoarse black leather. Her hair was parted at the back of her head\nand hung down her shoulders in two braids, framing the long,\nchildish, and yet gnome-like face, which was unusual in its\ngravity.",
        "At first she was little thought of; but there came a time when she\nastonished both her teachers and her companions by a recital which\nshe gave in public. The part was the narrative of Salema in the\n\"Abufar” of Ducis. It describes the agony of a mother who gives\nbirth to a child while dying of thirst amid the desert sands. Mme.\nde Barviera has left a description of this recital, which it is\nworth while to quote:",
        "While uttering the thrilling tale the thin face seemed to lengthen\nwith horror, the small, deep-set black eyes dilated with a fixed\nstare as though she witnessed the harrowing scene; and the deep,\nguttural tones, despite a slight Jewish accent, awoke a nameless\nterror in every one who listened, carrying him through the\nimaginary woe with a strange feeling of reality, not to be shaken,\noff as long as the sounds lasted.",
        "Even yet, however, the time had not come for any conspicuous\nsuccess. The girl was still so puny in form, so monkey-like in\nface, and so gratingly unpleasant in her tones that it needed time\nfor her to attain her full growth and to smooth away some of the\ndiscords in her peculiar voice.",
        "Three years later she appeared at the Gymnase in a regular debut;\nyet even then only the experienced few appreciated her greatness.\nAmong these, however, were the well-known critic Jules Janin, the\npoet and novelist Gauthier, and the actress Mlle. Mars. They saw\nthat this lean, raucous gutter-girl had within her gifts which\nwould increase until she would he first of all actresses on the\nFrench stage. Janin wrote some lines which explain the secret of\nher greatness:",
        "All the talent in the world, especially when continually applied\nto the same dramatic works, will not satisfy continually the\nhearer. What pleases in a great actor, as in all arts that appeal\nto the imagination, is the unforeseen. When I am utterly ignorant\nof what is to happen, when I do not know, when you yourself do not\nknow what will be your next gesture, your next look, what passion\nwill possess your heart, what outcry will burst from your terror-\nstricken soul, then, indeed, I am willing to see you daily, for\neach day you will be new to me. To-day I may blame, to-morrow\npraise. Yesterday you were all-powerful; to-morrow, perhaps, you\nmay hardly win from me a word of admiration. So much the better,\nthen, if you draw from me unexpected tears, if in my heart you\nstrike an unknown fiber; but tell me not of hearing night after\nnight great artists who every time present the exact counterpart\nof what they were on the preceding one.",
        "It was at the Theatre Francais that she won her final acceptance\nas the greatest of all tragedians of her time. This was in her\nappearance in Corneille’s famous play of “Horace.” She had now, in\n1838, blazed forth with a power that shook her no, less than it\nstirred the emotions and the passions of her hearers. The princes\nof the royal blood came in succession to see her. King Louis\nPhilippe himself was at last tempted by curiosity to be present.\nGifts of money and jewels were showered on her, and through sheer\nnatural genius rather than through artifice she was able to master\na great audience and bend it to her will.",
        "She had no easy life, this girl of eighteen years, for other\nactresses carped at her, and she had had but little training. The\nsordid ways of her old father excited a bitterness which was\nvented on the daughter. She was still under age, and therefore was\ntreated as a gold-mine by her exacting parents. At the most she\ncould play but twice a week. Her form was frail and reed-like. She\nwas threatened with a complaint of the lungs; yet all this served\nto excite rather than to diminish public interest in her. The\nnewspapers published daily bulletins of her health, and her door\nwas besieged by anxious callers who wished to know her condition.\nAs for the greed of her parents, every one said she was not to\nblame for that. And so she passed from poverty to riches, from\nsqualor to something like splendor, and from obscurity to fame.",
        "Much has been written about her that is quite incorrect. She has\nbeen credited with virtues which she never possessed; and, indeed,\nit may be said with only too much truth that she possessed no\nvirtues whatsoever. On the stage while the inspiration lasted she\nwas magnificent. Off the stage she was sly, treacherous,\ncapricious, greedy, ungrateful, ignorant, and unchaste. With such\nan ancestry as she had, with such an early childhood as had been\nhers, what else could one expect from her?",
        "She and her old mother wrangled over money like two pickpockets.\nSome of her best friends she treated shamefully. Her avarice was\nwithout bounds. Some one said that it was not really avarice, but\nonly a reaction from generosity; but this seems an exceedingly\nsubtle theory. It is possible to give illustrations of it,\nhowever. She did, indeed, make many presents with a lavish hand;\nyet, having made a present, she could not rest until she got it\nback. The fact was so well known that her associates took it for\ngranted. The younger Dumas once received a ring from her.\nImmediately he bowed low and returned it to her finger, saying:",
        "“Permit me, mademoiselle, to present it to you in my turn so as to\nsave you the embarrassment of asking for it.”",
        "Mr. Vandam relates among other anecdotes about her that one\nevening she dined at the house of Comte Duchatel. The table was\nloaded with the most magnificent flowers; but Rachel’s keen eyes\npresently spied out the great silver centerpiece. Immediately she\nbegan to admire the latter; and the count, fascinated by her\nmanners, said that he would be glad to present it to her. She\naccepted it at once, but was rather fearful lest he should change\nhis mind. She had come to dinner in a cab, and mentioned the fact.\nThe count offered to send her home in his carriage.",
        "“Yes, that will do admirably,” said she. “There will be no danger\nof my being robbed of your present, which I had better take with\nme.”",
        "“With pleasure, mademoiselle,” replied the count. “But you will\nsend me back my carriage, won’t you?”",
        "Rachel had a curious way of asking every one she met for presents\nand knickknacks, whether they were valuable or not. She knew how\nto make them valuable.",
        "Once in a studio she noticed a guitar hanging on the wall. She\nbegged for it very earnestly. As it was an old and almost\nworthless instrument, it was given her. A little later it was\nreported that the dilapidated guitar had been purchased by a well-\nknown gentleman for a thousand francs. The explanation soon\nfollowed. Rachel had declared that it was the very guitar with\nwhich she used to earn her living as a child in the streets of\nParis. As a memento its value sprang from twenty francs to a\nthousand.",
        "It has always been a mystery what Rachel did with the great sums\nof money which she made in various ways. She never was well\ndressed; and as for her costumes on the stage, they were furnished\nby the theater. When her effects were sold at public auction after\nher death her furniture was worse than commonplace, and her\npictures and ornaments were worthless, except such as had been\ngiven her. She must have made millions of francs, and yet she had\nvery little to leave behind her.",
        "Some say that her brother Raphael, who acted as her personal\nmanager, was a spendthrift; but if so, there are many reasons for\nthinking that it was not his sister’s money that he spent. Others\nsay that Rachel gambled in stocks, but there is no evidence of it.\nThe only thing that is certain is the fact that she was almost\nalways in want of money. Her mother, in all probability, managed\nto get hold of most of her earnings.",
        "Much may have been lost through her caprices. One instance may be\ncited. She had received an offer of three hundred thousand francs\nto act at St. Petersburg, and was on her way there when she passed\nthrough Potsdam, near Berlin. The King of Prussia was entertaining\nthe Russian Czar. An invitation was sent to her in the shape of a\nroyal command to appear before these monarchs and their guests.\nFor some reason or other Rachel absolutely refused. She would\nlisten to no arguments. She would go on to St. Petersburg without\ndelay.",
        "“But,” it was said to her, “if you refuse to appear before the\nCzar at Potsdam all the theaters in St. Petersburg will be closed\nagainst you, because you will have insulted the emperor. In this\nway you will be out the expenses of your journey and also the\nthree hundred thousand francs.”",
        "Rachel remained stubborn as before; but in about half an hour she\nsuddenly declared that she would recite before the two monarchs,\nwhich she subsequently did, to the satisfaction of everybody. Some\none said to her not long after:",
        "“I knew that you would do it. You weren’t going to give up the\nthree hundred thousand francs and all your travelling expenses.”",
        "“You are quite wrong,” returned Rachel, “though of course you will\nnot believe me. I did not care at all about the money and was\ngoing back to France. It was something that I heard which made me\nchange my mind. Do you want to know what it was? Well, after all\nthe arguments were over some one informed me that the Czar\nNicholas was the handsomest man in Europe; and so I made up my\nmind that I would stay in Potsdam long enough to see him.”",
        "This brings us to one phase of Rachel’s nature which is rather\nsinister. She was absolutely hard. She seemed to have no emotions\nexcept those which she exhibited on the stage or the impish\nperversity which irritated so many of those about her. She was in\nreality a product of the gutter, able to assume a demure and\nmodest air, but within coarse, vulgar, and careless of decency.\nYet the words of Jules Janin, which have been quoted above,\nexplain how she could be personally very fascinating.",
        "In all Rachel’s career one can detect just a single strand of real\nromance. It is one that makes us sorry for her, because it tells\nus that her love was given where it never could be openly\nrequited.",
        "During the reign of Louis Philippe the Comte Alexandre Walewski\nheld many posts in the government. He was a son of the great\nNapoleon. His mother was that Polish countess who had accepted\nNapoleon’s love because she hoped that he might set Poland free at\nher desire. But Napoleon was never swerved from his well-\ncalculated plans by the wish of any woman, and after a time the\nCountess Walewska came to love him for himself. It was she to whom\nhe confided secrets which he would not reveal to his own brothers.\nIt was she who followed him to Elba in disguise. It was her son\nwho was Napoleon’s son, and who afterward, under the Second\nEmpire, was made minister of fine arts, minister of foreign\naffairs, and, finally, an imperial duke. Unlike the third\nNapoleon’s natural half-brother, the Duc de Moray, Walewski was a\ngentleman of honor and fine feeling. He never used his\nrelationship to secure advantages for himself. He tried to live in\na manner worthy of the great warrior who was his father.",
        "As minister of fine arts he had much to do with the subsidized\ntheaters; and in time he came to know Rachel. He was the son of\none of the greatest men who ever lived. She was the child of\nroving peddlers whose early training had been in the slums of\ncities and amid the smoke of bar-rooms and cafes. She was tainted\nin a thousand ways, while he was a man of breeding and right\nprinciple. She was a wandering actress; he was a great minister of\nstate. What could there be between these two?",
        "George Sand gave the explanation in an epigram which, like most\nepigrams, is only partly true. She said:",
        "“The count’s company must prove very restful to Rachel.”",
        "What she meant was, of course, that Walewski’s breeding, his\ndignity and uprightness, might be regarded only as a temporary\nrepose for the impish, harsh-voiced, infinitely clever actress. Of\ncourse, it was all this, but we should not take it in a mocking\nsense. Rachel looked up out of her depths and gave her heart to\nthis high-minded nobleman. He looked down and lifted her, as it\nwere, so that she could forget for the time all the baseness and\nthe brutality that she had known, that she might put aside her\nforced vivacity and the self that was not in reality her own.",
        "It is pitiful to think of these two, separated by a great abyss\nwhich could not be passed except at times and hours when each was\nfree. But theirs was, none the less, a meeting of two souls,\nstrangely different in many ways, and yet appealing to each other\nwith a sincerity and truth which neither could show elsewhere.",
        "The end of poor Rachel was one of disappointment. Tempted by the\nfact that Jenny Lind had made nearly two million francs by her\nvisit to the United States, Rachel followed her, but with slight\nsuccess, as was to be expected. Music is enjoyed by human beings\neverywhere, while French classical plays, even though acted by a\ngenius like Rachel, could be rightly understood only by a French-\nspeaking people. Thus it came about that her visit to America was\nonly moderately successful.",
        "She returned to France, where the rising fame of Adelaide Ristori\nwas very bitter to Rachel, who had passed the zenith of her power.\nShe went to Egypt, but received no benefit, and in 1858 she died\nnear Cannes. The man who loved her, and whom she had loved in\nturn, heard of her death with great emotion. He himself lived ten\nyears longer, and died a little while before the fall of the\nSecond Empire.",
