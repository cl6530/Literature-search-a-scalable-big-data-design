        "At Traisenmauer she tarried / until the fourth day.\nUpon the road the dust-clouds / meanwhile never lay.\nBut rose like smoke of fire / around on every side:\nOnward then through Austria / King Etzel’s warriors did ride.",
        "1337",
        "Then eke unto the monarch / such tidings now were told,\nThat at the thought did vanish / all his grief of old,\nIn what high manner Kriemhild / should in his land appear.\nThen gan the monarch hasten / where he did find the lady fair.",
        "1338",
        "Of many a tongue and varied / upon the way were seen\nBefore King Etzel riding / full many warriors keen,\nOf Christians and of heathen / a spreading company.\nTo greet their coming mistress / forth they rode in fair array.",
        "1339",
        "Of Reuss men and Greeks there / great was the tale,\nAnd rapid saw ye riding / the Wallach and the Pole\nOn chargers full of mettle / that they did deftly guide.\nTheir own country’s custom / did they in no wise lay aside.",
        "1340",
        "From the land of Kief / rode there full many a thane,\nAnd the wild Petschenegers. / Full many a bow was drawn,\nAs at the flying wild-fowl / through air the bolt was sped.\nWith might the bow was bended / as far as to the arrow’s head.",
        "1341",
        "A city by the Danube / in Osterland doth stand,\nHight the same is Tulna: / of many a distant land\nSaw Kriemhild there the customs, / ne’er yet to her were known.\nTo many there did greet her / sorrow befell through her anon.",
        "1342",
        "Before the monarch Etzel / rode a company\nOf merry men and mighty, / courteous and fair to see,\nGood four-and-twenty chieftains, / mighty men and bold.\nNaught else was their desire / save but their mistress to behold.",
        "1343",
        "Then the Duke Ramung / from far Wallachia\nWith seven hundred warriors / dashed forth athwart her way:\nTheir going might ye liken / unto birds in flight.\nThen came the chieftain Gibeke, / with his host a stately sight.",
        "1344",
        "Eke the valiant Hornbog / with full thousand men\nFrom the king went forward / to greet his mistress then.\nAfter their country’s custom / in joy they shouted loud;\nThe doughty thanes of Hunland / likewise in merry tourney rode.",
        "1345",
        "Then came a chief from Denmark, / Hawart bold and keen,\nAnd the valiant Iring, / in whom no guile was seen,\nAnd Irnfried of Thuringia, / a stately knight to see:\nKriemhild they greeted / that honor high therefrom had she,",
        "1346",
        "With good knights twelve hundred / whom led they in their train.\nThither with three thousand / came Bloedel eke, the thane\nThat was King Etzel’s brother / out of Hunland:\nUnto his royal mistress / led he then his stately band.",
        "1347",
        "Then did come King Etzel / and Dietrich by his side\nWith all his doughty fellows. / In state there saw ye ride\nMany a knight full noble, / valiant and void of fear.\nThe heart of Lady Kriemhild / did such host of warriors cheer.",
        "1348",
        "Then to his royal mistress / spake Sir Ruediger:\n“Lady, now give I greeting / to the high monarch here.\nWhom to kiss I bid thee, / grant him such favor then:\nFor not to all like greeting / may’st thou give ’mid Etzel’s men.”",
        "1349",
        "They lifted then from saddle / the dame of royal state.\nEtzel the mighty monarch / might then no longer wait,\nBut sprang from off his charger / with many a warrior keen:\nUnto Kriemhild hasting / full joyously he then was seen.",
        "1350",
        "As is to us related, / did there high princes twain\nBy the lady walking / bear aloft her train,\nAs the royal Etzel / went forward her to meet,\nAnd she the noble monarch / with kiss in kindly wise did greet.",
        "1351",
        "Aside she moved her wimple, / whereat her visage fair\nGleamed ’mid the gold around it. / Though many a knight stood there,\nThey deemed that Lady Helke / did boast not fairer face.\nFull close beside the monarch / his brother Bloedel had his place.",
        "1352",
        "To kiss him then Margrave / Ruediger her did tell,\nAnd eke the royal Gibeke / and Sir Dietrich as well.\nOf highest knights a dozen / did Etzel’s spouse embrace;\nOther knights full many / she greeted with a lesser grace.",
        "1353",
        "All the while that Etzel / stood by Kriemhild so,\nDid the youthful riders / as still they’re wont to do:\nIn varied tourney saw ye / each ’gainst the other pass,\nChristian knights and heathen, / as for each the custom was.",
        "1354",
        "From men that followed Dietrich / saw ye in kindly wise\nSplinters from the lances / flying high arise\nAloft above their bucklers, / from hand of good knight sent!\nBy the German strangers / pierced was many a shield and rent.",
        "1355",
        "From shaft of lances breaking / did far the din resound.\nTogether came the warriors / from all the land around,\nEke the guests of the monarch / and many a knight there was.\nThence did the mighty monarch / then with Lady Kriemhild pass.",
        "1356",
        "Stretched a fair pavilion / beside them there was seen:\nWith tents as well was covered / all around the green,\nWhere they now might rest them / all that weary were.\nBy high-born knights was thither / led full many a lady fair.",
        "1357",
        "With their royal mistress, / where in rich cushioned chair\nSat the queen full stately. / ’Twas by the margrave’s care\nThat well had been provided, / with all that seemed good,\nA worthy seat for Kriemhild: / thereat was Etzel glad of mood.",
        "1358",
        "What was by Etzel spoken, / may I not understand.\nIn his right hand resting / lay her fair white hand.\nThey sat in loving fashion, / nor Ruediger would let\nThe king have secret converse / with Lady Kriemhild as yet.",
        "1359",
        "’Twas bidden that the jousting / on all sides they give o’er.\nThe din of stately tourney / heard ye then no more.\nAll the men of Etzel / unto their tents did go,\nFor every warrior present / did they full spacious lodging show.",
        "1360",
        "And now the day was ended / and they did rest the night\nUntil beheld they shining / once more the morning light.\nSoon on charger mounted / again was many a man:\nHeigho, what merry pastime, / the king to honor, they began!",
        "1361",
        "By the Huns the monarch / bade honors high be shown.\nSoon rode they forth from Tulna / unto Vienna town,\nWhere found they many a lady / decked out in fair array:\nThe same the monarch Etzel’s / wife received in stately way.",
        "1362",
        "In very fullest measure / upon them there did wait\nWhate’er they might desire. / Of knights the joy was great,\nLooking toward the revel. / Lodging then sought each one.\nThe wedding of the monarch / was in merry wise begun.",
        "1363",
        "Yet not for all might lodging / within the town be had.\nAll that were not strangers, / Ruediger them bade\nThat they find them lodgings / beyond the city’s bound.\nI ween that at all seasons / by Lady Kriemhild’s side was found",
        "1364",
        "The noble Sir Dietrich / and many another thane,\nWho amid their labors / but little rest had ta’en,\nThat the guests they harbored / of merry mood should be.\nFor Ruediger and his companions / went the time full pleasantly.",
        "1365",
        "The wedding time was fallen / upon a Whitsuntide,\nWhen the monarch Etzel / lay Kriemhild beside\nIn the town at Vienna. / So many men I ween\nThrough her former husband / had not in her service been.",
        "1366",
        "Many that ne’er had seen her / did her rich bounty take,\nAnd many a one among them / unto the strangers spake:\n“We deemed that Lady Kriemhild / of wealth no more had aught\nNow hath she by her giving / here full many a wonder wrought.”",
        "1367",
        "The wedding-feast it lasted / for days full seventeen.\nNe’er of other monarch / hath any told, I ween,\nThat wedded with more splendor: / of such no tale we hear.\nAll that there were present, / new-made apparel did they wear.",
        "1368",
        "I ween that far in Netherland / sat she ne’er before\nAmid such host of warriors. / And this believe I more:\nWas Siegfried rich in treasure, / that yet he ne’er did gain,\nAs here she saw ’fore Etzel, / so many a high and noble thane.",
        "1369",
        "Nor e’er gave any other / at his own wedding-tide\nSo many a costly mantle / flowing long and wide,\nNor yet so rich apparel / –so may ye well believe–\nAs here from hand of Kriemhild / did they one and all receive.",
        "1370",
        "Her friends and eke the strangers / were of a single mind,\nThat they would not be sparing / of treasure in any kind:\nWhat any from them desired, / they gave with willing hand.\nMany a thane from giving / himself of clothing reft did stand.",
        "1371",
        "How by her noble husband / at the Rhine a queen she sat,\nOf that she still was minded, / and her eye grew wet thereat.\nYet well she kept it hidden / that none the same might mark.\nNow had she wealth of honor / after long years of sorrow dark.",
        "1372",
        "What any did with bounty, / ’twas but an idle wind\nBy side of Dietrich’s giving: / what Etzel’s generous mind\nBefore to him had given, / complete did disappear.\nEke wrought there many a wonder / the hand of bounteous Ruediger.",
        "1373",
        "Bloedelein the chieftain / that came from Hunland,\nFull many a chest to empty / did he then command,\nOf gold and eke of silver. / That did they freely give.\nRight merrily the warriors / of the monarch saw ye live.",
        "1374",
        "Likewise the monarch’s minstrels / Werbel and Schwemmelein,\nWon they at the wedding / each alone, I ween,\nMarks a good thousand / or even more than that,\nWhenas fair Lady Kriemhild / ’neath crown by royal Etzel sat.",
        "1375",
        "Upon the eighteenth morning / from Vienna town they went.\nThen in knightly pastime / many a shield was rent\nBy spear full well directed / by doughty rider’s hand.\nSo came the royal Etzel / riding into Hunland.",
        "1376",
        "At Heimburg’s ancient castle / they tarried over night.\nTell the tale of people / no mortal ever might,\nAnd the number of good warriors / did o’er the country come.\nAh, what fairest women / were gathered unto Etzel’s home!",
        "1377",
        "By Miesenburg’s majestic / towers did they embark.\nWith horses eke and riders / the water all was dark,\nAs if ’twere earth they trod on, / as far as eye might see.\nThe way-worn ladies rested / now on board right pleasantly.",
        "1378",
        "Now was lashed together / many a boat full good,\nThat no harm they suffered / from the waves and flood.\nMany a stately awning / likewise above them spread,\nJust as if beneath them / had they land and flowery mead.",
        "1379",
        "When to Etzelburg the tidings / soon were borne along,\nTherein of men and women / were seen a merry throng.\nWho once the Lady Helke / as mistress did obey,\nAnon by Lady Kriemhild / lived they many a gladsome day.",
        "1380",
        "There did stand expectant / full many a maid high-born,\nThat since the death of Helke / had pined all forlorn.\nDaughters of seven monarchs / Kriemhild there waiting found,\nThat were the high adornment / of all King Etzel’s country round.",
        "1381",
        "Herrat, a lofty princess, / did all the train obey,\nSister’s child to Helke, / in whom high virtues lay,\nBetrothed eke of Dietrich, / of royal lineage born,\nDaughter of King Nentwein; / her did high honors eft adorn.",
        "1382",
        "Against the strangers’ coming / her heart with joy flowed o’er:\nEke was thereto devoted / of wealth a mickle store.\nWho might e’er give the picture, / how the king eft sat on throne?\nNor had with any mistress / the Huns such joyous living known.",
        "1383",
        "As with his spouse the monarch / up from the river came,\nUnto the noble Kriemhild / of each they told the name\n’Mong them that she did find there: / she fairer each did greet.\nAh, how mighty mistress / she long did sit in Helke’s seat!",
        "1384",
        "Ready and true the service / to her was offered there.\nThe queen dealt out in plenty / gold and raiment rare,\nSilver eke and jewels. / What over Rhine she brought\nWith her unto Hunland, / soon thereof retained she naught.",
        "1385",
        "Eke in faithful service / she to herself did win\nAll the king’s warriors / and all his royal kin,\n–So that ne’er did Lady Helke / so mighty power wield\nAs until death to Kriemhild / such host did willing service yield.",
        "1386",
        "Thus stood so high in honor / the court and country round,\nThat there at every season / was pleasant pastime found\nBy each, whithersoever / his heart’s desire might stand:\nThat wrought the monarch’s favor / and the queen’s full bounteous hand.",
