        "Madelene’s anteroom was full of poor people. They flocked to her, though\nshe did not pauperize them by giving her services free. She had got the\nreputation of miraculous cures, the theory in the tenements being that\nher father had swindled his satanic “familiar” by teaching his daughter\nwithout price what he had had to pay for with his immortal soul. Adelaide\nrefused the chair a sick-looking young artisan awkwardly pressed upon\nher. Leaning against the window seat, she tried to interest herself in\nher fellow-invalids. But she had not then the secret which unlocks the\nmystery of faces; she was still in the darkness in which most of us\nproudly strut away our lives, deriding as dreamers or cranks those who\nare in the light and see. With almost all of us the innate sympathies of\nrace, which give even wolves and vultures the sense of fraternal\ncompanionship in the storm and stress of the struggle for existence, are\ndeep overlaid with various kinds of that egotistic ignorance called class\nfeeling. Adelaide felt sorry for “the poor,” but she had yet to learn\nthat she was of them, as poor in other and more important ways as they in\nmoney and drawing-room manners. Surfaces and the things of the surface\nobscured or distorted all the realities for her, as for most of us; and\nthe fact that her intelligence laughed at and scorned her perverted\ninstincts was of as little help to her as it is to most of us.",
        "When Madelene was free she said to her sister-in-law, in mock\nseriousness, “Well, and what can I do for you!” as if she were\nanother patient.",
        "Adelaide’s eyes shifted. Clearly Madelene’s keen, pretense-scattering\ngaze was not one to invite to inspect a matter which might not look at\nall well stripped of its envelopes of phrase and haze. She wished she had\nnot come; indeed, she had been half-wishing it during the whole\nthree-quarters of an hour of watching and thinking on Madelene’s\nwonderful life, so crowded with interest, with achievement, with all that\nHiram Ranger’s daughter called, and believed, “the real thing.”",
        "“Nothing, nothing at all,” replied she to Madelene’s question. “I just\ndropped in to annoy you with my idle self–or, maybe, to please you. You\nknow we’re taught at church that a large part of the joy of the saved\ncomes from watching the misery of the damned.”",
        "But Madelene had the instinct of the physician born. “She has something\non her mind and wants me to help her,” she thought. Aloud she said: “I\nfeel idle, myself. We’ll sit about for an hour, and you’ll stay to dinner\nwith Arthur and me–we have it here to-day, as your mother is going out.\nAfterwards I must do my round.”",
        "A silence, with Adelaide wondering where Ross was and just when he would\nreturn. Then Madelene went on: “I’ve been trying to persuade your mother\nto give up the house, change it into a hospital.”",
        "The impudence of it! Their house, their home; and this newcomer into\nthe family–a newcomer from nowhere–trying to get it away from them!\n“Mother said something about it,” said Adelaide frostily. “But she\ndidn’t say you had been at her. I think she ought to be left alone in\nher old age.”",
        "“The main thing is to keep her interested in life, don’t you think?\"\nsuggested Madelene, noting how Adelaide was holding herself in check, but\ndisregarding it. “Your mother’s a plain, natural person and never has\nfelt at home in that big house. Indeed, I don’t think any human being\never does feel at home in a big house. There was a time when they fitted\nin with the order of things; but now they’ve become silly, it seems to\nme, except for public purposes. When we all get sensible and go in for\nbeing somebody instead of for showing off, we’ll live in convenient,\ncomfortable, really tasteful and individual houses and have big buildings\nonly for general use.”",
        "“I’m afraid the world will never grow up into your ideals, Madelene,\"\nsaid Del with restrained irony. “At least not in our day.”",
        "“I’m in no hurry,” replied Madelene good-naturedly. “The most\nsatisfactory thing about common sense is that one can act on it without\nwaiting for others to get round to it. But we weren’t talking of those\nwho would rather be ignorantly envied than intelligently happy. We were\ntalking of your mother.”",
        "“Mother was content with her mode of life until you put these ’advanced’\nideas into her head.”",
        "“’Advanced’ is hardly the word,” said Madelene. “They used to be her\nideas–always have been, underneath. If it weren’t that she is afraid of\nhurting your feelings, she’d not hesitate an instant. She’d take the\nsmall house across the way and give herself the happiness of helping with\nthe hospital she’d install in the big house. You know she always had a\npassion for waiting on people. Here’s her chance to gratify it to good\npurpose. Why should she let the fact that she has money enough not to\nhave to work stand between her and happy usefulness?”",
        "“What does Arthur think?” asked Del. Her resentment was subsiding in\nspite of her determined efforts to keep it glowing; Madelene knew the\nsecret of manner that enables one to be habitually right without giving\nothers the sense of being put irritatingly in the wrong. “But,” smiling,\n“I needn’t inquire. Of course he assents to whatever you say.”",
        "“You know Arthur better than that,” replied Madelene, with no trace of\nresentment. She had realized from the beginning of the conversation that\nDel’s nerves were on edge; her color, alternately rising and fading, and\nher eyes, now sparkling now dull, could only mean fever from a tempest of\nsecret emotion. “He and I usually agree simply because we see things in\nabout the same light.”",
        "“You furnish the light,” teased Adelaide.",
        "“That was in part so at first,” admitted her sister-in-law. “Arthur had\ngot many foolish notions in his head through accepting thoughtlessly the\nideas of the people he traveled with. But, once he let his good sense get\nthe upper hand–He helps me now far more than I help him.”",
        "“Has he consented to let them give him a salary yet?” asked Adelaide,\nnot because she was interested, but because she desperately felt that\nthe conversation must be kept alive. Perhaps Ross was even now on his\nway to Saint X.",
        "“He still gets what he fixed on at first–ten dollars a week more than\nthe foreman.”",
        "“Honestly, Madelene,” said Adelaide, in a flush and flash of\nirritation, “don’t you think that’s absurd? With the responsibility of\nthe whole business on his shoulders, you know he ought to have more\nthan a common workman.”",
        "“In the first place you must not forget that everyone is paid very high\nwages at the university works now.”",
        "“And he’s the cause of that–of the mills doing so well,” said Del. She\ncould see Ross entering the gates–at the house–inquiring–What was she\ntalking to Madelene about? Yes, about Arthur and the mills. “Even the men\nthat criticise him–Arthur, I mean–most severely for ’sowing discontent\nin the working class,’ as they call it,” she went on, “concede that he\nhas wonderful business ability. So he ought to have a huge salary.”",
        "“No doubt he earns it,” replied Madelene. “But the difficulty is that he\ncan’t take it without it’s coming from the other workmen. You see, money\nis coined sweat. All its value comes from somebody’s labor. He deserves\nto be rewarded for happening to have a better brain than most men, and\nfor using it better. But there’s no fund for rewarding the clever for\nbeing cleverer than most of their fellow-beings, any more than there’s a\nfund to reward the handsome for being above the average in looks. So he\nhas to choose between robbing his fellow-workmen, who are in his power,\nand going without riches. He prefers going without.”",
        "“That’s very noble of you both, I’m sure,” said Adelaide absently.\nThe Chicago express would be getting in at four o’clock–about five\nhours. Absurd! The morning papers said Mr. Whitney had had a relapse.\n“Very noble,” she repeated absently. “But I doubt if anybody will\nappreciate it.”",
        "Madelene smiled cheerfully. “That doesn’t worry Arthur or me,” said she,\nwith her unaffected simplicity. “We’re not looking for appreciation.\nWe’re looking for a good time.” Del, startled, began to listen to\nMadelene. A good time–\"And it so happens,” came in Madelene’s sweet,\nhonest voice, “that we’re unable to have it, unless we feel that we\naren’t getting it by making some one else have a not-so-good time or a\nvery bad time indeed. You’ve heard of Arthur’s latest scheme?”",
        "“Some one told me he was playing smash at the mills, encouraging the\nworkmen to idleness and all that sort of thing,” said Del. Somehow she\nfelt less feverish, seemed compelled to attention by Madelene’s voice and\neyes. “But I didn’t hear or understand just how.”",
        "“He’s going to establish a seven-hours’ working day; and, if possible,\ncut it down to six.” Madelene’s eyes were sparkling. Del watched her\nlongingly, enviously. How interested she was in these useful things. How\nfine it must be to be interested where one could give one’s whole heart\nwithout concealment–or shame! “And,” Madelene was saying, “the\nuniversity is to change its schedules so that all its practical courses\nwill be at hours when men working in the factory can take them. It’s\nsimply another development of his and Dory’s idea that a factory\nbelonging to a university ought to set a decent example–ought not to\ncompel its men to work longer than is necessary for them to earn at\nhonest wages a good living for themselves and their families.”",
        "“So that they can sit round the saloons longer,” suggested Adelaide, and\nthen she colored and dropped her eyes; she was repeating Ross’s comment\non this sort of “concession to the working classes.” She had thought it\nparticularly acute when he made it. Now–",
        "“No doubt most of them will spend their time foolishly at first,\"\nMadelene conceded. “Working people have had to work so hard for\nothers–twelve, fourteen, sixteen hours a day, just to be allowed to\nlive–that they’ve had really no free time at all; so they’ve had no\nchance to learn how to spend free time sensibly. But they’ll learn, those\nof them that have capacity for improvement. Those that haven’t will soon\ndrop out.”",
        "“The factories can’t make money on such a plan as that,” said Adelaide,\nagain repeating a remark of Ross’s, but deliberately, because she\nbelieved it could be answered, wished to hear it answered.",
        "“No, not dividends,” replied Madelene. “But dividends are to be abolished\nin that department of the university, just as they are in the other\ndepartments. And the money the university needs is to come from tuition\nfees. Everyone is to pay for what he gets. Some one has to pay for it;\nwhy not the person who gets the benefit? Especially when the university’s\nfarms and workshops and factories give every student, man and woman, a\nchance to earn a good living. I tell you Adelaide, the time is coming\nwhen every kind of school except kindergarten will be self-supporting.\nAnd then you’ll see a human race that is really fine, really capable, has\na real standard of self-respect.”",
        "As Madelene talked, her face lighted up and all her latent magnetism was\nradiating. Adelaide, for no reason that was clear to her, yielded to a\nsurge of impulse and, half-laughing, half in tears, suddenly kissed\nMadelene. “No wonder Arthur is mad about you, stark mad,” she cried.",
        "Madelene was for a moment surprised out of that perfect\nself-unconsciousness which is probably the rarest of human qualities, and\nwhich was her greatest charm to those who knew her well. She blushed\nfuriously and angrily. Her and Arthur’s love was to her most sacred,\nabsolutely between themselves. When any outsider could observe them,\neven her sister Walpurga, she seemed so much the comrade and\nfellow-worker in her attitude toward him that people thought and spoke of\ntheir married life as “charming, but cold.” Alone with him, she showed\nthat which was for him alone–a passion whose strength had made him\nstrong, as the great waves give their might to the swimmer who does not\nshrink from adventuring them. Adelaide’s impulsive remark, had violated\nher profoundest modesty; and in the shock she showed it.",
        "“I beg your pardon!” exclaimed Adelaide, though she did not realize\nwherein she had offended. Love was an unexplored, an unsuspected mystery\nto her then–the more a mystery because she thought she knew from having\nread about it and discussed it and reasoned about it.",
        "“Oh, I understand,” said Madelene, contrite for her betraying expression.\n“Only–some day–when you really fall in love–you’ll know why I was\nstartled.”",
        "Adelaide shrank within herself. “Even Madelene,” thought she, “who\nhas not a glance for other people’s affairs, knows how it is between\nDory and me.”",
        "It was Madelene’s turn to be repentant and apologetic. “I didn’t mean\nquite that,” she stammered. “Of course I know you care for Dory–”",
        "The tears came to Del’s eyes and the high color to her cheeks. “You\nneedn’t make excuses,” she cried. “It’s the truth. I don’t care–in\nthat way.”",
        "A silence; then Madelene, gently: “Was this what you came to tell me?”",
        "Adelaide nodded slowly. “Yes, though I didn’t know it.”",
        "“Why tell me?”",
        "“Because I think I care for another man.” Adelaide was not looking away.\nOn the contrary, as she spoke, saying the words in an even, reflective\ntone, she returned her sister-in-law’s gaze fully, frankly. “And I don’t\nknow what to do. It’s very complicated–doubly complicated.”",
        "“The one you were first engaged to?”",
        "“Yes,” said Del. “Isn’t it pitiful in me?” And there was real\nself-contempt in her voice and in her expression. “I assumed that I\ndespised him because he was selfish and calculating, and such a snob!\nNow I find I don’t mind his selfishness, and that I, too, am a snob.” She\nsmiled drearily. “I suppose you feel the proper degree of contempt and\naversion.”",
        "“We are all snobs,” answered Madelene tranquilly. “It’s one of the\ndeepest dyes of the dirt we came from, the hardest to wash out.”",
        "“Besides,” pursued Adelaide, “he and I have both learned by\nexperience–which has come too late; it always does.”",
        "“Not at all,” said Madelene briskly. “Experience is never too late. It’s\nalways invaluably useful in some way, no matter when it comes.”",
        "Adelaide was annoyed by Madelene’s lack of emotion. She had thought her\nsister-in-law would be stirred by a recital so romantic, so dark with the\nmenace of tragedy. Instead, the doctor was acting as if she were dealing\nwith mere measles. Adelaide, unconsciously, of course–we are never\nconscious of the strong admixture of vanity in our “great” emotions–was\npiqued into explaining. “We can never be anything to each other. There’s\nDory; then there’s Theresa. And I’d suffer anything rather than bring\nshame and pain on others.”",
        "Madelene smiled–somehow not irritatingly–an appeal to Del’s sense of\nproportion. “Suffer,” repeated she. “That’s a good strong word for a\nwoman to use who has health and youth and beauty, and material\ncomfort–and a mind capable of an infinite variety of interests.\"\nAdelaide’s tragic look was slipping from her. “Don’t take too gloomy a\nview,” continued the physician. “Disease and death and one other thing\nare the only really serious ills. In this case of yours everything will\ncome round quite smooth, if you don’t get hysterical and if Ross Whitney\nis really in earnest and not\"–Madelene’s tone grew even more\ndeliberate–\"not merely getting up a theatrical romance along the lines\nof the ’high-life’ novels you idle people set such store by.” She saw, in\nDel’s wincing, that the shot had landed. “No,” she went on, “your case is\none of the commonplaces of life among those people–and they’re in all\nclasses–who look for emotions and not for opportunities to be useful.”",
        "Del smiled, and Madelene hailed the returning sense of humor as an\nencouraging sign.",
        "“The one difficult factor is Theresa,” said Madelene, pushing on with the\nprescription. “She–I judge from what I’ve heard–she’s what’s commonly\ncalled a ’poor excuse for a woman.’ We all know that type. You may be\nsure her vanity would soon find ways of consoling her. Ninety-nine times\nout of a hundred where one holds on after the other has let go the reason\nis vanity, wounded vanity–where it isn’t the material consideration that\nexplains why there are so many abandoned wives and so few abandoned\nhusbands. Theresa doesn’t really care for her husband; love that isn’t\nmutual isn’t love. So she’d come up smiling for a second husband.”",
        "“She’s certainly vain,” said Del. “Losing him would all but kill her.”",
        "“Not if it’s done tactfully,” replied Madelene. “Ross’ll no doubt be glad\nto sacrifice his own vanity and so arrange matters that she’ll be able to\nsay and feel that she got rid of him, not he of her. Of course that means\na large sacrifice of his vanity–and of yours, too. But neither of you\nwill mind that.”",
        "Adelaide looked uncomfortable; Madelene took advantage of her abstraction\nto smile at the confession hinted in that look.",
        "“As for Dory–”",
        "At that name Del colored and hung her head.",
        "“As for Dory,” repeated Madelene, not losing the chance to emphasize the\neffect, “he’s no doubt fond of you. But no matter what he–or you–may\nimagine, his fondness cannot be deeper than that of a man for a woman\nbetween whom and him there isn’t the perfect love that makes one of two.”",
        "“I don’t understand his caring for me,” cried Del. “I can’t believe he\ndoes.” This in the hope of being contradicted.",
        "But Madelene simply said: “Perhaps he’d not feel toward you as he seems\nto think he does if he hadn’t known you before you went East and got fond\nof the sort of thing that attracts you in Ross Whitney. Anyhow, Dory’s\nthe kind of man to be less unhappy over losing you than over keeping you\nwhen you didn’t want to stay. You may be like his eyes to him, but you\nknow if that sort of man loses his sight he puts seeing out of the\ncalculation and goes on just the same. Dory Hargrave is a man; and a\nreal man is bigger than any love affair, however big.”",
        "Del was trying to hide the deep and smarting wound to her vanity. “You\nare right, Madelene,” said she. “Dory is cold.”",
        "“But I didn’t say that,” replied Madelene. “Most of us prefer people like\nthose flabby sea creatures that are tossed aimlessly about by the waves\nand have no permanent shape or real purposes and desires, but take\nwhatever their feeble tentacles can hold without effort.” Del winced, and\nit was the highest tribute to Dr. Madelene’s skill that the patient did\nnot hate her and refuse further surgery. “We’re used to that sort,\"\ncontinued she. “So when a really alive, vigorous, pushing, and resisting\npersonality comes in contact with us, we say, ’How hard! How unfeeling!’\nThe truth, of course, is that Ross is more like the flabby things–his\nenvironment dominates him, while Dory dominates his environment. But you\nlike the Ross sort, and you’re right to suit yourself. To suit yourself\nis the only way to avoid making a complete failure of life. Wait till\nDory comes home. Then talk it out with him. Then–free yourself and marry\nRoss, who will have freed himself. It’s quite simple. People are\nbroad-minded about divorce nowadays. It never causes serious scandal,\nexcept among those who’d like to do the same, but don’t dare.”",
        "It certainly was easy, and ought to have been attractive. Yet Del was not\nattracted. “One can’t deal with love in such a cold, calculating\nfashion,” thought she, by way of bolstering up her weakening confidence\nin the reality and depth of those sensations which had seemed so\nthrillingly romantic an hour before. “I’ve given you the impression that\nRoss and I have some–some understanding,” said she. “But we haven’t. For\nall I know, he may not care for me as I care for him.”",
        "“He probably doesn’t,” was Madelene’s douche-like reply. “You attract him\nphysically–which includes his feeling that you’d show off better than\nTheresa before the world for which he cares so much. But, after all,\nthat’s much the way you care for him, isn’t it?”",
        "Adelaide’s bosom was swelling and falling agitatedly. Her eyes flashed;\nher reserve vanished. “I’m sure he’d love me!” cried she. “He’d give me\nwhat my whole soul, my whole body cry out for. Madelene, you don’t\nunderstand! I am so starved, so out in the cold! I want to go in where\nit’s warm–and–human!” The truth, the deep-down truth, was out at last;\nAdelaide had wrenched it from herself.",
        "“And Dory will not give you that?” said Madelene, all gentleness and\nsympathy, and treading softly on this dangerous, delicate ground.",
        "“He gives me nothing!” exclaimed Adelaide bitterly. “He is waiting for me\nto learn to love him. He ought to know that a woman has to be taught to\nlove–at least the sort of woman I am. He treats me as if I were his\nequal, when he ought to see that I’m not; that I’m like a child, and have\nto be shown what’s good for me, and made to take it.”",
        "“Then, perhaps, after all,” said Madelene slowly, “you do care for Dory.”",
        "“Of course I care for him; how could anyone help it? But he won’t let\nme–he won’t let me!” She was on the verge of hysteria, and her loss of\nself-control was aggravated by the feeling that she was making a weak,\nsilly exhibition of herself.",
        "“If you do care for Dory, and Dory cares for you, and you don’t care for\nRoss–” began Madelene.",
        "“But I do care for Ross, too! Oh, I must be bad–bad! Could a nice woman\ncare for two men at the same time?”",
        "“I’d have said not,” was Madelene’s answer. “But now I see that she\ncould–and I see why.”",
        "“Dory means something to me that Ross does not. Ross means something that\nDory does not. I want it all–all that both of them represent. I can’t\ngive up Dory; I can’t give up Ross. You don’t understand, Madelene,\nbecause you’ve had the good luck to get it all from Arthur.”",
        "After a silence, Madelene said: “Well, Del, what are you going to do?”",
        "“Nothing.”",
        "“That’s sensible!” approved Madelene. “If Ross really loves you, then,\nwhether he can have you or not, he’ll free himself from Theresa. He\nsimply couldn’t go on with her. And if you really care for him, then,\nwhen Dory comes home he’ll free you.”",
        "“That ought to be so,” said Adelaide, not seeing the full meaning of\nMadelene’s last words. “But it isn’t. Neither Ross nor I is strong\nenough. We’re just ordinary people, the sort that most everybody is and\nthat most everybody despises when they see them or read about them as\nthey really are. No, he and I will each do the conventional thing. We’ll\ngo our separate ways “–contemptuously–\"the easiest ways. And we’ll\nregard ourselves as martyrs to duty–that’s how they put it in the\nnovels, isn’t it?”",
        "“At least,” said Madelene, with a calmness she was far from feeling,\n“both you and Ross have had your lesson in the consequence of doing\nthings in a hurry.”",
        "“That’s the only way people brought up as we’ve been ever do anything. If\nwe don’t act on impulse, we don’t act at all; we drift on.”",
        "“Drifting is action, the most decisive kind of action.” Madelene was\nagain thinking what would surely happen the instant Dory found how\nmatters stood; but she deemed it tactful to keep this thought to herself.\nJust then she was called to the telephone. When she came back she found\nAdelaide restored to her usual appearance–the fashionable,\nlight-hearted, beautiful woman, mistress of herself, and seeming as\nsecure against emotional violence from within as against discourtesy from\nwithout. But she showed how deep was the impression of Madelene’s\ncommon-sense analysis of her romance by saying: “A while ago you said\nthere were only three serious ills, disease and death, but you didn’t\nname the third. What is it?”",
        "“Dishonor,” said Madelene, with a long, steady look at her.",
        "Adelaide paled slightly, but met her sister-in-law’s level gaze. “Yes,\"\nwas all she said.",
        "A silence; then Madelene: “Your problem, Del, is simple; is no problem\nat all, so far as Dory or Ross’s wife is concerned; or the whole outside\nworld, for that matter. It’s purely personal; it’s altogether the\nproblem of bringing pain and shame on yourself. The others’ll get over\nit; but can you?”",
        "Del made no reply. A moment later Arthur came; after dinner she left\nbefore he did, and so was not alone with Madelene again. Reviewing her\namazing confessions to her sister-in-law, she was both sorry and not\nsorry. Her mind was undoubtedly relieved, but at the price of showing to\nanother her naked soul, and that other a woman–true, an unusual woman,\nby profession a confessor, but still a woman. Thenceforth some one other\nthan herself would know her as she really was–not at all the nice,\ndelicate lady with instincts as fine as those of the heroines of novels,\nwho, even at their most realistic, are pictured as fully and grandly\ndressed of soul in the solitude of bedroom as in crowded drawing-room. “I\ndon’t care!” concluded Adelaide. “If she, or anyone, thinks the worse of\nme for being a human being, it will show either hypocrisy or ignorance of\nhuman nature.”",
