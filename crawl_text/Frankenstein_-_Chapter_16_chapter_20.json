        "“Cursed, cursed creator!  Why did I live?  Why, in that instant, did I\nnot extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly\nbestowed?  I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my\nfeelings were those of rage and revenge.  I could with pleasure have\ndestroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with\ntheir shrieks and misery.",
        "“When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and\nnow, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my\nanguish in fearful howlings.  I was like a wild beast that had broken\nthe toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging\nthrough the wood with a staglike swiftness.  Oh!  What a miserable\nnight I passed!  The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees\nwaved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird\nburst forth amidst the universal stillness.  All, save I, were at rest\nor in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and\nfinding myself unsympathized with, wished to tear up the trees, spread\nhavoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed\nthe ruin.",
        "“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became\nfatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in\nthe sick impotence of despair.  There was none among the myriads of men\nthat existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness\ntowards my enemies?  No; from that moment I declared everlasting war\nagainst the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me\nand sent me forth to this insupportable misery.",
        "“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was\nimpossible to return to my retreat during that day.  Accordingly I hid\nmyself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours\nto reflection on my situation.",
        "“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some\ndegree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the\ncottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my\nconclusions.  I had certainly acted imprudently.  It was apparent that\nmy conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and  I was a\nfool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children.  I\nought to have familiarized the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to\nhave discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have\nbeen  prepared for my approach.  But I did not believe my errors to be\nirretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the\ncottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my\nparty.",
        "“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound\nsleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by\npeaceful dreams.  The horrible scene of the preceding day was forever\nacting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix\ntearing me from his father’s feet.  I awoke exhausted, and finding that\nit was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in\nsearch of food.",
        "“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-\nknown path that conducted to the cottage.  All there was at peace.  I\ncrept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the\naccustomed hour when the family arose.  That hour passed, the sun\nmounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear.  I\ntrembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune.  The inside\nof the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the\nagony of this suspense.",
        "“Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they\nentered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not\nunderstand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,\nwhich differed from that of my protectors.  Soon after, however, Felix\napproached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not\nquitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from\nhis discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.",
        "“`Do you consider,’ said his companion to him, `that you will be\nobliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose the produce of your\ngarden?  I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg\ntherefore that you will take some days to consider of your\ndetermination.’",
        "“`It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; `we can never again inhabit\nyour cottage.  The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing\nto the dreadful circumstance that I have related.  My wife and my\nsister will never recover from their horror.  I entreat you not to\nreason with me any more.  Take possession of your tenement and let me\nfly from this place.’",
        "“Felix trembled violently as he said this.  He and his companion\nentered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then\ndeparted.  I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.",
        "“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of\nutter and stupid despair.  My protectors had departed and had broken\nthe only link that held me to the world.  For the first time the\nfeelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to\ncontrol them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I\nbent my mind towards injury and death.  When I thought of my friends,\nof the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the\nexquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of\ntears somewhat soothed me.  But again when I reflected that they had\nspurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to\ninjure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects.  As\nnight advanced I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,\nand after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I\nwaited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\noperations.",
        "“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly\ndispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore\nalong like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my\nspirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection.  I lighted the\ndry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,\nmy eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon\nnearly touched.  A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my\nbrand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,\nand bushes, which I had collected.  The wind fanned the fire, and the\ncottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and\nlicked it with their forked and destroying tongues.",
        "“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of\nthe habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.",
        "“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?  I\nresolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated\nand despised, every country must be equally horrible.  At length the\nthought of you crossed my mind.  I learned from your papers that you\nwere my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness\nthan to him who had given me life?  Among the lessons that Felix had\nbestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from\nthese the relative situations of the different countries of the earth. \nYou had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards\nthis place I resolved to proceed.",
        "“But how was I to direct myself?  I knew that I must travel in a\nsouthwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my\nonly guide.  I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass\nthrough, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I\ndid not despair.  From you only could I hope for succour, although\ntowards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred.  Unfeeling,\nheartless creator!  You had endowed me with perceptions and passions\nand then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind. \nBut on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I\ndetermined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from\nany other being that wore the human form.",
        "“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense.  It was\nlate in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.\nI travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a\nhuman being.  Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;\nrain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface\nof the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter.  Oh,\nearth!  How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being!  The\nmildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall\nand bitterness.  The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more\ndeeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart.  Snow\nfell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not.  A few incidents\nnow and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I\noften wandered wide from my path.  The agony of my feelings allowed me\nno respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could\nnot extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived\non the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth\nand the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial\nmanner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.",
        "“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was\nsecured by night from the view of man.  One morning, however, finding\nthat my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey\nafter the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,\ncheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of\nthe air.  I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long\nappeared dead, revive within me.  Half surprised by the novelty of\nthese sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and\nforgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy.  Soft tears\nagain bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with\nthankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.",
        "“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its\nboundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many\nof the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring. \nHere I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard\nthe sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade\nof a cypress.  I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running\ntowards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from\nsomeone in sport.  She continued her course along the precipitous sides\nof the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the\nrapid stream.  I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,\nfrom the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore.  She\nwas senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore\nanimation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,\nwho was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled.  On\nseeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,\nhastened towards the deeper parts of the wood.  I followed speedily, I\nhardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,\nwhich he carried, at my body and fired.  I sank to the ground, and my\ninjurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.",
        "“This was then the reward of my benevolence!  I had saved a human being\nfrom destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable\npain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone.  The feelings of\nkindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments\nbefore gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.  Inflamed by\npain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.  But the\nagony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.",
        "“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to\ncure the wound which I had received.  The ball had entered my shoulder,\nand I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any\nrate I had no means of extracting it.  My sufferings were augmented\nalso by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their\ninfliction.  My daily vows rose for revenge–a deep and deadly\nrevenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I\nhad endured.",
        "“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey.  The\nlabours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or\ngentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my\ndesolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for\nthe enjoyment of pleasure.",
        "“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I\nreached the environs of Geneva.",
        "“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among\nthe fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply\nto you.  I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to\nenjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting\nbehind the stupendous mountains of Jura.",
        "“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,\nwhich was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came\nrunning into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of\ninfancy.  Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this\nlittle creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have\nimbibed a horror of deformity.  If, therefore, I could seize him and\neducate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in\nthis peopled earth.",
        "“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him\ntowards me.  As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before\nhis eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his\nface and said, `Child, what is the meaning of this?  I do not intend to\nhurt you; listen to me.’",
        "“He struggled violently.  `Let me go,’ he cried; `monster!  Ugly\nwretch!  You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces.  You are an ogre. \nLet me go, or I will tell my papa.’",
        "“`Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’",
        "“`Hideous monster!  Let me go.  My papa is a syndic–he is M.\nFrankenstein–he will punish you.  You dare not keep me.’",
        "“`Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy–to him towards whom I have\nsworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’",
        "“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried\ndespair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a\nmoment he lay dead at my feet.",
        "“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish\ntriumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, `I too can create desolation;\nmy enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and\na thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’",
        "“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his\nbreast.  I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman.  In spite\nof my malignity, it softened and attracted me.  For a few moments I\ngazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her\nlovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was\nforever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could\nbestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in\nregarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one\nexpressive of disgust and affright.",
        "“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?  I only\nwonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in\nexclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the\nattempt to destroy them.",
        "“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had\ncommitted the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I\nentered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty.  A woman was\nsleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her\nwhose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the\nloveliness of youth and health.  Here, I thought, is one of those whose\njoy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me.  And then I bent over\nher and whispered, `Awake, fairest, thy lover is near–he who would\ngive his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my\nbeloved, awake!’",
        "“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me.  Should she\nindeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus\nwould she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.\nThe thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me–not I, but\nshe, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am forever\nrobbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone.  The crime had\nits source in her; be hers the punishment!  Thanks to the lessons of\nFelix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work\nmischief.  I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of\nthe folds of her dress.  She moved again, and I fled.",
        "“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,\nsometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and\nits miseries forever.  At length I wandered towards these mountains,\nand have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning\npassion which you alone can gratify.  We may not part until you have\npromised to comply with my requisition.  I am alone and miserable; man\nwill not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself\nwould not deny herself to me.  My companion must be of the same species\nand have the same defects.  This being you must create.”",
