        "Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael: the three great names of the noblest\nperiod of the Renaissance take our minds from the host of fine artists\nwho worked alongside them. Nevertheless beside these giants a whole\nhost of exquisite artists have place, and not least among them the\nthree painters with whom Mr. Leader Scott has dealt in these pages. Fra\nBartolommeo linking up with the religious art of the preceding period,\nwith that of Masaccio, of Piero de Cosimo, his senior student in the\nstudio of Cosimo Roselli, and at last with that of the definitely\n“modern” painters of the Renaissance, Raphael, Leonardo and\nMichelangelo himself, is a transition painter in this supreme period.\nTechnique and the work of hand and brain are rapidly taking the place\nof inspiration and the desire to convey a message. The aesthetic\nsensation is becoming an end in itself. The scientific painters,\nperfecting their studies of anatomy and of perspective, having a\nconscious mastery over their tools and their mediums, are taking the\nplace of such men as Fra Angelico.",
        "As a painter at this end of a period of transition–a painter whose\nspiritual leanings would undoubtedly have been with the earlier men,\nbut whose period was too strong for him–Fra Bartolommeo is of\nparticular interest; and Albertinelli, for all the fiery surface\ndifference of his outlook is too closely bound by the ties of his\nfriendship for the Frate to have any other viewpoint.",
        "Andrea del Sarto presents yet another phenomenon: that of the artist\nendowed with all the powers of craftsmanship yet serving an end neither\nbasically spiritual nor basically aesthetic, but definitely\nprofessional. We have George Vasari’s word for it; and Vasari’s blame\nupon the extravagant and too-well-beloved Lucrezia. To-day we are so\naccustomed to the idea of the professional attitude to art that we can\naccept it in Andrea without concern. Not that other and earlier artists\nwere unconcerned with the aspect of payments. The history of Italian\nart is full of quarrels and bickerings about prices, the calling in of\nreferees to decide between patron and painter, demands and refusals of\npayment. Even the unworldly Fra Bartolommeo was the centre of such\nquarrels, and although his vow of poverty forbade him to receive money\nfor his work, the order to which he belonged stood out firmly for the\nscudi which the Frate’s pictures brought them. In justice to\nAndrea it must be added that this was not the only motive for his\nactivities; it was not without cause that the men of his time called\nhim “senza errori,” the faultless painter; and the production of\na vast quantity of his work rather than good prices for individual\npictures made his art pay to the extent it did. A pot-boiler in\nmasterpieces, his works have place in every gallery of importance, and\nhe himself stands very close to the three greatest; men of the\nRenaissance.",
        "Both Fra Bartolommeo and Albertinelli are little known in this country.\nPractically nothing has been written about them and very few of their\nworks are in either public galleries or private collections. It is in\nItaly, of course, that one must study their originals, although the\ngreat collections usually include one or two. Most interesting from the\nviewpoint of the study of art is the evolution of the work of the\nartist-monk as he came under the influence of the more dramatic modern\nand frankly sensational work of Raphael, of the Venetians and of\nMichelangelo. In this case (many will say in that of the art of the\nworld) this tendency detracted rather than helped the work. The\ndraperies, the dramatic poses, the artistic sensation arrests the mind\nat the surface of the picture. It is indeed strange that this devout\nchurchman should have succumbed to the temptation, and there are\nmoments when one suspects that his somewhat spectacular pietism\ndisguised the spirit of one whose mind had little to do with the\nmysticism of the mediaeval church. Or perhaps it was that the strange\nfriendship between him and Albertinelli, the man of the cloister and\nthe man of the world, effected some alchemy in the mind of each. The\nstory of that lifelong friendship, strong enough to overcome the\ndifficulties of a definite partnership between the strict life of the\nmonastery and the busy life of the bottega, is one of the most\nfascinating in art history.",
        "Mr. Leader Scott has in all three lives the opportunity for fascinating\nstudies, and his book presents them to us with much of the flavour of\nthe period in which they lived. Perhaps to-day we should incline to\nmodify his acceptance of the Vasari attitude to Lucrezia, especially\nsince he himself tends to withdraw the charges against her, but leaves\nher as the villainess of the piece upon very little evidence. The\ninclusion of a chapter upon Ghirlandajo, treated merely as a follower\nof Fra Bartolommeo, scarcely does justice in modern eyes to this fine\nartist, whose own day and generation did him such honour and paid him\nso well. But the author’s general conclusions as to the place in art\nand the significance of the lives of the three painters with whom he is\nchiefly concerned remains unchallenged, and we have in the volume a\nnecessary study to place alongside those of Leonardo, of Michelangelo\nand of Raphael for an understanding of the culmination of the\nRenaissance in Italy.",
