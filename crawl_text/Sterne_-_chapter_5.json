        "(1759-1760.)",
        "Hitherto we have had to construct our conception of Sterne out of\nmaterials of more or less plausible conjecture. We are now at last\napproaching the region of positive evidence, and henceforward, down\nalmost to the last scene of all, Sterne’s doings will be chronicled,\nand his character revealed, by one who happens, in this case, to be\nthe best of all possible biographers–the man himself. Not that such\nrecords are by any means always the most trustworthy of evidence.\nThere are some men whose real character is never more effectually\nconcealed than in their correspondence. But it is not so with Sterne.\nThe careless, slipshod letters which Madame de Medalle “pitchforked\"\ninto the book-market, rather than edited, are highly valuable as\npieces of autobiography. They are easy, naïve, and natural, rich in\nsimple self-disclosure in almost every page; and if they have more\nto tell us about the man than the writer, they are yet not wanting\nin instructive hints as to Sterne’s methods of composition and his\ntheories of art.",
        "It was in the year 1759 that the Vicar of Sutton and Prebendary of\nYork–already, no doubt, a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence\nto many worthy people in the county–conceived the idea of astonishing\nand scandalizing them still further after a new and original fashion.\nHis impulses to literary production were probably various, and not all\nof them, or perhaps the strongest of them, of the artistic order. The\nfirst and most urgent was, it may be suspected, the simplest and most\ncommon of all such motive forces. Sterne, in all likelihood, was in\nwant of money. He was not, perhaps, under the actual instruction of\nthat magister artium whom the Roman satirist has celebrated; for he\ndeclared, indeed, afterwards, that “he wrote not to be fed, but to be\nfamous.” But the context of the passage shows that he only meant to\ndeny any absolute compulsion to write for mere subsistence. Between\nthis sort of constraint and that gentler form of pressure which arises\nfrom the wish to increase an income sufficient for one’s needs, but\ninadequate to one’s desires, there is a considerable difference; and\nto repudiate the one is not to disclaim the other. It is, at any\nrate, certain that Sterne engaged at one time of his life in a rather\nspeculative sort of farming, and we have it from himself in a passage\nin one of his letters, which may be jest, but reads more like\nearnest, that it was his losses in this business that first turned his\nattention to literature.[1] His thoughts once set in that direction,\nhis peculiar choice of subject and method of treatment are easily\ncomprehensible. Pantagruelic burlesque came to him, if not naturally,\nat any rate by “second nature.” He had a strong and sedulously\ncultivated taste for Rabelaisian humour; his head was crammed with all\nsorts of out-of-the-way learning constantly tickling his comic sense\nby its very uselessness; he relished more keenly than any man the\nsolemn futilities of mediaeval doctors, and the pedantic indecencies\nof casuist fathers; and, along with all these temptations to an\nenterprise of the kind upon which he entered, he had been experiencing\na steady relaxation of deterrent restraints. He had fallen out with\nhis uncle some years since,[2] and the quarrel had freed him from at\nleast one influence making for clerical propriety of behaviour. His\nincorrigible levities had probably lost him the countenance of most of\nhis more serious acquaintances; his satirical humour had as probably\ngained him personal enemies not a few, and it may be that he had\ngradually contracted something of that “naughty-boy” temper, as we\nmay call it, for which the deliberate and ostentatious repetition of\noffences has an inexplicable charm. It seems clear, too, that, growth\nfor growth with this spirit of bravado, there had sprung up–in\nsomewhat incongruous companionship, perhaps–a certain sense of wrong.\nAlong with the impulse to give an additional shock to the prejudices\nhe had already offended, Sterne felt impelled to vindicate what he\nconsidered the genuine moral worth underlying the indiscretions of the\noffender. What, then, could better suit him than to compose a novel\nin which he might give full play to his simious humour, startle more\nhideously than ever his straighter-laced neighbours, defiantly defend\nhis own character, and caricature whatever eccentric figure in the\nsociety around him might offer the most tempting butt for ridicule?",
        "[Footnote 1: “I was once such a puppy myself,” he writes to a certain\nbaronet whom he is attempting to discourage from speculative farming\nof this sort, “and had my labour for my pains and two hundred pounds\nout of pocket. Curse on farming! (I said). Let us see if the pen will\nnot succeed better than the spade.\"]",
        "[Footnote 2: He himself, indeed, makes a particular point of this in\nexplaining his literary venture. “Now for your desire,” he writes to\na correspondent in 1759, “of knowing the reason of my turning author?\nwhy, truly I am tired of employing my brains for other people’s\nadvantage. ’Tis a foolish sacrifice I have made for some years for an\nungrateful person.\"–Letters, i. 82.]",
        "All the world knows how far he ultimately advanced beyond the\nsimplicity of the conception, and into what far higher regions of art\nits execution led him. But I find no convincing reason for believing\nthat Tristram Shandy had at the outset any more seriously artistic\npurpose than this; and much indirect evidence that this, in fact, it\nwas.",
        "The humorous figure of Mr. Shandy is, of course, the Cervantic centre\nof the whole; and it was out of him and his crotchets that Sterne,\nno doubt, intended from the first to draw the materials of that often\nunsavoury fun which was to amuse the light-minded and scandalize the\ndemure. But it can hardly escape notice that the two most elaborate\nportraits in Vol. I.–the admirable but very flatteringly idealized\nsketch of the author himself in Yorick, and the Gilrayesque caricature\nof Dr. Slop–are drawn with a distinctly polemical purpose, defensive\nin the former case and offensive in the latter. On the other hand,\nwith the disappearance of Dr. Slop caricature of living persons\ndisappears also; while, after the famous description of Yorick’s\ndeath-bed, we meet with no more attempts at self-vindication. It\nseems probable, therefore, that long before the first two volumes\nwere completed Sterne had discovered the artistic possibilities of\n“My Uncle Toby” and “Corporal Trim,” and had realized the full\npotentialities of humour contained in the contrast between the\ntwo brothers Shandy. The very work of sharpening and deepening the\noutlines of this humorous antithesis, while it made the crack-brained\nphilosopher more and more of a burlesque unreality, continually added\nnew touches of life and nature to the lineaments of the simple-minded\nsoldier; and it was by this curious and half-accidental process that\nthere came to be added to the gallery of English fiction one of the\nmost perfect and delightful portraits that it possesses.",
        "We know from internal evidence that Tristram Shandy was begun in the\nearly days of 1759; and the first two volumes were probably completed\nby about the middle of the year. “In the year 1760,” writes Sterne, “I\nwent up to London to publish my two first volumes of Shandy.” And it\nis stated in a note to this passage, as cited in Scott’s memoir, that\nthe first edition was published “the year before” in York. There is,\nhowever, no direct proof that it was in the hands of the public before\nthe beginning of 1760, though it is possible that the date of its\npublication may just have fallen within the year. But, at all\nevents, on the 1st of January, 1760, an advertisement in the Public\nAdvertiser informed the world that “this day” was “published, printed\non superfine writing-paper, &c., The Life and Opinions of Tristram\nShandy. York. Printed for and sold by John Hinxham, Bookseller in\nStonegate.” The great London publisher, Dodslecy, to whom the book\nhad been offered, and who had declined the venture, figures in the\nadvertisement as the principal London bookseller from whom it was\nto be obtained. It seems that only a few copies were in the first\ninstance sent up to the London market; but they fell into good hands,\nfor there is evidence that Tristram Shandy had attracted the notice\nof at least one competent critic in the capital before the month of\nJanuary was out. But though the metropolitan success of the book\nwas destined to be delayed for still a month or two, in York it had\nalready created a furore in more senses than one. For, in fact,\nand no wonder, it had in many quarters given the deepest offence. Its\nRabelaisian license of incident and allusion was calculated to offend\nthe proprieties–the provincial proprieties especially–even in that\nfree-spoken age; and there was that in the book, moreover, which a\nprovincial society may be counted on to abominate, with a keener\nif less disinterested abhorrence than any sins against decency. It\ncontained, or was supposed to contain, a broadly ludicrous caricature\nof one well-known local physician; and an allusion, brief, indeed, and\ncovert, but highly scandalous, to a certain “droll foible” attributed\nto another personage of much wider celebrity in the scientific\nworld. The victim in the latter case was no longer living; and this\ncircumstance brought upon Sterne a remonstrance from a correspondent,\nto which he replied in a letter so characteristic in many respects as\nto be worth quoting. His correspondent was a Dr. * * * * * (asterisks\nfor which it is now impossible to substitute letters); and the burden\nof what seem to have been several communications in speech and writing\non the subject was the maxim, “De mortuis nil nisi bonum.” With such\nseriousness and severity had his correspondent dwelt upon this adage,\nthat “at length,” writes Sterne, “you have made me as serious and as\nsevere as yourself; but, that the humours you have stirred up might\nnot work too potently within me, I have waited four days to cool\nmyself before I could set pen to paper to answer you.” And thus he\nsets forth the results of his four days’ deliberation:",
        "“’De mortuis nil nisi bonum.’ I declare I have considered the wisdom\nand foundation of it over and over again as dispassionately and\ncharitably as a good Christian can, and, after all, I can find nothing\nin it, or make more of it than a nonsensical lullaby of some nurse,\nput into Latin by some pedant, to be chanted by some hypocrite to the\nend of the world for the consolation of departing lechers. ’Tis, I\nown, Latin, and I think that is all the weight it has, for, in plain\nEnglish, ’tis a loose and futile position below a dispute. ’You are\nnot to speak anything of the dead but what is good.’ Why so? Who\nsays so? Neither reason nor Scripture. Inspired authors have done\notherwise, and reason and common sense tell me that, if the characters\nof past ages and men are to be drawn at all, they are to be drawn like\nthemselves, that is, with their excellences and their foibles; and it\nas much a piece of justice to the world, and to virtue, too, to do the\none as the other. The ruling passion, et les égarements du coeur,\nare the very things which mark and distinguish a man’s character,\nin which I would as soon leave out a man’s head as his hobby-horse.\nHowever, if, like the poor devil of a painter, we must conform to the\npious canon, ’De mortuis,’ &c., which I own has a spice of piety in\nthe sound of it, and be obliged to paint both our angels and our\ndevils out of the same pot, I then infer that our Sydenhams and our\nSangrados, our Lucretias and our Messalinas, our Somersets and our\nBolingbrokes, are alike entitled to statues, and all the historians or\nsatirists who have said otherwise since they departed this life,\nfrom Sallust to S––e, are guilty of the crimes you charge me with,\n’cowardice and injustice.’ But why cowardice? ’Because ’tis not\ncourage to attack a dead man who can’t defend himself.’ But why do you\ndoctors attack such a one with your incision knife? Oh! for the good\nof the living. ’Tis my plea.”",
        "And, having given this humorous twist to his argument, he glides off\ninto extenuatory matter. He had not even, he protests, made as much as\na surgical incision into his victim (Dr. Richard Mead, the friend of\nBentley and of Newton, and a physician and physiologist of high repute\nin his day); he had but just scratched him, and that scarce skin-deep.\nAs to the “droll foible” of Dr. Mead, which he had made merry with,\n“it was not first reported (even to the few who can understand the\nhint) by me, but known before by every chambermaid and footman within\nthe bills of mortality\"–a somewhat daring assertion, one would\nimagine, considering what the droll foible was; and Dr. Mead,\ncontinues Sterne, great man as he was, had, after all, not fared worse\nthan “a man of twice his wisdom\"–to wit Solomon, of whom the same\nremark had been made, that “they were both great men, and, like all\nmortal men, had each their ruling passion.”",
        "The mixture of banter and sound reasoning in this reply is, no doubt,\nvery skilful. But, unfortunately, neither the reasoning nor the\nbanter happens to meet the case of this particular defiance of the\n“De mortuis” maxim, and as a serious defence against a serious charge\n(which was what the occasion required) Sterne’s answer is altogether\nfutile. For the plea of “the good of the living,” upon which, after\nall, the whole defence, considered seriously, rests, was quite\ninapplicable as an excuse for the incriminated passage. The only\nliving persons who could possibly be affected by it, for good or\nevil, were those surviving friends of the dead man, to whom Sterne’s\nallusion to what he called Dr. Mead’s “droll foible” was calculated to\ncause the deepest pain and shame.",
        "The other matter of offence to Sterne’s Yorkshire readers was of a\nmuch more elaborate kind. In the person of Dr. Slop, the grotesque\nman-midwife, who was to have assisted, but missed assisting, at\nTristram’s entry into the world, the good people of York were not slow\nto recognize the physical peculiarities and professional antecedents\nof Dr. Burton, the local accoucheur, whom Archdeacon Sterne had\narrested as a Jacobite. That the portrait was faithful to anything\nbut the external traits of the original, or was intended to reproduce\nanything more than these, Sterne afterwards denied; and we have\ncertainly no ground for thinking that Burton had invited ridicule on\nany other than the somewhat unworthy ground of the curious ugliness\nof his face and figure. It is most unlikely that his success as a\npractitioner in a branch of the medical art in which imposture is the\nmost easily detected, could have been earned by mere quackery; and\nhe seems, moreover, to have been a man of learning in more kinds than\none. The probability is that the worst that could be alleged against\nhim was a tendency to scientific pedantry in his published\nwritings, which was pretty sure to tickle the fancy of Mr. Sterne.\nUnscrupulously, however, as he was caricatured, the sensation which\nappears to have been excited in the county by the burlesque portrait\ncould hardly have been due to any strong public sympathy with the\ninvoluntary sitter. Dr. Burton seems, as a suspected Jacobite, to have\nbeen no special favourite with the Yorkshire squirearchy in general,\nbut rather the reverse thereof. Ucalegon, however, does not need to be\npopular to arouse his neighbour’s interest in his misfortunes; and the\ncaricature of Burton was doubtless resented on the proximus ardetprinciple by many who feared that their turn was coming next.",
        "To all the complaints and protests which reached him on the subject\nSterne would in any case, probably, have been indifferent; but he was\nsoon to receive encouragement which would have more than repaid a\nman of his temper for twice the number of rebukes. For London cared\nnothing for Yorkshire susceptibilities and Yorkshire fears. Provincial\nnotables might be libelled, and their friends might go in fear\nof similar treatment, but all that was nothing to “the town,” and\nTristram Shandy had taken the town by storm. We gather from a\npassage in the letter above quoted that as early as January 30\nthe book had “gained the very favourable opinion” of Mr. Garrick,\nafterwards to become the author’s intimate friend; and it is certain\nthat by the time of Sterne’s arrival in London, in March, 1760,\nTristram Shandy had become the rage.",
        "To say of this extraordinary work that it defies analysis would be the\nmerest inadequacy of commonplace. It was meant to defy analysis; it\nis of the very essence of its scheme and purpose that it should do so;\nand the mere attempt to subject it systematically to any such process\nwould argue an altogether mistaken conception of the author’s intent.\nIts full “official\" style and title is The Life and Opinions of\nTristram Shandy, Gent., and it is difficult to say which it contains\nthe less about–the opinions of Tristram Shandy or the events of\nhis life. As a matter of fact, its proper description would be “The\nOpinions of Tristram Shandy’s Father, with some Passages from the Life\nof his Uncle.” Its claim to be regarded as a biography of its nominal\nhero is best illustrated by the fact that Tristram is not born till\nthe third volume, and not breeched till the sixth; that it is not till\nthe seventh that he begins to play any active part in the narrative,\nappearing then only as a completely colourless and unindividualized\nfigure, a mere vehicle for the conveyance of Sterne’s own Continental\nimpressions de voyage; and that in the last two volumes, which\nare entirely taken up with the incident of his uncle’s courtship, he\ndisappears from the story altogether. It is to be presumed, perhaps,\nthough not very confidently, that the reader would have seen more\nof him if the tale had been continued; but how much or how little\nis quite uncertain. The real hero of the book is at the outset Mr.\nShandy, senior, who is, later on, succeeded in this place of dignity\nby my Uncle Toby. It not only served Sterne’s purpose to confine\nhimself mainly to these two characters, as the best whereon to display\nhis powers, but it was part of his studied eccentricity to do so. It\nwas a “point” to give as little as possible about Tristram Shandy in\na life of Tristram Shandy; just as it was a point to keep the reader\nwaiting throughout the year 1760 for their hero to be so much as born.\nIn the first volume, therefore, the author does literally everything\nbut make the slightest progress with his story. Starting off abruptly\nwith a mock physiologic disquisition upon the importance of a\nproper ordering of their mental states on the part of the intending\nprogenitors of children, he philosophizes gravely on this theme for\ntwo or three chapters; and then wanders away into an account of the\nlocal midwife, upon whose sole services Mrs. Shandy, in opposition\nto her husband, was inclined to rely. From the midwife it is an easy\ntransition to her patron and protector, the incumbent of the parish,\nand this, in its turn, suggests a long excursus on the character,\nhabits, appearance, home, friends, enemies, and finally death, burial,\nand epitaph of the Rev. Mr. Yorick. Thence we return to Mr. and Mrs.\nShandy, and are made acquainted, in absurdly minute detail, with an\nagreement entered into between them with reference to the place of\nsojourn to be selected for the lady’s accouchement, the burlesque\ndeed which records this compact being actually set out at full length.\nThence, again, we are beckoned away by the jester to join him in\nelaborate and not very edifying ridicule of the Catholic doctrine\nof ante-natal baptism; and thence–but it would be useless to follow\nfurther the windings and doublings of this literary hare.",
        "Yet though the book, as one thus summarizes it, may appear a mere\nfarrago of digressions, it nevertheless, after its peculiar fashion,\nadvances. Such definite purpose as underlies the tricks and grimaces\nof its author is by degrees accomplished; and before we reach the end\nof the first volume the highly humorous, if extravagantly idealized,\nfigure of Mr. Shandy takes bodily shape and consistency before our\neyes. It is a mistake, I think, of Sir Walter Scott’s to regard the\nportrait of this eccentric philosopher as intended for a satire upon\nperverted and deranged erudition–as the study of a man “whom too much\nand too miscellaneous learning had brought within a step or two of\nmadness.” Sterne’s conception seems to me a little more subtle and\nless commonplace than that. Mr. Shandy, I imagine, is designed to\npersonify not “crack-brained learning” so much as “theory run mad.” He\nis possessed by a sort of Demon of the Deductive, ever impelling him\nto push his premises to new conclusions without ever allowing him time\nto compare them with the facts. No doubt we are meant to regard him as\na learned man; but his son gives us to understand distinctly and very\nearly in the book that his crotchets were by no means those of a weak\nreceptive mind, overladen with more knowledge than it could digest,\nbut rather those of an over-active intelligence, far more deeply and\nconstantly concerned with its own processes than with the thoughts\nof others. Tristram, indeed, dwells pointedly on the fact that his\nfather’s dialectical skill was not the result of training, and that he\nowed nothing to the logic of the schools. “He was certainly,” says his\nson, “irresistible both in his orations and disputations,” but\nthat was because “he was born an orator ([Greek: Theodidaktos]).\nPersuasion hung upon his lips, and the elements of logic and rhetoric\nwere so blended in him, and withal he had so shrewd a guess at the\nweaknesses and passions of his respondent, that Nature might have\nstood up and said, ’This man is eloquent.’ And yet,” continues the\nfilial panegyric,",
        "  “He had never read Cicero nor Quintilian de Oratore, nor Aristotle,\n  nor Longinus among the ancients, nor Vossius, nor Skioppius, nor\n  Ramus, nor Farnaby among the moderns: and what is more astonishing\n  he had never in his whole life the least light or spark of subtilty\n  struck into his mind by one single lecture upon Crackenthorpe or\n  Burgersdicius or any Dutch commentator: he knew not so much as\n  in what the difference of an argument ad ignorantiam and an argument\n  ad hominem consisted; and when he went up along with me to\n  enter my name at Jesus College, in * * * *, it was a matter of just\n  wonder with my worthy tutor and two or three Fellows of that learned\n  society that a man who knew not so much as the names of his tools\n  should be able to work after that fashion with them.”",
        "Surely we all know men of this kind, and the\nconsternation–comparable only to that of M. Jourdain under the\nimpromptu carte-and-tierce of his servant-maid–which their sturdy\nif informal dialectic will often spread among many kinds of “learned\nsocieties.” But such men are certainly not of the class which Scott\nsupposed to have been ridiculed in the character of Walter Shandy.",
        "Among the crotchets of this born dialectician was a theory as to the\nimportance of Christian names in determining the future behaviour\nand destiny of the children to whom they are given; and, whatever\nadmixture of jest there might have been in some of his other fancies,\nin this his son affirms he was absolutely serious. He solemnly\nmaintained the opinion “that there was a strange kind of magic bias\nwhich good or bad names, as he called them, irresistibly impressed\nupon our character and conduct.” How many Caesars and Pompeys, he\nwould say, by mere inspiration of their names have been rendered\nworthy of them! And how many, he would add, are there who might have\ndone exceeding well in the world had not their characters and spirits\nbeen totally depressed and Nicodemus’d into nothing! He was astonished\nat parents failing to perceive that “when once a vile name was\nwrongfully or injudiciously given, ’twas not like a case of a man’s\ncharacter, which, when wronged, might afterwards be cleared; and\npossibly some time or other, if not in the man’s life, at least after\nhis death, be somehow or other set to rights with the world.” This\nname-giving injury, he would say, “could never be undone; nay, he\ndoubted whether an Act of Parliament could reach it; he knew, as well\nas you, that the Legislature assumed a power over surnames; but for\nvery strong reasons, which he could give, it had never yet adventured,\nhe would say, to go a step further.”",
        "With all this extravagance, however, there was combined an admirable\naffectation of sobriety. Mr. Shandy would have us believe that he\nwas no blind slave to his theory. He was quite willing to admit the\nexistence of names which could not affect the character either\nfor good or evil–Jack, Dick, and Tom, for instance; and such the\nphilosopher styled “neutral names,” affirming of them, “without a\nsatire, that there had been as many knaves and fools at least as wise\nand good men since the world began, who had indifferently borne them,\nso that, like equal forces acting against each other in contrary\ndirections, he thought they mutually destroyed each other’s\neffects; for which reason he would often declare he would not give a\ncherry-stone to choose among them. Bob, which was my brother’s name,\nwas another of these neutral kinds of Christian names which operated\nvery little either way; and as my father happened to be at Epsom when\nit was given him, he would ofttimes thank Heaven it was no worse.\"\nForewarned of this peculiarity of Mr.",
        "Shandy’s, the reader is, of course, prepared to hear that of all\nthe names in the universe the philosopher had the most unconquerable\naversion for Tristram, “the lowest and most contemptible opinion of it\nof anything in the world.” He would break off in the midst of one\nof his frequent disputes on the subject of names, and “in a spirited\nepiphonema, or rather erotesis,” demand of his antagonist “whether he\nwould take upon him to say he had ever remembered, whether he had\never read, or whether he had ever heard tell of a man called Tristram\nperforming anything great or worth recording. No, he would say.\nTristram! the thing is impossible.” It only remained that he should\nhave published a book in defence of the belief, and sure enough “in\nthe year sixteen,” two years before the birth of his second son, “he\nwas at the pains of writing an express dissertation simply upon the\nword Tristram, showing the world with great candour and modesty the\ngrounds of his great abhorrence to the name.” And with this idea\nSterne continues to amuse himself at intervals till the end of the\nchapter.",
        "That he does not so persistently amuse the reader it is, of course,\nscarcely necessary to say. The jest has not substance enough–few of\nSterne’s jests have–to stand the process of continual attrition to\nwhich he subjects it. But the mere historic gravity with which the\nvarious turns of this monomania are recorded–to say nothing of the\nseldom failing charm of the easy, gossiping style–prevents the thing\nfrom ever becoming utterly tiresome. On the whole, however, one begins\nto grow impatient for more of the same sort as the three admirable\nchapters on the Rev. Mr. Yorick, and is not sorry to get to the\nopening of the second volume, with its half-tender, half-humorous, and\nwholly delightful account of Uncle Toby’s difficulties in describing\nthe siege operations before Namur, and of the happy chance by which\nthese difficulties made him ultimately the fortunate possessor of a\n“hobby.”",
        "Throughout this volume there are manifest signs of Sterne’s unceasing\ninterest in his own creations, and of his increasing consciousness of\ncreative power. Captain Toby Shandy is but just lightly sketched-in\nthe first volume, while Corporal Trim has not made his appearance on\nthe scene at all; but before the end of the second we know both of\nthem thoroughly, within and without. Indeed, one might almost say\nthat in the first half-dozen chapters which so excellently recount\nthe origin of the corporal’s fortification scheme, and the wounded\nofficer’s delighted acceptance of it, every trait in the simple\ncharacters–alike yet so different in their simplicity–of master and\nof man becomes definitely fixed in the reader’s mind. And the total\ndifference between the second and the first volume in point of\nfulness, variety, and colour is most marked. The artist, the inventor,\nthe master of dialogue, the comic dramatist, in fact, as distinct from\nthe humorous essayist, would almost seem to have started into being\nas we pass from the one volume to the other. There is nothing in the\ndrolleries of the first volume–in the broad jests upon Mr. Shandy’s\ncrotchets, or even in the subtler humour of the intellectual collision\nbetween these crotchets and his brother’s plain sense–to indicate the\nkind of power displayed in that remarkable colloquy à quatre, which\nbegins with the arrival of Dr. Slop and ends with Corporal Trim’s\nrecital of the Sermon on Conscience. Wit, humour, irony, quaint\nlearning, shrewd judgment of men and things, of these Sterne had\ndisplayed abundance already; but it is not in the earlier but in the\nlater half of the first instalment of Tristram Shandy that we first\nbecome conscious that he is something more than the possessor of all\nthese things; that he is gifted with the genius of creation, and has\nsent forth new beings into that world of immortal shadows which to\nmany of us is more real than our own.",
