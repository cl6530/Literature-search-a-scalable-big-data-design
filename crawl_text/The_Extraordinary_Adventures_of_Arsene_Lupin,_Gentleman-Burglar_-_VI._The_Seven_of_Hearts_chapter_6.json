        "I am frequently asked this question: “How did you make the\nacquaintance of Arsene Lupin?”",
        "My connection with Arsene Lupin was well known. The details that I\ngather concerning that mysterious man, the irrefutable facts that I\npresent, the new evidence that I produce, the interpretation that I\nplace on certain acts of which the public has seen only the\nexterior manifestations without being able to discover the secret\nreasons or the invisible mechanism, all establish, if not an\nintimacy, at least amicable relations and regular confidences.",
        "But how did I make his acquaintance? Why was I selected to be his\nhistoriographer? Why I, and not some one else?",
        "The answer is simple: chance alone presided over my choice; my\nmerit was not considered. It was chance that put me in his way.\nIt was by chance that I was participant in one of his strangest and\nmost mysterious adventures; and by chance that I was an actor in a\ndrama of which he was the marvelous stage director; an obscure and\nintricate drama, bristling with such thrilling events that I feel a\ncertain embarrassment in undertaking to describe it.",
        "The first act takes place during that memorable night of 22 June,\nof which so much has already been said. And, for my part, I\nattribute the anomalous conduct of which I was guilty on that\noccasion to the unusual from of mind in which I found myself on my\nreturn home. I had dined with some friends at the Cascade\nrestaurant, and, the entire evening, whilst we smoked and the\norchestra played melancholy waltzes, we talked only of crimes and\nthefts, and dark and frightful intrigues. That is always a poor\noverture to a night’s sleep.",
        "The Saint-Martins went away in an automobile. Jean Daspry--that\ndelightful, heedless Daspry who, six months later, was killed in\nsuch a tragic manner on the frontier of Morocco--Jean Daspry and I\nreturned on foot through the dark, warm night. When we arrived in\nfront of the little house in which I had lived for a year at\nNeuilly, on the boulevard Maillot, he said to me:",
        "“Are you afraid?”",
        "“What an idea!”",
        "“But this house is so isolated....no neighbors....vacant\nlots....Really, I am not a coward, and yet---”",
        "“Well, you are very cheering, I must say.”",
        "“Oh! I say that as I would say anything else. The Saint-Martins\nhave impressed me with their stories of brigands and thieves.”",
        "We shook hands and said good-night. I took out my key and opened\nthe door.",
        "“Well, that is good,” I murmured, “Antoine has forgotten to light a\ncandle.”",
        "Then I recalled the fact that Antoine was away; I had given him a\nshort leave of absence. Forthwith, I was disagreeably oppressed by\nthe darkness and silence of the night. I ascended the stairs on\ntiptoe, and reached my room as quickly as possible; then, contrary\nto my usual habit, I turned the key and pushed the bolt.",
        "The light of my candle restored my courage. Yet I was careful to\ntake my revolver from its case--a large, powerful weapon--and place\nit beside my bed. That precaution completed my reassurance. I\nlaid down and, as usual, took a book from my night-table to read\nmyself to sleep. Then I received a great surprise. Instead of the\npaper-knife with which I had marked my place on the preceding, I\nfound an envelope, closed with five seals of red wax. I seized it\neagerly. It was addressed to me, and marked: “Urgent.”",
        "A letter! A letter addressed to me! Who could have put it in that\nplace? Nervously, I tore open the envelope, and read:",
        "“From the moment you open this letter, whatever happens, whatever\nyou may hear, do not move, do not utter one cry. Otherwise you are\ndoomed.”",
        "I am not a coward, and, quite as well as another, I can face real\ndanger, or smile at the visionary perils of imagination. But, let\nme repeat, I was in an anomalous condition of mind, with my nerves\nset on edge by the events of the evening. Besides, was there not,\nin my present situation, something startling and mysterious,\ncalculated to disturb the most courageous spirit?",
        "My feverish fingers clutched the sheet of paper, and I read and re-\nread those threatening words: “Do not move, do not utter one cry.\nOtherwise, you are doomed.”",
        "“Nonsense!” I thought. “It is a joke; the work of some cheerful\nidiot.”",
        "I was about to laugh--a good loud laugh. Who prevented me? What\nhaunting fear compressed my throat?",
        "At least, I would blow out the candle. No, I could not do it. “Do\nnot move, or you are doomed,” were the words he had written.",
        "These auto-suggestions are frequently more imperious than the most\npositive realities; but why should I struggle against them? I had\nsimply to close my eyes. I did so.",
        "At that moment, I heard a slight noise, followed by crackling\nsounds, proceeding from a large room used by me as a library. A\nsmall room or antechamber was situated between the library and my\nbedchamber.",
        "The approach of an actual danger greatly excited me, and I felt a\ndesire to get up, seize my revolver, and rush into the library. I\ndid not rise; I saw one of the curtains of the left window move.\nThere was no doubt about it: the curtain had moved. It was still\nmoving. And I saw--oh! I saw quite distinctly--in the narrow space\nbetween the curtains and the window, a human form; a bulky mass\nthat prevented the curtains from hanging straight. And it is\nequally certain that the man saw me through the large meshes of the\ncurtain. Then, I understood the situation. His mission was to\nguard me while the others carried away their booty. Should I rise\nand seize my revolver? Impossible! He was there! At the least\nmovement, at the least cry, I was doomed.",
        "Then came a terrific noise that shook the house; this was followed\nby lighter sounds, two or three together, like those of a hammer\nthat rebounded. At least, that was the impression formed in my\nconfused brain. These were mingled with other sounds, thus\ncreating a veritable uproar which proved that the intruders were\nnot only bold, but felt themselves secure from interruption.",
        "They were right. I did not move. Was it cowardice? No, rather\nweakness, a total inability to move any portion of my body,\ncombined with discretion; for why should I struggle? Behind that\nman, there were ten others who would come to his assistance.\nShould I risk my life to save a few tapestries and bibelots?",
        "Throughout the night, my torture endured. Insufferable torture,\nterrible anguish! The noises had stopped, but I was in constant\nfear of their renewal. And the man! The man who was guarding me,\nweapon in hand. My fearful eyes remained cast in his direction.\nAnd my heart beat! And a profuse perspiration oozed from every\npore of my body!",
        "Suddenly, I experienced an immense relief; a milk-wagon, whose\nsound was familiar to me, passed along the boulevard; and, at the\nsame time, I had an impression that the light of a new day was\ntrying to steal through the closed window-blinds.",
        "At last, daylight penetrated the room; other vehicles passed along\nthe boulevard; and all the phantoms of the night vanished. Then I\nput one arm out of the bed, slowly and cautiously. My eyes were\nfixed upon the curtain, locating the exact spot at which I must\nfire; I made an exact calculation of the movements I must make;\nthen, quickly, I seized my revolver and fired.",
        "I leaped from my bed with a cry of deliverance, and rushed to the\nwindow. The bullet had passed through the curtain and the window-\nglass, but it had not touched the man--for the very good reason that\nthere was none there. Nobody! Thus, during the entire night, I\nhad been hypnotized by a fold of the curtain. And, during that\ntime, the malefactors....Furiously, with an enthusiasm that nothing\ncould have stopped, I turned the key, opened the door, crossed the\nantechamber, opened another door, and rushed into the library. But\namazement stopped me on the threshold, panting, astounded, more\nastonished than I had been by the absence of the man. All the\nthings that I supposed had been stolen, furniture, books, pictures,\nold tapestries, everything was in its proper place.",
        "It was incredible. I could not believe my eyes. Notwithstanding\nthat uproar, those noises of removal....I made a tour, I inspected\nthe walls, I made a mental inventory of all the familiar objects.\nNothing was missing. And, what was more disconcerting, there was\nno clue to the intruders, not a sign, not a chair disturbed, not\nthe trace of a footstep.",
        "“Well! Well!” I said to myself, pressing my hands on my bewildered\nhead, “surely I am not crazy! I hear something!”",
        "Inch by inch, I made a careful examination of the room. It was in\nvain. Unless I could consider this as a discovery: Under a small\nPersian rug, I found a card--an ordinary playing card. It was the\nseven of hearts; it was like any other seven of hearts in French\nplaying-cards, with this slight but curious exception: The extreme\npoint of each of the seven red spots or hearts was pierced by a\nhole, round and regular as if made with the point of an awl.",
        "Nothing more. A card and a letter found in a book. But was not\nthat sufficient to affirm that I had not been the plaything of a\ndream?",
        "Throughout the day, I continued my searches in the library. It was\na large room, much too large for the requirements of such a house,\nand the decoration of which attested the bizarre taste of its\nfounder. The floor was a mosaic of multicolored stones, formed\ninto large symmetrical designs. The walls were covered with a\nsimilar mosaic, arranged in panels, Pompeiian allegories, Byzantine\ncompositions, frescoes of the Middle Ages. A Bacchus bestriding a\ncask. An emperor wearing a gold crown, a flowing beard, and\nholding a sword in his right hand.",
        "Quite high, after the style of an artist’s studio, there was a\nlarge window--the only one in the room. That window being always\nopen at night, it was probable that the men had entered through it,\nby the aid of a ladder. But, again, there was no evidence. The\nbottom of the ladder would have left some marks in the soft earth\nbeneath the window; but there were none. Nor were there any traces\nof footsteps in any part of the yard.",
        "I had no idea of informing the police, because the facts I had\nbefore me were so absurd and inconsistent. They would laugh at me.\nHowever, as I was then a reported on the staff of the `Gil Blas,’ I\nwrote a lengthy account of my adventure and it was published in the\npaper on the second day thereafter. The article attracted some\nattention, but no one took it seriously. They regarded it as a\nwork of fiction rather than a story of real life. The Saint-\nMartins rallied me. But Daspry, who took an interest in such\nmatters, came to see me, made a study of the affair, but reached no\nconclusion.",
        "A few mornings later, the door-bell rang, and Antoine came to\ninform me that a gentleman desired to see me. He would not give\nhis name. I directed Antoine to show him up. He was a man of\nabout forty years of age with a very dark complexion, lively\nfeatures, and whose correct dress, slightly frayed, proclaimed a\ntaste that contrasted strangely with his rather vulgar manners.\nWithout any preamble, he said to me--in a rough voice that confirmed\nmy suspicion as to his social position:",
        "“Monsieur, whilst in a cafe, I picked up a copy of the `Gil Blas,’\nand read your article. It interested me very much.",
        "“Thank you.”",
        "“And here I am.”",
        "“Ah!”",
        "“Yes, to talk to you. Are all the facts related by you quite\ncorrect?”",
        "“Absolutely so.”",
        "“Well, in that case, I can, perhaps, give you some information.”",
        "“Very well; proceed.”",
        "“No, not yet. First, I must be sure that the facts are exactly as\nyou have related them.”",
        "“I have given you my word. What further proof do you want?”",
        "“I must remain alone in this room.”",
        "“I do not understand,” I said, with surprise.",
        "“It’s an idea that occurred to me when reading your article.\nCertain details established an extraordinary coincidence with\nanother case that came under my notice. If I am mistaken, I shall\nsay nothing more. And the only means of ascertaining the truth is\nby my remaining in the room alone.”",
        "What was at the bottom of this proposition? Later, I recalled that\nthe man was exceedingly nervous; but, at the same time, although\nsomewhat astonished, I found nothing particularly abnormal about\nthe man or the request he had made. Moreover, my curiosity was\naroused; so I replied:",
        "“Very well. How much time do you require?”",
        "“Oh! three minutes--not longer. Three minutes, from now, I will\nrejoin you.”",
        "I left the room, and went downstairs. I took out my watch. One\nminute passed. Two minutes. Why did I feel so depressed? Why did\nthose moments seem so solemn and weird? Two minutes and a\nhalf....Two minutes and three quarters. Then I heard a pistol\nshot.",
        "I bounded up the stairs and entered the room. A cry of horror\nescaped me. In the middle of the room, the man was lying on his\nleft side, motionless. Blood was flowing from a wound in his\nforehead. Near his hand was a revolver, still smoking.",
        "But, in addition to this frightful spectacle, my attention was\nattracted by another object. At two feet from the body, upon the\nfloor, I saw a playing-card. It was the seven of hearts. I picked\nit up. The lower extremity of each of the seven spots was pierced\nwith a small round hole.",
        "A half-hour later, the commissary of police arrived, then the\ncoroner and the chief of the Surete, Mon. Dudouis. I had been\ncareful not to touch the corpse. The preliminary inquiry was very\nbrief, and disclosed nothing. There were no papers in the pockets\nof the deceased; no name upon his clothes; no initial upon his\nlinen; nothing to give any clue to his identity. The room was in\nthe same perfect order as before. The furniture had not been\ndisturbed. Yet this man had not come to my house solely for the\npurpose of killing himself, or because he considered my place the\nmost convenient one for his suicide! There must have been a motive\nfor his act of despair, and that motive was, no doubt, the result\nof some new fact ascertained by him during the three minutes he was\nalone.",
        "What was that fact? What had he seen? What frightful secret had\nbeen revealed to him? There was no answer to these questions.\nBut, at the last moment, an incident occurred that appeared to us\nof considerable importance. As two policemen were raising the body\nto place it on a stretcher, the left hand thus being disturbed, a\ncrumpled card fell from it. The card bore these words: “Georges\nAndermatt, 37 Rue de Berry.”",
        "What did that mean? Georges Andermatt was a rich banker in Paris,\nthe founder and president of the Metal Exchange which had given\nsuch an impulse to the metallic industries in France. He lived in\nprincely style; was the possessor of numerous automobiles, coaches,\nand an expensive racing-stable. His social affairs were very\nselect, and Madame Andermatt was noted for her grace and beauty.",
        "“Can that be the man’s name?” I asked.",
        "---------------",
        "The chief of the Surete leaned over him.",
        "“It is not he. Mon. Andermatt is a thin man, and slightly grey.”",
        "“But why this card?”",
        "“Have you a telephone, monsieur?”",
        "“Yes, in the vestibule. Come with me.”",
        "He looked in the directory, and then asked for number 415.21.",
        "“Is Mon. Andermatt at home?....Please tell him that Mon. Dudouis\nwished him to come at once to 102 Boulevard Maillot. Very\nimportant.”",
        "Twenty minutes later, Mon. Andermatt arrived in his automobile.\nAfter the circumstances had been explained to him, he was taken in\nto see the corpse. He displayed considerable emotion, and spoke,\nin a low tone, and apparently unwillingly:",
        "“Etienne Varin,” he said.",
        "“You know him?”",
        "“No....or, at least, yes....by sight only. His brother....”",
        "“Ah! he has a brother?”",
        "“Yes, Alfred Varin. He came to see me once on some matter of\nbusiness....I forget what it was.”",
        "“Where does he live?”",
        "“The two brothers live together--rue de Provence, I think.”",
        "“Do you know any reason why he should commit suicide?”",
        "“None.”",
        "“He held a card in his hand. It was your card with your address.”",
        "“I do not understand that. It must have been there by some chance\nthat will be disclosed by the investigation.”",
        "A very strange chance, I thought; and I felt that the others\nentertained the same impression.",
        "I discovered the same impression in the papers next day, and\namongst all my friends with whom I discussed the affair. Amid the\nmysteries that enveloped it, after the double discovery of the\nseven of hearts pierced with seven holes, after the two inscrutable\nevents that had happened in my house, that visiting card promised\nto throw some light on the affair. Through it, the truth may be\nrevealed. But, contrary to our expectations, Mon. Andermatt\nfurnished no explanation. He said:",
        "“I have told you all I know. What more can I do? I am greatly\nsurprised that my card should be found in such a place, and I\nsincerely hope the point will be cleared up.”",
        "It was not. The official investigation established that the Varin\nbrothers were of Swiss origin, had led a shifting life under\nvarious names, frequenting gambling resorts, associating with a\nband of foreigners who had been dispersed by the police after a\nseries of robberies in which their participation was established\nonly by their flight. At number 24 rue de Provence, where the\nVarin brothers had lived six years before, no one knew what had\nbecome of them.",
        "I confess that, for my part, the case seemed to me so complicated\nand so mysterious that I did not think the problem would ever be\nsolved, so I concluded to waste no more time upon it. But Jean\nDaspry, whom I frequently met at that period, became more and more\ninterested in it each day. It was he who pointed out to me that\nitem from a foreign newspaper which was reproduced and commented\nupon by the entire press. It was as follows:",
        "“The first trial of a new model of submarine boat, which is\nexpected to revolutionize naval warfare, will be given in presence\nof the former Emperor at a place that will be kept secret until the\nlast minute. An indiscretion has revealed its name; it is called\n`The Seven-of-Hearts.’”",
        "The Seven-of-Hearts! That presented a new problem. Could a\nconnection be established between the name of the sub-marine and\nthe incidents which we have related? But a connection of what\nnature? What had happened here could have no possible relation\nwith the sub-marine.",
        "“What do you know about it?” said Daspry to me. “The most diverse\neffects often proceed from the same cause.”",
        "Two days later, the following foreign news item was received and\npublished:",
        "“It is said that the plans of the new sub-marine `Seven-of-Hearts’\nwere prepared by French engineers, who, having sought, in vain, the\nsupport of their compatriots, subsequently entered into\nnegotiations with the British Admiralty, without success.”",
        "I do not wish to give undue publicity to certain delicate matters\nwhich once provoked considerable excitement. Yet, since all danger\nof injury therefrom has now come to an end, I must speak of the\narticle that appeared in the `Echo de France,’ which aroused so\nmuch comment at that time, and which threw considerable light upon\nthe mystery of the Seven-of-Hearts. This is the article as it was\npublished over the signature of Salvator:",
        " “THE AFFAIR OF THE SEVEN-OF-HEARTS.",
        " “A CORNER OF THE VEIL RAISED.",
        " “We will be brief. Ten years ago, a young mining engineer, Louis\n Lacombe, wishing to devote his time and fortune to certain studies,\n resigned his position he then held, and rented number 102 boulevard\n Maillot, a small house that had been recently built and decorated\n for an Italian count. Through the agency of the Varin brothers of\n Lausanne, one of whom assisted in the preliminary experiments and\n the other acted as financial agent, the young engineer was\n introduced to Georges Andermatt, the founder of the Metal Exchange.",
        " “After several interviews, he succeeded in interesting the banker\n in a sub-marine boat on which he was working, and it was agreed\n that as soon as the invention was perfected, Mon. Andermatt would\n use his influence with the Minister of Marine to obtain a series of\n trials under the direction of the government. For two years, Louis\n Lacombe was a frequent visitor at Andermatt’s house, and he\n submitted to the banker the various improvements he made upon his\n original plans, until one day, being satisfied with the perfection\n of his work, he asked Mon. Andermatt to communicate with the\n Minister of Marine. That day, Louis Lacombe dined at Mon.\n Andermatt’s house. He left there about half-past eleven at night.\n He has not been seen since.",
        " “A perusal of the newspapers of that date will show that the\n young man’s family caused every possible inquiry to be made, but\n without success; and it was the general opinion that Louis Lacombe--\n who was known as an original and visionary youth--had quietly left\n for parts unknown.",
        " “Let us accept that theory--improbable, though it be,--and let us\n consider another question, which is a most important one for our\n country: What has become of the plans of the sub-marine? Did Louis\n Lacombe carry them away? Are they destroyed?",
        " “After making a thorough investigation, we are able to assert,\n positively, that the plans are in existence, and are now in the\n possession of the two brothers Varin. How did they acquire such a\n possession? That is a question not yet determined; nor do we know\n why they have not tried to sell them at an earlier date. Did they\n fear that their title to them would be called in question? If so,\n they have lost that fear, and we can announce definitely, that the\n plans of Louis Lacombe are now the property of foreign power, and\n we are in a position to publish the correspondence that passed\n between the Varin brothers and the representative of that power.\n The `Seven-of-Hearts’ invented by Louis Lacombe has been actually\n constructed by our neighbor.",
        " “Will the invention fulfill the optimistic expectations of those\n who were concerned in that treacherous act?”",
        "And a post-script adds:",
        " “Later.--Our special correspondent informs us that the preliminary\n trial of the `Seven-of-Hearts’ has not been satisfactory. It is\n quite likely that the plans sold and delivered by the Varin\n brothers did not include the final document carried by Louis\n Lacombe to Mon. Andermatt on the day of his disappearance, a\n document that was indispensable to a thorough understanding of the\n invention. It contained a summary of the final conclusions of the\n inventor, and estimates and figures not contained in the other\n papers. Without this document, the plans are incomplete; one the\n other hand, without the plans, the document is worthless.",
        " “Now is the time to act and recover what belongs to us. It may\n be a difficult matter, but we rely upon the assistance of Mon.\n Andermatt. It will be to his interest to explain his conduct which\n has hitherto been so strange and inscrutable. He will explain not\n only why he concealed these facts at the time of the suicide of\n Etienne Varin, but also why he has never revealed the disappearance\n of the paper--a fact well known to him. He will tell why, during\n the last six years, he paid spies to watch the movements of the\n Varin brothers. We expect from him, not only words, but acts. And\n at once. Otherwise---”",
        "The threat was plainly expressed. But of what did it consist?\nWhat whip was Salvator, the anonymous writer of the article,\nholding over the head of Mon. Andermatt?",
        "An army of reporters attacked the banker, and ten interviewers\nannounced the scornful manner in which they were treated.\nThereupon, the `Echo de France’ announced its position in these\nwords:",
        "“Whether Mon. Andermatt is willing or not, he will be, henceforth,\nour collaborator in the work we have undertaken.”",
        "Daspry and I were dining together on the day on which that\nannouncement appeared. That evening, with the newspapers spread\nover my table, we discussed the affair and examined it from every\npoint of view with that exasperation that a person feels when\nwalking in the dark and finding himself constantly falling over the\nsame obstacles. Suddenly, without any warning whatsoever, the door\nopened and a lady entered. Her face was hidden behind a think\nveil. I rose at once and approached her.",
        "“Is it you, monsieur, who lives here?” she asked.",
        "“Yes, madame, but I do not understand---”",
        "“The gate was not locked,” she explained.",
        "“But the vestibule door?”",
        "She did not reply, and it occurred to me that she had used the\nservants’ entrance. How did she know the way? Then there was a\nsilence that was quite embarrassing. She looked at Daspry, and I\nwas obliged to introduce him. I asked her to be seated and explain\nthe object of her visit. She raised her veil, and I saw that she\nwas a brunette with regular features and, though not handsome, she\nwas attractive--principally, on account of her sad, dark eyes.",
        "“I am Madame Andermatt,” she said.",
        "“Madame Andermatt!” I repeated, with astonishment.",
        "After a brief pause, she continued with a voice and manner that\nwere quite easy and natural:",
        "“I have come to see you about that affair--you know. I thought I\nmight be able to obtain some information---”",
        "“Mon Dieu, madame, I know nothing but what has already appeared in\nthe papers. But if you will point out in what way I can help you. ...”",
        "“I do not know....I do not know.”",
        "Not until then did I suspect that her calm demeanor was assumed,\nand that some poignant grief was concealed beneath that air of\ntranquility. For a moment, we were silent and embarrassed. Then\nDaspry stepped forward, and said:",
        "“Will you permit me to ask you a few questions?”",
        "“Yes, yes,” she cried. “I will answer.”",
        "“You will answer....whatever those questions may be?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Did you know Louis Lacombe?” he asked.",
        "“Yes, through my husband.”",
        "“When did you see him for the last time?”",
        "“The evening he dined with us.”",
        "“At that time, was there anything to lead you to believe that you\nwould never see him again?”",
        "“No. But he had spoken of a trip to Russia--in a vague way.”",
        "“Then you expected to see him again?”",
        "“Yes. He was to dine with us, two days later.”",
        "“How do you explain his disappearance?”",
        "“I cannot explain it.”",
        "“And Mon. Andermatt?”",
        "“I do not know.”",
        "“Yet the article published in the `Echo de France’ indicates---”",
        "“Yes, that the Varin brothers had something to do with his\ndisappearance.”",
        "“Is that your opinion?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“On what do you base your opinion?”",
        "“When he left our house, Louis Lacombe carried a satchel containing\nall the papers relating to his invention. Two days later, my\nhusband, in a conversation with one of the Varin brothers, learned\nthat the papers were in their possession.”",
        "“And he did not denounce them?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Why not?”",
        "“Because there was something else in the satchel--something besides\nthe papers of Louis Lacombe.”",
        "“What was it?”",
        "She hesitated; was on the point of speaking, but, finally, remained\nsilent. Daspry continued:",
        "“I presume that is why your husband has kept a close watch over\ntheir movements instead of informing the police. He hoped to\nrecover the papers and, at the same time, that compromising article\nwhich has enabled the two brothers to hold over him threats of\nexposure and blackmail.”",
        "“Over him, and over me.”",
        "“Ah! over you, also?”",
        "“Over me, in particular.”",
        "She uttered the last words in a hollow voice. Daspry observed it;\nhe paced to and fro for a moment, then, turning to her, asked:",
        "“Had you written to Louis Lacombe?”",
        "“Of course. My husband had business with him--”",
        "“Apart from those business letters, had you written to Louis\nLacombe....other letters? Excuse my insistence, but it is\nabsolutely necessary that I should know the truth. Did you write\nother letters?”",
        "“Yes,” she replied, blushing.",
        "“And those letters came into the possession of the Varin brothers?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Does Mon. Andermatt know it?”",
        "“He has not seen them, but Alfred Varin has told him of their\nexistence and threatened to publish them if my husband should take\nany steps against him. My husband was afraid....of a scandal.”",
        "“But he has tried to recover the letters?”",
        "“I think so; but I do not know. You see, after that last interview\nwith Alfred Varin, and after some harsh words between me and my\nhusband in which he called me to account--we live as strangers.”",
        "“In that case, as you have nothing to lose, what do you fear?”",
        "“I may be indifferent to him now, but I am the woman that he has\nloved, the one he would still love--oh! I am quite sure of that,\"\nshe murmured, in a fervent voice, “he would still love me if he had\nnot got hold of those cursed letters----”",
        "“What! Did he succeed?....But the two brothers still defied\nhim?”",
        "“Yes, and they boasted of having a secure hiding-place.”",
        "“Well?”",
        "“I believe my husband discovered that hiding-place.”",
        "“Well?”",
        "“I believe my husband has discovered that hiding-place.”",
        "“Ah! where was it?”",
        "“Here.”",
        "“Here!” I cried in alarm.",
        "“Yes. I always had that suspicion. Louis Lacombe was very\ningenious and amused himself in his leisure hours, by making safes\nand locks. No doubt, the Varin brothers were aware of that fact\nand utilized one of Lacombe’s safes in which to conceal the\nletters....and other things, perhaps.”",
        "“But they did not live here,” I said.",
        "“Before you came, four months ago, the house had been vacant for\nsome time. And they may have thought that your presence here would\nnot interfere with them when they wanted to get the papers. But\nthey did not count on my husband, who came here on the night of 22\nJune, forced the safe, took what he was seeking, and left his card\nto inform the two brothers that he feared them no more, and that\ntheir positions were now reversed. Two days later, after reading\nthe article in the `Gil Blas,’ Etienne Varin came here, remained\nalone in this room, found the safe empty, and....killed\nhimself.”",
        "After a moment, Daspry said:",
        "“A very simple theory....Has Mon. Andermatt spoken to you since\nthen?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Has his attitude toward you changed in any way? Does he appear\nmore gloomy, more anxious?”",
        "“No, I haven’t noticed any change.”",
        "“And yet you think he has secured the letters. Now, in my opinion,\nhe has not got those letters, and it was not he who came here on\nthe night of 22 June.”",
        "“Who was it, then?”",
        "“The mysterious individual who is managing this affair, who holds\nall the threads in his hands, and whose invisible but far-reaching\npower we have felt from the beginning. It was he and his friends\nwho entered this house on 22 June; it was he who discovered the\nhiding-place of the papers; it was he who left Mon. Andermatt’s\ncard; it is he who now holds the correspondence and the evidence of\nthe treachery of the Varin brothers.”",
        "“Who is he?” I asked, impatiently.",
        "“The man who writes letters to the `Echo de France’....\nSalvator! Have not convincing evidence of that fact? Does he not\nmention in his letters certain details that no one could know,\nexcept the man who had thus discovered the secrets of the two\nbrothers?”",
        "“Well, then,” stammered Madame Andermatt, in great alarm, “he has\nmy letters also, and it is he who now threatens my husband. Mon\nDieu! What am I to do?”",
        "“Write to him,” declared Daspry. “Confide in him without reserve.\nTell him all you know and all you may hereafter learn. Your\ninterest and his interest are the same. He is not working against\nMon. Andermatt, but against Alfred Varin. Help him.”",
        "“How?”",
        "“Has your husband the document that completes the plans of Louis\nLacombe?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Tell that to Salvator, and, if possible, procure the document for\nhim. Write to him at once. You risk nothing.”",
        "The advice was bold, dangerous even at first sight, but Madame\nAndermatt had no choice. Besides, as Daspry had said, she ran no\nrisk. If the unknown writer were an enemy, that step would not\naggravate the situation. If he were a stranger seeking to\naccomplish a particular purpose, he would attach to those letters\nonly a secondary importance. Whatever might happen, it was the\nonly solution offered to her, and she, in her anxiety, was only too\nglad to act on it. She thanked us effusively, and promised to keep\nus informed.",
        "In fact, two days later, she sent us the following letter that she\nhad received from Salvator:",
        "“Have not found the letter, but I will get them. Rest easy. I am\nwatching everything. S.”",
        "I looked at the letter. It was in the same handwriting as the note\nI found in my book on the night of 22 June.",
        "Daspry was right. Salvator was, indeed, the originator of that\naffair.",
        "We were beginning to see a little light coming out of the darkness\nthat surrounded us, and an unexpected light was thrown on certain\npoints; but other points yet remained obscure--for instance, the\nfinding of the two seven-of-hearts. Perhaps I was unnecessarily\nconcerned about those two cards whose seven punctured spots had\nappeared to me under such startling circumstances! Yet I could not\nrefrain from asking myself: What role will they play in the drama?\nWhat importance do they bear? What conclusion must be drawn from\nthe fact that the submarine constructed from the plans of Louis\nLacombe bore the name of `Seven-of-Hearts’?",
        "Daspry gave little thought to the other two cards; he devoted all\nhis attention to another problem which he considered more urgent;\nhe was seeking the famous hiding-place.",
        "“And who know,” said he, “I may find the letters that Salvator did\nnot find--by inadvertence, perhaps. It is improbable that the Varin\nbrothers would have removed from a spot, which they deemed\ninaccessible, the weapon which was so valuable to them.”",
        "And he continued to search. In a short time, the large room held\nno more secrets for him, so he extended his investigations to the\nother rooms. He examined the interior and the exterior, the stones\nof the foundation, the bricks in the walls; he raised the slates of\nthe roof.",
        "One day, he came with a pickaxe and a spade, gave me the spade,\nkept the pickaxe, pointed to the adjacent vacant lots, and said:\n“Come.”",
        "I followed him, but I lacked his enthusiasm. He divided the vacant\nland into several sections which he examined in turn. At last, in\na corner, at the angle formed by the walls of two neighboring\nproprietors, a small pile of earth and gravel, covered with briers\nand grass, attracted his attention. He attacked it. I was obliged\nto help him. For an hour, under a hot sun, we labored without\nsuccess. I was discouraged, but Daspry urged me on. His ardor was\nas strong as ever.",
        "At last, Daspry’s pickaxe unearthed some bones--the remains of a\nskeleton to which some scraps of clothing still hung. Suddenly, I\nturned pale. I had discovered, sticking in the earth, a small\npiece of iron cut in the form of a rectangle, on which I thought I\ncould see red spots. I stooped and picked it up. That little iron\nplate was the exact size of a playing-card, and the red spots, made\nwith red lead, were arranged upon it in a manner similar to the\nseven-of-hearts, and each spot was pierced with a round hole\nsimilar to the perforations in the two playing cards.",
        "“Listen, Daspry, I have had enough of this. You can stay if it\ninterests you. But I am going.”",
        "Was that simply the expression of my excited nerves? Or was it the\nresult of a laborious task executed under a burning sun? I know\nthat I trembled as I walked away, and that I went to bed, where I\nremained forty-eight hours, restless and feverish, haunted by\nskeletons that danced around me and threw their bleeding hearts at\nmy head.",
        "Daspry was faithful to me. He came to my house every day, and\nremained three or four hours, which he spent in the large room,\nferreting, thumping, tapping.",
        "“The letters are here, in this room,” he said, from time to time,\n“they are here. I will stake my life on it.”",
        "On the morning of the third day I arose--feeble yet, but cured. A\nsubstantial breakfast cheered me up. But a letter that I received\nthat afternoon contributed, more than anything else, to my complete\nrecovery, and aroused in me a lively curiosity. This was the\nletter:",
        " “Monsieur,",
        " “The drama, the first act of which transpired on the night of 22\n June, is now drawing to a close. Force of circumstances compel me\n to bring the two principal actors in that drama face to face, and I\n wish that meeting to take place in your house, if you will be so\n kind as to give me the use of it for this evening from nine o’clock\n to eleven. It will be advisable to give your servant leave of\n absence for the evening, and, perhaps, you will be so kind as to\n leave the field open to the two adversaries. You will remember\n that when I visited your house on the night of 22 June, I took\n excellent care of your property. I feel that I would do you an\n injustice if I should doubt, for one moment, your absolute\n discretion in this affair. Your devoted,",
        "         “SALVATOR.”",
        "I was amused at the facetious tone of his letter and also at the\nwhimsical nature of his request. There was a charming display of\nconfidence and candor in his language, and nothing in the world\ncould have induced me to deceive him or repay his confidence with\ningratitude.",
        "I gave my servant a theatre ticket, and he left the house at eight\no’clock. A few minutes later, Daspry arrived. I showed him the\nletter.",
        "“Well?” said he.",
        "“Well, I have left the garden gate unlocked, so anyone can enter.”",
        "“And you--are you going away?”",
        "“Not at all. I intend to stay right here.”",
        "“But he asks you to go---”",
        "“But I am not going. I will be discreet, but I am resolved to see\nwhat takes place.”",
        "“Ma foi!” exclaimed Daspry, laughing, “you are right, and I shall\nstay with you. I shouldn’t like to miss it.”",
        "We were interrupted by the sound of the door-bell.",
        "“Here already?” said Daspry, “twenty minutes ahead of time!\nIncredible!”",
        "I went to the door and ushered in the visitor. It was Madame\nAndermatt. She was faint and nervous, and in a stammering voice,\nshe ejaculated:",
        "“My husband....is coming....he has an appointment....\nthey intend to give him the letters....”",
        "“How do you know?” I asked.",
        "“By chance. A message came for my husband while we were at dinner.\nThe servant gave it to me by mistake. My husband grabbed it\nquickly, but he was too late. I had read it.”",
        "“You read it?”",
        "“Yes. It was something like this: `At nine o’clock this evening,\nbe at Boulevard Maillot with the papers connected with the affair.\nIn exchange, the letters.’ So, after dinner, I hastened here.”",
        "“Unknown to your husband?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“What do you think about it?” asked Daspry, turning to me.",
        "“I think as you do, that Mon. Andermatt is one of the invited\nguests.”",
        "“Yes, but for what purpose?”",
        "“That is what we are going to find out.”",
        "I led the m to a large room. The three of us could hide\ncomfortably behind the velvet chimney-mantle, and observe all that\nshould happen in the room. We seated ourselves there, with Madame\nAndermatt in the centre.",
        "The clock struck nine. A few minutes later, the garden gate\ncreaked upon its hinges. I confess that I was greatly agitated. I\nwas about to learn the key to the mystery. The startling events of\nthe last few weeks were about to be explained, and, under my eyes,\nthe last battle was going to be fought. Daspry seized the hand of\nMadame Andermatt, and said to her:",
        "“Not a word, not a movement! Whatever you may see or hear, keep\nquiet!”",
        "Some one entered. It was Alfred Varin. I recognized him at once,\nowing to the close resemblance he bore to his brother Etienne.\nThere was the same slouching gait; the same cadaverous face covered\nwith a black beard.",
        "He entered with the nervous air of a man who is accustomed to fear\nthe presence of traps and ambushes; who scents and avoids them. He\nglanced about the room, and I had the impression that the chimney,\nmasked with a velvet portiere, did not please him. He took three\nsteps in our direction, when something caused him to turn and walk\ntoward the old mosaic king, with the flowing beard and flamboyant\nsword, which he examined minutely, mounting on a chair and\nfollowing with his fingers the outlines of the shoulders and head\nand feeling certain parts of the face. Suddenly, he leaped from\nthe chair and walked away from it. He had heard the sound of\napproaching footsteps. Mon. Andermatt appeared at the door.",
        "“You! You!” exclaimed the banker. “Was it you who brought me\nhere?”",
        "“I? By no means,” protested Varin, in a rough, jerky voice that\nreminded me of his brother, “on the contrary, it was your letter\nthat brought me here.”",
        "“My letter?”",
        "“A letter signed by you, in which you offered---”",
        "“I never wrote to you,” declared Mon. Andermatt.",
        "“You did not write to me!”",
        "Instinctively, Varin was put on his guard, not against the banker,\nbut against the unknown enemy who had drawn him into this trap. A\nsecond time, he looked in our direction, then walked toward the\ndoor. But Mon. Andermatt barred his passage.",
        "“Well, where are you going, Varin?”",
        "“There is something about this affair I don’t like. I am going\nhome. Good evening.”",
        "“One moment!”",
        "“No need of that, Mon. Andermatt. I have nothing to say to you.”",
        "“But I have something to say to you, and this is a good time to say\nit.”",
        "“Let me pass.”",
        "“No, you will not pass.”",
        "Varin recoiled before the resolute attitude of the banker, as he\nmuttered:",
        "“Well, then, be quick about it.”",
        "One thing astonished me; and I have no doubt my two companions\nexperienced a similar feeling. Why was Salvator not there? Was he\nnot a necessary party at this conference? Or was he satisfied to\nlet these two adversaries fight it out between themselves? At all\nevents, his absence was a great disappointment, although it did not\ndetract from the dramatic strength of the situation.",
        "After a moment, Mon. Andermatt approached Varin and, face to face,\neye to eye, said:",
        "“Now, after all these years and when you have nothing more to fear,\nyou can answer me candidly: What have you done with Louis Lacombe?”",
        "“What a question! AS if I knew anything about him!”",
        "“You do know! You and your brother were his constant companions,\nalmost lived with him in this very house. You knew all about his\nplans and his work. And the last night I ever saw Louis Lacombe,\nwhen I parted with him at my door, I saw two men slinking away in\nthe shadows of the trees. That, I am ready to swear to.”",
        "“Well, what has that to do with me?”",
        "“The two men were you and your brother.”",
        "“Prove it.”",
        "“The best proof is that, two days later, you yourself showed me the\npapers and the plans that belonged to Lacombe and offered to sell\nthem. How did these papers come into your possession?”",
        "“I have already told you, Mon. Andermatt, that we found them on\nLouis Lacombe’s table, the morning after his disappearance.”",
        "“That is a lie!”",
        "“Prove it.”",
        "“The law will prove it.”",
        "“Why did you not appeal to the law?”",
        "“Why? Ah! Why---,” stammered the banker, with a slight display of\nemotion.",
        "“You know very well, Mon. Andermatt, if you had the least certainty\nof our guilt, our little threat would not have stopped you.”",
        "“What threat? Those letters? Do you suppose I ever gave those\nletters a moment’s thought?”",
        "“If you did not care for the letters, why did you offer me\nthousands of francs for their return? And why did you have my\nbrother and me tracked like wild beasts?”",
        "“To recover the plans.”",
        "“Nonsense! You wanted the letters. You knew that as soon as you\nhad the letters in your possession, you could denounce us. Oh! no,\nI couldn’t part with them!”",
        "He laughed heartily, but stopped suddenly, and said:",
        "“But, enough of this! We are merely going over old ground. We\nmake no headway. We had better let things stand as they are.”",
        "“We will not let them stand as they are,” said the banker, “and\nsince you have referred to the letters, let me tell you that you\nwill not leave this house until you deliver up those letters.”",
        "“I shall go when I please.”",
        "“You will not.”",
        "“Be careful, Mon. Andermatt. I warn you---”",
        "“I say, you shall not go.”",
        "“We will see about that,” cried Varin, in such a rage that Madame\nAndermatt could not suppress a cry of fear. Varin must have heard\nit, for he now tried to force his way out. Mon. Andermatt pushed\nhim back. Then I saw him put his hand into his coat pocket.",
        "“For the last time, let me pass,” he cried.",
        "“The letters, first!”",
        "Varin drew a revolver and, pointing it at Mon. Andermatt, said:",
        "“Yes or no?”",
        "The banker stooped quickly. There was the sound of a pistol-shot.\nThe weapon fell from Varin’s hand. I was amazed. The shot was\nfired close to me. It was Daspry who had fired it at Varin,\ncausing him to drop the revolver. In a moment, Daspry was standing\nbetween the two men, facing Varin; he said to him, with a sneer:",
        "“You were lucky, my friend, very lucky. I fired at your hand and\nstruck only the revolver.”",
        "Both of them looked at him, surprised. Then he turned to the\nbanker, and said:",
        "“I beg your pardon, monsieur, for meddling in your business; but,\nreally, you play a very poor game. Let me hold the cards.”",
        "Turning again to Varin, Daspry said:",
        "“It’s between us two, comrade, and play fair, if you please.\nHearts are trumps, and I play the seven.”",
        "Then Daspry held up, before Varin’s bewildered eyes, the little\niron plate, marked with the seven red spots. It was a terrible\nshock to Varin. With livid features, staring eyes, and an air of\nintense agony, the man seemed to be hypnotized at the sight of it.",
        "“Who are you?” he gasped.",
        "“One who meddles in other people’s business, down to the very\nbottom.”",
        "“What do you want?”",
        "“What you brought here tonight.”",
        "“I brought nothing.”",
        "“Yes, you did, or you wouldn’t have come. This morning, you\nreceived an invitation to come here at nine o’clock, and bring with\nyou all the papers held by you. You are here. Where are the\npapers?”",
        "There was in Daspry’s voice and manner a tone of authority that I\ndid not understand; his manner was usually quite mild and\nconciliatory. Absolutely conquered, Varin placed his hand on one\nof his pockets, and said:",
        "“The papers are here.”",
        "“All of them?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“All that you took from Louis Lacombe and afterwards sold to Major\nvon Lieben?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Are these the copies or the originals?”",
        "“I have the originals.”",
        "“How much do you want for them?”",
        "“One hundred thousand francs.”",
        "“You are crazy,” said Daspry. “Why, the major gave you only twenty\nthousand, and that was like money thrown into the sea, as the boat\nwas a failure at the preliminary trials.”",
        "“They didn’t understand the plans.”",
        "“The plans are not complete.”",
        "“Then, why do you ask me for them?”",
        "“Because I want them. I offer you five thousand francs--not a sou\nmore.”",
        "“Ten thousand. Not a sou less.”",
        "“Agreed,” said Daspry, who now turned to Mon. Andermatt, and said:",
        "“Monsieur will kindly sign a check for the amount.”",
        "“But....I haven’t got---”",
        "“Your check-book? Here it is.”",
        "Astounded, Mon. Andermatt examined the check-book that Daspry\nhanded to him.",
        "“It is mine,” he gasped. “How does that happen?”",
        "“No idle words, monsieur, if you please. You have merely to sign.”",
        "The banker took out his fountain pen, filled out the check and\nsigned it. Varin held out his hand for it.",
        "“Put down your hand,” said Daspry, “there is something more.\"\nThen, to the banker, he said: “You asked for some letters, did you\nnot?”",
        "“Yes, a package of letters.”",
        "“Where are they, Varin?”",
        "“I haven’t got them.”",
        "------------------",
        "“Where are they, Varin?”",
        "“I don’t know. My brother had charge of them.”",
        "“They are hidden in this room.”",
        "“In that case, you know where they are.”",
        "“How should I know?”",
        "“Was it not you who found the hiding-place? You appear to be as\nwell informed....as Salvator.”",
        "“The letters are not in the hiding-place.”",
        "“They are.”",
        "“Open it.”",
        "Varin looked at him, defiantly. Were not Daspry and Salvator the\nsame person? Everything pointed to that conclusion. If so, Varin\nrisked nothing in disclosing a hiding-place already known.",
        "“Open it,” repeated Daspry.",
        "“I have not got the seven of hearts.”",
        "“Yes, here it is,” said Daspry, handing him the iron plate. Varin\nrecoiled in terror, and cried:",
        "“No, no, I will not.”",
        "“Never mind,” replied Daspry, as he walked toward the bearded king,\nclimbed on a chair and applied the seven of hearts to the lower\npart of the sword in such a manner that the edges of the iron plate\ncoincided exactly with the two edges of the sword. Then, with the\nassistance of an awl which he introduced alternately into each of\nthe seven holes, he pressed upon seven of the little mosaic stones.\nAs he pressed upon the seventh one, a clicking sound was heard, and\nthe entire bust of the King turned upon a pivot, disclosing a large\nopening lined with steel. It was really a fire-proof safe.",
        "“You can see, Varin, he safe is empty.”",
        "“So I see. Then, my brother has taken out the letters.”",
        "Daspry stepped down from the chair, approached Varin, and said:",
        "“Now, no more nonsense with me. There is another hiding-place.\nWhere is it?”",
        "“There is none.”",
        "“Is it money you want? How much?”",
        "“Ten thousand.”",
        "“Monsieur Andermatt, are those letters worth then thousand francs\nto you?”",
        "“Yes,” said the banker, firmly.",
        "Varin closed the safe, took the seven of hearts and placed it again\non the sword at the same spot. He thrust the awl into each of the\nseven holes. There was the same clicking sound, but this time,\nstrange to relate, it was only a portion of the safe that revolved\non the pivot, disclosing quite a small safe that was built within\nthe door of the larger one. The packet of letters was here, tied\nwith a tape, and sealed. Varin handed the packet to Daspry. The\nlatter turned to the banker, and asked:",
        "“Is the check ready, Monsieur Andermatt?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“And you have also the last document that you received from Louis\nLacombe--the one that completes the plans of the sub-marine?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "The exchange was made. Daspry pocketed the document and the\nchecks, and offered the packet of letters to Mon. Andermatt.",
        "“This is what you wanted, Monsieur.”",
        "The banker hesitated a moment, as if he were afraid to touch those\ncursed letters that he had sought so eagerly. Then, with a nervous\nmovement, he took them. Close to me, I heard a moan. I grasped\nMadame Andermatt’s hand. It was cold.",
        "“I believe, monsieur,” said Daspry to the banker, “that our\nbusiness is ended. Oh! no thanks. It was only by a mere chance\nthat I have been able to do you a good turn. Good-night.”",
        "Mon. Andermatt retired. He carried with him the letters written by\nhis wife to Louis Lacombe.",
        "“Marvelous!” exclaimed Daspry, delighted. “Everything is coming\nour way. Now, we have only to close our little affair, comrade.\nYou have the papers?”",
        "“Here they are--all of them.”",
        "Daspry examined them carefully, and then placed them in his pocket.",
        "“Quite right. You have kept your word,” he said.",
        "“But---”",
        "“But what?”",
        "“The two checks? The money?” said Varin, eagerly.",
        "“Well, you have a great deal of assurance, my man. How dare you\nask such a thing?”",
        "“I ask only what is due to me.”",
        "“Can you ask pay for returning papers that you stole? Well, I\nthink not!”",
        "Varin was beside himself. He trembled with rage; his eyes were\nbloodshot.",
        "“The money....the twenty thousand....” he stammered.",
        "“Impossible! I need it myself.”",
        "“The money!”",
        "“Come, be reasonable, and don’t get excited. It won’t do you any\ngood.”",
        "Daspry seized his arm so forcibly, that Varin uttered a cry of\npain. Daspry continued:",
        "“Now, you can go. The air will do you good. Perhaps you want me\nto show you the way. Ah! yes, we will go together to the vacant lot\nnear here, and I will show you a little mound of earth and stones\nand under it---”",
        "“That is false! That is false!”",
        "“Oh! no, it is true. That little iron plate with the seven spots\non it came from there. Louis Lacombe always carried it, and you\nburied it with the body--and with some other things that will prove\nvery interesting to a judge and jury.”",
        "Varin covered his face with his hands, and muttered:",
        "“All right, I am beaten. Say no more. But I want to ask you one\nquestion. I should like to know---”",
        "“What is it?”",
        "“Was there a little casket in the large safe?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Was it there on the night of 22 June?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“What did it contain?”",
        "“Everything that the Varin brothers had put in it--a very pretty\ncollection of diamonds and pearls picked up here and there by the\nsaid brothers.”",
        "“And did you take it?”",
        "“Of course I did. Do you blame me?”",
        "“I understand....it was the disappearance of that casket that\ncaused my brother to kill himself.”",
        "“Probably. The disappearance of your correspondence was not a\nsufficient motive. But the disappearance of the casket....Is\nthat all you wish to ask me?”",
        "“One thing more: your name?”",
        "“You ask that with an idea of seeking revenge.”",
        "“Parbleu! The tables may be turned. Today, you are on top.\nTo-morrow---”",
        "“It will be you.”",
        "“I hope so. Your name?”",
        "“Arsene Lupin.”",
        "“Arsene Lupin!”",
        "The man staggered, as though stunned by a heavy blow. Those two\nwords had deprived him of all hope.",
        "Daspry laughed, and said:",
        "“Ah! did you imagine that a Monsieur Durand or Dupont could manage\nan affair like this? No, it required the skill and cunning of\nArsene Lupin. And now that you have my name, go and prepare your\nrevenge. Arsene Lupin will wait for you.”",
        "Then he pushed the bewildered Varin through the door.",
        "“Daspry! Daspry!” I cried, pushing aside the curtain. He ran to\nme.",
        "“What? What’s the matter?”",
        "“Madame Andermatt is ill.”",
        "He hastened to her, caused her to inhale some salts, and, while\ncaring for her, questioned me:",
        "“Well, what did it?”",
        "“The letters of Louis Lacombe that you gave to her husband.”",
        "He struck his forehead and said:",
        "“Did she think that I could do such a thing!...But, of course\nshe would. Imbecile that I am!”",
        "Madame Andermatt was now revived. Daspry took from his pocket a\nsmall package exactly similar to the one that Mon. Andermatt had\ncarried away.",
        "“Here are your letters, Madame. These are the genuine letters.”",
        "“But....the others?”",
        "“The others are the same, rewritten by me and carefully worded.\nYour husband will not find anything objectionable in them, and will\nnever suspect the substitution since they were taken from the safe\nin his presence.”",
        "“But the handwriting---”",
        "“There is no handwriting that cannot be imitated.”",
        "She thanked him in the same words she might have used to a man in\nher own social circle, so I concluded that she had not witnessed\nthe final scene between Varin and Arsene Lupin. But the surprising\nrevelation caused me considerable embarrassment. Lupin! My club\ncompanion was none other than Arsene Lupin. I could not realize\nit. But he said, quite at his ease:",
        "“You can say farewell to Jean Daspry.”",
        "“Ah!”",
        "“Yes, Jean Daspry is going on a long journey. I shall send him to\nMorocco. There, he may find a death worth of him. I may say that\nthat is his expectation.”",
        "“But Arsene Lupin will remain?”",
        "“Oh! Decidedly. Arsene Lupin is simply at the threshold of his\ncareer, and he expects---”",
        "I was impelled by curiosity to interrupt him, and, leading him away\nfrom the hearing of Madame Andermatt, I asked:",
        "“Did you discover the smaller safe yourself--the one that held the\nletters?”",
        "“Yes, after a great deal of trouble. I found it yesterday\nafternoon while you were asleep. And yet, God knows it was simple\nenough! But the simplest things are the ones that usually escape\nour notice.” Then, showing me the seven-of-hearts, he added: “Of\ncourse I had guessed that, in order to open the larger safe, this\ncard must be placed on the sword of the mosaic king.”",
        "“How did you guess that?”",
        "“Quite easily. Through private information, I knew that fact when\nI came here on the evening of 22 June---”",
        "“After you left me---”",
        "“Yes, after turning the subject of our conversation to stories of\ncrime and robbery which were sure to reduce you to such a nervous\ncondition that you would not leave your bed, but would allow me to\ncomplete my search uninterrupted.”",
        "“The scheme worked perfectly.”",
        "“Well, I knew when I came here that there was a casket concealed in\na safe with a secret lock, and that the seven-of-hearts was the key\nto that lock. I had merely to place the card upon the spot that\nwas obviously intended for it. An hour’s examination showed me\nwhere the spot was.”",
        "“One hour!”",
        "“Observe the fellow in mosaic.”",
        "“The old emperor?”",
        "“That old emperor is an exact representation of the king of hearts\non all playing cards.”",
        "“That’s right. But how does the seven of hearts open the larger\nsafe at one time and the smaller safe at another time? And why did\nyou open only the larger safe in the first instance? I mean on the\nnight of 22 June.”",
        "“Why? Because I always placed the seven of hearts in the same way.\nI never changed the position. But, yesterday, I observed that by\nreversing the card, by turning it upside down, the arrangement of\nthe seven spots on the mosaic was changed.”",
        "“Parbleu!”",
        "“Of course, parbleu! But a person has to think of those things.”",
        "“There is something else: you did not know the history of those\nletters until Madame Andermatt---”",
        "“Spoke of them before me? No. Because I found in the safe, besides\nthe casket, nothing but the correspondence of the two brothers\nwhich disclosed their treachery in regard to the plans.”",
        "“Then it was by chance that you were led, first, to investigate the\nhistory of the two brothers, and then to search for the plans and\ndocuments relating to the sub-marine?”",
        "“Simply by chance.”",
        "“For what purpose did you make the search?”",
        "“Mon Dieu!” exclaimed Daspry, laughing, “how deeply interested you\nare!”",
        "“The subject fascinates me.”",
        "“Very well, presently, after I have escorted Madame Andermatt to a\ncarriage, and dispatched a short story to the `Echo de France,’ I\nwill return and tell you all about it.”",
        "He sat down and wrote one of those short, clear-cut articles which\nserved to amuse and mystify the public. Who does not recall the\nsensation that followed that article produced throughout the entire\nworld?",
        "“Arsene Lupin has solved the problem recently submitted by\nSalvator. Having acquired possession of all the documents and\noriginal plans of the engineer Louis Lacombe, he has placed them in\nthe hands of the Minister of Marine, and he has headed a\nsubscription list for the purpose of presenting to the nation the\nfirst submarine constructed from those plans. His subscription is\ntwenty thousand francs.”",
        "“Twenty thousand francs! The checks of Mon. Andermatt?” I\nexclaimed, when he had given me the paper to read.",
        "“Exactly. It was quite right that Varin should redeem his\ntreachery.”",
        "And that is how I made the acquaintance of Arsene Lupin. That is\nhow I learned that Jean Daspry, a member of my club, was none other\nthan Arsene Lupin, gentleman-thief. That is how I formed very\nagreeable ties of friendship with that famous man, and, thanks to\nthe confidence with which he honored me, how I became his very\nhumble and faithful historiographer.",
