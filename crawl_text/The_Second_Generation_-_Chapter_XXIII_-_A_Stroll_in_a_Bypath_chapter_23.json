        "Ross had intended to dine at the club; but Mrs. Hastings’s trap was\nhardly clear of the grounds when he, to be free to think uninterruptedly,\nset out through the woods for Point Helen.",
        "Even had he had interests more absorbing than pastimes, display, and\nmoney-making by the “brace” game of “high finance” with its small risks\nof losing and smaller risks of being caught, even if he had been married\nto a less positive and incessant irritant than Theresa was to him, he\nwould still not have forgotten Adelaide. Forgetfulness comes with the\nfinished episode, never with the unfinished. In the circumstances, there\ncould be but one effect from seeing her again. His regrets blazed up into\nfierce remorse, became the reckless raging of a passion to which\nobstacles and difficulties are as fuel to fire.",
        "Theresa, once the matter of husband-getting was safely settled, had no\nrestraint of prudence upon her self-complacence. She “let herself go\"\ncompletely, with results upon her character, her mind, and her personal\nappearance that were depressing enough to the casual beholder, but\nappalling to those who were in her intimacy of the home. Ross watched her\ndeteriorate in gloomy and unreproving silence. She got herself together\nsufficiently for as good public appearance as a person of her wealth and\nposition needed to make, he reasoned; what did it matter how she looked\nand talked at home where, after all, the only person she could hope to\nplease was herself? He held aloof, drawn from his aloofness occasionally\nby her whim to indulge herself in what she regarded as proofs of his\nlove. Her pouting, her whimpering, her abject but meaningless\nself-depreciation, her tears, were potent, not for the flattering reason\nshe assigned, but because he, out of pity for her and self-reproach, and\ndread of her developing her mother’s weakness, would lash himself into\nthe small show of tenderness sufficient to satisfy her.",
        "And now, steeped in the gall of as bitter a draught as experience forces\nfolly to drink anew each day to the dregs–the realization that, though\nthe man marries the money only, he lives with the wife only–Ross had met\nAdelaide again. “I’ll go to Chicago in the morning,” was his conclusion.\n“I’ll do the honorable thing\"–he sneered at himself–\"since trying the\nother would only result in her laughing at me and in my being still more\nmiserable.”",
        "But when morning came he was critical of the clothes his valet offered\nhim, spent an hour in getting himself groomed for public appearance, then\nappeared at the Country Club for breakfast instead of driving to the\nstation. And after breakfast, he put off his departure “until to-morrow\nor next day,” and went to see Mr. and Mrs. Hastings. And what more\nnatural then than that Henrietta should take him to the Villa d’Orsay “to\nshow you how charmingly Del has installed herself.” “And perhaps,” said\nHenrietta, “she and Arden Wilmot will go for a drive. He has quit the\nbank because they objected to his resting two hours in the middle of the\nday.” What more natural than that Adelaide should alter her resolution\nunder the compulsion of circumstance, should spend the entire morning in\nthe gardens, she with Ross, Henrietta with Arden? Finally, to avoid\nstrain upon her simple domestic arrangements in that period of\nretrenchment, what more natural than falling in with Ross’s proposal of\nlunch at Indian Mound? And who ever came back in a hurry from Indian\nMound, with its quaint vast earthworks, its ugly, incredibly ancient\npotteries and flint instruments that could be uncovered anywhere with the\npoint of a cane or parasol; its superb panorama, bounded by the far blue\nhills where, in days that were ancient when history began, fires were\nlighted by sentinels to signal the enemy’s approach to a people whose\nvery dust, whose very name has perished? It was six o’clock before they\nbegan the return drive; at seven they were passing the Country Club, and,\nof course, they dined there and joined in the little informal dance\nafterwards; and later, supper and cooling drinks in a corner of the\nveranda, with the moon streaming upon them and the enchanted breath of\nthe forest enchaining the senses.",
        "What a day! How obligingly all unpleasant thoughts fled! How high and\nbright rose the mountains all round the horizon of the present, shutting\nout yesterday and to-morrow! “This has been the happy day of my life,\"\nsaid Ross as they lingered behind the other two on the way to the last\n’bus for the town. “The happiest\"–in a lower tone–\"thus far.”",
        "And Del was sparkling assent, encouragement even; and her eyes were\ngleaming defiantly at the only-too-plainly-to-be-read faces of the few\nhilltop people still left at the club house. “Surely a woman has the\nright to enjoy herself innocently in the twentieth century,” she was\nsaying to herself. “Dory wouldn’t want me to sit moping alone. I am\nyoung; I’ll have enough of that after I’m old–one is old so much longer\nthan young.” And she looked up at Ross, and very handsome he was in that\nsoft moonlight, his high-blazing passion glorifying his features. “I,\ntoo, have been happy,” she said to him. Then, with a vain effort to seem\nand to believe herself at ease, “I wish Dory could have been along.”",
        "But Ross was not abashed by the exorcism of that name; her bringing it in\nwas too strained, would have been amusing if passion were not devoid of\nthe sense of humor. “She does care for me!” he was thinking dizzily.\n“And I can’t live without her–and won’t!”",
        "His mother had been writing him her discoveries that his father, in\nwretched health and goaded by physical torment to furious play at the\ngreen tables of “high finance,” was losing steadily, swiftly, heavily.\nBut Ross read her letters as indifferently as he read Theresa’s appeals\nto him to come to Windrift. It took a telegram–\"Matters much worse than\nI thought. You must be here to talk with him before he begins business\nto-morrow\"–to shock him into the realization that he had been imperiling\nthe future he was dreaming of and planning–his and Del’s future.",
        "On the way to the train he stopped at the Villa d’Orsay, saw her and\nHenrietta at the far end of Mrs. Dorsey’s famed white-and-gold garden.\nHenrietta was in the pavilion reading. A few yards away Adelaide, head\nbent and blue sunshade slowly turning as it rested on her shoulder, was\nstrolling round the great flower-rimmed, lily-strewn outer basin of Mrs.\nDorsey’s famed fountain, the school of crimson fish, like a streak of\nfire in the water, following her. When she saw him coming toward them in\ntraveling suit, instead of the white serge he always wore on such days\nas was that, she knew he was going away–a fortunate forewarning, for\nshe thus had time to force a less telltale expression before he\nannounced the reason for his call. “But,” he added, “I’ll be back in a\nfew days–a very few.”",
        "“Oh!” was all Del said; but her tone of relief, her sudden brightening,\nwere more significant than any words could have been.",
        "Henrietta now joined them. “You take the afternoon express?” said she.",
        "Ross could not conceal how severe a test of his civility this\ninterruption was. “Yes,” said he. “My trap is in front of the house.”",
        "There he colored before Henrietta’s expression, a mingling of amusement,\nindignation, and contempt, a caustic comment upon his disregard of the\neffect of such indiscretion upon a Saint X young married woman’s\nreputation. “Then,” said she, looking straight and significantly at him,\n“you’ll be able to drop me at my house on the way.”",
        "“Certainly,” was his prompt assent. When Saint X’s morality police should\nsee him leaving the grounds with her, they would be silenced as to this\nparticular occurrence at least. After a few minutes of awkward\ncommonplaces, he and Henrietta went up the lawns, leaving Del there. At\nthe last point from which the end of the garden could be seen, he\ndropped behind, turned, saw her in exactly the same position, the\nfountain and the water lilies before her, the center and climax of those\nstretches of white-and-gold blossoms. The sunshade rested lightly upon\nher shoulder, and its azure concave made a harmonious background for her\nsmall, graceful head with the airily plumed hat set so becomingly upon\nthose waves of dead-gold hair. He waved to her; but she made no sign of\nhaving seen.",
        "When Henrietta returned, Adelaide had resumed her reverie and her slow\nmarch round the fountain. Henrietta watched with a quizzical expression\nfor some time before saying: “If I hadn’t discouraged him, I believe he’d\nhave blurted it all out to me–all he came to say to you.”",
        "Del was still absent-minded as she answered: “It’s too absurd. People are\nso censorious, so low-minded.”",
        "“They are,” rejoined Mrs. Hastings. “And, I’m sorry to say, as a rule\nthey’re right.”",
        "The curve of Del’s delicate eyebrows and of her lips straightened.",
        "“All the trouble comes through our having nothing to do,” pursued\nHenrietta, disregarding those signs that her “meddling” was unwelcome.\n“The idle women! We ought to be busy at something useful–you and I and\nthe rest of ’em. Then we’d not be tempted to kill time doing things that\ncause gossip, and may cause scandal.” Seeing that Adelaide was about to\nmake some curt retort, she added: “Now, don’t pretend, Del. You know,\nyourself, that they’re always getting into mischief and getting the men\ninto mischief.”",
        "“Don’t you ever feel, Henrietta, that we’re simply straws in the\nstrong wind?”",
        "“Fate sometimes does force mischief on men and women,” was Henrietta’s\nretort, “and it ceases to be mischief–becomes something else, I’m not\nsure just what. But usually fate has nothing to do with the matter. It’s\nwe ourselves that course for mischief, like a dog for rabbits.”",
        "Del, in sudden disdain of evasion, faced her with, “Well, Henrietta,\nwhat of it?”",
        "Mrs. Hastings elevated and lowered her shoulders. “Simply that you’re\nseeing too much of Ross–too much for his good, if not for your own.”",
        "Del’s sunshade was revolving impatiently.",
        "“It’s as plain as black on white,” continued Mrs. Hastings, “that he’s\nmadly in love with you–in love as only an experienced man can be with an\nexperienced and developed woman.”",
        "“Well, what of it?” Del’s tone was hostile, defiant.",
        "“You can’t abruptly stop seeing him. Everyone’d say you and he were\nmeeting secretly.”",
        "“Really!”",
        "“But you can be careful how you treat him. You can show him, and\neverybody, that there’s nothing in it. You must–” Henrietta hesitated,\ndared; “you must be just friendly, as you are with Arden and the rest\nof the men.”",
        "Hiram’s daughter was scarlet. Full a minute, and a very full minute, of\nsilence. Then Adelaide said coldly: “Thank you. And now that you’ve freed\nyour mind I hope you’ll keep it free for your own affairs.”",
        "“Ouch!” cried Henrietta, making a wry face. And she devoted the rest of\nthe afternoon to what she realized, at the parting, was the vain task of\nmollifying Del. She knew that thenceforth she and Adelaide would drift\napart; and she was sorry, for she liked her–liked to talk with her,\nliked to go about with her. Adelaide’s beauty attracted the men, and a\nmale audience was essential to Henrietta’s happiness; she found the\nconversation of women–the women she felt socially at ease with–tedious,\nand their rather problematic power of appreciation limited to what came\nfrom men. As she grew older, and less and less pleasing to the eye, the\nmen showed more and more clearly how they had deceived themselves in\nthinking it was her brains that had made them like her. As Henrietta,\nwith mournful cynicism, put it: “Men the world over care little about\nwomen beyond their physical charm. To realize it, look at us American\nwomen, who can do nothing toward furthering men’s ambitions. We’ve only\nour physical charms to offer; we fall when we lose them. And so our old\nwomen and our homely women, except those that work or that have big\nhouses and social power, have no life of their own, live on sufferance,\nalone or the slaves of their daughters or of some pretty young woman to\nwhom they attach themselves.”",
        "The days dragged for Adelaide. “I’m afraid he’ll write,” said\nshe–meaning that she hoped he would. Indeed, she felt that he had\nwritten, but had destroyed the letters. And she was right; almost all\nthe time he could spare from his efforts to save his father from a sick\nbut obstinately active man’s bad judgment was given to writing to\nher–formal letters which he tore up as too formal, passionate letters\nwhich he destroyed as unwarranted and unwise, when he had not yet, face\nto face, in words, told her his love and drawn from her what he believed\nwas in her heart. The days dragged; she kept away from Henrietta, from\nall “our set,” lest they should read in her dejected countenance the\ntruth, and more.",
