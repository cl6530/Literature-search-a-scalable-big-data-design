        "No literary labor is more delightful to me than translating the\nbeautiful thoughts and fancies of Hans Christian Andersen. My heart is\nin the work, and I feel as if my spirit were kindred to his; just as\nour Saxon English seems to me eminently fitted to give the simple,\npure, and noble sentiments of the Danish mind.",
        "This True Story of his Life will not be found the least interesting of\nhis writings; indeed, to me it seems one of the most so. It furnishes\nthe key, as it were, to all the rest; and the treasures which it\nunlocks will be found to be possessed of additional value when viewed\nthrough the medium of this introduction. It is gratifying for me to be\nable to state that the original Author has a personal interest in this\nEnglish version of his “Life,” as I have arranged with my publishers to\npay Mr. Andersen a certain sum on the publication of this translation,\nand the same on all future editions.",
