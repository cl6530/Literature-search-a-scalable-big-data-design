        "I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people sur-\nrounding the huge hole in which the cylinder lay.  I have\nalready described the appearance of that colossal bulk, em-\nbedded in the ground.  The turf and gravel about it seemed\ncharred as if by a sudden explosion.  No doubt its impact\nhad caused a flash of fire.  Henderson and Ogilvy were not\nthere.  I think they perceived that nothing was to be done for\nthe present, and had gone away to breakfast at Henderson’s\nhouse.",
        "There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the\nPit, with their feet dangling, and amusing themselves--until\nI stopped them--by throwing stones at the giant mass.\nAfter I had spoken to them about it, they began playing at\n“touch” in and out of the group of bystanders.",
        "Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener\nI employed sometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the\nbutcher and his little boy, and two or three loafers and golf\ncaddies who were accustomed to hang about the railway\nstation.  There was very little talking.  Few of the common\npeople in England had anything but the vaguest astronomical\nideas in those days.  Most of them were staring quietly at\nthe big tablelike end of the cylinder, which was still as\nOgilvy and Henderson had left it.  I fancy the popular ex-\npectation of a heap of charred corpses was disappointed at\nthis inanimate bulk.  Some went away while I was there, and\nother people came.  I clambered into the pit and fancied I\nheard a faint movement under my feet.  The top had certainly\nceased to rotate.",
        "It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness\nof this object was at all evident to me.  At the first glance\nit was really no more exciting than an overturned carriage\nor a tree blown across the road.  Not so much so, indeed.  It\nlooked like a rusty gas float.  It required a certain amount of\nscientific education to perceive that the grey scale of the\nThing was no common oxide, that the yellowish-white metal\nthat gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder\nhad an unfamiliar hue.  “Extra-terrestrial” had no meaning for\nmost of the onlookers.",
        "At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the\nThing had come from the planet Mars, but I judged it\nimprobable that it contained any living creature.  I thought\nthe unscrewing might be automatic.  In spite of Ogilvy, I\nstill believed that there were men in Mars.  My mind ran\nfancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript,\non the difficulties in translation that might arise, whether\nwe should find coins and models in it, and so forth.  Yet it\nwas a little too large for assurance on this idea.  I felt an\nimpatience to see it opened.  About eleven, as nothing\nseemed happening, I walked back, full of such thought, to\nmy home in Maybury.  But I found it difficult to get to work\nupon my abstract investigations.",
        "In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered\nvery much.  The early editions of the evening papers had\nstartled London with enormous headlines:",
        "\n             “A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS.”",
        "          “REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,”",
        "and so forth.  In addition, Ogilvy’s wire to the Astronomical\nExchange had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms.",
        "There were half a dozen flies or more from the Woking\nstation standing in the road by the sand pits, a basket-\nchaise from Chobham, and a rather lordly carriage.  Besides\nthat, there was quite a heap of bicycles.  In addition, a\nlarge number of people must have walked, in spite of the\nheat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there was\naltogether quite a considerable crowd--one or two gaily\ndressed ladies among the others.\n  It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath\nof wind, and the only shadow was that of the few scattered\npine trees.  The burning heather had been extinguished, but\nthe level ground towards Ottershaw was blackened as far as\none could see, and still giving off vertical streamers of\nsmoke.  An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the Chobham\nRoad had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green\napples and ginger beer.",
        "Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a\ngroup of about half a dozen men--Henderson, Ogilvy, and\na tall, fair-haired man that I afterwards learned was Stent,\nthe Astronomer Royal, with several workmen wielding spades\nand pickaxes.  Stent was giving directions in a clear, high-\npitched voice.  He was standing on the cylinder, which was\nnow evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and stream-\ning with perspiration, and something seemed to have irritated\nhim.",
        "A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered,\nthough its lower end was still embedded.  As soon as Ogilvy\nsaw me among the staring crowd on the edge of the pit\nhe called to me to come down, and asked me if I would\nmind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor.",
        "The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious\nimpediment to their excavations, especially the boys.  They\nwanted a light railing put up, and help to keep the people\nback.  He told me that a faint stirring was occasionally still\naudible within the case, but that the workmen had failed\nto unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them.  The\ncase appeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible\nthat the faint sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult\nin the interior.",
        "I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of\nthe privileged spectators within the contemplated enclosure.\nI failed to find Lord Hilton at his house, but I was told\nhe was expected from London by the six o’clock train from\nWaterloo; and as it was then about a quarter past five, I\nwent home, had some tea, and walked up to the station\nto waylay him.",
