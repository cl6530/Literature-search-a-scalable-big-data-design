        "1. The Pilgrims had passed away. Long years had elapsed since the last\nof the New England fathers had exchanged the earthly for the heavenly\nkingdom. The grandchildren and the great-grandchildren of the first\nimmigrants possessed the soil. No aliens they, seeking a refuge in an\nunknown land, but the sturdy possessors of homes where they were born,\nand around which clustered all tender family ties. The passionate love\nfor England, filtered through three generations, had moderated to a\nfilial respect without impairing filial obedience.",
        "2. Marvelous the change in outward conditions of that century and a\nhalf! Wave after wave of intelligent activity had passed over the\nland. Settlers’ fires hunted the track of Indians westward bound. On\nthe site of primeval forests, fields of grain shimmered in the sun.\nThe rude hut, hastily built for shelter, had given place to the\ncomfortable farm-house and the elegant mansion. Village and city had\ngrown up in the centers of trade. The mechanic arts had slowly made\ntheir way. Change vast, weighty, permanent–not sudden, but orderly\ngrowth–fruit of seed sown, but none the less marvelous for that.",
        "3. Internal change had accompanied the external. Spiritual growth had\ngone hand in hand with increase of life’s comforts. Persecution as a\nmeans of conversion had disappeared before common dangers and\nsufferings. Intolerance had toned down into a mild form of bigotry.\nThe shovel-hat of the parson and the flowing robes of the magistrate\nhad lost much of their superstitious significance. The hard,\nself-imposed restraints of the Puritans had become less rigid at home\nand in public. Individual life was freer, fuller, and more complete.",
        "4. So sped the years until after the French war–until the last of\nEngland’s rivals had been effectually subdued. Now England, for the\nfirst time, seems to have been brought face to face with her sturdy\noffspring. Now she deliberately made up her mind to make him\nuseful–pay her debts, fight her enemies, subserve her interests first\nand always. So, with blustering words about rights, she imposed\nburdens, with significant hints in regard to chastisements; she\nwithheld privileges; the cherishing mother in word and deed proving to\nbe a veritable step-mother with the hardest of hearts.",
        "5. Here trouble began. The son had an equal share with the parent in\nAgincourt and Magna Charta. He was confiding and unsuspicious, but\nthe experience of three generations in the wilds had accustomed him to\nfreedom, and had given him hardihood. His shoulders were broad, but it\nwas difficult to bind burdens upon them against his will. As the\npolicy of the parent dawned upon him, first came incredulous\nquestioning, “What does this mean?\"–then protest, showing the injury\nand suggesting “There must be some mistake!\"–last, conviction of\nintended injustice, the hot wrath, and the emphatic statement, “I will\nnot obey!” The angry note of defiance was heard rolling along the\nAtlantic coast from New England to Georgia. Descendants of Roundheads,\nCavaliers, and Huguenots forgot their ancient prejudices and united\nagainst this common danger. Patrick Henry responded to the sentiments\nof Otis and Adams, and Virginia sent friendly greetings to the\ncommonwealth of Massachusetts.",
        "6. The madness that afflicted the last years of the life of George III\nseems to have taken possession of the British ministry. Exaction\nfollowed exaction in increasing intensity and number. The history of\ncoercive legislation can scarcely find a parallel to that of the\nBritish Parliament for the fifteen years following the fall of Quebec.\nWithal, no excuse was ever made for injustice done, no sympathy was\never expressed for suffering inflicted, but all communication conveyed\nthe stern purpose to subdue. Hungry for affection, the half-grown\noffspring turned his face toward England for the smallest caress, and\nthe east wind brought back across the Atlantic full in his face the\nsharp crack of a whip.",
        "7. Then came a period of aggression and resistance. The Stamp Act was\npassed, but stamp could not be sold, and the lives of stamp-venders\nbecame miserable. Soldiers crowded citizens upon Boston Common;\ncitizens mobbed the soldiers; soldiers fired, killing five citizens,\nand were saved from destruction only by the active interference of the\npatriot leaders. This affray marked the first shedding of blood, and\nhas gone into history as “The Boston Massacre.” Tea was taxed, but\nthe matrons took to catnip and sage, and no tea was sold. Three\ncargoes of taxed tea were sent into Boston harbor, but a war-whoop was\nheard; the vessels were boarded by a band of painted savages, tomahawk\nin band; the tea-chests were broken up and the tea was thrown into the\nwater. This last act demanded special punishment, and the Boston Port\nBill shut up the port of Boston, allowing no ship to go in or out. The\nsympathetic people of Salem and Marblehead placed wharf and warehouse\nat the disposal of Boston merchants, softening the blow as much as\npossible. Relief to the suffering poor of Boston poured in from all\nsides, and the British ministry saw that the whole people were making\ncommon cause in resistance to oppression.",
        "8. The next step is the vigorous use of the strong arm. Filial love\nmust be forced in by means of bayonets, and affection secured by\ngunpowder and bullets. A strong force of soldiers under General Gage\ntook possession of Boston. The troops were quartered in the City Hall\nand other buildings sacred in the eyes of the people to justice and\npeace. The city government was superseded by the military. Sentinels\npatrolled the streets. Arbitrary edicts took the place of law.\nCitizens were interfered with while in the pursuit of private\nbusiness. For soldiers’ insults there was no redress. The leading\npatriots, John Adams, Joseph Warren, James Otis, John Hancock, and\nSamuel Adams, were hunted, and a price was set on their heads. Boston\nwas in the strong hands of military power. Outwardly it was subdued,\nbut beneath was a seething fire, ready to burst into flame when the\nmoment for conflagration should arrive.",
        "9. But Massachusetts was aroused. Town and country were one. The war\nspirit invoked engendered its kind. Committees of Safety were formed\nin every town. The drum and fife echoed from mountain to valley. The\nmusket of the old war, the shot-gun of the sportsman, and the rifle of\nthe hunter were brought from their resting-places and prepared for\nuse. Forge and hammer were busy in making guns and swords. Minute-men\nin every hamlet prepared to march on the moment. Nor were the women\nidle; wheel and loom were busy as never before. The patriot soldier,\nstarting for the front, was clad in serviceable home-spun, prepared by\nloving hands, and he departed amid the tears, prayers, and blessings\nof loving yet steadfast hearts.",
        "10. The General Court of Massachusetts was convened. It was denounced\nand proscribed by General Gage, but in the eyes of the people its\nmandates had all the force of law. Taxes were levied and cheerfully\npaid. The colony was divided into military districts, and each one\nplaced under the command of a competent officer. Powder, arms, and\nother military stores were collected, and all needful preparations\nwere made for war. The other New England colonies fully shared in the\nexcitement of Massachusetts. The note of alarm spread through the\nland, and a Continental Congress was called to meet at Philadelphia to\nconsider the policy best to be pursued for the common weal.",
        "11. But General Gage became impatient. He would strike a blow that\nwould at once assert British power and terrify the whole rebel race.\nThe mailed hand must be seen beneath the soft glove. The opportunity\nwas not long wanting. A military depot at Concord, eighteen miles\nnorthwest of Boston, he determined to seize. A force of eight hundred\nmen, under Lieutenant-Colonel Smith and Major Pitcairn, was to set out\non the evening of April 18th. The patriot leaders were early aware\nthat some movement was on foot, and eager eyes watched for indications\nof its force and direction. But it was kept a profound secret, and it\nwas not until the troops were upon the march that their destination\ncould be guessed. Let the poet tell how the purpose was discovered and\nthe news carried to the country:",
        "  12. Listen, my children, and you shall hear\n  Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,\n  On the eighteenth of April, seventy-five.\n  Hardly a man is now alive\n  Who remembers that famous day and year.\n\n  13. He said to his friend, “If the British march\n  By land or sea from the town to-night,\n  Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch\n  In the North Church tower as a signal light–\n  One if by land, and two if by sea;\n  And I on the opposite shore will be,\n  Ready to ride and spread the alarm\n  Through every Middlesex village and farm,\n  For the country folk to be up and to arm.\"\n\n  14. Then he said “Good night!” and with muffled oar\n  Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,\n  Just as the moon rose over the bay,\n  Where, swinging wide at her moorings, lay\n  The Somerset, British man-of-war:\n  A phantom ship, with each mast and spar\n  Across the moon like a prison bar,\n  And a huge black hulk, that was magnified\n  By its own reflection in the tide.\n\n  15. Meanwhile his friend, through alley and street,\n  Watches and wanders, with eager ears,\n  Till in the silence around him he hears\n  The muster of men at the barrack door,\n  The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,\n  And the measured tread of the grenadiers,\n  Marching down to their boats on the shore.\n\n  16. Then he climbed the tower of the old North Church,\n  By the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,\n  To the belfry chamber overhead,\n  And startled the pigeons from their perch\n  On the somber rafters, that round him made\n  Masses and moving shapes of shade;\n  By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,\n  To the highest window in the wall,\n  Where he paused to listen and look down\n  A moment on the roofs of the town,\n  And the moonlight flowing over all.\n\n  17. Beneath in the churchyard lay the dead,\n  In their night-encampment on the hill,\n  Wrapped in a silence so deep and still\n  That he could hear, like a sentinel’s tread,\n  The watchful night-wind as it went\n  Creeping along from tent to tent,\n  And seeming to whisper “All is well!\"\n\n  18. A moment only he feels the spell\n  Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread\n  Of the lonely belfry and the dead;\n  For suddenly all his thoughts were bent\n  On a shadowy something far away,\n  Where the river widens to meet the bay–\n  A line of black that bends and floats\n  On the rising tide like a bridge of boats.\n\n  19. Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,\n  Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,\n  On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.\n  Now he patted his horse’s side,\n  Now gazed on the landscape far and near,\n  Then, impetuous, stamped the earth,\n  And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;\n  But mostly lie watched with eager search\n  The belfry-tower of the old North Church,\n  As it rose above the graves on the hill,\n  Lonely and spectral and somber and still.\n  And lo! as he looks, on the belfry’s height\n  A glimmer, and then a gleam of light.\n  He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,\n  But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight\n  A second lamp in the belfry burns.\n\n  20. A hurry of hoofs in the village street,\n  A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,\n  And beneath, from the pebbles in passing, a spark\n  Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet.\n  That was all! and yet, through the gloom and the light,\n  The fate of a nation was riding that night;\n  And the spark struck out by that steed in its flight\n  Kindled the land into flame with its heat.",
        "21. The British column moved on through the darkness with no sound\nsave the steady tread of marching feet. At first, farm-house and\nhamlet were wrapped in a deep repose, but as the night wore on signs\nof life began to appear. At every cross-road, horsemen galloped off at\ntheir approach, and hurried lights at chamber windows showed that\nslumber had been suddenly interrupted. At day-break the invading force\nreached Lexington, a little village twelve miles from Boston. Here\nminute-men to the number of about one hundred and twenty, aroused by\nthe cry of Paul Revere, had hastily assembled. They offered no\nopposition to the British troops, but stood silent spectators to the\nunusual sight.",
        "22. The British column halted, and Major Pitcairn rode forward, and,\nin the most peremptory tone of command, cried out: “Disperse, you\nrebels! Throw down your arms and disperse!” No one obeyed, and he\ngave the order to fire. Out blazed the muskets, and what remained of\nthe little group sought safety in flight. The British marched on,\nleaving on that peaceful common, under the very shadow of the church,\neight figures stark and motionless in death. From this baptism of\nblood they moved on, regretful, perhaps, at the stern necessity of\ntheir action, but rejoicing that all opposition had been so easily and\ncompletely overcome.",
        "23. On they sped. The sun arose in its glory to cheer them on their\nmarch. Their thoughts were jubilant as in fancy they posed as heroes\nbefore their fellows left behind. No vision of the dead men staring\nupward from the blood-drenched grass of Lexington haunted them. The\nsilent march of the night had ended, and now they could press onward\nwith clatter and song. The six miles to Concord were soon passed over.\nA strong guard was left at the bridge, for, with all his confidence,\nColonel Smith was a skillful commander, and would neglect no\nprecaution to secure the safety of his troops. So careful was he that\nhe sent back a secret messenger from Lexington for more men. On press\nthe exulting soldiers, on through the streets of Concord in search of\nthe military stores. But lo! they had taken wings and flown to a place\nof safety. A few barrels of flour, half destroyed, a, few hundred\ncannon-balls thrown into wells, was the sole outcome of the intended\ndestruction. The Committee of Safety had performed their duty\ndiscreetly and in time.",
        "24. But hark! What means that musketry? Not the scattering fire of a\nskirmish, but volley answering volley! Has the impossible come to\npass? Have the rebels dared to fire upon the king’s troops? But the\nfiring grows warmer, louder. Hasten to the bridge lest retreat be cut\noff! The guards, sore beset, welcome the aid. Armed foes spring up on\nevery side! They are behind, before–everywhere! No safety now but in\ninstant, rapid retreat.",
        "  25. “You know the rest. In the books you have read,\n  How the British regulars fired and fled–\n  How the farmers gave them ball for ball,\n  From behind each fence and farm-yard wall;\n  Chasing the red-coats down the lane,\n  Then crossing the fields, to emerge again\n  Under the trees, at the bend of the road,\n  And only pausing to fire and load.”",
        "26. Discipline and valor are of no avail here. Vollied musketry has\nlittle chance against backwoods sharpshooters occupying every\nvantage ground that their knowledge of the country enabled them to do.\nThe day was wearing on. Noon found them a disorganized mass, flying\nthrough Lexington streets, the scene of their morning victory.",
        "27. In the mean time Lord Percy, with eight hundred fresh troops and\ntwo field-pieces, is marching out on the Lexington road; not that any\ndanger was apprehended, but simply as a precautionary measure. Between\ntwo and three o’clock, while yet two miles short of Lexington, ominous\nsounds of conflict smote his ears: not the rolling volleys and stately\ntread of victory, but the confused noise of fight and flight,\nbetokening irretrievable disaster. The fresh troops were formed into a\nhollow square, and pell-mell the hunted fugitives came rushing into\ntheir place of refuge. Exhausted by their long march and hot fight,\nmany of them fell prone upon the ground, “their tongues,” says a high\nauthority, “hanging out of their mouths.”",
        "28. But Lord Percy must not delay. Ten miles lie between him and\nsafety, and many hours of day remain before darkness will lend its\nfriendly aid. Short time for rest. Beat off the fierce and persistent\nattacks! Speed away while yet unsurrounded! A British army must never\nsuffer the humiliation of defeat and capture by a horde of rebel\nYankees. So through the afternoon the red-coats marched quickly,\nsullenly, dejectedly, fighting desperately for very life. The day\nclosed as they neared the river, and under the starlight they\nembarked, finding safety and rest at last–not quite yet, for as the\nlast boat left the shore a rifle blazed out, and one more victim was\nsent to atone for the wanton murder on Lexington Common.",
        "29. The eventful day ended with a loss on the part of the British of\ntwo hundred and seventy-three, while the aggregate loss of the\npatriots was one hundred and five. Without discipline, and with the\nmost reckless exposure to danger, they had inflicted a loss nearly\nthree times as great as they had sustained.",
        "30. The news of Lexington spread, everywhere producing wild\nexcitement. The notes of warlike preparation were heard throughout the\nland. With deliberate purpose General Gage had sown the dragon’s\nteeth, and there literally sprung up a bountiful crop of armed men.\nEvery village and every farm-house helped to swell the number. The\nremotest hamlet furnished its contingent. In distant Connecticut,\ngallant old General Putnam heard the news while plowing. Prompt as\nwhen he dragged the wolf from its den, he unyoked his oxen, left his\nplow in the furrow, and, leaping to his saddle, galloped to the fray.\nFiery Ethan Allen, at the head of his Green Mountain Boys, was eager\nto march, but paused to execute that marvelous enterprise which\nsecured for the patriot cause the formidable fortresses of Ticonderoga\nand Crown Point, with all their military stores. Day by day the\nmultitude increased, until thirty thousand men were encamped around\nBoston, from Charlestown Neck to Dorchester.",
        "31. From the evening of the Lexington fight General Gage was shut up\nin Boston. The patriots kept a strict guard on every road, and no\nparties were permitted to pass out or provisions to pass in. All\nsupplies for the town came by sea. The officers chafed under the\nenforced inactivity. They would be done with the ignoble work of\ndefense behind fortifications. They longed for an opportunity to\nregain the prestige lost on that fatal nineteenth of April. But\nGeneral Gage was too wise a commander to risk the safety of his army,\nso he held the impatience of his officers in check and awaited events.",
        "32. The patriot leaders were equally impatient. The enthusiasm of the\nmoment must be turned to good account. The men were all unused to\nliving in camps, and were peculiarly exposed to camp diseases and camp\nvices. Discipline had not yet counteracted the demoralizing tendencies\nof army life. The different divisions of the army were ranged under\nfavorite local leaders, and while there was some show of order there\nwas little or no concert of action. It was now the middle of June. Two\nmonths had elapsed since Lord Percy was driven back into Boston. All\nmeans to lure General Gage from the town had failed, and an aggressive\nmovement was devised. It was resolved to take a new position\nthreatening the town and the shipping in the port. The place selected\nwas the highland on the Charlestown peninsula known as Bunker Hill,\nand the time fixed upon for the enterprise the night of June 16th.",
        "33. Eight hundred men armed with shovels and picks assembled at six\no’clock. The movement was known to be a perilous one, and every man\nfelt that he took his life in his hand. President Langdon, of Harvard\nCollege, offered prayer with the ancient Puritan fervor. Colonel\nPrescott took command of the military operations and Colonel Gridley\nconducted the engineering. In early evening they set out. The march\nwas in profound silence. With suppressed breathing and stealthy tread\nthey made their way–an army of ghosts entering the land of shadows.\nBut the grim faces of the officers and the clinched hands of the men\nshowed more than ghostly purpose. About midnight the march ceased.\nClear in the starlight they could see British ship and camp, and could\nhear the sentinel proclaim, “All is well.” A redoubt eight rods\nsquare was laid out, and these eight hundred husbandmen bent their\nseasoned muscles to the work. The embankment grew up in the darkness,\nand at day-break its six feet of height amply protected the workers\nwithin.",
        "34. In the American camp all was excitement and expectation.\nSupporting parties were organized, supplies hurried up, and means for\nre-enforcement and retreat provided. It was now that the fatal\nweakness of the patriot organization was made manifest. Different\nleaders had notions inconsistent with each other, and divided councils\nled to indecisive action. The brunt of the coming engagement was left\nto one tenth of the patriot forces. Scarred veterans scented the\nbattle from afar, and hastened to the front to share the danger and\nthe glory. With no command, officers were content to act as volunteers\nand handle muskets. Putnam, with military foresight, took charge of\nthe line of communication, and with true farmer instinct he converted\ntwo rail-fences and a field of new-mown hay into a line of serviceable\nbreastworks reaching across Charlestown Neck into the country.",
        "35. At day-break the astonished Britons gazed upon this vision of the\nnight. A moment’s pause, then instantaneous, rapid action. That\nnocturnal growth threatened their very lives. Those audacious and\ninsolent rebels must be swept from existence. Without orders the\nBoston battery at Copp’s Hill opened upon the redoubt as soon as it\nwas discovered. Ships in the bay poured in furious broadsides. The\ncannonade awoke Boston from her slumbers. Citizens half dressed rushed\ninto the streets. Every roof and steeple that commanded a view of the\nscene was soon crowded with anxious spectators, who remained there\nduring the livelong day. Patriot and royalist mingled, and fierce\npassions and wordy wars accompanied the progress of the conflict\noutside. Exultation at patriot success was often too great to be\nsuppressed, and wild cheers sounded from the house-tops and echoed\nthrough the streets.",
        "36. So passed the forenoon. The little band on the hill, protected by\nthe earth-works, worked on with speed and safety. The hurtling masses\nof iron aimed at their destruction either buried themselves in the\nyielding earth or passed overhead without injury. One man only paid\nwith his life the penalty of his curiosity in looking over the\nbreastworks. An early luncheon was served and then work again. But\neven iron muscles have their limit of endurance, and the earth-walls\ngrew less rapidly as the day wore on, until at high noon work\naltogether ceased.",
        "37. But what of the enemy! By this time they are aware of the\nuselessness of their cannonade. Other and stronger measures must be\ntaken, and that on the instant. The military renown gained on so many\nbattle-fields must not be lost in a conflict with rude peasants–the\nbest point of vantage in a general war must not be lost to the king.\nEvery sentiment of ambition and loyalty urged to action. A ship\ndropped down the river and took position to command Charlestown Neck.\nBut the rail-fence and the new-mown hay resisted the shock, and the\nAmerican line remained unturned. Rough old Putnam’s foresight became\nan important factor in the day’s conflict.",
        "38. Suddenly the drum’s loud beat and the shrill scream of the fife\nstartled all hearts into a fiercer life. The notes, with no tremor of\nfear, rang out sonorous, triumphant. For centuries such notes had led\nBritons to victory, and to-day British soldiers will do or die. Four\nthousand grenadiers, under Lord Howe, march down to the shore with the\nquick, elastic tread of soldiers upon a holiday excursion. In that\nresolute front and precision of movement there was little to raise the\nspirits or inspire hope in the hearts of the thousands of patriotic\nobservers who were watching the movements with feverish anxiety. In\nperfect order they embark, and in perfect order they land upon the\nCharlestown shore. In their advance toward the silent redoubt no line\nwavered and no step faltered, though every man was aware of the\nfearful peril before him.",
        "39. Within the little earth-work all was activity and expectation.\nPomeroy, Stark, Putnam came to help–not to dictate. At the last\nmoment General Warren, from the State Committee of Safety, unable to\nconceal his anxiety, came and took his place in the ranks. These\nofficers all outranked Colonel Prescott, but neither of them would\ntake the command from the officer who had proved himself capable and\nworthy of it. Shovels and picks gave place to rifles and muskets, and,\nas experienced eyes glanced along the death-dealing tubes, grave\nsmiles lit up rugged faces at the thought of the welcome the enemy\nwould soon receive. “Be steady! Be firm!” is the parting injunction of\nPutnam, as he takes his way to his command at the rail-fence. “We must\nconquer or die,” is the sentiment of Warren, as he grasps the musket\nof a common soldier, showing to the last that noble patriotism which\nmakes his name so dear to all who love their country. “Keep cool. Wait\nuntil you see the color of their eyes! Aim at their red coats. Pick\noff their commanders!” are the fiery last commands of Prescott, as the\nscarlet column moved up the hill. Each soldier is in place, each eye\nunflinchingly is fixed on the enemy, and each right hand is pressed\nupon the musket, ready for the supreme moment.",
        "40. The batteries, which had been covering the advancing columns,\nceased as they neared the summit. An ominous silence succeeded the\ntumult of the preceding hours. No sound is heard but the short, quick\nwords of command in the British ranks, and the steady tread of the\nmarching files. The space had diminished to a few rods, and still a\ngrave-like silence wrapped the redoubt. At the last moment had the\nhearts of the patriots failed? Did the near approach of the red-coats\ndeprive them of their courage? By the double-quick, forward march!\"\nrang out from the British lines. A sudden rush, and one deafening\nvolley! Was it lightning from heaven that struck down every man in\ntheir first rank? Was it the earthquake’s shock that left those long\nlines of dead heaped like grass before the mower’s scythe? The rear\nranks, paralyzed by the terrible disaster, held their ground, but no\nhuman courage could withstand the fire that blazed fierce and\nmerciless from the redoubt. A moment’s pause, and then a wild,\nheadlong flight to the sheltering boats on the shore.",
        "41. As shouts of triumph went up from thousands of sympathizing\nhearts, the contending forces were in a state of intense activity.\nWithin the breastworks Prescott, cool, deliberate, masterful, watched\nevery detail and directed every action. Warren, Stark, and Pomeroy put\nsoul into every movement. Putnam defended his own line, and sent the\ngood news outward to cheer the thousands who had taken no part in the\ncontest, and to urge immediate re-enforcements. In the British\nquarters new officers took the place of those who lay stretched on the\nhill-side; the men were rallied and reformed; new regiments came over\nfrom Boston, and again four thousand men breasted the hill and marched\nup to the breastworks with colors flying and drums beating. This time\nthey were permitted to come within the reach of friendly greeting,\nwhen again a solid sheet of flame leaped forth from the breastworks,\nagain covering the earth with the dead. The rear columns for a few\nmoments stood fast, but nothing could withstand that hail of shot\naimed to take life, and again they fled to the shore.",
        "42. The day was wearing on. It was now five o’clock. If the Americans\ncan hold on until the friendly darkness sets in, they may retain\npossession of Charlestown and force the British to evacuate Boston.\nGeneral Ward was at Cambridge, trying in vain to secure order in time\nfor action. General Knox ranged up and down the lines, frantically\nurging the men to follow him to the fray. Putnam, blazing with\nexcitement and fully comprehending the danger, was everywhere\nanimating and urging on the fresh troops. Now he sent almost frantic\nappeals for powder; now he implored the men in reserve to move at\nonce, and now he rallied his own men to repel the attack upon his own\nlines. A considerable force was at last rallied to march, but upon\nreaching Charlestown Neck the firing from the British ships was so\ndeadly that they dared not venture to cross. In the redoubt was the\ncourage of despair. The powder had given out, and for many of the\nmuskets only a single cartridge remained to meet the coming charge.\nBut all remained firm while the sun slowly sunk in the west.",
        "43. After their second repulse, the force under Lord Howe, cowed and\ndemoralized, refuse to again advance into the jaws of death. The idea\nis gaining ground that the rebel position is impregnable, and that a\nwise policy demands that no more blood shall be shed in a vain\nendeavor to reduce it. The impetuous Sir Henry Clinton refuses to take\nthis view of the situation, and his counsels are heeded. Every\nmilitary resource at the command of General Gage is now brought into\nrequisition. All the ships in the harbor are ordered to direct their\nfire upon the fort and the line of communication. New batteries are\nerected by competent engineers to sweep through the outer breastworks\nand render them untenable. The reserve forces are ordered up, and\nevery available man is in the ranks. The charge must now be made on\nevery side and the little band of eight hundred literally crushed by\nnumbers. All this and the final charge must be made within the few\nhours of remaining daylight, or British power is forever at an end in\nAmerica.",
        "41. At last all preparation ends and the time for action arrives. Shot\nfrom the new batteries drive the defenders with severe loss within\ntheir interior defenses. The advance of the swarming enemies is met\nwith a feeble, scattering fire in place of the volleyed death of the\nprevious charges. Showers of stones and blows from clubbed muskets\ngreet those who first mount the ramparts; but nothing could resist the\nlast desperate bayonet charge of the British. The defenders of the\nfort slowly and sullenly retired before the overwhelming numbers of\ntheir adversaries. At the last moment Major Pitcairn meets his death,\nand thus expiates as far as possible his bloody orders at Lexington.\nAt nearly the same moment General Warren, in the very rear of the\nretreating troops, is shot, sealing with his life his devotion to his\ncountry. That the retreating Americans were not annihilated was due to\nthe rail-fence of General Putnam, and to his skill in holding the\nenemy in check while the flying fugitives found safety in the country.",
        "45. The battle of Bunker Hill is ended. The cross of St. George flies\nover Prescott’s redoubt. Four hundred and fifty patriots and fifteen\nhundred Britons are killed, wounded, and missing.
