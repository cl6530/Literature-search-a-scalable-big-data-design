        "Spartacus, whose given name seems to have been torn off in its passage\ndown through the corridors of time, was born in Thrace and educated as a\nshepherd. While smearing the noses of the young lambs with tar one spring,\nin order to prevent the snuffies among them, he thought that he would\nbecome a robber. It occurred to him that this calling was the only one he\nknew of that seemed to be open to the young man without means.",
        "He had hardly got started, however, in the “hold up” industry, when he was\ncaptured by the Romans, sold at cost and trained as a gladiator, in a\nschool at Capua. Here he succeeded in stirring up a conspiracy and uniting\ntwo hundred or more of the grammar department of the school in a general\nruction, as it was then termed.",
        "The scheme was discovered and only seventy of the number escaped, headed\nby Spartacus. These snatched cleavers from the butcher shops, pickets from\nthe Roman fences and various other weapons, and with them fought their way\nto the foot hill where they met a wagon train loaded with arms and\nsupplies. They secured the necessary weapons whereby to go into a general\nwar business and established themselves in the crater of Mount Vesuvius.",
        "Spartacus was a man of wonderful carriage and great physical strength. It\nhad always been his theory that a man might as well die of old age as to\nfeed himself to a Roman menagerie. He maintained that he would rather die\nin a general free fight, where he had a chance, than to be hauled around\nover the arena by one leg behind a Numidian lion.",
        "So he took his little band and fought his way to Vesuvius. There they had\na pleasant time camping out nights and robbing the Roman’s daytimes. The\nexcitement of sleeping in a crater, added a wonderful charm to their\nlives. While others slept cold in Capua, Spartacus cuddled up to the\ncrater and kept comfortable.",
        "For a long time the little party had it all their own way. They sniffed\nthe air of freedom and lived on Roman spring chicken on the half shell,\nand it beat the arena business all hollow.",
        "At last, however, an army of 3,000 men was sent against them, and\nSpartacus awoke one morning to find himself blocked up in his crater. For\na time the outlook was not cheering. Spartacus thought of telegraphing the\nwar department for reinforcements, but finally decided not to do so.",
        "Finally, with ladders made of wild vines, the little garrison slipped out\nthrough what had seemed an impassable fissure in the crater, got in the\nrear of the army and demolished it completely. That’s the kind of man that\nSpartacus was. Fighting was his forte.",
        "Spartacus was also a good public speaker. One of his addresses to the\ngladiators has been handed down to posterity through the medium of the\nFifth Reader, a work that should be in every household. In his speech he\nstates that he was not always thus. But since he is thus, he believes that\nhe has not yet been successfully outthussed by any body.",
        "He speaks of his early life in the citron groves of Syrsilla, and how\nquiet and reserved he had been, never daring to say “gosh” within a mile\nof the house; but finally how the Romans landed on his coast and killed\noff his family. Then he desired to be a fighter. He had killed more lions\nthan any other man in Italy. He kept a big crew of Romans busy, winter and\nsummer, catching fresh lions for him to stick. He had killed a large\nnumber of men also. At one matinee for ladies and children he had killed a\nprominent man from the north, and had done it so fluently that he was\nencored three times. The stage manager then came forward and asked that\nthe audience would please refrain from another encore as he had run out of\nmen, but if the ladies and children would kindly attend on the following\nSaturday he hoped to be prepared with a good programme. In fact, he had\njust heard from his agent who wrote him that they had purchased two big\nlions and also had a robust gladiator up a tree. He hoped that he could\nget into town in a day or two with both attractions.",
        "Spartacus finally stood at the head of an army of 100,000 men, all\nstarting out from the little band of 70 that cut loose from Capua with\nborrowed cleavers and axhandles. This war lasted but two years, during\nwhich time Spartacus made Rome howl. Spartacus had too much sense to\nattack Rome. But at last his army was betrayed and disorganized. With\nnothing but death or capture for him, he rode out between the two\ncontending armies, shot his war horse in order to save expenses, and on\nfoot rushed into the thickest of the fight. This was positively his last\nappearance. He killed a large number of people, but at last he yielded to\nthe great pressure that was brought to bear upon him and died.",
        "Probably no man not actually engaged in the practice of medicine ever\nkilled so many people as Spartacus. He did not kill them because he\ndisliked them personally, but because he thought it advisable to do so.\nHad he lived till the present time he would have done well as a lecturer.\n\"Ten Years in the Arena, with Illustrations,” would draw first-rate at\nthis time among a certain class of people. The large number of people\nstill living in this country, who will lay aside their work and go twenty\nmiles to attend a funeral, no matter whose funeral it is, would, no doubt,\nenjoy a bull fight or the cairn and refining joy that hovered over the\narena. Those who have paid $175,000 to see Colonel John L. Sullivan\ndisfigure a friend, would, no doubt, have made it $350,000 if the victim\ncould have been killed and dragged around over the ring by the leg.",
        "Two thousand years have not refined us so much that we need be puffed up\nwith false pride about it.",
        "“Amateur” writes me that he is about to publish a book, and asks me if I\nwill be kind enough to suggest some good, reliable publisher for him.",
        "This would suggest that “Amateur” wishes to confer his book on some\ndeserving publisher with a view to building him up and pouring a golden\nstream of wealth into his coffers. “Amateur” already, in his mind’s eye,\nsees the eager millions of readers knocking each other down and trampling\nupon one another in the mad rush for his book. In my mind, I see his eye,\nlighted up with hope, and, though he lives in New Jersey, I fancy I can\nhear his quickened breath as his bosom heaves.",
        "Evidently he has never published a book. There is a good deal of fun ahead\nof him that he does not wot of. I used to think that when I got the last\npage of my book ready for press, the front yard would be full of\npublishers tramping down the velvet lawn and the meek-eyed pansies in\ntheir crazy efforts to get hold of the manuscript, but when I had written\nthe last word of my first volume of soul-throb, and had opened the\ncasement to look out on the howling, hungry mob of publishers, with\ncheckbooks in one hand and a pillow-case full of scads in the other, I was\na little puzzled to notice the abrupt and pronounced manner in which they\nwere not there.",
        "All of us have to struggle before we can catch the eye of the speaker.\nMilton didn’t get one-fiftieth as much for “Paradise Lost” as I got for my\nfirst book, and yet you will find people to-day who claim that if Milton\nhad lived he could have knocked the socks off of me with one hand tied\nbehind him. Recollect, however, that I am not here to open a discussion on\nthis matter. Everyone is entitled to his own opinion in relation to\nauthors. People cannot agree on the relative merits of literature. Now,\nfor instance, last summer I met a man over in South Park, Col., who could\nrepeat page after page of Shakespeare, and yet, when I asked him if he was\nfamiliar with the poems of the “Sweet Singer of Michigan,” he turned upon\nme a look of stolid vacancy, and admitted that he had never heard of her\nin his life.",
        "The old Greeley Colony in Colorado, a genuine oasis in the desert, with\nits huge irrigating canals of mountain water running through the mighty\nwheat fields, glistening each autumn at the base of the range, affords a\ngood deal that is curious, not only to the mind of the gentleman from the\nStates, but even to the man who lives at Cheyenne, W.T., only a few hours’\njourney to the north.",
        "You could hardly pick out two cities so near each other and yet so unlike\nas Cheyenne and Greeley. The latter is quiet, and even accused of being\ndull, and yet everybody is steadily getting rich. It is a town of readers,\nthinkers and mental independents. It is composed of the elements of New\nEngland shrewdness and Western push, yet Greeley as compared with Cheyenne\nwould be called a typical New England town in the midst of the active,\nfluctuating, booming West.",
        "Cheyenne is not so tame. With few natural advantages the reputation of\nCheyenne is that, in commercial parlance, she is “A 1” for promptness in\npaying her debts and absence of failures. There is more wealth there in\nproportion to the number of inhabitants than elsewhere in the civilized\nworld, no doubt. The people take special pleasure in surprising Eastern\npeople who visit them by a reception very often that they will long\nremember for cordiality, hospitality, and even magnificence.",
        "Still I didn’t start out to write up either Cheyenne or Greeley. I\nintended to mention casually Dr. Law, of the latter place, who acted as my\nphysician for a few months and coaxed me back from the great hereafter. I\nhad been under the hands of a physician just before, who was also coroner,\nand who, I found afterward, was trying to treat me professionally as long\nas the lamp held out to burn, intending afterward to sit upon me\nofficially. He had treated me professionally until he was about ready to\nsummon his favorite coroner’s jury. Then I got irritated and left the\ncounty of his jurisdiction.",
        "Learning that Dr. Law was relying solely on the practice of medicine for a\nlivelihood, I summoned him, and after explaining the great danger that\nstood in the way of harmonizing the practice of medicine and the official\nwork of the inquest business, I asked him if he had any business\nconnection with any undertaking establishment or hic jacet business, and\nlearning from him that he had none, I engaged him to solder up my\nvertebrae and reorganize my spinal duplex.",
        "Sometimes it isn’t entirely the medicine you swallow that paralyzes pain\nso much as it is the quiet magnetism of a good story and the snap of a\npleasant eye. I had one physician who tried to look joyous when he came\ninto the room, but he generally asked me to run my tongue out till he\ncould see where it was tied on, then he would feel my pulse with his cold\nfinger and time it with a $6 watch, and after that he would write a new\nprescription for horse medicine and heave a sigh, look at me as he might\nif it had been the last time he ever expected to see me on earth, and then\nhe would sigh and go away. When he came back he generally looked shocked\nand grieved to find me alive. This was the pro tem physician and\nex-officio coroner. I always felt as though I ought to apologize to him\nfor clinging to life so, when no doubt he had the jury in the hall waiting\nto “view” me.",
        "Dr. Law used to tell me of the early history of the Greeley Colony, and\nhow the original cranks of the community used to be in session most of the\ntime, and how they sometimes neglected to do their planting to do\nlegislating, and how they overdid the council work and neglected to “bug\"\ntheir potatoes. I remember, also, of his description of how the crew,\nworking on the original big irrigating canal, struck when it was about\nhalf done, and swore that from the Poudre the ditch was going to run up\nhill, and would, therefore, be a failure. The engineer didn’t know at\nfirst what was best to do with the belligerent laborers, but finally he\ntook the leader away from the rest of the crew and said, “Now, I tell you\nthis in confidence, because of course I know perfectly well that the\nstockholders may kick on it if they hear it, but I’m building the blamed\nthing as level as I can and putting one end of it in the Poudre and one\nend in the Platte. Now, if I’m building it up hill the water’ll run down\nfrom the Platte into the Poudre, and if not it’ll run from the Poudre into\nthe Platte. Sabe?”",
        "The ditch was built, and now a deep, still river runs from the Poudre to\nthe Platte, according to advertisement.",
        "Greeley is also noted for its watchmakers. I sent my watch to the first\none I heard of, and he said it needed cleaning. He cleaned it. I paid him\n$2 and took it home, when it ran two hours and then suspended. Then I took\nit to another watchmaker who said that the first man had used machine oil\non its works, and had heated the wheels so as to gum the oil on the cogs.\nHe would have to eradicate the cooked oil from the watch, and it would\ncost me $3. I paid it, and joyfully took the watch home. The next day I\nfound that it had gained time enough to pay for itself. By noon, it had\nfatigued itself so that it was losing terribly, and by the day following\nhad folded its still hands across its pale face in the sleep that knows no\nwaking. I took it to the third and last jeweler in the town. Everyone said\nhe was a good workman, but a trifle slow. In the afternoon I went in to\nsee how he was getting along with it. He was sitting at his bench with a\ndice cup in his eye, apparently looking into the digestive economy of the\nwatch.",
        "I looked at him some time, not wishing to disturb him and interfere with\nhis diagnosis. He did not move or say anything. Several people came in to\ntrade and get the correct time, but he paid no attention to them.",
        "I got tired and changed from one foot to the other several times. Then I\nasked him how he got along, or something of that kind, but he never opened\nhis head. He was the most preoccupied watch savant I ever saw. No outside\ninfluence could break up his chain of thought when he got after a diseased\nwatch.",
        "I finally got around on the outside of the shop and looked in the window,\nwhere I could get a good view of his face.",
        "He was asleep.",
        "My name is Kaulbach. William J. Kaulbach is my name, and I am spending the\nsummer in Canada. I may remain here during the winter, also. My parents\nare very poor. They had never been wealthy, and at the time of my birth\nthey were even less wealthy than they had been before. As soon as I was\nborn the poverty of my parents attracted my attention. I decided at once\nto relieve their distress. I intended to aid them from my own pocket, but\nfound upon examination that I had no funds in my pocket; also, no pocket;\nalso, no place to put a pocket if I had brought one with me. So my parents\ncontinued to be poor, and to put by a little poverty for a rainy day. I\nwas sole heir to the poverty they had acquired in all these years.",
        "Nature did not do much for me in the way of beauty, either. I was quite\nplain when born and may still be identified by that peculiarity. Plainess\nwith me is not only a characteristic, but it is a passion. My whole being\nis wrapped up in it. My hair is a sort of neutral brindle, such as grows\nupon the top of a retired hair trunk, and my freckles are olive green,\nfading into a delicate, crushed-bran color. They are very large, and\nactually pain me at times.",
        "My teacher tried to encourage me by telling me of other poor boys who had\ngrown up to be president of the United States, and he tried to get me to\nconsent to having my name used as a candidate; but I refrained from doing\nso. I knew that, although I was deserving of the place, I could not endure\nthe bitterness of a campaign, and that the illustrated papers would\nenlarge upon my personal appearance and bring out my freckles till you\ncould hang your hat on them.",
        "So I grew up to be a stage robber.",
        "When I have my mask on my freckles do not show. I lectured on phrenology\nat first to get means to prosecute my studies as a stage robber, and when\nI had perfected myself as a burglar I went abroad to study the methods of\nthe Italian banditti. I was two years under the teaching of the old\nmasters, and acquired great fluency as a robber while there. I studied\nfrom nature all the time, and some of my best work was taken from life. I\nhad an opportunity to observe all the methods of the most celebrated\ngarroting maestro and stilletto virtuoso. He was an enthusiast and\nthoroughly devoted to his art. He had a large price on his head, also.\nAside from that he went bareheaded winter and summer.",
        "Finally I returned to my own native land, poor, but fired with a mighty\nambition. I went west and proceeded at once to debut. I went west to\nhold up the country. I was very successful, indeed, and have had my hands\nin the pockets of our most eminent men.",
        "We were isolated from society a good deal, but we met the better class of\npeople now and then in the course of our business. I did not like so much\nnight work, and sometimes we had to eat raw pork because we did not wish\nto build a fire that would attract mosquitoes and sheriffs. So we were\nliable more or less to trichina and insomnia, but still we were free from\nsewer gas and poll tax. We did not get our mail with much regularity, but\nwe got a lick at some mighty fine scenery.",
        "But all this is only incidental. What I desired to say was this: Fame and\ndistinction come high, and when we have them in our grasp at last we find\nthat they bring their resultant sorrows. I worked long and hard for fame,\nand sat up nights and rode through alkali dust for thousands of miles,\nthat I might be known as the leading robber of the age in which I lived,\nonly to find at last that my great fame was the source of my chief\nannoyance. It made me so widely known that I felt, as Christine Nilsson\nsays, “as though I lived in a glass case.” Everyone wanted to see me.\nEveryone wanted my autograph. Everyone wanted my skeleton to hang up in\nthe library.",
        "I could have traveled with a show and drawn a large salary, but I hated to\nwear a boiler iron overcoat all through the hot weather, after having\nlived so wild and free. But all this attention worried me so that I could\nnot sleep, and many a night I would arise from the lava bed on which I had\nreclined, and putting on my dressing-gown and slippers, I would wander\nabout under the stars and wish that I could be an unknown boy again in my\nfar away home. But I could not. I often wished that I could die a natural\ndeath, but that was out of the question.",
        "Finally, it got so that I did not dare to take a chew of tobacco, unless I\ndid so under an assumed name. I hardly dared to let go of my six-shooter\nlong enough to wipe my nose, for fear that someone might get the drop on\nme.",
        "That is the reason why I came to Canada. Here among so many criminals, I\ndo not attract attention, but I use a nom de plume all the time, even\nhere, and all these hot nights, while others take off their clothing, I\nlie and swelter in my heavy winter nom de plume.",
        "At this season of the year, we are forcibly struck with the earnest and\nhonest effort that is being made by the publisher of the American\nnewspaper. It is a healthy sign and a hopeful one for the future of our\ncountry. It occurs to me that with the great advancement of the newspaper,\nand the family paper, and the magazine, we do not expect leaders and\nstatesmen to think for us so much as we did fifty years ago. We do not\nallow the newspaper to mold us so much as we did. We enjoy reading the\nopinion of a bright, brave, and cogent editor because we know that he sits\nwhere he can acquire his facts in a few hours from all quarters of the\nglobe, and speak truly to his great audience in relation to those facts,\nbut we have ceased to allow even that man to think for us.",
        "What then is to be the final outcome of all this? Is it not that the\naverage American is going to use, and is using, his thinker more than he\never did before? Will not that thinker then, like the muscle of the\nblacksmith’s arm, or the mule’s hind foot, grow to a wondrous size as a\nresult? Most assuredly.",
        "The day certainly is not far distant, when the American can not only\nout-fight, out-row, out-bat, out-run, out-lie, and out-sail all other\nnationalities; but he will also be able to out-think them. We already\npoint with pride to some of the wonderful thoughts that our leading\nthinkists, with their thinkers, have thunk. There are native born\nAmericans now living, who have thought of things that would make the head\nof the amateur thinker ache for a week.",
        "All this is largely due to the free use of the newspaper as a home\neducator. The newspaper is growing more and more ubiquitous, if I may be\nallowed the expression. Many poor people, who, a few years ago, could not\nafford the newspaper, now have it scolloped and put it on their pantry\nshelves every year.",
        "But I did not start out to enlarge upon the newspaper. I would like to say\na word or two more, however, on that general subject. Very often we hear\nsome wise man with the responsibility of the universe on his shoulders, the\nman who thinks he is the censor of the human race now, and that he will be\nforeman of the grand jury on the Judgment Day–we hear this kind of man\nsay every little while:",
        "“We’ve got too many papers. We are loaded down with reading matter. Can’t\nread all my paper every day. Lots of days I throw my paper aside before I\nget it all read through, and never have a chance to finish it. All that is\ndead loss.”",
        "It is, of course, a dead loss to that kind of a man. He is the kind of man\nthat expects his family to begin at one side of the cellar and eat right\nstraight across, it–cabbages, potatoes, turnips, pickles, apples,\npumpkins, etc., etc.,–without stopping to discriminate. There are none\ntoo many papers, so far as the subscriber is concerned. Looking at it from\nthe publisher’s standpoint sometimes, there are too many.",
        "To the man who has inherited too large, wide, sinewy hands, and a brain\nthat under the microscope looks like a hepatized lung, it seems some days\nas though the field had been over-crowded when he entered it. To the young\nman who was designed to maul rails or sock the fence-post into the bosom\nof the earth, and who has evaded that sphere of action and disregarded the\nmandate to maul rails, or to take a coal-pick and toy with the bowels of\nthe earth, hoping to win an easier livelihood by feeding sour paste to\nvillage cockroaches, and still poorer pabulum to his subscribers, the\nnewspaper field seems to be indeed jam full.",
        "But not so the man who is tall enough to see into the future about nine\nfeet. He still remembers that he must live in the hearts of his\nsubscribers, and he makes their wants his own. He is not to proud to\nlisten to suggestions from the man who works. He recognizes that it is not\nthe man with the diamond-mounted stomach who has contributed most to his\nsuccess, but the man who never dips into society much with the exception\nof his family, perhaps, and that ought to be good society. A man ought not\nto feel too good to associate with his wife and children. Generally my\nsympathies are with his wife and children, if they have to associate with\nhim very much.",
        "But if I could ever get down to it, I would like to say a word on behalf\nof the old subscriber. Being an old subscriber myself, I feel an interest\nin his cause; and as he rarely rushes into print except to ask why the\npolice contrive to keep aloof from anything that might look like a fight,\nor to inquire why the fire department will continue year after year to run\nthrough the streets killing little children who never injured the\ndepartment in any way, just so that they will be in time to chop a hole in\nthe roof of a house that is not on fire, and pour some water down into the\nlibrary, then whoop through an old tin dipper a few times and go away–as\nthe old subscriber does not generally say much in print except on the\nabove subjects, I make bold to say on his behalf that as a rule, he is not\ntreated half as well as the prodigal son, who has been spending his\nsubstance on a rival paper, or stealing his news outright from the old\nsubscriber.",
        "Why should we pat the new subscriber on the back, and give him a new album\nthat will fall to pieces whenever you laugh in the same room? Why should\nyou forget the old love for the new? Do we not often impose on the old\nsubscriber by giving up the space he has paid for to flaming\nadvertisements to catch the coy and skittish gudgeon who still lurks\noutside the fold? Do we not ofttimes offer a family Bible for a new\nsubscriber when an old subscriber may be in a lost and undone state?",
        "Do we not again and again offer to the wife of our new subscriber a\nbeautiful, plain gold ring, or a lace pin for a year’s subscription and\n$1, while the wife of our old subscriber is just in the shank of a long,\nhard, cold winter, without a ring or a pin to her back?",
        "We ought to remember that the old subscriber came to us with his money\nwhen we most needed it. He bore with us when we were new in the business,\nand used such provincialisms as “We have saw” and “If we had knew.” He\nbore with us when the new column rules were so sharp that they chawed the\npaper all up, and the office was so cold, waiting for wood to come in on\nsubscription, that the “color” was greasy and reluctant. He took our paper\nand paid for it, while the new subscriber was in the penitentiary for all\nwe know. He made a mild kick sometimes when he “didn’t git his paper\nreggler;” but he paid on the first day of January every year in advance,\nout of an old calfskin wallet that opened out like a concertina, and had a\nstrap that went around it four times, and looked as shiny, and sweaty, and\ngood-natured as the razor-strop that might have been used by Noah.",
        "The old subscriber never asked any rebate, or requested a prize volume of\npoetry with a red cover, because he had paid for another year; but he\nsimply warmed his numb fingers, so that he could loosen his overalls and\nlower one side enough to let his hand into the pocket of his best\npantaloons underneath, and there he always found the smooth wallet, and\ninside of it there was always a $2 bill, that had been put there to pay\nfor the paper. Then the old subscriber would warm his hands some more, ask\n\"How’s tricks?” but never begin to run down the paper, and then he would\ngo away to work for another year.",
        "I want to say that this country rests upon a great, solid foundation of\nold, paid-up subscribers. They are the invisible, rock-ribbed\nresting-place for the dazzling superstructure and the slim and peaked\nspire. Whether we procure a new press or a new dress, a new contributor or\na new printers’ towel, we must bank on the old subscriber; for the new one\nis fickle, and when some other paper gives him a larger or a redder\ncovered book, he may desert our standard. He yearns for the flesh-pots and\nthe new scroll saws of other papers. He soon wearies of a uniformly good\npaper, with no chance to draw a town lot or a tin mine–in Montana.",
        "Let us, therefore, brethren of the press, cling to the old subscriber as\nhe has clung to us. Let us say to him, on this approaching Christmas Eve,\n\"Son, thou art always with me, and all that I have is thine. It was meet\nthat we should make merry, that this, thy brother, who had been a\nsubscriber for our vile contemporary many years, but is alive again, and\nduring a lucid interval has subscribed for our paper; but, after all, we\nwould not go to him if we wanted to borrow a dollar. Remember that you\nstill have our confidence, and when we want a good man to indorse our note\nat the bank, you will find that your name in our memory is ever fresh and\ngreen.”",
        "Looking this over, I am struck with the amount of stuff I have\nsuccessfully said, and yet there is a paucity of ideas. Some writers would\nnot use the word paucity in this place without first knowing the meaning\nof it, but I am not that way. There are thousands of words that I now use\nfreely, but could not if I postponed it until I could learn their meaning.\nTimidity keeps many of our authors back, I think. Many are more timid\nabout using big words than they are about using other people’s ideas.",
        "A friend of mine wanted to write a book, but hadn’t the time to do it. So\nhe asked me if I wouldn’t do it for him. He was very literary, he said,\nbut his business took up all his time, so I asked him what kind of a book\nhe wanted. He said he wanted a funny book, with pictures in it and a blue\ncover. I saw at once that he had fine literary taste and delicate\ndiscrimination, but probably did not have time to give it full swing. I\nasked him what he thought it would be worth to write such a book. “Well,\"\nhe said, he had always supposed that I enjoyed it myself, but if I thought\nI ought to have pay besides, he would be willing to pay the same as he did\nfor his other writing–ten cents a folio.",
        "He is worth $50,000, because he has documentary evidence to show that a\nman who made that amount out of deceased hogs, had the misfortune to be\nhis father and then die.",
        "It was a great triumph to be born under such circumstances, and yet the\nyoung man lacks the mental stamina necessary to know how to successfully\neat common mush and milk in such a low key that will not alarm the police.",
        "I use this incident more as an illustration than anything else. It\nillustrates how anything may be successfully introduced into an article of\nthis kind without having any bearing whatever upon it.",
        "I like to close a serious essay, or treatise, with some humorous incident,\nlike the clown in the circus out West last summer, who joked along through\nthe performance all the afternoon till two or three children went into\nconvulsions, and hypochondria seemed to reign rampant through the tent.\nAll at once a bright idea struck him. He climbed up on the flying trapeze,\nfell off, and broke his neck. He was determined to make that audience\nlaugh, and he did it at last. Every one felt repaid for the trouble of\ngoing to the circus.",
        "I have owned quite a number of dogs in my life, but they are all dead now.\nLast evening I visited my dog cemetery–just between the gloaming and the\nshank of the evening.

        "LITTLE KOSCIUSKO,\n–NOT DEAD,–\nBUT JERKED HENCE\nBy Request.\nS.Y.L.\n(See you Later.)",
        "I do not know why he was called Kosciusko. I do not care. I only know that\nhis little grave stands out there while the gloaming gloams and the\nsoughing winds are soughing.",
        "Do you ask why I am alone here and dogless in this weary world?",
        "I will tell you, anyhow. It will not take long, and it may do me good:",
        "Kosciusko came to me one night in winter, with no baggage and\nunidentified. When I opened the door he came in as though he had left\nsomething in there by mistake and had returned for it.",
        "He stayed with us two years as a watch-dog. In a desultory way, he was a\ngood watch-dog. If he had watched other people with the same unrelenting\nscrutiny with which he watched me, I might have felt his death more keenly\nthan I do now.",
        "The second year that little Kosciusko was with us, I shaved off a full\nbeard one day while down town, put on a clean collar and otherwise\ndisguised myself, intending to surprise my wife.",
        "Kosciusko sat on the front porch when I returned. He looked at me as the\ncashier of a bank does when a newspaper man goes in to get a suspiciously\nlarge check cashed. He did not know me. I said, “Kosciusko, have you\nforgotten your master’s voice?”",
        "He smiled sarcastically, showing his glorious wealth of mouth, but still\nsat there as though he had stuck his tail into the door-steps and couldn’t\nget it out.",
        "So I waived the formality of going in at the front door, and went around\nto the portcullis, on the off side of the house, but Kosciusko was there\nwhen I arrived. The cook, seeing a stranger lurking around the manor\nhouse, encouraged Kosciusko to come and gorge himself with a part of my\nleg, which he did. Acting on this hint I went to the barn. I do not know\nwhy I went to the barn, but somehow there was nothing in the house that I\nwanted. When a man wants to be by himself, there is no place like a good,\nquiet barn for thought. So I went into the barn, about three feet prior to\nKosciusko.",
        "Noticing the stairway, I ascended it in an aimless kind of way, about four\nsteps at a time. What happened when we got into the haymow I do not now\nrecall, only that Kosciusko and I frolicked around there in the hay for\nsome time. Occasionally I would be on top, and then he would have all the\ndelegates, until finally I got hold of a pitchfork, and freedom shrieked\nwhen Kosciusko fell. I wrapped myself up in an old horse-net and went into\nthe house. Some of my clothes were afterward found in the hay, and the\ndoctor pried a part of my person out of Kosciusko’s jaws, but not enough\nto do me any good.",

        "Railroads have made the Rocky Mountain country familiar and contiguous, I\nmay say, to the whole world; but the somber canon, the bald and blackened\ncliff, the velvety park and the snowy, silent peak that forever rests\nagainst the soft, blue sky, are ever new. The foamy green of the torrent\nhas whirled past the giant walls of nature’s mighty fortress myriads of\nyears, perhaps, and the stars have looked down into the great heart of\nearth for centuries, where the silver thread of streams, thousands of feet\nbelow, has been patiently carving out the dark canon where the eagle and\nthe solemn echo have their home.",
        "I said this to a gentleman from Leadville a short time ago as we toiled up\nKenoska Hill, between Platte canon and the South Park, on the South Park\nand Pacific Railway. He said that might be true in some cases and even\nmore so, perhaps, depending entirely on whether it would or not.",
        "I do not believe at this moment that he thoroughly understood me. He was\nonly a millionaire and his soul, very likely, had never throbbed and\nthrilled with the mysterious music nature yields to her poet child.",
        "He could talk on and on of porphyry walls and contact veins, gray copper\nand ruby silver, and sulphurets and pyrites of iron, but when my eye\nkindled with the majestic beauty of these eternal battlements and my voice\ntrembled a little with awe and wonder; while my heart throbbed and\nthrilled in the midst of nature’s eloquent, golden silence, this man sat\nthere like an Etruscan ham and refused to throb or thrill. He was about as\nunsatisfactory a throbber and thriller as I have met for years.",
        "At an elevation of over 10,000 feet above high water mark, Fahrenheit, the\nSouth Park, a hundred miles long, surrounded by precipitous mountains or\ngreen and sloping foot-hills, burst upon us, In the clear, still air, a\nhundred miles away, at Pueblo, I could hear a promissory note and\ncut-throat mortgage drawing three per cent a month. So calm and unruffled\nwas the rarified air that I fancied I could hear the thirteenth assessment\non a share of stock at Leadville toiling away at the bottom of a two\nhundred and fifty foot shaft.",

        "Colonel Wade is a reformed temperance lecturer. I went to his shop to get\nshaved, but he was absent. I could smell hair oil through the keyhole, but\nthe Colonel was not in his slab-inlaid emporium. He had been preparing\nanother lecture on temperance, and was at that moment studying the habits\nof his adversary at a neighboring gin palace. I sat down on the steps and\ndevoured the beautiful landscape till he came. Then I sat down in the\nchair, and he hovered over me while he talked about an essay he had\nwritten on the flowing bowl. His arguments were not so strong as his\nbreath seemed to be. I asked him if he wouldn’t breathe the other way\nawhile and let me sober up. I learned afterward that although his nose was\nred, his essay was not.",
        "He would shave me for a few moments, and then he would hone the razor on\nhis breath and begin over again. I think he must have been pickling his\nlungs in alcohol. I never met a more pronounced gin cocktail symphony and\nbologna sausage study in my life.",

        "I went over the mountains to Breckenridge the next day, climbed two miles\nperpendicularly into the sky, rode on a special train one day, a push car\nthe next and a narrow-gauge engine the next. Saw all the beauty of the\ncountry, in charge of Superintendent Smith, went over to Buena Vista and\nhad a congestion of the spine and a good time generally. You can leave\nDenver on a morning train and see enough wild, grand, picturesque\nloveliness before supper, to store away in your heart and hang upon the\nwalls of memory, to last all through your busy, humdrum life, and it is a\ngood investment, too.",
        "This name is from two Greek words which signify “arrangement” and “skin,\"\nso that the ancient Greeks, no doubt, regarded taxidermy as the original\nskin-game of that period. Taxidermy did not flourish in America prior to\nthe year 1828. At that time an Englishman named Scudder established a\nmuseum and general repository for upholstered beasts.",
        "Since then the art has advanced quite rapidly. To properly taxiderm,\nrequires a fine taste and a close study of the subject itself in life,\nakin to the requirements necessary in order to succeed as a sculptor. I\nhave seen taxidermed animals that would not fool anybody. I recall, at\nthis time especially, a mountain lion, stuffed after death by a party who\nhad not made this matter a subject of close study. The lion was\nrepresented in a crouching attitude, with open jaws and red gums. As time\npassed on and year succeeded year, this lion continued to crouch. His tail\nbecame less rampant and drooped like a hired man on a hot day. His gums\nbecame less fiery red and his reddish skin hung over his bones in a loose\nand distraught manner, like an old buffalo robe thrown over the knees of a\nvinegary old maid. Spiders spun their webs across his dull, white fangs.\nMice made their nests in his abdominal cavity. His glass eye became\nhopelessly strabismussed, and the moths left him bald-headed on the\nstomach. He was a sad commentary on the extremely transitory nature of all\nthings terrestrial and the hollowness of the stuffed beast.",
        "I had a stuffed bird for a long time, which showed the cunning of the\nstuffer to a great degree. It afforded me a great deal of unalloyed\npleasure, because I liked to get old hunters to look at it and tell me\nwhat kind of a bird it was. They did not generally agree. A bitter and\nacrimonious fight grew out of a discussion in relation to this bird. A man\nfrom Vinegar Hill named Lyons and a party called Soiled Murphy (since\ndeceased), were in my office one morning–Mr. Lyons as a witness, and Mr.\nMurphy in his great specialty as a drunk and disorderly. We had just\ndisposed of the case, and had just stepped down from the bench, intending\nto take off the judicial ermine and put some more coal in the stove, when\nthe attention of Soiled Murphy was attracted to the bird. He allowed that\nit was a common “hell-diver with an abnormal head,” while Lyons claimed\nthat it was a kingfisher.",
        "The bird had a duck’s body, the head of a common eagle and the feet of a\nsage hen. These parts had been adjusted with great care and the tail\nloaded with lead somehow, so that the powerful head would not tip the bird\nup behind. With this rara avis, to use a foreign term, I loved to amuse\nand instruct old hunters, who had been hunting all their lives for a free\ndrink, and hear them tell how they had killed hundred of these birds over\non the Poudre in an early day, or over near Elk Mountain when the country\nwas new.",
        "So Lyons claimed that he had killed millions of these fowls, and Soiled\nMurphy, who was known as the tomato can and beer-remnant savant of that\ncountry, said that before the Union Pacific Railroad got into that\nsection, these birds swarmed around Hutton’s lakes and lived on horned\ntoads.",
        "The feeling got more and more partisan till Mr. Lyons made a pass at\nSoiled Murphy with a large red cuspidor that had been presented to me by\nValentine Baker, a dealer in abandoned furniture and mines. Mr. Murphy\nthen welted Lyons over the head with the judicial scales. He then adroitly\ncaught a lump of bituminous coal with his countenance and fell to the\nfloor with a low cry of pain.",
        "I called in an outside party as a witness, and in the afternoon both men\nwere convicted of assault and battery. Soiled Murphy asked for a change of\nvenue on the ground that I was prejudiced. I told him that I did not allow\nanything whatever to prejudice me, and went on with the case.",
        "This great taxidermic masterpiece led to other assaults afterward, all of\nwhich proved remunerative in a small way. My successor claimed that the\nbird was a part of the perquisites of the office, and so I had to turn it\nover with the docket.",
        "I also had a stuffed weasel from Cummins City that attracted a great deal\nof attention, both in this country and in Europe. It looked some like a\nweasel and some like an equestrian sausage with hair on it.",
        "“There’s a big difference in doctors, I tell you,” said an old-timer to me\nthe other day. “You think you know something about ’em, but you are still\nin the fluff and bloom, and kindergarten of life, Wait till you’ve been\nthrough what I have.”",
        "“Where, for instance?” I asked him.",
        "“Well, say nothing about anything else, just look at the doctors we had in\nthe war. We had a doctor in our regiment that looked as if he knew so much\nthat it made him unhappy. I found out afterward that he ran a kind of cow\nfoundling asylum, in Utah before the war, and when he had to prescribe for\na human being, it seemed to kind of rattle him.",
        "“I fell off’n my horse early in the campaign and broke my leg, I\nrickolect, and he sot the bone. He thought that a bone should be sot\nsimilar to a hen. He made what he called a good splice, but the break was\nabove the knee, and he got the cow idea into his head in a way that set\nthe knee behind. That was bad.",
        "“I told him one day that he was a blamed fool. He gave me a cigar and told\nme I must be a mind reader.",
        "“For several weeks our colonel couldn’t eat anything, and seemed to feel\nkind of billious. He didn’t know what the trouble was till he went to the\ndoctor. He looked at the colonel a few moments, examined his tongue, and\ntold him right off that he had lost his cud.",
        "“He bragged a good deal on his diagnosis. He said he’d like to see the\ndisease he couldn’t diagnose with one hand tied behind him.",
        "“He was always telling me how he had resuscitated a man they hung over at\nT–– City in the early day. He was hung by mistake, it seemed. It was a\ndark night and the Vigilance committee was in something of a hurry, having\nanother party to hang over at Dirty Woman’s ranch that night, and so they\nerroneously hung a quiet young feller from Illinois, who had been sent\nwest to cure a case of bronchitis. He was right in the middle of an\nexplanation when the head vigilanter kicked the board from under him and\nbroke his neck.",
        "“All at once, some one said: ’My God, we have made a ridiculous blunder.\nBoys, we can’t be too careful about hanging total strangers. A few more\nsuch breaks as these, and people from the States will hesitate about\ncoming here to make their homes. We have always claimed that this was a\ngood country for bronchitis, but if we write to Illinois and tell this\nyoung feller’s parents the facts, we needn’t look for a very large hegira\nfrom Illinois next season. Doc., can’t you do anything for the young man?’",
        "“Then this young physician stepped forward, he says, and put his knee on\nthe back of the boy’s neck, give it a little push, at the same time pulled\nthe head back with a snap that straightened the neck, and the young\nfeller, who was in the middle of a large word, something like ’contumely,’\nwhen the barrel tipped over, finished out the word and went right on with\nthe explanation. The doctor said he lived a good many years, and was loved\nand esteemed by all who knew him.",
        "“The doctor was always telling of his triumphs in surgery. He did save a\ngood many lives, too, toward the close of the war. He did it in an odd\nway, too.",
        "“He had about one year more to serve, and, with his doctoring on one side\nand the hostility of the enemy on the other, our regiment was wore down to\nabout five hundred men. Everybody said we couldn’t stand it more than\nanother year. One day, however, the doctor had just measured a man for a\nporus plaster, and had laid the stub of his cigar carefully down on the\ntop of a red powder-keg, when there was a slight atmospheric disturbance,\nthe smell of burnt clothes, and our regiment had to apply for a new\nsurgeon.",
        "“The wife of our late surgeon wrote to have her husband’s remains\nforwarded to her, but I told her that it would be very difficult to do so,\nowing to the nature of the accident.

        "One day he got to thinking about the Monroe doctrine, or the sudden and\nhorrible death of Judas Iscariot, and actually lost his office.

        "Martin Luther Brandt was the name of this eccentric jurist. He got up in\nthe night once, and dressed himself, and taking a night train in that\ndreamy way of his, rode on to Denver, took the Rio Grande train in the\nmorning and drifted away into old Mexico somewhere. He must have been in\nthat same old half comatose state when he went away, for he made a most\nludicrous error in getting his wife in the train. When he arrived in old\nMexico he found that he had brought another man’s wife, and by some\nstrange oversight had left his own at home with five children. It hardly\nseems possible that a man could be so completely enveloped in a brown\nstudy that he would err in the matter of a wife and five children, but\nsuch was the case with Martin Luther. Martin Luther couldn’t tell you his\nown name if you asked him suddenly, so as to give him a nervous shock.",
        "This dreamy, absent-minded, wool-gathering disease is sometimes\ncontagious. Pretty soon after Martin Luther struck Mexico the malignant\nform of brown study broke out among the greasers, and an alarming mania\non the somnambulistic order seemed to follow it. A party of Mexican\nsomnambuloes one night got together, and while the disease was at its\nheight tied Martin Luther to the gable of a ’dobe hen palace. His soul\nis probably at this moment floundering around through space, trying to\nfind the evergreen shore.",

        "“Woman has figgered a good deal in my own destinies. My first wife was a\nlarge, powerful woman, who married me before I hardly knew it. She married\nme down near Provost, in an early day. Her name was Lorena. The name\ndidn’t seem to suit her complexion and phizzeek as a general thing. It was\nlike calling the fat woman in the museum Lily. Lorena was a woman of great\nstrength of purpose. She was also strong in the wrists. Lorena was of\nforeign extraction, with far-away eyes and large, earnest red hands. You\nought to have saw her preserve order during the hour for morning prayers.\nI had a hired man there in Utah, in them days, who was inclined to be a\nscoffer at our plain home-made style of religion. So I told Lorena that I\nwas a little afraid that Orlando Whoopenkaugh would rise up suddenly while\nI was at prayer and spatter my thinker all over the cook stove, or create\nsome other ruction that would cast a gloom over our devotions.",
        "“Lorena said: ’Never mind, William. You are more successful in prayer,\nwhile I am more successful in disturbances. You go on with your petition,\nand I will preserve order.”",

We was working a day shift of six men, blasting,\nhysting and a little timbering. I was in charge of the crew and eastern\ncapital was furnishing the ready John Davis, if you will allow me that low\nterm.",

If I wanted to make Lorena jump nine feet high and holler,\nall I had to do was just to allude in a jeering way to her family record,\nso she got madder and madder, till at last it ripened into open hostility,\nand about noon on the 13th day of September Lorena attacked me with a\nlarge butcher knife and drove me into the adjoining county. She told me,\nalso, that if I ever returned to Provost she would cut me in two right\nbetween the pancreas and the watch pocket and feed me to the hens.",
        "“I thought if she felt that way about it I would not return. I felt so\nhurt and so grieved about it that I never stopped till I got to Omaha.\nThen I heard how Lorena, as a means in the hands of Providence, had saved\nmy unprofitable life.",
        "“When she got back to the house and had put away her butcher knife, a man\ncame rushing in to tell her that the boys had struck a big pay streak of\nwater, and that the whole crew in the Coopon was drowned, her husband\namong the rest.",
        "“Then it dawned on Lorena how she had saved me, and for the first time in\nher life she burst into tears. People who saw her said her grief was\nterrible. Tears are sad enough when shed by a man, but when we see a\nstrong woman bowed in grief, we shudder.",
        "“No one who has never deserted his wife at her urgent request can fully\nrealize the pain and anguish it costs. I have been married many times\nsince, but the sensation is just the same to-day as it was the first time\nI ever deserted my wife.",
        "“As I said, though, a woman has a wonderful influence over a man’s whole\nlife. If I had a chance to change the great social fabric any, though, I\nshould ask woman to be more thoughtful of her husband, and, if possible,\nless severe. I would say to woman, be a man. Rise above these petty little\ntyrannical ways. Instead of asking your husband what he does with every\ncent you give him, learn to trust him. Teach him that you have confidence\nin him. Make him think you have anyway, whether you have or not. Do not\nseek to get a whiff of his breath every ten minutes to see whether he has\nbeen drinking or not. If you keep doing that you will sock him into a\ndrunkard’s grave, sure pop. He will at first lie about it, then he will\nuse disinfectants for the breath, and then he will stay away till he gets\nover it. The timid young man says, ’Pass the cloves, please. I’ve got to\nget ready to go home pretty soon.’ The man whose wife really has fun with\nhim says, ’Well, boys, good-night. I’m sorry for you.’ Then he goes home.",

Another does ditto, and so it goes. But I have made\nmatrimony a study. It has been a life-work for me. Others have simply\ndabbled into it. I have studied all its phases and I am an expert. So I\nsay to you that woman, in one way or another, either by strategy and\nwinnin’ ways or by main strength and awkwardness, is absolutely sure to\nwield an all-fired influence over poor, weak man, and while grass grows\nand water runs, pardner, you will always find her presiding over man’s\ndestinies and his ducats.”",

A Democratic administration has certainly frowned upon the\nprofessional, partisan office seekers, but it has been unable to stay the\nonward march of the chintz bug or to produce a perceptible falling off in\npip among the yellow-limbed fowls. While Jeffersonian purity and economy\nhave seemed to rage with great virulence at Washington, in the northwest\nheaves and botts among horses and common, old-fashioned hollow horn among\ncattle have been the prevailing complaints.",
        "And yet there is much for which we should be thankful. Many broad-browed\nmen who knew how a good paper ought to be conducted, but who had no other\nvisible means of support, have passed on to another field of labor,\nleaving the work almost solely in the hands of the vast army of novices\nwho at the present are at the head of journalism throughout the country,\nand who sadly miss those timely words of caution that were wont to fall\nfrom the lips of those men whose spirits are floating through space,\nfinding fault with the arrangement of the solar system.",
        "The fool-killer, in the meantime, has not been idle. With his old, rusty,\nunloaded musket, he has gathered in enough to make his old heart swell\nwith pride, and to this number he has added many by using “rough on rats,\"\na preparation that never killed anything except those that were\nunfortunate enough to belong to the human family.",
        "Still the fool-killer has missed a good many on account of the great rush\nof business in his line, and I presume that no one has a greater reason to\nbe thankful for this oversight than I have.",
        "The State of Maine is a good place in which to experiment with\nprohibition, but it is not a good place to farm it in very largely.",
        "In the first place, the season is generally a little reluctant. When I was\nup near Moosehead Lake, a short time ago, people were driving across that\nbody of water on the ice with perfect impunity. That is one thing that\ninterferes with the farming business in Maine. If a young man is\nsleigh-riding every night till midnight, he don’t feel like hoeing corn\nthe following day. Any man who has ever had his feet frost-bitten while\nbugging potatoes, will agree with me that it takes away the charm of\npastoral pursuits. It is this desire to amalgamate dog days and Santa\nClaus, that has injured Maine as an agricultural hot-bed.",
        "Another reason that might be assigned for refraining from agricultural\npursuits in Maine, is that the agitator of the soil finds when it is too\nlate that soil itself, which is essential to the successful propagation of\ncrops, has not been in use in Maine for years. While all over the State\nthere is a magnificent stone foundation on which a farm might safely rest,\nthe superstructure, or farm proper, has not been secured.",
        "If I had known when I passed through Minnesota and Illinois what a soil\nfamine there was in Maine, I would have brought some with me. The stone\ncrop this year in Maine will be very great. If they do not crack open\nduring the dry weather, there will be a great many. The stone bruise is\nalso looking unusually well for this season of the year, and chilblains\nwere in full bloom when I was there.",
        "In the neighborhood of Pittsfield, the country seems to run largely to\ncold water and chattel mortgages. Some think that rum has always kept\nMaine back, but I claim that it has been wet feet. In another article I\nrefer to the matter of rum in Maine more fully.",
        "The agricultural resources of Pittsfield and vicinity are not great, the\nprincipal exports being spruce gum and Christmas trees. Here also the\nhuckleberry hath her home. But the country seems to run largely to\nChristmas trees. They were not yet in bloom when I visited the State, so\nit was too early to gather popcorn balls and Christmas presents.",
        "Here, near Pittsfield, is the birthplace of the only original wormless\ndried apple pie, with which we generally insult our gastric economy when\nwe lunch along the railroad. These pies, when properly kiln-dried and\nrivetted, with German silver monogram on top, if fitted out with Yale time\nlock, make the best fire and burglar-proof wormless pies of commerce. They\ntake the place of civil war, and as a promoter of intestine strife they\nhave no equal.",
        "The farms in Maine are fenced in with stone walls. I do not know way this\nis done, for I did not see anything on these farms that anyone would\nnaturally yearn to carry away with him.",
        "I saw some sheep in one of these enclosures. Their steel-pointed bills\nwere lying on the wall near them, and they were resting their jaws in the\ncrisp, frosty morning air. In another enclosure a farmer was planting\nclover seed with a hypodermic syringe, and covering it with a mustard\nplaster. He said that last year his clover was a complete failure because\nhis mustard plasters were no good. He had tried to save money by using\nsecond-hand mustard plasters, and of course the clover seed, missing the\nwarm stimulus, neglected to rally, and the crop was a failure.",
        "Here may be noticed the canvas-back moose and a strong antipathy to good\nrum. I do not wonder that the people of Maine are hostile to rum–if they\njudge all rum by Maine rum. The moose is one of the most gamey of the\nfinny tribe. He is caught in the fall of the year with a double-barrel\nshotgun and a pair of snow-shoes. He does not bite unless irritated, but\nlittle boys should not go near the female moose while she is on her nest.\nThe masculine moose wears a harelip, and a hat rack on his head to which\nis attached a placard on which is printed:",
        "PLEASE KEEP OFF THE GRASS.",
        "This shows that the moose is a humorist.",
        "Since the investigation of Washington pension attorneys, it is a little\nremarkable how scarce in the newspapers is the appearance of\nadvertisements like this.",
        "Pensions! Thousands of soldiers of the late war are still entitled to\npensions with the large accumulations since the injury was received. We\nprocure pensions, back pay, allowances. Appear in the courts for\nnonresident clients in United States land cases, etc. Address Skinnem &\nCo., Washington, D.C.",
        "I didn’t participate in the late war, but I have had some experience in\nputting a few friends and neighbors on the track of a pension. Those who\nhave tried it will remember some of the details. It always seemed to me a\nlittle more difficult somehow for a man who had lost both legs at\nAntietam, than for the man who got his nose pulled off at an election\nthree years after the war closed. It, of course, depended a good deal on\nthe extemporaneous affidavit qualifications of the applicant. About five\nyears ago an acquaintance came to me and said he wanted to get a pension\nfrom the government, and that he hadn’t the first idea about the details.\nHe didn’t know whether he should apply to the President or to the\nSecretary of State. Would I “kind of put him onto the racket.” I asked him\nwhat he wanted a pension for, and he said his injury didn’t show much, but\nit prevented his pursuit of kopecks and happiness. He had nine children by\nhis first wife, and if he could get a pension he desired to marry again.",
        "As to the nature of his injuries, he said that at the battle of Fair Oaks\nhe supported his command by secreting himself behind a rail fence and\nharassing the enemy from time to time, by a system of coldness and neglect\non his part. While thus employed in breaking the back of the Confederacy,\na solid shot struck a crooked rail on which he was sitting, in such a way\nas to jar his spinal column. From this concussion he had never fully\nrecovered. He didn’t notice it any more while sitting down and quiet, but\nthe moment he began to do manual labor or to stand on his feet too long,\nunless he had a bar or something to lean up against, he felt the cold\nchill run up his back and life was no object.",
        "I told him that I was too busy to attend to it, and asked him why he\ndidn’t put his case in the hands of some Washington attorney, who could be\non the ground and attend to it. He decided that he would, so he wrote to\none of these philanthropists whom we will call Fitznoodle. I give him the\nnom de plume of Fitznoodle to nip a $20,000 libel suit in the bud. Well,\nFitznoodle sent back some blanks for the claimant to sign, by which he\nbound himself, his heirs, executors, representatives and assigns, firmly\nby these presents to pay to said Fitznoodle, the necessary fees for\npostage, stationery, car fare, concert tickets, and office rent, while\nsaid claim was in the hands of the pension department. He said in a letter\nthat he would have to ask for $2, please, to pay for postage. He inclosed\na circular in which he begged to refer the claimant to a reformed member\nof the bar of the District of Columbia, a backslidden foreign minister and\nthree prominent men who had been dead eleven years by the watch. In a\npostscript he again alluded to the $2 in a casual way, waved the American\nflag two times, and begged leave to subscribe himself once more. “Yours\nFraternally and professionally, Good Samaritan Fitznoodle, Attorney at\nLaw, Solicitor in Chancery, and Promotor of Even-handed Justice in and for\nthe District of Columbia.” The claimant sent his $2, not necessarily for\npublication, but as a guaranty of good faith.",
        "Later on Mr. Fitznoodle said that the first step would be to file a\ndeclaration enclosing $5 and the names of two witnesses who were present\nwhen the claimant was born, and could identify him as the same man who\nenlisted from Emporia in the Thirteenth Kansas Nighthawks. Five dollars\nmust be enclosed to defray the expenses of a trip to the office of the\ncommissioner of pensions, which trip would naturally take in eleven\nsaloons and ten cents in car fare. “P.S.–Attach to the declaration the\nsignature and seal of a notary public of pure character, $5, the\ncertificate of the clerk of a court of record as to the genuineness of\nthe signature of the notary public, his term of appointment and $5.\"\nThese documents were sent, after which there was a lull of about three\nmonths. Then the swelling in Mr. Fitznoodle’s head had gone down a\nlittle, but there was still a seal brown taste in his mouth. So he wrote\nthe claimant that it would be necessary to jog the memory of the\ndepartment about $3 dollars worth; and to file collateral testimony\nsetting forth that claimant was a native born American or that he had\ndeclared his intention to become a citizen of the United States, that he\nhad not formed nor expressed an opinion for or against the accused, which\nthe testimony would not eradicate, that he would enclose $3, and that he\nhad never before applied for a pension. After awhile a circular from the\npension end of the department was received, stating that the claimant’s\napplication had been received, filed and docketed No. 188,935,062-1/2, on\npage 9,847 of book G, on the thumb-hand side as you come in on the New\nYork train. On the strength of this document the claimant went to the\ngrocery and bought an ecru-colored ham, a sack of corn meal and a pound\nof tobacco. In June Mr. Fitznoodle sent a blank to be filled out by the\nclaimant, stating whether he had or had not been baptized prior to his\nenlistment; and, if so, to what extent, and how he liked it so far as he\nhad gone. This was to be sworn to before two witnesses, who were to be\nmale, if possible, and if not, the department would insist on their being\nfemale. These witnesses must swear that they had no interest in the said\nclaim, or anything else. On receipt of this, together with $5 in\npostoffice money order or New York draft, the document would be filed\nand, no doubt, acted upon at once. In July, a note came from the attorney\nsaying that he regretted to write that the pension department was now\n250,000 claims behind, and if business was taken up in its regular order,\nthe claim under discussion might not be reached for between nine and ten\nyears. However, it would be possible to “expedite” the claim, if $25\ncould be remitted for the purpose of buying a spike-tail coat and plug\nhat, in which to appear before the commissioner of pensions and mash him\nflat on the shape of the attorney. As the claimant didn’t know much of\nthe practical working of the machinery of government, he swallowed this\npill and remitted the $25. Here followed a good deal of red tape and\ninternational monkeying during which the claimant was alternately taking\nan oath to support the constitution of the United States, and promising\nto support the constitution and by-laws of Mr. Fitznoodle. The claimant\nwas constantly assured that his claim was a good one and on these\nautograph letters written with a type-writer, the war-born veteran with a\nconcussed vertebra bought groceries and secured the funds to pay his\nassessments.",
        "For a number of years I heard nothing of the claim, but a few months ago,\nwhen Mr. Fitznoodle was arrested and jerked into the presence of the grand\njury, a Washington friend wrote me that the officers found in his table a\nletter addressed to the man who was jarred in the rear of the Union army,\nand in which (the letter, I mean), he alluded to the long and pleasant\ncorrespondence which had sprung up between them as lawyer and client, and\nregretting that, as the claim would soon be allowed, their friendly\nrelations would no doubt cease, would he please forward $13 to pay freight\non the pension money, and also a lock of his hair that Mr. Fitznoodle\ncould weave into a watchchain and wear always. As the claimant does not\nneed the papers, he probably thinks by this time that Mr. Good Samaritan\nFitznoodle has been kidnapped and thrown into the moaning, hungry sea.",
        "It would please me very much, at no distant day, to issue a small book\nfilled with choice recipes and directions for making home happy. I have\naccumulated an immense assortment of these things, all of general use and\nall excellent in their way, because they have been printed in papers all\nover the country–papers that would not be wrong. Some of these recipes I\nhave tried.",
        "I have tried the recipe for paste and directions for applying wall paper,\nas published recently in an agricultural paper to which I had become very\nmuch attached.",
        "This recipe had all the characteristics of an ingenuous and honest\ndocument. I cut it out of the paper and filed it away where I came very\nnear not finding it again. But I was unfortunate enough to find it after a\nlong search.",
        "The scheme was to prepare a flour paste that would hold forever, and at\nthe same time make the paper look smooth and neat to the casual observer.\nIt consisted of so many parts flour, so many parts hot water and so many\nparts common glue. First, the walls were to be sized, however. I took a\ncommon tape measure and sized the walls.",
        "Then I put a dishpan on the cook stove, poured in the flour, boiling water\nand glue. This rapidly produced a dark brown mess of dough, to which I was\nobliged to add more hot water. It looked extremely repulsive to me, but it\nlooked a good deal better than it smelled.",
        "I did not have much faith in it, but I thought I would try it. I put some\nof it on a long strip of wall paper and got up on a chair to apply it. In\nthe excitement of trying to stick it on the wall as nearly perpendicular\nas possible, I lost my balance while still holding the paper and fell in\nsuch a manner as to wrap four yards of bronze paper and common flour paste\naround my wife’s head, with the exception of about four feet of the paper\nwhich I applied to an oil painting of a Gordon Setter in a gilt frame.",
        "I decline to detail the dialogue which then took place between my wife and\nmyself. Whatever claim the public may have on me, it has no right to\ndemand this. It will continue to remain sacred. That is, not so very\nsacred of course, if I remember my exact language at the time, but\nsacredly secret from the prying eyes of the public.",
        "It is singular, but it is none the less the never dying truth, that the\nonly time that paste ever stuck anything at all, was when I applied it to\nmy wife and that picture. After that it did everything but adhere. It\ngourmed and it gummed everything, but that was all.",
        "The man who wrote the recipe may have been stuck on it, but nothing else\never was.",
        "Finally a friend came along who helped me pick the paper off the dog and\nsoothe my wife. He said that what this paste needed was more glue and a\nquart of molasses. I added these ingredients, and constructed a quart of\nchemical molasses which looked like crude ginger bread in a molten state.",
        "Then, with the aid of my friend, I proceeded to paper the room. The paper\nwould seem to adhere at times, and then it would refrain from adhering.\nThis was annoying, but we succeeded in applying the paper to the walls in\na way that showed we were perfectly sincere about it. We didn’t seek to\nmislead anybody or cover up anything. Any one could see where each roll of\npaper tried to be amicable with its neighbor–also where we had tried the\nlaying on of hands in applying the paper.",
        "We got all the paper on in good shape–also the bronze. But they were in\ndifferent places. The paper was on the walls, but the bronze was mostly on\nour clothes and on our hands. I was very tired when I got through, and I\nwent to bed early, hoping to get much needed rest. In the morning, when I\nfelt fresh and rested, I thought that the paper would look better to me.",
        "There is where I fooled myself. It did not look better to me. It looked\nworse.",
        "All night long I could occasionally hear something crack like a Fourth of\nJuly. I did not know at the time what it was, but in the morning I\ndiscovered.",
        "It seems that, during the night, that paper had wrinkled itself up like\nthe skin on the neck of a pioneer hen after death. It had pulled itself\ntogether with so much zeal that the room was six inches smaller each way\nand the carpet didn’t fit.",
        "There is only one way to insure success in the publication of recipes.\nThey must be tried by the editor himself before they are printed. If you\nhave a good recipe for paste, you must try it before you print it. If you\nhave a good remedy for botts, you must get a botty horse somewhere and try\nthe remedy before you submit it. If you think of publishing the antidote\nfor a certain poison, you should poison some one and try the antidote on\nhim, in order to test it, before you bamboozle the readers of your paper.",
        "This, of course, will add a good deal of extra work for the editor, but\neditors need more work. All they do now is to have fun with each other,\ndraw their princely salaries, and speak sarcastically of the young poet\nwho sings,",
        "  “You have came far o’er the sea,\n  And I’ve went away from thee.”",
        "The following selections are from the advance sheets of a forthcoming work\nwith the above title, to be published by M. Foll de Roll. It is possible\nthat other excerpts will be made from the book, in case the present\nharmonious state of affairs between France and America is not destroyed by\nmy style of translation.",
        "In the preface M. Foll de Roll says: “France has long required a book of\nprinted writings about that large, wide land of whom we listen to so much\nand yet so little sabe, as the piquant Californian shall say. America is\nconsiderable. America I shall call vast. She care nothing how high freedom\nshall come, she must secure him. She exclaims to all people: ’You like\nfreedom pretty well, but you know nothing of it. We throw away every day\nmore freedom than you shall see all your life. Come to this place when you\nshall run out of freedom. We make it. Do not ask us for money, but if you\nwant personal liberty, please look over our vast stock before you\nelsewhere go.’",
        "“So everybody goes to America, where he shall be free to pay cash for what\nthe American has for sale.",
        "“In this book will be found everything that the French people want to know\nof that singular land, for did I not cross it from New Jersey City, the\ntown where all the New York people have to go to get upon the cars,\nthrough to the town of San Francisco?",
        "“For years the writer of this book has had it in his mind to go across\nAmerica, and then tell the people of France, in a small volume costing one\nfranc, all about the grotesque land of the freedom bird.”",
        "In the opening chapter he alludes to New York casually, and apologizes for\ntaking up so much space.",
        "“When you shall land in New York, you shall feel a strange sensation. The\nstomach is not so what we should call ’Rise up William Riley,’ to use an\nAmericanism which will not bear translation. I ride along the Rue de\nTwenty-three, and want to eat everything my eyes shall fall upon.",
        "“I stay at New York all night, and eat one large supper at 6 o’clock, and\nagain at 9. At 12 I awake and eat the inside of my hektograph, and then\nlie down once more to sleep. The hektograph will be henceforth, as the\nAmerican shall say, no good, but what is that when a man is starving in a\nforeign land?",
        "“I leave New York in the morning on the Ferry de Pavonia, a steamer that\ngoes to New Jersey City. Many people go to New York to buy food and\nclothes. Then you shall see them return to the woods, where they live the\nrest of the time. Some of the females are quite petite and, as the\nAmericans have it,’scrumptious.’ One stout girl at New Jersey City, I was\ntold, was ’all wool and a yard wide.’",
        "“The relations between New York and New Jersey City are quite amicable,\nand the inhabitants seem to spend much of their time riding to and fro on\nthe Ferry de Pavonia and other steamers. When I talked to them in their\nown language they would laugh with great glee, and say they could not\nparley voo Norwegian very good.",
        "“The Americans are very fond of witnessing what may be called the\ntournament de slug. In this, two men wearing upholstered mittens shake\nhands, and then one strikes at the other with his right hand, so as to\nmislead him, and, while he is taking care of that, the first man hits him\nwith his left and knocks out some of his teeth. Then the other man spits\nout his loose teeth and hits his antagonist on the nose, or feeds him with\nthe thumb of his upholstered mitten for some time. Half the gate money\ngoes to the hospital where these men are in the habit of being repaired.",
        "“One of these men, who is now the champion scrapper, as one American\nauthor has it, was once a poor boy, but he was proud and ambitious. So he\npracticed on his wife evenings, after she had washed the dishes, until he\nfound that he could ’knock her out,’ as the American has it. Then he tried\nit on other relatives, and step by step advanced till he could make almost\nany man in America cough up pieces of this upholstered mitten which he\nwears in public.",
        "“In closing this chapter on New York, I may say that I have not said so\nmuch of the city itself as I would like, but enough so that he who reads\nwith care may feel somewhat familiar with it. New York is situated on the\neast side of America, near New Jersey City. The climate is cool and frosty\na part of the year, but warm and temperate in the summer months. The\nsurface is generally level, but some of the houses are quite tall.",
        "“I would not advise Frenchmen to go to New York now, but rather to wait\nuntil the pedestal of M. Bartholdi’s Statue of Liberty has been paid for.\nMany foreigners have already been earnestly permitted to help pay for this\npedestal.”",
        "There are a good many difficult things to ride, I find, beside the bicycle\nand the bucking Mexican plug. Those who have tried to mount and\nsuccessfully ride a wheelbarrow in the darkness of the stilly night will\nagree with me.",
        "You come on a wheelbarrow suddenly when it is in a brown study, and you\nundertake to straddle it, so to speak, and all at once you find the\nwheelbarrow on top. I may say, I think, safely, that the wheelbarrow is,\nas a rule, phlegmatic and cool; but when a total stranger startles it, it\nspreads desolation and destruction on every hand.",
        "This is also true of the perambulator, or baby-carriage. I undertook to\nevade a child’s phaeton, three years ago last spring, as it stood in the\nentrance to a hall in Main street. The child was not injured, because it\nwas not in the carriage at the time; but I was not so fortunate. I pulled\npieces of perambulator out of myself for two weeks with the hand that was\nnot disabled.",
        "How a sedentary man could fall through a child’s carriage in such a manner\nas to stab himself with the awning and knock every spoke out of three\nwheels, is still a mystery to me, but I did it. I can show you the\ndoctor’s bill now.",
        "The other day, however, I discovered a new style of riding animal. The\nRev. Mr. Hallelujah was at the depot when I arrived, and was evidently\nwaiting for the same Chicago train that I was in search of. Rev. Mr.\nHallelujah had put his valise down near an ordinary baggage-truck which\nleaned up against the wall of the station building.",
        "He strolled along the platform a few moments, communing with himself and\nagitating his mind over the subject of Divine Retribution, and then he\nwent up and leaned against the truck. Finally, he somehow got his arms\nunder the handles of the truck as it stood up between his back and the\nwall. He still continued to think of the plan of Divine Retribution, and\nyou could have seen his lips move if you had been there.",
        "Pretty soon some young ladies came along, rosy in winter air, beautiful\nbeyond compare, frosty crystals in their hair; smiled they on the preacher\nthere.",
        "He returned the smile and bowed low. As he did so, as near as I can figure\nit out, he stepped back on the iron edge of the truck that the baggageman\ngenerally jabs under the rim of an iron-bound sample-trunk when he goes to\nload it. Anyhow, Mr. Hallelujah’s feet flew toward next spring. The truck\nstarted across the platform with him and spilled him over the edge on the\ntrack ten feet below. So rapid was the movement that the eye with\ndifficulty followed his evolutions. His valise was carried onward by the\nsame wild avalanche, and “busted” open before it struck the track below.",
        "I was surprised to see some of the articles that shot forth into the broad\nlight of day. Among the rest there was a bran fired new set of ready-made\nteeth, to be used in case of accident. Up to that moment I didn’t know\nthat Mr. Hallelujah used the common tooth of commerce. These teeth slipped\nout of the valise with a Sabbath smile and vulcanized rubber gums.",
        "In striking the iron track below, the every-day set which the Rev. Mr.\nHallelujah had in use became loosened, and smiled across the road-bed and\nright of way at the bran fired new array of incisors, cuspids, bi-cuspids\nand molars that flew out of the valise. Mr. Hallelujah got up and tried to\nlook merry, but he could not smile without his teeth. The back seams of\nhis Newmarket coat were more successful, however.",
        "Mr. Hallelujah’s wardrobe and a small boy were the only objects that dared\nto smile.",
        "A recent article in the London Post on the subject of somnambulism,\ncalls to my mind several little incidents with somnambulistic tendencies\nin my own experience.",
        "This subject has, indeed, attracted my attention for some years, and it\nhas afforded me great pleasure to investigate it carefully.",
        "Regarding the causes of dreams and somnambulism, there are many theories,\nall of which are more or less untenable. My own idea, given, of course, in\na plain, crude way, is that thoughts originate on the inside of the brain\nand then go at once to the surface, where they have their photographs\ntaken, with the understanding that the negatives are to be preserved. In\nthis way the thought may afterward be duplicated back to the thinker in\nthe form of a dream, and, if the impulse be strong enough, muscular action\nand somnambulism may result.",
        "On the banks of Bitter Creek, some years ago, lived an open-mouthed man,\nwho had risen from affluence by his unaided effort until he was entirely\nfree from any incumbrance in the way of property. His mind dwelt on this\nmatter a great deal during the day. Thoughts of manual labor flitted\nthrough his mind, but were cast aside as impracticable. Then other means\nof acquiring property suggested themselves. These thoughts were\nphotographed on the delicate negative of the brain, where it is a rule to\npreserve all negatives. At night these thoughts were reversed within the\nthink resort, if I may be allowed that term, and muscular action resulted.\nYielding at last to the great desire for possessions and property the\nsomnambulist groped his way to the corral of a total stranger, and\nselecting a choice mule with great dewy eyes and real camel’s hair tail,\nhe fled. On and on he pressed, toward the dark, uncertain west, till at\nlast rosy morn clomb the low, outlying hills and gilded the gray outlines\nof the sage-brush. The coyote slunk back to his home, but the somnambulist\ndid not.",
        "He awoke as day dawned, and, when he found himself astride the mule of\nanother, a slight shudder passed the entire length of his frame. He then\nfully realized that he had made his debut as a somnambulist. He seemed to\nthink that he who starts out to be a somnambulist should never turn back.\nSo he pressed on, while the red sun stepped out into the awful quiet of\nthe dusty waste and gradually moved up into the sky, and slowly added\nanother day to those already filed away in the dark maw of ages.",
        "Night came again at last, and with it other somnambulists similar to the\nfirst, only that they were riding on their own beasts. Some somnambulists\nride their own animals, while others are content to bestride the steeds of\nstrangers.",
        "The man on the anonymous mule halted at last at the mouth of a deep canon.\nHe did so at the request of other somnambulists. Mechanically he got down\nfrom the back of the mule and stood under a stunted mountain pine.",
        "After awhile he began to ascend the tree by means of his neck. When he had\nreached the lower branch of the tree he made a few gestures with his feet\nby a lateral movement of the legs. He made several ineffectual efforts to\nkick some pieces out of the horizon, and then, after he had gently\noscilliated a few times, he assumed a pendent and perpendicular position\nat right angles with the limb of the tree.",
        "The other somnambulists then took the mule safely back to his corral, and\nthe tragedy of a night was over.",
        "The London Post very truly says that where somnambulism can be proved it\nis a good defense in a criminal action. It was so held in this case.",
        "Various methods are suggested for rousing the somnambulist, such as\ntickling the feet, for instance; but in all my own experience, I never\nknew of a more radical or permanent cure than the one so imperfectly given\nabove. It might do in some cases to tickle the feet of a somnambulist\ndiscovered in the act of riding away on an anonymous mule, but how could\nyou successfully tickle the soles of his feet while he is standing on\nthem? In such cases, the only true way would be to suspend the\nsomnambulist in such a way as to give free access to the feet from below,\nand, at the same time, give him a good, wide horizon to kick at.",
        "It may be premature, perhaps, but I desire to suggest to anyone who may be\ncontemplating the erection of a summer residence for me, as a slight\ntestimonial of his high regard for my sterling worth and symmetrical\nescutcheon–a testimonial more suggestive of earnest admiration and warm\npersonal friendship than of great intrinsic value, etc., etc., etc., that\nI hope he will not construct it on the modern plan of mental hallucination\nand morbid delirium tremens peculiar to recent architecture.",
        "Of course, a man ought not to look a gift house in the gable end, but if\nmy friends don’t know me any better than to build me a summer cottage and\nthrow in odd windows that nobody else wanted, and then daub it up with\ncolors they have bought at auction and applied to the house after dark\nwith a shotgun, I think it is time that we had a better understanding.",
        "Such a structure does not come within either of the three classes of\nrenaissance. It is neither Florentine, Roman, or Venetian. Any man can\noriginate such a style if he will only drink the right kind of whiskey\nlong enough and then describe the feelings to an amanuensis.",
        "Imagine the sensation that one of these modern, sawed-off cottages would\ncreate a hundred years from now, if it should survive! But that is\nimpossible. The only cheering feature of the whole matter is that these\ncreatures of a disordered imagination must soon pass away, and the bright\nsunlight of hard horse sense shine in through the shattered dormers and\ngables and gnawed-off architecture of the average summer resort.",
        "A friend of mine a few days ago showed me his new house with much pride.\nHe asked me what I thought of it. I told him I liked it first-rate. Then I\nwent home and wept all night. It was my first falsehood.",
        "The house, taken as a whole, looked to me like a skating rink that had\nstarted out to make money, and then suddenly changed its mind and resolved\nto become a tannery. Then ten feet higher it lost all self-respect and\nblossomed into a full-blown drunk and disorderly, surrounded by the\nsmokestack of a foundry and the bright future of thirty days ahead with\nthe chain gang. That’s the way it looked to me.",
        "The roofs were made of little odds and ends of misfit rafters and\ndistorted shingles that somebody had purchased at a sheriff’s sale, and\nthe rooms and stairs were giddy in the extreme.",
        "I went in and rambled around among the cross-eyed staircases and other\nnight-mares till reason tottered on her throne. Then I came out and stood\non the architectural wart, called the side porch, to get fresh air. This\nporch was painted a dull red, and it had wooden rosettes at the corners\nthat looked like a new carbuncle on the nose of a social wreck.",
        "Farther up on the demoralized lumber pile I saw, now and then, places\nwhere the workman’s mind had wandered and he had nailed on his clapboards\nwrong side up, and then painted them with Paris green that he had intended\nto use on something else.",
        "It was an odd looking structure, indeed. If my friend got all the material\nfor nothing from people who had fragments of paint and lumber left over\nafter they failed, and then if the workmen constructed it of night for\nmental relaxation and intellectual repose, without charge, of course the\nscheme was a financial success, but architecturally the house is a gross\nviolation of the statutes in such cases made and provided, and against the\npeace and dignity of the State.",
        "There is a look of extreme poverty about the structure which a man might\nstruggle for years to acquire and then fail. No one could look upon it\nwithout a feeling of heartache for the man who built that house, and\nprobably struggled on year after year, building a little at a time as he\ncould steal the lumber, getting a new workman each year, building a knob\nhere and a protuberance there, putting in a three-cornered window at one\npoint and a yellow tile or a wad of broken glass and other debris at\nanother, patiently filling in around the ranch with any old rubbish that\nother people had got through with, painting it as he went along, taking\nwhat was left in the bottom of the pots after his neighbors had painted\ntheir bob-sleds or their tree boxes–little favors thankfully\nreceived–and then surmounting the whole pile with a potpourri of roof,\nand grand farewell incubus of humps and hollows for the rain to wander\nthrough and seek out the different cells where the lunatics live who\ninhabit it.",
        "I did tell my friend one thing that I thought would improve the looks of\nhis house. He asked me eagerly what it could be. I said it would take a\nman of great courage to do it for him. He said he didn’t care for that. He\nwould do it himself. If it only needed one thing he would never rest till\nhe had it, whatever that might be.",
        "Then I told him that if he had a friend–one he could trust–who would\nsteal in there some night while the family were away, and scratch a match\non the leg of his breeches, or on the breeches of any other gentleman who\nhappened to be present, and hold it where it would ignite the alleged\nhouse, and then remain near there to see that the fire department did not\nmeddle with it, he would confer a great favor on one who would cheerfully\nretaliate in kind on call.",
        "Dear Sir.–Your courteous letter of the 1st instant, in which you\ncordially consent to share my wealth and dwell together with me in\nfraternal sunshine, is duly received. While I dislike to appear cold and\ndistant to one who seems so yearnful and so clinging, and while I do not\nwish to be regarded as purse-proud or arrogant, I must decline your kind\noffer to whack up. You had not heard, very likely, that I am not now a\nCommunist. I used to be, I admit, and the society no doubt neglected to\nstrike my name off the roll of active members. For a number of years I was\nquite active as a Communist. I would have been more active, but I had\nconscientious scruples against being active in anything then.",
        "While you may be perfectly sincere in your belief that the great\ncapitalists like Mr. Gould and Mr. Vanderbilt should divide with you, you\nwill have great difficulty in making it perfectly clear to them. They will\nprobably demur and delay, and hem and haw, and procrastinate, till finally\nthey will get out of it in some way. Still, I do not wish to throw cold\nwater on your enterprise. If the other capitalists look favorably on the\nplan, I will cheerfully co-operate with them. You go and see what you can\ndo with Mr. Vanderbilt, and then come to me.",
        "You go on at some length to tell me how the most of the wealth is in the\nhands of a few men, and then you attack those men and refer to them in a\nway that makes my blood run cold. You tell the millionaires of America to\nbeware, for the hot breath of a bloody-handed Nemesis is already in the\nair.",
        "You may say to Nemesis, if you please, that I have a double-barreled\nshotgun standing at the head of my bed every night, and that I am in the\nNemesis business. You also refer to the fact that the sleuth-hounds of\neternal justice are camped on the trail of the pampered millionaire, and\nyou ask us to avaunt. If you see the other sleuth-hounds of your society\nwithin a week or two, I wish you would say to them that at a regular\nmeeting of the millionaires of this country, after the minutes of the\nprevious meeting had been read and approved, we voted almost unanimously\nto discourage any sleuth-hound that we found camped on our trail after ten\no’clock, P.M. Sleuth-hounds who want to ramble over our trails during\noffice hours may do so with the utmost impunity, but after ten o’clock we\nwant to use our trails for other purposes. No man wants to go to the great\nexpense of maintaining a trail winter and summer, and then leave it out\nnights for other people to use and return it when they get ready.",
        "I do not censure you, however. If you could convince every one of the\nutility of Communism, it would certainly be a great boon–to you. To those\nwho are now engaged in feeding themselves with flat beer out of a tomato\ncan, such a change as you suggest would fall like a ray of sunshine in a\nrat-hole, but alas! it may never be. I tried it awhile, but my efforts\nwere futile. The effect of my great struggle seemed to be that men’s\nhearts grew more and more stony, and my pantaloons got thinner and thinner\non the seat, ’till it seemed to me that the world never was so cold. Then\nI made some experiments in manual labor. As I began to work harder and sit\ndown less, I found that the world was not so cold. It was only when I sat\ndown a long time that I felt how cold and rough the world really was.",
        "Perhaps it is so with you. Sedentary habits and stale beer are apt to make\nus morbid. Sitting on the stone door sills of hallways and public\nbuildings during cold weather is apt to give you an erroneous impression\nof life.",
        "Of course I am willing to put my money into a common fund if I can be\nconvinced that it is best. I was an inside passenger on a Leadville coach\nsome years ago, when a few of your friends suggested that we all put our\nmoney into a common fund, and I was almost the first one to see that they\nwere right. They went away into the mountains to apportion the money they\ngot from our party, but I never got any dividend. Probably they lost my\npost-office address.",
        "Warriors! We are met here to-day to celebrate the white man’s Fourth of\nJuly. I do not know what the Fourth of July has done for us that we should\nremember his birthday, but it matters not. Another summer is on the wane,\nand so are we. We are the walleyed waners from Wanetown. We have\nmonopolized the wane business of the whole world.",
        "Autumn is almost here, and we have not yet gone upon the war path. The\npale face came among us with the corn planter and the Desert Land Act, and\nwe bow before him.",
        "What does the Fourth of July signify to us? It is a hollow mockery! Where\nthe flag of the white man now waves in the breeze, a few years ago the\nscalp of our foe was hanging in the air. Now my people are seldom. Some\nare dead and others drunk.",
        "Once we chased the deer and the buffalo across the plains, and lived high.\nNow we eat the condemned corned beef of the oppressor, and weep over the\ngraves of our fallen braves. A few more moons and I, too, shall cross over\nto the Happy Reservation.",
        "Once I could whoop a couple of times and fill the gulch with warlike\nathletes. Now I may whoop till the cows come home and only my sickly howl\ncomes back to me from the hillsides. I am as lonely as the greenback\nparty. I haven’t warriors enough to carry one precinct.",
        "Where are the proud chieftains of my tribe? Where are Old Weasel Asleep\nand Orlando the Hie Jacet Promoter? Where are Prickly Ash Berry and The\nAvenging Wart? Where are The Roman-nosed Pelican and Goggle-eyed Aleck,\nThe-man-who-rides-the-blizzard-bareback?",
        "They are extremely gone. They are extensively whence. Ole Blackhawk, in\nwhose veins flows the blood of many chiefs, is sawing wood for the Belle\nof the West deadfall for the whiskey. He once rode the war pony into the\nfray and buried his tomahawk in the phrenology of his foe. Now he\nstraddles the saw-buck and yanks the woodsaw athwart the bosom of the\nbasswood chunk.",
        "My people once owned this broad land; but the Pilgrim Fathers (where are\nthey?) came and planted the baked bean and the dried apple, and my tribe\nvamoosed. Once we were a nation. Now we are the tin can tied to the\nAmerican eagle.",
        "Warriors! This should be a day of jubilee, but how can the man rejoice who\nhas a boil on his nose? How can the chief of a once proud people shoot\nfirecrackers and dance over the graves of his race? How can I be hilarious\nwith the victor, on whose hands are the blood of my children?",
        "If we had known more of the white man, we would have made it red hot for\nhim four hundred years ago when he came to our coast. We fed him and\nclothed him as a white-skinned curiosity then, but we didn’t know there\nwere so many of him. All he wanted then was a little smoking tobacco and\nlove. Now he feeds us on antique pork, and borrows our annuities to build\na Queen Anne wigwam with a furnace in the bottom and a piano in the top.",
        "Warriors! My words are few. Tears are idle and unavailing. If I had\nscalding tears enough for a mill site, I would not shed a blamed one. The\nwarrior suffers, but he never squeals. He accepts the position and says\nnothing. He wraps his royal horse blanket around his Gothic bones and is\nsilent.",
        "But the pale face cannot tickle us with a barley straw on the Fourth of\nJuly and make us laugh. You can kill the red man, but you cannot make him\nhilarious over his own funeral. These are the words of truth, and my\nwarriors will do well to paste them in their plug hats for future\nreference.",
        "While in New England trying in my poor, weak way to represent the “rowdy\nwest,” I met a sad young man who asked me if I lived in Chi-eene. I told\nhim that if he referred to Cheyenne, I had been there off and on a good\ndeal.",
        "He said he was there not long ago, but did not remain. He bought some\nclothes in Chicago, so that he could appear in Chi-eene as a “holy terror\"\nwhen he landed there, and thus in a whole town of “holy terrors” he would\nnot attract attention.",
        "I am not, said he, by birth or instinct, a holy terror, but I thought I\nwould like to try it a little while, anyhow. I got one of those Chicago\nsombreros with a gilt fried cake twisted around it for a band. Then I got\na yellow silk handkerchief on the ten cent counter to tie around my neck.\nThen I got a suit of smoke-tanned buckskin clothes and a pair of\nmoccasins. I had never seen a bad, bad man from Chi-eene, but I had seen\npictures of them and they all wore moccasins. The money that I had left I\nput into a large revolver and a butcher knife with a red Morocco sheath to\nit. The revolver was too heavy for me to hold in one hand and shoot, but\nby resting it on a fence I could kill a cow easy enough if she wasn’t too\nblamed restless.",
        "I went out to the stock yards in Chicago one afternoon and practiced with\nmy revolver. One of my thumbs is out there at the stock yards now.",
        "At Omaha I put on my new suit and sent my human clothes home to my father.\nHe told me when I came away that when I got out to Wyoming, probably I\nwouldn’t want to attract attention by wearing clothes, and so I could send\nmy clothes back to him and he would be glad to have them.",
        "At Sidney I put on my revolver and went into the eating house to get my\ndinner. A tall man met me at the door and threw me about forty feet in an\noblique manner. I asked him if he meant anything personal by that and he\nsaid not at all, not at all. I then asked him if he would not allow me to\neat my dinner and he said that depended on what I wanted for my dinner. If\nI would lay down my arms and come back to the reservation and remain\nneutral to the Government and eat cooked food, it would be all right, but\nif I insisted on eating raw dining-room girls and scalloped young ladies,\nhe would bar me out.",
        "We landed at Chi-eene in the evening. They had hacks and ’busses and\ncarriages till you couldn’t rest, all standing there at the depot, and a\nlarge colored man in a loud tone of voice remarked: “INTEROCEAN\nHO-TEL!!!!”",
        "I went there myself. It had doors and windows to it, and carpets and gas.\nThe young man who showed me to my room was very polite to me. He seemed to\nwant to get acquainted. He said:",
        "“You are from New Hampshire, are you not?”",
        "I told him not to give it away, but I was from New Hampshire. Then I asked\nhim how he knew.",
        "He said that several New Hampshire people had been out there that summer,\nand they had worn the same style of revolver and generally had one thumb\ndone up in a rag. Then he said that if I came from New Hampshire he would\nshow me how to turn off the gas.",
        "He also took my revolver down to the office with him and put it in the\nsafe, because he said someone might get into my room in the night and kill\nme with it if he left it here. He was a perfect gentleman.",
        "They have a big opera house there in Chi-eene, and while I was there they\nhad the Eyetalian opera singers, Patty and Nevady there. The streets were\nlit up with electricity, and people seemed to kind of politely look down\non me, I thought. Still, they acted as if they tried not to notice my\nclothes and dime museum hat.",
        "They seemed to look at me as if I wasn’t to blame for it, and as if they\nfelt sorry for me. If I’d had my United States clothes with me, I could\nhave had a good deal of fun in Chi-eene, going to the opera and the\nlectures, and concerts, et cetera. But finally I decided to return, so I\nwrote to my parents how I had been knocked down and garroted, and left for\ndead with one thumb shot off, and they gladly sent the money to pay\nfuneral expenses.",
        "With this I got a cut-rate ticket home and surprised and horrified my\nparents by dropping in on them one morning just after prayers. I tried to\nget there prior to prayers, but was side-tracked by my father’s new\nanti-tramp bull dog.",
        "Strolling through the Public Garden and the famous Boston Common, the\nuntutored savage from the raw and unpolished West is awed and his wild\nspirit tamed by the magnificent harmony of nature and art. Everywhere the\neye rests upon all that is beautiful in nature, while art has heightened\nthe pleasing effect without having introduced the artistic jim-jams of a\nlost and undone world.",
        "It is a delightful place through which to stroll in the gray morning while\nthe early worm is getting his just desserts. There, in the midst of a\ngreat city, with the hum of industry and the low rumble of the throbbing\nBoston brain dimly heard in the distance, nature asserts herself, and the\nweary, sad-eyed stranger may ramble for hours and keep off the grass to\nhis heart’s content.",
        "Nearly every foot of Boston Common is hallowed by some historical\nincident. It is filled with reminiscences of a time when liberty was not\noverdone in this new world, and the tyrant’s heel was resting calmly on\nthe neck of our forefathers.",
        "In the winter of 1775-6, over 110 years ago, as the ready mathematician\nwill perceive, 1,700 redcoats swarmed over Boston Common. Later on the\nlocal antipathy to these tourists became so great that they went away.\nThey are still fled. A few of their descendants were there when I visited\nthe Common, but they seemed amicable and did not wear red coats. Their\ncoats this season are made of a large check, with sleeves in it. Their\nwardrobe generally stands a larger check than their bank account.",
        "The fountains in the Common and the Public Garden attract the eye of the\nstranger, some of them being very beautiful. The Brewer fountain on\nFlagstaff hill, presented to the city by the late Gardner Brewer, is very\nhandsome. It was cast in Paris, and is a bronze copy of a fountain\ndesigned by Lienard of that city. At the base there are figures\nrepresenting Neptune with his fabled pickerel stabber, life size; also\nAmphitrite, Acis and Galatea. Surviving relatives of these parties may\nwell feel pleased and gratified over the life-like expression which, the\nsculptor has so faithfully reproduced.",
        "But the Coggswell fountain is probably the most eccentric squirt, and one\nwhich at once rivets the eye of the beholder. I do not know who designed\nit, but am told that it was modeled by a young man who attended the\ncodfish autopsy at the market daytimes and gave his nights to art.",
        "The fountain proper consists of two metallic bullheads rampart. They stand\non their bosoms, with their tails tied together at the top. Their mouths\nare abnormally distended, and the water gushes forth from their tonsils in\na beautiful stream.",
        "The pose of these classical codfish or bullheads is sublime. In the\nspirited Graeco-Roman tussle which they seem to be having, with their\ntails abnormally elevated in their artistic catch-as-catch-can or can-can\nscuffle, the designer has certainly hit upon a unique and beautiful\nimpossibility.",
        "Each bullhead also has a tin dipper chained to his gills, and through the\nlive-long day, till far into the night, he invites the cosmopolitan tramp\nto come and quench his never-dying thirst.",
        "The frog pond is another celebrated watering place. I saw it in the early\npart of May, and if there had been any water in it, it would have been a\nfine sight. Nothing contributes to the success of a pond like water.",
        "I ventured to say to a Boston man that I was a little surprised to find a\nlittle frog pond containing neither frogs or pond, but he said I would\nfind it all right if I would call around during office hours.",
        "While sitting on one of the many seats which may be found on the Common\none morning, I formed the acquaintance of a pale young man, who asked me\nif I resided in Boston. I told him that while I felt flattered to think\nthat I could possibly fool anyone, I must admit that I was only a pilgrim\nand a stranger.",
        "He said that he was an old resident, and he had often noticed that the\npeople of the Hub always Spoke to a Felloe till he was tired. I afterward\nlearned that he was not an actual resident of Boston, but had just\ncompleted his junior year at the State asylum for the insane. He was sent\nthere, it seems, as a confirmed case of unjustifiable Punist. Therefore\nthe governor had Punist him accordingly. This is a specimen of our\ncapitalized joke with Queen Anne do-funny on the corners. We are shipping\na great many of them to England this season, where they are greedily\nsnapped up and devoured by the crowned heads. It is a good hot weather\njoke, devoid of mental strain, perfectly simple and may be laughed at or\nnot without giving the slightest offense.",
        "This world is filled with woe everywhere you go. Sorrow is piled up in the\nfence corners on every road. Unavailing regret and red-nosed remorse\ninhabit the cot of the tie-chopper as well as the cut-glass cage of the\nmillionaire. The woods are full of disappointment. The earth is convulsed\nwith a universal sob, and the roads are muddy with tears. But I do not\ncall to mind a more touching picture of unavailing misery and ruin, and\nhopeless chaos, than the plug hat that has endeavored to keep sober and\nmaintain self-respect while its owner was drunk. A plug hat can stand\nprosperity, and shine forth joyously while nature smiles. That’s the place\nwhere it seems to thrive. A tall silk hat looks well on a thrifty man with\na clean collar, but it cannot stand dissipation.",
        "I once knew a plug hat that had been respected by everyone, and had won\nits way upward by steady endeavor. No one knew aught against it till one\nevening, in an evil hour, it consented to attend a banquet, and all at\nonce its joyous career ended. It met nothing but distrust and cold neglect\neverywhere, after that.",
        "Drink seems to make a man temporarily unnaturally exhilarated. During that\ntemporary exhilaration he desires to attract attention by eating lobster\nsalad out of his own hat, and sitting down on his neighbor’s.",
        "The demon rum is bad enough on the coatings of the stomach, but it is even\nmore disastrous to the tall hat. A man may mix up in a crowd and carry off\nan overdose of valley tan in a soft hat or a cap, but the silk hat will\nproclaim it upon the house-tops, and advertise it to a gaping, wondering\nworld. It has a way of getting back on the rear elevation of the head, or\nover the bridge of the nose, or of hanging coquettishly on one ear, that\nsays to the eagle-eyed public: “I am chockfull.”",
        "I cannot call to mind a more powerful lecture on temperance, than the\nsilent pantomime of a man trying to hang his plug hat on an invisible peg\nin his own hall, after he had been watching the returns, a few years ago.\nI saw that he was excited and nervously unstrung when he came in, but I\ndid not fully realize it until he began to hang his hat on the smooth\nwall.",
        "At first he laughed in a good-natured way at his awkwardness, and hung it\nup again carefully; but at last he became irritated about it, and almost\nforgot himself enough to swear, but controlled himself. Finding, however,\nthat it refused to hang up, and that it seemed rather restless, anyhow, he\nput it in the corner of the hall with the crown up, pinned it to the floor\nwith his umbrella, and heaved a sigh of relief. Then he took off his\novercoat and, through a clerical error, pulled off his dress-coat also. I\nshowed him his mistake and offered to assist him back into his apparel,\nbut he said he hadn’t got so old and feeble yet that he couldn’t dress\nhimself.",
        "Later on he came into the parlor, wearing a linen ulster with the belt\ndrooping behind him like the broken harness hanging to a shipwrecked and\nstranded mule. His wife looked at him in a way that froze his blood. This\nstartled him so that he stepped back a pace or two, tangled his feet in\nhis surcingle, clutched wildly at the empty gas-light, but missed it and\nsat down in a tall majolica cuspidor.",
        "There were three games of whist going on when he fell, and there was a\ngood deal of excitement over the playing, but after he had been pulled out\nof the American tear jug and led away, everyone of the twelve\nwhist-players had forgotten what the trump was.",
        "They say that he has abandoned politics since then, and that now he don’t\ncare whether we have any more November elections or not. I asked him once\nif he would be active during the next campaign, as usual, and he said he\nthought not. He said a man couldn’t afford to be too active in a political\ncampaign. His constitution wouldn’t stand it.",
        "At that time he didn’t care much whether the American people had a\npresident or not. If every public-spirited voter had got to work himself\nup into a state of nervous excitability and prostration where reason\ntottered on its throne, he thought that we needed a reform.",
        "Those who wished to furnish reasons to totter on their thrones for the\nNational Central Committee at so much per tot, could do so; he, for one,\ndidn’t propose to farm out his immortal soul and plug hat to the party, if\nsixty million people had to stand four years under the administration of a\nsetting hen.",
        "Spring is now here. It has been here before, but not so much so, perhaps,\nas it is this year. In spring the buds swell up and bust. The “violets\"\nbloom once more, and the hired girl takes off the double windows and the\nstorm door. The husband and father puts up the screen doors, so as to fool\nthe annual fly when he tries to make his spring debut. The husband and\nfather finds the screen doors and windows in the gloaming of the garret.\nHe finds them by feeling them in the dark with his hands. He finds the\nrafters, also, with his head. When he comes down, he brings the screens\nand three new intellectual faculties sticking out on his brow like the\nbutton on a barn door.",
        "Spring comes with joyous laugh, and song, and sunshine, and the burnt\nsacrifice of the over-ripe boot and the hoary overshoe. The cowboy and the\nnew milch cow carol their roundelay. So does the veteran hen. The common\negg of commerce begins to come forth into the market at a price where it\ncan be secured with a step-ladder, and all nature seems tickled.",
        "There are four seasons–spring, summer, autumn and winter. Spring is the\nmost joyful season of the year. It is then that the green grass and the\nlavender pants come forth. The little robbins twitter in the branches, and\nthe horny-handed farmer goes joyously afield to till the soil till the\ncows come home.–Virgil.",
        "We all love the moist and fragrant spring. It is then that the sunlight\nwaves beat upon the sandy coast, and the hand-maiden beats upon the sandy\ncarpet. The man of the house pulls tacks out of himself and thinks of days\ngone by, when you and I were young, Maggie. Who does not leap and sing in\nhis heart when the dandelion blossoms in the low lands, and the tremulous\ntail of the lambkin agitates the balmy air?",
        "The lawns begin to look like velvet and the lawn-mower begins to warm its\njoints and get ready for the approaching harvest. The blue jay fills the\nforest with his classical and extremely au revoir melody, and the\ncurculio crawls out of the plum-tree and files his bill. The plow-boy puts\non his father’s boots and proceeds to plow up the cunning little angle\nworm. Anon, the black-bird alights on the swaying reeds, and the\nlightning-rod man alights on the farmer with great joy and a new rod that\ncan gather up all the lightning in two States and put it in a two-gallon\njug for future use.",
        "Who does not love spring, the most joyful season of the year? It is then\nthat the spring bonnet of the workaday world crosses the earth’s orbit and\nmakes the bank account of the husband and father look fatigued. The low\nshoe and the low hum of the bumble-bee are again with us. The little\nstriped hornet heats his nose with a spirit lamp and goes forth searching\nfor the man with the linen pantaloons. All nature is full of life and\nactivity. So is the man with the linen pantaloons. Anon, the thrush will\nsing in the underbrush, and the prima donna will do up her voice in a\nred-flannel rag and lay it away.",
        "I go now into my cellar to bring out the gladiola bulb and the homesick\nturnip of last year. Do you see the blue place on my shoulder? That is\nwhere I struck when I got to the foot of the cellar stairs. The gladiola\nbulbs are looking older than when I put them away last fall. I fear me\nthey will never again bulge forth. They are wrinkled about the eyes and\nthere are lines of care upon them. I could squeeze along two years without\nthe gladiola and the oleander in the large tub. If I should give my little\nboy a new hatchet and he should cut down my beautiful oleander, I would\ngive him a bicycle and a brass band and a gold-headed cane.",

        "“I believe I’ve got about the most instinct bulldog in the United States,\"\nsaid Cayote Van Gobb yesterday. “Other pups may show cuteness and cunning,\nyou know, but my dog, the Duke of Rawhide Buttes, is not only generally\nsmart, but he keeps up with the times. He’s not only a talented cuss, but\nhis genius is always fresh and original.”",
        "“What are some of his specialties, Van?” said I.",
        "“Oh, there’s a good many of ’em, fust and last. He never seems to be\ncontent with the achievements that please other dogs. You watch him and\nyou’ll see that his mind is active all the time. When he is still he’s\nworking up some scheme or another, that he will ripen and fructify later\non.",
        "“For three year’s I’ve had a watermelon patch and run it with more or less\nsuccess, I reckon. The Duke has tended to ’em after they got ripe, and I\nwas going to say that it kept his hands pretty busy to do it, but, to be\nmore accurate, I should say that it kept his mouth full. Hardly a night\nafter the melons got ripe and in the dark of the moon, but the Dude would\nsample a cowboy or a sheep-herder from the lower Poudre. Watermelons were\ngenerally worth ten cents a pound along the Union Pacific for the first\ntwo weeks, and a fifty-pounder was worth $5. That made it an object to\nkeep your melons, for in a good year you could grow enough on ten acres to\npay off the national debt.",
        "“Well, to return to my subject. Duke would sleep days during the season\nand gather fragments of the rear breadths of Western pantaloons at night.\nOne morning Duke had a piece of fancy cassimere in his teeth that I tried\nto pry out and preserve, so that I could identify the owner, perhaps, but\nhe wouldn’t give it up. I coaxed him and lammed him across the face and\neyes with an old board, but he wouldn’t give it to me. Then I watched him.\nI’ve been watchin’ him ever since. He took all these fragments of goods I\nfound, over into the garret above the carriage shed.",
        "“Yesterday I went in there and took a lantern with me. There on the floor\nthe Duke of Rawhide had arranged all the samples of Rocky Mountain\npantaloons with a good deal of taste, and I don’t suppose you’d believe\nit, but that blamed pup is collecting all these little scraps to make\nhimself a crazy quilt.",
        "“You can talk about instinct in animals, but, so far as the Duke of\nRawhide Buttes is concerned, it seems to me more like all-wool genius a\nyard wide.”",
        "Etiquette at hotels is a subject that has been but lightly treated upon by\nour modern philosophy, and yet it is a subject that lies very near to\nevery American heart. Had I not already more reforms on hand than I can\npossibly successfully operate I would gladly use my strong social\ninfluence and trenchant pen in that direction. Etiquette at hotels, both\non the part of the proprietor, and his hirelings, and the guest, is a\nmatter that calls loudly for improvement.",
        "The hotel waiter alone, would well repay a close study. From the tardy and\npolished loiterer of the effete East, to the off-hand and social equal of\nthe budding West, all waiters are deserving of philosophical scrutiny. I\nwas thrown in contact with a waiter in New York last summer, whose manners\nwere far more polished than my own. Every time I saw him standing there\nwith his immediate pantaloons and swallow-tail coat, and the far-away,\nchastened look of one who had been unfortunate, but not crushed, I felt\nthat I was unworthy to be waited upon by such a blue-blooded thoroughbred,\nand I often wished that we had more such men in Congress. And when he\nwould take my order and go away with it, and after the meridian of my life\nhad softened into the mellow glory of the sere and yellow leaf, when he\ncame back, still looking quite young, and never having forgotten me,\nrecognizing me readily after the long, dull, desolate years, I was glad,\nand I felt that he deserved something more than mere empty thanks and I\nsaid to him: “Ah, sir, you still remember me after years of privation and\nsuffering. When every one else in New York has forgotten me, with the\nexception of the confidence man, you came to me with the glad light of\nrecognition in your clear eye. Would you be offended if I gave you this\ntrifling testimonial of my regard?” at the same time giving him my note at\nthirty days.",
        "I wanted him to have something by which to always remember me, and I guess\nhe has.",
        "Speaking of waiters, reminds me of one at Glendive, Montana. We had to\ntelegraph ahead in order to get a place to sleep, and when we registered\nthe landlord shoved out an old double-entry journal for us to record our\nnames and postoffice address in. The office was the bar and before we\ncould get our rooms assigned us, we had to wait forty-five minutes for the\nlandlord to collect pay for thirteen drinks and lick a personal friend.\nFinally, when he got around to me, he told me that I could sleep in the\nnight bar-tender’s bed, as he would be up all night, and might possibly\nget killed and never need it again, anyhow. It would cost me $4 cash in\nadvance to sleep one night in the bartender’s bed, he said, and the house\nwas so blamed full that he and his wife had got to wait till things kind\nof quieted down, and then they would have to put a mattress on the 15 ball\npool table and sleep there.",
        "I called attention to my valuable valise that had been purchased at great\ncost, and told him that he would be safe to keep that behind the bar till\nI paid; but he said he wasn’t in the second-hand valise business, and so I\npaid in advance. It was humiliating, but he had the edge on me.",
        "At the tea table I noticed that the waiter was a young man who evidently\nhad not been always thus. He had the air of one who yearns to have some\none tread on the tail of his coat. Meekness, with me, is one of my\ncharacteristics. It is almost a passion. It is the result of personal\ninjuries received in former years at the hands of parties who excelled me\nin brute force and who succeeded in drawing me out in conversation, as it\nwere, till I made remarks that were injudicious.",
        "So I did not disagree with this waiter, although I had grounds. When he\ncame around and snorted in my ear, “Salt pork, antelope and cold beans,\"\nat the same time leaning his full weight on my back, while he evaded the\nrevenue laws by retailing his breath to the guests without a license, I\nthought I would call for what he had the most of, so I said if he didn’t\nmind and it wouldn’t be too much trouble, I would take cold beans.",
        "I will leave it to the calm, impassionate and unpartisan reader to state\nwhether that remark ought to create ill-feeling. I do not think it ought.\nHowever, he was irritable, and life to him seemed to be cold and dark. So\nhe went to the general delivery window that led into the cold bean\nlaboratory, and remarked in a hoarse, insolent, and ironical tone of\nvoice:",
        "“Nother damned suspicious looking character wants cold beans.”",
        "The American Indian approximates nearer to what man should be–manly,\nphysically perfect, grand in character, and true to the instincts of his\nconscience–than any other race of beings, civilized or uncivilized. Where\ndo we hear such noble sentiments or meet with such examples of heroism and\nself-sacrifice as the history of the American Indian furnishes? Where\nshall we go to hear again such oratory as that of Black Hawk and Logan?\nCertainly the records of our so-called civilization do not furnish it, and\nthe present century is devoid of it.",
        "They were the true children of the Great Spirit. They lived nearer to the\ngreat heart of the Creator than do their pale-faced conquerors of to-day\nwho mourn over the lost and undone condition of the savage. Courageous,\nbrave and the soul of honor, their cruel and awful destruction from the\nface of the earth is a sin of such magnitude that the relics and the\npeople of America may well shrink from the just punishment which is sure\nto follow the assassination of as brave a race as ever breathed the air of\nHeaven.",
        "I wrote the above scathing rebuke of the American people when I was 15\nyears of age. I ran across the dissertation yesterday. As a general rule,\nit takes a youth 15 years of age to arraign Congress and jerk the\nadministration bald-headed. The less he knows about things generally, the\nmore cheerfully will he shed information right and left.",
        "At the time I wrote the above crude attack upon the government, I had not\nseen any Indians, but I had read much. My blood boiled when I thought of\nthe wrongs which our race had meted out to the red man. It was at the time\nwhen my blood was just coming to a boil that I penned the above paragraph.\nTen years later I had changed my views somewhat, relative to the Indian,\nand frankly wrote to the government of the change. When I am doing the\nadministration an injustice, and I find it out, I go to the president\ncandidly, and say: “Look here, Mr. President, I have been doing you a\nwrong. You were right and I was erroneous. I am not pig-headed and\nstubborn. I just admit fairly that I have been hindering the\nadministration, and I do not propose to do so any more.”",
        "So I wrote to Gen. Grant and told him that when I was 15 years of age I\nwrote a composition at school in which I had arraigned the people and the\nadministration for the course taken toward the Indians. Since that time I\nhad seen some Indians in the mountains–at a distance–and from what I had\nseen of them I was led to believe that I had misjudged the people and the\nexecutive. I told him that so far as possible I would like to repair the\ngreat wrong so done in the ardor of youth and to once more sustain the arm\nof the government.",
        "He wrote me kindly and said he was glad that I was friendly with the\ngovernment again, and that now he saw nothing in the way of continued\nnational prosperity. He said he would preserve my letter in the archives\nas a treaty of peace between myself and the nation. He said only the day\nbefore he had observed to the cabinet that he didn’t care two cents about\na war with foreign nations, but he would like to be on a peace footing\nwith me. The country could stand outside interference better than\nintestine hostility. I do not know whether he meant anything personal by\nthat or not. Probably not.",
        "He said he remembered very well when he first heard that I had attacked\nthe Indian policy of the United States in one of my school essays. He\nstill called to mind the feeling of alarm and apprehension which at that\ntime pervaded the whole country. How the cheeks of strong men had blanched\nand the Goddess of Liberty felt for her back hair and exchanged her Mother\nHubbard dress for a new cast-iron panoply of war and Roman hay knife. Oh,\nyes, he said, he remembered it as though it had been yesterday.",
        "Having at heart the welfare of the American people as he did, he hoped\nthat I would never attack the republic again.",
        "And I never have. I have been friendly, not only personally, but\nofficially, for a good while. Even if I didn’t agree with some of the\nofficial acts of the president I would allow him to believe that I did\nrather than harass him with cold, cruel and adverse criticism. The\nabundant success of this policy is written in the country’s wonderful\ngrowth and prosperous peace.",
        "The red-eyed antagonist of truth is not found alone in the ranks of the\nnewspaper phalanx. You run up against him in all walks of life. He\nflourishes in all professions, and he is ready at all times to entertain.\nThere is quite a difference between a malicious falsehood and the\ndifferent shades of parables, fables with a moral, Sabbath-school books,\nnewspaper sketches, and anecdotes told to entertain.",
        "A malicious lie is injurious personally. A business lie is a falsehood for\nrevenue only. But the yarns that are spun around camp-fires, in mining and\nlogging camps, to while away a dull evening, are not within the\njurisdiction of the criminal code or the home missionary.",
        "On the train, yesterday several old lumbermen were telling about hard\nroads and steep hills, engineering skill and so forth. Finally they told\nabout “snubbing” a loaded team down bad hills, and one man said:",
        "“You might ’snub’ down a cheap hill, but you couldn’t do it on our road.\nWe tried it. Couldn’t do a thing. Finally we got to building snow-sheds\nand hauling sand. You build a snow-shed that covers the grade, then fill\nthe road in with two feet of loose sand, and you’re O.K. We did that last\nwinter, and when you drive a four-horse load of logs down through them\nlong snow-sheds on bare ground, mind ye, and the bobs go plowing through\nthe sand, the sled-shoes will make the fire fly so that you can read the\nPresident’s message at midnight.”",
        "Then an old man who went to Pike’s Peak during the excitement and returned\nafterward, woke up and yawned two or three times, and said they used to\nhave some trouble, a good many years ago getting over the range where the\nSouth Park road now goes from Chalk Creek Canon through Alpine Tunnel to\nthe Gunnison.",
        "“We tried ’snubbing’ and everything we could think of, but it was N.G.",
        "“Finally we got hold of a new kind of ’snub’ that worked pretty well. We\nhad a long table made a-purpose, that would reach to the foot of the hill\nfrom the top, and we’d tie a three-ton load to the end at the top of the\nhill; then we would hitch six mules to the end at the foot of the hill.\nWell, the principle of the thing was, that as the load went down on the\nGunnison side it would pull the mules up the opposite side, tails first.”",
        "“How did it work?”",
        "“Oh, it worked all right if the mules and the load balanced; but one day\nwe put on a light mule named Emma Abbott, and the load got a start down\nthe Gunnison side that made that old cable sing. The wagon tipped over and\nconcussed a keg of blasting powder, and that obliterated the rest of the\ngoods.",
        "“But the air on the other side was full of mules. You ought to seen ’em\ncome up that hill!",
        "“It takes considerable of a crisis to affect the natural reserve of six\nmules; but when they saw how it was, they backed up that mountain with\ngreat enthusiasm. They didn’t touch the ground but once in three thousand\nfeet, but they struck the canopy of heaven several times.",
        "“When the sky cleared up, we made a careful inventory of the stock.",
        "“We had a second-hand three-inch cable and some desiccated mule. We never\nwent to look for the wagon; but when the weather got warm, the Coyotes\nhelped us find Emma Abbott.",
        "“She was hanging by the ear in the crotch of an old hemlock tree.",
        "“Life was extinct.",
        "“We found a few more of the mules, but they were fractional.",
        "“Emma Abbott was the only complete mule we found.”",
        "I fixed myself and went out trout fishing on the only original\nKinnickinnick river last week. It was a kind of Rip Van Winkle picnic and\nfarewell moonlight excursion home. I believe that Rip Van Winkle, however,\nconfined himself to hunting mostly with an old musket that was on the\nretired list when Rip took his sleepy drink on the Catskills. If he could\nhave gone with me fishing last week over the old trail, digging\nangle-worms at the same old place where I left the spade sticking in the\ngrim soil twenty years ago–if we could have waded down the Kinnickinnick\ntogether with high rubber boots on, and got nibbles and bites at the same\nplaces, and found the same old farmers with nearly a quarter of a century\nadded to their lives and glistening in their hair, we would have had fun\nno doubt on that day, and a headache on the day following. This affords me\nan opportunity to say that trout may be caught successfully without a\ncorkscrew. I have tried it. I’ve about decided that the main reason why so\nmany large lies are told about the number of trout caught all over the\ncountry, is that at the moment the sportsman pulls his game out of the\nwater, he labors under some kind of an optical illusion, by reason of\nwhich he sees about nine trout where he ought to see only one.",
        "I wish I had as many dollars as I have soaked deceased angle-worms in that\nsame beautiful Kinnickinnick. There was a little stream made into it that\nwe called Tidd’s creek. It is still there. This stream runs across Tidd’s\nfarm, and Tidd twenty years ago wouldn’t allow anybody to fish in the\ncreek. I can still remember how his large hand used to feel, as he caught\nme by the nape of the neck and threw me over the fence with my amateur\nfishing tackle and a willow “stringer” with eleven dried, stiff trout on\nit. Last week I thought I would try Tidd’s creek again. It was always a\ngood place to fish, and I felt the same old excitement, with just enough\nvague forebodings in it to make it pleasant. Still, I had grown a foot or\nso since I used to fish there, and perhaps I could return the compliment\nby throwing the old gentleman over his own fence, and then hiss in his ear\n\"R-r-r-r-e-v-e-n-g-e!!!”",
        "I had got pretty well across the “lower forty” and had about decided that\nTidd had been gathered to his fathers, when I saw him coming with his head\nup like a steer in the corn. Tidd is a blacksmith by trade, and he has an\narm with hair on it that looks like Jumbo’s hind leg. I felt the same old\ndesire to climb the fence and be alone. I didn’t know exactly how to work\nit. Then I remembered how people had remarked that I had changed very much\nin twenty years, and that for a homely boy I had grown to be a remarkably\npicturesque-looking man. I trusted to Tidd’s failing eyesight and said:",
        "“How are you?”",
        "He said, “How are you?” That did not answer my question, but I didn’t mind\na little thing like that.",
        "Then he said: “I sposed that every pesky fool in this country knew I don’t\nallow fishing on my land.”",
        "“That may be,” says I, “but I ain’t fishing on your land. I always fish in\na damp place if I can. Moreover, how do I know this is your land? Carrying\nthe argument still further, and admitting that every peesky fool knows\nthat you didn’t allow fishing here, I am not going to be called a pesky\nfool with impunity, unless you do it over my dead body.” He stopped about\nten rods away and I became more fearless. “I don’t know who you are,” said\nI, as I took off my coat and vest and piled them up on my fish basket,\neager for the fray. “You claim to own this farm, but it is my opinion that\nyou are the hired man, puffed up with a little authority. You can’t order\nme off this ground till you show me a duly certified abstract of title and\nthen identify yourself. What protection does a gentleman have if he is to\nbe kicked and cuffed about by Tom, Dick and Harry, claiming they own the\nwhole State. Get out! Avaunt! If you don’t avaunt pretty quick I’ll scrap\nyou and sell you to a medical college.”",
        "He stood in dumb amazement a moment, then he said he would go and get his\ndeed and his shotgun. I said shotguns suited me exactly, and I told him to\nbring two of them loaded with giant powder and barbed wire. I would not\nlive alway. I asked not to stay. When he got behind the corn-crib I\nclimbed the fence and fled with my ill-gotten gains.",
        "The blacksmith in his prime may lick the small boy, but twenty years\nchanges their relative positions. Possibly Tidd could tear up the ground\nwith me now, but in ten more years, if I improve as fast as he fails, I\nshall fish in that same old stream again.",
        "Letter From New York.",
        "Dear friend.–Being Sunday, I take an hour to write you a letter in regard\nto this place. I came here yesterday without attracting undue attention\nfrom people who lived here. If they was surprised, they concealed it from\nme.",
        "I’ve camped out on the Chug years ago, and went to sleep with no live\nthing near me except my own pony, and woke up with the early song of the\ncoyote, and have been on the lonesome plain for days where it seemed to me\nthat a hostile would be mighty welcome if he would only say something to\nme, but I was never so lonesome as I was here in this big town last night,\nalthough it is the most thick settled place I was ever at.",
        "I was so kind of low and depressed that I strolled in to the bar at last,\nallowing that I could pound on the counter and call up the boys and get\nacquainted a little with somebody, just as I would at Col. Luke Murrin’s,\nat Cheyenne; but when I waved to the other parties, and told them to rally\nround the foaming beaker, they apologized, and allowed they had just been\nto dinner.",
        "Just been to dinner, and there it was pretty blamed near dark! Then I\nasked ’em to take a cigar, but they mostly cackillated they had no\noccasion.",
        "I was mad, but what could I do? They was too many for me, and I couldn’t\ncoerce the white livered aristocratic mob, for quicker’n scat they could\nhave hollored into a little cupboard they had there in the corner, and in\nless’n two minits they’d of had the whole police department and the hook\nand ladder company down there after me with a torch-light procession.",
        "So I swallowed my wrath and a tame drink of cultivated whiskey with Apollo\nBelvidere on the side, and went out into the auditorium of the hotel.",
        "Here I was very unhappy, being, as the editor of the Green River Gazette\nwould say, “the cynosure of all eyes.”",
        "I would rather not be a cynosure, even at a good salary; so I thought I\nwould ask the proprietor to build a fire in my room. I went up to the\nrecorder’s office, where the big hotel autograft album is, and asked to\nsee the proprietor.",
        "A good-looking young man came forward and asked me what he could do for\nme. I said if it wouldn’t be too much trouble, I wisht he would build a\nlittle fire in my room, and I would pay him for it; or, if he would show\nme where the woodpile was, I would build the fire myself–I wasn’t doing\nanything special at that time.",
        "He then whistled through his teeth and crooked his finger in a shrill tone\nof voice to a young party who was working for him, and told him to “build\na fire in four-ought-two.”",
        "I then sat down in the auditorium and read out of a railroad tract, which\nundertook to show that a party that undertook to ride over a rival road,\nmust do so because life was a burden to him, and facility, and comfort,\nand safety, and such things no object whatever. But still I was very\nlonely, and felt as if I was far, far away from home.",
        "I couldn’t have been more uncomfortable if I’d been a young man I saw\ntwenty-five years ago on the old overland trail. He had gone out to study\nthe Indian character, and to win said Indian to the fold. When I next saw\nhim he was twenty miles farther on. He had been thrown in contact with\nsaid Indian in the meantime. I judged he had been making a collection of\nIndian arrows. He was extremely no more. He looked some like Saint\nSebastian, and some like a toothpick-holder.",
        "I was never successfully lost on the plains, and so I started out after\nsupper to find my room. I found a good many other rooms, and tried to get\ninto them, but I did not find four-ought-two till a late hour; then I\nsubsidized the night patrol on the third floor to assist me.",
        "This is a nice place to stop, but it is a little too rich for my blood, I\nguess Not so much as regards price, but I can see that I am beginning to\nexcite curiosity among the boarders. People are coming here to board just\nbecause I am here, and it is disagreeable. I do not court notoriety.

        "During the hot weather very few crowns are worn this season, and a few\nhints as to the care of the crown itself may not be out of place.",
        "The crown should not be carelessly hung on the hat rack in the royal hall\nfor the flies to roost upon, but it should be thoroughly cleaned and put\naway as soon as the weather becomes too hot to wear it comfortably.",
        "Great care should be used in cleaning a gold-plated crown, to avoid\nwearing out the plate. Take a good stiff tooth brush, with a little\nsoapsuds, and clean the crown thoroughly at first, drying it on a clean\ntowel and taking care not to drop it on the floor and thus knock the\nmoss-agate diadem loose. Next, get a sleeve of the royal undershirt, or,\nin case you can not procure one readily, the sleeve of a duke or\nright-bower may be used. Soak this in vinegar, and, with a coat of\nwhiting, polish the crown thoroughly, wrap it in cotton-flannel and put in\nthe bureau. Sometimes, the lining of the crown becomes saturated with\nhair-oil from constant use and needs cleaning. In such cases the lining\nmay be removed, boiled in concentrated lye two hours, or until tender, and\nthen placed on the grass to bleach in the sun.",
        "Most crowns are size six-and-seven-eights, and they are therefore\nfrequently too large for the number six head of royalty. In such cases a\nnewspaper may be folded lengthwise and laid inside the sweat-band of the\ncrown, thus reducing the size and preventing any accident by which his or\nher majesty might lose the crown in the coal-bin while doing chores.",
        "After the Fourth of July and other royal holidays, this newspaper may be\nremoved, and the crown will be found none too large for the imperial dome\nof thought.",
        "Sceptres may be cleaned and wrapped in woolen goods during the hot months.\nThe leg of an old pair of pantaloons makes a good retort to run a sceptre\ninto while not in use. Never try to kill flies or drive carpet tacks with\nthe sceptre. It is an awkward tool at best, and you might ’easily knock a\nthumb nail loose. Great care should also be taken of the royal robe. Do\nnot use it for a lap robe while dining, nor sleep in it at night. Nothing\nlooks more repugnant than a king on the throne, with little white feathers\nall over his robe.",
        "It is equally bad taste to govern a kingdom in a maroon robe with white\nhorse hairs all over it.",
        "I once knew a king who invariably curried his horses in his royal robes;\nand if the steeds didn’t stand around to suit him, he would ever and anon\nwelt them in the pit of the stomach with his cast-iron sceptre. It was\ngreatly to the interest of his horses not to incur the royal displeasure,\nas the reader has no doubt already surmised.",
        "The robe of the king should only be worn while his majesty is on the\nthrone. When he comes down at night, after his day’s work, and goes out\nafter his coal and kindling-wood, he may take off his robe, roll it up\ncarefully, and stick it under the throne, where it will be out of sight.\nNothing looks more untidy than a fat king milking a bobtail cow in a\nMother Hubbard robe trimmed with imitation ermine.",
        "[An Open Letter.]",
        "Dear Sir: I have seen recently an open letter addressed to me, and written\nby you in a vein of confidence and strictly sub rosa. What you said was so\nstrictly confidential, in fact, that you published the letter in New York,\nand it was copied through the press of the country. I shall, therefore,\nendeavor to be equally careful in writing my reply.",
        "You refer in your kind and confidential note to your experience as an\ninvalid, and your rapid recovery after the use of red-hot Mexican pepper\ntea in a molten state.",
        "But you did not have such a physician as I did when I had spinal\nmeningitis. He was a good doctor for horses and blind staggers, but he was\nout of his sphere when he strove to fool with the human frame. Change of\nscene and rest were favorite prescriptions of his. Most of his patients\ngot both, especially eternal rest. He made a specialty of eternal rest.",
        "He did not know what the matter was with me, but he seemed to be willing\nto learn.",
        "My wife says that while he was attending me I was as crazy as a loon, but\nthat I was more lucid than the physician. Even with my little, shattered\nwreck of mind, tottering between a superficial knowledge of how to pound\nsand and a wide, shoreless sea of mental vacuity, I still had the edge on\nmy physician, from an intellectual point of view. He is still practicing\nmedicine in a quiet kind of way, weary of life, and yet fearing to die and\ngo where his patients are.",
        "He had a sabre wound on one cheek that gave him a ferocious appearance. He\nfrequently alluded to how he used to mix up in the carnage of battle, and\nhow he used to roll up his pantaloons and wade in gore. He said that if\nthe tocsin of war should sound even now, or if he were to wake up in the\nnight and hear war’s rude alarum, he would spring to arms and make tyranny\ntremble till its suspender buttons fell off.",
        "Oh, he was a bad man from Bitter Creek.",
        "One day I learned from an old neighbor that this physician did not have\nanything to do with preserving the Union intact, but that he acquired the\nscar on his cheek while making some experiments as a drunk and disorderly.\nHe would come and sit by my bedside for hours, waiting for this mortality\nto put on immortality, so that he could collect his bill from the estate,\nbut one day I arose during a temporary delirium, and extracting a slat\nfrom my couch I smote him across the pit of the stomach with it, while I\nhissed through my clenched teeth:",
        "“Physician, heal thyself.”",
        "I then tottered a few minutes, and fell back into the arms of my\nattendants. If you do not believe this, I can still show you the clenched\nteeth. Also the attendants.",
        "I had a hard time with this physician, but I still live, contrary to his\nearnest solicitations.",
        "I desire to state that should this letter creep into the press of the\ncountry, and thus become in a measure public, I hope that it will create\nno ill-feeling on your part.",
        "Our folks are all well as I write, and should you happen to be on Lake\nSuperior this winter, yachting, I hope you will drop in and see us. Our\nlatch string is hanging out most all the time, and if you will pound on\nthe fence I will call off the dog.",
        "I frequently buy a copy of your paper on the streets. Do you get the\nmoney?",
        "Are you acquainted with the staff of The Century, published in New York?\nI was in The Century office several hours last spring, and the editors\ntreated me very handsomely, but, although I have bought the magazine ever\nsince, and read it thoroughly, I have not seen yet where they said that\n\"they had a pleasant call from the genial and urbane William Nye.” I do\nnot feel offended over this. I simply feel hurt.",
        "Before that I had a good notion to write a brief epic on the “Warty Toad,\"\nand send it to The Century for publication, but now it is quite\ndoubtful.",
        "The Century may be a good paper, but it does not take the press\ndispatches, and only last month I saw in it an account of a battle that to\nmy certain knowledge occurred twenty years ago.",
        "Twenty centuries ago last Christmas there was born in Attica, near Athens,\nthe father of oratory, the greatest orator of whom history has told us.\nHis name was Demosthenes. Had he lived until this spring he would have\nbeen 2,270 years old; but he did not live. Demosthenes has crossed the\nmysterious river. He has gone to that bourne whence no traveler returns.",
        "Most of you, no doubt, have heard about it. On those who may not have\nheard it, the announcement will fall with a sickening thud.",
        "This sketch is not intended to cast a gloom over your hearts. It was\ndesigned to cheer those who read it and make them glad they could read.",
        "Therefore, I would have been glad if I could have spared them the pain\nwhich this sudden breaking of the news of the death of Demosthenes will\nbring. But it could not be avoided. We should remember the transitory\nnature of life, and when we are tempted to boast of our health, and\nstrength, and wealth, let us remember the sudden and early death of\nDemosthenes.",
        "Demosthenes was not born an orator. He struggled hard and failed many\ntimes. He was homely, and he stammered in his speech; but before his death\nthey came to him for hundreds of miles to get him to open their county\nfairs and jerk the bird of freedom bald-headed on the Fourth of July.",
        "When Demosthenes’ father died, he left fifteen talents to be divided\nbetween Demosthenes and his sister. A talent is equal to about $1,000. I\noften wish I had been born a little more talented.",
        "Demosthenes had a short breath, a hesitating speech, and his manners were\nvery ungraceful. To remedy his stammering, he filled his mouth full of\npebbles and howled his sentiments at the angry sea. However, Plutarch says\nthat Demosthenes made a gloomy fizzle of his first speech. This did not\ndiscourage him. He finally became the smoothest orator in that country,\nand it was no uncommon thing for him to fill the First Baptist Church of\nAthens full. There are now sixty of his orations extant, part of them\nwritten by Demosthenes and part of them written by his private secretary.",
        "When he started in, he was gentle, mild and quiet in his manner; but later\non, carrying his audience with him, he at last became enthusiastic. He\nthundered, he roared, he whooped, he howled, he jarred the windows, he\nsawed the air, he split the horizon with his clarion notes, he tipped over\nthe table, kicked the lamps out of the chandeliers and smashed the big\nbass viol over the chief fiddler’s head.",
        "Oh, Demosthenes was business when he got started. It will be a long time\nbefore we see another off-hand speaker like Demosthenes, and I, for one,\nhave never been the same man since I learned of his death.",
        "“Such was the first of orators,” says Lord Brougham. “At the head of all\nthe mighty masters of speech, the adoration of ages has consecrated his\nplace, and the loss of the noble instrument with which he forged and\nlaunched his thunders, is sure to maintain it unapproachable forever.”",
        "I have always been a great admirer of the oratory of Demosthenes, and\nthose who have heard both of us, think there is a certain degree of\nsimilarity in our style.",
        "And not only did I admire Demosthenes as an orator, but as a man; and,\nthough I am no Vanderbilt, I feel as though I would be willing to head a\nsubscription list for the purpose of doing the square thing by his\nsorrowing wife, if she is left in want, as I understand that she is.",
        "I must now leave Demosthenes and pass on rapidly to speak of Patrick\nHenry.",
        "Mr. Henry was the man who wanted liberty or death. He preferred liberty,\nthough. If he couldn’t have liberty, he wanted to die, but he was in no\ngreat rush about it. He would like liberty, if there was plenty of it; but\nif the British had no liberty to spare, he yearned for death. When the\ntyrant asked him what style of death he wanted, he said that he would\nrather die of extreme old age. He was willing to wait, he said. He didn’t\nwant to go unprepared, and he thought it would take him eighty or ninety\nyears more to prepare, so that when he was ushered into another world he\nwouldn’t be ashamed of himself.",
        "One hundred and ten years ago, Patrick Henry said: “Sir, our chains are\nforged. Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston. The war is\ninevitable, and let it come. I repeat it, sir, let it come!”",
        "In the spring of 1860, I used almost the same language. So did Horace\nGreeley. There were four or five of us who got our heads together and\ndecided that the war was inevitable, and consented to let it come.",
        "Then it came. Whenever there is a large, inevitable conflict loafing\naround waiting for permission to come, it devolves on the great statesmen\nand bald-headed literati of the nation to avoid all delay. It was so\nwith Patrick Henry. He permitted the land to be deluged in gore, and then\nhe retired. It is the duty of the great orator to howl for war, and then\nhold some other man’s coat while he fights.",
        "Strabusmus and Justice.",
        "Over in St. Paul I met a man with eyes of cadet blue and a terra cotta\nnose. His eyes were not only peculiar in shape, but while one seemed to\nconstantly probe the future, the other was apparently ransacking the\ndreamy past. While one rambled among the glorious possibilities of the\nremote yet golden ultimately, the other sought the somber depths of the\npreviously.",
        "He told me that years ago he had a mild case of strabismus and that both\neyes seemed to glare down his nose till he got restless and had them\noperated on. Those were the days when they used to fasten a crochet hook\nunder the internal rectus muscle and cut it a little with a pair of\noptical sheep shears. The effect of this course was to allow the eye to\ndrift back to a direct line; but this man fell into the hands of a drunken\nsurgeon who cut the muscle too much, and thereby weakened it so that it\ngradually swung past the point it ought to have stopped at, and he saw\nwith horror that his eye was going to turn out and protrude, as it were,\nso that a man could hang his hat on it. The other followed suit, and the\ntwo orbs that had for years looked along the bridge of the terra cotta\nnose, gradually separated, and while one looked toward next Christmas with\nfond anticipations, the other loved to linger over the remembrances of\nlast fall.",
        "This thing continued till he had to peer into the future with his off eye\nclosed, and vice versa.",
        "It is needless to say that he hungered for the blood of that physician and\nsurgeon. He tried to lay violent hands on him and wipe up the ground with\nhim and wear him out across a telegraph pole. But the authorities always\nprevented the administration of swift and lawful justice.",
        "Time passed on, till one night the abnormal wall-eyed man loosened a board\nin the sidewalk up town so that the physician and surgeon caught his foot\nin it and caused an oblique fracture of the scapula, pied his dura mater,\nbusted his cornucopia and wrecked his sarah-bellum.",
        "Perhaps I am in error as to some of these medical terms and their\northography, but that is about the way the man with the divergent orbs\ntold it to me.",
        "The physician and surgeon was quite a ruin. He had to wear clapboards on\nhimself for months, and there were other doctors, and laudable pus and\nthreatened gangrene and doctors’ bills, with the cemetery looming up in\nthe near future. Day after day he took his own anti-febrile drinks, and\nrammed his busted system full of iron and strychnine and beef tea and\ndover’s powders and hypodermic squirt till he wished he could die, but\ndeath would not come. He pawed the air and howled. They fed him his own\nnux vomica, tincture of rhubarb and phosphates and gruel, and brought him\nback to life with a crooked collar bone, a shattered shoulder blade and a\nlook of woe.",
        "Then he sued the town for $50,000 damages because the sidewalk was\nimperfect, and the wild-eyed man with the inflamed nose got on the jury.",
        "I will not explain how it was done, but there was a verdict for defendant\nwith costs on the Esculapian wreck. The man with the crooked vision is not\nhandsome, but he is very happy. He says the mills of the gods grind\nslowly, but they pulverise middling fine.",
        "After I had accumulated a handsome competence as city editor of the old\nMorning Sentinel at Laramie City, and had married and gone to\nhousekeeping with a gas stove and other luxuries, my place on the\nSentinel was taken by a newspaper man named Hopkins, who had just\ngraduated from a business college, and who brought a nice glazed grip\nsack and a diploma with him that had never been used.",
        "Hopkins wrote a fine Spencerian hand and wore a black and tan dog\nwhere-ever he went. The boys were willing to overlook his copper-plate\nhand, but they drew the line at the dog. He not only wrote in beautiful\nstyle, but he copied his manuscript, so that when it went in to the\nprinter it was as pretty as a wedding invitation.",
        "Hopkins ran the city page nine days, and then he came into the city hall\nwhere I was trying a simple drunk and bade me adieu.",
        "I just say this to show how difficult it is for a fine penman to get ahead\nas a journalist. Of course good, readable writers like Knox and John\nHancock may become great, but they have to be men of sterling ability to\nstart with.",
        "I have some of the most bloodcurdling horrors preserved for the purpose of\nshowing Hopkins’ wonderful and vivid style. I will throw them in.",
        "“A little son of our esteemed fellow townsman, J.H. Hayford, suffered\ngreatly last evening with virulent colic, but this A.M., as we go to\npress, is sleeping easily.”",
        "Think of shaking the social foundations of a mountain mining and stock\ntown with such grim, nervous prostrators as that! The next day he startled\nSouthern Wyoming and Northern Colorado and Utah with the maddening\nstatement that “our genial friend, Leopold Gussenhoven’s fine, yellow dog,\nFlorence Nightingale, had been seriously threatened with insomnia.”",
        "That was the style of mental calisthenics he gave us in a town where death\nby opium and ropium was liable to occur, and where five men with their\nMexican spurs on climbed one telegraph pole in one night and sauntered\ninto the remote indefinitely. Hopkins told me that he had tried to do what\nwas right, but that he had not succeeded very well. He wrung my hand and\nsaid:",
        "“I have tried hard to make the Sentinel fill a long want felt, but I\nhave not been fortunate. The foreman over there is a harsh man. He used to\ncome in and intimate in a frowning and erect tone of voice, that if I did\nnot produce that copy p.d.q., or some other abbreviation or other, that he\nwould bust my crust, or words of like import.",
        "“Now that’s no way to talk to a man of a nervous temperament who is\nengaged in copying a list of hotel arrivals, and shading the capitals as I\nwas. In the business college it was not that way. Everything was quiet,\nand there was nothing to jar a man like that.",
        "“Of course I would like to stay on the Sentinel and draw the princely\nsalary, but there are two hundred reasons why I cannot do it. So far as\nthe physical effort is concerned, I could draw the salary with one hand\ntied behind me, but there is too much turmoil and mad haste in daily\njournalism to suit me, and another thing, the proprietor of the Sentinel\nthis morning stole up behind me and struck me over the head with a\nwrought-iron side stick weighing ten pounds. If I had not concealed a coil\nspring in my plug hat, the blow would have been deleterious to me.",
        "“Then he threw me out of the door against a total stranger, and flung\npieces of coal at me and called me a copper-plate ass, and said that if I\never came into the office again he would assassinate me.",
        "“That is the principal reason why I have severed my connection with the\nSentinel.”",
        "As he said this, Mr. Hopkins took out a polka-dot handkerchief wiped away\na pearly tear the size of a walnut, wrung my hand, also the polka-dot\nwipe, and stole out into the great, horrid hence.",
        "The justice of the peace is sometimes a peculiarity, and if someone does\nnot watch him he will exceed his jurisdiction. It took a constable, a\nsheriff, a prosecuting attorney and a club to convince a Wyoming justice\nof the peace that he had no right to send a man to the penitentiary for\nlife. Another justice in Utah sentenced a criminal to be hung on the\nfollowing Friday between twelve and one o’clock of said day, but he\ncouldn’t enforce the sentence. A Wisconsin justice of the peace granted a\ndivorce and in two weeks married the couple over again–ten dollars for\nthe divorce and two dollars for the relapse. Another Badger justice bound\na young man over to appear and answer at the next term of the Circuit\nCourt for the crime of chastity, and the evidence was entirely\ncircumstantial, too.",
        "Another one, when his first case came up, jerked a candle box around\nbehind the dining-room table, put his hat on the back of his head,\nborrowed a chew of tobacco from the prisoner and said: “Now, boys, the\ncourt’s open. The first feller that says a word unless I speak to him will\nget paralyzed. Now tell your story.” Then each witness and the defendant\nreeled off his yarn without being sworn. The justice fined the defendant\nten dollars and made the complaining witness pay half the costs. The\njustice then took the fine and put it in his pocket, adjourned court, and\nin an hour was so full that it took six men to hold his house still long\nenough for him to get into the doors.",
        "A North Park justice of the peace and under-sheriff formed a partnership\nyears ago for the purpose of supplying people with justice at New York\nprices, and by doing a strictly cash business they dispensed with a good\ndeal of justice, such as it was.",
        "It was a misdemeanor to kill game and ship it out of the State, and as\nthere was a good deal killed there, consisting of elk, antelope and black\ntail deer especially, and as it could not be hauled out of the Park at\nthat season without going across the Wyoming line and back again into the\nState of Colorado, the under-sheriff would load himself down with\nwarrants, signed in blank, and station himself on horseback at the foot of\nthe pass to the North. He would then arrest everybody indiscriminately who\nhad any fraction of a deer, antelope or elk on his wagon, try the case\nthen and there, put on a fine of $25 to $75, which if paid never reached\nthe treasury, and then he would wait for another victim. The average man\nwould rather pay the fine than go back a hundred miles through the\nmountains to stand trial, so the under-sheriff and justice thrived for\nsome time. But one day the under-sheriff served his patent automatic\nwarrant on a young man who refused to come down. The officer then drew one\nof those large baritone instruments that generally has a coward at one end\nand a corpse at the other. He pointed this at the young man and assessed a\nfine of $50 and costs. Instead of paying this fine, the youth, who was\nquite nimble, but unarmed, knocked the bogus officer down with the butt\nend of his six-mule whip, took his self-cocking credentials away and lit\nout. In less than a week the justice and his copper were in the\nrefrigerator.",
        "I was once a justice of the peace, and a good many funny little incidents\noccurred while I held that office. I do not allude to my official life\nhere in order to call attention to my glowing career, for thousands of\nothers, no doubt, could have administered the affairs of the office as\nwell as I did, but rather to speak of one incident which took place while\nI was a J.P.",
        "One night after I had retired and gone to sleep a milkman, called Bill\nDunning, rang the bell and got me out of bed. Then he told me that a man\nwho owed him a milk bill of $35 was all loaded up and prepared to slip\nacross the line overland into Colorado, there to grow up with the country\nand acquire other indebtedness, no doubt. Bill desired an attachment for\nthe entire wagon-load of goods and said he had an officer at hand to serve\nthe writ.",
        "“But,” said I, as I wrapped a “welcome” husk door mat around my glorious\nproportions, “how do you know while we converse together he is not winging\nhis way down the valley of the Paudre?”",
        "“Never mind that, jedge,” says William. “You just fix the dockyments and\nI’ll tend to the defendant.”",
        "In an hour Bill returned with $35 in cash for himself and the entire costs\nof the court, and as we settled up and fixed the docket I asked Bill\nDunning how he detained the defendant while we made out the affidavit bond\nand writ of attachment.",
        "“You reckollect, jedge,” says William, “that the waggin wheel is held onto\nthe exle with a big nut. No waggin kin go any length of time without that\nthere nut onto the exle. Well, when I diskivered that what’s-his-name was\npacked up and the waggin loaded, I took the liberty to borrow one o’ them\nthere nuts fur a kind of momento, as it were, and I kept that in my pocket\ntill we served the writ and he paid my bill and came to his milk, if\nyou’ll allow me that expression, and then I says to him, ’Pardner,’ says\nI, you are going far, far away where I may never see you again. Take this\nhere nut,’ says I, ’and put it onto the exle of the oft hind wheel of your\nwaggin, and whenever you look at it hereafter, think of poor old Bill\nDunning, the milkman.’”",
        "I presume that I shall not be accused of sacrilege in referring to the\nChinese god as an inferior piece of art. Viewed simply from an artistic\nand economical standpoint, it seems to me that the Chinaman should have\nless pride in his bow-legged and inefficient god than in any other\nnational institution.",
        "I do not wish to be understood as interfering with any man’s religious\nviews; but when polygamy is made a divine decree, or a basswood deity is\nwhittled out and painted red, to look up to and to worship, I cannot treat\nthat so-called religious belief with courtesy and reverence. I am quite\nliberal in all religious matters. People have noticed that and remarked\nit, but the Oriental god of commerce seems to me to be greatly over-rated.\nHe seems to lack that genuine decision of character which should be a\nfeature of an over-ruling power.",
        "I ask the phrenologist to come with me and examine the head of the alleged\nJosh, and to state whether or not he believes that the properly balanced\nhead of a successful god should not have a more protuberant knob of\nspirituality, and a less pronounced alimentiveness. Should the bump of\ncombativeness hang out over the ear, while time, tune and calculation are\nnoticeably reticent? I certainly wot not.",
        "Again, how can the physiognomy of the Celestial Josh be consistent with a\nmoral and temperate god? The low brow would not indicate a pronounced\nomniscience, and the Jumbo ears and the copious neck would not impress me\nwith the idea of purity and spirituality.",
        "It is, no doubt, wrong to attack sacred matters for the purpose of gaining\nnotoriety; but I believe I am right, when I assert that the Chinese god\nmust go. We should not be Puritanical, but we might safely draw the line\nat the bow-legged and sedentary goddess of leprosy.",
        "If Confucius bowed the suppliant knee to that goggle-eyed jim-jam Josh,\nI am grieved to know it. If such was the case, the friends of Confucius\nshould keep the matter from me. I cannot believe that the great\nphilosopher wallowed in the dust at the feet of such a polka-dot\ncarricature of a gorilla’s horrid dream.",
        "I bought a Chinese god once, for four bits. He was not successful in\nthe profession which he aimed to follow. Whatever he may have been in\nChina, he was not a very successful god in the English language. I put\nhim upon the mantel, and the clock stopped, the servant girl sent in\nher resignation, and a large dog jumped through the parlor-window. All\nthis happened within two hours from the time I erected the lop-eared,\nknocked-kneed and club-footed Oolong in my household.",
        "Perhaps this may have been largely due to my ignorance of his habits.\nPossibly if I had been more familiar with his eccentricities, it would\nhave been all right; but as it was, there was no book of instructions\ngiven with him, and I couldn’t seem to make him work.",
        "During the week following, the prospect shaft of the New Jerusalem mine\nstruck a subterranean gulf-stream and water-logged the stock, a tall\nyellow dog, under the weight of a great woe, picked out my cistern to\nsuicide in, and I skated down the cellar-stairs on my shoulder-blades\nand the phrenological location known as Love of Home, in such a terrible\nmanner as to jar the foundations of the earth, and kick a large hole out\nof the bosom of the night.",
        "I then met with a change of heart, and overthrew the warty heathen god,\nand knocked him galley west. My hens at once began to watch the produce\nmarket, and, noticing the high price of eggs, commenced to orate with\ngreat zeal instead of standing around with their hands in their pockets. I\nsaw the new moon over my right shoulder, and all nature seemed gay once\nmore.",
        "The above are a few of my reasons for believing that the Chinese god is\neither greatly over-estimated, or else shippers and producers are flooding\nthe market with fraudulent gods.",
        "I have an uncle who is a physician, and a very busy one at that. He is a\nvery active man, and allows himself very little relaxation indeed. How\nmany times he has said to me, “Well, I can’t stand here and fool away my\ntime with you. I’ve got a typhoid fever patient down in the lower end of\ntown who will get well if I don’t get over there this forenoon.”",
        "He never allows himself any relaxation to speak of, except to demonstrate\nthe truth of spiritualism. He does love to monkey with the supernatural,\nand he delights in getting hold of some skeptical friend and convincing\nhim of the presence of spirits beyond a doubt. I’ve known him to ignore\ntwo cases of croup and one case of twins to attend a seance and help\nconvince a doubting Thomas on the spirit question.",
        "I believe that he and I, together with a little time in which to prepare,\ncould convince the most skeptical. He says that with a friend to assist\nhim, who is en rapport, and who has a little practice, he can reach the\nstoniest heart. He is a very susceptible medium indeed, and created a\ngreat furore in his own town. He said it was a great comfort to him to\nconverse with his former patients, and he felt kind of attached to them,\nso that he hated to be separated from them, even in death.",
        "Spiritualism had quite a run in his neighborhood at one time, as I have\nsaid. Even his own family yielded to the convincing proof and the\nastounding phenomena. If his wife hadn’t found some of his spiritual\ntracks down cellar, she would have remained firm, no doubt, but the doctor\nforgot and left his step-ladder down there, and that showed where the hole\nin the floor opened into his mysterious cabinet.",
        "He said if he had been a little more careful, no doubt he could have\nconvinced anybody of the presence of spirits or anything else. He said he\ndidn’t intend to give up as long as there was anything left in the cellar.",
        "He had such unwavering confidence in the phenomena that all he asked of\nanybody was faith and a buckskin string about two feet long.",
        "He and his brother, a reformed member of Congress, read the inmost\nthoughts of a skeptical friend all one evening by the aid of supernatural\npowers and a tin tube. The reformed member of Congress acted as medium,\nand the doctor, who was unfortunately and ostensibly called away into the\ncountry early in the evening, remained at the window outside, where he\ncould read the queries written by the victim on a slip of paper. Then he\nwould run around the house and murmur the same through a tin tube at\nanother window by the medium’s ear.",
        "It was astounding. The skeptical man would write some deep question on a\nslip of paper, and after the medium had felt of his brow, and groaned a\nfew hollow groans, and rolled his eyes up, he would answer it without\nhaving been within twenty feet of the question or the questioner. The\nvictim said he would never doubt again.",
        "What a comfort it was to know that immortality was an established fact. If\nhe could have heard a man talking in a low tone of voice through an old\ntin dipper handle, at the south window on the ground floor, and\noccasionally swearing at a mosquito on the back of his neck, he would have\nhesitated.",

        "I have always taken a great interest in war incidents, and more so,\nperhaps, because I wasn’t old enough to put down the rebellion myself. I\nhave been very eager to get hold of and hoard up in my memory all its\ngallant deeds of both sides, and to know the history of those who figured\nprominently in that great conflict has been one of my ambitions.",
        "I have also watched with interest the steady advancement of Phil Sheridan,\nthe black-eyed warrior with the florid face and the Winchester record. I\nhave also taken some pains to investigate the later history of the old\nWinchester war horse.",
        "“Old Rienzi died in our stable a few years after the war,” said a Chicago\nlivery man to me, a short time ago. “General Sheridan left him with us and\ninstructed us to take good care of him, which we did, but he got old at\nlast, and his teeth failed upon him, and that busted his digestion, and he\nkind of died of old age, I reckon.”",
        "“How did General Sheridan take it?”",
        "“Oh, well, Phil Sheridan is no school girl. He didn’t turn away when old\nRienzi died and weep the manger full of scalding regret. If you know\nSheridan, you know that he don’t rip the blue dome of heaven wide open\nwith unavailing wails. He just told us to take care of its remains, patted\nthe old cuss on the head a little and walked off. Phil Sheridan don’t go\naround weeping softly into a pink bordered wipe when a horse dies. He\nlikes a good horse, but Rienzi was no Jay-Eye-See for swiftness, and he\nwasn’t the purtiest horse you ever see, by no means.”",
        "“Did you read lately how General Sheridan don’t ride on horseback since\nhis old war horse died, and seems to have lost all interest in horses?”",
        "“No, I never did. He no doubt would rather ride in a cable car or a\ncarriage than to jar himself up on a horse. That’s all likely enough,\nbut, as I say, he’s a matter of fact little fighter from Fighttown. He\nnever stopped to snoot and paw up the ground and sob himself into\nbronchitis over old Rienzi. He went right on about his business, and,\nlike old King What’s-His-name he hollered for another hoss, and the War\nDepartment never slipped a cog.”",
        "Later on I read that the old war horse was called Winchester and that he\nwas still alive in a blue grass pasture in Kentucky. The report said that\nold Winchester wasn’t very coltish, and that he was evidently failing. I\ngathered the idea that he was wearing store teeth, and that his memory was\na little deficient, but that he might live yet for years. After that I met\na New York livery stable prince, at whose palace General Sheridan’s\nwell-known Winchester war horse died of botts in ’71. He told me all\nabout it and how General Sheridan came on from Chicago at the time, and\nheld the horse’s head in his lap while the fleet limbs that flew from\nWinchester down and saved the day, stiffened in the great, mysterious\nrepose of death. He said Sheridan wept like a child, and as he told the\ntouching tale to me I wept also. I say I wept. I wept about a quart, I\nwould say. He said also that the horse’s name wasn’t Winchester nor\nRienzi; it was Jim.",
        "I was sorry to know it. Jim is no name for a war horse who won a victory\nand a marble bust and a poem. You can’t respect a horse much if his name\nwas Jim.",
        "After that I found out that General Sheridan’s celebrated Winchester horse\nwas raised in Kentucky, also in Pennsylvania and Michigan; that he went\nout as a volunteer private; that he was in the regular service prior to\nthe war, and that he was drafted, and that he died on the field of battle,\nin a sorrel pasture, in ’73, in great pain on Governor’s Island; that he\nwas buried with Masonic honors by the Good Templars and the Grand Army of\nthe Republic; that he was resurrected by a medical college and dissected;\nthat he was cremated in New Orleans and taxidermed for the Military Museum\nat New York. Every little while I run up against a new fact relative to\nthis noted beast. He has died in nine different States, and been buried in\nthirteen different styles, while his soul goes marching on. Evidently we\nlive in an age of information. You can get more information nowadays, such\nas it is, than you know what to do with.",
        "To my friends, regardless of party.–Many friends having solicited me to\napply for a foreign mission under the present administration, I have\nfinally consented to do so, and last week filed my application for such\nmissions as might still remain vacant.",
        "To insure my appointment, much will remain for you to do. I now call upon\nmy friends to aid me by their united effort. I especially solicit the aid\nof my friends who have repeatedly heretofore promised it to me while\ndrunk.",
        "You will see at a glance that I can only make the application. You must\nsupport it by your petitions and letters. It would be of little use for\none man to write five thousand letters to the president, but if five\nthousand people each write him a letter in which casual reference is made\nto my social worth and 7-1/3 octave brain, it will make him pay attention.",
        "My idea would be for each of my friends to set aside one day in each week\nto write to the president, opening it in a chatty way by asking him if he\ndoes not think we are having rather a backward spring, and what he is\ndoing for his cut worms now, and how his folks are, etc., etc. Then\ngradually lead up to the statement that you think I would be an ornament\nto the administration if I should go abroad and linger on a foreign strand\nat $2,000 per linger and stationery.",
        "This will keep the president properly stirred up, and cause him to earn\nhis salary. The effect will be to secure the appointment at last, as you\nwill see if you persevere.",
        "I need not add that I will do what is right by my friends upon receiving\nmy commission.",
        "Do not neglect this suggestion because it comes to you in the form of a\ncircular, but remember it and act upon it. Remember that, although the\npresident is stubborn as Sam Hill, he will at last yield to fatigue, and\nwhen tired nature can hold out no longer, the last letter will drop from\nhis nerveless hand and he will surrender.",
        "Some of you will urge that I have been an offensive partisan, but when you\ncome to think it over I have not been so all-fired partisan. There have\nbeen days and days when it did not show itself very much. However, that is\nnot the point. I want your hearty indorsement and I want it to be entirely\nvoluntary, and if you do not give it, and give it freely and voluntarily,\nyou hadn’t better ask me for any more favors.",

        "I have a scrap-book full of such indorsements as this, and now, if my\nfriends will peel their coats and write as they should, I can make this\nadministration open its eyes.",
        "Several papers in Iowa have alluded to my being in town, and referred to\nthe fact that I had paid my bills while there. But press indorsements\nalone are not sufficient. What is needed is the written testimony of\nfriends and neighbors. No matter how poor or humble or worthless you may\nbe, write to Mr. Cleveland and tell him how much confidence you have in\nme, and if you can call to mind any little acts of kindness, or any times\nwhen I have got up in the night to give you a dollar, or nurse a colicky\nhorse for you, throw that in. Throw it in anyhow. It will do no harm, and\nmay do much good.",
        "I can solemnly promise all my friends that if they will secure my\nappointment to a foreign country for four years, I will not return during\nthat time. What more can I offer? I will stay longer if I am reappointed.\nI would do anything for my friends.",
        "Do not throw this circular carelessly aside. Read it carefully over and\nact upon it. Some of you are poor spellers, and will try to get out of it\nin that way. Others are in the penitentiary and cannot spare the time. But\nto one and all I say, write, and write regularly, to the president. Do not\nwait for a reply from him, because he is pretty busy now; but he will be\ntickled to death to hear from you, and anything you say about me will give\nhim great pleasure.",

        "No doubt the photograph habit, when once formed, is one of the most\nbaneful, and productive of the most intense suffering in after years, of\nany with which we are familiar. Some times it seems to me that my whole\nlife has been one long, abject apology for photographs that I have shed\nabroad throughout a distracted country.",
        "Man passes through seven distinct stages of being photographed, each one\nexceeding all previous efforts in that line.",
        "First he is photographed as a prattling, bald-headed baby, absolutely\ndestitute of eyes, but making up for this deficiency by a wealth of mouth\nthat would make a negro minstrel olive green with envy. We often wonder\nwhat has given the average photographer that wild, hunted look about the\neyes and that joyless sag about the knees. The chemicals and the indoor\nlife alone have not done all this. It is the great nerve tension and\nmental strain used in trying to photograph a squirming and dark red child\nwith white eyes, in such a manner as to please its parents.",
        "An old-fashioned dollar store album with cerebro-spinal meningitis, and\nfilled with pictures of half-suffocated children in heavily-starched white\ndresses, is the first thing we seek on entering a home, and the last thing\nfrom which we reluctantly part.",
        "The second stage on the downward road is the photograph of the boy with\nfresh-cropped hair, and in which the stiff and protuberant thumb takes a\nleading part.",
        "Then follows the portrait of the lad, with strongly marked freckles and a\nlook of hopeless melancholy. With the aid of a detective agency, I have\nsucceeded in running down and destroying several of these pictures which\nwere attributed to me.",
        "Next comes the young man, 21 years of age, with his front hair plastered\nsmoothly down over his tender, throbbing dome of thought. He does not care\nso much about the expression on the mobile features, so long as his left\nhand, with the new ring on it, shows distinctly, and the string of\njingling, jangling charms on his watch chain, including the cute little\nbasket cut out of a peach stone, stand out well in the foreground. If the\nyoung man would stop to think for a moment that some day he may become\neminent and ashamed of himself, he would hesitate about doing this.",
        "Soon after, he has a tintype taken in which a young lady sits in the\nalleged grass, while he stands behind her with his hand lightly touching\nher shoulder as though he might be feeling of the thrilling circumference\nof a buzz saw. He carries this picture in his pocket for months, and looks\nat it whenever he may be unobserved.",
        "Then, all at once, he discovers that the young lady’s hair is not done up\nthat way any more, and that her hat doesn’t seem to fit her. He then, in a\nfickle moment, has another tintype made, in which another young woman,\nwith a more recent hat and later coiffure, is discovered holding his hat\nin her lap.",
        "This thing continues, till one day he comes into the studio with his wife,\nand tries to see how many children can be photographed on one negative by\nholding one on each knee and using the older ones as a back-ground.",
        "The last stage in his eventful career, the old gentleman allows himself to\nbe photographed, because he is afraid he may not live through another\nlong, hard winter, and the boys would like a picture of him while he is\nable to climb the dark, narrow stairs which lead to the artist’s room.",
        "Sadly the thought comes back to you in after years, when his grave is\ngreen in the quiet valley, and the worn and weary hands that have toiled\nfor you are forever at rest, how patiently he submitted while his daughter\npinned the clean, stiff, agonizing white collar about his neck, and\nbrushed the velvet collar of his best coat; how he toiled up the long,\ndark, lonesome stairs, not with the egotism of a half century ago, but\nwith the light of anticipated rest at last in his eyes–obediently, as he\nwould have gone to the dingy law office to have his will drawn–and meekly\nleft the outlines of his kind old face for those he loved and for whom he\nhad so long labored.",
        "It is a picture at which the thoughtless may smile, but it is full of\npathos, and eloquent for those who knew him best. His attitude is stiff\nand his coat hunches up in the back, but his kind old heart asserts itself\nthrough the gentle eyes, and when he has gone away at last we do not\ncriticise the picture any more, but beyond the old coat that hunches up in\nthe back, and that lasted him so long, we read the history of a noble\nlife.",
        "Silently the old finger-marked album, lying so unostentatiously on the\ngouty centre table, points out the mile-stones from infancy to age, and\nback of the mistakes of a struggling photographer is portrayed the\nlaughter and the tears, the joy and the grief, the dimples and the gray\nhairs of one man’s life-tine.",
        "In answer to a former article relative to the dearth of woman here, we are\nnow receiving two to five letters per day from all classes and styles of\nyoung, middle-aged and old women who desire to come to Wyoming.",
        "Some of them would like to come here to work and obtain an honest\nlivelihood, and some of them desire to come here and marry cattle kings.",
        "A recent letter from Michigan, written in lead pencil, and evidently\nduring hours when the writer should have been learning her geography\nlesson, is very enthusiastic over the prospect of coming out here where\none girl can have a lover for every day in the week. She signs herself\nRosalinde, with a small r, and adds in a postscript that she “means\nbusiness.”",
        "Yes, Rosalinde, that’s what we are afraid of. We had a kind of a vague\nfear that you meant business, so we did not reply to your letter. Wyoming\nalready has women enough who write with a lead pencil. We are also pretty\nwell provided with poor spellers, and we do not desire to ransack Michigan\nfor affectionate but sap-headed girls.",
        "Stay in Michigan, Rosalinde, until we write to you, and one of these days\nwhen you have been a mother eight or nine times, and as you stand in the\ngolden haze in the back yard, hanging out damp shirts on an uncertain\nline, while your ripe and dewy mouth is stretched around a bass-wood\nclothes pin, you will thank us for this advice.",
        "Michigan is the place for you. It is the home of the Sweet Singer and the\nabiding place of the Detroit Free Press. We can’t throw any such\ninfluences around you here as those you have at your own door.",
        "Do not despair, Rosalinde. Some day a man, with a great, warm, manly heart\nand a pair of red steers, will see you and love you, and he will take you\nin his strong arms and protect you from the Michigan climate, just as\ndevotedly as any of our people here can. We do not wish to be\nmisunderstood in this matter. It is not as a lover that we have said so\nmuch on the girl question, but in the domestic aid department, and when we\nget a long letter from a young girl who eats slate pencils and reads Ouida\nbehind her atlas, we feel like going over there to Michigan with a trunk\nstrap and doing a little missionary work.",
        "I have been thinking the matter over seriously and I have decided that if\nI had my life to live over again, I would like to be an eccentric\nmillionaire.",
        "I have eccentricity enough, but I cannot successfully push it without more\nmeans.",
        "I have a great many plans which I would like to carry out, in case I could\nunite the two necessary elements for the production of the successful\neccentric millionaire.",
        "Among other things, I would be willing to bind myself and give proper\nsecurity to any one who would put in money to offset my eccentricity, that\nI would ultimately die. We all know how seldom the eccentric millionaire\nnow dies. I would be willing to inaugurate a reform in that direction.",
        "I think now that I would endow a home for men whose wives are no longer\nable to support them. In many cases the wife who was at first able to\nsupport her husband comfortably, finally shoulders a church debt, and in\ntrying to lift that she overworks and impairs her health so that she\nbecomes an invalid, while hor husband is left to pine away in solitude or\ndependent on the cold charities of the world.",
        "My heart goes out toward those men even now, and in case I should fill the\ngrave of the eccentric millionaire, I am sure that I would do the square\nthing by them.",
        "The method by which our wives in America are knocking the church debt\nsilly, by working up their husbands’ groceries into “angel food” and\nselling them below actual cost, is deserving of the attention of our\nnational financiers.",
        "The church debt itself is deserving of notice in this country. It\ncertainly thrives better under a republican form of government than any\nother feature of our boasted civilization. Western towns spring up\neverywhere, and the first anxiety is to name the place, the second to\nincur a church debt and establish a roller rink.",
        "After that a general activity in trade is assured. Of course the general\nhostility of church and rink will prevent ennui and listlessness, and\nthe church debt will encourage a business boom. Naturally the church debt\ncannot be paid without what is generally known through the West as the\n\"festival and hooraw.” This festival is an open market where the ladies\ntrade the groceries of their husbands to other ladies’ husbands, and\neverybody has a “perfectly lovely time.” The church clears $2.30, and\nthirteen ladies are sick all the next day.",
        "This makes a boom for the physicians and later on for the undertaker and\ngeneral tombist. So it will be seen that the Western town is right in\nestablishing a church debt as soon as the survey is made and the town\nproperly named. After the first church debt has been properly started,\nothers will rapidly follow, so that no anxiety need be felt if the church\nwill come forward the first year and buy more than it can pay for.",
        "The church debt is a comparatively modern appliance, and yet it has been\nproductive of many peculiar features. For instance, we call to mind the\nclergyman who makes a specialty of going from place to place as a\nsuccessful debt demolisher. He is a part of the general system, just as\nmuch as the ice cream freezer or the buttonhole bouquet.",
        "Then there is a row or social knock-down-and-drag-out which goes along\nwith the church debt. All these things add to the general interest, and to\nacquire interest in one way or another is the mission of the c.d.",
        "I once knew a most exemplary woman who became greatly interested in the\nwiping out of a church debt, and who did finally succeed in wiping out the\ndebt, but in its last expiring death struggle it gave her a wipe from\nwhich she never recovered. She had succeeded in begging the milk and the\ncream, and the eggs and the sandwiches, and the use of the dishes and the\nsugar, and the loan of an oyster, and the use of a freezer and fifty\nbutton-hole bouquets to be sold to men who were not in the habit of wearing\nbouquets, but she could not borrow a circular artist to revolve the crank\nof the freezer, so she agitated it herself. Her husband had to go away\nprior to the festivities, but he ordered her not to crank the freezer. He\nhad very little influence with her, however, and so to-day he is a\nwidower. The church debt was revived in the following year, and now there\nisn’t a more thriving church debt anywhere in the country. Only last week\nthat church traded off $75 worth of groceries, in the form of asbestos\ncake and celluloid angel food, in such a way that if the original cost of\nthe groceries and the work were not considered, the clear profit was $13,\nafter the hall rent was paid. And why should the first cost of the\ngroceries be reckoned, when we stop to think that they were involuntarily\nfurnished by the depraved husband and father.",
        "I must add, also, that in the above estimate doctors’ bills and funeral\nexpenses are not reckoned.",
        "I’m getting to be quite a connoisseur of hotel keys as I get older. For\nten years I have been collecting these mementoes of travel and cording\nthem away in my key cabinet. Some have square brass tags attached to them,\nothers have round ones. Still others affect the octagonal, the fluted, the\nhexagonal, the scalloped, the plain, the polished, the docorated, the\nchaste, the Etruscan, the metropolitan, the rural, the cosmopolitan, the\nshirred, the tucked, the biased, the high neck and long sleeve or the\ndecolette style of brass check.",
        "I have, so far, paid my bills, but I have not returned the keys to my\nroom. Hotel proprietors will please take notice and govern themselves\naccordingly. When my visit to a pleasant city has become a beautiful\nmemory only, I all at once sit down on something hard and find that it is\nthe key to my former room at the hotel. Sitting down on a key tag of\ncorrugated brass, as big as a buckwheat pancake, would remind most anyone\nof something or other.",
        "I generally leave my tooth-brush in my room and carry off the key as a\nkind of involuntary swap, so far as the hotel proprietor is concerned, but\nI do not think it is a mutual benefit, particularly. I cannot use the key\nto a hotel 500 miles away, and so far as a tooth-brush is concerned, it\ngenerally has pleasant associations only for the owner. A man is fond of\nhis own toothbrush, but it takes years for him to love the tooth-brush of\na stranger.",
        "There are a good many associations attached to these keys, like the tags.\nThey point backward to the rooms to which the keys belong. Here is a fat\none that led to room number 33-1/2 in the Synagogue hotel. It was a\ncheerful room, where the bell boy said an old man had asphyxiated himself\nwith gas the previous week. I had never met the old man before, but that\nnight, about 1 o’clock A.M., I had the pleasure of his acquaintance. He\ncame in a sad and reproachful way, and showed me how the post-mortem\npeople had disfigured him. Of course it was a little tough to be mutilated\nby an inquest, but that’s no reason why he should come back there and\noccupy a room that I was paying for so that I could be alone. He showed me\nhow he blew out the gas, and told me how a man could successfully blow\ndown the muzzle of a shot-gun or a gas jet, but both of these weapons had\na way of blowing back.",
        "I have a key that brings back to me the memory of a room that I lived in\ntwo days at one time. I do not mean that I lived the two days at once, but\nthat at one period I occupied that room, partially, for two days and two\nnights, I say I partially occupied it, because I used to occupy it days\nand share it nights with others; that is, I tried to occupy it nights. I\ntried to get the clerk to throw off something because I didn’t have the\nexclusive use of the room. He wouldn’t throw off anything. He even wanted\nto fight me because I said that the room was occupied before I got it and\nafter I left it. Finally, I told him that if he would throw a bed quilt\nover his diamond, so I could see him, I would fight him with buckwheat\ncakes at five-hundred miles. I took my position the next morning at the\nplace appointed, but he did not appear.",
        "January 1.–I awoke late this forenoon with a pain through the head and a\ntaste of ennui in the mouth, which I can hardly account for. Can it be a\nresult of the party last evening? I ween it may be so. We had a lovely\ncard party last evening. It was very enjoyable, indeed. Whist was the\ngame.",
        "January 3.–Yesterday all day I was unable to leave my room, owing to a\nheadache and nervous prostration, caused by late hours and too much\ncompany, the doctor said. It is too bad, and yet I do so much enjoy our\ncard parties and the excitement of the game. To-night I am to take part in\na little quiet game of draw poker, I think they call it. I have not had\nany experience heretofore in the game, but trust I shall soon learn it.\nThere has been some talk about £1 ante and £5 limit. I do not exactly\nunderstand the terms. I hope it does not mean anything wrong.",
        "January 4.–Poker is an odd game, indeed. I think it quite exciting,\nthough at first the odd terms rather confused me. I had not been\naccustomed to such phrases as “show down,” “bob-tail flush,” and “King\nfull.” I must ask Brown, as soon as his knees are able to be out, to\nexplain the meaning of these terms a little more fully to me. If poor\nBrown’s knees are not better soon, I shall be on kneesy about him. [Here\nthe diary has the appearance of being blurred with tears.] A bob-tail\nflush, I learn, is something very disagreeable to have. One gentleman said\nlast evening that another bob-tail flush would certainly paralyze him. I\ngather from that that it is something like a hectic flush. I can\nunderstand the game called “old sledge,” and have become quite familiar\nwith such terms as “beg,” “gimmeone,” “I’ve got the thin one,” “how high\nis that?” “one horse on me,” “saw-off,” etc., etc., but poker is full of\nsurprises. It seems so odd to see a gentleman “show out on a pair of\ndeuces” and gather in upward of two pounds with great merriment, while the\nremainder of the party seem quite bored. One gentleman last evening showed\nout on a full hand with “treys at the head,” putting £3 12s. in his purse\nwith great glee, while another one of the party who had not shown up, but\nI am positive had a better hand, became so angered that he got up and\nkicked four front teeth out of the mouth of a favorite dog worth £20. I\ntook part in a spade flush during the evening and was quite successful, so\nthat I can easily pay my traveling expenses and have a few shillings to\nbuy ointment for poor Brown. It was my first winning, and made me quiver\nall over with excitement. The game is already very fascinating to me, and\nI am becoming passionately fond of it.",
        "January 6.–I have just learned fully what a bob-tail flush is. It cost me\n£50. I like information, but I do not like to buy it when it comes so\nhigh. I drew two to fill in a heart flush last evening, and advanced the\nmoney to back up my judgment; but one of the hearts I drew was a club,\nwhich was entirely useless to me. I have sent out a sheriff with a bulldog\nto ascertain if he can find the whereabouts of the party who started this\npoker game, I do not know when I have felt so bored. After that I was so\ntimid that I allowed a friend to walk off with £2 on a pair of deuces. I\nsaid to him that I called that a deuced bore, and he laughed heartily.",
        "I find that you should not be too ready to show by your countenance\nwhether you are bored or pleased in poker. Tour opponent will take\nadvantage of it and play accordingly. It cost me £8 10s. to acquire a\nknowledge of this fact. If all the information I ever got had cost me as\nmuch as this poker wisdom, I would not now have two pennies to jingle\ntogether in my purse. Still, we have had a good time, take it all in all,\nand I shall not soon forget the evenings we have spent here together\nbuying knowledge regardless of cost. I think I shall try to control my\nwild thirst for information awhile, however, till I can get some more\nfunds.",

        "While stopping at the hotel, two frolicsome young women hired the porter\nto procure the young man’s pantaloons at dead of night They then sewed up\nthe bottoms of the legs, threw the doctored garment back through the\ntransom and squealed “Fire!”",
        "When he got into the hall he was vainly trying to stab one foot through\nthe limb of his pantaloons while he danced around on the other and joined\nin the general cry of “Fire!” The hall seemed filled with people, who were\nrunning this way and that, ostensibly seeking a mode of egress from the\nflames, but in reality trying to dodge the mad efforts of the young man,\nwho was trying to insert himself in his obstinate pantaloons.",
        "He did not tumble, as it were, until the night watchman got a Babcock fire\nextinguisher and played on him. I do not know what he played on him. Very\nlikely it was, “Sister, what are the wild waves saying?”",

Of the\nfirst, there are those who tried it and found that they could make more in\nhalf the time at something else, and so quit the field, and those who\nfailed to touch the great heart and pocketbook of the public, and\ntherefore subsided. Those who are writing for the press now, whether\nputting together copy by the mile within the sound of the rumbling engine\nand press, or scattered through the country writing more at their leisure,\nfind that they have to lay aside every weight and throw off all the\nincumbrances of the mossy past.",
        "One thing, however, still clings to the editor like a dab of paste on a\nwhite vest or golden fleck of scrambled egg on a tawny moustache. One\nrelic of barbarism rears in gaunt form amid the clash and hurry and rush\nof civilization, and in the dazzling light of science and smartness.",
        "It is “we.”",
        "The budding editor of the rural civilizer for the first time peels his\ncoat and sharpens his pencil to begin the work of changing the great\ncurrent of public opinion.

He has buckled on his armor to paralyze monopoly and\npurify the ballot He has hitched up his pantaloons with a noble resolve\nand covered his table with virgin paper.",
        "He is young, and he is a little egotistical, also. He wants to say, “I\nbelieve” so and so, but he can’t. Perspiration breaks out all over him.

The\nslimy demon of the editor’s life is there, sitting on the cloth bound\nvolume containing the report of the United States superintendent of swine\ndiseases.",
        "Wherever you find a young man unloading a Washington hand press to fill a\nlong-felt want, there you will find the ghastly and venomous “we,” ready\nto look over the shoulder of the timid young mental athlete.

        "September does not always indicate golden sunshine, and ripening corn, and\nold gold pumpkin pies on the half-shell. We look upon it as the month of\nglorious perfection in the handiwork of the seasons and the time when the\nripened fruits are falling; when the red sun hides behind the bronze and\nmisty evening, and says good night with reluctance to the beautiful\nharvests and the approaching twilight of the year.",

The soft air of\nsecond summer in the Rocky Mountains blew gently past our ears as we rode\nup the valley of the Little Laramie, to camp the first night at the head\nof the valley behind Sheep Mountain. The whole party was full of joy. Even\nJudge Blair, with the frosts of over sixty winters in his hair, broke\nforth into song. That’s the only thing I ever had against Judge Blair. He\nwould forget himself sometimes and burst forth into song.",
        "The following day we crossed the divide and rode down the gulch into the\ncamp on Douglass Creek, where the musical thunder of the stamp mills\nseemed to jar the ground, and the rapid stream below bore away on its\nturbid bosom the yellowish tinge of the golden quartz. It was a perfect\nday, and Wheeler and I blessed our stars and, instead of breathing the air\nof sour paste and hot presses in the newspaper offices, away in the\nvalley, we were sprawling in the glorious sunshine of the hills, playing\ndraw poker with the miners in the evening, and forgetful of the daily\nnewspaper where one man does the work and the other draws the salary. It\nwas heaven. It was such luxury that we wanted to swing our hats and yell\nlike Arapahoes.",
        "The next morning we were surprised to find that it had snowed all night\nand was snowing still. I never saw such flakes of snow in my life. They\ncame sauntering through the air like pure, white Turkish towels falling\nfrom celestial clothes-lines. We did not return that day. We played a few\ngames of chance, but they were brief. We finally made it five cent ante,\nand, as I was working then for an alleged newspaper man who paid me $50\nper month to edit his paper nights and take care of his children daytimes,\nI couldn’t keep abreast of the Judge, the Sheriff and the Superintendent\nof the Keystone.",
        "The next day we had to go home. The snow lay ankle-deep everywhere and the\nair was chilly and raw. Wheeler and I tried to ride, but the mountain road\nwas so rough that the horses could barely move through the snow, dragging\nthe buggy after them. So we got out and walked on ahead to keep warm. We\ngained very fast on the team, for we were both long-legged and measured\noff the miles like a hired man going to dinner. I wore a pair of\nglove-fitting low shoes and lisle-thread socks. I can remember that yet. I\nwould advise anyone going into the mines not to wear lisle-thread socks\nand low shoes. You are liable to stick your foot into a snow-bank or a mud\nhole and dip up too much water. I remember that after we had walked\nthrough the pine woods down the mountain road a few miles, I noticed that\nthe bottoms of my pantaloons looked like those of a drowned tramp I saw\nmany years ago in the morgue. We gave out after a while, waited for the\nteam, but decided that it had gone the other road. All at once it flashed\nover us that we were alone in the woods and the storm, wet, nearly\nstarved, ignorant of the road and utterly worn out!",
        "It was tough!",
        "I never felt so blue, so wet, so hungry, or so hopeless in my life. We\nmoved on a little farther. All at once we came out of the timber. There\nwas no snow whatever! At that moment the sun burst forth, we struck a\ndeserted supply wagon, found a two-pound can of Boston baked beans, got an\naxe from the load, chopped open the can, and had just finished the\ntropical fruit of Massachusetts when our own team drove up, and joy and\nhope made their homes once more in our hearts.",

        "A farmer in the Kinnekinnick Valley was paid $1,000 while he was loading\nhay. He put it in his vest pocket, and after he had unloaded the hay he\ndiscovered that he had lost it, and no doubt had pitched the whole load\ninto the mow on top of it. He went to work and pitched it all out, a\nhandful at a time, upon the barn floor, and when the hired man’s fork tine\ncame up with a $100 bill on it he knew they had struck a lead. He got it\nall.",
        "A man gave me two $5 bills once to pay a balance on some store teeth and\nasked me to bring the teeth back with me. The dentist was fifteen miles\naway and when I got there I found I had lost the money. That was before I\nhad amassed much of a fortune, so I went to the tooth foundry and told the\nforeman that I had started with $10 to get a set of teeth for an intimate\nfriend, but had lost the funds. He said that my intimate friend would, no\ndoubt, have to gum it awhile. Owing to the recent shrinkage in values he\nwas obliged to sell teeth for cash, as the goods were comparatively\nuseless after they had been used one season. I went back over the same\nroad the next day and found the money by the side of the road, although a\nhundred teams had passed by it.",
        "A young man, one spring, plowed a pocket-book and $30 in greenbacks under,\nand by a singular coincidence the next spring it was plowed out, and,\nthough rotten clear through, was sent to the Treasury, where it was\ndiscovered that the bills were on a Michigan National Bank, whither they\nwere sent and redeemed.",
        "I lost a roll of a hundred dollars the spring of ’82, and hunted my house\nand the office through, in search for it, in vain. I went over the road\nbetween the office and the house twenty times, but it was useless. I then\nadvertised the loss of the money, giving the different denominations of\nthe bills and stating, as was the case, that there was an elastic band\naround the roll when lost. The paper had not been issued more than an hour\nbefore I got my money, every dollar of it. It was in the pocket of my\nother vest.",

        "Apropos of recent bank failures, I want to tell this one on James S.\nKelley, commonly called “Black Jim.” He failed himself along in the\nfifties, and by a big struggle had made out to pay everybody but Lo\nBartlett, to whom he was indebted in the sum of $18. He got this money,\nfinally, and as Lo wasn’t in town, Black Jim put it in a bank, the name of\nwhich has long ago sunk into oblivion. In fact, it began the oblivion\nbusiness about forty-eight hours after Jim had put his funds in there.",

        "“I wanted to see you about a certificate of deposit I’ve got here on your\nbank for eighteen dollars.”",

        "“Well, I am here to get $18 or to leave you looking like a giblet pie.\nEighteen dollars will relieve you of this mental strain, but if you do not\nput up I will paper this wall with your classic features and ruin the\ncarpet with what remains.”",
        "The president hesitated a moment. Then he took a roll out of his boot and\npaid Jim eighteen dollars.",

        "“No,” says Jim, “not till I get there.”",
        "When the crowd got back, however, the president had fled and he has\nremained fled ever since. The longer he remained away and thought it over,\nthe more he became attached to Canada, and the more of a confirmed and\nincurable fugitive he became.",

She is now sitting on the\nfront stoop of the golden whence.",
        "So, after the last sad rites, the broken-hearted son-in-law presented the\nphysician with a handsome hound with long, slender legs and a wire tail,\nas a token of esteem and regard.",

        "One day, while the doctor was away administering a subcutaneous injection\nof morphine to a hay-fever patient, he left Nemesis in the office alone\nwith a piece of rag-carpet and his surging thoughts.",
        "At first Nemesis closed his eyes and breathed hard, then he arose and ate\npart of an ottoman, then he got up and scratched the paper off the office\nwall and whined in a sad tone of voice.",
        "A young Italian hound has a peculiarly sad and depressing song.",
        "Then Nemesis got up on the desk and poured the ink and mucilage into one\nof the drawers on some bandages and condition-powders that the doctor used\nin his horse-practice.",
        "Nemesis then looked out of the window and wailed. He filled the room with\nrobust wail and unavailing regret.",
        "After that he tried to dispel his ennui with one of the doctor’s old\nfelt hats that hung on a chair; but the hair oil with which it was\nsaturated changed his mind.",
        "The doctor had magenta hair, and to tone it down so that it would not\nraise the rate of fire insurance on his office, he used to execute some\nstudies on it in oil–bear’s oil.",
        "This gave his hair a rich mahogany shade, and his hat smelled and looked\nlike an oil refinery.",
        "That is the reason Nemesis spared the hat, and ate a couple of\nporousplasters that his master was going to use on a case of croup.",
        "At that time the doctor came in, and the dog ran to him with a glad cry of\npleasure, rubbing his cold nose against his master’s hand. The able\nveterinarian spoke roughly to Nemesis, and throwing a cigar-stub at him,\nbroke two of the animal’s delicate legs.",
        "After that there was a low discordant murmur and the angry hum of medical\nworks, lung-testers, glass jars containing tumors and other bric-a-brac,\npaper-weights and Italian grayhound bisecting the orbit of a redheaded\nhorse-physician with dude shoes.",
        "When the police came in, it was found that Nemesis had jumped through a\nglass door and escaped on two legs and his ear.",
        "Out through the autumnal haze, across the intervening plateau, over the\nlow foot-hills, and up the Medicine Bow Range, on and ever onward sped the\ntimid, grieved and broken-hearted pup, accumulating with wonderful\neagerness the intervening distance between himself and the cruel promoter\nof the fly-blister and lingering death.",

        "How prone we are to forget the devotion of a dumb brute that thoughtlessly\neats our lace lambrequins, and ere we have stopped to consider our mad\ncourse, we have driven the loving heart and the warm wet tongue and the\ncold little black nose out of our home-life, perhaps into the cold, cold\ngrave or the bleak and relentless pound.",
        "They do things differently in China. Here in America, when a man burgles\nyour residence, you go and confide in a detective, who keeps your secret\nand gets another detective to help him. Generally that is the last of it.\nIn China, not long ago, the house of a missionary was entered and\nvaluables taken by the thieves. The missionary went to the authorities\nwith his tale and told them whom he suspected. That’s the last he heard of\nthat for three weeks. Then he received a covered champagne basket from the\nDepartment of Justice. On opening it he found the heads of the suspected\nburglars packed in tinfoil and in a good state of preservation. These\nheads were not sent necessarily for publication, but as an evidence of\ngood faith on the part of the Department of Unimpeded Justice. Mind you,\nthere was no postponement of the preliminary examination, no dilatory\nmotions and changes of venue, no pleas to the jurisdiction of the court,\nno legal delays and final challenges of jurors until an idiotic jury had\nbeen procured who hadn’t read the papers, no ruling out of damaging\ntestimony, and finally filing of bill of exceptions, no appeal and delay,\nor appeal afterward to another court which returned the defendant to the\ncourt of original jurisdiction for review, and years of waiting for the\nprosecuting witnesses to die of old age and thus release the defendant.\nThere is nothing of that kind in China. You just hand in your orders to\nthe judicial end of the administration, and then you retire. Later on, the\ndelivery man brings in your package of heads, makes a salaam, and goes\naway.",
        "Now, this is swift and speedy justice for you. I don’t know how the guilt\nof the defendants is arrived at, but there’s nothing tedious about it. At\nleast, there’s nothing tedious to the complainant I presume they make it\nred-hot for the criminal.",
        "Still this style of justice has its drawbacks. For instance, you are at\ndinner. You have a large and select company dining with you. You are about\nto carve the roast There is a ring at the door. The servant announces that\na judicial officer is at the drawbridge and desires to speak with you. You\npull your napkin out of your bosom, lay the carving knife down on the\nvirgin table cloth, and go to the door. There the minister of justice\npresents you with a champagne basket and retires. You return to the dining\nhall, leaving your basket on the sideboard. After a while you announce to\nyour guests that you have just received a basket of Mumm’s extra dry with\nthe compliments of the government, and that you will, with the permission\nof those present, open a bottle. You arm yourself with a corkscrew, open\nthe basket, and thoughtlessly tip it over, when two or three human heads,\nwith a pained and grieved expression on the face, roll out on the table.",
        "When you are looking for a quart bottle of sparkling wine and find instead\nthe cold, sad features and reproachful stare of the extremely deceased and\nhic jacet Chinaman, you naturally betray your chagrin. I like to see\njustice moderately swift, and, in fact I’ve seen it pretty forthwith in\nits movements two or three times; but I cannot say that I would be\nprepared for this style.",
        "Perhaps I’m getting a little nervous in my old age, and a small matter\njars my equilibrium; but I’m sure a basket of heads handed in as I was\nseated at the table would startle me a little at first, and I might forget\nmyself.",
        "A friend of mine, under such circumstances, made what the English would\ncall “a doosed clevah” remark once in Shanghai. When he opened the basket\nhe was horrified, but he was cool. He was old sang froid from\nSangfroidville. He first took the basket and started for the back room,\nwith the remark: “My friends, I guess you will have to ex-queuese me.\"\nThen he pulled down his eyelids and laughed a hoarse English laugh.",

        "Some make one-third of the call before rising, and then complete the call\nwhile airing the house and holding the door open, while others consider\nthis low and vulgar, making at least one-fourth of the call in the hall,\nand one-half between the front door and the gate. Different authorities\ndiffer as to the proper time for calling. Some think you should not call\nbefore 3 or after 5 P.M., but if you have had any experience and had\nordinary sense to start with, you will know when to call as soon as you\nlook at your hand.",

There are two kinds of gloves, viz., hard gloves and soft\ngloves.",
        "I once fought with soft gloves to a finish with a young man who was far my\ninferior intellectually, but he exceeded me in brute force and knowledge\nof the use of the gloves. He was not so tall, but he was wider than\nmyself. Longitudinally he was my inferior, but latitudinally he\noutstripped me. We did not fight a regular prize-fight. It was just done\nfor pleasure. But I do not think we should abandon ourselves entirely to\npleasure. It is enervating, and makes one eye swell up and turn blue.",

        "Lecturer, New York City.–You need not worry so much about your costume\nuntil you have written your lecture, and it would be a good idea to test\nthe public a little, if possible, before you do much expensive printing.\nYour idea seems to be that a man should get a fine lithograph of himself\nand a $100 suit of clothes, and then write his lecture to fit the\nlithograph and the clothes. That is erroneous.",

I once lectured\non the subject of phrenology in the southern portion of Utah, being at\nthat time temporarily busted, but still hoping to tide over the dull times\nby delivering a lecture on the subject of “Brains, and how to detect their\npresence.” I was not supplied with a phrenological bust at that time, and\nas such a thing is almost indispensable, I borrowed a young man from\nProvost and induced him to act as bust for the evening. He did so with\nthrilling effect, taking the entire gross receipts of the lecture course\nfrom my coat pocket while I was illustrating the effect of alcoholic\nstimulants on the raw brain of an adult in a state of health.",

Of what use\nare logic and argument when we find the true inwardness of the bologna\nsausage on the outside?” were written by a philosopher who is still\nliving.

Some\ndealers are wearing their open accounts long this winter and some are not.\nDo as you think best about cleaning the dress. Benzine will sometimes\neradicate an oyster stew from dress goods. It will also eradicate everyone\nin the room at the same time. I have known a pair of rejuvenated kid\ngloves to break up a funeral that started out with every prospect of\nsuccess. Benzine is an economical thing to use, but socially it is not up\nto the standard. Another idea has occurred to me, however. Why not riprap\nthe skirt, calk the solvages, readjust the box plaits, cat stitch the\ncrown sheet, file down the gores, sandpaper the gaiters and discharge the\ndolman. You could then wear the garment anywhere in the evening, and half\nthe people wouldn’t know anything had happened to it.",

        "One three-cornered hoe, Gothic in its architecture and in good running\norder. It is the same one I erroneously hoed up the carnation with, and\nmay be found, I think, behind the barn, where I threw it when I discovered\nmy error. Original cost of hoe, six bits. Will be closed out now at two\nbits to make room for new goods.",
        "Also one garden rake, almost as good as new. One front tooth needs\nfilling, and then it will be as good as ever. I sell this weapon, not so\nmuch to get rid of it, but because I do not want it any more. I shall not\ngarden any next spring. I do not need to. I began it to benefit my health,\nand my health is now so healthy that I shall not require the open-air\nexercise incident to gardening any more. In fact, I am too robust, if\nanything. I will, therefore, acting upon the advice of my royal physician,\nclose this rake out, since the failure of the Northwestern Car Company, at\n50 cents on the dollar.",
        "Also one lawn-mower, only used once. At that time I cut down what grass I\nhad on my lawn, and three varieties of high-priced rose bushes. It is one\nof the most hardy open-air lawn-mowers now made. It will outlive any other\nlawn-mower, and be firm and unmoved when all the shrubbery has gone to\ndecay. You can also mow your peony bed with it, if you desire. I tried it.\nThis is also an easy running lawn-mower, I would recommend it to any man\nwho would like to soak his lawn with perspiration. I mowed my lawn, and\nthen pushed a street-car around in the afternoon to relax my over-strained\nmuscles. I will sacrifice this lawn-mower at three-quarters of its\noriginal cost, owing to depression in the stock of the New Jerusalem gold\nmine, of which I am a large owner and cashier-at-large.",
        "Will also sell a bright new spade, only used two hours spading for\nangle-worms. This is a good, early-blooming and very hardy angle-worm\nspade, built in the Doric style of architecture.

        "I will also part with a small chest of carpenter’s tools, only slightly\nused. I had intended to do a good deal of amateur carpenter work this\nsummer, but, as the presidential convention occurs in June, and I shall\nhave to attend to that, and as I have already sawed up a Queen Anne chair,\nand thoughtlessly sawed into my leg, I shall probably sacrifice the tools.\nThese tools are all well made, and I do not sell them to make money on\nthem, but because I have no use for them. I feel as though these tools\nwould be safer in the hands of a carpenter. I’m no carpenter. My wife\nadmitted that when I sawed a board across the piano-stool and sawed the\nwhat-do-you-call-it all out of the cushion.",

These\nentertainments had been proposed as a means of propping up the tottering\nfinances of the society, and procuring much-needed funds for the purpose\nof purchasing new regalia for the Most Esteemed Duke of the Dishrag and\nthe Most Esteemed Hired Man, each of whom had been wearing the same red\ncalico collar and cheese-cloth sash since the organization of the society.\nFunds were also necessary to pay for a brother who had walked through a\nrailroad trestle into the shoreless sea of eternity, and whose widow had a\npolicy of $135.25 against this society on the life of her husband.",
        "Various suggestions were made; among them was the idea advanced by the\nMost Highly Esteemed Inside Door-Slammer that, as the society’s object\nwas, of course, to obtain funds, would it not be well to consider, in the\nfirst place, whether it would not be as well for the Most Esteemed\nToolymuckahi to appoint six brethren in good standing to arm themselves\nwith great care, gird up their loins and muzzle the pay-car as it started\nout on its mission. He simply offered this as a suggestion, and, as it was\na direct method of securing the coin necessary, he would move that such a\ncommittee be appointed by the Chair to wait on the pay-car and draw on it\nat sight.",
        "The Most Esteemed Keeper of the Cork-screw seconded the motion, in order,\nas he said, to get it before the house. This brought forward very hot\ndiscussion, pending which the presiding officer could see very plainly\nthat the motion was unpopular.",
        "A visiting brother from Yellowstone Park Creamery No. 17, stated that in\ntheir society “an entertainment of this kind had been given for the\npurpose of pouring a flood of wealth into the coffers of the society, and\nit had been fairly successful. Among the attractions there had been\nnothing of an immoral or lawless nature whatever. In the first place, a\nkind of farewell oyster gorge had been given, with cove oysters as a\nbasis, and $2 a couple as an after-thought. A can of cove oysters\nentertained thirty people and made $30 for the society. Besides, it was\nfound after the party had broken up that, owing to the adhesive properties\nof the oysters, they were not eaten; but the juice, as it were, had been\nscooped up and the puckered and corrugated gizzards of the sea had been\npreserved. Acting upon this suggestion, the society had an oyster patty\ndebauch the following evening at $2 a couple. Forty suckers came and put\ntheir means into the common fund. We didn’t have enough oysters to quite\ngo around, so some of us cut a dozen out of an old boot leg, and the\nentertainment was a great success. We also had other little devices for\nmaking money, which worked admirably and yielded much profit to the\nsociety. Those present also said that they had never enjoyed themselves so\nmuch before. Many little games were played, which produced great merriment\nand considerable coin. I could name a dozen devices for your society, if\ndesired, by which money could be made for your treasury, without the risk\nor odium necessarily resulting from robbing the pay-car or a bank, and yet\nthe profit will be nearly as great in proportion to the work done.”",
        "Here the gavel of the Most Esteemed Toolymuckahi fell with a sickening\nthud, and the visiting brother was told that the time assigned to\ncommunications, new business and good of the order had expired, but that\nthe discussion would be taken up at the next session, in one week, at\nwhich time it was the purpose of the chair to hear and note all\nsuggestions relative to an entertainment to be given at a future date by\nthe society for the purpose of obtaining the evanescent scad and for the\nsuccessful flash of the reluctant boodle.",

        "Hudson, Wis., Nov. 13, 1886.",
        "Scott Marble, Esq.–Dear Sir: I have just received your favor of\nyesterday, in which you ask me to unite with you in the construction of a\nnew play.",
        "This idea has been suggested to me before, but not in such a way as to\ninaugurate the serious thought which your letter has stirred up in my\nseething mass of mind.",
        "I would like very much to unite with you in the erection of such a\ndramatic structure that people would cheerfully come to this country from\nEurope, and board with us for months in order to see this play every\nnight.",
        "You will surely agree with me that someone ought to write a play. Why it\nhas not been done long ago, I cannot understand. A well known comedian\ntold me a year ago that he hadn’t been able to look into a paper for\nsixteen months. He could not even read over the proof of his own press\nnotices and criticisms, to ascertain whether the printer had set them up\nas he wrote them or not, simply because it took all his spare time off the\nstage to examine the manuscripts of plays that had been submitted to him.",
        "But I think we could arrange it so that we might together construct\nsomething in that line which would at least attract the attention of our\nfamilies.",
        "Would you mind telling me, for instance, how you write a play? You have\nbeen in the business before, and you could tell me, of course, some of the\nsalient points about it. Do you write it with a typewriter, or do you\ndictate your thoughts to someone who does not resent being dictated to?",
        "Do you write a play and then dramatize it, or do you write the drama and\nthen play on it? Would it not be a very good idea to secure a plot that\nwould cost very little, and then put the kibosh on it, or would you put up\nthe lines first, and then hang the plot or drama, or whatever it is, on\nthe lines? Is it absolutely necessary to have a prologue? If so, what is a\nprologue? Is it like a catalogue?",
        "I have a great many crude ideas, but you see I am not practical. One of my\ncrude ideas is to introduce into the play an artist’s studio. This would\nnot cost much, for we could borrow the studio evenings and allow the\nartist to use it daytimes. Then we would introduce into the studio scene\nthe artist’s living model. Everybody would be horrified, but they would\ngo. They would walk over each other to attend the drama, and we would do\nwell. Our living model in the studio act would be made of common wax, and\nif it worked well, we would discharge other members of the company and\nsubstitute wax. Gradually we could get it down to where the company would\nbe wax, with the exception of a janitor with a feather duster. Think that\nover.",
        "But seriously, a play, it seems to me, should embody an idea. Am I correct\nin that theory or not? It ought to convey some great thought, some maxim\nor aphorism, or some such a thing as that. How would it do to arrange a\nplay with the idea of impressing upon the audience that “the fool and his\nmoney are soon parted?” Are you using a hero and a heroine in your plays\nnow? If so, would you mind writing their lines for them, while I arrange\nthe details and remarks for the young man who is discovered asleep on a\ndivan when the curtain rises, and who sleeps on through the play with his\nmouth slightly ajar till the close–the close of the play, not the close\nof his mouth–when it is discovered that he is dead. He then plays the\ncold remains in the closing tableau, and fills a new-made grave at $9 per\nweek.",
        "I could also write the lines, I think, for the young man who comes in\nwearing a light summer cane and a seersucker coat so tight that you can\ncount his vertebrae. I could write what he would say without great mental\nstrain, I think. I must avoid mental strain or my intellect might split\ndown the back and I would be a mental wreck, good for nothing but to strew\nthe shores of time with myself.",
        "Various other crude ideas present themselves to my mind, but they need to\nbe clothed. You will say that this is unnecessary. I know you will at once\nreply that, for the stage, the less you clothe an idea the more popular it\nwill be, but I could not consent to have even a bare thought of mine make\nan appearance night after night before a cultivated audience.",
        "What do you think of introducing a genuine case of small-pox on the stage?\nYou say in your letter that what the American people clamor for is\nsomething “catchy.” That would be catchy, and it would also introduce\nitself.",
        "I wish you would also tell me what kind of diet you confine yourself to\nwhile writing a play, and how you go to work to procure it. Do you live on\na mixed diet, or on your relatives? Would you soak your head while writing\na play, or would you soak your overcoat? I desire to know all these\nthings, because, Mr. Marble, to tell you the truth, I am as ignorant about\nthis matter as the babe unborn. In fact, posterity would have to get up\nearly in the morning to know less about play-writing than I have succeeded\nin knowing.",
        "If we are to make a kind of comedy, my idea would be to introduce\nsomething facetious in the middle of the comedy. No one will expect it,\nyou see, and it will tickle the audience almost to death.",
        "A friend of mine suggests that it would be a great hit to introduce, or\nrather to reproduce, the Hell Gate explosion. Many were not able to be\nthere at the time, and would willingly go a long distance to witness the\nreproduction.",

        "It would seem at this time, while so little is being said on the currency\nquestion, and especially by the men who really control the currency, that\na word from me would not be out of place. Too much talking has been done\nby those only who have a theoretical knowledge of money and its eccentric\nhabits. People with a mere smattering of knowledge regarding national\ncurrency have been loquacious, while those who have made the matter a\nstudy, have been kept in the background.",

        "I met a man the other day, who, two years ago, was running a small paper\nat Larrabie’s Slough. He was then in his meridian as a journalist, and his\npaper was frequently quoted by such widely-read publications as the\nKnight of Labor at Work, a humorous semi-monthly journal. He boldly\nassailed the silver dollar, and with his trenchant pen he wrote such\nburning words of denunciation that the printer had to set them on ice\nbefore he could use the copy.",
        "Last week I met him on a Milwaukee & St. Paul train. He was very thin in\nflesh, and the fire of defiance was no longer in his eye. I asked him how\nhe came on with the paper at Larrabie’s Slough. He said it was no more.",

        "“Friends came in very kindly and told me what to attack. They would\nneglect their own business in order to tell me of corruption in somebody\nelse. I went on that way for some time in a defiant mood, attacking\nanything that happened to suggest itself.",

        "“In six months I took an unexpired annual pass over our Larrabie Slough\nNarrow-Gauge, or Orphan Road, and with nothing else but the clothes I\nwore, I told the plaintiff how to jerk the old Washington press and went\naway. The dear old Washington press that had more than once squatted my\nburning words into the pure white page. The dear old towel on which I had\nwiped my soiled hands for years, until it had almost become a part of\nmyself, the dark blue Gordon press with its large fly wheel and\nintermittent chattel mortgage, a press, to which I had contributed the\nfirst joint of my front finger; the editor’s chair; the samples of large\nbusiness cards printed in green with an inflamed red border, which showed\nthat we could do colored work at Larrabie’s Slough just as well as they\ncould in the large cities; the files of our paper; the large wilted potato\nthat Mr. Alonzo G. Pinkham of Erin Corners kindly laid on our table-all,\nall had to go.",
        "“I fled out into the great, hollow, mocking world of people who had\nrequested me to aggress. They were people who had called my attention to\nvarious things which I ought to attack. I had attacked those things. I had\nalso attacked the Larrabie Slough Narrow-Gauge Railroad, but the manager\ndid not see the attack, and so my pass was good.",

        "After all, however, this matter has always been, and still is, treated\nwith too much levity. It seems funny to us, at a distance of 1,600 miles,\nthat a thick-necked patriarch in the valley of the Jordan should be sealed\nto thirteen or fourteen low-browed, half human females, and that the whole\nmass of humanity should live and multiply under one roof.",

With\nthe wonderful music of the great organ at the tabernacle sounding in your\nears, and the lofty temple near by towering to the sky, you say to\nyourself, there is, after all, something solemn and impressive in all\nthis; but when a greasy apostle in an alapaca duster, takes his place\nbehind the elevated desk, and with bad grammar and slangy sentences, asks\nGod in a businesslike way to bless this buzzing mass of unclean,\nlow-browed, barbarous scum of all foreign countries, and the white trash\nand criminals of our own, you find no reverence, and no religious awe.",

        "I need not elaborate upon the wonderful growth of the press in our\ncountry, or refer to the great power which journalism wields in the\ndevelopment of the new world.

        "Of course, this is but the opinion of one man, but who has a better\nopportunity to judge than he who sits with his finger on the electric\npulse of the world, judging the actions of humanity at so much per judge,\ninvariably in advance?",
        "I need not tell you all this, for you certainly know it if you read your\npaper, and I hope you do. A man ought to read his own paper, even if he\ncannot endorse all its sentiments.",
        "So necessary has the profession of journalism become to the progress and\neducation of our country, that the matter of establishing schools where\nyoung men may be fitted for an active newspaper life, has attracted much\nattention and discussion. It has been demonstrated that our colleges do\nnot fit a young man to walk at once into the active management of a paper.\nHe should at least know the difference between a vile contemporary and a\nGothic scoop.",
        "It is difficult to map out a proper course for the student in a school of\njournalism, there are so many things connected with the profession which\nthe editor and his staff should know and know hard. The newspaper of\nto-day is a library. It is an encyclopaedia, a poem, a biography, a\nhistory, a prophecy, a directory, a time-table, a romance, a cook book, a\nguide, a horoscope, an art critic, a political resume, a multum in\nparvo. It is a sermon, a song, a circus, an obituary, a picnic, a\nshipwreck, a symphony in solid brevier, a medley of life and death, a\ngrand aggregation of man’s glory and his shame. It is, in short, a\nbird’s-eye-view of all the magnanimity and meanness, the joys and griefs,\nthe births and deaths, the pride and poverty of the world, and all for two\ncents–sometimes.",
        "I could tell you some more things that the newspaper of to-day is, if you\nhad time to stay here and your business would not suffer in your absence.\nAmong others it is a long felt want, a nine-column paper in a five-column\ntown, a lying sheet, a feeble effort, a financial problem, a tottering\nwreck, a political tool and a sheriff’s sale.",
        "If I were to suggest a curriculum for the young man who wished to take a\nregular course in a school of journalism, preferring that to the actual\nexperience, I would say to him, devote the first two years to meditation\nand prayer. This will prepare the young editor for the surprise and\nconsequent temptation to profanity which in a few years he may experience\nwhen he finds that the name of the Deity in his double-leaded editorial is\nspelled with a little “g,” and the peroration of the article is locked up\nbetween a death notice and the advertisement of a patent moustache coaxer,\nwhich is to follow pure reading matter every day in the week and occupy\nthe top of column on Sunday tf.",
        "The ensuing five years should be devoted to the peculiar orthography of\nthe English language.",
        "Then put in three years with the dumb bells, sand bags, slung shots and\ntomahawk. In my own journalistic experience I have found more cause for\nregret over my neglect of this branch than anything else. I usually keep\non my desk during a heated campaign, a large paper weight, weighing three\nor four pounds, and in several instances I have found that I could feed\nthat to a constant reader of my valuable paper instead of a retraction.",
        "Fewer people lick the editor though, now, than did so in years gone by.\nMany people–in the last two years–have gone across the street to lick\nthe editor and never returned. They intended to come right back in a few\nmoments, but they are now in a land where a change of heart and a palm\nleaf fan is all they need.",
        "Fewer people are robbing the editor now-a-days, too, I notice with much\npleasure. Only a short time ago I noticed that a burglar succeeded in\nbreaking into the residence of a Dakota journalist, and after a long, hard\nstruggle the editor succeeded in robbing him.",
        "After the primary course, mapped out already, an intermediate course of\nten years should be given to learning the typographical art, so that when\nvisitors come in and ask the editor all about the office, he can tell them\nof the mysteries of making a paper, and how delinquent subscribers have\nfrequently been killed by a well-directed blow with a printer’s towel.",
        "Five years should be devoted to a study of the art of proof-reading. In\nthat length of time the young journalist can perfect himself to such a\ndegree that it will take another five years for the printer to understand\nhis corrections and marginal notes.",
        "Fifteen years should then be devoted to the study of American politics,\nespecially civil service reform, looking at it from a non-partisan\nstandpoint. If possible, the last five years should be spent abroad.\nLondon is the place to go if you wish to get a clear, concise view of\nAmerican politics, and Chicago or Milwaukee would be a good place for the\nyoung English journalist to go and study the political outlook of England.",
        "The student should then take a medical and surgical course, so that he\nmay be able to attend to contusions, fractures and so forth, which may\noccur to himself or to the party who may come to his office for a\nretraction and by mistake get his spinal column double-leaded.",
        "Ten years should then be given to the study of law. No thorough,\nmetropolitan editor wants to enter upon the duties of his profession\nwithout knowing the difference between a writ of mandamus and other\nstyles of profanity. He should thoroughly understand the entire system of\nAmerican jurisprudence, so that in case a certiorari should break out in\nhis neighborhood he would know just what to do for it.",
        "The student will, by this time, begin to see what is required of him and\nenter with great zeal upon the further study of his profession.",
        "He will now enter upon a theological course of ten years and fit himself\nthoroughly to speak intelligently of the various creeds and religions of\nthe world. Ignorance or the part of an editor is almost a crime, and when\nhe closes a powerful editorial with the familiar quotation, “It is the\nearly bird that catches the worm,” and attributes it to St. Paul instead\nof Deuteronomy, it makes me blush for the profession.",
        "The last ten years may be profitably devoted to the acquisition of a\npractical knowledge of cutting cordwood, baking beans, making shirts,\nlecturing, turning double handsprings, being shot out of a catapult at a\ncircus, learning how to make a good adhesive paste that will not sour in\nhot weather, grinding scissors, punctuating, capitalization, condemnation,\nsyntax, plain sewing, music and dancing, sculpting, etiquette, prosody, how\nto win the affections of the opposite sex and evade a malignant case of\nbreach of promise, the ten commandments, every man his own tooter on the\nflute, croquet, rules of the prize ring, rhetoric, parlor magic,\ncalisthenics, penmanship, how to run a jack from the bottom of the pack\nwithout getting shot, civil engineering, decorative art, kalsomining,\nbicycling, base ball, hydraulics, botany, poker, international law,\nhigh-low-jack, drawing and painting, faro, vocal music, driving, breaking\nteam, fifteen ball pool, how to remove grease spots from last year’s\npantaloons, horsemanship, coupling freight cars, riding on a rail, riding\non a pass, feeding threshing machines, how to wean a calf from the parent\nstem, teaching school, bull-whacking, plastering, waltzing, vaccination,\nautopsy, how to win the affections of your wife’s mother, every man his\nown washerwoman, or how to wash underclothes so they will not shrink,\netc., etc.",
        "But time forbids anything like a thorough list of what a young man should\nstudy in order to fully understand all that he may be called upon to\nexpress an opinion about in his actual experience as a journalist. There\nare a thousand little matters which every editor should know; such, for\ninstance, as the construction of roller composition. Many newspaper men\ncan write a good editorial on Asiatic cholera, but their roller\ncomposition is not fit to eat.",
        "With the course of study that I have mapped out, the young student would\nemerge from the college of journalism at the age of 95 or 96, ready to\ntake off his coat and write an article on almost any subject. He would be\na little giddy at first, and the office boy would have to see that he went\nto bed at a proper time each night, but aside from that, he would be a\ngood man to feed a waste paper basket.",
        "Actual experience is the best teacher in this peculiarly trying\nprofession. I hope some day to attend a press convention where the order\nof exercise will consist of five-minute experiences from each one present\nIt would be worth listening to.",
        "My own experience was a little peculiar. It was my intention at first to\npractice law, when I went to the Rocky Mountains, although I had been\nwarned by the authorities not to do so. Still, I did practice in a\nsurreptitious kind of a way, and might have been practicing yet if my\nclient hadn’t died. When you have become attached to a client and respect\nand like him, and then when, without warning, like a bolt of electricity\nfrom a clear sky, he suddenly dies and takes the bread right out of your\nmouth, it is rough.",
        "Then I tried the practice of criminal law, but my client got into the\npenitentiary, where he was no use to me financially or politically.\nFinally, when the judge was in a hurry, he would appoint me to defend the\npauper criminals. They all went to the penitentiary, until people got to\ncriticising the judge, and finally they told him that it was a shame to\nappoint me to defend an innocent man.",
        "My first experience in journalism was in a Western town, in which I was a\ntotal stranger. I went there with thirty-five cents, but I had it\nconcealed in the lining of my clothes so that no one would have suspected\nit if they had met me. I had no friends, and I noticed that when I got off\nthe train the band was not there to meet me. I entered the town just as\nany other American citizen would. I had not fully decided whether to\nbecome a stage robber or a lecturer on phrenology. At that time I got a\nchance to work on a morning paper. It used to go to press before dark, so\nI always had my evenings to myself and I liked that part of it first-rate.\nI worked on that paper a year and might have continued if the proprietors\nhad not changed it to an evening paper.",
        "Then a company incorporated itself and started a paper, of which I took\ncharge. The paper was published in the loft of a livery stable. That is\nthe reason they called it a stock company. You could come up the stairs\ninto the office or you could twist the tail of the iron-gray mule and take\nthe elevator.",
        "It wasn’t much of a paper, but it cost $16,000 a year to run it, and it\ncame out six days in the week, no matter what the weather was. We took the\nAssociated Press news by telegraph part of the time and part of the time\nwe relied on the Cheyenne morning papers, which we got of the conductor on\nthe early morning freight. We got a great many special telegrams from\nWashington in that way, and when the freight train got in late, I had to\nguess at what congress was doing and fix up a column of telegraph the best\nI could. There was a rival evening paper there, and sometimes it would\nsend a smart boy down to the train and get hold of our special telegrams,\nand sometimes the conductor would go away on a picnic and take our\nCheyenne paper with him.",
        "All these things are annoying to a man who is trying to supply a long felt\nwant. There was one conductor, in particular, who used to go away into the\nfoot-hills shooting sage hens and take our cablegrams with him. This threw\ntoo much strain on me. I could guess at what congress was doing and make\nup a pretty readable report, but foreign powers and reichstags and crowned\nheads and dynasties always mixed me up. You can look over what congress\ndid last year and give a pretty good guess at what it will do this year,\nbut you can’t rely on a dynasty or an effete monarchy in a bad state of\npreservation. It may go into executive session or it may go into\nbankruptcy.",
        "Still, at one time we used to have considerable local news to fill up\nwith. The north and middle parks for a while used to help us out when the\nmining camps were new. Those were the days when it was considered\nperfectly proper to kill off the board of supervisors if their action was\ndistasteful. At that time a new camp generally located a cemetery and\nwrote an obituary; then the boys would start out to find a man whose name\nwould rhyme with the rest of the verse. Those were the days when the\ncemeteries of Colorado were still in their infancy and the song of the\nsix-shooter was heard in the land.",
        "Sometimes the Indians would send us in an item. It was generally in the\nobituary line. With the Sioux on the north and the peaceful Utes on the\nsouth, we were pretty sure of some kind of news during the summer. The\nparks used to be occupied by white men winters and Indians summers. Summer\nwas really the pleasantest time to go into the parks, but the Indians had\nbeen in the habit of going there at that season, and they were so clannish\nthat the white men couldn’t have much fun with them, so they decided they\nwould not go there in the summer. Several of our best subscribers were\nkilled by the peaceful Utes.",
        "There were two daily and three weekly papers published in Laramie City av\nthat time. There were between two and three thousand people and our local\ncirculation ran from 150 to 250, counting dead-heads. In our prospectus we\nstated that we would spare no expense whatever in ransacking the universe\nfor fresh news, but there were times when it was all we could do to get\nour paper out on time. Out of the express office, I mean.",
        "One of the rival editors used to write his editorials for the paper in the\nevening, jerk the Washington hand-press to work them off, go home and\nwrestle with juvenile colic in his family until daylight and then deliver\nhis papers on the street. It is not surprising that the great mental\nstrain incident to this life made an old man of him, and gave a tinge of\nextreme sadness to the funny column of his paper.",
        "In an unguarded moment, this man wrote an editorial once that got all his\nsubscribers mad at him, and the same afternoon he came around and wanted\nto sell his paper to us for $10,000. I told him that the whole outfit\nwasn’t worth ten thousand cents.",
        "“I know that,” said he, “but it is not the material that I am talking\nabout. It is the good will of the paper.”",
        "We had a rising young horsethief in Wyoming in those days, who got into\njail by some freak of justice, and it was so odd for a horsethief to get\ninto jail that I alluded to it editorially. This horsethief had\ndistinguished himself from the common, vulgar horsethieves of his time, by\nwearing a large mouth–a kind of full-dress, eight-day mouth. He rarely\nsmiled, but when he did, he had to hold the top of his head on with both\nhands. I remember that I spoke of this in the paper, forgetting that he\nmight criticise me when he got out of jail. When he did get out again, he\nstated that he would shoot me on sight, but friends advised me not to have\nhis blood on my hands, and I took their advice, so I haven’t got a\nparticle of his blood on either of my hands.",
        "For two or three months I didn’t know but he would drop into the office\nany minute and criticise me, but one day a friend told me that he had been\nhung in Montana. Then I began to mingle in society again, and didn’t have\nto get in my coal with a double barrel shot gun any more.",
        "After that I was always conservative in relation to horsethieves until we\ngot the report of the vigilance committee.",
        "Wrestling with the Mazy.",
        "Very soon now I shall be strong enough on my cyclone leg to resume my\nlessons in waltzing. It is needless to say that I look forward with great\npleasure to that moment. Nature intended that I should glide in the mazy.\nTall, lithe, bald-headed, genial, limber in the extreme, suave, soulful,\nfrolicsome at times, yet dignified and reserved toward strangers, light on\nthe foot–on my own foot, I mean–gentle as a woman at times, yet\nirresistible as a tornado when insulted by a smaller, I am peculiarly\nfitted to shine in society. Those who have observed my polished brow, when\nunder a strong electric light, say they never saw a man shine so in\nsociety as I do.",
        "My wife taught me how to waltz. She would teach me on Saturdays and repair\nher skirts during the following week. I told her once that I thought I was\ntoo brainy to dance. She said she hadn’t noticed that, but she thought I\nseemed to run too much to legs. My wife is not timid about telling me\nanything that she thinks will be for my good. When I make a mistake she is\nperfectly frank with me, and comes right to me and tells me about it, so\nthat I won’t do so again.",
        "I had just learned how to reel around a ballroom to a little waltz music,\nwhen I was blown across the State of Mississippi in September last by a\nhigh wind, and broke one of my legs which I use in waltzing. When this\naccident occurred I had just got where I felt at liberty to choose a\nglorious being with starry eyes and fluffy hair, and magnificently modeled\nform, to steer me around the rink to the dreamy music of Strauss. One\nyoung lady, with whom I had waltzed a good deal, when she heard that my\nleg was broken, began to attend every dancing party she could hear of,\nalthough she had declined a great many previous to that. I asked her how\nshe could be so giddy and so gay when I was suffering. She said she was\ndoing it to drown her sorrow, but her little brother told me on the quiet\nthat she was dancing while I was sick because she felt perfectly safe. A\nfriend of mine says I have a pronounced and distinctly original manner of\nwaltzing, and that he never saw anybody, with one exception, who waltzed\nas I did, and that was Jumbo. He claimed that either one of us would be a\ngood dancer if he could have the whole ring to himself. He said that he\nwould like to see Jumbo and me waltz together if he were not afraid that I\nwould step on Jumbo and hurt him. You can see what a feeling of jealous\nhatred it arouses in some small minds when a man gets so that he can\nmingle in good society and enjoy himself.",
        "I could waltz more easily if the rules did not require such a constant\nchange of position. I am sedentary in my nature, slow to move about, so\nthat it takes a lady of great strength of purpose to pull me around on\ntime.",
        "Years ago, before Laramie City got a handsome opera house, everything in\nthe theatrical and musical line of a high order was put on the stage of\nBlackburn’s Hall. Other light dramas on the stage, and thrilling murders\nin the audience, used to occur at Alexander’s Theater, on Front street.\nHere you could get a glass of Laramie beer, made of glucose, alkali water,\nplug tobacco, and Paris green, by paying two bits at the bar, and, as a\nprize, you drew a ticket to the olio, specialties, and low gags of the\nstage. The idea of inebriating a man at the box office, so that he will\nendure such a sham, is certainly worthy of serious consideration. I have\nseen shows at Alexander’s, and also at McDaniel’s, in Cheyenne, however,\nwhere the bar should have provided an ounce of chloroform with each ticket\nin order to allay the suffering.",
        "Here you could sit down in the orchestra and take the chances of getting\nhit when the audience began to shoot at the pianist, or you could go up\ninto the boxes and have a quiet little conversation with the timid\nbeer-jerkers. The beer-jerker was never too proud to speak to the most\nhumble, and if she could sell a grub-staker for $5 a bottle of real Piper\nHeidsick, made in Cheyenne and warranted to remove the gastric coat, pants\nand vest from a man’s stomach in two minutes, she felt pleased and proud.",
        "A room-mate of mine, whose name I will not give, simply because he was and\nstill is the best fellow in the United States, came home from the\n\"theater” one night with his hair parted in the middle. He didn’t wear it\nthat way generally, so it occasioned talk in social circles. He still has\na natural parting of the hair about five inches long, that he acquired\nthat night. He said it was accidental so far as he was concerned, but\nunless the management could keep people from shooting the holders of\nreserved seats between the acts or any other vital spot, he would withdraw\nhis patronage. And he was right about it. I think that any court in the\nland would protect a man who had purchased a seat in good faith, and with\nhis hat on and both feet on the back of the seat in front of him, sits\nquietly in said seat, smoking a Colorado Maduro cigar and watching the\nplay.",
        "Several such accidents occurred at the said theater. Among them was a\nlittle tableau in which Joe Walker and Centennial Bob took the leading\nparts. Bob went to the penitentiary, and Joe went to his reward with one\nof his lungs in his coat pocket. There was a little difference between\nthem as to the regularity of a “draw” and “show down,” so Bob went home\nfrom the theater and loaded a double-barrel shot-gun with a lot of\nscrap-iron, and, after he had introduced the collection into Joe’s front\nbreadth, the latter’s system was so lacerated that it wouldn’t retain\nground feed.",
        "There were other little incidents like that which occurred in and around\nthe old theater, some growing out of the lost love of a beer-jerker, some\nfrom an injudicious investment in a bob-tail flush that never got ripe\nenough to pick, and some from the rarified mountain air, united with an\nepidemic known as mania rotguti.",
        "A funny incident of the stage occurred not long ago to a friend of mine,\nwho is traveling with a play in which a stage cow appears. He is using\nwhat is called a profile cow now, which works by machinery. Last winter\nthis cow ran down while in the middle of the stage, and forgot her lines.\nThe prompter gave the string a jerk in order to assist her. This broke the\ncow in two, and the fore-quarters walked off to the left into one\ndressing-room, while the behind-quarters and porter-house steak retired to\nthe outer dressing-room. The audience called for an encore; but the cow\nfelt as though she had made a kind of a bull of the part, and would not\nappear. Those who may be tempted to harshly criticise this last remark,\nare gently reminded that the intense heat of the past month is liable to\neffect anyone’s mind. Remember, gentle reader, that your own brain may\nsome day soften also, and then you will remember how harsh you were toward\nme.",
        "Prior to the profile cow, the company ran a wicker-work cow, that was\nhollow and admitted of two hired-men, who operated the beast at a moderate\nsalary. These men drilled a long time on what they called a heifer\ndance–a beautiful spectacular, and highly moral and instructive quadruped\nclog, sirloin shuffle, and cow gallop, to the music of a piano-forte. The\nrehearsals had been crowned with success, and when the cow came on the\nstage she got a bouquet, and made a bran mash on one of the ushers.",
        "She danced up and down the stage, perfectly self-possessed, and with that\nperfect grace and abandon which is so noticeable in the self-made cow.\nFinally she got through, the piano sounded a wild Wagnerian bang, and the\ncow danseuse ambled off. She was improperly steered, however, and ran her\nhead against a wing, where she stopped in full view of the audience. The\ntalent inside of the cow thought they had reached the dressing-room and\nran against the wall, so they felt perfectly free to converse with each\nother. The cow stood with her nose jammed up against the wing, wrapped in\nthought, Finally, from her thorax the audience heard a voice say:",
        "“Jim, you blamed galoot, that ain’t the step we took at rehearsal no\nmore’n nuthin’. If you’re going to improvise a new cow duet, I wish you\nwouldn’t take the fore-quarters by surprise next time.”",
        "It is not now known what the reply was, for just then the prompter came on\nthe stage, rudely twisted the tail of the cow, rousing her from her\nlethargy, and harshly kicking her in the pit of the stomach, he drove her\noff the stage, The audience loudly called for a repetition, but the cow\nrefused to come in.",
        "George III was born in England June 4, 1738, and ran for king in 1760. He\nwas a son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and held the office of king for\nsixty years. He was a natural born king and succeeded his grandfather,\nGeorge II. Look as you will a-down the long page of English history, and\nyou will not fail to notice the scarcity of self-made kings. How few of\nthem were poor boys and had to skin along for years with no money, no\ninfluential friends and no fun.",
        "Ah, little does the English king know of hard times and carrying two or\nthree barrels of water to a tired elephant in order that he may get into\nthe afternoon performance without money. When he gets tired of being\nprince, all he has to do is just to be king all day at good wages, and\nthen at night take off his high-priced crown, hang it up on the hat-rack,\nput on a soft hat and take in the town.",
        "George III quit being prince at the age of 22 years, and began to hold\ndown the English throne. He would reign along for a few years, taking it\nkind of quiet, and then all at once he would declare war and pick out some\npeople to go abroad and leave their skeletons on some foreign shore. That\nwas George’s favorite amusement. He got up the Spanish war in two years\nafter he clome the throne; then he had an American revolution, a French\nrevolution, an Irish rebellion and a Napoleonic war. He dearly loved\ncarnage, if it could be prepared on a foreign strand. George always wanted\nimported carnage, even if it came higher. It was in 1765, and early in\nGeorge’s reign, that the American stamp act passed the Legislature and the\nGoddess of Liberty began to kick over the dashboard.",
        "George was different from most English kings, morally. When he spit on his\nhand and grasped the sceptre, he took his scruples with him right onto the\nthrone. He was not talked about half so much as other kings before or\nsince his time. Nine o’clock most always found George in bed, with his\nsceptre under the window-sash, so that he could get plenty of fresh air.\nAs it got along toward 9 o’clock, he would call the hired girl, tell her\nto spread a linen lap-robe on the throne till morning, issue a royal ukase\ndirecting her to turn out the cat, and instructing the cook to set the\npancake batter behind the royal stove in the council chamber, then he\nwould wind the clock and retire. Early in the morning George would be up\nand dressed, have all his chores done and the throne dusted off ready for\nanother hard day’s reign.",
        "George III is the party referred to in the Declaration of Independence the\npresent king of Great Britain, and of whom many bitter personal remarks\nwere made by American patriots. On this side of the water George was not\nhighly esteemed. If he had come over here to spend the summer with friends\nin Boston, during the days of the stamp act excitement, he could have gone\nhome packed in ice, no doubt, and with a Swiss sunset under each eye.",
        "George’s mind was always a little on the bias, and in 1810 he went crazy\nfor the fifth time. Always before that he had gone right ahead with his\nreign, whether he was crazy or not, but with the fifth attack of insanity,\ncoupled with suggestion of the brain and blind staggers, it was decided to\ntie him up in the barn and let someone else reign awhile. The historian\nsays that blindness succeeded this attack, and in 1811 the Prince of Wales\nbecame regent.",
        "George III died at Windsor in 1820, with the consent of a joint committee\nof both houses of congress, at the age of 82 years. He made the longest\nrun as king, without stopping for feed or water, of any monarch in English\nhistory. Sixty years is a long time to be a monarch and look under the bed\nevery night for a Nihilist loaded with a cut-glass bomb and Paris green.\nSixty years is a long while to jerk a sceptre over a nation and keep on\nthe right side, politically, all the time.",
        "George was of an inventive turn of mind, and used to be monkeying with\nsome kind of a patent, evenings, after he had peeled his royal robes. Most\nof his patents related to land, however, and some of the most successful\nsoil in Massachusetts was patented by George.",
        "He was always trying some scheme to make a pile of money easy, so that he\nwouldn’t have to work; but he died poor and crazy at last, in England. He\nwas not very smart, but he attended to business all the time, and did not\nget up much of a reputation as a moral leper. He said that as king of\nGreat Britain and general superintendent of Cork he did not aim to make\nmuch noise, but he desired to attract universal attention by being so\nmoral that he would be regarded as eccentric by other crowned heads.",

        "Removing the seals from the jars as soon as I had returned from the\nexpress office, I poured off the alcohol and recklessly threw it away.\nA true scientist does not care for expense.",
        "The first specimen was in a good state of preservation on its arrival. I\nnever saw a more beautiful or robust proliferation epitherial cell nest in\nmy life. It must have been secured immediately after the old epitherial\nhad left the nest, and it was in good order on its arrival. The whole\nlobule was looking first-rate. You might ride for a week and not run\nacross a prettier lobule or a more artistic aggregation of cell nests\noutside a penitentiary.",
        "Only one cell nest had been allowed to dry up on the way, and this looked\na good deal fatigued. In one specimen I noticed a carneous degeneration,\nbut this is really no reflection on Mr. Flannery personally. While he has\nbeen ill it is not surprising that he should allow his cell nests to\ncarneously degenerate. Such a thing might happen to almost any of us.",
        "One of the scrapings from the sore on the right posterior fauces, I found\non its arrival, had been seriously injured, and therefore not available. I\nreturn it herewith.",
        "From an examination, which has been conducted with great care, I am led to\nbelieve that the right posterior rafter of Mr. Flannery’s mouth is\nslightly indurated, and it is barely possible that the northeast duplex\nand parotid gable end of the roof of his mouth may become involved.",
        "I wish you would ask Mr. Flannery’s immediate relatives, if you can do so\nwithout arousing alarm in the breast of the patient, if there has ever\nbeen a marked predisposition on the part of his ancestors to tubercular\ngumboil. I do not wish to be understood as giving this diagnosis as final\nat all, but from what I have already stated, taken together with other\nclinical and pathological data within my reach, and the fact that minute,\ntabulated gumboil bactinae were found floating through some of the cell\nnests, I have every reason to fear the worst. I would be glad to receive\nfrom you for microscopic examination a fragment of Mr. Flannery’s\nmalpighian layer, showing evidences of cell proliferation. I only suggest\nthis, of course, as practicable in case there should be a malpighian layer\nwhich Mr. Flannery is not using. Do not ask him to take a malpighian layer\noff her cell nest just to please me.",
        "From one microscopic examination I hardly feel justified in giving a\ndiagnosis, nor care to venture any suggestion as to treatment, but it\nmight be well to kalsomine the roof of Mr. Flannery’s mouth with\ngum-arabic, white lime and glue in equal parts.",
        "There has already been some extravatations and a marked multiformity. I\nalso noticed an inflamed and angry color to the stroma with trimmings of\nthe same. This might only indicate that Mr. Flannery had kept his mouth\nopen too much during the summer, and sunburned the roof of his mouth, were\nit not that I also discovered traces of gumboil microbes of the squamous\nvariety. This leads me to fear the worst for Mr. Flannery. However, if the\ngentlemanly, courteous and urbane members of the Academy of Science, of\nErin Prairie, to whom I am already largely indebted for past favors, will\nkindly forward to me, prepaid, another scraping from the mansard roof of\nMr. Flannery’s mouth next week, I will open another keg of hard words and\ntrace this gumboil theory to a successful termination, if I have to use up\nthe whole ceiling of the patient’s mouth.",

        "The past fifty years have done much for the newspaper and periodical\nreaders of the United States. That period has been fruitful of great\nadvancement and a great reduction in price, but these are not all. Fifty\nyears and less have classified information so that science and sense are\nconveniently found, and humor and nonsense have their proper sphere. All\nbranches are pretty full of lively and thoroughly competent writers, who\ntake hold of their own special work even as the thorough, quick-eyed\nmechanic takes hold of his line of labor and acquits himself in a\ncreditable manner. The various lines of journalism may appear to be\ncrowded, but they are not. There may be too much vagabond journalism, but\nthe road that is traveled by the legitimate laborer is not crowded. The\nclean, Caucasian journalist, as he climbs the hill, is not crowded very\nmuch. He can make out to elbow his way toward the front, if he tries very\nhard. There may be too much James Crow science, and too much editorial\nvandalism and gush, and too much of the journalism for revenue only. There\nmay be too much ringworm humor also, but there is still a demand for the\nscientific work of the true student. There is still a good market for\nhonest editorial opinion, reliable news and fearless and funny paragraph\nwork and character sketches, as the song and dance men would say.",

        "It was in those days when young Stewart was short-handed for a sheep\nherder, and had to take up with a sullen, hairy vagrant, called by the\nother boys “Esau.” Esau hadn’t been on the ranch a week before he made\ntrouble with the proprietor and got the red-hot blessing from Stewart he\ndeserved.",
        "Then Esau got madder and sulked away down the valley among the little sage\nbrush hummocks and white alkali waste land to nurse his wrath. When\nStewart drove into the corral at night, from town, Esau raised up from\nbehind an old sheep dip tank, and without a word except what may have\ngrowled around in his black heart, he raised a leveled Spencer and shot\nhis young employer dead.",
        "That was the tragedy of the week only. Others had occurred before and\nothers would probably occur again. It was getting too prevalent for\ncomfort. So, as soon as a quick cayuse and a boy could get down into\ntown, the news spread and the authorities began in the routine manner to\nset the old legal mill to running. Someone had to go down to “The Tivoli\"\nand find the prosecuting attorney, then a messenger had to go to “The\nAlhambra” for the justice of the peace. The prosecuting attorney was\n\"full” and the judge had just drawn one card to complete a straight flush,\nand had succeeded.",
        "In the meantime the Salvation Army was fully half way to Clugston’s ranch.\nThey had started out, as they said, “to see that Esau didn’t get away.\"\nThey were going out there to see that Esau was brought into town.",
        "What happened after they got there I only know from hearsay, for I was not\na member of the Salvation Army at that time. But I got it from one of\nthose present, that they found Esau down in the sage brush on the bottoms\nthat lie between the abrupt corner of Sheep Mountain and the Little\nLaramie River. They captured him, but he died soon after, as it was told\nme, from the effects of opium taken with suicidal intent. I remember\nseeing Esau the next morning and I thought there were signs of ropium, as\nthere was a purple streak around the neck of deceased, together with other\nexternal phenomena not peculiar to opium.",
        "But the great difficulty with the Salvation Army was that it didn’t want\nto bring Esau into town. A long, cold night ride with a person in Esau’s\ncondition was disagreeable. Twenty miles of lonely road with a deceased\nmurderer in the bottom of the wagon is depressing. Those of my readers who\nhave tried it will agree with me that it is not calculated to promote\nhilarity. So the Salvation Army stopped at Whatley’s ranch to get warm,\nhoping that someone would steal the remains and elope with them. They\nstayed some time and managed to “give away” the fact that there was a\nreward of $5,000 out for Esau, dead or alive. The Salvation Army even went\nso far as to betray a great deal of hilarity over the easy way it had\nnailed the reward, or would as soon as said remains were delivered up and\nidentified.",
        "Mr. Whatley thought that the Salvation Army was having a kind of walkaway,\nso he slipped out at the back door of the ranch, put Esau into his own\nwagon and drove away to town. Remember, this is the way it was told to me.",
        "Mr. Whatley hadn’t gone more than half a mile when he heard the wild and\ndisappointed yells of the Salvation Army. He put the buckskin on the backs\nof his horses without mercy, driven on by the enraged shouts and yells of\nhis infuriated pursuers. He reached town about midnight, and his pursuers\ndisappeared. But what was he to do with Esau?",
        "He drove around all over town, trying to find the official who signed for\nthe deceased. Mr. Whatley went from house to house like a vegetable man,\nseeking sadly for the party who would give him a $5,000 check for Esau.\nNothing could be more depressing than to wake up one man after another out\nof a sound sleep and invite him to come out to the buggy and identify the\nremains. One man went out and looked at him. He said he didn’t know how\nothers felt about it, but he allowed that anybody who would pay $5,000 for\nsuch a remains as Esau’s could not have very good taste.",
        "Gradually it crept through Mr. Whatley’s wool that the Salvation Army had\nbeen working him, so he left Esau at the engine house and went home. On\nhis ranch he nailed up a large board on which had been painted in antique\ncharacters with a paddle and tar the following stanzas:",

It is generally remarkable that the American Demosthenes, so far,\nhas dwelt in the tepee, and lived on the debris of the deer and the\nbuffalo. I mean to say that the school readers have impressed us with the\ngreat magnetism of the crude warrior who dwelt in the wilderness and ate\nhis game, feathers and all, while he studied the art of swaying the\naudience by his oratorical powers.",

At least, the Blue Juniata warriors of our\ntime, from Little Crow, Red Iron, Standing Buffalo, Hole-in-the-Day and\nSitting Bull, to Victoria, Colorow, Douglas, Persume, Captain Jack and\nShavano, seem to do better as lobbyists than they do as orators. They may\nbe keen, logical and shrewd, but they are not eloquent. In some minds,\nBlack Hawk will ever appear as the Patrick Henry of his people; but I\nprefer to honor his unknown, unhonored and unsung amanuensis.

I\nbegan conversing with him in my polyglot manner. I did not get a reply. I\nconversed with him some more in a desultory way, for I had heard that he\nwas a great orator in his tribe, and I wanted to get his views on national\naffairs. Still he was silent. He would not even answer me. I got hostile\nand used some badly damaged Spanish on him. Then I used some sprained and\ndislocated German on him, but he didn’t seem to wot whereof I spoke.",

        "There have been many reasons given, first and last, why women should not\nvote, but I desire to say, in the full light of a ripe experience, that\nsome of them are fallacious. I refer more particularly to the argument\nthat it will degrade women to go to the polls and vote like a little man.\nWhile I am not and have never been a howler for female suffrage, I must\nadmit that it is much more of a success than prohibition and speculative\nscience.",
        "My wife voted eight years with my full knowledge and consent, and to-day I\ncannot see but that she is as docile and as tractable as when she won my\ntrusting heart.",
        "Now those who know me best will admit that I am not a ladies’ man, and,\ntherefore, what I may say here is not said to secure favor and grateful\nsmiles. I am not attractive and I am not in politics. I believe that I am\nhomelier this winter than usual. There are reasons why I believe that what\nI may say on this subject will be sincere and not sensational or selfish.",
        "It has been urged that good women do not generally exercise the right of\nsuffrage, when they have the opportunity, and that only those whose social\nrecord has been tarnished a good deal go to the polls. This is not true.",
        "It is the truth that a good full vote always shows a list of the best\nwomen and the wives of the best men. A bright day makes a better showing\nof lady voters than a bad one, and the weather makes a more perceptible\ndifference in the female vote than the male, but when things are exciting\nand the battle is red-hot, and the tocsin of war sounds anon, the wife and\nmother puts on her armor and her sealskin sacque and knocks things\ncross-eyed.",
        "It is generally supposed that the female voter is a pantaloonatic, a half\nhorse, half alligator kind of woman, who looks like Dr. Mary Walker and\nhas the appearance of one who has risen hastily in the night at the alarm\nof fire and dressed herself partially in her own garments and partially in\nher husband’s. This is a popular error. In Wyoming, where female suffrage\nhas raged for years, you meet quiet, courteous and gallant gentlemen, and\nfair, quiet, sensible women at the polls, where there isn’t a loud or\nprofane word, and where it is an infinitely more proper place to send a\nyoung lady unescorted than to the postoffice in any city in the Union. You\ncan readily see why this is so. The men about the polls are always\ncandidates and their friends. That is the reason that neither party can\nafford to show the slightest rudeness toward a voter. The man who on\nWednesday would tell her to go and soak her head, perhaps, would stand\nbareheaded to let her pass on Tuesday. While she holds a smashed ballot\nshoved under the palm of her gray kid glove she may walk over the\ncandidate’s prostrate form with impunity and her overshoes if she chooses\nto.",
        "Weeks and months before election in Wyoming, the party with the longest\npurse subsidizes the most livery stables and carriages. Then, on the\neventful day, every conveyance available is decorated with a political\nplacard and driven by a polite young man who is instructed to improve the\ntime. Thus every woman in Wyoming has a chance to ride once a year, at\nleast. Lately, however, many prefer to walk to the polls, and they go in\npairs, trios and quartettes, voting their little sentiments and calmly\nreturning to their cookies and crazy quilts as though politics didn’t jar\ntheir mental poise a minute.",
        "It is possible, and even probable, that a man and his wife may disagree on\npolitics as they might on religion. The husband may believe in Andrew\nJackson and a relentless hell, while his wife may be a stalwart and rather\nliberal on the question of eternal punishment. If the husband manages his\nwife as he would a clothes-wringer, and turns her through life by a crank,\nhe will, no doubt, work her politically; but if she has her own ideas\nabout things, she will naturally act upon them, while the man who is\nhenpecked in other matters till he can’t see out of his eyes, will be\nhenpecked, no doubt, in the matter of national and local politics.",
        "These are a few facts about the actual workings of female suffrage, and I\ndo not tackle the great question of the ultimate results upon the\npolitical machinery if woman suffrage were to become general. I do not\npretend to say as to that. I know a great deal, but I do not know that.\nThere are millions of women, no doubt who are better qualified to vote,\nand yet cannot, than millions of alleged men who do vote; but no one can\ntell now what the ultimate effect of a change might be.",
        "So far as Wyoming is concerned, the Territory is prosperous and happy. I\nsee, also, that a murderer was hung by process of law there the other day.\nThat looks like the onward march of reform, whether female suffrage had\nanything to do with it or not. And they’re going to hang another in March\nif the weather is favorable and executive clemency remains dormant, as I\nthink it will.",
        "All these things look hopeful. We can’t tell what the Territory would have\nbeen without female suffrage, but when they begin to hang men by law\ninstead of by moonlight, the future begins to brighten up. When you have\nto get up in the night to hang a man every little while and don’t get any\nper diem for it, you feel as though you were a good way from home.",
        "Though generally cheerful and content with her lot, the hen at times\nbecomes moody, sullen and taciturn. We are often called upon to notice and\nprofit by the genial and sunny disposition of the hen, and yet there are\ntimes in her life when she is morose, cynical, and the prey of consuming\nmelancholy. At such times not only her own companions, but man himself\nshuns the hen.",
        "At first she seems to be preoccupied only. She starts and turns pale when\nsuddenly spoken to. Then she leaves her companions and seems to be the\nvictim of hypochondria. Then her mind wanders. At last you come upon her\nsuddenly some day, seated under the currant bushes. You sympathize with\nher and you seek to fondle her. She then picks a small memento out of the\nback of your hand. You then gently but firmly coax her out of there with a\nhoe, and you find that she has been seated for some time on an old croquet\nball, trying to hatch out a whole set of croquet balls. This shows that\nher mind is affected. You pick up the croquet ball, and find it hot and\nfeverish, so you throw it into the shade of the woodshed. Anon, you find\nyour demented hen in the loft of the barn hovering over a door knob and\ntrying by patience and industry to hatch out a hotel.",
        "When a hen imagines that she is inspired to incubate, she at once ceases\nto be an ornament to society and becomes a crank. She violates all the\nlaws and customs of nature and society in trying to hatch a conservatory\nby setting through the long days and nights of summer on a small flower\npot.",
        "Man may win the affections of the tiger, the lion, or the huge elephant,\nand make them subservient to his wishes, but the setting hen is not\nsusceptible to affection. You might as well love the Manitoba blizzard or\ntry to quell the cyclone by looking calmly in its eye. The setting hen is\nfilled with hatred for every living thing. She loves to brood over her\nwrongs or anything else she can find to squat on.",
        "I once owned a hen that made a specialty of setting. She never ceased to\nbe the proud anonymous author of a new, warm egg, but she yearned to be a\nparent. She therefore seated herself on a nest where other hens were in\nthe habit of leaving their handiwork for inspection. She remained there\nduring the summer hatching steadily on while the others laid, until she\nfilled my barnyard with little orphaned henlets of different ages. She\nremained there night and day, patiently turning out poultry for me to be a\nfather to. I brought up on the bottle about one hundred that summer that\nhad been turned out by this morbidly maternal hen. All she seemed to ask\nin return was my kind regards and esteem. I fed her upon the nest and\nhumored her in every way. Every day she became a parent, and every day\nadded to my responsibility.",
        "One day I noticed that she seemed weak and there was a far away look in\nher eye. For the first time the horrible truth burst upon my mind. I\nburied my face in the haymow and I am not ashamed to say that I wept.\nStrong man as I am, I am not too proud to say that I soaked that haymow\nthrough with unavailing tears.",
        "My hen was dying even then. Her breath came hot and quick like the swift\nrush of a hot ball that caves in the short-stop and speeds away to\ncenter-field.",
        "The next morning one hundred chickens of various sizes were motherless,\nand if anything had happened to me they would have been fatherless.",
        "For many years I have made a close study of the setting hen, but I am\nstill unsettled as to what is best to do with her. She is a freak of\nnature, a disagreeable anomaly, a fussy phenomenon. Logic, rhetoric and\nmetaphor are all alike to the setting hen. You might as well go down into\nthe bosom of Vesuvius and ask it to postpone the next eruption.",
        "The recent prominence of Mr. John E. Dempsey, better known as Jack\nDempsey, of New York, brings to mind a four days’ trip taken in his\ncompany from Portland, Oregon, to St. Paul, over the Northern Pacific.",
        "There were three pugilists in the party besides myself, viz. Dempsey, Dave\nCampbell and Tom Cleary. We made a grand, triumphant tour across the\ncountry together, and I may truthfully state that I never felt so free to\nsay anything I wanted to–to other passengers–as I did at that time. I\nwish I could afford to take at least one pugilist with me all the time. In\ntraveling about the country lecturing, a good pugilist would be of great\nassistance. I would like to set him on the man who always asks: “Where do\nyou go to from here, Mr. Nye?” He does not ask because he wants to know,\nfor the next moment he asks right over again. I do not know why he asks,\nbut surely it is not for the purpose of finding out.",
        "Well, throughout our long journey across the State of Oregon and the\nTerritories of Idaho, Montana and Dakota, and the State of Minnesota, it\nwas one continual ovation. Dempsey had a world-wide reputation, I found,\nco-extensive with the horizon, as I may say, and bounded only by the\nzodiac.",
        "In my great forthcoming work, entitled “Half-Hours with Great Men, or\nEminent People Which I Have Saw,” I shall give a fuller description of\nthis journey. The book will be a great boon.",
        "Mr. Dempsey is not a man who would be picked out as a great man. You might\npass by him two or three times without recognizing his eminence, and yet,\nat a scrapping matinee or swatting recital, he seems to hold his audiences\nat his own sweet will–also his antagonist.",
        "Mr. Dempsey does not crave notoriety. He seems rather to court seclusion.\nThis is characteristic of the man. See how he walked around all over the\nState of New York last week–in the night, too–in order to evade the\ncrowd.",
        "His logic, however, is wonderful. Though quiet and unassuming in his\nmanner, his arguments are powerful and generally make a large protuberance\nwherever they alight.",
        "Nothing is more pleasing than the sight of a man who has risen by his own\nunaided effort, fought his way up, as it were, and yet who is not vain.\nMr. Dempsey conversed with me frequently during our journey, and did not\nseem to feel above me.",
        "I opened the conversation by telling him that I had seen a number of his\nworks. Nothing pleases a young author so much as a little friendly remark\nin relation to his work. I had seen a study of his one day in New York\nlast spring. It was an italic nose with quotation marks on each side.",
        "It was a very happy little bon mot on Mr. Dempsey’s part, and attracted a\ngood deal of notice at the time.",
        "Mr. Dempsey is not a college graduate, as many suppose. He is a self-made\nman. This should be a great encouragement to our boys who are now unknown,\nand whose portraits have not as yet appeared in the sporting papers.",
        "But Mr. Dempsey’s great force as a debater is less, perhaps, in the matter\nthan in the manner. His delivery is good and his gestures cannot fail to\nconvince the most skeptical. Striking in appearance, aggressive in his\nnature, and happy in his gestures, he is certain to attract the attention\nof the police, and he cannot fail to rivet the eye of his adversary. I saw\none of his adversaries, not long ago, whose eye had been successfully\nriveted in that way.",
        "And yet, John E. Dempsey was once a poor boy. He had none of the\nadvantages which wealth and position bring. But, confident of his latent\nability as a middle-weight convincer, he toiled on, ever on, sitting up\nuntil long after other people had gone to bed, patiently knocking out\nthose who might be brought to him for that purpose. He never hung back\nbecause the way looked long and lonely. And what is the result? To-day, in\nthe full vigor of manhood, he is sought out and petted by everyone who\ntakes an interest in the onward march of pugilism.",
        "It is a wonderful record, though brief. It shows what patient industry\nwill accomplish unaided. Had John E. Dempsey hesitated to enter the ring\nand said that he would rather go to school, where he would be safe, he\nmight to-day be an educated man; but what does that amount to here in\nAmerica, where everybody can have an education? He would have lost his\ntalent as a slugger, and drifted steadily downward, perhaps, till he\nbecame a school-teacher or a narrow-chested editor, writing things day\nafter day just to gratify the morbid curiosity of a sin-cursed world.",
        "In closing, I would like to say that I hope I have not expressed an\nopinion in the above that may hereafter be used against me. Do not\nunderstand me to be the foe of education. Education and refinement are\ngood enough in their places, but how shall we attract attention by trying\nto become refined and educated in a land where, as I say, education and\nrefinement seem almost to run rampant.",
        "Heretofore, in America, pugilism has been made subservient to the common\nschools. Pugilism and polygamy have both been crowded to the wall. Now\npugilism is about to assert itself. The tin ear and the gory nose will\nsoon come to the front, and the day is not far distant when progressive\npugilism and the prize-ring will take the place of the poorly ventilated\ncommon school and the enervating prayer meeting.",
        "There are about 5,000 Snake or Shoshone Indians now extant, the greater\npart being in Utah and Nevada, though there is a reservation in Idaho and\nanother in Wyoming.",
        "The Shoshone Indian is reluctant to accept of civilization on the European\nplan. He prefers the ruder customs which have been handed down from father\nto son along with other hairlooms. I use the word hairlooms in its\nbroadest sense.",
        "There are the Shoshones proper and the Utes or Utahs, to which have been\nadded by some authorities the Comanches, and Moquis of New Mexico and\nArizona, the Netelas and other tribes of California. The Shoshone,\nwherever found, is clothed in buckskin and blanket in winter, but dressed\nmore lightly in summer, wearing nothing but an air of intense gloom in\nAugust. To this he adds on holidays a necklace made from the store teeth\nof the hardy pioneer.",
        "The Snake or Shoshone Indian is passionately fond of the game known as\npoker among us, and which, I learn, is played with cards. It is a game of\nchance, though skill and a thorough knowledge of firearms are of great\nuse. The Indians enter into this game with great zeal, and lend to it the\nwonderful energy which they have preserved from year to year by abstaining\nfrom the debilitating effects of manual labor. All day long the red\nwarrior sits in his skin boudoir, nursing the sickly and reluctant\n\"flush,” patient, silent and hopeful. Through the cold of winter in the\ndesolate mountains, he continues to",
        "  “Hope on, hope ever,”",
        "that he will “draw to fill.” Far away up the canyon he hears the sturdy\nblows of his wife’s tomahawk as she slaughters the grease wood and the\nsage brush for the fire in his gilded hell where he sits and woos the lazy\nGoddess of Fortune.",
        "With the Shoshone, poker is not alone a relaxation, the game wherewith to\nwear out a long and listless evening, but it is a passion, a duty and a\ndevotion. He has a face designed especially for poker. It never shows a\nsign of good or evil fortune. You might as well try to win a smile from a\nrailroad right of way. The full hand, the fours, threes, pairs and\nbob-tail flushes are all the same to him, if you judge by his face.",
        "When he gets hungry he cinches himself a little tighter and continues to\n\"rastle” with fate. You look at his smoky, old copper cent of a face, and\nyou see no change. You watch him as he coins the last buckshot of his\ntribe and later on when he goes forth a pauper, and the corners of his\nfamine-breeding mouth have never moved, His little black, smoke-inflamed\neyes have never lighted with triumph or joy. He is the great aboriginal\nstoic and sylvan dude. He does not smile. He does not weep. It certainly\nmust be intensely pleasant to be a wild, free, lawless, irresponsible,\nnatural born fool.",
        "The Shoshones proper include the Bannocks, which are again subdivided into\nthe Koolsitakara or Buffalo Eaters, on Wind River, the Tookarika or\nMountain Sheep Eaters, on Salmon or Suabe Eivers, the Shoshocas or White\nKnives, sometimes called Diggers, of the Humbolt Eiver and the Great Salt\nLake basin. Probably the Hokandikahs, Yahooskins and the Wahlpapes are\nsubdivisions of the Digger tribe. I am ’not sure of this, but I shall not\nsuspend my business till I can find out about it. If I cannot get at a\ngreat truth right off I wait patiently and go right on drawing my salary.",
        "The Shoshones live on the government and other small game. They will eat\nanything when hungry, from a buffalo down to a woodtick. The Shoshone does\nnot despise small things. He loves insects in any form. He loves to make\npets of them and to study their habits in his home life.",
        "Formerly, when a great Shoshone warrior died, they killed his favorite\nwife over his grave, so that she could go to the happy hunting grounds\nwith him, but it is not so customary now. I tried to impress on an old\nShoshone brave once that they ought not to do that. I tried to show him\nthat it would encourage celibacy and destroy domestic ties in his tribe.\nSince then there has been quite a stride toward reform among them. Instead\nof killing the widow on the death of the husband, the husband takes such\ngood care of his health and avoids all kinds of intellectual strain or\nphysical fatigue, that late years there are no widows, but widowers just\nseem to swarm in the Shoshone tribe. The woods are full of them.",
        "Now, if they would only kill the widower over the grave of the wife, the\nIndian’s future would assume a more definite shape.",
        "I have once more tried to ride a pair of roller skates. That is the reason\nI got down on the rink and down on roller skates. That is the reason\nseveral people got down on me. That is also the reason why I now state in\na public manner, to a lost and undone race, that unless the roller-rink is\nat once abolished, the whole civilized race will at once be plunged into\narnica.",
        "I had tried it once before, but had not carried my experiments to a\nsuccessful termination. I made a trip around the rink last August, but was\nruled out by the judges for incompetency, and advised to skate among the\npeople who were hostile to the government of the United States, while the\nproprietors repaired the rink.",
        "On the 9th of June I nestled in the bosom of a cyclone to excess, and it\nhas required the bulk of the succeeding months for nature to glue the bone\nof my leg together in proper shape. That is the reason I have not given\nthe attention to roller-skating that I should.",
        "A few weeks ago I read what Mr. Talmage said about the great national\nvice. It was his opinion that, if we skated in a proper spirit, we could\nleave the rink each evening with our immortal souls in good shape.",
        "Somehow it got out that on Thursday evening I would undertake the feat of\nskating three rounds in three hours with no protection to my scruples, for\none-half the gate money, Talmage rules. So there was quite a large\naudience present with opera glasses. Some had umbrellas, especially on the\nfront rows. These were worn spread, in order to ward off fragments of the\nrink which might become disengaged and set in motion by atmospheric\ndisturbances.",
        "In obedience to a wild, Wagnerian snort from the orchestra, I came into\nthe arena with my skates in hand. I feel perfectly at home before an\naudience when I have my skates in hand. It is a morbid desire to wear the\nskates on my feet that has always been my bete noire. Will the office\nboy please give me a brass check for that word so that I can get it when I\ngo away?",
        "My first thought, after getting myself secured to the skates, was this:\n\"Am I in the proper frame of mind? Am I doing this in the right spirit? Am\nI about to skate in such a way as to lift the fog of unbelief which now\nenvelopes a sinful world, or shall I deepen the opaque night in which my\nrace is wrapped?”",
        "Just then that end of the rink erupted in a manner so forthwith and so\ntout ensemble that I had to push it back in place with my person. I\nnever saw anything done with less delay or less languor.",
        "The audience went wild with enthusiasm, and I responded to the encore by\nwriting my name in the air with my skates.",
        "This closed the first seance, and my trainer took me in the dressing-room\nto attend a consultation of physicians. After the rink carpenter had\njacked up the floor a little I went out again. I had no fears about my\nability to perform the mechanical part assigned me, but I was still\nworried over the question of whether it would or would not be of lasting\nbenefit to mankind.",
        "Those who have closely scrutinized my frame in repose have admitted that I\nam fearfully and wonderfully made. Students of the human frame say that\nthey never saw such a wealth of looseness and limberness lavished upon one\nperson. They claim that nature bestowed upon me the hinges and joints\nintended for a whole family, and therefore when I skate the air seems to\nbe perfectly lurid with limbs. I presume that this is true; though I have\nso little leisure while skating in which to observe the method itself, the\nplot or animus of the thing, as it were, that my opinion would be of\nlittle value to the scientist.",
        "I am led to believe that the roller skate is certainly a great civilizer\nand a wonderful leveler of mankind. If we so skate that when the summons\ncomes to seek our ward in the general hospital, where each shall heal his\nbusted cuticle within the walls where rinkists squirm, we go not like the\nmoral wreck, morally paralyzed, but like a hired man taking his medicine,\nand so forth–we may skate with perfect impunity, or anyone else to whom\nwe may be properly introduced by our cook.",
        "The system of building railroads into the wilderness, and then allowing\nthe wilderness to develop afterward, has knocked the essential joy out of\nthe life of the pioneer. At one time the hardy hewer of wood and drawer of\nwater gave his lifetime willingly that his son might ride in the\n\"varnished cars.” Now the Pullman palace car takes the New Yorker to the\nthreshold of the sea, or to the boundary line between the United States\nand the British possessions.",
        "It has driven out the long handled frying pan and the flapjack of twenty\nyears ago, and introduced the condensed milk and canned fruit of commerce.\nAlong the highways, where once the hopeful hundreds marched with long\nhandled shovel and pick and pan, cooking by the way thin salt pork and\nflapjacks and slumgullion, now the road is lined with empty beer bottles\nand peach cans that have outlived their usefulness. No landscape can be\npicturesque with an empty peach can in the foreground any more than a lion\nwould look grand in a red monogram horse blanket and false teeth.",
        "The modern camp is not the camp of the wilderness. It wears the\nhalf-civilized and shabby genteel garments of a sawed-off town. You know\nthat if you ride a day you will be where you can get the daily papers and\nread them under the electric light. That robs the old canyons of their\nsolemn isolation and peoples each gulch with the odor of codfish balls and\ncivilization. Civilization is not to blame for all this, and yet it seems\nsad.",
        "Civilization could not have done all this alone. It had to call to its aid\nthe infernal fruit can that now desolates the most obscure trail in the\nheart of the mountains.

        "An old timer said to me once: “I’ve about decided, Bill, that the West is\na matter of history.

Nuthin! I used to chase\nInjuns all day and eat raw salt pork at night, bekuz I dassent build a\nfire, and still I felt better than I do now with a wad of tin-can solder\nin my stummick and a homesick feeling in my weather-beaten breast.",

        "My dear Princess Beatrice–I received your kind invitation to come up to\nWhippingham on the 23d inst. and see you married, but I have not been able\nto get there. The weather has been so hot this month, that, to tell you\nthe truth, Beatrice, I haven’t been going anywhere to speak of. At first I\nthought I would go anyhow, and even went so far as to pick out a nice\ncorner bracket to take along for a wedding present. Not so much for its\nintrinsic value, of course, but so you would have something with my name\nto it on a card that you could show to those English dudes, and let them\nknow that you had influential friends, even in America. But when I thought\nwhat a long, hard trip it would be, and how I would probably mash that\nbracket on the cars before I got half way there, I gave it up.",
        "I am not personally acquainted with your inamorato, if that’s all right,\nnever having met him in our set; but I understand you have done well, and\nthat your husband is a rising young man of good family, and that he will\nnever allow you to put your hands into dishwater. I hope this is true and\nthat he does not drink. Rum has certainly paralyzed more dukes and such\nthings than war has. I attribute this to the fact that princes and dukes\nare generally more reckless about exposing themselves to the demon rum\nthan to the rude alarums and one thing another of war.",
        "If you keep a girl I hope you will get a good one who knows her business.\nA green girl in the house of a newly-married princess is a great source of\nannoyance. A friend of mine who got married last winter got a girl whose\nmind had been eaten by cut-worms and she had not discovered it. All the\nfaculty that had been spared her was that power of the mind which enabled\nher to charge $3 a week. She lubricated the buckwheat pancake griddle for\na week with soap grease and a dash of castor oil, and when she was\ndischarged she wept bitterly because capital with the iron heel ground the\npoor servant girl into the dust.",
        "Probably you will take a little tour after the wedding is over. They are\ndoing that way a good deal in Boston this season. I thought you would like\na pointer in the very lum-tumest thing to do, and so I write this. So long\nas you have the means to do this thing right, I think you ought to do so.\nYou may never be married again, princess, and now is the time to paint the\nBritish Isles red.",
        "You can also get more concessions from your husband now, while he is a\nlittle rattled, and temporarily knocked silly by the pomp and pageant of\nmarrying into your family, and if you work it right you can maintain this\nsupremacy for years. Treat him with a gentle firmness, and do not weep on\nhis bosom if you detect the aroma of beer and bologna sausage on his young\nbreath. Bologna and royalty do not seem to harmonize first-rate, but\nremember you can harass your husband if you choose, so that he will fall\nto even lower depths than bologna and Milwaukee beer.

        "I’d just as soon tell you, Beatrice, that this smile racket is not\noriginal with me. I read it in a paper. This paper went on to say that a\nyoung wife should always greet her husband with a smile on his return. I\nshowed the article to my wife and suggested that it was a good scheme, and\nhoped she would try it on me sometime. She said if I would like to change\noff awhile, and take my smile when I got home instead of taking it down\ntown, we would make the experiment. The trouble with the average woman of\nthe age in which we live, Beatrice, is that she is above her business. She\ntries to be superior to her husband, and in many instances she succeeds.\nThat is the bane of wedded life. Do not strive to be superior to your\nhusband, Beatrice. If you do, it is good-bye, John.",

        "Venice is the home of the Venetian, and also where the gondola has its\nnest and rears its young. It is also the headquarters for the paint known\nas Venetian red. They use it in painting the town on festive occasions.\nThis is the town where the Merchant of Venice used to do business, and the\nhome of Shylock, a broker, who sheared the Venetian lamb at the corner of\nthe Rialto and the Grand Canal. He is now no more. I couldn’t even find an\nold neighbor near the Rialto who remembered Shylock. From what I can learn\nof him, however, I am led to believe that he was pretty close in his\ndeals, and liked to catch a man in a tight place and then make him squirm.\nShylock, during the great panic in Venice, many years ago, it is said, had\na chattel mortgage on more lives than you could shake a stick at. He would\nloan a small amount to a merchant at three per cent, a month, and secure\nit on a pound of the merchant’s liver, or by a cut-throat mortgage on his\nrespiratory apparatus. Then, when the paper matured, he would go up to the\nhouse with a pair of scales and a pie knife and demand a foreclosure.",

        "The gondola is a long, slim hack without wheels and is worked around\nthrough the damp streets by a brunette man whose breath should be a sad\nframing to us all. He is called the gondolier. Sometimes he sings in a low\ntone of voice and in a foreign tongue. I do not know where I have met so\nmany foreigners as I have here in Europe, unless it was in New York, at\nthe polls. Wherever I go, I hear a foreign tongue. I do not know whether\nthese people talk in the Italian language just to show off or not. Perhaps\nthey prefer it. London is the only place I have visited where the Boston\ndialect is used. London was originally settled by adventurers from Boston.\nThe blood of some of the royal families of Massachusetts may be found in\nthe veins of London people.",

A painting by\nTitian, the Italian Prang, pleased me very much, but I couldn’t beat down\nthe price to where it would be any object for me to buy it. Besides, it\nwould be a nuisance to carry such a picture around with me all over the\nAlps, up the Rhine and through St. Lawrence county. I finally decided to\nleave it and secure something less awkward to carry and pay for.",
        "The Italians are quite proud of their smoky old paintings. I have often\nthought that if Venice would run less to art and more to soap, she would\nbe more apt to win my respect. Art is all right to a certain extent, but\nit can be run in the ground. It breaks my heart to know how lavish nature\nhas been with water here, and yet how the Venetians scorn to investigate\nits benefits. When a gondolier gets a drop of water on him, he swoons.\nThen he lies in a kind of coma till another gondolier comes along to\nbreathe in his face and revive him.",

I told him it\nwas and asked him to take a chair and spit on the stove a few times, and\nmake himself entirely at home.",

I then asked him why his wife had not signed it,\nas it seemed to be the homestead, and her name appeared in the instrument\nwith that of her husband, but her signature wasn’t at the foot, though his\nname was duly signed, witnessed and acknowledged.",
        "“Well,” said he, “there’s where the gazelle comes in.” He then took a bite\noff the corner of a plug of tobacco about as big as a railroad land grant,\nand laid two twenty dollar gold pieces on the desk near my arm. I took\nthem and tapped them together like the cashier of the Bank of England,\nand, disguising my annoyance over the little episode, told him to go on.",
        "“Well,” said the large man, fondling the wen which nestled lovingly in his\nfaded Titian hair, “my wife has conscientious scruples against signing\nthat deed.

I’m kind of ex-officio husband, as you might say.\nAfter we’d been married about a month a little incident occurred which\nmade a riffle, as you might say, in our domestic tide. I was division\nmaster on the U.P., and one night I got an order to go down towards\nSidney and look at a bridge. Of course I couldn’t get back till the next\nevening. So I sighed and switched off to the superintendent’s office,\nexpecting to go over on No. 4 and look at the bridge. At the office they\ntold me that I needn’t go till Tuesday, so I strolled up town and got home\nabout nine o’clock, went in with a latch key, just as a mutual friend went\nout through the bed-room window, taking a sash that I paid two dollars\nfor. I didn’t care for the sash, because he left a pair of pantaloons\nworth twelve dollars and some silver in the pockets, but I thought it was\nsuch odd taste for a man to wear a sash without his uniform.",

It takes a good deal of damp weather\nto float me out of my regular channel. She spent the night packing her\ntrousseau, and in the morning she went away. Now, I could get a divorce and\nsave all this trouble of getting her signature, but I’d rather not tell\nthis whole business in court, for the little woman seems to be trying to\ndo better, and if it wasn’t for her blamed old hyena of a mother, would\nget along tip-top. She’s living with her mother now and if a lawyer would\ngo to the girl and tell her how it is, and that I want to sell the\nproperty and want her signature, in place of getting a divorce, I believe\nshe’d sign. Would you mind trying it?”",
        "I said if I could get time I would go over and talk with her and see what\nshe said. So I did. I got along pretty well, too. I found the young woman\nat home, and told her the legal aspects of the case. She wouldn’t admit\nany of the charges, but after a long parley agreed to execute the deed and\nsave trouble. She came to my office an hour later, and signed the\ninstrument I got two witnesses to the signature and had just put the\nnotarial seal on it when the girl’s mother came in. She asked her daughter\nif she had signed the deed and was told that she had. She said nothing,\nbut smiled in a way that made my blood run cold. If a woman were to smile\non me that way every day, I should certainly commit some great crime.",
        "I was just congratulating myself on the success of the business, and was\nlooking at the two $20 gold pieces and trying to get acquainted with them,\nas it were, after the two women had gone away; when they returned with the\nhusband and son-in-law at the head of the procession. He looked pale and\ncareworn to me. He asked me in a low voice if I had a deed there, executed\nby his wife. I said yes. He then asked me if I would kindly destroy it. I\nsaid I would. I would make deeds and tear them up all day at $40 apiece. I\nsaid I liked the conveyancing business very much, and if a client felt\nlike having a grand, warranty deed debauch, I was there to furnish the raw\nmaterial.",
        "I then tore up the deed and the two women went quietly away. After they\nhad gone, my client, in an absent-minded way, took out a large quid that\nhad outlived its usefulness, laid it tenderly on the open page of Estey’s\nPleadings, and said:",
        "“You doubtless think I am a singular organization, and that my ways are\npast finding out. I wish to ask you if I did right a moment ago?” Here he\ntook out another $20 and put it under the paper weight. “When I went down\nstairs I met my mother-in-law. She always looked to me like a firm woman,\nbut I did not think she was so unswerving as she really was. She asked me\nin a low, musical voice to please destroy the deed, and then she took one\nof them Smith & Wesson automatic advance agents of death out from under\nher apron and kind of wheedled me into saying I would.

It is true that the\nmost profitable study for mankind is man, but we should not overlook\nwoman. Woman is now seeking to be emancipated. Let us put our great,\nstrong arms around her and emancipate her. Even if we cannot emancipate\nbut one, we shall not have lived entirely for naught.",
        "I am told by those upon whom I can rely that there are hundreds of\nattractive young women throughout our joyous land who have arrived at\nyears of discretion and yet who have never been emancipated. I met a woman\non the cars last week who is lecturing on this subject, and she told me\nall about it. Now, the question at once presents itself, how shall we\nemancipate woman unless we go where she is? We must go right into society\nand take her by the hand and never let go of her hand till she is properly\nemancipated. Not only must she be emancipated, but she must be emancipated\nfrom her present thralldom. Thralldom of this kind is liable to break out\nin any community, and those who are now in perfect health may pine away in\na short time and flicker.",
        "My course, while mingling in society’s mad whirl, is to first open the\nconversation with a young lady by leading her away to the conservatory,\nwhere I ask her if she has ever been the victim of thralldom and whether\nor not she has ever been ground under the heel of the tyrant man. I then\ntime her pulse for thirty minutes, so as to strike a good average. The\nemancipation of woman is destined at some day to become one of our leading\nindustries.",

Therefore, I aimed my panic price cane at the driver\nof a cream-colored car with a blue stomach, and remarked, “Hi, there!\"\nBefore I go any further, and in order to avoid ambiguity, let me say that\nit was the car that had the blue stomach. He (the driver) twisted the\nbrake and I went inside, clear to the further end, and sat down by the\nside of a young woman who filled the whole car with sunshine. I was so\nhappy that I gave the conductor half a dollar and told him to keep the\nchange. If by chance she sees this, I hope she still remembers me. Pretty\nsoon a very fat woman came into the car and aimed for our quarter. She\nevidently intended to squat between this fair girl and myself. But ah,\nthought I to myself in a low tone of voice, I will fool thee. So I shoved\nmy person along in the seat toward the sweet girl of the Bay State. The\ncorpulent party, whose name I did not learn, had in the meantime backed up\nto where she had detected a slight vacancy, and where I had seen fit to\nplace myself. At that moment she heaved a sigh of relief, and, assisted by\nthe motion of the car, which just then turned a corner, she sat down in my\nlap and nestled in my bosom like a tired baby elephant.",

        "While all this was going on I lost track of my location. The car began to\nsquirm around all over Boston, and finally the conductor came back and\nwanted more money. I said no, I would get off and try a dark red car with\na green stomach for a while. So I did I rode on that till I had seen a\ngreat deal of new scenery, and then I asked the conductor if he passed\nNumber Clankety Clank, Blank street. He said he did not, but if I would go\ndown two blocks further and take a maroon car with a plaid stomach it\nwould take me to the corner of “What-do-you-call-it and What’s-his-name\nstreets,” where, if I took a seal brown car with squshed huckleberry\ntrimmings it would take me to where I wanted to go. So I tried it. I do\nnot know just where I missed my train, but when I found the seal brown car\nwith scrunched huckleberry trimmings it was going the other way, and as it\nwas late I went into a cafe and refreshed myself. When I came out I\ndiscovered that it was too late to see the collection, even if I could\nfind it, for at 6 o’clock they take the relics in and put them into a\nrefrigerator till morning.",
        "I was now weary and somewhat disappointed, so I desired to get back to my\nheadquarters, wherein I could rest and where I could lock myself up in my\nroom, so no prize fat woman could enter. I hailed one of those sawed-off\nlandaus, consisting of two wheels, one door behind, and a bill for two\nbits. I told the college graduate on the box where I wanted to go, gave\nhim a quarter and got in. I sat down and heaved a chaste sigh.

In fact I have been quite\na tourist and summer resorter this season, having saturated my system with\nnineteen different styles of mineral water in Wisconsin alone, and tried\nto win the attention of nineteen different styles of head waiters at these\nsummer hotels. I may add in passing that the summer hotels of Wisconsin\nand Minnesota have been crowded full the past season and more room will\nhave to be added before another season comes around.",

The\nwater at Palmyra Springs also tastes like any other pure water, but at\nKankanna, on the Fox River, they have a style of mineral water which is\ndifferent. Almost as soon as you taste it you discover that it is\nextremely different. Colonel Watrous, of the Milwaukee Sunday Telegraph,\ntook some of it. I saw him afterward. He looked depressed, and told me\nthat he had been deceived. Several Kankanna people had told him that this\nwas living water, He had discovered otherwise. He hated to place his\nconfidence in people and then find it misplaced.",
        "A favorite style of Kankanna revenge is to drink a quart of this water,\nand then, on meeting an enemy, to breathe on him and wither him. One\nbreath produces syncope and blind staggers. Two breaths induce coma and\nmetallic casket for one.",

If you want pure water\nyou get it at the spring near the foot of the fall, and if you want it\nflavored, with something that will leave a blazed road the whole length of\nyour alimentary canal, you go to the “blind pig,” a few rods away from the\nfalls.",

Beginning in Maine, where the most ingenious methods\nof whipping the devil around the stump are adopted, then going through\nnorthern Iowa and tasting her exhilarating pop, and at last paying ten\ncents to see the blind pig at Minnehaha, I feel like one who has wrestled\nwith the temperance problem in a practical way, and I have about decided\nthat a high license is about the only way to make the sale of whisky\nodious. Prohibition is too abrupt in its methods, and one generation can\nhardly wipe out the appetite for liquor that has been planted and fostered\nby fifty preceding generations.",
        "For fear that a few of my lady readers do not know what the Minnehaha\nblind pig looks like, and that they may be curious about it, I will just\nsay that it is a method of evading the law, and consists of a dumb waiter,\nwherein, if you pay ten cents, you get a glass of stimulants without the\nannoyance of conversation. Many ladies who visit the falls, and who have\nheard incidentally about the blind pig, express a desire to see the poor\nlittle thing, but their husbands generally persuade them to refrain.",

        "Daniel Webster had one of the largest and most robust brains that ever\nflourished in our fair land. It was what we frequently call a teeming\nbrain, one of those four-horse teeming brains, as it were. Mr. Webster\nwore the largest hat of any man then in Congress, and other senators and\nrepresentatives used to frequently borrow it to wear on the 2nd of\nJanuary, the 5th of July, and after other special occasions, when they had\nbeen in executive session most all night and endured great mental strain.\nThis hat matter reminds me of an incident in the life of Benjamin F.\nButler, a man well known in Massachusetts even at the present time.",
        "One evening, at a kind of reception or some such dissipation as that,\nwhile Jim Nye was in the Senate, the latter left his silk hat on the\nlounge with the opening turned up, and while he was talking with someone\nelse, Mr. Butler sat down in the hat with so much expression that it was a\nwreck. Everyone expected to see James W. Nye walk up and smite Benjamin F.\nButler, but he did not do so. He looked at the chaotic hat for a minute,\nmore in sorrow than in anger, and then he said:",
        "“Benjamin, I could have told you that hat wouldn’t fit you before you\ntried it on.”",
        "Daniel Webster’s brain was not only very large, but it was in good order\nall the time. Sometimes Nature bestows large brains on men who do not rise\nto great prominence. Large brains do not always indicate great\nintellectual power. These brains are large but of an inferior quality. A\nschoolmate of mine used to wear a hat that I could put my head and both\nfeet into with perfect ease. I remember that he tied my shirt one day\nwhile I was laying my well-rounded limbs in the mill pond near my\nchildhood’s home.",
        "I was mad at the time, but I could not lick him, for he was too large. All\nI could do was to patiently untie my shirt while my teeth chattered, then\nfling a large, three-cornered taunt in his teeth and run. He kept on\npoking fun at me, I remember, till I got dressed, and alluded\nincidentally, to my small brain and abnormal feet. This stung my sensitive\nnature, and I told him that if I had such a wealth of brain as he had, and\nit was of no use to think with, I would take it to a restaurant and have\nit breaded. Then I went away.",
        "But we were speaking of Webster. Many lawyers of our day would do well to\nread and study the illustrious example of Daniel Webster. He did not sit\nin court all day with his feet on the table and howl, “We object,” and\nthen down his client for $50, just because he had made a noise. I employed\na lawyer once to bring suit for me to recover quite a sum of money due me.\nAfter years of assessments and toilsome litigation, we got a judgment. He\nsaid to me that he was anxious to succeed with the case mainly because he\nknew I Wanted to vindicate myself. I said yes, that was the idea exactly.\nI wanted to be vindicated.",
        "So he gave me the vindication and took the judgment as a slight\ntestimonial of his own sterling worth. When I want to be vindicated again\nI will do it with one of those self-cocking vindicators that you can carry\nin a pocket.",
        "Looking over this letter, I am amazed to see the amount of valuable\ninformation relative to the life of Mr. Webster that I have succeeded in\nusing. There are, of course, some minor details of Mr. Webster’s life\nwhich I have omitted, but nothing of real importance. The true history of\nMr. Webster is epitomized here, and told in a pleasing and graceful\nmanner, a style that is at once accurate and just and still elegant,\nchaste and thoroughly refined, while at the same time there are little\ngobs of sly humor in it that are real cute.",
        "I remember one sunny day in summer, we were sitting in the Boomerang\noffice, I and the city editor, and he was speaking enviously of my salary\nof $150 per month as compared with his of $80, and I had just given him\nthe venerable minstrel witticism that of course my salary was much larger\nthan his, but he ought not to forget that he got his.",
        "Just then there was a revolver shot at the foot of our stairs, and then\nanother. The printers rushed into the stairway from the composing room,\nand to save time I ran out on the balcony that hung over the sidewalk and\nwhich gave me a bird’s-eye view of the murder. The next issue of the paper\ncontained an account about like this:",
        "Cold-Blooded Murder.–Yesterday, between 12 and 1 o’clock, in front of\nthis office on Second street, James McKeon, in a manner almost wholly\nunprovoked, shot James Smith, commonly known as Windy Smith. Smith died at\n2 o’clock this morning of his wounds. Windy Smith was not a bad man, but,\nas his nickname would imply, he was a kind of noisy, harmless fellow, and\nMcKeon, who is a gambler and professional bad man, can give no good reason\nfor the killing. There is a determined effort on foot to lynch the\nmurderer.",
        "This account was brief, but it seemed to set forth the facts pretty\nclearly, I thought, and I felt considerably chagrined when I saw an\naccount of the matter latter on, as written up by the prosecuting\nattorney.

        "I am now convinced that although the published account was correct, it was\nnot as full as it might have been. Perhaps the tendency of modern\njournalism is to epitomize too much. In the hurry of daily newspaper work\nand the press of matter upon our pages, very likely we are fatally brief,\nand sacrifice rhetorical beauty to naked and goose-pimply facts.",
        "The subject of meals, lunch-counters, dining-cars and buffet-cars came up\nthe other day, incidentally. I had ordered a little breakfast in the\nbuffet-car, not so much because I expected to get anything, but because I\nliked to eat in a car and have all the other passengers glaring at me. I\ndo not know which affords me the most pleasure–to sit for a photograph\nand be stabbed in the cerebellum with a cast-iron prong, to be fed in the\npresence of a mixed company of strangers, or to be called on without any\npreparation to make a farewell speech on the gallows.",
        "However, I got my breakfast after awhile. The waiter was certainly the\nmost worthless, trifling, half-asleep combination of Senegambian stupidity\nand poor white trash indolence and awkwardness that I ever saw. He brought\nin everything except what I wanted, and then wound up by upsetting the\nlittle cream pitcher in my lap. He did not charge for the cream. He threw\nthat in.",
        "So all the rest of the journey I was trying to eradicate a cream dado from\nmy pantaloons. It made me mad, because those pantaloons were made for me\nby request Besides, I haven’t got pantaloons to squander in that way. To\nsome a pair of pantaloons, more or less, is nothing, but it is much to me.",
        "There was a porter on the same train who was much the same kind of\nfurniture as the waiter. He slept days and made up berths all night.\nTruly, he began making up berths at Jersey City, and when he got through,\nabout daylight, it was time to begin to unmake them again. All night long\nI could hear him opening and shutting the berths like a concertina. He\nsang softly to himself all night long:",
        "  “You must camp a little in the wilderness\n  And then we’ll all go home.”",
        "He played his own accompaniment on the berths.",
        "When in repose he was generally asleep with a whisk broom in one hand and\nthe other hand extended with the palm up, waiting for a dividend to be\ndeclared.",
        "He generally slept with his mouth open, so that you could read his inmost\nthoughts, and when I complained to him about the way my bunk felt, he said\nhe was sorry, and wanted to know which cell I was in.",
        "I rode, years ago, over a new stage line for several days. It was through\nan almost trackless wilderness, and the service hadn’t been “expedited\"\nthen. It was not a star route, anyhow. The government seemed to think that\nthe man who managed the thing ought not to expect help so long as he had\nbeen such a fool asterisk it.",
        "(Five minutes intermission for those who wish to be chloroformed.)",
        "The stage consisted of a buckboard. It was one of the first buckboards\never made, and the horse was among the first turned out, also. The driver\nand myself were the passengers.",
        "When it got to be about dinner time, I asked him if we were not pretty\nnear the dinner station. He grunted. He hadn’t said a word since we\nstarted. He was a surly, morose and taciturn man. I was told that he had\nbeen disappointed in love. A half-breed woman named No-Wayno had led him\nto believe that she loved him, and that if it had not been for her husband\nshe would gladly have been the driver’s bride. So the driver assassinated\nthe disagreeable husband of No-Wayno. Then he went to the ranch to claim\nhis bride, but she was not there. She had changed her mind, and married a\ncattle man, who had just moved on to the range with a government mule and\na branding iron, intending to slowly work himself into the stock business.",
        "So this driver was a melancholy man. He only made one remark to me during\nthat long forty-mile drive through the wilderness. About dinner time he\ndrove the horse under a quaking asp tree, tied a nose bag of oats over its\nhead and took a wad of bread and bacon from his greasy pocket. The bacon\nand bread had little flakes of smoking tobacco all over it, because he\ncarried his grub and tobacco in the same pocket. For a moment he\nintroduced one corner of the bacon and bread in among his whiskers. Then\nhe made the only remark that he uttered while we were together. He said:",
        "“Pardner, dinner is now ready in the dining-car.”",
        "I once knew a man who was nominated by his fellow citizens for a certain\noffice and finally elected without having expended a cent for that\npurpose. He was very eccentric, but he made a good officer. When he heard\nthat he was nominated, he went up, as he said, into the mountains to do\nsome assessment work on a couple of claims. He got lost and didn’t get his\nbearings until a day or two after election. Then he came into town hungry,\ngreasy and ragged, but unpledged.",
        "He found that he was elected, and in answer to a telegram started off for\n’Frisco to see a dying relative. He did not get back till the first of\nJanuary. Then he filed his bond and sailed into the office. He fired\nseveral sedentary deputies who had been in the place twenty years just\nbecause they were good “workers.” That is, they were good workers at the\npolls. They saved all their energies for the campaign, and so they only\nhad vitality enough left to draw their salaries during the balance of the\ntwo years.",
        "This man raised the county scrip from sixty to ninety-five in less than\ntwo years, and still they busted him in the next convention. He was too\neccentric. One delegate asked what in Sam Hill would become of the country\nif every candidate should skin out during the campaign and rusticate in\nthe mountains while the battle was being fought.",
        "Says he, “I am a delegate from the precinct of Rawhide Buttes, and I\ncalklate I know what I am talkin’ about.

        "“Gentlemen, we talk about stringency and shrinkage of values, and all such\nfunny business as that; but that’s something I don’t know a blamed thing\nabout. What I can grapple with is this: If our county offices are worth\n$30,000, and there are other little after-claps and soft snaps, and\nwalk-overs, worth, say $10,000, and the boys, say, are willing to do the\nfair thing, say, blow in fifteen per cent, to the central committee, and\nwhat they feel like on the outside, then politics, instead of a burden and\na reproach, becomes a pleasing duty, a joyous occasion and a picnic to\nthose whose lives might otherwise be a dreary monotone.",
        "“Mr. Chairman, the past two years has wrecked four campaign saloons, and a\ntinner who socked his wife’s fortune into campaign torches is now in a\nland where torchlights is no good. Overcome by a dull market, a financial\ndepression and a reserved central committee, he ate a package of Rough on\nRats, and passed up the flume. He is now at rest over yonder.",
        "“Such instances would be common if we encouraged the eccentric economy of\nofficial cranks. It is an evil that is gnawing at the vitals of the\nrepublic. We must squench it or get left. There are millions of dollars in\nthis country, Mr. Chairman, that, if we keep it out of the campaign, will\nget into the hands of the working classes, and then you and I, Mr.\nChairman, and gentlemen of the convention, can starve to death. Keep the\ncampaign money away from the soulless hired man, gentlemen, or good-bye\nJohn.",
        "“Mr. Chairman, excuse my emotion! It is almighty seldom that I make a\nspeech, but when I do, I strive to get there with both feet. We must\neither work the campaign funds into their legitimate channels, or every\nblamed patriot within the sound of my voice will have to fasten on a tin\nbill and rustle for angle-worms amongst the hens.

        "Adelbert G. Grimes writes as follows: “I am a young man not yet twenty-two\nyears of age. I am said to be rather attractive in appearance and a fluent\nconversationalist. Three years ago I very foolishly married and settled on\na tree claim in Dakota, where we have three children, consisting of one\npair of twins and an ordinary child, born by itself. We are a considerable\ndistance from town, and to remain at home during the winter with no\ncompany besides my wife and children is very irksome, especially as my\nwife has never had the advantages that I have in the way of society. Her\nconversational powers are very inferior, and I cannot bear to remain at\nhome very much. So I go to town, where I can meet my equals and enjoy\nmyself.",
        "“I fear that this will lead to an estrangement, for, when I return at\nnight, my wife’s nose is so red from sniveling all day that I can hardly\nbear to look at her. If there is anything in this world that I hate, it is\na red-eyed, red-nosed woman who sheds tears on all occasions.",
        "“Of course all this makes me irritable, and I say sharp things to her, as\nI have a wonderful command of language at such times. She surely cannot\nexpect a young man twenty-two years old to stay at home day after day and\nlisten to squalling children, when he is still in the heyday of life with\njoy beaming in his eye.",
        "“Of course I do say things to my wife that I am afterward sorry for, but I\nmade a great mistake in marrying the woman I did, and although some of my\nlady friends told me so at the time, I did not then believe it. Do you\nthink I ought to bury myself on a tree claim with a woman far my inferior,\nwhile I have talents that would shine in the best of society? I am greatly\ndistressed, and would willingly seek a legal separation if I knew how to\ngo about it. Will you kindly advise me? What do you think of my\npenmanship?”",
        "I hardly know how to advise you, Adelbert. You have got yourself into a\nplace where you cannot do much but remain and take your medicine.\nUnfortunately, there are too many such young men as you are, Adelbert.\nYou are young, and handsome, and smart. You casually admit this in your\nletter, I see. You have a social nature, and would shine in society. You\nalso reluctantly confess this. That does not help you in my estimation,\nAdelbert. If you are a bright and shining light in society, you are\nprobably a brunette fizzle as a husband. When you resolved to take a tree\nclaim and make a home in Dakota, why didn’t you put your swallow-tail\ncoat under the bed and retire from the giddy whirl and mad rush of\nsociety, the way your wife had to?",
        "I dislike very much to speak to you in a plain, blunt way, Adelbert,\nbeing a total stranger to you, but when you convey the idea in your\nletter that you have made a great mistake in marrying at the age of\nnineteen, and marrying far beneath yourself, I am forced to agree with\nyou. If, instead of marrying a young girl who didn’t know any better\nthan to believe that you were a man, instead of a fractional one, you\nhad come to me, and borrowed my revolver and blown out the fungus\ngrowth which you refer to as your brains, you would have bit it. Even\nnow it is not too late. Yon can still come to me, and I will oblige\nyou. You cannot do your wife a greater favor at this time than to leave\nher a widow, and the sooner you do so the less orphans there will be.",
        "Did it ever occur to you, Adelbert, that your wife made a mistake also?\nDid it ever bore itself through your adamantine skull that it is not an\nunbroken round of gayety for a young girl to shut herself up in a lonesome\nhouse for three years, gradually acquiring children, and meantime being\n\"sassed” by her husband because she is not a fluent conversationalist?",
        "Wherein you offend me, Adelbert, is that you persist in breathing the air\nwhich human beings and other domestic animals more worthy than yourself\nare entitled to. There are too many such imitation men at large. There\nshould be a law that would prohibit your getting up and walking on your\nhind legs and thus imposing on other mammals. If I could run the\ngovernment for a few weeks, Adelbert, I would compel your style of\nzoological wonder to climb a tree and stay there.",
        "So you married a woman who was far your inferior, did you? How did you do\nit? Where did you go to find a woman who could be your inferior and still\nkeep out of the menagerie? Adelbert, I fear you do your wife a great\ninjustice. With just barely enough vitality to hand your name down to\nposterity and blast the fair future of Dakota by leaving your trade-mark\non future generations, you snivel and whine over your blasted life! If\nyour life had been blasted a little harder twenty years ago, the life of\nyour miserable little wife would have been less blasted.",
        "If you had acquired a little more croup twenty years ago, Dakota would\nhave been ahead. Why did you go on year after year, permitting people to\nbelieve you were a man, when you could have undeceived them in two minutes\nby crawling into a hollow log and remaining there?",
        "Your penmanship is very good. It is better than your chances for a bright\nimmortality beyond the grave. Write to me again whenever you feel lonesome\nor want advice. I was a young married man myself once, and I know what\nthey have to endure. Up to the time of my marriage, I had never known a\nharsher tone than a flute note; my early life ran quiet as the clear brook\nby which I sported, and so on. I was a great belle in society, also.

I have done some writing for the\npress, having written up a very nice article on progressive euchre, which\nwas a great success and published in our home paper, But it was not copied\nso much in other papers as I would like to have saw it, and I take my pen\nin hand at this time to write and ask you what there is in the article\nenclosed that prevents its being copied abroad all over our broad land. I\nwrite just as I hope you would feel perfectly free to write me at any\ntime. I think that writers ought to aid each other. Yours with kind\nregards,",

        "I have carefully read and pondered over the dissertation on progressive\neuchre which you send me, Algernon, and I cannot see why it should not be\nravenously seized and copied by the press of the broad, wide land referred\nto in your letters. If you have time, perhaps it would be well enough to\ngo to the leading journalists of our country and ask them what they mean\nby it. You might write till your vertebrae fell out of your clothes on the\nfloor, and it would not do half so much good as a personal conference with\nthe editors of America. First prepare your article, then go personally to\nthe editors of the country and call them one by one out into the hall, in\na current of cold air, and explain the article to them. In that way you\nwill form pleasant acquaintances and get solid with our leading\njournalists. You have no idea, Algernon, how lonely and desolate the life\nof a practical journalist is. Your fresh young face and your fresh young\nways, and your charming grammatical improvisations, would delight an\neditor who has nothing to do from year to year but attend to his business.",

        "At times you will be tempted to write such stuff as this, and mark it with\na large blue pencil and send it to the papers of the country, but that is\nnot a good way to do.",
        "Seriously, Algernon, I would suggest that you make a bold dash for success\nby writing things that other people are not writing, thinking things that\nother people are not thinking, and saying things that other people are not\nsaying. You will say that this advice is easier to give than to take, and\nI agree with you. But the tendency of the age is to wear the same style of\ncollar and coat and hat that every other man wears, and to talk and write\nlike other men; and to be frank with you, Algernon, I think it is an\ninfernal shame. If you will look carefully about you, you will see that\nthe preacher, who is talking mostly to dusty pew cushions, is also the\npreacher who is thinking the thoughts of other men. He is “up-ending” his\nbarrel of sermons annually, and they were made in the first place from the\nsermons of a man who also “up-ended” his barrel annually. Go where the\npreacher is talking to full houses, and you will discover that his sermons\nare full of humanity and originality. They are not written in a library by\na man with interchangeable ideas, an automatic cog-wheel thinker, but they\nare prepared by a man who earnestly and honestly studies the great, aching\nheart of humanity, and full of sincerity, originality and old-fashioned\nChristianity, appeals to your better impulses.",
        "How is it with our poetry? As a fellow-traveler and sea-sick tourist\nacross life’s tempestuous tide, I ask you, Algernon, who is writing the\npoetry that will live? Is it the man who is sawing out and sandpapering\nstanzas of the same general dimensions as some other poet, in which he\nbewails the fact that he loved a tall, well-behaved, accomplished girl,\nsixteen hands high, who did not require his love?",
        "Ah, no! He is not the poet whose terra cotta statue will stand in the\ncemetery, wearing a laurel wreath and a lumpy brow. Show me the poet who\nis intimate with nature and who studies the little joys and sorrows of the\npoor; who smells the clover and writes about live, healthy people with\nideas and appetites. He is my poet.",
        "I apologize for speaking so earnestly, Algernon, but I saw by your letter\nthat you felt kindly toward me, and rather invited an expression of\nopinion on my part. So I have written more freely, perhaps, than I\notherwise would. We are both writers. Measurably so, at least. You write\non progressive euchre, and I write on anything that I can get hold of. So\nlet us agree here and promise each other that, whatever we do, we will not\nthink through the thinker of another man.",
        "The Great Ruler of the universe has made and placed upon the earth a good\nmany millions of men, but He never made any two of them exactly alike. We\nmay differ from every one of the countless millions who have preceded us,\nand still be safe. Even you and I, Algernon, may agree in many matters,\nand yet be very dissimilar. At least I hope so, and I presume you do also.",
        "Alfonso Quanturnernit Dowdell, Frumenti, Ohio, writes to know something\nof the effects of alcohol on the brain of an adult, being evidently\napprehensive that some day he may become an adult himself He says:",
        "“I would be glad to know whether or not you think that liquor stimulates\nthe brain to do better literary work. I have been studying the personal\nhistory of Edgar A. Poe, and learned through that medium that he was in\nthe habit of drinking a good deal of liquor at times. I also read that\nGeorge D. Prentice, who wrote ’The Closing Year,’ and other nice poems,\nwas a hearty drinker. Will you tell me whether this is all true or not,\nand also what the effect of alcohol is on the brain of an adult?”",
        "It is said on good authority that Edgar A. Poe ever and anon imbibed the\npopular beverages of his day and age, some of which contained alcohol. We\nare led to believe these statements because they remain as yet undenied.\nBut Poe did a great deal of good in that way, for he set an example that\nhas been followed ever since, more or less, by quite a number of poets’\napprentices who emulated Poe’s great gift as a drinker. These men,\nthinking that poesy and delirium tremens went hand in hand, became fluent\ndrunkards early in their career, so that finally, instead of issuing a\nsmall blue volume of poems they punctuated a drunkard’s grave.",
        "So we see that Poe did a great work aside from what he wrote. He opened up\na way for these men which eradicated them, and made life more desirable\nfor those who remained. He made it easy for those who thought genius and\ninebriation were synonymous terms to get to the hospital early in the day,\nwhile the overworked waste-basket might secure a few hours of much needed\nrest.",
        "George D. Prentice has also done much toward weeding out a class of people\nwho otherwise might have become disagreeable. It is better that these men\nwho write under the influence of rum should fall into the hands of the\npolice as early as possible. The police can handle them better than the\neditor can.",
        "Do not try, Alfonso, to experiment in this way. Because Mr. Poe and Mr.\nPrentice could write beautiful and witty things between drinks, do not, oh\ndo not imagine that you can begin that way and succeed at last.",
        "The effect of alcohol on the brain of an adult is to congest it finally.\nAlcohol will sometimes congest the brain of an adult under the most trying\nand discouraging circumstances. I have frequently known it to scorch out\nand paralyze the brain in cases where other experiments had not been\nsuccessful in showing the presence of a brain at all.",
        "That is the reason why some people love to fool with this great chemical.\nIt revives their suspicions regarding the presence of a brain.",
        "The habits of literary men vary a good deal, for no two of them seem to\ncare to adopt the same plan.",
        "I have taken the liberty of showing here my own laboratory and methods of\nthought. This is from a drawing made by myself, and represents the writer\nin his study and in the act of thinking about a poem.",
        "Last summer I wrote a large poem entitled, “Moanings of the Moist,\nMalarious Sea.” I have it still. The back of it has a memoranda on it in\nblue pencil from the leading editors of our broad land, but otherwise it\nis just as I wrote it.",
        "The engraving represents me in the act of thinking about the poem, and\nwhat I will do with the money when I get it.",
        "I am now preparing a poem entitled, “The Umbrella.” It is a dainty\nlittle bit of verse, and my hired man thinks it is a gem. I called it “The\nUmbrella” so that it would not be returned.",
        "By looking at the drawing you will see the rapid change of expression on\nthe face as the work goes on.",
        "I give the drawing in order also, to show the rich furniture of the room.\nAll poets do not revel in such gaudy trappings as I do, but I cannot write\nwell in a bare and ill-furnished room. In these apartments there is also a\nwindow which does not show in the engraving. I have tried over and over\nagain to write a poem in a room that had no window in it, but I cannot say\nthat I ever wrote one under such circumstances that I thought would live.",
        "You can do as you think best about furnishing your room as I have mine.\nYou might, of course, succeed as well by writing in a plainer apartment,\nbut I could not. All my poetical work that was done in the cramped and\nplainly furnished room that I formerly occupied over Knadler’s livery\nstable, was ephemeral.",
        "It got into a few of the leading autograph albums of the country, but it\nnever got into the papers.",
        "I would not use alcohol, however. Poe and Prentice could use it, but I\nnever could. After a long debauch, I could always work well enough on the\nstreet but I could not do literary work.",
