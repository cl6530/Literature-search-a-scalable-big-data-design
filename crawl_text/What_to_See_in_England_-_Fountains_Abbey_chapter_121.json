        "Fountains Abbey, about 2 miles south-west from Ripon in Yorkshire,\nstands in a beautiful wooded valley, through which runs a pretty stream\nknown as the Skell. The abbey is noted for the great extent of its\nremains, which seem to have escaped any wanton destruction. A fine tower\nat the north end of the transept still stands, but the central one has\nfallen into great decay. Besides the church there are many remains of\nthis famous abbey, which at the time of the dissolution of the\nmonasteries was one of the richest in the country. The cloisters, 300\nfeet long, are unsurpassed in England. They extend across an archway\nover the stream, and are lit by lancet windows. There are also remains\nof the chapter-house, the refectory, and the kitchen with its two wide\nfireplaces.",
        "The history of the foundation of Fountains Abbey is of considerable\ninterest. In the twelfth century some monks of the Benedictine monastery\nof St. Mary at York, being attracted by the sanctity of the inmates of\nthe Cistercian abbey of Rievaulx in Yorkshire, became dissatisfied with\ntheir own form of government, and wished to adopt the rules of Rievaulx\nAbbey and withdraw from their own monastery. This naturally did not\nplease their abbot; but eventually, after appealing to the Archbishop of\nYork, some land in a lonely valley, known as Skell Dale, was granted to\nthem. Here, in the depth of winter, without shelter or means of\nsubsistence, the pious monks suffered great hardship. After a few years\nHugh, Dean of York, left all his possessions to the Abbey of Fountains,\nand after this endowments and benefactions flowed in.",
        "In 1140 the abbey was burnt down, but in 1204 the restoration was\nrecommenced, and the foundations of a new church, of which the present\nruins are the remains, were laid. The great tower, however, was not\ncompleted till the end of the fourteenth century.",
        "At the Dissolution Sir Richard Gresham bought the estates, and they are\nnow owned by the descendants of Mr. William Aislabie of Studley Royal.",
