        "When Dick was dressed in his new suit, he surveyed his figure with\npardonable complacency. It was the best he had ever worn, and fitted\nhim as well as if it had been made expressly for him.",
        "“He’s done the handsome thing,” said Dick to himself; “but there\nwasn’t no ’casion for his givin’ me these clothes. My lucky stars\nare shinin’ pretty bright now. Jumpin’ into the water pays better\nthan shinin’ boots; but I don’t think I’d like to try it more’n once\na week.”",
        "About eleven o’clock the next morning Dick repaired to Mr.\nRockwell’s counting-room on Pearl Street. He found himself in front\nof a large and handsome warehouse. The counting-room was on the\nlower floor. Our hero entered, and found Mr. Rockwell sitting at a\ndesk. No sooner did that gentleman see him than he arose, and,\nadvancing, shook Dick by the hand in the most friendly manner.",
        "“My young friend,” he said, “you have done me so great service that\nI wish to be of some service to you in return. Tell me about\nyourself, and what plans or wishes you have formed for the future.”",
        "Dick frankly related his past history, and told Mr. Rockwell of his\ndesire to get into a store or counting-room, and of the failure of\nall his applications thus far. The merchant listened attentively to\nDick’s statement, and, when he had finished, placed a sheet of paper\nbefore him, and, handing him a pen, said, “Will you write your name\non this piece of paper?”",
        "Dick wrote in a free, bold hand, the name Richard Hunter. He had\nvery much improved in his penmanship, as has already been mentioned,\nand now had no cause to be ashamed of it.",
        "Mr. Rockwell surveyed it approvingly.",
        "“How would you like to enter my counting-room as clerk, Richard?” he\nasked.",
        "Dick was about to say “Bully,” when he recollected himself, and\nanswered, “Very much.”",
        "“I suppose you know something of arithmetic, do you not?”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“Then you may consider yourself engaged at a salary of ten dollars a\nweek. You may come next Monday morning.”",
        "“Ten dollars!” repeated Dick, thinking he must have misunderstood.",
        "“Yes; will that be sufficient?”",
        "“It’s more than I can earn,” said Dick, honestly.",
        "“Perhaps it is at first,” said Mr. Rockwell, smiling; “but I am\nwilling to pay you that. I will besides advance you as fast as your\nprogress will justify it.”",
        "Dick was so elated that he hardly restrained himself from some\ndemonstration which would have astonished the merchant; but he\nexercised self-control, and only said, “I’ll try to serve you so\nfaithfully, sir, that you won’t repent having taken me into your\nservice.”",
        "“And I think you will succeed,” said Mr. Rockwell, encouragingly. “I\nwill not detain you any longer, for I have some important business\nto attend to. I shall expect to see you on Monday morning.”",
        "Dick left the counting-room, hardly knowing whether he stood on his\nhead or his heels, so overjoyed was he at the sudden change in his\nfortunes. Ten dollars a week was to him a fortune, and three times\nas much as he had expected to obtain at first. Indeed he would have\nbeen glad, only the day before, to get a place at three dollars a\nweek. He reflected that with the stock of clothes which he had now\non hand, he could save up at least half of it, and even then live\nbetter than he had been accustomed to do; so that his little fund in\nthe savings bank, instead of being diminished, would be steadily\nincreasing. Then he was to be advanced if he deserved it. It was\nindeed a bright prospect for a boy who, only a year before, could\nneither read nor write, and depended for a night’s lodging upon\nthe chance hospitality of an alley-way or old wagon. Dick’s great\nambition to “grow up ’spectable” seemed likely to be accomplished\nafter all.",
        "“I wish Fosdick was as well off as I am,” he thought generously. But\nhe determined to help his less fortunate friend, and assist him up\nthe ladder as he advanced himself.",
        "When Dick entered his room on Mott Street, he discovered that some\none else had been there before him, and two articles of wearing\napparel had disappeared.",
        "“By gracious!” he exclaimed; “somebody’s stole my Washington coat\nand Napoleon pants. Maybe it’s an agent of Barnum’s, who expects to\nmake a fortun’ by exhibitin’ the valooable wardrobe of a gentleman\nof fashion.”",
        "Dick did not shed many tears over his loss, as, in his present\ncircumstances, he never expected to have any further use for the\nwell-worn garments. It may be stated that he afterwards saw them\nadorning the figure of Micky Maguire; but whether that estimable\nyoung man stole them himself, he never ascertained. As to the loss,\nDick was rather pleased that it had occurred. It seemed to cut him\noff from the old vagabond life which he hoped never to resume.\nHenceforward he meant to press onward, and rise as high as possible.",
        "Although it was yet only noon, Dick did not go out again with his\nbrush. He felt that it was time to retire from business. He would\nleave his share of the public patronage to other boys less fortunate\nthan himself. That evening Dick and Fosdick had a long conversation.\nFosdick rejoiced heartily in his friend’s success, and on his side\nhad the pleasant news to communicate that his pay had been advanced\nto six dollars a week.",
        "“I think we can afford to leave Mott Street now,” he continued.\n“This house isn’t as neat as it might be, and I shall like to live\nin a nicer quarter of the city.”",
        "“All right,” said Dick. “We’ll hunt up a new room to-morrow. I shall\nhave plenty of time, having retired from business. I’ll try to get\nmy reg’lar customers to take Johnny Nolan in my place. That boy\nhasn’t any enterprise. He needs some body to look out for him.”",
        "“You might give him your box and brush, too, Dick.”",
        "“No,” said Dick; “I’ll give him some new ones, but mine I want\nto keep, to remind me of the hard times I’ve had, when I was an\nignorant boot-black, and never expected to be anything better.”",
        "“When, in short, you were ’Ragged Dick.’ You must drop that name,\nand think of yourself now as\"–",
        "“Richard Hunter, Esq.,” said our hero, smiling.",
        "“A young gentleman on the way to fame and fortune,” added Fosdick.",
        "                              –––-",
        "Here ends the story of Ragged Dick. As Fosdick said, he is Ragged Dick\nno longer. He has taken a step upward, and is determined to mount still\nhigher. There are fresh adventures in store for him, and for others who\nhave been introduced in these pages. Those who have felt interested in\nhis early life will find his history continued in a new volume, forming\nthe second of the series, to be called,–",
