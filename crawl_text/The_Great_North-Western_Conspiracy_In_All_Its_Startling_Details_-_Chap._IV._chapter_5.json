        "NEW ERA IN SECRET POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS–PLEDGE TO “TAKE UP ARMS” FOR\nJEFF. DAVIS–TRUE DEMOCRACY STRUCK DOWN–NATIONAL AND STATE LEADERS–\nINVINCIBLE CLUB LEADERS–VALLANDIGHAM’S RETURN TO THE STATES IN HIS\nCAPACITY OF SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE SONS OF LIBERTY.",
        "A new era in the history of secret political orders was opened by the Sons\nof Liberty.",
        "As the Presidential election of 1864 approached, the party in the minority\nbegan to appreciate the awkwardness of its attitude upon the political\nissues of the day, and appeared determined in its conclusion to obtain the\nascendency in the coming administration, by means of fraud and force.",
        "The great mass of the party had now become conversant and familiar with\nevery species of political crime, through secret organization, and it only\nremained for the leaders to decide upon a programme, to have it executed\nwith despatch and fidelity.",
        "Languishing under the lash of chastisement inflicted upon those infamous\nenough to aid and abet the cause of dismemberment, mutual hate and\nslaughter, National extinction and death, they swore in this Order an\neternal and most dreadful oath of vengeance upon their offenders, and\npledged themselves, under fearful penalties of death, “ever to take up\narms in the cause of the oppressed in their own country, first of all,\nagainst any monarch, prince, potentate, power or government usurped, and\nfound in arms and waging war against a people or peoples, who had of their\nown free choice, inaugurated a government for themselves, in accordance\nwith and founded upon the eternal principles of truth.”",
        "Thus, the liveliest form of ancient or modern civilization, in a republic\njust rising to the glories of empire, was to be sacrificed to the mad\nnotion of petty “State Sovereignty,” by a sworn band of desperadoes. How\nsad when other generations would ask, where is the Federal Government, to\nbe answered only by poets, who would sing her elegy, as in the past they\nhave sang that of the lamented Hellas:",
        "The thought of the miserable commentary stirs the ire of the patriot and\nnerves his arm to daring deeds, in the holy cause of liberty, the\nconstitution, and his country.",
        "Skulk back into your dark dens of iniquity, you Clement L. Vallandigham,\nand you James A. McMaster, and you S. Corning Judd, and you Amos Green,\nand you P.C. Wright, (in Fort Lafayette where you ought to be,) before the\nwrath of honest people falls upon your wicked heads! Each of you, with the\nexception of you, Wright, being too infamous for that, even, have been\nbefore the Commission at Cincinnati, and stand before an outraged people\ncondemned out of your own lips! Dare insult the light of day with your\nhideous faces, and be dashed in pieces on the rocks of public scorn!",
        "But to return to our text, the Sons of Liberty, we find that undaunted\norganization in full blast from the time of its official inception in New\nYork up to the Monday morning of the arrests on the 7th of November last.",
        "It is now proposed to show, by an allusion to certain prominent facts\noccurring during the summer of ’64, that the so-called Democratic party\nwas the mainspring to the great conspiracy that has been attempted in the\nNorth with so much audacity that many men of the best judgment can\nscarcely believe it to be a reality. In this we do not wish to be\nunderstood that all men who have heretofore voted the “unterrified\"\nticket, have knowingly and willingly given aid and comfort to the\ntreasonable plans and purposes of their leaders, for our personal\nacquaintance among that class of anti-administration men, is sufficient to\nenable us to say, with confidence, that many of them are as loyal at heart\nas any man who ever breathed the air of an American freeman.",
        "But we mean this, and proclaim the fact in the face of every foe, that\nupon the death of that lamented statesman and patriot, Stephen A. Douglas,\nthe Woods and McMasters of New York, the Seymours of Connecticut, the\nVallandighams and Pendletons of Ohio, the Voorhees and Dodds of Indiana,\nthe Judds and Greens of Illinois, and others of like ilk in other States,\nobtained the chieftainship of the party and inveigled its too pliable\nranks into the prostituting embrace of this foul conspiracy, to overthrow\nthe government and crown with success the cause of the confederate arms.\nIt must be readily seen by every honest man of ordinary intelligence, that\nsuch an affair could never have gained a foothold among our people under a\ntruly loyal condition of the opposing party. The truthfulness of this\nassertion is so very forcible to the candid reader, that illustration or\nargument in support of it would be superfluous. However, occasional\nincidents will serve better to connect popular leaders with the subject of\nthese sketches, and call to the minds of participants practical facts.",
        "Brig. Gen. Charles Walsh, some time during the winter of ’64 and ’65,\nreceived his quantum of a fund, of which we shall hereafter speak, to\npurchase arms to be distributed in the 1st Congressional district of\nIllinois, comprising the county of Cook, and the scene of the late Chicago\nconspiracy, the enactment of which was to be the signal for a general\nconflagration of our cities, and thus fulfil the prophecy of Jeff. Davis,\nthat the grass would grow again, on the streets of the cities of the\nNorth.",
        "Do the leaders of the Invincible Club, among whom are W.C. Goudy, John\nGarrick, Malcom McDonald, and Dr. Swayne Wickersham, remember that that\ninstitution was to be the public mouth-piece of the Sons of Liberty, in an\naddress to the Democracy of Chicago, to have been issued during the\nPresidential campaign?",
        "Do they also remember the joint delegation of Invincibles and Sons of\nLiberty that received Vallandigham and the Woods of New York, on their\narrival in Chicago to participate in, and mould the proceedings of the\nNational Democratic Convention?",
        "Do they further remember the remarkable speech made in their Hall during\nthe Convention, by Capt. Rynders of New York, whom they hissed from the\nplatform for his bold and fearless expression of loyal sentiments?",
        "Do they remember the motto, “Never worship the setting sun,” which\nappeared on transparencies, and frequently fell from their own lips, and\nwas meant as a hit upon those who were supposed to have allied themselves\nwith treason, because of their belief in its eventual success?",
        "Do they remember how it was proposed that Charles Walsh, of the Sons of\nLiberty, was to negotiate a purchase of the Chicago Post, and convert it\nto the same villainous purpose of its contemporary, the Times?",
        "Have they forgotten the fifty or sixty thousand dollars raised by\nsubscription to the books of the Club, nominally to be used for procession\nand illuminating purposes, but which was used for the purchase of arms and\nthe importation of butternuts, to engage in the attack upon Camp Douglas?",
        "Have they forgotten that large sums of this money was obtained under false\npretences–under pretences that it was to be used for ordinary campaign\npurposes?",
        "Have they forgotten that through their instrumentality the McClellan\nEscorts, then organized in every ward, were officered by Sons of Liberty?",
        "Have they forgotten the meeting of Invincible Club members and Sons of\nLiberty in the sanctum sanctorum of the Chicago Times, where the\nquestion of punishing Col. R.M. Hough and Mr. Eddy, in redress of personal\ninjuries alleged to have been inflicted upon Wilbur F. Story, was gravely\ndiscussed by B.G. Caulfield, O.J. Rose, Alderman Barrett, S. Remington and\nothers, and where also, large numbers of muskets and smaller arms were\nexhibited?",
        "And lastly, have they forgotten that the Sons of Liberty, upon a certain\noccasion well known to every Copperhead member of the last Common Council\nof the city of Chicago, held themselves in readiness till after midnight,\nexpecting to be called to the assistance of that, at that time,\ntreasonable body?",
        "None know the significance of these questions better than the persons\nabove mentioned, and others who were on hand about those times. The\nmerchants of South Water street in Chicago can now, perhaps, explain why\nthey were called upon to subscribe so heavily to the books of the\nInvincible Club, and the writer would suggest the propriety of these\nmerchants compelling those who solicited these subscriptions, to deliver\nup the arms so purchased, or refund the money to its rightful owners.",
        "It is pretty well understood, we believe, that the Bridgeport Irish, vote\nthe “straight ticket.” It is said, also, that James Geary, a Son of\nLiberty and “old clothes man” on the corner of Wells and Madison streets,\ncould “influence hundreds of them by the wave of his hand.” Now this “old\nclothes man” was empowered to furnish food, raiment and shelter to all\nescaped rebel prisoners, and charge the same to the Sons of Liberty,\nalias the Invincible Club, which, it is thought, sometimes paid such\nbills out of South Water Street money subscribed for processions and\nilluminations. These facts are the keys to the revenue plan of the Sons\nof Liberty.",
        "The complicity of the “straight ticket” voters in this scheme is further\nshown by the character of their State ticket, headed by Robinson for\nGovernor, Judd for Lieut. Governor, and Hise of La Salle for Auditor, each\nSons of Liberty, and Judd the Grand Commander of the State. If, as it\nwould be made to appear, there was no complicity between the Democracy and\nthe Confederate agents, why did Vallandigham, the Supreme Commander of an\nOrder having its inception in Richmond, address the people from every\nstump in Illinois? If there was no complicity, why did Vallandigham, on\nhis return from exile, in his official capacity, with his staff around\nhim, defy the United States government that had justly banished him–with\n80,000 Ohioans at his command?",
        "If no complicity, why did all the rebels and confederate agents in Canada\ncome to the Chicago Convention, and why were they here again at the\nNovember election? Copperheads of Chicago and elsewhere, answer these\nquestions!",
