        "One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with\nJane had been formed, as he and the females of the family\nwere sitting together in the dining-room, their attention\nwas suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage;\nand they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.\nIt was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.\nThe horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery\nof the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.  As it\nwas certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley\ninstantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of\nsuch an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.\nThey both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was\nthrown open and their visitor entered.  It was Lady Catherine\nde Bourgh.",
        "They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of\nMrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to\nthem, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.",
        "She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,\nmade no other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight\ninclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.\nElizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship’s\nentrance, though no request of introduction had been made.",
        "Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a\nguest of such high importance, received her with the utmost\npoliteness.  After sitting for a moment in silence, she said\nvery stiffly to Elizabeth,",
        "“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.  That lady, I suppose,\nis your mother.”",
        "Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.",
        "“And that I suppose is one of your sisters.”",
        "“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady\nCatherine.  “She is my youngest girl but one.  My youngest of\nall is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the\ngrounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon\nbecome a part of the family.”",
        "“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine\nafter a short silence.",
        "“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say;\nbut I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”",
        "“This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,\nin summer; the windows are full west.”",
        "Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,\nand then added:",
        "“May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you\nleft Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.”",
        "“Yes, very well.  I saw them the night before last.”",
        "Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for\nher from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for\nher calling.  But no letter appeared, and she was completely\npuzzled.",
        "Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take\nsome refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not\nvery politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up,\nsaid to Elizabeth,",
        "“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little\nwilderness on one side of your lawn.  I should be glad to take\na turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.”",
        "“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about\nthe different walks.  I think she will be pleased with the\nhermitage.”",
        "Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her\nparasol, attended her noble guest downstairs.  As they passed\nthrough the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the\ndining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after\na short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.",
        "Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\nwaiting-woman was in it.  They proceeded in silence along the\ngravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to\nmake no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more\nthan usually insolent and disagreeable.",
        "“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she\nlooked in her face.",
        "As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the\nfollowing manner:–",
        "“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason\nof my journey hither.  Your own heart, your own conscience,\nmust tell you why I come.”",
        "Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.",
        "“Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.  I have not been at all able\nto account for the honour of seeing you here.”",
        "“Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you\nought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.  But however\ninsincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so.\nMy character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and\nfrankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall\ncertainly not depart from it.  A report of a most alarming\nnature reached me two days ago.  I was told that not only your\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married,\nbut that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all\nlikelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own\nnephew, Mr. Darcy.  Though I know it must be a scandalous\nfalsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose\nthe truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off\nfor this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.”",
        "“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth,\ncolouring with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the\ntrouble of coming so far.  What could your ladyship propose by\nit?”",
        "“At once to insist upon having such a report universally\ncontradicted.”",
        "“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said\nElizabeth coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it; if,\nindeed, such a report is in existence.”",
        "“If!  Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?  Has it not\nbeen industriously circulated by yourselves?  Do you not know\nthat such a report is spread abroad?”",
        "“I never heard that it was.”",
        "“And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation\nfor it?”",
        "“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.\nYou may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.”",
        "“This is not to be borne.  Miss Bennet, I insist on being\nsatisfied.  Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of\nmarriage?”",
        "“Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”",
        "“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of\nhis reason.  But your arts and allurements may, in a moment\nof infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself\nand to all his family.  You may have drawn him in.”",
        "“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”",
        "“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?  I have not been accustomed\nto such language as this.  I am almost the nearest relation he has\nin the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”",
        "“But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour\nas this, ever induce me to be explicit.”",
        "“Let me be rightly understood.  This match, to which you have\nthe presumption to aspire, can never take place.  No, never.\nMr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter.  Now what have you to say?”",
        "“Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose\nhe will make an offer to me.”",
        "Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:",
        "“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.  From their\ninfancy, they have been intended for each other.  It was the\nfavourite wish of his mother, as well as of her’s.  While in\ntheir cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment\nwhen the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their\nmarriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth,\nof no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the\nfamily!  Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?\nTo his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh?  Are you lost to\nevery feeling of propriety and delicacy?  Have you not heard\nme say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his\ncousin?”",
        "“Yes, and I had heard it before.  But what is that to me?  If\nthere is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall\ncertainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and\naunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh.  You both did as much\nas you could in planning the marriage.  Its completion depended\non others.  If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination\nconfined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?\nAnd if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”",
        "“Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.\nYes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed\nby his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the\ninclinations of all.  You will be censured, slighted, and\ndespised, by everyone connected with him.  Your alliance will\nbe a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any\nof us.”",
        "“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth.  “But the\nwife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of\nhappiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she\ncould, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.”",
        "“Obstinate, headstrong girl!  I am ashamed of you!  Is this\nyour gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?  Is\nnothing due to me on that score?  Let us sit down.  You are to\nunderstand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined\nresolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded\nfrom it.  I have not been used to submit to any person’s whims.\nI have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”",
        "“_That will make your ladyship’s situation at present more\npitiable; but it will have no effect on me.”",
        "“I will not be interrupted.  Hear me in silence.  My daughter\nand my nephew are formed for each other.  They are descended,\non the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the\nfather’s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient–though\nuntitled–families.  Their fortune on both sides is splendid.\nThey are destined for each other by the voice of every member\nof their respective houses; and what is to divide them?\nThe upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,\nconnections, or fortune.  Is this to be endured!  But it\nmust not, shall not be.  If you were sensible of your own\ngood, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you\nhave been brought up.”",
        "“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as\nquitting that sphere.  He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s\ndaughter; so far we are equal.”",
        "“True.  You are a gentleman’s daughter.  But who was your\nmother?  Who are your uncles and aunts?  Do not imagine me\nignorant of their condition.”",
        "“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your\nnephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.”",
        "“Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?”",
        "Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging\nLady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but\nsay, after a moment’s deliberation:",
        "“I am not.”",
        "Lady Catherine seemed pleased.",
        "“And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?”",
        "“I will make no promise of the kind.”",
        "“Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.  I expected to find a\nmore reasonable young woman.  But do not deceive yourself into\na belief that I will ever recede.  I shall not go away till you\nhave given me the assurance I require.”",
        "“And I certainly never shall give it.  I am not to be intimidated\ninto anything so wholly unreasonable.  Your ladyship wants\nMr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the\nwished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable?\nSupposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept\nhis hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?  Allow me to\nsay, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have\nsupported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous\nas the application was ill-judged.  You have widely mistaken my\ncharacter, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions\nas these.  How far your nephew might approve of your interference\nin his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right\nto concern yourself in mine.  I must beg, therefore, to be\nimportuned no farther on the subject.”",
        "“Not so hasty, if you please.  I have by no means done.\nTo all the objections I have already urged, I have still\nanother to add.  I am no stranger to the particulars of your\nyoungest sister’s infamous elopement.  I know it all; that\nthe young man’s marrying her was a patched-up business, at the\nexpence of your father and uncles.  And is such a girl to be\nmy nephew’s sister?  Is her husband, is the son of his late\nfather’s steward, to be his brother?  Heaven and earth!–of\nwhat are you thinking?  Are the shades of Pemberley to be\nthus polluted?”",
        "“You can now have nothing further to say,” she resentfully\nanswered.  “You have insulted me in every possible method.\nI must beg to return to the house.”",
        "And she rose as she spoke.  Lady Catherine rose also, and they\nturned back.  Her ladyship was highly incensed.",
        "“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my\nnephew!  Unfeeling, selfish girl!  Do you not consider that\na connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of\neverybody?”",
        "“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say.  You know my\nsentiments.”",
        "“You are then resolved to have him?”",
        "“I have said no such thing.  I am only resolved to act in that\nmanner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,\nwithout reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected\nwith me.”",
        "“It is well.  You refuse, then, to oblige me.  You refuse to\nobey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.  You are\ndetermined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends,\nand make him the contempt of the world.”",
        "“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth,\n“have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.  No\nprinciple of either would be violated by my marriage with\nMr. Darcy.  And with regard to the resentment of his family, or\nthe indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his\nmarrying me, it would not give me one moment’s concern–and\nthe world in general would have too much sense to join in the\nscorn.”",
        "“And this is your real opinion!  This is your final resolve!\nVery well.  I shall now know how to act.  Do not imagine, Miss\nBennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.  I came to\ntry you.  I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it,\nI will carry my point.”",
        "In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the\ndoor of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,\n“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.  I send no compliments to\nyour mother.  You deserve no such attention.  I am most\nseriously displeased.”",
        "Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade\nher ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it\nherself.  She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded\nup stairs.  Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the\ndressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in\nagain and rest herself.",
        "“She did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.”",
        "“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was\nprodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us\nthe Collinses were well.  She is on her road somewhere, I dare\nsay, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well\ncall on you.  I suppose she had nothing particular to say to\nyou, Lizzy?”",
        "Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here;\nfor to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was\nimpossible.",
