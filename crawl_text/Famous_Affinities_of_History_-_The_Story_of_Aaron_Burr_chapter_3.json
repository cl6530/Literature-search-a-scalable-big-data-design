        "There will come a time when the name of Aaron Burr will be cleared\nfrom the prejudice which now surrounds it, when he will stand in\nthe public estimation side by side with Alexander Hamilton, whom\nhe shot in a duel in 1804, but whom in many respects he curiously\nresembled. When the white light of history shall have searched\nthem both they will appear as two remarkable men, each having his\nown undoubted faults and at the same time his equally undoubted\nvirtues.",
        "Burr and Hamilton were born within a year of each other–Burr\nbeing a grandson of Jonathan Edwards, and Alexander Hamilton being\nthe illegitimate son of a Scottish merchant in the West Indies.\nEach of them was short in stature, keen of intellect, of great\nphysical endurance, courage, and impressive personality. Each as a\nyoung man served on the staff of Washington during the\nRevolutionary War, and each of them quarreled with him, though in\na different way.",
        "On one occasion Burr was quite unjustly suspected by Washington of\nlooking over the latter’s shoulder while he was writing.\n“Washington leaped to his feet with the exclamation:",
        "“How dare you, Colonel Burr?”",
        "Burr’s eyes flashed fire at the question, and he retorted,\nhaughtily:",
        "“Colonel Burr DARE do anything.”",
        "This, however, was the end of their altercation The cause of\nHamilton’s difference with his chief is not known, but it was a\nmuch more serious quarrel; so that the young officer left his\nstaff position in a fury and took no part in the war until the\nend, when he was present at the battle of Yorktown.",
        "Burr, on the other hand, helped Montgomery to storm the heights of\nQuebec, and nearly reached the upper citadel when his commander\nwas shot dead and the Americans retreated. In all this confusion\nBurr showed himself a man of mettle. The slain Montgomery was six\nfeet high, but Burr carried his body away with wonderful strength\namid a shower of musket-balls and grape-shot.",
        "Hamilton had no belief in the American Constitution, which he\ncalled “a shattered, feeble thing.” He could never obtain an\nelective office, and he would have preferred to see the United\nStates transformed into a kingdom. Washington’s magnanimity and\nclear-sightedness made Hamilton Secretary of the Treasury. Burr,\non the other hand, continued his military service until the war\nwas ended, routing the enemy at Hackensack, enduring the horrors\nof Valley Forge, commanding a brigade at the battle of Monmouth,\nand heading the defense of the city of New Haven. He was also\nattorney-general of New York, was elected to the United States\nSenate, was tied with Jefferson for the Presidency, and then\nbecame Vice-President.",
        "Both Hamilton and Burr were effective speakers; but, while\nHamilton was wordy and diffuse, Burr spoke always to the point,\nwith clear and cogent reasoning. Both were lavish spenders of\nmoney, and both were engaged in duels before the fatal one in\nwhich Hamilton fell. Both believed in dueling as the only way of\nsettling an affair of honor. Neither of them was averse to love\naffairs, though it may be said that Hamilton sought women, while\nBurr was rather sought by women. When Secretary of the Treasury,\nHamilton was obliged to confess an adulterous amour in order to\nsave himself from the charge of corrupt practices in public\noffice. So long as Burr’s wife lived he was a devoted, faithful\nhusband to her. Hamilton was obliged to confess his illicit acts\nwhile his wife, formerly Miss Elizabeth Schuyler, was living. She\nspent her later years in buying and destroying the compromising\ndocuments which her husband had published for his countrymen to\nread.",
        "The most extraordinary thing about Aaron Burr was the magnetic\nquality that was felt by every one who approached him. The roots\nof this penetrated down into a deep vitality. He was always young,\nalways alert, polished in manner, courageous with that sort of\ncourage which does not even recognize the presence of danger,\ncharming in conversation, and able to adapt it to men or women of\nany age whatever. His hair was still dark in his eightieth year.\nHis step was still elastic, his motions were still as spontaneous\nand energetic, as those of a youth.",
        "So it was that every one who knew him experienced his fascination.\nThe rough troops whom he led through the Canadian swamps felt the\niron hand of his discipline; yet they were devoted to him, since\nhe shared all their toils, faced all their dangers, and ate with\nthem the scraps of hide which they gnawed to keep the breath of\nlife in their shrunken bodies.",
        "Burr’s discipline was indeed very strict, so that at first raw\nrecruits rebelled against it. On one occasion the men of an\nuntrained company resented it so bitterly that they decided to\nshoot Colonel Burr as he paraded them for roll-call that evening.\nBurr somehow got word of it and contrived to have all the\ncartridges drawn from their muskets. When the time for the roll-\ncall came one of the malcontents leaped from the front line and\nleveled his weapon at Burr.",
        "“Now is the time, boys!” he shouted.",
        "Like lightning Burr’s sword flashed from its scabbard with such a\nvigorous stroke as to cut the man’s arm completely off and partly\nto cleave the musket.",
        "“Take your place in the ranks,” said Burr.",
        "The mutineer obeyed, dripping with blood. A month later every man\nin that company was devoted to his commander. They had learned\nthat discipline was the surest source of safety.",
        "But with this high spirit and readiness to fight Burr had a most\npleasing way of meeting every one who came to him. When he was\narrested in the Western forests, charged with high treason, the\nsound of his voice won from jury after jury verdicts of acquittal.\nOften the sheriffs would not arrest him. One grand jury not merely\nexonerated him from all public misdemeanors, but brought in a\nstrong presentment against the officers of the government for\nmolesting him.",
        "It was the same everywhere. Burr made friends and devoted allies\namong all sorts of men. During his stay in France, England,\nGermany, and Sweden he interested such men as Charles Lamb, Jeremy\nBentham, Sir Walter Scott, Goethe, and Heeren. They found his mind\nable to meet with theirs on equal terms. Burr, indeed, had\ngraduated as a youth with honors from Princeton, and had continued\nhis studies there after graduation, which was then a most unusual\nthing to do. But, of course, he learned most from his contact with\nmen and women of the world.",
        "Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, in The Minister’s Wooing, has given\nwhat is probably an exact likeness of Aaron Burr, with his\nbrilliant gifts and some of his defects. It is strong testimony to\nthe character of Burr that Mrs. Stowe set out to paint him as a\nvillain; but before she had written long she felt his fascination\nand made her readers, in their own despite, admirers of this\nremarkable man. There are many parallels, indeed, between him and\nNapoleon–in the quickness of his intellect, the ready use of his\nresources, and his power over men, while he was more than Napoleon\nin his delightful gift of conversation and the easy play of his\ncultured mind.",
        "Those who are full of charm are willing also to be charmed. All\nhis life Burr was abstemious in food and drink. His tastes were\nmost refined. It is difficult to believe that such a man could\nhave been an unmitigated profligate.",
        "In his twentieth year there seems to have begun the first of the\nromances that run through the story of his long career. Perhaps\none ought not to call it the first romance, for at eighteen, while\nhe was studying law at Litchfield, a girl, whose name has been\nsuppressed, made an open avowal of love for him. Almost at the\nsame time an heiress with a large fortune would have married him\nhad he been willing to accept her hand. But at this period he was\nonly a boy and did not take such things seriously.",
        "Two years later, after Burr had seen hard service at Quebec and on\nManhattan Island, his name was associated with that of a very\nbeautiful girl named Margaret Moncrieffe. She was the daughter of\na British major, but in some way she had been captured while\nwithin the American lines. Her captivity was regarded as little\nmore than a joke; but while she was thus a prisoner she saw a\ngreat deal of Burr. For several months they were comrades, after\nwhich General Putnam sent her with his compliments to her father.",
        "Margaret Moncrieffe had a most emotional nature. There can be no\ndoubt that she deeply loved the handsome young American officer,\nwhom she never saw again. It is doubtful how far their intimacy\nwas carried. Later she married a Mr. Coghlan. After reaching\nmiddle life she wrote of Burr in a way which shows that neither\nyears nor the obligations of marriage could make her forget that\nyoung soldier, whom she speaks of as “the conqueror of her soul.\"\nIn the rather florid style of those days the once youthful\nMargaret Moncrieffe expresses herself as follows:",
        "Oh, may these pages one day meet the eye of him who subdued my\nvirgin heart, whom the immutable, unerring laws of nature had\npointed out for my husband, but whose sacred decree the barbarous\ncustoms of society fatally violated!",
        "Commenting on this paragraph, Mr. H. C. Merwin justly remarks\nthat, whatever may have been Burr’s conduct toward Margaret\nMoncrieffe, the lady herself, who was the person chiefly\nconcerned, had no complaint to make of it. It certainly was no\nvery serious affair, since in the following year Burr met a lady\nwho, while she lived, was the only woman for whom he ever really\ncared.",
        "This was Theodosia Prevost, the wife of a major in the British\narmy. Burr met her first in 1777, while she was living with her\nsister in Westchester County. Burr’s command was fifteen miles\nacross the river, but distance and danger made no difference to\nhim. He used to mount a swift horse, inspect his sentinels and\noutposts, and then gallop to the Hudson, where a barge rowed by\nsix soldiers awaited him. The barge was well supplied with\nbuffalo-skins, upon which the horse was thrown with his legs\nbound, and then half an hour’s rowing brought them to the other\nside. There Burr resumed his horse, galloped to the house of Mrs.\nPrevost, and, after spending a few hours with her, returned in the\nsame way.",
        "Mrs. Prevost was by no means beautiful, but she had an\nattractiveness of her own. She was well educated and possessed\ncharming manners, with a disposition both gentle and affectionate.\nHer husband died soon after the beginning of the war, and then\nBurr married her. No more ideal family life could be conceived\nthan his, and the letters which passed between the two are full of\nadoration. Thus she wrote to him:",
        "Tell me, why do I grow every day more tenacious of your regard? Is\nit because each revolving day proves you more deserving?",
        "And thus Burr answered her:",
        "Continue to multiply your letters to me. They are all my solace.\nThe last six are constantly within my reach. I read them once a\nday at least. Write me all that I have asked, and a hundred things\nwhich I have not.",
        "When it is remembered that these letters were written after nine\nyears of marriage it is hard to believe all the evil things that\nhave been said of Burr.",
        "His wife died in 1794, and he then gave a double affection to his\ndaughter Theodosia, whose beauty and accomplishments were known\nthroughout the country. Burr took the greatest pains in her\neducation, and believed that she should be trained, as he had\nbeen, to be brave, industrious, and patient. He himself, who has\nbeen described as a voluptuary, delighted in the endurance of cold\nand heat and of severe labor.",
        "After his death one of his younger admirers was asked what Burr\nhad done for him. The reply was characteristic.",
        "“He made me iron,” was the answer.",
        "No father ever gave more attention to his daughter’s welfare. As\nto Theodosia’s studies he was very strict, making her read Greek\nand Latin every day, with drawing and music and history, in\naddition to French. Not long before her marriage to Joseph\nAllston, of South Carolina, Burr wrote to her:",
        "I really think, my dear Theo, that you will be very soon beyond\nall verbal criticism, and that my whole attention will be\npresently directed to the improvement of your style.",
        "Theodosia Burr married into a family of good old English stock,\nwhere riches were abundant, and high character was regarded as the\nbest of all possessions. Every one has heard of the mysterious\ntragedy which is associated with her history. In 1812, when her\nhusband had been elected Governor of his state, her only child–a\nsturdy boy of eleven–died, and Theodosia’s health was shattered\nby her sorrow. In the same year Burr returned from a sojourn in\nEurope, and his loving daughter embarked from Charleston on a\nschooner, the Patriot, to meet her father in New York. When Burr\narrived he was met by a letter which told him that his grandson\nwas dead and that Theodosia was coming to him.",
        "Weeks sped by, and no news was heard of the ill-fated Patriot. At\nlast it became evident that she must have gone down or in some\nother way have been lost. Burr and Governor Allston wrote to each\nother letter after letter, of which each one seems to surpass the\nagony of the other. At last all hope was given up. Governor\nAllston died soon after of a broken heart; but Burr, as became a\nStoic, acted otherwise.",
        "He concealed everything that reminded him of Theodosia. He never\nspoke of his lost daughter. His grief was too deep-seated and too\nterrible for speech. Only once did he ever allude to her, and this\nwas in a letter written to an afflicted friend, which contained\nthe words:",
        "Ever since the event which separated me from mankind I have been\nable neither to give nor to receive consolation.",
        "In time the crew of a pirate vessel was captured and sentenced to\nbe hanged. One of the men, who seemed to be less brutal than the\nrest, told how, in 1812, they had captured a schooner, and, after\ntheir usual practice, had compelled the passengers to walk the\nplank. All hesitated and showed cowardice, except only one–a\nbeautiful woman whose eyes were as bright and whose bearing was as\nunconcerned as if she were safe on shore. She quickly led the way,\nand, mounting the plank with a certain scorn of death, said to the\nothers:",
        "“Come, I will show you how to die.”",
        "It has always been supposed that this intrepid girl may have been\nTheodosia Allston. If so, she only acted as her father would have\ndone and in strict accordance with his teachings.",
        "This resolute courage, this stern joy in danger, this perfect\nequanimity, made Burr especially attractive to women, who love\ncourage, the more so when it is coupled with gentleness and\ngenerosity.",
        "Perhaps no man in our country has been so vehemently accused\nregarding his relations with the other sex. The most improbable\nstories were told about him, even by his friends. As to his\nenemies, they took boundless pains to paint him in the blackest\ncolors. According to them, no woman was safe from his intrigues.\nHe was a perfect devil in leading them astray and then casting\nthem aside.",
        "Thus one Matthew L. Davis, in whom Burr had confided as a friend,\nwrote of him long afterward a most unjust account–unjust because\nwe have proofs that it was false in the intensity of its abuse.\nDavis wrote:",
        "It is truly surprising how any individual could become so eminent\nas a soldier, as a statesman, and as a professional man who\ndevoted so much time to the other sex as was devoted by Colonel\nBurr. For more than half a century of his life they seemed to\nabsorb his whole thought. His intrigues were without number; the\nsacred bonds of friendship were unhesitatingly violated when they\noperated as barriers to the indulgence of his passions. In this\nparticular Burr appears to have been unfeeling and heartless.",
        "It is impossible to believe that the Spartan Burr, whose life was\none of incessant labor and whose kindliness toward every one was\nso well known, should have deserved a commentary like this. The\ncharge of immorality is so easily made and so difficult of\ndisproof that it has been flung promiscuously at all the great men\nof history, including, in our own country,",
        "Washington and Jefferson as well as Burr. In England, when\nGladstone was more than seventy years of age, he once stopped to\nask a question of a woman in the street. Within twenty-four hours\nthe London clubs were humming with a sort of demoniac glee over\nthe story that this aged and austere old gentleman was not above\nseeking common street amours.",
        "And so with Aaron Burr to a great extent. That he was a man of\nstrict morality it would be absurd to maintain. That he was a\nreckless and licentious profligate would be almost equally untrue.\nMr. H. O. Merwin has very truly said:",
        "Part of Burr’s reputation for profligacy was due, no doubt, to\nthat vanity respecting women of which Davis himself speaks. He\nnever refused to accept the parentage of a child.",
        "“Why do you allow this woman to saddle you with her child when you\nKNOW you are not the father of it?” said a friend to him a few\nmonths before his death.",
        "“Sir,” he replied, “when a lady does me the honor to name me the\nfather of her child I trust I shall always be too gallant to show\nmyself ungrateful for the favor.”",
        "There are two curious legends relating to Aaron Burr. They serve\nto show that his reputation became such that he could not enjoy\nthe society of a woman without having her regarded as his\nmistress.",
        "When he was United States Senator from New York he lived in\nPhiladelphia at the lodging-house of a Mrs. Payne, whose daughter,\nDorothy Todd, was the very youthful widow of an officer. This\nyoung woman was rather free in her manners, and Burr was very\nresponsive in his. At the time, however, nothing was thought of\nit; hut presently Burr brought to the house the serious and\nsomewhat pedantic James Madison and introduced him to the hoyden.",
        "Madison was then forty-seven years of age, a stranger to society,\nbut gradually rising to a prominent position in politics–\"the\ngreat little Madison,” as Burr rather lightly called him. Before\nvery long he had proposed marriage to the young widow. She\nhesitated, and some one referred the matter to President\nWashington. The Father of his Country answered in what was perhaps\nthe only opinion that he ever gave on the subject of matrimony. It\nis worth preserving because it shows that he had a sense of\nhumor:",
        "For my own part, I never did nor do I believe I ever shall give\nadvice to a woman who is setting out on a matrimonial voyage ... A\nwoman very rarely asks an opinion or seeks advice on such an\noccasion till her mind is wholly made up, and then it is with the\nhope and expectation of obtaining a sanction, and not that she\nmeans to be governed by your disapproval.",
        "Afterward when Dolly Madison with, her yellow turban and kittenish\nways was making a sensation in Washington society some one\nrecalled her old association with Burr. At once the story sprang\nto light that Burr had been her lover and that he had brought\nabout the match with Madison as an easy way of getting rid of her.",
        "There is another curious story which makes Martin Van Buren,\neighth President of the United States, to have been the\nillegitimate son of Aaron Burr. There is no earthly reason for\nbelieving this, except that Burr sometimes stopped overnight at\nthe tavern in Kinderhook which was kept by Van Buren’s putative\nfather, and that Van Buren in later life showed an astuteness\nequal to that of Aaron Burr himself, so that he was called by his\nopponents “the fox of Kinderhook.” But, as Van Buren was born in\nDecember of the same year (1782) in which Burr was married to\nTheodosia Prevost, the story is utterly improbable when we\nremember, as we must, the ardent affection which Burr showed his\nwife, not only before their marriage, but afterward until her\ndeath.",
        "Putting aside these purely spurious instances, as well as others\ncited by Mr. Parton, the fact remains that Aaron Burr, like Daniel\nWebster, found a great attraction in the society of women; that he\ncould please them and fascinate them to an extraordinary degree;\nand that during his later life he must be held quite culpable in\nthis respect. His love-making was ardent and rapid, as we shall\nafterward see in the case of his second marriage.",
        "Many other stories are told of him. For instance, it is said that\nhe once took a stage-coach from Jersey City to Philadelphia. The\nonly other occupant was a woman of high standing and one whose\nfamily deeply hated Aaron Burr. Nevertheless, so the story goes,\nbefore they had reached Newark she was absolutely swayed by his\ncharm of manner; and when the coach made its last stop before\nPhiladelphia she voluntarily became his mistress.",
        "It must also be said that, unlike those of Webster and Hamilton,\nhis intrigues were never carried on with women of the lower sort.\nThis may be held by some to deepen the charge against him; but\nmore truly does it exonerate him, since it really means that in\nmany cases these women of the world threw themselves at him and\nsought him as a lover, when otherwise he might never have thought\nof them.",
        "That he was not heartless and indifferent to those who had loved\nhim may be shown by the great care which he took to protect their\nnames and reputations. Thus, on the day before his duel with\nHamilton, he made a will in which he constituted his son-in-law as\nhis executor. At the same time he wrote a sealed letter to\nGovernor Allston in which he said:",
        "If you can pardon and indulge a folly, I would suggest that Mme. ––,\ntoo well known under the name of Leonora, has claims on my\nrecollection. She is now with her husband at Santiago, in Cuba.",
        "Another fact has been turned to his discredit. From many women, in\nthe course of his long life, he had received a great quantity of\nletters written by aristocratic hands on scented paper, and these\nletters he had never burned. Here again, perhaps, was shown the\nvanity of the man who loved love for its own sake. He kept all\nthese papers in a huge iron-clamped chest, and he instructed\nTheodosia in case he should die to burn every letter which might\ninjure any one.",
        "After Theodosia’s death Burr gave the same instructions to Matthew\nL. Davis, who did, indeed, burn them, though he made their\nexistence a means of blackening the character of Burr. He should\nhave destroyed them unopened, and should never have mentioned them\nin his memoirs of the man who trusted him as a friend.",
        "Such was Aaron Burr throughout a life which lasted for eighty\nyears. His last romance, at the age of seventy-eight, is worth\nnarrating because it has often been misunderstood.",
        "Mme. Jumel was a Rhode Island girl who at seventeen years of age\neloped with an English officer, Colonel Peter Croix. Her first\nhusband died while she was still quite young, and she then married\na French wine-merchant, Stephen Jumel, some twenty years her\nsenior, but a man of much vigor and intelligence. M. Jumel made a\nconsiderable fortune in New York, owning a small merchant fleet;\nand after Napoleon’s downfall he and his wife went to Paris, where\nshe made a great impression in the salons by her vivacity and wit\nand by her lavish expenditures.",
        "Losing, however, part of what she and her husband possessed, Mme.\nJumel returned to New York, bringing with her a great amount of\nfurniture and paintings, with which she decorated the historic\nhouse still standing in the upper part of Manhattan Island–a\nmansion held by her in her own right. She managed her estate with\nmuch ability; and in 1828 M. Jumel returned to live with her in\nwhat was in those days a splendid villa.",
        "Four years later, however, M. Jumel suffered an accident from\nwhich he died in a few days, leaving his wife still an attractive\nwoman and not very much past her prime. Soon after she had\noccasion to seek for legal advice, and for this purpose visited\nthe law-office of Aaron Burr. She had known him a good many years\nbefore; and, though he was now seventy-eight years of age, there\nwas no perceptible change in him. He was still courtly in manner,\ntactful, and deferential, while physically he was straight,\nactive, and vigorous.",
        "A little later she invited him to a formal banquet, where he\ndisplayed all his charms and shone to great advantage. When he was\nabout to lead her in to dinner, he said:",
        "“I give my hand, madam; my heart has long been yours.”",
        "These attentions he followed up with several other visits, and\nfinally proposed that she should marry him. Much fluttered and no\nless flattered, she uttered a sort of “No” which was not likely to\ndiscourage a man like Aaron Burr.",
        "“I shall come to you before very long,” he said, “accompanied by a\nclergyman; and then you will give me your hand because I want it.”",
        "This rapid sort of wooing was pleasantly embarrassing. The lady\nrather liked it; and so, on an afternoon when the sun was shining\nand the leaves were rustling in the breeze, Burr drove up to Mme.\nJumel’s mansion accompanied by Dr. Bogart–the very clergyman who\nhad married him to his first wife fifty years before.",
        "Mme. Jumel was now seriously disturbed, but her refusal was not a\nstrong one. There were reasons why she should accept the offer.\nThe great house was lonely. The management of her estate required\na man’s advice. Moreover, she was under the spell of Burr’s\nfascination. Therefore she arrayed herself in one of her most\nmagnificent Paris gowns; the members of her household and eight\nservants were called in and the ceremony was duly performed by Dr.\nBogart. A banquet followed. A dozen cobwebbed bottles of wine were\nbrought up from the cellar, and the marriage feast went on merrily\nuntil after midnight.",
        "This marriage was a singular one from many points of view. It was\nstrange that a man of seventy-eight should take by storm the\naffections of a woman so much younger than he–a woman of wealth\nand knowledge of the world. In the second place, it is odd that\nthere was still another woman–a mere girl–who was so infatuated\nwith Burr that when she was told of his marriage it nearly broke\nher heart. Finally, in the early part of that same year he had\nbeen accused of being the father of a new-born child, and in spite\nof his age every one believed the charge to be true. Here is a\ncase that it would be hard to parallel.",
        "The happiness of the newly married pair did not, however, last\nvery long. They made a wedding journey into Connecticut, of which\nstate Burr’s nephew was then Governor, and there Burr saw a\nmonster bridge over the Connecticut River, in which his wife had\nshares, though they brought her little income. He suggested that\nshe should transfer the investment, which, after all, was not a\nvery large one, and place it in a venture in Texas which looked\npromising. The speculation turned out to be a loss, however, and\nthis made Mrs. Burr extremely angry, the more so as she had reason\nto think that her ever-youthful husband had been engaged in\nflirting with the country girls near the Jumel mansion.",
        "She was a woman of high spirit and had at times a violent temper.\nOne day the post-master at what was then the village of Harlem\nwas surprised to see Mrs. Burr drive up before the post-office in\nan open carriage. He came out to ask what she desired, and was\nsurprised to find her in a violent temper and with an enormous\nhorse-pistol on each cushion at her side.",
        "“What do you wish, madam?” said he, rather mildly.",
        "“What do I wish?” she cried. “Let me get at that villain Aaron\nBurr!”",
        "Presently Burr seems to have succeeded in pacifying her; but in\nthe end they separated, though she afterward always spoke most\nkindly of him. When he died, only about a year later, she is said\nto have burst into a flood of tears–another tribute to the\nfascination which Aaron Burr exercised through all his checkered\nlife.",
        "It is difficult to come to any fixed opinion regarding the moral\ncharacter of Aaron Burr. As a soldier he was brave to the point of\nrecklessness. As a political leader he was almost the equal of\nJefferson and quite superior to Hamilton. As a man of the world he\nwas highly accomplished, polished in manner, charming in\nconversation. He made friends easily, and he forgave his enemies\nwith a broadmindedness that is unusual.",
        "On the other hand, in his political career there was a touch of\ninsincerity, and it can scarcely be denied that he used his charm\ntoo often to the injury of those women who could not resist his\ninsinuating ways and the caressing notes of his rich voice. But as\na husband, in his youth, he was devoted, affectionate, and loyal;\nwhile as a father he was little less than worshiped by the\ndaughter whom he reared so carefully.",
        "One of his biographers very truly says that no such wretch as Burr\nhas been declared to be could have won and held the love of such a\nwife and such a daughter as Burr had.",
        "When all the other witnesses have been heard, let the two\nTheodosias be summoned, and especially that daughter who showed\ntoward him an affectionate veneration unsurpassed by any recorded\nin history or romance. Such an advocate as Theodosia the younger\nmust avail in some degree, even though the culprit were brought\nbefore the bar of Heaven itself.",
