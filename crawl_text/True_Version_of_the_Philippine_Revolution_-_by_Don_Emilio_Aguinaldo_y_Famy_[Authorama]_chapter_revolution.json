        "To All Civilized Nations and Especially to the Great North American\nrepublic.",
        "I dedicate to you this modest work with a view to informing you\nrespecting the international events which have occurred during the\npast three years and are still going on in the Philippines, in order\nthat you may be fully acquainted with the facts and be thereby placed\nin a position to pronounce judgment upon the issue and be satisfied\nand assured of the Justice which forms the basis and is in fact the\nfoundation of our Cause. I place the simple truth respectfully before\nand dedicate it to you as an act of homage and as testimony of my\nadmiration for and recognition of the wide knowledge, the brilliant\nachievements and the great power of other nations, whom I salute,\nin the name the Philippine nation, with every effusion of my soul.",
        "The Author.",
        "Spain maintained control of the Philippine Islands for more than three\ncenturies and a half, during which period the tyranny, misconduct\nand abuses of the Friars and the Civil and Military Administration\nexhausted the patience of the natives and caused them to make a\ndesperate effort to shake off the unbearable galling yoke on the\n26th and 31st August, 1896, then commencing the revolution in the\nprovinces of Manila and Cavite.",
        "On these memorable days the people of Balintawak, Santa Mesa, Kalookan,\nKawit, Noveleta and San Francisco de Malabon rose against the Spaniards\nand proclaimed the Independence of the Philippines, and in the course\nof the next five days these uprisings were followed by the inhabitants\nof the other towns in Cavite province joining in the revolt against\nthe Spanish Government although there was no previous arrangement\nlooking to a general revolt. The latter were undoubtedly moved to\naction by the noble example of the former.",
        "With regard to the rising in the province of Cavite it should be stated\nthat although a call to arms bearing the signatures of Don Augustin\nRieta, Don Candido Firona and myself, who were Lieutenants of the\nRevolutionary Forces, was circulated there was no certainty about the\norders being obeyed, or even received by the people, for it happened\nthat one copy of the orders fell into the hands of a Spaniard named\nDon Fernando Parga, Military Governor of the province, who at that\ntime was exercising the functions of Civil Governor, who promptly\nreported its contents to the Captain-General of the Philippines,\nDon Ramon Blanco y Erenas. The latter at once issued orders for the\nSpanish troops to attack the revolutionary forces.",
        "It would appear beyond doubt that One whom eye of man hath not\nseen in his wisdom and mercy ordained that the emancipation of the\noppressed people of the Philippines should be undertaken at this time,\nfor otherwise it is inexplicable how men armed only with sticks and\ngulok [1] wholly unorganized and undisciplined, could defeat the\nSpanish Regulars in severe engagements at Bakoor, Imus and Noveleta\nand, in addition to making many of them prisoners, captured a large\nquantity of arms and ammunition. It was owing to this astonishing\nsuccess of the revolutionary troops that General Blanco quickly\nconcluded to endeavour, to maintain Spanish control by the adoption\nof a conciliatory policy under the pretext that thereby he could quel\nthe rebellion, his first act being a declaration to the effect that\nit was not the purpose of his Government to oppress the people and\nhe had no desire “to slaughter the Filipinos.”.",
        "The Government of Madrid disapproved of General Blanco’s new policy\nand speedily appointed Lieutenant-General Don Camilo Polavieja to\nsupersede him, and despatched forthwith a large number of Regulars\nto the Philippines.",
        "General Polavieja advanced against the revolutionary forces with\n16,000 men armed with Mausers, and one field battery. He had scarcely\nreconquered half of Cavite province when he resigned, owing to bad\nhealth. That was in April, 1897.",
        "Polavieja was succeeded by the veteran General Don Fernando Primo de\nRivera, who had seen much active service. As soon as Rivera had taken\nover command of the Forces he personally led his army in the assault\nupon and pursuit of the revolutionary forces, and so firmly, as well\nas humanely, was the campaign conducted that he soon reconquered the\nwhole of Cavite province and drove the insurgents into the mountains.",
        "Then I established my headquarters in the wild and unexplored mountain\nfastness of Biak-na-bató, where I formed the Republican Government\nof the Philippines at the end of May, 1897.",
        "Don Pedro Alejandro Paterno (who was appointed by the Spanish\nGovernor-General sole mediator in the discussion of the terms of\npeace) visited Biak-na-bató several times to negotiate terms of\nthe Treaty, which, after negotiations extending over five months,\nand careful consideration had been given to each clause, was finally\ncompleted and signed on the 14th December, 1897, the following being\nthe principal conditions:–",
        "(1) That I would, and any of my associates who desired to go with me,\nbe free to live in any foreign country. Having fixed upon Hongkong as\nmy place of residence, it was agreed that payment of the indemnity\nof $800,000 (Mexican) should be made in three installments, namely,\n$400,000 when all the arms in Biak-na-bató were delivered to the\nSpanish authorities; $200,000 when the arms surrendered amounted to\neight hundred stand; the final payment to be made when one thousand\nstand of arms shall have been handed over to the authorities and the\nTe Deum sung in the Cathedral in Manila as thanksgiving for the\nrestoration of peace. The latter part of February was fixed as the\nlimit of time wherein the surrender of arms should be completed.",
        "(2) The whole of the money was to be paid to me personally, leaving\nthe disposal of the money to my discretion and knowledge of the\nunderstanding with my associates and other insurgents.",
        "(3) Prior to evacuating Biak-na-bató the remainder of the insurgent\nforces under Captain-General Primo de Rivera should send to\nBiak-na-bató two General of the Spanish Army to be held as hostages by\nmy associates who remained there until I and a few of my compatriots\narrived in Hongkong and the first installment of the money payment\n(namely, four hundred thousand dollars) was paid to me.",
        "(4) It was also agreed that the religious corporations in the\nPhilippines be expelled and an autonomous system of government,\npolitical and administrative, be established, though by special\nrequest of General Primo de Rivera these conditions were not insisted\non in the drawing up of the Treaty, the General contending that such\nconcessions would subject the Spanish Government to severe criticism\nand even ridicule.",
        "General Primo de Rivera paid the first installment of $400,000 while\nthe two Generals were hold as hostages in Biak-na-bató.",
        "We, the revolutionaries, discharged our obligation to surrender our\narms, which were over 1,000 stand, as everybody knows, it having\nbeen published in the Manila newspapers. But the Captain General\nPrimo de Rivera failed to fulfill the agreement as faithfully as\nwe did. The other installments were never paid; the Friars were\nneither restricted in their acts of tyranny and oppression nor were\nany steps taken to expel them or secularize the religious Orders;\nthe reforms demanded were not inaugurated, though the Te Deumwas sung. This failure of the Spanish authorities to abide by the\nterms of the Treaty caused me and my companions much unhappiness,\nwhich quickly changed to exasperation when I received a letter from\nLieutenant-Colonel Don Miguel Primo de Rivera (nephew and private\nSecretary of the above-named General) informing me that I and my\ncompanions could never return to Manila.",
        "Was the procedure of this special representative of Spain just?",
        "But I and my companions were not to be kept long in our distress,\ngrieving over the bad faith of the Spaniards, for in the month of\nMarch of the year referred to (1898) some people came to me and in the\nname of the Commander of the U.S.S. Petrel asked for a conference\nin compliance with the wishes of Admiral Dewey.",
        "I had some interviews with the above-mentioned Commander, i.e.,\nduring the evening of the 16th March and 6th April, during which the\nCommander urged me to return to the Philippines to renew hostilities\nagainst the Spaniards with the object of gaining our independence,\nand he assured me of the assistance of the United States in the event\nof war between the United States and Spain.",
        "I then asked the Commander of the Petrel what the United States\ncould concede to the Filipinos. In reply he said: ’The United States\nis a great and rich nation and needs no colonies.”",
        "In view of this reply I suggested to the Commander the advisability\nof stating in writing what would be agreed to by the United States,\nand be replied that he would refer the matter to Admiral Dewey.",
        "In the midst of my negotiations with the Commander of the Petrel I\nwas interrupted by letters from Isabelo Artacho and his solicitors, on\nthe 5th April, claiming $200,000 of the money received from the Spanish\nauthorities, and asserting that he (Artacho) should receive this\nsum as salary due to him while acting as Secretary of the Interior,\nhe having been, it was alleged, a member of the Filipino Government\nestablished in Biak-na-bató. These letters contained the threat\nthat failure to comply with the demand of Artacho would result in\nhim bringing me before the Courts of Law in Hongkong. It may make the\nmatter clearer if I mention at this point that Isabelo Artacho arrived\nat Biak-na-bató and made himself known to and mixed with the officers\nin the revolutionary camp on the 21st day of September, 1897, and was\nappointed Secretary of the Interior in the early part of November of\nthat year, when the Treaty of Peace proposed and negotiated by Don\nPedro Alejandro Paterno was almost concluded, as is proved by the\nfact that the document was signed on the 14th of December of that year.",
        "In the light of these facts the unjust and unreasonable nature of\nthe claim of Artacho is easily discernable, for it is monstrous to\nclaim $200,000 for services rendered to the Revolutionary Government\nduring such a brief period.",
        "Moreover, it is a fact that it was agreed between ourselves (the\nleaders of the Revolution assembled in Biak-na-bató) that in the\nevent of the Spaniards failing to comply with each and every one of\nthe terms and conditions of the Agreement the money obtained from\nthe Spanish Government should not be divided, but must be employed in\nthe purchase of arms and ammunition to renew the war of independence.",
        "It is therefore evident that Artacho, in making this preposterous\ndemand, was acting as a spy for the enemy, as an agent of General Primo\nde Rivera, for he wanted to extinguish the rebellion by depriving its\norganizers and leaders of the most indispensable element, the “sinews\nof war,” which is money. This was the view, too, of the whole of my\ncolleagues, and it was resolved by us that I should leave Hongkong\nimmediately and thereby avoid the litigation which Artacho seemed\nbent upon and thereby afford my companions time and opportunity to\nremove this new and wholly unexpected barrier to the realization of\nour cherished plans for the emancipation of our beloved fatherland. I\nam profoundly pleased to say that they succeeded, Artacho withdrawing\nthe suit through a transaction.",
        "In accordance with the decision of the meeting above referred to, I\nleft Hongkong quietly on the 7th April, 1898, on board the steamship\nTaisany, and after calling at Saigon I reached Singapore as a\npassenger by the s.s. Eridan, landing there as secretly as possible\non the 21st April. I at once proceeded to the residence of one of\nmy countrymen.",
        "Thus is explained the cause of the interruption of the vitally\nimportant negotiations with Admiral Dewey, initiated by the Commander\nof the Petrel.",
        "But “Man proposes and God disposes” is a proverb which was verified\nin its fullest sense on this occasion, for, notwithstanding the\nprecautions taken in my journey to avoid identification yet at\n4 o’clock in the afternoon of the day I arrived at Singapore an\nEnglishman came to the house in which I was residing and in a cautious\nmanner stated that the United States Consul at that port, Mr. Spencer\nPratt, wished to have an interview with Don Emilio Aguinaldo. The\nvisitor was told that in that house they did not know Aguinaldo;\nthis being the prearranged answer for any callers.",
        "But the Englishman returned to the house several times and persisted\nin saying that it was no use trying to conceal the fact of Aguinaldo’s\narrival for Consul Pratt had received notice from Admiral Dewey of\nGeneral Aguinaldo’s journey to Singapore.",
        "In reply, the Consul said he would telegraph about this matter to\nAdmiral Dewey, who was, he said, Commander-in-Chief of the squadron\nwhich would invade the Philippines, and who had, he also stated,\nfull powers conferred on him by President McKinley.",
        "Between 10 or 12 in the forenoon of the next day the conference was\nrenewed and Mr. Pratt then informed me that the Admiral had sent him\na telegram in reply to the wish I had expressed for an agreement in\nwriting. He said the Admiral’s reply was–That the United States\nwould at least recognize the Independence of the Philippines under\nthe protection of the United States Navy. The Consul added that there\nwas no necessity for entering into a formal written agreement because\nthe word of the Admiral and of the United States Consul were in fact\nequivalent to the most solemn pledge that their verbal promises and\nassurance would be fulfilled to the letter and were not to be classed\nwith Spanish promises or Spanish ideas of a man’s word of honour. In\nconclusion the Consul said, “The Government of North America, is a\nvery honest, just, and powerful government._”",
        "Being informed of what had been said by the visitor I consented to\nmeet Consul Pratt, and had a strictly private interview with him\nbetween 9 and 12 p.m. on 22nd April, 1898, in one of the suburbs\nof Singapore. As soon as Mr. Pratt met me he said that war had been\nformally declared by the United States against Spain the day before,\ni.e., on the 21st April.",
        "In the course of the interview alluded to, Consul Pratt told me that as\nthe Spaniards had not fulfilled the promises made in the Biak-na-bató\nAgreement, the Filipinos had the right to continue the revolution\nwhich had been checked by the Biak-na-bató arrangement, and after\nurging me to resume hostilities against the Spaniards he assured\nme that the United States would grant much greater liberty and more\nmaterial benefits to the Filipinos than the Spaniards ever promised.",
        "I then asked the Consul what benefits the United States would confer\non the Philippines, pointing out at the same time the advisability\nof making an agreement and setting out all the terms and conditions\nin black and white.",
        "Being as anxious to be in the Philippines as Admiral Dewey and the\nNorth American Consul–to renew the struggle for our Independence–I\ntook the opportunity afforded me by these representatives of the United\nStates, and, placing the fullest confidence in their word of honour,\nI said to Mr. Pratt (in response to his persistent professions of\nsolicitude for the welfare of my countrymen) that he could count upon\nme when I returned to the Philippines to raise the people as one man\nagainst the Spaniards, with the one grand object in view as above\nmentioned, if I could take firearms with me to distribute amongst my\ncountrymen. I assured him that I would put forth my utmost endeavours\nto crush and extinguish the power of Spain in the islands and I added\nthat if in possession of one battery of a dozen field-guns I would\nmake the Spaniards surrender Manila in about two weeks.",
        "The Consul said he would help me to get over to the Philippines the\nconsignment of arms in respect of which I had made the preliminary\narrangements in Hongkong, and he added that he would at once telegraph\nto Admiral Dewey informing him of this promise in order that the\nAdmiral might give what assistance laid in his power to make the\nexpedition in question a success.",
        "On the 25th April the last conference was held in the United States\nConsulate at Singapore. I was invited by the Consul to meet him on\nthis occasion and as soon as we met he said he had received a telegram\nfrom the Admiral requesting him to ask me to proceed to Hongkong by\nfirst steamer to join the Admiral who was then with his squadron in\nMir’s Bay; a Chinese harbour close to Hongkong. I replied to this\nproposal in the affirmative, and gave directions to my aide-de-campto at once procure passages for myself and companions, care being\ntaken that the tickets should bear the assumed names we had adopted\non the occasion of our journey from Hongkong to Singapore, it being\nadvisable that we should continue to travel incognito.",
        "On the 26th April I called on Consul Pratt to bid him adieu on the eve\nof my departure from Singapore by the steamship Malacca. The Consul,\nafter telling me that when I got near the port of Hongkong I would\nbe met by the Admiral’s launch and taken from the Malacca to the\nAmerican squadron (a precaution against news of my movements becoming\npublic property, of which I highly approved), then asked me to appoint\nhim Representative of the Philippines in the United States, there to\nzealously advocate official recognition of our Independence. My answer\nwas, that I would propose him for the position of Representative of\nthe Philippines in the United States when the Philippine Government\nwas properly organized, though I thought it an insignificant reward\nfor his assistance, for, in the event of our Independence becoming\nun fait accompli I intended to offer him a high position in the\nCustoms Department, besides granting certain commercial advantages\nand contributing towards the cost of the war whatever sum he might\nconsider due to his Government; because the Filipinos had already\ndecided such a policy was the natural outcome of the exigencies of\nthe situation and could be construed only as a right and proper token\nof the nation’s gratitude.",
        "But to continue the statement of facts respecting my return to Hongkong\nfrom Singapore: I left Singapore with my A.D. Cs., Sres Pilar and\nLeyba, bound for Hongkong by the s.s. Malacca, arriving at Hongkong\nat 2 a.m. on the 1st May, without seeing or hearing anything of the\nlaunch which I had been led by Consul Pratt to expect to meet me near\nthe entrance of Hongkong harbour. In response to an invitation from\nMr. Rounsevelle Wildman, United States Consul at Hongkong, I wended\nmy way to the United States Consulate and between 9 and 11 p.m. of the\nsame day I had an interview with him. Mr. Wildman told me that Admiral\nDewey left for Manila hurriedly in accordance with imperative orders\nfrom his Government directing him to attack the Spanish Fleet. He\nwas therefore unable to await my arrival before weighing anchor and\ngoing forth to give battle to the Spaniards. Mr. Wildman added that\nAdmiral Dewey left word with him that he would send a gunboat to\ntake me across to the Philippines. In the course of this interview\nwith Mr. Wildman I spoke to him about the shipment of arms to the\nislands which I had previously planned with him, and it was then\nagreed among ourselves that he (Mr. Rounsevelle Wildman) and the\nFilipino Mr. Teodoro Sandico should complete the arrangements for\nthe despatch of the expedition, and I there and then handed to and\ndeposited with them the sum of $50,000.",
        "A steam launch was quickly purchased for $15,000, while a contract\nwas made and entered into for the purchase of 2,000 rifles at $7 each\nand 200,000 rounds of ammunition at $33 and 56/100 per 1000.",
        "A week later (7th May) the American despatch-boat McCulloch arrived\nfrom Manila bringing news of Admiral Dewey’s victory over the Spanish\nfleet, but did not bring orders to convey me to Manila. At 9 o’clock\nthat night I had another interview with Consul Wildman, at his request.",
        "On the 15th of the same month the McCulloch again arrived at\nHongkong from Manila, this time bringing orders to convey me and my\ncompanions to Manila. I was promptly notified of this by Consul Wildman\nwho requested that we go on board the McCulloch at 10 o’clock at\nnight on 16th May. Accompanied by Consul Wildman, the Captain of the\nMcCulloch, and Mr. John Barrett (who then usually styled himself\n\"ex-Secretary of the United States Legation in Siam”) we boarded an\nAmerican steam launch and proceeded to Chinese Kowloon Bay, where the\nMcCulloch was anchored. While bidding us adieu Mr. Barrett said he\nwould call on me in the Philippines, which he did later on in Cavite\nand Malolos.",
        "Mr. Wildman strongly advised me to establish a Dictatorship as soon\nas I arrived in the Philippines, and he assured me that he would use\nhis best endeavours to have the arms already contracted for delivered\nto me in the Philippines, which he in fact did. [It is to be observed,\nthough, that the first expedition having been conducted satisfactorily,\nthe arms reaching me in due course, I was naturally grateful and\nhad confidence in the sincerity and good faith of Consul Wildman,\nand there was nothing surprising therefore in the fact that I asked\nhim to fit out another expedition and caused the sum of $67,000 to\nbe deposited with him for that purpose. I regret to state, however,\nthat Mr. Wildman has failed to comply with my request and I am informed\nthat he refuses to refund the money.]",
        "The McCulloch left Hongkong at 11 a.m. on the 17th May and arrived\noff Cavite (Manila Bay) between noon and 1 p.m. on the 19th idem. No\nsooner had the McCulloch dropped anchor than the Admiral’s launch,\ncarrying his Adjutant and Private Secretary, came alongside to convey\nme the flagship Olympia, where I was received with my Adjutant\n(Sr. Leyba) with the honours due to a General.",
        "The Admiral ushered me into his private quarters, and after the\nexchange of the usual greetings I asked whether it was true that\nhe had sent all the telegrams to the Consul at Singapore, Mr. Pratt,\nwhich that gentleman had told me he received in regard to myself. The\nAdmiral replied in the affirmative, adding that the United States had\ncome to the Philippines to protect the natives and free them from\nthe yoke of Spain. He said, moreover, that America is exceedingly\nwell off as regards territory, revenue, and resources and therefore\nneeds no colonies, assuring me finally that there was no occasion\nfor me to entertain any doubts whatever about the recognition of the\nIndependence of the Philippines by the United States. Then Admiral\nDewey asked me if I could induce the people to rise against the\nSpaniards and make a short, sharp, and decisive campaign of it.",
        "I said in reply that events would speak for themselves, but while\na certain arms expedition (respecting which Consul Wildman was duly\ninformed that it would be despatched from a Chinese port) was delayed\nin China we could do nothing, because without arms every victory\nwould assuredly cost us the lives of many brave and dashing Filipino\nwarriors. The Admiral thereupon offered to despatch a steamer to hurry\nup the expedition. (This, be it borne in mind, in addition to the\nGeneral orders he had given the Consul to assist us to procure arms\nand ammunition.) Then he at once placed at my disposal all the guns\nseized onboard the Spanish warships as well as 62 Mausers and a good\nmany rounds of ammunition which had been brought up from Corregidor\nIsland by the U.S.S. Petrel.",
        "I then availed myself of an early opportunity to express to the\nAdmiral my deep gratitude for the assistance rendered to the people\nof the Philippines by the United States, as well as my unbounded\nadmiration of the grandeur and beneficence of the American people. I\nalso candidly informed the Admiral that before I left Hongkong the\nFilipinos residing in that colony hold a meeting at which the following\nquestion was fully discussed, namely, the possibility that after the\nSpaniards were defeated, and their power and prestige in the islands\ndestroyed, the Filipinos might have to wage war against the United\nStates owing to the American Government declining to recognize our\nindependence. In that event the Americans, it was generally agreed,\nwould be sure to defeat us for they would find us worn out and short\nof ammunition owing to our struggle with the Spaniards. I concluded\nby asking the gallant Admiral to excuse me for an amount of frankness\nthat night appear to border on impudence, and assured him of the\nfact that I was actuated only by a desire to have a perfectly clear\nunderstanding in the interest of both parties.\nThe Admiral said he was very glad to have this evidence of our\nearnestness and straightforwardness and he thought the Filipinos and\nAmericans should act towards one another as friends and allies, and\ntherefore it was right and proper that all doubts should be expressed\nfrankly in order that explanations be made, difficulties avoided,\nand distrust removed; adding that, as he had already indicated, the\nUnited States would unquestionably recognize the Independence of the\npeople of the Philippines, guaranteed as it was by the word of honour\nof Americans, which, he said, is more positive, more irrevocable than\nany written agreement, which might not be regarded as binding when\nthere is an intention or desire to repudiate it, as was the case in\nrespect of the compact made with the Spaniards at Biak-na-bató. Then\nthe Admiral advised me to at once have made a Filipino National\nFlag, which he said he would recognize and protect in the presence\nof the other nations represented by the various squadrons anchored\nin Manila Bay, adding, however, that he thought it advisable that we\nshould destroy the power of Spain before hoisting our national flag,\nin order that the act would appear more important and creditable in\nthe eyes of the world and of the United States in particular. Then\nwhen the Filipino vessels passed to and fro with the national flag\nfluttering in the breeze they would attract more attention and be\nmore likely to induce respect for the national colours.",
        "I again thanked the Admiral for his good advice and generous offers,\ngiving him to understand clearly that I was willing to sacrifice my\nown life if he would be thereby more exalted in the estimation of\nthe United States, more honoured by his fellow-countrymen.",
        "I added that under the present conditions of hearty co-operation,\ngood fellowship and a clear understanding the whole nation would\nrespond to the call to arms to shake off the yoke of Spain and obtain\ntheir freedom by destroying the power of Spain in all parts of the\narchipelago. If, however, all did not at once join in the movement\nthat should not cause surprise, for there would be many unable to\nassist owing to lack of arms and ammunition, while others, again,\nmight be reluctant to take an active part in the campaign on account\nof the loss and inconvenience to themselves and families that would\nresult, from open hostility to the Spaniards.",
        "Thus ended my first interview with Admiral Dewey, to whom I signified\nmy intention to reside for a while at the headquarters of the Naval\nCommandant of Cavite Arsenal.",
        "I returned to the McCulloch to give directions for the landing\nof the luggage and war materials which I brought over with me\nfrom Hongkong. On my way to the McCulloch I met several of my\nold associates in the 1896 revolution who had come over from Bataan\nprovince. To these friends I gave two letters directing the people\nof that province and Zambales to rise against the Spaniards and\nvigorously attack them.",
        "Before returning to the Arsenal and when near the landing place\nI came across several bancas [large open boats] loaded with\nrevolutionists of Kawit (my birth-place) who told me they had been\nlooking out for me for about two weeks, the Americans having announced\nthat I would soon return to the islands. The feeling of joy which\nI experienced on the occasion of this reunion with my own kith and\nkin–people who had stood shoulder to shoulder with me in the desperate\nstruggles of the 1896-97 revolution–is simply indescribable. Words\nfail to express my feelings–joy mingled with sadness and strong\ndetermination to accomplish the salvation, the emancipation, of my\nbeloved countrymen. Hardly had I set foot in the Naval Headquarters\nat Cavite, at 4 o’clock in the afternoon, than I availed myself of\nthe opportunity to give these faithful adherents orders similar to\nthose despatched to Bataan and Zambales.",
        "I was engaged the whole of that night with my companions drawing up\norders and circulars for the above mentioned purpose.",
        "We were also kept very busy replying to letters which were pouring\nin from all sides asking for news respecting the reported return of\nmyself to the islands and requesting definite instructions regarding\na renewal of hostilities against the Spaniards.",
        "That the invisible, albeit irresistible, hand of Providence was\nguiding every movement and beneficently favouring all efforts to rid\nthe country of the detestable foreign yoke is fairly evidenced by the\nrapid sequence of events above recorded, for in no other way can one\naccount for the wonderful celebrity with which news of my projected\nreturn spread far and wide.",
        "Sixty-two Volunteers, organized and armed by the Spaniards with\nMausers and Remingtons, from San Roque and Caridad, placed themselves\nunder my orders. At first the Americans apprehended some danger from\nthe presence of this armed force, which was promptly placed on guard\nat the entrance to the Arsenal. When I heard of this I went down and\ngave them orders to occupy Dalajican, thereby preventing the Spaniards\nfrom carrying out their intention to approach Cavite by that route.",
        "When the Americans were informed of what I had done they were\nreassured, and orders were given to the Captain of the Petrel to\nhand over to me the 62 rifles and ammunition which Admiral Dewey had\nkindly promised. About 10 a.m. the Petrel’s launch landed the arms\nand ammunition in question at the Arsenal and no time was lost in\ndistributing the arms among the men who were by this time coming in\never increasing numbers to offer their services to me and expressing\ntheir willingness to be armed and assigned for duty at the outposts\nand on the firing line.",
        "During the evening of the 20th May the old Revolutionary officer\nSr. Luciano San Miguel (now a General in command of a Brigade)\ncame to me and asked for orders, which were given to him to effect\nthe uprising of the provinces of Manila, Laguna, Batangas, Tayabas,\nBulakan, Morong, Pampanga, Tarlak, Newva Ecija and other northern\nprovinces. He left the same night to execute the orders.",
        "During the 21st, 22nd and 23rd and subsequent days of that month my\nheadquarters were simply besieged by my countrymen, who poured into\nCavite from all sides to offer their services in the impending struggle\nwith the Spaniards. To such an extent, indeed, were my quarters in the\nArsenal invaded that I soon found it necessary to repair to another\nhouse in the town, leaving the place entirely at the disposal of the\nU.S. Marines, who were then in charge of and guarding Cavite Arsenal.",
        "On the 24th May a Dictatorial Government was established, my\nfirst proclamation being issued that day announcing the system of\ngovernment then adopted and stating that I had assumed the duties\nand responsibilities of head of such government. Several copies of\nthis proclamation were delivered to Admiral Dewey and through the\nfavour of his good offices forwarded to the representatives of the\nForeign Powers then residing in Manila, notwithstanding our lack of\nintercourse with Manila.",
        "A few days later the Dictatorial Government was removed to the house\nformerly occupied by the Spanish Civil Governor of Cavite, because,\nowing to the great number of visitors from the provinces and the\nrapid increase of work the accommodation in the private house was\nwholly inadequate and too cramped. It was while quartered in the first\nmentioned house that glad tidings reached me of the arrival at Cavite\nof the long-expected arms expedition. The whole cargo, consisting of\n1,999 rifles and 200,000 rounds of ammunition, besides other special\nmunitions of war, was landed at the very same dock of the Arsenal,\nand was witnessed by the U.S.S. ’Petrel.”",
        "I immediately despatched a Commission to convey to the Admiral\nmy thanks for the trouble he had taken in sending to hurry up the\nexpedition. I also caused my Commissioners to inform the Admiral\nthat I had fixed the 31st May as the day when the Revolutionary\nForces should make a General attack upon the Spaniards. The Admiral\nreturned the compliment by sending his Secretary to congratulate\nme and my Government upon the activity and enthusiasm displayed in\npreparing for the campaign, but he suggested that it was advisable\nto postpone the opening of the campaign to a later date in order that\nthe insurgent troops might be better organized and better drilled. I\nreplied to the Admiral through his Secretary that there was no cause\nfor any anxiety for everything would be in perfect readiness by the\n31st and, moreover, that the Filipinos were very anxious to free\nthemselves from the galling Spanish yoke, that they would therefore\nfight and my troops would make up for any deficiency in discipline by\na display of fearlessness and determination to defeat the common enemy\nwhich would go far to ensure success, I was, I added, nevertheless\nprofoundly grateful to the Admiral for his friendly advice.",
        "I promptly gave orders for the distribution of the arms which had\njust arrived, sending some to various provinces and reserving the\nremainder for the revolutionaries of Kawit, the latter being smuggled\ninto the district of Alapang during the night of 27th May.",
        "The next day (8th May, 1898), just when we were distributing arms to\nthe revolutionists of Kawit, in the above mentioned district a column,\ncomposed of over 270 Spanish Naval Infantry, appeared in sight. They\nwere sent out by the Spanish General, Sr. Peña, for the purpose of\nseizing the said consignment of arms.",
        "Then it was that the first engagement of the Revolution of 1898 (which\nmay be rightly styled a continuation of the campaign of 1896-97) took\nplace. The battle raged from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., when the Spaniards ran\nout of ammunition and surrendered, with all their arms, to the Filipino\nRevolutionists, who took their prisoners to Cavite. In commemoration\nof this glorious achievement I hoisted our national flag in presence\nof a great crowd, who greeted it with tremendous applause and loud,\nspontaneous and prolonged cheers for “Independent Philippines” and for\n\"the generous nation\"–the United States of America. Several officers\nand Marines from the American fleet who witnessed the ceremony evinced\nsympathy with the Filipino cause by joining in the natural and popular\nrejoicings of the people.",
        "This glorious triumph was merely the prelude to a succession of\nbrilliant victories, and when the 31st May came–the date fixed for\ngeneral uprising of the whole of the Philippines–the people rose as\none man to crush the power of Spain.",
        "The second triumph was effected in Binakayan, at a place known as\nPolvorin, where the Spanish garrison consisting of about 250 men\nwas attacked by our raw levvies and surrendered in a few hours,\ntheir stock of ammunition being completely exhausted.",
        "I again availed myself of the opportunity to hoist our national flag\nand did so from an upper story of the Polvorin facing the sea,\nwith the object of causing the sacred insignia of our Liberty and\nIndependence to be seen fluttering in the breeze by the warships,\nrepresenting all the great and civilized nations of the world, which\nwere congregated in the harbour observing the providential evolution\ngoing on in the Philippines after upwards of three hundred years of\nSpanish domination.",
        "Scarcely had another hour elapsed before another flag was seen flying\nover the steeple of the Church at Bakoor–which is also in full view\nof vessels in the harbour–being the signal of another triumph of\nour troops over the Spanish forces which held that town. The garrison\nconsisted of about 300 men, who surrendered to the Revolutionary Army\nwhen their ammunition was exhausted.",
        "And so the Revolution progressed, triumph following triumph in quick\nsuccession, evidencing the power, resolution and ability of the\ninhabitants of the Philippines to rid themselves of any foreign yoke\nand exist as an independent State, as I affirmed to Admiral Dewey and\nin respect of which he and several American Commanders and officers\nwarmly congratulated me, specially mentioning the undeniable triumphs\nof the Philippine Army as demonstrated and proved by the great number\nof prisoners we brought into Cavite from all parts of Luzon.",
        "In conformity with my orders issued on the 1st of September, all\nPhilippine vessels hoisted the national flag, the Marines of the\nFilipino flotilla being the first to execute that order. Our little\nflotilla consisted of some eight Spanish steam launches (which had been\ncaptured) and five vessels of greater dimensions, namely, the Taaleño,\nBaldyan, Taal, Bulucan, and Purisima Concepcion. These vessels were\npresented to the Philippine Government by their native owners and were\nconverted by us, at our Arsenal, into gunboats, 8 and 9 centimetre\nguns, taken from the sunken Spanish warships, being mounted on board.",
        "Ah! what a beautiful, inspiring joyous sight that flag was fluttering\nin the breeze from the topmasts of our vessels, side by side,\nas it were, with the ensigns of other and greater nations, among\nwhose mighty warships our little cruisers passed to and fro dipping\ntheir colours, the ensign of Liberty and Independence! With what\nreverence and adoration it was viewed as it suddenly rose in its\nstately loneliness crowning our victories, and, as it were, smiling\napprovingly upon the undisciplined Philippine Army in the moment of\nits triumphs over the regular forces of the Spanish Government! One’s\nheart swells and throbs again with the emotions of extreme delight;\nthe soul is filled with pride, and the goal of patriotism seems\nwell-nigh reached in the midst of such a magnificent spectacle!",
        "At the end of June I called on Admiral Dewey, who, after complimenting\nme on the rapid triumphs of the Philippine Revolution, told me\nhe had been asked by the German and French Admirals why he allowed\nthe Filipinos to display on their vessels a flag that was not\nrecognized. Admiral Dewey said his reply to the French and German\nAdmirals was–with his knowledge and consent the Filipinos used that\nflag, and, apart from this, he was of opinion that in view of the\ncourage and steadfastness of purpose displayed in the war against\nthe Spaniards the Filipinos deserved the right to use their flag.",
        "I thereupon expressed to the Admiral my unbounded gratitude for such\nunequivocal protection, and on returning to the shore immediately\nordered the Philippine flotilla to convey troops to the other provinces\nof Luzon and to the Southern islands, to wage war against the Spaniards\nwho garrisoned them.",
        "The expedition to Bisayas was a complete success as far as the\nconveyance of our troops to the chief strategic points was concerned,\nour steamers returning safely to Cavite after landing the soldiers. The\nsteamer Bulusan, however, which sailed for Masbate with Colonel\nSr. Mariano Riego de Dios’ column destined for duty in Samar was\nsighted by the Spanish gunboats Elcano and Uranus, which gave\nchase, and the former proving the faster overtook and attacked the\nBulusan doing so much damage to her that she foundered after\na hot engagement in which considerable damage was done to the\nSpaniard. Happily the crew and troops on board of the Bulusansaved their lives by swimming ashore.",
        "In a few days the Spanish steamer Compania de Filipinas was\nbrought to Cavite by my countrymen, who captured her in the harbour\nof Aparri. Cannon were at once mounted on board this vessel and she\nwas loaded with troops and despatched for Olongapo, but she had not\ngone far before I sent another gunboat to recall her because Admiral\nDewey requested me to do so in order that a question raised by the\nFrench Consul might be duly settled. The Admiral having been informed\nthat when captured the Compania de Filipinas was flying the Spanish\nflag abstained from interfering in the matter and handed the French\nConsul’s protest over to me, affirming at the same time that he and\nhis forces were in no way concerned in the matter.",
        "This incident, which was soon settled, clearly demonstrates the\nrecognition of and protection extended to the Philippine Revolution\nby Admiral Dewey.",
        "The Filipinas (as this steamer has since been styled) was again\ndespatched to Olongapo and on her way back landed troops in the\nprovinces of Cagayan and the Batanes islands for the purpose of\nwresting the government of those districts from Spain. This steamer,\nwhose name has more recently been changed to Luzon, is at present\nashore in the Rio Grande, in Cagayan, where she was beached owing to\nsome damage to her machinery.",
        "When our steamers were leaving the harbour with troops for the\nprovinces they dipped their ensigns in passing Admiral Dewey’s\nflagship Olympia, performing this act in conformity with the rules\nof international courtesy, a demonstration of friendship that was\ninvariably promptly responded to in the usual way.",
        "The Dictatorial Government decided that the proclamation of\nIndependence should take place on the 12th June, the ceremony in\nconnection therewith to be held in the town of Kawit. With this\nobject in view I sent a Commission to inform the Admiral of the\narrangement and invite him to be present on the occasion of the\nformal proclamation of Independence, a ceremony which was solemnly\nand impressively conducted. The Admiral sent his Secretary to excuse\nhim from taking part in the proceedings, stating the day fixed for\nthe ceremony was mail day.",
        "About the end of that month (June) the Spanish gunboat Leyteescaped from the Macabebe river and reached Manila Bay, where she\nwas seized by General Torres’ troops. She had on board part of the\ntroops and volunteers which were under the command of the Filipino\nColonel Sr. Eugenio Blanco, but on being sighted by an American\ngunboat she voluntarily surrendered. Admiral Dewey delivered to me\nall the prisoners and arms on board the vessel, which latter, however,\nhe took possession of; but after the fall of Manila he demanded that\nI should give back the prisoners to him.",
        "On the 4th July the first United States military expedition arrived,\nunder command of General Anderson, and it was quartered in Cavite\nArsenal. This distinguished General called on me in the Filipino\nGovernment House at Cavite, an honour and courtesy which I promptly\nreturned, as was right and proper, seeing that we were friends,\nof equal rank, and allies. In the course of official intercourse\nGeneral Anderson solemnly and completely endorsed the promises made\nby Admiral Dewey to me, asserting on his word of honour that America\nhad not come to the Philippines to wage war against the natives nor\nto conquer and retain territory, but only to liberate the people from\nthe oppression of the Spanish Government.",
        "A few days before the arrival of this military expedition, and others\nthat followed under command of General Merritt, Admiral Dewey sent\nhis Secretary to my Government to ask me to grant permission for\nthe stationing of American troops in Tambo and Maytubig, Paranaque\nand Pasay. In view of the important promises of Admiral Dewey, above\nmentioned, the Dictatorial Government consented to the movement of\ntroops as proposed.",
        "During that month (July) Admiral Dewey accompanied by General\nAnderson visited Cavite, and after the usual exchange of courtesies\nhe said–\"You have had ocular demonstration and confirmation of all\nI have told you and promised you. How pretty your flag is! It has a\ntriangle, and is something like the Cubans’. Will you give me one as\na memento when I go back home?”",
        "I replied that I was fully satisfied with his word of honour and of\nthe needlessness of having our agreement in documentary form. As to\nthe flag he wanted, he could have one whenever he wished.",
        "The Admiral continued: Documents are useless when there is no sense\nof honour on one side, as was the case in respect of the compact\nwith the Spaniards, who failed to act up to what had been written and\nsigned. Have faith in my word, and I assure you that the United States\nwill recognize the independence of the country. But I recommend you to\nkeep a good deal of what we have said and agreed secret at present. I\nfurther request you to have patience if any of our soldiers insult\nany Filipinos, for being Volunteers they are as yet undisciplined.",
        "I replied that I would bear in mind all his advice regarding\ncautiousness, and that with respect to the misconduct of the soldiers\norders had already been issued enjoining forbearance, and I passed\nthe same remarks to the Admiral about unpleasantness possibly arising\nthrough lack of discipline of our own forces.",
        "At this juncture the Admiral suddenly changed the topic of conversation\nand asked–\"Why don’t the people in Manila rise against the Spaniards\nas their countrymen in the provinces have done? Is it true that they\naccept the autonomy offered by General Augustin with a representative\nAssembly? Is the report which has reached me true, that a Filipino\nCommission has been sent from Manila to propose to you the acceptance\nof that autonomy coupled with a recognition of your rank of General,\nas well as recognition of the rank held by your companions?”",
        "“The people of Manila,” I answered, “are quiet because they have\nno arms and because as merchants and landlords they fear that their\nvaluable properties and money in the banks will be confiscated by the\nSpaniards if they rise up and begin burning and destroying the property\nof others. On this account they had ostensibly accepted autonomy,\nnot because that was what they wanted but more as a means of deceiving\nthe Spaniards and being allowed to live in peace; but I am confident\nthat all the Filipinos in Manila are for independence, as will be\nproved the very day our troops capture Manila. At that time I fully\nexpect the people of Manila will join with us in raising loud cheers\nfor the Independence of the Philippines, making fresh demonstrations\nof loyalty to our Government.”",
        "I also told him it was true that a Mixed Commission had arrived and\nin the name of General Augustin and Archbishop Nozaleda made certain\nproposals; but they made known to us their intention to adhere to our\nCause. The members of the Commission said the Spaniards instructed them\nto say they came motu propio [2] without being formally appointed\nor ’coached’ by the Spanish authorities in what they should say,\nrepresenting, on the contrary, that they were faithful interpreters\nof the sentiment of the people of Manila and that they had good\nreason for believing that if I was willing to accept autonomyGeneral Augustin and Archbishop Nozaleda would recognize my rank\nof General, and that of my companions, would give me the $1,000,000\nindemnity agreed upon at Biak-na-bató and still unpaid, as well as\nliberal rewards for and salaries to the members of a popular Assembly\npromises which the Commissioners did not put any faith in, though some\nof them held the opinion that the money should be accepted because\nit would reduce the funds of the Spanish Government and also because\nthe money had been wrung from Filipinos. The Commissioners, I added,\nleft after assuring me that the people in Manila would rise against\nthe Spaniards if supplied with arms, and that the best thing I could\ndo was to make an attack on Manila at the places they pointed out as\nbeing the weakest parts of the Spanish defense and consequently the\neasiest to overcome.",
        "I thanked the Commission for their loyalty and straightforwardness,\ntold them they would be given an escort to take them safely back to\nthe Spanish lines, and that when they got back they should inform\nthose who had sent them that they were not received because they were\nnot duly accredited and that even if they had brought credentials\naccording to what they had seen and heard from the Revolutionists\nDon Emilio Aguinaldo would certainly not consider, much less accept,\ntheir proposals respecting autonomy because the Filipino people had\nsufficient experience to govern themselves, that they are tired of\nbeing victimised and subjected to gross abuses by a foreign nation\nunder whose domination they have no wish to continue to live, but\nrather wish for their independence. Therefore the Spaniards might\nprepare to defend their sovereignty, for the Filipino Army would\nvigorously assault the city and with unflagging zeal prosecute the\nsiege until Manila was captured.",
        "I also told the Commissioners to tell Archbishop Nozaleda that he was\nabusing the privileges and authority of his exalted position; that\nsuch conduct was at variance with the precepts of His Holiness the\nPope, and if he failed to rectify matters I would throw light on the\nsubject in a way which would bring shame and disgrace upon him. I added\nthat I knew he and General Augustin had commissioned four Germans and\nfive Frenchmen to disguise themselves and assassinate me in the vain\nhope that once I am disposed of the people of the Philippines would\ncalmly submit to the sovereignty of Spain, which was a great mistake,\nfor were I assassinated, the inhabitants of the Philippines would\nassuredly continue the struggle with greater vigor than ever. Other\nmen would come forward to avenge my death. Lastly I recommended\nthe Commissioners to tell the people in Manila to go on with their\ntrades and industries and be perfectly at ease about our Government,\nwhose actions were guided in the paths of rectitude and justice, and\nthat since there were no more Friars to corrupt the civic virtues,\nthe Filipino Government was now endeavouring to demonstrate its\nhonesty of purpose before the whole world. There was therefore no\nreason why they should not go on with their business as usual and\nshould not think of leaving Manila and coming into the Camp, where\nthe resources were limited, where already more were employed than was\nnecessary to meet the requirements of the Government and the Army,\nand where, too, the lack of arms was sorely felt.",
        "The Commissioners asked me what conditions the United States would\nimpose and what benefits they would confer on the Filipinos, to which\nI replied that is was difficult to answer that question in view of the\nsecret I was in honour bound to keep in respect of the terms of the\nAgreement, contenting myself by saying that they could learn a good\ndeal by carefully observing the acts, equivalent to the exercise of\nsovereign rights, of the Dictatorial Government, and especially the\noccular demonstrations of such rights on the waters of the harbour.",
        "These statements, which were translated by my interpreter, Sr. Leyba,\nmade such an impression on the Admiral that he interrupted,\nasking–\"Why did you reveal our secret?” Do you mean that you do not\nintend to keep inviolate our well understood silence and watchword?",
        "I said in reply that I had revealed nothing of the secret connected\nwith him and the Consul.",
        "The Admiral then thanked me for my cautiousness, bid we good-by and\nleft with General Anderson, after requesting me to refrain from\nassaulting Manila because, he said, they were studying a plan to\ntake the Walled City with their troops, leaving the suburbs for the\nFilipino forces.",
        "He advised me, nevertheless, to study other plans of taking the city\nin conjunction with their forces, which I agreed to do.",
        "A few days later American troops arrived, and with them came\nGeneral Merritt. The Admiral’s Secretary and two officers came to\nthe Dictatoriat Government and asked that we allow them to occupy our\ntrenches at Maytubig; from the harbour side of that place right up to\nthe main road, where they would form a continuation of our lines at\nPasay and Singalong. This I also agreed to on account of the solemn\npromises of the Admiral and the trust naturally placed in them owing\nto the assistance rendered and recognition of our independence.",
        "Ten days after the Americans occupied the trenches at Maytubig (this\nmove being well known by the Spaniards who were entrenched at the\nMagazine in San Antonio Abad) their outposts, composed of a few men\nonly, were surprised by the Spaniards, who made a night attack on\nthem. They had barely time to get out of their beds and fall back\non the centre, abandoning their rifles and six field-guns in their\nprecipitate retreat.",
        "The firing being distinctly heard, our troops immediately rushed to\nthe assistance of our friends and allies, repulsing the Spaniards and\nrecapturing the rifles and field-guns, which I ordered to be returned\nto the Americans as a token of our good-will and friendship.",
        "General Noriel was opposed to this restitution, alleging that the arms\ndid not belong to the Americans since the Filipino troops captured\nthem from the Spaniards. But I paid no attention to the reasonable\nopposition of my General and gave imperative instructions that they\nbe returned to the Americans, showing thereby clearly and positively\nthe good-will of the Filipinos. The said rifles and field-guns, with\na large quantity of ammunition, was therefore restored to those who\nwere then our allies, notwithstanding the fact of General Noriel’s\nbrigade capturing them at a cost of many lives of our compatriots.",
        "Later on more American reinforcements arrived and again Admiral Dewey,\nthrough his Secretary, asked for more trenches for their troops,\naverring that those which we had given up to them before were\ninsufficient. We at once agreed and their lines were then extended\nup to Pasay.",
        "The 13th August arrived, on which day I noticed a general advance\nof the American land and sea forces towards Manila, the former being\nunder command of General Anderson at Paranaque.",
        "Subsequently I ordered a general assault of the Spanish lines and\nin the course of this movement General Pio del Pilar succeeded in\nadvancing through Sampalok and attacked the Spanish troops who where\ndefending the Puente Colgante, [3] causing the enemy to fall back on\nthe Bridge of Spain. The column commanded by our General, Sr. Gregorio\nII. del Pilar, took the suburbs of Pretil, Tendo, Divisoria and Paseo\nde Azcarraga, situated north of Manila city; while General Noriel’s\ncommand, near Pasay, took the suburbs of Singalong and Pako, and\nfollowing the American column he out-flanked the Spaniards who were\ndefending San Antonio Abad. The Spanish officers observing General\nNoriel’s move ordered their men to retreat towards the Walled City,\nwhereupon the Americans who held the foremost trenches entered Malate\nand Ermita without firing a shot. At this point the Americans met\nGeneral Noriel’s troops who had captured the above mentioned suburbs\nand were quartered in the building formerly used by the Exposicion\nRegional de Filipinas, [4] in the Normal, and in Sr. Perez’ house\nin Paco.",
        "In Santa Ana (the eastern section of Manila) General Ricarto\nsuccessfully routed five companies of Spaniards, being aided in this\nby the manoeuvres of General Pio del Pilar’s brigade.",
        "Our troops saw the American forces landing on the sea shore near the\nLuneta and Paseo de Santa Lucia, calling the attention of everybody to\nthe fact that the Spanish soldiers in the city forts were not firing\non them (the Americans), a mystery that was cleared up at sunset\nwhen details of the capitulation of Manila, by General Jaudenes in\naccordance with terms of an agreement with General Merritt, became\npublic property–a capitulation which the American Generals reserved\nfor their own benefit and credit in contravention of the agreement\narrived at with Admiral Dewey in the arrangement of plans for the\nfinal combined assault on and capture of Manila by the allied forces,\nAmerican and Filipino.",
        "Some light was thrown upon this apparently inexplicable conduct of the\nAmerican Commanders by the telegrams which I received during that day\nfrom General Anderson, who wired me from Maitubig asking me to issue\norders forbidding our troops to enter Manila, a request which I did\nnot comply with because it was not in conformity with the agreement,\nand it was, moreover, diametrically opposed to the high ends of the\nRevolutionary Government, that after going to the trouble of besieging\nManila for two months and a half, sacrificing thousands of lives and\nmillions of material interests, it should be supposed such sacrifices\nwere made with any other object in view than the capture of Manila\nand the Spanish garrison which stubbornly defended the city.",
        "But General Merritt, persistent in his designs, begged me not only\nthrough the Admiral but also through Major Bell to withdraw my\ntroops from the suburbs to (as it was argued) prevent the danger\nof conflict which is always to be looked for in the event of dual\nmilitary occupation; also by so doing to avoid bringing ridicule upon\nthe American forces; offering, at the same time, in three letters,\nto negotiate after his wishes were complied with. To this I agreed,\nthough neither immediately nor at one time, but making our troops\nretire gradually up to the blockhouses in order that the whole of the\ninhabitants of Manila should witness the proceedings of our troops\nand amicability toward our American allies.",
        "Up to that time, and in fact right up to the time when the Americans\nopenly commenced hostilities against us, I entertained in my soul\nstrong hopes that the American Commanders would make absolute with\ntheir Government the verbal agreement made and entered into with the\nLeader of the Philippine Revolution, notwithstanding the indications\nto the contrary which were noticeable in their conduct, especially\nin respect of the conduct of Admiral Dewey, who, without any reason\nor justification, one day in the month of October seized all our\nsteamers and launches.",
        "Being informed of this strange proceeding, and at the time when the\nRevolutionary Government had its headquarters in Malolos, I despatched\na Commission to General Otis to discuss the matter with him. General\nOtis gave the Commissioners a letter of recommendation to the Admiral\nto whom he referred them; but the Admiral declined to receive the\nCommission notwithstanding General Otis’s recommendation.",
        "Notwithstanding the procedure of the American Commanders, so contrary\nto the spirit of all the compacts and antecedents above mentioned,\nI continued to maintain a friendly attitude towards them, sending\na Commission to General Merritt to bid him farewell on the eve of\nhis departure for Paris. In his acknowledgement of his courtesy\nGeneral Merritt was good enough to say that he would advocate the\nFilipino Cause in the United States. In the same manner I sent to\nAdmiral Dewey a punal [5] in a solid silver scabbard and a walking\nstick of the very best cane with gold handle engraved by the most\nskilful silversmiths as a souvenir and mark of our friendship. This\nthe Admiral accepted, thereby in some measure relieving my feelings\nand the anxiety of my compatriots constituting the Revolutionary\nGovernment, whose hearts were again filled with pleasant hopes of a\ncomplete understanding with Admiral Dewey.",
        "Vain indeed became these hope when news arrived that Admiral Dewey\nhad acted and was continuing to act against the Revolutionary\nGovernment by order of His Excellency Mr. McKinley, who, prompted\nby the “Imperialist” party, had decided to annex the Philippines,\ngranting, in all probability, concessions to adventurers to exploit\nthe immense natural wealth lying concealed under our virgin soil.",
        "This news was received in the Revolutionary camp like a thunderbolt out\nof a clear sky. Some cursed the hour and the day we treated verbally\nwith the Americans; some denounced the ceding of the suburbs, while\nothers again were of opinion that a Commission should be sent to\nGeneral Otis to draw from him clear and positive declarations on the\nsituation, drawing up a treaty of amity and commerce if the United\nStates recognize our independence or at once commence hostilities if\nthe States refused.",
        "In this crisis I advised moderation and prudence, for I still had\nconfidence in the justice and rectitude of United States Congress,\nwhich, I believed, would not approve the designs of the Imperialist\nparty and would give heed to the declarations of Admiral Dewey, who,\nin the capacity of an exalted Representative of the United States in\nthese Islands concerted and covenanted with me and the people of the\nPhilippines recognition of our independence.",
        "In fact in no other way was such a serious matter to be regarded,\nfor if America entrusted to Admiral Dewey the honour of her forces in\nsuch a distant region, surely the Filipinos might equally place their\ntrust in the word of honour of such a polished, chivalrous gentleman\nand brave sailor, in the firm belief, of course, that the great and\nnoble American people would neither reject his decision nor expose\nto ridicule the illustrious conqueror of the Spanish fleet.",
        "In the same way the not less known and notorious circumstances, that\nthe American Commanders who came soon after the echoes of the Admiral’s\nvictory reached their native shores, namely, Generals Merritt, Anderson\nand Otis, proclaimed to the people of the Philippines that America did\nnot come to conquer territories, but to liberate its inhabitants from\nthe oppression of Spanish Sovereignty. I would therefore also expose\nto universal ridicule and contempt the honour of these Commanders\nif the United States, by repudiating their official and public acts,\nattempts to annex these islands by conquest.",
        "With such prudent as well as well founded reflections, I succeeded\nin calming my companions shortly before the official news arrived\nreporting that the Washington Government, acting on Admiral Dewey’s\nsuggestion, had intimated its intention to despatch a Civil Commission\nto Manila which would treat with the Filipinos with a view to arriving\nat a definite understanding respecting the government of the Islands.",
        "Joy and satisfaction now filled the breasts of all the Revolutionists,\nand I thereupon set about the appointment of a Commission to meet the\nAmerican Commissioners. At the same time I gave strict orders that\nthe most friendly relations should be maintained with the Americans,\nenjoining toleration and overlooking of the abuses and atrocities\nof the soldiery because the effect on the Commissioners would not be\ngood it they found us at loggerheads with their nation’s forces.",
        "But the abases of the Americans were now becoming intolerable. In the\nmarket-place at Arroceros they killed a woman and a little boy under\nthe pretext that they were surprising a gambling den, thus causing the\ngreatest indignation of a great concourse of people in that vicinity.",
        "My Adjutants, too, who hold passes permitting them to enter Manila\nwith their uniform and sidearms, were molested by being repeatedly\nstopped by every patrol they met, it, being perfectly evident that,\nthe intention was to irritate them by exposing them to public ridicule.",
        "While this sort of thing was going on as against our people the\nAmerican Commanders and officers who visited our camp were treated\nwith the utmost courtesy and consideration.",
        "In Lacoste Street an American guard shot and killed a boy seven years\nof age for taking a banana from a Chinaman.",
        "The searching of houses was carried on just as it was during the\nSpanish regime, while the American soldiers at the outposts often\ninvaded our lines, thus irritating our sentries. It would make this\nbook a very large volume if I continued to state seriatim the abuses\nand atrocities committed by the American soldiery in those days of\ngeneral anxiety.",
        "It seemed as if the abuses were authorised or at least winked at\nin official quarters for the purpose of provoking an outbreak of\nhostilities. Excitement ran high among all classes of people, but the\nFilipino Government, which had assumed responsibility for the acts\nof the people, by the constant issue of prudent orders succeeded\nin calming the excited populace and maintained peace, advising all\nsufferers to be patient and prudent pending the arrival of the Civil\nCommission.",
        "At such a critical juncture as this, and before the anxiously-awaited\nCivil Commission arrived, it occurred to General Otis, Commandant of\nthe American forces, to commit two more impolitic acts. One of them\nwas the order to search our telegraph offices in Sagunro Street, in\nTondo, where the searching party seized the apparatus and detained\nthe officer in charge, Sr. Reyna, in the Fuerza Santiago [6] under\nthe pretext that he was conspiring against the Americans.",
        "How and why was Sr. Reyna conspiring? Was not this sufficient for\nthe Filipino Government to give the order to attack and rescue Reyna\nand thereby we (eight thousand strong) be plunged immediately into\nwar with the United States? Was there any reason for conspiring when\nthe power was in our own hands? And, above all, would a telegraphist,\nbe likely to interfere in affaires de guerre when there was an army\nnear by to attend to such matters?",
        "It was abundantly manifest that the object was by wounding the feelings\nof and belittling the Filipino Government to provoke a collision, and\nit was clear also that this system of exasperating us was not merely\nthe wanton act of the soldiery but was actually prompted by General\nOtis himself, who, imbued with imperialistic tendencies, regarded the\ncoming of the Civil Commission with disfavour and especially would it\nbe unsatisfactory that this Commission should find the Philippines in\na state of perfect tranquility, because it was evident to the said\nGeneral, as well as to the whole world, that the Filipinos would\nassuredly have arrived at a definite amicable agreement with the\naforesaid Commission if it reached the islands while peace prevailed.",
        "We, the Filipinos, would have received the Commission with open\narms and complete accord as honourable Agents of the great American\nnation. The Commissioners could have visited all our provinces,\nseeing and taking note of the complete tranquility throughout our\nterritory. They could have seen our cultivated lands, examined our\nConstitution and investigated the administration of public affairs in\nperfect peace and safety, and have felt and enjoyed the inimitable\ncharm of our Oriental style,–half negligent, half solicitude,\nwarmth and chilliness, simple confidence and suspiciousness;\ncharacteristics which cause descriptions of contact with us to be\ndepicted by foreigners in thousands of different hues.",
        "Ah! but neither did General Otis nor the Imperialists wish for\nsuch a landscape. It was better for their criminal designs that\nthe American Commission should view the desolation and horrors of\nwar in the Philippines, inhaling on the very day of their arrival\nthe revolting odour emitted from American and Filipino corpses. It\nwas better for their purposes that that gentleman, Mr. Schurman,\nPresident of the Commission, should return from Manila, limiting\nhis investigation to inquiries among the few Filipinos, who, seduced\nwith gold, were siding with the Imperialists. It were better for them\nthat the Commission should view the Philippines problem through fire\nand slaughter, in the midst of whizzing bullets and the uncontrolled\npassion of infuriated foes, thus preventing them from forming correct\njudgment of the exact and natural conditions of the problem. Ah! it\nwas, lastly, better that the Commission return to the States defeated\nin its mission of obtaining peace and blaming me and other Filipinos\nfor its inability to settle matters, when, in reality, I and all the\nPhilippine people were longing that that peace had been concluded\nyesterday,–long before now–but an honest and honourable peace,\nhonourable alike for the United States and the Philippine Republic\nin order that it be sincere and everlasting.",
        "The second impolitic act of General Otis was the issue of a\nproclamation on the 4th of January, 1899, asserting in the name\nof President McKinley the sovereignty of America in these islands,\nwith threats of ruin, death and desolation to all who declined to\nrecognize it.",
        "I, Emilio Aguinaldo–though the humble servant of all, am, as\nPresident of the Philippine Republic, charged with the safeguarding\nof the rights and independence of the people who appointed me to such\nan exalted position of trust and responsibility–mistrusted for the\nfirst time the honour of the Americans, perceiving of course that\nthis proclamation of General Otis completely exceeded the limits of\nprudence and that therefore no other course was open to me but to\nrepel with arms such unjust and unexpected procedure on the part of\nthe commander of friendly forces.",
        "I protested, therefore, against such a proclamation–also threatening\nan immediate rupture of friendly relations,–for the whole populace was\nclaiming that an act of treason had been committed, plausibly asserting\nthat the announcement of the Commission applied for by Admiral Dewey\nwas a ruse, and that what General Otis was scheming for was to keep\nus quiet while he brought reinforcement after reinforcement from the\nUnited States for the purpose of crashing our untrained and badly\nequipped Army with one blow.",
        "But now General Otis acted for the first time like a diplomatist,\nand wrote me, through his Secretary, Mr. Carman, a letter inviting the\nFilipino Government to send a Commission to meet an American Commission\nfor the purpose of arriving at an amicable arrangement between both\nparties; and although I placed no trust in the professions of friendly\nintentions of the said General–whose determination to prevent the\nCommission arriving at a peaceful solution of the difficulties was\nalready evident–I acceded to the request, partly because I saw\nthe order, dated 9th January, given by the above mentioned General\nconfirmed, and on the other hand to show before the whole world my\nmanifest wishes for the conservation of peace and friendship with\nthe United States, solemnly compacted with Admiral Dewey.",
        "Conferences of the Mixed Commission, Americans and Filipinos, were\nheld in Manila from the 11th to the 31st of the said month of January,\nthe Filipino Commissioners clearly expressing the wish of our people\nfor recognition as an independent nation.",
        "They also frankly stated the complaints of the Filipino people about\nthe abuses and atrocities of the American soldiery, being attentively\nand benevolently listened to by the American Commissioners. The\nlatter replied that they had no authority to recognize the Filipino\nGovernment, their mission being limited to hearing what the Filipinos\nsaid, to collect data to formulate the will of our people and\ntransmit it fully and faithfully to the Government of Washington,\nwho alone could arrive at a definite decision on the subject. These\nconferences ended in perfect harmony, auguring well for happier times\nand definite peace when Mr. McKinley should reply to General Otis’s\ntelegrams transmitting our wishes with his favourable recommendations,\nas the American Commissioners said.",
        "While I, the Government, the Congress and the entire populace were\nawaiting the arrival of such a greatly desired reply, many fairly\noverflowing with pleasant thoughts, there came the fatal day of\nthe 4th February, during the night of which day the American forces\nsuddenly attacked all our lines, which were in fact at the time almost\ndeserted, because being Saturday, the day before a regular feast day,\nour Generals and some of the most prominent officers had obtained\nleave to pass the Sabbath with their respective families.",
        "General Pantaleon Garcia was the only one who at such a critical\nmoment was at his post in Maypajo, north of Manila, Generals Noriel,\nRizal and Ricarte and Colonels San Miguel, Cailles and others being\naway enjoying their leave.",
        "General Otis, according to trustworthy information, telegraphed to\nWashington stating that the Filipinos had attacked the American\nArmy. President McKinley read aloud the telegram in the Senate,\nwhere the Treaty of Paris of the 10th December, 1898, was being\ndiscussed with a view to its ratification, the question of annexation\nof the Philippines being the chief subject of debate, and through\nthis criminal procedure secured the acceptation of the said Treaty\nin toto by a majority of only three votes, [7] which were cast\nsimultaneously with a declaration that the voters sided with the\n\"Ayes” on account of war having broken out in these Islands.",
        "This singular comedy could not continue for a great length of time\nbecause the Filipinos could never be the aggressors as against the\nAmerican forces, with whom we had sworn eternal friendship and in\nwhose power we expected to find the necessary protection to enable\nus to obtain recognition of our independence from the other Powers.",
        "The confusion and obfuscation of the first moments was indeed great,\nbut before long it gave place to the light of Truth which shone forth\nserene, bringing forth serious reflections.",
        "When sensible people studied the acts of Mr. McKinley, sending\nreinforcement after reinforcement to Manila at a time after an\narmistice was agreed upon and even when peace with Spain prevailed;\nwhen they took into account that the despatch of the Civil Commission\nto settle terms of a treaty of amity with the Filipinos was being\ndelayed; when, too, they knew of the antecedents of my alliance\nwith Admiral Dewey, prepared and arranged by the American Consuls of\nSingapore and Hongkong, Mr. Pratt and Mr. Wildman; when they became\nacquainted with the actual state of affairs on the 4th February knowing\nthat the Filipinos were awaiting the reply of Mr. McKinley to the\ntelegram of General Otis in which he transmitted the peaceful wish of\nthe Filipino people of live as an independent nation; when, lastly,\nthey riveted their attention to the terms of the Treaty of Paris,\nthe approval of which, in as far as it concerned the annexation of the\nPhilippines, was greeted with manifestations of joy and satisfaction\nby the Imperialist party led by Mr. McKinley, then their eyes were\nopened to the revelations of truth, clearly perceiving the base,\nselfish and inhuman policy which Mr. McKinley had followed in his\ndealings with us the Filipinos, sacrificing remorselessly to their\nunbridled ambition the honour of Admiral Dewey, exposing this worthy\ngentleman and illustrious conqueror of the Spanish fleet to universal\nridicule; for no other deduction can follow from the fact that about\nthe middle of May of 1898, the U.S.S. McCulloch brought me with\nmy revolutionary companions from Hongkong, by order of the above\nmentioned Admiral, while now actually the United States squadron is\nengaged in bombarding the towns and ports held by these revolutionists,\nwhose objective is and always has been Liberty and Independence.",
        "The facts as stated are of recent date and must still be fresh in\nthe memory of all.",
        "Those who in May, 1898, admired the courage of Admiral Dewey’s sailors\nand the humanitarianism of this illustrious Commander in granting\nvisible aid to an oppressed people to obtain freedom and independence,\nsurely cannot place an honest construction upon the present inhuman\nwar when contrasting it with those lofty and worthy sentiments.",
        "I need not dwell on the cruelty which, from the time of the\ncommencement of hostilities, has characterized General Otis’s\ntreatment of the Filipinos, shooting in secret many who declined\nto sign a petition asking for autonomy. I need not recapitulate the\nruffianly abuses which the American soldiers committed on innocent\nand defenseless people in Manila, shooting women and children simply\nbecause they were leaning out of windows; entering houses at midnight\nwithout the occupants’ permission–forcing open trunks and wardrobes\nand stealing money, jewellery and all valuables they came across;\nbreaking chairs, tables and mirrors which they could not carry away\nwith them, because, anyhow, they are consequences of the war, though\nimproper in the case of civilized forces. But what I would not leave\nunmentioned is the inhuman conduct of that General in his dealings\nwith the Filipino Army, when, to arrange a treaty of peace with the\nCivil Commission, of which Mr. Schurman was President, I thrice sent\nemissaries asking for a cessation of hostilities.",
        "General Otis refused the envoys’ fair and reasonable request, replying\nthat he would not stop hostilities so long as the Philippine Army\ndeclined to lay down their arms.",
        "But why does not this Army deserve some consideration at the hands\nof General Otis and the American forces? Had they already forgotten\nthe important service the Filipino Army rendered to the Americans in\nthe late war with Spain?",
        "Had General Otis forgotten the favours conferred on him by the Filipino\nArmy, giving up to him and his Army the suburbs and blockhouses which\nat such great sacrifice to themselves the Filipinos had occupied?",
        "Why should General Otis make such a humiliating condition a prime\nfactor or basis of terms of peace with an Army which stood shoulder to\nshoulder with the American forces, freely shedding its blood, and whose\nheroism and courage were extolled by Admiral Dewey and other Americans?",
        "This unexplained conduct of General Otis, so manifestly contrary\nto the canons of international law and military honour, is eloquent\ntestimony of his deliberate intention to neutralize the effects of\nMr. Schurman’s pacific mission.",
        "What peace can be concerted by the roaring of cannon and the whizzing\nof bullets?",
        "What is and has been the course of procedure of General Brooke in\nCuba? Are not the Cubans still armed, notwithstanding negotiations\nfor the pacification and future government of that Island are still\ngoing on?",
        "Are we, perchance, less deserving of liberty and independence than\nthose revolutionists?",
        "Oh, dear Philippines! Blame your wealth, your beauty for the stupendous\ndisgrace that rests upon your faithful sons.",
        "You have aroused the ambition of the Imperialists and Expansionists\nof North America and both have placed their sharp claws upon your\nentrails!",
        "Loved mother, sweet mother, we are here to defend your liberty and\nindependence to the death! We do not want war; on the contrary, we\nwish for peace; but honourable peace, which does not make you blush\nnor stain your forehead with shame and confusion. And we swear to you\nand promise that while America with all her power and wealth could\npossibly vanquish us; killing all of us; but enslave us, never!!!",
        "No; this humiliation is not the compact I celebrated in Singapore with\nthe American Consul Pratt. This was not the agreement stipulated for\nwith Mr. Wildman, American Consul in Hongkong. Finally, it was not\nthe subjection of my beloved country to a new alien yoke that Admiral\nDewey promised me.",
        "It is certain that these three have abandoned me, forgetting that I\nwas sought for and taken from my exile and deportation; forgetting,\nalso, that neither of these three solicited my services in behalf\nof American Sovereignty, they paying the expense of the Philippine\nRevolution for which, manifestly, they sought me and brought me back\nto your beloved bosom!",
        "If there is, as I believe, one God, the root and fountain of all\njustice and only eternal judge of international disputes, it will not\ntake long, dear mother, to save you from the hands, of your unjust\nenemies. So I trust in the honour of Admiral Dewey: So I trust in\nthe rectitude of the great people of the United States of America,\nwhere, if there are ambitious Imperialists, there are defenders of the\nhumane doctrines of the immortal Monroe, Franklin, and Washington;\nunless the race of noble citizens, glorious founders of the present\ngreatness of the North American Republic, have so degenerated that\ntheir benevolent influence has become subservient to the grasping\nambition of the Expansionists, in which latter unfortunate circumstance\nwould not death be preferable to bondage?",
        "Oh, sensible American people! Deep is the admiration of all the\nPhilippine people and of their untrained Army of the courage displayed\nby your Commanders and soldiers. We are weak in comparison with\nsuch Titanic instruments of your Government’s ambitious Caesarian\npolicy and find it difficult to effectively resist their courageous\nonslaught. Limited are our warlike resources, but we will continue this\nunjust, bloody, and unequal struggle, not for the love of war–which\nwe abhor–but to defend our incontrovertible rights of Liberty and\nIndependence (so dearly won in war with Spain) and our territory\nwhich is threatened by the ambitions of a party that is trying to\nsubjugate us.",
        "Distressing, indeed, is war! Its ravages cause us horror. Luckless\nFilipinos succumb in the confusion of combat, leaving behind them\nmothers, widows and children. America could put up with all the\nmisfortunes she brings on us without discomfort; but what the North\nAmerican people are not agreeable to is that she should continue\nsacrificing her sons, causing distress and anguish to mothers,\nwidows and daughters to satisfy the whim of maintaining a war\nin contravention of their honourable traditions as enunciated by\nWashington and Jefferson.",
        "Go back, therefore, North American people, to your old-time\nliberty. Put your hand on your heart and tell me: Would it be pleasant\nfor you if, in the course of time, North America should find herself in\nthe pitiful plight, of a weak and oppressed people and the Philippines,\na free and powerful nation, then at war with your oppressors, asked\nfor your aid promising to deliver you from such a weighty yoke, and\nafter defeating her enemy with your aid she set about subjugating you,\nrefusing the promised liberation?",
        "Civilized nations! Honourable inhabitants of the United States, to\nwhose high and estimable consideration I submit this unpretentious\nwork, herein you have the providential facts which led to the unjust\nattack upon the existence of the Philippine Republic and the existence\nof those for whom, though unworthy, God made me the principal guardian.",
        "The veracity of these facts rests upon my word as President of this\nRepublic and on the honour of the whole population of eight million\nsouls, who, for more than three hundred years have been sacrificing\nthe lives and wealth of their brave sons to obtain due recognition\nof the natural rights of mankind–liberty and independence.",
        "If you will do me the honour to receive and read this work and then\npass judgment impartially solemnly declaring on which side right and\njustice rests, your respectful servant will be eternally grateful.",
