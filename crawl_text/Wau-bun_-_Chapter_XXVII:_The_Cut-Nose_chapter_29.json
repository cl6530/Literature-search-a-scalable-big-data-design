        "Among the women of the tribe with whom we early became acquainted, our\ngreatest favorite was a daughter of one of the Day-kau-rays. This\nfamily, as I have elsewhere said, boasted in some remote generation a\ncross of the French blood, and this fact might account for the fair\ncomplexion and soft curling hair which distinguished our friend. She had\na noble forehead, full, expressive eyes, and fine teeth. Unlike the\nwomen of her people, she had not grown brown and haggard with advancing\nyears. Indeed, with the exception of one feature, she might be called\nbeautiful.",
        "She had many years before married a Mus-qua-kee, or Fox Indian, and,\naccording to the custom among all the tribes, the husband came home to\nthe wife’s family, and lived among the Winnebagoes.",
        "It is this custom, so exactly the reverse of civilized ways, that makes\nthe birth of a daughter a subject of peculiar rejoicing in an Indian\nfamily. “She will bring another hunter to our lodge,” is the style of\nmutual congratulation.",
        "The Mus-qua-kee continued, for some few years, to live among his wife’s\nrelations; but, as no children blessed their union, he at length became\ntired of his new friends, and longed to return to his own people. He\ntried, for a time, to persuade his wife to leave her home, and accompany\nhim to the Mississippi, on the banks of which the Sauks and Foxes lived,\nbut in vain. She could not resolve to make the sacrifice.",
        "One day, after many fruitless efforts to persuade her, he flew into a\nviolent passion.",
        "“Then, if you will not go with me,” said he, “I will leave you; but you\nshall never be the wife of any other man–I will mark you!”",
        "Saying this, he flew upon her, and bit off the end of her nose. This,\nthe usual punishment for conjugal infidelity, is the greatest disgrace a\nwoman can receive–it bars her forever from again entering the pale of\nmatrimony. The wretch fled to his own people; but his revenge fell short\nof its aim. Day-kau-ray was too well known and too universally respected\nto suffer opprobrium in any member of his family. This bright, loving\ncreature in particular, won all hearts upon a first acquaintance–she\ncertainly did ours, from the outset.",
        "She suffered much from rheumatism, and a remedy we gave her soon\nafforded her almost entire relief. Her gratitude knew no bounds.\nNotwithstanding that from long suffering she had become partially\ncrippled, she would walk all the way from the Barribault, a distance of\nten miles, as often as once in two or three weeks, to visit us. Then, to\nsit and gaze at us, to laugh with childish glee at everything new or\nstrange that we employed ourselves about–to pat and stroke us every\ntime we came near her–sometimes to raise our hand or arm and kiss\nit–these were her demonstrations of affection. And we loved her in\nreturn. It was always a joyful announcement when, looking out over the\nPortage road, somebody called out, “The Cut-Nose is coming!” In time,\nhowever, we learned to call her by her baptismal name of Elizabeth, for\nshe, too, was one of Mr. Mazzuchelli’s converts.",
        "She came one day, accompanied by a half-grown boy, carrying a young fawn\nshe had brought me as a present. I was delighted with the pretty\ncreature–with its soft eyes and dappled coat; but having often heard\nthe simile, “as wild as a fawn,” I did not anticipate much success in\ntaming it. To my great surprise, it soon learned to follow me like a\ndog. Wherever I went, there Fan was sure to be. At breakfast, she would\nlie down at my feet, under the table. One of her first tokens of\naffection was to gnaw off all the trimming from my black silk apron, as\nshe lay pretending to caress and fondle me. Nor was this her only style\nof mischief.",
        "One day we heard a great rattling among the crockery in the kitchen. We\nran to see what was the matter, and found that Miss Fan had made her way\nto a shelf of the dresser, about two feet from the ground, and was\nendeavoring to find a comfortable place to lie down, among the plates\nand dishes. I soon observed that it was the shelter of the shelf above\nher head that was the great attraction, and that she was in the habit of\nseeking out a place of repose under a chair, or something approaching to\nan “umbrageous bower.” So after this I took care, as the hour for her\nmorning nap approached, to open a large green parasol, and set it on the\nmatting in the corner–then when I called “Fan, Fan,” she would come and\nnestle under it, and soon fall fast asleep.",
        "One morning Fan was missing. In vain we called and sought her in the\ngarden–in the enclosure for the cattle–at the houses of the\nFrenchmen–along the hill towards Paquette’s–no Fan was to be found. We\nthought she had asserted her own wild nature and sped away to the woods.",
        "It was a hot forenoon, and the doors were all open. About dinner-time,\nin rushed Fan, panting violently, and threw herself upon her side, where\nshe lay with her feet outstretched, her mouth foaming, and exhibiting\nall the signs of mortal agony. We tried to give her water, to soothe\nher, if perhaps it might be fright that so affected her; but in a few\nminutes, with a gasp and a spasm, she breathed her last. Whether she had\nbeen chased by the greyhounds, or whether she had eaten some poisonous\nweed, which, occasioning her suffering, had driven her to her best\nfriends for aid, we never knew; but we lost our pretty pet, and many\nwere the tears shed for her.",
        "Very shortly after the departure of my husband, we received a visit from\n“the White Crow,” the “Little Priest,” and several others of the\nprincipal chiefs of the Bock River Indians. They seemed greatly\ndisappointed at learning that their Father was from home, even though\nhis errand was to get “the silver.” We sent for Paquette, who\ninterpreted for us the object of their visit.",
        "They had come to inform us that the Sauk chief Black Hawk and his band,\nwho, in compliance with a former treaty, had removed some time previous\nto the west of the Mississippi, had now returned to their old homes and\nhunting-grounds, and expressed a determination not to relinquish them,\nbut to drive off the white settlers who had begun to occupy them.",
        "The latter, in fact, the chief had already done, and having, as it was\nsaid, induced some of the Pottowattamies to join him, there was reason\nto fear that he might persuade some of the Winnebagoes to follow their\nexample.",
        "These chiefs had come to counsel with their Father, and to assure him\nthat they should do all in their power to keep their young men quiet.\nThey had heard that troops were being raised down among the whites in\nIllinois, and they had hopes that their people would be wise enough to\nkeep out of difficulty. Furthermore, they begged that their Father, on\nhis return, would see that the soldiers did not meddle with them, so\nlong as they remained quiet and behaved in a friendly manner.",
        "White Crow seemed particularly anxious to impress it upon me, that if\nany danger should arise in Shaw-nee-aw-kee’s absence, he should come\nwith his people to protect me and my family. I relied upon his\nassurances, for he had ever shown himself an upright and honorable\nIndian.",
        "Notwithstanding this, the thoughts of Indian troubles so near us, in the\nabsence of our guardian and protector, occasioned us many an anxious\nmoment, and it was not until we learned of the peaceable retreat of the\nSauks and Foxes west of the Mississippi, that we were able wholly to lay\naside our fears.",
        "We were now called to part with our friends, Major Twiggs and his\nfamily, which we did with heartfelt regret. He gave me a few parting\nwords about our old acquaintance, Krissman.",
        "“When I went into the barracks the other day,” said he, “about the time\nthe men were taking their dinner, I noticed a great six-foot soldier\nstanding against the window-frame, crying and blubbering. ’Halloo,’ said\nI, ’what on earth does this mean?’",
        "“’Why, that fellow there,’ said Krissman (for it was he), ’has scrowged\nme out of my place!’ A pretty soldier your protége will make, madam!\"\nadded the Major.",
        "I never heard more of my hero. Whether he went to exhibit his prowess\nagainst the Seminoles and Mexicans, or whether he returned to till the\nfertile soil of his native German Flats and blow his favorite boatman’s\nhorn, must be left for some future historian to tell.",
        "There is one more character to be disposed of–Louisa. An opportunity\noffering in the spring, the Major placed her under the charge of a\nperson going to Buffalo, that she might be returned to her parents. In\ncompliment to the new acquaintances she had formed, she shortened her\nskirts, mounted a pair of scarlet leggings embroidered with\nporcupine-quills, and took her leave of military life, having deposited\nwith the gentleman who took charge of her sixty dollars, for safe\nkeeping, which she remarked “she had saved up, out of her wages at a\ndollar a week, through the winter.”",
        "A very short time after we were settled in our new home at the Agency,\nwe attempted the commencement of a little Sunday-school. Edwin, Harry\nand Josette were our most reliable scholars, but besides them there were\nthe two little Manaigres, Thérèse Paquette, and her mother’s\nhalf-sister, Florence Courville, a pretty young girl of fifteen. None of\nthese girls had even learned their letters. They spoke only French, or\nrather the Canadian patois, and it was exceedingly difficult to give\nthem at once the sound of the words, and their signification, which they\nwere careful to inquire. Besides this, there was the task of correcting\nthe false ideas, and remedying the ignorance and superstition which\npresented so formidable an obstacle to rational improvement. We did our\nbest, however, and had the satisfaction of seeing them, after a time,\nmaking really respectable progress with their spelling-book, and, what\nwas still more encouraging, acquiring a degree of light and knowledge in\nregard to better things.",
        "In process of time, however, Florence was often absent from her class.\n“Her sister,” she said, “could not always spare her. She wanted her to\nkeep house while she herself went over oil Sunday to visit her friends\nthe Roys, who lived on the Wisconsin.”",
        "We reasoned with Madame Paquette on the subject. “Could she not spare\nFlorence on some hour of the day? We would gladly teach her on a\nweek-day, for she seemed anxious to learn, but we had always been told\nthat for that there was no time.”",
        "“Well–she would see. Madame Alum (Helm) and Madame John were so kind!”",
        "There was no improvement, however, in regularity. After a time Manaigre\nwas induced to send his children to Mr. Cadle’s mission-school at Green\nBay. Thérèse accompanied them, and very soon Florence discontinued her\nattendance altogether.",
        "We were obliged, from that time forward, to confine our instructions to\nour own domestic circle.",
