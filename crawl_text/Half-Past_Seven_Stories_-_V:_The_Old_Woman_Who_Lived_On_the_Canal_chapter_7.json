        "In front of the White House with the Green Blinds by the Side of the\nRoad was the Canal; and beyond the Canal the River. They always flowed\nalong side by side, and Marmaduke thought they were like two brothers.\nThe Canal was the older brother, it was always so sure and steady and\nready for work. It flowed steadily and evenly and carried the big\ncanal-boats down to the Sea. The River also flowed towards the Sea,\nbut it wasn’t at all steady, and never quiet. It was indeed like the\nyounger brother, ever ready for play, although, as a matter of fact,\nit had been there long before the Canal had been even thought of by\nthe men who built it. But thousands of years couldn’t make that River\ngrow old. It was full of frolicsome ripples that gleamed in the sun,\nand of rapids and waterfalls. Here it would flow swiftly, and there\nalmost stop as if it wanted to fall asleep. And every once in a while\nit would dart swiftly like small boys or dogs chasing butterflies.\nSometimes it would leap over the stones or, at the dam, tumble\nheadlong in sheets of silver.",
        "Little fish and big loved to play in its waters. Of course they swam\nin the Canal too, but life was lazier there and the fish, like\nMarmaduke, seemed to prefer the River. There were pickerel and trout\nand catfish and eels, and in the Spring the great shad would come in\nfrom the Sea and journey up to the still cool pools to hatch out their\nmillions of children.",
        "They looked very inviting this morning, the River and the Canal, and\nMarmaduke decided he would take a stroll. He whistled to Wienerwurst,\nwho was always the best company in the world, and the little dog came\nleaping and barking and wagging his tail, glad to be alive and about\nin such lovely weather, and on they went by the side of the Canal.",
        "They went along very slowly, for it is a mistake to walk too fast on a\nSpring morning–one misses so many things.",
        "Now and then a big fish would leap out of the River, it felt so gay,\nand in the little harbours under the banks of the Canal the\nscuttle-bugs went skimming, skimming, like swift little tugboats at\nplay. In the fields on the other side of the road a meadowlark sang;\nswallows twittered overhead; and in the grass at his feet the\ndandelions glowed like the round gold shields of a million soldiers.\nYes, altogether it was a wonderful day.",
        "Marmaduke picked a great bouquet of the dandelions–for Mother–then\nhe looked up the towpath. He could see the Red Schoolhouse, and, not\nso far away, the Lock of the Canal. He was very glad it was Saturday.\nIt was far too nice to stay indoors.",
        "Just then he had a great piece of good luck, for a big boat came by, a\ncanal-boat, shaped like a long wooden shoe. It had no sails and no\nsmokestacks, either, so it had no engine to make it go. It was drawn\nby two mules who walked on shore quite a distance ahead of it. A long\nthick rope stretched from the collars of the mules to the bow of the\nboat. A little boy walked behind the mules, yelling to them and now\nand then poking them with a long pole to make them go faster. My! how\nthey pulled and tugged on that rope! They had to, for it was a pretty\nbig load, that boat. And it had a big hole in it laden with black\nshiny coal–tons and tons of it!",
        "Just behind the coal was a clothes-line with scores of little skirts\nand pairs of pants on it, and behind that, a little house with many\nchildren running in and out of the door. A round fat rosy woman with\ngreat big arms was calling to the children to “take care,” and a man\nstood at the stern with his hand on the tiller. He had a red shirt on\nand in his mouth a pipe which Marmaduke could smell a long way off.",
        "The little boy waited until the stern came by so he could see the name\nof the boat. There it was now, painted in big letters, right under the\ntiller. He spelled it out, first “Mary,” then “Ellen\"–\"Mary Ellen–\"\na pretty name, he thought.",
        "The Man With the Red Shirt and the Pipe, and the Round Fat Rosy Woman\nWith the Big Arms, and all the children waved their hands to Marmaduke\nand he waved back, then hurried ahead, Wienerwurst trotting alongside,\nto catch up with the boy who was driving the mules.",
        "“’Llo!” said he to the boy, but the boy paid no attention at all, just\n“licked up” his mules. But Marmaduke didn’t mind this rudeness. He\nthought that probably the boy was too busy to be sociable, and he\ntrotted along with the mules and watched their long funny ears go\nwiggle-waggle when a fly buzzed near them. But they never paused or\nstopped, no matter what annoyed them, but just tugged and strained in\ntheir collars, pulling the long rope that pulled the boat that carried\nthe coal that would make somebody’s fire to cook somebody’s supper\nsome day down by the Sea.",
        "For a long time Marmaduke trotted alongside the boy and the mules, not\nrealizing at all how far he had come. Once or twice he looked back at\nthe “Mary Ellen” and the Man With the Red Shirt and the Pipe, and the\nlittle house on the deck. He wished he could go on board and steer the\n“Mary Ellen,” and play in that little house, it looked so cute. The\nRound Fat Rosy Woman was coming out of it now with a pan of water\nwhich she threw in the Canal; and the little children were running all\nover the deck, almost tumbling in the water.",
        "After quite a journey they drew near the Lock, a great place in the\nCanal like a harbour, with two pairs of gates, as high as a house, at\neach end, to keep the water in the Lock.",
        "Outside one pair of gates the water was low; outside the others, which\nwere near him, the water was high; and Marmaduke knew well what those\ngreat gates would do. The pair at the end where the water was high\nwould open and the canalboat would float in the Lock and rest there\nfor a while like a ship in harbour. Then those gates would shut tight,\nand the man who tended the Lock would open the gates at the end where\nthe water was low. And the water would rush out and go down, down in\nthe Lock, carrying the boat with it until it was on a level with the\nlow part of the Canal. And the boat at last would float out of the\nharbour of the Lock and away on its journey to the Sea.",
        "But all this hadn’t happened yet. There was much work to be done\nbefore all was ready.",
        "Now the boat had stopped in front of the high pair of gates. The Man\nWith the Red Shirt and the Pipe shouted to the boy who drove the\nmules, without taking the pipe out of his mouth. The great towrope was\nuntied and the mules rested while the man who tended the Lock swung\nthe high gates open with some machinery that creaked in a funny way,\nand the “Mary Ellen” glided in the harbour of the Lock.",
        "Then the man who tended the Lock went to the gates at the lower end.\nThere were more shouts and those gates opened too. The water rushed\nout of the Lock into the lower part of the Canal, and down, down, went\nthe boat. And down, down, went the deck and the little house on it,\nand down, down, went the Man With the Red Shirt and the Pipe, and the\nRound Fat Rosy Woman With the Great Arms, and all the children.\nMarmaduke started to count them. He couldn’t have done that before,\nthey ran around too fast. But now they stood still, watching the water\nfall and their boat as it sank. Yes, there were thirteen–he counted\ntwice to make sure.",
        "Now the boat had sunk so low that Marmaduke was afraid it would\ndisappear forever, with all the children on it. But there was no\ndanger, for when the water in the Lock was even with the water on the\nlower side of the Canal it stopped falling, and the “Mary Ellen\"\nstopped, too. At least, there was no danger for the children, but\nthere was for Master Marmaduke, he had leaned over so far, watching\nthat boat go down, down, down.",
        "All-of-a-sudden there was a splash. It was certainly to be expected\nthat one of the thirteen children had fallen in, but no!–\nIt–was–Marmaduke!",
        "Down, down, down, he sank in the gurgly brown water. Then he came up,\nspluttering and choking.",
        "“Help, help!” he cried.",
        "Then under he went again.",
        "But the Round Fat Rosy Woman had seen him.",
        "“Quick, Hiram!” she shouted to her husband in a voice that sounded\nlike a man’s, “there’s a boy fallen overboard!”",
        "“Where?” asked the man at the tiller, still keeping the pipe in his\nmouth.",
        "She pointed into the brown water.",
        "“Right there–there’s where he went down.”",
        "Perhaps the Man With the Red Shirt and the Pipe was so used to having\nhis children fall into the coal, or the Canal, or something, that he\ndidn’t think it was a serious matter, for he came to the side of the\n“Mary Ellen” very slowly, just as Marmaduke was coming up for the\nthird time.",
        "And that is a very important time, for, they say, if you go down after\nthat you won’t come up ’til you’re dead. Whether it was true or not,\nMarmaduke didn’t know, for he had never been drowned before, and no\none who had, had ever come back to tell him about it. Anyway, he\nwasn’t thinking much, only throwing his arms around in the water,\ntrying vainly to keep afloat.",
        "The Round Fat Rosy Woman grew quite excited, as well she might, and\nshe shouted again to the Man With the Red Shirt and the Pipe:",
        "“Don’t stand there like a wooden Injun in front of a cigar-store.\nHustle or the boy’ll drown!”",
        "Then he seemed to wake up, for he ran to the gunwale of the boat, and\nhe jumped over with his shoes and all his clothes on. And, strange to\nsay, he still kept that pipe in his mouth. However, that didn’t matter\nso very much, for he grabbed Marmaduke by the collar with one hand and\nswam towards the “Mary Ellen” with the other. The woman threw a rope\nover the side; he grasped it with his free hand, and the woman drew\nthem up–she certainly was strong–and in the shake of a little jiffy\nthey were standing on board, safe but dripping a thousand little\nrivers from their clothes on the deck. The man didn’t seem to mind\nthat a bit, but was quite disturbed to find that his pipe had gone\nout.",
        "“Come, Mother,” said he to the Round Fat Rosy Woman, “get us some dry\nduds and a match.”",
        "And quick as a wink she hustled them into the little house which they\ncalled a cabin, and gave Marmaduke a pair of blue overalls and a\nlittle blue jumper which belonged to one of the thirteen children. Of\ncourse, she found the right size, with so many to choose from. His own\nclothes, she hung on the line, with all the little pairs of pants and\nthe skirts, to dry in the breeze.",
        "Then she put the kettle on the cook stove and in another jiffy she was\npouring out the tea.",
        "“M–m–m–m,” said Marmaduke. He meant to say,–\"Make mine ’cambric,’\nplease,” for he knew his mother wouldn’t have wanted him to take\nregular tea, but his Forty White Horses galloped so he couldn’t\nmake himself heard.",
        "“There, little boy,” said the Round Fat Rosy Woman, “don’t talk. Just\nwrap yourself in this blanket and drink this down, and you’ll feel\nbetter.”",
        "It did taste good even if it was strong, and it warmed him all the way\ndown under the blue jumper, and the Forty White Horses stopped their\ngalloping, and while the men were hitching the mules up again, and the\n“Mary Ellen” was drifting through the lower pair of gates out of the\nLock, he fell fast asleep.",
        "He must have slept for a whole lot of jiffies. When he woke up at\nlast, he looked around, wondering where he could be, the place looked\nso strange and so different from his room at home. Then he\nremembered,–he was far from home, in the little cabin of the “Mary\nEllen.” It was a cosy place, with all the little beds for the children\naround the cabin. And these beds were not like the ones he usually\nslept in. They were little shelves on the wall, two rows of them, one\nrow above the other. It was funny, he thought, to sleep on a shelf,\nbut that was what the thirteen children had to do. He was lying on a\nshelf himself just then, wrapped in a blanket.",
        "The Round Fat Rosy Woman was bending over the stove. It was a jolly\nlittle stove, round and fat and rosy like herself, and it poked its\npipe through the house just above his head. In the pot upon it, the\npotatoes were boiling, boiling away, and the little chips of bacon\nwere curling up in the pan.",
        "Outside, he could see all the little skirts and the little pairs of\npants, dancing gaily in the wind. He could hear the children who owned\nthose skirts and pairs of pants running all over the boat. The patter\nof their feet sounded like raindrops on the deck above him.",
        "They seemed to be forever getting into trouble, those thirteen\nchildren, and the Round Fat Rosy Woman was forever running to the door\nof the little house and shouting to one or the other.",
        "“Take care, Maintop!” she would call to one boy as she pulled him back\nfrom falling into the Canal.",
        "“Ho there, Bowsprit!” she would yell to another, as she fished him out\nof the coal.",
        "They were certainly a great care, those children, and all at once\nMarmaduke decided he knew who their mother must be. The boat was\nshaped just like a huge shoe and she surely had so many children she\ndidn’t know what to do. Yes, she must be the Old Woman Who Lived in a\nShoe, only the shoe must have grown into a canalboat.",
        "He wondered about the funny names she called them.",
        "“Are those their real names?” he asked, as he lay on his little shelf.",
        "“Yes,” she said, “my husband out there with the pipe was a sailor\nonce, on the deep blue sea. But he had to give it up after he was\nmarried, ’cause he couldn’t take his family on a ship. We had a lot of\ntrouble finding names for the children started to call ’em Mary and\nDaniel and such, but the names ran out. So, seeing my husband was so\nfond of the sea, we decided to call ’em after the parts of a ship, not\na canalboat, but the sailing ships that go out to sea–that is, all\nbut Squall.",
        "“Now that’s Jib there, driving the mules, and that’s Bowsprit–the one\nall black from the coal. Cutwater’s the girl leaning over the stern;\nMaintop, the one with the three pigtails; and Mizzen, the towhead\nplaying with your dog.”",
        "“And what are the names of the rest?” Marmaduke asked, thinking all\nthis very interesting.",
        "“Oh!” she replied. “I’ll have to stop and think, there’s so many of\nthem. Now there’s Bul’ark and Gunnel–they’re pretty stout; the twins,\nAnchor and Chain; Squall, the crybaby; Block, the fattest of all;\nTopmast, the tallest and thinnest; and Stern, the littlest. He came\nlast, so we named him that, seeing it’s the last part of a ship.",
        "“Now, let me think–have I got ’em all?” and she counted on her\nfingers,–\"Jib, Bowsprit, Cutwater, Maintop, Mizzen, Bul’ark, Gunnel,\nAnchor, Chain, Block, Squall, Topmast, and Stern. Yes, that surely\nmakes thirteen, doesn’t it? I’m always proud when I can remember ’em.”",
        "[Illustration: “The boat was shaped like a wooden shoe, and she surely\nhad so many children she didn’t know what to do.\"]",
        "By this time the potatoes and the bacon and coffee seemed about ready,\nso she went out on deck, and Marmaduke slid off his little shelf bed\nand followed her to see where she was going. On deck was a great bar\nof iron with another beside it. She took up one bar of iron and with\nit struck the other–twelve times. The blows sounded way out over the\nCanal and over the fields and far away, like a mighty fire-alarm, and\nall the children, that is all but Jib, who was driving the mules and\nwould get his dinner later, came running into the cabin.",
        "A great clatter of tin plates and knives and forks there was, and very\nnice did those potatoes and that bacon taste.",
        "And it didn’t take long for them to finish that meal, either. Then\nthey went out on deck.",
        "The mules were pulling and pulling, and the boat was sailing on and on\ntowards the Sea. They passed by so many places–lots of houses and\nlots of farms, the Red Schoolhouse and Reddy Toms’ house, and Sammy\nSoapstone’s, and the funny place where Fatty lived, and the pigs, fat\nlike himself, ran all over the yard.",
        "Fatty and Sammy were playing on the shore at that very moment. He\nwaved to them and they waved back, but they didn’t know they were\nwaving to their old playmate Marmaduke, he was so mixed up with all\nthe children of the woman who lived on the canalboat that looked just\nlike a shoe. How Sammy and Sophy and Fatty would have envied him if\nthey had only known it was he sailing away to the Sea!",
        "But he never arrived there, after all–at least he didn’t on that\nvoyage. For, you see, after he had had a wonderful time, running all\nover the deck with the thirteen children, and looking down into the\nbig hole where they kept the shiny coal, and exploring the little\nhouse on the deck, the Round Fat Rosy Woman and her Husband With the\nRed Shirt and the Pipe had a talk together.",
        "“We must send him back home,” said she, “or his folks’ll be scared out\nof their wits.”",
        "The man took a few puffs on his pipe, which always seemed to help him\nin thinking, then replied,",
        "“We might let him off at the Landing it’s up the towpath a piece. We\nkin find someone to give him a lift.”",
        "“That’s the best plan,” she agreed, “there’s the Ruralfree’livery\nnow.”",
        "And she pointed to the shore where the horse and wagon of the postman\nwere coming up the road.",
        "“What ho, Hi! Heave to!” she called, raising her hands to her mouth\nand shouting through them just like a man, “here’s a passenger for\nyou, first class.”",
        "“Mr. Ruralfree’liv’ry” shook his whip at them, then hollered “Whoa!\"\nand stopped the old horse; and Jib hollered “Whoa!” and stopped his\nmules, right at the Landing.",
        "Then Marmaduke said “Goodbye.” It took him some time, for there was\nthe Man With the Red Shirt and the Pipe; and the Round Fat Rosy Woman;\nand Jib, Bowsprit, Cutwater, Mizzen, Maintop, Bul’ark, Gunnel, Anchor,\nChain, Block, Squall, Topmast, and Stern; the “Mary Ellen\"; and the\nmules, to say “Goodbye” to. Just before he went ashore the Round Fat\nRosy Woman gave him his clothes back, for they were all dry by that\ntime, and she stuffed something in his pocket besides. And what do you\nthink it was? A toy anchor and chain that would just fit the “White\nSwan,” the ship the Toyman had made him.",
        "So he rode home with Mr. Ruralfree’liv’ry and all his sacks of mail.\nBut he kept turning his head for a long while to watch the Man With\nthe Red Shirt and the Pipe, and the Round Fat Rosy Woman, and the\nThirteen Children, and all the little pairs of pants that seemed to be\nwaving farewell to him. But soon the “Mary Ellen” drifted out of\nsight. She was a good boat, the “Mary Ellen.”",
        "He almost felt like crying, for he would have liked to have gone on\nthat voyage to see the rest of the world. But, after all, he had seen\na great deal of it, and he had that anchor and chain.",
