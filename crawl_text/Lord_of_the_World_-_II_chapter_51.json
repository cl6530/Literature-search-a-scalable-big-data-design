        "Oliver let himself into his house, and went straight upstairs to Mabel’s\nroom. It would not do to let her hear the news from any but his own\nlips. She was not there, and on inquiry he heard that she had gone out\nan hour before.",
        "He was disconcerted at this. The decree had been signed half-an-hour\nearlier, and in answer to an inquiry from Lord Pemberton it had been\nstated that there was no longer any reason for secrecy, and that the\ndecision might be communicated to the press. Oliver had hurried away\nimmediately in order to make sure that Mabel should hear the news from\nhim, and now she was out, and at any moment the placards might tell her\nof what had been done.",
        "He felt extremely uneasy, but for another hour or so was ashamed to act.\nThen be went to the tube and asked another question or two, but the\nservant had no idea of Mabel’s movements; it might be she had gone to\nthe church; sometimes she did at this hour. He sent the woman off to\nsee, and himself sat down again in the window-seat of his wife’s room,\nstaring out disconsolately at the wide array of roofs in the golden\nsunset light, that seemed to his eyes to be strangely beautiful this\nevening. The sky was not that pure gold which it had been every night\nduring this last week; there was a touch of rose in it, and this\nextended across the entire vault so far as he could see from west to\neast. He reflected on what he had lately read in an old book to the\neffect that the abolition of smoke had certainly changed evening colours\nfor the worse.... There had been a couple of severe earthquakes, too, in\nAmerica–he wondered whether there was any connection.... Then his\nthoughts flew back to Mabel....",
        "It was about ten minutes before he heard her footstep on the stairs, and\nas he stood up she came in.",
        "There was something in her face that told him that she knew everything,\nand his heart sickened at her pale rigidity. There was no fury\nthere–nothing but white, hopeless despair, and an immense\ndetermination. Her lips showed a straight line, and her eyes, beneath\nher white summer hat, seemed contracted to pinpricks. She stood there,\nclosing the door mechanically behind her, and made no further movement\ntowards him.",
        "“Is it true?” she said.",
        "Oliver drew one steady breath, and sat down again.",
        "“Is what true, my dear?”",
        "“Is it true,” she said again, “that all are to be questioned as to\nwhether they believe in God, and to be killed if they confess it?”",
        "Oliver licked his dry lips.",
        "“You put it very harshly,” he said. “The question is, whether the world\nhas a right–-”",
        "She made a sharp movement with her head.",
        "“It is true then. And you signed it?”",
        "“My dear, I beg you not to make a scene. I am tired out. And I will not\nanswer that until you have heard what I have to say.”",
        "“Say it, then.”",
        "“Sit down, then.”",
        "She shook her head.",
        "“Very well, then.... Well, this is the point. The world is one now, not\nmany. Individualism is dead. It died when Felsenburgh became President\nof the World. You surely see that absolutely new conditions prevail\nnow–there has never been anything like it before. You know all this as\nwell as I do.”",
        "Again came that jerk of impatience.",
        "“You will please to hear me out,” he said wearily. “Well, now that this\nhas happened, there is a new morality; it is exactly like a child coming\nto the age of reason. We are obliged, therefore, to see that this\ncontinues–that there is no going back–no mortification–that all the\nlimbs are in good health. ’If thy hand offend thee, cut it off,’ said\nJesus Christ. Well, that is what we say.... Now, for any one to say that\nthey believe in God–I doubt very much whether there is any one who\nreally does believe, or understand what it means–but for any one even\nto say so is the very worst crime conceivable: it is high treason. But\nthere is going to be no violence; it will all be quite quiet and\nmerciful. Why, you have always approved of Euthanasia, as we all do.\nWell, it is that that will be used; and–-”",
        "Once more she made a little movement with her hand. The rest of her was\nlike an image.",
        "“Is this any use?” she asked.",
        "Oliver stood up. He could not bear the hardness of her voice.",
        "“Mabel, my darling–-”",
        "For an instant her lips shook; then again she looked at him with eyes of\nice.",
        "“I don’t want that,” she said. “It is of no use.. Then you did sign it?”",
        "Oliver had a sense of miserable desperation as he looked back at her.\nHe would infinitely have preferred that she had stormed and wept.",
        "“Mabel–-” he cried again.",
        "“Then you did sign it?”",
        "“I did sign it,” he said at last.",
        "She turned and went towards the door. He sprang after her.",
        "“Mabel, where are you going?”",
        "Then, for the first time in her life, she lied to her husband frankly\nand fully.",
        "“I am going to rest a little,” she said. “I shall see you presently at\nsupper.”",
        "He still hesitated, but she met his eyes, pale indeed, but so honest\nthat he fell back.",
        "“Very well, my dear.... Mabel, try to understand.”",
        "He came down to supper half-an-hour later, primed with logic, and even\nkindled with emotion. The argument seemed to him now so utterly\nconvincing; granted the premises that they both accepted and lived by,\nthe conclusion was simply inevitable.",
        "He waited a minute or two, and at last went to the tube that\ncommunicated with the servants’ quarters.",
        "“Where is Mrs. Brand?” he asked.",
        "There was an instant’s silence, and then the answer came:",
        "“She left the house half-an-hour ago, sir. I thought you knew.”",
