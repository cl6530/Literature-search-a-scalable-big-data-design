        "It is instructive to inquire what were the literary relations\nbetween the distinguished statesmen and active princes who moved\nabout quite freely within the limited area so frequently alluded\nto in foregoing pages as being sacrosanct to civilization and the\nrites. There seems good reason to suppose that the literary\nactivity which so disgusted the destroyer of the books in 213 B.C.\ndid not really begin until after Confucius’ death in 479;\nmoreover, that the avalanche of philosophical works which drenched\nthe royal courts of the Six Kingdoms was in part the consequence\nof Confucius’ own efforts in the literary line. In the pre-\nConfucian days there is little evidence of the existence of any\nliterature at all beyond the Odes, the Changes, the Book, and the\nRites, which, after a lapse of 2500 years or more, are still the\n“Bible” of China. The Odes, of which 3000 were popularly known\nprevious to Confucius’ recension, seem to have been originally\ncomposed here and there, and passed from mouth to mouth, by the\npeople of each orthodox state under impulse of strong passion,\nfeeling, or suffering; or some of them may even have been\ncommitted to writing by learned folk in touch with the people.\nNaturally, those songs which specially treated of local matters\nwould be locally popular; but it would seem that a large number of\nthem must have been generally known by heart by the whole educated\nbody all over orthodox China, It will be remembered that in the\nyear 1900, an enterprising American newspaper correspondent took\nadvantage of President Kruger’s penchant for quoting Scripture,\nand telegraphed to him daily texts, selected as applicable to the\nevent, for which the replies to be sent were always prepaid. For\ninstance, on news of a British victory, the American would\ntelegraph: “Victory stayeth not always with the righteous\"; on\nwhich President Kruger would promptly rejoin: “Yet shall I smite\nhim, even unto the end.” This was the plan followed by Chinese\nenvoys, statesmen, and princes in their intercourse with each\nother: no matter what event transpired, Ki-chah, or Tsz-ch’an, or\nShuh Hiang would illustrate it with an ode, or with a reference to\nthe “Book” (of history), or by an appeal to the Rites of Chou, or\nto some obscure astrological or cosmogonical development extracted\nfrom the mystic diagrams of “The Changes.” As often as not, the\nquotations given from the Odes and Book no longer exist in the\neditions of those two classics which have come down to us. This\nfact is interesting as proving that the Tso Chwan–or Commentary of\nConfucius’ pupil Tso K’iu-ming on Confucius’ own bare notes of history–\nmust have been written before Confucius’ expurgated Book of Odes\nreduced and fixed the number of selected songs; or, at all events,\nthe records from which Tso K’iu-ming took his quotations must have\nexisted before either he or Confucius composed their respective annals\nand comments. In the times when a book the size of a three-volume\nnovel of to-day would mean a mule-load of bamboo splinters or wooden\ntablets, it is absurd to suppose that generals in the field, or envoys on\nthe march, could carry their Odes bodily about with them: it is even\nprobable that the four “scriptural” books in question were\nexclusively committed to memory by the general public, and that\nnot more than half a dozen varnish-written copies existed in any\nstate; possibly not more than one copy. In fact, the only\navailable literary exhilaration then open to cultured friends was\nto check the memory on visiting strange lands by comparing the\ntexts of Odes, Changes, or Book. A knowledge of the Rites would\nperhaps be confined to the ruling classes almost entirely, for\nwith them it lay to pronounce the religious, the ritual, the\nsocial, or the administrative sanction applicable to each\ncontested set of circumstances. It is very much as though,–as was\nindeed the case in Johnsonian times,–the French, English, and\nGerman wits of the day, and occasionally distinguished literary\nspecimens of even more “barbarous” countries, should at a literary\nconference indulge in quotations from Horace or Juvenal by way of\npassing the time: they would not select the Twelve Tables or the\nLaws of the Pr’tors as matter for the testing of learning.",
        "To take a few instances. In 559 the ruler of Wei had severely\nbeaten his court music-master for failing to teach a concubine how\nto play the lute. One day the prince invited to dinner some\nstatesmen, the father of one of whom had taken offence at the\nprince’s rudeness; and he ordered the same musician to strike up\nthe last stanza of a certain ode hinting at treason, which the\nmalicious performer did in such a way as to give further offence\nto the father through his son, and to bring about the dethronement\nof the indiscreet prince. It gives us confidence in the truth of\nthese anecdotes when we find that K’ue-peh-yueh was consulted by the\noffended father as to what course he ought to pursue. This Wei\nstatesman, who has already been twice mentioned in connection with\nother matters, met Ki-chah of Wu when the latter visited that\nstate in 544, and he was also an admired senior acquaintance of\nConfucius himself, whom he twice lodged at his house for many\nmonths. Three Chapters of the “Book” still remain, after\nConfucius’ manipulations of it, to prove how Wei was first\nenfeoffed by the Duke of Chou, and one of the Odes actually sings\nthe praises of a Ts’i princess who married the prince of Wei in\n753 B.C. Thus we see that the ancient classics are intertwined and\nmutually corroborative.",
        "When the Second Protector (the last of the four Tartar-born\nbrothers to succeed to the Tsin throne) was on his wanderings in\n644 B.C., the Marquess of Ts’i gave him a daughter, of whom he\nbecame so enamoured that he seemed to be neglecting his political\nchances amid the pleasures of a foreign country, instead of\nendeavouring to regain his rightful throne at home. This princess\nfirst of all quoted an ode from the group treating of CHENG\naffairs, and secondly cited an apt saying from what she “had\nheard” the great Ts’i philosopher Kwan-tsz had said, her object\nbeing to promote her lively husband’s political interests. This\nall took place a few years after Kwan-tsz’s death, and 200 years\nafter the founding of CHENG state, and is therefore indirect\nconfirmation of the fact that Kwan-tsz was already a well-known\nauthority, and that contemporary affairs were usually “sung of” in\nall the orthodox states.",
        "When the Duke of Sung, after the death in 628 B.C. of the\npicturesque personality just referred to, was ambitious to become\nthe Third Protector of orthodox China and of the Emperor;\nConfucius’ ancestor, then a Sung statesman, approved of this\nambition, and proceeded to compose some complimentary sacrificial\nodes on the Shang dynasty (from which the Sung ducal family was\ndescended): some learned critics make out that it was the music-\nmaster of the Emperor who really composed these odes for the\nancestor of Confucius. In any case, there the odes are still, in\nthe Book of Odes as revised by Confucius himself about 150 years\nlater; and here accordingly–we have specific indirect evidence of\nConfucius’ own origin; of the “spiritual” power still possessed by\nthe Emperor’s court; and of the “Poet Laureate\"-like political\nuses to which odes were put in the international life of the\ntimes. This foolish Duke of Sung, who was so anxious to pose as\nProtector, was the one already mentioned in Chapters X. and XIV.,\nwho would not attack an enemy whilst crossing a stream.",
        "Again, in the year 651, when one of the least popular of the four\nTartar-born brethren was, with the assistance of the Ts’in ruler\n(who had been over-persuaded against his own better judgment),\nreigning in Tsin, the children of this latter state sang a ballad\nin the streets, prophesying the ultimate success of the self-\nsacrificing elder brother, then still away on his wanderings in\nTartarland. This song was apparently never included among the 3000\nodes generally known in China; but it illustrates how such popular\nsongs and popular heroes were created and perpetuated.–It is,\nperhaps, time now that we should give the personal name of this\npopular prince, of whom we have spoken so often, and who is as\nwell known to Chinese tradition as the severe Brutus ’is, or as\nthe ravishing Tarquin was, to old Roman history. His name was\nCh’ung-erh, or “the double-eared,” in allusion to some peculiarity\nin the lobes of his ears; besides which, two of his ribs were\nbelieved to be joined in one piece: his great success is perhaps\nlargely owing to his robust and manly appearance, which certainly\nsecured for him the eager attentions of the ladies, whether Turks\nor Chinese. His Turkish wife had been as disinterestedly\nsolicitous for his success, before he went to Ts’i, as his Ts’i\nwife was when she induced him to leave that country. On arrival in\nTs’in, he was presented with five princesses, including one who\nhad already been given to his nephew and immediate predecessor in\nTsin. The “rites” were of course decidedly wrong here, but his\nally Ts’in was at this time hesitating between Chinese and Tartar\nculture, and in any case he was probably persuaded in his mind to\nlet the rites go by the board for urgent political purposes. On\nthis occasion his brother-in-law and faithful henchman during\nnineteen years of wanderings, sang “the song of the fertilized\nmillet” (still existing), meaning that Ch’ung-erh was the gay\nyoung stalk fertilized by the presents and assistance of the ruler\nof Ts’in: he was, by the way, not so young, then well over sixty.\nHe had married the younger of two Tartar sisters, and had given\nher elder sister as wife to the henchman in question. (One account\nreverses the order.)",

        "Ts’u seems to have possessed a knowledge of ancient history and of\nliterature at a very early date. In 597 B.C., after his victory\nover Tsin, the King of Ts’u had, as previously narrated, declined\nto rear a barrow over the corpses slain, and had said: “No! the\nwritten or pictograph character for ’soldierly’ is made up of two\nparts, one signifying ’stop,’ and the other ’weapons.’” By this he\nmeant to say what the great philosopher Lao-tsz, himself a Ts’u\nman, over and over again inculcated; namely, that the true soldier\ndoes not glory in war, but mournfully aims at victory with the\nsole view of attaining rightful ends. Not only was this half-\nbarbarian king thus capable of making a pun which from the\npictograph point of view still holds good to-day, but he goes on\nin the same speech to cite the “peace-loving war” of Wu Wang, or\nthe Martial King, founder of the Chou dynasty, and to cite several\nstandard odes in allusion to it.",
        "These examples might be multiplied a hundredfold, For instance, in\nthe year 589 a Ts’u minister cites the Odes; in 575 a Tsin officer\nquotes the Book; in 569 another makes allusion to the ancient\nattempt made by the ruler of the then vassal Chou state, the\nfather of the imperial Chou founder, and who was at the same time\nadviser at the imperial court, to reconcile the vassal princes to\nthe legitimate Shang dynasty Emperor (who had already imprisoned\nhim once out of pique at his remonstrances), before finally\ndeciding to dethrone him. In 546 a Sung envoy cites the Odes to\nthe Ts’u government, and also quotes from that section of the\n“Book” called the Book of the Hia Dynasty, In connection with the\nyear 582 an ode is cited for the benefit of the King of Ts’u,\nwhich is not in Confucius’ collection. In 541 a Ts’u envoy, who\nwas being entertained in Tsin at a convivial wine party, indulges\nin apt quotations from the Odes.",
        "There does not seem to be one single instance where any one in\nTs’in either sings an ode, quotes orthodox history, or in any way\ndisplays literary knowledge. Even the barbarian Kou-tsien, King of\nYueeh, has wise saws and modern instances quoted to him in his\ndistress. For instance, whilst hesitating about utterly\nannihilating the Wu reigning family, he was advised: “If one will\nnot take gifts from Heaven, Heaven may send one misfortune.” This\nis a very hackneyed saying in ancient Chinese history, and is as\nmuch used to-day as it was 2500 years ago: it comes from the Book\nof Chou (now partly lost). It will be remembered that the\ndistinguished Japanese statesman, Count Okuma, in his now\nnotorious speech before the Kobe Chamber of Commerce on the 20th\nOctober, 1907, used these identical words to point the moral of\nIndian commerce. It is doubtful if any other really pregnant\nJapanese philosophical saying exists which cannot be similarly\ntraced to China. In any case, Count Okuma was only literally\ncarrying out in Kobe the policy of Tsin, Ts’u, Ts’i, and Wei\nstatesmen of China 2500 years ago.",
        "If, as we have assumed, standard books were usually committed to\nmemory (and it must be remembered that the Odes, and much of the\nBook, the Changes, and the Rites are still so committed to memory\nin our own times), and were practically confined to the\nheadquarters or the wealthy families of each state, the cognate\nquestion inevitably arises: What about the historical records? It\nhas already been observed that Ts’in, the half-Tartar power in the\nextreme west, was the only state belonging to the recognized\nfederal system (and that only since 771 B.C.) of which nothing\nliterary is recorded, and which, though powerful enough to assist\nin making Emperors of Chou and rulers of Tsin, was never in\nConfucian times thought morally fit to act as Protector of the\nImperial Federal Union, i.e. of Chu Hia, or “All the Chinas.\"\nBy a singular irony of fate, however, it so happens that a few Ts’in\ninscriptions are the only political ones remaining to us of ancient\nChinese documents.",
        "When the outlying semi-Chinese states surrounding the inner\nconclave of orthodox Chinese states, after four centuries of\nfighting and intrigue for the Protectorate, or at least for\npreponderance, at last, during the period 400-375 B.C. became the\nSix Powers, all equally royal, none of them owing any real,\nscarcely even any nominal, allegiance to the once solitary King or\nEmperor, then it was that the idea began to enter the heads of the\nTs’in statesmen and the rulers of at least three of the Six Royal\nPowers opposed to Ts’in that it would be a good thing to get rid\nof the old feudal vassal system root and branch. So unquestionably\nis this period 400-375 B.C. taken as one of the great pivot points\nin Chinese history, that the great historian Sz-ma Kwang begins\nhis renowned history, the Tsz-chi Tung-kien, published in\n1084 A.D., with the words: “In 403 B.C. the states of Han, Ngwei,\nand Chao were recognized as vassal ruling princes by the Emperor.\"\nTs’in took to educating herself seriously for her great destiny,\nand at last, in 221 B.C., after the wars already described in\nChapter XXVI., succeeded in uniting all known China under one\ncentralized sway; rounding off the Tartars so as to make the Great\nWall (rather than the Yellow River, as of old) their southern\nlimit; conquering the remains of the “Hundred Yueeh” (the vague\nunknown South China which had hitherto been the special preserve\nof Ts’u;) and assimilating the ancient empire of Shuh (i.e. Sz\nCh’wan, hitherto only vaguely known to orthodox China at all, and\npolitically connected only with Ts’in).",
        "During this process of universal assimilation and annexation, the\nalmost supernaturally active First August Emperor made tour after\ntour throughout his new dominions, showing a special predilection\nfor the coasts, for Tartarland, and for the Lower Yang-tsz River;\nbut not venturing far up or far south of that Great River; and\neven when he did so venture a short distance, never leaving the\nold and well-known water routes: nor did he risk a land journey to\nSz Ch’wan, to which country there were at the time no roads of any\nkind at all possible for armies. It is well known that both he and\nthe legal, international, political, and diplomatical adventurers\nwho had been for a century or more from time to time at his court\nhad been strongly imbued with the somewhat revolutionary and then\nfashionable democratic principles of the new Taoism, as defined by\nthe philosopher Lao-tsz; but he showed no particular hostility to\northodox literature until, whilst on his travels, deputations of\nlearned men, especially in the ritual centres of Lu and Ts’i,\nbegan to suggest to him the re-establishment of the old feudal\nsystem, and to “quote the ancient scriptures” to him by way of\nprotesting mildly against his too drastic political changes. It\nhas been explained in Chapter XIII. that in 626 B.C., when his\ngreat ancestor Duke Muh had availed himself of the advisory\nservices of an educated Tartar (of Tsin descent), this Tartar had\nmade use of the expression: “The King of the Tartars governs in a\nsimple, ready way, without the aid of the Odes and the Book as in\nthe case of China.” Thus it was that, possibly with this ancient\nwarning in his mind, he conceived a sudden, violent, and\npassionate hatred for didactic works generally, and two books in\nparticular-the very two, passages from which pedants, philosophers,\nambassadors, and ministers had for centuries hurled at each other’s\nheads alike in convivial, argumentative, and solemn moments. In\nother words, the Odes and the Book, together with Confucius’\n“Springs and Autumns,” with its censorious hints for rulers, and all\nthe other local Annals and Histories, were under anathema, But\nmore detestable even than these were the new philosophical\ntreatises of a polemical kind, which girded at monarchs through\ntheir subtle choice of words and anecdotes, or which recalled the\ngood old times of the feudal emperors and their not very obsequious\nvassals. His self-laudatory inscriptions upon stone, scattered about\nas he travelled from place to place, tell us plainly, in his own royal\nwords, that this hatred of presumptuous vassal claims was his prime\nmotive in destroying all the pedants and books he could secure. He\ndenounces the vassals of bygone times who ignored the Supreme\nEmperor, fought with each other, and had the insolence to “carve stone\nand metal in order to record their own deeds.” The Changes are quoted\nin history often enough by statesmen, as well as the Odes and the Book;\nbut, even if the First August Emperor did not entertain the suspicion that\nthe first were (as, indeed, they are according to our Western\nlights) all “hocus-pocus,” he was himself very credulous and\nsuperstitious, and the learned word-juggling of the Changes was in\nany case harmless to him; so that really his rage was confined to\nthe four or five books, known by heart throughout China, setting\nforth the ancient ritual system of previous dynasties, as\nperfected by the Chou government; the subordination of all other\nkings (Ts’in included) to the Chou family; the wrath of Heaven,\nthe divinity of the people, and so on. Things had been made worse\nduring the Fighting State Period (480-230) by the extraordinary\nliterary activity prevailing at the different royal courts, when\nthe old royal tao had been interpreted in one way by Lao-\ntsz and his followers, in another by Confucius and his school; in\ncountless others by the schools of Legists, Purists, Scholastics,\nCosmogonists, Pessimists, Optimists, and so on. A clean sweep was\naccordingly made, so far as it was possible and practicable, of\nall literature, with the exception (amongst old books) of the\nChanges, and of practical modern or ancient books on astronomy,\nmedicine, and agriculture. At the same time copies of the\nproscribed Odes and Book were kept on record at court for the use\nof the learned in the service of the Emperor. All “histories,\"\nexcept that of Ts’in, were utterly destroyed, and a fortiori all\nargumentative works on history or on administrative policy of any kind.\nThe old Tartar blood and Tartar sympathies of the First August Emperor\nmust surely re-appear in a policy so incompatible with all orthodox\nteaching? In one sense the blight upon Chinese civilization was akin\nto the blight cast upon that of Eastern Europe 500 years ago by the\n“unspeakable Turk.” The new ruler boldly said: “The world begins\nafresh, with me. No posthumous condemnatory titles for me! My\nsuccessor will be ’August Emperor Number Two,’ and so on for ever.\"\nIt was like the Vendemiaire in 1793.",
        "Thus, except in so far as Confucius may have borrowed from local\nhistories besides that of Lu in making up his “Springs and\nAutumns,” the Annals of Ts’in are the only annals of the feudal\nstates (except the Bamboo Books, or Annals of Tsin, dug up in A.D.\n281) now left to us. That there were such annals in each state is\ncertain, for in 627 B.C. the “great historian” of Tsin is spoken\nof; and in 607 and 510 the names of the Tsin historians are given,\nin the first case apparently a Tartar. That there should be a Tsin\nTartar versed in Chinese literature is not remarkable, for it was\nshown at the close of Chapter XIII. how a learned Tsin Tartar had\nacted as adviser to Duke Muh of Ts’in, and had left behind him a\nwork in two Chapters, which was still in existence in 50 B.C.\nUnder the year 628 B.C., one of the expanded versions of\nConfucius’ history explains how the anarchy which had then been\nfor some time prevailing in Tsin led to certain Tsin events of the\nyear 630 being omitted by Confucius; this is a very important\nstatement, for it infers that Confucius made use of the Tsin\nannals. It is recorded of Confucius that when reading the Shi-\nki (\"Historical Annals”), he expressed very strong views when\nhe came to the events of 632 and 598 B.C., that is, to the place\nwhere the “ordering up” of the Emperor by Tsin is described, and\nto the noble action of the “sage” King of Ts’u; it is interesting\nto know that this old name, Shi-ki, was chosen by the author of\nthe first real history of China published under that title about 90 B.C.,\nand that he was not the inventor of the name, which had already for\ncenturies been applied in a general sense to the historical annals either\nof Lu or of China generally.",
        "In 547 B.C. it is stated that the “great historian” of Ts’i made\ncertain remarks: we have already seen in the present Chapter how\nthe Ts’i wife of the Second Protector was in 640 B.C. perfectly\nwell acquainted with the historical and philosophical works of\nKwan-tsz, the great administrative innovator of Ts’i under the\nFirst Protector. In the second century B.C. Kwan-tsz’s work of\neighty-six Chapters was placed at the head of the Taoist works (of\ncourse before Taoism became Lao-tsz’s speciality). It is\nmentioned, quite casually, in the year 538, in a political\nconversation which took place with the King of Ts’u, that the\nFirst Protector of Ts’i in the year 647 B.C. had had to contend\nwith the serious rebellion of a subject (who is named). All\ncircumstances point to the truth of this isolated, but otherwise\nmost specific statement; yet it is not mentioned elsewhere,–\nevidence, if it were wanted, that many historical works, from\nwhich facts were borrowed as though the details were well known to\nall, must have disappeared entirely.",
        "As to Ts’u, its Annals were known by the curious name of “Stinking\nWood,” by which it is supposed that the evil recorded of men upon\nwooden tablets was meant. That Ts’u subsequently developed a high\nliterary capacity is evident, for the anniversary of the suicide\nof the celebrated Ts’u poet K’ueh Yiian (envoy to Ts’i during the\nfierce diplomatic intrigues of 31 B.C.) has been kept up as the\nannual “dragon festival” down to our own times, in memory of his\nsuicide by drowning in the Tung-t’ing Lake district; and his poems\nare amongst the most beautiful in the Chinese language. In 656\nB.C. the dictatorial First Protector tried to play the role\nof the wolf, with Ts’u in the character of the lamb: he said: “How\nis it you have not for so many generations past sent your tribute\nof sedge to the Emperor? How about the other Emperor who visited\n(modern) Hankow in 1003 B.C. and was never heard of again?” The\nKing replied: “As to our failure to send tribute, we admit it; as\nto the supposed murder of the Emperor 350 years ago, you had\nbetter ask the people of Hankow themselves what they know of it.\"\n(Ts’u had hardly yet permanently advanced so far east.)",
        "In 496 B.C. it is recorded of a scholar at the Emperor’s court\nthat, being anxious to see his own name in the “Springs and\nAutumns,” he suggested to the Emperor that for a long time no\ncomplimentary mission had been sent to Lu. The result was that he\nwas sent himself, and is thus immortalized: it does not follow\nfrom this that the knowledge of Confucius’ coming book had\npenetrated to the Chou court, because “Springs and Autumns” was\nalready the accepted term in Lu for “Annals,” long before\nConfucius adopted the already existing general name for his own\nparticular work. In 496 Confucius had left Lu in disgust, and had\ngone to Wei–the capital of Wei was then on, or near, the then\nYellow River (now the River Wei), between the two towns marked\n“Hwa” and “K’ai” on modern maps–where he collected materials for\nhis History; but he did not begin it until the year 481; so\nprobably the ambitious scholar simply hoped to appear in the\n“Springs and Autumns” of Lu, as they had already been called\nbefore Confucius borrowed the name, just as Sz-ma Ts’ien borrowed\nthe name Shi-ki.",
        "As to Ts’in, Ts’in’s own Annals tell us that “in 753 B.C.\nhistorians were first established to keep record of events.” Hence\neven the Ts’in records, the sole annals preserved from the flames,\nmust be retrospective from that date. In any case they contain\nnothing of historical importance farther back than 753 B.C.,\nexcept the wars with Tartars; the accompanying of the Emperor Muh,\nas charioteer, by a Ts’in prince on the occasion of his “going to\nexamine his fiefs in the west\"; and the cession of the old Chou\nappanage to Ts’in in 771. By their baldness, and by the baldness\nof the Bamboo Books, and of Confucius’ own “Springs and Autumns,\"\nwe may fairly judge of the probable insufficiency and dryness of\nthe Annals of Ts’u, Ts’i, Wei, CHENG, Sung, and other states\ninterested in the welter of the Fighting State Period. Early\nChinese annals contain little more satisfying than the “generations of\nAdam” in the fifth Chapter of Genesis.",
