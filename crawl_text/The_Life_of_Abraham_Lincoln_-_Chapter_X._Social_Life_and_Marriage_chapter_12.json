        "\nAbraham Lincoln (1809-1865)\n16th President of the United States",
        "\n\n",
        "Springfield was largely settled by people born and educated in older\nand more cultured communities. From the first it developed a social\nlife of its own. In the years on both sides of 1840, it maintained as\nlarge an amount of such social activity as was possible in a new\nfrontier city. In this life Lincoln was an important factor. The public\ninterest in the man made this necessary, even apart from considerations\nof his own personal preferences.",
        "We have seen that he was extremely sociable in his tastes. He was fond\nof being among men. Wherever men were gathered, there Lincoln went, and\nwherever Lincoln was, men gathered about him. In the intervals of work,\nat nooning or in the evening, he was always the center of an interested\ngroup, and his unparalleled flow of humor, wit, and good nature was the\nlife of the assemblage. This had always been so from childhood. It had\nbecome a second nature with him to entertain the crowd, while the crowd\ncame to look upon him as their predestined entertainer.",
        "But Lincoln had been brought up in the open air, on the very frontier,\n“far from the madding crowd.” His social experience and his tastes were\nwith men, not ladies. He was not used to the luxuries of civilization,\n–elegant carpets, fine china, fashionable dress. Though he had great\ndignity and nobility of soul, he did not have that polish of manners\nwhich counts for so much with ladies. His ungainly physique accented\nthis lack. He was not, he never could be, what is known as a ladies’\nman. While his friendly nature responded to all sociability, he was not\nfond of ladies’ society. He was naturally in great demand, and he\nattended all the social gatherings. But when there, he drifted away\nfrom the company of the ladies into that of the men. Nor were the men\nloath to gather about him.",
        "The ladies liked him, but one of them doubtless spoke the truth, when\nshe declared that their grievance against him was that he monopolized\nthe attention of the men. This was natural to him, it had been\nconfirmed by years of habit, and by the time he was thirty years old it\nwas practically impossible for him to adopt the ways acceptable to\nladies.",
        "Into this society in Springfield came a pretty, bright, educated,\ncultured young lady–Miss Mary Todd. She was of an aristocratic family\nfrom Kentucky. It is said that she could trace the family genealogy\nback many centuries. She may have been haughty–she was said to be so–\nand she may have been exacting in those little matters which make up so\nlarge a measure of what is known as polish of manners. These would be\nprecisely the demands which Lincoln was unable to meet.",
        "It was a foregone conclusion that the two would be thrown much into\neach other’s society, and that the neighbors would connect them in\nthought. For Lincoln was the most popular man and Miss Todd was the\nmost popular young lady in Springfield. It was simply another case of\nthe attraction of opposites, for in everything except their popularity\nthey were as unlike as they could be.",
        "It is proverbial that the course of true love never did run smooth. If\nthere were ripples and eddies and counter-currents in the course of\nthis love, it was in nowise exceptional. It is only the prominence of\nthe parties that has brought this into the strong light of publicity.",
        "Much has been written that is both unwarranted and unkind. Even the\nmost confidential friends do not realize the limitations of their\nknowledge on a matter so intimate. When they say they know all about\nit, they are grievously mistaken. No love story (outside of novels) is\never told truly. In the first place, the parties themselves do not tell\nall. They may say they do, but there are some things which neither man\nnor woman ever tells. In the heart of love there is a Holy of Holies\ninto which the most intimate friend is not allowed to look.",
        "And in the second place, even the lovers do not see things alike. If\nboth really understood, there could be no misunderstanding. It\nis, then, presumptive for even the confidants, and much more for the\ngeneral public, to claim to know too much of a lovers’ quarrel.",
        "We would gladly pass over this event were it not that certain salient\nfacts are a matter of public record. It is certain that Lincoln became\nengaged to Miss Todd in the year 1840. It is certain that he broke the\nengagement on January 1, 1841. It is certain that about that time he\nhad a horrible attack of melancholy. And we have seen that he never\noutgrew his attachment to his early love, Ann Rutledge. Whether this\nmelancholy was the cause of his breaking the engagement, or was caused\nby it, we cannot say. Whether the memory of Ann Rutledge had any\ninfluence in the matter, we do not know.",
        "Whatever the mental cause of this melancholy, there is no doubt that it\nhad also a physical cause. This was his most violent attack, but by no\nmeans his only one. It recurred, with greater or less severity, all\nthrough his life. He had been born and had grown up in a climate noted\nfor its malaria. Excepting for the facts that he spent much time in the\nopen air, had abundant exercise, and ate plain food, the laws of\nsanitation were not thought of. It would be strange if his system were\nnot full of malaria, or, what is only slightly less abominable, of the\nmedicines used to counteract it. In either case he would be subject to\ndepression. An unfortunate occurrence in a love affair, coming at the\ntime of an attack of melancholy, would doubtless bear abundant and\nbitter fruit.",
        "Certain it is that the engagement was broken, not a little to the\nchagrin of both parties. But a kind neighbor, Mrs. Francis, whose\nhusband was editor of the Springfield Journal, interposed with her\nfriendly offices. She invited the two lovers to her house, and they\nwent, each without the knowledge that the other was to be there. Their\nsocial converse was thus renewed, and, in the company of a third\nperson, Miss Jayne, they continued to meet at frequent intervals. Among\nthe admirers of Miss Todd were two young men who came to be widely\nknown. These were Douglas and Shields. With the latter only we are\nconcerned now. He was a red-headed little Irishman, with a peppery\ntemper, the whole being set off with an inordinate vanity. He must have\nhad genuine ability in some directions, or else he was wonderfully\nlucky, for he was an officeholder of some kind or other, in different\nstates of the Union, nearly all his life. It is doubtful if another\nperson can be named who held as many different offices as he; certainly\nno other man has ever represented so many different states in the\nsenate.",
        "At this particular time, Shields was auditor of the state of Illinois.\nThe finances of the state were in a shocking condition. The state banks\nwere not a success, and the currency was nearly worthless. At the same\ntime, it was the only money current, and it was the money of the state.\nThese being the circumstances, the governor, auditor, and treasurer,\nissued a circular forbidding the payment of state taxes in this paper\ncurrency of the state. This was clearly an outrage upon the taxpayers.",
        "Against this Lincoln protested. Not by serious argument, but by the\nmerciless satire which he knew so well how to use upon occasion. Under\nthe pseudonym of Aunt Rebecca, he wrote a letter to the Springfield\nJournal. The letter was written in the style of Josh Billings,\nand purported to come from a widow residing in the “Lost Townships.” It\nwas an attempt to laugh down the unjust measure, and in pursuance of\nthis the writer plied Shields with ridicule. The town was convulsed\nwith laughter, and Shields with fury. The wrath of the little Irishman\nwas funnier than the letter, and the joy of the neighbors increased.",
        "Miss Todd and Miss Jayne entered into the spirit of the fun. Then they\nwrote a letter in which Aunt Rebecca proposed to soothe his injured\nfeelings by accepting Shields as her husband. This was followed by a\ndoggerel rhyme celebrating the event.",
        "Shields’ fury knew no bounds. He went to Francis, the editor of the\nJournal, and demanded the name of the author of the letters.\nFrancis consulted with Lincoln. The latter was unwilling to permit any\nodium to fall on the ladies, and sent word to Shields that he would\nhold himself responsible for those letters.",
        "If Shields had not been precisely the kind of a man he was, the matter\nmight have been explained and settled amicably. But no, he must have\nblood. He sent an insulting and peremptory challenge. When Lincoln\nbecame convinced that a duel was necessary, he exercised his right, as\nthe challenged party, of choosing the weapons. He selected “broadswords\nof the largest size.” This was another triumph of humor. The midget of\nan Irishman was to be pitted against the giant of six feet four inches,\nwho possessed the strength of a Hercules, and the weapons were–\n“broadswords of the largest size.”",
        "The bloody party repaired to Alton, and thence to an island or sand-bar\non the Missouri side of the river. There a reconciliation was effected,\nhonor was satisfied all around, and they returned home in good spirits.\nFor some reason Lincoln was always ashamed of this farce. Why, we do\nnot know. It may have been because he was drawn into a situation in\nwhich there was a possibility of his shedding human blood. And he who\nwas too tender-hearted to shoot wild game could not make light of that\nsituation.",
        "The engagement between Lincoln and Miss Todd was renewed, and they were\nquietly married at the home of the bride’s sister, Mrs. Edwards,\nNovember 4th, 1842. Lincoln made a loyal, true, indulgent husband. Mrs.\nLincoln made a home that was hospitable, cultured, unostentatious. They\nlived together until the death of the husband, more than twenty-two\nyears later.",
        "They had four children, all boys. Only the eldest, Robert Todd Lincoln,\ngrew to manhood. He has had a career which is, to say the least,\ncreditable to the name he bears. For a few months at the close of the\nwar he was on the staff of General Grant. He was Secretary of War\nunder Garfield and retained the office through the administration of\nArthur. Under President Harrison, from 1889 to 1893, he was minister to\nEngland. He is a lawyer by profession, residing in Chicago–the city\nthat loved his father–and at the present writing is president of the\nPullman Company. In every position he has occupied he has exercised a\nnotably wide influence.",
