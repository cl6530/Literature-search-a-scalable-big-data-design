        "I think I was about 18 years of age when I decided that I would be a\nmiller, with flour on my clothes and a salary of $200 per month. This was\nnot the first thing I had decided to be, and afterward changed my mind\nabout.",
        "I engaged to learn my profession of a man called Sam Newton, I believe; at\nleast I will call him that for the sake of argument. My business was to\nweigh wheat, deduct as much as possible on account of cockle, pigeon grass\nand wild buckwheat, and to chisel the honest farmer out of all he would\nstand. This was the programme with Mr. Newton; but I am happy to say that\nit met with its reward, and the sheriff afterward operated the mill.",
        "On stormy days I did the book-keeping, with a scoop shovel behind my ear,\nin a pile of middlings on the fifth floor. Gradually I drifted into doing\na good deal of this kind of brain work. I would chop the ice out of the\nturbine wheel at 5 o’clock A.M., and then frolic up six flights of stairs\nand shovel shorts till 9 o’clock P.M.",
        "By shoveling bran and other vegetables 16 hours a day, a general knowledge\nof the milling business may be readily obtained. I used to scoop middlings\ntill I could see stars, and then I would look out at the landscape and\nponder.",
        "I got so that I piled up more ponder, after a while, than I did middlings.",
        "One day the proprietor came up stairs and discovered me in a brown study,\nwhereupon he cursed me in a subdued Presbyterian way, abbreviated my\nsalary from $26 per month to $18 and reduced me to the ranks.",
        "Afterward I got together enough desultory information so that I could\nsuperintend the feed stone. The feed stone is used to grind hen feed and\nother luxuries. One day I noticed an odor that reminded me of a hot\novershoe trying to smother a glue factory at the close of a tropical day.\nI spoke to the chief floor walker of the mill about it, and he said “dod\ngammit” or something that sounded like that, in a course and brutal\nmanner. He then kicked my person in a rude and hurried tone of voice, and\ntold me that the feed stone was burning up.",
        "He was a very fierce man, with a violent and ungovernable temper, and,\nfinding that I was only increasing his brutal fury, I afterward resigned\nmy position. I talked it over with the proprietor, and both agreed that it\nwould be best. He agreed to it before I did, and rather hurried up my\ndetermination to go.",
        "I rather hated to go so soon, but he made it an object for me to go, and I\nwent. I started in with the idea that I would begin at the bottom of the\nladder, as it were, and gradually climb to the bran bin by my own\nexertions, hoping by honesty, industry, and carrying two bushels of wheat\nup nine flights of stairs, to become a wealthy man, with corn meal in my\nhair and cracked wheat in my coat pocket, but I did not seem to accomplish\nit.",
        "Instead of having ink on my fingers and a chastened look of woe on my\nclear-cut Grecian features, I might have poured No. 1 hard wheat and\nbuckwheat flour out of my long taper ears every night, if I had stuck to\nthe profession. Still, as I say, it was for another man’s best good that I\nresigned. The head miller had no control over himself and the proprietor\nhad rather set his heart on my resignation, so it was better that way.",
        "Still I like to roll around in the bran pile, and monkey in the cracked\nwheat. I love also to go out in the kitchen and put corn meal down the\nback of the cook’s neck while my wife is working a purple silk Kensington\ndog, with navy blue mane and tail, on a gothic lambrequin.",
        "I can never cease to hanker for the rumble and grumble of the busy mill,\nand the solemn murmur of the millstones and the machinery are music to me.\nMore so than the solemn murmur of the proprietor used to be when he came\nin at an inopportune moment, and in that impromptu and extemporaneous\nmanner of his, and found me admiring the wild and beautiful scenery. He\nmay have been a good miller, but he had no love for the beautiful. Perhaps\nthat is why he was always so cold and cruel toward me. My slender, willowy\ngrace and mellow, bird-like voice never seemed to melt his stony heart.",
