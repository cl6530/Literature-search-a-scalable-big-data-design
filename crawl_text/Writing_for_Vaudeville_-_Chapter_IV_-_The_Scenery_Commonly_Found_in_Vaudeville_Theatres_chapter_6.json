        "In every vaudeville theatre there is an Olio and, although the\nscene which it is designed to represent may be different in each\nhouse, the street Olio is common enough to be counted as universally\nused.  Usually there are two drops in “One,” either of which may\nbe the Olio, and one of them is likely to represent a street, while\nthe other is pretty sure to be a palace scene.",
        "Usually in Four–and sometimes in Three–there are to be found in\nnearly every vaudeville theatre two different drops, which with\ntheir matching wings [1] form the two common “open sets\"–or scenes\ncomposed merely of a rear drop and side wings, and not boxed in.",
        "[1] A wing is a double frame of wood covered with painted canvas\nand set to stand as this book will when its covers are opened at\nright angles to each other.",
        "The Wood Set consists of a drop painted to represent the interior\nof a wood or forest, with wings painted in the same style.  It is\nused for knock-about acts, clown acts, bicycle acts, animal turns\nand other acts that require a deep stage and can play in this sort\nof scene.",
        "The Palace Set, with its drop and wings, is painted to represent\nthe interior of a palace.  It is used for dancing acts, acrobats\nand other acts that require a deep stage and can appropriately\nplay in a palace scene.",
        "A “box set” is, as the name implies, a set of scenery that is\nbox-shaped.  It represents a room seen through the fourth wall,\nwhich has been removed.  Sometimes with a, ceiling-piece, but\nalmost invariably with “borders\"–which are painted canvas strips\nhanging in front of the “border-lights” to mask them and keep the\naudience from seeing the ropes and pulleys hanging from the\ngridiron–the box set more nearly mimics reality than the open\nset, which calls upon the imagination of the audience to supply\nthe realities that are entirely lacking or only hinted at.",
        "The painted canvas units which are assembled to make the box set\nare called “flats.”  A flat is a wooden frame about six feet six\ninches wide and from twelve to eighteen feet long, covered with\ncanvas and, of course, painted with any scene desired.  It differs\nfrom a wing in being only one-half the double frame; therefore it\ncannot stand alone.",
        "Upon the upper end of each flat along the unpainted outer edge\nthere is fastened a rope as long as the flat.  Two-thirds of the\nway up from the bottom of the corresponding edge of the matching\nflat there is a “cleat,” or metal strip, into which the rope, or\n“lash-line” is snapped.  The two flats are then drawn tight together\nso that their edges match evenly and the lash-line is lashed through\nthe framework to hold the flats firmly together.",
        "While one flat may be a painted wall, the next may contain a doorway\nand door, another a part of an ornamental arch, and still another\na window, so, when the various flats are assembled and set, the\nbox set will have the appearance of a room containing doors and\nwindows and even ornamental arches.  The most varied scenes can\nthus be realistically set up.",
        "In the rear of open doors there are usually wings, or perhaps\nflats, [1] painted to represent the walls of hallways and adjoining\nrooms and they are called “interior backings.”  Behind a door\nsupposed to open out into the street or behind windows overlooking\nthe country, there are hung, or set, short drops or wings painted\nto show parts of a street, a garden, or a country-side, and these\nare called “exterior backings.”",
        "[1] When flats are used as backings they are made stable by the\nuse of the stage-brace, a device made of wood and capable of\nextension, after the manner of the legs of a camera tripod.  It\nis fitted with double metal hooks on one end to hook into the\nwooden cross-bar on the back of the flat and with metal eyes on\nthe other end through which stage-screws are inserted and screwed\ninto the floor of the stage.",
        "The Centre-door Fancy is the most common of the box sets.  Called\n“fancy,” because it has an arch with portieres and a rich-looking\nbacking, and because it is supposed to lead into the other palatial\nrooms of the house, this set can be used for a less pretentious\nscene by the substitution of a matched door for the arch.",
        "In this plainer form it is called simply The Parlor Set.  Sometimes\na parlor set is equipped with a French window, but this should not\nbe counted on.  But there are usually a grate and mantelpiece, and\nthree doors.  The doors are designed to be set, one in the rear\nwall, and one in each of the right and left walls.  A ceiling-piece\nis rarely found, but borders are always to be had, and a chandelier\nis customary.",
        "The Kitchen Set is, as the name implies, less pretentious than\nthe changeable parlor set.  It usually is equipped with three\ndoors, possesses matching borders, may have an ordinary window,\nand often has a fireplace panel.",
        "Slightly altered in appearance, by changing the positions of the\ndoors and the not very common substitution of a “half-glass door\"\nin the rear wall, the kitchen set does duty as The Office Set.",
        "It is in these two box sets–changed in minor details to serve as\nfour sets–that the vaudeville playlet is played.",
        "On the following pages will be found eight diagrams showing how\nthe stock or house box sets can be set in various forms.  A study\nof these will show how two different acts using the same house set\ncan be given surroundings that appear absolutely different.  These\ndiagrams should prove of great help to the playlet writer who\nwishes to know how many doors he may use, where they are placed\nand how his act will fit and play in a regulation set of scenery.",
        "The following diagrams, showing the scenic equipment of the average\nvaudeville theatre, have been specially drawn for this volume and\nare used here by courtesy of the Lee Lash Studios, New York.  As\nthey are drawn to a scale of one-eighth of an inch to the foot,\nthe precise size of the various scenes may be calculated.",
        "The diagrams are based on the average vaudeville stage, which\nallows thirty or thirty-two feet between tormentors.  The proscenium\narch may be much greater, but the average vaudeville stage will\nset the tormentors about thirty feet apart.  All vaudeville stage\nsettings are made back of the tormentor line.",
        "At the tormentor line there will be, of course, a Grand Drapery\nand Working Drapery which will mask the first entrance overhead.",
        "There will be either a set of borders for each scene, or else the\nborders will be painted to use with any scene, to mask the stage\nrigging.  The borders are usually hung from six to seven feet\napart, so that in planning a scene this should be considered.  In\na few of the larger houses, a ceiling-piece is found, but, as has\nbeen said, this is so rare it should not be counted on.",
        "Most houses have a floor cloth, and medallion or carpet, in addition\nto the properties hereafter described.  Reference to the diagrams\nwill show that the tormentors have a “flipper,” which runs to the\nproscenium arch wall; in the flipper is usually a door or a curtained\nopening for the entrances and exits of acts in One.",
        "If you will combine with the diagrams shown these elements which\ncannot be diagrammed, you will have a clear idea of the way in\nwhich any scene is constructed.  Then if you will imagine the scene\nyou have in mind as being set up on a stage like that of the Palace\nTheatre, shown in the last chapter, you will have a working\nunderstanding of the vaudeville stage.",
        "A well-ordered vaudeville stage, as has been described, possesses\nDrops for use in One, one or more Fancy Interiors, a Kitchen Set,\nand Exterior Sets.  The Drops in One are omitted from these diagrams,\nbecause they would be represented merely by a line drawn behind\nthe tormentors.",
        "The Fancy Interiors may include a Light Fancy, a Dark Fancy, an\nOak Interior, and a Plain Chamber set.  As the differences are\nlargely of painting, the usual Centre-door Fancy is taken as the\nbasis for the variations–five different ways of setting it are\nshown.",
        "Two out of the many different ways of setting the Kitchen Set are\ngiven.",
        "The Exterior Set allows little or no variation; the only thing\nthat can be done is to place balustrades, vases, etc., in different\npositions on the stage; therefore but one diagram is supplied.",
        "DIAGRAM I.–FANCY INTERIOR No. 1",
        "Showing the usual method of setting a “Fancy.”  It may be made\nshallower by omitting a wing on either side.",
        "DIAGRAM II.–FANCY INTERIOR No. 2",
        "The double arch is thrown from the centre to the side, the landscape\ndrop being used to back the scene–the drop may be seen through\nthe window on stage-left.  The window of the Fancy Interior is\nalways of the French type, opening full to the floor.",
        "DIAGRAM III.–FANCY INTERIOR No. 3",
        "This is a deeper and narrower set, approximating more closely a\nroom in an ordinary house.  The double arch at the rear may be\nbacked with an interior backing or a conservatory backing.  If the\ninterior backing is used, the conservatory backing may be used to\nback the single four-foot arch at stage-left.",
        "DIAGRAM IV.–FANCY INTERIOR No. 4",
        "This shows the double arch flanked by a single arch on each side,\nmaking three large openings looking out on the conservatory drop.",
        "DIAGRAM V.–FANCY INTERIOR No. 5",
        "The fireplace is here brought into prominence by setting it in a\ncorner with two “jogs” on each side.  The window is backed with a\nlandscape or garden drop as desired.",
        "DIAGRAM VI.–KITCHEN SET No. 1",
        "This arrangement of a Kitchen Set makes use of three doors,\nemphasizing the double doors in the centre of rear wall, which\nopen out on an interior backing or a wood or garden drop.  In this\nand the following setting a small window can be fitted into the\nupper half of either of the single doors.",
        "DIAGRAM VII.–KITCHEN SET No. 2",
        "Two doors only are used in this setting; the double doors, in the\nsame relative position as in the preceding arrangement, open out\non a wood or landscape backing.  The fireplace is brought out on\nstage-right.  The single door on stage-left opens on an interior\nbacking.",
        "DIAGRAM VIII.–WOOD OR GARDEN SET",
        "Many theatres have two sets of Exterior wings–one of Wood Wings\nand one of Garden Wings.  In some houses the Wood Wings are used\nwith the Garden Drop, set vases and balustrades being used to\nproduce the garden effect, as shown here.  Some theatres also have\na Set House and Set Cottage, which may be placed on either side\nof the stage; each has a practical door and a practical window.\nWith the Set House and Set Tree slight variations of exterior\nsettings may be contrived.",
        "4. Properties",
        "In the argot of the stage the word “property” or “prop” means any\narticle–aside from scenery–necessary for the proper mounting or\npresentation of a play.  A property may be a set of furniture, a\nrug, a pair of portieres, a picture for the wall, a telephone, a\nkitchen range or a stew-pan–indeed, anything a tall that is not\nscenery, although serving to complete the effect and illusion of\na scene.",
        "Furniture is usually of only two kinds in a vaudeville playhouse.\nThere is a set of parlor furniture to go with the parlor set and\na set of kitchen furniture to furnish the kitchen set.  But, while\nthese are all that are at the immediate command of the property-man,\nhe is usually permitted to exchange tickets for the theatre with\nany dealer willing to lend needed sets of furniture, such as a\ndesk or other office equipment specially required for the use of\nan act.",
        "In this way the sets of furniture in the property room may be\nexpanded with temporary additions into combinations of infinite\nvariety.  But, it is wise not to ask for anything out of the\nordinary, for many theatre owners frown upon bills for hauling,\neven though the rent of the furniture may be only a pair of seats.",
        "For the same reason, it is unwise to specify in the property-list–\nwhich is a printed list of the properties each act requires–anything\nin the way of rugs that is unusual.  Though some theatres have\nmore than two kinds of rugs, the white bear rug and the carpet rug\nare the most common.  It is also unwise to ask for pictures to\nhang on the walls.  If a picture is required, one is usually\nsupplied set upon an easel.",
        "Of course, every theatre is equipped with prop telephones and sets\nof dishes and silver for dinner scenes.  But there are few vaudeville\nhouses in the country that have on hand a bed for the stage,\nalthough the sofa is commonly found.",
        "A buffet, or sideboard, fully equipped with pitchers and wine\nglasses, is customary in every vaudeville property room.  And\nchampagne is supplied in advertising bottles which “pop” and sparkle\nnone the less realistically because the content is merely ginger\nale.",
        "While the foregoing is not an exhaustive list of what the property\nroom of a vaudeville theatre may contain, it gives the essential\nproperties that are commonly found.  Thus every ordinary requirement\nof the usual vaudeville act can be supplied.",
        "The special properties that an act may require must be carried by\nthe act.  For instance, if a playlet is laid in an artist’s studio\nthere are all sorts of odds and ends that would lend a realistic\neffect to the scene.  A painter’s easel, bowls of paint brushes,\na palette, half-finished pictures to hang on the walls, oriental\ndraperies, a model’s throne, and half a dozen rugs to spread upon\nthe floor, would lend an atmosphere of charming bohemian realism.",
        "Special Sound-Effects fall under the same common-sense rule.\nFor, while all vaudeville theatres have glass crashes, wood crashes,\nslap-sticks, thunder sheets, cocoanut shells for horses’ hoof-beats,\nand revolvers to be fired off-stage, they could not be expected\nto supply such little-called-for effects as realistic battle sounds,\nvolcanic eruptions, and like effects.",
        "If an act depends on illusions for its appeal, it will, of course,\nbe well supplied with the machinery to produce the required sounds.\nAnd those that do not depend on exactness of illusion can usually\nsecure the effects required by calling on the drummer with his\nvery effective box-of-tricks to help out the property-man.",
        "At the electrical switchboard centre all the lights of the theatre,\nas well as those of the stage itself.  Presided over by the\nelectrician, the switchboard, so far as the stage and its light\neffects are concerned, commands two classes of lights.  The first\nof these is the arc light and the second the electric bulb.",
        "The Spot-lights are the lamps that depend upon the arc for their\nillumination.  If you have ever sat in the gallery of any theatre,\nand particularly of a vaudeville theatre, you certainly have noticed\nthe very busy young man whose sole purpose in life appears to be\nto follow the heroine around the stage with the focused spot of\nlight that shines like a halo about her.  The lamp with which he\naccomplishes this difficult feat is appropriately called a\n“spot-light.”  While there are often spot-lights on the electrician’s\n“bridge,” as his balcony is called, the gallery out front is the\nsurest place to find the spot-light.",
        "The Footlights are electric bulbs dyed amber, blue, and red–\nor any other special shade desired–beside the well-known white,\nset in a tin trough sunk in the stage and masked to shine only\nupon the stage.  By causing only one group of colors to light,\nthe electrician can secure all sorts of variations, and with the\naid of “dimmers” permit the lights to shine brilliantly or merely\nto glow with faint radiance.",
        "The Border-lights are electric bulbs of varying colors set in\ntin troughs a little longer than the proscenium opening and are\nsuspended above the stage behind the scenery borders.  They shine\nonly downward.  There are border-lights just in front of the drops\nin One, Two, Three and Four, and they take the names of “first\nborder-light,” “second border-light,” and so on from the drops\nthey illuminate.",
        "Strip-lights are electric bulbs set in short strips of tin\ntroughs, that are equipped with hooks by which they can be hung\nbehind doors and out-of-the-way dark places in sets to illuminate\nthe backings.",
        "A Bunch-light is a box of tin set on a standard, which can be\nmoved about the stage the length of its electric cord, and has ten\nor twelve electric bulbs inside that cast a brilliant illumination\nwherever it is especially desired.  Squares of gelatine in metal\nframes can be slipped into the grooves in front of the bunch-light\nto make the light any color or shade desired.  These boxes are\nespecially valuable in giving the effect of blazing sunlight just\noutside the doors or windows of a set, or to shine through the\nwindows in the soft hue of moonlight.",
        "Grate Logs are found in nearly every vaudeville house and are\nmerely iron painted to represent logs of wood, inside of which are\nconcealed lamps that shine up through red gelatine, simulating the\nglow of a wood fire shining in the fireplace under the mantelpiece\nusually found in the centre-door-fancy set.",
        "Special Light-effects have advanced so remarkably with the science\nof stage illumination that practically any effect of nature may\nbe secured.  If the producer wishes to show the water rippling on\nthe river drop there is a “ripple-lamp” at his command, which is\na clock-actuated mechanism that slowly revolves a ripple glass in\nfront of a “spot-lamp” and casts a realistic effect of water\nrippling in the moonlight.",
        "By these mechanical means, as well as others, the moon or the sun\ncan be made to shine through a drop and give the effect of rising\nor of setting, volcanos can be made to pour forth blazing lava and\na hundred other amazing effects can be obtained.  In fact, the\nmodern vaudeville stage is honeycombed with trapdoors and overhung\nwith arching light-bridges, through which and from which all manner\nof lights can be thrown upon the stage, either to illuminate the\nfaces of the actors with striking effect, or to cast strange and\nbeautiful effects upon the scenery.  Indeed, there is nothing to\nbe seen in nature that the electrician cannot reproduce upon the\nstage with marvellous fidelity and pleasing effect.",
        "But the purpose here, as in explaining all the other physical\ndepartments of the vaudeville stage, is not to tell what has been\ndone and what can be done, interesting and instructive as such a\ndiscussion would be, but to describe what is usually to be found in\na vaudeville theatre.  The effects that are at ready command are\nthe only effects that should interest anyone about to write for\nvaudeville.  As was emphasized in the discussion of scenery, the\nwriter should not depend for success on the unusual.  His aim\nshould be to make use of the common stage-effects that are found on\nevery vaudeville stage–if, indeed, he depends on any effects at all.",
        "Here, then, we have made the acquaintance of the physical proportions\nand aspects of the vaudeville stage and have inquired into all the\ndepartments that contribute to the successful presentation of a\nvaudeville entertainment.  We have examined the vaudeville writer’s\ntool-box and have learned to know the uses for which each tool of\nspace, scenery, property, and light is specially designed.  And\nby learning what these tools can do, we have also learned what\nthey cannot do.",
        "Now let us turn to the plans and specifications–called manuscripts–\nthat go to make up the entertaining ten or forty minutes during which\na vaudeville act calls upon these physical aids to make it live\nupon the mimic stage, as though it were a breathing reality of the\ngreat stage of life.",
