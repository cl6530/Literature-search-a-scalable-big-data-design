        "I",
        "The Syrian awoke from a dream that a myriad faces were looking into his\nown, eager, attentive and horrible, in his corner of the roof-top, and\nsat up sweating and gasping aloud for breath. For an instant he thought\nthat he was really dying, and that the spiritual world was about him.\nThen, as he struggled, sense came back, and he stood up, drawing long\nbreaths of the stifling night air.",
        "Above him the sky was as the pit, black and empty; there was not a\nglimmer of light, though the moon was surely up. He had seen her four\nhours before, a red sickle, swing slowly out from Thabor. Across the\nplain, as he looked from the parapet, there was nothing. For a few yards\nthere lay across the broken ground a single crooked lance of light from\na half-closed shutter; and beneath that, nothing. To the north again,\nnothing; to the west a glimmer, pale as a moth’s wing, from the\nhouse-roofs of Nazareth; to the east, nothing. He might be on a\ntower-top in space, except for that line of light and that grey glimmer\nthat evaded the eye.",
        "On the roof, however, it was possible to make out at least outlines, for\nthe dormer trap had been left open at the head of the stairs, and from\nsomewhere within the depths of the house there stole up a faint\nrefracted light.",
        "There was a white bundle in that corner; that would be the pillow of the\nBenedictine abbot. He had seen him lay himself down there some time–was\nit four hours or four centuries ago? There was a grey shape stretched\nalong that pale wall–the Friar, he thought; there were other irregular\noutlines breaking the face of the parapet, here and there along the\nsides.",
        "Very softly, for he knew the caprices of sleep, he stepped across the\npaved roof to the opposite parapet and looked over, for there yet hung\nabout him a desire for reassurance that he was still in company with\nflesh and blood. Yes, indeed he was still on earth; for there was a real\nand distinct light burning among the tumbled rocks, and beside it,\ndelicate as a miniature, the head and shoulders of a man, writing. And\nin the circle of light were other figures, pale, broken patches on which\nmen lay; a pole or two, erected with the thought of a tent to follow; a\nlittle pile of luggage with a rug across it; and beyond the circle other\noutlines and shapes faded away into the stupendous blackness.",
        "Then the writing man moved his head, and a monstrous shadow fled across\nthe ground; a yelp as of a strangling dog broke out suddenly close\nbehind him, and, as he turned, a moaning figure sat up on the roof,\nsobbing itself awake. Another moved at the sound, and then as, sighing,\nthe former relapsed heavily against the wall, once more the priest went\nback to his place, still doubtful as to the reality of all that he saw,\nand the breathless silence came down again as a pall.",
        "He woke again from dreamless sleep, and there was a change. From his\ncorner, as he raised his heavy eyes, there met them what seemed an\nunbearable brightness; then, as he looked, it resolved itself into a\ncandle-flame, and beyond it a white sleeve, and higher yet a white face\nand throat. He understood, and rose reeling; it was the messenger come\nto fetch him as had been arranged.",
        "As he passed across the space, once he looked round him, and it seemed\nthat the dawn must have come, for that appalling sky overhead was\nvisible at last. An enormous vault, smoke-coloured and opaque, seemed to\ncurve away to the ghostly horizons on either side where the far-away\nhills raised sharp shapes as if cut in paper. Carmel was before him; at\nleast he thought it was that–a bull head and shoulders thrusting itself\nforward and ending in an abrupt descent, and beyond that again the\nglimmering sky. There were no clouds, no outlines to break the huge,\nsmooth, dusky dome beneath the centre of which this house-roof seemed\npoised. Across the parapet, as he glanced to the right before descending\nthe steps, stretched Esdraelon, sad-coloured and sombre, into the\nmetallic distance. It was all as unreal as some fantastic picture by one\nwho had never looked upon clear sunlight. The silence was complete and\nprofound.",
        "Straight down through the wheeling shadows he went, following the\nwhite-hooded head and figure down the stairs, along the tiny passage,\nstumbling once against the feet of one who slept with limbs tossed loose\nlike a tired dog; the feet drew back mechanically, and a little moan\nbroke from the shadows. Then he went on, passing the servant who stood\naside, and entered.",
        "There were half-a-dozen men gathered here, silent, white figures\nstanding apart one from the other, who genuflected as the Pope came in\nsimultaneously through the opposite door, and again stood white-faced\nand attentive. He ran his eyes over them as he stopped, waiting behind\nhis master’s chair–there were two he knew, remembering them from last\nnight–dark-faced Cardinal Ruspoli, and the lean Australian Archbishop,\nbesides Cardinal Corkran, who stood by his chair at the Pope’s own\ntable, with papers laid ready.",
        "Silvester sat down, and with a little gesture caused the others to sit\ntoo. Then He began at once in that quiet tired voice that his servant\nknew so well.",
        "“Eminences-we are all here, I think. We need lose no more time, then....\nCardinal Corkran has something to communicate–-” He turned a little.\n“Father, sit down, if you please. This will occupy a little while.”",
        "The priest went across to the stone window-seat, whence he could watch\nthe Pope’s face in the light of the two candles that now stood on the\ntable between him and the Cardinal-Secretary. Then the Cardinal began,\nglancing up from his papers.",
        "“Holiness. I had better begin a little way back. Their Eminences have\nnot heard the details properly....",
        "“I received at Damascus, on last Friday week, inquiries from various\nprelates in different parts of the world, as to the actual measure\nconcerning the new policy of persecution. At first I could tell them\nnothing positively, for it was not until after twenty o’clock that\nCardinal Ruspoli, in Turin, informed me of the facts. Cardinal Malpas\nconfirmed them a few minutes later, and the Cardinal Archbishop of Pekin\nat twenty-three. Before mid-day on Saturday I received final\nconfirmation from my messengers in London.",
        "“I was at first surprised that Cardinal Dolgorovski did not communicate\nit; for almost simultaneously with the Turin message I received one from\na priest of the Order of Christ Crucified in Moscow, to which, of\ncourse, I paid no attention. (It is our rule, Eminences, to treat\nunauthorised communications in that way.) His Holiness, however, bade me\nmake inquiries, and I learned from Father Petrovoski and others that the\nGovernment placards published the news at twenty o’clock–by our time.\nIt was curious, therefore, that the Cardinal had not seen it; if he had\nseen it, it was, of course, his duty to acquaint me immediately.",
        "“Since that time, however, the following facts have come out. It is\nestablished beyond a doubt that Cardinal Dolgorovski received a visitor\nin the course of the evening. His own chaplain, who, your Eminences are\nperhaps aware, has been very active in Russia on behalf of the Church,\ninforms me of this privately. Yet the Cardinal asserts, in explanation\nof his silence, that he was alone during those hours, and had given\norders that no one was to be admitted to his presence without urgent\ncause. This, of course, confirmed His Holiness’s opinion, but I received\norders from Him to act as if nothing had happened, and to command the\nCardinal’s presence here with the rest of the Sacred College. To this I\nreceived an intimation that he would be present. Yesterday, however, a\nlittle before mid-day, I received a further message that his Eminency\nhad met with a slight accident, but that he yet hoped to present himself\nin time for the deliberations. Since then no further news has arrived.”",
        "There was a dead silence.",
        "Then the Pope turned to the Syrian priest.",
        "“Father,” he said, “it was you who received his Eminency’s messages.\nHave you anything to add to this?”",
        "“No, Holiness.”",
        "He turned again.",
        "“My son,” he said, “report to Us publicly what you have already\nreported to Us in private.”",
        "A small, bright-eyed man moved out of the shadows.",
        "“Holiness, it was I who conveyed the message to Cardinal Dolgorovski. He\nrefused at first to receive me. When I reached his presence and\ncommunicated the command he was silent; then he smiled; then he told me\nto carry back the message that he would obey.”",
        "Again the Pope was silent.",
        "Then suddenly the tall Australian stood up.",
        "“Holiness,” he said, “I was once intimate with that man. It was partly\nthrough my means that he sought reception into the Catholic Church. This\nwas not less than fourteen years ago, when the fortunes of the Church\nseemed about to prosper.... Our friendly relations ceased two years ago,\nand I may say that, from what I know of him, I find no difficulty in\nbelieving–-”",
        "As his voice shook with passion and he faltered, Silvester raised his\nhand.",
        "“We desire no recriminations. Even the evidence is now useless, for what\nwas to be done has been done. For ourselves, we have no doubt as to its\nnature.... It was to this man that Christ gave the morsel through our\nhands, saying Quod faces, fac cities. Cum ergo accepisset Me buccellam,\nexivit continuo. Erat autem nox.“",
        "Again fell the silence, and in the pause sounded a long half-vocal sigh\nfrom without the door. It came and went as a sleeper turned, for the\npassage was crowded with exhausted men–as a soul might sigh that passed\nfrom light to darkness.",
        "Then Silvester spoke again. And as He spoke He began, as if\nmechanically, to tear up a long paper, written with lists of names, that\nlay before Him.",
        "“Eminences, it is three hours after dawn. In two hours more We shall say\nmass in your presence, and give Holy Communion. During those two hours\nWe commission you to communicate this news to all who are assembled\nhere; and further, We bestow on each and all of you jurisdiction apart\nfrom all previous rules of time and place; we give a Plenary Indulgence\nto all who confess and communicate this day. Father–” he turned to the\nSyrian–\"Father, you will now expose the Blessed Sacrament in the\nchapel, after which you will proceed to the village and inform the\ninhabitants that if they wish to save their lives they had best be gone\nimmediately–immediately, you understand.”",
        "The Syrian started from his daze.",
        "“Holiness,” he stammered, stretching out a hand, “the lists, the lists!”",
        "(He had seen what these were.)",
        "But Silvester only smiled as He tossed the fragments on to the table.\nThen He stood up.",
        "“You need not trouble, my son.... We shall not need these any more....",
        "“One last word, Eminences.... If there is one heart here that doubts or\nis afraid, I have a word to say.”",
        "He paused, with an extraordinarily simple deliberateness, ran the eyes\nround the tense faces turned to Him.",
        "“I have had a Vision of God,” He said softly. “I walk no more by faith,\nbut by sight.”",
