        "I must have fallen asleep from exhaustion. When I awoke\nI was very hungry, and after busying myself searching\nfor fruit for a while, I set off through the jungle to\nfind the beach. I knew that the island was not so large\nbut that I could easily find the sea if I did but move\nin a straight line, but there came the difficulty as there\nwas no way in which I could direct my course and hold it,\nthe sun, of course, being always directly above my head,\nand the trees so thickly set that I could see no distant\nobject which might serve to guide me in a straight line.",
        "As it was I must have walked for a great distance since I\nate four times and slept twice before I reached the sea,\nbut at last I did so, and my pleasure at the sight of it\nwas greatly enhanced by the chance discovery of a hidden\ncanoe among the bushes through which I had stumbled just\nprior to coming upon the beach.",
        "I can tell you that it did not take me long to pull\nthat awkward craft down to the water and shove it far\nout from shore. My experience with Ja had taught me that\nif I were to steal another canoe I must be quick about\nit and get far beyond the owner’s reach as soon as possible.",
        "I must have come out upon the opposite side of the\nisland from that at which Ja and I had entered it,\nfor the mainland was nowhere in sight. For a long time I\npaddled around the shore, though well out, before I saw\nthe mainland in the distance. At the sight of it I lost\nno time in directing my course toward it, for I had long\nsince made up my mind to return to Phutra and give myself\nup that I might be once more with Perry and Ghak the Hairy One.",
        "I felt that I was a fool ever to have attempted to\nescape alone, especially in view of the fact that our\nplans were already well formulated to make a break for\nfreedom together. Of course I realized that the chances\nof the success of our proposed venture were slim indeed,\nbut I knew that I never could enjoy freedom without\nPerry so long as the old man lived, and I had learned\nthat the probability that I might find him was less than slight.",
        "Had Perry been dead, I should gladly have pitted my\nstrength and wit against the savage and primordial world\nin which I found myself. I could have lived in seclusion\nwithin some rocky cave until I had found the means to\noutfit myself with the crude weapons of the Stone Age,\nand then set out in search of her whose image had now\nbecome the constant companion of my waking hours,\nand the central and beloved figure of my dreams.",
        "But, to the best of my knowledge, Perry still lived\nand it was my duty and wish to be again with him, that we\nmight share the dangers and vicissitudes of the strange\nworld we had discovered. And Ghak, too; the great,\nshaggy man had found a place in the hearts of us both,\nfor he was indeed every inch a man and king.\nUncouth, perhaps, and brutal, too, if judged too harshly\nby the standards of effete twentieth- century civilization,\nbut withal noble, dignified, chivalrous, and loveable.",
        "Chance carried me to the very beach upon which I\nhad discovered Ja’s canoe, and a short time later I\nwas scrambling up the steep bank to retrace my steps\nfrom the plain of Phutra. But my troubles came when I\nentered the canyon beyond the summit, for here I found\nthat several of them centered at the point where I\ncrossed the divide, and which one I had traversed\nto reach the pass I could not for the life of me remember.",
        "It was all a matter of chance and so I set off down\nthat which seemed the easiest going, and in this I made\nthe same mistake that many of us do in selecting the path\nalong which we shall follow out the course of our lives,\nand again learned that it is not always best to follow\nthe line of least resistance.",
        "By the time I had eaten eight meals and slept twice\nI was convinced that I was upon the wrong trail,\nfor between Phutra and the inland sea I had not slept\nat all, and had eaten but once. To retrace my steps\nto the summit of the divide and explore another canyon\nseemed the only solution of my problem, but a sudden\nwidening and levelness of the canyon just before me seemed\nto suggest that it was about to open into a level country,\nand with the lure of discovery strong upon me I decided\nto proceed but a short distance farther before I turned back.",
        "The next turn of the canyon brought me to its mouth,\nand before me I saw a narrow plain leading down to an ocean.\nAt my right the side of the canyon continued to the\nwater’s edge, the valley lying to my left, and the foot\nof it running gradually into the sea, where it formed\na broad level beach.",
        "Clumps of strange trees dotted the landscape here and there\nalmost to the water, and rank grass and ferns grew between.\nFrom the nature of the vegetation I was convinced that\nthe land between the ocean and the foothills was swampy,\nthough directly before me it seemed dry enough all the\nway to the sandy strip along which the restless waters\nadvanced and retreated.",
        "Curiosity prompted me to walk down to the beach,\nfor the scene was very beautiful. As I passed along\nbeside the deep and tangled vegetation of the swamp I\nthought that I saw a movement of the ferns at my left,\nbut though I stopped a moment to look it was not repeated,\nand if anything lay hid there my eyes could not penetrate\nthe dense foliage to discern it.",
        "Presently I stood upon the beach looking out over the\nwide and lonely sea across whose forbidding bosom no\nhuman being had yet ventured, to discover what strange\nand mysterious lands lay beyond, or what its invisible\nislands held of riches, wonders, or adventure.\nWhat savage faces, what fierce and formidable beasts were\nthis very instant watching the lapping of the waves upon\nits farther shore! How far did it extend? Perry had told\nme that the seas of Pellucidar were small in comparison\nwith those of the outer crust, but even so this great ocean\nmight stretch its broad expanse for thousands of miles.\nFor countless ages it had rolled up and down its countless\nmiles of shore, and yet today it remained all unknown\nbeyond the tiny strip that was visible from its beaches.",
        "The fascination of speculation was strong upon me.\nIt was as though I had been carried back to the birth\ntime of our own outer world to look upon its lands and\nseas ages before man had traversed either. Here was a\nnew world, all untouched. It called to me to explore it.\nI was dreaming of the excitement and adventure which lay\nbefore us could Perry and I but escape the Mahars,\nwhen something, a slight noise I imagine, drew my attention\nbehind me.",
        "As I turned, romance, adventure, and discovery in the\nabstract took wing before the terrible embodiment of all\nthree in concrete form that I beheld advancing upon me.",
        "A huge, slimy amphibian it was, with toad-like body and the\nmighty jaws of an alligator. Its immense carcass must have\nweighed tons, and yet it moved swiftly and silently toward me.\nUpon one hand was the bluff that ran from the canyon to the sea,\non the other the fearsome swamp from which the creature\nhad sneaked upon me, behind lay the mighty untracked sea,\nand before me in the center of the narrow way that led\nto safety stood this huge mountain of terrible and menacing flesh.",
        "A single glance at the thing was sufficient to assure me\nthat I was facing one of those long-extinct, prehistoric\ncreatures whose fossilized remains are found within\nthe outer crust as far back as the Triassic formation,\na gigantic labyrinthodon. And there I was, unarmed, and,\nwith the exception of a loin cloth, as naked as I had come\ninto the world. I could imagine how my first ancestor\nfelt that distant, prehistoric morn that he encountered\nfor the first time the terrifying progenitor of the thing\nthat had me cornered now beside the restless, mysterious sea.",
        "Unquestionably he had escaped, or I should not have been\nwithin Pellucidar or elsewhere, and I wished at that moment\nthat he had handed down to me with the various attributes\nthat I presumed I have inherited from him, the specific\napplication of the instinct of self-preservation which saved\nhim from the fate which loomed so close before me today.",
        "To seek escape in the swamp or in the ocean would have been\nsimilar to jumping into a den of lions to escape one upon\nthe outside. The sea and swamp both were doubtless alive\nwith these mighty, carnivorous amphibians, and if not,\nthe individual that menaced me would pursue me into either\nthe sea or the swamp with equal facility.",
        "There seemed nothing to do but stand supinely and await my end.\nI thought of Perry—how he would wonder what had become of me.\nI thought of my friends of the outer world, and of how they\nall would go on living their lives in total ignorance\nof the strange and terrible fate that had overtaken me,\nor unguessing the weird surroundings which had witnessed\nthe last frightful agony of my extinction. And with these\nthoughts came a realization of how unimportant to the life\nand happiness of the world is the existence of any one of us.\nWe may be snuffed out without an instant’s warning, and for\na brief day our friends speak of us with subdued voices.\nThe following morning, while the first worm is busily\nengaged in testing the construction of our coffin,\nthey are teeing up for the first hole to suffer more\nacute sorrow over a sliced ball than they did over our,\nto us, untimely demise. The labyrinthodon was coming\nmore slowly now. He seemed to realize that escape for me\nwas impossible, and I could have sworn that his huge,\nfanged jaws grinned in pleasurable appreciation of\nmy predicament, or was it in anticipation of the juicy\nmorsel which would so soon be pulp between those\nformidable teeth?",
        "He was about fifty feet from me when I heard a voice\ncalling to me from the direction of the bluff at my left.\nI looked and could have shouted in delight at the sight\nthat met my eyes, for there stood Ja, waving frantically\nto me, and urging me to run for it to the cliff’s base.",
        "I had no idea that I should escape the monster that had\nmarked me for his breakfast, but at least I should not\ndie alone. Human eyes would watch me end. It was cold\ncomfort I presume, but yet I derived some slight peace\nof mind from the contemplation of it.",
        "To run seemed ridiculous, especially toward that steep\nand unscalable cliff, and yet I did so, and as I ran I\nsaw Ja, agile as a monkey, crawl down the precipitous\nface of the rocks, clinging to small projections, and the\ntough creepers that had found root-hold here and there.",
        "The labyrinthodon evidently thought that Ja was coming\nto double his portion of human flesh, so he was in no\nhaste to pursue me to the cliff and frighten away this\nother tidbit. Instead he merely trotted along behind me.",
        "As I approached the foot of the cliff I saw what Ja intended\ndoing, but I doubted if the thing would prove successful.\nHe had come down to within twenty feet of the bottom,\nand there, clinging with one hand to a small ledge,\nand with his feet resting, precariously upon tiny bushes\nthat grew from the solid face of the rock, he lowered\nthe point of his long spear until it hung some six feet\nabove the ground.",
        "To clamber up that slim shaft without dragging Ja down\nand precipitating both to the same doom from which the\ncopper-colored one was attempting to save me seemed\nutterly impossible, and as I came near the spear I told\nJa so, and that I could not risk him to try to save myself.",
        "But he insisted that he knew what he was doing and was\nin no danger himself.",
        "“The danger is still yours,” he called, “for unless you\nmove much more rapidly than you are now, the sithic\nwill be upon you and drag you back before ever you\nare halfway up the spear—he can rear up and reach\nyou with ease anywhere below where I stand.”",
        "Well, Ja should know his own business, I thought, and so I\ngrasped the spear and clambered up toward the red man\nas rapidly as I could—being so far removed from my simian\nancestors as I am. I imagine the slow-witted sithic,\nas Ja called him, suddenly realized our intentions and\nthat he was quite likely to lose all his meal instead\nof having it doubled as he had hoped.",
        "When he saw me clambering up that spear he let out a hiss\nthat fairly shook the ground, and came charging after me\nat a terrific rate. I had reached the top of the spear\nby this time, or almost; another six inches would give\nme a hold on Ja’s hand, when I felt a sudden wrench from\nbelow and glancing fearfully downward saw the mighty jaws\nof the monster close on the sharp point of the weapon.",
        "I made a frantic effort to reach Ja’s hand, the sithic\ngave a tremendous tug that came near to jerking Ja\nfrom his frail hold on the surface of the rock,\nthe spear slipped from his fingers, and still clinging\nto it I plunged feet foremost toward my executioner.",
        "At the instant that he felt the spear come away from Ja’s\nhand the creature must have opened his huge jaws to catch me,\nfor when I came down, still clinging to the butt end\nof the weapon, the point yet rested in his mouth and the\nresult was that the sharpened end transfixed his lower jaw.",
        "With the pain he snapped his mouth closed.\nI fell upon his snout, lost my hold upon the spear,\nrolled the length of his face and head, across his\nshort neck onto his broad back and from there to the ground.",
        "Scarce had I touched the earth than I was upon my feet,\ndashing madly for the path by which I had entered this\nhorrible valley. A glance over my shoulder showed me\nthe sithic engaged in pawing at the spear stuck through\nhis lower jaw, and so busily engaged did he remain in this\noccupation that I had gained the safety of the cliff top\nbefore he was ready to take up the pursuit. When he did\nnot discover me in sight within the valley he dashed,\nhissing into the rank vegetation of the swamp and that was\nthe last I saw of him.",
