        "Oh! what a song the Wild Geese sang that year! How their trumpet clang\nwent thrilling in his heart, to smite there new and hidden chords that\nstirred and sang response. Was there ever a nobler bird than that\ngreat black-necked Swan, that sings not at his death, but in his flood\nof life, a song of home and of peace–of stirring deeds and hunting\nin far-off climes–of hungerings and food, and raging thirsts to meet\nwith cooling drink. A song of wind and marching, a song of bursting\ngreen and grinding ice–of Arctic secrets and of hidden ways. A song\nof a long black marsh, a low red sky, and a sun that never sets.",
        "An Indian jailed for theft bore bravely through the winter, but when\nthe springtime brought the Gander-clang in the black night sky, he\nstarted, fell, and had gone to his last, long, hunting home.",
        "Who can tell why Jericho should fall at the trumpet blast?",
        "Who can read or measure the power of the Honker-song?",
        "Oh, what a song the Wild Geese sang that year! And yet, was it a new\nsong? No, the old, old song, but Yan heard it with new ears. He was\nlearning to read its message. He wandered on their trailless track, as\noften as he could, northward, ever northward, up the river from the\ntown, and up, seeking the loneliest ways and days. The river turned to\nthe east, but a small stream ran into it from the north: up that Yan\nwent through thickening woods and walls that neared each other, on and\nup until the walls closed to a crack, then widened out into a little\ndale that was still full of original forest trees. Hemlock, Pine,\nBirch and Elm of the largest size abounded and spread over the clear\nbrook a continuous shade. Fox vines trailed in the open places, the\nrarest wild-flowers flourished, Red-squirrels chattered from the\ntrees. In the mud along the brook-side were tracks of Coon and Mink\nand other strange fourfoots. And in the trees overhead, the Veery, the\nHermit-thrush, or even a Woodthrush sang his sweetly solemn strain, in\nthat golden twilight of the midday forest. Yan did not know them all\nby name as yet, but he felt their vague charm and mystery. It seemed\nsuch a far and lonely place, so unspoiled by man, that Yan persuaded\nhimself that surely he was the first human being to stand there, that\nit was his by right of discovery, and so he claimed it and named it\nafter its discoverer–Glenyan.",
        "This place became the central thought in his life. He went there at\nall opportunities, but never dared to tell any one of his discovery.\nHe longed for a confidant sometimes, he hankered to meet the stranger\nand take him there, and still he feared that the secret would get out.\nThis was his little kingdom; the Wild Geese had brought him here, as\nthe Seagulls had brought Columbus to a new world–where he could lead,\nfor brief spells, the woodland life that was his ideal. He was tender\nenough to weep over the downfall of a lot of fine Elm trees in town,\nwhen their field was sold for building purposes, and he used to suffer\na sort of hungry regret when old settlers told how plentiful the Deer\nused to be. But now he had a relief from these sorrows, for surely\nthere was one place where the great trees should stand and grow as in\nthe bright bygone; where the Coon, the Mink and the Partridge should\nlive and flourish forever. No, indeed, no one else should know of it,\nfor if the secret got out, at least hosts of visitors would come and\nGlenyan be defiled. No, better that the secret should “die with him,\"\nhe said. What that meant he did not really know, but he had read the\nphrase somewhere and he liked the sound of it. Possibly he would\nreveal it on his deathbed.",
        "Yes, that was the proper thing, and he pictured a harrowing scene of\nweeping relatives around, himself as central figure, all ceasing their\nwailing and gasping with wonder as he made known the mighty secret of\nhis life–delicious! it was almost worth dying for.",
        "So he kept the place to himself and loved it more and more. He would\nlook out through the thick Hemlock tops, the blots of Basswood green\nor the criss-cross Butternut leafage and say: “My own, my own.” Or\ndown by some pool in the limpid stream he would sit and watch the\narrowy Shiners and say: “You are mine, all; you are mine. You shall\nnever be harmed or driven away.”",
        "A spring came from the hillside by a green lawn, and here Yan would\neat his sandwiches varied with nuts and berries that he did not like,\nbut ate only because he was a wildman, and would look lovingly up the\nshady brookland stretches and down to the narrow entrance of the glen,\nand say and think and feel. “This is mine, my own, my very own.”",
