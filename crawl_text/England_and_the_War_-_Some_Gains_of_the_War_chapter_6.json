        "An Address to the Royal Colonial Institute, February 13, 1918\nOur losses in this War continue to be enormous, and we are not yet near\nto the end. So it may seem absurd to speak of our gains, of gains that\nwe have already achieved. But if you will look at the thing in a large\nlight, I think you will see that it is not absurd.",
        "I do not speak of gains of territory, and prisoners, and booty. It is\ntrue that we have taken from the Germans about a million square miles of\nland in Africa, where land is cheap. We have taken more prisoners from\nthem than they have taken from us, and we have whole parks of German\nartillery to set over against the battered and broken remnants of\nBritish field-guns which were exhibited in Berlin–a monument to the\nimmortal valour of the little old Army. I am speaking rather of gains\nwhich cannot be counted as guns are counted, or measured as land is\nmeasured, but which are none the less real and important.",
        "The Germans have achieved certain great material gains in this War, and\nthey are fighting now to hold them. If they fail to hold them, the\nGermany of the war-lords is ruined. She will have to give up all her\nbloated ambitions, to purge and live cleanly, and painfully to\nreconstruct her prosperity on a quieter and sounder basis. She will not\ndo this until she is forced to it by defeat. No doubt there are moderate\nand sensible men in Germany, as in other countries; but in Germany they\nare without influence, and can do nothing. War is the national industry\nof Prussia; Prussia has knit together the several states of the larger\nGermany by means of war, and has promised them prosperity and power in\nthe future, to be achieved by war. You know the Prussian doctrine of\nwar. Every one now knows it. According to that doctrine it is a foolish\nthing for a nation to wait till it is attacked. It should carefully\ncalculate its own strength and the strength of its neighbours, and, when\nit is ready, it should attack them, on any pretext, suddenly, without\nwarning, and should take from them money and land. When it has gained\nterritory in this fashion, it should subject the population of the\nconquered territory to the strictest laws of military service, and so\nsupply itself with an instrument for new and bolder aggression. This is\nnot only the German doctrine; it is the German practice. In this way and\nno other modern Germany has been built up. It is a huge new State,\nfounded on force, cemented by fear, and financed on speculative gains to\nbe derived from the great gamble of war. You may have noticed that the\nGerman people have not been called on, as yet, to pay any considerable\nsum in taxation towards the expenses of this war. Those expenses (that,\nat least, was the original idea) were to be borne wholly by the\nconquered enemy. There are hundreds of thousands of Germans to-day who\nfirmly believe that their war-lords will return in triumph from the\nstricken field, bringing with them the spoils of war, and scattering a\nlargess of peace and plenty.",
        "To us it seems a marvel that any people should accept such a doctrine,\nand should willingly give their lives and their fortunes to the work of\ncarrying it out in practice; but it is not so marvellous as it seems.\nThe German peoples are brave and obedient, and so make good soldiers;\nthey are easily lured by the hope of profit; they are naturally\nattracted by the spectacular and sentimental side of war; above all,\nthey are so curiously stupid that many of them do actually believe that\nthey are a divinely chosen race, superior to the other races of the\nworld. They are very carefully educated, and their education, which is\nordered by the State, is part of the military machine. Their thinking is\ndone for them by officials. It would require an extraordinary degree of\ncourage and independence for a German youth to cut himself loose and\nbegin thinking and judging for himself. It must always be remembered,\nmoreover, that their recent history seems to justify their creed. I will\nnot go back to Frederick the Great, though the history of his wars is\nthe Prussian handbook, which teaches all the characteristic Prussian\nmethods of treachery and deceit. But consider only the last two German\nwars. How, in the face of these, can it be proved to any German that war\nis not the most profitable of adventures? In 1866 Prussia had war with\nAustria. The war lasted forty days, and Prussia had from five to six\nthousand soldiers killed in action. As a consequence of the war Prussia\ngained much territory, and established her control over the states of\ngreater Germany. In 1870 she had war with France. Her total casualties\nin that war were approximately a hundred thousand, just about the same\nas our casualties in Gallipoli. From the war she gained, besides a great\nincrease of strength at home, the rich provinces of Alsace and Lorraine,\nwith all their mineral wealth, and an indemnity of two hundred million\npounds, that is to say, four times the actual cost of the war in money.\nHow then can it be maintained that war is not good business? If you say\nso to any Prussian, he thinks you are talking like a child.",
        "Not only were these two wars rich in profit for the Germans, but they\ndid not lose them much esteem. There was sympathy in this country for\nthe union of the German peoples, just as there was sympathy, a few years\nearlier, for the union of the various states of Italy. There was not a\nlittle admiration for German efficiency and strength. So that Bismarck,\nwho was an expert in all the uses of bullying, blackmail, and fraud, was\naccepted as a great European statesman. I have always believed, and I\nstill believe, that Germany will have to pay a heavy price for\nBismarck–all the heavier because the payment has been so long deferred.",
        "The present War, then, is in the direct line of succession to these\nformer wars; it was planned by Germany, elaborately and deliberately\nplanned, on a calculation of the profits to be derived from operations\non a large scale.",
        "Well, as I said, we, as a people, do not believe in gambling in human\nmisery to attain uncertain speculative gains. We hold that war can be\njustified only by a good cause, not by a lucky event. The German\ndoctrine seems to us impious and wicked. Though we have defined our war\naims in detail, and the Germans have not dared publicly to define\ntheirs, our real and sufficient war aim is to break the monstrous and\ninhuman doctrine and practice of the enemy–to make their calculations\nmiscarry. And observe, if their calculations miscarry, they have fought\nand suffered for nothing. They entered into this War for profit, and in\nthe conduct of the War, though they have made many mistakes, they have\nmade none of those generous and magnanimous mistakes which redeem and\nbeautify a losing cause.",
        "The essence of our cause, and its greatest strength, is that we are not\nfighting for profit. We are fighting for no privilege except the\nprivilege of possessing our souls, of being ourselves–a privilege which\nwe claim also for other weaker nations. The inestimable strength of that\nposition is that if the odds are against us it does not matter. If you\nsee a ruffian torturing a child, and interfere to prevent him, do you\nfeel that your attempt was a wrong one because he knocks you down? And\nif you succeed, what material profit is there in saving a child from\ntorture? We have sometimes fought in the past for doubtful causes and\nfor wrong causes, but this time there is no mistake. Our cause is better\nthan we deserve; we embraced it by an act of faith, and it is only by\ncontinuing in that faith that we shall see it through. The little old\nArmy, when they went to France in August 1914, did not ask what profits\nwere likely to come their way. They knew that there were none, but they\nwere willing to sacrifice themselves to save decency and humanity from\nbeing trampled in the mud. This was the Army that the Germans called a\nmercenary Army, and its epitaph has been written by a good poet:",
        "     These, in the day when heaven was falling,\n     The hour when earth’s foundations fled,\n     Followed their mercenary calling,\n     And took their wages, and are dead.",
        "     Their shoulders held the heavens suspended,\n     They stood, and earth’s foundations stay,\n     What God abandoned these defended,\n     And saved the sum of things for pay.",
        "We must follow their example, for we shall never get a better. We must\nnot make too much of calculation, especially when it deals with\nincalculable things. Nervous public critics, like Mr. H.G. Wells, are\nalways calling out for more cleverness in our methods, for new and\neffective tricks, so that we may win the War. I would never disparage\ncleverness; the more you can get of it, the better; but it is useless\nunless it is in the service of something stronger and greater than\nitself, and that is character. Cleverness can grasp; it is only\ncharacter that can hold. The Duke of Wellington was not a clever man; he\nwas a man of simple and honourable mind, with an infinite capacity for\npatience, persistence, and endurance, so that neither unexpected\nreverses abroad nor a flood of idle criticism at home could shake him or\nchange him. So he bore a chief part in laying low the last great tyranny\nthat desolated Europe.",
        "None of our great wars was won by cleverness; they were all won by\nresolution and perseverance. In all of them we were near to despair and\ndid not despair. In all of them we won through to victory in the end.",
        "But in none of them did victory come in the expected shape. The worst of\nmaking elaborate plans of victory, and programmes of all that is to\nfollow victory, is that the mixed event is sure to defeat those plans.\nNot every war finds its decision in a single great battle. Think of our\nwar with Spain in the sixteenth century. Spain was then the greatest of\nEuropean Powers. She had larger armies than we could raise; she had\nmore than our wealth, and more than our shipping. The newly discovered\ncontinent of America was an appanage of Spain, and her great galleons\nwere wafted lazily to and fro, bringing her all the treasures of the\nwestern hemisphere. We defeated her by standing out and holding on. We\nfought her in the Low Countries, which she enslaved and oppressed. We\nrefused to recognize her exclusive rights in America, and our merchant\nseamen kept the sea undaunted, as they have kept it for the last three\nyears. When at last we became an intolerable vexation to Spain, she\ncollected a great Armada, or war-fleet, to invade and destroy us; and it\nwas shattered, by the winds of heaven and the sailors of England, in\n1588. The defeat of the Armada was the turning-point of the war, but it\nwas not the end. It lifted a great shadow of fear from the hearts of the\npeople, as a great shadow of fear has already been lifted from their\nhearts in the present War, but during the years that followed we\nsuffered many and serious reverses at the hand of Spain, before peace\nand security were reached. So late as 1601, thirteen years after the\ndefeat of the Armada, the King of Denmark offered to mediate between\nEngland and Spain, so that the long and disastrous war might be ended.\nQueen Elizabeth was then old and frail, but this was what she said–and\nif you want to understand why she was almost adored by her people,\nlisten to her words: ’I would have the King of Denmark, and all Princes\nChristian and Heathen to know, that England hath no need to crave peace;\nnor myself endured one hour’s fear since I attained the crown thereof,\nbeing guarded with so valiant and faithful subjects.’ In the end the\npower and menace of Spain faded away, and when peace was made, in 1604,\nthis nation never again, from that day to this, feared the worst that\nSpain could do.",
        "What were our gains from the war with Spain? Freedom to live our lives\nin our own way, unthreatened; freedom to colonize America. The gains of\na great war are never visible immediately; they are deferred, and\nextended over many years. What did we gain by our war with Napoleon,\nwhich ended in the victory of Waterloo? For long years after Waterloo\nthis country was full of riots and discontents; there were\nrick-burnings, agitations, popular risings, and something very near to\nfamine in the land. But all these things, from a distance, are now seen\nto have been the broken water that follows the passage of a great storm.\nThe real gains of Waterloo, and still more of Trafalgar, are evident in\nthe enormous commercial and industrial development of England during the\nnineteenth century, and in the peaceful foundation of the great\ndominions of Canada, Australia, and South Africa, which was made\npossible only by our unchallenged use of the seas. The men who won those\ntwo great battles did not live to gather the fruits of their victory;\nbut their children did. If we defeat Germany as completely as we hope,\nwe shall not be able to point at once to our gains. But it is not a rash\nforecast to say that our children and children’s children will live in\ngreater security and freedom than we have ever tasted.",
        "A man must have a good and wide imagination if he is to be willing to\nface wounds and death for the sake of his unborn descendants and\nkinsfolk. We cannot count on the popular imagination being equal to the\ntask. Fortunately, there is a substitute for imagination which does the\nwork as well or better, and that is character. Our people are sound in\ninstinct; they understand a fight. They know that a wrestler who\nconsiders, while he is in the grip of his adversary, whether he would\nnot do well to give over, and so put an end to the weariness and the\nstrain, is no sort of a wrestler. They have never failed under a strain\nof this kind, and they will not fail now. The people who do the\nhalf-hearted and timid talking are either young egotists, who are angry\nat being deprived of their personal ease and independence; or elderly\npensive gentlemen, in public offices and clubs, who are no longer fit\nfor action, and, being denied action, fall into melancholy; or feverish\njournalists, who live on the proceeds of excitement, who feel the pulse\nand take the temperature of the War every morning, and then rush into\nthe street to announce their fluttering hopes and fears; or cosmopolitan\nphilosophers, to whom the change from London to Berlin means nothing but\na change in diet and a pleasant addition to their opportunities of\nhearing good music; or aliens in heart, to whom the historic fame of\nEngland, ’dear for her reputation through the world,’ is less than\nnothing; or practical jokers, who are calm and confident enough\nthemselves, but delight in startling and depressing others. These are\nnot the people of England; they are the parasites of the people of\nEngland. The people of England understand a fight.",
        "That brings me to the first great gain of the War. We have found\nourselves. Which of us, in the early months of 1914, would have dared\nto predict the splendours of the youth of this Empire–splendours which\nare now a part of our history? We are adepts at self-criticism and\nself-depreciation. We hate the language of emotion. Some of us, if we\nwere taken to heaven and asked what we thought of it, would say that it\nis decent, or not so bad. I suppose we are jealous to keep our standard\nhigh, and to have something to say if a better place should be found.\nBut in spite of all this, we do now know, and it is worth knowing, that\nwe are not weaker than our fathers. We know that the people who inhabit\nthese islands and this commonwealth of nations cannot be pushed on one\nside, or driven under, or denied a great share in the future ordering of\nthe world. We know this, and our knowledge of it is the debt that we owe\nto our dead. It is not vanity to admit that we know it; on the contrary,\nit would be vanity to pretend that we do not know it. It is visible to\nother eyes than ours. Some time ago I heard an address given by a friend\nof mine, an Indian Mohammedan of warrior descent, to University students\nof his own faith. He was urging on them the futility of dreams and the\nnecessity of self-discipline and self-devotion. ’Why do the people of\nthis country’, he said, ’count for so much all the world over? It is not\nbecause of their dreams; it is because thousands of them are lying at\nthe bottom of the sea.’",
        "Further, we have not only found ourselves; we have found one another. A\nnew kindliness has grown up, during the War, between people divided by\nthe barriers of class, or wealth, or circumstance. A statesman of the\nseventeenth century remarks that It is a Misfortune for a Man not to\nhave a Friend in the World, but for that reason he shall have no Enemy.\nI might invert his maxim and say, It is a Misfortune for a Man to have\nmany Enemies, but for that reason he shall know who are his Friends. No\nRadical member of Parliament will again, while any of us live, cast\ncontempt on ’the carpet Captains of Mayfair’. No idle Tory talker will\nagain dare to say that the working men of England care nothing for their\ncountry. Even the manners of railway travel have improved. I was\ntravelling in a third-class compartment of a crowded train the other\nday; we were twenty in the compartment, but it seemed a pity to leave\nany one behind, and we made room for number twenty-one. Nothing but a\nvery kindly human feeling could have packed us tight enough for this.\nYet now is the time that has been chosen by some of these pensive\ngentlemen that I spoke of, and by some of these excitable journalists,\nto threaten us with class-war, and to try to make our flesh creep by\nconjuring up the horrors of revolution. I advise them to take their\nopinions to the third-class compartment and discuss them there. It is a\ngood tribunal, for, sooner or later, you will find every one there–even\nofficers, when they are travelling in mufti at their own expense. I have\nvisited this tribunal very often, and I have always come away from it\nwith the same impression, that this people means to win the War. But I\ndo not travel much in the North of England, so I asked a friend of mine,\nwhose dealings are with the industrial North, what the workpeople of\nLancashire and Yorkshire think of the War. He said, ’Their view is very\nsimple: they mean to win it; and they mean to make as much money out of\nit as ever they can.’ Certainly, that is very simple; but before you\njudge them, put yourselves in their place. There are great outcries\nagainst profiteers, for making exorbitant profits out of the War, and\nagainst munition workers, for delaying work in order to get higher\nwages. I do not defend either of them; they are unimaginative and\nselfish, and I do not care how severely they are dealt with; but I do\nsay that the majority of them are not wicked in intention. A good many\nof the more innocent profiteers are men whose sin is that they take an\noffer of two shillings rather than an offer of eighteenpence for what\ncost them one and a penny. Some of us, in our weaker moments, might be\nbetrayed into doing the same. As for the munition workers, I remember\nwhat Goldsmith, who had known the bitterest poverty, wrote to his\nbrother. ’Avarice’, he said, ’in the lower orders of mankind is true\nambition; avarice is the only ladder the poor can use to preferment.\nPreach then, my dear Sir, to your son, not the excellence of human\nnature nor the disrespect of riches, but endeavour to teach him thrift\nand economy. Let his poor wandering uncle’s example be placed in his\neyes. I had learned from books to love virtue before I was taught from\nexperience the necessity of being selfish.’",
        "The profiteers and the munition workers are endeavouring, incidentally,\nto better their own position. But make no mistake; the bulk of these\npeople would rather die than allow one spire of English grass to be\ntrodden under the foot of a foreign trespasser. Their chief sin is that\nthey do not fear. They think that there is plenty of time to do a little\nbusiness for themselves on the way to defeat the enemy. I cannot help\nremembering the mutiny at the Nore, which broke out in our fleet during\nthe Napoleonic wars. The mutineers struck for more pay and better\ntreatment, but they agreed together that if the French fleet should put\nin an appearance during the mutiny, all their claims should be postponed\nfor a time, and the French fleet should have their first attention.",
        "Employers and employed do, no doubt, find in some trades to-day that\ntheir relations are strained and irksome. They would do well to take a\nlesson from the Army, where, with very few exceptions, there is harmony\nand understanding between those who take orders and those who give them.\nIt is only in the Army that you can see realized the ideal of ancient\nRome.",
        "     Then none was for a party,\n       Then all were for the State;\n     Then the great man helped the poor,\n       And the poor man loved the great.",
        "Why is the Army so far superior to most commercial and industrial\nbusinesses? The secret does not lie in State employment. There is plenty\nof discontent and unrest among the State-employed railway men and\nmunition workers. It lies rather in the habit of mutual help and mutual\ntrust. If any civilian employer of labour wants to have willing\nworkpeople, let him take a hint from the Army. Let him live with his\nworkpeople, and share all their dangers and discomforts. Let him take\nthought for their welfare before his own, and teach self-sacrifice by\nexample. Let him put the good of the nation before all private\ninterests; and those whom he commands will do for him anything that he\nasks.",
        "I cannot believe that the benefits which have come to us from the Army\nwill pass away with the passing of the War. Those who have been comrades\nin danger will surely take with them something of the old spirit into\ncivil life. And those who have kept clear of the Army in order to carry\non their own trades and businesses will surely realize that they have\nmissed the great opportunity of their lives.",
        "In a wider sense the War has brought us to an understanding of one\nanother. This great Commonwealth of independent nations which is called\nthe British Empire is scattered over the surface of the habitable globe.\nIt embraces people who live ten thousand miles apart, and whose ways of\nlife are so different that they might seem to have nothing in common.\nBut the War has brought them together, and has done more than half a\ncentury of peace could do to promote a common understanding. Hundreds of\nthousands of men of our blood who, before the War, had never seen this\nlittle island, have now made acquaintance with it. Hundreds of thousands\nof the inhabitants of this island to whom the Dominions were strange,\nfar places, if, after the War, they should be called on to settle there,\nwill not feel that they are leaving home. I can only hope that the\nCanadians and Anzacs think as well of us as we do of them. We do not\nlike to praise our friends in their hearing, so I will say no more than\nthis: I am told that a new kind of peerage, very haughty and very\nself-important, has arisen in South London. Its members are those\nhouse-holders who have been privileged to have Anzac soldiers billeted\non them. It is private ties of this kind, invisible to the\nconstitutional lawyer and the political historian, which make the fine\nmeshes of the web of Empire.",
        "Because he knew that the strength of the whole texture depends on the\nstrength of the fine meshes, Earl Grey, who died last year, will always\nbe remembered in our history. Not many men have his opportunity to make\nacquaintance with the domain that is their birthright, for he had\nadministered a province of South Africa, and had been Governor-General\nof Canada, He rediscovered the glory of the Empire, as poets rediscover\nthe glory of common speech. ’He had breathed its air,’ a friend of his\nsays, ’fished its rivers, walked in its valleys, stood on its mountains,\nmet its people face to face. He had seen it in all the zones of the\nworld. He knew what it meant to mankind. Under the British flag,\nwherever he journeyed, he found men of English speech living in an\natmosphere of liberty and carrying on the dear domestic traditions of\nthe British Isles. He saw justice firmly planted there, industry and\ninvention hard at work unfettered by tyrants of any kind, domestic life\nprospering in natural conditions, and our old English kindness and\ncheerfulness and broad-minded tolerance keeping things together. But he\nalso saw room under that same flag, ample room, for millions and\nmillions more of the human race. The Empire wasn’t a word to him. It was\na vast, an almost boundless, home for honest men.’",
        "The War did not dishearten him. When he died, in August, 1917, he said,\n’Here I lie on my death-bed, looking clear into the Promised Land. I’m\nnot allowed to enter it, but there it is before my eyes. After the War\nthe people of this country will enter it, and those who laughed at me\nfor a dreamer will see that I wasn’t so wrong after all. But there’s\nstill work to do for those who didn’t laugh, hard work, and with much\nopposition in the way; all the same, it is work right up against the\ngoal. My dreams have come true.’",
        "One of the clear gains of the War is to be found in the increased\nactivity and alertness of our own people. The motto of to-day is, ’Let\nthose now work who never worked before, And those who always worked now\nwork the more.’ Before the War we had a great national reputation for\nidleness–in this island, at least. I remember a friendly critic from\nCanada who, some five or six years ago, expressed to me, with much\ndisquiet, his opinion that there was something very far wrong with the\nold country; that we had gone soft. As for our German critics, they\nexpressed the same view in gross and unmistakable fashion. Wit is not a\nnative product in Germany, it all has to be imported, so they could not\nsatirize us; but their caricatures of the typical Englishman showed us\nwhat they thought. He was a young weakling with a foolish face, and was\ndressed in cricketing flannels. It would have been worth their while to\nnotice what they did not notice, that his muscles and nerves are not\nsoft. They learned that later, when the bank-clerks of Manchester broke\nthe Prussian Guard into fragments at Contalmaison. This must have been a\nsad surprise, for the Germans had always taught, in their delightful\nauthoritative fashion, that the chief industries of the young Englishman\nare lawn-tennis and afternoon tea. They are a fussy people, and they\nfind it difficult to understand the calm of the man who, having nothing\nto do, does it. Perhaps they were right, and we were too idle. The\ndisease was never so serious as they thought it, and now, thanks to\nthem, we are in a fair way to recovery. The idle classes have turned\ntheir hand to the lathe and the plough. Women are doing a hundred things\nthat they never did before, and are doing them well. The elasticity and\nresourcefulness that the War has developed will not be lost or destroyed\nby the coming of peace. Least of all will those qualities be lost if we\nshould prove unable, in this War, to impose our own terms on Germany.\nThen the peace that follows will be a long struggle, and in that\nstruggle we shall prevail. In the last long peace we were not\nsuspicious; we felt friendly enough to the Germans, and we gave them\nevery advantage. They despised us for our friendliness and used the\npeace to prepare our downfall. That will never happen again. If we\ncannot tame the cunning animal that has assaulted humanity, at least we\ncan and will tether him. Laws will not be necessary; there are millions\nof others besides the seamen of England who will have no dealings with\nan unsubdued and unrepentant Germany. What the Germans are not taught by\nthe War they will have to learn in the more tedious and no less costly\nschool of peace.",
        "In any case, whether we win through to real peace and real security, or\nwhether we are thrown back on an armed peace and the duty of unbroken\nvigilance, we shall be dependent for our future on the children who are\nnow learning in the schools or playing in the streets. It is a good\ndependence. The children of to-day are better than the children whom I\nknew when I was a child. I think they have more intelligence and\nsympathy; they certainly have more public spirit. We cannot do too much\nfor them. The most that we can do is nothing to what they are going to\ndo for us, for their own nation and people. I am not concerned to\ndiscuss the education problem. Formal education, carried on chiefly by\nmeans of books, is a very small part of the making of a man or a woman.\nBut I am interested to know what the children are thinking. You cannot\nfathom a child’s thoughts, but we know who are their best teachers, and\nwhat lessons have been stamped indelibly on their minds. Their teachers,\nwhom they never saw, and whose lessons they will never forget, lie in\ngraves in Flanders and France and Gallipoli and Syria and Mesopotamia,\nor unburied at the bottom of the sea. The runner falls, but the torch is\ncarried forward. This is what Julian Grenfell, who gave his mind and his\nlife to the War, has said in his splendid poem called Into Battle:",
        "     And life is colour and warmth and light,\n     And a striving evermore for these;\n     And he is dead who will not fight,\n     And who dies fighting hath increase.",
        "Those who died fighting will have such increase that a whole new\ngeneration, better even than the old, will be ready, no long time hence,\nto uphold and extend and decorate the Commonwealth of nations which\ntheir fathers and brothers saved from ruin.",
        "One thing I have never heard discussed, but it is the clearest gain of\nall, and already it may be called a certain gain. After the War the\nEnglish language will have such a position as it has never had before.\nIt will be established in world-wide security. Even before the War, it\nmay be truly said, our language was in no danger from the competition of\nthe German language. The Germans have never had much success in the\nattempt to get their language adopted by other peoples. Not all the\nmilitary laws of Prussia can drive out French from the hearts and homes\nof the people of Alsace. In the ports of the near and far East you will\nhear English spoken–pidgin English, as it is called, that is to say, a\nselection of English words suited for the business of daily life. But\nyou may roam the world over, and you will hear no pidgin German. Before\nthe War many Germans learned English, while very few English-speaking\npeople learned German. In other matters we disagreed, but we both knew\nwhich way the wind was blowing. It may be said, and said truly, that our\nwell-known laziness was one cause of our failing or neglecting to learn\nGerman. But it was not the only cause; and we are not lazy in tasks\nwhich we believe to be worth our while. Rather we had an instinctive\nbelief that the future does not belong to the German tongue. That belief\nis not likely to be impaired by the War. Armed ruffians can do some\nthings, but one thing they cannot do; they cannot endear their language\nto those who have suffered from their violence. The Germans poisoned the\nwells in South-West Africa; in Europe they did all they could to poison\nthe wells of mutual trust and mutual understanding among civilized men.\nDo they think that these things will make a good advertisement for the\nexplosive guttural sounds and the huddled deformed syntax of the speech\nin which they express their arrogance and their hate? Which of the\nchief European languages will come first, after the War, with the little\nnations? Will Serbia be content to speak German? Will Norway and Denmark\nfeel a new affection for the speech of the men who have degraded the old\nhumanity of the seas? Neighbourhood, kinship, and the necessities of\ncommerce may retain for the German language a certain measure of custom\nin Sweden and Switzerland, and in Holland. But for the most part Germans\nwill have to be content to be addressed in their own tongue only by\nthose who fear them, or by those who hope to cheat them.",
        "This gain, which I make bold to predict for the English language, is a\nreal gain, apart from all patriotic bias. The English language is\nincomparably richer, more fluid, and more vital than the German\nlanguage. Where the German has but one way of saying a thing, we have\ntwo or three, each with its distinctions and its subtleties of usage.\nOur capital wealth is greater, and so are our powers of borrowing.\nEnglish sprang from the old Teutonic stock, and we can still coin new\nwords, such as ’food-hoard’ and ’joy-ride’, in the German fashion. But\nlong centuries ago we added thousands of Romance words, words which came\ninto English through the French or Norman-French, and brought with them\nthe ideas of Latin civilization and of mediaeval Christianity. Later on,\nwhen the renewed study of Latin and Greek quickened the intellectual\nlife of Europe, we imported thousands of Greek and Latin words direct\nfrom the ancient world, learned words, many of them, suitable for\nphilosophers, or for writers who pride themselves on shooting a little\nabove the vulgar apprehension. Yet many of these, too, have found their\nway into daily speech, so that we can say most things in three ways,\naccording as we draw on one or another of the three main sources of our\nspeech. Thus, you can Begin, or Commence, or Initiate an undertaking,\nwith Boldness, or Courage, or Resolution. If you are a Workman, or\nLabourer, or Operative, you can Ask, or Bequest, or Solicit your\nemployer to Yield, or Grant, or Concede, an increase in the Earnings, or\nWages, or Remuneration which fall to the lot of your Fellow, or\nCompanion, or Associate. Your employer is perhaps Old, or Veteran, or\nSuperannuated, which may Hinder, or Delay, or Retard the success of your\napplication. But if you Foretell, or Prophesy, or Predict that the War\nwill have an End, or Close, or Termination that shall not only be\nSpeedy, or Rapid, or Accelerated, but also Great, or Grand, or\nMagnificent, you may perhaps Stir, or Move, or Actuate him to have Ruth,\nor Pity, or Compassion on your Mate, or Colleague, or Collaborator. The\nEnglish language, then, is a language of great wealth–much greater\nwealth than can be illustrated by any brief example. But wealth is\nnothing unless you can use it. The real strength of English lies in the\ninspired freedom and variety of its syntax. There is no grammar of the\nEnglish speech which is not comic in its stiffness and inadequacy. An\nEnglish grammar does not explain all that we can do with our speech; it\nmerely explains what shackles and restraints we must put upon our speech\nif we would bring it within the comprehension of a school-bred\ngrammarian. But the speech itself is like the sea, and soon breaks down\nthe dykes built by the inland engineer. It was the fashion, in the\neighteenth century, to speak of the divine Shakespeare. The reach and\ncatholicity of his imagination was what earned him that extravagant\npraise; but his syntax has no less title to be called divine. It is not\ncast or wrought, like metal; it leaps like fire, and moves like air. So\nis every one that is born of the spirit. Our speech is our great\ncharter. Far better than in the long constitutional process whereby we\nsubjected our kings to law, and gave dignity and strength to our\nCommons, the meaning of English freedom is to be seen in the illimitable\nfreedom of our English speech.",
        "Our literature is almost as rich as our language. Modern German\nliterature begins in the eighteenth century. Modern English literature\nbegan with Chaucer, in the fourteenth century, and has been full of\ngreat names and great books ever since. Nothing has been done in German\nliterature for which we have not a counterpart, done as well or\nbetter–except the work of Heine, and Heine was a Jew. His opinion of\nthe Prussians was that they are a compost of beer, deceit, and sand.\nFrench literature and English literature can be compared, throughout\ntheir long course, sometimes to the great advantage of the French.\nGerman literature cannot seriously be compared with either.",
        "It may be objected that literature and art are ornamental affairs, which\ncount for little in the deadly strife of nations. But that is not so.\nOur language cannot go anywhere without taking our ideas and our creed\nwith it, not to mention our institutions and our games. If the Germans\ncould understand what Chaucer means when he says of his Knight that",
        "                     he lovèd chivalry,\n     Truth and honoùr, freedom and courtesy,",
        "then indeed we might be near to an understanding. I asked a good German\nscholar the other day what is the German word for ’fair play’. He\nreplied, as they do in Parliament, that he must ask for notice of that\nquestion. I fear there is no German word for ’fair play’.",
        "The little countries, the pawns and victims of German policy, understand\nour ideas better. The peoples who have suffered from tyranny and\noppression look to England for help, and it is a generous weakness in us\nthat we sometimes deceive them by our sympathy, for our power is\nlimited, and we cannot help them all. But it will not count against us\nat the final reckoning that in most places where humanity has suffered\ncruelty and indignity the name of England has been invoked: not always\nin vain.",
        "And now, for I have kept to the last what I believe to be the greatest\ngain of all, the entry of America into the War assures the triumph of\nour common language. America is peopled by many races; only a minority\nof the inhabitants–an influential and governing minority–are of the\nEnglish stock. But here, again, the language carries it; and the ideas\nthat inspire America are ideas which had their origin in the long\nEnglish struggle for freedom. Our sufferings in this War are great, but\nthey are not so great that we cannot recognize virtue in a new recruit\nto the cause. No nation, in the whole course of human history, has ever\nmade a more splendid decision, or performed a more magnanimous act, than\nAmerica, when she decided to enter this War. She had nothing to gain,\nfor, to say the bare truth, she had little to lose. If Germany were to\ndominate the world, America, no doubt, would be ruined; but in all human\nlikelihood, Germany’s impious attempt would have spent itself and been\nbroken long before it reached the coasts of America. America might have\nstood out of the War in the assurance that her own interests were safe,\nand that, when the tempest had passed, the centre of civilization would\nbe transferred from a broken and exhausted Europe to a peaceful and\nprosperous America. Some few Americans talked in this strain, and\nfavoured a decision in this sense. But it was not for nothing that\nAmerica was founded upon religion. When she saw humanity in anguish, she\ndid not pass by on the other side. Her entry into the War has put an\nend, I hope for ever, to the family quarrel, not very profound or\nsignificant, which for a century and a half has been a jarring note in\nthe relations of mother and daughter. And it has put an end to another\ndanger. It seemed at one time not unlikely that the English language as\nit is spoken overseas would set up a life of its own, and become\nseparated from the language of the old country. A development of this\nkind would be natural enough. The Boers of South Africa speak Dutch, but\nnot the Dutch spoken in Holland. The French Canadians speak French, but\nnot the French of Molière. Half a century ago, when America was\nexploring and settling her own country, in wild and lone places, her\npioneers enriched the English speech with all kinds of new and vivid\nphrases. The tendency was then for America to go her own way, and to\ncultivate what is new in language at the expense of what is old. She\nprided herself even on having a spelling of her own, and seemed almost\nwilling to break loose from tradition and to coin a new American\nEnglish.",
        "This has not happened; and now, I think, it will not happen. For one\nthing, the American colonists left us when already we had a great\nliterature. Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Spenser belong to America no less\nthan to us, and America has never forgotten them. The education which\nhas been fostered in American schools and colleges keeps the whole\nnation in touch with the past. Some of their best authors write in a\nstyle that Milton and Burke would understand and approve. There is no\nmore beautiful English prose than Nathaniel Hawthorne’s. The best\nspeeches of Abraham Lincoln, and, we may truly add, of President Wilson,\nare merely classic English. During my own lifetime I am sure I have seen\nthe speech usages of the two peoples draw closer together. For one\nthing, we on this side now borrow, and borrow very freely, the more\npicturesque colloquialisms of America. On informal occasions I sometimes\nbrighten my own speech with phrases which I think I owe to one of the\nbest of living American authors, Mr. George Ade, of Chicago, the author\nof Fables in Slang. The press, the telegraph, the telephone, and the\ngrowing habit of travel bind us closer together every year; and the\nEnglish that we speak, however rich and various it may be, is going to\nremain one and the same English, our common inheritance.",
        "One question, the most important and difficult of all, remains to be\nasked. Will this War, in its course and in its effects, tend to prevent\nor discourage later wars? If the gains that it brings prove to be merely\npartial and national gains, if it exalts one nation by unjustly\ndepressing another, and conquers cruelty by equal cruelty, then nothing\ncan be more certain than that the peace of the world is farther off than\never. When she was near her death, Edith Cavell, patriot and martyr,\nsaid that patriotism is not enough. Every one who thinks on\ninternational affairs knows this; almost every one forgets it in time of\nwar. What can be done to prevent nations from appealing to the wild\njustice of revenge?",
        "A League of Nations may do good, but I am surprised that any one who has\nimagination and a knowledge of the facts should entertain high hopes of\nit as a full solution. There is a League of Nations to-day which has\ngiven a verdict against the Central Powers, and that verdict is being\nenforced by the most terrible War in all human history. If the verdict\nhad been given before the War began, it may be said, then Germany might\nhave accepted it, and refrained. So she might, but what then? She would\nhave felt herself wronged; she would have deferred the War, and, in ways\nthat she knows so well, would have set about making a party for herself\namong the nations of the League. Who can be confident that she would\nhave failed either to divide her judges, or to accumulate such elements\nof strength that she might dare to defy them? A League of Nations would\nwork well only if its verdicts were loyally accepted by all the nations\ncomposing it. To make majority-rule possible you must have a community\nmade up of members who are reasonably well informed upon one another’s\naffairs, and who are bound together by a tie of loyalty stronger and\nmore enduring than their causes of difference. It would be a happy thing\nif the nations of the world made such a community; and the sufferings of\nthis War have brought them nearer to desiring it. But those who believe\nthat such a community can be formed to-day or to-morrow are too\nsanguine. It must not be forgotten that the very principle of the\nLeague, if its judgements are to take effect, involves a world-war in\ncases where a strong minority resists those judgements. Every war would\nbecome a world-war. Perhaps this very fact would prevent wars, but it\ncannot be said that experience favours such a conclusion.",
        "There is no escape for us by way of the Gospels. The Gospel precept to\nturn the other cheek to the aggressor was not addressed to a meeting of\ntrustees. Christianity has never shirked war, or even much disliked it.\nWhere the whole soul is set on things unseen, wounds and death become of\nless account. And if the Christians have not helped us to avoid war, how\nshould the pacifists be of use? Those of them whom I happen to know, or\nto have met, have shown themselves, in the relations of civil life, to\nbe irritable, self-willed, combative creatures, where the average\nsoldier is calm, unselfish, and placable. There is something incongruous\nand absurd in the pacifist of British descent. He has fighting in his\nblood, and when his creed, or his nervous sensibility to physical\nhorrors, denies him the use of fighting, his blood turns sour. He can\nargue, and object, and criticize, but he cannot lead. All that he can\noffer us in effect is eternal quarrels in place of occasional fights.",
        "No one can do anything to prevent war who does not recognize its\nsplendour, for it is by its splendour that it keeps its hold on\nhumanity, and persists. The wickedest and most selfish war in the world\nis not fought by wicked and selfish soldiers. The spirit of man is\nimmense, and for an old memory, a pledged word, a sense of fellowship,\noffers this frail and complicated tissue of flesh and blood, which a pin\nor a grain of sand will disorder, to be the victim of all the atrocities\nthat the wit of man can compound out of fire and steel and poison. If\nthat spirit is to be changed, or directed into new courses, it must be\nby one who understands it, and approaches it reverently, with bared\nhead.",
        "The best hope seems to me to lie in paying chief attention to the\nimprovement of war rather than to its abolition; to the decencies of the\ncraft; to the style rather than the matter. Style is often more\nimportant than matter, and this War would not have been so fierce or so\nprolonged if it had not become largely a war on a point of style, a war,\nthat is to say, to determine the question how war should be waged. If\nthe Germans had behaved humanely and considerately to the civil\npopulation of Belgium, if they had kept their solemn promise not to use\npoison-gas, if they had refrained from murder at sea, if their valour\nhad been accompanied by chivalry, the War might now have been ended,\nperhaps not in their disfavour, for it would not have been felt, as it\nnow is felt, that they must be defeated at no matter how great a cost,\nor civilization will perish.",
        "Even as things are, there have been some gains in the manner of\nconducting war, which, when future generations look back on them, will\nbe seen to be considerable. It is true that modern science has devised\nnew and appalling weapons. The invention of a new weapon in war always\narouses protest, but it does not usually, in the long run, make war more\ninhuman. There was a great outcry in Europe when the broadsword was\nsuperseded by the rapier, and a tall man of his hands could be spitted\nlike a cat or a rabbit by any dexterous little fellow with a trained\nwrist. There was a wave of indignation, which was a hundred years in\npassing, when musketry first came into use, and a man-at-arms of great\nprowess could be killed from behind a wall by one who would not have\ndared to meet him in open combat. But these changes did not, in effect,\nmake war crueller or more deadly. They gave more play to intelligence,\nand abolished the tyranny of the bully, who took the wall of every man\nhe met, and made himself a public nuisance. The introduction of\npoison-gas, which is a small thing compared with the invention of\nfire-arms, has given the chemist a place in the ranks of fighting-men.\nAnd if science has lent its aid to the destruction of life, it has spent\ngreater zeal and more prolonged effort on the saving of life. No\nprevious war will compare with this in care for the wounded and maimed.\nIn all countries, and on all fronts, an army of skilled workers devote\nthemselves to this single end. I believe that this quickening of the\nhuman conscience, for that is what it is, will prove to be the greatest\ngain of the War, and the greatest advance made in restraint of war. If\nthe nations come to recognize that their first duty, and their first\nresponsibility, is to those who give so much in their service, that\nrecognition will of itself do more than can be done by any conclave of\nstatesmen to discourage war. It was the monk Telemachus, according to\nthe old story, who stopped the gladiatorial games at Rome, and was\nstoned by the people. If war, in process of time, shall be abolished,\nor, failing that, shall be governed by the codes of humanity and\nchivalry, like a decent tournament; then the one sacrificial figure\nwhich will everywhere be honoured for the change will be the figure not\nof a priest or a politician, but of a hospital nurse.",
