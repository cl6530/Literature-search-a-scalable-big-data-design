        "Those who are esteemed umpires of taste are often\npersons who have acquired some knowledge of admired\npictures or sculptures, and have an inclination for\nwhatever is elegant; but if you inquire whether they\nare beautiful souls, and whether their own acts are\nlike fair pictures, you learn that they are selfish\nand sensual. Their cultivation is local, as if you\nshould rub a log of dry wood in one spot to produce\nfire, all the rest remaining cold. Their knowledge\nof the fine arts is some study of rules and particulars,\nor some limited judgment of color or form, which is\nexercised for amusement or for show. It is a proof of\nthe shallowness of the doctrine of beauty as it lies\nin the minds of our amateurs, that men seem to have\nlost the perception of the instant dependence of form\nupon soul. There is no doctrine of forms in our philosophy.\nWe were put into our bodies, as fire is put into a pan to\nbe carried about; but there is no accurate adjustment\nbetween the spirit and the organ, much less is the latter\nthe germination of the former. So in regard to other forms,\nthe intellectual men do not believe in any essential\ndependence of the material world on thought and volition.\nTheologians think it a pretty air-castle to talk of the\nSpiritual meaning of a ship or a cloud, of a city or a\ncontract, but they prefer to come again to the solid\nground of historical evidence; and even the poets are\ncontented with a civil and conformed manner of living,\nand to write poems from the fancy, at a safe distance\nfrom their own experience. But the highest minds of the\nworld have never ceased to explore the double meaning,\nor shall I say the quadruple or the centuple or much more\nmanifold meaning, of every sensuous fact; Orpheus,\nEmpedocles, Heraclitus, Plato, Plutarch, Dante, Swedenborg,\nand the masters of sculpture, picture, and poetry. For we\nare not pans and barrows, nor even porters of the fire\nand torch-bearers, but children of the fire, made of it,\nand only the same divinity transmuted and at two or three\nremoves, when we know least about it. And this hidden\ntruth, that the fountains whence all this river of Time\nand its creatures floweth are intrinsically ideal and\nbeautiful, draws us to the consideration of the nature\nand functions of the Poet, or the man of Beauty; to the\nmeans and materials he uses, and to the general aspect\nof the art in the present time.",
        "The breadth of the problem is great, for the poet\nis representative. He stands among partial men for\nthe complete man, and apprises us not of his wealth,\nbut of the common wealth. The young man reveres men\nof genius, because, to speak truly, they are more\nhimself than he is. They receive of the soul as he\nalso receives, but they more. Nature enhances her\nbeauty, to the eye of loving men, from their belief\nthat the poet is beholding her shows at the same time.\nHe is isolated among his contemporaries by truth and\nby his art, but with this consolation in his pursuits,\nthat they will draw all men sooner or later. For all\nmen live by truth and stand in need of expression. In\nlove, in art, in avarice, in politics, in labor, in\ngames, we study to utter our painful secret. The man\nis only half himself, the other half is his expression.",
        "Notwithstanding this necessity to be published,\nadequate expression is rare. I know not how it is\nthat we need an interpreter, but the great majority\nof men seem to be minors, who have not yet come into\npossession of their own, or mutes, who cannot report\nthe conversation they have had with nature. There is\nno man who does not anticipate a supersensual utility\nin the sun and stars, earth and water. These stand\nand wait to render him a peculiar service. But there\nis some obstruction or some excess of phlegm in our\nconstitution, which does not suffer them to yield the\ndue effect. Too feeble fall the impressions of nature\non us to make us artists. Every touch should thrill.\nEvery man should be so much an artist that he could\nreport in conversation what had befallen him. Yet, in\nour experience, the rays or appulses have sufficient\nforce to arrive at the senses, but not enough to reach\nthe quick and compel the reproduction of themselves in\nspeech. The poet is the person in whom these powers are\nin balance, the man without impediment, who sees and\nhandles that which others dream of, traverses the whole\nscale of experience, and is representative of man, in\nvirtue of being the largest power to receive and to\nimpart.",
        "For the Universe has three children, born at one\ntime, which reappear under different names in every\nsystem of thought, whether they be called cause,\noperation, and effect; or, more poetically, Jove,\nPluto, Neptune; or, theologically, the Father, the\nSpirit, and the Son; but which we will call here\nthe Knower, the Doer, and the Sayer. These stand\nrespectively for the love of truth, for the love\nof good, and for the love of beauty. These three\nare equal. Each is that which he is essentially,\nso that he cannot be surmounted or analyzed, and\neach of these three has the power of the others\nlatent in him, and his own, patent.",
        "The poet is the sayer, the namer, and represents\nbeauty. He is a sovereign, and stands on the centre.\nFor the world is not painted or adorned, but is from\nthe beginning beautiful; and God has not made some\nbeautiful things, but Beauty is the creator of the\nuniverse. Therefore the poet is not any permissive\npotentate, but is emperor in his own right. Criticism\nis infested with a cant of materialism, which assumes\nthat manual skill and activity is the first merit of\nall men, and disparages such as say and do not,\noverlooking the fact that some men, namely poets, are\nnatural sayers, sent into the world to the end of\nexpression, and confounds them with those whose province\nis action but who quit it to imitate the sayers. But\nHomer’s words are as costly and admirable to Homer as\nAgamemnon’s victories are to Agamemnon. The poet does\nnot wait for the hero or the sage, but, as they act and\nthink primarily, so he writes primarily what will and\nmust be spoken, reckoning the others, though primaries\nalso, yet, in respect to him, secondaries and servants;\nas sitters or models in the studio of a painter, or as\nassistants who bring building materials to an architect.",
        "For poetry was all written before time was, and\nwhenever we are so finely organized that we can\npenetrate into that region where the air is music,\nwe hear those primal warblings and attempt to write\nthem down, but we lose ever and anon a word or a\nverse and substitute something of our own, and thus\nmiswrite the poem. The men of more delicate ear\nwrite down these cadences more faithfully, and\nthese transcripts, though imperfect, become the songs\nof the nations. For nature is as truly beautiful as\nit is good, or as it is reasonable, and must as much\nappear as it must be done, or be known. Words and\ndeeds are quite indifferent modes of the divine energy.\nWords are also actions, and actions are a kind of words.",
        "The sign and credentials of the poet are that he\nannounces that which no man foretold. He is the\ntrue and only doctor; he knows and tells; he is\nthe only teller of news, for he was present and\nprivy to the appearance which he describes. He is\na beholder of ideas and an utterer of the necessary\nand causal. For we do not speak now of men of\npoetical talents, or of industry and skill in metre,\nbut of the true poet. I took part in a conversation\nthe other day concerning a recent writer of lyrics,\na man of subtle mind, whose head appeared to be a\nmusic-box of delicate tunes and rhythms, and whose\nskill and command of language, we could not sufficiently\npraise. But when the question arose whether he was not\nonly a lyrist but a poet, we were obliged to confess\nthat he is plainly a contemporary, not an eternal man.\nHe does not stand out of our low limitations, like a\nChimborazo under the line, running up from the torrid\nBase through all the climates of the globe, with belts\nof the herbage of every latitude on its high and mottled\nsides; but this genius is the landscape-garden of a\nmodern house, adorned with fountains and statues, with\nwell-bred men and women standing and sitting in the\nwalks and terraces. We hear, through all the varied\nmusic, the ground-tone of conventional life. Our poets\nare men of talents who sing, and not the children of\nmusic. The argument is secondary, the finish of the\nverses is primary.",
        "For it is not metres, but a metre-making argument\nthat makes a poem,—a thought so passionate and\nalive that like the spirit of a plant or an animal\nit has an architecture of its own, and adorns nature\nwith a new thing. The thought and the form are equal\nin the order of time, but in the order of genesis\nthe thought is prior to the form. The poet has a new\nthought; he has a whole new experience to unfold; he\nwill tell us how it was with him, and all men will be\nthe richer in his fortune. For the experience of each\nnew age requires a new confession, and the world seems\nalways waiting for its poet. I remember when I was\nyoung how much I was moved one morning by tidings that\ngenius had appeared in a youth who sat near me at\ntable. He had left his work and gone rambling none\nknew whither, and had written hundreds of lines, but\ncould not tell whether that which was in him was\ntherein told; he could tell nothing but that all was\nchanged,—man, beast, heaven, earth and sea. How gladly\nwe listened! how credulous! Society seemed to be\ncompromised. We sat in the aurora of a sunrise which\nwas to put out all the stars.  Boston seemed to be at\ntwice the distance it had the night before, or was\nmuch farther than that. Rome,—what was Rome? Plutarch\nand Shakspeare were in the yellow leaf, and Homer no\nmore should be heard of. It is much to know that poetry\nhas been written this very day, under this very roof,\nby your side. What! that wonderful spirit has not\nexpired! These stony moments are still sparkling and\nanimated! I had fancied that the oracles were all silent,\nand nature had spent her fires; and behold! all night,\nfrom every pore, these fine auroras have been streaming.\nEvery one has some interest in the advent of the poet,\nand no one knows how much it may concern him. We know\nthat the secret of the world is profound, but who or\nwhat shall be our interpreter, we know not. A mountain\nramble, a new style of face, a new person, may put the\nkey into our hands. Of course the value of genius to us\nis in the veracity of its report. Talent may frolic and\njuggle; genius realizes and adds. Mankind in good\nearnest have availed so far in understanding themselves\nand their work, that the foremost watchman on the peak\nannounces his news. It is the truest word ever spoken,\nand the phrase will be the fittest, most musical, and\nthe unerring voice of the world for that time.",
        "All that we call sacred history attests that the\nbirth of a poet is the principal event in chronology.\nMan, never so often deceived, still watches for the\narrival of a brother who can hold him steady to a\ntruth until he has made it his own. With what joy I\nbegin to read a poem which I confide in as an\ninspiration! And now my chains are to be broken; I\nshall mount above these clouds and opaque airs in\nwhich I live,—opaque, though they seem transparent,\n—and from the heaven of truth I shall see and\ncomprehend my relations. That will reconcile me to\nlife and renovate nature, to see trifles animated\nby a tendency, and to know what I am doing. Life will\nno more be a noise; now I shall see men and women,\nand know the signs by which they may be discerned\nfrom fools and satans. This day shall be better than\nmy birthday:  then I became an animal; now I am\ninvited into the science of the real. Such is the\nhope, but the fruition is postponed. Oftener it falls\nthat this winged man, who will carry me into the heaven,\nwhirls me into mists, then leaps and frisks about with\nme as it were from cloud to cloud, still affirming that\nhe is bound heavenward; and I, being myself a novice,\nam slow in perceiving that he does not know the way\ninto the heavens, and is merely bent that I should admire\nhis skill to rise like a fowl or a flying fish, a little\nway from the ground or the water; but the all-piercing,\nall-feeding, and ocular air of heaven that man shall\nnever inhabit. I tumble down again soon into my old nooks,\nand lead the life of exaggerations as before, and have\nlost my faith in the possibility of any guide who can\nlead me thither where I would be.",
        "But, leaving these victims of vanity, let us, with\nnew hope, observe how nature, by worthier impulses,\nhas ensured the poet’s fidelity to his office of\nannouncement and affirming, namely by the beauty of\nthings, which becomes a new and higher beauty when\nexpressed. Nature offers all her creatures to him as\na picture-language. Being used as a type, a second\nwonderful value appears in the object, far better\nthan its old value; as the carpenter’s stretched\ncord, if you hold your ear close enough, is musical\nin the breeze.  “Things more excellent than every\nimage,” says Jamblichus, “are expressed through\nimages.” Things admit of being used as symbols\nbecause nature is a symbol, in the whole, and in\nevery part. Every line we can draw in the sand has\nexpression; and there is no body without its spirit\nor genius. All form is an effect of character; all\ncondition, of the quality of the life; all harmony,\nof health; and for this reason a perception of beauty\nshould be sympathetic, or proper only to the good.\nThe beautiful rests on the foundations of the necessary.\nThe soul makes the body, as the wise Spenser teaches:—",
        "Here we find ourselves suddenly not in a critical\nspeculation but in a holy place, and should go very\nwarily and reverently. We stand before the secret\nof the world, there where Being passes into Appearance\nand Unity into Variety.",
        "The Universe is the externization of the soul.\nWherever the life is, that bursts into appearance\naround it.  Our science is sensual, and therefore\nsuperficial. The earth and the heavenly bodies,\nphysics, and chemistry, we sensually treat, as if\nthey were self-existent; but these are the retinue\nof that Being we have. “The mighty heaven,” said\nProclus, “exhibits, in its transfigurations, clear\nimages of the splendor of intellectual perceptions;\nbeing moved in conjunction with the unapparent periods\nof intellectual natures.”  Therefore science always\ngoes abreast with the just elevation of the man,\nkeeping step with religion and metaphysics; or the\nstate of science is an index of our self-knowledge.\nSince everything in nature answers to a moral power,\nif any phenomenon remains brute and dark it is that\nthe corresponding faculty in the observer is not yet\nactive.",
        "No wonder then, if these waters be so deep, that we\nhover over them with a religious regard. The beauty\nof the fable proves the importance of the sense; to\nthe poet, and to all others; or, if you please, every\nman is so far a poet as to be susceptible of these\nenchantments of nature; for all men have the thoughts\nwhereof the universe is the celebration. I find that\nthe fascination resides in the symbol. Who loves\nnature? Who does not? Is it only poets, and men of\nleisure and cultivation, who live with her? No; but\nalso hunters, farmers, grooms, and butchers, though\nthey express their affection in their choice of life\nand not in their choice of words. The writer wonders\nwhat the coachman or the hunter values in riding, in\nhorses and dogs. It is not superficial qualities. When\nyou talk with him he holds these at as slight a rate as\nyou. His worship is sympathetic; he has no definitions,\nbut he is commanded in nature, by the living power\nwhich he feels to be there present. No imitation or\nplaying of these things would content him; he loves\nthe earnest of the north wind, of rain, of stone, and\nwood, and iron. A beauty not explicable is dearer than\na beauty which we can see to the end of. It is nature\nthe symbol, nature certifying the supernatural, body\noverflowed by life which he worships with coarse but\nsincere rites.",
        "The inwardness and mystery of this attachment\ndrives men of every class to the use of emblems.\nThe schools of poets and philosophers are not more\nintoxicated with their symbols than the populace\nwith theirs. In our political parties, compute the\npower of badges and emblems. See the great ball\nwhich they roll from Baltimore to Bunker hill! In\nthe political processions, Lowell goes in a loom,\nand Lynn in a shoe, and Salem in a ship. Witness\nthe cider-barrel, the log-cabin, the hickory-stick,\nthe palmetto, and all the cognizances of party. See\nthe power of national emblems. Some stars, lilies,\nleopards, a crescent, a lion, an eagle, or other\nfigure which came into credit God knows how, on an\nold rag of bunting, blowing in the wind on a fort\nat the ends of the earth, shall make the blood tingle\nunder the rudest or the most conventional exterior.\nThe people fancy they hate poetry, and they are all\npoets and mystics!",
        "Beyond this universality of the symbolic language,\nwe are apprised of the divineness of this superior\nuse of things, whereby the world is a temple whose\nwalls are covered with emblems, pictures, and\ncommandments of the Deity,—in this, that there is\nno fact in nature which does not carry the whole\nsense of nature; and the distinctions which we make\nin events and in affairs, of low and high, honest\nand base, disappear when nature is used as a symbol.\nThought makes everything fit for use. The vocabulary\nof an omniscient man would embrace words and images\nexcluded from polite conversation. What would be\nbase, or even obscene, to the obscene, becomes\nillustrious, spoken in a new connexion of thought.\nThe piety of the Hebrew prophets purges their grossness.\nThe circumcision is an example of the power of poetry\nto raise the low and offensive. Small and mean things\nserve as well as great symbols. The meaner the type by\nwhich a law is expressed, the more pungent it is, and\nthe more lasting in the memories of men: just as we\nchoose the smallest box or case in which any needful\nutensil can be carried. Bare lists of words are found\nsuggestive to an imaginative and excited mind; as it\nis related of Lord Chatham that he was accustomed to\nread in Bailey’s Dictionary when he was preparing to\nspeak in Parliament. The poorest experience is rich\nenough for all the purposes of expressing thought. Why\ncovet a knowledge of new facts? Day and night, house\nand garden, a few books, a few actions, serve us as\nwell as would all trades and all spectacles. We are\nfar from having exhausted the significance of the few\nsymbols we use.  We can come to use them yet with a\nterrible simplicity. It does not need that a poem\nshould be long.  Every word was once a poem. Every\nnew relation is a new word. Also we use defects and\ndeformities to a sacred purpose, so expressing our\nsense that the evils of the world are such only to\nthe evil eye. In the old mythology, mythologists\nobserve, defects are ascribed to divine natures, as\nlameness to Vulcan, blindness to Cupid, and the like,\n—to signify exuberances.",
        "For as it is dislocation and detachment from the\nlife of God that makes things ugly, the poet, who\nre-attaches things to nature and the Whole,—\nre-attaching even artificial things and violations\nof nature, to nature, by a deeper insight,—disposes\nvery easily of the most disagreeable facts. Readers\nof poetry see the factory-village and the railway,\nand fancy that the poetry of the landscape is broken\nup by these; for these works of art are not yet\nconsecrated in their reading; but the poet sees them\nfall within the great Order not less than the beehive\nor the spider’s geometrical web. Nature adopts them\nvery fast into her vital circles, and the gliding\ntrain of cars she loves like her own. Besides, in a\ncentred mind, it signifies nothing how many mechanical\ninventions you exhibit. Though you add millions, and\nnever so surprising, the fact of mechanics has not\ngained a grain’s weight. The spiritual fact remains\nunalterable, by many or by few particulars; as no\nmountain is of any appreciable height to break the\ncurve of the sphere. A shrewd country-boy goes to the\ncity for the first time, and the complacent citizen\nis not satisfied with his little wonder. It is not\nthat he does not see all the fine houses and know that\nhe never saw such before, but he disposes of them as\neasily as the poet finds place for the railway. The\nchief value of the new fact is to enhance the great\nand constant fact of Life, which can dwarf any and\nevery circumstance, and to which the belt of wampum\nand the commerce of America are alike.",
        "The world being thus put under the mind for verb\nand noun, the poet is he who can articulate it.\nFor though life is great, and fascinates, and absorbs;\nand though all men are intelligent of the symbols\nthrough which it is named; yet they cannot originally\nuse them. We are symbols and inhabit symbols; workmen,\nwork, and tools, words and things, birth and death,\nall are emblems; but we sympathize with the symbols,\nand being infatuated with the economical uses of\nthings, we do not know that they are thoughts. The\npoet, by an ulterior intellectual perception, gives\nthem a power which makes their old use forgotten, and\nputs eyes and a tongue into every dumb and inanimate\nobject. He perceives the independence of the thought\non the symbol, the stability of the thought, the\naccidency and fugacity of the symbol. As the eyes of\nLyncaeus were said to see through the earth, so the\npoet turns the world to glass, and shows us all\nthings in their right series and procession. For\nthrough that better perception he stands one step\nnearer to things, and sees the flowing or metamorphosis;\nperceives that thought is multiform; that within the\nform of every creature is a force impelling it to ascend\ninto a higher form; and following with his eyes the life,\nuses the forms which express that life, and so his speech\nflows with the flowing of nature. All the facts of the\nanimal economy, sex, nutriment, gestation, birth, growth,\nare symbols of the passage of the world into the soul of\nman, to suffer there a change and reappear a new and\nhigher fact.  He uses forms according to the life, and\nnot according to the form. This is true science. The\npoet alone knows astronomy, chemistry, vegetation and\nanimation, for he does not stop at these facts, but\nemploys them as signs. He knows why the plain or meadow\nof space was strewn with these flowers we call suns and\nmoons and stars; why the great deep is adorned with\nanimals, with men, and gods; for in every word he speaks\nhe rides on them as the horses of thought.",
        "By virtue of this science the poet is the Namer\nor Language-maker, naming things sometimes after\ntheir appearance, sometimes after their essence,\nand giving to every one its own name and not\nanother’s, thereby rejoicing the intellect, which\ndelights in detachment or boundary. The poets made\nall the words, and therefore language is the\narchives of history, and, if we must say it, a\nsort of tomb of the muses.  For though the origin\nof most of our words is forgotten, each word was\nat first a stroke of genius, and obtained currency\nbecause for the moment it symbolized the world to\nthe first speaker and to the hearer.  The etymologist\nfinds the deadest word to have been once a brilliant\npicture. Language is fossil poetry.  As the limestone\nof the continent consists of infinite masses of the\nshells of animalcules, so language is made up of\nimages or tropes, which now, in their secondary use,\nhave long ceased to remind us of their poetic origin.\nBut the poet names the thing because he sees it, or\ncomes one step nearer to it than any other. This\nexpression or naming is not art, but a second nature,\ngrown out of the first, as a leaf out of a tree. What\nwe call nature is a certain self-regulated motion or\nchange; and nature does all things by her own hands,\nand does not leave another to baptize her but baptizes\nherself; and this through the metamorphosis again. I\nremember that a certain poet described it to me thus:",
        "Genius is the activity which repairs the decays\nof things, whether wholly or partly of a material\nand finite kind. Nature, through all her kingdoms,\ninsures herself. Nobody cares for planting the\npoor fungus; so she shakes down from the gills of\none agaric countless spores, any one of which,\nbeing preserved, transmits new billions of spores\nto-morrow or next day. The new agaric of this hour\nhas a chance which the old one had not. This atom\nof seed is thrown into a new place, not subject to\nthe accidents which destroyed its parent two rods\noff. She makes a man; and having brought him to\nripe age, she will no longer run the risk of losing\nthis wonder at a blow, but she detaches from him a\nnew self, that the kind may be safe from accidents\nto which the individual is exposed. So when the\nsoul of the poet has come to ripeness of thought,\nshe detaches and sends away from it its poems or\nsongs,—a fearless, sleepless, deathless progeny,\nwhich is not exposed to the accidents of the weary\nkingdom of time; a fearless, vivacious offspring,\nclad with wings (such was the virtue of the soul out\nof which they came) which carry them fast and far,\nand infix them irrecoverably into the hearts of men.\nThese wings are the beauty of the poet’s soul. The\nsongs, thus flying immortal from their mortal parent,\nare pursued by clamorous flights of censures, which\nswarm in far greater numbers and threaten to devour\nthem; but these last are not winged. At the end of a\nvery short leap they fall plump down and rot, having\nreceived from the souls out of which they came no\nbeautiful wings. But the melodies of the poet ascend\nand leap and pierce into the deeps of infinite time.",
        "So far the bard taught me, using his freer speech.\nBut nature has a higher end, in the production of\nNew individuals, than security, namely ascension,\nor the passage of the soul into higher forms. I knew\nin my younger days the sculptor who made the statue\nof the youth which stands in the public garden. He\nwas, as I remember, unable to tell directly, what\nmade him happy or unhappy, but by wonderful\nindirections he could tell. He rose one day, according\nto his habit, before the dawn, and saw the morning\nbreak, grand as the eternity out of which it came,\nand for many days after, he strove to express this\ntranquillity, and lo! his chisel had fashioned out\nof marble the form of a beautiful youth, Phosphorus,\nwhose aspect is such that it is said all persons who\nlook on it become silent. The poet also resigns\nhimself to his mood, and that thought which agitated\nhim is expressed, but alter idem, in a manner totally\nnew. The expression is organic, or the new type which\nthings themselves take when liberated. As, in the sun,\nobjects paint their images on the retina of the eye,\nso they, sharing the aspiration of the whole universe,\ntend to paint a far more delicate copy of their essence\nin his mind. Like the metamorphosis of things into\nhigher organic forms is their change into melodies.\nOver everything stands its daemon or soul, and, as\nthe form of the thing is reflected by the eye, so the\nsoul of the thing is reflected by a melody. The sea,\nthe mountain-ridge, Niagara, and every flower-bed,\npre-exist, or super-exist, in pre-cantations, which\nsail like odors in the air, and when any man goes by\nwith an ear sufficiently fine, he overhears them and\nendeavors to write down the notes without diluting or\ndepraving them. And herein is the legitimation of\ncriticism, in the mind’s faith that the poems are a\ncorrupt version of some text in nature with which they\nought to be made to tally. A rhyme in one of our sonnets\nshould not be less pleasing than the iterated nodes of\na sea-shell, or the resembling difference of a group\nof flowers. The pairing of the birds is an idyl, not\ntedious as our idyls are; a tempest is a rough ode,\nwithout falsehood or rant; a summer, with its harvest\nsown, reaped, and stored, is an epic song, subordinating\nhow many admirably executed parts.  Why should not the\nsymmetry and truth that modulate these, glide into our\nspirits, and we participate the invention of nature?",
        "This insight, which expresses itself by what is\ncalled Imagination, is a very high sort of seeing,\nwhich does not come by study, but by the intellect\nbeing where and what it sees; by sharing the path\nor circuit of things through forms, and so making\nthem translucid to others. The path of things is\nsilent. Will they suffer a speaker to go with them?\nA spy they will not suffer; a lover, a poet, is the\ntranscendency of their own nature,—him they will\nsuffer. The condition of true naming, on the poet’s\npart, is his resigning himself to the divine aura\nwhich breathes through forms, and accompanying that.",
        "It is a secret which every intellectual man quickly\nlearns, that, beyond the energy of his possessed and\nconscious intellect he is capable of a new energy\n(as of an intellect doubled on itself), by abandonment\nto the nature of things; that beside his privacy of\npower as an individual man, there is a great public\npower on which he can draw, by unlocking, at all risks,\nhis human doors, and suffering the ethereal tides to\nroll and circulate through him; then he is caught up\ninto the life of the Universe, his speech is thunder,\nhis thought is law, and his words are universally\nintelligible as the plants and animals. The poet knows\nthat he speaks adequately then only when he speaks\nsomewhat wildly, or, “with the flower of the mind;\"\nnot with the intellect used as an organ, but with the\nintellect released from all service and suffered to\ntake its direction from its celestial life; or as the\nancients were wont to express themselves, not with\nintellect alone but with the intellect inebriated by\nnectar. As the traveller who has lost his way throws\nhis reins on his horse’s neck and trusts to the\ninstinct of the animal to find his road, so must we\ndo with the divine animal who carries us through this\nworld. For if in any manner we can stimulate this\ninstinct, new passages are opened for us into nature;\nthe mind flows into and through things hardest and\nhighest, and the metamorphosis is possible.",
        "This is the reason why bards love wine, mead,\nnarcotics, coffee, tea, opium, the fumes of sandal\n-wood and tobacco, or whatever other procurers of\nanimal exhilaration. All men avail themselves of\nsuch means as they can, to add this extraordinary\npower to their normal powers; and to this end they\nprize conversation, music, pictures, sculpture,\ndancing, theatres, travelling, war, mobs, fires,\ngaming, politics, or love, or science, or animal\nintoxication,—which are several coarser or finer\nquasi-mechanical substitutes for the true nectar,\nwhich is the ravishment of the intellect by coming\nnearer to the fact. These are auxiliaries to the\ncentrifugal tendency of a man, to his passage out\ninto free space, and they help him to escape the\ncustody of that body in which he is pent up, and\nof that jail-yard of individual relations in which\nhe is enclosed. Hence a great number of such as were\nprofessionally expressers of Beauty, as painters,\npoets, musicians, and actors, have been more than\nothers wont to lead a life of pleasure and indulgence;\nall but the few who received the true nectar; and, as\nit was a spurious mode of attaining freedom, as it was\nan emancipation not into the heavens but into the\nfreedom of baser places, they were punished for that\nadvantage they won, by a dissipation and deterioration.\nBut never can any advantage be taken of nature by a\ntrick. The spirit of the world, the great calm presence\nof the Creator, comes not forth to the sorceries of\nopium or of wine. The sublime vision comes to the pure\nand simple soul in a clean and chaste body. That is not\nan inspiration, which we owe to narcotics, but some\ncounterfeit excitement and fury. Milton says that the\nlyric poet may drink wine and live generously, but the\nepic poet, he who shall sing of the gods and their\ndescent unto men, must drink water out of a wooden\nbowl. For poetry is not ’Devil’s wine,’ but God’s wine.\nIt is with this as it is with toys. We fill the hands\nand nurseries of our children with all manner of dolls,\ndrums, and horses; withdrawing their eyes from the\nplain face and sufficing objects of nature, the sun,\nand moon, the animals, the water, and stones, which\nshould be their toys. So the poet’s habit of living\nshould be set on a key so low that the common\ninfluences should delight him. His cheerfulness should\nbe the gift of the sunlight; the air should suffice\nfor his inspiration, and he should be tipsy with water.\nThat spirit which suffices quiet hearts, which seems to\ncome forth to such from every dry knoll of sere grass,\nfrom every pine-stump and half-imbedded stone on which\nthe dull March sun shines, comes forth to the poor and\nhungry, and such as are of simple taste.  If thou fill\nthy brain with Boston and New York, with fashion and\ncovetousness, and wilt stimulate thy jaded senses with\nwine and French coffee, thou shalt find no radiance of\nwisdom in the lonely waste of the pinewoods.",
        "If the imagination intoxicates the poet, it is\nnot inactive in other men. The metamorphosis\nexcites in the beholder an emotion of joy. The\nuse of symbols has a certain power of emancipation\nand exhilaration for all men. We seem to be touched\nby a wand which makes us dance and run about happily,\nlike children.  We are like persons who come out of\na cave or cellar into the open air. This is the\neffect on us of tropes, fables, oracles, and all\npoetic forms. Poets are thus liberating gods. Men\nhave really got a new sense, and found within their\nworld another world, or nest of worlds; for, the\nmetamorphosis once seen, we divine that it does not\nstop. I will not now consider how much this makes\nthe charm of algebra and the mathematics, which\nalso have their tropes, but it is felt in every\ndefinition; as when Aristotle defines space to be\nan immovable vessel in which things are contained;\n—or when Plato defines a line to be a flowing\npoint; or figure to be a bound of solid; and many\nthe like. What a joyful sense of freedom we have\nwhen Vitruvius announces the old opinion of artists\nthat no architect can build any house well who does\nnot know something of anatomy. When Socrates, in\nCharmides, tells us that the soul is cured of its\nmaladies by certain incantations, and that these\nincantations are beautiful reasons, from which\ntemperance is generated in souls; when Plato calls\nthe world an animal; and Timaeus affirms that the\nplants also are animals; or affirms a man to be a\nheavenly tree, growing with his root, which is his\nhead, upward; and, as George Chapman, following him,\nwrites,—",
        "when Orpheus speaks of hoariness as “that white\nflower which marks extreme old age;” when Proclus\ncalls the universe the statue of the intellect;\nwhen Chaucer, in his praise of ’Gentilesse,’ compares\ngood blood in mean condition to fire, which, though\ncarried to the darkest house betwixt this and the\nmount of Caucasus, will yet hold its natural office\nand burn as bright as if twenty thousand men did it\nbehold; when John saw, in the Apocalypse, the ruin\nof the world through evil, and the stars fall from\nheaven as the figtree casteth her untimely fruit;\nwhen Aesop reports the whole catalogue of common\ndaily relations through the masquerade of birds and\nbeasts;—we take the cheerful hint of the immortality\nof our essence and its versatile habit and escapes,\nas when the gypsies say “it is in vain to hang them,\nthey cannot die.”",
        "The poets are thus liberating gods. The ancient\nBritish bards had for the title of their order, “Those\nWho are free throughout the world.” They are free, and\nthey make free. An imaginative book renders us much\nmore service at first, by stimulating us through its\ntropes, than afterward when we arrive at the precise\nsense of the author. I think nothing is of any value\nin books excepting the transcendental and extraordinary.\nIf a man is inflamed and carried away by his thought,\nto that degree that he forgets the authors and the\npublic and heeds only this one dream which holds him\nlike an insanity, let me read his paper, and you may\nhave all the arguments and histories and criticism.\nAll the value which attaches to Pythagoras, Paracelsus,\nCornelius Agrippa, Cardan, Kepler, Swedenborg, Schelling,\nOken, or any other who introduces questionable facts\ninto his cosmogony, as angels, devils, magic, astrology,\npalmistry, mesmerism, and so on, is the certificate we\nhave of departure from routine, and that here is a new\nwitness. That also is the best success in conversation,\nthe magic of liberty, which puts the world like a ball\nin our hands. How cheap even the liberty then seems;\nhow mean to study, when an emotion communicates to the\nintellect the power to sap and upheave nature; how great\nthe perspective! nations, times, systems, enter and\ndisappear like threads in tapestry of large figure and\nmany colors; dream delivers us to dream, and while the\ndrunkenness lasts we will sell our bed, our philosophy,\nour religion, in our opulence.",
        "There is good reason why we should prize this\nliberation. The fate of the poor shepherd, who,\nblinded and lost in the snow-storm, perishes in a\ndrift within a few feet of his cottage door, is an\nemblem of the state of man. On the brink of the\nwaters of life and truth, we are miserably dying.\nThe inaccessibleness of every thought but that we\nare in, is wonderful. What if you come near to it;\nyou are as remote when you are nearest as when you\nare farthest. Every thought is also a prison; every\nheaven is also a prison. Therefore we love the poet,\nthe inventor, who in any form, whether in an ode or\nin an action or in looks and behavior has yielded\nus a new thought. He unlocks our chains and admits\nus to a new scene.",
        "This emancipation is dear to all men, and the power\nto impart it, as it must come from greater depth and\nscope of thought, is a measure of intellect. Therefore\nall books of the imagination endure, all which ascend\nto that truth that the writer sees nature beneath him,\nand uses it as his exponent. Every verse or sentence\npossessing this virtue will take care of its own\nimmortality. The religions of the world are the\nejaculations of a few imaginative men.",
        "But the quality of the imagination is to flow,\nand not to freeze. The poet did not stop at the\ncolor or the form, but read their meaning; neither\nmay he rest in this meaning, but he makes the same\nobjects exponents of his new thought. Here is the\ndifference betwixt the poet and the mystic, that\nthe last nails a symbol to one sense, which was a\ntrue sense for a moment, but soon becomes old and\nfalse. For all symbols are fluxional; all language\nis vehicular and transitive, and is good, as ferries\nand horses are, for conveyance, not as farms and\nhouses are, for homestead. Mysticism consists in\nthe mistake of an accidental and individual symbol\nfor an universal one. The morning-redness happens\nto be the favorite meteor to the eyes of Jacob Behmen,\nand comes to stand to him for truth and faith; and,\nhe believes, should stand for the same realities to\nevery reader. But the first reader prefers as\nnaturally the symbol of a mother and child, or a\ngardener and his bulb, or a jeweller polishing a\ngem. Either of these, or of a myriad more, are equally\ngood to the person to whom they are significant. Only\nthey must be held lightly, and be very willingly\ntranslated into the equivalent terms which others use.\nAnd the mystic must be steadily told,—All that you\nsay is just as true without the tedious use of that\nsymbol as with it. Let us have a little algebra,\ninstead of this trite rhetoric,—universal signs,\ninstead of these village symbols,—and we shall both\nbe gainers. The history of hierarchies seems to show\nthat all religious error consisted in making the\nsymbol too stark and solid, and was at last nothing\nbut an excess of the organ of language.",
        "Swedenborg, of all men in the recent ages, stands\neminently for the translator of nature into thought.\nI do not know the man in history to whom things\nstood so uniformly for words. Before him the\nmetamorphosis continually plays. Everything on which\nhis eye rests, obeys the impulses of moral nature.\nThe figs become grapes whilst he eats them. When\nsome of his angels affirmed a truth, the laurel twig\nwhich they held blossomed in their hands. The noise\nwhich at a distance appeared like gnashing and\nthumping, on coming nearer was found to be the voice\nof disputants. The men in one of his visions, seen in\nheavenly light, appeared like dragons, and seemed in\ndarkness; but to each other they appeared as men, and\nwhen the light from heaven shone into their cabin,\nthey complained of the darkness, and were compelled\nto shut the window that they might see.",
        "There was this perception in him which makes the poet\nor seer an object of awe and terror, namely that the\nsame man or society of men may wear one aspect to\nthemselves and their companions, and a different aspect\nto higher intelligences. Certain priests, whom he\ndescribes as conversing very learnedly together,\nappeared to the children who were at some distance,\nlike dead horses; and many the like misappearances. And\ninstantly the mind inquires whether these fishes under\nthe bridge, yonder oxen in the pasture, those dogs in\nthe yard, are immutably fishes, oxen, and dogs, or only\nso appear to me, and perchance to themselves appear\nupright men; and whether I appear as a man to all eyes.\nThe Bramins and Pythagoras propounded the same question,\nand if any poet has witnessed the transformation he\ndoubtless found it in harmony with various experiences.\nWe have all seen changes as considerable in wheat and\ncaterpillars. He is the poet and shall draw us with\nlove and terror, who sees through the flowing vest the\nfirm nature, and can declare it.",
        "I look in vain for the poet whom I describe. We do\nnot with sufficient plainness or sufficient\nprofoundness address ourselves to life, nor dare we\nchaunt our own times and social circumstance. If we\nfilled the day with bravery, we should not shrink\nfrom celebrating it. Time and nature yield us many\ngifts, but not yet the timely man, the new religion,\nthe reconciler, whom all things await. Dante’s praise\nis that he dared to write his autobiography in colossal\ncipher, or into universality. We have yet had no genius\nin America, with tyrannous eye, which knew the value of\nour incomparable materials, and saw, in the barbarism\nand materialism of the times, another carnival of the\nsame gods whose picture he so much admires in Homer;\nthen in the Middle Age; then in Calvinism. Banks and\ntariffs, the newspaper and caucus, Methodism and\nUnitarianism, are flat and dull to dull people, but\nrest on the same foundations of wonder as the town of\nTroy and the temple of Delphi, and are as swiftly passing\naway. Our logrolling, our stumps and their politics, our\nfisheries, our Negroes and Indians, our boats and our\nrepudiations, the wrath of rogues and the pusillanimity\nof honest men, the northern trade, the southern planting,\nthe western clearing, Oregon and Texas, are yet unsung.\nYet America is a poem in our eyes; its ample geography\ndazzles the imagination, and it will not wait long for\nmetres. If I have not found that excellent combination\nof gifts in my countrymen which I seek, neither could\nI aid myself to fix the idea of the poet by reading now\nand then in Chalmers’s collection of five centuries of\nEnglish poets. These are wits more than poets, though\nthere have been poets among them. But when we adhere\nto the ideal of the poet, we have our difficulties even\nwith Milton and Homer. Milton is too literary, and Homer\ntoo literal and historical.",
        "But I am not wise enough for a national criticism,\nand must use the old largeness a little longer, to\ndischarge my errand from the muse to the poet\nconcerning his art.",
        "Art is the path of the creator to his work. The\npaths or methods are ideal and eternal, though few\nmen ever see them; not the artist himself for years,\nor for a lifetime, unless he come into the conditions.\nThe painter, the sculptor, the composer, the epic\nrhapsodist, the orator, all partake one desire, namely\nto express themselves symmetrically and abundantly,\nnot dwarfishly and fragmentarily. They found or put\nthemselves in certain conditions, as, the painter and\nsculptor before some impressive human figures; the\norator, into the assembly of the people; and the others\nin such scenes as each has found exciting to his\nintellect; and each presently feels the new desire.\nHe hears a voice, he sees a beckoning. Then he is\napprised, with wonder, what herds of daemons hem him\nin. He can no more rest; he says, with the old painter,\n“By God, it is in me and must go forth of me.” He\npursues a beauty, half seen, which flies before him.\nThe poet pours out verses in every solitude. Most of\nthe things he says are conventional, no doubt; but by\nand by he says something which is original and beautiful.\nThat charms him. He would say nothing else but such\nthings. In our way of talking we say ’That is yours,\nthis is mine;’ but the poet knows well that it is not\nhis; that it is as strange and beautiful to him as to\nyou; he would fain hear the like eloquence at length.\nOnce having tasted this immortal ichor, he cannot have\nenough of it, and as an admirable creative power exists\nin these intellections, it is of the last importance\nthat these things get spoken. What a little of all we\nknow is said! What drops of all the sea of our science\nare baled up! and by what accident it is that these are\nexposed, when so many secrets sleep in nature! Hence the\nnecessity of speech and song; hence these throbs and\nheart-beatings in the orator, at the door of the assembly,\nto the end namely that thought may be ejaculated as Logos,\nor Word.",
        "Doubt not, O poet, but persist. Say ’It is in me,\nand shall out.’ Stand there, balked and dumb,\nstuttering and stammering, hissed and hooted, stand\nand strive, until at last rage draw out of thee that\ndream-power which every night shows thee is thine\nown; a power transcending all limit and privacy, and\nby virtue of which a man is the conductor of the\nwhole river of electricity. Nothing walks, or creeps,\nor grows, or exists, which must not in turn arise\nand walk before him as exponent of his meaning. Comes\nhe to that power, his genius is no longer exhaustible.\nAll the creatures by pairs and by tribes pour into\nhis mind as into a Noah’s ark, to come forth again\nto people a new world. This is like the stock of air\nfor our respiration or for the combustion of our\nfireplace; not a measure of gallons, but the entire\natmosphere if wanted. And therefore the rich poets,\nas Homer, Chaucer, Shakspeare, and Raphael, have\nobviously no limits to their works except the limits\nof their lifetime, and resemble a mirror carried\nthrough the street, ready to render an image of every\ncreated thing.",
        "O poet! a new nobility is conferred in groves and\npastures, and not in castles or by the sword-blade\nany longer. The conditions are hard, but equal.\nThou shalt leave the world, and know the muse only.\nThou shalt not know any longer the times, customs,\ngraces, politics, or opinions of men, but shalt take\nall from the muse. For the time of towns is tolled\nfrom the world by funereal chimes, but in nature the\nuniversal hours are counted by succeeding tribes of\nanimals and plants, and by growth of joy on joy. God\nwills also that thou abdicate a manifold and duplex\nlife, and that thou be content that others speak for\nthee.  Others shall be thy gentlemen and shall\nrepresent all courtesy and worldly life for thee;\nothers shall do the great and resounding actions also.\nThou shalt lie close hid with nature, and canst not\nbe afforded to the Capitol or the Exchange. The world\nis full of renunciations and apprenticeships, and this\nis thine: thou must pass for a fool and a churl for a\nlong season. This is the screen and sheath in which\nPan has protected his well-beloved flower, and thou\nshalt be known only to thine own, and they shall\nconsole thee with tenderest love. And thou shalt not\nbe able to rehearse the names of thy friends in thy\nverse, for an old shame before the holy ideal. And\nthis is the reward; that the ideal shall be real to\nthee, and the impressions of the actual world shall\nfall like summer rain, copious, but not troublesome,\nto thy invulnerable essence. Thou shalt have the whole\nland for thy park and manor, the sea for thy bath and\nnavigation, without tax and without envy; the woods\nand the rivers thou shalt own; and thou shalt possess\nthat wherein others are only tenants and boarders.\nThou true land-lord! sea-lord! air-lord!  Wherever\nsnow falls or water flows or birds fly, wherever day\nand night meet in twilight, wherever the blue heaven\nis hung by clouds or sown with stars, wherever are\nforms with transparent boundaries, wherever are outlets\ninto celestial space, wherever is danger, and awe, and\nlove,—there is Beauty, plenteous as rain, shed for thee,\nand though thou shouldest walk the world over, thou shalt\nnot be able to find a condition inopportune or ignoble.",
