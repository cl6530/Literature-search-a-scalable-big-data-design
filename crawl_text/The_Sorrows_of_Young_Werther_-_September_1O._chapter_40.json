        "Oh, what a night, Wilhelm! I can henceforth bear anything. I\nshall never see her again. Oh, why cannot I fall on your neck,\nand, with floods of tears and raptures, give utterance to all the\npassions which distract my heart! Here I sit gasping for breath,\nand struggling to compose myself. I wait for day, and at sunrise\nthe horses are to be at the door.",
        "And she is sleeping calmly, little suspecting that she has seen me\nfor the last time. I am free. I have had the courage, in an\ninterview of two hours’ duration, not to betray my intention. And\nO Wilhelm, what a conversation it was!",
        "Albert had promised to come to Charlotte in the garden immediately\nafter supper. I was upon the terrace under the tall chestnut trees,\nand watched the setting sun. I saw him sink for the last time\nbeneath this delightful valley and silent stream. I had often\nvisited the same spot with Charlotte, and witnessed that glorious\nsight; and now — I was walking up and down the very avenue which\nwas so dear to me. A secret sympathy had frequently drawn me\nthither before I knew Charlotte; and we were delighted when, in\nour early acquaintance, we discovered that we each loved the same\nspot, which is indeed as romantic as any that ever captivated the\nfancy of an artist.",
        ">From beneath the chestnut trees, there is an extensive view. But\nI remember that I have mentioned all this in a former letter, and\nhave described the tall mass of beech trees at the end, and how\nthe avenue grows darker and darker as it winds its way among them,\ntill it ends in a gloomy recess, which has all the charm of a\nmysterious solitude. I still remember the strange feeling of\nmelancholy which came over me the first time I entered that dark\nretreat, at bright midday. I felt some secret foreboding that it\nwould, one day, be to me the scene of some happiness or misery.",
        "I had spent half an hour struggling between the contending thoughts\nof going and returning, when I heard them coming up the terrace.\nI ran to meet them. I trembled as I took her hand, and kissed it.\nAs we reached the top of the terrace, the moon rose from behind\nthe wooded hill. We conversed on many subjects, and, without\nperceiving it, approached the gloomy recess. Charlotte entered,\nand sat down. Albert seated himself beside her. I did the same,\nbut my agitation did not suffer me to remain long seated. I got\nup, and stood before her, then walked backward and forward, and\nsat down again. I was restless and miserable. Charlotte drew our\nattention to the beautiful effect of the moonlight, which threw a\nsilver hue over the terrace in front of us, beyond the beech trees.\nIt was a glorious sight, and was rendered more striking by the\ndarkness which surrounded the spot where we were. We remained for\nsome time silent, when Charlotte observed, “Whenever I walk by\nmoonlight, it brings to my remembrance all my beloved and departed\nfriends, and I am filled with thoughts of death and futurity. We\nshall live again, Werther!” she continued, with a firm but feeling\nvoice; “but shall we know one another again what do you think?\nwhat do you say?”",
        "“Charlotte,” I said, as I took her hand in mine, and my eyes filled\nwith tears, “we shall see each other again — here and hereafter\nwe shall meet again.” I could say no more. Why, Wilhelm, should\nshe put this question to me, just at the monent when the fear of\nour cruel separation filled my heart?",
        "“And oh! do those departed ones know how we are employed here? do\nthey know when we are well and happy? do they know when we recall\ntheir memories with the fondest love? In the silent hour of\nevening the shade of my mother hovers around me; when seated\nin the midst of my children, I see them assembled near me, as\nthey used to assemble near her; and then I raise my anxious eyes\nto heaven, and wish she could look down upon us, and witness how\nI fulfil the promise I made to her in her last moments, to be a\nmother to her children. With what emotion do I then exclaim,\n’Pardon, dearest of mothers, pardon me, if I do not adequately\nsupply your place! Alas! I do my utmost. They are clothed and\nfed; and, still better, they are loved and educated. Could you\nbut see, sweet saint! the peace and harmony that dwells amongst\nus, you would glorify God with the warmest feelings of gratitude,\nto whom, in your last hour, you addressed such fervent prayers for\nour happiness.’” Thus did she express herself; but O Wilhelm! who\ncan do justice to her language? how can cold and passionless words\nconvey the heavenly expressions of the spirit? Albert interrupted\nher gently. “This affects you too deeply, my dear Charlotte. I\nknow your soul dwells on such recollections wlth intense delight;\nbut I implore — “ “O Albert!” she continued, “I am sure you do\nnot forget the evenings when we three used to sit at the little\nround table, when papa was absent, and the little ones had retired.\nYou often had a good book with you, but seldom read it; the\nconversation of that noble being was preferable to everything, —\nthat beautiful, bright, gentle, and yet ever-toiling woman. God\nalone knows how I have supplicated with tears on my nightly couch,\nthat I might be like her.”",
        "I threw myself at her feet, and, seizing her hand, bedewed it with\na thousand tears. “Charlotte!” I exclaimed, “God’s blessing and\nyour mother’s spirit are upon you.” “Oh! that you had known her,\"\nshe said, with a warm pressure of the hand. “She was worthy of\nbeing known to you.” I thought I should have fainted: never had\nI received praise so flattering. She continued, “And yet she was\ndoomed to die in the flower of her youth, when her youngest child\nwas scarcely six months old. Her illness was but short, but she\nwas calm and resigned; and it was only for her children, especially\nthe youngest, that she felt unhappy. When her end drew nigh, she\nbade me bring them to her. I obeyed. The younger ones knew nothing\nof their approaching loss, while the elder ones were quite overcome\nwith grief. They stood around the bed; and she raised her feeble\nhands to heaven, and prayed over them; then, kissing them in turn,\nshe dismissed them, and said to me, ’Be you a mother to them.’ I\ngave her my hand. ’You are promising much, my child,’ she said:\n’a mother’s fondness and a mother’s care! I have often witnessed,\nby your tears of gratitude, that you know what is a mother’s\ntenderness: show it to your brothers and sisters, and be dutiful\nand faithful to your father as a wife; you will be his comfort.’\nShe inquired for him. He had retired to conceal his intolerable\nanguish, — he was heartbroken, “Albert, you were in the room.\nShe heard some one moving: she inquired who it was, and desired\nyou to approach. She surveyed us both with a look of composure\nand satisfaction, expressive of her conviction that we should be\nhappy, — happy with one another.” Albert fell upon her neck, and\nkissed her, and exclaimed, “We are so, and we shall be so!” Even\nAlbert, generally so tranquil, had quite lost his composure; and\nI was excited beyond expression.",
        "“And such a being,” She continued, “was to leave us, Werther!\nGreat God, must we thus part with everything we hold dear in this\nworld? Nobody felt this more acutely than the children: they cried\nand lamented for a long time afterward, complaining that men had\ncarried away their dear mamma.”",
        "Charlotte rose. It aroused me; but I continued sitting, and held\nher hand. “Let us go,” she said: “it grows late.” She attempted\nto withdraw her hand: I held it still. “We shall see each other\nagain,” I exclaimed: “we shall recognise each other under every\npossible change! I am going,” I continued, “going willingly; but,\nshould I say for ever, perhaps I may not keep my word. Adieu,\nCharlotte; adieu, Albert. We shall meet again.” “Yes: tomorrow,\nI think,” she answered with a smile. Tomorrow! how I felt the word!\nAh! she little thought, when she drew her hand away from mine.\nThey walked down the avenue. I stood gazing after them in the\nmoonlight. I threw myself upon the ground, and wept: I then sprang\nup, and ran out upon the terrace, and saw, under the shade of the\nlinden-trees, her white dress disappearing near the garden-gate.\nI stretched out my arms, and she vanished.",
