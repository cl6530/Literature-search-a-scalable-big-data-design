        "When a man prides himself on being able to understand and\ninterpret the writings of Chrysippus,(19) say to yourself:—",
        "If Chrysippus had not written obscurely, this fellow would\nhave had nothing to be proud of. But what is it that I desire? To\nunderstand Nature, and to follow her! Accordingly I ask who is\nthe Interpreter. On hearing that it is Chrysippus, I go to him.\nBut it seems I do not understand what he wrote. So I seek one to\ninterpret that. So far there is nothing to pride myself upon. But\nwhen I have found my interpreter, what remains is to put in\npractice his instructions. This itself is the only thing to be\nproud of. But if I admire the interpretation and that alone, what\nelse have I turned out but a mere commentator instead of a lover\nof wisdom?—except indeed that I happen to be interpreting\nChrysippus instead of Homer. So when any one says to me, Prithee,\nread me Chrysippus, I am more inclined to blush, when I cannot\nshow my deeds to be in harmony and accordance with his sayings.",
