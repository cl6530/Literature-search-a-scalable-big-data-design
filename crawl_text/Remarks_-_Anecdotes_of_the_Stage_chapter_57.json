        "Years ago, before Laramie City got a handsome opera house, everything in\nthe theatrical and musical line of a high order was put on the stage of\nBlackburn’s Hall. Other light dramas on the stage, and thrilling murders\nin the audience, used to occur at Alexander’s Theater, on Front street.\nHere you could get a glass of Laramie beer, made of glucose, alkali water,\nplug tobacco, and Paris green, by paying two bits at the bar, and, as a\nprize, you drew a ticket to the olio, specialties, and low gags of the\nstage. The idea of inebriating a man at the box office, so that he will\nendure such a sham, is certainly worthy of serious consideration. I have\nseen shows at Alexander’s, and also at McDaniel’s, in Cheyenne, however,\nwhere the bar should have provided an ounce of chloroform with each ticket\nin order to allay the suffering.",
        "Here you could sit down in the orchestra and take the chances of getting\nhit when the audience began to shoot at the pianist, or you could go up\ninto the boxes and have a quiet little conversation with the timid\nbeer-jerkers. The beer-jerker was never too proud to speak to the most\nhumble, and if she could sell a grub-staker for $5 a bottle of real Piper\nHeidsick, made in Cheyenne and warranted to remove the gastric coat, pants\nand vest from a man’s stomach in two minutes, she felt pleased and proud.",
        "A room-mate of mine, whose name I will not give, simply because he was and\nstill is the best fellow in the United States, came home from the\n“theater” one night with his hair parted in the middle. He didn’t wear it\nthat way generally, so it occasioned talk in social circles. He still has\na natural parting of the hair about five inches long, that he acquired\nthat night. He said it was accidental so far as he was concerned, but\nunless the management could keep people from shooting the holders of\nreserved seats between the acts or any other vital spot, he would withdraw\nhis patronage. And he was right about it. I think that any court in the\nland would protect a man who had purchased a seat in good faith, and with\nhis hat on and both feet on the back of the seat in front of him, sits\nquietly in said seat, smoking a Colorado Maduro cigar and watching the\nplay.",
        "Several such accidents occurred at the said theater. Among them was a\nlittle tableau in which Joe Walker and Centennial Bob took the leading\nparts. Bob went to the penitentiary, and Joe went to his reward with one\nof his lungs in his coat pocket. There was a little difference between\nthem as to the regularity of a “draw” and “show down,” so Bob went home\nfrom the theater and loaded a double-barrel shot-gun with a lot of\nscrap-iron, and, after he had introduced the collection into Joe’s front\nbreadth, the latter’s system was so lacerated that it wouldn’t retain\nground feed.",
        "There were other little incidents like that which occurred in and around\nthe old theater, some growing out of the lost love of a beer-jerker, some\nfrom an injudicious investment in a bob-tail flush that never got ripe\nenough to pick, and some from the rarified mountain air, united with an\nepidemic known as mania rotguti.",
        "A funny incident of the stage occurred not long ago to a friend of mine,\nwho is traveling with a play in which a stage cow appears. He is using\nwhat is called a profile cow now, which works by machinery. Last winter\nthis cow ran down while in the middle of the stage, and forgot her lines.\nThe prompter gave the string a jerk in order to assist her. This broke the\ncow in two, and the fore-quarters walked off to the left into one\ndressing-room, while the behind-quarters and porter-house steak retired to\nthe outer dressing-room. The audience called for an encore; but the cow\nfelt as though she had made a kind of a bull of the part, and would not\nappear. Those who may be tempted to harshly criticise this last remark,\nare gently reminded that the intense heat of the past month is liable to\neffect anyone’s mind. Remember, gentle reader, that your own brain may\nsome day soften also, and then you will remember how harsh you were toward\nme.",
        "Prior to the profile cow, the company ran a wicker-work cow, that was\nhollow and admitted of two hired-men, who operated the beast at a moderate\nsalary. These men drilled a long time on what they called a heifer\ndance–a beautiful spectacular, and highly moral and instructive quadruped\nclog, sirloin shuffle, and cow gallop, to the music of a piano-forte. The\nrehearsals had been crowned with success, and when the cow came on the\nstage she got a bouquet, and made a bran mash on one of the ushers.",
        "She danced up and down the stage, perfectly self-possessed, and with that\nperfect grace and abandon which is so noticeable in the self-made cow.\nFinally she got through, the piano sounded a wild Wagnerian bang, and the\ncow danseuse ambled off. She was improperly steered, however, and ran her\nhead against a wing, where she stopped in full view of the audience. The\ntalent inside of the cow thought they had reached the dressing-room and\nran against the wall, so they felt perfectly free to converse with each\nother. The cow stood with her nose jammed up against the wing, wrapped in\nthought, Finally, from her thorax the audience heard a voice say:",
        "“Jim, you blamed galoot, that ain’t the step we took at rehearsal no\nmore’n nuthin’. If you’re going to improvise a new cow duet, I wish you\nwouldn’t take the fore-quarters by surprise next time.”",
        "It is not now known what the reply was, for just then the prompter came on\nthe stage, rudely twisted the tail of the cow, rousing her from her\nlethargy, and harshly kicking her in the pit of the stomach, he drove her\noff the stage, The audience loudly called for a repetition, but the cow\nrefused to come in.",
