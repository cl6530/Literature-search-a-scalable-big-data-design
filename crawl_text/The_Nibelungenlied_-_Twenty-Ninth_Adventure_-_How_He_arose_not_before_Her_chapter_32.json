        "Then parted from each other / the noble warriors twain,\nHagen of Tronje / and Dietrich, lofty thane.\nThen did King Gunther’s warrior / cast a glance around,\nSeeking a companion / the same he eke full quickly found.",
        "1759",
        "As standing there by Giselher / he did Volker see,\nHe prayed the nimble Fiddler / to bear him company,\nFor that full well he knew it / how grim he was of mood,\nAnd that in all things was he / a knight of mettle keen and good.",
        "1760",
        "While yet their lords were standing / there in castle yard\nSaw ye the two knights only / walking thitherward\nAcross the court far distant / before the palace wide.\nThe chosen thanes recked little / what might through any’s hate betide.",
        "1761",
        "They sate them down on settle / over against a hall,\nWherein dwelt Lady Kriemhild, / beside the palace wall.\nFull stately their attire / on stalwart bodies shone.\nAll that did look upon them / right gladly had the warriors known.",
        "1762",
        "Like unto beasts full savage / were they gaped upon,\nThe two haughty heroes, / by full many a Hun.\nEke from a casement Etzel’s / wife did them perceive:\nOnce more to behold them / must fair Lady Kriemhild grieve.",
        "1763",
        "It called to mind her sorrow, / and she to weep began,\nWhereat did mickle wonder / many an Etzel’s man,\nWhat grief had thus so sudden / made her sad of mood.\nSpake she: “That hath Hagen, / ye knights of mettle keen and good.”",
        "1764",
        "They to their mistress answered: / “Such thing, how hath it been?\nFor that thee right joyous / we but now have seen.\nNe’er lived he so daring / that, having wrought thee ill,\nHis life he must not forfeit, / if but to vengeance point thy will.”",
        "1765",
        "“I live but to requite him / that shall avenge my wrong;\nWhate’er be his desire / shall unto him belong.\nProstrate I beseech you,\" / –so spake the monarch’s wife–\n“Avenge me upon Hagen, / and forfeit surely be his life.”",
        "1766",
        "Three score of valiant warriors / made ready then straightway\nTo work the will of Kriemhild / and her best obey\nBy slaying of Sir Hagen, / the full valiant thane,\nAnd eke the doughty Fiddler; / by shameful deed thus sought they gain.",
        "1767",
        "When the queen beheld there / so small their company,\nIn full angry humor / to the warriors spake she:\n“What there ye think to compass, / forego such purpose yet:\nSo small in numbers never / dare ye Hagen to beset.",
        "1768",
        "“How doughty e’er be Hagen, / and known his valor wide,\nA man by far more doughty / that sitteth him beside,\nVolker the Fiddler: / a warrior grim is he.\nIn sooth may not so lightly / the heroes twain confronted be.”",
        "1769",
        "When that she thus had spoken, / ready soon were seen\nFour hundred stalwart warriors; / for was the lofty queen\nFull intent upon it / to work them evil sore.\nTherefrom for all the strangers / was mickle sorrow yet in store.",
        "1770",
        "When that complete attired / were here retainers seen,\nUnto the knights impatient / in such wise spake the queen:\n“Now bide ye yet a moment / and stand ye ready so,\nWhile I with crown upon me / unto my enemies shall go.",
        "1771",
        "“And list while I accuse him / how he hath wrought me bane,\nHagen of Tronje, / Gunther’s doughty thane.\nI know his mood so haughty, / naught he’ll deny of all.\nNor reck I what of evil / therefrom may unto him befall.”",
        "1772",
        "Then saw the doughty Fiddler / –he was a minstrel keen–\nAdown the steps descending / the high and stately queen\nWho issued from the castle. / When he the queen espied,\nSpake the valiant Volker / to him was seated by his side:",
        "1773",
        "“Look yonder now, friend Hagen, / how that she hither hies\nWho to this land hath called us / in such treacherous wise.\nNo monarch’s wife I ever / saw followed by such band\nOf warriors armed for battle, / that carry each a sword in hand.",
        "1774",
        "“Know’st thou, perchance, friend Hagen, / if hate to thee they bear?\nThen would I well advise thee / of them full well beware\nAnd guard both life and honor. / That methinks were good,\nFor if I much mistake not, / full wrathful is the warriors’ mood.",
        "1775",
        "“Of many eke among them / so broad the breasts do swell,\nThat who would guard him ’gainst them / betimes would do it well.\nI ween that ’neath their tunics / they shining mail-coats wear:\nYet might I never tell thee, / ’gainst whom such evil mind they bear.”",
        "1776",
        "Then spake all wrathful-minded / Hagen the warrior keen:\n“On me to vent their fury / is their sole thought, I ween,\nThat thus with brandished weapons / their onward press we see.\nDespite them all yet trow I / to come safe home to Burgundy.",
        "1777",
        "“Now tell me, friend Volker, / wilt thou beside me stand,\nIf seek to work me evil / here Kriemhild’s band?\nThat let me hear right truly, / as I am dear to thee.\nBy thy side forever / shall my service faithful be.”",
        "1778",
        "“Full surely will I help thee,\" / the minstrel straight replied;\n“And saw I e’en a monarch / with all his men beside\nHither come against us, / the while a sword I wield\nNot fear shall ever prompt me / from thy side one pace to yield.”",
        "1779",
        "“Now God in heaven, O Volker, / give thy high heart its meed.\nWill they forsooth assail me, / whereof else have I need?\nWilt thou thus stand beside me / as here is thy intent,\nLet come all armed these warriors, / on whatsoever purpose bent.”",
        "1780",
        "“Now rise we from this settle,\" / the minstrel spake once more,\n“While that the royal lady / passeth here before.\nTo her be done this honor / as unto lady high.\nOurselves in equal manner / shall we honor eke thereby.”",
        "1781",
        "“Nay, nay! as me thou lovest,\" / Hagen spake again,\n“For so would sure imagine / here each hostile thane\nThat ’twere from fear I did it, / should I bear me so.\nFor sake of never any / will I from this settle go.",
        "1782",
        "“Undone we both might leave it / in sooth more fittingly.\nWherefore should I honor / who bears ill-will to me?\nSuch thing will I do never, / the while I yet have life.\nNor reck I aught how hateth / me the royal Etzel’s wife.”",
        "1783",
        "Thereat defiant Hagen / across his knee did lay\nA sword that shone full brightly, / from whose knob did play\nThe light of glancing jasper / greener than blade of grass.\nWell perceived Kriemhild / that it erstwhile Siegfried’s was.",
        "1784",
        "When she the sword espied, / to weep was sore her need.\nThe hilt was shining golden, / the sheath a band of red.\nAs it recalled her sorrow, / her tears had soon begun;\nI ween for that same purpose / ’twas thus by dauntless Hagen done.",
        "1785",
        "Eke the valiant Volker / a fiddle-bow full strong\nUnto himself drew nearer; / mickle it was and long,\nLike unto a broad-sword / full sharp that was and wide.\nSo sat they all undaunted / the stately warriors side by side.",
        "1786",
        "There sat the thanes together / in such defiant wise\nThat would never either / from the settle rise\nThrough fear of whomsoever. / Then strode before their feet\nThe lofty queen, and wrathful / did thus the doughty warriors greet.",
        "1787",
        "Quoth she: “Now tell me, Hagen, / upon whose command\nBarest thou thus to journey / hither to this land,\nAnd knowest well what sorrow / through thee my heart must bear.\nWert thou not reft of reason, / then hadst thou kept thee far from here.”",
        "1788",
        "“By none have I been summoned,\" / Hagen gave reply.\n“Three lofty thanes invited / were to this country:\nThe same I own as masters / and service with them find.\nWhene’er they make court journey / ’twere strange should I remain\n      behind.”",
        "1789",
        "Quoth she: “Now tell me further, / wherefore didst thou that\nWhereby thou hast deserved / my everlasting hate?\n’Twas thou that slewest Siegfried, / spouse so dear to me,\nThe which, till life hath ended, / must ever cause for weeping be.”",
        "1790",
        "Spake he: “Why parley further, / since further word were vain?\nE’en I am that same Hagen / by whom was Siegfried slain,\nThat deft knight of valor. / How sore by him ’twas paid\nThat the Lady Kriemhild / dared the fair Brunhild upbraid!",
        "1791",
        "“Beyond all cavil is it, / high and royal dame,\nOf all the grievous havoc / I do bear the blame.\nAvenge it now who wisheth, / woman or man tho’t be.\nAn I unto thee lie not, / I’ve wrought thee sorest injury.”",
        "1792",
        "She spake: “Now hear, ye warriors, / how denies he not at all\nThe cause of all my sorrow. / Whate’er may him befall\nReck I not soever, / that know ye, Etzel’s men.\"\nThe overweening warriors / blank gazed upon each other then.",
        "1793",
        "Had any dared the onset, / seen it were full plain\nThe palm must be awarded / to the companions twain,\nWho had in storm of battle / full oft their prowess shown.\nWhat that proud band designed / through fear must now be left undone.",
        "1794",
        "Outspake one of their number: / “Wherefore look thus to me?\nWhat now I thought to venture / left undone shall be,\nNor for reward of any / think I my life to lose;\nTo our destruction lures us / here the royal Etzel’s spouse.”",
        "1795",
        "Then spake thereby another: / “Like mind therein have I.\nThough ruddy gold were offered / like towers piled high,\nYet would I never venture / to stir this Fiddler’s spleen.\nSuch are the rapid glances / that darting from his eyes I’ve seen.",
        "1796",
        "“Likewise know I Hagen / from youthful days full well,\nNor more about his valor / to me need any tell.\nIn two and twenty battles / I the knight have seen,\nWhereby sorest sorrow / to many a lady’s heart hath been.",
        "1797",
        "“When here they were with Etzel, / he and the knight of Spain\nBore storm of many a battle / in many a warlike train\nFor sake of royal honor, / so oft thereof was need.\nWherefore of right are honors / high the valiant Hagen’s meed.",
        "1798",
        "“Then was yet the hero / but a child in years;\nNow how hoary-headed / who were his youthful feres,\nTo wisdom now attained, / a warrior grim and strong,\nEke bears he with him Balmung, / the which he gained by mickle wrong.”",
        "1799",
        "Therewith the matter ended, / and none the fight dared start,\nWhereat the Lady Kriemhild / full heavy was of heart.\nHer warriors thence did vanish, / for feared they death indeed\nAt hands of the Fiddler, / whereof right surely was there need.",
        "1800",
        "Outspake then the Fiddler: / “Well we now have seen,\nThat enemies here do greet us, / as we forewarned have been.\nBack unto the monarchs / let us straight repair,\nThat none against our masters / to raise a hostile hand may dare.",
        "1801",
        "“How oft from impious purpose / doth fear hold back the hand,\nWhere friend by friend doth only / firm in friendship stand,\nUntil right sense give warning / to leave the thing undone.\nThus wisdom hath prevented / the harm of mortals many a one.”",
        "1802",
        "“Heed I will thy counsel,\" / Hagen gave reply.\nThen passed they where / the monarchs found they presently\nIn high state received / within the palace court.\nLoud the valiant Volker / straight began after this sort",
        "1803",
        "Unto his royal masters: / “How long will ye stand so,\nThat foes may press upon you? / To the king ye now shall go,\nAnd from his lips hear spoken / how is his mind to you.\"\nThe valiant lords and noble / consorted then by two and two.",
        "1804",
        "Of Bern the lofty Dietrich / took by the hand\nGunther the lordly monarch / of Burgundian land;\nIrnfried escorted Gernot, / a knight of valor keen,\nAnd Ruediger with Giselher / going unto the court was seen.",
        "1805",
        "Howe’er with fere consorted / there any thane might be,\nVolker and Hagen / ne’er parted company,\nSave in storm of battle / when they did reach life’s bourne,\n’Twas cause that highborn ladies / anon in grievous way must mourn.",
        "1806",
        "Unto the court then passing / with the kings were seen.\nOf their lofty retinue / a thousand warriors keen,\nAnd threescore thanes full valiant / that followed in their train;\nThe same from his own country / had doughty Hagen with him ta’en.",
        "1807",
        "Hawart and eke Iring, / chosen warriors twain,\nSaw ye walk together / in the royal train.\nBy Dankwart and Wolfhart, / a thane of high renown,\nWas high courtly bearing / there before the others shown.",
        "1808",
        "When the lord of Rhineland / passed into the hall,\nEtzel mighty monarch / waited not at all,\nBut sprang from off his settle / when he beheld him nigh.\nBy monarch ne’er was given / greeting so right heartily.",
        "1809",
        "“Welcome be, Lord Gunther, / and eke Sir Gernot too,\nAnd your brother Giselher. / My greetings unto you\nI sent with honest purpose / to Worms across the Rhine;\nAnd welcome all your followers / shall be unto this land of mine.",
        "1810",
        "“Right welcome be ye likewise, / doughty warriors twain,\nVolker the full valiant, / and Hagen dauntless thane,\nTo me and to my lady / here in my country.\nUnto the Rhine to greet you / many a messenger sent she.”",
        "1811",
        "Then spake of Tronje Hagen: / “Thereof I’m well aware,\nAnd did I with my masters / not thus to Hunland fare,\nTo do thee honor had I / ridden unto thy land.\"\nThen took the lofty monarch / the honored strangers by the hand.",
        "1812",
        "He led them to the settle / whereon himself he sat,\nThen poured they for the strangers / –with care they tended that–\nIn goblets wide and golden / mead and mulberry wine,\nAnd bade right hearty welcome / unto the knights afar from Rhine.",
        "1813",
        "Then spake the monarch Etzel: / “This will I freely say:\nNaught in this world might happen / to bring my heart more joy,\nThan that ye lofty heroes / thus are come to me.\nThe queen from mickle sadness / thereby make ye likewise free.",
        "1814",
        "“To me ’twas mickle wonder / wherein had I transgressed,\nThat I for friends had won me / so many a noble guest,\nYet ye had never deigned / to come to my country.\n’Tis now turned cause of gladness / that you as guests I here may see.”",
        "1815",
        "Thereto gave answer Ruediger, / a knight of lofty mind:\n“Well mayst thou joy to see them; / right honor shalt thou find\nAnd naught but noble bearing / in my high mistress’ kin.\nWith them for guest thou likewise / many a stately thane dost win.”",
        "1816",
        "At turn of sun in summer / were the knights arrived\nAt mighty Etzel’s palace. / Ne’er hath monarch lived\nThat lordly guests did welcome / with higher compliment.\nWhen come was time of eating, / the king with them to table went.",
        "1817",
        "Amid his guests more stately / a host was seated ne’er.\nThey had in fullest measure / of drink and goodly fare;\nWhate’er they might desire, / they ready found the same.\nTales of mickle wonder / had spread abroad the heroes’ fame.",
