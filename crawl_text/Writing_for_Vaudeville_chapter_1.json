        "Can you be taught how to write for vaudeville?  If you have the\nnative gift, what experienced writers say about its problems, what\nthey themselves have accomplished, and the means by which it has\nbeen wrought, will be of help to you.  So much this book offers,\nand more I would not claim for it.",
        "Although this volume is the first treatise on the subject of which\nI know, it is less an original offering than a compilation.  Growing\nout of a series of articles written in collaboration with Mr.\nWilliam C. Lengel for The Green Book Magazine, the subject assumed\nsuch bigness in my eyes that when I began the writing of this book,\nI spent months harvesting the knowledge of others to add to my own\nexperience.  With the warm-heartedness for which vaudevillians are\nfamous, nearly everyone whose aid I asked lent assistance gladly.\n“It is vaudeville’s first book,” said more than one, deprecating\nthe value of his own suggestions, “and we want it right in each\nslightest particular.”",
        "To the following kindly gentlemen I wish to express my especial\nthanks:  Aaron Hoffman, Edwin Hopkins, James Madison, Edgar Allan\nWoolf, Richard Harding Davis–the foremost example of a writer who\nmade a famous name first in literature and afterward in\nvaudeville–Arthur Hopkins, Taylor Granville, Junie McCree, Arthur\nDenvir, Frank Fogarty, Irving Berlin, Charles K. Harris, L. Wolfe\nGilbert, Ballard MacDonald, Louis Bernstein, Joe McCarthy, Joseph\nHart, Joseph Maxwell, George A. Gottlieb, Daniel F. Hennessy,\nSime Silverman, Thomas J. Gray, William C. Lengel, Miss Nellie\nRevell, the “big sister of vaudeville,” and a host of others whose\nnames space does not permit my naming again here, but whose work\nis evidenced in the following pages.  To Alexander Black, the man\nwho made the first picture play twenty-one years ago, I owe thanks\nfor points in the discussion of dramatic values.  And for many\nhelpful suggestions, and his kindly editing, I wish to express my\ngratitude to Dr. J. Berg Esenwein.  To these “friends indeed\"\nbelongs whatever merit this book possesses.",
