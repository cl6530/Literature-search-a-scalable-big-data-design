        "Whisperings!  Always whisperings, low, sibilant, floating errantly\nfrom all sides, until they seemed a component part of the drug-laden\natmosphere itself.  And occasionally another sound: the soft SLAP-\nSLAP of loose-slippered feet, the faint rustle of equally loose-\nfitting garments.  And everywhere the sweet, sickish smell of opium.\nIt was Chang Foo’s, simply a cellar or two deeper in Chang Foo’s\nthan that in which Dago Jim had quarrelled once–and died!",
        "Larry the Bat, vicious-faced, unkempt, disreputable, lay sprawled\nout on one of the dive’s bunks, an opium pipe beside him.  But Larry\nthe Bat was not smoking; instead, his ear was pressed closely\nagainst the boarding that formed the rather flimsy partition at the\nside of the bunk.  One heard many things in Chang Foo’s if one cared\nto listen–if one could first win one’s way through the carefully\nguarded gateway, that to the uninitiated offered nothing more\ninteresting than the entrance to a Chinese tea-shop, and an\nuninviting one at that!",
        "HAD HE BEEN FOLLOWED IN HERE?  He had been shadowed for the last\nhour; of that, at least, he was certain.  Why?  By whom?  For an\nhour he had dodged in and out through the dens of the underworld, as\nonly one who was at home there and known to all could do–and at\nlast he had taken refuge in Chang Foo’s like a fox burrowing deep\ninto its hole.",
        "Few could find their way into the most infamous opium den in all New\nYork, where not only the poppy ruled as master, but where crime was\nhatched, ay, and carried to its ghastly consummation, sometimes, as\nwell; and of those few, not one but was of the underworld itself.\nAnd it was that fact which held his muscles strained and rigid now\nunder the miserable rags that covered them, and it was that which\nkept the keen, quick brain alert and active, every faculty keyed up\nand tense.  If it were the police, he had little to fear, for they\ncould not force their way in without warning; but if it were the\nunderworld, he was in imminent peril, and had done little better\nthan run himself into a trap from which there was no escape.",
        "“DEATH TO THE GRAY SEAL!\"–he had heard that whispered more than\nonce in this very place.  Who knew at what moment the role of Larry\nthe Bat would be uncovered, and the underworld, where now he held so\nhigh a place, would be at his throat like a pack of snarling wolves!\nWho had been shadowing him during the last hour?",
        "Whisperings!  Nothing tangible!  He could catch no words.  Only the\nnever-ending whisperings of gathered groups here and there–and\nsometimes the clink of coin where some game was in progress.",
        "The curtain before his bunk was drawn suddenly aside–and Larry the\nBat’s fingers, where his hand was carelessly hidden by his body\ntightened upon his automatic.",
        "“Smokee some more?”",
        "The fingers relaxed.  It was only Sam Wah, one of the attendants.",
        "“Nix!” said Larry the Bat, in a slightly muddled tone.  “Got\nenough.”",
        "The curtain fell into place again.  Larry the Bat’s lips set in a\nthin smile.  Ultimately it made little difference whether it was the\npolice or the underworld!  The smile grew thinner.  It was the flip\nof a coin, that was all!  With one there was the death house at Sing\nSing for the Gray Seal; with the other–well, there were many ways,\nfrom a shot or a knife thrust in the open street, to his murder in\nsome hidden dive like this of Chang Foo’s, for instance, where he\nnow was–the Gray Seal was responsible for the occupancy of too many\npenitentiary cells by those of the underworld to look for any other\nfate!",
        "He raised himself up sharply on his elbow.  A shrill, high note,\nlike the scream of a parrakeet, rang out a second time.  He tore the\ncurtain aside, and jumped to his feet.  All around him, in the\ntwinkling of an eye, Chinamen in fluttering blouses, chattering like\nmagpies, mingled with snarling, cursing whites, were running madly.\nA voice, prefaced with an oath, bawled out behind him, as he sprang\nforward and joined the rush:",
        "“Beat it!  De cops!  Beat it!”",
        "The police!  A raid!  Was it for HIM?  From rooms, an amazing number\nof them, more forms rushed out, joined, divided, separated, and\ndashed, some this way, some that, along branching passageways.\nThere had been raids before, the police had begun to change their\nminds about Chang Foo’s, but Chang Foo’s was not an easy place to\nraid.  House after house in that quarter of Chinese laundries, of\ntea shops, of chop-suey joints, opened one into the other through\nsecret passages in the cellars.  Larry the Bat plunged down a\nstaircase, and halted in the darkness of a cellar, drawing back\nagainst the wall while the flying feet of his fellow fugitives\nscurried by him.",
        "Was it for HIM, this raid?  If not, the police had not a hope of\ngetting him if he kept his head; for back in Chang Foo’s proper,\nwhich would be quite closed off now, Chang Foo would be blandly\nsubmitting to arrest, offering himself as a sort of glorified\nsacrifice while the police confiscated opium and fan-tan layouts.\nIf the police had no other purpose than that in mind, Chang Foo\nwould simply pay a fine; the next night the place would be in full\nblast again; and Chang Foo, higher than ever in the confidence of\nthe underworld’s aristocracy, would reap his reward–and that would\nbe all there was to it.",
        "But was that all?  The raid had followed significantly close upon\nthe heels of his entry into Chang Foo’s.  Larry the Bat began to\nmove forward again.  He dared not follow the others, and, later on,\nwhen quiet was restored, issue out into the street from any one of\nthe various houses in which he might temporarily have taken refuge.\nThere was a chance in that, a chance that the police might be more\nzealous than usual, even if he particularly was not their game–and\nhe could take no chance.  Arrest for Larry the Bat, even on\nsuspicion, could have but one conclusion–not a pleasant one–the\ndisclosure that Larry the Bat was not Larry the Bat at all, but\nJimmie Dale, the millionaire club-man, and, to complete a fatal\ntriplication, that Larry the Bat and Jimmie Dale was the Gray Seal\nupon whose head was fixed a price!",
        "All was silence around him now, except that from overhead came\noccasionally the muffled tread of feet.  He felt his way along into\na black, narrow passage, emerged into a second cellar, swept the\nplace with a single, circling gleam from a pocket flashlight, passed\na stairway that led upward, reached the opposite wall, and, dropping\non hands and knees, crawled into what, innocently enough, appeared\nto be the opening of a coal bin.",
        "He knew Chang Foo’s well–as he knew the ins and outs of every den\nand place he frequented, knew them as a man knows such things when\nhis life at any moment might hang upon his knowledge.",
        "He was in another passage now, and this, in a few steps, brought him\nto a door.  Here he halted, and stood for a full five minutes,\nabsolutely motionless, absolutely still, listening.  There was\nnothing–not a sound.  He tried the door cautiously.  It was locked.\nThe slim, sensitive, tapering fingers of Jimmie Dale, unrecognisable\nnow in the grimy digits of Larry the Bat, felt tentatively over the\nlock.  To fingers that seemed in their tips to possess all the human\nsenses, that time and again in their delicate touch upon the dial of\na safe had mocked at human ingenuity and driven the police into\nimpotent frenzy, this was a pitiful thing.  From his pocket came a\nsmall steel instrument that was quickly and deftly inserted in the\nkeyhole.  There was a click, the door swung open, and Jimmie Dale,\nalias Larry the Bat, stepped outside into a back yard half a block\naway from the entrance to Chang Foo’s.",
        "Again he listened.  There did not appear to be any unusual\nexcitement in the neighbourhood.  From open windows above him and\nfrom adjoining houses came the ordinary, commonplace sounds of\nvoices talking and laughing, even the queer, weird notes of a\nChinese chant.  He stole noiselessly across the yard, out into the\nlane, and made his way rapidly along to the cross street.",
        "In a measure, now, he was safe; but one thing, a very vital thing,\nremained to be done.  It was absolutely necessary that he should\nknow whether he was the quarry that the police had been after in the\nraid, if it was the police who had been shadowing him all evening.\nIf it was the police, there was but one meaning to it–Larry the Bat\nwas known to be the Gray Seal, and a problem perilous enough in any\naspect confronted him.  Dare he risk the Sanctuary–for the clothes\nof Jimmie Dale?  Or was it safer to burglarise, as he had once done\nbefore, his own mansion on Riverside Drive?",
        "His thoughts were running riot, and he frowned, angry with himself.\nThere was time enough to think of that when he knew that it was the\npolice against whom he had to match his wits.",
        "Well in the shadow of the buildings, he moved swiftly along the side\nstreet until he came to the corner of the street on which, halfway\ndown the block, fronted Chang Foo’s tea-shop.  A glance in that\ndirection, and Jimmie Dale drew a breath of relief.  A patrol wagon\nwas backed up to the curb, and a half dozen officers were busy\nloading it with what was evidently Chang Foo’s far from meagre stock\nof gambling appurtenances; while Chang Foo himself, together with\nSam Wah and another attendant, were in the grip of two other\nofficers, waiting possibly for another patrol wagon.  There was a\ncrowd, too, but the crowd was at a respectful distance–on the\nopposite side of the street.",
        "Jimmie Dale still hugged the corner.  A man swaggered out from a\ndoorway, quite close to Chang Foo’s, and came on along the street.\nAs the other reached the corner, Jimmie Dale sidled forward.",
        "“’Ello, Chick!” he said, out of the corner of his mouth.  “Wot’s de\nlay?”",
        "“’Ello, Larry!” returned the other.  “Aw, nuthin’!  De nutcracker on\nChang, dat’s all.”",
        "“I t’ought mabbe dey was lookin’ for some guy dat was in dere,\"\nobserved Jimmie Dale.",
        "“Nuthin’ doin’!” the other answered.  “I was in dere meself.  De\nwhole mob beat it clean, an’ de bulls never batted an eye.  Didn’t\nyouse pipe me make me get-away outer Shanghai’s a minute ago?  De\nbulls never went nowhere except into Chang’s.  Dere’s a new\nlootenant in de precinct inaugeratin’ himself, dat’s all.  S’long,\nLarry–I gotta date.”",
        "“S’long, Chick!” responded Jimmie Dale–and started slowly back\nalong the cross street.",
        "It was not the police, then, who were interested in his movements!\nThen who?  He shook his head with a little, savage, impotent\ngesture.  One thing was clear: it was too early to risk a return to\nthe Sanctuary and attempt the rehabilitation of Jimmie Dale.  If any\none was on the hunt for Larry the Bat, the Sanctuary would be the\nlast place to be overlooked.",
        "He turned the next corner, hesitated a moment in front of a garishly\nlighted dance hall, and finally shuffled in through the door, made\nhis way across the floor, nodding here and there to the elite of\ngangland, and, with a somewhat arrogant air of proprietorship, sat\ndown at a table in the corner.  Little better than a tramp in\nappearance, certainly the most disreputable-looking object in the\nplace, even the waiter who approached him accorded him a certain\ncurious deference–was not Larry the Bat the most celebrated dope\nfiend below the dead line?",
        "“Gimme a mug o’ suds!” ordered Jimmie Dale, and sprawled royally\nback in his chair.",
        "Under the rim of his slouch hat, pulled now far over his eyes, he\nsearched the faces around him.  If he had been asked to pick the\nactors for a revel from the scum of the underworld, he could not\nhave improved upon the gathering.  There were perhaps a hundred men\nand women in the room, the majority dancing, and, with the exception\nof a few sight-seeing slummers, they were men and women whose\nacquaintance with the police was intimate but not cordial–far from\ncordial.",
        "Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders, and sipped at the glass that had\nbeen set before him.  It was grimly ironic that he should be, not\nonly there, but actually a factor and a part of the underworld’s\nintimate life!  He, Jimmie Dale, a wealthy man, a member of New\nYork’s exclusive clubs, a member of New York’s most exclusive\nsociety!  It was inconceivable.  He smiled sardonically.  Was it?\nWell, then, it was none the less true.  His life unquestionably was\none unique, apart from any other man’s, but it was, for all that,\nactual and real.",
        "There had been three years of it now–since SHE had come into his\nlife.  Jimmie Dale slouched down a little in his chair.  The ice was\nthin, perilously thin, that he was skating on now.  Each letter,\nwith its demand upon him to match his wits against police or\nunderworld, or against both combined, perhaps, made that peril a\nlittle greater, a little more imminent–if that were possible, when\nalready his life was almost literally carried, daily, hourly, in his\nhand.  Not that he rebelled against it; it was worth the price that\nsome day he expected he must pay–the price of honour, wealth, a\nname disgraced, ruin, death.  Was he quixotic?  Immoderately so?  He\nsmiled gravely.  Perhaps.  But he would do it all over again if the\nchoice were his.  There were those who blessed the name of the Gray\nSeal, as well as those who cursed it.  And there was the Tocsin!",
        "Who was she?  He did not know, but he knew that he had come to love\nher, come to care for her, and that she had come to mean everything\nin life to him.  He had never seen her, to know her face.  He had\nnever seen her face, but he knew her voice–ay, he had even held her\nfor a moment, the moment of wildest happiness he had ever known, in\nhis arms.  That night when he had entered his library, his own\nparticular den in his own house, and in the darkness had found her\nthere–found her finally through no effort of his own, when he had\nsearched so fruitlessly for years to find her, using every resource\nat his command to find her!  And she, because she had come of her\nown volition, relying upon him, had held him in honour to let her go\nas she had come–without looking upon her face!  Exquisite irony!\nBut she had made him a promise then–that the work of the Gray Seal\nwas nearly over–that soon there would be an end to the mystery that\nsurrounded her–that he should know all–that he should know HER.",
        "He smiled again, but it was a twisted smile on the mechanically\nmisshapen lips of Larry the Bat.  NEARLY over!  Who knew?  That\n\"nearly” might be too late!  Even tonight he had been shadowed, was\nskulking even now in this place as a refuge.  Who knew?  Another\nhour, and the newsboys might be shrieking their “Uxtra!  Uxtra!  De\nGray Seal caught!  De millionaire Jimmie Dale de Jekyll an’ Hyde of\nreal life!”",
        "Jimmie Dale straightened up suddenly in his seat.  There was a\nshout, an oath bawled out high above the riot of noise, a chorus of\nfeminine shrieks from across the room.  What was the matter with the\nunderworld to-night?  He seemed fated to find nothing but centres of\ndisturbance– first a raid at Chang Foo’s, and now this.  What was\nthe matter here?  They were stampeding toward him from the other\nside of the room.  There was the roar of a revolver shot–another.\nBlack Ike!  He caught an instant’s glimpse of the gunman’s distorted\nface through the crowd.  That was it probably–a row over some moll.",
        "And then, as Jimmie Dale lunged up from his chair to his feet to\nescape the rush, pandemonium itself seemed to break loose.  Yells,\nshots, screams, and oaths filled the air.  The crowd surged this way\nand that.  Tables were overturned and sent crashing to the floor.\nAnd then came sudden darkness, as some one of the attendants in\nmisguided excitability switched off the lights.",
        "The darkness but served to increase the panic, not allay it.  With a\nsavage snap of his jaws, Jimmie Dale swung from his table in the\ncorner with the intention of making his way out by a side door\nbehind him–it was a case of the police again, and the patrolman\noutside would probably be pulling a riot call by now.  And the\npolice–  He stopped suddenly, as though he had been struck.  An\nenvelope, thrust there out of the darkness, was in his hand; and her\nvoice, HERS, the Tocsin’s, was sounding in his ears:",
        "“Jimmie!  Jimmie!  I’ve been trying all evening to catch you!\nQuick!  Get to the Sanctuary and change your clothes.  There’s not\nan instant to lose!  It’s for my sake to-night!”",
        "And then a surging mob was around him on every side, and, pushing,\njostling, half lifting him at times from his feet, carried him\nforward with its rush, and with him in its midst burst through the\ndoor and out into the street.",
        "Not a sound as the key turned in the lock; not a sound as the door\nswung back on its carefully oiled hinges; not a sound as Larry the\nBat slipped like a shadow into the blackness of the room, closing\nthe door behind him again.  With a tread as noiseless as a cat’s, he\nwas across the room to satisfy himself that the shutters were\ntightly closed; and then the single gas jet flared up, murky,\nyellow, illuminating the miserable, squalid room–the Sanctuary–the\nhome of Larry the Bat.  There was need for silence, need for\ncaution.  In five minutes, ten at the outside, he must emerge again–\nas Jimmie Dale.",
        "With a smile on his lips that mingled curiously chagrin and self-\ncommiseration, he took the letter from his pocket and tore it open.\nIt was she, then, who had been following him all evening, and, like\na blundering idiot, he had wasted precious, perhaps irreparable,\nhours!  What had she meant by “It’s for my sake to-night”?  The\nwords had been ringing in his ears since the moment she had\nwhispered them in that panic-stricken crowd.  Was it not always for\nher sake that he answered these calls to arms?  Was it not always\nfor her sake that he, as the Gray Seal, was–  The mental soliloquy\ncame to an abrupt end.  He had subconsciously read the first\nsentence of the letter, and now, with sudden feverish eagerness and\nexcitement, he was reading it to the last word.",
        "“DEAR PHILANTHROPIC CROOK:  In an hour after you receive this, if\nall goes well, you shall know everything–everything.  Who I am–\nyes, and my name.  It has been more than three years now, hasn’t it?\nIt has been incomprehensible to you, but there has been no other\nway.  I dared not take the chance of discovery by any one; I dared\nnot expose you to the risk of being known by me.  Your life would\nnot have been worth a moment’s purchase.  Oh, Jimmie, am I only\nmaking the mystery more mystifying?  But to-night, I think, I hope,\nI pray that it is all at an end: though against me, and against you\nto-night when you go to help me, is the most powerful and pitiless\norganisation of criminals that the world has ever known; and the\nstake we are playing for is a fortune of millions–and my life.  And\nyet somehow I am afraid now, just because the end is so near, and\nthe victory seems so surely won.  And so, Jimmie, be careful; use\nall that wonderful cleverness of yours as you have never used it\nbefore, and–  But there should be no need for that, it is so simple\na thing that I am going to ask you to do.  Why am I writing so\nillogically!  Nothing, surely, can possibly happen.  This is not\nlike one of my usual letters, is it?  I am beside myself to-night\nwith hope, anxiety, fear, and excitement.",
        "“Listen, then, Jimmie:  Be at the northeast corner of Sixth Avenue\nand Waverly Place at exactly half-past ten.  A taxicab will drive\nup, as though you had signalled it in passing, and the chauffeur\nwill say: “I’ve another fare, in half an hour, sir, but I can get\nyou most anywhere in that time.”  You will be smoking a cigarette.\nToss it out into the street, make any reply you like, and get into\nthe cab.  Give the chauffeur that little ring of mine with the crest\nof the bell and belfry and the motto, “Sonnez le Tocsin,” that you\nfound the night old Isaac Pelina was murdered, and the chauffeur\nwill give you in exchange a sealed packet of papers.  He will drive\nyou to your home, and I will telephone to you there.",
        "“I need not tell you to destroy this.  Keep the appointment in your\nproper person–as Jimmie Dale.  Carry nothing that might identify\nyou as the Gray Seal if any accident should happen.  And, lastly,\ntrust the pseudo chauffeur absolutely.”",
        "There was no signature.  Her letters were never signed.  He stood\nfor a moment staring at the closely written sheets in his hand, a\nheightened colour in his cheeks, his lips pressed tightly together–\nand then his fingers automatically began to tear the letter into\npieces, and the pieces again into little shreds.  To-night!  It was\nto be to-night, the end of all this mystery.  To-night was to see\nthe end of this dual life of his, with its constant peril!  To-night\nthe Gray Seal was to exit from the stage forever!  To-night, a\nwonderful climax of the years, he was to see HER!",
        "His blood was quickened now, his heart pounding in a faster beat; a\nmad elation, a fierce uplift was upon him.  He thrust the torn bits\nof paper into his pocket hurriedly, stepped across the room to the\ncorner, rolled back the oilcloth, and lifted up the loose plank in\nthe flooring, so innocently dustladen, as, more than once, to have\neluded the eyes of inquisitive visitors in the shape of police and\nplain clothes men from headquarters.",
        "From the space beneath he removed a neatly folded pile of clothes,\nlaid these on the bed, and began to undress.  He was working rapidly\nnow.  Tiny pieces of wax were removed from his nostrils, from under\nhis lips, from behind his ears; water from a cracked pitcher poured\ninto a battered tin basin, and mixed with a few drops of some liquid\nfrom a bottle which he procured from its hiding place under the\nflooring, banished the make-up stain from his face, his neck, his\nwrists, and hands as if by magic.  It was a strange metamorphosis\nthat had taken place–the coarse, brutal-featured, blear-eyed,\nleering countenance of Larry the Bat was gone, and in its place,\nclean-cut, square-jawed, clear-eyed, was the face of Jimmie Dale.\nAnd where before had slouched a slope-shouldered, misshapen, flabby\ncreature, a broad-shouldered form well over six feet in height now\nstood erect, and under the clean white skin the muscles of an\nathlete, like knobs of steel played back and forth with every\nmovement of his body.",
        "In the streaked and broken mirror Jimmie Dale surveyed himself\ncritically, methodically, and, with a nod of satisfaction, hastily\ndonned the fashionably cut suit of tweeds upon the bed.  He rummaged\nthen through the ragged garments he had just discarded, transferred\nto his pockets a roll of bills and his automatic, and paused\nhesitantly, staring at the thin metal case, like a cigarette case,\nthat he held in the palm of his hand.  He shrugged his shoulders a\nlittle whimsically; it seemed strange indeed that he was through\nwith that!  He snapped it open.  Within, between sheets of oil\npaper, lay the scores of little diamond-shaped, gray-coloured,\nadhesive paper seals–the insignia of the Gray Seal.  Yes, it seemed\nstrange that he was never to use another!  He closed the case,\ngathered up the clothes of Larry the Bat, tucked the case in among\nthem, and shoved the bundle into the hole under the flooring.  All\nthese things would have to be destroyed, but there was not time to-\nnight; to-morrow, or the next day, would do for that.  What would it\nbe like to live a normal life again, without the menace of danger\nlurking on every hand, without that grim slogan of the underworld,\n\"Death to the Gray Seal!” or that savage fiat of the police, “The\nGray Seal, dead or alive–but the Gray Seal!” forever ringing in his\nears?  What would it be like, this new life–with her?",
        "The thought was thrilling him again, bringing again that eager,\nexultant uplift.  In an hour, ONE hour, and the barriers of years\nwould be swept away, and she would be in his arms!",
        "“It’s for my sake to-night!”  His face grew suddenly tense, as the\nwords came back to him.  That “hour” wasn’t over yet!  It was no\nhysterical exaggeration that had prompted her to call her enemies\nthe most powerful and pitiless organisation of criminals that the\nworld had ever known.  It was not the Tocsin’s way to exaggerate.\nThe words would be literally true.  The very life she had led for\nthe three years that had gone stood out now as a grim proof of her\nassertion.",
        "Jimmie Dale replaced the flooring, carefully brushed the dust back\ninto the cracks, spread the oilcloth into place, and stood up.  Who\nand what was this organisation?  What was between it and the Tocsin?\nWhat was this immense fortune that was at stake?  And what was this\npriceless packet that was so crucial, that meant victory now, ay,\nand her life, too, she had said?",
        "The questions swept upon him in a sort of breathless succession.\nWhy had she not let him play a part in this?  True, she had told him\nwhy–that she dared not expose him to the risk.  Risk!  Was there\nany risk that the Gray Seal had not taken, and at her instance!  He\ndid not understand, he smiled a little uncertainly, as he reached up\nto turn out the gas.  There were a good many things that he did not\nunderstand about the Tocsin!",
        "The room was in darkness, and with the darkness Jimmie Dale’s mind\ncentred on the work immediately before him.  To enter the tenement\nwhere he was known and had an acknowledged right as Larry the Bat\nwas one thing; for Jimmie Dale to be discovered there was quite\nanother.",
        "He crossed the room, opened the door silently, stood for a moment\nlistening, then stepped out into the black, musty, ill-smelling\nhallway, closing the door behind him.  He stooped and locked it.\nThe querulous cry of a child reached him from somewhere above–a\nmurmur of voices, muffled by closed doors, from everywhere.  How\nmany families were housed beneath that sordid roof he had never\nknown, only that there was miserable poverty there as well as vice\nand crime, only that Larry the Bat, who possessed a room all to\nhimself, was as some lordly and super-being to these fellow tenants\nwho shared theirs with so many that there was not air enough for all\nto breathe.",
        "He had no doors to pass–his was next to the staircase.  He began to\ndescend.  They could scream and shriek, those stairs, like aged\nhumans, twisted and rheumatic, at the least ungentle touch.  But\nthere was no sound from them now.  There seemed something almost\nuncanny in the silent tread.  Stair after stair he descended, his\nentire weight thrown gradually upon one foot before the other was\nlifted.  The strain upon the muscles, trained and hardened as they\nwere, told.  As he moved from the bottom step, he wiped little beads\nof perspiration from his forehead.",
        "The door, now, that gave on the alleyway!  He opened it, slipped\noutside, darted across the narrow lane, stole along where the\nshadows of the fence were blackest, paused, listening, as he reached\nthe end of the alleyway, to assure himself that there was no near-by\npedestrian–and stepped out into the street.",
        "He kept on along the block, turned into the Bowery, and, under the\nfirst lamp, consulted his watch.  It was a quarter past ten.  He\ncould make it easily in a leisurely walk.  He continued on up the\nBowery, finally crossed to Broadway, and shortly afterward turned\ninto Waverly Place.  At the corner of Fifth Avenue he consulted his\nwatch again–and now he lighted a cigarette.  Sixth Avenue was only\na block away.  At precisely half-past ten, to the second, he halted\non the designated corner, smoking nonchalantly.",
        "A taxicab, coincidentally coming from an uptown direction, swung in\nto the curb.",
        "“Taxi, sir?  Yes, sir?”  Then, with an admirable mingling of\neagerness to secure the fare and a fear that his confession might\ncause him the loss of it: “I’ve another fare in half an hour, sir,\nbut I can get you most anywhere in that time.”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s cigarette was tossed carelessly into the street.",
        "“St. James Club!” he said curtly, and stepped into the cab.",
        "The cab started forward, turned the corner, and headed along Waverly\nPlace toward Broadway.  The chauffeur twisted around in his seat in\na matter-of-fact way, as though to ask further directions.",
        "“Have you anything for me?” he inquired casually.",
        "It lay where it always lay, that ring, between the folds of that\nlittle white glove in his pocketbook.  Jimmie Dale took it out now,\nand handed it silently to the chauffeur.",
        "The other’s face changed instantly–composure was gone, and a quick,\nstrained look was in its place.",
        "“I’m afraid I’ve been watched,” he said tersely.  “Look behind you,\nwill you, and tell me if you see anything?”",
        "Jimmie Dale glanced backward through the little window in the hood.",
        "“There’s another taxi just turned in from Sixth Avenue,” he reported\nthe next instant.",
        "“Keep your eye on it!” instructed the chauffeur shortly.",
        "The speed of the cab increased sensibly.",
        "With a curious tightening of his lips, Jimmie Dale settled himself\nin his seat so that he could watch the cab behind.  There was\ntrouble coming, intuitively he sensed that; and, he reflected\nbitterly, he might have known!  It was too marvellous, too wonderful\never to come to pass that this one hour, the thought of which had\nfired his blood and made him glad beyond any gladness life had ever\nheld for him before, should bring its promised happiness.",
        "“Where’s the cab now?” the chauffeur flung back over his shoulder.",
        "They had passed Fifth Avenue, and were nearing Broadway.",
        "“About the same distance behind,” Jimmie Dale answered.",
        "“That looks bad!” the chauffeur gritted between his teeth.  “We’ll\nhave to make sure.  I’ll run down Lower Broadway.”",
        "“If you think we’re followed,” suggested Jimmie Dale quietly, “why\nnot run uptown and give them the slip somewhere where the traffic is\nthick?  Lower Broadway at this time of night is as empty and\ndeserted as a country road.”",
        "The chauffeur’s sudden laugh was mirthless.",
        "“My God, you don’t know what you are talking about!” he burst out.\n\"If they’re following, all hell couldn’t throw them off the track.\nAnd I’ve got to know, I’ve got to be SURE before I dare make a move\nto-night.  I couldn’t tell up in the crowded districts if I was\nfollowed, could I?  They won’t come out into the open until their\nhands are forced.”",
        "The car swerved sharply, rounded the corner, and, speeding up faster\nand faster, began to tear down Lower Broadway.",
        "“Watch!  WATCH!” cried the chauffeur.",
        "There was no word between them for a moment; then Jimmie Dale spoke\ncrisply:",
        "“It’s turned the corner!  It’s coming this way!”",
        "The taxicab was rocking violently with the speed; silent, empty,\nLower Broadway stretched away ahead.  Apart from an occasional\nstreet car, probably there would be nothing between them and the\nBattery.  Jimmie Dale glanced at his companion’s face as a light,\nflashing by, threw it into relief.  It was set and stern, even a\nlittle haggard; but, too, there was something else there, something\nthat appealed instantly to Jimmie Dale–a sort of bulldog grit that\ndominated it.",
        "“If he holds our speed, we’ll know!” the chauffeur was shouting now\nto make himself heard over the roar of the car.  “Look again!  Where\nis it now?”",
        "Once more Jimmie Dale looked through the little rear window.  The\ncab had been a block behind them when it had turned the corner, and\nhe watched it now in a sort of grim fascination.  There was no\npossible doubt of it!  The two bobbing, bouncing headlights were\ncreeping steadily nearer.  And then a sort of unnatural calm settled\nupon Jimmie Dale, and his hand went mechanically to his pocket to\nfeel his automatic there, as he turned again to the chauffeur.",
        "“If you’ve got any more speed, you’d better use it!” he said\nsignificantly.",
        "The man shot a quick look at him.",
        "“They are following us?  You are SURE?”",
        "“Yes,” said Jimmie Dale.",
        "The chauffeur laughed again in that mirthless, savage way.",
        "“Lean over here, where I can talk to you!” he rasped out.  “The\ngame’s up, as far as I am concerned, I guess!  But there’s a chance\nfor you.  They don’t know you in this.”",
        "“Give her more speed–or dodge into a cross street!” suggested\nJimmie Dale coolly.  “They haven’t got us yet, by a long way!”",
        "The other shook his head.",
        "“It’s not only that cab behind,” he answered, through set lips.\n\"You don’t know what we’re up against.  If they’re really after us,\nthere’s a trap laid in every section of this city–the devils!  It’s\nthe package they want.  Thank God for the presentiment that made me\nleave it behind!  I was going back for it, you understand, if I was\nsatisfied that we weren’t followed.  Listen!  There’s a chance for\nyou–there’s none for me.  That package–remember this!–no one else\nknows where it is, and it’s life and death to the one who sent you\nhere.  It’s in Box 428 at–  My God, LOOK!  Look there!” he yelled,\nand, with a wrench at the wheel, sent the taxi lurching and\nstaggering for the car tracks in the centre of the street.",
        "The scene, fast as thought itself, was photographing itself in every\ndetail upon Jimmie Dale’s brain.  From the cross street ahead, one\nfrom each corner, two motor cars had nosed out into Broadway,\nblocking the road on both sides.  And now the car on the left-hand\nside was moving forward across the tracks to counteract the\nchauffeur’s move, deliberately insuring a collision.  There was no\nchance, no further room to turn, no time to stop–the man driving\nthe other car jumped for safety–they would be into it in an\ninstant.",
        "“Box 428!” Jimmie pleaded fiercely.  “Go on, man!  Go on!  FINISH!”",
        "“Yes!” cried the chauffeur.  “John Johansson, at–”",
        "But Jimmie Dale heard no more.  There was the crash of impact as the\ntaxicab plowed into the car that had been so craftily manoeuvered in\nfront of it, and Jimmie Dale, lifted from his feet, was hurled\nviolently forward with the shock, and all went black before his\neyes.",
        "For what length of time he had remained unconscious, Jimmie Dale had\nnot the slightest idea.  He regained his senses to find himself\nlying on a couch in a strange room that had a most exquisitely\nbrass-wrought dome light in the ceiling.  That was what attracted\nhis attention, because the light hurt his eyes, and his head was\nalready throbbing as though a thousand devils were beating a\ndiabolical tattoo upon it.",
        "He closed his eyes against the light.  Where was he?  What had\nhappened?  Oh, yes, he remembered now!  That smash on Lower\nBroadway!  He had been hurt.  He moved first one limb and then\nanother tentatively, and was relieved to find that, though his body\nached as if it had been severely shaken, and his head was bad, he\nhad apparently escaped without serious injury.",
        "Where was he?  In a hospital?  His fingers, resting at his side upon\nthe couch, supplied him with the information that it was a very\nexpensive couch, upholstered in finest leather.  If he were in a\nhospital, he would be in a cot.",
        "He opened his eyes again to glance curiously around him.  The room\nwas quite in keeping with the artistic lighting fixture and the\nrefined, if expensive, taste that was responsible for the couch.  A\nheavy velvet rug of rich, dark green was bordered by a polished\nhardwood floor; panellings of dark-green frieze and beautifully\ngrained woodwork made the lower walls; while above, on a background\nof some soft-toned paper, hung a few, and evidently choice, oil\npaintings.  There was a big, inviting lounging chair; a massive\nwriting table, or more properly, a desk of walnut; and behind the\ndesk, his back half turned, apparently intent upon a book, sat a man\nin immaculate evening dress.",
        "Jimmie Dale closed his eyes again.  There was something reassuring\nabout it all, comfortably reassuring.  Though why there should be\nany occasion for a feeling of reassurance at all, he could not for\nthe moment make out.  And then, in a sudden flash, the details of\nthe night came back to him.  The Tocsin’s letter–the package he was\nto get–the taxicab–the chauffeur, who was not a chauffeur–the\nchase–the trap.  He lay perfectly still.  It was the professional\nJimmie Dale now whose brain, in spite of the throbbing, brutally\naching head, was at work, keen, alert.",
        "The chauffeur!  What had happened to him?  Had the man been killed\nin the auto smash; or, less fortunate than himself, fallen into the\nhands of those whose power he seemed both to fear and rate so\nhighly?  And that package!  Box–what was the number?–yes, 428.\nWhat did that mean?  What box?  Where was it?  Who was John\nJohansson?  He hadn’t heard any more than that; the smash had come\nthen.  And lastly, he was back again to the same question he had\nbegun with: Where was he now himself?  It looked as though some good\nSamaritan had picked him up.  Who was this gentleman so quietly\nreading there at the desk?",
        "Jimmie Dale opened his eyes for the third time.  How still, how\nabsolutely silent the room was!  He studied the man’s back\nspeculatively for a moment, then his gaze travelled on past the man\nto the wall, riveted there, and his fingers, without movement of his\narm, pressed against the outside of his coat pocket.  He thought as\nmuch!  His automatic was gone!",
        "Not a muscle of Jimmie Dale’s face moved.  His eyes shifted to a\npicture on the wall.  THE MAN WAS WATCHING HIM–NOT READING!  Just\nabove the level of the desk, a small mirror held the couch in focus–\nbut, equally, it held the man in focus, and Jimmie Dale had seen\nthe other’s eyes, through a black mask that covered the face to the\ntop of the upper lip, fixed intently upon him.",
        "There was a chill now where before there had been reassurance,\nsomething ominous in the very quiet and refinement of the room; and\nJimmie Dale smiled inwardly in bitter irony–his good Samaritan wore\na mask!  His self-congratulations had come too soon.  Whatever had\nhappened to the chauffeur, it was evident enough that he himself was\ncaught!  What was it the chauffeur had said?  Something about a\nchance through being unknown.  Was it to be a battle of wits, then?\nGod, if his head did not ache so frightfully!  It was hard to think\nwith the brain half sick with pain.",
        "Those two eyes shining in that mirror!  There seemed something\nhorribly spectre-like about it.  He did not look again, but he knew\nthey were there.  It was like a cat watching a mouse.  Why did not\nthe man speak, or move, or do something, and–  He turned his head\nslowly; the man was laughing in a low, amused way.",
        "“You appear to be taken with that picture,” observed a pleasant\nvoice.  “Perhaps you recognise it from there?  It is a Corot.”",
        "Jimmie Dale, with a well-simulated start, sat up–and, with another\nquite as well simulated, stared at the masked man.  The other had\nlaid down his book, and swung around in his chair to face the couch.\nJimmie Dale stood up a little shakily.",
        "“Look here!” he said awkwardly.  “I–I don’t quite understand.  I\nremember that my taxi got into a smash-up, and I suppose I have to\nthank you for the assistance you must have rendered me; only, as I\nsay\"–he looked in a puzzled way around the room, and in an even\nmore perplexed way at the mask on the other’s face–\"I must confess\nI am at a loss to understand quite the meaning of this.”",
        "“Suppose that instead of trying to understand you simply accept\nthings as you find them.”  The voice was soft, but there was a\nfinality in it that its blandness only served to make the more\nsuggestive.",
        "Jimmie Dale drew himself up, and bowed coldly.",
        "“I beg your pardon,” he said.  “I did not mean to intrude.  I have\nonly to thank you again, then, and bid you good-night.”",
        "The lips beneath the mask parted slightly in a politely deprecating\nsmile.",
        "“There is no hurry,” said the man, a sudden sharpness creeping into\nhis tones.  “I am sorry that the rule I apply to you does not work\nboth ways.  For instance, I might be quite at a loss to account for\nyour presence in that taxicab.”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s smile was equally polite, equally deprecating.",
        "“I fail to see how it could be of the slightest possible interest to\nyou,” he replied.  “However, I have no objection to telling you.  I\nhailed the taxi at the corner of Sixth Avenue and Waverly Place,\ntold the chauffeur to drive me to the St. James Club, and–”",
        "“The St. James Club,” broke in the other coldly, “is, I believe,\nnorth, not SOUTH of Waverly Place–and on Broadway not at all.”",
        "Jimmie Dale stared at the other for an instant in patient annoyance.",
        "“I am quite well aware of that,” he said stiffly.  “Nevertheless I\ntold the man to drive me to the St. James Club.  We came across\nWaverly Place, but on reaching Broadway, instead of turning uptown,\nhe suddenly whirled in the other direction and sent the car flying\nat full speed down Lower Broadway.  I shouted at the man.  I don’t\nknow yet whether he was drunk or crazy or\"–Jimmie Dale’s eyes fixed\ndisdainfully on the other’s mask–\"whether there might not, after\nall, have been method in his madness.  I can only say that before we\nhad gone more than two or three blocks, a wild effort on his part to\navoid a collision with an auto swinging out from a side street\nresulted in an even more disastrous smash with another on the other\nside, and I was knocked senseless.”",
        "“’Victim,’ I presume, is the idea you desire to convey,” observed\nthe other evenly.  “You were quite the victim of circumstances, as\nit were!”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyebrows lifted slightly.",
        "“It would appear to be fairly obvious, I should say.”",
        "“Very clever!” commented the man.  “But now suppose we remove the\nbuttons from the foils!”  His voice rasped suddenly.  “You are quite\nas well aware as I am that what has happened to-night was not an\naccident.  Nor–in case the possibility may have occurred to you–\nare the police any the wiser, save for the existence of two wrecked\ncars on Lower Broadway, and another which escaped, and for which\ndoubtless they are still searching assiduously.  The ownership of\nthe taxicab you so inadvertently entered they will have no\ndifficulty in establishing–you, perhaps, however, are in a better\nposition than I am to appreciate the fact that the establishment of\nits ownership will lead them nowhere.  As I understand it, the man\nwho drove you to-night obtained the loan of the cab from one of the\ncompany’s chauffeur’s in return for a hundred-dollar bill.  Am I\nright?”",
        "“In view of what has happened,” admitted Jimmie Dale simply, “I\nshould not be surprised.”",
        "There was a sort of sardonic admiration in the other’s laugh.",
        "“As for the other car,” he went on, “I can assure you that its\nownership will never be known.  When the nearest patrolman rushed\nup, there were no survivors of the disaster, save those in the third\ncar which he was powerless to stop–which accounts for your presence\nhere.  You will admit that I have been quite frank.”",
        "“Oh, quite!” said Jimmie Dale, a little wearily.  “But would you\nmind telling me what all this is leading to?”",
        "The man had been leaning forward in his chair, one hand, palm\ndownward, resting lightly on the desk.  He shifted his hand now\nsuddenly to the arm of his chair.",
        "“THIS!” he said, and on the desk where his hand had been lay the\nTocsin’s gold signet ring.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s face expressed mild curiosity.  He could feel the\nother’s eyes boring into him.",
        "“We were speaking of ownership,” said the man, in a low, menacing\ntone.  “I want to know where the woman who owns this ring can be\nfound to-night.”",
        "There was no play, no trifling here; the man was in deadly earnest.\nBut it seemed to Jimmie Dale, even with the sense of peril more\nimminent with every instant, that he could have laughed outright in\nsavage mockery at the irony of the question.  Where was she?  Even\nWHO was she?  And this was the hour in which he was to have known!",
        "“May I look at it?” he requested calmly.",
        "The other nodded, but his eyes never left Jimmie Dale.",
        "“It will give you an extra moment or so to frame your answer,” he\nsaid sarcastically.",
        "Jimmie Dale ignored the thrust, picked up the ring, examined it\ndeliberately, and set it back again on the table.",
        "“Since I do not know who owns it,” he said, “I cannot answer your\nquestion.”",
        "“No!  Well, then, there is still another matter–a little package\nthat was in the taxicab with you.  Where is that?”",
        "“See here!” said Jimmie Dale irritably.  “This has gone far enough!\nI have seen no package, large or small, or of any description\nwhatever.  You are evidently mistaking me for some one else.  You\nhave only to telephone to the St. James Club.”  He reached toward\nhis pocket for his cardcase.  “My name is–”",
        "“Dale,” supplied the other curtly.  “Don’t bother about the card,\nMr. Dale.  We have already taken the liberty of searching you.”  He\nrose abruptly from his chair.  “I am afraid you do not quite realise\nyour position, Mr. Dale,” he said, with an ominous smile.  “Let me\nmake it clear.  I do not wish to be theatrical about this, but we do\nnot temporise here.  You will either answer both of those questions\nto my satisfaction, OR YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE THIS PLACE ALIVE.”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s face hardened.  His eyes met the other’s steadily.",
        "“Ah, I think I begin to see!” he said caustically.  “When I have\nbeen thoroughly frightened I shall be offered my freedom at a price.\nA sort of up-to-date game of holdup!  The penalty of being a wealthy\nman!  If you had named your figure to begin with, we would have\nsaved a lot of idle talk, and you would have had my answer the\nsooner: NOTHING!”",
        "“Do you know,” said the other, in a grimly musing way, “there has\nalways been one man, but only one until now, that I have wished I\nmight add to my present associates.  I refer to the so-called Gray\nSeal.  To-night there are two.  I pay you the compliment of being\nthe other.  But\"–he was smiling ominously again–\"we are wasting\ntime, Mr. Dale.  I am willing to expose my hand to the extent of\nadmitting that the information you are withholding is infinitely\nmore valuable to me than the mere wreaking of reprisal upon you for\na refusal to talk.  Therefore, if you will answer, I pledge you my\nword you will be free to leave here within five minutes.  If you\nrefuse, you are already aware of the alternative.  Well, Mr. Dale?”",
        "Who was this man?  Jimmie Dale was studying the other’s chin, the\nlips, the white, even teeth, the jet-black hair.  Some day the\ntables might be turned.  Could he recognise again this cool,\nimperturbable ruffian who so callously threatened him with murder?",
        "“Well, Mr. Dale?  I am waiting!”",
        "“I am not a magician,” said Jimmie Dale contemptuously.  “I could\nnot answer your questions if I wanted to.”",
        "The other’s hand slid instantly to a row of electric buttons on the\ndesk.",
        "“Very well, Mr. Dale!” he said quietly.  “You do not believe, I see,\nthat I would dare to carry my threat into execution; you perhaps\neven doubt my power.  I shall take the trouble to convince you–I\nimagine it will stimulate your memory.”",
        "The door opened.  Two men were standing on the threshold, both in\nevening dress, both masked.  The man behind the desk came forward,\ntook Jimmie Dale’s arm almost courteously, and led him from the room\nout into a corridor, where he halted abruptly.",
        "“I want to call your attention first, Mr. Dale, to the fact that as\nfar as you are concerned you neither have now, nor ever will have,\nany idea whether you are in the heart of New York or fifty miles\naway from it.  Now, listen!  Do you hear anything?”",
        "There was nothing.  Only the strange silence of that other room was\nintensified now.  There was not a sound; stillness such as it seemed\nto Jimmie Dale he had never experienced before was around him.",
        "“You may possibly infer from the silence that you are NOT in the\ncity,” suggested the other, after a moment’s pause.  “I leave you to\nyour own conclusions in that respect.  The cause, however, of the\nsilence is internal, not external; we had sound-proof principles in\nmind to a perhaps exaggerated degree when this building was\nconstructed.  If you care to do so, you have my permission to shout,\nsay, for help, to your heart’s content.  We shall make no effort to\nstop you.”",
        "Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders.  He was staring down a\nbrilliantly lighted, richly carpeted corridor.  There were doors on\none side, windows on the other, the windows all hung with heavy,\nclosely drawn portieres.  The corridor was certainly not on the\nground floor, but whether it was on the second or third, or even\nabove that again, he had no means of knowing.  From appearances,\nthough, the place seemed more like a large, private mansion than\nanything else.",
        "“Just one word more before we proceed,” continued the other.  “I do\nnot wish you to labour under any illusion.  Here we are frankly\ncriminals.  This is our home.  It should have some effect in\nimpressing you with the power and resource at our command, and also\nwith the class of men with whom you are dealing.  There is not one\namong us whose education is not fully equal to your own; not one,\nindeed, but who is chosen, granting first his criminal tendencies,\nbecause he is a specialist in his own particular field–in commerce,\nin the government diplomatic service, in the professions of law and\nmedicine, in the ranks of pure science.  We are bordering on the\nfantastical, are we not?  Dreaming, you will probably say, of the\nUtopian in crime organisation.  Quite so, Mr. Dale.  I only ask you\nto consider the POSSIBILITIES if what I say is true.  Now let us\nproceed.  I am going to take you into three rooms–the three whose\ndoors you see ahead of you.  You will notice that, including the one\nyou have just left, there are four on this corridor.  I do not wish\nto strain your credulity, or play tricks upon you; so I am going to\nask you to fix an approximate idea of the length of the corridor in\nyour mind, as it will perhaps enable you to account more readily for\nwhat may appear to be a discrepancy in the corresponding size of the\nrooms.”",
        "One of the men opened the door ahead.  Jimmie Dale, at a sign from\nhis conductor, moved forward and entered.  Just what he had expected\nto find he could not have told; his brain was whirling, partly from\nhis aching head, partly from his desperate effort to conceive some\nway of escape from the peril which, for all his nonchalance, he knew\nonly too well was the gravest he had ever faced; but what he saw was\nsimply a cozily furnished bedroom.  There was nothing peculiar about\nit; nothing out of the way, except perhaps that it was rather\nnarrow.",
        "And then suddenly, rubbing his eyes involuntarily, he was staring in\na dazed way before him.  The whole right-hand side of the wall was\nsinking without a sound into the floor, increasing the width of the\nroom by some five or six feet–and in this space was disclosed what\nappeared to be a sort of chemical laboratory, elaborately equipped,\nextending the entire length of the room.",
        "“The wall is purely a matter of mechanical construction, operated\nhydraulically.”  The man was speaking softly at Jimmie Dale’s side.\n\"The room beneath is built to correspond; the base, ceiling, and\nwall mouldings here do not have to be very ingenious to effect a\ndisguise.  I might say, however, that few visitors, other than\nyourself, have ever seen anything here but a bedroom.”  He waved his\nhand toward the retorts, the racks of test tubes, the hundred and\none articles that strewed the laboratory bench.  “As for this, its\npurpose is twofold.  We, as well, as the police, have often need of\nanalysis.  We make it.  If we require a drug, a poison, say, we\ncompound it from its various ingredients, or, as the case may be,\ndistil it, perhaps–it is, you will agree, somewhat more difficult\nto trace to its source if procured that way.  And speaking of\npoisons\"–he stepped forward, and lifted a glass-stoppered bottle\ncontaining a colourless liquid from a shelf–\"in a modest way we\nhave even done some original research work here.  This, for\ninstance, is as Utopian from our standpoint as the formation, and\npersonnel of the organisation I have briefly outlined to you.  It\npossesses very essential qualities.  It is almost instantaneous in\nits action, requires a very small quantity, and defies detection\neven by autopsy.”  He uncorked the bottle, and dipped in a long\nglass rod.  “Will you watch the experiment?” he invited, with a sort\nof ghastly pleasantry.  “I do not want you to accept anything on\ntrust.”",
        "With a start, Jimmie Dale swung around.  He had heard no sound, but\nanother man was at his elbow now–and, struggling in the man’s hand,\nwas a little white rabbit.",
        "It was over in an instant.  A single drop in the rabbit’s mouth, and\nthe animal had stiffened out, a lifeless thing.",
        "“It is quite as effective on the human organism,” continued the\nother, “only, instead of one drop, three are required.  If I make it\nten\"–he was carefully measuring the liquid into two wineglasses–\n\"it is only that even you may be satisfied that the quantity is\nfatal.”  He filled up the glasses with what was apparently wine of\nsome description, which he poured from a decanter, and held out the\nglasses in front of him.",
        "And again Jimmie Dale started, again he had heard no one enter, and\nyet two men had stepped forward from behind him and had taken the\nglasses from their leader’s hands.  He glanced around him, counting\nquickly–they were surely the two who had entered with him from the\ncorridor.  No!  Including the leader, there were now six men, all in\nevening dress, all masked, in the room with him.",
        "A wave of the leader’s hand, and the two men holding the glasses\nleft the room.  The man turned to Jimmie Dale again.",
        "“Shall we proceed to the second room, Mr. Dale?” he asked politely.\n\"I think it is now prepared for us–I do not wish to bore you with a\nrepetition of magical sliding walls.”",
        "There was something now that numbed the ache in Jimmie Dale’s brain–\na sense of some deadly, remorseless thing that seemed to be\nconstantly creeping closer to him, clutching at him–to smother him,\nto choke him.  There was something absolutely fiendish, terrifying,\nin the veneer of culture around him.",
        "They had entered the second room.  This, like the other, was a\npseudo-bedroom; but here the movable wall was already down.  Ranged\nalong the right-hand side were a great number of cabinets that slid\nin and out, much after the style and fashion used by clothing\ndealers to stock and display their wares.  These cabinets were now\nall open, displaying hundreds of costumes of all kinds and\ndescriptions, and evidently complete to the minutest detail.  The\ncabinets were flanked by full-length mirrors at each end of the\nroom, and on little tables before the mirrors was an assortment,\nthat none better than Jimmie Dale himself could appreciate, of make-\nup accessories.",
        "The man smiled apologetically.",
        "“I am afraid this is rather uninteresting,” he said.  “I have shown\nit to you simply that you may understand that we are alive to the\nimportance of detail.  Disguise, that is daily vital to us, is an\nart that depends essentially on detail.  I venture to say we could\nimpersonate any character or type or nationality or class in the\nUnited States at a moment’s notice.  But\"–he took Jimmie Dale’s arm\nagain and conducted him out into the corridor, while the two men who\nwere evidently acting the role of guards followed closely behind–\n\"there is still the third room–here.”  He halted Jimmie Dale before\nthe door.  “I have asked you to answer two questions, Mr. Dale,” he\nsaid softly.  “I ask you now to remember the alternative.”",
        "They still stood before the door.  There was that uncanny silence\nagain–it seemed to Jimmie Dale to last interminably.  Neither of\nthe three men surrounding him moved nor spoke.  Then the door before\nhim was opened on an unlighted room, and he was led across the\nthreshold.  He heard the door close behind him.  The lights came on.\nAnd then it seemed as though he could not move, as though he were\nrooted to the spot–-and the colour ebbed from his face.  Three\nfigures were before him: the two men who had carried the glasses\nfrom the first room, and the chauffeur who had driven him in the\ntaxicab.  The two men still held the glasses–the chauffeur was\nbound hand and foot in a chair.  One of the glasses was EMPTY; the\nother was still significantly full.",
        "Jimmie Dale, with a violent effort at self-control, leaned forward.",
        "The man in the chair was dead.",
        "There was not a sound.  That stillness, weird, unnerving, that\npermeated, as it were, everywhere through that mysterious house,\nwas, if that were possible, accentuated now.  The four masked men in\nevening dress, five including their leader, for the man who had\nappeared in that other room with the rabbit was not here, were as\nsilent, as motionless, as the dead man who was lashed there in the\nchair.  And to Jimmie Dale it seemed at first as though his brain,\nstunned and stupefied at the shock, refused its functions, and left\nhim groping blindly, vaguely, with only a sort of dull, subconscious\nrealisation of menace and a deadly peril, imminent, hanging over\nhim.",
        "He tried to rouse himself mentally, to prod his brain to action, to\npit it in a fight for life against these self-confessed criminals\nand murderers with their mask of culture, who surrounded him now.\nWas there a way out?  What was it the Tocsin had said–\"the most\npowerful and pitiless organisation of criminals the world has ever\nknown–the stake a fortune of millions–her life!”  There had,\nindeed, been no overemphasis in the words she had used!  They had\ntaken pains themselves to make that ominously clear, these men!\nEvery detail of the strange house, with its luxurious furnishings,\nits cleverly contrived appointments, breathed a horribly suggestive\ndegree of power, a deadly purpose, and an organisation swayed by a\nmaster mind; and, grim evidence of the merciless, inexorable length\nto which they would go, was the ghastly white face of the dead\nchauffeur, bound hand and foot, in the chair before him!",
        "That EMPTY glass in the hand of one of the men!  He could not take\nhis eyes from it–except as his eyes were drawn magnetically to that\nFULL glass in the hand of one of the others.  What height of\nsardonic irony!  He was to drink that other glass, to die because he\nrefused to answer questions that for years, with every resource at\nhis command, risking his liberty, his wealth, his name, his life,\nwith everything that he cared for thrown into the scales, he had\nstruggled to solve–and failed!",
        "And then the leader spoke.",
        "“Mr. Dale,” he said, with cold significance, “I regret to admit that\nyour pseudo taxicab driver was so ill-advised as to refuse to answer\nthe SAME questions that I have put to you.”",
        "Five to one!  That was the only way out–and it was hopeless.  It\nwas the only way out, because, convinced that he could answer those\nquestions if he wanted to, these men were in deadly earnest; it was\nhopeless, because they were–five to one!  And probably there were\nas many more, twice or three times as many more within call.  But\nwhat did it matter how many more there were!  He could fight until\nhe was overpowered, that was all he could do, and the five could\naccomplish that.  Still, if he could knock the full glass out of\nthat man’s hand, and gain the door, then perhaps–he turned quickly,\nas the door opened.  It was as though they had read his thoughts.  A\nnumber of men were grouped outside in the corridor, then the door\nclosed again with a cordon ranged against it inside the room; and at\nthe same instant his arms and wrists were caught in a powerful grasp\nby the two men immediately behind him, who all along had enacted the\nrole of guards.",
        "Again the leader spoke.",
        "“I will repeat the questions,” he said sharply.  “Where is the woman\nwhose ring was found on that man there in the chair?  And where is\nthe package that you two men had with you in the taxicab to-night?”",
        "Jimmie Dale glanced from the tall, straight, immaculately clothed\nfigure of the speaker, from the threatening smile on the set lips\nthat just showed under the edge of the mask, to the dead man in the\nchair.  He had faced the prospect of death before many times, but it\nhad come with the heat of passion accompanying it, it had come\nquickly, abruptly, with every faculty called into action to combat\nit, without time to dwell upon it, to sift, weigh, or measure its\nmeaning, and if there had been fear it had been subordinate to other\nemotions.  But it was different now.  He could not, of course,\nanswer those questions; nor, he was doggedly conscious, would he\nhave answered them if he could–and there was no middle course.",
        "Death, within the next few moments, stared him in the face; and it\nseemed curiously irrelevant that, in a sort of unnatural calmness,\nhe should be attempting to analyse his feelings and emotions\nconcerning it.  All his life it had seemed to him that the acme of\nhuman mental torture was the cell of a condemned criminal, with the\nhorror of its hopelessness, with the time to dwell upon it; and that\nthe acme of that torture itself must be that awful moment\nimmediately preceding execution, when anticipation at last was to\nmerge into soul-sickening reality.",
        "Strange that thought should come!  Strange that he should be framing\na brain picture of such a scene, vivid, minute in detail!  No–not\nstrange.  He was picturing himself.  The analogy was not perfect, it\nwas true, he had not had the months, weeks, days and hours of\nsuspense; but it was perfect enough to bring home to him with\nappalling force the realisation of his position.  He was standing as\na condemned man might stand in those last, final moments, those\nmoments which he had imagined must be the most terrible that could\nexist in life; but that dismay of soul, the horror, the terror were\nnot his–there was, instead, a smouldering fury, a passionate\namazement that it was his own life that was threatened.  It seemed\nimpossible that it could be his voice that was speaking now in such\nquiet, measured tones.",
        "“Is it worth while, will it convince you now, any more than before,\nto repeat that there is some mistake here?  I am no more able to\nanswer your questions than you are yourselves.  I never saw that man\nin the chair there in my life until the moment that I hailed him in\nhis cab to-night.  I do not know who the woman is to whom that ring\nbelongs, much less do I know where she is.  And if there was a\npackage of any sort in the taxicab, as you state, I never saw it.”",
        "The lips under the mask curved into a lupine smile.",
        "“Think well, Mr. Dale!”  The man’s voice was low, menacing.\n\"Ethically, if you so choose to consider it, your refusal may be the\nact of a brave man; practically, it is the act of–a fool.  Now–\nyour answer!”",
        "“I have answered you,” said Jimmie Dale–and, relaxing the muscles\nin his arms, let them hang limply for an instant in the grip of the\ntwo men behind him.  “I have no other answer.”",
        "It was only a sign, a motion of the leader’s hand–but with it,\nquick as a lightning flash, Jimmie Dale was in action.  The limp\narms tautened into steel as he wrenched them loose, and, whirling\naround, he whipped his fist to the chin of one of the two guards.",
        "In an instant, with the blow, as the man staggered backward, the\nroom was in pandemonium.  There was a rush from the door, and two,\nthree, four leaping forms hurled themselves upon Jimmie Dale.  He\nshook them off–and they came again.  There was no chance\nultimately, he knew that; it was only the elemental within him that\nrose in fierce revolt at the thought of tame submission, that bade\nhim sell his life as dearly as he could.  Panting, gasping for\nbreath, dragging them by sheer strength as they clung to him, he got\nhis back to the wall, fighting with the savage fury and abandon of a\nwild cat.",
        "But it could not last.  Where one man went down before him, two\nremorselessly appeared–the room seemed filled with men–they poured\nin through the door–he laughed at them in a half-demented way–more\nand more of them came–there was no play for his arms, no room to\nfight–they seemed so close around him, so many of them upon him,\nthat he could not breathe–and he was bending, being crushed down as\nby an intolerable weight.  And then his feet were jerked from\nbeneath him, he crashed to the floor, and, in another moment, bound\nhand and foot, he was tied into a chair beside that other chair\nwhose grim occupant sat in such ghastly apathy of the scene.",
        "The room cleared instantly of all but the original five.  His head\nwas drawn suddenly, violently backward, and clamped in that\nposition; and a metal instrument, forced into his mouth, while his\nlips bled in their resistance, pried jaws apart and held them open.",
        "“One drop!” the leader ordered curtly.",
        "The man with the full glass bent over him, and dipped a glass rod\ninto the liquid.  The drop glistened a ruby red on the end of the\nrod–and fell with a sharp, acrid, burning sensation upon Jimmie\nDale’s tongue.",
        "For a moment Jimmie Dale’s animation, mental and physical, seemed\nswept away from him in, as it were, a hiatus of hideous suspense.\nWhat was it to be like this passing?  Why did it not act at once, as\nit had acted on the rabbit they had showed him in the other room?\nYes, he remembered!  It took more than one drop for a man; and\nbesides, this was diluted.  One drop had no effect on a man; it\nrequired–  Good God, ONE DROP EVEN OF THIS WAS ENOUGH?  He strained\nforward in the chair until the sweat in great beads sprang from his\nforehead, strained and fought and tore at his bonds in a paroxysm of\nmadness to free himself while there still remained a little\nstrength.  There was something filming before his eyes, a numbed\nfeeling was creeping through his limbs, robbing them, sapping them\nof their vitality and power.  He felt himself slipping away into a\nstate of utter weakness, and his brain began to grow confused.",
        "A voice seemed to float in the air near him:  “For the last time–\nwill you answer?”",
        "With a supreme effort, Jimmie Dale strove to rally his tottering\nsenses.  Did they not understand the stupendous mockery of their\nquestions?  Did they not understand that he did not know?  He had\ntold them so–perhaps he had better tell them so again.",
        "“I–”  He tried to speak, and found the words thick upon his tongue.\n\"I–do not–know.”",
        "The glass itself was thrust abruptly between his lips.  Some of the\ncontents spilled and trickled upon his chin, and then a flood of it,\nburning, fiery, poured down his throat.  A flood of it–and it\nneeded but THREE drops and there had been TEN in the glass!",
        "So this was death–a hazy, nebulous thing!  There was no pain.  It\nwas like–like–nothingness.  And out of the nothingness SHE came.\nStrange that she should come!  Alone she had fought these fiends and\noutwitted them for–how long was it?  Three years!  She would be\nmore than ever alone now.  Pray God she did not finally fall into\ntheir clutches!",
        "How it burned now, that fatal draught they had forced down his\nthroat, and how it gripped at him and seemed to eat and bore its way\ninto the very tissues!  It was the end, and–no!  It was STIMULATING\nhim!  Strength seemed to be returning to his limbs; it seemed as\nthough he were being carried, as though the bonds about him were\nbeing loosened; and now his brain seemed to be growing clearer.",
        "He roused up with a startled exclamation.  He was back in the same\nroom in which he had first returned to consciousness after the\naccident.  He was on the same couch.  The same masked figure was at\nthe same desk.  Had he been dreaming?  Was this then only some\nhorrible, ghastly nightmare through which he had passed?",
        "No, it had been real enough; his clothes, rent and torn, and the\nblood upon his hands, where the skin had been scraped from his\nknuckles in the fight, bore evidence to that.  He must then have\nlost consciousness for a while, though it seemed to him that at no\nmoment, hazy, irrational though his brain might have been, had he\nbecome entirely oblivious to what was taking place around him.  And\nyet it must have been so!",
        "The eyes from behind the mask were fixed steadily upon him, and\nbelow the mask there was the hard, unpleasant set to the lips that\nJimmie Dale had grown accustomed to expect.",
        "The man spoke abruptly.",
        "“That you find yourself alive, Mr. Dale,” he said grimly, “is no\nconfession of weakness upon the part of those with whom you have had\nto deal here.  To bear witness to that there is one who is not\nalive, as you have seen.  That man we knew.  With you it was\nsomewhat different.  Your presence in the taxicab was only\nsuspicious.  There was always the possibility that you might be one\nof those ubiquitous ’innocent bystanders.’  Your name, your\nposition, the improbability that you could have anything in common\nwith–shall we say, the matter that so deeply interests us?–was all\nin your favour.  However, presumption and probability are the tools\nof fools.  We do not depend upon them–we apply the test.  And\nhaving applied the test, we are convinced that you have told the\ntruth–that is all.”",
        "He rose from his chair brusquely.  “I shall not apologise to you for\nwhat has happened.  I doubt very much if you are in a frame of mind\nto accept anything of the sort.  I imagine, rather, that you are\npromising yourself that we shall pay, and pay dearly, for this–\nthat, among other things, we shall answer for the murder of that man\nin the other room.  All this will be quite within your province, Mr.\nDale–and quite fruitless.  To-morrow morning the story that you are\npreparing to tell now would sound incredible even in your own ears;\nfurthermore, as we shall take pains to see that you leave this place\nwith as little knowledge of its location as you obtained when you\narrived, your story, even if believed, would do little service to\nyou and less harm to us.  I think of nothing more, Mr. Dale, except–\"\nThere was a whimsical smile on the lips now.  “Ah, yes, the\nmatter of your clothes.  We can, and shall be glad to make\nreparation to you to the slight extent of offering you a new suit\nbefore you go.”",
        "Jimmie Dale scowled.  Sick, shaken, and weak as he was, the cool,\nimperturbable impudence of the man was fast growing unbearable.",
        "The man laughed.  “I am sure you will not refuse, Mr. Dale–since we\ninsist.  The condition of the clothes you have on at present might–\nI say ’might’–in a measure support your story with some degree of\ntangible evidence.  It is not at all likely, of course; but we\nprefer to discount even so remote a possibility.  When you have\nchanged, you will be motored back to your home.  I bid you good-\nnight, Mr. Dale.”",
        "Jimmie Dale rubbed his eyes.  The man was gone–through a door at\nthe rear of the desk, a door that he had not noticed before, that\nwas not even in evidence now, that was simply a movable section of\nthe wall panelling–and for an instant Jimmie Dale experienced a\nsense of sickening impotence.  It was as though he stood\ndefenceless, unarmed, and utterly at the mercy of some venomous\npower that could crush what it would remorselessly and at will in\nits might.",
        "The place was a veritable maze, a lair of hellish cleverness.  He\nhad no illusions now, he laboured under no false estimate of either\nthe ingenuity or the resources of this inhuman nest of vultures to\nwhom murder was no more than a matter of detail.  And it was against\nthese men that henceforth he was to match his wits!  There could be\nno truce, no armistice.  It was their lives, or hers, or his!  Well,\nhe was alive now, the first round was over, and so far he had won.\nHis brows furrowed suddenly.  Had he?  He was not so sure, after\nall.  He was conscious of a disquieting, premonitory intuition that,\nin some way which he could not explain, the honours were not\nentirely his.",
        "He was apparently–the “apparently” was a mental reservation–quite\nalone in the room.  He got up from the couch and walked shakily\nacross the floor to the desk.  A revolver lay invitingly upon the\nblotting pad.  It was his own, the one they had taken from him after\nthe accident.  Jimmie Dale picked it up, examined it–and smiled a\nlittle sarcastically at himself for his trouble.  It was unloaded,\nof course.  He was twirling it in his hand, as a man, masked as\nevery one in the house was masked, and carrying a neatly folded suit\nover his arm, entered from the corridor.",
        "“The car is ready as soon as you are dressed,” announced the other\nbriefly.  He laid the clothes upon the couch–and settled himself\nsignificantly in a chair.",
        "Jimmie Dale hesitated.  Then, with a shrug of his shoulders,\nrecrossed the room, and began to remove his torn garments.  What was\nthe use!  They would certainly have their own way in the end.  It\nwasn’t worth another fight, and there was nothing to be gained by a\nrefusal except to offer a sop to his own exasperation.",
        "He dressed quickly, in what proved to be an exceedingly well-fitting\nsuit; and finally turned tentatively to the man in the chair.",
        "The other stood up, and produced a heavy black silk scarf.",
        "“If you have no objections,” he said curtly, “I’ll tie this over\nyour eyes.”",
        "Again Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders.",
        "“I am glad enough to get out on any conditions,” he answered\ncaustically.",
        "“’Fortunate’ would be the better word,” rejoined the other\nmeaningly–and, deftly knotting the scarf, led Jimmie Dale\nblindfolded from the room.",
        "Was he in the city?  In a suburban town?  On a country road?  It\nseemed childishly absurd that he could not at least differentiate to\nthat extent; and yet, from the moment he had been placed in the\nautomobile in which he now found himself, he was forced to admit\nthat he could not tell.  He had started out with the belief that,\nknowing New York and its surroundings as minutely as he knew them,\nit would be impossible, do what they would to prevent it, that at\nthe end of the journey he should be without a clew, and a very good\nclew at that, to the location of what he now called, appropriately\nenough it seemed, the Crime Club.",
        "But he had never ridden blindfolded in a car before!  He could see\nabsolutely nothing.  And if that increased or accentuated his sense\nof hearing, it helped little–the roar of the racing car beat upon\nhis eardrums the more heavily, that was all.  He could tell, of\ncourse, the nature of the roadbed.  They were running on an asphalt\nroad, that was obvious enough; but city streets and suburban streets\nand hundreds of miles of country road around New York were of\nasphalt!",
        "Traffic?  He was quite sure, for he had strained his ears in an\neffort to detect it, that there was little or no traffic; but then,\nit must be one or two o’clock in the morning, and at that hour the\ncity streets, certainly those that would be chosen by these men,\nwould be quite as deserted as any country road!  And as for a sense\nof direction, he had none whatever–even if the car had not been\npersistently swerving and changing its course every little while.\nIf he had been able to form even an approximate idea of the compass\ndirection in which they had started, he might possibly have been\nable in a general way to counteract this further effort of theirs to\nconfuse him; but without the initial direction he was essentially\nbefogged.",
        "With these conclusions finally thrust home upon him, Jimmie Dale\nphilosophically subordinated the matter in his mind, and, leaning\nback, composed himself as comfortably as he could upon his seat.\nThere was a man beside him, and he could feel the legs of two men on\nthe seat facing him.  These, with the driver, would make four.  He\nwas still well guarded!  The car itself was a closed car–not\nhooded, the sense of touch told him–therefore a limousine of some\ndescription.  These facts, in a sense inconsequential, were absorbed\nsubconsciously; and then Jimmie Dale’s brain, remorselessly active,\nin spite of the pain from his throbbing head, was at work again.",
        "It seemed as though a year had passed since, in the early evening,\nas Larry the Bat, he had burrowed so ironically for refuge in Chang\nFoo’s den–from her!  It seemed like some mocking unreality, some\nvisionary dream that, so short a while before, he had read those\nwords of hers that had sent the blood coursing and leaping through\nhis veins in mad exultation at the thought that the culmination of\nthe years had come, that all he longed for, hoped for, that all his\nsoul cried out for was to be his–\"in an hour.”  An HOUR–and he was\nto have seen her, the woman whose face he had never seen, the woman\nwhom he loved!  And the hour instead, the hours since then, had\nbrought a nightmare of events so incredible as to seem but phantoms\nof the imagination.",
        "Phantoms!  He sat up suddenly with a jerk.  The face of the dead\nchauffeur, the limp form lashed in that chair, the horrible picture\nin its entirety, every detail standing out in ghastly relief, took\nform before him.  God knew there was no phantom there!",
        "The man beside him, at the sudden start, lifted a hand and felt\nhurriedly over the bandage across Jimmie Dale’s eyes.",
        "Jimmie Dale was scarcely conscious of the act.  With that face\nbefore him, with the scene re-enacting itself in his mind again, had\ncome another thought, staggering him for a moment with the new\nmenace that it brought.  He had had neither time nor opportunity to\nthink before; it had been all horror, all shock when he had entered\nthat room.  But now, like an inspiration, he saw it all from another\nangle.  There was a glaring fallacy in the game these men had played\nfor his benefit to-night–a fallacy which they had counted on\nglossing over, as it had, indeed, been glossed over, by the sudden\nshock with which they had forced that scene upon him; or, failing in\nthat, they had counted on the fact that his, or any other man’s\nnerve would have failed when it came to open defiance based on a\nsupposition which might, after all, be wrong, and, being wrong,\nmeant death.",
        "But it was not supposition.  Either he was right now, or these men\nwere childish, immature fools–and, whatever else they might be,\nthey were not that!  NOT A SINGLE DROP OF POISON HAD PASSED THE\nCHAUFFEUR’S LIPS.  The man had not been murdered in that room.  He\nhad not, in a sense, been murdered at all.  The man, absolutely,\nunquestionably, without a loophole for doubt, had either been killed\noutright in the automobile accident, or had died immediately\nafterward, probably without regaining consciousness, certainly\nwithout supplying any of the information that was so determinedly\nsought.",
        "Yes, he saw it now!  Their backs were against the wall, they were at\ntheir wits’ end, these men!  The knowledge that the chauffeur\npossessed, that they KNEW he possessed, was evidently life and death\nto them.  To kill the man before they had wormed out of him what\nthey wanted to know, or, at least, until, by holding him a prisoner,\nthey had exhausted every means at their command to make him speak,\nwas the last thing they would do!",
        "Jimmie Dale sat for a long time quite motionless.  The car was\nspeeding at a terrific rate along a straight stretch of road.  He\ncould almost have sworn, guided by some intuitive sense, that they\nwere in the country.  Well, even if it were so, what did that prove!\nThey might have started FROM New York itself–only to return to it\nwhen they had satisfied themselves that he was sufficiently duped.\nOr they might have started legitimately from outside New York, and\nbe going toward the city now.  Since the ultimate destination was\nNew York, and they had made no attempt to hide that from him, it was\nuseless to speculate–for at best it could be only speculation.  He\nhad decided that once before!  The man at his side felt again over\nthe scarf to see that it was in place.",
        "Curiously now Jimmie Dale recalled the inward monitor that had\nwarned him the honours had not all been his in this first round with\nthe Crime Club to-night.  If they had deliberately murdered the\nchauffeur because of a refusal to answer, they would equally have\ndone the same to him.  Fool that he had been not to have seen that\nbefore!  And yet would it have made any difference?  He shook his\nhead.  He could not have acted to any better advantage than he had\ndone.  He could not–his lips curled in grim derision–have been any\nmore convincing.",
        "Convincing!  It was all clear enough now!  If the chauffeur had\nsuffered death rather than talk, even admitting the fact that they\nhad more grounds for suspecting the chauffeur’s complicity, would\nhis, Jimmie Dale’s, mere denial, his choice, too, of death, have\nbeen any the more convincing, or have saved his life where it had\nnot saved the other’s?  A certain added respect for these men,\nagainst whom, until the end now, his victory or theirs, he realised\nhe was fighting for his life, came over him as he recognised the\ntouch of a master hand.  They did not know where to find the Tocsin;\nthe package that she had said was vital to them was still beyond\ntheir reach; the chauffeur was dead; and he, Jimmie Dale, alone\nremained–a clew that they had still to prove valid or invalid it\nwas true, but the only clew in their possession.  And, gaining\nnothing from him by a show of force, to throw him off his guard,\nthey had let him go–meaning him to believe they were convinced he\nknew nothing, and that the episode, the adventure of the night, was,\nas far as they were concerned, ended, finished, and done with!",
        "Time passed, a very long time, as he sat there.  It might have been\nan hour–he could only hazard a guess.  Not one of the men in the\ncar had spoken a word.  But to Jimmie Dale, the car itself, the\nride, its duration, these three strange companions, were for the\ntime being extraneous.  Even that sick giddiness in his head had, at\nleast temporarily, gone from him.",
        "And so, all unsuspectingly, he was to lead them to the Tocsin and\nfall into the trap himself!  His hands, thrust deep in his pockets,\nwere tightly clenched.  They were clever enough, ingenious enough,\npowerful enough to watch him henceforth at every turn–and from now\non, day and night, they were to be reckoned with.  Suppose that in\nsome way, as it might well have happened, for it was now vitally\nnecessary that she should communicate with him and he with her, he\nhad played blindly into their hands, and through him she should have\nfallen into their power!  It brought a sickening chill, a sort of\nhideous panic to Jimmie Dale–and then fury, anger, in a torrent,\nsurged upon him, and there came a merciless desire to crush, to\nstrangle, to stamp out this inhuman band of criminals that, with\nintolerable effrontery to the laws of God and man, were so\nelaborately and scientifically equipped for their monstrous\npurposes!",
        "And then Jimmie Dale, in the darkness, smiled again grimly as the\nleader’s reference to the Gray Seal recurred to him.  Well, perhaps,\nwho knew, they would have reason more than they dreamed of to wish\nthe Gray Seal enrolled in their own ranks!  It was strange, curious!\nHe had thought all that was ended.  Only a few short hours before he\nhad hidden away all, everything that was incident to the life of the\nGray Seal, the clothes of Larry the Bat, that little metal case with\nthe gray-coloured, adhesive seals, a dozen other things, believing\nthat it only remained for him to return and destroy them at his\nleisure as a finishing touch to the Gray Seal’s career–and now,\ninstead, he was face to face with the gravest and most dangerous\nproblem that she had ever called upon him to undertake!",
        "Well, at least, the odds were not all in the Crime Club’s favour.\nWhere they now certainly believed him to be entirely off his guard,\nhe was thoroughly on his guard; and where they might suspect him,\nwatch him, they would suspect and watch only the character, the\nperson of Jimmie Dale, and count not at all upon either Larry the\nBat or–the Gray Seal.",
        "A sort of savage elation fell upon Jimmie Dale.  His brain, that had\nbeen stagnant, confused, physically sick with pain and suffering,\nwas working now with its old-time vigour and ease, mapping,\nplanning, scheming the way ahead.  To strike, and strike quickly–to\nstrike FIRST!  It must be his move next–not theirs!  And he must\nact to-night at once, the moment he was given this pretence to\nliberty that they had in store for him, before they had an\nopportunity of closing down around him with a network of spies that\nhe could not elude.  By morning, Jimmie Dale would be Larry the Bat,\nand inhabiting the Sanctuary again.  And a tip to Jason, his old\nbutler, to the effect, say, that he had gone away for a trip, would\naccount for his disappearance satisfactorily enough; it would not\nnecessarily arouse their suspicions when they eventually discovered\nhe was gone, for against that was always the possible, and quite\nlikely presumption that, where they had succeeded in nothing else,\nthey had at least succeeded in frightening him thoroughly and to the\nextent of imbuing him with a hasty desire to put a safe distance\nbetween himself and them.",
        "And now, with his mind made up to his course of action, an intense\nimpatience to put his plan into effect, an irritation at the useless\ntwistings and turnings of the car that had latterly become more\nfrequent, took hold upon him.  How much longer was this to last!\nThey must have been fully an hour and a half on the road already,\nand–ah, the car was stopping now!",
        "He straightened up in his seat as the machine came to a halt–but\nthe man at his side laid a restraining hand upon him.  The car door\nopened, and one of the men got out.  Jimmie Dale caught an\nindistinct murmur of voices from without, then the man returned to\nhis seat, and the car went on again.",
        "Another half hour passed, that, curbing his irritation and\nimpatience, was filled with the conjectures and questions that anew\ncame crowding in upon his mind.  Why had the car made that stop?  It\nwas rather curious.  It was certainly a prearranged meeting place.\nWhy?  And these clothes that he now wore–why had they made him\nchange?  His own had not been very badly torn.  The reason given him\nwas, on the face of it now, in view of what he now knew, mere\npretence.  What was the ulterior motive behind that pretence?  What\ndid this package, that had already cost a man his life to-night,\ncontain?  Who was the chauffeur?  What was this death feud between\nthe Tocsin and these men?  Did she know where the Crime Club was?\nWho and where was John Johansson?  What was this box that was\nnumbered 428?  Could she supply the links that would forge the chain\ninto an unbroken whole?",
        "And then for the second time the car slowed down–and this time the\nman on the seat beside Jimmie Dale reached up and untied the scarf.",
        "“You get out here,” said the man tersely.",
        "Had it not been for the stop the car had previously made, for the\npossibility that he might have obtained a glimpse outside when the\ndoor had been opened, the scarf over his eyes would have been\nsuperfluous; for now, with it removed, he could scarcely distinguish\nthe forms of the three men around him, since the window curtains of\nthe car were tightly drawn.  Nor was he given the opportunity to do\nmore, even had it been possible.  The car stopped, the door was\nopened, he was pushed toward it–and even as he reached the ground,\nthe door was closed behind him, and the car was speeding on again.\nBut where he could not see before, it took now but a glance to\nobtain his bearings–he was standing on a corner on Riverside Drive,\nwithin a few doors of his own house.",
        "Jimmie Dale stood still for a moment, watching the car as it\ndisappeared rapidly up the Drive.  And with a sort of grim\nfacetiousness his brain began to correlate time and distance.  Where\nhad he come from?  Where was this Crime Club?  They had been, as\nnearly as he could estimate, two hours in making the journey; and,\nas nearly as he could estimate, in their turnings and twistings had\ncovered at least twice the distance that would be represented by a\ndirect route.  Granting, then, an average speed of forty miles an\nhour, which was overgenerous to be on the safe side, and the fact\nthat they certainly had not crossed the Hudson, which now lay before\nhim, flanking the Drive, the Crime Club was somewhere within the\narea of a semicircle, whose centre was the corner on which he now\nstood, and whose radius was forty miles–OR FORTY YARDS!  He forced\na laugh.  It was just that, no more, no less–he was as likely to\nhave started on his ride from within a biscuit throw of where he now\nstood, as to have started on it from miles away!",
        "But–he aroused himself with a start–he was wasting time!  It must\nbe very late, near morning, and he would have need for every moment\nthat was left between now and daylight.  He turned, walked quickly\nto his house, mounted the steps, and with his latch-key–they had at\nleast permitted him to retain the contents of his pockets when they\nhad forced him to change his clothes–opened the front door softly,\nand, stepping inside, closed the door as silently as he had opened it.",
        "He paused for an instant to listen.  There was not a sound.  The\nservants, naturally, would have been in bed hours ago.  Even old\nJason–Jimmie Dale smiled, half whimsically, half affectionately–\nwhose paternal custom it was to sit up for his Master Jim, who, as\nhe was fond of saying, he had dandled as a baby on his knee, had\nevidently given it up as a bad job on this occasion and had turned\nin himself.  Jason, however, had left the light burning here in the\nbig reception hall.",
        "Jimmie Dale stepped to the switch and turned off the light; then\nstood hesitant in the darkness.  Was there anything to be gained by\nrousing Jason now and telling him what he intended to do–to\ninstruct him to answer any inquiries by the statement that “Mr. Dale\nhad gone away for a trip”?  He could trust Jason; Jason already knew\nmuch–more than one of those mysterious letters of the Tocsin’s had\npassed through Jason’s hands.",
        "Jimmie Dale shook his head.  No; he could communicate with Jason\nfrom downtown in the morning.  He had half expected to find Jason\nup, and, in that case, would have taken the other, as far as\nnecessary, into his confidence; but it was not a matter that pressed\nfor the moment.  He could get into touch with Jason at any time\nreadily enough.  Was there anything else before he went?  He would\nnot be able to get back as easily as he got out!  Money!  He shook\nhis head again–a little grimly this time.  He had been caught once\nbefore as Larry the Bat without funds!  There was plenty of money\nnow hidden in the Sanctuary, enough for any emergency, enough to\nlast him indefinitely.",
        "He stepped forward along the hall, his tread noiseless on the rich,\nheavy rug, passed into the rear of the house, descended the back\nstairs, and reached the cellar.  It was below the level of the\nground, of course; but a narrow window here, though quite large\nenough to permit of egress, gave on the driveway at the side of the\nhouse that led to the garage in the rear.",
        "Cautiously now, for the cement flooring was, in the stillness,\nlittle less than a sounding board, Jimmie Dale reached the wall and\nfelt along it to the window, the lower edge of whose sill was just\nslightly below the level of his shoulder.  It opened inward, if he\nremembered correctly.  His fingers were feeling for the fastenings.\nIt was too dark to see a thing.  He muttered in annoyance.  Where\nwere the fastenings!  At the sides, or at the bottom?  His hand\nbegan to make a circuit of the sill–and then suddenly, with a low,\nsharp cry, he leaned forward!",
        "WHAT DID THIS MEAN?  Wires!  No wires had ever been there before!\nHis fingers were working now with feverish haste, telegraphing their\nmessage to his brain.  The wires ran through the sill close to the\ncorner of the wall–tiny fragments of wood, as from an auger, were\nstill on the sill–and here was a small particle of wire insulation\nthat, those sensitive finger tips proclaimed, was FRESH.",
        "A cold thrill ran through Jimmie Dale; and there came again that\nsickening sense of impotency in the face of the malignant, devilish\ncunning arrayed against him, that once before he had experienced,\nthat night.  He had thought to forestall them–and he had been\nforestalled himself!  This could only have been done–they had had\nno interest in him before then–while they held him at the Crime\nClub, while he was spending that two hours in the car!  Was that why\nthey had taken so long in coming?  Was that why the car had stopped\nthat time–that those with him might be told that the work here had\nbeen completed, and he need no longer be kept away?",
        "He edged away from the window, and, as cautiously as he had come,\nretraced his steps across the cellar and up the stairs–and then,\nthe possibility of being heard from without gone, he broke into a\nrun.  There was no need to wonder long what those wires meant.  They\ncould mean only one of two things–and the Crime Club would have\nlittle concern in his electric light!  THEY HAD TAPPED HIS\nTELEPHONE.  The mains, he knew, ran into the cellar from the\nunderground service in the street.  He was racing like a madman now.\nHow long ago, how many hours ago, had they done that!  Great Scott,\nSHE was to have telephoned!  Had she done so?  Was the game, all,\neverything, she herself, at their mercy already?  If she had\ntelephoned, Jason would have left a message on his desk–he would\nlook there first–afterward he would waken Jason.",
        "He gained the door of his den on the first landing, a room that ran\nthe entire length of one side of the house from front to rear, burst\nin, switched on the light–-and stood stock-still in amazement.",
        "“Jason!” he cried out.",
        "The old butler, fully dressed, rubbing and blinking his eyes at the\nlight, and with a startled cry, rose up from the depths of a\nlounging chair.",
        "“Jason!” exclaimed Jimmie Dale again.",
        "“I beg pardon, sir, Master Jim,” stammered the man.  “I–I must have\nfallen asleep, sir.”",
        "“Jason, what are you doing here?” Jimmie Dale demanded sharply.",
        "“Well, sir,” said Jason, still fumbling for his words, “it–it was\nthe telephone, sir.”",
        "“The–TELEPHONE!”",
        "“Yes, sir.  A woman, begging your pardon, Master Jim, a lady, sir,\nhas been telephoning every hour or so, and she–”",
        "“YES!”  Jimmie Dale had jumped across the room and had caught the\nother fiercely by the shoulder.  “Yes–yes!  What did she say?\nQUICK, man!”",
        "“Good Lord, Master Jim!” faltered Jason.  “I–she–”",
        "“Jason,” said Jimmie Dale, suddenly as cold as ice, “what did she\nsay?  Think, man!  Every word!”",
        "“She didn’t say anything, Master Jim.  Nothing at all, sir–except\nto keep asking each time if she could speak to you.”",
        "“Nothing else, Jason?”",
        "“No, sir.”",
        "“You are SURE?”",
        "“I’m sure, Master Jim.  Not another thing but that, sir, just as\nI’ve told you.”",
        "“Thank God!” said Jimmie Dale, in a low voice.",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Jason mechanically.",
        "“How long ago was it since she telephoned last?” asked Jimmie Dale\nquickly.",
        "“Well, sir, I couldn’t rightly say.  You see, as I said, Master Jim,\nI must have gone to sleep, but–”",
        "They were staring tensely into each other’s face.  The telephone on\nthe desk was ringing vibrantly, clamourously, through the stillness\nof the room.",
        "Jason, white, frightened, bewildered, touched his lips with the tip\nof his tongue.",
        "“That’ll be her again, sir,” he said hoarsely.",
        "“Wait!” said Jimmie Dale tersely.",
        "He was trying to think, to think faster than he had ever thought\nbefore.  He could not tell Jason to say that he had not yet come in–\nTHEY knew he was in, it would be but showing his hand to that “some\none” who would be listening now on the wire.  He dared not speak to\nher, or, above all, allow her to expose herself by a single\ninadvertent word.  He dared not speak to her–and she was here now,\ncalling him!  He could not speak to her–and it was life and death\nalmost that she should know what had happened; life and death almost\nfor both of them that he should know all and everything she could\ntell him.  True, it would take but a minute to run to the cellar and\ncut those wires, while Jason held her on the pretence of calling\nhim, Jimmie Dale, to the ’phone; only a minute to cut those wires–\nand in so doing advertise to these fiends the fact that he had\ndiscovered their trick; admit, as though in so many words, that\ntheir suspicions of him were justified; lay himself open to some new\nmove that he could not hope to foresee; and, paramount to all else,\nrob her and himself of this master trump the Crime Club had placed\nin his hands, by means of which there was a chance that he could\nhoist them with their own petard!",
        "The telephone rang again–imperatively, persistently.",
        "“Listen, Jason.”  Jimmie Dale was speaking rapidly, earnestly.  “Say\nthat I’ve come in and have gone to bed–in a vile humour.  That you\ntold me a lady had been calling, but that I said if she called again\nI wasn’t to be disturbed if it was the Queen of Sheba herself–that\nI wouldn’t answer any ’phone to-night for anybody.  Do you\nunderstand?  No argument with her–just that.  Now, answer!”",
        "Jason lifted the receiver from the hook.",
        "“Yes–hello!” he said.  “Yes, ma’am, Mr. Dale has come in, but he\nhas retired. . . .  Yes, I told him; but, begging your pardon,\nma’am, he was in what I might say was a bit of a temper, and said he\nwasn’t to be disturbed by any one.”",
        "Jimmie Dale snatched the receiver from Jason, and put it to his own\near.",
        "“Kindly tell Mr. Dale that unless he comes to the ’phone now,” a\nfeminine voice, her voice, in well-simulated indignation, was\nsaying, “it will be a very long day before I shall trouble myself\nto–”",
        "Jimmie Dale clapped his hand firmly over the mouthpiece of the\ninstrument.  Thank God for that clever brain of hers!  She\nunderstood!",
        "“Repeat what you said before, Jason,” he instructed hurriedly.\n\"Then say ’Good-night.’”",
        "He removed his hand from the mouthpiece.",
        "“It’s quite useless, ma’am,” said Jason apologetically.  “In the\nrare temper he was in, he wouldn’t come, to use his own words,\nma’am, not for the Queen of Sheba herself, ma’am.  Good-night,\nma’am.”",
        "Jimmie Dale hung the receiver back on the hook–and with his hand\nflirted away a bead of moisture that had sprung to his forehead.",
        "“Good Lord, Master Jim, what’s wrong, sir?  What’s happened, sir?\nAnd–and those clothes, Master Jim, sir!  They aren’t the ones you\nwent out in, sir–they aren’t yours at all, sir!”  Jason ventured\nanxiously.",
        "“Jason,” said Jimmie Dale, “switch off the light, and go to the\nfront window and look out.  Keep well behind the curtains.  Don’t\nshow yourself.  Tell me if you see anything.”",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Jason obediently.",
        "The light went out.  Jimmie Dale moved to the rear of the room–to\nthe window overlooking the garage and yard.",
        "“I don’t see anything, sir,” Jason called.",
        "“Watch!” Jimmie Dale answered.",
        "A minute passed–two–three.  Jimmie Dale was staring down into the\nblack of the yard.  She understood!  She knew, of course, before she\n’phoned that something had gone wrong to-night.  She knew that only\nperil of the gravest moment would have kept him from the ’phone–and\nher.  She knew now, as a logical conclusion, that it was dangerous\nto attempt to communicate with him at his home.  Those wires!  Where\ndid they lead to?  Not far away–that would be almost a mechanical\nimpossibility.  Was it into the Crime Club itself–near at hand?  Or\nthe basement, say, of that apartment house across the driveway?\nOr–where?",
        "And then Jimmie Dale spoke again:",
        "“Do you see anything, Jason?”",
        "“I’m not sure, sir,” Jason answered hesitantly.  “I thought I saw a\nman move behind a tree out there across the road a minute ago, sir.\nYes, sir–there he is again!”",
        "There was a thin, mirthless smile on Jimmie Dale’s lips.",
        "Below, in the shadow of the garage, a dark form, like a deeper\nshadow, stirred–and was still again.",
        "“What time is it, Jason?” Jimmie Dale asked presently.",
        "“It’ll be about half-past four, sir.”",
        "“Go to bed, Jason.”",
        "“Yes, sir; but\"–Jason’s voice, low, troubled, came through the\ndarkness from the upper end of the room–\"Master Jim, sir, I–”",
        "“Go to bed, Jason–and not a word of this.”",
        "“Yes, sir.  Good-night, Master Jim.”",
        "“Good-night, Jason.”",
        "Jimmie Dale groped his way to the big lounging chair in which he had\nfound Jason asleep, and flung himself into it.  They had struck\nquickly, these ingenious, dress-suited murderers of the Crime Club!\nThe house was already watched, would be watched now untiringly,\nunceasingly; not a movement of his henceforth but would be under\ntheir eyes!",
        "His hands, resting on the arms of the chair, closed slowly until\nthey became tight-clenched, knotted fists.  What was he to do?  It\nwas not only the Crime Club, it was not only the Tocsin and her\nperil–there was the underworld snapping and snarling at his heels,\nthere was the police, dogged and sullen, ever on the trail of the\nGray Seal!  His life, even before this, in his fight against the\nunderworld and the police, had depended upon his freedom of action–\nand now, at one and the same time, that freedom was cut away from\nbeneath his feet, as it were, and a third foe, equally as deadly as\nthe others, was added to the list!",
        "For months, to preserve and sustain the character of Larry the Bat,\nhe had been forced to assume the role almost daily; for, in that\nsordid empire below the dead line, whose one common bond and aim was\nthe Gray Seal’s death, where suspicion, one of the other, was\nrampant and extravagant, where each might be the one against whom\nall swore their vengeance, Larry the Bat could not mysteriously\ndisappear from his accustomed haunts without inviting suspicion in\nan active and practical form–an inquisitorial visit to his squalid\nlodgings, the Sanctuary–and the end of Larry the Bat!",
        "If, as he had thought only a few hours before, he was through\nforever with his dual life, that would not have mattered, the\nunderworld would have been welcome to make what it chose of it–but\nnow the preservation of the character of Larry the Bat was more\nvital and necessary to him than it had ever been before.  It was a\nmeans of defense and offense against these men who lurked now\noutside his doors.  It was the sole means now of communication with\nher; for, warned both by Jason’s words, and what must be an obvious\nfact to her, that their plans had miscarried, that it was dangerous\nto communicate with him as Jimmie Dale, she would expect him, count\non him to make that move.  There would be no longer either reason or\nattempt on her part to maintain the mystery with which she had\nheretofore surrounded herself, the crisis had come, she would be\nwatching, waiting, hoping, seeking for him more anxiously and with\nfar more at stake than he had ever sought for her–until now!",
        "He got up impulsively from his chair, and, in the blackness, began\nto pace the room.  The next move was clear, pitifully clear; it had\nbeen clear from the first, it had been clear even in that ride in\nthe car–it was so clear that it seemed veritably to mock him as he\nprodded his brains for some means of putting it into execution.  He\nmust get to the Sanctuary, become Larry the Bat–but how?  HOW!  The\nquestion seemed at last to become resonant, to ring through the room\nwith the weight of doom upon it.",
        "Schemes, plans, ideas came, bringing a momentary uplift–only to be\ndiscarded the next instant with a sort of bitter, desperate regret.\nThese men were not men of mere ordinary intelligence; their\ncleverness, their power, the amazing scope of their organisation,\nall bore grim witness to the fact that they would be blinded not at\nall by any paltry ruse.",
        "He could walk out of the house in the morning as Jimmie Dale without\napparent hindrance–that was obvious enough.  And so long as he\npursued the usual avocations of Jimmie Dale, he would not be\ninterfered with–only WATCHED.  It was useless to consider that plan\nfor a moment.  It would not help him to reach the Sanctuary–without\nleading them there behind him!  True, there was always the chance\nthat he might shake them off his trail, but he could hardly hope to\naccomplish anything like that without their knowing that it was done\nDELIBERATELY–and that he dared not risk.  The strongest weapon in\nhis hands now was his secret knowledge that he was being watched.",
        "That telephone there, for instance, that most curiously kept on\ninsisting in his mind that it, and it alone was the way out, was the\nlast thing he could place in jeopardy.  Besides, there was another\nreason why such a plan would not do; for, granting even that he\nsucceeded in eluding them on the way, and managed to reach the\nSanctuary, his freedom of action would be so restricted and limited\nas to be practically worthless–he would have to return to his home\nhere again within a reasonable time as Jimmie Dale, within a few\nhours at most–or again they would be in possession of the fact that\nhe had discovered their surveillance.",
        "That, it was true, had been his original plan when he had entered\nthe house half an hour previously, but it was an entirely different\nmatter now.  Then, he had counted on GETTING AWAY without their\nknowing it, before they, as he had fondly thought, would have had a\nchance to establish their espionage, and when they would have had no\nreason to suspect, for a time at least, that he was not still within\nthe house, when they would have been watching, as it were, an empty\ncage.",
        "He stopped in his walk, and, after a moment, dropped down into the\nlounging chair again.  That was it, of course.  An empty cage!  If\nhe could escape from the house!  Not so much without their seeing\nhim; that was more or less a mechanical detail.  But escape–and\nleave them in possession of a sort of guarantee or assurance that he\nwas still there!  That would give him the freedom of action that he\nmust have.  He smiled with bitter irony.  That solved the problem!\nThat was all there was to it–just that!  It was very simple,\nexceedingly simple; it was only–impossible!",
        "The smile left his lips, and once more his hands, clenched fiercely.\nNo; it was not impossible!  It MUST be done–if he was to win\nthrough, if he was even to save himself!  It must be done–or FAIL\nher!  It COULD be done; there was a way–if he could only see it!",
        "As the minutes passed, many of them, Jimmie Dale sat there\nmotionless, staring before him at the desk that was faintly outlined\nin the unlighted room.  Then somewhere in the house a clock struck\nthe hour.  Five o’clock!  He raised his head.  YES!  It could be\ndone!  There was a way!  He had the germ of it now.  And now the\nplan began to grow, to take form and shape in his mind, to dovetail,\nto knit the integral parts into a comprehensive whole.  There was a\nway–but he must have assistance.  Jason–yes, assuredly.  Benson,\nhis chauffeur–yes, equally as trustworthy as Jason.  Benson was\ndevoted to him; and moreover Benson was young, alert, daring, cool.\nHe had had more than one occasion to test Benson’s resourcefulness\nand nerve!",
        "Jimmie Dale rose abruptly, went to the rear window, and, parting the\ncurtains cautiously, stood peering down into the courtyard.  Yes, it\nwas feasible; even a little more than feasible.  The garage fronted\nthe driveway, of course, to give free entrance and egress to the\ncars, but where the wall of the garage and the rear wall of the\nhouse overlapped, as it were, the space between them was not much\nmore than ten yards; and here the shadows of the two walls,\nmingling, lay like a black, impenetrable pathway–not like that\nother shadow he had seen moving at the side of the garage, and that,\nif not for the moment discernible, was none the less surely still\nlurking there!",
        "Satisfied, Jimmie Dale swung briskly from the window, and, going now\nto his bedroom across the hall, undressed and went to bed–but not\nto sleep.  There would be time enough to sleep, all day, if he\nwished; now, there were still the little details to be thought out\nthat, more than anything else, could make or wreck his plans.  A\npoint overdone, the faintest suggestion of a false note where men of\nthe calibre of those against whom he was now fighting for his life\nwere concerned, would not only make his scheme abortive, but would\nplace him utterly at their mercy.",
        "It was nine o’clock when he rang for Jason.",
        "“Jason,” he said abruptly, as the other entered, “I want you to\ntelephone for Doctor Merlin.”",
        "“The doctor, sir!” exclaimed the old man anxiously.  “You’re–you’re\nnot ill, Master Jim, sir?”",
        "“Do I look ill, Jason?” inquired Jimmie Dale gravely.",
        "“Well, sir,” admitted Jason, in concern; “a bit done up, sir,\nperhaps.  A little pale, sir; though I’m sure–”",
        "“I’m glad to hear it,” said Jimmie Dale, sitting up in bed.  “The\nworse I look, the better!”",
        "“I–I beg pardon, sir?” stammered Jason.",
        "“Jason,” said Jimmie Dale, gravely again, “you have had reason to\nknow that on several occasions my life has been threatened.  It is\nthreatened now.  You know from last night that this house is now\nwatched.  You may, or you may not have surmised–that our telephone\nwires have been tapped.”",
        "“Tapped, sir!\"–Jason’s face had gone a little gray.",
        "“Yes; a party line, so to speak,” said Jimmie Dale grimly.  “Do you\nunderstand?  You must be careful to say no more, no less than\nexactly what I tell you to say.  Now go and telephone!  Ask the\ndoctor to come over and see me this morning.  Simply say that I am\nnot feeling well; but that, apart from being apparently in a very\nnervous condition, you do not know what is the matter.”",
        "“Yes, sir–good Lord, sir!” gasped Jason–and left the room to carry\nout his orders.",
        "An hour later, Doctor Merlin had been and gone–and had left two\nprescriptions; one written, the other verbal.  With the written one,\nBenson, in his chauffeur’s livery, was dispatched to the drug store;\nthe verbal one was precisely what Jimmie Dale had expected from the\nfussy old family physician: “Two or three days of quiet in the house\nJames; and if you need me again, let me know.”",
        "“Now, Jason,” said Jimmie Dale, when the old man had returned from\nushering Doctor Merlin from the house, “our friends out there will\nbe anxious to learn the verdict.  I was to dine with the Ross-\nHendersons to-morrow night, was I not?”",
        "“Yes, sir; I think so, sir.”",
        "“Make sure!” said Jimmie Dale.  “Look in my engagement book there on\nthe table.”",
        "Jason looked.",
        "“Yes, sir, that’s right,” he announced.",
        "“Very good,” said Jimmie Dale softly.  “Now go and telephone again,\nJason.  Present my regrets and excuses to the Ross-Hendersons, and\nsay that under the doctor’s orders I am confined to the house for\nthe next few days–and, Jason!”",
        "“Yes, sir?”",
        "“When Benson returns with the medicine let him bring it here\nhimself–and I shall want you as well.”",
        "Jimmie Dale propped himself up a little wearily on the pillows, as\nJason went out of the room.  After all, his condition was not\nentirely feigned.  He was, as a matter of fact, pretty well played\nout, both mentally and physically.  Certainly, that he should\nrequire a doctor and be confined to the house could not arouse\nsuspicion even in the minds of those alert, aristocratic thugs of\nthe Crime Club, prone as they would be to suspect anything–a man\nwho had been knocked unconscious in an automobile smash the night\nbefore, had been in a fight, had been subjected to a terrific mental\nshock, to say nothing of the infernal drug that had been\nadministered to him, might well be expected to be indisposed the\nnext morning, and for several mornings following that!  It might,\nindeed, even cause them to relax their vigilance for the time being–\nthough he dared build nothing on that.  Well, he had only to coach\nBenson and Jason in the parts they were to play, and the balance of\nthe morning and all the afternoon was his in which to rest.",
        "He reached over to the table, picked up a pencil and paper, and\nbegan to jot down memoranda.  He had just tossed the pencil back on\nthe table as the two men entered.",
        "Jason, at a sign, closed the door quietly.",
        "Jimmie Dale looked at Benson half musingly, half whimsically, for a\nmoment before he spoke.",
        "“Benson,” he said, “the back seat of the large touring car is hinged\nand lifts up, once the cushion is removed, doesn’t it?”",
        "“Yes, sir,” Benson answered promptly.",
        "“And there’s space enough for, say, a man inside, isn’t there?”",
        "“Why, yes, sir; I suppose so–at a squeeze\"–Benson stared blankly.",
        "“Quite so!” said Jimmie Dale calmly.  “Now, another matter, Benson:\nI believe some chauffeurs have a habit, when occasion lends itself,\nof taking, shall we say, their ’best girl’ out riding in their\nmasters’ machines?”",
        "“SOME might,” Benson replied, a little stiffly.  “I hope you don’t\nthink, sir, that–”",
        "“One moment, Benson.  The point is, it’s done–quite generally?”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“And you have a ’best girl,’ or at least could find one for such a\npurpose, if you were so inclined?”",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Benson; “but–”",
        "“Very good!” Jimmie Dale interrupted.  “Then to-night, Benson,\ntaking advantage of my illness, and to-morrow night, and the nights\nafter that until further notice, you will acquire and put into\npractice that reprehensible habit.”",
        "“I–I don’t understand, Mr. Dale.”",
        "“No; I dare say not,” said Jimmie Dale–and then the whimsicality\ndropped from him.  “Benson,” he said slowly, “do you remember a\nnight, nearly four years ago, the first night you ever saw me?  You\nhad, indiscreetly, I think, displayed more money than was wise in\nthat East Side neighbourhood.”",
        "“I remember,” said Benson, with a sudden start; then simply: “I\nwouldn’t be here now, sir, if it hadn’t been for you.”",
        "“Well,” said Jimmie Dale quietly, “the tables are turned to-day,\nBenson.  As Jason already knows, this house is watched.  For reasons\nthat I cannot explain, I am in great danger.  Bluntly, I am putting\nmy life in your hands–and Jason’s.”",
        "Benson looked for an instant from Jimmie Dale to Jason, caught the\nstrained, troubled expression on the old man’s face, then back again\nat Jimmie Dale.",
        "“D’ye mean that, sir!” he cried.  “Then you can count on me, Mr.\nDale, to the last ditch!”",
        "“I know that, Benson,” Jimmie Dale said softly.  “And now, both of\nyou, listen!  It is imperative that I should get away from the\nhouse; and equally imperative that those watching should believe\nthat I am still here.  Not even the servants are to be permitted a\nsuspicion that I am not here in my bed, ill.  That, Jason, is your\ntask.  You will allow no one to wait on me but yourself; you will\nbring the meal trays up regularly–and eat the food yourself.  You\nwill answer all inquiries, telephone and otherwise, in person–I am\nnot seeing any one.  You understand perfectly, Jason?”",
        "“I understand, Master Jim.  You need have no fear, sir, on that\nscore.”",
        "“Now, you, Benson,” Jimmie Dale went on.  “A few minutes ago I sent\nyou out in your chauffeur’s togs with that prescription.  You were\nundoubtedly observed.  I wanted you to be.  It was quite necessary\nthat they should know and be able to recognise you again–to\ndisabuse their minds later on of the possibility that I might be\nmasquerading in your clothes; and also, of course, that they should\nknow who you were, and what your position was in the household.\nVery well!  To-night, at eight o’clock exactly, you are to go out\nfrom the back door of the house to the garage.  On the way out–it\nwill be quite dark then–I want you to drop something, say, a bunch\nof keys that you had been jingling in your hand.  You are to\nexperience some difficulty in finding it again, move about a little\nto force any one that may be lurking by the garage to retreat around\nthe corner.  Grumble a bit and make a little noise; but you are not\nto overdo it–a couple of minutes at the outside is enough, by that\ntime I shall be under the car seat.  You will then run the machine\nout to the street and stop at the curb, jump out, and, as though you\nhad forgotten something, hurry back to the garage.  You must not be\naway long–enough only to permit, say, a passer-by to glance into\nthe car and satisfy himself that it is empty.  You understand, of\ncourse, Benson, that the hood must be down–no closed car to invite\neven the suggestion of concealment–that would be a fatal blunder.\nDrive then to the young lady’s home by as direct a route as you can–\ngive no appearance of being aware that you are followed, as you\nwill be, and much less the appearance of attempting to elude\npursuit.  Act naturally.  Between here and your destination I will\nmanage readily enough to leave the car.  You will then take the\nyoung lady for her drive–that is what they will be interested in–\nyour motive for going out to-night.  And, as I said, take her\ndriving again on each succeeding night–establish the HABIT to their\nsatisfaction.”",
        "Jimmie Dale paused, glanced at the paper which he still held in his\nhand, then handed it to Benson.",
        "“Just one thing more, Benson,” he said: “Listed on that paper you\nwill find a different rendezvous for each night for the next five\nnights, excluding to-night, which, after you have returned the young\nlady to her home, you are to pass by on your way back here.  See\nthat your drive is always over in time for you to pass each night’s\nrendezvous at half past eleven sharp.  Don’t stop unless I signal\nyou.  If I am not there, go right on home, and be at the next place\non the following night.  I am fairly well satisfied they will not\nbother about you after to-night, or to-morrow night at the most;\nbut, for all that, you must take no chances, so, except in the route\nyou take in going to the young lady’s, always avoid covering the\nsame ground twice, which might give the appearance of having some\nulterior purpose in view–even in your drives, vary your runs.  Is\nthis clear, Benson?”",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Benson earnestly.",
        "“Very well, then,” said Jimmie Dale.  “Eight o’clock to the dot,\nBenson–compare your time with Jason’s.  And now, Jason, see that I\nget a chance to sleep until dinner time to-night.”",
        "The hours that followed were hours of sound and much-needed sleep\nfor Jimmie Dale, and from which he awoke only on Jason’s entrance\nthat evening with the dinner tray.",
        "“I’ve slept like a log, Jason!” he cried briskly, as he leaped out\nof bed.  “Anything new–anything happened?”",
        "“No, sir; not a thing,” Jason answered.  “Only, Master Jim, sir\"–\nthe old man twisted his hands nervously–\"I–you’ll excuse my saying\nso, sir–I do hope you’ll be careful to-night, sir.  I can’t help\nbeing afraid that something’ll happen to you, Master Jim.”",
        "“Nonsense, Jason!” Jimmie Dale laughed cheerfully.  “There’s nothing\ngoing to happen–to me!  You go ahead now and stay with the\nservants, and get them out of the road at the proper time.”",
        "He bathed, dressed, ate his dinner, and was slipping cartridges into\nthe magazine of his automatic when, within a minute or two of eight\no’clock, Jason’s whisper came from the doorway.",
        "“It’s all clear now, Master Jim, sir.”",
        "“Right!” Jimmie Dale responded–and followed Jason down the\nstairway, and to the head of the cellar stairs.",
        "Here Jason halted.",
        "“God keep you, Master Jim!” said the old man huskily.  “Good-night,\nJason,” Jimmie Dale answered softly; and, with a reassuring squeeze\non the other’s arm, went on down to the cellar.",
        "Here he moved quickly, noiselessly across to the window–not the\nwindow of the night before, but another of the same description,\nalmost directly beneath the one in his den above, that faced the\ngarage and lay in the line of that black shadow path between the two\nbuildings.  Deftly, cautiously without sound, a half inch, an inch\nat a time he opened it.  He stood listening, then.  A minute passed.\nThen he heard Benson open and shut the back door; then Benson in the\nyard; and then Benson’s voice in a muttered and irritable growl,\ntalking to himself, as he stamped around on the ground.",
        "With a lithe, agile movement, Jimmie Dale pulled himself up and\nthrough the window–and began to creep rapidly on hands and knees\ntoward the garage.  It was dark, intensely dark.  He could barely\ndistinguish Benson’s form, though, as he passed the other, the\nslight sounds he made drowned out by the chauffeur’s angry\nmumblings, he could have reached out and touched Benson easily.",
        "He gained the interior of the garage, and, as Benson, came on again,\nstepped lightly into the car, lifted the seat, and wriggled his way\ninside.",
        "It was close, stuffy, abominably cramped, but Jimmie Dale was\nsmiling grimly now.  Thanks to Benson, there wasn’t a possibility\nthat he had been seen.  He both felt and heard Benson start the car.\nThen the car moved forward, ran the length of the driveway, bumped\nslightly as it made the street–and stopped.  He heard Benson jump\nout and run back–and then he listened intently, and the grim smile\nflickered on his lips again.  Came the sound of a footstep on the\nsidewalk close beside the car–then silence–the car shook a little\nas though some one’s weight was on the step–then the footsteps\nreceded–Benson returned on the run–and the car started forward\nonce more.",
        "Perhaps ten minutes passed.  Three times the car had swerved\nsharply, making a corner turn.  Then Jimmie Dale pushed up the seat,\nand, protected from observation from behind by the back of the car\nitself, crawled out and crouched down on the floor of the tonneau.",
        "“Don’t look around, Benson,” he said calmly.  “Are we followed?”",
        "“Yes, sir.” Benson answered.  “At least, there’s always been a car\nbehind us, though not the same one.  They’re pretty clever.  There\nmust be three or four, each following the other.  Every time I turn\na corner it’s a different car that turns it behind me.”",
        "“How far behind?” Jimmie Dale asked.",
        "“Half a block.”",
        "“Slow down a little,” instructed Jimmie Dale; “and don’t turn\nanother corner until they’ve had a chance to accomodate themselves\nto your new speed.  You are going too fast for me to jump, and I\ndon’t want them to notice any change in speed, except what is made\nin plain sight.  Yes; that’s better.  Where are we, Benson?”",
        "“That’s Amsterdam Avenue ahead,” replied Benson.",
        "“All right,” said Jimmie Dale quietly.  “Turn into it.  The more\npeople the better.  Tell me just as you are about to turn.”",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Benson; then, almost on the instant, “All ready,\nsir!”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s hand reached out for the door catch, edged the door\najar, the car swerved, took the corner–and Jimmie Dale stepped out\non the running board, hung there negligently for a moment as though\nchatting with Benson, and then with an airy “good-night” dropped\nnonchalantly to the ground, and the next instant had mingled with\nthe throng of pedestrians on the sidewalk.",
        "A half minute later, a large gray automobile turned the corner and\nfollowed Benson–and Jimmie Dale, stepping out into the street\nagain, swung on a downtown car.  The road to the Sanctuary was open!",
        "In his impatience, now, the street car seemed to drag along every\nfoot of the way; but a glance at his watch, as he finally reached\nthe Bowery, and, walking then, rapidly approached the cross street a\nfew steps ahead that led to the Sanctuary, told him that it was\nstill but a quarter to nine.  But even at that he quickened his\nsteps a little.  He was free now!  There was a sort of savage,\nelemental uplift upon him.  He was free!  He could strike now in his\nown defense–and hers!  In a few moments he would be at the\nSanctuary; in a few more he would be Larry the Bat, and by to-morrow\nat the latest he would see–The Tocsin.  After all, that “hour” was\nnot to be taken from him!  It was not, perhaps, the hour that she\nhad meant it should be, thought and prayed, perhaps, that it might\nbe!  It was not the hour of victory.  But it was the hour that meant\nto him the realisation of the years of longing, the hour when he\nshould see her, see her for the first time face to face, when there\nshould be no more barriers between them, when–”",
        "“Fer Gawd’s sake, mister, buy a pencil!”",
        "A hand was plucking at his sleeve, the thin voice was whining in his\near.  He halted mechanically.  A woman, old, bedraggled, ragged, was\nthrusting a bunch of cheap pencils imploringly toward him–and then,\nwith a stifled cry, Jimmie Dale leaned forward.  The eyes that\nlifted to his for an instant were bright and clear with the vigor of\nyouth, great eyes of brown they were, and trouble, hope, fear,\nwistfulness, ay, and a glorious shyness were in their depths.  And\nthen the voice he knew so well, the Tocsin’s was whispering\nhurriedly:",
        "“I will be waiting here, Jimmie–for Larry the Bat.”",
        "It was only a little way back along the street from the Sanctuary to\nthe corner on the Bowery where as Jimmie Dale he had left her, where\nas Larry the Bat now he was going to meet her again; it would take\nonly a moment or so, even at Larry the Bat’s habitual,\ncharacteristic, slouching, gait–but it seemed that was all too\nslow, that he must throw discretion to the winds and run the\ndistance.  His blood was tingling; there was elation upon him,\ncoupled with an almost childlike dread that she might be gone.",
        "“The Tocsin!  The Tocsin!” he kept saying to himself.",
        "Yes; she was still there, still whiningly imploring those who passed\nto buy her miserable pencils–and then, with a quick-flung whisper\nto him to follow as he slouched up close to her, she had started\nslowly down the street.",
        "“The Tocsin!  The Tocsin!  The Tocsin!\"–his brain seemed to be\nringing with the words, ringing with them in a note clear as a\nsilver bell.  The Tocsin–at last!  The woman who so strangely, so\nwonderfully, so mysteriously had entered into his life, and\npossessed it, and filled it with a love and yearning that had come\nto mold and sway and actuate his very existence–the woman for whom\nhe had fought; for whom he had risked, and gladly risked, his\nwealth, his name, his honour–everything; the woman for whose sake\nhe, the Gray Seal, was sought and hounded as the most notorious\ncriminal of the age; she whose cleverness, whose resourcefulness,\nwhose amazing intimacy with the hidden things of the underworld had\nseemed, indeed, to border on the supernatural; she, the Tocsin–the\nwoman whose face he had never seen before!  The woman whose face he\nhad never seen before–and who now was that wretched hag that\nhobbled along the street before him, begging, whining, and\nimportuning the passers-by to purchase of her pitiful wares!",
        "He laughed a little–buoyantly.  He had never pictured a first\nmeeting such as this!  A hag?  Yes!  And one as disreputable in\nappearance as he himself, as Larry the Bat, was disreputable!  But\nhe had seen her eyes!  Inimitable as was her disguise, she could not\nhide her eyes, or hide the pledge they held of the beauty of form\nand feature beneath the tattered rags and the touch of a master in\nthe make-up that brought haggard want and age into the face–and\ndimly he began to divine the source, the means by which she had\nacquired the information that for years had enabled her to plan\ntheir coups, that had enabled him to execute them under the guise of\ncrime, that for years had seemed beyond all human reach.",
        "Where was she going?  Where was she taking him?  But what did it\nmatter!  The years of waiting were at an end–the years of mystery\nin a few moments now would be mystery no more!",
        "Ah!  She had turned from the Bowery, and was heading east.  He\nshuffled on after her, guardedly, a half block behind.  It was well\nthat Jimmie Dale had disappeared, that he was Larry the Bat again–\nthe neighbourhood was growing more and more one that Jimmie Dale\ncould not long linger in without attracting attention; while, on the\nother hand, it was the natural environment of such as Larry the Bat\nand such as she, who was leading him now to the supreme moment of\nhis life.  Yes, it was that–the fulfillment of the years!  The\nthought of it alone filled his mind, his soul; it brushed aside, it\nblotted out for the time being the danger, the peril, the deadly\nmenace that hung over them both.  It was only that she, the Tocsin,\nwas here–only that at last they would be together.",
        "On she went, traversing street after street, the direction always\ntrending toward the river–until finally she halted before what\nappeared to be, as nearly as he could make out in the almost total\ndarkness of the ill-lighted street, a small and tumble-down, self-\ncontained dwelling that bordered on what seemed to be an unfenced\nstore yard of some description.  He drew his breath in sharply.  She\nhad halted–waiting for him to come up with her.  She was waiting\nfor him–WAITING for him!  It seemed as though he drank of some\nstrange, exhilarating elixir–he reached her side eagerly–and then–\nand then–her hand had caught his, and she was leading him into the\nhouse, into a black passage where he could see nothing, into a room\nequally black over whose threshold he stumbled, and her voice in a\nlow, conscious way, with a little tremour, a half sob in it that\nthrilled him with its promise, was in his ears:",
        "“We are safe here, Jimmie, for a little while–but, oh, Jimmie, what\nhave I done!  What have I done to bring you into this–only–only–I\nwas so sure, so sure, Jimmie, that there was nothing more to fear!”",
        "The blood was beating in hammer blows at his temples.  It seemed all\nunreal, untrue that this moment could be his, that it was not a\ndream–a dream which was presently to be snatched from him in a\nbitter awakening.  And then he laughed out wildly, passionately.\nNo–it was true, it was real!  Her breath was on his cheek, it was a\nliving, pulsing hand that was still in his–and then soul and mind\nand body seemed engulfed and lost in a mad ecstasy–and she was in\nhis arms, crushed to him, and he was raining kisses upon her face.",
        "“I love you!  I love you!” he was crying hoarsely; and over and over\nagain: “I love you!  I love you!”",
        "She did not struggle.  The warm, rich lips were yielding to his; he\ncould feel the throb, the life in the young, lithe form against his\nown.  She was his–his!  The years, the past, all were swept away–\nand she was his at last–his for always.  And there came a mighty\nsense of kingship upon him, as though all the world were at his\nfeet, and virility, and a great, glad strength above all other\nmen’s, and a song was in his soul, a song triumphant–for she was\nhis!",
        "“You!” he cried out–and strained her to him.  “You!” he cried\nagain–and kissed her lips and her eyelids and her lips again.",
        "And then her head was buried on his shoulder, and she was crying\nsoftly; but after a moment she raised her hands and laid them upon\nhis face, and held them there, and because it was dark, dared to\nraise her head as well, and her eyes to look into his.",
        "Then for a long time they stood there so, and for a long time\nneither spoke–and then with a little startled, broken cry, as\nthough the peril and the menace hanging over them, forgotten for the\nmoment, were thrust like a knife stab suddenly upon her, she drew\nherself away, and ran from him, and went and got a lamp, and lighted\nit, and set it upon the table.",
        "And Jimmie Dale, still standing there, watched her.  How gloriously\nher eyes shone, dimmed and misty with the tears that filled them\nthough they were!  And there was nothing incongruous in the rags\nthat clothed her, in the squalour and poverty of the bare room, in\nthe white furrows that the tears had plowed through the grime and\nmake-up on her cheeks.",
        "“You wonderful, wonderful woman!” Jimmie Dale whispered.",
        "She shook her head as though almost in self-reproach.",
        "“I am not wonderful, Jimmie,” she said, in a low voice.  “I\"–and\nthen she caught his arm, and her voice broke a little–\"I’ve brought\nyou into this–probably to your death.  Jimmie, tell me what\nhappened last night, and since then.  I–I’ve thought at times to-\nday I should go mad.  Oh, Jimmie, there is so much to say to-night,\nso much to do if–if we are ever to be together for–for always.\nLast night, Jimmie–the telephone–I knew there was danger–that all\nhad gone wrong–what was it?”",
        "His arms were around her shoulders, drawing her close to him again.",
        "“I found the wires tapped,” he said slowly.",
        "“Yes, and–and the man you met–the chauffeur?”",
        "“He is dead,” Jimmie Dale answered gently.",
        "He felt her hand close with a quick, spasmodic clutch upon his arm;\nher face grew white–and for a moment she turned away her head.",
        "“And–and the package?” she asked presently.",
        "“I do not know,” replied Jimmie Dale.  “He did not have it with him;\nhe–”",
        "“Wait!” she interrupted quickly.  “We are only wasting time like\nthis!  Tell me everything, everything just as it happened,\neverything from the moment you received my letter.”",
        "And, holding her there in his arms, softening as best he could the\nmore brutal details, he told her.  And, at the end, for a little\nwhile she was silent; then in a strained, impulsive way she asked\nagain:",
        "“The chauffeur–you are sure–you are positive that he is dead?”",
        "“Yes,” said Jimmie Dale grimly; “I am sure.”  And then the pent-up\nflood of questions burst from his lips.  Who was the chauffeur?  The\npackage, the box numbered 428, and John Johansson?  And the Crime\nClub?  And the issue at stake?  The danger, the peril that\nsurrounded her?  And she–above all–more than anything else–about\nherself–her strange life, its mystery?",
        "She checked him with a strangely wistful touch of her finger upon\nhis lips, with a queer, pathetic shake of her head.",
        "“No, Jimmie; not that way.  You would never understand.  I cannot–”",
        "“But I am to know–now!  Surely I am to know NOW!” he cried, a\nsudden sense of dismay upon him.  Three years!  Three years–and\nalways the “next” time!  “I must know now, if I am to help you!”",
        "She smiled a little wanly at him, as she drew herself away, and,\ndropping into a chair, placed her elbows on the rickety table,\ncupping her chin in her hands.",
        "“Yes; you are to know now,” she said, almost as though she were\ntalking to herself; then, with a swift intake of her breath,\nimpulsively: “Jimmie!  Jimmie!  I had thought that it would be all\nso different when–when you came.  That–that I would have nothing\nto fear–for you–for me–because–it would be all over.  And now\nyou are here, Jimmie–and, oh, thank God for you!–but I feel to-\nnight almost–almost as though it were hopeless, that–that we were\nbeaten.”",
        "“Beaten!”  He stepped quickly to the table, and sat down, and took\none of her hands away from her face to hold it in both his own.\n\"Beaten!” he laughed out defiantly; then, playfully, soothingly, to\nreassure her: “Jimmie Dale and Larry the Bat and the Gray Seal and\nthe Tocsin–BEATEN!  And after we have just scored the last trick!”",
        "“But we do not hold many trumps, Jimmie,” she answered gravely.\n\"You have seen something of this Crime Club’s power, its methods,\nits merciless, cruel, inhuman cunning, and you, perhaps, think that\nyou understand–but you have not begun to grasp the extent of either\nthat power or cunning.  This horrible organisation has been in\nexistence for many years.  I do not know how many.  I only know that\nthe men of whom it is composed are not ordinary criminals, that they\ndo not work in the ordinary way–to-day, they set the machinery of\nfraud, deception, robbery, and murder in motion that ten years from\nnow, and, perhaps, only then, will culminate in the final success of\ntheir schemes–and they play only for enormous stakes.  But\"–her\nlips grew set–\"you will see for yourself.  I must not talk any\nlonger than is necessary; we must not take too much time.  You count\non three days before they begin to suspect that all is not right\nwith Jimmie Dale–I know them better than you, and I give you two\ndays, forty-eight hours at the outside, and possibly far less.\nJimmie\"–abruptly–\"did you ever hear of Peter LaSalle?”",
        "“The capitalist?  Yes!” said Jimmie Dale.  “He died a few years ago.\nI know his brother Henry well–at the club, and all that.”",
        "“Do you!” she said evenly.  “Well, the man you know is not Peter\nLaSalle’s brother; he is an impostor–and one of the Crime Club.”",
        "“Not–Peter LaSalle’s brother!\"–Jimmie Dale repeated the words\nmechanically.  And suddenly his brain was whirling.  Vaguely, dimly,\nin little memory snatches, events, not pertinent then, vitally\nsignificant now, came crowding upon him.  Peter LaSalle had come\nfrom somewhere in the West to live in New York; and very shortly\nafterward had died.  The estate had been worth something over eleven\nmillions.  And there had been–he leaned quickly, tensely forward\nover the table, staring at her.  “My God!” he whispered hoarsely.\n\"You are not, you cannot be–the–the daughter–Peter LaSalle’s\ndaughter, who disappeared strangely!”",
        "“Yes,” she said quietly.  “I am Marie LaSalle.”",
        "LaSalle!  The old French name!  That old French inscription on the\nring: “SONNEZ LE TOCSIN!”  Yes; he began to understand now.  She was\nMarie LaSalle!  He began to remember more clearly.",
        "Marie LaSalle!  They had said she was one of the most beautiful\ngirls who had ever made her entree into New York society.  But he\nhad never met her–as Marie LaSalle; never met her–until now, as\nthe Tocsin, in this bare, destitute, squalid hovel, here at bay,\nboth of them, for their lives.",
        "He had been away when she had come with her father to New York; and\non his return there had only been the father’s brother in the\nfather’s place–and she was gone.  He remembered the furor her\ndisappearance had caused; the enormous rewards her uncle had offered\nin an effort to trace her; the thousand and one speculations as to\nwhat had become of her; and that then, gradually, as even the most\nstartling and mystifying of events and happenings always do, the\naffair had dropped into oblivion and had been forgotten by the\npublic at least.  He began to count back.  Yes, it must have been\nnearly five years ago; two years before she, as the Tocsin, and he,\nas the Gray Seal, had formed their amazing and singular partnership,\nthat–he started suddenly, as she spoke.",
        "“I want to tell you in as few words as I can,” she said abruptly,\nbreaking the silence.  “Listen, then, Jimmie.  My mother died ten\nyears ago.  I was little more than a child then.  Shortly after her\ndeath, father made a business trip to New York, and, on the advice\nof some supposed friends, he had a new will drawn up by a lawyer\nwhom they recommended, and to whom they introduced him.  I do not\nknow who those men were.  The lawyer’s name was Travers, Hilton\nTravers.”  She glanced curiously at Jimmie Dale, and added quickly:\n\"He was the chauffeur–the man who was killed last night.”",
        "“You mean,” Jimmie Dale burst out, “you mean that he was–but,\nfirst, the will!  What was in the will?”",
        "“It was a very simple will,” she answered.  “And from the nature of\nit, it was not at all strange that my father should have been\nwilling to have had it drawn by a comparative stranger, if that is\nwhat you are thinking.  Summarised in a few words, the will left\neverything to me, and appointed my Uncle Henry as my guardian and\nthe sole executor of the estate until I should have reached my\ntwenty-fifth birthday.  It provided for a certain sum each year to\nbe paid to my uncle for his services as executor; and at the\nexpiration of the trust period–that is, when I was twenty-five–\nbequeathed to him the sum of one hundred thousand dollars.”",
        "Jimmie Dale nodded.  “Go on!” he prompted.",
        "“It is hard to tell it in logical sequence,” she said, hesitating a\nmoment.  “So many things seem to overlap each other.  You must\nunderstand a little more about Hilton Travers.  During the five\nyears following the signing of the will father came frequently to\nNew York, and became, not only intimate with Travers, but so much\nimpressed with the other’s cleverness and ability that he kept\nputting more and more of his business into Travers’ hands.  At the\nend of that five years, we moved to New York, and father, who was\nthen quite an old man, retired from all active business, and turned\nover a great many of his personal affairs to Travers to look after\nfor him, giving Travers power of attorney in a number of instances.\nSo much for Travers.  Now about my uncle.  He was my father’s only\nbrother; in fact, they were the only surviving members of their\nfamily, apart from very distant connections in France, from where,\ngenerations back, the family originally came.”  Her hand touched\nJimmie Dale’s for an instant.  “That ring, Jimmie, with its crest\nand inscription, is the old family coat of arms.”",
        "“Yes,” he said briefly; “I surmised as much.”",
        "“Strange as it may seem, in view of the fact that they had not seen\neach other for twenty years,” she went on hurriedly “my father and\nmy uncle were more than ordinarily attached to each other.  Letters\npassed regularly between them, and there was constant talk of one\npaying the other a visit–but the visit never materialised.  My\nuncle was somewhere in Australia, my father was here, and\nconsequently I never saw my uncle.  He was quite a different type of\nman from father–more restless, less settled, more rough and ready,\npreferring the outdoor life of the Australian bush to the\nrestrictions of any so-called civilisation, I imagine.  Financially,\nI do not think he ever succeeded very well, for twice, in one way or\nanother, he lost every sheep on his ranch and father set him up\nagain; and I do not think he could ever have had much of a ranch,\nfor I remember once, in one of the letters he wrote, that he said he\nhad not seen a white man in weeks, so he must have lived a very\nlonely life.  Indeed, at about the time father drew the new will, my\nuncle wrote, saying that he had decided to give up sheep running on\nhis own account as it did not pay, and to accept a very favourable\noffer that had been made to him to manage a ranch in New Zealand;\nand his next letter was from the latter country, stating that he had\ncarried out his intentions, and was well satisfied with the change\nhe had made.  The long-proposed visit still continued to occupy my\nfather’s thoughts, and on his retirement from business he definitely\nmade up his mind to go out to New Zealand, taking me with him.  In\nfact, the plans were all arranged, my uncle expressed unbounded\ndelight in his letters, and we were practically on the eve of\nsailing, when a cable came from my uncle, telling us to postpone the\nvisit for a few months, as he was obliged to make a buying trip for\nhis new employer that would keep him away that length of time–and\nthen\"–her fingers, that had been abstractedly picking out the lines\nformed by the grain of the wood in the table top, closed suddenly\ninto tight-clenched fists–\"and then–my father died.”",
        "Jimmie Dale turned away his head.  There were tears in her eyes.\nThe old sense of unreality was strong upon him again.  He was\nlistening to the Tocsin’s story.  It was strange that he should be\ndoing that–that it could be really so!  It seemed as though\nmagically he had been transported out of the world where for years\npast he had lived with danger lurking at every turn, where men set\nwatch about his house to trap him, where the denizens of the\nunderworld yowled like starving beasts to sink their fangs in him,\nwhere the police were ceaselessly upon his trail to wreak an\ninsensate vengeance upon him; it seemed as though he had been\ntransported away from all that to something that he had dreamed\nmight, perhaps, sometime happen, that he had hoped might happen,\nthat he had longed for always, but now that it was his, that it also\nwas full of the sense of the unreal.  And yet as his mind followed\nthe thread of her story, and leaped ahead and vaguely glimpsed what\nwas to come, be was conscious in a sort of premonitory way of a\nvaster peril than any he had ever known, as though forces, for the\nmoment masked, were arrayed against him whose strength and whose\nmalignity were beyond human parallel.  In what a strange, almost\nincoherent way his brain was working!  He roused himself a little\nand looked around him–and, with a shock, the starkness of the room,\nthe abject, pitiful air of destitution brought home to him with\nterrific, startling force the significance of the scene in which he\nwas playing a part.  His face set suddenly in hard lines.  That she\nshould have been brought to assume such a life as this–forced out\nof her environment of wealth and refinement, forced in her purity to\nrub shoulders with the vile, the dissolute, forced to exist as such\na creature amid the crime and vice, the wretched horror of the\nunderworld that swirled around her!  There was anger now upon him,\nburning, hot–a merciless craving that was a savage, hungry lust for\nvengeance.",
        "And then she was speaking again:",
        "“Father’s death occurred very shortly after my uncle’s message\nadvising us to postpone our trip was received.  On his death,\nTravers, very naturally, as father’s lawyer, cabled my uncle to come\nto New York at once; and my uncle replied, saying that he was coming\nby the first steamer.”",
        "She paused again–but only for an instant, as though to frame her\nthoughts in words.",
        "“I have told you that I had never seen my uncle, that even my father\nhad not seen him for twenty years; and I have told you that the man\nyou know as Henry LaSalle is an impostor–I am using the word\n’uncle’ now when I refer to him simply to avoid confusion.  You are,\nperhaps, expecting me to say that I took a distinctive dislike to\nhim from the moment he arrived?  On the contrary, I had every reason\nto be predisposed toward him; and, indeed, was rather agreeably\nsurprised than otherwise–he was not nearly so uncouth and\nunpolished as, somehow, I had pictured his life would have made him.\nDo you understand, Jimmie?  He was kind, sympathetic; and, in an\napathetic way, I liked him.  I say ’apathetic’ because I think that\nbest describes my own attitude toward every one and everything\nfollowing father’s death until–THAT NIGHT.”",
        "She rose abruptly from her chair, as though a passive position of\nany kind had suddenly become intolerable.",
        "“Why tell you what my father and I were to each other!” she cried\nout in a low, passionate voice.  “It seemed as though everything\nthat meant anything had gone out of my life.  I became worn out,\nnervous; and though the days were bad enough, the nights were a\nsource of dread.  I began to suffer from insomnia–I could not\nsleep.  This was even before my supposed uncle came.  I used to read\nfor hours and hours in my room after I had gone to bed.  But\"–she\nflung out her hand with an impatient gesture–\"there is no need to\ndwell on that.  One night, about a week after that man had arrived,\nand a little over a month after father had died, I was in my room\nand had finished a book I was reading.  I remember that it was well\nafter midnight.  I had not the slightest inclination to sleep.  I\npicked up another book–and after that another.  There were plenty\nin my room; but, irrationally, of course, none pleased me.  I\ndecided to go down to the library–not that I think I really\nexpected to find anything that I actually wanted, but more because\nit was an impulse, and furnished me for the moment with some\ndefinite objective, something to do.  I got up, slipped on a\ndressing gown, and went downstairs.  The lights were all out.  I was\njust on the point of switching on those in the reception hall, when\nsuddenly it seemed as though I had not strength to lift my hand, and\nI remember that for an instant I grew terribly cold with dread and\nfear.  From the room on my right a voice had reached me.  The door\nwas closed, but the voice was raised in an outburst of profanity.\nI–I could hear every word.",
        "“’If she’s out of the way, there’s no come-back,’ the voice snarled.\n’I won’t listen to anything else!  Do you hear!  Why, you fool, what\nare you trying to do–hand me one!  Turn everything into cash, and\ndivvy, and beat it–eh?  And I’m the goat, and I get caught and get\ntwenty years for stealing trust funds–and the rest of you get the\ncoin!’  He swore terribly again.  ’Who’s taken the risk in this for\nthe last five years!  There’ll be no smart Aleck lawyer tricks–\nthere’ll be no halfway measures!  And who are you to dictate!  She\ngoes out–that’s safe–I inherit as next of kin, with no one to\ndispute it, and that’s all there is to it!’",
        "“I stood there and could not move.  It was the voice of the man I\nknew as my uncle!  My heart seemed to have stopped beating.  I tried\nto tell myself that I was dreaming, that it was too horrible, too\nincredible to be real; that they could not really mean to–to MURDER\nme.  And then I recognised Hilton Travers’ voice.",
        "“’I am not dictating, and you are not serious, of course,’ he said,\nwith what seemed an uneasy laugh.  ’I am only warning you that you\nare forgetting to take the real Henry LaSalle into account.  He is\nbound to hear of this eventually, and then–’",
        "“Another voice broke in–one I did not recognise.",
        "“’You’re talking too loud, both of you!  Travers doesn’t understand,\nbut he’s to be wised up to-night, according to orders, and–’",
        "“The voice became inaudible, muffled–I could not hear any more.  I\nsuppose I remained there another three or four minutes, too stunned\nto know what to do; and then I ran softly along the hall to the\nlibrary door.  The library, you understand, was at the rear of the\nroom they were in, and the two rooms were really one; that is, there\nwas only an archway between them.  I cannot tell you what my\nemotions were–I do not know.  I only know that I kept repeating to\nmyself, ’they are going to kill me, they are going to kill me!’ and\nthat it seemed I must try and find out everything, everything I\ncould.”",
        "She turned away from the table, and began to pace nervously up and\ndown the miserable room.",
        "Jimmie Dale rose impulsively from his chair–but she waved him back\nagain.",
        "“No; wait!” she said.  “Let me finish.  I crept into the library.\nIt took me a long time, because I had to be so careful not to make\nthe slightest noise.  I suppose it was fully six or seven minutes\nfrom the time I had first heard my supposed uncle’s voice until I\nhad crept far enough forward to be able to see into the room beyond.\nThere were three men there.  The man I knew as my uncle was sitting\nat one end of the table; another had his back toward me; and Travers\nwas facing in my direction–and I think I never saw so ghastly a\nface as was Hilton Travers’ then.  He was standing up, sort of\nswaying, as he leaned with both hands on the table.",
        "“’Now then, Travers,’ the man whose back was turned to me was saying\nthreateningly, ’you’ve got the story now–sign those papers!’",
        "“It seemed as though Travers could not speak for a moment.  He kept\nlooking wildly from one to the other.  He was white to the lips.",
        "“’You’ve let me in for–THIS!’ he said hoarsely, at last, ’You\ndevils–you devils–you devils!  You’ve let me in for–murder!  Both\nof them!  Both Peter and his brother–MURDERED!’”",
        "She stopped abruptly before Jimmie Dale, and clutched his arm\ntightly.",
        "“Jimmie, I don’t know why I did not scream out.  Everything went\nblack for a moment before my eyes.  It was the first suspicion I had\nhad that my father had met with foul play, and I–”",
        "But now Jimmie Dale swayed up from his chair.",
        "“Murdered!” he exclaimed tensely.  “Your father!  But–but I\nremember perfectly, there was no hint of any such thing at the time,\nand never has been since.  He died from quite natural causes.”",
        "She looked at him strangely.",
        "“He died from–inoculation,” she said.  “Did–did you not see\nsomething of that laboratory in the Crime Club yourself the night\nbefore last–enough to understand?”",
        "“Good God!” muttered Jimmie Dale, in a startled way then: “Go on!\nGo on!  What happened then?”",
        "She passed her hand a little wearily across her eyes–and sank down\ninto her chair again.",
        "“Travers,” she continued, picking up the thread of her story, “had\nraised his voice, and the third man at the table leaned suddenly,\naggressively toward him.",
        "“’Hold your tongue!’ he growled furiously.  ’All you’re asked to do\nis sign the papers–not talk!’",
        "“Travers shook his head.",
        "“’I won’t!’ he cried out.  ’I won’t have any hand in another murder–\nin hers!  My God, I won’t–I won’t, I tell you!  It’s horrible!’",
        "“’Look here, you fool!’ the man who was posing as my uncle broke in\nthen.  ’You’re in this too deep to get out now.  If you know what’s\ngood for you, you’ll do as you’re told!’",
        "“Jimmie, I shall never forget Travers’ face.  It seemed to have\nchanged from white to gray, and there was horror in his eyes: and\nthen he seemed to lose all control of himself, shaking his fists in\ntheir faces, cursing them in utter abandon.",
        "“’I’m bad!’ he cried.  ’I’ve gone everything, everything but the\nlimit–everything but murder.  I stop there!  I’ll have no more to\ndo with this.  I’m through!  You–you pulled me into this, and–and\nI didn’t know!’",
        "“’Well, you know now!’ the third man sneered.  ’What are you going\nto do about it?’",
        "“’I’m going to see that no harm comes to Marie LaSalle,’ Travers\nanswered in a dull way.",
        "“The other man now was on his feet–and, I do not know quite how to\nexpress it, Jimmie, he seemed ominously quiet in both his voice and\nhis movements.",
        "“’You’d better think that over again, Travers!’ he said.  ’Do you\nmean it?’",
        "“’I mean it,’ Travers said.  ’I mean it–God help me!’",
        "“’You may well add that!’ returned the other, with an ugly laugh.\nHe reached out his hand toward the telephone on the table.  ’Do you\nknow what will happen to you if I telephone a certain number and say\nthat you have turned–traitor?’",
        "“’I’ll have to take my chances,’ Travers replied doggedly.  ’I’m\nthrough!’",
        "“’Take them, then!’ flung out the other.  ’You’ll have little time\ngiven you to do us any harm?’",
        "“Travers did not answer.  I think he almost expected an attack upon\nhim then from the two men.  He hesitated a moment, then backed\nslowly toward the door.  What happened in the next few moments in\nthat room, I do not know.  I stole out of the library.  I was\nobsessed with the thought that I must see Travers, see him at all\ncosts, before he got away from the house.  I reached the end of the\nhall as the room door opened, and he came out.  It was dark, as I\nsaid, and I could not see distinctly, but I could make out his form.\nHe closed the door behind him–and then I called his name in a\nwhisper.  He took a quick step toward me, then turned and hurried\ntoward the front door, and I thought he was going away–but the next\ninstant I understood his ruse.  He opened the front door, shut it\nagain quite loudly, and crept back to me.",
        "“’Take me somewhere where we will be safe–quick!’ he whispered.",
        "“There was only one place where I was sure we would be safe.  I led\nhim to the rear of the house and up the servants’ stairs, and to my\nboudoir.”",
        "She broke off abruptly, and once more rose from her chair, and once\nmore began to pace the room.  Back in his chair, Jimmie Dale, tense\nand motionless now, watched her without a word.",
        "“It would take too long to tell you all that passed between us,” she\nwent on hurriedly.  “The man was frankly a criminal–but not to the\nextent of murder.  And in that respect, at least, he was honest with\nhimself.  Almost the first words he said to me were: ’Miss LaSalle,\nI am as good as a dead man if I am caught by the devils behind those\ntwo men downstairs.’  And then he began to plead with me to make my\nown escape.  He did not know who the man was that was posing as my\nuncle, had never seen him before until he presented himself as Henry\nLaSalle; the other man he knew as Clarke, but knew also that\n’Clarke’ was merely an assumed name.  He had fallen in with Clarke\nalmost from the time that he had begun to practise his profession,\nand at Clarke’s instigation had gone from one crooked deal to\nanother, and had made a great deal of money.  He knew that behind\nClarke was a powerful, daring, and unscrupulous band of criminals,\norganised on a gigantic scale, of which he himself was, in a sense–\na probationary sense, as he put it–a member; but he had never come\ninto direct contact with them–he had received all his orders and\ninstructions through Clarke.  He had been told by Clarke that he was\nto cultivate father following the introduction, to win father’s\nconfidence, to get as many of father’s affairs into his hands as\npossible, to reach the position, in fact, of becoming father’s\nrecognised attorney–and all this with the object, as he supposed of\nembezzling from father on a large scale.  Then father died, and\nTravers was instructed to cable my uncle.  He knew that the man who\nanswered that summons was an impostor; but he did not know, until\nthey had admitted it to him that night, that both my father and my\nuncle had been murdered, and that I, too, was to be made away with.”",
        "She looked at Jimmie Dale, and suddenly laughed out bitterly.",
        "“No; you don’t understand, even yet, the patient, ingenious deviltry\nof those fiends.  It was they, at the time the new will was drawn,\nwho offered to buy out my real uncle’s sheep ranch in that lonely,\nunsettled district in Australia, and offered him that new position\nin New Zealand.  My uncle never reached New Zealand.  He was\nmurdered on his way there.  And in his place, assuming his name,\nappeared the man who has been posing as my uncle ever since.  Do you\nbegin to see!  For five years they were patiently working out their\nplans, for five years before my father’s death that man lived and\nbecame known and accepted, and ESTABLISHED himself as Henry LaSalle.\nDo you see now why he cabled us to postpone our visit?  He ran very\nlittle risk.  The chances were one in a thousand that any of his few\nacquaintances in Australia would ever run across him in New Zealand;\nand besides, he was chosen because it seems there was a slight\nresemblance between him and the real Henry LaSalle–enough, with his\nchanged mode of living and more elaborate and pretentious\nsurroundings, to have enabled him to carry through a bluff had it\nbecome necessary.  He had all of my uncle’s papers; and the Crime\nClub furnished him with every detail of our lives here.  I forgot to\nsay, too, that from the moment my uncle was supposed to have reached\nNew Zealand all his letters were typewritten–an evidence in\nfather’s eyes that his brother had secured a position of some\nimportance; as, indeed, from apparently unprejudiced sources, they\ntook pains to assure father was a fact.  This left them with only my\nuncle’s signature to forge to the letters–not a difficult matter\nfor them!",
        "“Believing that they had Travers so deeply implicated that he could\ndo nothing, even if he had the inclination, which they had not for a\nmoment imagined, and arrogant in the belief in their own power to\nput him out of the way in any case if he proved refractory, they\nadmitted all this to him that night when he brought up the issue of\nthe real Henry LaSalle putting in an appearance sooner or later, and\nwhen they wanted him to smooth their path by releasing all documents\nwhere his power of attorney was involved.  Do you see now the part\nthey gave Travers to play?  It was to put the stamp of genuineness\nupon the false Henry LaSalle.  Not but that they were prepared with\nwhat would appear to be overwhelmingly convincing evidence to prove\nit if it were necessary; but if the man were accepted by the\nestate’s lawyer there was little chance of any one else questioning\nhis identity.”",
        "She halted again by the table–and forced a smile, as her eyes met\nJimmie Dale’s.",
        "“I am almost through, Jimmie.  That night was a terrible one for\nboth of us.  Travers’ life was not worth a moment’s purchase once\nthey found him–and mine was only under reprieve until sufficient\ntime to obviate suspicion should have elapsed after father’s death.\nWe had no proof that would stand in any court–even if we should\nhave been given the chance to adopt that course.  And without\nabsolute, irrefutable proof, it was all so cleverly woven, stretched\nover so many years, that our charge must have been held to be too\nvisionary and fantastic to have any basis in fact.",
        "“All Travers would have been able to advance was the statement that\nthe supposed Henry LaSalle had admitted being an impostor and a\nmurderer to him!  Who would believe it!  On the face of it, it\nappeared to be an absurdity.  And even granted that we were given an\nopportunity to bring the charge, they would be able to prove by a\nhundred influential and well-known men in New Zealand that the\nimpostor was really Henry LaSalle; and were we able to find any of\nmy uncle’s old acquaintances in Australia, it would be necessary to\nget them here–and not one of them would have reached America alive.",
        "“But there was not a chance, not a chance, Jimmie, of doing that–\nthey would have killed Travers the moment he showed himself in the\nopen.  The only thing we could do that night was to try and save our\nown lives; the only thing we could look forward to was acquiring in\nsome way, unknown to them, the proof, fully established, with which\nwe could crush them in a single stroke, and before they would have\ntime to strike back.",
        "“The vital thing was proof of my uncle’s death.  That, if it could\nbe obtained at all, could only be obtained in Australia.  Travers\nwas obliged to go somewhere, to disappear from that moment if he\nwanted to save his life, and he volunteered to go out there.  He\nleft the house that night by the back entrance in an old servant’s\nsuit, which I found for him–and I never heard from him again until\na month ago in the ’personal’ column of the MORNING NEWS-ARGUS,\nthrough which we had agreed to communicate.",
        "“As for myself, I left the house the next morning, telling my pseudo\nuncle that I was going to spend a few days with a friend.  And this\nI actually did; but in those few days I managed to turn all my own\nsecurities, that had been left me by my mother and which amounted to\na considerable sum, into cash.  And then, Jimmie, I came to–this, I\nhave lived like this and in different disguises, as a settlement\nworker, as a widow of means in a fashionable uptown apartment, but\nmostly as you see me now–for five years.  For five years I have\nwatched my supposed uncle, hoping, praying that through him I could\nget to know the others associated with him; hoping, praying that\nTravers would succeed; hoping, praying that we would get them all–\nand watching day after day, and year after year the ’personal’\ncolumn of the paper, until at last I began to be afraid that it was\nall useless.  And there was nothing, Jimmie, nothing anywhere, and I\nhad no success\"–her voice choked a little.  “Nothing!  Even Clarke\nnever went again to the house.  You can understand now how I came to\nknow the strange things that I wrote to the Gray Seal, how the life\nthat I have led, how this life here in the underworld, how the\nconstant search for some clew on my own account brought them to my\nknowledge; and you can understand now, too, why I never dared to let\nyou meet me, for I knew well enough that, while I worked to\nundermine my father’s and my uncle’s murderers, they were moving\nheaven and earth to find me.",
        "“That is all, Jimmie.  The day before yesterday, a month after\nTravers’ first message to let me know that he was coming, there was\nanother ’personal’ giving me an hour and a telephone number.  He was\nback!  He had everything–everything!  We dared not meet; he was\nafraid, suspicious that they had got track of him again.  You know\nthe rest.  That package contained the proof that, with Travers’\ndeath, can probably never be obtained again.  Do you understand why\nTHEY want it–why it is life and death to me?  Do you understand why\nmy supposed uncle offered huge rewards for me, why secretly every\nresource of that hideous organisation has been employed to find me–\nthat it is only by my DEATH the estate can pass into their hands,\nand now–”",
        "She flung out her hands suddenly toward Jimmie Dale.  “Oh, Jimmie,\nJimmie, I’ve–I’ve fought so long alone!  Jimmie, what are we to\ndo?”",
        "He came slowly to his feet.  She had fought so long–alone.  But\nnow–now it was his turn to fight–for her.  But how?  She had not\ntold him all–surely she had not told him all, for everything\ndepended upon that package.  There had been so much to tell that she\nhad not thought of all, and she had not told him the details about\nthat.",
        "“That box–No. 428!” he cried quickly.  “What is that?  What does it\nmean?”",
        "She shook her head.",
        "“I do not know,” she answered.",
        "“Then who is this John Johansson?”",
        "“I do not know,” she said again.",
        "“Nor where the Crime Club is?”",
        "“No\"–dully.",
        "He stared at her for a moment in a dazed way.",
        "“My God!” Jimmie Dale murmured.",
        "And then she turned away her head.",
        "“It’s–it’s pretty bad, isn’t it, Jimmie?  I–I told you that we did\nnot hold many trumps.”",
        "There was silence between them.  Minute after minute passed.\nNeither spoke.",
        "Jimmie Dale dropped back into his chair again, and stared\nabstractedly before him.  “We do not hold many trumps, Jimmie–we do\nnot hold many trumps\"–her words were repeating themselves over and\nover in his mind.  They seemed to challenge him mockingly to deny\nwhat was so obviously a fact, and because he could not deny it to\ntaunt and jeer at him–to jeer at him, when all that was held at\nstake hung literally upon his next move!",
        "He looked up mechanically as the Tocsin walked to a broken mirror at\nthe rear of the miserable room; nodded mechanically in approval as\nshe began deftly to retouch the make-up on her face where the tears\nhad left their traces–and resumed his abstracted gaze before him.",
        "Box number four-two-eight–John Johansson–the Crime Club–the\nidentity of the man who was posing as Henry LaSalle!  If only he\ncould hit upon a clew to the solution of a single one of those\nthings, or a single phase of one of them–if only he could glimpse a\nray of light that would at least prompt action, when every moment of\ninaction was multiplying the odds against them!",
        "There were the men who were watching his house at that moment on\nRiverside Drive–he, as Larry the Bat, might in turn keep watch on\nthem.  He had though of that.  In time, perhaps, he might, by so\ndoing, discover the whereabouts of the Crime Club.  In time!  It was\njust that–he had no time!  Forty-eight hours, the Tocsin insisted,\nwas all the time that he could count upon before they would become\nsuspicious of Jimmie Dale’s “illness,” before they would discover\nthat they were watching an empty house!",
        "He might–though this was even more hazardous–make an attempt to\ntrace the wires that tapped those of his telephone through the\nbasement window that gave on the garage driveway.  And what then?\nTrue, they could not lead very far away; but, even if successful,\nwhat then?  They would not lead him to the Crime Club, but simply to\nsome confederate, to some man or woman playing the part of a\nservant, perhaps, in the house next door, who, in turn, would have\nto be shadowed and watched.",
        "Jimmie Dale shook his head.  Better, of the two, to start in at once\nand shadow those who were shadowing his house.  But that was not the\nway!  He knew that intuitively.  He hated to eliminate it from\nconsideration, for he had no other move to take its place–but such\na move was almost suicide in itself.  Time, and time alone, was the\nvital factor.  They, the Tocsin and he, must act quickly–and STRIKE\nthat night if they were to win.  His fingers, the grimy fingers,\ndirty-nailed, of Larry the Bat, that none now would recognise as the\nslim tapering, wonderfully sensitive fingers of Jimmie Dale, the\nfingers that had made the name of the Gray Seal famous, whose tips\nmocked at bars and safes and locks, and seemed to embody in\nthemselves all the human senses, tightened spasmodically on the edge\nof the table.  Time!  Time!  Time!  It seemed to din in his ears.\nAnd while he sat there powerless, impotent, the Crime Club was\nmoving heaven and earth to find what HE must find–that package–if\nhe was to save this woman here, the woman whom he loved, she who had\nbeen forced, through the machinations of these hell fiends, to adopt\nthe life of a wretched hag, to exist among the dregs of the\nunderworld, whose squalour and vice and wantonness none knew better\nthan he!",
        "Jimmie Dale’s face set grimly.  Somewhere–somewhere in the past\nfive years of this life of hers in which she had been fighting the\nCrime Club, pitting that clever brain of hers against it, MUST lie a\nclew.  She had told him her story only in baldest outline, with\nscarcely a reference to her own personal acts, with barely a single\ndetail.  There must be something, something that perhaps she had\noverlooked, something, just the merest hint of something that would\nsupply a starting point, give him a glimmer of light.",
        "She came back from across the room, and sank down in her chair\nagain.  She did not speak–the question, that meant life and death\nto them both, was in her eyes.",
        "Jimmie answered the mute interrogation tersely.",
        "“Not yet!” he said.  Then, almost curtly, in a quick, incisive way,\nas the keen, alert brain began to delve and probe: “You say this man\nClarke never returned to the house after that night?”",
        "She nodded her head quietly.",
        "“You are sure of that?” he insisted.",
        "“Yes,” she said.  “I am sure.”",
        "“And you say that all these years you have kept a watch on the man\nwho is posing as your uncle, and that he never went anywhere, or\nassociated with any one, that would afford you a clew to this Crime\nClub?”",
        "“Yes,” she said again.",
        "It was a moment before Jimmie Dale spoke.",
        "“It’s very strange!” he said musingly, at last.  “So strange, in\nfact, that it’s impossible.  He must have communicated with the\nothers, and communicated with them often.  The game they were\nplaying was too big, too full of details, to admit of any other\npossibility.  And the telephone as an explanation isn’t good\nenough.”",
        "“And yet,” she said earnestly, “possible or impossible, it is\nnevertheless true.  That he might have succeeded in eluding me on\noccasions was perhaps to be expected; but that in all those years I\nshould not catch him once in what, if you are correct, must have\nbeen many and repeated conferences with the same men is too\nimprobable to be thought of seriously.”",
        "Jimmie Dale shook his head again.",
        "“If you had been able to watch him night and day, that might be so,\"\nhe said crisply.  “But, at best, you could only watch him a very\nsmall portion of the time.”",
        "She smiled at him a little wanly.",
        "“Do you think, Jimmie, from what you, as the Gray Seal, know of me,\nthat I would have watched in any haphazard way like that?”",
        "He glanced at her with a sudden start.",
        "“What do you mean?” he asked quickly.",
        "“Look at me!” she said quietly.  “Have you ever seen me before?  I\nmean as I am now.”",
        "“No,” he answered, after an instant.  “Not that I know of.”",
        "“And yet\"–she smiled wanly again–\"you have not lived, or made the\nplace you hold in the underworld, without having heard of Silver\nMag.”",
        "“You!” exclaimed Jimmie Dale.  “You–Silver Mag!”  He stared at her\nwonderingly, as, crouch-shouldered now, the hair, gray-threaded,\nstraggling out from under the hood of a faded, dark-blue, seam-worn\ncloak, she sat before him, a typical creature of the underworld, her\nrole an art in its conception, perfect in its execution.  Silver\nMag!  Yes, he had heard of Silver Mag–as every one in the Bad Lands\nhad heard of her.  Silver Mag and her pocketful of coin!  Always a\npocketful of silver, so they said, that was dispensed prodigally to\nthe wives and children temporarily deprived of support by husbands\nand fathers unfortunate enough in their clashes with the law to be\ndoing “spaces” up the river–and therefore the underworld swore by\nSilver Mag.  Always silver, never a bill; Silver Mag had never been\nseen with a banknote–that was her eccentricity.  Much or little,\nshe gave or paid out of her pocketful of jangling silver.  She was\ncredited with being a sworn enemy of the police, and–yes, he\nremembered, too–with having done “time” herself.  “I don’t quite\nunderstand,” he said, in a puzzled way.  “I haven’t run across you\npersonally because you probably took care to see that I shouldn’t;\nbut–it’s no secret–every one says you’ve served a jail sentence\nyourself.”",
        "“That is simply enough explained,” she answered gravely.  “The story\nis of my own making.  When I decided to adopt this life, both for my\nown safety and as the best means of keeping a watch on that man, I\nknew that I must win the confidence of the underworld, that I must\nhave help, and that in order to obtain that help I must have some\nexcuse for my enmity against the man known as Henry LaSalle.  To be\nwidely known in the underworld was of inestimable value–nothing, I\nknew, could accomplish that as quickly as eccentricity.  You see now\nhow and why I became known as Silver Mag.  I gained the confidence\nof every crook in New York through their wives and children.  I told\nthem the story of my jail sentence–while I swore vengeance on Henry\nLaSalle.  I told them that he had had me arrested for something I\nnever stole while I was working for him as a charwoman, and that he\nhad had me railroaded to jail.  There wasn’t one but gave me credit\nfor the theft, perhaps; but equally, there wasn’t one but\nunderstood, and my eccentricity helped this out, my wanting to ’get’\nHenry LaSalle.  Well–do you see now, Jimmie?  I had money, I had\nthe confidence of the underworld, I had an excuse for my hatred of\nHenry LaSalle, and so I had all the help I wanted.  Day and night\nthat man has been watched.  He receives no visitors–what social\nlife he has is, as you know, at the club.  There is not a house that\nhe has ever entered that, sooner or later, I have not entered after\nhim in the hope of finding the headquarters of the clique.  Even the\nmen and women, as far as human possibility could accomplish it, that\nhe has talked to on the streets have been shadowed, and their\nidentity satisfactorily established–and the net result has been\nfailure; utter, absolute, complete failure!”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes, that had held steadily on her face, shifted,\ntroubled and perplexed, to the table top.",
        "“You are wonderful!” he said, under his breath.  “Wonderful!  And–\nand that makes it all the more amazing, all the more\nincomprehensible.  It is still impossible that he has not been in\nclose and constant touch with his accomplices.  He MUST have been!\nWe would be blind fools to argue against it!  It could not, on the\nface of it, have been otherwise!”",
        "“Then how, when, where has he done it?” she asked wearily.",
        "“God knows!” he said bitterly.  “And if they have been clever enough\nto escape you all these years, I’m almost inclined to say what you\nsaid a little while ago–that we’re beaten.”",
        "She watched him miserably, as he pushed back his chair impulsively\nand, standing up, stared down at her.",
        "“We’re against it–HARD!” he said, with a mirthless laugh.  Then,\nhis lips tightening: “But we’ll try another tack–the chauffeur–\nTravers.  Though even here the Crime Club has a day’s start of us,\neven if last night they knew no more about the whereabouts of that\npackage than we know now.  I’m afraid of it!  The chances are more\nthan even that they’ve already got it.  If they were able to catch\nTravers as the chauffeur, they would have had something tangible to\nwork back from\"–Jimmie Dale was talking more to himself than to the\nTocsin now, as though he were muttering his thoughts aloud.  “How\ndid they get track of him?  When?  Where?  What has it led to?  And\nwhat in Heaven’s name,” he burst out suddenly, “is this box number\nfour-two-eight!”",
        "“A safety-deposit vault, perhaps, that he has taken somewhere,” she\nhazarded.",
        "Jimmie Dale laughed mirthlessly again.",
        "“That is the one definite thing I do know–that it isn’t!” he said\npositively.  “It is nothing of that kind.  It was half-past ten\no’clock at night when I met him, and he said that he had intended\ngoing back for the package if it had been safe to do so.  Deposit\nvaults are not open at that hour.  The package is, or was, if they\nhave not already got it, readily accessible–and at any hour.  Now\ngo over everything again, every detail that passed between you and\nTravers.  He let you know that he was back in New York by means of a\n’personal,’ you said.  What else was in that ’personal’ besides the\ntelephone number and the hour you were to call him?  Anything?”",
        "“Nothing that will help us any,” she replied colourlessly.  There\nwere simply the words ’northeast corner of Sixth Avenue and Waverly\nPlace,’ and the signature that we had agreed upon, the two first and\ntwo last letters of the alphabet transposed–BAZY.”",
        "“I see,” said Jimmie Dale quickly.  “And over the ’phone he\ncompleted his message.  Clever enough!”",
        "“Yes,” she said.  “In that way, if any one were listening, or\noverhead the plan, there could be little harm come of it, for the\nessential feature of all, the place of rendezvous, was not\nmentioned.  It has not been Travers’ fault that this happened–and\nin spite of every precaution it has cost him his life.  He wanted\nnothing to give them a clew to my whereabouts; he was trying to\nguard against the slightest evidence that would associate us one\nwith the other.  He even warned me over the ’phone not to tell him\nhow, where, or the mode of life I was living.  And naturally, he\ndared give me no particulars about himself.  I was simply to select\na third party whom I could trust, and to follow out his\ninstructions, which were those that I sent to you in my letter.”",
        "Jimmie Dale began to pace nervously up and down the room.",
        "“Nothing else?” he queried, a little blankly.",
        "“Nothing else,” she said monotonously.",
        "“But since last night, since you knew that things had gone wrong,\"\nhe persisted, “surely you traced that telephone number–the one you\ncalled up?”",
        "“Yes,” she said, and shrugged her shoulders in a tired way.\n\"Naturally I did that–but, like everything else, it amounted to\nnothing.  He telephoned from Makoff’s pawnshop on that alley off\nThompson Street, and–”",
        "“WHERE!” Jimmie Dale, suddenly stock-still, almost shouted the word.\n\"He telephoned from–where!  Say that again!”",
        "She looked at him in amazement, half rising from her chair.",
        "“Jimmie, what is it?” she cried.  “You don’t mean that–”",
        "He was beside her now, his hands pressed upon her shoulders, his\nface flushed.",
        "“Box number four-two-eight!”  He laughed out hysterically in his\nexcitement.  “John Johansson–box number four-two-eight!  And like a\nfool I never thought of it!  Don’t you see?  Don’t you know now\nyourself?  THE UNDERGROUND POST OFFICE!”",
        "She stood up, clinging to him; a wild relief, that was based on her\nconfidence in him, in her eyes and face, even while she shook her\nhead.",
        "“No,” she said frantically.  “No–I do not know.  Tell me, Jimmie!\nTell me quickly!  You mean at Makoff’s?”",
        "“No!  Not Makoff’s–at Spider Jack’s, on Thompson Street!\"–he was\nclipping off his words, still holding her tightly by the shoulders,\nstill staring into her eyes.  “You know Spider Jack!  Jack’s little\nnovelty store!  Ah, you have not learned all of the underworld yet!\nSpider Jack is the craftiest ’fence’ in the Bad Lands–and Makoff is\nhis partner.  Spider buys the crooks’ stuff, and Makoff disposes of\nit through the pawnshop–it’s only a step through the connecting\nback yard from one to the other, and–”",
        "“Yes–but,” she interrupted feverishly, “the package–you said–”",
        "“Wait!” Jimmie Dale cried.  “I’m coming to that!  If Travers stood\nin with Makoff, he stood in with Spider Jack.  For years Spider has\nbeen a sort of clearing house for the underworld–for years he has\nconducted, and profitably, too, his underground post office.  Crooks\nfrom all over the country, let alone those in New York, communicate\nwith each other through Spider Jack.  These, for a fee, are\nregistered at Spider’s, and given a number–a box number he calls\nit, though, of course, there are no actual boxes.  Letters come by\nmail addressed to him–the sealed envelope within containing the\nactually intended recipient’s name.  These Spider either forwards,\nor delivers in person when they are called for.  Dozens of crooks,\ntoo, unwilling, perhaps, to dispose of small ill-gotten articles at\nruinous ’fence’ prices, and finding it unhealthy for the moment to\nkeep them in their possession, use this means of depositing them\ntemporarily for safe-keeping.  You see now, don’t you?  It’s certain\nthat’s where Travers left the package.  He used the name of John\nJohansson, not to hoodwink Spider Jack, I should say, but as an\nadded safeguard against the Crime Club.  Travers must have known\nboth Makoff and Spider Jack in the old days, and probably had\nreason, and good reason, to trust them both–possibly, a crook then\nhimself, as he confessed, he may have acted in a legal capacity for\nthem in their frequent tangles with the police.”",
        "“Then,” she said–and there was a glad, new note in her voice,\n\"then, Jimmie–Jimmie, we are safe!  You can get it, Jimmie!  It is\nonly a little thing for the Gray Seal to do–to get it now that we\nknow where it is.”",
        "“Yes,” he said tersely.  “Yes–if it is still there.”",
        "“Still there!\"–she repeated the words quickly, nervously.  “Still\nthere!  What do you mean?”",
        "“I mean if they, too, have not discovered that he was at Makoff’s–\nif they have not got there first!” he said grimly.  “There seems to\nbe no limit to their cleverness, or their power.  They penetrated\nhis disguise as a chauffeur, and who knows what more they have\nlearned since last night?  We are fighting them in the dark, and–\nWHAT’S THAT!” he whispered tensely, suddenly–and leaning forward\nlike a flash, as he whipped his automatic from his pocket, he blew\nout the lamp.",
        "The room was in darkness.  They stood there rigid, silent,\nlistening.  Her hand found and caught his arm.",
        "And then it came again–a low sound, the sound of a stealthy\nfootstep just outside the window that faced on the storage yard.",
        "A minute passed–another.  The automatic at Jimmie Dale’s hip, the\nmuzzle just peeping over the table top, held a steady bead on the\nwindow.  Came the footstep again–and then suddenly, a series of\nlow, quick tappings upon the windowpane.  The Tocsin’s hand slipped\naway from his arm.  Jimmie Dale’s set face relaxed as he read the\nunderground Morse, and he replaced his revolver slowly in his\npocket.",
        "“The Magpie!” said Jimmie Dale, in an undertone.  “What’s he want?”",
        "“I don’t know,” she answered, in a whisper.  “He never came here\nbefore.  There’s a back way out, Jimmie, if you–”",
        "“No,” he said quickly.  “We’ve enemies enough, with out making one\nof the Magpie.  He knows some one is here with you–our shadows were\non the blind.  Don’t queer yourself.  Let him in.  I’ll light the\nlamp.”",
        "He struck a match, as she ran from the room, and, lifting the hot\nlamp chimney with the edge of his ragged coat, lighted the lamp.  He\nturned the wick down a little, shading and dimming the room–and\nthen, as he flirted a bead of moisture from his forehead,\nwhimsically stretched out his hand to watch it in the lamplight.",
        "“That’s bad, Jimmie,” he muttered gravely to himself, as he noted an\nalmost imperceptible tremour.  “Got a start, didn’t you!  Under a\nbit of a strain, eh?  Well\"–grimly–\"never mind!  It looks as though\nthe luck had turned Makoff and Spider Jack!”",
        "His hand reached up to his hat, jerked the brim at a rakish angle\nover his eyes–and he sprawled himself out on a chair.  He heard the\nTocsin’s voice at the front door, and a man’s voice, low and\nguarded, answer her.  Then the door closed, and their steps\napproached the room.  It was rather curious, that–a visit from the\nMagpie!  What could the Magpie want?  What could there be in common\nbetween the Magpie and Silver Mag?  The Magpie, alias Slimmy Joe,\nwas counted the cleverest safe worker in the United States, barring\nonly and always one–a smile flickered across the lips of Larry the\nBat–one whose pre-eminence the Magpie, much to his own chagrin,\nadmitted himself–the Gray Seal!",
        "He looked up, twisting the stub of a cigarette between his grimy\nfingers and fumbling for a match, as the Tocsin and, behind her, the\nMagpie, short, slim, and wiry, shrewd-faced, with sharp, quick-\nglancing little black eyes, entered the room.",
        "“’Ello, Larry!” grinned the Magpie.  “Got yer breath back yet?  I\nfelt it through de windowpane when youse let go at de lamp!”",
        "“’Ello, Slimmy!” returned Jimmie Dale ungraciously, speaking through\nthe corner of his mouth.  “Ferget it!”",
        "“Sure!” said the Magpie unconcernedly.  He stared about him, and\nfinally, drawing a chair up to the table, sat down, motioned the\nTocsin to do the same, and leaned forward amiably.  “I didn’t mean\nto throw no scare into youse,” he said, in a conciliating tone.\n\"But I had a little business wid Mag, an’ I was kind of interested\nin whether she was entertainin’ company or not–see?  I didn’t know\nyouse an’ Mag was workin’ together.”",
        "“Mabbe,” observed Jimmie Dale, as ungraciously as before, “mabbe\ndere’s some more t’ings youse don’t know!”",
        "“Aw, cough up de grouch!” advised the Magpie, with a hint of\nimpatience creeping into his voice.  “Youse don’t need to be sore\nall night!  I told youse I wasn’t tryin’ to hand youse one, didn’t\nI?”",
        "“Never mind Larry, Slimmy,” put in the Tocsin petulantly.  “He’s\ndown on his luck, dat’s all.  He ain’t had de price of a pinch of\ncoke fer two days.”",
        "“Oho!” exclaimed the Magpie, grinning again.  “So dat’s wot’s givin’\nyouse de pip, eh, Larry?  Well, den, say, youse can take it from me\ndat mabbe youse’ll be glad I blew around.  I was lookin’ fer a guy\nabout yer size fer a little job to-night, an’ I was t’inkin’ of\nlettin’ Young Dutchy in on it, but seem’ youse are here an’ in wid\nMag, an’ dat I got to get Mag in, too, youse are on if youse say de\nword.”",
        "“Wot’s de lay?” inquired Larry the Bat, unbending a little.",
        "The Magpie cocked his eye, and stuck his tongue in his cheek.",
        "“GOOD-night!” he said tersely.  “Nothin’ like dat!  Are youse on, or\nain’t youse?”",
        "“Well, den, wot’s in it fer me?” persisted Larrry the Bat.",
        "“More’n de price of a coke sneeze!” returned the Magpie pertinently.\n\"Dere’s a century note fer youse, an’ mabbe two or t’ree of dem fer\nMag.”",
        "Larry the Bat’s eyes gleamed avariciously.",
        "“Aw, quit yer kiddin’!” he said gruffly.  “A century note–fer me!”",
        "“Dat’s wot I said!  Youse heard me!” rejoined the Magpie shortly.\n\"Only if it listens good to youse now, I don’t want no squealin’\nafter the divvy.  I’m takin’ de chances, youse has de soft end of\nit.  One century note fer youse–an’ de rest is none of yer\nbusiness!  Dat’s puttin’ it straight, ain’t it?  Well, wot do youse\nsay, an’ say it quick–’cause if youse ain’t comin’ in, youse can\nbeat it out of here so’s I can talk to Mag.”",
        "“Dere ain’t nothin’ I wouldn’t take a chance on fer a hundred\nplunks!” declared Larry the Bat, with sudden fervency–and stared,\nanxiously expectant, at the Magpie.  “Sure, I’m on Slimmy!  Sure, I\nam!  Cut it loose!  Spill de story!”",
        "“Well, den,” said the Magpie, “I wants–”",
        "“Youse ain’t through yet!” interrupted the Tocsin tartly.  “I ain’t\nheard youse askin’ me nothin’!  I ain’t on me uppers like Larry, an’\nmabbe de price don’t cut so much ice–see?”",
        "“Aw,” said the Magpie, with a smirk, “I don’t have to ask youse on\ndis lay.  Dis is where youse’d come in on it fer marbles.  Say, dis\nis where we gets de hook into a guy by de name of Henry LaSalle!\nGet me?”",
        "HENRY LASALLE!  Under the table, Jimmie Dale’s hand clenched\nsuddenly; but not a muscle of his face moved, save, as with the tip\nof his tongue, he shifted the butt of the cigarette that was hanging\nroyally from his lower lip to the other corner of his mouth.",
        "“Sure!  She’s ’got’ youse, Slimmy!” he flung out, with a grin, as\nthe Tocsin wrinkled up her face menacingly and began to mumble to\nherself.  “He’s de guy dat handed her one when she was young, an’\nshe’s been layin’ fer him ever since!  Sure!  I know!  Ain’t I\nworked him fer her till I wears me shoes out tryin’ to get somet’ing\non him!  Sure, she’s in on it!  Go on, Slimmy, wot’s de lay?  Wot do\nI do fer dat century?”",
        "The Magpie hitched his chair closer to the table and, as his sharp,\nlittle, ferret eyes glanced around the room, motioned the two to\nbrings their heads nearer.",
        "“One of me influential broker friends down on Wall Street put me\nwise,” he said, with a wink.  “Dat’s good enough fer youse two, as\nfar as dat goes.  But take it from me, I got it dead straight.”  He\nlowered his voice “Say, he’s one of de richest mugs in New York,\nain’t he?  Well, he’s been sellin’ stocks an’ bonds all day,\nt’ousands an’ t’ousands of dollars’ worth–fer cash.”",
        "“All dem t’ings is always sold fer cash,” remarked Larry the Bat\nfatuously.",
        "“Aw, ferget it!” said the Magpie earnestly.  “Fer CASH, I said–de\ncoin, de long green–understand?  He wasn’t shovin’ no checks fer\nwhat he sold into de bank except to get dem cashed.  Dat’s wot he’s\nbeen doin’ all day–gettin’ de checks cashed, an’ gettin’ de money\nin big bills–see!  I know of one bunch of eighty t’ousand–an’\ndat’s only one!”",
        "“Wot fer?” inquired Larry the Bat.  It was the question that was\npounding at his brain, as he stared innocently at the Magpie.  What\ndid it mean?  Why was Henry LaSalle turning, and, if the Magpie was\nright, feverishly turning every security he could lay his hands on\ninto cash?  And then, in a flash, the answer came.  THEY HAD NOT\nFOUND THE PACKAGE!  Equally to them, as to the Tocsin, sitting there\nbefore him, it meant life and death.  If the package were found by\nthe Tocsin instead of themselves, the game was up!  They were\npreparing for eventualities.  If they were forced to run at a\nmoment’s notice, they at least were not going to run empty-handed!\nFar from empty-handed, it seemed!  It would not be difficult for the\nestate’s executor to realise a vast sum in short order on instantly\nmarketable, gilt-edged securities–say, half a million dollars.  Not\nvery bulky, either–in large bills!  Five thousand hundred-dollar\nbills would make half a million.  It was astonishing how small a\nhand bag, say, might hold a fortune!  “Wot fer, Slimmy?” he inquired\nagain, wiggling his cigarette butt on his tongue tip.  “Wot’d he do\ndat fer?”",
        "“How de hell do youse suppose I knows!” demanded the Magpie,\npolitely scornful.  “Dat’s his business–dat ain’t wot’s worryin’\nme!”",
        "“No–sure, it ain’t!” admitted Larry the Bat ingratiatingly.  “But\ngo on, keep movin’, Slimmy!  Wot’s he done wid de stuff?”",
        "“Done wid it!” echoed the Magpie, with a short laugh.  “Wot do youse\nt’ink!  He’s been luggin’ it home to his swell joint up dere on de\navenoo, an’ crammin’ his safe full of it.”",
        "Larry the Bat sucked in his breath.",
        "“Gee, dat’s soft!” he murmured, and then suddenly, as though with\npainful inspiration: “Say, Slimmy–say, are youse sure youse ain’t\nbeen handed a steer?”",
        "The Magpie grinned wickedly.",
        "“I ain’t fallin’ fer steers!” he said shortly.  “Dis is on de\nlevel.”",
        "Jimmie Dale lurched up from his chair, and, leaning over the lamp\nchimney, drew wheezily on his cigarette to get a light.  His eyes\nsought the Tocsin’s face.  To all intents and purposes she was\nentirely absorbed in the Magpie.  He sat down again to gape, with\nwell-stimulated, doglike admiration, at Slimmy Joe.  WAS THIS, TOO,\nA PLANT?  Why had the Magpie come to THEM with this story of Henry\nLaSalle?  And then, the next instant, as the Magpie spoke, his\nsuspicions were allayed.",
        "“Let’s get down to cases!” the Magpie invited crisply.  “I didn’t\nblow in here just by luck.  Dis Henry LaSalle is de guy youse worked\nfer once, ain’t he, Mag?  Dat’s de spiel, ain’t it?–he sent youse\nup fer pinchin’ de tacks out of his carpets!”",
        "“I never pinched nothin’!” snarled Silver Mag truculently.  “He’s a\ndirty liar!  I never did!”",
        "“Cut it out!  Cut it out!  Can dat!” complained the Magpie\npatiently.  “De point is, youse worked in his house, didn’t youse?”",
        "“Sure I did!” snapped the Tocsin, sullenly aggressive; “but–”",
        "“Well, den, dat’s wot I want, dat’s wot I come fer, Mag–a plan of\nde house.  See?”",
        "Jimmie Dale could feel the Tocsin’s eyes upon him, questioning,\nsearching, seeking a cue.  A plan of the house–yes or no?  And a\ndecision on the instant!",
        "“Sure!” said Larry the Bat brightly.  “Dat’s wot I was t’inkin’\nyouse were after all de time.  Say, youse are all right, Slimmy!\nYouse are de kind to work wid!  Go on, Mag, draw de dope fer Slimmy.\nDat’s better dan tryin’ to put one over on de swell guy.  Dis’ll\nmake him squeal fer fair!”",
        "The Magpie produced a pencil and a piece of paper from his pocket,\nand laid them on the table in front of the Tocsin.",
        "“Dere youse are,” he announced.  “Help yerself, an’ go to it, Mag!”",
        "The Tocsin, evidently not quite certain of her part, wet the pencil\ndoubtfully on the end of her tongue.",
        "“I ain’t never drawed plans,” she said anxiously.  “Mabbe\"–she\nglanced at Jimmie Dale–\"mabbe I dunno how to do it RIGHT.”",
        "“Aw, go ahead!” nodded Larry the Bat.  “Youse can do it right, Mag.\nYouse don’t have to make no oil paintin’!  All de Magpie wants is de\ndoors an’ windows, eh, Slimmy?”",
        "“Sure,” agreed the Magpie encouragingly.  “Dat’s all, Mag.  Just\nmark de rooms out on de first floor, an’ de basement.  Youse can\nexplain wot youse ’re doin’ as youse goes along.  I’ll get youse.”",
        "The Tocsin cackled maliciously in assent; and then, while the Magpie\ngot up from his chair and stood peering over her shoulder, she began\nto draw labouriously, her brows knitted, the pencil hooked awkwardly\nbetween cramped-up forefinger and thumb.",
        "Larry the Bat, slouched forward over the table, his chin in his\nhands, appeared to watch the proceedings with mild interest–but his\neyes, like a hawk’s, were following every line on the paper,\ntransferring them to his brain, photographing every detail of the\nplan in his mind.  And as he watched, there seemed something that\nwas near to the acme of all that was ironical in the Magpie standing\nthere, his sharp, little, black eyes drinking in greedily the\nTocsin’s work, in the Tocsin herself aiding and abetting in the\nprojected theft–OF HER OWN MONEY!  How far would he let the Magpie\ngo?  He did not know.  Perhaps–who could tell!–all the way.\nBetween now and then there lay that package!  If it were at\nMakoff’s, at Spider Jack’s, if he could find it, get it–the Magpie\nas a temporary custodian of the estate’s money would at least\npreclude its loss by flight if the Crime Club took alarm too\nquickly.  Larry the Bat’s eyes, under half-closed lids, rested\nmusingly on the Magpie’s face.  The Magpie would not get very far\naway with it!  On the other hand, if he failed at Spider Jack’s, if,\nafter all, he was wrong, and the package had never been there, or if\nthey had forestalled him, turned the trick upon him, already secured\nit, then–Larry the Bat’s lips, working on his cigarette, formed in\na twisted smile–then, well then, that was quite another matter!\nPerhaps he and the Magpie might not agree so far!  A half million\ndollars was perhaps not much out of eleven millions, but it was a\nsalvage not to be despised!  Why did he say half a million!  Well,\nwhy not?  If the Magpie knew of a single transaction of eighty\nthousand, and there had been many transactions during the day, a\nhalf million was little likely to prove an exaggeration–and the\nless likely in view of the fact that, if those in the Crime Club\nwere preparing for an emergency, they would not stint themselves in\nthe disposal of securities.",
        "The Magpie was keeping up a running fire of questions, as the Tocsin\ntoiled on with her pencil.  Where did the hall lead to?  How many\nwindows in the library?  Did she remember the kind of fastenings?\nDid the servants sleep in the basement, or above?  And finally,\ntwice over, as she finished the clumsy drawing and pushed it toward\nhim, he demanded minute details of the position of the safe.",
        "“Aw, dat’s all right, Slimmy!” Larry the Bat cut in airily.  “If\nyouse ferget anyt’ing when youse get in dere, youse can ask me.  I\ngot it cinched!”",
        "The Magpie folded the paper and stowed it carefully away in his\npocket.",
        "“Ask youse, eh!” he grunted sarcastically.  “An’ where do youse\nt’ink youse’ll be about dat time?”",
        "“In dere wid youse, of course,” replied Larry the Bat promptly.\n\"Dat’s wot youse said.”",
        "“Yes, youse will–NOT!” announced the Magpie, with cold finality.\n\"Do youse t’ink I want to queer myself!  A hot one youse’d be on an\ninside job!  Youse’ll be OUTSIDE, wid yer peepers skinned for de\nbulls–youse an’ Mag here, too.  See!  Get dat straight.  While I’m\non de job youse two plays de game.  Now youse listen to me, both of\nyouse.  Don’t start nothin’ unless youse has to.  If it’s a cinch I\ngot to make a get-away, youse two start a drunk fight.  Get me?\nYouse know de lay.  T’row de talk loud–an’ I’ll fade.  Dat’s all!\nWe’ll crack de crib early–it’ll be quiet enough up dere by one\no’clock”",
        "One o’clock!  Larry the Bat shook his head.  What time was it now?\nIt was about nine when he had first met the Tocsin, then the\nSanctuary, then the long walk as he had followed her–say a quarter\nof ten for that.  And he had certainly been here with her not less\nthan an hour and a half.  It must be after eleven, then.  One\no’clock!  And before that must come Makoff and Spider Jack!  The\nnight that half an hour ago had seemed so sterile, was crowding a\nprogram of events upon him now–too fast!",
        "“Nothin’ doin’!” he said thoughtfully.  “Youse are in wrong dere,\nSlimmy.  One o’clock don’t go!  Say, take it from me, I’ve watched\ndat guy too many nights fer Mag.  ’Tain’t often he leaves de club\nbefore one o’clock–an’ he ain’t never in bed before two.”",
        "“All right,” agreed the Magpie, after a moment’s reflection.  “Youse\nought to know.  Make it three o’clock.”  He pulled a cigar from his\npocket, lighted it, and, leaning back in his chair, stuck his feet\nup on the table.  “If youse don’t mind, Mag, I’ll stick around a\nwhile,” he decided calmly.  “Mabbe de less I’m seen to-night de\nbetter–an’ I guess dere won’t be nobody lookin’ fer me here.”",
        "Larry the Bat coughed suddenly, and rose up a little heavily from\nhis chair.  He had not counted on that!  If the Magpie was settling\ndown for a prolonged stay, it devolved upon him, Jimmie Dale, to get\naway, and at once–and without exciting the Magpie’s suspicions.  He\ncoughed again, looked nervously from the Tocsin to the Magpie–\nstammered–swallowed hard–and coughed once more.",
        "“Well, wot’s bitin’ youse?” inquired the Magpie ironically.",
        "“Nothin’,” said Larry the Bat–and hesitated.  “Nothin’, only–”  He\nhesitated again; and then, the words in a rush:",
        "“Say, Slimmy, couldn’t youse come across wid a piece of dat century\nnow?”",
        "“Wot fer?” demanded the Magpie, a little aggressively.",
        "Larry the Bat cleared his throat with a desperate effort.",
        "“Youse knows,” he admitted sheepishly.  “Just gimme de price of one,\nSlimmy–just one.”",
        "“Coke!” exploded the Magpie.  “An’ get soaked to de eyes–not by a\ndamn sight!”",
        "“No!  Honest to Gawd, no, Slimmy–just one!” pleaded Larry the Bat.",
        "“Nix!” said the Magpie shortly.",
        "Larry the Bat thrust out a hand before the Magpie’s eyes that shook\ntremulously.",
        "“I got to have it!” he declared, with sudden fierceness.  “I GOT to–\nsee!  Look at me!  I ain’t goin’ to be no good to-night if I don’t.\nI tell youse, I got to!  I ain’t goin’ to t’row youse down, Slimmy–\nhonest, I ain’t!  Just one–an’ it’ll set me up.  If I don’t get\nnone I’ll be on de rocks before mornin’!  Dat’s straight, Slimmy–\nask Mag, she knows.”",
        "“Aw, let him go get it!” broke in the Tocsin wearily.  “Dat’s de\nbest t’ing youse can do, Slimmy–dey’re all alike when dey gets in\nhis class.”",
        "“Youse cocaine sniffers gives me de pip!” snorted the Magpie, in\ndisgust.  He dug down into his pocket, produced a bill, and flung it\nacross the table to Larry the Bat.  “Well, dere youse are; but youse\ncan take it from me, Larry, dat if youse gets whiffed\"–he swore\nthreateningly–\"I’ll crack every bone in yer face!  Get me?”",
        "“Slimmy,” said Larry the Bat fervently, grabbing at the bill with a\nhungry hand, “youse can count on me.  I’ll be up dere on de job\nbefore youse are.  Three o’clock, eh?  Well, so long, Slimmy\"–he\nslouched eagerly to the door.  “So long, Mag\"–he paused on the\nthreshold for a single, quick-flung, significant glance.  “See youse\non de avenoo, Mag–I’ll be up dere before youse are.  So long!”",
        "“Oh, so long!” said the Tocsin contemptuously.",
        "And, an instant later, Jimmie Dale closed the outer door behind him.",
        "Nearly midnight already!  It was even later than he had thought.\nLarry the Bat pressed his face against a shop’s windowpane on the\nBowery for a glance at a clock that had caught his eye on the wall\nwithin.  Nearly midnight!",
        "He slouched on again hurriedly, still debating in his mind, as he\nhad been debating it all the way from the Tocsin’s, the question of\nreturning again to the Sanctuary.  So far, the way both to Spider\nJack’s and the Sanctuary had been in the same direction–but the\nSanctuary was on the next street.",
        "Jimmie Dale reached the corner–and hesitated.  It was strange how\nstrong was the intuition upon him to-night that bade him go on and\nmake all speed to Spider Jack’s–while equally strong was the cold,\nstubborn logic that bade him go first to the Sanctuary.  There were\nthings that he needed there that would probably be absolutely\nessential to him before the night was out, things without which he\nmight be so badly handicapped as to invite failure from the start;\nand yet–it was already midnight!",
        "Ostensibly both Makoff and Spider Jack closed their places at\neleven.  But that might mean anything–depending upon their own\nrespective inclinations, or on what of their own peculiar brand of\ndeviltry might be afoot.  If they were still about, still in\nevidence, he was still too early, midnight though it was; though, on\nthe other hand, if the coast was clear, he could ill afford to lose\na moment of the time between now and the hour that the Magpie had\nplanned for the robbery of Henry LaSalle, for it would not be an\neasy matter, even once inside Spider Jack’s, to find that package–\nsince it was Spider’s open boast that things committed to his care\nwere where the police, or any one else, might as well whistle and\nsuck their thumbs as try to find them!",
        "And then, with sudden decision, taking his hesitation, as it were,\nby the throat, Jimmie Dale hurried on again–to the Sanctuary.  At\nmost, it could delay him but another fifteen minutes, and by half-\npast twelve, or a quarter to one at the latest, he would be at\nSpider Jack’s.",
        "Disdaining the secrecy of the side door on the alley, for who had a\nbetter right or was better known there than Larry the Bat, a tenant\nof years, he entered the tenement by the front door, scuffled up the\nstairs to the first landing, and let himself into his disreputable\nroom.  He locked the door behind him, lighted the choked and wheezy\ngas jet, in a single, sharp-flung glance assured himself that the\nblinds were tightly shut, and, kneeling in the far corner, threw\nback the oilcloth and lifted up the loose section of the flooring\nbeneath.  He reached inside, fumbling under the neatly folded\nclothes of Jimmie Dale, and in a moment laid his leather girdle with\nits kit of burglar’s tools on the floor beside him; and beside that\nagain an electric flashlight, a black silk mask, and–what he had\nnever expected to use again when, early the night before, he had, as\nhe had believed, put it away forever–the thin, metal insignia case\nof the Gray Seal.  Another moment, and, with the flooring replaced,\nthe oilcloth rolled back into position, he had stripped off his coat\nand was pulling his spotted, greasy shirt off over his head; then,\nstooping quickly, he picked up the girdle, put it on, put on his\nshirt again over it, put on his coat, put the metal case, the\nflashlight, and the mask in his pockets–and once more the Sanctuary\nwas in darkness.",
        "It was perhaps fifteen minutes later that Jimmie Dale turned into\nthe upper section of Thompson Street.  Here he slowed his pace, that\nhad been almost a run since he had left the Sanctuary, and began to\nshuffle leisurely along; for the street, that a few hours before\nwould have been choked with its pushcarts and venders, its half\nnaked children playing where they could find room in the gutters,\nits sidewalks thronged with shawled women and picturesquely dressed,\nearringed, dark-visaged men, a scene, as it were, transported from\nsome foreign land, was still far from deserted; the quiet, if quiet\nit could be called, was but comparative, there were many yet about,\nand he had no desire to attract attention by any evidence of undue\nhaste.  And, besides, Spider Jack’s was just ahead, making the\ncorner of the alleyway a few hundred feet farther on, and he had\nvery good reasons for desiring to approach Spider’s little novelty\nstore at a pace that would afford him every opportunity for\nobservation.",
        "On he shuffled along the street, until, reaching Spider Jack’s, a\nlittle two-storied, tumble-down brick structure, a muttered\nexclamation of satisfaction escaped him.  The shop was closed and\ndark; and, though Spider Jack lived above the store, there were no\nlights even in the upper windows.  Spider Jack presumably was either\nout, or in bed!  So far, then, he could have asked for nothing more.",
        "Jimmie Dale edged in close to the building as he slouched by, so\nclose that his hat brim seemed to touch the windowpane.  It was\npossible that from a room at the rear of the store there might be a\nlight with a telltale ray perhaps filtering through, say, a door\ncrack.  But there was nothing–only blackness within.",
        "He paused at the corner of the building by the alleyway.  Down here,\nadjoining the high board fence of Spider Jack’s back yard, Makoff\nmade pretense at pawnbrokering in a small and dingy wooden building,\nthat was little more pretentious than a shed–and in Makoff’s place,\nso far as he could see, there was no light, either.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s fingers were industriously rolling a cigarette, as,\nunder the brim of his slouch hat, his eyes were noting every detail\naround him.  A yard in against the wall of Spider Jack’s, the wall\ncutting off the rays of the street lamp at a sharp angle, it was\nshadowy and black–and beyond that, farther in, the alleyway was\nlike a pit.  It would take less, far less, than the fraction of a\nsecond to gain that yard, but some one was approaching behind him,\nand a little group of people loitered, with annoying persistency,\ndirectly across the way on the other side of the street.  Jimmie\nDale stuck the cigarette between his lips, fumbled in his pockets,\nand finally produced a box of matches.  The group opposite was\nmoving on now; the footsteps he had heard behind him, those of a\nman, drew nearer, the man passed by–and the box of matches in\nJimmie Dale’s hand dropped to the ground.  He reached to pick them\nup, and in his stooping posture, without seeming to turn his head,\nflung a quick glance behind him up the street.  No one, for that\nfraction of a second that he needed, was near enough to see–and in\nthat fraction of a second Jimmie Dale disappeared.",
        "A dozen yards down the lane, he sprang for the top of the high\nfence, gripped it, and, lithe and active as a cat, swung himself up\nand over, and dropped noiselessly to the ground on the other side.\nHere he stood motionless for a moment, close against the fence, to\nget his bearings.  The rear of Spider Jack’s building loomed up\nbefore him–the back windows as unlighted as those in front.  Luck\nso far, at least, was with him!  He turned and looked about him,\nand, his eyes growing accustomed to the darkness, he could just make\nout Makoff’s place, bordering the end of the yard–nor, from this\nnew vantage point, could he discover, any more than before, a single\nsign of life about the pawnbroker’s establishment.",
        "Jimmie Dale stole forward across the yard, mounted the three steps\nof the low stoop at Spider Jack’s back door, and tried the door\ncautiously.  It was locked.  From his pocket came the small steel\ninstrument that had stood Larry the Bat in good stead a hundred\ntimes before in similar circumstances.  He inserted it in the\nkeyhole, worked deftly with it for an instant–and tried the door\nagain.  It was still locked.  And then Jimmie Dale smiled almost\napologetically.  Spider Jack did not use ordinary locks on his back\ndoor!",
        "The discountenanced instrument went back into his pocket, and now\nJimmie Dale’s hand slipped inside his shirt, and from one of the\nlittle, upright pockets of the leather belt, and from still another,\nand from after that a third, came the vicious little blued-steel\ntools.  The sensitive fingers travelled slowly up and down the side\nof the door–and then he was at work in earnest.  A minute passed–\nanother–there was a dull, low, grating sound, a snick as of metal\nyielding suddenly–and Jimmie Dale was coolly stowing away his tools\nagain inside his shirt.",
        "He pushed the door open an inch, listened, then swung it wide,\nstepped inside, and closed it behind him.  A round, white beam of\nlight flashed in a quick circle–and went out.  It was a sort of\nstoreroom, innocent enough and orderly enough in appearance, bare-\nfloored, with boxes and packing cases piled neatly against the\nwalls.  In one corner a staircase led to the story above–and from\nabove, quite audibly now, he caught the sound of snoring.  Spider\nJack was in bed, then!",
        "Directly facing him was the open door of another room, and Jimmie\nDale, moving softly forward, entered it.  He had never been in\nSpider Jack’s before, and his first concern was to form an intimate\nacquaintanceship with his surroundings.  Again the flashlight\ncircled, and again went out.",
        "“No windows!” muttered Jimmie Dale under his breath.  “Nothing very\nfancy about the architecture!  Three rooms in a row!  Store in front\nof this room through that door of course.  Wonder if the door’s\nlocked, though it’s a foregone conclusion the package wouldn’t be in\nthere.”",
        "Not a sound, his tread silent, he crossed to the closed door that he\nhad noticed.  It was unlocked, and he opened it tentatively a little\nway.  A faint glow of light diffused itself through the opening.\nJimmie Dale nodded his head and closed the door again.  The street\nlamp, shining through the shop windows, accounted for the light.",
        "And now the flashlight played with steady inquisitiveness about him.\nThe room in which he stood seemed to combine a sort of office, with\na lounging room, in which Spider Jack, no doubt, entertained his\nparticular cronies.  There was table in the centre, cards still upon\nit, chairs about it.  Against the wall farthest away from the shop\nstood a huge, old-fashioned cabinet; and a little farther along,\nanglewise, partitioning off the corner, as it were, hung, for some\npurpose or other, a cretonne curtain.  Also, against the wall next\nto the lane, bringing a commiserating smile to Jimmie Dale’s lips as\nhis eyes fell upon it, was a clumsy, lumbering, antique safe.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes returned to the curtain.  What was it doing\nthere?  What was it for?  Instinctively he stepped over to examine\nit.  A single glance, however, as he lifted it aside, sufficed.  It\nwas nothing but a make-shift clothes closet.  He turned from it,\nswitched off the flashlight, and stood staring meditatively into the\ndarkness.  In a strange house, with the knowledge to begin with that\nwhat he sought was carefully hidden, it was no sinecure to find that\npackage.  He had never for a moment imagined that it would be.  But\nof one thing, however, there was no uncertainty in his mind–he\nwould get the package!–by search if possible, by other means if\nsearch failed.  It was now close to one o’clock.  If by two o’clock\nhis efforts had been fruitless, Spider Jack would hand over the\npackage–at the revolver point!  It was quite simple!  Meanwhile–\nJimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders, and, going over to the safe,\nknelt down in front of it–meanwhile, as well begin here as anywhere\nelse.",
        "The trained fingers closed on the handle–and on the instant, as\nthough in startled amazement, shifted to the dial.  They came back\nto the handle–a wrench–then a low, amused chuckle–and the door\nswung open.  The great, unwieldy thing was only a monumental bluff!\nIt not only had not been locked, but it COULD NOT be locked–the\nmechanism was out of order, the bolts could not be moved by so much\nas a hair’s breadth!",
        "Still chuckling, Jimmie Dale shot the flashlight’s ray into the\ninterior of the safe–and the chuckle died on his lips, and into his\nface came a look of strained bewilderment.  Inside, everything was\nin chaos, books, papers, a miscellany of articles, as though they\nhad first been ruthlessly pulled out on the floor, then gathered up\nin an armful and crammed back inside again.  For an instant he did\nnot move, and then a queer, hard, mirthless smile drew down the\ncorners of his mouth.  With a sort of bitter, expectant nod of his\nhead, he turned the light upon the door of the safe.  Yes, there\nwere the scratches that the tools had left; and, as though in\nsardonic jest, the holes, where the steel bit had bored, were\nplugged with putty and rubbed over with some black substance that\nwas still wet and came off, smearing his finger, as he touched it.\nIt could not have been done long ago, then!  How long?  A half hour–\nan hour?  Not more than that!",
        "Mechanically he closed the door of the safe, rose to his feet and,\nalmost heedless of noise now, the flashlight ray dancing before him,\nhe jumped across to the old-fashioned cabinet and pulled the door\nopen.  Here, as within the safe, all inside, plain evidence of\nthorough, if hasty, search, was scattered and tossed about in\nhopeless confusion.",
        "He shut the cabinet door; the flashlight went out; and he stood like\na man stunned, the sense of some abysmal disaster upon him.  He was\ntoo late!  The game was up!  If it had ever been here, the package\nwas gone now–GONE!  The Crime Club had been here before him!",
        "“The game was up!  The game was up!\"–his mind seemed to keep on\nrepeating that.  The Crime Club had beaten him by an hour, at most,\nand had been here, and had searched.  It was strange, though, that\nthey should have been at such curious pains to cover their tracks by\nleaving the room in order, by such paltry efforts to make the safe\nappear untouched when the first glance that was at all critical\nwould disclose immediately what had been done!  Why should they need\nto cover their tracks at all; or, if it was necessary, why, above\nall, in such a pitifully inadequate way!  His mind barked back to\nthe same ghastly refrain–\"the game was up!”",
        "NO!  Not yet!  There was still a chance!  There was still Spider\nJack!  Suppose, in spite of their search, they had failed to find\nthe package!  Jimmie Dale’s lips set in a thin line, as he started\nabruptly toward the door.  There was still that chance, and one\nthing was grimly certain–Spider Jack would, at least, show him\nwhere the package HAD BEEN!",
        "And then, halfway to the door, he halted suddenly, and stood still–\nlistening.  An electric bell was ringing loudly, imperiously,\nsomewhere upstairs.  Followed almost immediately the sound of some\none, Spider Jack presumably, moving hurriedly about overhead; and\nthen, a moment later, steps coming down the staircase in the\nadjoining room.",
        "Jimmie Dale drew back, flattening himself against the wall.  Spider\nJack entered the room, stumbled across it, in the darkness, fumbled\nfor the door that led into his little shop, opened it, passed\nthrough, fumbled around in there again, for matches evidently, then\nlighted a gas jet in the store, and, going to the street door,\nopened it.",
        "Jimmie Dale had edged along the wall a little to a position where he\nhad an unobstructed view through the open doorway connecting the\nshop and the room in which he stood.  Spider Jack, in trousers and\nshirt, hastily donned, no doubt, as he had got out of bed, was\nstanding in the street doorway, and beyond him loomed the forms of\nseveral men.  Spider Jack stepped aside to allow his visitors to\nenter–and suddenly, a cry barely suppressed upon his lips, Jimmie\nDale involuntarily strained forward.  Three men had entered, but his\neyes were fixed, fascinated, upon only one–the first of the three.\nWas it an hallucination?  Was he mad–-dreaming?  It was Hilton\nTravers, THE CHAUFFEUR–the man whom he could have sworn he had last\nseen dead, lashed in that chair, in that ghastly death chamber of\nthe Crime Club!",
        "“Rather rough on you, Spider, to pull you out of bed at this hour,\"\nthe chauffeur was saying apologetically.",
        "“Oh, that’s all right, seein’ it’s you, Travers,” Spider Jack\nanswered, gruffly amiable.  “Only I was kind of lookin’ for you last\nnight.”",
        "“I know,” the chauffeur replied; “but I couldn’t connect with my\nfriends here.  Shake hands with them, Spider–Bob Marvin–Harry\nStead.”",
        "“Glad to know you, gents,” said Spider Jack, with a handgrip apiece.",
        "The chauffeur lowered his voice a little.",
        "“I suppose we’re alone here, eh, Spider?  Yes?  Well, then, you know\nwhat I’ve come for–that package–Marvin and Stead, here, are the\nones that are in on it with me.  Get it for me, will you, Spider?”",
        "“Sure–Mr. Johansson!” Spider grinned.  “Sure!  Come on into the\nback room and make yourselves comfortable.  I’ll be mabbe five\nminutes, or so.”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s brain was whirling.  What did it mean?  He could not\nseem to understand.  His mind seemed to refuse its functions.\nTravers, the chauffeur–ALIVE!  He drew in his breath sharply.  That\ncurtain in the corner!  He must see this out now!  They were coming!\nQuick, noiseless, he stole along the side of the wall, reached the\ncorner, and slipped in behind the curtain, as Spider Jack, striking\na match, entered the room.",
        "Spider Jack lighted the gas, and, as the others followed behind him,\nwaved them toward the chairs around the table.",
        "“I’ll just ask you gents not to leave the room,” he said meaningly,\nover his shoulder, as he stepped toward the rear door.  “It’s kind\nof a fad of mine to keep some things even from my wife!”",
        "“All right, Spider–I understand,” the chauffeur returned readily.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s knife cut a tiny slit in the cretonne on a level with\nhis eyes.  The three men had seated themselves at the table, and\nappeared to be listening intently.  Spider Jack’s footsteps echoed\nback as he crossed the rear room, sounded dull and muffled\ndescending the stoop outside, and died away.",
        "“I told you it wasn’t in the house!” the man who had been introduced\nas Stead laughed shortly.  “We wasted the hour we had here.”",
        "The third man spoke crisply, incisively, to the chauffeur.",
        "“Turn down that gas jet a little!  You’ve got across with it so far–\nbut you can’t stand a searchlight, Clarke!",
        "And at the words, in a flash, the meaning of it, all of it, to the\nlast detail that was spelling death, ruin, and disaster for her, the\nTocsin, for himself as well, burst upon Jimmie Dale.  That VOICE!\nHe would have known it, recognised it, among a thousand–it was the\nmasked man of the night before, the leader, the head of the Crime\nClub!  And it was not Travers there at all!  He remembered now, too\nwell, that second room they had showed him in the Crime Club–its\nmultitude of disguises, though in this case they had the dead man’s\nclothes ready to their hands–the leader’s boast that impersonation\nwas but child’s play to them!  And now he understood why they had\ncovered up the traces of their search in only so curiously\ninadequate a manner.  They had failed to find the package, and, as a\nlast resort, had adopted the ruse of impersonating Hilton Travers,\nthe chauffeur, which made it necessary that when they called Spider\nJack from his bed, as they had just done, that Spider Jack, at a\nCASUAL glance, should notice nothing amiss–but it would be no more\nthan a casual glance, for, who should know better than they, he\nwould not have to go for the package to any place that they had\ndisturbed!  And he, Jimmie Dale, could only stand here and watch\nthem, helpless, powerless to move!  Three of them!  A step out into\nthe room was to invite certain death.  It would not matter, his\ndeath–if he could gain anything for her, for the Tocsin, by it.\nBut what could he gain–by dying?  He clenched his hands until the\nnails bit into the flesh.",
        "Spider Jack re-entered the room, carrying what looked like a large,\nbulky, manila envelope, heavily sealed, in his hand.  He tossed it\non the table.",
        "“There you are, Travers!” he said.",
        "“I wonder,” suggested the leader pleasantly, “if, now that we’re\nhere, Travers, your friend would mind letting us have this room for\na few minutes to ourselves to clean up the business?”",
        "“Sure!” agreed Spider Jack cordially.  “You’re welcome to it!  I’ll\nwait out here in the store until you say the word.”",
        "He went out, closing the door after him.  The leader picked up the\npackage.",
        "“We’ll take no chances with this,” he said grimly.  “It’s been too\nclose a call.  After we’ve had a look at it, we’ll put it out of\nharm’s way on the spot, here, while we’ve got it–before we leave!”",
        "He ripped the package open, and disclosed perhaps a dozen official-\nlooking documents, besides a miscellaneous number of others.  He\ntook up the first of the papers, glanced through it hurriedly, then\ntossed it to the pseudo chauffeur.",
        "“Tear it up, and tear it up–SMALL!” he ordered tersely.  The next,\nafter examining it as he had the first, he tossed to the other man.\n\"Go ahead!\"–curtly.  “Work fast!  From the looks of these, Travers\nhad us cold!  There’s proof enough here of LaSalle’s murder to send\nus all to the chair!”",
        "He went on glancing through the documents; and then suddenly,\njoining the others in their work, began to rip and tear at the\npapers himself.",
        "A sort of cold horror had settled upon Jimmie Dale, and his forehead\nwas clammy wet.  The inhuman irony of it!  That he should stand\nthere and watch, impotent to prevent it, the destruction of what he\nwould have given his life to secure!  And then slowly, a grim, hard,\nmerciless smile came to his lips.  He had recognised the leader’s\nvoice–now he would recognise the leader’s FACE.  At least, that was\nleft to him–perhaps the master trump of all.  It would not be very\nhard to find the Crime Club now–with that man to lead the way!",
        "The scraps of paper, tiny shreds, mounted into a heap on the table–\nand with the last of the contents of the package destroyed, the\nleader stood up.",
        "“Put these pieces in your pockets; we don’t want to leave them\nhere,” he directed quietly.  “And then let’s get out.”",
        "In scarcely a moment, the last scrap of paper had vanished.  The\nthree men walked to the door, passed through it, and joined Spider\nJack in the store–and Jimmie Dale, slipping out from behind the\ncurtain, gained the door of the rear room, crept through it, reached\nthe stoop, and then, darting like the wind across the yard, was over\nthe fence in a second, and in another was out of the alleyway and on\nthe street.",
        "He was in time–in plenty of time.  They had just left Spider\nJack’s, and were, perhaps, fifty yards or so ahead of him.  He\nslouched on behind them–the cold, grim smile on his lips once more.\nIt was the Crime Club now, that hell’s cradle where their devil’s\nschemes were hatched, that was the one thing left to him; they would\nlead him to that, and then–and then it would be his turn to STRIKE!",
        "They turned the first corner.  And suddenly, as the racing engine of\nan automobile caught his ear, he broke into a run, and dashed around\nthe corner after them–in time to see them jump into a car, and the\ncar speed off along the street!  He halted, as though he were\nsuddenly dazed–started involuntarily to run forward again–stopped\nwith a hollow laugh at the futility of it–and stood still and\nmotionless on the sidewalk.",
        "And then he swayed a little, and his face grew gray.  Failure,\ndefeat, ruin–in that moment he knew them all to their bitterest\ndregs.  How could he go to her!  How could he face her, and tell her\nthat they were beaten, that the last hope was gone, that he had\nfailed!",
        "“God!” he cried aloud, and clenched his hands.",
        "Then deep in his consciousness a thought stirred, and he swept a\nshaking hand across his eyes.  Why had it come again, that thought!\nDid it mean that HE must play–the last card!  There was a way–\nthere had always been a way.  The way the Crime Club took–MURDER.\nIt was their own weapon!  If the man who posed as Henry LaSalle were\nkilled!  If that man–were killed!",
        "“The Magpie was to be there at three!” he muttered–and started\nmechanically back along the street.",
        "It was a horrible thing–and it grew upon him.  In a blind,\nmechanical way, his brain receptive to nothing else, Jimmie Dale\nwalked on along the street.  To kill a man!  Death he had faced\nhimself a hundred times, witnessed it a hundred times in its most\nviolent forms, had seen murder done before his eyes, had been in\nstraits where, to save his own life, it had seemed the one last\ndesperate chance–and yet his hands were still clean!  To kill a man\nin fair fight, in struggle, when the blood was hot, was terrible\nenough, a possibility that was always before him, the one thing from\nwhich he shrank, the one thing that, as the Gray Seal, he had always\nfeared; but to kill a man deliberately, to creep upon his victim\nwith hideous, cold-blooded premeditation–he shivered a little, and\nhis hand shook as he drew it nervously across his eyes.",
        "But there was no other way!  Again and again, insidiously grappling\nwith his revulsion, with the horror that the impulse to murder\ninspired, came that other thought–there was no other way.  If the\nman who posed as Henry LaSalle were DEAD!  If he were dead!  If he\nwere dead!  See, now, what would happen if that man were dead!  How\nclear his brain was on that point!  The whole plot would tumble like\na house of cards about the heads of the Crime Club.  The courts\nwould require an auditing of the estate by a trustee of the courts’\nown appointing, who would continue to administer it until the\nTocsin’s twenty-fifth birthday, or until there was tangible evidence\nof her death–but the Tocsin, automatically with her pseudo uncle’s\ndeath, could publicly appear again.  Her death could no longer\nbenefit the Crime Club, since it, the Crime Club, with the supposed\nuncle dead, could not profit through the false Henry LaSalle\ninheriting as next of kin!  It was the weak link, the vulnerable\npoint in the stupendous scheme of murder and crime with which these\nhell fiends had played for and won, so far, the stake of eleven\nmillions.  Not that they had overlooked or been blind to this, they\nwere too clever, too cunning for that–it was only that they had\nplanned to accomplish the Tocsin’s death, as they had her father’s\nand uncle’s, and ESTABLISH the false Henry LaSalle in undisputed\npossession and ownership of the estate–and had failed in that–up\nto the present.  But the material results remained the same, so long\nas the Tocsin, to save her life, was forced to remain in hiding, so\nlong as proof that would convict the Crime Club was not forthcoming–\nSO LONG AS THAT MAN LIVED!",
        "Time passed to which Jimmie Dale was oblivious.  At times he walked\nslowly, scarcely moving; at times his pace was a nervous, hurried\nstride, that was almost a run.  And as he was oblivious to time, so\nwas he oblivious to his surroundings, to the direction which he\ntook.  At times his forehead was damp with moisture that was not\nthere from physical exertion; at times his face, deathly white, was\nfull as of the vision of some shuddering, abhorrent sight; at times\nhis lips were thinned into a straight line, and there was a glitter\nin the dark eyes that was not good to see, while his hands at his\nsides clenched until the skin, tight over the knuckles, was an ivory\nwhite.  To kill a man!",
        "What other way was there?  The proof that it had taken Hilton\nTravers years to obtain, the proof on which the Tocsin’s life\ndepended, was destroyed utterly, irreparably.  It could never be\nduplicated–Hilton Travers was dead–MURDERED.  Murder!  That\nthought again!  It was their own weapon!  Murder!  Would one kill a\nvenomous reptile in whose fangs was death?  What right had this man\nto life, whose life was forfeit even under the law–for murder?  Was\nshe to drag on an intolerable existence among the dregs and the scum\nof the underworld, she, in her refinement and her purity, to exist\namong the vile and dissolute, in daily, hourly peril of her life,\nbecause the weapons that these inhuman vultures had used to rob her,\nto destroy those she loved, to make of her life a hideous, joyless\nthing, should not be used against them?",
        "But to kill a man!  To steal upon a man with cold intent in the\nblackness of the night–and take his life!  To be a murderer!  To\nknow the horror of blood forever upon one’s hands, to rise, cold-\nsweated, in the night, fearful of the very shadows around one, to\nlive with every detail of that fearsome act sweeping like some dread\nspectre at unexpected moments upon the consciousness!  He put up his\nhands before his face, as though to blot out the thought from him.\nMind and soul recoiled before it–to kill a man!",
        "He walked on and on, until at last, conscious of a sense of fatigue,\nhe stopped.  He must have come a long way, been walking a long time.\nWhere was he?  He looked about him for a moment in a dazed way–and\nsuddenly, with a low cry, shrank back.  As though he had been drawn\nto it by some ghastly magnet, he found himself standing in front of\nthe LaSalle mansion, on Fifth Avenue.  No, no; it was not for that\nhe had come–to kill a man!  It was only–only to get that money.\nYes–he remembered now–that money from the safe, before the Magpie\ngot it.  The Magpie was to be there at three o’clock–and the Tocsin\nwas to be there, too.  The Tocsin!  That package!  He had failed!\nIt had been her one hope, and–and it was gone.  What could he say\nto her?  How could he tell her the miserable truth?  But–but he had\nnot come there in the dead of night to kill a man, these other\nthings were what had–",
        "“Jimmie!”  It was a quick-breathed whisper.  A hand was on his arm.",
        "He turned, startled.  It was the Tocsin–Silver Mag.",
        "“Jimmie!” in alarm.  “Why are you standing here like this?  You may\nbe SEEN!”",
        "Seen!  Suppose he WERE seen?  He shuddered a little.",
        "“Yes; that’s so!” he said hoarsely.  He glanced numbly up and down\nthe wide, deserted, but well-lighted, avenue.  It was no place, that\nmost aristocratic section of the city, for such as Silver Mag and\nLarry the Bat to be seen at that hour of night, or, rather, morning.\nAnd if anything HAPPENED inside that house!  “I–I didn’t think of\nthat,” he said mechanically.",
        "“Come across the street–under the stoop of that house there.”  She\nhad his arm, and was half dragging him as she spoke, the alarm in\nher voice intensified.  And then, a moment later, safe from\nobservation: “Jimmie, Jimmie, what is the matter?  What has\nhappened?  What makes you act so strangely?”",
        "“Nothing,” he said.  “I–”",
        "“TELL me!” she insisted wildly.",
        "And then, with a violent effort, Jimmie Dale forced his mind back to\nthe immediate present.  He was only inspiring her with terror–and\nthere was the Magpie–and that money in the safe!",
        "“Where is the Magpie?” he asked, with quick apprehension.  “Am I\nlate?  Is he in there already?”",
        "“No,” she said.  “He hasn’t come yet.”",
        "“What time is it?” he demanded anxiously.",
        "“About half-past two,” she replied.  “But, Jimmie–”",
        "“Wait!” he broke in.  “Where is he now?  You were both together!\nAnd you were both to be here at three.  What are you doing here\nalone at half-past two?”",
        "A strange little exclamation, one almost of dismay, it seemed,\nescaped her.",
        "“The Magpie left my place an hour ago–to get his kit, I think.  And\nI came here at once because that was what you and I understood I was\nto do, wasn’t it?  Jimmie, you frighten me!  You are not yourself.\nDon’t you remember the last words you said, as you nodded to me\nbehind the Magpie’s back–that you would be here BEFORE us?  There\nwas no mistaking your meaning–if I could get away from him, I was\nto come here and meet you.”",
        "Jimmie Dale passed his hand nervously across his eyes.  Of course,\nhe remembered now!  What a frightful turmoil his brain had been in!",
        "“Yes; of course!” He tried to speak nonchalantly.  “I had forgotten\nfor the moment.”",
        "She caught his arm in a quick, tight hold, shaking him in a\nterrified way.",
        "“YOU–forget a thing like that!  Jimmie–something terrible has\nhappened.  Can’t you see that I am nearly mad with anxiety!  What is\nit?  What is it?  That package, Jimmie–is it the package?”",
        "He did not answer.  What could he say?  It meant life, hope, joy,\neverything that the world held for her–and it was gone.",
        "“Yes–it IS the package!” she whispered frantically.  “Quick,\nJimmie!  Tell me!  It–it was not there?  You–you could not find\nit?”",
        "“It was there,” he said, as though the words were literally forced\nfrom him.",
        "“Then?  Then–WHAT, Jimmie?”  The clutch on his arm was like a vise.",
        "“They got it,” he said.  It was like a death sentence that he\npronounced.  “It is destroyed.”",
        "She did not speak or move–save that her hands, as though nerveless\nand without strength, fell away from his arms, and dropped to her\nsides.  It was dark there under the stoop, though not so dark but\nthat he could see her face.  It was gray–gray as death.  And there\nwas misery and fear and a pitiful helplessness in it–and then she\nswayed a little, and he caught her in his arms.",
        "“Gone!” she murmured in a dead, colourless way–and suddenly laughed\nout sharply, hysterically.",
        "“Don’t!  For God’s sake, don’t do that!” he pleaded wildly.",
        "She looked at him then for a moment in strange quiet–and lifted her\nhand and stroked his face in a numbed way.",
        "“It–it would have been better, Jimmie, wouldn’t it,” she said in\nthe same monotonous voice, “it would have been better if–if I had\nnever found out anything, and they–they had done the same to me\nthat they did to–to father.”",
        "“Marie!  Marie!”  It was the first time he had ever spoken her name,\nand it was on his lips now in an agony of tenderness and appeal.\n\"Don’t!  You mustn’t speak like that!”",
        "“I’m tired,” she said.  “I–I can’t fight any more.”",
        "She did not cry.  She lay there in his arms quite still–like a\nweary child.",
        "The minutes passed.  When Jimmie Dale spoke again it was\nirrelevantly–and his face was very white:",
        "“Marie, describe the upper floor of that house over there for me.”",
        "She roused herself with a start.",
        "“The upper floor?” she repeated slowly.  “Why–why do you ask that?”",
        "“Have YOU forgotten in turn?” he said, with a steady smile.  “That\nmoney in the safe–it’s yours–we can at least save that out of the\nwreck.  You only drew the basement plan and the first floor for the\nMagpie–the more I know about the house the better, of course, in\ncase anything goes wrong.  Now, see, try and be brave–and tell me\nquickly, for I must get through before the Magpie comes, and I have\nbarely half an hour.”",
        "“No, Jimmie–no!”  She slipped out of his arms.  “Let it alone!  I\nam afraid.  Something–I–I have a feeling that something will\nhappen.”",
        "“It is the only way.”  He said it involuntarily, more to himself\nthan to her.",
        "“Jimmie, let it alone!” she said again.",
        "“No,” he said.  “I am going–so tell me quickly.  Every minute that\nwe wait is one that counts against us.”",
        "She hesitated an instant–and then, speaking rapidly, made a verbal\nsketch of the upper portion of the house for him.",
        "“It’s a very large house, isn’t it?” he commented innocently–to\npave the way for the question, above all others, that he had to ask.\n\"Which is your uncle’s, I mean that man’s room?”",
        "“The first on the right, at the head of the landing,” she answered.\n\"Only, Jimmie, don’t–don’t go!”",
        "He drew her close to him again.",
        "“Now, listen,” he said quietly.  “When the Magpie comes and finds I\nam not here, lead him to think that the money he gave me was too\nmuch for me; that I am probably in some den, doped with drug–and\nhold him as long as you can on the pretext that there is always the\npossibility I may, after all, show up before he goes in there.  You\nunderstand?  And now about yourself–you must do exactly as I say.\nOn no account allow yourself to be seen by ANY ONE except the\nMagpie.  I would tell you to go now, only, unless it is vitally\nnecessary, we cannot afford to arouse the Magpie’s suspicions–he’d\nhave every crook in the underworld snarling at our heels.  But you\nare not to wait, even for him, if you detect the slightest\ndisturbance in that house before he comes.  And, equally, after he\nhas gone in, whether I have come out or not, at the first indication\nof anything unusual you are to get away at once.  You understand–\nMarie?”",
        "“Yes,” she said.  “But–but, Jimmie, you–”",
        "“Just one thing more.”  He smiled at her reassuringly.  “Did the\nMagpie say anything about how he intended to get in?”",
        "“Yes–by the side away from the corner of the street,” she said\ntremulously.  “You see, there’s quite a space between the house and\nthe one next door; and, besides, the house next door is closed up,\nthere’s nobody there, the family has gone away for the summer.  The\nlibrary window there is low enough to reach from the ground.”",
        "For a moment longer he held her close to him, as though he could not\nlet her go–then bent and kissed her passionately.  And in that\nmoment all the emotions he had known as he had walked blindly from\nSpider Jack’s that night surged again upon him; and that voice was\nwhispering, whispering, whispering: “It is the only way–it is the\nonly way.”",
        "And then, not daring to trust his voice, he released her suddenly,\nand stepped back out from under the stoop–and the next instant he\nwas across the deserted avenue.  Another, and he had slipped through\nthe iron gates that opened on the street driveway–and in yet\nanother he was crouched close up against the front door of the\nLaSalle mansion.",
        "It was a large house, a very large house, one of the few that, even\namid the wealth and luxury of that quarter, boasted its own grounds,\nand those so restricted as scarcely to deserve the name; but it was\nset far enough back from the street to escape the radius of the\nstreet lamps, and so guarantee in its shadows security from\nobservation.  It was not the Magpie’s way, the front door–the\nobvious to the Magpie and his ilk was a thing always to be shunned.\nJimmie Dale’s lips were set in a grim smile, as his fingers worked\nwith lightning speed, now taking this instrument and now that from\nthe leather pockets in the girdle beneath his shirt–the\npenitentiaries were full of Magpies who shunned the obvious!",
        "Very slowly, very cautiously the door opened.  He listened\nbreathlessly, tensely.  The door closed again–behind him.  He was\ninside now.  Stillness!  Blackness!  Not a sound!  A minute went by–\nanother.  And then, as he stood there, strained, listening, the\nsilence itself began, it seemed, to palpitate, and pound, pound,\npound, and be full of strange noises.  It was a horrible thing–to\nkill a man!",
        "A moment later, Jimmie Dale stepped forward through the vestibule.\nHe was quite calm now; a sort of cold, merciless precision in every\nmovement succeeding the riot of turbulent emotions that had\npossessed him as he had entered the house.",
        "The half hour, the maximum length of time before the Magpie would\nappear, as he had estimated it when out there under the stoop with\nthe Tocsin, had dwindled now to perhaps twenty minutes, twenty-five\nat the outside.  Twenty-five minutes!  Twenty-five minutes was so\nlittle that for an instant the temptation was strong upon him to\nsacrifice, rather than any of those precious minutes, the Magpie\ninstead!  And then in the darkness, as he stole noiselessly across\nthe hall, he shook his head.  It would be a cowardly, brutal thing\nto do.  What chance would a man with a record like the Magpie’s\nstand if caught there?  How easy it would be to shift the murder of\nthe supposed Henry LaSalle to the Magpie’s shoulders!  Jimmie Dale’s\nlips closed firmly.  Self-preservation was, perhaps, the first law,\nbut he would save the Magpie if he could–the Magpie should have his\nchance!  The man might be a criminal, might deserve punishment at\nthe hands of the law, his liberty might be a menace to the\ncommunity–but he was not a murderer, his life forfeit for a crime\nhe had never committed!",
        "If he, Jimmie Dale, could only in some way have arranged with the\nTocsin out there to keep the Magpie away altogether!  But it could\nnot be done without arousing the Magpie’s suspicions; and, as a\ncorollary to that, afterward, with the subsequent events, would\ncome–the deluge!  The law of the underworld was clear, concise, and\nadmitting of no appeal on that point; to double cross a pal meant,\nsooner or later, a knife thrust, a blackjack, or–  But what\ndifference did it make what form the execution of the sentence took?\nAnd, since, then, that was out of the question, since he could not\nkeep the Magpie away without practically risking his own life, the\nMagpie at least must have his chance.",
        "Jimmie Dale was at the library door now, that, according to the plan\nthe Tocsin had drawn for the Magpie, and as he remembered her\ndescription when she had told him her story earlier in the evening,\nwas just at the foot of the staircase.  How dark it was!  Though the\nstairs could be only a few feet away, he could not see them.  And\nhow intense the silence was again!  Here, where he stood, the\nslightest stir from above must have reached him–but there was not a\nsound.",
        "His hand felt out for the doorknob, found it, turned it, and pushed\nthe door open.  He stepped inside the room and closed the door\nbehind him.  The safe, according to the Tocsin’s plan again, was in\nthat sort of alcove at the lower end of the library.  Jimmie Dale’s\nflashlight played inquisitively about the room.  There was the\nwindow, the only one in the room, the window through which the\nMagpie proposed to enter; there was the archway of the alcove, with\nits–no, there were no longer any portieres; and there was the safe,\nhe could see it quite plainly from where he stood at the upper end\nof the room.",
        "The flashlight went out for the space of perhaps thirty seconds–\nthirty seconds of absolute silence, absolute stillness–then the\nround, white ray of the light again, but glistening now on the\nnickel knobs and dial of the safe–and Jimmie Dale was on his knees\nbefore it.",
        "A low, scarcely breathed exclamation, that seemed to mingle anxiety\nand hesitation, escaped him.  He, who knew the make of every safe in\nthe country, knew this one for its true worth.  Twenty-five minutes!\nCould he open it in that time, let alone with any time to spare!  It\nwas not like the one in Spider Jack’s; it was the kind that the\nMagpie, however clever he might be in his own way, would be forced\nto negotiate with “soup,” and, with the attendant noise, double his\nchance of discovery and capture–and the responsibility for what\nmight have happened UPSTAIRS!  No; the Magpie must have his chance!\nAnd, besides, the money in the safe apart, why should not he, Jimmie\nDale, have his own chance, as well?  All this would help.  The\nmotive–robbery; the perpetrator, there was grim mockery on his lips\nnow as the light went out and the sensitive fingers closed on the\nknob of the dial, the perpetrator–the Gray Seal.  It would afford\nexcellent food for the violent editorial diatribes under which the\npolice again would writhe in frenzy!",
        "Stillness again!  Silence!  Only a low, tense breathing; only, so\nfaint that it could not be heard a foot away, a curious scratching,\nas from time to time the supersensitive fingers fell away from the\ndial to rub upon the carpet–to increase even their sensitiveness by\nsetting the nerves to throbbing through the skin surface at the\ntips.  And then Jimmie Dale’s head, ear pressed close against the\nsafe to catch the tumbler’s fall, was lifted–and the flashlight\nplayed again on the dial.",
        "“Twenty-eight and a quarter–left.”",
        "How fast the time went–and how slowly!  Still the black shape\ncrouched there in the darkness against the safe.  At times, in\nstrange, ghostly flashes, the nickel dial with the ray upon it\nseemed to leap out and glisten through the surrounding blackness; at\ntimes, the quick intake of breath, as from great exertion; at times,\nfaint, musical little clicks, as, after abortive effort, the dial\nwhirled, preparatory to a fresh attempt.  And then, at last–a gasp\nof relief:",
        "“Ah!”",
        "Came the sound, barely audible, as of steel sliding in well-oiled\ngrooves, the muffled thud of metal meeting metal as the bolts shot\nback–and the heavy door swung outward.",
        "Jimmie Dale stretched his cramped limbs, and wiped the moisture from\nhis face–then set to work again upon the inner door.  This was an\neasier matter–far easier.  Five minutes, perhaps a little more,\nwent by–and then the inner door was open, and the flashlight’s ray\nwas flooding the interior of the safe.",
        "A queer little sound, half of astonishment, half of disappointment,\nissued from Jimmie Dale’s lips.  There was money here, a great deal\nof money, undoubtedly, but there was no such sum as he had, somehow,\nfantastically imagined from the Magpie’s evidently overcoloured\nstory that there would be; there was money, ten packages of\nbanknotes neatly piled in the bottom compartment–but there was no\nhalf million of dollars!  He picked up one of the packages\nhurriedly–and drew in his breath.  After all, there was a great\ndeal–the notes were of hundred-dollar denomination, and on the\nbottom were two one-thousand-dollar bills!  Calculated roughly, if\neach of the other nine packages contained a like amount, the total\nmust exceed a hundred thousand.",
        "And now Jimmie Dale began to work with feverish haste.  From the\nleather girdle inside his shirt came the thin metal insignia case–\nand a gray seal was stuck firmly on the dial knob of the safe.  This\ndone, he tucked away the packages of banknotes, some into his\npockets and some inside his shirt; and then quickly ransacked the\ninterior of the safe, flauntingly spilling the contents of drawers\nand pigeonholes out upon the floor.",
        "He stood up, and, leaving the safe door wide open, walked back\nacross the room to the window, unfastened the catch, and opened the\nwindow an inch or two.  The way was open now for the Magpie!  The\nMagpie would have no need to make any noise in forcing an entrance;\nhe would be able to see almost at a glance that he had been\nforestalled–by the Gray Seal; and that, as far as he was concerned,\nthe game was up.  The Magpie had his chance!  If the Magpie did not\ntake the hint and make his escape as noiselessly as he had entered–\nit was his own fault!  He, Jimmie Dale, had given the Magpie his\nchance.",
        "Jimmie Dale turned from the window, and made his way out of the\nlibrary to the foot of the stairs, leaving the library door open\nbehind him.  How long had he been?  Was it more or less than the\ntwenty-five minutes?  He did not know–only, as yet, the Magpie had\nnot come, and now perhaps it did not make so much difference.",
        "Where was he going now?  His foot was on the first stair–and\nsuddenly he drew it back, the cold sweat bursting out on his\nforehead.  Where was he going now?  “THE FIRST ROOM ON THE RIGHT AT\nTHE HEAD OF THE LANDING.”  From his inner consciousness, as it were,\nthe answer, in all the bald, naked horror that it implied, flashed\nupon him.  The first room on the right–THAT man’s room!  God, how\nthe darkness and the stillness began to palpitate again, and\nsuddenly seem to shriek out at him over and over the one single,\nghastly word–MURDER!",
        "It had been with him, that thought, all the time he had been working\nat the safe; but it had been there then only subconsciously, like\nsome heavy, nameless dread, subjugated for the moment by the work he\nhad had to do which had demanded the centred attention of every\nfaculty he possessed.  But now the moment had come when there was\nonly THAT before him, only that, nothing else–only that, the man\nupstairs in the first room to the right of the landing!",
        "Why did he hesitate?  Why did he stand there while the priceless\nmoments before daylight came were passing?  The man was a murderer,\na blotch on society, and, his life already forfeited, he was living\nnow only because the law had not found him out–the man was a\ncriminal, bloodstained–and his life, because he had taken her\nfather’s life and had tried to take the Tocsin’s own life, stood\nbetween her and every hope of happiness, robbing her even literally,\nin a material sense, of everything that the world could hold for\nher!  Why did he hesitate?  It was that man’s life–or hers!  It was\nthe only way!",
        "He put his foot upon the bottom step again–paused still another\ninstant–and then began stealthily to mount the stairs.  The\ndarkness!  There had never been, it seemed, such darkness before!\nThe stillness–he had never known silence so heavy, so full of\nstrange, premonitory pulsings; a silence that seemed so\nincongruously full of clamouring whispers in his ears!  It must be\nthose imagined whispers that were affecting his nerve–for now, as\nhe gained the landing and slipped his automatic from his pocket, his\nhand was shaking with a queer twitching motion.",
        "For an instant, fighting for his self-composure, he stood striving\nto locate his surroundings through the darkness.  The staircase was\na circular one, making the landing nearly at the front of the house,\nand rearward from this, the Tocsin had said, a hallway ran down the\ncentre, with rooms on either side.  The first room to the right,\ntherefore, should be just at his hand.  He reached out, feeling\ncautiously–there was nothing.  He edged to the right–still\nnothing; edged a little farther, a sense of bewilderment growing\nupon him, and finally his fingers touched the wall.  It was very\nstrange!  The hallway must be much wider than he had understood it\nto be from what she had said!",
        "He moved along now straight ahead of him, his hand on the wall,\nfeeling for the door–and with every step his bewilderment\nincreased.  Surely there must be some mistake–perhaps he had\nmisunderstood!  He had come fully twice the distance that one would\nexpect–and yet there was no door.  Ah, what was that?  His fingers\nclosed on soft, heavy velvet hangings.  These could hardly be in\nfront of a door, and yet–what else could it be?  He drew the\nhangings warily apart, and felt behind them.  It was a window; but\nit was shuttered in some way evidently, for he could not see out.",
        "Jimmie Dale stood motionless there for fully a minute.  It seemed\nabsurd, preposterous, the conviction that was being forced home upon\nhim–that there were no rooms on the right-hand side of the corridor\nat all!  But that was not like the Tocsin, accurate always in the\nmost minute details.  The room must be still farther along.  He was\ntempted to use his flashlight–but that, as long as he could feel\nhis way, was an unnecessary risk.  A flashlight upstairs, where a\nsleeping-room door might be ajar, or even wide open, where some one\nwakeful, THAT man himself, perhaps, might see it, was quite another\nmatter than a flashlight in the closed and deserted library below!",
        "He went on once more, still guiding himself by a light finger touch\nupon the wall, passed another portiere similar to the first, and,\nafter that, another–and finally stopped by bringing up abruptly\nagainst the end wall of the house.  It was certainly very strange!\nThere WERE no rooms on the right-hand side of the corridor.  And\nhere, hanging across the end wall, was another of those ubiquitous\nvelvet portieres.  He parted it, and, a little to his surprise,\nfound a window that was not shuttered, but that, instead, was\nheavily barred by an ornamental grille work.  He could see out,\nhowever, and found that he was looking directly out from the rear of\nthe house.  A lamp from the side street threw what was undoubtedly\nthe garage into shadowy outline, and he made out below him a short\nstretch of yard between the garage and the house.  He remembered\nthat now–she had described all that to the Magpie.  There was no\ndriveway between the front and the rear.  The house being on the\ncorner, the entrance to the garage was directly from the side\nstreet.  Yes, she had described all that exactly as it was, but–he\ndropped the portiere and faced around, carrying his hand in a\nnonplused way to his eyes–but here, upstairs, within the house, it\nwas not as she had said it was at all!  What did it mean?  She could\nnot have blundered so egregiously as that, unless–he caught his\nbreath suddenly–unless she had done so intentionally!  Was that it?\nHad she surmised, formed a suspicion of what was in his mind, of\nwhat he meant to do–and taken this means of defeating it?  If so–\nwell, it was too late for that now!  There was one way–only one\nway!  Whatever the cost, whatever it might mean for him–there was\nonly one way out for her.",
        "His flashlight was in his hand now, and the round, white ray shot\ndown the corridor–seemed suddenly to falter unsteadily–swept in\nthrough an open door that was almost beside him–and then, as though\na nerveless hand held it, the ray dropped and played shakily on the\ntoe of his boot before it went out.",
        "A stifled cry rose to his lips.  Something cold, like a hand of ice,\nseemed to clutch at his heart.  Those portieres, the wide, richly\ncarpeted corridor!  It was the corridor of the night before!  That\nroom at his side was the room where he had seen Hilton Travers, the\nchauffeur, dead, lashed in a chair!  He felt the sweat beads burst\nout anew upon his forehead.",
        "It Was the Crime Club!",
        "His brain seemed to whirl, staggered as by some gigantic, ghastly\nmockery.  The Crime Club!  HERE!  He had thought to creep upon that\nman–and he had run blindly into the very heart and centre of these\nhell fiends’ nest!",
        "Silently he stood there, holding his breath as he listened now,\nmotionless as a statue, forcing his mind to THINK.  He remembered\nthat last night his impression of the place had been that it was\nmore like some great private mansion than anything else.  Well, he\nhad been right, it seemed!  He could have laughed aloud–\nsardonically, hysterically.  It was not so strange now that there\nwere no rooms on the right-hand side of the corridor!  And what\ncould have suited their purpose better, what, by its very location,\nits unimpeachable character, could be a more ideal lair for them\nthan this house!  And how grimly simple it was now, the explanation!\nIn the five years that the false Henry LaSalle had been in\npossession, they had cunningly remodelled the upper floor–that was\nall!  It was quite clear now why the man never entertained–why he\nhad never been caught or found or known to be in communication with\nhis fellow conspirators!  It was no longer curious that one might\nwatch the door of the house for months at a stretch and go\nunrewarded for one’s pains, as the Tocsin had done, when access to\nthe house by those who frequented it was so easy through the garage\non the side street–and from the garage, if their work there was in\nkeeping with their clever contrivances within the house, by an\nunderground connection into, say, the cellar or basement!",
        "Again Jimmie Dale checked that nervous, unnatural inclination to\nlaugh aloud.  Was there anything, any single incident, any single\ndetail of all that had transpired, that was not explained, borne\nout, as it could be explained and borne out in no other way save\nthat the Crime Club should be no other than this very house itself?\nIt was the exposition of that favourite theory of his–it was so\nobvious that therein lay its security.  He had mocked at the Magpie\nnot many moments before on that score–and now it was the beam in\nhis own eye!  It was so obvious now, so glaringly obvious, that the\nCrime Club could have been nowhere else; so obvious, with every word\nof the Tocsin’s story pointing it out like a signpost–and he had\nnot seen it!",
        "And then suddenly every muscle grew strained and rigid.  WAS THERE\nSOME ONE IN THE CORRIDOR?  Was it some one moving–or was it only\nfancy?  He listened–while he strained his eyes through the\ndarkness.  There was no sound; only that abnormal, heavy silence\nthat–yes, he remembered that, too, now–that had clung about him\nlast night like a pall.  He could see nothing, hear nothing–but\nintuitively, bringing a cold dismay, the greater because it was\nsomething unknown, intangible, he FELT as though eyes were upon him,\nthat even in the darkness he was being watched!",
        "And as he stood there, then, slowly there crept upon Jimmie Dale the\nsense of peril and disaster.  It was not intuition now–it was\ncertainty.  He was trapped!  It was the part of a fool to imagine\nthat with their devil’s cunning, their cleverness, their ingenuity,\nhe, or any one else, could enter that house unknown to its\noccupants!  Had he made electric contact when he had opened the\nfront door, and rung a signal here, perhaps, upstairs–had he set\nsome system of alarm at work when he had touched that window?  What\ndid it matter–the details that had heralded his entrance?  He was\ncertain now that his presence in the house was known.  Only, why had\nthey left him so long without attack?  He shook his head with a\nquick, impatient movement.  That, too, was obvious!  He was under\nobservation.  Who was he?  Why had he come?  Was he simply a paltry\nsafe-tapper–or was he one whom they had a real need to fear?  And\nthen, too, there might well be another reason.  It was far from\nlikely, in fact unreasonable, to imagine that all the men he had\nseen here the night before were in the house now.  Not many of them,\nif any, would LIVE here, for CONSTANT, daily coming and going, even\nthrough the garage, could not escape notice; and, of the servants,\nprobably a lesser breed of criminal, some of them, at least, no\ndoubt, were engaged at that moment in watching his own house on\nRiverside Drive!  There was even the possibility that the man posing\nas Henry LaSalle was, for the time being, here alone.",
        "He shook his head again.  He could hardly hope for that–he had no\nright to hope for anything more now than a struggle, with an\ninevitably fatal ending to himself, but one in which at least he\ncould sell his life as dearly as possible, one in which, perhaps, he\nmight pay the Tocsin’s score with the man he had come to find!  If\nhe could do that–well, after all, the price was not too great!",
        "There were no tremours of the muscles now.  It was Jimmie Dale, the\nGray Seal, every faculty alert, tense, keyed up to its highest\nefficiency; the brain cool, keen, and active–fighting for his life.\nThe front door through which he had entered was an impossibility;\nbut there was the window in the library that he had opened–if they\nwould let him get that far!  That was as good a chance as any.  If\nhe made an effort to find, say, a way to the flat above and chanced\nsome means of escape there, it would in no wise obviate an attack\nupon him, and he would only be under the added disadvantage of\nunfamiliar surroundings.",
        "Feeling out with his left hand, his automatic thrown a little\nforward in his right, he began to retrace his way along the blank\nwall of the corridor, pausing between each step to listen, moving\nsilently, his tread on the heavy carpet as noiseless as though it\nwere some shadow creeping there.",
        "Stillness–utter, absolute!  Always that stillness.  Always that\nsense of danger around him–the tense, bated expectancy of momentary\nattack–a revolver flash through the darkness–a sudden rush upon\nhim.  But still there was nothing–only the darkness, only the\nsilence.",
        "He gained the head of the stairs and began to descend–and now the\nstrain began to tell upon his nerves again.  Again he was possessed\nof the mad impulse to cry out, to do anything that would force the\nissue, that would end the horrible, unbearable suspense.  Why did\nthat revolver shot not come?  Why had they not yet rushed upon him?\nWhy were they playing with him as a cat with a mouse?  Or was it all\nwild, fanciful imagination?  NO!  What was that again!  He could\nhave sworn this time that he had heard a sound, but he could neither\ndefine its character, nor locate the direction from which it had\ncome.",
        "He was at the foot of the stairs now; and, guiding himself by the\nwall, moving now barely an inch at a time, he reached the library\ndoor that he had left open, and stole in over the threshold.\nHalfway down the room and diagonally across from where he stood was\nthe window.  In a moment now he could gain that, but they would\nnever let him go so easily–and so it must come now, in that next\nmoment, their attack!  Where were they?  Where were they now?  The\ntable–he must remember not to bump into the table!  A pause between\neach step, he was crossing the room.  He was halfway to the window.\nHad it been all fancy, was he to–  And then Jimmie Dale stood\nmotionless.  SOME ONE HAD CLOSED THE LIBRARY DOOR SOFTLY!",
        "Stillness again!  A sort of deadly calm upon him, Jimmie Dale felt\nout behind his back for the big library table that he had been\ncircuiting–if the window were wide open it might be done, but to\njump for it and stand silhouetted there during the pause necessary\nto fling the window up was little less than suicidal.  He edged back\nnoiselessly until his fingers touched the table; then, lowering\nhimself to his knees, he backed in underneath it, and lay flat upon\nthe floor.  It was not much protection, but it had one advantage: if\nthey switched on the lights it would show an EMPTY room for the\nfirst instant, and that instant meant–the first shot!",
        "Where were they now?  By the library door?  How many of them were\nthere?  Well, it was their move!  Two could play at cat and mouse\nuntil–until DAYLIGHT!  That wasn’t very far off, now, and when that\ncame he might still have the first shot, but after that–he turned\nhis head quickly toward the window.  There was a faint scratching\nnoise as of finger nails gripping the sill; then the window, very\nslowly, almost silently, was pushed steadily upward, and a dark form\nloomed up outside; and then, crawling through, a man dropped, as\nthough his feet were padded like a cat’s on the floor inside the\nroom.  The Magpie!",
        "A flashlight’s ray shot out–and, with a twisted smile propped now\non his left elbow to give free play to his revolver arm, Jimmie Dale\nfollowed the white spot eagerly with his eyes.  But it did not\ncircle around; instead, the light was turned almost instantly toward\nthe lower end of the room–and, a second later, was holding steadily\non the open door of the safe, and the litter of papers on the floor.",
        "Came a savage growl of amazed fury from the Magpie: then his step\ndown the room; and, as he reached the safe, a torrent of unbridled\nblasphemy–and then, in a sort of staggered gasp, as he leaned\nsuddenly forward examining the knob of the dial:",
        "“The Gray Seal!”",
        "A moment the Magpie stood there; and then, cursing again in abandon,\nturned, and started back for the window, his flashlight dancing\nbefore him–and stopped, a snarl of fury on his lips.  The\nflashlight was playing full on Jimmie Dale under the table!",
        "“Larry the Bat!  The Gray Seal!  By God!” choked the Magpie.  “You–\nyou–”  The Magpie’s flashlight, as he shifted it from his right\nhand to his left and wrenched out his revolver, had fallen upon two\nmen crouched close against the wall by the library door–and he\nscreamed out in an access of fury.  “De double cross!  A plant!  De\nbulls!  You damned snitch, Larry!” screamed out the Magpie–and\nfired.",
        "The bullet tore into the carpet beside Jimmie Dale.  Came answering\nshots from the men by the door; and then the Magpie, emptying his\nautomatic at the two men as he ran, the flame tongues cutting\nvicious lanes of fire through the darkness, dashed for the window.\nThere was a cry, the crash of a heavy body pitching to the floor–\nand the Magpie had flung himself out through the window, and in the\nmomentary ensuing silence within the room came the sound of his\nfootsteps running on the gravel below.",
        "There was a low moan, the movement as of some one staggering and\nlurching around–and then the lights went on.  But for an instant\nJimmie Dale did not move.  He was staring at the form of a man still\nand motionless on the floor in front of him–the man who had posed\nas Henry LaSalle.  Dead!  The man was dead!  His mind ran riot for a\nmoment.  Where were the others–were there only these two?  Only\nthese two in the house!  Only these two–and one was dead!  And then\nJimmie Dale was on his feet.  One was dead–but there was still the\nother, the man who was reeling there, back turned to him, by the\nelectric-light switch.  But even as Jimmie Dale sprang forward, this\nsecond man, clawing at the wall for support, slipped to his knees\nand fell upon the carpet.",
        "Jimmie Dale reached him, snatched the revolver from his hand, and\nbent over him.  It was the man whose name he did not know, but whose\nface he had reason enough to know too well–it was the leader of the\nCrime Club.",
        "The man, though evidently badly wounded, smiled defiantly in spite\nof his pain.",
        "“So you’re the Gray Seal!” he flung out contemptuously.  “A clever\nenough safe-cracker–but only a lowbrow, like the rest of them.\nAnother illusion dispelled!  Well, you’ve got the money–better run,\nhadn’t you?”",
        "Jimmie Dale made no answer.  Satisfied that the man was too badly\nhurt to move, he went and bent over the silent form in the centre of\nthe room.  A moment’s examination was enough.  “Henry LaSalle” was\ndead.",
        "He stood there looking down at the man.  It was what he had come\nfor–though it was the Magpie, not himself, who had accomplished it!\nThe man was dead!  The words began to run through his mind in a\nqueer reiteration.  The man was dead–the man was dead!  He checked\nhimself sharply.  He must think now–think fast, and think RIGHT.",
        "The Magpie knew that Larry the Bat was the Gray Seal–and as fast as\nthe Magpie could get there, the news would spread like wildfire\nthrough the underworld.  “Death to the Gray Seal!  Death to the Gray\nSeal!”  He could hear that slogan ringing again in his ears, but as\nhe had never heard it before–with a snarl of triumph now as of\nwolves who at last had pulled their quarry down.  He had not a\nsecond to spare–and yet–that man wounded there on the floor!  What\nof him–guilty of murder, the brains of this inhuman, monstrous\norganisation, the one to whom, more even than to that dead man, the\nTocsin owed the horror and the misery and the grief and despair that\nhad come into her life!  What of him?  What of the Crime Club here?\nWhat of this nest of vipers?  Were they to escape?  Were they to–",
        "With a sudden, low exclamation, Jimmie Dale jumped for the table,\nand, snatching up the telephone, rattled the hook violently.",
        "“Give me\"–his voice came in well-simulated gasps, each like a man\nfighting for every word–\"give me–police–headquarters!  Quick!\nQUICK!  I’ve–been–shot!”",
        "The wounded man on the floor raised himself on his elbow.",
        "“What are you doing?” he demanded in a startled way.  “Are you mad!\nThank your stars you were lucky enough to get out of this alive–and\nget out now, while you have the chance!”",
        "Jimmie Dale pressed his hand firmly over the mouthpiece of the\ntelephone.",
        "“I’ll go,” he said, with a cold smile, “when I’ve settled with you–\nfor the murder of Henry LaSalle.”",
        "“That man!” ejaculated the man scornfully, pointing to the form on\nthe floor.  “So that’s your game!  Going to try and cover your\ntracks!  Why, you fool, I LIVE here!  Do you think the police would\nimagine for an instant that I killed him?”",
        "“I said–HENRY LASALLE,” said Jimmie Dale evenly.",
        "The man came farther up on his elbow, a sudden look of fear in his\nface.",
        "“What–what do you mean?” he cried hoarsely.",
        "But Jimmie Dale was talking again into the telephone–gasping,\nchoking out his words as before:",
        "“Police headquarters?  I’m Henry LaSalle.  Fifth Avenue.  I–I’ve\nbeen shot.  Take down this statement.  I’ll–I’ll be dead before you\nget here–I’m not the real Henry LaSalle at all.  We murdered Henry\nLaSalle–in Australia, and murdered Peter LaSalle here.  We–we\ntried to kill the daughter, but she ran away.  This house has been\nour headquarters for the last five years.  The man who shot me to-\nnight is the leader of the gang.  We quarrelled over the division of\na haul.  He’s here on the floor now, wounded.  Get them all, get\nthem all, damn them!–do you hear?–get them all!  They’re out of\nthe house now, but lay a trap for them.  They always come in through\nthe garage on the side street.  Oh, God, I’m done for!  Break down\nthe west walls of the rooms upstairs–if–you–want proof of what–\nthe gang’s been doing.  Hurry!  Hurry!  I’m–I’m–done for–I–”",
        "Jimmie Dale permitted the telephone to drop with a clash from his\nhand to the table.",
        "The face of the man on the floor was livid.",
        "“Who are you?  In God’s name, who are you?” he cried out wildly.",
        "“Does it matter?” inquired Jimmie Dale grimly.  “Your game is up.\nYou’ll go to the chair for the murder of ’Henry LaSalle’–if it is\nby proxy!  Those rooms upstairs alone are enough to damn you, to\nprove every word of that dying “confession\"–but to-morrow, added to\nit, will come the story of Marie LaSalle herself.”",
        "For a moment the man hung there swaying on his elbow, his face\nworking in ghastly fashion–and then suddenly, with a strange laugh,\nhe carried one hand swiftly to his mouth–and laughed again–and\nbefore Jimmie Dale could reach him was lifeless on the floor.",
        "A tiny vial rolled away upon the carpet.  Jimmie Dale picked it up.\nA drop or two of liquid still remained in it–colourless, clear,\nlike that liquid this same man had dropped into the rabbit’s mouth\nthe night before, like the liquid in the glasses they had carried\ninto that third room, like the liquid that his man had said was from\na formula of their own, that was instantaneous in its action, that\ndefied detection by autopsy!",
        "The set, stern features of Jimmie Dale relaxed.  It was justice–but\nit was also death.  In a surge of emotion, the events of scarcely\nmore than twenty-four hours, began to crowd upon him–and then,\nominously dominant, above all else, that slogan of the underworld,\n\"Death to the Gray Seal!” came ringing once more in his ears.  It\nbrought him, with a startled movement of his hand across his eyes,\nto a realisation of his own desperate position.  Yes, yes, he must\ngo!  The way was clear now for the Tocsin–clear now for her!",
        "He dropped the vial into his pocket, and, running to the safe,\nquickly scraped the gray seal from the dial’s knob; then he drew the\npackages of money from his shirt and pockets and tossed them on the\nfloor among the litter of papers already there–she would get it\nback again when it had served its purpose, it would be self-evident\nthat it was the proceeds of that day’s sale of the estate’s\nsecurities over which the “quarrel” had occurred!",
        "And now the window!  He ran to it, closed it, and LOCKED it; then,\nlaying the revolver he had taken from the leader down beside the\nman, he stepped across the room again and drew the body of “Henry\nLaSalle” closer to the table–as though the man had fallen there\nwhen the telephone had dropped from his hand.",
        "It was done now!  On the floor beside him lay each man’s weapon–and\nboth of the revolvers had been discharged several times.  Jimmie\nDale paused on the library threshold for a final survey of the room.\nIt was done!  The way was clear–for her.  And now if he could only\nsave himself!  There was no chance for Larry the Bat!  Could he\nsave–JIMMIE DALE!",
        "He crossed the hall, a queer, half-grim, half-wistful smile on his\nlips, unlocked the front door, stepped out, locked it behind him–\nand in another moment, doubling around the corner, was running along\nlike a hare along the side street.",
        "On Jimmie Dale ran.  Across on Fourth Avenue he swung on a car that\ntook him to Astor Place.  Then striking east once more, making a\ndetour to avoid the Bowery, he ran on at top speed again.  To reach\nthe Sanctuary, not before the Magpie should have spread the alarm,\nthat was impossible, but to reach it before the underworld should\nhave had time to recover its breath, as it were, before the\nunderworld should have had time to act–that was his only chance!\nThe Magpie had, at the outside, a start of fifteen minutes; but he,\nJimmie Dale, had probably retrieved five minutes of that in the time\nhe had made in getting downtown.  That left the Magpie ten to the\ngood.  How long would it take the Magpie to bring the underworld\nswarming like hornets around the Sanctuary?",
        "On Larry the Bat ran.  At the Sanctuary were the clothes, the\nbelongings of Jimmie Dale.  Could he save Jimmie Dale!  If he could\nget there, change, and get out again, the way was clear for him–as\nclear as for the Tocsin now.  In a few hours the police would have\nevery member of the Crime Club in the trap; there would be no watch\nany more around his house on Riverside Drive; and he would be free\nto return there and resume his normal life as Jimmie Dale again if\nhe could make the Sanctuary in time!  But let the Magpie get there\nfirst, let the underworld tear the place to pieces in its fury as it\nwould do, let them discover that hiding place under the flooring,\nfor instance, and the Gray Seal would not be merely Larry the Bat,\nbut Jimmie Dale as well, and–a cry escaped him even as he ran–it\nmeant ruin, the disgrace of an honoured name, death, crimes without\nnumber at his door.  Crimes!  The Gray Seal had never committed a\ncrime!  But the crimes attributed to the Gray Seal he could not\ndisprove, not one of them!  He had meant them to appear as crimes–\nand he had succeeded so well that the Gray Seal’s name, execrated,\nwas a synonym for the most callous, dangerous, and unscrupulous\ncriminal of the age!",
        "He was gasping for breath as finally, making for the side door, he\ndarted into the alleyway that flanked the Sanctuary.  What story\nwould the Magpie tell?  Not the truth, of course–that would let the\nMagpie in for what had happened that night, for the Magpie must be\nwell aware that he had shot at least one of the two men in that\nroom.  But the truth wasn’t necessary; it was foreign, and had no\nbearing on the one outstanding fact–the Gray Seal was Larry the\nBat.  At the present moment the Magpie had a double incentive for\n\"getting” the Gray Seal–the Gray Seal was the only one who could\nprove murder against him that night in the LaSalle mansion.  And\nafterwards, when the police version of the affair was made public,\nthe Magpie, to save himself, would be careful enough to do or say\nnothing to contradict “Henry LaSalle’s” confession!",
        "Larry the Bat slipped in through the door, halted there, listened;\nand then began to mount the rickety stairs, with his silent tread.\nAt the top he paused again.  Nothing–no sound!  They were not here\nyet–so far he was in time!  He stepped to the Sanctuary door,\nunlocked it, passed into the squalid, miserable room that had\nharboured him for so long as Larry the Bat, locked the door behind\nhim, crossed quickly to the window to make sure that the shutters\nwere closed–and then, for the first time, as the gray light\nstreaked in through the interstices, he was conscious that it was\nalready dawn.  So much the more need for haste then!",
        "He whipped out his revolver and laid it at his hand on the\ndilapidated table; then the flooring in the corner was up in an\ninstant, and he began to strip off the rags of Larry the Bat.\nBoots, mismated socks, the torn, patched trousers, the greasy\nflannel shirt, the threadbare coat, the nondescript slouch hat were\nthrown in a pile on the floor; and with them, from their hiding-\nplace, the grease paints and heterogeneous collection of make-up\naccessories.  This done, he began to slip on the clothes of Jimmie\nDale; and, when half dressed, turned to the table again to remove\nthe characteristic grime, stain, and paint of Larry the Bat from\nface, hands, wrists, throat, and neck.  This was a longer, more\narduous task.  He reached for the cracked pitcher to pour more water\ninto the basin–and, snatching up his revolver instead, whirled to\nface the door.",
        "Some one was outside!  He had caught the creak of a footstep upon\nthe stairs.  In a flash he was across the room and crouched by the\ndoor.  Yes, the step was nearer now–at the head of the stairs–on\nthe landing.  His revolver lifted, holding a steady bead on the door\npanel.  And then there came a low voice:",
        "“Jimmie!  Jimmie!  Are you there?  Quick, Jimmie!  Are you there?”",
        "The Tocsin!  What was she doing here!  Why had he not warned her up\nthere on the avenue, fool that he was, that of all places she was to\nkeep away from here!",
        "She slipped into the room as he unlocked the door.",
        "“They’re coming, Jimmie!” she panted breathlessly.  “There’s not an\ninstant to lose!  Listen!  When the Magpie ran from the house, I ran\nwith him–but it\"–she tried to smile–\"it wasn’t to obey you, to\nrun away–I had made up my mind I wouldn’t do that–it was to find\nout from him what had happened.  He told me you were the Gray Seal.\nHe did not suspect me.  He thinks you were no more than just Larry\nthe Bat to me, as you were to everybody else.  He went straight to\nChicago Ike’s gambling rooms and found the Skeeter’s gang there–you\nknow them, Red Mose, the Midget, Harve Thoms, and the Skeeter–you\nremember your fight with them over old Luddy’s diamonds!  Well, they\nhave not forgotten, either!  They are on their way here, now!  The\nnews that you are the Gray Seal is travelling like lightning all\nthrough the underworld–there will be a mob here on the Skeeter’s\nheels.  So, Jimmie–quick!  Run!”",
        "Run!  Half Larry the Bat, half Jimmie Dale–and run!  In another\nfive minutes, perhaps–yes.  But there probably would not be five\nminutes–and she–if she were found here!",
        "“Yes,” he said quietly.  “I’ll get away in a moment.  You go at\nonce.  I’ll\"–he was smiling at her reassuringly–\"I’ll meet you at–”",
        "She looked at him then for an instant–interrupting him quickly, as\nshe shook her head.",
        "“I didn’t notice, Jimmie.  You cannot go like that–can you?  It\nwould be even worse than being caught as Larry the Bat.  Hurry\nthen–I am not going without you.”",
        "“No!” he said.  “Go now!  Go at once, Marie–while you can.  You\nhave risked your life as it is to come here and tell me this.  For\nGod’s sake, go now!”",
        "The great, brown eyes were smiling bravely through a sudden mist.\nShe shook her head again.",
        "“Not without you, Jimmie.”",
        "It brought a fierce, wild throb of joy upon him–and then a cold,\nsickening fear.",
        "“Listen!” he cried out desperately.  “You must go now!  You cannot\ntake any chances now, Marie.  Everything is right for you.  That man\nwho posed as your uncle is dead–the leader of the Crime Club is\ndead.  Don’t you understand what that means!  You have only to be\nMarie LaSalle again and claim your own.  I cannot tell you all now–\nthere’s no time.  That house was the Crime Club itself.  The police\nwill get them all.  Don’t you see!  Don’t you see!  Everything is\nclear for you now–and now go!  Go–you must go!”",
        "She was staring at him, a strange wonder in her face.",
        "“Clear!  All clear–for me!  I–I can go back to–to my own life\nagain!”  It was as though she were whispering some amazing thing of\nunbelievable joy to herself.",
        "“YES!” he cried out again.  “Yes!  But go–go, Marie!”",
        "But now, for answer, suddenly she reached out and took the key from\nthe door and put it in the pocket of her dress.",
        "“We will go together, Jimmie–or not at all,” she said simply.  “We\nare wasting precious moments.  Hurry and dress!”",
        "He hesitated miserably.  What could he do–if she WOULD not go!  And\nit was true–the moments were flying.  Better, rather than futile\nargument, to use them as she said.  There was still a chance!  Why\nnot!  Five minutes!  He could do better than that!  He MUST do\nbetter than that!",
        "Without a word, he ran back across the room.  In frantic haste, from\nface, hands, wrists, and neck came the stain.  There was still time.\nShe was standing there by the door, listening.  She, the Tocsin, she\nwhom he loved, she who, all through the years that had gone, had\nbeen so strangely elusive and yet so intimately a part of his life,\nSHE was standing there now, here with him–in peril with every\nsecond that passed!",
        "He had only to slip on his coat and vest now–and make a bundle of\nLarry the Bat’s things on the floor, so that he could carry them\naway to destroy them.  He stooped to gather up the clothes–and\nstraightened suddenly–and jumped toward the door again.",
        "“They are coming, Jimmie!” she called, in a low voice.  But he had\nalready heard them–the stairs were creaking loudly under the tread\nof many feet.  He pushed the Tocsin hurriedly back against the wall\nat the side of the door.",
        "“Stand there!” he said, under his breath.  “Out of the line of fire!\nDon’t move!”",
        "There was a rush against the door–and then a voice growled:",
        "“Aw, cut dat out!  Wot do youse want to do–scare him away by\nbustin’ it!  Pick de lock, an’ we’ll lay for him inside till he\nshows up.”",
        "It was the Skeeter’s voice.  The Skeeter and his gang–the worst\napaches in the city of New York!  Professional assassins, death\ncontractors, he had called them–and the lowest bidders!  A man’s\nlife any time for twenty-five dollars!  No, they were not likely to\nforget the affair of the pushcart man, to forget old Luddy and his\ndiamonds, to forget–the Gray Seal!  And they were only the vanguard\nof what was to come!",
        "Some one was working at the lock now.  There was one way to stop\nthat.  It would not take them long to find out that he WAS there\nonce the door was opened!  Better know it with the door SHUT!\nJimmie Dale lifted his revolver coolly and fired through the panel.",
        "A burst of yells answered the shot; and among them, high above the\nothers, the Magpie’s scream:",
        "“We got him!  We got him!  He’s dere now!”",
        "And then it seemed that pandemonium broke loose–there was a volley\nof shots, the bullets splintering through the door panels as from a\nmachine gun, so fast they came–and then another rush against the\ndoor.",
        "Flat on the floor, but well back and to one side, Jimmie Dale fired\nsteadily–again and again.",
        "Came screams of pain, yells, and oaths–and they fell back from the\ndoor.",
        "And now from above, from overhead, came tumult–windows thrown up,\nthe stamp of feet, cries of fright.  And from the street, a low,\nsullen roar.  The underworld was gathering fast!",
        "Once more the rush upon the door–and Jimmie Dale, a grim, twisted\nsmile upon his lips, emptied his revolver into the panels.  Once\nmore they fell back–and then there came the Skeeter’s voice,\nsnarling like an infuriated beast:",
        "“He’ll get de lot of us like dis!  Cut it out!  Besides, we’ll have\nde bulls down here in a minute–an’ he’s OUR meat, not theirs.\nDey’d be too damned soft wid him–dey’d only send him to de chair.\nYouse chase upstairs, Mose, an’ pass de word to beat it–an’ beat it\nquick.  We’ll BURN de skunk out–dat’s wot.  An’ de bulls can stand\nalongside an’ watch, if dey likes–but he’s our meat.”",
        "Jimmie Dale did not dare to look at the Tocsin’s face.  Mechanically\nhe refilled the magazine of his automatic–and lay there, waiting.\nThe roar from the street grew louder.  They seemed to be fighting\nout there, as though an inadequate number of police were trying to\ndisperse a mob–and not succeeding!  Pretty soon, with the riot call\nin, there would probably be a battle–for the Gray Seal!  Sublime\nirony!  It was death at the hands of either one!",
        "Children whimpered on the stairs outside, men swore, women cried,\nfeet shuffled hurriedly by as the tenement emptied.  Occasionally, a\npertinent invitation to him to remain where he was, there was a\nvicious rip through the panel, and the drumming whir of a bullet\nflying through the room.  And then a curious, ominous crackling\nsound–and then the smell of smoke.",
        "Jimmie Dale stood up, his face drawn and haggard.  The tenement\nwould go like matchwood, burn like a bonfire, with any kind of a\nstart–and there was no doubt about the start!  The Skeeter, the\nMagpie, and the rest would have seen that it had headway enough to\nserve their purpose before either firemen or police could thwart\nthem.  He, Jimmie Dale, could take his choice: walk out into a\nbullet, or stay there and–he smiled miserably as his eyes fell upon\nthe pile of Larry the Bat’s clothing on the floor.  There was no\nlonger need to worry about ITS destruction–the fire would take care\nof that only too well!  And then a low, bitter cry came to his lips,\nand he clenched his hands.  If it were only himself–only himself!\nHe crossed to the Tocsin and caught her in his arms.",
        "“Oh, my God–Marie!” he faltered.",
        "The cape and hood had fallen from her, and with the hood had fallen\nthe gray-streaked hair of Silver Mag–and now as she smiled at him\nit was from a face that was very beautiful and very brave and very\nfull of tenderness.",
        "And he held her there–and neither spoke.",
        "It seeped in under the threshold of the door, it came from\neverywhere, filling the room–the black, strangling smoke.  Outside\nin the hall all was silence now–save for that crackle of flame that\ngrew in volume, that came now in quick, sharp reports, like revolver\nshots.  From out in the street swelled a cry: “Death to the Gray\nSeal!”  Then the clang of bells, the roar and rattle of fire\napparatus, strident voices bellowing orders, and the crowd again,\nblood hungry: “Death to the Gray Seal!”",
        "There was a chance, just one–if the fire had no headway along the\nupper end of the landing–and if they had not thought to set a watch\nfor him ABOVE!  They–the Magpie, the Skeeter, and his gang–must\nhave been driven even out of the house now by the smoke and flame.",
        "“Give me the key, I am going to open the door, Marie,” he said\nquietly.  “Cover your face with a handkerchief, anything, and run to\nthe LEFT to the next flight of stairs.  There are two flats above\nthis–we’ll make the roof if we can.  Now–are you ready?”",
        "It was an instant before she answered, an instant in which she\nlifted her face to his, and held his face between her two hands–and\nthen:",
        "“I am ready, Jimmie.”",
        "He flung open the door, his arm around her to help her forward–and\ninstinctively, with a cry, fell back for a moment.  With the inrush\nof the draft poured the smoke, and through it, lurid, yellow, showed\nthe flames leaping from the stair well.",
        "And then all was blind madness.  Together they ran.  At the foot of\nthe stairs she fell, recovered herself, staggered up another–and\nfell again.  He caught her up in his arms and, staggering now as she\nhad staggered, went on.  His lungs seemed to be bursting.  His limbs\ngrew weak and trembled under him.  He could not see or breathe.  The\nnauseating fumes suffocated him, bringing an intolerable agony.  He\ngained the first landing above.  There was one more–one more!  If\nhe could only rest here for a moment!  Yes, that was it–rest.  It\nwasn’t so bad here now.  She stirred in his arms, struggled to her\nfeet–and he was helping her on again, and up the next flight of\nstairs.",
        "And suddenly he found himself laughing in hysteria–for they were\nclimbing a half stair, half ladderway at the end of the upper\nlanding, and the open skylight was above them, and they were\ndrinking in the pure, fresh air–and now they were out upon the\nroof, and the roar from the street was in their ears, like the roar\nof great waters from some canyon far below.  Jimmie Dale tried to\nspeak, and found his lips were cracked and dry.  He wet them with\nhis tongue.",
        "“Don’t stand up–we’d be seen–CRAWL,” he mumbled hoarsely.",
        "It took a long time–over one roof, and then another, and yet\nanother–and then through the skylight of a tenement whose occupants\nwere either craning from the front windows, or were on the street\nbelow.  It was, perhaps, half an hour–and then they, too, were\nstanding in the street, and all about them the crowd was shouting in\nwild excitement.",
        "Up the block, inside the fire lines, the Sanctuary was blazing\nfuriously–and now suddenly the wall seemed to bulge outward.  It\nbrought a yell from the crowd:",
        "“Death to the Gray Seal!”",
        "She pulled at his arm.",
        "“Let us get away!  Let us get away, Jimmie!” she whispered\nfrantically.",
        "A strange smile was on Jimmie Dale’s lips.",
        "“We’re safe now–for always,” he whispered back.  “Look!”",
        "The Sanctuary wall bulged farther outward, seemed to hang an instant\nhesitant in mid-air–and fell with a mighty crash.",
        "The Gray Seal was dead!",
