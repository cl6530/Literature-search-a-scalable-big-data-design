        "HALF the world, it is said, knows not how the other\nhalf live. Our Exploring Expedition saw the Feejee\nislanders getting their dinner off human bones; and\nthey are said to eat their own wives and children.\nThe husbandry of the modern inhabitants of Gournou\n(west of old Thebes) is philosophical to a fault. To\nset up their housekeeping nothing is requisite but\ntwo or three earthen pots, a stone to grind meal, and\na mat which is the bed. The house, namely a tomb, is\nready without rent or taxes. No rain can pass through\nthe roof, and there is no door, for there is no want\nof one, as there is nothing to lose. If the house do\nnot please them, they walk out and enter another, as\nthere are several hundreds at their command. “It is\nsomewhat singular,” adds Belzoni, to whom we owe this\naccount, “to talk of happiness among people who live\nin sepulchres, among the corpses and rags of an ancient\nnation which they know nothing of.” In the deserts of\nBorgoo the rock-Tibboos still dwell in caves, like\ncliff-swallows, and the language of these negroes is\ncompared by their neighbors to the shrieking of bats\nand to the whistling of birds. Again, the Bornoos have\nno proper names; individuals are called after their\nheight, thickness, or other accidental quality, and\nhave nicknames merely. But the salt, the dates, the\nivory, and the gold, for which these horrible regions\nare visited, find their way into countries where the\npurchaser and consumer can hardly be ranked in one\nrace with these cannibals and man-stealers; countries\nwhere man serves himself with metals, wood, stone,\nglass, gum, cotton, silk, and wool; honors himself with\narchitecture; writes laws, and contrives to execute his\nwill through the hands of many nations; and, especially,\nestablishes a select society, running through all the\ncountries of intelligent men, a self-constituted\naristocracy, or fraternity of the best, which, without\nwritten law or exact usage of any kind, perpetuates\nitself, colonizes every new-planted island and adopts\nand makes its own whatever personal beauty or extraordinary\nnative endowment anywhere appears.",
        "What fact more conspicuous in modern history than\nthe creation of the gentleman? Chivalry is that,\nand loyalty is that, and, in English literature,\nhalf the drama, and all the novels, from Sir Philip\nSidney to Sir Walter Scott, paint this figure. The\nword gentleman, which, like the word Christian, must\nhereafter characterize the present and the few\npreceding centuries by the importance attached to\nit, is a homage to personal and incommunicable\nproperties. Frivolous and fantastic additions have\ngot associated with the name, but the steady interest\nof mankind in it must be attributed to the valuable\nproperties which it designates. An element which\nunites all the most forcible persons of every\ncountry; makes them intelligible and agreeable to\neach other, and is somewhat so precise that it is\nat once felt if an individual lack the masonic sign,—\ncannot be any casual product, but must be an average\nresult of the character and faculties universally\nfound in men. It seems a certain permanent average;\nas the atmosphere is a permanent composition, whilst\nso many gases are combined only to be decompounded.\nComme il faut, is the Frenchman’s description of good\nSociety: as we must be. It is a spontaneous fruit of\ntalents and feelings of precisely that class who have\nmost vigor, who take the lead in the world of this\nhour, and though far from pure, far from constituting\nthe gladdest and highest tone of human feeling, is as\ngood as the whole society permits it to be. It is made\nof the spirit, more than of the talent of men, and is\na compound result into which every great force enters\nas an ingredient, namely virtue, wit, beauty, wealth,\nand power.",
        "There is something equivocal in all the words in\nuse to express the excellence of manners and social\ncultivation, because the quantities are fluxional,\nand the last effect is assumed by the senses as the\ncause.  The word gentleman has not any correlative\nabstract to express the quality. Gentility is mean,\nand gentilesse is obsolete. But we must keep alive\nin the vernacular the distinction between fashion,\na word of narrow and often sinister meaning, and the\nheroic character which the gentleman imports. The\nusual words, however, must be respected; they will\nbe found to contain the root of the matter. The point\nof distinction in all this class of names, as courtesy,\nchivalry, fashion, and the like, is that the flower\nand fruit, not the grain of the tree, are contemplated.\nIt is beauty which is the aim this time, and not worth.\nThe result is now in question, although our words\nintimate well enough the popular feeling that the\nappearance supposes a substance. The gentleman is a\nman of truth, lord of his own actions, and expressing\nthat lordship in his behavior, not in any manner\ndependent and servile, either on persons, or opinions,\nor possessions. Beyond this fact of truth and real\nforce, the word denotes good-nature or benevolence:\nmanhood first, and then gentleness. The popular notion\ncertainly adds a condition of ease and fortune; but\nthat is a natural result of personal force and love,\nthat they should possess and dispense the goods of the\nworld. In times of violence, every eminent person must\nfall in with many opportunities to approve his stoutness\nand worth; therefore every man’s name that emerged at\nall from the mass in the feudal ages, rattles in our\near like a flourish of trumpets. But personal force\nnever goes out of fashion.  That is still paramount\nto-day, and in the moving crowd of good society the\nmen of valor and reality are known and rise to their\nnatural place. The competition is transferred from war\nto politics and trade, but the personal force appears\nreadily enough in these new arenas.",
        "Power first, or no leading class. In politics and\nin trade, bruisers and pirates are of better promise\nthan talkers and clerks. God knows that all sorts of\ngentlemen knock at the door; but whenever used in\nstrictness and with any emphasis, the name will be\nfound to point at original energy. It describes a man\nstanding in his own right and working after untaught\nmethods. In a good lord there must first be a good\nanimal, at least to the extent of yielding the\nincomparable advantage of animal spirits. The ruling\nclass must have more, but they must have these, giving\nin every company the sense of power, which makes things\neasy to be done which daunt the wise. The society of\nthe energetic class, in their friendly and festive\nmeetings, is full of courage and of attempts which\nintimidate the pale scholar. The courage which girls\nexhibit is like a battle of Lundy’s Lane, or a sea-\nfight. The intellect relies on memory to make some\nsupplies to face these extemporaneous squadrons. But\nmemory is a base mendicant with basket and badge, in\nthe presence of these sudden masters. The rulers of\nsociety must be up to the work of the world, and equal\nto their versatile office: men of the right Caesarian\npattern, who have great range of affinity. I am far\nfrom believing the timid maxim of Lord Falkland (\"that\nfor ceremony there must go two to it; since a bold\nfellow will go through the cunningest forms”), and am\nof opinion that the gentleman is the bold fellow whose\nforms are not to be broken through; and only that\nplenteous nature is rightful master which is the\ncomplement of whatever person it converses with. My\ngentleman gives the law where he is; he will outpray\nsaints in chapel, outgeneral veterans in the field, and\noutshine all courtesy in the hall. He is good company\nfor pirates and good with academicians; so that it is\nuseless to fortify yourself against him; he has the\nprivate entrance to all minds, and I could as easily\nexclude myself, as him. The famous gentlemen of Asia\nand Europe have been of this strong type; Saladin, Sapor,\nthe Cid, Julius Caesar, Scipio, Alexander, Pericles, and\nthe lordliest personages. They sat very carelessly in\ntheir chairs, and were too excellent themselves, to value\nany condition at a high rate.",
        "A plentiful fortune is reckoned necessary, in the\npopular judgment, to the completion of this man of\nthe world; and it is a material deputy which walks\nthrough the dance which the first has led. Money is\nnot essential, but this wide affinity is, which\ntranscends the habits of clique and caste and makes\nitself felt by men of all classes. If the aristocrat\nis only valid in fashionable circles and not with\ntruckmen, he will never be a leader in fashion; and\nif the man of the people cannot speak on equal terms\nwith the gentleman, so that the gentleman shall\nperceive that he is already really of his own order,\nhe is not to be feared. Diogenes, Socrates, and\nEpaminondas, are gentlemen of the best blood who have\nchosen the condition of poverty when that of wealth\nwas equally open to them. I use these old names, but\nthe men I speak of are my contemporaries. Fortune will\nnot supply to every generation one of these well-\nappointed knights, but every collection of men furnishes\nsome example of the class; and the politics of this\ncountry, and the trade of every town, are controlled by\nthese hardy and irresponsible doers, who have invention\nto take the lead, and a broad sympathy which puts them\nin fellowship with crowds, and makes their action\npopular.",
        "The manners of this class are observed and caught\nwith devotion by men of taste. The association of\nthese masters with each other and with men intelligent\nof their merits, is mutually agreeable and stimulating.\nThe good forms, the happiest expressions of each, are\nrepeated and adopted. By swift consent everything\nsuperfluous is dropped, everything graceful is renewed.\nFine manners show themselves formidable to the\nuncultivated man. They are a subtler science of defence\nto parry and intimidate; but once matched by the skill\nof the other party, they drop the point of the sword,\n—points and fences disappear, and the youth finds\nhimself in a more transparent atmosphere, wherein life\nis a less troublesome game, and not a misunderstanding\nrises between the players. Manners aim to facilitate\nlife, to get rid of impediments and bring the man pure\nto energize. They aid our dealing and conversation as a\nrailway aids travelling, by getting rid of all avoidable\nobstructions of the road and leaving nothing to be\nconquered but pure space. These forms very soon become\nfixed, and a fine sense of propriety is cultivated with\nthe more heed that it becomes a badge of social and\ncivil distinctions. Thus grows up Fashion, an equivocal\nsemblance, the most puissant, the most fantastic and\nfrivolous, the most feared and followed, and which morals\nand violence assault in vain.",
        "There exists a strict relation between the class\nof power and the exclusive and polished circles.\nThe last are always filled or filling from the\nfirst. The strong men usually give some allowance\neven to the petulances of fashion, for that affinity\nthey find in it. Napoleon, child of the revolution,\ndestroyer of the old noblesse, never ceased to court\nthe Faubourg St. Germain; doubtless with the feeling\nthat fashion is a homage to men of his stamp. Fashion,\nthough in a strange way, represents all manly virtue.\nIt is virtue gone to seed: it is a kind of posthumous\nhonor. It does not often caress the great, but the\nchildren of the great: it is a hall of the Past. It\nusually sets its face against the great of this hour.\nGreat men are not commonly in its halls; they are\nabsent in the field: they are working, not triumphing.\nFashion is made up of their children; of those who\nthrough the value and virtue of somebody, have acquired\nlustre to their name, marks of distinction, means of\ncultivation and generosity, and, in their physical\norganization a certain health and excellence which\nsecures to them, if not the highest power to work, yet\nhigh power to enjoy. The class of power, the working\nheroes, the Cortez, the Nelson, the Napoleon, see that\nthis is the festivity and permanent celebration of such\nas they; that fashion is funded talent; is Mexico,\nMarengo, and Trafalgar beaten out thin; that the\nbrilliant names of fashion run back to just such busy\nnames as their own, fifty or sixty years ago. They are\nthe sowers, their sons shall be the reapers, and their\nsons, in the ordinary course of things, must yield the\npossession of the harvest to new competitors with keener\neyes and stronger frames. The city is recruited from the\ncountry. In the year 1805, it is said, every legitimate\nmonarch in Europe was imbecile. The city would have died\nout, rotted, and exploded, long ago, but that it was\nreinforced from the fields. It is only country which\ncame to town day before yesterday that is city and court\ntoday.",
        "Aristocracy and fashion are certain inevitable\nresults. These mutual selections are indestructible.\nIf they provoke anger in the least favored class,\nand the excluded majority revenge themselves on the\nexcluding minority by the strong hand and kill them,\nat once a new class finds itself at the top, as\ncertainly as cream rises in a bowl of milk: and if\nthe people should destroy class after class, until\ntwo men only were left, one of these would be the\nleader and would be involuntarily served and copied\nby the other. You may keep this minority out of sight\nand out of mind, but it is tenacious of life, and is\none of the estates of the realm. I am the more struck\nwith this tenacity, when I see its work. It respects\nthe administration of such unimportant matters, that\nwe should not look for any durability in its rule. We\nsometimes meet men under some strong moral influence,\nas a patriotic, a literary, a religious movement, and\nfeel that the moral sentiment rules man and nature.\nWe think all other distinctions and ties will be slight\nand fugitive, this of caste or fashion for example;\nyet come from year to year and see how permanent that\nis, in this Boston or New York life of man, where too\nit has not the least countenance from the law of the\nland.  Not in Egypt or in India a firmer or more\nimpassable line. Here are associations whose ties go\nover and under and through it, a meeting of merchants,\na military corps, a college class, a fire-club, a\nprofessional association, a political, a religious\nconvention;—the persons seem to draw inseparably near;\nyet, that assembly once dispersed, its members will not\nin the year meet again. Each returns to his degree in\nthe scale of good society, porcelain remains porcelain,\nand earthen earthen. The objects of fashion may be\nfrivolous, or fashion may be objectless, but the nature\nof this union and selection can be neither frivolous\nnor accidental. Each man’s rank in that perfect\ngraduation depends on some symmetry in his structure or\nsome agreement in his structure to the symmetry of society.\nIts doors unbar instantaneously to a natural claim of\ntheir own kind. A natural gentleman finds his way in, and\nwill keep the oldest patrician out who has lost his\nintrinsic rank. Fashion understands itself; good-breeding\nand personal superiority of whatever country readily\nfraternize with those of every other. The chiefs of savage\ntribes have distinguished themselves in London and Paris,\nby the purity of their tournure.",
        "To say what good of fashion we can, it rests on\nreality, and hates nothing so much as pretenders;\nto exclude and mystify pretenders and send them\ninto everlasting ’Coventry,’ is its delight. We\ncontemn in turn every other gift of men of the\nworld; but the habit even in little and the least\nmatters of not appealing to any but our own sense\nof propriety, constitutes the foundation of all\nchivalry. There is almost no kind of self-reliance,\nso it be sane and proportioned, which fashion does\nnot occasionally adopt and give it the freedom of\nits saloons. A sainted soul is always elegant, and,\nif it will, passes unchallenged into the most guarded\nring. But so will Jock the teamster pass, in some\ncrisis that brings him thither, and find favor, as\nlong as his head is not giddy with the new circumstance,\nand the iron shoes do not wish to dance in waltzes and\ncotillons. For there is nothing settled in manners,\nbut the laws of behavior yield to the energy of the\nindividual. The maiden at her first ball, the country-\nman at a city dinner, believes that there is a ritual\naccording to which every act and compliment must be\nperformed, or the failing party must be cast out of\nthis presence. Later they learn that good sense and\ncharacter make their own forms every moment, and speak\nor abstain, take wine or refuse it, stay or go, sit in\na chair or sprawl with children on the floor, or stand\non their head, or what else soever, in a new and\naboriginal way; and that strong will is always in fashion,\nlet who will be unfashionable. All that fashion demands\nis composure and self-content. A circle of men perfectly\nwell-bred would be a company of sensible persons in which\nevery man’s native manners and character appeared. If the\nfashionist have not this quality, he is nothing. We are\nsuch lovers of self-reliance that we excuse in a man many\nsins if he will show us a complete satisfaction in his\nposition, which asks no leave to be, of mine, or any\nman’s good opinion. But any deference to some eminent\nman or woman of the world, forfeits all privilege of\nnobility.  He is an underling: I have nothing to do with\nhim; I will speak with his master. A man should not go\nwhere he cannot carry his whole sphere or society with\nhim,—not bodily, the whole circle of his friends, but\natmospherically. He should preserve in a new company the\nsame attitude of mind and reality of relation which his\ndaily associates draw him to, else he is shorn of his\nbest beams, and will be an orphan in the merriest club.\n“If you could see Vich Ian Vohr with his tail on!—” But\nVich Ian Vohr must always carry his belongings in some\nfashion, if not added as honor, then severed as disgrace.",
        "There will always be in society certain persons who\nare mercuries of its approbation, and whose glance\nwill at any time determine for the curious their\nstanding in the world. These are the chamberlains of\nthe lesser gods. Accept their coldness as an omen of\ngrace with the loftier deities, and allow them all their\nprivilege. They are clear in their office, nor could\nthey be thus formidable without their own merits. But\ndo not measure the importance of this class by their\npretension, or imagine that a fop can be the dispenser\nof honor and shame. They pass also at their just rate;\nfor how can they otherwise, in circles which exist as\na sort of herald’s office for the sifting of character?",
        "As the first thing man requires of man is reality,\nso that appears in all the forms of society. We\npointedly, and by name, introduce the parties to\neach other. Know you before all heaven and earth,\nthat this is Andrew, and this is Gregory,—they\nlook each other in the eye; they grasp each other’s\nhand, to identify and signalize each other. It is a\ngreat satisfaction. A gentleman never dodges; his\neyes look straight forward, and he assures the other\nparty, first of all, that he has been met. For what\nis it that we seek, in so many visits and hospitalities?\nIs it your draperies, pictures, and decorations? Or do\nwe not insatiably ask, Was a man in the house? I may\neasily go into a great household where there is much\nsubstance, excellent provision for comfort, luxury,\nand taste, and yet not encounter there any Amphitryon\nwho shall subordinate these appendages. I may go into\na cottage, and find a farmer who feels that he is the\nman I have come to see, and fronts me accordingly. It\nwas therefore a very natural point of old feudal\netiquette that a gentleman who received a visit,\nthough it were of his sovereign, should not leave his\nroof, but should wait his arrival at the door of his\nhouse. No house, though it were the Tuileries or the\nEscurial, is good for anything without a master. And\nyet we are not often gratified by this hospitality.\nEvery body we know surrounds himself with a fine house,\nfine books, conservatory, gardens, equipage and all\nmanner of toys, as screens to interpose between himself\nand his guest. Does it not seem as if man was of a very\nsly, elusive nature, and dreaded nothing so much as a\nfull rencontre front to front with his fellow? It were\nunmerciful, I know, quite to abolish the use of these\nscreens, which are of eminent convenience, whether the\nguest is too great or too little. We call together many\nfriends who keep each other in play, or by luxuries and\nornaments we amuse the young people, and guard our\nretirement. Or if perchance a searching realist comes\nto our gate, before whose eye we have no care to stand,\nthen again we run to our curtain, and hide ourselves as\nAdam at the voice of the Lord God in the garden. Cardinal\nCaprara, the Pope’s legate at Paris, defended himself\nfrom the glances of Napoleon by an immense pair of green\nspectacles. Napoleon remarked them, and speedily managed\nto rally them off: and yet Napoleon, in his turn, was not\ngreat enough with eight hundred thousand troops at his\nback, to face a pair of freeborn eyes, but fenced himself\nwith etiquette and within triple barriers of reserve; and,\nas all the world knows from Madame de Stael, was wont,\nwhen he found himself observed, to discharge his face of\nall expression. But emperors and rich men are by no means\nthe most skilful masters of good manners. No rentroll nor\narmy-list can dignify skulking and dissimulation; and the\nfirst point of courtesy must always be truth, as really\nall the forms of good-breeding point that way.",
        "I have just been reading, in Mr. Hazlitt’s translation,\nMontaigne’s account of his journey into Italy, and am\nstruck with nothing more agreeably than the self-\nrespecting fashions of the time. His arrival in each\nplace, the arrival of a gentleman of France, is an event\nof some consequence. Wherever he goes he pays a visit\nto whatever prince or gentleman of note resides upon his\nroad, as a duty to himself and to civilization.  When he\nleaves any house in which he has lodged for a few weeks,\nhe causes his arms to be painted and hung up as a\nperpetual sign to the house, as was the custom of gentlemen.",
        "The complement of this graceful self-respect, and\nthat of all the points of good breeding I most require\nand insist upon, is deference. I like that every chair\nshould be a throne, and hold a king. I prefer a tendency\nto stateliness to an excess of fellowship. Let the\nincommunicable objects of nature and the metaphysical\nisolation of man teach us independence. Let us not be\ntoo much acquainted. I would have a man enter his house\nthrough a hall filled with heroic and sacred sculptures,\nthat he might not want the hint of tranquillity and\nself-poise. We should meet each morning as from foreign\ncountries, and, spending the day together, should depart\nat night, as into foreign countries. In all things I\nwould have the island of a man inviolate. Let us sit\napart as the gods, talking from peak to peak all round\nOlympus. No degree of affection need invade this religion.\nThis is myrrh and rosemary to keep the other sweet. Lovers\nShould guard their strangeness. If they forgive too much,\nall slides into confusion and meanness. It is easy to\npush this deference to a Chinese etiquette; but coolness\nand absence of heat and haste indicate fine qualities. A\ngentleman makes no noise; a lady is serene. Proportionate\nis our disgust at those invaders who fill a studious\nhouse with blast and running, to secure some paltry\nconvenience. Not less I dislike a low sympathy of each with\nhis neighbor’s needs. Must we have a good understanding\nwith one another’s palates? as foolish people who have\nlived long together know when each wants salt or sugar.\nI pray my companion, if he wishes for bread, to ask me\nfor bread, and if he wishes for sassafras or arsenic, to\nask me for them, and not to hold out his plate as if I\nknew already. Every natural function can be dignified by\ndeliberation and privacy. Let us leave hurry to slaves.\nThe compliments and ceremonies of our breeding should\nsignify, however remotely, the recollection of the grandeur\nof our destiny.",
        "The flower of courtesy does not very well bide\nhandling, but if we dare to open another leaf and\nexplore what parts go to its conformation, we shall\nfind also an intellectual quality. To the leaders\nof men, the brain as well as the flesh and the heart\nmust furnish a proportion. Defect in manners is\nusually the defect of fine perceptions. Men are too\ncoarsely made for the delicacy of beautiful carriage\nand customs. It is not quite sufficient to good-\nbreeding, a union of kindness and independence. We\nimperatively require a perception of, and a homage\nto beauty in our companions. Other virtues are in\nrequest in the field and workyard, but a certain\ndegree of taste is not to be spared in those we sit\nwith. I could better eat with one who did not respect\nthe truth or the laws than with a sloven and\nunpresentable person. Moral qualities rule the world,\nbut at short distances the senses are despotic. The\nsame discrimination of fit and fair runs out, if with\nless rigor, into all parts of life. The average spirit\nof the energetic class is good sense, acting under\ncertain limitations and to certain ends. It entertains\nevery natural gift. Social in its nature, it respects\neverything which tends to unite men. It delights in\nmeasure. The love of beauty is mainly the love of\nmeasure or proportion. The person who screams, or uses\nthe superlative degree, or converses with heat, puts\nwhole drawing-rooms to flight. If you wish to be loved,\nlove measure. You must have genius or a prodigious\nusefulness if you will hide the want of measure. This\nperception comes in to polish and perfect the parts of\nthe social instrument. Society will pardon much to\ngenius and special gifts, but, being in its nature a\nconvention, it loves what is conventional, or what\nbelongs to coming together. That makes the good and bad\nof manners, namely what helps or hinders fellowship.\nFor fashion is not good sense absolute, but relative;\nnot good sense private, but good sense entertaining\ncompany. It hates corners and sharp points of character,\nhates quarrelsome, egotistical, solitary, and gloomy\npeople; hates whatever can interfere with total blending\nof parties; whilst it values all peculiarities as in the\nhighest degree refreshing, which can consist with good\nfellowship. And besides the general infusion of wit to\nheighten civility, the direct splendor of intellectual\npower is ever welcome in fine society as the costliest\naddition to its rule and its credit.",
        "The dry light must shine in to adorn our festival,\nbut it must be tempered and shaded, or that will\nalso offend. Accuracy is essential to beauty, and\nquick perceptions to politeness, but not too quick\nperceptions. One may be too punctual and too precise.\nHe must leave the omniscience of business at the\ndoor, when he comes into the palace of beauty. Society\nloves creole natures, and sleepy languishing manners,\nso that they cover sense, grace and good-will: the air\nof drowsy strength, which disarms criticism; perhaps\nbecause such a person seems to reserve himself for the\nbest of the game, and not spend himself on surfaces;\nan ignoring eye, which does not see the annoyances,\nshifts, and inconveniences that cloud the brow and\nsmother the voice of the sensitive.",
        "Therefore besides personal force and so much\nperception as constitutes unerring taste, society\ndemands in its patrician class another element\nalready intimated, which it significantly terms\ngood-nature,—expressing all degrees of generosity,\nfrom the lowest willingness and faculty to oblige,\nup to the heights of magnanimity and love. Insight\nwe must have, or we shall run against one another\nand miss the way to our food; but intellect is\nselfish and barren. The secret of success in society\nis a certain heartiness and sympathy. A man who is\nnot happy in the company cannot find any word in his\nmemory that will fit the occasion. All his information\nis a little impertinent. A man who is happy there,\nfinds in every turn of the conversation equally lucky\noccasions for the introduction of that which he has\nto say. The favorites of society, and what it calls\nwhole souls, are able men and of more spirit than wit,\nwho have no uncomfortable egotism, but who exactly\nfill the hour and the company; contented and contenting,\nat a marriage or a funeral, a ball or a jury, a water-\nparty or a shooting-match. England, which is rich in\ngentlemen, furnished, in the beginning of the present\ncentury, a good model of that genius which the world\nloves, in Mr. Fox, who added to his great abilities\nthe most social disposition and real love of men.\nParliamentary history has few better passages than the\ndebate in which Burke and Fox separated in the House\nof Commons; when Fox urged on his old friend the claims\nof old friendship with such tenderness that the house\nwas moved to tears. Another anecdote is so close to my\nmatter, that I must hazard the story. A tradesman who\nhad long dunned him for a note of three hundred guineas,\nfound him one day counting gold, and demanded payment:\n—\"No,” said Fox, “I owe this money to Sheridan; it is\na debt of honor; if an accident should happen to me,\nhe has nothing to show.” “Then,” said the creditor, “I\nchange my debt into a debt of honor,” and tore the note\nin pieces. Fox thanked the man for his confidence and\npaid him, saying, “his debt was of older standing, and\nSheridan must wait.” Lover of liberty, friend of the\nHindoo, friend of the African slave, he possessed a\ngreat personal popularity; and Napoleon said of him on\nthe occasion of his visit to Paris, in 1805, “Mr. Fox\nwill always hold the first place in an assembly at\nthe Tuileries.”",
        "We may easily seem ridiculous in our eulogy of\ncourtesy, whenever we insist on benevolence as its\nfoundation. The painted phantasm Fashion rises to\ncast a species of derision on what we say. But I\nwill neither be driven from some allowance to\nFashion as a symbolic institution, nor from the\nbelief that love is the basis of courtesy. We must\nobtain that, if we can; but by all means we must\naffirm this. Life owes much of its spirit to these\nsharp contrasts. Fashion, which affects to be honor,\nis often, in all men’s experience, only a ballroom-\ncode. Yet so long as it is the highest circle in the\nimagination of the best heads on the planet, there\nis something necessary and excellent in it; for it\nis not to be supposed that men have agreed to be the\ndupes of anything preposterous; and the respect which\nthese mysteries inspire in the most rude and sylvan\ncharacters, and the curiosity with which details of\nhigh life are read, betray the universality of the\nlove of cultivated manners. I know that a comic\ndisparity would be felt, if we should enter the\nacknowledged ’first circles’ and apply these terrific\nstandards of justice, beauty, and benefit to the\nindividuals actually found there. Monarchs and heroes,\nsages and lovers, these gallants are not.  Fashion has\nmany classes and many rules of probation and admission,\nand not the best alone. There is not only the right of\nconquest, which genius pretends,—the individual\ndemonstrating his natural aristocracy best of the best;\n—but less claims will pass for the time; for Fashion\nloves lions, and points like Circe to her horned company.\nThis gentleman is this afternoon arrived from Denmark;\nand that is my Lord Ride, who came yesterday from Bagdat;\nhere is Captain Friese, from Cape Turnagain; and Captain\nSymmes, from the interior of the earth; and Monsieur\nJovaire, who came down this morning in a balloon; Mr.\nHobnail, the reformer; and Reverend Jul Bat, who has\nconverted the whole torrid zone in his Sunday school;\nand Signor Torre del Greco, who extinguished Vesuvius\nby pouring into it the Bay of Naples; Spahi, the Persian\nambassador; and Tul Wil Shan, the exiled nabob of Nepaul,\nwhose saddle is the new moon.—But these are monsters of\none day, and to-morrow will be dismissed to their holes\nand dens; for in these rooms every chair is waited for.\nThe artist, the scholar, and, in general, the clerisy,\nwins their way up into these places and get represented\nhere, somewhat on this footing of conquest.  Another mode\nis to pass through all the degrees, spending a year and a\nday in St. Michael’s Square, being steeped in Cologne\nwater, and perfumed, and dined, and introduced, and\nproperly grounded in all the biography and politics and\nanecdotes of the boudoirs.",
        "Yet these fineries may have grace and wit. Let\nthere be grotesque sculpture about the gates and\noffices of temples. Let the creed and commandments\neven have the saucy homage of parody. The forms of\npoliteness universally express benevolence in\nsuperlative degrees. What if they are in the mouths\nof selfish men, and used as means of selfishness?\nWhat if the false gentleman almost bows the true out\nOf the world? What if the false gentleman contrives\nso to address his companion as civilly to exclude\nall others from his discourse, and also to make them\nfeel excluded? Real service will not lose its nobleness.\nAll generosity is not merely French and sentimental;\nnor is it to be concealed that living blood and a\npassion of kindness does at last distinguish God’s\ngentleman from Fashion’s. The epitaph of Sir Jenkin\nGrout is not wholly unintelligible to the present age:\n“Here lies Sir Jenkin Grout, who loved his friend and\npersuaded his enemy: what his mouth ate, his hand paid\nfor: what his servants robbed, he restored: if a woman\ngave him pleasure, he supported her in pain: he never\nforgot his children; and whoso touched his finger,\ndrew after it his whole body.” Even the line of heroes\nis not utterly extinct. There is still ever some\nadmirable person in plain clothes, standing on the\nwharf, who jumps in to rescue a drowning man; there\nis still some absurd inventor of charities; some guide\nand comforter of runaway slaves; some friend of Poland;\nsome Philhellene; some fanatic who plants shade-trees\nfor the second and third generation, and orchards when\nhe is grown old; some well-concealed piety; some just\nman happy in an ill fame; some youth ashamed of the\nfavors of fortune and impatiently casting them on other\nshoulders. And these are the centres of society, on\nwhich it returns for fresh impulses. These are the\ncreators of Fashion, which is an attempt to organize\nbeauty of behavior. The beautiful and the generous are,\nin the theory, the doctors and apostles of this church:\nScipio, and the Cid, and Sir Philip Sidney, and\nWashington, and every pure and valiant heart who\nworshipped Beauty by word and by deed. The persons who\nconstitute the natural aristocracy are not found in the\nactual aristocracy, or only on its edge; as the chemical\nenergy of the spectrum is found to be greatest just\noutside of the spectrum. Yet that is the infirmity of\nthe seneschals, who do not know their sovereign when he\nappears. The theory of society supposes the existence\nand sovereignty of these. It divines afar off their\ncoming. It says with the elder gods,—",
        "Therefore, within the ethnical circle of good\nsociety there is a narrower and higher circle,\nconcentration of its light, and flower of courtesy,\nto which there is always a tacit appeal of pride\nand reference, as to its inner and imperial court;\nthe parliament of love and chivalry. And this is\nconstituted of those persons in whom heroic\ndispositions are native; with the love of beauty,\nthe delight in society, and the power to embellish\nthe passing day. If the individuals who compose\nthe purest circles of aristocracy in Europe, the\nguarded blood of centuries, should pass in review,\nin such manner as that we could at leisure and\ncritically inspect their behavior, we might find\nno gentleman and no lady; for although excellent\nspecimens of courtesy and high-breeding would\ngratify us in the assemblage, in the particulars we\nshould detect offence. Because elegance comes of no\nbreeding, but of birth. There must be romance of\ncharacter, or the most fastidious exclusion of\nimpertinencies will not avail. It must be genius which\ntakes that direction: it must be not courteous, but\ncourtesy. High behavior is as rare in fiction as it is\nin fact.  Scott is praised for the fidelity with which\nhe painted the demeanor and conversation of the superior\nclasses. Certainly, kings and queens, nobles and great\nladies, had some right to complain of the absurdity\nthat had been put in their mouths before the days of\nWaverley; but neither does Scott’s dialogue bear\ncriticism. His lords brave each other in smart\nepigramatic speeches, but the dialogue is in costume,\nand does not please on the second reading: it is not\nwarm with life. In Shakspeare alone the speakers do not\nstrut and bridle, the dialogue is easily great, and he\nadds to so many titles that of being the best-bred man\nin England and in Christendom. Once or twice in a\nlifetime we are permitted to enjoy the charm of noble\nmanners, in the presence of a man or woman who have no\nbar in their nature, but whose character emanates freely\nin their word and gesture. A beautiful form is better\nthan a beautiful face; a beautiful behavior is better\nthan a beautiful form: it gives a higher pleasure than\nstatues or pictures; it is the finest of the fine arts.\nA man is but a little thing in the midst of the objects\nof nature, yet, by the moral quality radiating from his\ncountenance he may abolish all considerations of\nmagnitude, and in his manners equal the majesty of the\nworld. I have seen an individual whose manners, though\nwholly within the conventions of elegant society, were\nnever learned there, but were original and commanding\nand held out protection and prosperity; one who did not\nneed the aid of a court-suit, but carried the holiday\nin his eye; who exhilarated the fancy by flinging wide\nthe doors of new modes of existence; who shook off the\ncaptivity of etiquette, with happy, spirited bearing,\ngood-natured and free as Robin Hood; yet with the port\nof an emperor, if need be,—calm, serious, and fit to\nstand the gaze of millions.",
        "The open air and the fields, the street and public\nchambers are the places where Man executes his will;\nlet him yield or divide the sceptre at the door of\nthe house. Woman, with her instinct of behavior,\ninstantly detects in man a love of trifles, any\ncoldness or imbecility, or, in short, any want of\nthat large, flowing, and magnanimous deportment\nwhich is indispensable as an exterior in the hall.\nOur American institutions have been friendly to her,\nand at this moment I esteem it a chief felicity of\nthis country, that it excels in women. A certain\nawkward consciousness of inferiority in the men may\ngive rise to the new chivalry in behalf of Woman’s\nRights. Certainly let her be as much better placed\nin the laws and in social forms as the most zealous\nreformer can ask, but I confide so entirely in her\ninspiring and musical nature, that I believe only\nherself can show us how she shall be served. The\nwonderful generosity of her sentiments raises her at\ntimes into heroical and godlike regions, and verifies\nthe pictures of Minerva, Juno, or Polymnia; and by\nthe firmness with which she treads her upward path,\nshe convinces the coarsest calculators that another\nroad exists than that which their feet know. But\nbesides those who make good in our imagination the\nplace of muses and of Delphic Sibyls, are there not\nwomen who fill our vase with wine and roses to the\nbrim, so that the wine runs over and fills the house\nwith perfume; who inspire us with courtesy; who unloose\nour tongues and we speak; who anoint our eyes and we\nsee? We say things we never thought to have said; for\nonce, our walls of habitual reserve vanished and left\nus at large; we were children playing with children\nin a wide field of flowers. Steep us, we cried, in these\ninfluences, for days, for weeks, and we shall be sunny\npoets and will write out in many-colored words the\nromance that you are. Was it Hafiz or Firdousi that\nsaid of his Persian Lilla, She was an elemental force,\nand astonished me by her amount of life, when I saw her\nday after day radiating, every instant, redundant joy\nand grace on all around her. She was a solvent powerful\nto reconcile all heterogeneous persons into one society:\nlike air or water, an element of such a great range of\naffinities that it combines readily with a thousand\nsubstances. Where she is present all others will be\nmore than they are wont. She was a unit and whole, so\nthat whatsoever she did, became her. She had too much\nsympathy and desire to please, than that you could say\nher manners were marked with dignity, yet no princess\ncould surpass her clear and erect demeanor on each\noccasion. She did not study the Persian grammar, nor\nthe books of the seven poets, but all the poems of the\nseven seemed to be written upon her. For though the\nbias of her nature was not to thought, but to sympathy,\nyet was she so perfect in her own nature as to meet\nintellectual persons by the fulness of her heart,\nwarming them by her sentiments; believing, as she did,\nthat by dealing nobly with all, all would show\nthemselves noble.",
        "I know that this Byzantine pile of chivalry or\nFashion, which seems so fair and picturesque to\nthose who look at the contemporary facts for\nscience or for entertainment, is not equally\npleasant to all spectators.  The constitution of\nour society makes it a giant’s castle to the\nambitious youth who have not found their names\nenrolled in its Golden Book, and whom it has\nexcluded from its coveted honors and privileges.\nThey have yet to learn that its seeming grandeur\nis shadowy and relative: it is great by their\nallowance; its proudest gates will fly open at the\napproach of their courage and virtue. For the\npresent distress, however, of those who are\npredisposed to suffer from the tyrannies of this\ncaprice, there are easy remedies. To remove your\nresidence a couple of miles, or at most four, will\ncommonly relieve the most extreme susceptibility.\nFor the advantages which fashion values are plants\nwhich thrive in very confined localities, in a few\nstreets namely. Out of this precinct they go for\nnothing; are of no use in the farm, in the forest,\nin the market, in war, in the nuptial society, in\nthe literary or scientific circle, at sea, in\nfriendship, in the heaven of thought or virtue.",
        "But we have lingered long enough in these painted\ncourts. The worth of the thing signified must\nvindicate our taste for the emblem. Everything that\nis called fashion and courtesy humbles itself before\nthe cause and fountain of honor, creator of titles\nand dignities, namely the heart of love. This is the\nroyal blood, this the fire, which, in all countries\nand contingencies, will work after its kind and\nconquer and expand all that approaches it. This gives\nnew meanings to every fact. This impoverishes the\nrich, suffering no grandeur but its own. What is rich?\nAre you rich enough to help anybody? to succor the\nunfashionable and the eccentric? rich enough to make\nthe Canadian in his wagon, the itinerant with his\nconsul’s paper which commends him “To the charitable,\"\nthe swarthy Italian with his few broken words of\nEnglish, the lame pauper hunted by overseers from town\nto town, even the poor insane or besotted wreck of man\nor woman, feel the noble exception of your presence and\nyour house from the general bleakness and stoniness; to\nmake such feel that they were greeted with a voice\nwhich made them both remember and hope? What is vulgar\nbut to refuse the claim on acute and conclusive reasons?\nWhat is gentle, but to allow it, and give their heart\nand yours one holiday from the national caution? Without\nthe rich heart, wealth is an ugly beggar. The king of\nSchiraz could not afford to be so bountiful as the poor\nOsman who dwelt at his gate. Osman had a humanity so\nbroad and deep that although his speech was so bold and\nfree with the Koran as to disgust all the dervishes,\nyet was there never a poor outcast, eccentric, or insane\nman, some fool who had cut off his beard, or who had\nbeen mutilated under a vow, or had a pet madness in his\nbrain, but fled at once to him; that great heart lay\nthere so sunny and hospitable in the centre of the\ncountry, that it seemed as if the instinct of all\nsufferers drew them to his side. And the madness which\nhe harbored he did not share. Is not this to be rich?\nthis only to be rightly rich?",
        "But I shall hear without pain that I play the\ncourtier very ill, and talk of that which I do not\nwell understand. It is easy to see, that what is\ncalled by distinction society and fashion has good\nlaws as well as bad, has much that is necessary,\nand much that is absurd. Too good for banning, and\ntoo bad for blessing, it reminds us of a tradition\nof the pagan mythology, in any attempt to settle\nits character. ’I overheard Jove, one day,’ said\nSilenus, ’talking of destroying the earth; he said\nit had failed; they were all rogues and vixens, who\nwent from bad to worse, as fast as the days succeeded\neach other. Minerva said she hoped not; they were\nonly ridiculous little creatures, with this odd\ncircumstance, that they had a blur, or indeterminate\naspect, seen far or seen near; if you called them bad,\nthey would appear so; if you called them good, they\nwould appear so; and there was no one person or action\namong them, which would not puzzle her owl, much more\nall Olympus, to know whether it was fundamentally bad\nor good.’",
